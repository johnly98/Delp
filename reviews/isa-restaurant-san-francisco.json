So much delicious food. It's meant to be shared so my friend and I made sure we ordered different plates so we could share. The seasonal fish was halibut and it was so delicious! Whatever the green sauce on the flank steak is was amazing and it was cooked to medium rare perfection. They also bring out a bread basket here with free refills (though we couldn't finish our one with all the yummy food we had)\n\nOur waiter was phenomenal. He was so nice, helpful with the menu and explaining how sharing the plates are. He was great conversation, too! The staff was personable and we loved hearing the history of the restaurant. Longstanding and the menu hasn't changed much. \n\nI got to there a little early to meet a friend while I was in town. They asked me if a table in the front room was fine, I said sure, not knowing there was a patio. When my friend arrived a moment later she inquired about a patio table and the staff was so nice and accommodating! They checked if they had space and moved us back there no questions asked. The patio was gorgeous! I love the lights they have going on and it's heated, which was a plus.", "author": "Rachel M."}

While the restaurant was not busy the service was slow (waiter walked by 4 times before we shouted at them that we were ready to order even though our menus were closed) and the food took much longer than expected. I ended up getting the lamb which was fine but the portions are small so we ended up heading somewhere else afterwards as we were still hungry. Took some more time to hunt down the waiter for a check.\n\nGiven the other positive reviews I'm  assuming the service isn't always like this so YMMV - but I will say that for what you pay and given the other restaurants in the area do yourself a favor and look at some other options before going here", "author": "Al D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-10", "description": "Isa was pretty underwhelming for me and my family. Now, I can understand why it was pretty easy to get a dinner reservation during peak dinner hours on a Saturday.\n\nI felt a big part of what I brought down my experience here was that our waiter talked too much and sold the food to be better than it actually was. It sucks to talk a big game and fall flat from the expectations you give people. The biggest plus for Isa is that it is convenient (no lines, waits, easy to make a reservation) and the prices are good.\n\nThat said, the decor and experience of eating here felt cheap, dark and uninspiring. My family ordered the top recommendation by our waiter: steak, pork chop, fish of the day, appetizers and the foie gras. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm now used to quality, dry aged meats, the steak and pork chop at Isa tasted dry, less naturally flavored, and over salted. The fish of the day was halibut, which was actually pretty moist except that its flavor was pretty bland without much dimension. Appetizers and desserts were both ok but were nothing interesting to write home about. The foie gras seems to be why people come here to eat and is actually highly recommended by the waiter. I wasn't planning to be blown away by it because it is hard to mess it up. That said, the foie gras that we had tasted older and somewhat off from ones I've had at other restaurants. I can't put my finger on exactly what but something about it was off.\n\nFor those of you who have a sweet tooth, you might enjoy the prix fix dessert selections. 3 out of the 4 options for us that night was cheese. Personally, I love cheese. My favorite was a soft triple cream Brie that was served with honey, grapes and walnuts. Nothing special, but it was tasty. The other cheeses were way too salted and heavy to end with. I felt their selection for dessert was a quite off. I don't remember much about the actual \"sweet dessert.\" Their other dessert menu, not included on the fix menu, is probably the way to go.\n\n\nOverall, my experience here was mediocre in terms of food and experience. Service is also slow and not well coordinated. Our appetizers were all served at different times and they served our entrees when our table was still working through appetizers, without much room. I don't think I'll be returning in the future, not even for the foie gras. That being said, if you're looking for a good deal (their prix fix is pretty cheap for SF, at around $30pp) and is a quick place to grab dinner when other sought-after choices are packed with people, Isa would be a decent option. However, if you're a pretty decent chef at home or have eaten at a lot of SF restaurants, you might not be that into or impressed by Isa.", "author": "Jenny Z."}

Definitely a place to chat while having food and drinks.  The space can accommodate some decent size groups.  However, it feels a little bit tight given it is in SF.  I'd be a regular visitor if I lived in San Francisco permanently.  \n\nFood\nWe came during restaurant week in 2017 and the pre-fixed meal is delicious.\n\n-$1 oysters: Good deal for $1.  We started with this before our pre-fixed meal.  \n-Foie gras: Pear, toast and Foie Gras. Very good combo.  Foie gras is really tasty.\n-Potato leak soup:  Somewhat creamy and tasty with the bread. \n-Butter lettuce: Some pepper and Italian type dressing with candied walnuts. The dish has blue cheese on top.\n-Tuna: Sashimi style tuna with some jalape\u00f1o and sesame seed. \n-Carpaccio: The salmon didn't taste too fresh. The rest was decent. \n-Duck breast:  Very well done.  There is a nice sear on the outside.\n-Steak: Impressive job done by the cook.  Super tasty sauce on the bottom and horse radish on top. \n-Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e:  Typical usual tasty desert.  \n-Ice cream: Almond flavored and reminds me of the Chinese almond cookies. \n\nService\nThe customer service was very good for us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-13", "description": "3.75/5\nHonestly one of the better restaurant week experiences I've had (though honestly they usually aren't great). Food was solid all around and $40 was a pretty reasonable price. Made a reservation for a Sunday night for an early-ish dinner. We were seated right away and service was very friendly throughout the night.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the following items:\n1) Potato & Leak Soup w/ cream/truffle oil/chives: Friends 1st course from RW. Decent soup. Light and smooth though a bit heavy handed on the truffle oil which I didn't feel was very necessary in the first place. (3.25/5)\n\n2) Arugula Salad: My 1st Course for RW. A simple semi classic salad. Light vinegary dressing w/ some fresh fruits and some extra crunch from the fennel + a bit of nutty cheese. Can't go wrong. (3.5/5)\n\n3) Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio: My 2nd Course for RW: Another very classic dish. The main \"unique\" angle of this dish was the egg which honestly didn't stand out much. Salmon quality was decent (though personally wish it was a bit colder/firmer). Could've used some other flavor to make it standout but it's fine all around (3.5/5)\n\n4) Duck breast: My 3rd course for RW. One of the better dishes off the RW menu in my opinion. There isn't a flavor that blew my mind but it was good. Duck breast was very moist and tender (though would've liked a bit more sear on the fat) with just the right amount of fat. I wasn't a huge fan of the golden beets/spinach combination. The beets were soft and had a sweet earthy flavor but the chunks were too large. The spinach also didn't hold up to the other flavors and textures. The tangy goat cheese went well with the beets though. The huckleberry sauce went well with the duck. (3.75/5)\n\n5) Truffle Risotto: Friend's 3rd course. Had a bite. Not much to say. It's about as basic of a risotto as you can get from a semi-nice place. Pretty creamy and some mushroom flavor though. Not bad but there's better options (like the duck) (3.25/5)\n\n6) Foie Gras & Fruit Pairing: A $25 side option and the best item of the night. A very sizeable, solid piece of foie gras. Perfect sear, very fatty, and paired w/ some delicious pears and toasted almost custard-like bread. (4.75/5)\n\n7) Bucherondin De Chevre paired w/ a star-anise honey & walnuts: A lovely way to end the dinner. A semi-pungent goat cheese w/ a light amount of honey and some walnuts for crunch. Honey could have used a bit more of the anise flavor but then again it's all about that cheese (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I left very happy with my meal. I do feel like my friend's options were a bit more underwhelming so I can't say how consistent this place is but they definitely have some good options that are worth the price. Would love to come back (especially for dollar oysters).", "author": "Vivian C."}

Seating inside the restaurant is fine, but to get the full experience, book yourself a back patio reservation and be merry.\n\nThey've got a great selection of wine, and entree portion size is plenty big. Our table had the duck breast and flat iron steak, both were out-of-this-world delicious.\n\nAtmosphere in the back patio can be both group setting/birthday party shenanigans as well as romantic/intimate like your 4th date with that special someone you met online and trying to impress because you think it's finally time to make a move.  Our reservation was party of four - two married couples looking for an excuse to throw back as many glasses of wine as possible, and stuff our face with delicious meat.\n\nJudging by all the Marina douchebag debacle one expect to encounter in any given night of the week, Isa stood out to me as one of the finer establishments in this neighborhood.", "author": "Dave K."}

Paired with some pears with some kind of fruit reduction and a custard brioche. (5/5) \n\nPotato Wrapped Sea Bass was also a favorite. Served w/ capers, Fesno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter & lemon. Perfectly moist and the potato worked well to balance out the strong flavors. Without it i think it would have been too salty (4.5/5) \n\nMaple leaf farm duck breast - with braised red cabbage, potato gratin\u00e9 & huckleberry sauce.

He recommended the \"Grade A foie gras\" and the duck dish. \n\nI must admit the foie gras was really good and extremely buttery and rich. This is one of the best that I've ever had and wouldn't mind coming back for it. \n\nI ordered the potato wrapped sea bass which was so buttery with flavors and the light seared crunch of the thin potatoes that was wrapped around it made it a dream dish to eat. \nYou definitely will have to try this dish if it's still in the menu. You'll be happy that you did. \n\nThe last thing that was ordered was the maple leaf farm duck breast which was very succulent and moist. It wasn't dry at all and the seared crust of it was just too delicious. The richness of the flavor from this duck breast will definitely fulfill your appetite.\n\nThis place also has a good selection of wine and I believe their happy hours include some of the good wine that they provide. \n\nParking is a little bit hard to find so be prepared to come 30mins to an hour early.", "author": "Lakeen W."}

Very lovely and well decorated. Not so shinny, but warm and delicate. \n\nService 5/5\nMy servicer Dean, who is the most professional servicer I have ever met. Always be energetic and wears a smile on his face. He explained everything including dinner menu, special menu, wine menu and promotions to us in detail, willing to further explain my doubt for the menu. \nHowever, the host who took us to the seat did not do well in his job. No smile and very rude, when we found my chair is not convenient for me, I told him I want to change the seat, he informed that upper level has been booked and I could not sit at that way. So I kept sitting for the uncomfortable table until I found they changed seat for other tables. I asked my servicer Dean for help and he immediately did the change for me.

That was over 7 years ago and 7 years later, this place still holds up and is just like how I remembered it. Back when the sale of foie gras was banned in California, Isa was doing secret dining clubs where people could buy fruit, and enjoy foie gras on the side for free. They stick to what they know - quality French meals served at an affordable price. They don't try to do what's on trend (hence their longevity). Although the Marina area is a pain to get to, Isa was just a $20 Uber ride from the peninsula. I recently planned a 10-person birthday dinner here for a friend and it was so hassle-free, unlike other SF spots. The real star of our last meal was the great service given by Dean who helped us enjoy our long, coursed out meal. Dean warned us not to fill up on their baguette bread, but when those suckers come out warm, no one at our table could help but enjoy it. Everyone at your table can order their own prix fixe meal, but plates are served as they are ready and they encourage family-style sharing. One person at the table should always opt for the scallops. I think the table favorite dessert was their classic creme brulee. Reading some of the reviews from this last SF Restaurant week regarding the service, most praised Dean and had issues with other servers. I can believe it, during our meal one of the waiters dropped some salad in my hair, but I shrugged it off. I would suggest coming back here outside of SF restaurant week, they have a regular prix fixe meal that's even cheaper than the SF Restaurant Week pricing. And of course, ask for Dean, he'll take care of you!\n\nPro-tip: Payment is limited to two credit cards per table. They don't serve hard alcohol, but do have an array of beers and wines. Their soju cocktails are only $5 each before 7pm.", "author": "Ghia G."}

My girls and I had reservations at 830 pm. However, we were not seated until 9-910pm. We had plenty of time to look over the menu as we were waiting. Ordered right when we were seated. It was a four course meal. \n\nFirst course: We ordered three potato and leek soup and a arugula salad. Also, ordered a dozen oysters. The soup arrived first with bread and butter. The three soups were almost finished and we decided to ask our waiter for the status of the salad. Waiter's response was, \"we will bring it out when the kitchen is done with it.\" One of our second course dish came out and I asked our waiter about the salad that never came. To my surprise, he came inches away from my face and said, \"I TOLD YOU, WE WILL BRING IT OUT WHEN THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point, I'm in total shock. I have never ever in my life had a waiter get in my face like that. I sat there in disbelief and did not say a word. Luckily, my best friend who was sitting in front of me questioned the waiter about his rudeness. We had asked the manager of the restaurant for a new waiter. That kind of behavior and customer service is unacceptable. \n\nSecond course: I recommend the mussels and the goat cheese. Both were really good and had a lot of flavor. We also tried to salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. Not as good as it sounds. Also, as our waiter was serving our dishes, he knocked down a glass of wine on my best friend across from me. The entire restaurant went quiet as we all watch her wipe off all the wine that was on her face, neck, and shirt! The waiter was really apologetic and he seemed to be very sincere and genuine with his apology. It was truly an accident, and we didn't want to make him feel worst than he probably already feels about spilling the wine. We said it was totally okay and that he didn't have to keep apologizing. \n\nThird course: Seared scallops with bacon and mashed potatoes was a hit. Super good! I would also recommend the truffle risotto. We also ordered the seasonal fish with spinach. Fish was really bland, but the spinach was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the angus flat iron steak came. My friend took a bite from the steak and it was cold. Not warm but COLD. It was probably sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it was served to us. We mentioned it to a waiter and the waiter responded with, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? Is this a new thing where steak is served cold?? The was absolutely the last straw for everyone at our table. Waiter took the plate back in to the kitchen and brought it back a few moments later. The pieces of steak that were moved when my friend tried to eat it was at the same placement when the waiter had brought it back to the kitchen. We figured they just microwaved it and brought it back. We barely ate the steak and asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. \n\nFourth course: While waiting for our dessert, our bill came. Waiter came back and wanted to know why we didn't want dessert. They must've misunderstood us, because we had asked for the check while we wait for the dessert. Due to the confusion, we probably had to wait another 15-20 minutes for some darn ice cream and cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nThis has got to be the worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant. If I could give this place a zero star I would. So, this one star is for the waiter Dean. Dean tried everything possible to accommodate us.", "author": "Bonnie T."}

Dean was our server and he was beyond friendly and very helpful. It did take a little bit of time for some things to come out, but they are very busy for restaurant week.\n\nThe only dish that I wouldn't recommend is the flat iron steak - we ordered medium rare but it was medium well, which was disappointing.\n\nPortion sizes were great for the $40 meal and definitely a great deal for all of the food!

I came here for a friends birthday so we had a HUGE group and coordinating with the events person we were suppose to get a prefix menu but we ended up not getting that but the regular menu. Because we had about 18 people in our party, and we were told each person should choose two things to share I decided to divide up the sharing with 4 people.  For starters we had the clams, prawns, and shared a tuna tartare. Our starters took FOREVER to come out. I mean we got to the restaurant around 8 and we all only had a few starters for the other people and didn't full eat till about 10. And our entrees we ordered the scallops, sea bass, spaghetti, and risotto.\n\nThe clams were ok,  pretty flavorful and we ordered two orders of it as we got really hungry. I wouldn't say its different from any other restaurant, but they cooked it well enough and we finished the plate. \nThe prawns were a bit over cooked, but we each only had one to eat so I want to say that because we waited for almost 2 hours for food we got so hungry we ate anything that came our way. As for the tuna I only tried a bit of it since the other group ordered it, and it was Ok, nothing that WOW'ed me. \n\nThe scallops were cooked perfectly and went well with the brussels sprouts. The risotto was cook good as well and I think we liked the two dishes the best. The sea bass however, we were told was a popular dish and we were not impressed. The sea bass was over cooked and I could not taste any flavor, and I eat fish often. The spaghetti was ok as well, it was something I can technically cook at home, it wasn't unique in anyway. \n\nAll in all the food was not the best to what I've seen in previous reviews. It was a it disappointing in how unorganized the staff was when we ordered our food. One waiter just threw the plate of food on the table and just assumed we ordered it and  the wait was EXTREMELY long. Very disappointing, and there was another party next to us that arrived later than we did which looked like they gotten all their food before use which was a bit frustrating. We arrive by 8pm to the restaurant and did not leave till midnight. And the food was not made out to be shared, unless your ok with a bit of each plate. I only gave it two stars as our main waiter was super nice and friendly and hes been with the restaurant for about 9 years otherwise I would give it a one star for everything else food and other waitress. I probably wont be coming back as this experience was not the greatest.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I wasn't blown away by the ahi tuna, potato wrapped bass, or any of the desserts we had. Their goat cheese dessert sounded like it would be special but there wasn't enough sweetness to balance out the goat. The grapefruit granite was nice to cleanse the palette but very mediocre and tasted like a non sweet icee.

When we asked our waiter why that happened, instead of providing an explanation, he exclaimed \"that's how it is here.\" Not satisfied with his answer, we requested to speak with a manager. Rather than apologize and explain to us why this transpired, the manager decided it would be better to take a condescending tone and inform us \"that's how it's been for the last 12 years, you can't read the menu? check Yelp.\" When we attempted to continue the conversation, he turned around and walked away as if he couldn't be bothered with this. He circled back around a couple times to throw a few more choice comments our way. Clearly, he was not interested in the satisfaction of his guests, and preferred to find ways to demean his unhappy customers instead. \n\nEventually, our bill came, and our kind waiter took the liberty of filling out the tip amount by hand. They neglected the fact that 3/6 of our entrees had to be sent back because they were cold, and that items were sent to our table that we hadn't ordered. Rather than deal with this nonsense from the manager and avoid an altercation, we decided to pay the bill in full and walk out. Much to our dismay, the manager chose to count our payment in front of us and throw in some more passive aggressive lines. Cute.

If you see my other reviews, I understand it's SFRW and a lot of restaurants run a bit behind due to being busier than usual. Again, this was no problem for me. What had occurred following being seated is why I would never come back.\n\n3 out of 4 of our first course was served (soup), along with bread and butter. We finished our soups and a waiter came to grab all the empty bowls and one of our second courses, along with our dozen oysters, were served before we asked our waiter about our friend's first course (arugula salad). I will now describe the waiter's EXACT action and quote him verbatim: he bends over within inches of one of my friends face and says very rudely, \"What did I tell you?!! I told you we bring it out once the kitchen is done with it!!!\" Our whole table was so shocked that we all just sat there for a few moments quietly before one our friend spoke up on our behalf.\n\nAngry, we asked the manager for another server, Dean, who ended up being the saving grace of our night. Dean bumps into our table and accidentally spills a glass of wine all over my friend's shirt and face, but was GENUINELY apologetic about it, so no one was really upset about it. What was upsetting was that when we received the final bill, AT THE VERY LEAST they could have comped that ONE glass of wine.\n\nAlso, our very last third course served was the steak. I was the first one to try a piece and when I bit into a small piece, the steak was COLD. Not cool, but actually COLD. I flagged down a server and told him that the steak was cold and no lie, I'm going to quote verbatim again. He says, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I was AGAIN so shocked that I actually had to stuttered out \"to cook it?\"\n\nAt this point, we all are so upset that we asked for our check so that we can leave ASAP.

Unfortunately, I was only able to get a table at 5:15pm on a Sunday night, which was a bit early. The plus side is that they have happy hour until 7pm, so we got dollar oysters and $5 soju/wines to start off. Drinks are not too strong, but tasty and oysters were standard. The restaurant enters a dim-lit dining area as you're taken through the back. It's a covered outdoor backyard with strings of lights and heated lamps. There's plants hanging all around to give a cozy and romantic ambiance with an outdoor feel. I was head over heels with their d\u00e9cor of the restaurant. To add, we were treated with a warm and chirpy welcome from the server telling us that they have been waiting 15 years for our arrival. What a silly guy.\n\nAlthough complimentary bread was offered, we were also warned to not stuff ourselves since we had a lot of food coming our way. The 4-course restaurant week started off with a Smooth Potato Leek Soup and Arugula Salad. Both were decent, but the salad lacked some flavor. Second course was the Yellowfin Tuna and Organic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio. As a huge fan of raw fish, I loved both of these dishes. The only problem was that I was not too hungry coming in for dinner, so we were both pretty stuffed by this point.\n\nThe main course was the Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast and Grilled Golden Gate Natural Flat Iron Steak. Both of them came with a side of greens: steak with zucchini and potatoes/duck with spinach and beets. Both dishes were very solid and tasty, but I think I was way too stuffed to enjoy any more of it. Thankfully we decided to boxed these up and move onto our dessert. We finished with the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Buche Au Lait De Crevre Aged Goat Cheese. The date loved the goat cheese while I indulged myself in the cr\u00e8me brulee. Very smooth, sweet and a very crystallized top layer --yum!\n\nWhat I loved most was the variety of choices for each course. Although the food was not out of this world, it was still pleasurable.

The last two years were fully booked, so when the participating restaurants were announced again this year, my friend and I immediately jumped on the opportunity.\n\nWhen we walked in, it seemed very quiet and intimate, but our hostess led us out back to the covered porch where it was much more lively. Our server Jon informed us that restaurant week was actually served more family style so he highly recommended ordering different dishes so we could try everything - thank you for the honesty sir!\n\nWe started with the potato leek soup and the butter lettuce salad. The potato leek soup was delicious. The truffle oil on top helped give it that earthy flavor which was then spiked by the delicious bacon pieces in the soup. As for the butter lettuce salad, I thought it was a little too deconstructed. Leaves were coated in balsamic vinaigrette but were just stacked atop a few candied walnuts and crumbles of blue cheese and a few slivers of pear. But when when you gathered all the ingredients together, the bite was really good. Nutty, creamy, sweet, with a little bite.\n\nSecond came the salmon carpaccio and yellowfin tuna. The carpaccio was dressed in creme fraiche with capers, lemon, cucumbers and little bits of egg. Flavors were excellent, but fish was sliced somewhat unevenly. As for the yellowfin tuna, it had a more Asian flair. It was dressed in light soy sauce with a touch of sriracha which definitely gave it a slightly spicy undertone - delicious in my opinion.\n\nNext came the main entrees. The seared scallops were TO. DIE. FOR. They had a beautiful golden crust for the sear and perfectly buttery in texture. My only complaint was that there were only 3 for a main entree. The majority of the plate was composed of vegetables, served in a variety of ways. The risotto was equally delicious, but a bit too rich for my taste buds. Very creamy and very hearty for those who enjoy that type of plate though. And they also don't skimp on the mushrooms!\n\nFor dessert, we opted for the vanilla bean creme brulee and semifreddo. The creme brulee came as expected. I personally thought the sugar crust was too thick, but my friend thought it was done perfectly. In my opinion, it should break like glass, very light revealing that smooth, not fully set custard underneath. As for the semifreddo, it did not skimp on the amaretto flavor - but I love almond, so I found this dessert very delicious. It wasn't too sweet, but it was refreshing (because it was cold) and a nice way to wrap up the meal.\n\nAll in all. 4 courses for $40 is a great value. Add in the share factor and being able to taste 8 different dishes made it an even better experience. The only thing was that I felt service was a bit rushed - perhaps because they were trying to turn over as many tables as possible to accommodate restaurant week. Multiple times, plates were almost taken away before we finished such that the next course could come out.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

During that  time, my girls checked in a few times to get an update on our table since multiple parties who arrived after us were seated. We got responses such as the table was still eating dessert and they were taking longer than expected.. They were determined to seat us at a specific table instead of a table that was already available. \n\n1st course we ordered 3 leek soups and 1 arugula salad. All food came out except for my salad... The girls were pretty much done with their soup and finished the bread. We asked for more bread and the status of the salad. In response, the waiter said \"we will bring it out once the kitchen is done with it.\" Time passes by and still no salad BUT we get one of our second courses... We waived down the waiter and this time around he says and gets in my friend's face, \"I TOLD YOU WE WILL BRING IT OUT ONCE THE KITCHEN IS DONE WITH IT.\" At this point this is when I lose it questioning him of his rudeness and the reason for it.. The waiter replied \"I TOLD YOU...\" instead of apologizing. \n\nAfter all this chaos (mind you, its only about to be the 2nd course), we decided we should ask for a new waiter so it wouldn't be so awkward and negative throughout dinner... We asked for the manager, she apologized and gave us a new waiter.\n\nMoving on we received the next dishes and as the new waiter drops off the food he knocks down my full glass of red wine and I am completely showered in it. I was completely drenched with wine all over my face and shirt. Luckily I was wearing gray and nothing I really cared about. The whole restaurant is in complete silence looking at our table, while the other party next to us offers me their napkin (how embarrassing, right?!). We weren't mad at the server because it was a complete accident and he was totally sincere and apologetic. After the incident, random servers came by instead and I'm guessing this is b/c our server was embarrassed for spilling wine all over me. Moving on we received our steak which came out cold.. We told one of the other servers and he asked us \"So what do you want me to do about it?\" LOL. TBH at this point I'm not sure why we stayed though out the dinner. The steak was returned on the same plate and was basically microwaved since food placement was the same on the plate.\n\nWe asked for the bill while we waited for the dessert and told them we just want to be out of here after we eat our dessert. Somehow they misunderstood us when it was clearly stated we were still waiting for dessert. We wanted to be able to leave right away once we finished dessert. Instead the bill was dropped off and they cleaned our table asking why we didn't want dessert... We checked the bill and not even one thing was comp'd after the whole experience. Only our wine was offered to be comp'd after my friend decided to speak to the manager... She offered her phone number & to personally serve us the next time but what does personally serving us change anything? First of all I won't even be back, second, no comps were offered until one of us complained.. \n\nOVERALL, FOOD WAS JUST OKAY AND NOTHING TO RAVE ABOUT. I RATHER GO ELSEWHERE WITH BETTER FOOD, BETTER SERVICE AND NOT BE SHOWERED IN RED WINE. \n\nOne star only b/c Dean was totally apologetic and tried to accommodate us after accidentally spilling wine all over me. If it was't for him this place would get a ZERO. I do not recommend this place.", "author": "Cat F."}

Upon arrival, the hostess immediately led us through a narrow passage to the back of the restaurant.  We walked by the kitchen and were shown to our table under a tent.  It was supposed to be the garden area.  The setting was not what we had expected but it was fine.\n\nOur waiter was charming and persuaded me to start off with a cocktail called \"Number Seven.\"  It was a mixture of soju, blackberries, ginger and champagne.  Unfortunately, the drink was a miss for me.  Apart from the sweetness, there just wasn't enough of everything aforementioned.\n\nWe ordered a few things for dinner.  For our starter, the oysters on the half shell were accompanied by an orange mignonette.  The tangy sauce had a kick.  I could not say I was a fan of the taste but it got our palates ready for sure.  I had the Butter Lettuce Salad with pears, walnuts, watercress and blue cheese.  The plating looked rather messy and could have used more cheese or dressing to enhance the flavor.  My wife's Arugula Salad had apples, oranges, fennel and parmesan in a lemon vinaigrette.  It was really refreshing.\n\nOnward to more substance, the Steamed Mussels served in a white wine garlic broth were very flavorful.  I also couldn't get enough of the Baked Goat Cheese.  It was just lovely together with the basil pesto and pine nuts.  The next course for my wife was Seared Scallops in truffle sauce.   They were perfectly cooked and the medley of orzo, favas, corn, and tomatoes was a nice accent.  My Angus Flat Iron Steak was slightly over for me but the Bordelaise sauce was nice.\n\nNo matter how full you are, a meal is not complete without dessert.  We each picked a different one.  The Grapefruit Granite was very simple and light.  However, the Semifreddo all'amaretto was creamy and decadent.  I liked it so much there was nothing left on my plate except the mint leaves.\n\nTheir timing on food was pretty good.  Although the restaurant was packed, they did not rush things through.  We were able to take our time and enjoy each course.  The atmosphere was average.  It got a little noisy at times.  Furthermore, I wish they had more restrooms.  Patrons were waiting right in the major thoroughfare.  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience at Isa and would love to return to try the other items with an Amaretto dessert encore.", "author": "Allen C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-23", "description": "I came here on Sunday night for a group of 5 people for SF Restaurant week. To put my review in perspective, I normally do not order 3+ courses meals at restaurants and not an expert on European food. And I have never been to Isa before this. \n\nWhen we came in around 7:45 pm, there were multiple groups waiting in line, good thing we made a reservation. We were seated immediately in the back area. There were a lot of big groups in the back. It was much noisier than I expected for a non-Asian restaurant. It was a big deal through. Although it can be romantics place for two, with the crowd and the noise level, maybe not that night. Because of so many large groups in the back, the space was cramp. \n\nService: 3.5/5\nService was slow that night. Our waiter came over to introduce himself 10-15 minutes after we got seated (Which is a longer than normal). Because of Restaurant week, there is only one set of menu, which is way more convenient for the restaurant to prepare the food. I felt like we spent a lot of time waiting for next course to come out. I guess it's good that they give you plenty of time to finish each course. But it made dinner felt like it was super long (around 2.5 hrs). \n\nPrice 4/5\nIt's $40 dollar for 4 courses meal, which is really reasonable. It also gives you at least 3 options for each course, around 6 for the main course. And Oysters are only $1 each (you must get set of 6 though). \n\nFood 4/5\nBetween the 5 of us, we tried these options dishes: \n\nOysters 3/5 \nMy friends said that it's just mediocre oysters. They definitely had better Oysters. But what can you say, they are only a dollar each. You can find that at many places now. However, the sauce was good. \n\nBacon Potato Leek Soup: 5/5\nIt was really good. I'm not a big leek person but you can't really taste the leek. It is creamy and the Bacon definitely makes it better. (None of us got Salad lol!) \n\nSalmon (Forgot the full name): 4/5 \nIt was good, I definitely liked it. \n\nYellowtail Tuna 3.5/5\nI really like Tartrate. The combination of raw fish and avocado is amazing. However, it is not the big tartrate I have ever had though. It was a bit spicy for me (but I have very low tolerance for spicy food). The portion of avocado is very small, I was a bit disappointed. \n\n\nFlat Iron Steak: 3/5 \nSteak is steak. No the best, not the worse. Afterward, one of my friends wished he got duck breast instead. \n\nScallop 3.5/5\nI personally ordered this. It was a very small portion. I only had 3 scallops (I thought it comes with 4, but whatever). It also comes with mashed potato and butter squash cubes. Probably wouldn't have gotten this if I were to order individually. \n\nMushroom Risotto 4/5\nIt was good, the only downside is that it's vegetarian.\n\nCreme Brulee \nIt was as expected. It wasn't extraordinary. \n\nSemifreddo \nMy friends liked it. We thought it was a melted ice cream at first (lol). It was very different. \n\nAt the end of the night, I was bloated. I don't normally eat a lot, so it might not be a lot of food for guys. I did a survey around the table, we probably would not have ordered any of those separately. But it was a great experience to try different courses in a new restaurant.", "author": "Ashley H."}

The duck breast definitely stood out as the star of the dish with its crispy skin, tender meat and subtle huckleberry sauce. The semifreddo had a strong amaretto kick to it, so take that as you will.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-28", "description": "*SF Restaurant Week 2017 Review*\n\nIt was such a struggle to make reservations here because they have such a narrow window of open hours, but with a 4 course dinner for $40, who could resist? My friend and I eventually settled on a reservation for Tuesday night at 6pm because it was the only night with normal dinner availability. Even though we arrived 30 minutes after opening, the restaurant was already packed and it stayed that way for the entire 2 hours we were there. \n\nWe decided to order different items per course because there was so many options for each, so we started off with a potato leek soup and butter lettuce salad. The flavors in the soup all balanced out very well, and I especially liked the bits of bacon in it; the blue cheese in the salad was quite overpowering and masked even the acidic vinaigrette, and I thought it was a little weird that they gave us entire leaves instead of cutting them into smaller pieces. Next we had the tuna and mussels appetizers. The clear winner here was the mussels: they were sweet and juicy and not overly salty (although a tad on the small side) while the tuna itself didn't have much flavor and I felt that the avocado didn't particularly complement it. \n\nFor our main course, we had the flat iron steak and the duck breast, both cooked medium rare per their suggestion. Both meats were so tender and flavorful! The butter on the steak was a nice touch but it would've been fine on its own, and the thinly sliced zucchini went well with it. I've never had medium rare duck before this, but I was thoroughly impressed by this dish - the golden beets were light and refreshing and the sauce even had whole cranberries! For dessert we both had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was absolutely amazing. We both ended up scraping all the crusted sugar off the edges of the ramekin - no shame - because it was that good.\n\nThis restaurant is perfect for date night as it's super cozy and quiet enough to hold a conversation at a normal volume. Our table was kind of awkward as we were seated in a corner sitting next to each other and facing out the window, and it seemed to be difficult for servers to bring/clear our plates, but at least the food made up for this. Servers were also very attentive and polite, and I thought it was really cool how every customer gets a mystery reward to redeem at a later time - great incentive to get people to come back. Their regular menu is a little above my usual price point, but if you're willing to splurge, you will definitely get a quality meal here!", "author": "KC W."}

The menu is very appealing, with a lot of options for gluten free diners--a plus.  Servers are friendly, if overwhelmed.\n\n  I will say the quality of the food in terms of freshness and flavors was very, very good.  The problem was the preparations.  I ordered duck breast rare and received a portion that was medium- to well-done (not a trace of pink).  The server was so overwhelmed I could see that sending it back would create a major delay, so I kept the dish and, to be fair, the flavors were very good.  But there's no excuse for getting the temperature so wrong. \n\nMy husband's paella came out looking great, with plump prawns and mussels in a pretty saffron-y bed of rice.  Seafood was fresh and tasty and the rice was seasoned nicely with a bit of smoked paprika.  Alas, the rice itself had the texture of mushy porridge -- overcooking the culprit once again.\n\nSo, how to rate this place?

The restaurant is located in the SF Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood, on a busy street lined with restaurants, cafes, and motels/inns.  \n\nOVERALL\n4.5 stars rounding up to 5. Its French/Mediterranean cuisine and virtually all the dishes we had were superb. Price is very reasonable for the area - Union Square and FiDi places can run 25% to 50% higher based on what we ordered.\n\nDRINKS\nHappy hour is before 7pm, so $5 cocktails with Soju!  The first round both the Moscow Mule and Mojito were light, refreshing, and diluted.  The second round they seemed to add double the alcohol so it was like night and day!\n\nAPPS\nLobster broth - its a bubbly, foamy, and hot lobster soup with intense flavors and three fairly large prawns. 5 stars!\n\nGrilled Calamari - Incredibly soft and tender calamari over white beans.  The taste of squid wasn't quite there for some reason, maybe overwhelmed by whatever marinade they used to tenderize the squid? 4 stars.\n\nGrade A Foie Gras - Wow perfectly seared foie gras with a buttery brioche and poached pears - surely a winning combination!  Its one of the better preparations of foie gras and its a generous portion. 5 stars!\n\nMAINS\nPotato-Wrapped Seabass - Their signature dish of the past 16 years and we are fans!  Its a good-sized cylinder of soft, well-seasoned sea bass wrapped with a golden, crispy potato skin for additional texture and flavor.  5 stars!\n\nLamb Chops - Three very meaty chops and were among the softest, juiciest I've had.  Cooked medium rare of course.  I liked the chopped veggies that came with the dish too.  5 stars.\n\nDESSERTS\nWe shared the flourless chocolate cake and vanilla gelato.  The cake was like a souffl\u00e9 in texture, but with a nice light spongy filling and not a liquid center like say in a lava cake.  The warm cake paired well with the sweet, cold gelato. 5 stars.\n\nOTHER\nThe restaurant is small and slightly cramped.

The only course that was good was the tuna tartare and the duck breast. Then they gave me a gift envelope to open at the end. They said to not open, and bring it back to redeem for next time when you come back. I'm most likely not going to come back, so I went ahead and opened it.

One of the best French Bistros I've tried. \n\nA friend and I came here on a weekday night for dinner during SF restaurant week, where they offered prix-fixe menus with 4 courses for only $40. WHAT?! WOW. JUST WOW. The price point for the quality of the food is unreal, you won't find a deal this good anywhere else in SF. First of all they had the most amount of options than any other restaurant participating in SF restaurant week, and all of the options sounded so, so appetizing that we were both having a hard time picking. I settled for the following \nCourse 1: Arugula salad- Came with oranges and a delicious, but subtle lemon dressing. \nCourse 2: Salmon Carpaccio - Garnished with cucumbers and came with cripsy crostinis. I kinda wished I went for the Tuna, but it was fresh, regardless. \nCourse 3: Grilled scallops with mashed potato - Cooked to perfection, a little juice, a little chewy, and melts in your mouth all at the same time. Highly recommend this dish. \nCourse 4: Vanilla bean creme brulee - Do I even need to say anything here?\nNote: I also ordered 6 oysters ($1 each Mon-Thursday), and foie gras ($27 in addition to the $40 fixed menu). The oysters were a little too large for my liking, I like my oysters itty bitty, but the foie gras was oh-so-delicious. \n\nFinal thoughts - Do yourself a favor, and give this place a try. The restaurant is a hole in the wall spot, so it feels very cozy. The interior decor is very romantic and intimate. It's perfect for date night or just a girls night out! Can't wait to go back and stuff my face with the chef's delicious creations! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could!", "author": "Niki J."}

Food was really delicious and service was great! Total dine time was about 2 hours.\n\nComplimentary unlimited(?) bread to start.\n\nFIRST COURSE\n- Potato Leek Soup: Light but flavorful. Really great.\n- Arugula Salad: Good light salad with citrus tones. My boyfriend's favorite out of all the dishes.\n\nSECOND COURSE\n- Yellowfin Tuna: Great! I thought this dish was well done, probably my favorite. The tuna is prepared raw. Felt like I was almost eating at a nice sushi place :)\n- Salmon Carpaccio: I didn't try too much of this - I was told it tasted \"okay.\" But the salmon was a nice thin cut.\n\nTHIRD COURSE\n- Duck Breast: Wasn't sure what to expect but the meat was quite juicy and tender. Enjoyed this one!\n- Angus Flat Iron Steak: Rare was pretty much blue rare - way too chewy and undercooked for my tasting. I thought it was just okay.\n\nFOURTH COURSE\n- Semifreddo All'amaretto: Yummy almondy goodness! Served with two mini almond cookies.\n- Grapefruit Granite: Tasted bitter but exactly like how a grapefruit does. I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but it was refreshing. It's basically shaved ice.\n\nOverall a good dining experience!", "author": "Scott C."}

At $29.95, you're crying at how ridiculously affordable this fine dining experience costs you.  \n\nCourse 1/\nBaked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese. Warm and oozing goat cheese fused with pine nut nuttiness. You get sweet and savory in one melting bite. Simple and delicious.\n\nCourse 2/\nTruffle risotto. Though there were a lot of mushrooms, the heavy hand in reggiano overpowered the lovely earthiness that was intrinsic to this dish. Had I not devoured the goat cheese dish moments before, I probably would have enjoyed this dish more. Unfortunately, I was cheesed out by this point.\n\nCourse 3/\nGrapefruit granite. Refreshing and tart.  \nSemifreddo all'amaretto. Tastes just like the almond oil/extract one buys from the grocery store to bake with. Nothing special.\n\nOverall, Isa is a phenomenal choice if you want fine dining on a budget. All their dishes are meant to be shared family style so if you come with a crowd, the tastings are limitless. Their appetizers are simple but solid; I took a sip of my friend's potato and leek soup and it was savory good\uff0dthe kind that'll cure your sickness good.

We had two young children with us and we waited more than an hour and a half for our food even though the restaurant was only half full. \n\nI was so confused by this, when I lived in the Marina my husband and I used to frequent this place, and service was at the top of their list. So for years, we've been a huge fan.

The bread they served was cold, which is another bizarre thing, typically this is great here. \n\nThen when asked about our order, everyone seemed nonchalant and didn't care. It took me to stand up and walk towards the front to ask about the delay. \n\nWhile the food was still good, (except for the overly peppered steak) the service left such a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nI'm sad this happened, it's like a break up with an old friend.", "author": "michelle z."}

I truly believe this place deserves to be on that Eater list of great deals for SF Restaurant Week due to the sheer number of choices! \n\nIf you take a look at their menu, they break it down into 4 courses instead of the traditional 3, and all for $40. And to make things better, the second course is family-style, meaning we can all share the dishes amongst ourselves! Oh, and for an extra $25, you can try their foie gras! \n\nAnyway, on to the menu items we tried:\n\nFirst Course: Smooth Potato Leek Soup, Butter Lettuce Salad, Arugula Salad.\n\nSecond Course: Organic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio, Yellowfin tuna, steamed Prince Edward Island mussels, and Baked Laura Chenel goat cheese.\n\nIntermission: Seared foie gras.\n\nThird Course: At this point, our group of 4 went our separate ways, so I can only speak for the Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak. \n\nDessert: Semifreddo all'amaretto\n\nFrom the first course, the dish that stood out definitely had to be the potato leek. Even though I was the only one who ordered this, the flavoring was simply on point, with a nice creamy consistency and balanced flavoring.\n\nEvery single dish offered in the second course was satisfactory, but my personal favorite had to be the goat cheese. I know people will be turned off by the strong flavor of it, but it actually appealed well to my tastes. The salmon and tuna were alright, and the mussels were too small (or in some cases, nonexistent)\n\nFoie gras melted in my mouth upon first contact, and considering it was my first time trying it, I liked that feeling!  The angus flat iron steak were nice but didn't stand out too much. \n\nFinally, the semifreddo (which had the consistency of ice cream, not gelato as the waiter mentioned), was DELICIOUS. I tasted amaretto and almonds the whole time, and the little cookie pastries also complimented the dessert well.", "author": "Viet N."}

There were 6 in our party and we ordered the mussels, tartare, shrimp, seared sea bass, jambalaya, calamari, crab salad and steak. As you know, French food is known for their small portions, but the portions were surprisingly decent. In fact, we shared most of the dishes and left feeling really satisfied. We thoroughly enjoyed all the food, but a couple really hit the spot.\n\nPrince Edward Island Mussels - It was cooked to perfection and the broth was lick-the-bowl good! We literally scooped the broth with the delicious baguette they serve until the last drop. \n\nTartare - This dish was a surprise! It was so tasty and fresh.

(Doesn't matter, because SFRW has gone way downhill.) Not only did they offer four courses, but their dishes actually had variety and were worth trying, unlike many of the other contenders churning out a cookie cutter 3-course menu of soup or salad, boring entree, and brownie dessert. The portions were a good size, just a touch smaller than their usual portions. I'll include the current prices.\nWe were seated in the covered patio area behind the restaurant, which was probably a backyard in the past. Even though it was cold outside, the heating lamps and covered awning provided enough warmth and shelter. It felt cozy and inviting.\n\n$10 Maine Lobster Broth w/ prawns, tomato, celery & tarragon:\nHot & savory bowl that warmed me up from the first taste. There were just a couple pieces of lobster & prawn, but they were good-sized chunks. The broth was smooth and satisfying.\n\n$15 Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori & *low sodium soy:\nCubes of tuna served tartare style over creamy chunks of avocado, with seaweed salad. It was very good, but I wouldn't normally order this at a French restaurant.\n\n$16 Dungeness Crab Salad w/ avocado, apples, grapefruit & tarragon:\nThe shredded crab was not too shredded and the pieces were still substantial enough to be satisfying. The avocado, apple slices, and grapefruit each added variations in texture, and some tart and sweet flavors to the mix.\n\n$24 Seared Scallops w/ mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon & truffle sauce:\nScallops were seared just right with a browned surface, but still had a meaty and springy texture. Brussel sprouts were roasted to a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were so good with the savory sauce.\n\n$23 Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:\nThe slices of flat iron were juicy and tender. The sauce on top was like a chimichurri, good flavor, but could have used more of it.\n\n$7 Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: \nCreme brulee isn't my favorite dessert. I still do enjoy taking a spoon and giving the torched caramelized crust a whack and seeing the broken window effect. Surprisingly it didn't break, as it was a rather thick crust. The custard underneath was nice and smooth.\n\n$7 Semifreddo all' Amaretto:\nI didn't know what to make of this semifreddo. I've had semifreddos before, but this seemed like half ice cream and half frozen bread. At least that was the texture that came to my mind. The almond cookies were good. I don't care for presentation or garnishes, but in this case, the sprig of mint was much needed to make this dish look good.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably would enjoy the grapefruit granite. I wonder why I never tried it. \n\nThe chef has quite an impressive resume. I can see how he's going for a Californian Provencal menu, but most of the dishes seem more Californian to me.\nWould I eat here again? Since I've tried the above dishes, there's not much on the prix fix menu that intrigues me, except maybe the salmon carpaccio or the truffle risotto. I am interested in trying the foie gras though. If I were in the area, I would definitely stop by on a sunny day to relax in their patio area again for happy hour.", "author": "Joy W."}

They're one of the very few restaurants offering a prix-fixe four-course menu for RW dinner for $40. \n\nINTERIOR\nThis place is super cozy for dinner, especially on rainy evenings. There were lots of people waiting in the front to be seated, but luckily I made a reservation. The hated patio seating is absolutely amazing and ask to be seated there if you can! There's plenty of heat lamps and wonderfully decorated string lights that really ups the ambiance more so than the other sections of the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE\nExcellent service! Our waiter was super friendly and smiley. Even though he was serving many tables that night, he was very patient with taking our orders and listening to our requests. The staff was very courteous overall. At the end of the meal, they gave us a sealed envelope with a surprise coupon inside, only to be opened by the staff when you visit next time. Very enticing! \n\nFOOD\nI really liked that the food was meant for sharing, and the servers would bring the plates to the middle of the table instead to each of us. We never had to wait too long between courses, but there were some discrepancies when one of us got a course way before another, so it just felt like a continuous stream of plates being served. \n\nFirst Course\nArugula salad: Pretty delicious, standard salad. The dressing on these salads are usually very flavorful, and they never dump an obscene amount of dressing on it. \nSmooth potato leek soup: This dish was really good, and I preferred this over the salad. The soup is very, very umami flavored which is great. Wonderful to dip bread in! \n\nSecond Course\nBaked Goat Cheese: This one took a while to come out because baking takes a while, but I recommend this for people who love goat cheese (and pizza!) It tasted more like a pizza without the crust, so I naturally used the bread that came with the meal as a dipping tool. \nYellowfin Tuna: My boyfriend ordered this and said it was comparable for the price point with an almost identical Yellowfin Tuna dish from Jean-Georges. Even though he's not a big fan of seafood, he thought it was prepared very well.\n\nThird Course \nTruffle Risotto: yummm mushroom overload! Although, compared to other same-tier restaurants I've been to for RW, the truffle flavor wasn't as flavorful as others. Still very delicious though.\nAngus flat iron steak: The waiter recommended medium-rare which is what my bf got, but he thinks it would have been overall if it was just cooked medium. This is more of a preference thing though.\n\nFourth Course\nGrapefruit Granite: This was a very tarty grapefruit shaved ice, and while it was good, it didn't wow me since shaved ice can only impress so much. Our waiter recommended that we eat this dessert first since the flavor is much stronger than the other. \nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This dessert was fantastic! The flavors are not overwhelmingly sweet like I expected it to be, and all the flavors worked so well together that it felt like a light ice cream cake. I've actually never had semifreddo before and omg I can eat this forever.\n\nOVERALL\nFantastic experience, service, ambiance.

Friend told the waiter that she is highly allergic to tomatoes and he promised to make the appetizer without tomatoes.  Luckily she looked carefully before eating and saw the tomato pieces.  At that point, it had taken so long for the app I asked how long until the entrees because we may just skip the app. The reply- oh that will take a lot longer but you should be happy because on weekends it's much much worse.\n\nThey also kept pushing that we should order an app and dinner (menu states that too).  These were not small portions and it was mentioned so many times that I started to wonder if wait staff makes commission.  \n\nThese are just a few comments on a fully bad service experience. \n\nIt's a neighborhood staple but I'm not sure I'd return seeing that their service has gone down so much.  The food was the saving grace of the night as it was all tasty.", "author": "Karen B."}

There is a 3 course prix fixe Monday-Friday for $30.  Excellent value.  They also have happy hour cocktails for $5, even on the weekend.  The vodka is from Japan, only 40 proof.\n\nThe arugula salad was very fresh and a great start to the meal.  Next, I had the raw yellowfin tuna on a bed of avocado.  A very good take on a popular appetizer. Others had the mussels or salmon carpaccio.  I liked the mussels better than the salmon.  \n\nThree people had the scallops and Brussels sprouts.  At the price for four courses, I knew there would not be a large serving of scallops. There were 4 nicely browned scallops on each plate with Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes filling the plate.  \n\nThe duck breast (medium rare) was excellent.  It was served with spinach and\nPotatoes.  I would definitely order the duck again\n\nTwo of us had Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and two had the grapefruit granita. Both were excellent.\n\nA very nice meal.  The servers kept encouraging us to share and eat whichever dish came out first.  This is good advice since there was often a long wait for the four dishes (for 4 people) of each course.  It didn't work so well for us because we did not order enough different things.  That's probably the biggest weakness\n\nA very good value for fresh, well prepared dishes.", "author": "Joanna S."}

They tried forcing us to order 2 entrees per person and claimed it was a way to share. They made it seem that you weren't allowed to do it any other way. The waiter was so damn pushy it was unnerving. He clearly was attempting to rip us off. \n\nHere's the kicker, at the end of the meal, which I should note was very good, he pushed a FOIE GRAS sale on us! Saying we should come back and get a bunch of foie gras at cost. I'm surprised he didn't try to sell me a motorcycle or a timeshare in Boca. \n\nIf we were on one of those hidden camera shows than bravo, you guys did a great job in confusing the hell out of us and attempting to rip us off.

It's really an amazing deal for a nice atmosphere and delicious food. Could not recommend it more especially if you want to feel like you're fine dining but not pay the price. Service was super attentive and friendly.\n\nEvery dish that comes out is meant to be shared. If you each order the 3 course dinner can take a long time but it was very enjoyable. Free tasty bread and butter that they refilled for us. We got the salmon carpaccio and mussels for appetizers. The salmon was raw and fresh. The mussels came with a large serving size and had flavorful sauce for dipping your bread. I would recommend both.\n\nFor the main dish we got the truffle risotto and steak. The truffle risotto with mushrooms was the most memorable dish of the night. AMAZING! I don't even like mushrooms but it was such a flavorful creamy risotto. Definitely try this! The steak was good but nothing special. I like the zucchini slices served with it and I didn't like the potatoes since it was very salty.\n\nAt this point we were already very full but for dessert we got the grapefruit ice and goat cheese. The ice was super refreshing and the goat cheese very creamy (the waiter's favorite). Overall wonderful experience and deal! I've been recommending this place to many friends!", "author": "Linda X."}

Our waiter Domingo was a delight. The place was really pretty with string lights. Our table was a bit cramped though.\n\nTo start, we had a bottle of Riesling. Domingo came and poured us each a glass. Tasty, me likey. We were given a basket of bread and butter. YUM. For appetizers, we had Grilled Calamari and Foie Gras. I never had Foie Gras before and OMG it is DELICIOUS. Mouth watering as I type this. I was informed that it was a little bit under which gave it a soft texture. The taste and texture reminded me of pork belly. I think it came with a side of cranberry sauce, regardless it went well with the foie gras. The custard brioche was delicious too. The calamari was good. It was grilled to perfection and the flavors went well together.\n\nFor entrees, Domingo said it was a sharable size so we decided to share what we all thought was good. We had the Seared Scallops, Spaghetti, Potato wrapped Seabass, Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast, and the Grilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak.\n   -The Scallops were a little undercooked. It wasn't that great IMO. The orzo below it was tasty so it sort of made up for the scallops. \n   -The Spaghetti was a little underwhelming. I wasn't really expecting much but for $20, it should have been a bomb ass spaghetti and it wasn't. It honestly could have used a bit more sauce. It was cooked al dente though.\n   -The Seabass had the better flavor of all the entrees. Although it was a little overcooked, I enjoyed the flavor of everything together. The potato on the outside sort of gave it a salty flavor which went well with the sauce. Definitely a good dish to order.\n   -The Duck breast was also a winner. It was a little chewy but good flavoring. I loved the potatoes on the side.\n   -Lastly the steak. Steak was cooked to a good medium. It was juicy. The green beans were salty. And I wasn't too big of a fan for the polenta (not a polenta fan to begin with anyways).\n\nAll in all, I had a really positive first French experience. Service was excellent as was the food. Everything tasted great especially the foie gras. They also don't auto charge tip for large parties as they believe that tip is up to the customer. No cake cutting fee either. Will definitely come back for special occasions! Oh and Thursdays they have $15 Foie Gras. YESSSS.", "author": "Benita M."}

Not a snooty place, which I like. Staff wise that is. \n\nOnly complaint: the customers. \nThe quarter is a little tight and I'm not sure if it's the marina clientele or what, but had a run in with kinda arrogant customers next to us. The tables are tight and one of the lady at the table next to us walks up to the chairs between the two tables and expect my mother to move out of the way for her to pass, no excuse me please. No nothing. Just stood there with the \"why are you not moving bitch face\". Not to mention. Her boyfriend or husband or her own girlfriend's man is sitting in the other chair in her way. Why did he not  hmm want to move for her? He kept talking, not even expecting he would have to move. And it's not once, but twice both there and back. We got annoyed. More because some implicit expectation we should move for her even though both party (one that's her own) is in her way. If she just said please and thank you. People are more than happy to help her. But man, where are the manners marina crowd? Get off your high horse. Get some schooling on how to be a more courteous person. No one is here to wait on you. Don't act like a fucking princess.

We mentioned we were celebrating my cousin's birthday.   After ordering the waiter asked me if he could bring out a dessert with a candle to which I responded of course.   Once we finished the our appetizers and main course the waiter immediately brought out a dessert for my cousin with a candle.   She actually ordered a prefix so a dessert was included with her meal.   The waiter then asked my parents what they would like.  They debating between a chocolate cake (for an uncharge) and ice-cream.  They both decided ice-cream.   Shortly later the busboy brought them their ice-cream and then also brought another chocolate cake.   We sent back the chocolate cake as we didn't order it.   A few minutes later he came back and said the cake came with my cousins as part of her prefix dinner.   We explained she didn't order it but he left it anyway.   To make a long story short when the bill came we were charged $8.50 for one of the chocolate cakes and a $4 uncharge for another chocolate cake.   When I discussed the matter with the waiter (just out of principal) he said I authorized him to order a desert for my cousin at the beginning of the evening and that we also ordered an additional cake.   I told him her dinner should have come with a dessert and she wasn't even given a choice, and that we never ordered an additional dessert.   He argued with me that although we sent back the dessert that ultimately we \"fully consumed\" the dessert and thus we need to pay for it.   I asked him to do what was right since we did not order it, we sent it back, and we never ordered my cousins \"uncharge\" dessert.  Ultimately he offered to take $4 off the bill.   I asked for a manager and was told they left for the evening already (7pm).

My friend had her rehearsal dinner here and we had a fairly large party of 16ish people.  The table was already set with pre-printed menus.  I sat next to the groom and he was constantly being updated and consulted about which wines to serve and whether to open another bottle, etc. etc.  There were constantly people coming in to check on us.  Water glasses were never empty, and food came out at a pretty reasonable pace.  I personally didn't find the food necessarily remarkable, but then again I didn't really get to choose what was on the menu (they had ordered shareable mini portions for the entire table).  It was good in that we were able to try a lot of different items.  The restaurant itself has a large patio / garden area which was where we sat, but walking through the restaurant, it looked like the interior was very cute and very intimate.  I really liked the space.  The service was very friendly and I'd recommend this place if you were looking to wine and dine a group of people because they made it seem very effortless!  :)", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Went to Yelp, found Isa, reserved a table and headed over. It was pretty packed and cramped. There is an attempt to make the place seem romantic but the tight quarters and high-decibels make that a losing battle. I was hoping for a better wine list but it was reasonably priced. The best glass I had was a \"mystery wine\" thing that meant you got a discount for finishing up last of a bottle. It was super cheap and very nice. Service was attentive and friendly and the food was pretty good and my wife and I both had the same impression: If Isa was in most other cities, it would be remarkable but in SF, there are so many great options for what they charge, we doubt there is reason to return.", "author": "Brian B."}

Yasss. I ordered the Greyhound Soju cocktail which was pretty sweeth and yummy and had just enough to kick. Since it was Restaurant week we had a prix fix menu. There were 3 of us so we got to try pretty much everything!\n\nStarters:\nPotato and leek soup - I really enjoyed this soup. It had a very down home feel to it and it was nice to dip our bread into. I can't say that I would order this on a normal day but it was definitely tasty.\n\nArugula salad: I'm usually not a fan of arugula. I guess I like more hardy salads. However, the salad had a great taste to it and the dressing was very nice.\n\nButter lettuce salad: Definitely my favorite! The salad was bustling with flavor from the apples, bleu cheese and walnuts. The dressing was quite nice as well. I would definitely order this again.\n\nSecond course: \nAhi tuna: This was another one of my favorites. The tuna was super soft and almost buttery, it tasted very nice and fresh. The plate was presented very nicely. In every scoop I was able to get some tuna, seaweed salad and avocado. Definitely must order this dish!\n\nSalmon carpaccio: This was also very tasty. It didn't stand out as much as the tuna but nonetheless was a great dish.\n\nMussels: The mussels were very tasty. I did wish that the broth was a lot warmer (temperature wise) But other than that it had great flavor and was a great size to share.\n\nFinal course:\n\nChicken and mashed potatoes: This was my choice and I was not let down. The chicken was nice and moist and had a great, light sauce on top. The mashed potatoes were my favorite! They were creamy and the perfect consistency. I'm talking like grandma's thanksgiving mashed potatoes caliber!\n\nLamb: I'm not a huge fan of lamb and the dish had olives which i'm also not very keen of. Also, the lamb tasted a little tough. \n\nDuck: The duck was very yummy. It wasn't too fatty tasting and it laid on top of a very tasty sauce. I would definitely order it again.\n\nDessert:\n\nI'm not big on desserts. However, I loved the grapefruit shaved ice thing! (I think it had a fancier name than that) it was nice and tangy and very refreshing for my palate after our hearty meal. My friends were pretty obsessed with the ice cream as well.\n\nAll in all, great restaurant! The service is good. I did notice that sometimes the servers were a little too eager to take your plate. I will definitely be coming back!\n\nI read on the menu that they do a Prix-Fix menu every week so I would definitely recommend coming and doing that with people to share. It's a great amount of food and it's nice to be able to try everything. Definitely worth it!", "author": "Jessica B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-24", "description": "As California chefs rejoiced earlier this year after the overturning of the foie gras ban, I was ecstatic for the fact that I could finally try this fine delicacy for the first time. Rich, velvety, and buttery, charred on the outside with melt-in-your-mouth creaminess inside, Isa's Hudson Valley grade A foie gras was a delicious treat. The accompanying toasted brioche was soft and fluffy, a perfect base for the fatty liver. The pairing with sweet, mild fruit (in Isa's case, poached pear and huckleberries) also helped balance the foie gras richness.\n\nAside from Isa's foie gras, other items on their menu didn't leave me in awe. The Dungeness crab salad was very light, therefore allowing the true freshness of the crab to shine through, but the salad overall wasn't outstanding. The tuna tartar was very fresh and had a nice kick from the spicy sriracha. But I felt the dish could've used some crackers or crisps as a base. The potato wrapped sea bass was very small for an entree. The fish was very mild, yet the tomato and caper flavors were just too strong and thus hindered the milder delicate fish flavor.\n\nService at Isa was very friendly and accommodating. The front part of the restaurant, which includes the bar, is rather small. But at the rear outdoor heated and covered patio makes Isa's dining experience more intimate and welcoming. For a balanced dining experience, Isa offers a pre-fixe 3-course meal Sunday through Thursday for only $30, which is an excellent deal given their use of fresh, quality ingredients.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Our dinning experience actually had a rocky start because they somehow lost our order so we didn't get out food for an hour. I didn't even notice the time, however, because they kept refilling our bowl with delicious bread and softened butter (it's a pet peeve of mine when the butter isn't soften.) Finally, I had to ask the waitress where our food was and they realized that our order got lost (I seem to be having bad luck recently.) The manager came out and was extremely apologetic and suddenly all of our dishes came pouring out. The manager kept apologizing and comped us moscato which was delicious. \n\nThe food was well worth the wait. Among the 3 of us, we ordered 13 dishes - including foie gras. The dishes were EXTREMELY fresh. The cheese with the salads had a nice smoky hint to them and were generously placed on. The beets were very sweet and paired nicely with the arugula. While the mussels were on the smaller side, they were very fresh and sweet. They didn't need a lot of sauce because the quality of the mussels were already great. The scallop was cooked to perfection and not chewy or overdone at all. The duck was tender and the huckleberry sauce paired nicely with it. Generally you could taste each ingredient and all the dishes were balanced perfectly. The aged goat cheese came with the most delicious honey and candied walnuts. Everything was so pleasant.\n\nThe foie gras was amazing. Normally I don't like foie gras because it comes with just toast and taste like globs of fat. However, at isa they served it with a fruit compote and the sweetness balanced the foie gras very well. Rather than tasting like globs of fat, it taste like fruit smokey butteriness with a wonderful bold taste of duck. It was amazing. \n\nI would definitely come back to isa again and recommend it to a friend!", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

Reminds me of my favorite Gorgonzola and pear salad.\nArugula Salad: Nice and refreshing for the summer time with the fruit pieces.\n\nSecond course:\nOrganic Loch Duart: Delicious and refreshing. I think they used smoke salmon for this plate.\nYellowfin tuna: Taste like your typical tuna tartare stacked.\nSteamed PEI mussels: Its really hard not to mess up on this dish but loved every single bite. The restaurant gives out sourdough bread so ask for extra to dip the sauce!\nBaked goat cheese: One of my favorite plates here. Super smooth and creamy.\n \nThird coourse:\nSeared scallops: Fresh, firm scallops. Sweet and simple herbs to enhance the scallop flavors.\nFlat iron steak: Medium rare as always. Tender but its a bit dry. Thank goodness for the wine reduction for dip\nLamb tenders: One of my least favorite as the lamb has a slight odor to it. Not very fresh in my opinion. Very chewy. \n\nWe had a side order of foie gras: My first taste, just as I suspected from my research.

Turned out they have a walk-in table. The table was all the way at a corner far from all the other tables so you kind of have you own little nook which was nice since I was here with my bf on Valentine's Day. Although we were secluded, the waiters did not fail to come back frequently to refill our water and bread, and to see if we needed anything - in short, the service was superb!\n\nThe Valentine's menu was a 4 course prix fix menu that came with a glass of champagne. The menu was designed to be shared (each person got to picked 4 courses).\n\nHere's what we got: \n1. Tomales Bay Pt Reyes oyster - it came with a spicy orange mmigonette sauce that was delicious. It's a good change from using the typical Tabasco and cocktail sauce. \n\n2. Maine lobster broth - it came with a few pieces of prawns that were cooked perfectly, but no lobster meat. The broth was perfect for dipping their toasted bread in.  \n\n3. Yellowfish tuna - this dish was good, but nothing about it really stood out. It was yellowfish tuna sashimi that I can get at any Japanese restaurant. \n\n4. Sauteed Prawns - it was cooked perfectly. There's that nice crunch when I bite into it and the sauce complimented the prawns really well. \n\n5. Potato wrapped Sea bass - this was a very pretty looking dish. but sadly to say it was my least favorite dish. The sea bass wasn't buttery like I expected. It was kind of dry. \n\n6. Roasted rack of lamb - it came with 4 lamb chops cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was seasoned really well, and the meat was tender. It was delicious! \n\n7. Creme Brulee - the creme brulee was very creamy and not overly sweet. \n\n8. Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato - this took about 15 minutes because they had to bake it. It was good but I liked the creme brulee more.", "author": "Michelle T."}

She decided on trying out this restaurant because of their pre-fixed menu. BEST CHOICE EVER!\n\nLOCATION: If you are tired of circling around the blocks in the Marina for a free parking spot, there is a garage just a block over from this restaurant. I paid around $8 for about 2.5 hours.\n\nMOOD: We were seated in the nicely decorated alley of sorts towards the back of the restaurant. There was holiday decor all around so it set a great mood for the dinner.\n\nMENU: The group (approximately 11 people) decided to order from the Pre-Fixed Sunday menu. I ordered the salmon carpaccio, truffle risotto, and the almond gelato. The entire meal was delicious! This was the best meal I've had in quite a while. Everyone around the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well. \n\nSERVICE: We were served by a charismatic, funny, and happy Asian gentleman who explained the menu and the meals with such great detail and character. He definitely made the experience greater than 5 stars.\n \nPRICE: The pre-fixed Sunday menu was an amazing deal! Roughly around $30, but I paid slightly more due to gratuity and for helping pay my best friend's meal.

There was also a 20+ minute gap between finishing our entrees and dessert being served. All in all, our meal took a full three hours. Not because we were moving at a slow pace and enjoying ourselves. Because we were waiting. Constantly. All in all, I would really hesitate to go back, but I would really not hesitate to order that truffle spaghetti to go.", "author": "Gianna M."}

I cannot stress how amazing it was and how friendly our server was.  To top it all off, instead of 3 courses, we got 4 (and the portions were very generous)!  It also had a lovely ambience.\n\nOur server (I really wish I remembered his name) was extremely helpful with giving us a rundown of the wine list, as well as the menu.  Unlike other restaurants, the options were plentiful for each of the 4 courses.  For wine, we ended up getting a bottle of Cederberg which was delicious.  As for the food, I ended up taking the restaurant up on the $1 oyster special.  Because there were 5 of us, there wasn't too much overlap in our orders so was able to try a lot of the different dishes out.  My favorites have to be the yellowfin tuna and the salmon carpaccio.  The seared scallops were very yummy as well.  By the time the short ribs were served, I was so stuffed but I couldn't stop eating.  The meat was so tender that it fell right off the bones.\n\nI'm pretty sure I still dream about this meal and wish that it were closer.  But definitely will be a must-stop spot if I ever find myself back in SF!", "author": "Michele Q."}

Yellow Tuna was like sushi with no rice, Lamb chop was stir fry veggies with lamb. All cooked and seasoned normally like you would at home. \n\nThe service though...like a Vietnamese restaurant. The older Asian server is very talkative like a friendly Asian owner. The hostess is like the unhappy daughter that was forced to work here on a Sunday. The Mexican server just throw everything on the table as soon as he could like a recently promoted busboy. Overall slow and inattentive, we almost had to walk out to the cashier to pay the bill just like in Vietnamese restaurant. Place is half empty.", "author": "SP Y."}

Boy, were the waiters overwhelmed - hustling and bustling between the kitchen and waiting on the tables!  It was as if they wanted you in and quickly out, so they can accommodate the busy New Year's Eve dining peak time.\n\nThere was a special 4 course meal dinner for New Year's Eve.  Ideally, it is a 3 course dining affair.  There were choices on soup/salad, starters, main and desserts.  You get to pick one from each category per person.\n\nThe presentation of each dish, needs improvement.  It looked like it was just poured or slapped onto the platter, without much careful attention to the finishing or garnishing.\n\nWhat we ordered up:\n\nMaine Lobster Broth - the taste of the lobster was there and it was frothy.\n\nPotato and Leek Soup - I preferred this one over the lobster.  The leek contributed to a nice soup flavor that you just can't quite find anywhere else.\n\nSteamed Mussels - Cooked in white wine and garlic, their mussels were not only delicious, but also very fresh and full.  I have never eaten mussels that were still very full, within its own shell!  Loved this dish.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Wild Prawns - I liked the garlic and lemon sauce.  The prawns were cooked on point.  The presentation was lacking and this starter lacked a bit of spazz to make it above the norm.\n\nGrilled Scallop and Brussels Sprouts - Another well made dish, but lacked decoration!  The scallops were grilled to perfection and brussel sprouts were cooked with a rich brown color!\n\nBraised Shortribs with Broccolini - Nice and tender Shortribs with well steamed Broccolini!  Presentation again, however, was lacking.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a complimenting dessert for the meal. Their Truffled Cheese, was too strong to be taken lightly as a dessert.\n\nI do like the semi-outdoor patio in the back.  It was nice to enjoy.

My family and I had each got a 4 course prix fix for $40... (Thank you restaurant week!!!) \n   Course 1: Potato and Leek Soup\nLoved the creaminess, and the truffle taste. The only let down was the 5 tiny pieces of bacon in the soup. :-( 4/5\n   Course 2: Yellowfin Tuna Tartare \nIt's great to look at, but not to eat... The sauce made everything on the dish very, very salty. I'll just say that I reached for my water multiple times. 3.5/5\n   Course 3: Angus Flat Iron Steak\nThe steak was perfectly rare and tender, but it did not have any flavor. All of the flavor came from the red wine sauce, or the mustard sauce on top. The potatoes and zucchini were delicious! 4/5\n    Course 4: Grapefruit Granite\nYum, yum, yum! I loved the grapefruit flavor, but I did not like the bitter aftertaste. I know that grapefruits are naturally bitter, but it's just my opinion... Eating the granite with the mint garnish takes away a little bit of the bitterness. 4.5/5\n   Thank you Isa, for a lovely night!", "author": "Lauren L."}

For $40, you get a 4 course meal while most other restaurants only offered a measly 3 course meal. I've also returned on a Sunday which they have 3 course meals for $30 (Sunday-Thursday) which is  a great deal and opportunity to try different dishes. There is also happy hour until 7pm every day of the week (wine glasses and soju cocktails for $5).\n\nI really enjoyed the arugula salad, salmon carpaccio and the chenel goat cheese. You must try the goat cheese! Feel free to ask for extra bread to dip into the cheese and tomato concasse. It's so good!\n\nAs for the entrees, I've tried the truffle risotto, seared scallops, seasonal fish and flat iron steak. The truffle risotto is very rich, decadent and delicious. It is perfect for the vegetarians out there. The scallops are so perfectly buttered, well portioned and seared to perfection.  The steak was perfectly pink and served with a blue cheese topping. I thought it was a unique combination and should only be ordered if you like the taste of blue cheese. \n\nThe service here is impeccable. They really go out of their way to make you feel at home and make great recommendations. The restaurant has a bar, indoor seating and a very well decorated covered patio. This spot is perfect for a classy night out on the town. One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco!", "author": "Hanhie D."}

There are days when I am sad cause I just blew nearly $100 on a meal here or I am happy because I just spent $100 on a meal here and loved every bite! One of my favorite things at Isa is the lobster broth. Simple, warm, yet so addicting. It comes with pieces of shrimp and tons of lobster flavor. No, there is no actual lobster meat in the soup but if there was, I think it would be incredible! Other highlights include the mussels which are so addicting that I would ask for extra bread to soak up the garlic-butter-wine sauce that accompanies it. Truffle spaghetti, seared duck breast are just some of my other favorites.\n\nThe truffle spaghetti is so simple but knocks it out of the ballpark with the intense truffle flavor. I wish the spaghetti came with some kind of meat but that's fine. Carb heaven I tell yah! Staff is extremely nice and they will take care of you, trust me.

The restaurant is very warm and inviting. The interior has a very rustic feel to it. A special highlight of this restaurant is their outdoor patio seating behind the half-opened kitchen. The patio seating is more like a large cabana tent held up by wooden beams that are lined with flowers, vines and small dangling white lights. We made reservations for 8:30pm but I realized I forgot to request their outdoor seating so I asked and was accommodated right away. \n\nService: Our server looked like an ex-con and to be honest, I was a bit intimidated until he opened his mouth and he was just the sweetest, most hilarious man serving me cocktails that night. Our food took awhile to get to us and since we were very hungry, we took two rounds of breadbasket. Those who keep up with my reviews know that carbs are my mortal enemy.\n\nFood: I got the duck-- cooked to a medium pink, meat was very tender and juicy with crispy skin; the portion was a little small but expected. As an avid instagrammer, this dish is very picture worthy. I love the colors complementing each other. The boy got the veal-- it was tender and juicy but the meat itself tasted a little bland. You know how sometimes you expect a standard taste to a dish...well I expected the dish to be a cut of veal but it turned out to be something very similar to a Chinese stir-fry. The sauce was overpowering flavorful, strong truffle and garlic notes, and I felt like I was eating the sauce...couldn't really taste the veal. I think the lamb and the foie gras would be better alternatives, next time! \n\nImpression: I loved how the patio temperature resembled a nice warm summer night.  It has a countryside France feel to it. However, I was a little disappointed by the food. The wait time for our food took an extremely long time, maybe I was hungry but it took well over thirty minutes. Our food also arrived at two separate times, which made dining together slightly inconvenient and uncomfortable with more waiting involved. I would recommend this restaurant for friends and couples that have not yet tried this place. I wouldn't recommend this place as a first date as it can be very noisey and at times it can even be hard to hear across the table. \n\n\n\n(12)", "author": "Nadeen H."}

The restaurant seems so tiny when you walk in, until you are guided to the back past the kitchens to a fairly large patio area. \n\nOur server, Jonathan, was a pleasure from beginning to end. He was an absolute delight, and made our experience that much better. He told us that this is a family sharing type of restaurant, so my friend and I opted for different choices so we could share. The food also comes out as it is ready, not in any particular order. We also made it in time for their happy hour drinks, so we had 2 glasses each of a sparkling wine from Spain. Very good and only $5 or $7 a pop!\n\nWe munched on some of their yummy bread, and our dungeness crab salad and our yellowfin tuna appetizer came out next. Lots of crab on the salad, and it was pretty good, but wish it had more flavor to the dressing. The fruits were a nice touch. The tuna app was pretty standard, and loved the avocado that went with it. Then our Maine lobster broth came out. This was by far a standout. Perfectly cooked with a huge tiger prawn. Very light but super flavorful. Then came our dozen Tomales Bays Pt. Reyes oysters. Yum! I could've eaten these all day, and they were only $1 an oyster! Such a steal!\n\nFor the entrees, I decided on the truffle mushroom risotto my friends had raved about. My friend with with the pan roasted rocky jr. chicken. Hers came out first, and I'm not a huge chicken person, but my goodness. This chicken was perfectly cooked, so juicy and tender, and they put the seasoning of herbs under the skin. WOW. So much flavor, and with the fluffy mashed potatoes and string beans, I was in heaven! The risotto came out next, and it was pretty darn amazing. A little on the heavy side, but enjoyed as much as I could since I was so full after the oysters! I would say the chicken was the winner to me since I was not expecting to have that wow factor from it.\n\nLastly, our desserts came out, and the only one that sounded appetizing to us was the semifreddo all amaretto, after Jonathan described it. It was almost like an almond cookie ice cream, not super cold, and had more of a substance of almond cookie mash. It was really good, and the manager brought me a glass of port for my bday. \n\nAll in all, a great experience. Would definitley recommend this place to others, and they do a 3 course prix-fixe menu Sunday - Thursday for a really reasonable price.

We decided to eat here around 6:30pm on Thursday, and I used open table to make an 8pm reservation the same day. We arrived there around 7:40pm, and although we were early for our reservation, they were able to seat us quickly!\n\nSo I ordered the lobster bisque, mussels, seared scallops and creme brulee. My friend ordered the lobster bisque, crab salad, short ribs (not printed on the menu but it is included in the dine about town menu), and some ice cream dessert I don't recall. \n\nThey served us bread prior to the meal. I like bread chewier than crunchier. The inside was chewy but the outside was crispy. The bread is good to save for the lobster bisque or mussels. \n\nI really like the lobster bisque. The lobster flavor was distinct, and very flavorful. It was a strong, delicious aroma. They had two pieces of shrimp in there as well.\n\nI like the crab salad as well except there were random bites of bitter taste. I think it's from the herb, so don't eat that. Other than that, I like it a lot. \n\nI like the mussels. I felt like it was a large portion for a 2nd course, I was satisfied with it. I used the tomatoes, onions and juices on the bottom to dip my bread in there. Yum!\n\nAs for the seared scallops and short ribs, I like the short ribs a little bit more than the scallops because it was so tender and juicy. The scallops are really good as well! Both of the mashed potatoes served on the plate tasted similarly to me, it wasn't too buttery or too garlicky, although I do like them super garlicky and buttery. So none of the flavors on the plate were too overpowering.\n\nThey did take awhile to bring out out our dessert. So I was a little annoyed with that. When the dessert came out, I tried my creme brulee. The top of it was slightly bitter, and I wasn't fond of that bitterness. I wasn't a big fan of the ice cream dessert, it had a distinct flowery taste and the cookies were okay. \n\nOverall, I think the wait staff was really great and nice. I really like the ambiance of the restaurant. It's dim but not too dim, it feels really bright but not too bright to feel casual.

As a kid we only would be able to taste french cuisine only in a movie but now I have been to a couple of french cuisine totally different story. is like any body can eat at these cuisine.what is the world coming to. I think french cuisine has got cheaper. and I dont mean price wise. is just Is like u got money u can eat there so there is no seperation from classes. back then I would not dream of eating french like todays because once u go in expect to spend easily couple of hundreds and not to mention is so delicate that most of us asian won't even fill up the stomach with the potion size. but look at today u can basically see alll kinds of people class eat here. loud mouth, cheap ass, don't even know what their eating. is just that french cuisine and japanese cuisine has got cheaper in their class.\n\n1. foie gras not taste the way I think it should taste.\n2. Arugula salad the Arugula was ok but the dressing a little too italian\n3. Dungeness crab salad really not my taste it feels like a chinese lettuce wrap but with crab        instead of pork.\n4. Organic Loch Duart salmon Carppico the salmon might be the worst i ever taste really not fresh taste just like costco packed salmon.\n5, Tomales bay PT. Reyes oyster well I had Tomales bay oyster b4 but it does'nt taste anywhere near. it just taste like the cheap japanese restaurant oyster that U buy 1 for 10...\n6.  Seared Scallop  at this point I just had enough of their seafood so I did'nt even bother to try\n7. Seasonal Fish for my Dad he seems to like it. \n8. Roasted rack of Lamb well my brother in-law liked it \n9. Pan roasted rocky jr range chicken  one of my sister liked it as she can only eat chicken.\n10. Grill Golden gate natural angus flat Iron steak three of us had it including me both me and my 2nd sister order rear i mean basically we both wanted to see blood on the steak well i dont know how hers was but mine came out medium pretty much closer to cooked than rare. Can people actually follow direction if u decide cookinf the steak to medium instead of rare than it would be u that is sitting and me thats working.still to today no one can follow direction like if I want to see blood u better make sure u know how to do it or just throw the piece of raw steak on the dish and serve it that way.they say is angus but I really don't think so. oh well\n\nI kind of notice why because as I was going to the restroom because of the seafood if u know what I mean I saw a bunch of Mexican cooking inside the kitchen. for a minute there I though I was at a taqueria eating a burrito I am not discriminating but where is the french chef.The last french cuisine I went to it had mexican workers but not cooking the dishes.", "author": "Tommy M."}

We chose the prix fixe menu, in which case I got the capers and salmon appetizer, the steak, and the grapefruit slush for dessert. The salmon appetizer was whatevers...it was just raw salmon and capers. It lacked salt and flavor, although the salmon was very fresh.

The courses were served family style as they were prepared..each one tastier than the last.\n\nIsa is great for dates or dinners with a small group. I appreciated the fact that the kitchen is open for you to see as you walk to the back seating area. The layout was nice with tables in the front of the restaurant, and in the back covered patio. Since the meal is \nserved family style, the table does tend to get cramped, but the waiters are very attentive and clear the dishes as soon as they can. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and very helpful, providing recommendations for each course, including their drink menu. At the conclusion of our meal, the celebrant was given a complimentary birthday gelato and small glass of champagne. We were also invited to join Isa's exclusive events ;) Our group had the pleasure of being served by the owner of Isa herself. Thank you for a great SF dining experience, I will definitely be returning!\n\nOne con I will note, was the parking situation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-05", "description": "Finally got to come to Isa yesterday with a couple of friends after talking about coming here for the past few years.  Well worth the wait as the meal and entire dining experience was top notch. Isa is nestled in the heart of the Marina district, juxtaposed between other cute eateries, wineries, and boutique shops. Parking can be difficult here, as I had anticipated from previous Marina adventures, so my friends and I took the 45 bus from 3rd&Market (which took about 45 minutes) to get here.  \n\nIsa's food is described as French-style cuisine which was apparent in some but not all the dishes.  I would describe their cuisine more as Asian-European fusion as many of their dishes had elements of different countries' cuisines on both continents. But overall all the dishes were delicious and well presented.  Isa's food is meant to be shared (e.g. Family style), and so my friends and I shared the dungeoness  crab salad, the baked goat cheese, grilled calamari, the yellowfin tuna, the scallops, the duck breast, the sea bass, and the wild mushroom truffle risotto.  I liked all the dishes, although my favorites were the (1) baked goat cheese which had elements of tomato and basil (almost like a caprese salad) which was totally melt-in-your-mouth watering and went well with the complimentary warm toasted bread, (2) the yellowfin tuna which was similar to Hawaiian poke and was accompanied by a wakame salad and lots of avocado, and (3) gooey, cheesy, soft truffle risotto with amazing, earthy wild mushroom & truffle flavors.  The other dishes were good too, but not as amazing as the three I just mentioned.  Although of note, the scallops were tasty but I thought the accompanied orzo tasted kind of funny (maybe because I'm not much of a fan of orzo).\n\nMy friends and I came here early, at 5:30 for dinner because we wanted to watch the fireworks in the Marina afterwards.  On weekdays, Isa offers a pretty extensive happy hour drinks menu list, which features some specialty cocktails and wines for $5 (until 7pm). Needless to say my friends and I both had 3 drinks each.  Most of the cocktails are pretty tasty, but the Negroni is pretty strong. I was hoping it would be on the sweeter side, which it ultimately was, but I could taste more alcohol than sweet/sugar. I couldn't enjoy that drink as much as I wanted.\n\nThe service here is top notch, as wait staff always come around to fill bread, water and ask if how the food is and if you want to order more drinks/food.  Very professional and attentive staff.\n\nOverall my first experience at Isa was excellent as the food and service here were great! I'm glad I finally got to try this place out after many years of wanting to come here. Well worth the wait.  Four stars!", "author": "Matthew L."}

And take seriously the comments about dishes coming out to your table when the kitchen decides that they're done -- people don't get served at the same time.\n\nThe food was OK.  We ordered a bottle of red wine -- the Clemence from McClean X vineyards.  It retails for around $20 and costs something like $44 at Isa.  The markup is tolerable; you're not getting ripped off at this establishment.  All in all, we felt that the price we paid (~ $40/person, including tax, tip and some alcohol) was totally fair.\n\nThe freshly baked bread (parbread) was very good and totally welcome.\n\nThere were a few strange things about the service -- for example, the cheese plates that you can choose for dessert are served with large spoons, but no knives.  No big problem, though.\n\nOne of the servers (an older guy) spoke some French.  No sign of Isa, though.\n\nWalking in the neighborhood was a big plus for me; I sure don't come here often.

However, our meal was practically over and we were ordering dessert yet our water glasses were being refilled.  Perhaps asking if anyone would like water or putting up some sort of sign for why you ask to refill glasses would help.

I proceeded to politely wait for someone to move to the front of the counter in order to inquire about the order.\n\nAbout one minute after I walked in and waited awkwardly at the counter, a Caucasian 30-something lady walked in and was IMMEDIATELY greeted by the Caucasian waiter. \"Hello ma'am, what may I help you with today?\" He asked. Apparently she was a courier too and he said \"oh, you can have a seat at the bar while I check on your food\", so she sat at the bar and I did as well since I wasn't going to continue standing awkwardly at the counter. Next, he walks around the food prep area & tells her \"oh it'll be another 10 minutes for your order.\" He the looks dismissively at me and briefly asks \"are you looking for something?\" to which I answer \"yes, I'm waiting for a food delivery order for _.\" He then tells me the same thing how he'll check on the order and goes in the back.\n\nAfter a few minutes waiting near each other at the bar, an Indian server walks up to the Caucasian woman sitting next to me (on her cellphone, just as I was at the time) and asks \"have you been helped already, ma'am?\" The lady sitting next to me smiles and says \"yes, thank you\" and then the server walks away without even looking at me. \n\nThe first waiter then comes back from the kitchen and tells me and the Indian server \"your order should be ready in less than five minutes\" & he gestures to me to show her that I'm waiting on the food to expedite the process. I then wait 10 minutes for the food to be prepared. Finally the food comes out & the Indian server then proceeds to pack it & leave it on the counter about two feet away from me (even though he said the order was for me) & walks away.", "author": "Bernice N."}

When it's not good enough for me to sop up my bread in the sauce, it's only ok. \n\nThird Course: \n- Truffle risotto -- this was really good and they gave a generous variety and amount of mushrooms. if you don't like mushrooms, don't get it. \n- Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak -- delicious, cooked perfectly.\n- Seared scallops -- favorite item of the night, i would get this again. \n- Lamb tenders -- this was a weird item. it was good, but the lamb was chopped up in little bites over some veggies.

Interrupting our conversations with his weird banter, monopolizing our time while my party of 6 was trying to catch up, we left with a horrible taste in our mouth, yet the food was so good. Server from Hawaii, chill. You pretty much ruined this dinner for our friends parents.\n\nOnto the food. Wow. Everything we ordered was phenomenal or close to it. The grilled local calamari to start was seriously perfect. It was hard to share since this dish was extremely flavorful and light. A must. We also shared the baked goat cheese, again amazing and more than enough to go around.\n\nThe potato wrapped seabass was a pure delight and I can see why it's their signature dish, it was impressive. Exactly how it sounds, a buttery sea bass enveloped by a potato crust. I've had this dish before at a fancy restaurant in Nantucket, and Isa blew it out of the water. The truffle risotto was pillowy rich and one bite wasn't enough, I snuck two. My friend's butter fish special was the only let down of the meal. It was teeny and ultimately flavorless and I wouldn't recommend. My friend enjoyed his rack of lamb, but compared to my seabass, he was disappointed. \n\nWe sat out back in the covered patio with heat lamps which was absolutely wonderful, although loud. I definitely recommend Isa.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Was seated right away after we walk in...and of course we had a reservation.  Our server greeted us and told us the specials, but both of us decided to go for the 3 course prix fix for $30/person.  Pretty good deal.\n\nFirst courses:\n\nOrganic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio - Pretty yummy for a starter.  You get four pieces of crostini and 6 thin slices of salmon with all the goodies on top.  The salmon was pretty fresh.  The toppings went well with the salmon and crostini.  If there was a hint of lime, I think it would of tasted much more refresh, but nonetheless, it was still pretty delicious.\n\nSteam Prince Edward Mussels - Yum!  The white wine sauce was so tasty that my friend even use the spoon and drank it.  The mussels tasted pretty fresh and it had the right amount of seasoning.  This dish comes with two pieces of grilled bread and it goes very well with the sauce.\n\nSecond Courses:\n\nTruffle Risotto - Yummy!  Cooked to perfection.  The flavors on this dish is just perfect and the texture was good.  The truffle didn't over power any taste on this dish.  We were able to take the wine, mushrooms, and truffle flavors at the same time.  Perfect amount of mushrooms with this dish too.  Yum.\n\nSpaghetti - This is a dish I didn't really care for.  The spaghetti is not as saucy as I liked it and it tasted like it was drenched in butter.  For spaghetti, I like more of a tomato-ey taste, but this dish just taste like it had too much butter.\n\nDessert:\n\nBuche Au Luit De Chevre - Light and fluffy is how I can explain this dessert.  It wasn't overly sweet with the taste of hazelnut.  Yummy!\n\nGrapefruit Granite - They said this is like a grapefruit sorbet, but to me its more like a grapefruit shave ice.  Nice way to end the meal. \n\nThe overall experience here was great.  The service was great as well.  Our empty dishes were cleared out pretty quickly and our waters were always filled.  The servers check on us often to make sure that everything was good.  Will definitely come back here to try other items on the menu.", "author": "Ashley L."}

We decided on dining at a French restaurant and chose Isa. It so happened they were participating in Dine About Town. As usual, we made our reservation via OpenTable. We arrived on time on a Saturday night and were seated at the patio within minutes.\n\nOur server was Domingo. He was welcoming and enthusiastic and had a great presence. He mentioned that the restaurant is \"family style\", meaning the food is meant to be shared. We were fine with this since my hubby and I usually share our meals anyway. Domingo gave a couple of suggestions on what to order. The Dine About Town menu consisted of four-course meals and we chose:\n\n1st Course:\nMaine Lobster Broth: You can definitely taste the freshness of the lobster.\nPotato & Leek Soup: Nothing really stood out with this item. No explosive flavors.\n\n2nd Course:\nDungeness Crab Salad: The crab was almost non existent. It was more lettuce than anything. \nYellowfin Tuna: Had just the right amount of spice. This item was one of the more memorable ones.\n\n3rd Course:\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: Another memorable item that I will never stop thinking about. The meat was so tasty and tender and the beets were to die for.\nBraised Short Ribs: Fall off the bone, tender meat served with mashed potatoes and veggies. So full of flavor and a definite MUST.\n\n4th Course:\nSemifreddo all' Amaretto: A yummy, creamy, not too sweet custard served with three small vanilla cookies. \nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee: The name says it all. Pair this with the amaretto. \n\nDrinks: A glass of Riesling for me and a Stella for the hubby.\n\nService all around was on point. The silverware and plates were always cleared from the table and new sets were placed. The bread was neverending and delicious. During our dinner, there was a delay in the kitchen and the maitre d' informed each table and apologized for the wait. \n\nIn the end, we were full and satisfied. We'd come back again", "author": "Heather R."}

Food was fresh, made to order so it comes out hot! Very cute marketing ploy at the end of your meal: a secret envelope to be opened by Isa staff only the next time you dine at Isa, it could be a prize for free bottle of wine or a dining gift card..basically to get you to come back again, valid for the following month only.\n\nSF restaurant week: 4 courses for $40 with lots of options per course to choose. They encourage family style, i.e. share your food, but that's totally up to the diners. The potato leek soup was actually my fave..piping hot, truffle oil, potato starchy creaminess, and the bacon!! I'm a sucker for potato leek soup but Isa's has more depth of flavors than I have had in the past from other restaurants. Butter lettuce salad wasn't memorable, butter lettuce, some crumbles of blue cheese, vinaigrette& pear slices.\n\n2nd course: tuna avocado thing that very much tasted like poke to me with some seaweed salad as the base..wait a minute, it is tuna poke deconstructed in a sense...enjoyable as the tuna was fresh. Salmon carpaccio was a miss for me, it was lacking flavor & the creme fraiche drizzle (thank you for a light drizzle) wasn't really necessary...i guess cause i'm not a huge creme fraiche, white creamy sauce kind of person (gag). The mussels was ohkay, broth was yummy but mussel meat were teeny tiny..it shrank alot! Then again, that's my gripe about PEI mussels..Isa--contact Cuisinett Restaurant in San Carlos about which mussel farm they get their mussels from (apparently some farm from British Columbia, Canada) because their mussels are MEATY!\n\n3rd course: Seared scallops were made perfectly, soft & tender but only 3 scallops to a mountain of mashed potatoes...wish there were 4 scallops. Flat iron steak made rare, wow...so tender I didn't even need to use the steak knife they gave us. And I made sure I smeared that tarragon butter ALL over the slices including the fingerling potatoes which were MADE PERFECTLY too! So perfectly flavored. Duck breast was delicious too, the end pcs of the duck breast without any of the sauce touching had such a crispy skin that it tasted like pork cracklins! the other parts of the breast were just as tasty too...all of us very much enjoyed most of our 3rd courses with the exception of the mashed potato ratio to scallops. I looked over other diner's table who ordered the pan roasted chicken & that looked tasty too.\n\n4th course: grapefruit granite was refreshing & definitely tasted like real deal grapefruit. You can definitely taste the pith bitterness in it but that's expected as I am sure they used real grapefruit to make it..no artificial flavors there! The goat cheese w/honey paired very well together. The amaretto semifreddo was our least favorite..it was almond ice cream but it was too much almond. It's tasted like almond extract upon crushed almond in the ice cream & almond cookies...it wasn't our fave amongst the three. \n\nIt was a lot of food & amazingly, I was just right! Not overly stuffed but just right..my sister was overly stuffed. We shared everything, had bites of everything. The portions were very decent, not too much but not skimpy. \n\nCannot wait to come back in feb on a thursday with mom..you'll know why. And i am highly considering this place to host a party/small gathering this summer as the back patio tent area looks really cute (according to the yelp pics). \n\nAfter tip & tax, $40 four course meal, a cocktail ($9) plus the $25 foie gras (split btwn 2 ppl)..each person spent $77", "author": "Yolanda L."}

It was absolutely stellar. If this restaurant existed in Fort Worth I'd be so, so broke right now. I'm in love.\n\nIsa refers to itself as a \"Cal-French small plate\" restaurant, which is plain as day. I'm a fan of this easy description and the restaurant's lovely, fresh concept. Local California food with a French influence, served tapas style? Yes, yes, yes. I'm all in.\n\nEvery single thing we ordered looked and tasted so wonderfully complex, but the best part is that these dishes are actually so simple. No hidden ingredients. This is the kind of restaurant that doesn't have a gluten-free menu because they don't need one; all of the food descriptions are clear and our waiter was amazing with answering questions (even though I didn't really have any). He reassured me that our meals were GF. \n\nAdam and I decided to order three small plates to share. Their menu changes frequently because they only use seasonal and fresh foods, of course, but in early March we were lucky enough to have the \"Baked Laura Chenel goat cheese\" which comes with basil pesto, tomato concass\u00e9e, and pinenuts. It's served with fresh sourdough bread (Adam loved it), and I ate this incredible cheese straight with a fork. OH MY GODS. It was so perfect. I love goat cheese and Isa's presentation was gorgeous.\n\nWe also ordered the \"Grilled local calamari\" which is made with honey spice, lemon zest, and arugula; served on a bed of flageolet beans. Whoa. At first I thought I'd be freaked out because I haven't eaten a lot of calamari that wasn't deep-fried (so it's been like, 5+ years since I've had any). I wasn't freaked out though, I was in love and obsessed... simply fawning over this amazing plate. The calamari had an incredible delicate yet meaty texture, they weren't chewy at all. They were sweet and a bit tart, and the hearty beans were the perfect accompaniment. \n\nFinally, we shared the \"Local Mushrooms\" plate. These buttery, rich, earthy shrooms were served with garlic, jus de veau (veal stock), and parsley. Damn. I mean seriously. I love mushrooms when they're raw and plain, so you can imagine how fantastic I thought these were... sauteed with such strong and beautiful ingredients. The garlic was sweet and powerful and the parsley added the perfect brightness. Who knew you could get so excited about and be so satisfied by a simple plate of mushrooms? I DID. And Isa delivered.\n\nAfter eating slowly and indulging in every little bite, we decided to pass on dessert. We didn't skip the wine though! I had an amazing champagne. Isa also features plenty of cocktails (all made with Soju) and beer. I was 100% happy with my bubbles (and $8.50 per glass wasn't too bad). Actually, the prices overall were pretty awesome, I think. Our small plates each ran about $13, and they were so worth it.", "author": "Kendall S."}

STAY THE F AWAY!!!\n\nThis is going to be my first rant of 2014 -- to begin: I was here last year for DAT with a friend and I enjoyed everything. Service / food = awesome. I didn't have a chance to review them then, because LIFE happened. \n\nI didn't think it was WORTH it for me to go back for regular pricing menu, I wasn't that impressed to begin with so this year, I wanted to take my family to check it out... I told my siblings about the food... and they said sure... let's try it... for DAT.\n\nMade a reservation via opentable.com = all was set. Yesterday, Jan 23 - I get a confirmation call. The hostess tells me again that they're doing DAT and that they are busy and to come in on time. I told her = GOT IT. \n\nThat same night, we parked at Wells Fargo and our reservation was at 6:15. I called to give them a courtesy call that \"Hey, we're walking there now... just letting you know.\" \n\nTo the management: I don't know who your hostess was or the person answering the phone, but she answered and told me this verbatim: \"I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THERE IS A PARTY OF THREE COMING IN AT 8:00 PM...\" \n\nI didn't even bother saying thank you - because to me, that was a big FU! Seriously? What THE F?! \n\nI was calling to let you know that we were en route... a courtesy call... and if you know the Marina... the Well's Fargo parking is just a freaking block... 5 min walk tops! And you're going to respond to my call like that - with an effen attitude? \n\nHELLO?! You as a restaurant decided to be a part of Dine About Town and me as a customer, WAS planning on having a good time... with your food and possibly drinks, NOT rushed to be herded in and out!!! It's not a competition eating contest, is it? Because I didn't see that in the fine print and I'm a graphic designer and so I am aware of how small those fine prints are, because I design them!!!\n\nHow DARE you rush a customer who hasn't even step foot onto your establishment?! Can you imagine if we walked in there at 6:30 and we decided to get a bottle of wine or a couple of cocktails... then what? You're going to make us chug our drinks? \n\nISA - WHAT THE F!? \n\nYou are not Gary Danko. You are not Nobu. You are not Melisse. You are not the French Laundry  = so don't act like you are one. \n\nI have never been so furious and insulted at a restaurant that I wasn't even inside yet! EWWWW!\n\nTo the management and to that woman who answered my call at 6:18 pm on Jan 23, 2014 = SCREW YOU!!! My family and I went to Ristorante Parma next door and guess what, we dropped $300 for 3 people. Your DAT = $105. And seriously, check your reviews... they're all YELLOWS and now I know why!? \n\nI will tell all my friends / family / colleagues to freaking avoid this place and oh and guess what, I'm on YELP! \n\nTo my fellow Yelpers... from my previous reviews - I keep it real. I give, to the best of my abilities, reviews that you care / can relate too. And this is one of those reviews that really, just infuriated me to the core.

This by far was my favorite dish. It tasted very similar to poke.\n\nMain Dish: I had the duck, but honestly it was just mediocre. Nothing to rave about. I also tried the scallops which was good, but you only get 3 and the rest is some type of orzo/ small noodle thingy. My suggestion is go with the chicken or the ribs.

Go visit this place!!\n\nMy coworker and I decided to do 3 places with Dine About Town SF and this was my fav. our of the three.  Everything was already looking up from the time i found parking right in front of the restaurant to dessert. First look, I thought this place was super small! Don't be deceived. They build an outdoor area with covers and it looks amazing. Loved the ambiance of the place.\n\n****TIP****\nHAPPY HOUR\nDollar oysters and half off alcohol menu!\n\nThe menu allowed us to have 4 entr\u00e9es. The first course, I picked the potato leek soup and my coworker got the arugula salad.  The soup was alright in my book but paired with the bread and butter they gave us that I dipped into the soup make it amazing! The free bread and butter reminded me of France. The butter was so yummy! (I know....all the rave about the bread and butter but....oh well)\n\nSince the waiter (who was super friend btw) told us they served everything family style and it comes out all together. The next thing that showed up was my coworker's salmon carpaccio (think that's what it was called) and that was super good! It had eggs and cucumber with it along with pieces of smoked salmon with a crustini. Yum! Before my yellow fin tuna came out, my risotto came out. Now, I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it was a truffle risotto and of course I had to get it! Anything truffle, I'm ok with it...just other mushrooms makes me gag. Tried it and you get this heavy truffle taste along with parmesan . Yum! (Can I say, by this time I've engorged myself with so much bread and butter that I'm super stuffed!) But still, I couldn't help myself in scooping more risotto onto my plate. \n\nAfter that, the yellowfin tuna came out and it's of course, all raw. (Just realized that most everything we ordered were raw...hah) This was really delicious! The bottom had some avocado and drenched with some sriracha. Yum!  The combination gave me this heavy and spicy feeling and matched with the tuna, it was amazing! (Not sure if my description makes sense. hah)\n\nThen, onto the duck my coworker ordered. This was my least favorite...I'm not much of a duck person but it was pretty good. This...was also cooked a little raw (i never knew you could eat duck raw!) Maybe it was my mentality but eating it raw kinda make me go...ehh...no. For some reason, anything that's a bird and raw makes me scared because of chicken. But it was really flavorful and I was glad by this point, I was super full so I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.\n\nLast but not least, the dessert. We both got the vanilla bean creme brulee. Yum! It was smooth and really delicious! At first, I couldn't crack the burnt sugar on top but once I got into that custardy goodness, I was in creme brulee heaven. I was so sad when I finished it.\n\nService:\nMy oh my was the service spectacular. All the waiters were super friendly and attentive. It was kind of funny though, because I asked for more bread and one of the waiters gave everyone bread but not our table =(. But I saw him walking back and forth trying to figure out with table wanted more bread! No biggie. Just asked another waiter and we got our bread. It was def. not a ding on their service because I mean, I can understand if someone can forget since it was so busy and it's only bread, no biggie. But the service was seriously amazing.

Chicken was a hit, steak was a hit, duck was a hit, calamari, asparagus soup, and risotto were all popular with our table.  The wine was pretty good too.  A vino Verde from Portugal was sweet and light.  The sauvignon was perfect, and I was happy to see a french red on the wine list as well.

The risotto was also delicious, and the steak was alright. \n\nI would say the only downside is parking.

I would recommend you not listen to this unless you are a big eater.  I consider myself to have a pretty voracious appetite, but I was really full.

I also had the yellowfin tuna tartare which was slightly more spicy and substantive but not too heavy either. I tried a bit of the seared scallops which were cooked very well. The truffle risotto was very rich and I liked the savory flavor, I just wished the rice was cooked slightly more. For dessert I had a semifreddo for the first time- I liked the light texture but otherwise it could have used more flavor. \n\nA solid meal that ended up balancing out with dishes that were light versus those that were heavy. They know how to present seafood beautifully and balance it well!", "author": "Steven V."}

The wait staff was warm and friendly, and very knowledgeable about their menu.  Food is family style so be sure to order multiple dishes. Family and I ordered the Truffle Risotto, the Potato wrapped sea bass, Maple Leaf Farm duck breast, Steamed Prince Edward island mussels, and spaghetti (for the little one in our party); most everything was tasty and delicious: the potato on the sea bass was salty but the fish was nice and flaky.  I would recommend everything we ordered.  For drinks, I ordered a Lemon Drop; for someone who doesn't drink often, and if I do prefer a light sweeter cocktail or white wine, I really enjoyed this nice cocktail.  It's quite light and enjoyably sweet, but not overly.  Definitely one I would recommend for those with a sweet palate.  \nWe opted to get dessert elsewhere, but the waiter told me he had a something for me and came out with a small ramekin of ice cream and a glass of Flip Flop Muscat dessert wine.  Figures someone said something, but that was very kind of the waiter.  Recommended place to celebrate and will definitely make a return trip for another occasion.", "author": "Jessica S."}

We ordered almost every dish off the  special SF restaurant week menu. Every dish was amazing. The salads, tuna tartare, mussles, baked goat cheese were all top notch.

After reviewing about 15 dine about town menus, I decided Isa was THE place to go. At first, we were on a wait list of 7 and thought we would not get a table. Then, a table opened for 5pm so we took it. They are offering a delicious 4-course meal for $36.95, where as other restaurants mainly offer a 3-course meal (that was a plus). We had the Maine lobster broth with prawns for the first course, which was not bad. The second course was my favorite...salmon carpaccio and the yellow fin tuna over avocado with seaweed salad and nori!! They were both sooo good!! For the third course, I had the braised short ribs which were super tender and delicious. I even had half leftover for the next day and it was still delicious the next day. For dessert, the vanilla bean cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tasted perfect. My friend ordered the maple leaf farm duck breast which was also nice...and the semifreddo all'amaretto, which tasted like amaretto ice cream. We also had soju cocktails...a lemon drop and a Cosmo. They were light (I'm not much of a drinker) and tasted pretty good. We also had the raw oysters which were a great value...only $1 each...and delicious. \nOverall, I was so happy with my experience at Isa. The service was great too...we had a nice friendly guy (I think he said his name was Dean, but not 100% sure).\nI read another reviewer's experience about Isa and how she was very offended because the restaurant rushed her before she even got there. For my experience, originally I had a reservation for 2 for 5:00pm. I called and asked to change it to 3 people and they were accommodating, but informed me that a party was coming in at 6:30pm (so I pretty much had to get out by then). I did not mind though because I was already happy to get a reservation. Then, one friend couldn't make it so I changed the reservation back to 2 people (I know, annoying). However, the entire time I was dining at Isa, I did not feel rushed by any staff member or server (although they did give us the warning like the other reviewer experienced). I was afraid they would say something to us around 6:30pm, but 6:30pm came and went and nobody rushed us or made us feel like we had to leave at any certain time. I think they even still had one or two tables open (who knows, maybe people didn't show up. Lol, maybe it was that girl that didn't show up...j/k). It was so relaxing out on their covered patio. The food was fabulous and the service was excellent!! I would definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Jean S."}

Even if you don't like liver, order the foie gras. $29.95 for a three course prix fix menu Sunday to Thursday. What a great deal! There's a pretty good selection for you to choose from too. On top of the prix fixe, you can get $5 happy hour drinks if you dine before 7PM. The happy hour menu consisted of either wine or soju cocktails. \n\nThe boyfriend and I both opted for the prix fixe. As other have noted, the food is served tapas style and is meant to be shared, which worked out well for us. While it's not on the prix fix, the foie gras ($24) here is amazing, and is worth ordering off of the main menu. The foie gras came with some type of cake like bread and a side of baked pears seasoned with nutmeg. Everything on this plate was foodgasmic. I don't even typically like liver, but the foie gras was delicious. Besides the foie gras, we also had:\n\n-Salmon carpaccio: I really liked this. Tastes very similar to Chapeau's trio of salmon. \n-Steamed mussels: This was ok, but I'm not much of a mussels person in general. \n-Pan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range chicken: This was recommended to us over the steak. I pretty much never choose chicken over steak, but this came so highly recommended by our server that we gave it a try. It's probably one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. Chicken was crispy, mashed potatoes were buttery, and sauce was delicious. I wouldn't say that it's on the same level as a top of the game beef or pork dish, but still good. \n-Truffle risotto: This dish was disappointing, maybe because it was following up the chicken and the foie gras, which were both great. People on yelp seem to love it, but I'd skip this one in the future. There are better options on the menu if you're not a vegetarian.  \n-Grapefruit Granite: Shaved ice with grapefruit flavoring on top. Skip this. Tasted like a bitter snow cone. It tasted like someone managed to extract all of the bad parts of a grapefruit and left all the good parts behind. \n-Semifreddo all amarteto: The better option if you're looking for a sweet dessert rather than a cheese plate. It tasted like a coffee cake had a baby with ice cream. \n\n In terms of drinks, we went for the soju cocktails. We had the number 7 (blackberries, ginger, champagne), greyhound (grapefruit juice and bitters), and the mojito (soda, lime, mint, sugar). Of the three, we both liked the number 7, which was sweet and tart, and the mojito. The greyhound didn't have very much flavor to it. \n\nI usually don't comment too much on service, but the service here was remarkably slow. Our server was a really friendly guy and was great when he was around, but the food was very slow in coming out (like over half an hour between the first and second appetizer). I heard several complaints about this from other tables around us as well, but I think maybe the kitchen was just having an off night since the other reviews didn't mention this. They did pick up the speed after we mentioned it though. I've also had some tables in tight spaces in the past (it is SF after all), but this was the most cramped seating arrangement I've ever had.\n\nPrice: $107 for two people pre-tip", "author": "Tiffany N."}

It wasn't awful; just not particularly interesting or flavorful.  The grilled calamari tasted more sauteed than grilled, and were overwhelmed by the spice mix.  The Dungeness crab salad cups also suffered an unbalanced quality, as the crab was flavorless and was dominated rather than complimented by the grapefruit.  The duck breast was very good, but didn't overcome the shortcomings.  \n\nIt was also really LOUD in the back area, which could have just been a function of the fact that there were several tables of boisterous diners with piercing voices and laughs.  I hate to whine about other people enjoying themselves, but it actually made it hard for us to have a conversation.  Given the fact that we'd enjoyed Isa the first time, we may give it another shot, but this was definitely less than we'd hoped for.", "author": "Paul R."}

With Savored (http://savored.com/), you pay $10 for a reservation and get 30% off your bill. I thought the second time would be a charm since Isa continues to get rave reviews. Boy, was I WRONG!\n\nOn Monday, 9.5.11, my friend and I arrived a little early for our 6:30 PM reservations but was promptly seated in the front dining room. I requested patio dining seating since it was nice day, but the hostess said with the Savored deal, there was assigned seating and if we wanted to sit in the patio we would have to forgo our deal. I wasn't going to lose the $10 I paid for the reservation and then have to pay full price for our meal. It didn't make sense to me but whatever, I digress.\n\nF O O D\n*GRADE A FOIE GRAS w/ Peaches & Custard Brioche ($22) - 0 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=U82JXqnl0FWSDRN2EhGPZA\nFoie gras is one of things I enjoy most when dining out and the one at Isa is single-handedly the WORST foie gras I've ever had! The foie gras was burnt to a black char and any good chef would have NEVER let that leave the kitchen! Normally, foie gras should cut like butter and I felt like I was sawing through firewood. Because the foie gras was overcooked and burnt, it lost all of its luxurious richness it once had. Aside from this, the peaches were too big to handle and should have been cooked down to a compote for easier eating. The dish in its entirety was terrible and NOT cohesive. \n\nThe couple next to us even commented that our foie gras looked \"odd\". I guess that's one way to put it!\n\n*POTATO WRAPPED SEABASS w/ Capers, Fresno Peppers, Parsley, Tomato Confit, Brown Butter & Lemon ($22) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=jgh4kPoDih4X7Tu83OjnLw\nI rarely order fish but I decided to order the potato wrapped seabass after all the glowing reviews. What a mistake! Though the seabass was tender, the potato that it was wrapped around was once again burnt. The caper, tomato confit, fresno pepper, and brown butter sauce masked some of the burnt flavor, however it completely drowned the fish with a very overpowering saltiness. Needless to say, the delicateness of the fish got lost in the sauce and I went scrambling for bread just to wash out all the salty flavor from my mouth.  \n\n*VANILLA CR\u00c8ME BRULEE ($6) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=zVFJpL3AJP2LE3UZgSxN3A\nThe best part of our meal was the cr\u00e8me brulee though it was mediocre. The cr\u00e8me brulee had a very thick crust was very hard to chew. If I were any older, I would have probably lost a tooth from chewing on the oddly thick bruleed crust. Unfortunately, it just tasted like eating rock candy. \n\nS E R V I C E\nThough the staff was friendly and checked on us several times, they needed help in the timing department because they made us feel rushed. We weren't even done with our appetizers before our entrees came so we had to rush to pick off whatever we wanted to make room for our entr\u00e9e dishes. Not even two minutes before getting the bill, one of the waiters came to get the bill. I left the bill sleeve OPEN while I was grabbing my CC from my wallet (to split the bill) which should be an indication we were not ready to pay the bill. He was ready to take away the bill away with one CC and I had to kindly intervene to tell him we weren't ready to pay yet. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nThe front dining room is dark, classy yet casual. I prefer the back patio better as it's more lit and more laid back. \n\nP A R K I N G\nParking in the area is difficult, so I suggest going here on a weeknight right at 6PM to snag metered street parking. Or better yet, cab it. \n\nI'm not much of Groupon/Living Social/HomeRun/Etc. girl because I buy deals which I end up forgetting about (I've wasted more money than I've saved) and service tends to be severely compromised.

I had the arugula salad, tuna, flatiron steak and semifreddo while my friend had the butter lettuce salad, mussels, braised short rib and same dessert.\n\nI hated my salad bc the arugula was too spicy for me (my mistake for choosing it) but the butter lettuce salad was good. There was nothing outstanding about them so I would skip salads the next time I come back during regular season.\n\nOn the other hand, we loved our apps. The mussels were fresh and flavorful and grilled bread to soak up the tasty broth. The yellowfin tuna was to die for-fresh and well seasoned. The lean protein with the avocado and seaweed salad was the perfect combo.\n\nAt this point we were getting full but more kept coming! We had the braised short rib with broccolini and buttery mashed potatoes. The mash was really good but the short rib was melt in your mouth delicious. It took a while for my flat iron steak to come out but maybe they knew we were stuffed at this point and need time to digest. I asked for medium rare but it came out a little too done on the exterior for my taste. Still tasted good but a bit chewy. Those potatoes were yummy though.\n\nBefore we could throw in the towel (or napkin in this case) we were reminded about dessert. We both had the semifreddo and it was the perfect way to end the night. It was sweet but not too sweet, light and airy along with some flavorful almond flavored cookies.\n\nIsa had both food and service on point when I made the visit.

All dishes are meant to be shared, as they come out to the table as soon as they are ready one at a time, and the restaurant suggests two dishes per person, which was perfect for us. We enjoyed the baked goat cheese, mussels, duck breast, and truffle risotto. This was one of the best, if not THE best, meals I have ever enjoyed. Everything was PERFECTLY prepared. We also ordered the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, and it did not disappoint. If I lived in San Francisco, I would be back regularly. The prices are also VERY reasonable for the quality of food received, and the service was great. Wonderful experience...I highly recommend.", "author": "Marisa M."}

Its problem is that its foie gras dish is so out-of-this world good, very few dishes can compare, including its own. \n\nHad I not had the foie gras, perhaps I would've been more wowed by their truffle risotto (which I thought was mediocre) and perhaps that chicken would've been so mind blowing, I'd be raving about that instead (now that I think about it, I've never had better chicken--ever.)\n\nCome here. Do order the foie gras, but ask for it to be served last, or else you'd be eating mouthfuls of delicious food yet still longing for another bite of that heavenly foie gras.\n\nAnother note: don't order the grapefruit granite for dessert. While I was eating it, I thought it would be much better as a palate cleanser than a dessert. It turns out, that's what it was intended for initially.", "author": "Newton L."}

Our friend had recommended this place, so we were excited to try this little spot near the Marina.\n\nLike previous reviewers have stated, the food are all small plates, so they are meant to be shared. With that being said, the three of us split the following:\n\n- Dungeness Crab Salad\n- Grilled Local Calamari\n- Steamed P.E.I. Mussels\n- Truffle Risotto\n- Halibut with Artichokes, Tomato Confit, Olives, Basil and Zucchini\n- Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast \n\nAll were great, with the exception of the Truffle Risotto. IMO, it was oversalted, had too much cream and butter, and the texture was past the recommended soft chewiness.\n\nThe Duck Breast was tasty, and a little on the rare side. I had never eaten Duck Breast being slightly rare, but it was really yummy. The accompanied tossed salad provided the tartness to offset the smokey flavors in the duck. A total winner, I'd get this for myself next time.\n\nThe Halibut was well seasoned and cooked well, with not too much butter. I enjoyed the basil zucchini flavors with olives, total umami.\n\nThe rest were well done, and throughout the entire meal, we marveled over the freshness in ingredients with great technique. Often times, you go to a place that doesn't get both right. Isa does it right, and at the end of the night, we were very happy with our meal. Service was attentive without being stuffy, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really warm and lovely. We didn't opt to sit outside on the patio, but I'm sure it is just as lovely.\n\nAnother side note of great service, Husband and I got there early and had to wait for our friend to arrive. The hostess was super sweet, and told us that we had nothing to worry about in losing our reservation. In fact, she let us pick our table, and she kept it open as many people starting flocking into the restaurant! It was a really sweet gesture, and we appreciated it much. As we waited, the bar staff offered us some drinks, but all I ended up getting was water. Next time, I will try their fresh-squeezed juices.\n\nAnyway, it's a good thing that I don't live close by, otherwise, I'd be here every few weeks! Next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming here again. \n\nYou should go....NOW!", "author": "Tara L."}

We started off ordering one appetizer and ended up ordering three more because of how amazing everything tasted. The roasted goat cheese, prawns, yellowfin tartare were equally tasteful and satisfying. For the main dish I ordered the sea bass and loved every bite of it. Keep in mind there is no side with the sea bass but it was still worth every dollar. \n\nI finished my meal off with the flour less chocolate cake which tasted good but not anything unique from what I've tastes at other restaurants.

Our server Nathan and Julio were very attentive with our table refilling our water and wine very promptly. The red wine we had (forgot the name :/.. Chateau something) was moved from a wine bottle to this really cute wine container to pour into our glasses. The servers were friendly and willing to give their honest opinions on recommendations. They joked around with us and talked to us which is a thumbs up because it showed me they were attentive and wants the customers to feel welcomed and relaxed. \n\nWe had 4 orders of the Maine Lobster Broth, one Grilled Local Calamari, and one tomato dish with goat cheese. The soup of the Lobster broth was better tasting than the shrimp that comes with it. The grilled calamari was something different than having the usual fried calamari but it was delicious and the arugula that came with it was even more yummy to me! The tomato appetizer we had, had super sweet tomatoes that came with a crouton-like pieces which added a unique experience to tomatoes which were soft with a crunchy side to it.\n\nFor the entree among 6 people with a family-styled dinner, we had two orders of the Roasted Rack of Lamb, which I am not a fan of lamb but the veggies that came alongside it were delicious! Not usually a fan of eggplants but when chopped into pieces with zucchini, red peppers, and olives, it was delicious! Had an order of Potato Wrapped Seabass, which was my favorite entree dish! Flavorful and delicious when paired with potatoes! The last order we had was the Grilled Golden Gage Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak. The steak was well-done and a bit dry, but the zucchini was good and the flavor was very tasty. Four entrees with three different appetizers, we were definitely full, but not too full, meaning we had room for desserts!\n\nWe ordered two Vanilla Bean Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, one Flourless Chocolate Cake with vanilla bean gelato, and one order of the Semifreddo All Amaretto. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good because it wasn't too sweet, but tasteful enough to enjoy. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was my favorite because it was paired with vanilla bean gelato which tasted super good! Not a fan of the amaretto taste, but I really enjoyed the little cookie pieces inside the ice cream.\n\nOverall, good meal. Will be back because I didn't get to try the Dungeness Crab Salad and Organic Loch Duart Calmon Carpaccio. The service was excellent. The wine had a nice aroma to it even though I'm not a red wine fan. Ordered a bottle to pair with the meal, which was nice. Had a lot of wine options and even offered some soju cocktails. Definitely will be back to try other things. But come a bit earlier than your reservation because parking isn't easy around here.", "author": "Amanda C."}

We chose this restaurant because it is supposed to be family style. Because it was family style I was expecting portions to be larger, however it was restaurant week and I wonder if the portions were made smaller to accommodate? We ordered the below for a group of 7. \n\nArugula salad\nEndive salad\nLeek soup\nTuna Tower - favorite!! I was expecting some really tall stacking of cubes of tuna, but it was presented nicely and the flavor was so good. I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it was the best.\nSalmon carpaccio\nMussels - ok, normal mussels you can get anywhere.\nGoat cheese\nScallops - I was expecting this to be spectacular due to another yelp reviewer, but it was ok. \nDuck breast\nSteak - a bit tough and not spectacular\nShort ribs - way too greasy for me. The fat and oil completely diminished the flavor.\nSemi freddo \nGrapefruit granita - grapefruit juice on ice. haha I liked this after my meal.\nCreme brule\n\nThey sat us on a small round table so I wouldn't suggest your extremely large group to come unless you like to bump elbows just a little bit. I grew up in a large family so eating while touching elbows and tucked into your side with the person next to you is completely normal to me. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is completely covered so when the weather doesn't permit outdoor seating, it looks like they can make it work. There were heaters for those of us who run on the colder side.\n\nOverall the experience was nice. The food was good and the atmosphere is a fun family style.

Parking is a bit hard to find in the Marina area, but definitely do-able. We had reservations for a party of 7 and were seated immediately at the back of the restaurant. It felt like we were in a garden/patio. Super cute!\n\nMy meal consisted of:\n\nMartini: It was still during happy hour time so definitely worth the $5!\n\nMaine Lobster Broth: Pretty good and pretty flavorful. Only a few pieces of tiger prawns in it. I used the provided bread to dip and eat it with the broth. Now THAT was good.\n\nSteamed Prince Edward Island Mussels: Steamed with garlic, white wine, and parsley. I love seafood, so this was def. a plus for me! Loved their mussels especially their flavor. And this dish was just suppose to be my appetizer! I felt like it was already my main course! Plus, I used the provided bread to dip it into the broth and it was so delicious!!! \n\nSeared Scallops: The scallops was accompanied with brussels sprout, mashed potatoes, bacon and truffle sauce. Love their brussels sprout! I was pretty sad when there were only three scallops though. I wished there were more! But still, it was so flavorful. \n\nSemifreddo all' amaretto: This was pretty good and was presented nicely! It was soft and not too overwhelming.

What can you say \n\nCustomer Service: We were instantly seated since we did have a reservation and although we were 10minutes late due to parking issues they were welcoming still! We were seated and kindly greeted by our server who was so sweet! He was very informative of everything on the menu and he had a sense of humor which is always a plus! Apparently he's been with the restaurant for quite some time and you can tell her does love his job! It's very rare that you come across people that actually love what they do and it shows through him. I believe his name was Dean, I am sorry I'm bad with names but what I know is that he is this older khmer gentleman (Cambodian) and he is just all smiles, I'm sure you wont miss him if you come across him!\n\nDecor: I didn't get to look around the restaurant but as you approach it, it's very inviting! We were seated in the outside patio which I absolutely LOVED, the atmosphere can be thought of in different ways. One it is romantic for all the lovebirds that come because although it is outside it is covered by a tarp and there are heated lamps and the lighting is dimmed but very romantic! For all the groups that come for birthdays or other occasions it's also a an inviting area to just have a good time with good company and have good food! \n\nPresentation of Food: The portions are fair and you will leave very full!\n\nHow did the food taste?: We did the prix fixed menu! We were full and everything was great!\n1. Mussels and Calamari for appetizers! The mussels and the sauce were so good paired with their bread. As for the calamari I loved it! Don't expect the fried calamari this is grilled I believe with olives and white beans. Everything was good!\n2. I had the steak which was cooked medium rare and the veggies that came with it were perfect! My bf had the chicken and although some people on yelp didn't like it what I can say is that if they replaced the pieces with all chicken thighs it would be better (it comes with chicken breat and a small chicken thigh) Although it was skin was seasoned well and it was crispy so that was  a plus!\n3. The grapefruit granite was a good choice for dessert because it does clear your palet after that if you order the semi amaretto it's the perfect ending to a wonderful meal!\n\nOverall Experience: They came out singing happy birthday which was very sweat and had a candle in the semi amaretto plus they gave me a small personal glass of prosecco on the house.

I don't like raw fish so I didn't try any, but everyone else enjoyed it.\nLaura Chenel Goat Cheese - warm and easy to spread on bread.\nCalamari - delicious, non-breaded calamari.\nSea of Cortez Wild Prawns - 4 large prawns; these were a little too salty.\nSaffron Paella - clams, mussels, calamari, and prawns on rice with lobster broth and red peppers. Definitely my favorite of the night. I would definitely order this again! However, some of the mussel and clam came empty.\nTruffle Risotto - Definitely a strong mushroom taste. \nFlat Iron Steak - Cooked medium/rare. Definitely not for me.

Delicious!\nSemifreddo all' Amaretto - Had the texture of grainy ice cream that was more icy than creamy. Good flavor. Strange consistency. Not bad.\n\nThe food was overall great! I would give the food 4 stars!\n\nService was terrible. The server was attentive at the beginning, but I think they actually forgot about us towards the end of our meal.

If this is a taste of the restaurant,  well,  I will not recommend for anyone.   The table was at 6:30 - My friend arrived on time while I was stuck on traffic.  At 6:45,  my friend called me and related the menu to me - because the waiter asked her to order the food for all 3 of us - they are back to back booked and cannot wait.  So I had to order over the phone while driving.   I got to the restaurant before 7pm.  I sat down and the waiting began.   The food were delivery one plate at a time to one of us (not all at the same time).  There were long wait before dishes.   Plus,  the table next to me ordered their food after I arrived - they got their appetizer (same dish) before us.  When I asked my waiter, where's our food.  He said,  \"Food will come from kitchen when it does\".   He could not explain and got upset.  He was irritated and offered to check the kitchen.  But he never came back with an answer.   After that,  the busboy served our food and the waiter poured water from time to time.   Let's just say it did not get any better after.   By the time we paid the bill (we paid cash because we could not wait for another 10 minutes for the credit card transaction),  it was 9pm.    I pitied the poor folks who were waiting near the door for their reservation.   We were one of the first seatings of this restaurant.\n\nAlso,  what's this about French food?   It was more like Asian fushion - was this a mislabel?  - Ahi tuna with srirarcha?  For the amount of money I spent (over $60 per person),  I expected more.  This is not it.", "author": "LouLo L."}

One of the reasons I chose Isa out of all the other restaurants was because they offer four courses instead of three like most of the other restaurants on the list. (Foodie much? Yes. Must eat ALL the foods.) \n\nThe restaurant is really pretty. We were led to the back where it's decorated like an outside patio. The lights were dimmed and there were white Christmas lights hung across. Ah it was romantic and intimate. Perfect mood for a date. \n\nFirst course\nCorn soup: Honestly can't remember much about this.\nMaine Lobster Broth: It was rich in flavor and had a few pieces of lobster to chew on. Simple but very flavorful. \n\nSecond course\nSalmon Carpaccio: Omgosh, this dish was de-LICIOUS. I don't remember exactly what our waiter said but it was something along the lines of the salmon not being sold on the market and it's imported from another country. Yes..something like that. Whether I remember correctly or not, I can for sure tell you that salmon was out of this world. Yum! Definitely recommend this dish. \nYellowfin Tuna: This was just as delicious as the salmon carpaccio. If you like raw fish, both of these dishes are perfect for a second course. \n\nThird course\nTruffle Risotto: ABSOLUTELY recommend this dish! If you like truffle, you will love this dish. It's rich in flavor and very heavy so we couldn't eat much of it at once. \nFlat Iron Steak: This was a good choice as well. The steak was grilled to perfection (medium rare) and it went well with the zucchini and roasted potatoes.\n\nFourth course\nWe had the Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e and Semifreddo all' amaretto. Both weren't too special compared to our rest of our meal. \n\nOh and we also took advantage of the $1 oysters! We each had six and they were plump and juicy!

Went with a friend who is a fan of this place.  Now how can I refuse?\n\nMaking reservation was simple but finding a parking is a nightmare especially on a Friday nite in this part of the town.  As I entered, I noted that the place is a bit cramped with very little room to move around just to wait for your table.  Finally we got seated and yet the close proximity from the next table is close to zilch.  But I was glad to see that it is packed which gave me hope that it is a good place to dine.\n\nTheir they gave us the Dine About Town menu which if you haven't already known, showcase the Appetizers, Main entrees and Desserts that they will serve.  My friend and I started with a cocktail.  They were quick and good.  We ordered a sleuth of appetizers to seriously meet our palates for the evening.  \n\nWe ordered the dungeness crab salad, sauteed garlic prawns.  Both were absolutely delish! Next came the skirt steaks and the scallops.  Interestingly, our waiter which had a very heavy french accent did not bother asking us how our steak is done.  It came out bloody raw.  That really was the height of the nite that made me disappointed with this place.  We had two orders that never seemed to come out or want to come out.  So we cancelled that.  We finally ordered desserts which I am not a fan of amaretto or gelato.  They both came out half melted already.\n\nAll in all, quite disappointed with the service along with the ambience. I was told that they have a good size patio out in the back. They used brown paper you often seen when you buy something fragile they wrap with in store as a table cloth.  How plain is that?!!!

We were a group of 15; with reservations, we just waited about 5 minutes. \n\nUnfortunately I came here not-so-hungry along with a few other not-so-hungries. So in order to be able to try more items with our tiny appetites, we decided to share a bunch of starters and entrees. We got mussels, tuna tar tar, grilled calamari, seared scallops with orzo, and truffle risotto. My favorite was the truffle risotto. So rich and flavorful! Mussels and scallops were a tied second. The mussels were perfectly cooked leaving the best garlicy sauce for the bread.\nI'm surprised at how much we all still ate considering how full we were when we got to the restaurant. That's how good everything was!! \n\nAlso I want to mention how great their service was. Although we were a huge group, and some of us picky (and needy) and part of the group sharing a bunch of dishes instead of ordering their own 3-courses, everyone serving us was delightful. They still explained the specials of the days, popular dishes, etc and didn't seem annoyed one bit even when they were constantly talked over. That takes much patience!\n\nI can't wait to come back again and maybe do their prix fix --ballin' on a budget!", "author": "Athena L."}

The service at this place was exceptional, all the servers and waiters were proud of working at this establishment and were always friendly and came to check up on us often.  The only thing is, they don't have a system of splitting up tables between the waiters, so we had a lot of people asking if we'd been helped/if we ordered/ etc, because they didn't know if anyone else had done it yet.  I suppose  its better to get too much service than too little.  \n\nThe food here is amazing!  Chef Eduardo (excuse me if I spelled his name wrong) executed all the dishes beautifully.  I had the endive salad, which was nice and light.  The apples and mandarin oranges balanced out the arugala nicely :).  For the second course we had the salmon carpaccio, which was excellent!! Highly recommend.  I wasn't a huge fan of the crostini that came with the salmon.  The crunchiness of it took away from the texture of the salmon, so I ended up just eating the salmon by itself. :P  Also had the Prince Edward Island mussels, which was light and tomato-y.  Very yummy.  For our main courses, we had the braised short ribs and maple leaf farm duck breast.  Both were absolutely out of this world!  Warning:  both of the entrees were on the heavier/richer side, and very decadent.  The braised short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth good, and very tender and flavorful.  The duck breast was also very tender, slightly rare on the inside, and very fatty, which is to be expected of duck. \n\nThe restaurant was also kind enough to give us vouchers for a free drink for the next time we come in, so we will definitely be back! One of my new favorite restaurants :)", "author": "Kay A."}

They advertise themselves as serving everything \"family style\"/tapas, so order diff things from your companions and for a four course meal with TONS of options for $40, I was sold.\n\nI had the potato leek soup which was ALRIGHT. Not so hot on it, needed more flavour-- but tasted OK with the bread. My boyfriend got the arugula salad which we both liked. The fruit accompanied the salad well and there was a generous portion of shaved Parmesan on top. For the next course, I got the yellowfish tuna tartare which is a really spicy knockoff of Alan Wong's ahi stack. Really good, but reminded me of another (better executed) dish. But since j can't have that all the time, this will do in a pinch. It's REALLY good. My boyfriend got the mussels which were TINY with not a lot of broth, but were perfectly cooked. Wish they used bigger mussels though. I got the truffle risotto for my entree and my boyfriend got  the steak. We liked both a lot, though the truffle risotto should be called a mushroom risotto as the flavour overwhelms it. There are a lot of bits of truffles throughout the risotto though, which I REAAAAALLY liked. I can't really comment on my BF's steak as I only had a bite, but the veggies were cooked wel and deliciously seasoned. Yum :)\n\nOur dessert was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which came out in small ramekins, but was delighted to see that they use vanilla bean (speckles galore!) and that each br\u00fbl\u00e9e had an amazing caramelised crust.\n\nAll in all, super busy restaurant with attentive service that could have only been improved by serving higher quality ingredients and perhaps the service would have been more attentive had the restaurant not been PACKED.

The service was really great -the waiter was patient in taking our order and giving recommendations. The 4 course menu had enough options so we could try a lot of different things.There was also more than enough to eat in terms of portions of each course.  The dishes were good enough so that I was generally satisfied.\n\n1st: We tried the endive salad and the arugula salad, both were fairly simple. The endive salad came with beets and blue cheese in a vinaigrette. The arugula salad had a more savory flavor with the fennel. I think I preferred the second.  \n\n2nd: We tried the yellow-fin tuna and the salmon carpaccio. The tuna was spicy and tasty and reminded me of a Hawaiian poke. The salmon was delicate and sauce was creamy.  Both dishes were fresh and represent the highlight the meal. \n\n3rd: We had the duck and the iron flat steak. Both of these were a bit disappointing to me. The blue cheese sauce atop the steak was a bit too assertive, and I wasn't a huge fan of the cut of flank steak. The greens in the meat sauce were decent. As for the duck,  I would have liked a crisp on the duck. I thought both were cooked medium rare perfectly.\n\n4th: Semifreddo and the creme brulee.  The vanilla brulee was sweet and creamy and the caramelization gave it that nice crunch. The semifreddo had a more subtle sweetness and a nutty flavor.  The cookies that accompanied it were not good.  I thought the brulee was the superior choice.  \n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience. A combination of nice ambience and great service redeemed somewhat average to slightly above average eating. Worth checking out.", "author": "Huy V."}

However, my dinner during SF Restaurant Week was not as awesome as I had hoped.\n\nGranted, the service was excellent (thanks Domingo!) and the waiters were always refilling our waters, however, the food was rather mediocre. For the 1st course, my potato leek soup was pretty bland and my BF's arugula salad was nothing special (seemed like we could've thrown it together ourselves). I did enjoy my salmon carpaccio for my 2nd course while my BF's mussels were... eh. For the main course, I got the truffle risotto (which my BF and I agreed is probably the best dish from our dinner) while my BF got the flat iron steak. The steak was nothing spectacular - the only flavor I tasted was the blue cheese sauce that was drizzled on top. As for dessert, the grapefruit granite was nothing more than grapefruit-flavored shaved ice. The semifreddo was a bit better.\n\nAnother thing to note like many other reviewers had mentioned is the fact that they seem to really rush you along your dinner. There didn't seem to be room for a breather whatsoever. I wished they would slow the pace down a bit so diners could really enjoy their meals and conversations with one another.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and they had a nice backyard patio - perhaps I'd come here for happy hour instead of paying full price for a mediocre, rushed dinner. I somewhat wished I chose a different restaurant to eat at for restaurant week, but hey, I can finally cross this place off my list. Perhaps the food would taste different had it not been restaurant week? You would think that during restaurant week, restaurants are supposed to showcase what their food is all about. If what I tasted is what defines Isa as a restaurant, then I'm very disappointed. Maybe I'll come back for dinner and give them a second chance. Just maybe.\n\nAlso, I don't really understand why it's considered a French restaurant when I didn't see a lot of French elements in their dishes.

Risotto - This was kind of a disappointment. It was rather watery and the amount of cheese made it too rich. In addition, I think that it could have used more flavor from the mushrooms. \n\n5.

My wife and I recently went there on a double date, and we all enjoyed it.\n\nThe setup is interesting.  The restaurant appears to be small and narrow up front, but the back is quite expansive.  In fact, I've only ever sat in the back, which appears to be a backyard patio converted for indoor use.  There looks to be a retractable roof of sorts, but I think they keep it covered year-round.  Heating lamps make the area very cozy.  I actually enjoyed the unique experience of being semi-outdoors much more than dining indoors as is the case with almost every restaurant.\n\nThe food here is served tapas style, so we ordered a bunch of small plates to be shared.  We went on a Sunday, which gave us the opportunity to order from a special, discounted prix fixe menu ($29.95 for 2 courses + dessert) .   However, we opted to \"ball out\" by select several dishes from the regular menu.  We did manage to take advantage of one prix fixe set given the number of items.   The waiter was very helpful in pointing this out for us.\n\nAs I mentioned, we tried a bunch of small plates including:\n\n- The Yellowfin Tuna, which had spice/flavor that I really enjoyed\n- The Endive Frisee Salad, which was just decent in my opinion\n- The Arugula Salad, which was excellent and the better of the two salads we tried\n- The Prawns, which were large in both size and flavor\n- The Rack of Lamb, which was excellent (there were only 3 pieces, so we added a 4th piece pro rata)\n- The spaghetti, which was just OK\n-  The Potato Wrapped Seabass, which we were told was the most famous dish and lived up to its name\n-  and, finally the Mussels, which all but confirmed to me that I have a shellfish allergy albeit limited to mollusks (the rest of the table enjoyed the dish for what it's worth)\n\nThe desserts we ordered were both fantastic:  Creme Brulee and the Semifredd Amaretto.\n\nI'm definitely coming back.", "author": "Sebastian N."}

As I noted before, the restaurant contacted me, saddened at the first experience, and invited us back for another try. The manager/owner greeted us at door, thanked us for coming back, and seated us in a completely different area of the restaurant that I didn't even know existed, a gorgeous tented spot in the back (good for big groups, too!). I was a little concerned that it would be strained having voiced our previous negative experience, but she was gracious and did not discuss it at all.\n\nWe received two glasses of champagne upon seating, and promptly placed our order. I noticed on the menu this time that it stated the dishes came out as ready in a more family style presentation, and the manager emphasized this as well when handing us our menus. Setting this expectation up front made all of the difference, as we ordered things we knew we'd both like and didn't feel like we had to wait for the other person's food. She had mentioned previously that it would be on the house and we didn't want to take advantage of this with ordering lots of drinks, but our server encouraged us to enjoy a drink with our dinner, so we ordered two different chardonnays, and both tasted great.\n\nI started with the smoked salmon, and my boyfriend had the crab salad. Both were delicious, but I liked mine better.  I had ordered it last time as well, and both times it was so fresh and the seasoning/toppings were perfect accompaniments. For my main, I ordered the scallops and my date the teriyaki beef. Again, both were tasty and perfectly prepared, and the sides were very complimentary.\n\nWe were full and tried to decline desserts, but our server insisted on trying the creme brulee and brought us out two dessert drinks with it. We somehow managed to scarf down the dessert as well :) We left a tip for both of our times there, as this more than made up for the last. Thank you Isa for inviting us again; we will be back soon!", "author": "Sarah B."}

We are a table of four, we have a groupon and people ordering from pre-fixe. Why is this a problem?! The waiter simply said \"not allowed\" rolled his eyes, huffed away. We asked for the manager, she basically made every excuse in the book. We asked her unprofessionally dressed self (Jeans and a plaid shirt? Really?) if we should just leave or split our table. She started retracting all her statements. I've seen \"one groupon per table.\" I've seen \"groupon excludes certain items\" but to say that if one person uses a groupon, nobody else at the table can order what they want? Especially when my friend is a regular? Considering the prices, Customer Service Fail. \n\nThat being said, they let us order, switched our waiter to the fabulous Luis. Luis saved this experience for me. He was busy but kind, attentive, professional (unlike the previously mentioned staff...) and just a ton of fun. \n\nWe ordered 11 dishes, 6 glasses of wine. Don't even begin to tell me that they were losing money. \n\nThe food? OMG IT WAS SO GOOD! The menu was fantastic everything was orgasmic. (see pictures for what we had) Being 11 dishes, I'm not going to describe them all, but the highlights for me were: Tuna Tartare, Foie gras, and halibut.   \n\nSince I have tried most things on the menu now, I'm looking forward to what sort of new dishes are to come later in the fall/winter!", "author": "Susan C."}

It is quite good for the reasonable price. Indoor seating is limited, outdoor patio is covered and heated properly. Ambience is good. Its california-french fusion food is true to the taste of its founders a caucasian+asian family. Changing owners did not dilute the great taste of Isa, and many great waiters are retained. This is a good reasonably upscale dining place, good for dates, celebrations, a place to pop champagne and enjoy a good meal. \n\nSalad here are good: arugula salad is light and very much argula oriented with a bit of cheese, not too much distracting dressings, baby lettuce is crispy! Halibut is my dad's favorite fall back, but sometimes it appears to be grilled for two long - a bit of inconsistency over the years. Tuna tartare has always been good. This is somewhat a tapa like place, with medium small size plates meant to be shared across the table.

One of the folks in our party has Celiac disease, so the gluten free aspect of this place was important, for health reasons.  There are only a few items on the menu with an asterisk indicating they contain gluten - so watch out for that - and also the fact that they offer bread (since it is a French restaurant, well duh...).  However, note to all the Celiacs (silly yaks?) out there: You can see when you walk by the kitchen that all the bread is cut in a separate area, well-segregated from the rest of the goings-on.

I definitely appreciated that the bread at our table was replenished quite frequently, that way ensuring that no drop of juice and sauce was wasted. Both the crab salad and the goat cheese with tomato & basil were good, bright, and refreshing dishes. The salmon carpaccio to my disappointment was underseasoned. \n\nMoving on to the main courses, we tried the steak which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Similarly well executed was the baked chicken with its delectable crispy skin. The funghi risotto was spot on. The seared scallops with asparagus and the halibut were the two weaker main dishes \n\nI definitely want to come back as soon as possible.

We decided to do family style to try as many of the second and third courses as possible. They also say that they design those dishes to be shared which made the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nWhat we tried:\n\nLobster Bisque - Absolutely delicious, and not skimpy on the protein either.\n\nPotato Leek Soup - Nice creamy texture. Good flavor too.\n\nSalmon Carpaccio - Generous amounts of salmon served with sides of crostini\n\nYellowfin Tuna Tartare - Fresh raw fish and avocado is always a winning combination in my book.\n\nSteamed Mussels - Served with grilled bread. We kept getting more bread to soak up all the leftover sauce which was simply amazing.  \n\nBaked Goat Cheese - I wasn't a huge fan of this dish, probably because I'm not that into cheese. Two members of our party really liked it though.\n\nSeared Scallops - Probably my favorite entree. Beautifully seared scallops with bacon mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Can't go wrong.\n\nPetrale Sole - Not a huge fan of this dish. Fish had a nice crisp on the outside but it was a little too overcooked for my liking. Beets were pretty tasty though and I'm not generally a fan of beets.\n\nTruffle Mushroom Risotto - Pretty good, didn't think it was that special though. \n\nFlank Steak - Tender and had a good flavor from the sauce.\n\nGrapefruit Granite - Didn't think I would like this but I was pleasantly surprised. Grapefruit flavor was prominent and refreshing.\n\nSemifreddo Amaretto - Not too heavy and not overly sweet. Dessert is my least favorite course though, so I didn't care too much about it.\n\nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee - Pretty good I guess...again, not a huge fan of dessert.\n\nI'm normally not a huge fan of fine/upscale dining due to the smaller more \"refined\" portion sizes.

However, that was the highlight of the attentive service we received. At 6:30 on a Sunday night, the restaurant was about 2/3 full. There were several staff milling around, yet we still had to actively hail down someone to take our order after a 10-minute wait. \n\nThe dishes are meant to be served family style and will arrive as soon as it's ready per Isa staff. Great concept, but the order of how our food came out was plain odd. We got the potato leek soup (Avoid! It's a bland potato mix with bits of parsley. The leek flavor was nowhere to be found.), followed by the salmon carpaccio, then the mushroom truffle risotto, before the yellowtail salad finally made it's way to our table. It does not make sense, and it's a huge no-no, to serve a cold appetizer AFTER a hot entree. We grabbed a server to make the complaint, but all we got was a shrug and \"Well, we can reheat the risotto for you.\" So much for attentive and competent service. \n\nThe food itself was forgetful at best. The creme bulee dessert was probably the best thing on the prie fixe menu. The flat iron steak was flavorable but on the small side, especially when paired with mounds of zucchini and string beans. \n\nWe also ordered the foie gras at $24/serving. It was a disappointing experience. The foie gras tasted greasy from the excessive oil used to sear it. And, it wasn't good quality foie gras either.

The first time I went here the issue was that the service was slow - food took forever to come out. This time around I really didn't like our waitress. I was with a group of 8, and multiple times she stopped by and asked us if we wanted drinks - no, we didn't, and that didn't change throughout the night - to the point where it felt like it was too pushy. Also, not all of us got dessert and she took multiple opportunities to point out that NOT EVERYONE has a dessert. Ok, we get it, lady - not everyone ordered prix fixe, we didn't get drinks, and you want more tip money.

When I first walked in, through the narrow hallway, I thought this was going to be a very small restaurant. Our hostess kept walking through the hallway and lead us out into the gorgeous back patio. The patio is enclosed so you are sheltered from the cold, but Isa has it decorated giving off the impression you are outside. They line the walls and ceiling with small lights giving it a very romantic vibe. If possible, ask to sit outside. Ok, on to the food. \n\nI was not very impressed by the soup (both the lobster broth and potato and leek soup) or the dessert. I ordered the leek soup and the first couple spoonfuls were just too oily. I had a taste of my boyfriend's lobster broth and it was nothing impressive. However, the oysters and braised ribs were delicious. The ribs just fell off the bone and they were very generous with the amount of meat they served.

The waiter totally encouraged us when we were dipping extra bread in the sauce. \n- Salmon Carpaccio \n- Scallops - Not a huge portion but was delicious with mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and bacon\n- Truffle Mushroom Risotto\n- Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee\n\nThe only dish that I didn't really like was the goat cheese appetizer, but I'm not a fan of goat cheese in general so I wasn't expecting to enjoy it much. Other than that, everything we tried was really good!\n\nThis seems like a good place to come and talk while you enjoy your food. Since the kitchen is pretty small and food may take a bit longer to come out, you'll have plenty of time to chat with your dining companions... unfortunately, one of the tables near us was ridiculously loud and rowdy so it was really hard for us to talk and hear each other, but that's probably my only complaint about this place.

I was surprised to find out that they weren't very busy the night we went, which is also very fortunate since we did not make a reservation prior to going. The restaurant is larger than it seems and has a beautiful, sheltered and heated patio at the back. The waiters are warm and courteous, and the food was delicious!\n\nWe ordered the Salmon Carpaccio and the Maine Lobster Broth for our appetizers. My boyfriend absolutely raved about the Lobster Broth and said that he would come to Isa for that alone, while I enjoyed the Salmon Carpaccio as well. The salmon had a hint of lemon, was very fresh, and the textures were amazing. We would order both again. Unfortunately, they were out of the Dungeness Crab Salad when we went, but we are definitely going to try that next time.\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the Truffle Risotto while my boyfriend ordered the Flat Iron Steak. The Truffle Risotto was amazing. The texture of the risotto was just right, and the mushrooms were delectable. It reminded me very much of Lupa Trattoria's Fettuccine Tartufate, which is just about my absolute favorite pasta dish that I've had in all my 25 years of life (but that's a review for another time). The Flat Iron Steak was also very delicious, and reminded me of the steak frites from Le Relais de l'Entrec\u00f4te in Paris since the moutarde verte that they topped the steak with is very similar to the ones from Le Relais. You can also choose other side dishes to come with the steak, but I highly recommend sticking to the moutarde verte. You can't go wrong! \n\nFor dessert I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake. This is probably my one disappointment, but only because I was expecting a very dense chocolate cake like the ones they serve at The House (which is mindblowingly amazing). I could tell that the cake was straight out of the oven though as it was piping hot and incredibly fresh. It was a more spongy cake than I would have liked, but it was served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and I enjoyed myself despite my expectations.\n\nOverall, this restaurant just shot up to one of my top 5 places to eat in San Francisco, and I have lived here for 4 years now.

Our \"main\" server (and I say that as he stated they are all our wait staff) was very charming and informative.  Here's the breakdown:\n\n1st course\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque.  It was delicious.  Try it with the bread.  I ran into another friend there too who stated the leek soup was not as good.\n\n2nd course\nI had the mussels.  The mussels itself were ok. The sauce though I really enjoyed.  Especially with the bread it came with.  My friend and I were lapping it up.  She ordered the crab salad that was refreshing.  I was expecting more flavors but I guess it couldn't be as rich as the sauce I had with the mussels.\n\n3rd course (where we diverged)\nMy friend received her Grilled golden gate natural angus Flat iron steak with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce first.  It was...disappointing.  The steak was way too salty.  That stood out too much for its own good.  And weirdly enough, the bordelaise sauce made the rest of the steak almost taste like duck.  It was a very uncomfortable course.  It was a very small cut of steak to begin with and she could only stomach eating less than half of it. Yikes! \n\nI had the Maple leaf farm Duck breast with baby spinach, pinenuts, currants, bacon & sherry vin sauce which was a much better course.  The duck was also a bit salty but not as much as the steak.  The spinach and currents were a good compliment.  It also came with a type of potato hash/pancake thing that did not work with the dish.\n\n4rd course\nMy Semifreddo all'amaretto was delicious but i LOVE amaretto.  My friend's Vanilla bean creme brulee was...underwhelming.  It was just a bit bland.\n\nOn to service, I had to ask for more water and remind them of our bread request twice.  I also requested a cup of coffee to have with my dessert.  They never brought it.  After our desserts were done I told the same waiter to cancel my coffee request then he stated \"Oh yea! I'm sorry I forgot about that.\" So yea...\n\nEither case, for $37.95 for a four course meal, it was a good deal.  I don't know if I would eat here otherwise.

Our whole party ordered through the 3 course Prix Fix Menu for $29.95 per person only available Sunday thru Thursday. The waiter said these dishes are created like Tapas so we could share. I was shocked at the portions, its quite generous for tapas.\n\nFor my 1st course I ordered the Smooth Potato Leek Soup with parsley, chives & cream. This has a very frothy, and I also tasted Truffle Oil. It tasted the best when you dip bread into the soup.\n\nFor my 2nd course I ordered the Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce. I absolutely love this dish and I loved the sauce. The steak was delish; however, next time I might order it medium rare. The fingerling potatoes were cooked to perfection also had a nice little sear on it to as crunch when you bite in.\n\nFor my desert I originally ordered the Semifreddo all' amaretto but since I was so full from the appetizer and entree I decided to change it to the Grapefruit granite which is more like a icy sorbet. The Grapefruit granite was not the best tasting for me but that's because I've never been a fan of grapefruit. every bite was flavorful I tasted sweet, sour and bitter at the same time. I had a taste of the Semifreddo all' amaretto with is a gelato with Macaroons and I prefer this desert more. \n\nSince it was my cousins birthday they gave her a complimentary Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e.

I ordered off of the fixed menu and tried the following:\n\nSteamed Prince Edward island mussels - ok. Not terrible but not anything special. They were very mini itty bitty mussels.\n\nOrganic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio - really good. but how can you mess up smoked salmon on toasted bread anyway?\n\nTruffle risotto - was just ok. There was a lot of hype for this dish on yelp but I didn't find it anything special. And yes, I'm a fan of truffled anything but this dish just wasnt worth the calories for me.\n\nPan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range chicken - the piece I had was amazingly tender and crispy and I usually don't get fried chicken because it tends to be dry. However, the part of the chicken my boyfriend had was dry so I guess it's a hit or miss.\n\nSemifreddo all' amaretto - my boyfriend and I did not like this one at all. I am a huge dessert fan and really wished that there were more options that were actually appealing. This dessert really just tasted like bad old cream that had been sitting out.\n\nDespite the food being just ok, I still really enjoyed my dinner, the ambiance, the service, and would be willing to try other items on the menu to give the food another shot and maybe I'll have to tried their soju cocktails :)", "author": "Sandy T."}

The wood floors and walls, the dim lighting, the heat lamps are all amazing. It's more spacious than the inside restaurant, but still warm with the heat lamps. Perfect for large parties as well. \n\nFOOD:  served FAMILY STYLE\nThe prix fixe menu was fantastic. We had a party of 3 but since this place serves everything family style, we got 2 prix fixe orders, and an extra order of seared scallops. \n\nSCALLOPS\nSeared scallops with asparagus, potato puree & truffle jus de poulet. This was an expensive dish, but absolutely amazing. The scallops were cooked to perfection, melting in your mouth, and seasoned nicely. The potatoes were lightly salted and paired perfectly. \n\nSALMON CARPACCIO\nOrganic Loch Duart Salmon carpaccio with lemon, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cucumber, egg, capers & crostini. This is a delicious appetizer. So light, but still flavorful, i wanted to eat the whole thing by myself. \n\nCORN, LEEK, POTATO SOUP\nSmooth summer white corn, leek & potato soup with saut\u00e8ed corn, parsley & chives. This wasn't my favorite dish. We used the bread and dipped it in the soup instead. It was nice, warm, and unique, but we didn't eat much of it. \n\nHALIBUT\nNorthern Halibuta la plancha with olive oil, parsley, nicoise olives, zucchini, artichoke & tomato confit. By far my favorite entree. The halibut fell apart as soon as my fork touched it. It was soft, flaky, and absolutely amazing with the mandarin oranges.\n\nFLAT IRON STEAK\nGrilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak with zucchini, potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce. Very tender steak. I was really full by the time we got to the steak, so the fact that the meat is not that big, and cut up for us into smaller pieces, was a huge plus!\n\nGRAPEFRUIT GRANITE\nDelicioussssss. It's just shaved ice with grapefruit flavoring. Can't really justify the price, but since it's part of the prix fixe, and so refreshing, i was quite happy. \n\nSEMIFREDDO ALL' AMARETTO\nVanilla bean ice cream, amaretto, and biscotti. We loved this dessert as well. The light vanilla with the perfect touch of ameretto was amazing. Perfect finish.\n\nCAPPUCCINO / CAFE\nI think they serve Cafe Roma. I thought it wasn't as smooth as Illy or Lavazza, but it did the job. \n\nWINE: \nStephen Vincent 2007 Crimson\nWe got a bottle and it was such a good price. I normally expect wines to be $50-60 for a bottle, but this was about $35. Pleasantly surprised and happy since their wine list was quite impressive.", "author": "Debby L."}

The oysters were incredibly fresh and served with a spicy orange mignonette. If you are into oysters, these are a must! The mignonette is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with the salty oyster. The yellowfin tuna was also a great dish, which was served much like a tuna tartare with a little spice. The yellowfin was simple, yet beautifully done. \nFor our main course, I got the flatiron steak and my boyfriend got the scallops. Both dishes were great! The steak was cooked to perfection and incredibly juicy. \nLastly, for dessert we ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Oh.my.lanta! It was delicious.

Doesn't start any better with this gem of a restaurant in the Chestnut/Marina area. I would describe this food as a French restaurant with some Asian sensibilities mixed in. I was on my way to meet my group of friends including Nina V. (San Diego Yelper!), arrived by the 30 bus and was already late as I made the dash up Steiner street. I looked up at the sign and saw Isa, but for some idiotic reason I ran into the restaurant at 3340. I spent about 5 minutes arguing with the server about there being a table of 11 before I realized, I was in the wrong restaurant! FML\n\nHumped it up the street to the REAL Isa and there they were waiting for me. Friends with fizz faces. As in they were already getting there drink on at the bar. The setting was dark in the front and a very intimate feel perfect for meeting people and getting some happy hour drinks. But if you reserve a table for dinner you will most likely be ushered to the back where there is a back room enclosed garden with a good  number of tables under a sunroof.\n\nI don't necessarily recommend this, but I next to 2 other friends and we ordered a sampling of dishes only for the three of us.\n\nWe started off with Arugala Salad, Hudson valley grade A foie gras with Mango and beets instead of the Pears and Huckleberry. For main course dishes we tried the Seared Scallops, Truffle Risotto, Rocky Roasted Chicken, Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast. I must have really fatty taste because I really enjoyed the foie gras and the combination with mango and beats was strangely satisfying. The piece of foie gras was also the size of a piece of filet mignon! If you are looking to get your foie gras fixe before it becomes outlawed in California 1 July 2012, then this is definitely the place to try it. Second favorite dish was the Truffle Risotto, because it just setup shop in your mouth with so much buttery'ness. The duck breast was also cooked very well, on the moist and rare side, how I prefer it. The food overall was very good!\n\nThe server for our table was extremely courteous and helpful in deciding between dishes. However, it was a nightmare at the end of the meal trying to determine how much each person owed, especially when my separate group of three ordered the most food. One waiter explained that they would only accept a split check with 3 cards. That just seemed ridiculous, so we asked another waiter and he overruled our waiter and made things happen. The meal came out to be $50/per our group of 3. This was seems like quite a lot, but in perspective for how much food we ordered, seems reasonable.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience and would not hesitate to take a date or my parents for a special birthday occasion.

Family style\n2. Bread\n\nLet me explain. The whole concept of Isa is French food served family style. We had a group of 6 and each of us were able to try at least fifteen things on the menu because we all shared every single dish. Of course, there was 1 dish that we all agreed was \"meh\", which was the crab salad. However...the rest of the dishes were A+ phenomenal. This is where the word \"Bread\" comes in.\n\nThe bread was great. If I had to guess it was Acme bread, and boy was there a lot of it. The best part was that every time we got more bread, it came out piping hot. The bread itself was 3-4 star worthy, but what made me realize that Isa was so amazing was that out of the fifteen or so dishes we ordered, I dipped the bread into the remaining juices/sauce/crumbs of each dish and they elevated the bread to a delicious, almost addicting hors d'oeuvre. That's what made me put Isa on a pedestal. It could take an ordinary piece of bread and turn it into an extraordinary delectable bite.\n\nThis example only serves to highlight the extraordinary flavors characteristic of every appetizer, entree, and dessert we ordered. Our favorites:\n\n1. Potato crusted sea bass\n2. Yellowfin Tuna\n3. Rack of Lamb\n4. Grapefruit Granite\n\nI can't wait to come back here. I would highly recommend coming with a group of friends, but otherwise enjoy indulging :)", "author": "Brian L."}

We were about twenty minutes late for our reservation (although we called to let them know we were running late). The host was very amicable although he did let us know that we only had about an hour and a half because they had another seating (slight minus points because the front of the restaurant was half empty -- he could have spared us the guilt trip).\n\nNonetheless we were ushered into the back area where there was a whole 'nother world of intimately squished tables 'neath a tented patio amongst outdoor heaters and a fun, festive environment. The back area was full of Dine About Towners and our waiter handed us the menu options of the day.\n\nFor my options, I chose:\n\n1. Pt Reyes Oysters on the half shell  (fresh. oh so fresh. Had that slight brininess of fresh ocean. Went down real smooth.)\n\n2. Lobster Broth with Tiger Prawn. (very tasty indeed)\n\n3. Seared Scallops with mashed potatoes, bacon, brussel sprouts and truffle sauce. The scallops were perfectly cooked. The bacon added that depth of flavor and the brussel sprouts (have I told you that's my new favorite \"sepcial\" vegetable?)\n\n4. Grapefruit Granite. Mmm.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-30", "description": "I have lived in the bay area for 8+ years now, and had never before taken advantage of Restaurant Week. This year, I tried two restaurants - most recently, Isa. I went by myself, and had an 8:30pm reservation. I arrived about 30mins early, and asked if I could be seated early. They let me sit at the bar, which wasn't a great spot, but it was very convenient as it was near the kitchen.\nFor the $40 prix fixe menu during Restaurant Week, they gave a pretty good selection of menu items to choose from. I went with the potato-leek soup, mussels, duck breast, and creme brulee. \nFirst course was the soup, cup-size. The few pieces of bacon that were in the soup, really did set the tone for the flavor. It was a solid start, comforting and warm, with a smooth texture.\nSecond course = mussels. I've seen reviews where people were unhappy with the size of the mussels. I would say if this is the normal size of the dish, then I probably would not order it off the regular menu. But I got 6-7 good spoonfuls of mussel, after removing them from the shells from the onset. And as a prix fixe dish, I think that was adequate enough for me.\nMain entree was duck, I think it was prepared medium rare. It was served with a huckleberry sauce, which made it more diffcult to tell how rare it was. In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The meat was delectable and easy to cut, and I am a big fan of beets so the beet salad was a nice accompaniment. \nFor dessert, I wavered between the semifreddo and the creme brulee. My server recommended the brulee, so that's what I went with. The sugar top layer was pretty good, probably the best part of the dish. But overall it was a solid dessert, although next time I'd likely go for the semifreddo.\nFor $40, plus a drink plus tip, this was a very good deal. The overall portion sizes were perfect for me, it filled me up without causing the need for a doggy bag. Next time I come I will likely bring friends or eat at a table rather than the bar, which lacked a bit of ambience although probably sped up the pace of my dining experience.", "author": "Steven Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-05", "description": "Came here for \"Dine About Town\" 2015 with a group of my girl friends! \n\nIt was a 4-course prix fix dinner for $40 and I think it was well worth the pricetag, especially compared to the other list of restaurants around this caliber. We also went during happy hour (I think Everyday from 5:30-7, $5 any cocktail on their HH list!) so we started off with some drinks and were brought some delicious bread and butter to the table. \n\nI got: \n\n-Arugula Salad: It was well dressed and a light start to the dinner, but i didn't find it too special. I also enjoyed it because I generally like arugula, but for those who are particular to it might not like it as much since it does get a bit peppery and bitter\n\n-Yellowfin Tuna Tartare: I thought this was great! It had great big chunks of raw tuna, and I could tell the fish was fresh. It was topped on avocado and had some seaweed surrounding it. It was well dressed (I liked the sriracha addition as it gave the dish a nice kick!) and I loved the seaweed salad around it. Overall, great dish but again, nothing spectacularly different from other tartare dishes you would find elsewhere (it actually reminded me more of poke)\n\n-Braised Short Rib: This dish was accompanied by mashed potatoes, broccolini, and a carrot. I really enjoyed this dish and felt that the sauce around it made the whole dish taste very comforting and delicious. The broccolinis were cooked to my liking, and I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes but some of my other fellow friends thought the mashed potatoes could use a bit more seasoning (I do agree the mashed potatoes were a bit bland, but I felt the sauce on the dish made it more flavorful and I personally would prefer underseasoned than overseasoned). The short rib was spectacular in that it was soft, moist, and fell apart. \n\n-Creme Brulee: It was good, but again, not a dish that was unique or \"different\". The caramelized sugar on top was kind of thick, which I enjoyed but others might find it too crunchy/overwhelming. What I did like about it is that it wasn't as sweet as other creme brulee desserts I've had at other restaurants, but still rich. I also really liked the fact that they used real vanilla beans (you could see the vanilla bean specks all settled at the bottom of the dish) \n\nThe waiters told us that the dishes were \"family style\" and meant to be shared and kept insisting on us to try each other's dishes (dishes came out as they were prepared so for the entree, some of the girls' dishes came out about 10-15 minutes faster than the other half of the girls) but the dishes aren't huge that you HAVE to share, but big enough to fill you up!\n\nOverall Verdict: The food was well executed, hearty, and tasty, but none of the dishes were really unique or interesting. For the price and the quantity/quality of food though, it was definitely worth it. Therefore, I'll probably be back some time in the future, but probably not anytime soon given that there are so many other restaurants in SF that offer more of a food palate experience that I still need to explore!", "author": "Judy B."}

As the hostess takes us to our seat (outside in the patio), I understood. I loved the outside patio. It was so spacious and open. \n\nEverything I had was exceptional. I had the Yellowfin Tuna with avocado and sriracha, which melted in my mouth and had just the right amount of heat. I also had the potato leek soup and the shortribs which fell right off the bone.

If you come without one, good luck to you. We were intrigued by their Dine about town menu and they were only serving from that menu the day we went. They mentioned they had the best DAT menu out there and I thought that to be a very bold claim but they have the skills to back the claim up. We were seated out in the back in a tent canopy type thing and it was really cute and heat lamps helped keep us warm. Our server was friendly and gave us no problems opening up the wine bottle we brought (corkage fee $20). \n\nTheir DAT menu features 4 courses. For most of the menu they serve the food family style, so essentially if you go with a date, you both get 8 courses and that's a fantastic deal. For starters we got the lobster broth with shrimp. The broth was fantastic and flavorful that went well when you soaked the amazing warm bread they bring you. The shrimp was overcooked a bit but the broth made you forget all about that. The next course was a salmon carppaccio that came with crostinis. Very fresh fish and the sauce on it made me enjoy the capers on it, I hate capers normally. They also offer $1 oysters so we got half a dozen to split. Very tasty with the house made vinegar but they run small. Next course was mussels with toasted olive oil bread and the clams were fresh and the broth was amazing to soak up the bread. So many broths which are all amazing on their own but you take it to a whole other level by soaking bread in them. So good. The next course was a truffle risotto with mushrooms. THE BEST RISOTTO I HAVE EVER HAD! No joke. I thought the best was made by Gordon Ramsey when I went to his LA restaurant, but no this flavor was way better. Granted Ramsey had better cooked risotto but the the flavor at Isa is unmatched so you didn't notice if some rice was undercooked/overcooked here or there. That's when you know you have something special, even if it isn't cooked perfectly, the flavor alone makes up for it. It was that good. I will go back to just order bowls of the stuff. The other entree was seared scallops with Brussels sprouts and bacon. Scallops were cooked perfectly, the sprouts were good even though I generally hate them but with bacon and mashed potatoes you can't really go wrong. One of the best scallops I've had in a while.\n\nFor dessert we ordered some amaretto frozen custard with cookies and it was really fricken good. So creamy and flavorful and it was still light. Very nice. The next dessert was goat cheese with honey and walnut and bread. Some people don't think cheese can be dessert, well I don't want to be your friend then. Heck yes, it's dessert and my girl can only eat so much cheese in one sitting so I pretty much had the whole thing to myself. I'm lactose intollerant but honey badger don't care. Cheese all up in my mouth and belly. It was so amazing! Overall this restaurant does have the best DAT menu in SF and they know it. The service was great, even when the bread wasn't gone they would immediately fill it up with new bread. They were on point and the food was to die for. Very romantic restaurant if you an sit outdoor in the patio area. My girl said \"the food game is strong with this restaurant.\" I have to agree strongly. If I could choose one restaurant to eat at once a week for the rest of my life. I might come here. Best DAT meal and experience I've ever had. Beats out DAT last year and beats out any of Oakland's and Los Angeles' restaurant weeks I've been to, including Gordon Ramsey. So amazing.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

I also went to Fringale (not so good...), but Isa is definitely the winner in my Dine about Town experience. \n\nLet's just start with service. I had an 8:15pm reservation on a Sunday night, came in 30 minutes early, and they seated us 10 later. It was busy but I think with the awesome service they had, people rarely had to wait during their dining experience. There was seating in the front and back of the house, I prefer the back b/c it feels more cozy, warm and less busy than the front. \n\nAppetizers: Dungeness Crab Salad and Salmon Carpaccio (they were out of mussels... boo). My favorite was the crab salad. It was the perfect first course. Light, refreshing and not over powered with vinaigrette. There were slices of apple, avocado, and grapefruit. Though I wish there was more grapefruit, I still enjoyed it overall. The salmon carpaccio was the bf's fav. I though it was good. It tasted fresh, and not over whelming with the sauce. \n\nEntrees: Duck breast and flat iron steak. We ordered medium rare... and they seriously mean it! At some restaurants I order medium rare to get it pink in the middle, but nope, this joint does it precisely to the description! Look at my pictures, they were perfect! Our favorite was definitely the duck. The steak wasn't anything special, I wish we tried the risotto or the scallops but the bf didn't want to pass up steak -.-'' \n\nDessert: Semifredo amaretto and vanilla bean creme brulee. The semifredo came with amaretto ice cream and cookies. This was definitely very delicious but quite sweet. After eating a few bites of this and trying the creme brulee, we couldn't taste the sugar in the creme brulee, haha. The creme brulee was very good, I appreciated the thick layer of sugar on top with vanilla bean at the bottom. \n\nService: OMG this is my favorite part. My top five places for best service, no joke! I actually enjoyed overtipping them. Our server didn't bother us much, came by to ask if we needed more wine or the occasional \"how's everything?\" What really set the record was their actions, our bread basket was never empty! They didn't even ask if we wanted more bread, just refilled it :D Our water was never near empty, always refilled when less than 50%. Plates were cleared immediately. After our entrees were finished, they removed the place mats to reveal a clean table for dessert. Seriouly, BEST SERVICE EVER! \n\nI am definitely coming back, even if it's not Dine about Town.

It almost tasted like the chef poured clarified butter on top. Amaretto dessert was delicious.  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e could have used a bit more rich, creamy, vanilla flavor. That's what makes creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars.  I'd go back for the happy hour & maybe a few appetizers.", "author": "Kate G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-11", "description": "Eight years ago I criticized Isa for settling into an uninspired groove a few years after a high concept critics-pleasing opening. Eight years later I'm back for Dine About Town and and they're on the same groove, only every last detail is two steps better, proves a point about finding your groove and sticking with it. Isa s now a can't fail, always a good time, delicious, go-to restaurant for dates, family, non-fancy special occasions.\n\nThe tent out back is the place to go day or night, hot or cold, rain or shine. On an unusually hot SF summer day after the Union Street Fair the breeze and shade in here was cooler than anywhere else indoors or out.\n\nEvery last patron had the dine-about-town menu, that included $1 oysters all night, very decent $5 wines, and a list of French-American comfort food with Asian touches. Salmon carpaccio was stellar (prepared with traditional salmon or caviar accompaniments: egg cubes, capers, toasted bread rounds, etc), as were the mussels (with a surprise guest of roasted jalapenos). I never would have ordered a butter leaf salad on my own but that was the stand-out of the night, an education in how you're supposed to treat lettuce leaves. This is not an accident, making a good salad is harder than you think. The short rib was  a perfect melt in your mouth crowd pleaser.The only ho-hum was my scallop dish. It was cooked just right but the concept didn't work for me, a bed of corn kernels and orzo didn't really dance together.\n\nNot the standout, but the girl you come home to, is the humble grapefruit granite dessert, which has been on the menu since the beginning and the food critics first raved about, which is why I ever came here in the first place. A dairy-free frozen ice that's _supposed_ to have noticeable ice crystals in it, it's now got a more pronounced does of fresh mint, a perfect ending to the night, I could have this five times a week and never grow tired. The creme brulee was solid too. \n\nFinal score, of 8 dishes 7 were minor hits, nothing so amazing that you stand up and rip your shirt off because it's another planet, but each had a hint of inspiration about it, not bad for a Sunday night, chef's day off. Like I said, solid.\n\nTwo more notes. First, the portion size is inconsistent. Perhaps by design, but some dishes in the same category are 2-3X more filling than others. Mussels and salmon carpaccio are both appetizers for about the same price, mussels could be a small meal on their own, but salmon (though generous carpaccio-wise) is a tiny snack.\n\nSecond, a special shout-out to our waiter, Dean. He really made our night. He's been working here 7 1/2 years now, and has such an enthusiasm, happiness, and genuine spirit, you can't help but smile and be happy with him. We asked why he was so happy and he said it made him happy to work here. Damn. He was like a unicorn waiting your table.", "author": "Gil S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-02", "description": "I came here for Dine About Town week this past Thursday and I was so happy we chose ISA! For $36.95 we got 4 courses: soup, salad, main course, and dessert. \n\nAmbiance: Impeccable! A perfect environment to go have a nice, intimate meal with your girlfriend or special someone. Although it looks small on the outside, there is ample seating inside, a full bar, and a beautiful outdoor patio sort of seating area. The seating area outside is full of lamp heaters, so unlike other places where you are only warm if you are right next to one of the heaters, the whole seating area was warm and cozy! The patio was lit with beautiful lights and just instantly made you feel at home and comfortable. \n\nService: Again, impeccable! Our server was kind and explained all the different menu items to us, especially because many of them had french words in the titles. Our food came out at perfect intervals, with one exception. My sister got her main course atleast 10 minutes before I got mine, which wasn't a big deal since we shared everything anyways. The only thing that came very late was my mojito that I ordered right when I got inside ($5 cocktails before 7pm, yes please!). The mojito came after the bread and the salad course, so it took quite a bit of time. Besides that, our waiter was charming and sweet! \n\nFood: \nSoup: Smooth Potato and Leek Soup with parsley, chives & cream --This was a nice soup to get started with. I've never had potato and leek soup, so it was different. I wish it was a little more flavorful (read: more salty or even spicy) but it was nice to dip the bread in. \nSalad: Arugula salad with fuji apples, persimmon, fennel, lemon vinaigrette & parmesan --This was delicious! I loved the flavors of the vinagrette with the fruits and arugula is my favorite, so I devoured this salad!\nMain Course: \n1. Truffle risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano --I loved the baby shiitake mushrooms in this dish, added so much texture and flavor! The risotto was a little bland for my taste. Not sure if this is because the flavors from the salad were so powerful, but the risotto needed more seasoning and again, salt or spices. Something to give it direction perhaps? Not a bad dish, just not something I would order again. \n2.  Spaghetti with himalayan truffles, tomatoes, basil & parmesan cheese -- Very simple spaghetti dish. I guess you can't make spaghetti that amazing since it is a pretty simple dish, but the marinara sauce was definitely more flavorful than the risotto or soup dishes that I had previously, so I enjoyed that! \nDessert:  Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e -- MMM still dreaming about this dessert. The top was crisp and golden brown, and below was the creamiest, mousse type vanilla pudding. I was in love. Although I was so so full after the risotto, my creme brulee disappeared in minutes. \n\nVerdict: I would say the food was 3.5 stars, probably because although this was the most vegetarian friendly and appetizing looking menu for me, the dishes did not have as much promise. The risotto needed more flavor and the spaghetti was very simple. So I'd say it's party because it's a French restaurant, so their specialty isn't making delicious vegetarian dishes but rather more meat based ones. But regardless, the other courses were great and left us completely satisfied! Service + ambiance made it a solid 4 star experience. \n\nTips: \n+parking is hard in the marina--the garage we found was $2 an hour, change only but really turned out to be about $4 in hour (ugh). \n+get drinks before 7! Glasses of wine & cocktails are only $5--what a steal! \n+yummy free bread and butter to start with! :)", "author": "Anu P."}

Requested the patio for seating, but they had large parties that night and were unable to accommodate this request. I appreciate that they called me to notify me about it.\n\nI recommend reserving about 45 minutes to find parking, because it took us way too long to find a spot. It took almost an hour.\n\nSeating-wise, we were seated at a tall 4-person table and every time I tried to move or get off the chair to use the restroom, I hit the candle holder on the wall. The restaurant was incredibly noisy, so it was difficult to have a nice meal. \n\nI ordered the lobster broth as my starter, the salmon carpaccio as my second dish, the duck as my entree, and creme brulee for dessert. I also tried the steak, mussels, and dungeness crab salad. \n\nEveryone said the lobster broth tasted like the sea. The prawn inside was pretty good, but I didn't think the broth itself was spectacular. I did not like the crostinis that came with the salmon carpaccio. The duck was pretty good, not as gamey as I thought it'd be. Creme brulee was well, creme brulee..it's hard to mess up.\n\nThe dungeness crab salad was quite refreshing. The dressing was kind of unnecessary though. The mussels were almost raw (yuck, I only like mussels from Marica). The steak had a strange taste (actually, both duck and steak, but moreso the steak). It seems they used a blowtorch to cook it or finish it. No one really enjoyed the steak.\n\nService was friendly and very informative, as well as funny. Our server was explaining how DAT works to all the tables he went to with a friendly attitude. The busboys were quick with clearing things off the table and bringing dishes to us.\n\nOverall, I must say I'm disappointed by the taste of the food. I was expecting to be blown out of the water and I was not. Perhaps I should have tried Luce instead. ):", "author": "M C."}

Unlike the other Dine About Town restaurants, which had three courses, this one had four. But don't be fooled by the numbers! Remember, it's quality over quantity!\n\nOur first course was smooth potato and leek soup and main lobster broth with prawns were both disappointments. Both looked like soapy water and plastic bowls, and looked unappetizing. The lobster broth tasted like REALLY watered down imitation lobster.\n\nFor our second course, we got dungeness crab salad and yellowfin tuna. The dungeness crab salad included large leaves of greens that made it extremely hard to eat, slices of grapefruit in the salad were overpowering, and the crab was tasteless. The yellowfin tuna was average - nothing special, but a touch of soy sauce would have been nice.\n\nOur third course was seared scallops and braised short ribs. These entrees came in big plates for sharing. The seared scallops was underwhelming. The scallops sat on top of brussels sprouts, bacon, and mashed potatoes. It felt like something you could make at home like a prepackaged meal from a supermarket. The braised short ribs weren't bad though. The meat was tender and pretty flavorful.\n\nLastly, for desserts, we had the semifreddo all' amaretto and a vanilla bean creme brulee. The semifreddo all' amaretto tasted weird like chemicals and was pretty unappetizing. The creme brulee was just average.\n\nWe sat in the back patio of the restaurant where the tables were fairly close to one another. You could easily eavesdrop on other conversations if you wanted to. Service was great though - one of the waiters was very adamant about making sure our water glasses were filled to the brim.\n\nOverall, the place was below average. We definitely won't be coming back, especially for their regular menu. The dishes were too simple and not worth the money.", "author": "NoonNarin N."}

So instead of ordering one entree/pp, we ended up splitting 6 different dishes and ended up spending 2x as much as I had intended.  Ultimately still a fantastic meal but it will cost you big bucks.  Also, stock up on bread b/c you're going to want to mop up a lot of these plates.\n\n1st tier of awesome: the foie gras with strawberries, rhubarb & brioche, the veal sweetbreads, and the mushrooms.  Normally not a big fan of foie gras in the few times that I've had it but this shit blew my mind partly b/c the sauce is divine.  They basically made a homemade jam that goes so well w/ the fatty liver.  #1 plate to mop up w/ bread.  The sweetbreads, which I found out are usually either thymus or pancreas (delicious!), were also special.  And the local mushrooms were the best mushrooms I've ever had - there were a variety of maybe 4-5 different types all simply sauteed w/ garlic but made me want to steal their garden.\n\n2nd tier of awesome: potato wrapped seabass, oysters with spicy orange mignonette, and the flat iron steak.  These were all good but not on the same level as the ones above.  Stupid Yelp for highlighting the steak - don't get me wrong, it's perfectly well done but it is nothing special when you look at the rest of the dishes.  \n\nTime to starve for all of next week.", "author": "Derrick C."}

So I'll write my review to give warning of what may happen if you go on an off night.\n\nMy theory is that the restaurant was understaffed, and the person in the kitchen either didn't know what they were doing, or didn't care. \n\nI know for a fact that the restaurant was understaffed, because there was only one server for the whole front restaurant, who was also the bartender. And this was on a busy night. Isa's been doing Dine About Town for years now, they should be able to foresee proper staff usage, even if it is a Wednesday. I understand the concept of ordering all at once and bringing food out as it comes ready. But when you're a group of two, and my soup is well on its way to room temp by the time his salad comes out, it just makes for awkward times. It really should not take over two hours for 2 people to eat from a prix fixe menu.\n\nAs for my theory about the kitchen, the execution frankly sucked. My duck was well done on one edge, and medium rare on the other, with chewy tendons attached, and no knife besides the one for the butter available. I had to borrow my date's steak knife. He also had the same doneness problems with his flank steak, only the range was from medium-well to rare (raw). All the flavor combinations were great, but those were from things prepared in advance, not made to order.\n\nSo though everyone else says Isa is awesome, I highly doubt that I will return.", "author": "Amanda S."}

Stop.  Eating.

Almost all of dishes on the regular menu were available, so there were options for every taste.\n\n-- The Salmon Carpaccio was amazingly fresh.  The slices were served at just the right temperature - not too hot, not too cold.  The capers and cr\u00e8me fraiche were a light complement, as to not overpower the salmon.\n\n-- The Angus Flat Iron Steak was cooked perfectly tender and pre-sliced - fancy!  The green beans were firm and crunchy.  The long fingerling potatoes were delicious and almost upstaged the steak for the main course.\n\n-- The Foie Gras (+$22) was a huge slab and definitely a good bang for your buck.  I didn't like the poached pears and huckleberry sauce, as I think I prefer salty to sweet.  (I'm more of a fan of flavorful pate than foie gras.)

I was definitely not disappointed.\n\nPortions are very generous! For a very classy, expensive restaurant, one would normally assume small portions. Not Isa. I was very very happy with this. We all left stuffed!\n\nWe ordered almost everything on the menu and just shared it. The duck was my favorite. It has got to be the best duck I've ever had in my life - and I'm Asian. We eat lots of duck. The duck was just so well cooked that it melted in my mouth. For someone that eats quite a bit of duck, I can safely say that it doesn't normally melt.\n\nThe scallops, however, seemed a little plain. It was good - just not amazing, which was what I expected from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nOverall, for the price I paid, the portions I got, and the fine ambiance, this is 5 stars in my book. I would definitely come back, especially if they have deals like this again.\n\nThinking back to this makes me drool too much so I'll end the review here.", "author": "Anh T."}

My friend had her wedding reception here and even the food for a group of 50+ was delish!  \n\nI came here for my foie gras send off dinner and I left quite satisfied. We had the foie gras with strawberry and rhubarb compote and a custard brioche.  I did hear that the pear one was better, but I still enjoyed the strawberry one.  The seared foie was so delicious on the brioche and smothered in the sauce.  We did a wine pairing but our server recommended a different one then what was on the menu and it was a great pairing.  \n\nI went on a Sunday so we ordered one prix fixe menu and picked off the menu.  We  ordered the angus flat iron steak, Loch Duart salmon carpaccio, and potato wrapped seabass.  Unfortunately there was a mistake somewhere and we didn't get our seabass.  =(  The bf was very disappointed, but our server Jonathan was very nice and apologetic.  Since the kitchen was closed, he could only send us  dessert.  He sent out the chocolate cake and a slice of Point Reyes blue cheese.  The cake was okay.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but the cheese was very creamy and rich; I'm sure I would have loved it if I liked blue cheese. The grapefruit granite was so refreshing and perfect! \n\nI'll definitely be back since all the food is pretty good and I really want to try that seabass!

The dishes are meant to share and are served from lightest to heaviest, so we all got a taste of everything.

I am always skeptical of a \" mystery wine\". Very very juicy and Jammie and cherries quite good, actually as wine on HH is usually not good at all. The scallops with asparagus was something I cud imitate at home so not outstanding. Just simple saut\u00e9 with what tasted like basalmic reduction. I can make better Brussel sprouts as there was no carmelization of the garlic and I guess scallions as they were still a bit raw but I guess that was done on purpose. I don't like overlooked veggies either but it's hard to over saut\u00e9 or roast Brussel sprouts.The space itself is quite appealing, romantic with cool lighting reminds me of stars in the night and I loved the back outdoors area under the dome of what have you.

They had a pre fixe for $50, comes with four courses, and they were of great quality. The restaurant is just adorable. Very romantic, with booths and high tables for larger groups. The only thing is that the tables are slightly too closed together, so it's hard for the person to get in and get out from the booth seat.\n\nMy date and I each ordered a soup, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. I got the main lobster broth to start, it's very flavorful. Since it's a broth, the texture is not extremely creamy like a bisque. It's of a small tasting portion, so you won't be full from it. \n\nWe split an order of salmon carpaccio and the baked goat cheese. Salmon carpaccio was delicious and fresh. It came with four pieces of bread to eat it like an open sandwich. The goat cheese was just odd. It lacks texture because it was baked, it tasted like a doughless pizza, since it was cheesy, with crushed tomato and pesto. I guess that was why they added pinenuts to it, just to add some layers to the mushy texture. \n\nWe shared our entrees too: seared scallops with brussel sprouts and seared duck breasts. They were both well-prepared. I chose the seared scallops to be on a safe side, since I loved both scallops and brussel sprouts. They were not the best I've tried, but they're not of bad quality. The scallops were soft, melted in my mouth, and were very flavorful. The sprouts were well seasoned with bacon bits, I just have a preference on having my brussel sprouts fried in duck fat or something to get a crunchy texture. The duck breasts were just right in terms of how it wasn't overly cooked, it kept its moisture and tenderness. The sauce was a bit too heavy for me at that time though. \n\nI ordered the vanilla creme brulee for dessert. The torching was done almost perfectly, my creme brulee had a nice, even tan. The harden caramelized sugar is like the best part, it contains its original sweetness yet it's evened out by the burnt taste. However, I forced myself to finish the rest of my dessert, since I wasn't a big fan of vanilla for it made my dessert too sweet, yet I loved creme brulee. But for normal people, this is just right!\n\nParking can be a pain around this area. It's very hard to find street parking, and the parking lot we parked at was with expensive meters. But this place is worthwhile!", "author": "Connie C."}

To our group's collective surprise, neither the server's recommendations nor the Yelp Review Highlights were able to predict the winning dishes on the night we came, about a week ago. Well, here's what you want:\n- The rack of lamb!  This might be the best lamb I've ever had.  (And a couple others in the group had similar sentiments.) They season it just right so that it almost has a hint of butter flavor and none of that funk that makes some people avoid lamb.  Probably a touch fattier than your typical cut, which might explain it... do it.\n- The flatiron - wonderful, again perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare.\n- To our surprise, the risotto, which I think had truffle mushrooms on it.\n- The tuna tartare, which again to our surprise was better than the salmon carpaccio.  Do that too!\n- The free bread.  Maybe it was the butter they served with it, not sure... but it was awesome.\n- The Goat Cheese appetizer.  I didn't have this one, but it was one couple's fav.\n\nNow there were tons of other dishes recommended by either Yelpers or the staff, but no one in our group loved these: the dungeness crab salad, the crab broth, the salmon carpaccio, the mussels, the duck breast (surprising right? that looked awesome!) and the lamb tenderloin (which was a special).

She was also there that night.  If you ever need to organize a huge group dinner, you will not find a better person to work with than Sameera. I would easily recommend Isa to anyone, for anything from date night to taking out your parents to group celebrations.  The food is very good for the price.  This is my third time here and I will be returning.\n\nEverything went without a hitch.  Sometimes, when you have a large party, the quality of the food or service will suffer.  This did not happen.  There were plenty of waiters and the kitchen kept the food coming.  We took a welcome break after the entrees then plowed on to dessert.  The timing was perfect, the food was hot, and there was plenty to go around.\n\nSince we had a huge group, we were seated in the back patio and Isa had to go with their shared menu for groups.  This basically consisted of six courses (see below, and keep in mind that the food came out to all 55 people at once), and everyone got to dig in.  Your dollar will go far here.  About the back patio -- it was a December night in SF, and even at 45-50 degrees outside, the patio was perfectly warm.\n\nFirst\n\nBaked Laura chenel goat cheese with pesto, tomato concass\u00e9e & pine nuts\n-- Good; I ate this with the fresh bread served at the table.  It needed a vessel.  I couldn't have eaten just a giant piece of cheese.  \n\nButter lettuce salad with apples, candied walnuts, watercress & roaring forties blue cheese\n-- Delicious.  I've had this type of salad before and sometimes the dressing is overpowering, but at Isa it was just right.\n \nSecond\n\nSeared scallops with brussel sprouts, bacon, mashed potatoes & truffle sauce\n-- It was weird, they ended up serving this entree last.  The scallop was overcooked (probably because they were cooking these for 55 people) but I didn't mind.  The flavors were really good for this dish.  The brussel sprouts could be a tad less mushy, especially since mashed potatoes were already on the plate.  \n\nSpaghetti with himalayan truffles, tomatoes, basil & parmesan cheese\n-- This was a really simple dish with clean flavors.  A lot of people liked this and cleaned it up.\n\nGrilled Golden Gate natural angus flat iron steak with haricots verts, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce\n-- This was okay.  The best part of it was the potatoes, which were really flavorful and crispy.  The meat was a little underseasoned.\n \nThird\n\nCr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n-- Standard fare.  It's hard to mess up creme brulee.  That said, it was a solid one.", "author": "Erika C."}

Parking SUCKS here, so come early and prepare to drive around at least 15 minutes if you want street parking.\n\nI suggest making reservations and when you do, request patio seating! It seems to be the main dining room but it's outside under a tent and decorated so whimsically. The indoor dining area seems really tiny and cramped and more like a happy hour/bar seating type area.\n\nI came with two of my girlfriends and we were seated in a great table on the patio, right next to a heater :D (yay!). It was my birthday too, so the hostess or perhaps manager gave me a complimentary glass of champagne. Delicious! \n\nThey do family style here, which is so unexpected of French fare. The waiter will suggest you order two plates per person, one appetizer and one entree. In my opinion, I feel that may be much, and I was right, we were STUFFED. I'm not complaining though because each dish we had was incredibly good and plentiful. But you could probably get away with ordering one or two less appetizers. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the mussels which came in a tasty, brothy soup (YUM), salmon carpaccio (def. get this!), and hudson grade A foie gras (for SURE  must have!). The foie gras was huge and soft so that it traditionally melts in your mouth.  \n\nFor entrees, we got their apparently famous potato wrapped sea bass, which was very unique and good, the maple leaf farm duck breast (must get! So tender and flavorful, love the complementary flavors), and the angus flatiron steak (ALSO must get) which was cooked PERFECTLY.\n\nDid i already say that each of these dishes were huge and definitely enough for sharing?? \n\nI would highly recommend this place for groups...it's a great restaurant with quality food for decent prices.

For ~$40 each, we were served a delicious four course meal, with an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. We also added on half a dozen oysters, which were $1 each. Definitely a lot to take on for two ladies, but we loved food too much.\n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the potato leek soup and arugula salad. Both were good-- I particularly liked the arugula salad, as the sweet sour citrus paired well with the bitter arugula. Next were the yellowfin tuna and steamed Prince Edward island mussels. The yellowfin tuna was AMAZING! It was served raw, but was so soft that it practically melted in your mouth. The avocado complimented the tuna extremely well for a sweet and rich taste. Definitely my favorite dish of the night! The mussels were also very tasty, more so for the broth. We enjoyed dipping our bread to finish off the broth. The oysters were also brought in around this time, and served with a simple sauce and dash of lemon, they were also delicious .The oysters were smaller than the usual oysters around the area-- the waiter explained to us they were Little Skookum oysters from Seattle. Yum! Now, we were already starting to get a bit full, but we had two courses left. Third course included the truffle risotto and maple leaf farm duck breast. The truffle risotto was thick and rich, and the duck breast was soft and flavored with huckleberry sauce. These two dishes were more savory and filling, and we had to pack both home as we were stuffed! However, no matter how full we are, there's always room for dessert. My friend and I joked how we have two stomachs: one for dinner and one for dessert. Our dessert stomachs were empty and ready for deliciousness. We ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee and Buche Au Lait De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey and walnuts.) The creme brulee was delicious (when is it not?) but nothing different from any other restaurant. The entree with goat cheese was unique though in my opinion: a slice of bread lathered with rich goat cheese and sprinkled with honeyed walnuts. I'm not usually a huge fan of cheese, but I have to admit this was awesome. \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful experience at Isa. Service was impeccable; our wait was friendly and visited our table often to refill water and our basket of bread, answer questions, and ask about our experience.

It happened to be during the Dine About Town week, and even though I prefer to select items a la carte, their DAT menu looks extensive and so I decided to give them a try. They serve their food family style here anyway, which is interesting for French cuisine, but I like it that way.\n\nFirst off, we ordered some cocktails. They were so-so -- I felt like the alcohol was a bit weak in them. Maybe it was because they were made with soju.\n\nWe started with the butter lettuce salad and the dungeness crab salad. Both were pretty good, and there were quite a bit of crab in the salad. We then had the foie gras, which was delicious with the sauce (some sort of berry?) and the brioche. The server recommended a sweet wine with the foie gras and that paired surprisingly well.\n\nThen we had the scallops with asparagus and mashed potatoes, and the duck breast with huckleberry sauce. Both of the main entr\u00e9es were done exceptionally well -- the scallops seared but not overcooked, the duck breast super tender and well seasoned.

The mussels were also surprisingly good! For our entrees, we tried the flat iron steak, halibut and duck. Although I'm a huge fan of steak and usually do not like duck, the duck really stole the show!!! Well flavored, tender but crispy on the outside. Yummm!\n\nA huge plus about this place is the good portion sizes and nice ambiance. There are two sections of the restaurant, the front is dimly lit and more \"romantic\" and the back has a brighter patio feel. We were seated in the back area and I thought it was perfect for us so if you are making reservations, request accordingly!  Also, if you arrive before 7pm on a weeknight, you can order drinks for $5, happy hour price! I really enjoyed their Number Seven soju cocktail with champagne, ginger and fresh berries.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me slightly was the fact that I felt slightly rushed by our waiter. The service was great but you could tell they needed our table, understandably so, since it was a packed dine about town hot spot and a Friday night. We were asked many times if we were ready to order, food was brought out quickly, so quickly that they did not bring everyone's entree out at the same time. When he brought us our desserts, he dropped off the check and said \"just in case you ladies have plans later tonight, wouldn't want to hold you up!\"  We didn't really have plans for after, but I think Isa did... \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say the food was mind blowing but definitely decent.  I'd definitely come back again and try some of their other dishes, maybe on a less crowded night!", "author": "Gloria C."}

Having a great dinner experience is not only about the food.  Its also about the ambiance and service as well. \n\nBefore I talk about the very cute decor I do want to address the parking situation.  Isa is in the Marina area with all the bars, restaurants, shops, etc.  Parking on the street is very limited at any time of day but with all the warnings from other Yelpers I kept my expectations low.  LUCKILY everything worked out well. \n\nOn the Isa website they suggest several parking garages and the Wells Fargo parking lot after 6pm.  The Wells Fargo parking lot turns into a legit parking lot with an attendant.  It was $13 flat fee to park and it was a block away from the restaurant.  The Reserve a Parking spot on the website is MUCH more expensive and FURTHER so I would suggest that. \n\nThe cocktails were tasty and I loved sitting outside but it still being covered. \n\nFood was very tasty.", "author": "Anya R."}

Fresh, long strips of salmon with capers, lemon creme sauce and some egg to go along with some bagel chips.  If you're a fan of raw salmon, this is a MUST GET. The dungeness crab salad had large chunks of dungeness crab combined with some other interesting ingredients that I felt mixed well (avocado, taragon, grapefruit, apple).\n\nEntrees: Flat Iron Steak - tender, tender pieces of steak with string beans and potatoes to accompany.  Duck breast - Again, sizeable portions of duck breast to go along with a tasty salad.\n\nDessert: Grapefruit granite + creme brulee: I wasn't a huge fan of the creme brulee, but the grapefruit granite was described as a grapefruit sorbet, but it was more like a shaved chunks of ice with (natural) grapefruit flavoring. \n\nDefinitely a must-try!

The restaurant was nice looking and clean on the inside. I was not impressed at all however with the quality of food and service.\n\nThe waiter at first was very attentive but after our main course it seemed like he was forgetting about us.\n\nWe had the Dine About Town menu and had the following:\n\nDungeness Crab Salad: The flavors of the salad did not come together in anyway.  The grapefruit did not go well in the salad. There was a large piece of crab cartilage attached to one of my pieces of crab too. The leaves of the lettuce were way too big and a bit bitter. There was also way to much thyme that it overpowered all of the other flavors. The crab was really tasty and fresh though.\n\nDuck Breast with Spinach: The duck was very salty but cooked well. The spinach on the side was really tough. It should have been cooked or blanched for a tiny bit. If I wanted a spinach salad I would have ordered one but I've never gotten raw spinach with a main dish, it is always cooked. The vinaigrette on the spinach was good though.\n\nVanilla Bean Gelato with Biscotti: This was my favorite part of the whole meal. Although I'm thinking they didn't actually make the gelato and possibly the biscotti. This makes it hard to give my compliments to the chef and the restaurant if they didn't make this themselves. I could be wrong though.\n\n***Another thing that I noticed was that the salt on the table was in a small dish and didn't have a spoon. How many people have put their fingers or used silverware in that? Eww.

Some of our favorite dishes are the Dungeness Crab Salad, Roasted Rack of Lamb, Truffle Risotto, and the Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast. The one exception my boyfriend and I make to the rule is with the Hudson Valley Grade A Foie Gras, which is simply too delicious not to hog. Instead, we always order individual servings of the foie gras.  \n\nThe atmosphere is excellent.

The restaurant is listed as French, but there wasn't much French on the menu - truffle risotto, yellowfin tuna (tasted like tuna pok\u00e9), scallops with orzo, short ribs with mashed potatoes to name a few. The dishes ranged from okay to good, but nothing was great. Also, the waitress said the dishes are family style, but there was nothing family style about them. Family style means either big portions that are meant to be shared OR dishes with only one hero element so all the different dishes form a complete meal. Our entrees were normal portions with normal sides and garnishes like any other restaurant.\n\nAlthough our waitress was nice, we had a rude encounter when we first arrived with whom I think was the owner. I ordered wine at the bar and it tasted sour. When I told him I thought my wine had turned, he denied it saying, \"I don't think so because I just opened that bottle.\" As if wine can't go bad unless it's opened? He then pours himself a glass in front of us, drinks it and says, \"Nope. Tastes fine to me.\" We were appalled. When I asked if I could get another glass, he said, \"Fine, but I'm going to make you taste it first so I don't waste another glass of wine.\" It was almost comical.\n\nI've never sent a drink back before, but I've seen it happen at much better restaurants with much more expensive wines and the response is always apologetic, no questions asked. Whatever complaints they might have is made behind the scenes. This guy made a big stink over a $5 happy hour glass of wine and shocked everyone at the bar.

It is located near Chestnut Street, which makes it a great neighborhood restaurant and post-shopping retreat. The place is decorated in a cozy and somehow elegant manner. The menu offers a variety of dishes that are definitely appealing. We ordered the crab salad which was perfectly seasoned, but a little light on the crab. We then had the sea bass encased in a crispy potato crust and served with a tablespoon of chopped tomato and capers. The fish was cooked to perfection, but the taste of fried potato sort of ruined the experience. A little too oily to me. Some extra vegetables would also have been welcome on the plate. We also had the paella, which was tasty and more generous in quantity, although the rice was sticky like a risotto. For dessert, we chose the chocolate fondant which was disappointing. Not rich and dark enough in chocolate, too much egg and sugar and flavored with orange peel (not mentioned on menu). The vanilla ice cream that came with it was more satisfying and authentic.

The first time I visited this restaurant was when it first opened over 15 years ago, and the restaurant was only days old.   The food was good then, and I kept this restaurant in the back of my head.\n\nMy husband and I came on Sunday as our date night.  Their prix fixe  was a steal - $29.95 for appetizer, entree and dessert! Happy Hour drinks were only $5!  In addition to the prix fixe, we added foie gras and the wine pairing with it.  \n\nAppetizers:   The salmon carpaccio was fresh.  The steamed mussels were made in red sauce, different than what I normally experienced.  The mussels were small but good.  My ever craving foie gras finally arrived after 30 minutes of placing the order.  It was very good. Melted in my mouth.  But the pairings on the dish (cranberry sauce, slices of pear, etc) were a bit too sweet.\n\nEntrees:  My medium rare steak was deeeelicious!  A perfect medium rare, tender and the blue cheese made the dish stand out.  My husband had the halibut.  It was fine.  A little bland, but it may have something to do with trying my powerful tasting of blue cheese sauce on the steak.\n\nDesserts:  Goat cheese with honey and walnuts was fine.  We really enjoyed it with the grapefruit granite.  Perfect dessert to clear the palate after tasting the heavy goat cheese.  \n\nDrinks:  We ordered 4 Happy Hour mixed drinks and the wine recommended to go with the foie gras.  All were fine but they were VERY small, about 2.5 - 3 oz.\n\nService:  Service was slow, especially from the bar.  Our waiter was waiting on many tables, and we didn't see him often.   Water glass was empty until I asked for refills.  Took about 30 minutes before our foie gras came out, but the recommended wine that paired with it came out immediately.\n\nAll in all, we had an awesome night at Isa.  We liked the food a lot.

But basically he was calling me to tell me that they're only offering their DAT menu.\n\nWe get there and there's only one table with patrons. The hostess was busy chatting with a couple so the host came over to help us.\n\nTheir DAT menu is $34.95 and I thought that was super expensive. I had a question about their menu where it was written \"dishes are shared\". Now I'm thinking, that the dishes are big enough for 2 people to share. I knew that probably wasn't the case so I asked the our host what \"shared\" meant. He was very rude and made me feel like I was 3 inches tall. He rudely said \"shared!!! It means that not all the dishes will come out at the same time and that we'd have to share each other's dishes.\"\n\nUm ok thanks for the explanation. * can you read my sarcasm?*\n\nThey had salt and pepper on the table.

Don't let the picture fool you. I wasn't asked how I wanted my meat cooked. I'm glad there was some kind of pink in there. It had no taste even though there was sauce underneath it. It was dry. It was tough and chewy with the strings attached. Yes I'm for reals. It came with some nicely seasoned veggies. \n\nWe also got the mussels- most of the shells were empty. The ones that had meat in it , they were pretty small. \n\nThe entree that stood out and was superb was the chicken. The skin was nicely fried and seasoned. And the meat inside was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes was heaven! It's probably due to a lot of butter. This dish is a MUST!\n\nVanilla bean creme brulee- yum!

We were dressed very casually and thought we would be turned away especially with two teenage boys.  Note - we had never been to the restaurant before but had heard about it and walked by just because we had found a parking space.  What luck!\n\nThe waiter explained that it was small plates, family-style sharing which was great for us as we had 5 diners.  Also made it in before 7pm thus got happy hour drinks at $5.  Nice selection of wine by the glass to choose from.  The waiter had a little trouble presenting the small-plate concept and how plates would be tabled throughout the evening.  He did not smile at all, but who cares as we were there for the food and knew how to order and share plates.\n\nWe had nine items (two lobster broths w/prawns, 1/2 dozen Pt. Reyes oysters, crab salad, mussels, grilled calamari, scallops, sea bass, rack of lamb, and flat iron steak), two desserts, two cappuccinos, and coffee.  Got out for $220 which is a great value.  Also went through 5+ baskets of warm bread with creamy butter (teens love warm bread and creamy butter) and very attentive care to the water glasses... wow....\n\nThe five of us discussed what were the oustanding dishes that would bring us back and noted - lobster broth w/prawns (you can smell and taste the essense of lobster), mussels (teenage son scarfed up most of it), grilled calamari (great grilled taste with a light sauce), scallops, and the rack of lamb (we had it medium rare).  The other four items were good too, but these five just stood out.\n\nAdditionally, the plates came out at a staggered pace and we could see the waiter was keeping an eye on our table to ensure that plates were not delivered all at once.  We had no more than two plates on the table through the night (two hour dinner).  Who cares if he did not smile, he knew how to professionally handle the pacing of a dining experience.\n\nI would have to say this is a restuarant that you have to try.  If you live in the neighborhood, count your blessings as you could go more often without dealing with the issue of parking - tough to find spaces.  ISA has great food and great service as they are doing the little things right (making you feel important by going out of the way to arrange a table, proper pacing of the plate delivery, attentiveness to water and bread, etc...).\n\nWe will defintely go back and hope we have a similar experience!

The main reason we chose this one was not only the menu, but the free glass of wine, which turned out to be an Argentinian Malbec. Not too dry, pretty smooth.\n\nOur waiter explained to the 4 of us that they served all their food family style. Perfect! We chose 4 items from each section, so we got to try a little bit of everything! Our servers were excellent at refilling our bread basket (although why did they only give us 4 pieces at a time??). That bread was mighty good. Crunchy crust, soft and warm middle.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Laura Chenel goat cheese. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese, but it was manageable and I liked how they played on the typical mozzarella with basil and olive oil. Unfortunately, they were out of the pei mussels, so we substituted for arugula salad that was supposed to come with persimmons (which it did not). Slightly disappointed with the apps overall, but the entrees made up for it. The other apps were the smoked salmon and dungeness crab salad. \n\nAll the entrees were delicious, with the truffle risotto being my favorite. I think my palette is changing... as I didn't feel like any one dish was particularly salty, but I felt like ingesting all of it together was a big salt intake. The flat iron steak cooked medium rare... delicious! The duck and the scallops were perfectly cooked, and all the sides (fingerling potatoes, green beans, brussel sprouts, etc) were also good.\n\nLastly, we got to try all 4 desserts. I'm not a huge grapefruit fan, but the grapefruit granita (or a glorified snow cone as I like to call it) tasted exactly as you would expect grapefruit to taste. Nothing else particularly extraordinary, but the vanilla bean gelato and the creme brulee were good, and the semifreddo amaretto (like a frozen mousse) slightly better. \n\nOverall, a very, very satisfying meal with fantastic service! Rounding a 4.5 stars up to 5!", "author": "Veronica C."}

At first, I didn't know that they had a happy hour that goes on until 7PM. When we arrived, we asked the hostess if we could hang out at the bar before dinner, even though we had reservations. She informed us that we could order from the happy hour menu and still have dinner at the same time. Winner winner, chicken dinner!\n\nAfter ordering a few happy hour drinks, we finally decided what to get. It took us a while because there are so many delicious dishes on the menu! Of all the happy hour drinks I had, I enjoyed the Kir Royale the most. I couldn't believe they had such a large selection of $5 drinks! While we were drinking away, bread was also served to us. It seemed freshly baked and was delicious with the butter they provided. When we were done with the initial basket, a water-boy came by with a new batch without us asking. Awesome!\n\nOur server mentioned that as a family-style type of restaurant, it's recommended to order 3-4 dishes between two people. I'd recommed 3 dishes if you're not too hungry... but 4 if you really are. We started off with a hamachi tartare. It was delicious and the seaweed with a soysauce type of dressing just made the dish! We also ordered the seared foie gras and it was a generously huge portion of fatty goodness! For our entrees, we had the pan-seared scallops and the seafood paella. I would HIGHLY recommend the scallops! It came with 4 perfectly cooked scallops with a delicious potaote puree and asparagus. I was not at all impressed with the paella, but maybe I'm just not a paella person. It was too fishy for my taste. \n\nOur waiter was not too attentive but we didn't care because we were enjoying our meal. I can't wait to come back and try other dishes!

The entire staff has really gotten the system down to take care of their patrons. Not matter how big our party size is, from just 2 or a party of 15, they have kept not disappointed.\n\nThis review is only based on their 2015 sfrw menu. I had the leek soup for my first course and it was nice and creamy. I didn't feel like I needed to add salt or pepper. It felt extra nice for the cold weather. My second course was a yellow fin tuna. It was like a tartare with a layer of avocado on the bottom. It was a wonderful combination of two of my favorite things. My third course was the seared scallop with brussel sprouts and mash potatoes. It was like a plate of buttery bacon oil heaven on a plate, in a good way. I even tasted a hint of it with my seared scallops. I just wish there were a few more. My final course was point reyes blue cheese with grapes and raisins. Mmmmm, I love my cheese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-02", "description": "Holiday Dinner - noun, occasions during the month of December where people tend to overindulge in consuming delicious foods, resulting in unavoidable growth of waist line (see: Holiday Weight).  This year is no different after my first holiday dinner of the year...and I can thank Isa for that.\n\nAs a whole, there are a lot of things I like about this restaurant.  The vibe itself is pretty unique considering that it's almost like two separate places in one.  In the front, you get more of a lounge type of feel, with a wine bar and a number of tables bunched together for some casual dining.  However, once you get past the middle kitchen area, the back doors open up onto a covered patio area with heat lamps sprinkled throughout the area.  If you're familiar with Park Chow, it's kind of similar to their rooftop dining area, and I really like both.\n\nThe concept of the food at Isa is pretty different too; the meal is meant to be family style with each plate being prepared to be shared amongst the table, rather than as plates for each individual.  As such, the plates will still come out in the traditional order of courses, but on a \"ready to serve\" basis, rather than at a single time for the entire table at a time.  So accordingly, got a chance to try several different dishes in addition to my own.  Everything was really solid, but as for what I had ordered:\n\nHudson Valley Grade A Foie Gras - AWESOME.  The portion size for my order was probably the largest I've ever received.  I had to restrain myself from taking huge bites out of it...it was that good.  The poached pear was perfectly sweet and ripe, and I loved the wild huckleberry and custard brioche.  I couldn't find something wrong with the dish even if I wanted to.\n\nPotato Wrapped Seabass - I was a little worried about whether my foie gras and my second dish would be filling enough (it was a late dinner and I was starving), but the sea bass was a very filling second dish.  I remember seeing something similar to the description on an episode of Top Chef, and it pretty much sold me on trying this dish.  It definitely didn't disappoint - it was perfectly cooked, and was rather hefty in size.  Yum!\n\nCreme Brulee - creamy, not overly sweet, and just good!  I loved seeing a whole mess of vanilla bean grinds at the bottom...good to know they didn't skimp on it.  To (literally) top it, the creme brulee had a perfect topping - firm, but cracked easily with a strike of my spoon.  Nothing is worse than a soft crust (see Steps of Rome).\n\nService was great, and our waiters were so friendly.  Adjacent to our table, there was a small company holiday party going on, and our waiters were kind enough to sneak a couple glasses of their wine to two of my friends.  Talk about brownie points...haha.  The back patio area lends itself to making Isa a decent date spot, but it can get kind of loud for intimate conversations.  However, Isa is definitely a great spot for group outings though.\n\nLastly, for those on a budget, they do offer a three course prix fix menu for $29 that includes a number of the same dishes you'll find on the regular menu.  It's only offered on Monday-Thursday, but it's pretty worth it (we were here on a Thursday, and all of my other friends opted for that option except for me).  They offer up about a half dozen choices for each of the first and second courses, followed by a handful of choices for dessert.  Definitely not a bad deal and something I'll consider on my next trip back.", "author": "Mike L."}

From the time I booked the reservation to the time all my guests arrived, she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great dining experience. \n\nI consulted a foodie friend for suggestions on a restaurant that would be delicious as well as accomodating a large group. She gave me several options. After reading all the Yelp reviews on Isa...I decided this will be the place. I was on the phone with Sameera for a good 20 mins. before I gave her my credit card info. to reserve a spot. She told me that on Saturdays there will be Happy Hour on the drinks only from 5:30-7pm (soju cocktails, wine, and regular cocktails). So, I went ahead and booked an early dinner at 5:30pm. I figure my friends and sister can mingle and grab some drinks before sitting down for dinner.\n\nSameera convinced me to have the party in the patio area. I was worried my guests would be cold, so I went back and forth on the idea. She finally told me it was an enclosed area (think Cirque Du Soleil tent) with heating lamps. I'm so glad I decided to go with the patio. It was cute and totally set a different mood/atmosphere versus the cramped indoor seating. I had about 17 guests total. The other 6 guests had to sit at another table, so we can have enough elbow room. If I plan on doing this again with a big group...I would definitely cap it at 10 people. I like to be able to talk to all my friends instead of jumping from one table to the next.\n\nAlso, she had another big bridal party coming in after my reservation which she never told me. However, she came up to me and said you have plenty of time and gave me up until 8:30pm to eat dinner and cut the cake. Once again, I didn't feel rushed at all. Once the food came, we started munching away.\n\nWe had such a great waiter. He welcomed us to the restaurant and told us how the menu works. This is a Fusion French restaurant with small plates (family style). He told us each guest should order something from the top menu and one from the bottom menu. We had a master copy of the menu floating around, so everyone can check off their dishes. It was perfect! I was a little worried that we would still be hungry. By the time, all the dishes arrived we were full and content. \n\nAll the dishes were delicious! There wasn't a single dish that I didn't like. We ordered almost everything from the menu, so we can have different samplings. I heard my friends ordering 2 paella dishes. I was going to interject and say only one since I was all paella out from my Spain trip. I have to say their paella was so delicious I'm glad we ordered it. I really loved the lamb chops, foie gras (just freaking melts in your mouth), mussels, duck breasts, tuna tartare, and chicken with mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent, so you can't go wrong! I included pics of all our dishes :)\n\nDuring our phone conversation, Sameera told me she would waive the cake cutting fee since she wants to make this a great experience for us. She said just refer your friends to come in if you end up liking the restaurant. I told her I will be gladly to. So, $48 was waived for the cake cutting fee. The waiter brought the cake out and all my friends sang, \"Happy Birthday\" to me. This is one of my best b-days ever and I hope to come back to this restaurant soon :)\n\nThis restaurant can be pricey. Our tab came out to be a little over $700. Like I mentioned before, the food didn't disappoint me and I love the intimate and cozy ambiance!\n\nSameera, thanks again for accomodating such a big group and making this day special for me.

First off, I have to say how wonderful the service is. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We had one main waiter for the night, even though others came by to check on the food and fill up our glasses. I really wished I had asked the name of our waiter. He was attentive and really funny, and made our night even more enjoyable.\n\nAs for the food, Isa was serving their New Years Eve dinner. We started off with some complimentary Champagne. My favorites were definitely the Steak and the Duck. All the elements in the dish worked so well together, and the sauces were simply amazing. I was literally wiping every last drop of sauce with the bread that was served in the beginning. The dessert was also delicious. Even though I was pretty full, I still finished the whole creme brulee.

These two dishes are hands-down two of Isa's best dishes. The tuna melts in your mouth and is spiced with the right proportions of soy sauce.

I hope they reconsider this offering.\n\nMy date had the halibut (good) while I had the braised short ribs (very good) with a side of wallpaper paste that they call mashed potatoes.\n\nOverall impression: not as good as they hype would suggest.  The place is tiny, tiny, tiny on the inside and the customers are packed so tightly that the waiters are constantly bumping into them.  I don't know why they think it is appetizing for customers to walk past the kitchen on the way to the tables.  It was not at all pleasant. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area, so if Isa is busy you may wish to go across the street.", "author": "Daniel M."}

While looking for a restaurant to try out, I wanted to try something different than usual and French is something we don't have very often. After looking at several different menus, I loved that Isa offers small plates - that just means more food for me to try! I love the atmosphere here, especially in the back indoor patio area we sat it. Very casually upscale.\n\nWe chose to try the Maine Lobster Broth/Potato and Leek Soup, Yellowfin Tuna/Baked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Seareed Scallops/Truffle Risotto, Semifreddo all'amaretto/Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. Everything was good, however, I especially liked the Potato and Leek Soup, Baked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Truffle Ristotto, and Semifreddo all'amaretto,\n\nAlthough they serve up \"small plates\", each plate is a generous serving and you won't leave hungry.\n\nWe liked it so much and when my mom saw our pictures of the food, we decided that we'll be back for Mother's Day this year!

I'd say 3 stars for that also.. It's not because of the sauce they gave us or the size. It is because there were too many shells in there.

The crab salad was very fresh with slight citrous taste from grapefruit. The lobster broth provided a full smoky only lightly salted balance. For main dishes, we ordered sea bass and scallop.  The sea bass wrapped in a very thin slice of bacon, crispy out side with soft sea bass inside. The sauce is so tasty (but not salty at all)  we used it for bread dip.  The scallop was well cooked with a flavor of  truffle oil, which is just right to our taste, not overwhelming at all. We also had chocolate cake for deserts. It was warm and soft with true chocolate taste instead of heavy sugary taste that we found in many other places.\n\nService: The waiter was very professional, tentative, but not chatty.

At $36.95, their four course DAT dinner menu is pretty generous, especially considering the quality of the food that you're getting here.\n\nWe had the potato and leek soup because they ran out of the Lobster Maine Broth, and it was fine--it was good for what it is. Then we all shared our 2nd courses, which were the Mussels, Yellowfin Tuna, Crab Salad, and the Oysters. Out of the four, I found that I really enjoyed the Mussels the most--and the remaining broth is great to soak up with bread. However, the Tuna and Crab Salad were both really fresh, and you can't really go wrong with Oysters.\n\nFor the third, I had the seared scallops, and I thought it was really great. The bacon provided a nice additional flavor to the dish, and the brussels sprouts were delicious.\n\nLast, I had the Creme Brulee for dessert--the sugar might've been a little too torched so it was quite bitter instead of being caramelized, but the custard itself was nice.\n\nOverall, the restaurant is a bit pricy without the Dine About Town menu, but the food here was great and I would come back here again.", "author": "Sylvia S."}

Isa takes what's in season and transforms these ingredients into one of SF's best dishes: fresh food that's seasoned well, you can't go wrong in dining here. \n\nIf you've never been, try going on a weeknight between Mon - Thurs. Isa's 3 course menu costs only $29. You'll get a lot more bang for your buck than ordering a la carte. \n\nOur apps were big enough to pass as entrees: from the heirloom tomato salad with arugula and feta; butter lettuce salad with pears, roaring forties blue cheese and candied walnuts; grilled local calamari with honey sauce. \n\nOur main courses were all winners: Halibut ala pancha, steak and potatoes and roasted chicken. My halibut was gorgeously flaky highlighted with citrus oomph from the oranges and sweetness from the beets. \n\nThe roasted chicken with mashed potatoes had two big pieces of moist chicken thigh & breast and the skin was nicely crisp. If you like your mashed potatoes on the creamy side, this will make you go: \"wow! there's so much butter in here!\"\n\nThe grilled flat iron steak done medium rare was presented with zucchinis and roasted fingerling potatoes in a wonderful bordelaise sauce. Steak snobs beware, you'll like it a lot. \n\nEven though the service was uneven, I still think Isa is a special place.

We were seated by very friendly staff in the back patio, which is covered and warm because it has a bunch of heat lamps. The atmosphere is so nice and very classy. It reminded me of LA restaurants with the outdoor garden-type setting, rustic wood tables, and strings of lights.\n\nDuring DAT they offer only the DAT menu, but that is not a problem because there is such a wide selection. I would suggest getting a variety of dishes and sharing, which is what we ended up doing.\n\nApps: \nBaked Laura Chenel goat cheese with pesto, tomato, concassee & pinenuts- this was soooo good. It's creamy and tangy, though not too much. Yes, it's a simple dish, but the combination of flavors just works really well together. It tastes good on the bread, which is warm and pretty much bottomless (they kept bringing more and more bread to the table.. which can be pretty dangerous!)\nDungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon- this was good too, although I don't think the flavors worked as well. The crab was fresh but not particularly memorable. A little more citrus would have worked better. It's a nice big portion.\n\nMains:\nSeared scallops with butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, bacon & truffle sauce- this was a really good combo. I love the side veggies- bacon makes everything taste good. I couldn't taste much truffle though. I do think the scallops were a tad overcooked- I prefer scallops with a chewy center, and i would say these were cooked through.\n\nMaple leaf farm duck breast with red cabbage, potato gallete & wild huckleberry sauce- the duck itself was amazingly tender and well-cooked, with a crispy skin. The berry sauce was quite good. The red cabbage was kind of WTF? it tasted mushy and sweet. I could do without it. The potato gallete was basically hash browns.\n\nDesserts:\nSemifreddo all'amaretto: This was kind of odd. It was icy on the edges, which is no bueno :( The amaretto cookies were forgettable.\nVanilla bean gelato with biscotti- The gelato was yum! You get two big scoops, so if you want lots of gelato this is a great option. The biscotti was good but soooo hard. I like the crumbly kind a lot better.\nFlourless chocolate cake, vanilla bean gelato- The winner! It is the most popular dessert according to the waiter, and for good reason. It is warm and more of a souffle in my opinion. The middle is melty like lava cake. You get a tiny ball of gelato, which I mixed with my cake :)\n\nOverall, amazing service and a TERRIFIC choice for DAT!

We found this place via yelp, and decided to go in after the positive yelp reviews. \n\nCalling this place a French restaurant is a bit of a stretch. Aside from the copious amounts of butter used in a select dishes, I would consider this more of a modern hybrid restaurant. Lots of fresh seafood options, pastas. \n\nWe weren't in the mood for wine that night, but I do like their wine selection, and very affordable price point. \n\nThe service was mediocre at best. Our host made a face when we told him we didn't have reservations, and then 'suddenly' found a nook for us to be seated by the front door. Our waiter was very polite and attentive, but didn't really explain anything on the menu or have any suggestions, without us prompting him. \n\nThe atmosphere is quite nice and I like the curtain at the front door preventing any drafts from the door opening coming in. A big plus for someone who is always cold. \n\nNow to the food. It wasn't the best restaurant we've been to, but for the price and  t\nhe freshness of the seafood, it would merit at least a 4 stars from me. \n\nWe had the following: \n\nHalf Dozen Oysters - $12 - Came out quickly and very fresh. \nSeared Scallops and some sort of pasta/rice side - Very very delicious. The butter usage was maximized on this dish. The side alone was worth ordering. \nRack of Lamp - a bit over cooked beyond what we asked for, but very tender and flavorful. \n\nPortions were great. \n\nI would go back if we happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't run back to have any one dish.", "author": "Winny F."}

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of ISA, at first i thought it was a bit dark but that was only the area near the bar, in the back it had a nice and cozy. It can best be described as a Patio that had a roof dropped on it. The ladies and I decided to take advantage of Isa's prix fix. You can't beat 3 courses for 29 bucks, especially since ISA's normal menu prices will make your tummy happy but wallet very sad.\n\nAll the items on the Prix fix sounded delicious .  The ladies and i decided to do it up family style so we could fully experience ISA. For appetizers we ordered The Heirloom Tomato salad, the butter lettuce salad and the grilled calamari. \n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad was simple yet very delicious. A layout of 4 different heirloom tomatoes on a bed of arugula with feta, basil and what tasted like crouton crumbs. Drizzled on top was a balsamic vinaigrette.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O8_jDhc7WJXqdD9YgEXSRw/l\n\nButter lettuce salad was giant lettuce leaves with slices of Bartlett pear, candied walnuts, roaring fourty's blue cheese and watercress. Another fairly simple salad with a nice different taste.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IFOxOZejHWxYbQERk9BUNQ/l\n\nGrilled Calamari was amazing, we all agree whenever we think of calamari we think FRIED! Grilled Calamari is a very good alternative if made right!! Isa's was spot on!  mmm tentacles, my favorite part ;) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gtt3cE-PM9-kvrkwt1hsrQ/l\n\nThe main courses we chose were the Halibut, Flat Iron Steak and Free Range Chicken:\n\nThe Halibut came out first, its was simply captivating. With its crisp exterior and soft center it was cooked to perfection. There's almost no way we can make this at home!! What's their secret???? seriously! I would eat  fish more frequently if i could make it this perfect at home. Another thing that made this dish the best of the nite was the mix of the other ingredients gave it a totally different flavor from what i am used to. I love beets but hate prepping them for anything, cuz they stain everything! the orange slices were a nice touch and the orange vinaigrette was a great finish.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OID21xWn91M0gH9x34RzIg/l\n\nFlat Iron Steak with zucchini and potatoes was also cooked perfectly, the steak was tender and juicy, the zucchini had good flavor and the potatoes  mmmm MMMmmmm is all i can say. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vZIJ18tvYZ0h4YDWf3mRVw/l\n\nFree Range Chicken: One breast and one thigh was prepped with a lot of spices which in turn make it very flavorful and delightful. Normally the mash potatoes i make or like usually has lumps it in. Isa's mashed potatoes were creamed to perfect....taste that butter...yum.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XmRjgJ1RWl8yDa0T7KXeOQ/l\n\n\nFor Dessert it was a pic from two different cheese plates, Semifreddo all' Amaretto and the Grapefruit Granite\n\nThe ladies both opted out for the Semifreddo and i decided to be the odd one out and get the Grapefruit Granite. \n\nThe Semifreddo: The texture seemed like ice cream but not as creamy and heavy. The plate was lined with hollow almond cookies, very fresh and yummy.http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0RacKXy674IyZUbIGsSWGQ/l\n\nThe Granite didn't strike me as anything special, it was basically Grapefruit shaved ice to me. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y-3xPJ-u91kBPq3iNDOWtQ/l\n\n\nBest Monday ever,  Janice L and Karen Y!!! Thanks Ladies ;)\n\n\n\n*semifreddo: is a semi frozen dessert (ice cream cake, semi frozen custard, fruit tarts) it has a moose like texture because they are uniting two equal parts of ice cream and whipped cream.\n\n*Granite: combining some sort of fruit juice with boiling water and fine sugar. You then freeze it on a pan and scrape it off. essentially its similar to shaved ice.", "author": "Jonathan W."}

The pesto and tomato gave it such an Italian zest that made it irresistible. It tasted so good with the bread.\n\nThe SALMON CARPACCIO was my favorite. Thinly sliced, but extremely flavorful, it was a fresh burst of flavor on delicious cracked bread slices.\n\nThe SCALLOPS were a little small, but there were quite a few of them, so it was okay. This dish was a burst of flavor, thanks to all the veggies and of course, the BACON! I cleaned off my entire plate.\n\nThe CHICKEN was succulent and tender and had a crispy skin that didn't taste remotely fatty-- it was cooked to perfection. The mashed potatoes were a piece of fluffy heaven and went so well with the chicken.\n\nThe STEAK had a good flavor but my friends thought it was a little too chewy at times. The paired polenta tasted a little strange, but overall it was still a delicious dish.\n\nThe SEMIFREDDO was the better dessert choice. It had such a unique, but sophisticated taste. \n\nThe FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE was not a hit. I guess it's because we didn't know what to expect, but it was mushy and didn't have that cake texture we were expecting. HOWEVER, the vanilla bean gelato saved the dessert.

The restaurant looked small when i walked it but I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess took us to the back room. The back looked like a tent but was nicely lit and decorated to give off a nice ambiance. Service was great and we were constantly asked if we wanted more bread/water.\n\nThe menu suggests that each person orders 2 dishes, but for the both of us, a total of 3 dishes were more than enough. I guess it really depends how hungry you are, maybe I just ate too much bread before my meal came out (typical me).\n\nWe ordered:\n- Yellowfin Tuna: This dish was absolutely delicious, more of an appetizer. \n- Saffron Paella: PAELLA! I am such a big fan of paella, so I highly recommend this dish. This was probably the most filling of the 3 dishes we ordered.\n- Pan roasted rocky Jr. Range chicken: Chicken w/ mashed potatoes.

Throughout the meal I felt like they wanted us to leave as soon as possible, but when I looked around, there were 2 other 4 tops that were empty. Mind you, we had reservations for our dinner a week in advance.\n\nBut the WORST was when our waiter ASKED us to leave!!! I still had half a glass of wine on the table! I eat out several times a week for dinner in SF and have NEVER had this happen! Ever!!! Again, when I looked around  there were several large birthday celebrations who were there before us and after us still sitting.

We weren't finished chatting and stood in front of the restaurant under an awning in the rain for an additional 10 minutes to finish catching up.  \n\nTERRIBLE hospitality.

YUM\n\nFirst of all I LOVE that everything is easily shared here because I'd rather eat a little of many things than a lot of one thing. Variety is good. We came here in a group of 6 and so got to try a large sampling of items. While waiting we grabbed some drinks at the bar up front and they have these portable electronic consoles that you can play games on. Definitely helped the wait go by faster.\n\nWe got seated in the back patio, which was really charming and cozy. To start with we had the baked goat cheese, the seared scallops with bacon and brussel sprouts in truffle sauce, the maine lobster broth, Yellowfin tuna with served on avocado with nori and toasted sesame, and the arugula salad. Stand outs were the scallops and the yellowfin tuna. The tuna tasted really yummy with the avocado and the spicy sriracha sauce. Main dishes: spaghetti with truffles, basil, parmesan cheese; potato wrapped seabass w/brown butter (MMMM); and Maple leaf farm duck breast. Everything was amazing. Yes even the spaghetti. All the flavors were so rich but not in an overpowering way. Don't leave without trying the vanilla creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake.

Ate here last night and in the back room they had 5 birthday parties, I spent half my dinner listening to the happy birthday song: 1 party of 27, 2 parties of 12, 1 party of 8, 1 party of 6. Thus it is obviously a popular bday destination and for good reason. Keep your date nights in the front part of the restaurant which is a bit more romantic.\n\nFood was yummy as usual and love the fact that it's family style. For 3, we had the following. It was enough food to get us all full and all of it was good. Service was all attentive which was surprising given the number of large parties they had.\n\nCrab salad- basic but good, not much avocado though\nFoie gras - quite sweet given the strawberry sauce base but really well cooked, was tender - definitely a win\nRisotto - had multiple different types of mushrooms. Not too creamy, general crowd pleaser\nScallop- comes with orzo, snap peas and tomatoes, that was the better part of the dish. Scallops tasted like they do anywhere\nButterfish - this was a special for the day. Came in an envelope that looked like the flaky part of spanokopita but this was not edible. Sauce was not noticable but the fish was very nicely prepared\n\nFor dessert we had a creme brulee (top was too hard but otherwise fine), chocolate cake (side of ice cream was tasty), vanilla bean gelato with espresso (this was heavy on the espresso as it's mixed in)\n\nOnly thing we didn't like were the drinks which is unfortunate.

I was looking forward to foie gras.... but they didnt have it!!!! We came here for my friend's birthday dinner, so we thought it would be a nice place because some people can get DAT and others that are on a budget can just get one item. I guess we should not have assumed that ISA is like other restaurants that offers both DAT and the regular menu. But half of us were pretty upset once we sat down and realize there was only dine about town.... BUT that is now why i am only giving them two stars\n\nNow for the service. The waiter and busers were really sweet, unfortunately, our waiter messed up twice on our order. My boyfriend order a glass of wine, and it did not come until 40 minutes later, WHEN my boyfriend told him to cancel it. But he decided to give it to us on the house. Now at dessert time, we told him we wanted 4 chocolate cake and 1 vanilla bean gelato. We ended up with 3 chocolate cake and 2 gelato, but again the waiter gave it to us on the house. But at this time, a few of us were quite fed up everything and wanted to leave, but we had to wait for the last chocolate cake to come out.\n\nTo the food. The free bread... was the highlight of the night, a lot of us needed it to go with the food cause it was a bit salty. But it was weird, some of the bread basket came to us warm, while others were cold... my friend only ate the warm ones. \n\nAnyways, I had the salmon carpaccio.... which was nothing special. Thing of salmon sashimi and capers and onions.... yea... that is pretty much it.\n\nThe duck breast was pretty good and so was the potatoes that came with it. But I hated hated the cabbage. This dish was pretty good, especially with the sauce, but it was a bit salty but the free bread helped balance it.\n\nThe chocolate cake was really good, but you definitely NEED to have the gelato with it.

The food is good, ambiance is relaxed, drinks are tasty, and the service is pretty darn impeccable. My friend and I were running a little late and when we called to give a head's up, they were pretty nice about it (Note: Parking around here is trouble, especially at night, so try to come early to find some street parking!). I thought they were going to chuck our reservation but nope, it was all good! \n\nThe front area looks pretty fancy but you get to walk past their open kitchen (pretty cool) and then they take you to the back, which is definitely more casual. The service was QUICK. They never let us run out of bread/butter, always made sure our water cups were full, and any empty plate was instantly cleared. Before we ordered, they emphasized that they served their meals \"family style\" and they were meant to be shared. Now, I left pretty darn full (not sure if it was the food or the 3 baskets of bread we devoured..) but I would say one person could definitely have a whole plate to themselves. It's either that or I eat a lot!\n\nI had their Smooth Potato & Leek Soup, Butter Lettuce Salad, Duck Breast, and then the Amaretto. YUM. I read a review that said their Duck Breast was too salty but I thought it perfectly tender and delicious. No complaints here! Their Number Seven Soju Cocktail was also AMAZING. I highly highly recommend trying something off their drink menu while you're there. Makes your experience all the better :). All in all, good food, good service.

Isa hands down has consistently one of the best value DAT menus in SF\n\nWOOT Clearly I'm a fan. I apparently went here when I was younger with family, but didn't remember. Isa has a cute dark cozy interior, and also a covered, awesome back patio area that doesn't get too chilly at night (BIG PLUS in the city). \n\nI've only been to Isa for DAT--the last two seasons--and they don't skimp on the menu: plentiful choices for all FOUR courses, unlike many restaurants that give you shabby little 2-3 courses for the same money. Scallops were huge and really nicely grilled--my cousin's fiancee enjoyed his duck--my main squeeze liked his fish. They grill really nicely at this place. I'd say the highlight was probably the apps--we shared mussels, tuna tartare, dungeness salad, and smoked salmon app (like bruschetta but with salmon...name is escaping me atm). The soup at the beginning was tasty too. Dessert was tasty too! Chose between creme brulee, grapefruit granita, and this almond italian dessert whose name is also escaping me @_@\n\nDanger: The bread is good. It comes warm and the crust is delicious. Otherwise read as: BEWARE FOOD COMA because the bread just keeps coming and the water keeps pouring, and sooner than you or I know, you'll be full before the entrees even come. Learn from the mistakes of others. :)\n\nQuality, solid food. Decent cocktails. Only downside is that there's NEVER any parking in the Marina.", "author": "Vivian C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-25", "description": "I am very conflicted on writing this review because the food was very good and very well prepared but the food quality is not all that goes into a restaurant experience.  So I had to honestly rate this 3 star.   If I did the food alone in a vacuum with nothing else then it is 5.  If I did everything else without the food it is a 1.    So here are my thoughts as a chef and owner of a large catering company.\n\nThe food was excellent.   Deftly prepared and well done.   We had the foie gras and that was excellent.  The portions were excellent and the searing was great.   The accompanying fruit was fig for 2 of them and strawberry for one.   There was no choice in this and they were just served that way.   This I didn't like.  I want to know what I am ordering and getting.  I don't like the concept of \"surprise\" when I am dining much less you get what I serve you.   The other guest ordered the Lobster Broth which was a bit thin in my estimation but was quite tasty.   \nThe mains were again well prepared.  Lamb rack was excellent, Halibut perfectly cooked, Scallops well cooked but on an Orzo which wasn't at all my favorite and the Scallops were a small portion as they were not very large, and Duck Breast which was a bit overcooked.   \n\nDessert was an Almond SemiFreddi which was excellent and a Cr\u00e8me Brulee which was not flavorful at all and didn't have enough crunch to the sugar portion.  Only a 2Star dessert in my opinion.   \n\nMy biggest issue issues are two-fold.   \n\nFirst - the restaurant needs a major overhaul in it's interior and ambiance.   You are escorted through a relatively nice looking small dining room in the front, past a very open kitchen (but not a beautiful open kitchen as you would see in most open kitchen restaurants) and then to the back portion of the restaurant in our case which appeared to look like an old patio that had been covered with a roof.   It was not decorated well and the tables were covered with placemats and it all looked very much like a diner instead of a 5star restaurant.   There were overhead propane heaters which I found myself wondering how they used given that we were really in an indoor facility and I am pretty sure you cannot use propane indoors per SF fire code, and it just felt like I was in a cheap diner type place.   Here I was spending a significant amount of money on a nice \"French\" dinner and wine and I felt like the food and place were completely mismatched.\n\nThen we were told that the dinner would be delivered \"TAPAS STYLE\".   I quickly understood that tapas style in this instance meant that the kitchen just didn't operate on a brigade style but rather each station just prepared what it was in charge of without any communication with any other part of the kitchen and things were sent out whenever they were ready.   However the menu was absolutely not a Tapas menu.   These were not small plates meant to be shared.   These were regular dinner plates with a main protein and an accompanying side dish just as in any other dinner restaurant but things were coming out whenever they were ready.   I was a bit put off at the fact that they felt they could just excuse this inability for their kitchen to coordinate itself so that all the dinners could come out at once and just call it Tapas Style.   This, for me really detracted from the meal.   I am not one who likes that sort of thing for THIS type of food.   This was not a Chinese banquet or other meal where that is expected.   Event hose type of meals the dishes are brought at relatively the same time.  Likewise for Tapas.  Often many of the dishes are brought all at the same time, but each dish will be just a small thing meant specifically to share.   So if this was really Tapas style for instance it would have been a Duck Breast with Cherry Sauce as one dish.  Then an additional dish would have been the braised cabbage and yet another dish would have been the potato gallette.   \n\nSo the food was very good, excellent in fact.   But I don't think I will go back because I was quite put off by the character of the restaurant and the fact that for that price I don't want my food served piecemeal.   For that amount of money they should be able to do a better job.   \nThere is HUGE potential here but it will take a bit more investment on their part to make the next grade.", "author": "Christian H."}

It's hard to give anything with lobster flavor an average rating, but thats what this soup was.  It was just a watery soup with a lobster essence. Very forgettable.\n\nOrganic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio- 4 stars.  Not too smokey.  The fish was good, but there was nothing about the dish that blew me away.  Still a pretty good appetizer though.\n\nMussels- 3.5 stars.  They were tasty, as mussels usually are.  I still thought it was missing a little something.  They came out in a watery tomato sauce, which wasn't bad, but not the greatest.  I think it could have used some garlic and butter.  I've had better mussels. \n\nSeared Scallops- 3.5 stars.  You get 4 scallops.  They were pretty tasty, but again, they weren't absolutely amazing like everyone else said.  I would probably try something different if I ever went back.\n\nRisotto- 3.5 stars. Pretty good dish.  It had a very strong mushroom taste.  If you really like mushrooms then this is a good one.   \n\nCreme Brulee- 4 stars.  Not overly sweet.  I really liked it.  I wish they gave a larger portion because I would have devoured it.   \n\nWine-  5 stars. from 5-7pm they have 5 dollar drinks and wine.  I loved the Cab Sauv they had.

Even so, the DAT menu covered a variety of choices. And instead of 3 courses, they served 4 courses. We had four people so we got to try a lot of different dishes. \n\nProps to the bread! It was hot and crispy. Couldn't stop eating it and they kept refilling it. We also ordered a bottle of champagne from Spain. It was so good.\n\nThen we started off with lobster broth. It was super delicious. The shrimp was the highlight. \n\nFor second course we got\n1. half dozen of raw oysters - fresh but tiny\n2. crab salad - very yummy! super fresh~\n3. mussels - cooked perfectly~ love dipping the bread in the broth\n4. yellow fin tuna - it was awesome!\n\nFor main we got\n1. seared scallop - scallop was cooked perfectly. it wasn't overcooked and tasted so   good with the mash potato and brussels sprouts. \n2. Flat Iron steak - my all time favorite! medium rare steak topped with green mustard imported from france. Delicious!\n3. Maple duck breast - duck breast was medium rare, the side salad with pine nuts was so yummy!\n4. Braised short ribs (off menu) - this was by far the best braised short ribs i've ever had! juicy and tender!\n\nWe ended our dinner with vanilla bean creme brulee.

Make sure to keep the sauce because there is so much of it - it tastes really good when you dip your bread in this sauce).\n\nFor our main courses, I got the chicken (we both agreed it was some of the best chicken we'd tried in our life - it was crispy on the outside and very tender and juicy in the inside. I also enjoyed the surprise layer of pesto that was spread in between the chicken and the chicken skin). My boyfriend got the steak, which is his staple meat at every restaurant, and also really enjoyed it. I liked that it came with sides like beans and potatoes. \n\nFor dessert, I got the semifreddo amaretto - it was the first time I'd tried an amaretto! It was so light and yet the almond taste was very strong. My boyfriend got the goat cheese...I only liked the candied walnuts hahaha but I think he really enjoyed it. \n\nOur servers were really friendly and joked around with us a lot.

The calamari was grilled to perfection and not chopped up too much like other places often do. The sea bass lightly wrapped in potato was inventive and delicious, and the scallops were succulent. The standout of the entire experience was the superb service. We were treated like kings.

Here's my breakdown.\n\n- Service: Got a call confirming my reservation earlier in the day, and was greeted promptly upon walking in. The lady who showed us to our seat gave us friendly conversation and made us feel comfortable! The server seemed a bit brusque and rough, but not unfriendly. The pace of the food was just right - had time to talk but never wondered about where my food was. Water was refilled from time to time and servers would check in on us :)\n\n- Bread: hehe :) it was warm and soft on the inside/crispy on the outside! They refilled it when we finished without us having to ask.\n\n- Crab salad; Crab wasn't seasoned enough and I didn't like the grapefruit  too much. The apples gave it a nice sweet touch though.\n\n- Salmon carpaccio: YUM!! Fresh and good amount of salmon. The creme fraiche and whatever it came with complemented it perfectly :)\n\n- Truffle risotto: YUM! The portion was bigger than I thought it would be and the mushrooms balanced it out perfectly texture and taste wise. It was done perfectly.\n\n- Seared scallops: Perfect! The mashed potatoes it came with were also delicious as well as the sauce + asparagus.\n\n- Semifreddo all'amaretto: The presentation looked super messy but it was gooooood. Sweet but not too sweet and def. got the taste of amaretto. The cookies that they came with were too hard for my taste, and forgettable.\n\n- Creme brulee: It was good but not GREAT. Maybe I'm spoiled because I get to go to the Creme Brulee Cart near work but I did try it after I had a taste of my semifreddo so my taste buds were probably off too. Nice crispy crust and soft inside though!", "author": "Emily C."}

After reading in a local paper that the restaurant owner was retiring, I immediately made a reservation. When we entered, there was no one at the podium (6 pm reservation). Promptly, the bartender greeted us and gave us a choice of tables (patio dining room or inside) before we chose our window side table. The Dine About Menu includes most of the regular menu choices so we ordered the following: \nAppetizers \n1) Dungeness Crab Salad - Four lettuce wraps topped with fresh Dungeness Crab. This was refreshing with a citrus flavor and no mayonnaise. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=bRELcdLaqdw2WmsuTsEckQ) \n2) Alaskan Wild Prawns - Six perfectly grilled prawns in a sharp sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=iZyR_i8z5ymAnq0cWz_7Uw) \n3) Lobster Broth - Don't be fooled by the name and expect lobster pieces as it is \"broth\" and flavored by the lobster. Great for cool SF evenings, there were two prawn pieces in a slightly spicy broth. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=hpdyEaor7_3B97Q24UlBGg) \nEntrees \n4) Seared Scallops - Four nicely seared scallops with four tender asparagus spears on a bed of mashed potatoes. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=dNMzJgYzn8Wsd70ZJXL-9Q) \n5) Truffle Risotto - Hearty bowl of risotto with a good mixture of wild mushrooms, topped with truffle shavings. Hearty and filling. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=dNMzJgYzn8Wsd70ZJXL-9Q) \nDesserts \n6) Grapefruit Granita - Made from fresh grapefruit juice, this icy dish was tart and flavorful. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=r1rUiadlALf_apjACfpO9g) \n7) Flourless Chocolate Cake - A chocolate cake is accompanied by a scoop of vanilla gelato, , a sweet contrast to the granita. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=z-G9B1Gt5sJLLeyUQan0Ag) \nSide \n8) Assorted Mushrooms - Being huge mushroom fans, this was a must that did not disappoint. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=kiEoe9fTn6j14M8TpCVnGQ) \n\nThough the bartender took our order to start, there was a smooth transition to our waiter who kindly described the dessert choices. Service was efficient as empty plates were quickly removed. Wanting to try a larger variety of dishes, we ordered more than we could eat and took home almost half of the risotto. Being early, we also ordered Happy Hour drinks (Mojito and Greyhound) for $5.00 each. It's a deceiving spot that does not stand out when you walk by. However, after you eat here, you'll soon learn that this is a mellow, hidden gem in the hip Marina.  As we left, the hostess told us that one of their most popular specials is the sea bass.

It was my first time in the Marina district so it was pretty fun to walk around the area too.  \n\nAs soon as we were seated, the host came up to us to offer a choice whether to take the bonus 1000 pts for the OpenTable reservation OR order off their $28 weekday prix fixe menu.  They wouldn't allow for both.  I was a little stunned that they came and asked us.  To me, it was poor etiquette.  They even went as far as telling us that they would have to pay OpenTable if we got the 1000 pts so that was the reason why they wouldn't let us order off their prix-fixe menu.  Geez, talk about shady!  Since we didn't want to be restricted on the menu items, we opted for the 1000 pts instead.  Minus one star for this awkwardness.  \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions.  He reminded us that the dishes were meant to be shared.  For starters, we had the Yellowfin Tuna and Dungeness Crab Salad.  The tuna tasted like poke with chunks of tuna vs minced tuna like tartare.  I highly recommend the crab salad as it was very light and refreshing with the avocado, apple, and grapefruit.  \n\nFor the entrees, we tried their popular dish, Potato Wrapped Seabass as well as their Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast.  The fish was nicely cooked (not dried out) considering the fact that the outside had crispy potato chips.  The sauce had capers and was very flavorful with the tomato confit.  The duck was very juicy, also cooked medium rare, and I loved the sweet sauce that it came with.  Both dishes were EXCELLENT!\n\nWe ended the meal with a creme brulee.  FINALLY, a restaurant that serves the right size creme brulee!  It was a lot more appealing to the eye and my taste buds!  I've seen too many places that serve gigantic sizes.

Hearing that somehow made me felt more welcome.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly, patient and knowledgeable. He explained everything in detail and was able to pick out a nice wine for us.

This is one of my favorite dishes to cook and Isa truly impressed me with their style. I didn't even sprinkle Tabasco on this dish which I normally do at home. \n\nPan Roasted Range Chicken - Standout dish of the night.

Which means FEAST. It certainly doesn't feel like a French restaurant but more like a new american place. \n\nDecor: Rather old-school feel. You know, like those north beach places. But the food is worth it. \n\nDishes:\n1. Yellowfin Tuna: quite standard. Fresh fish. Good combination with the seaweed/avocado etc. \n\n2. Grilled Calamari: I like the fact that it's grilled dish. But the calamari was overcooked a tiny bit. \n\n3. Arugula salad: you can never go wrong with Arugula as long as they are fresh! Which is the case here. \n\n4. Rack of Lamb: good combination with the eggplants/zuccini. The lamb was flavorful with perfectly control of rare. \n\n5. Potato wrapped seabass: the fish was fresh and not overcooked. So it was good, but the seasoning side is rather weak and you came away feeling the fish was very fresh but that's about it. \n\n6. short rib: This is not on the menu but is by far my favorite of the night. It was slow cooked and to the degree that it's already super tender and fall right of the bone immediately. And super flavorful. \n\nmemorable: the waiter we had was a super salesman. He can talk non-stop, and make everything sounds like you will be regretting for the rest of your life if you don't get them.

Our server, Dean, was the sweetest, cutest little Vietnamese man ever! It was nice to see someone so passionate about the food and the restaurant, especially stressing how all the staff work as a team. I swear, about 5 different people besides Dean helped us that night - either cleared the tables, brought wine, brought food, asked if we were doing ok, etc. Amazing.\n\nFood: We received very good recommendations and EVERYTHING was exceptional. Sometimes you get one dish that wows you while the others don't. Not here. Each dish was pretty equal. We also made happy hour (til 7pm) so all wines and cocktails were $5.\n\n-Seared Foie with pears and custard brioche: hope you all can try this once before the ban. It was amazing.\n\n- Lobster broth: we were warned that this was prepared in the simplest way possible and that if we were looking for a heavier soup, this wasn't it. Ordered it anyway and loved it. Glad it wasn't heavy since we had ordered so many other dishes.\n\n- Potato-Wrapped Seabass: salty potato paired with a relatively blander but very smooth fish.

From his behavior, it was clear that he didn't like the fact that we didn't follow his recommendation of ordering 2 dishes per person and didn't like the fact that we didn't order any wine with our meals. Due to my severe lactose intolerance, I asked if it was possible to get my dish without butter.  He wasn't very accommodating or understanding of my condition.

The potato wrapped seabass ($20) didn't  live up to my expectations. The seabass was overcooked and dry. The only great thing about this dish was the crispy pieces of potatoes on top of the fish. It's a unique idea of a dish but failed in execution. We also ordered the maple leaf farm duck breast ($19). The duck breast was tender and juicy but lacked flavor. \n\nAs we were leaving, someone from our group decided that the owner needed to know about the terrible customer service we received.

I'm REALLY happy that they did because I had the perfect dinner experience last night.\n\nParking sucks around here especially on a Friday night so if you find yourself circling around the block, try the parking structure on Pierce Street.  It's only one block away and has meters so make sure to bring coins or pay via your smartphone.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant exactly at our reservation time and were seated almost immediately.  They gave us the table for 2 in front that gave us a view of the street and isolated us from the main dining area where it was much louder.  A perfect table to have a conversation without having to raise your voice, repeat yourself, and hope you heard the other person correctly.  It's also a great seat to have people on the street pass by and look at your dishes and say \"oh, that looks good...\"*drool*\n\nSince there were two of us, we played it smart and we each ordered something different for each course.  Here comes the break down:\n\nFirst course:\nTomales Bay Point Reyes Oysters:  A plate of 6 oysters that are super fresh.  Nice way to start off the meal.  The oysters are on the smaller side so I was craving for more.  \nLoch Duart Salmon Carpaccio:  Very generous slices of salmon that went well with the ingredients.  The crostini was a good way of contrasting the soft texture of the salmon.\nAfter the first course, I was definitely a fan.\n\nSecond course:\nSeared Scallops:  Oh man, these scallops were cooked to perfection!  They were fresh and tender, giving you that happy feeling as you ate each one.  The garlic and truffle sauce went well with the scallops.  Make sure to take the scallop and slide it across the plate to taste the sauce. Yum.\nTruffle Risotto:  One word:  Delicious.  Two types of mushrooms with reggiano cheese.  This dish was not too rich and cooked the way I like it.\nAfter the second course, I was in love with the food.\n\nThird course:\nTwo types of vanilla desserts:  Gelato and creme brulee.

I'm the type that researches my dining options diligently, and thus, the menus too. I pretty much know what I want before I ever step foot in a restaurant.\n\nI was here with a date and they sat us in a semi-secluded table by the window. Due to the layout of that part of the restaurant, we had to sit side-by-side. It was a good thing I liked my date! (Though I suppose even if I didn't, sitting side-by-side would mean I wouldn't have to look at him very much...)\n\nI was very impressed with Isa. The atmosphere was perfect for a date. Quaint, intimate, dim lighting (= flattering lighting), and not too loud. I had absolutely no complaints about any of the food either, which is rare.\n\nWe started with the MAINE LOBSTER BROTH (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=jG56L5FMQmMU6kZfwS6pNQ). My oh my, that was delicious. It had the exact same rich lobster-y flavour as a bisque, without the heaviness. Next was the FOIE GRAS with apples, huckleberry, and custard brioche (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=kW2AjUC3cp3j1FtdqvJY8Q). (My date had never tried it before so I HAD to order it for us. I could never date someone who was against the force-feeding of ducks to fatten up their livers for me to eat). The foie gras was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. The huckleberries provided a nice acidity to cut the fattyness of the foie. I also loved the fact that they put the brioche on the side instead of under the foie so that it wasn't soaked with fat.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the duck breast with beets, chevre, arugula and huckleberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=B8ovbnJn86OLbfdr36jqqA). The DUCK BREAST was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The chevre also went really well with the arugula. My date ordered the RACK OF LAMB with saut\u00e9ed eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, and lamb jus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=jSSJrDKf5J92eKlG2irFkQ). That was delicious too. The meat was cooked well. The saut\u00e9ed vegetables were so good that I ate most of them off his plate (I also need to date someone who'll share their food with me). We got a side of potato puree too (fancy term for mashed potatoes). They were also tasty and very creamy, but nothing spectacular.\n\nFor dessert we just split a CREME BRULEE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QINiEjMRGA7pKfvhPQtfBg?select=2J8Tee15TzN8UbSulA7vkA). Again, very good but pretty standard stuff.\n\nIt was a good date. But whether it was because of the food or the company, I'm not really sure. Maybe the two enhanced each other, or maybe the food was so good I didn't notice how little chemistry we might've had. I'd definitely come back to Isa, maybe on a weeknight to check out their prix fix menu.", "author": "Steph L."}

So quickly, it might be come one of my favorites around the Marina.  \n\nSo apparently, I'd been here before DAT.  Last year, a business partner hooked me up with some tickets for Pinot Days since his neighbor was somehow involved in the marketing or wineries.  Anyway, I found a picture of that menu and remembered how delectable everything was.\n\nThis time, we were doing DAT with a party of 7!  One thing that told us right away that this would be a great experience was that Isa was ONLY doing a DAT menu.  That's how committed they were.\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we ordered sole, steak, duck, scallops, goat cheese, a crab salad, salmon, gelato, semifreddo, granite, and cake.  Honestly, I still can't believe we got away with that quality of food for that inexpensively.  We basically shared everything family/tapas style and everything was either good or fantastic.  My favorites were the flank steak, the goat cheese, and the duck.  All of the desserts were good too, but we were too full to finish them.\n\nDefinitely a solid 4-star place, and the service was great.  I love how they have a front room and back room.  I've eaten in the back room twice now and it's so cozy.  Some things worth mentioning - anyone who knows, knows that parking around there is a BITCH so use the parking garages or cab it.  There are also (2) small unisex bathrooms so make sure you know where they are.", "author": "Dylan T."}

It seemed perfect since SF restaurant week was going on. We made reservations, put on our fancy pants and headed downtown for a romantic date night.  Be warned, this review is solely based on the restaurant week fixed menu. They offered a four course with a good selection. First we had potato leek soup and Endive fris\u00e9e salad. Not impressed. The soup was bland and the salad had a weird mixture of flavors. A bit too vinegary and bitter for my taste. Second course, we had salmon gaspachio and mussels. Better, the salmon was fatty and melts in your mouth. Mussels were nice and salty with a bit of acidity. Third course, we got seared scallop and iron flat stake. The scallop was perfectly cooked, tender, and had great taste. The steak was medium rare and it came with a bitter cheese sauce. The third course disappointed me a bit, it was way too heavy. You can definitely taste the butter in all the dishes they served here and that fat was building up in my tastebuds. I had to order a couple slices of lemon wedges because I couldn't handle the heaviness  of the meal.  Lastly, we had the grapefruit granite and amaretto. The grapefruit granite was nothing special, just shaved ice with grapefruit syrup over it. The amaretto was a lot better. It was creamy and you could taste bits of almond in every bite. Although it did have ice crystals forming in the ice cream. \n\nOverall, it was a good French experience for the price. But I would not come back here based on the tasting of the meals I had. I was expecting a lot more out of this place and unfortunately I was disappointed. The flavors weren't out there and nothing really screamed DELICIOUS. It was just OK with good service and a fancy atmosphere.", "author": "Winne L."}

You sit out on the patio but it's nice and warm and welcoming because it's enclosed in a tent and there's rows of sort of rustic picnic looking tables with tiny lanterns strung all over the place. It's haphazardly beautiful and a perfect date night place, if you were so inclined.\n\nThe food was on the whole very good. With the limited options, I think the soups were kind of on the oilier side (lobster broth and potato leek soup, I believe), but everything that followed was top notch. Since we were doing Dine About Town, we all tried a little of each others' food - the steak, the duck, the dungeness crab salad (ohmygoodness, YUM), the seriously never-ending bread basket, and the piece de resistance - the CREME BRULEE.

During this promotion, there is only the Dine About Town menu, so don't think you can get some paella til February! \n\nI started off with a couple glasses of wines--pinot (which the server said is their most popular) and a cab.  For $5/glass... keep 'em coming!\n\nFor the first course, I ordered the lobster soup. It was a clear soup (not creamy), and was made so you can just enjoy the taste of lobster. With that said, it doesn't come off at first as anything special. If anything, one might not appreciate the soup to its full extent. But you can tell it takes some time to thoroughly cook the lobster taste out.\n\nI chose the dungenness crab salad for my second course, which comes with tomatoes, apples, and grapefruit. This was such a good pick, not only because it's crab season, but because I don't think they added dressing onto this dish. All the juices were from the crab and fruits--different combinations of sweet flavors.\n\nOur table ordered the risotto, scallops, duck, and beef. Risotto was delicious, with the truffle oil and mushrooms. The only reservation about this dish is that it's simple. I make this similar dish once in a while. It's not difficult to make, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you order the scallops, it comes with 1.5 large ones. Beef brisket (?) comes with mashed potatoes and veggies (which were good). Duck platter comes with duck that's fairly rare. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the semifreddo. Yum! I've only had this one other time at Candybar, and I don't it was similar. This one is nutty and comes with three amaretto cookies.\n\nOverall, the food was decent. Happy hour was worth it. But what really blew this place away was the service.

You attempt to describe this dish to others but inevitably stutter to find the right words and end up resorting to a general description: \"That dish was great!\"\n\nThe Hudson Valley Grade A foie gras with apples, huckleberry, port and custard brioche could never be depicted with words.  Because once the aroma dissipates, once the taste leaves your mouth and the essence no longer lingers in your heart, only resonance is left.  But it has left a feeling of blissfulness in my memory.  The creative combination of fruit and foie gras was gastronomical.  Soft on the tongue and lightly sweetened, the custard brioche complemented the fruitfulness and saltiness of the dish quite well.  The display of huckleberry over foie gras surrounded by 4 apple balls and a pool of berry juice and port wine gave the dish a very artful appeal.  If cooking is art, then the Hudson Valley foie gras would be Chef Luke Sung's magnum opus.\n\nThe other dishes were splendid as well.  Though the seared scallops were a bit char-coaled for my taste, the brussel sprouts that accompanied it were surprisingly appetizing.  The short ribs were falling off the bone delicious!  It had just the right amount of fat to get me coming back for more.  Nevertheless, my sweet tooth was not fulfilled because the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake did not end the meal with a bang.\n\nThe atmosphere was not too pretentious for a restaurant of this caliber so don't be intimidated, EAT here!!

There was no question that I had to go back to the first place that turned me into a Dexter of water fowl. \n\nI blame Isa, because they have always been consistent in their delivery. I dare to say they might have single handedly given reason to pass the measure for how well they are able to turn disgust into lust. \n\nTo salt the wound in the face of the NIMBY city council, Isa decided it was an awesome idea to offer a \"Say Farewell  to Foie Gras\" dinner, featuring two different preparations; one with their classic pear, and the other mango. Picking the pear brought me back to the first time I shamefully turned the cheek to animal cruelty.\n\nThe risotto and the duck main courses went well with the (very, very) generously poured glasses of suggested wine, but came only secondary to the foie gras in its delivery. The seared scallops was by far one of the most impressive: They got the texture and tenderness perfect, allowing each piece to be cut like someone decided to crossbreed sea bass with prime rib.\n\nOur server was impeccable and professional, always keeping an eye on our tiny booth in the corner.

Monday night, although a holiday (MLK day), seemed pretty busy in ISA. As soon as we seated, the waiter came over talking to us about the menu. I thought it was rather rude that he was pointing to the menu w/ a pen and waiving the pen right in front of our faces while explaining the menu. We brought our bottle of red because the wine list at ISA was pretty small, However, our waiter didn't bother to let the person brining the wine taste the bottle before pouring full servings into our glasses. Finally we placed the order, the food took FOREVER to come out, and there were so many mistakes. For example, only 1 of our second courses made it to the table, after another 20 mins of waiting, nothing came, and all of a sudden one of the 3rd courses showed up at the table. I politely told the bus boy that we haven't received all our second courses yet. After another 15 mins, we finally got the other second course we should've gotten 35 mins ago. The funniest part was that the busers were so confused all around that one of them actually came up to our table and asked us \" what are you waiting for right now?\" REALLY? isn't that your job to make sure you're sending food out to the correct table w/ proper timing and not asking us to do your job for you? It doesn't help that we have to ask multiple times with multiple waiters to get a basket of bread. it's like playing russian roulette that we might get lucky to get  a buser who wouldn't instantly forget about our request when he turned around. geez...\n\nalthough food was decent, duck breast and flat iron steak were cooked nicely, steamed mussels was also nicely done, the service kinda ruined the whole experience for us.\n\ni have no idea why the service was THAT bad the night we went, but i hope to see improvements because some of the things that happened during our dinner were too surprising to be true for ISA's reputation.", "author": "Joyce C."}

The food, was good, if you had not gone previously you would be wowed, but after 5 years the menu is the same, i did not know that was possible especially in SF. \n\nAfter placing our drinks, i noticed i had a knife and my dining partner had a fork....so i had to flag him down, only for him to act like it was doing us a favor to bring us a complete set of dinnerware. Also, none of our dishes had an explanation, just kinda dropped off, luckily they were exactly the same dishes i used to order 5 years ago when this was one of my favorite places. I ordered 4 plates and our crab salad never came out, and i did not realize it until after finishing our other dishes, i called the server over and explained to him we were missing a dish but since it was a salad, it made no sense to get it at the end. He just kept saying \"it's cool if you want it, i'm cool i can bring it,\" but it was the manner if which he said it and he actually NEVER apologized nor offered some kind of gesture to make up for it. We were going to switch it out with something else but the awkwardness of the situation was so off putting we just asked for the check. He came back 3 minutes later and said \" i thought it was my fault but it's not, it was the kitchen, i just wanted you to know that\"...oookkkkaayyyy...0 stars for service 2 stars for the food and the menu that has yet to be changed in 5 years.", "author": "S C."}

Hostess gave us updates and options. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Service was on point. \n\nFOOD: Isa has a prix fixe menu regularly. The DAT menu is actually 6 apps, 7 entrees, 4 desserts. The dishes are great for sharing. \n\nAppetizers (salmon carpaccio, dugeness crab salad, butter lettuce salad, arugula salad, Laura chenel goat cheese, PEI mussels) -- I recommend everything but the crab salad -- the weakest dish on the appetizer list. Might have been better if it came out before the stronger flavored dishes.\n\nSecond Course (scallops, seasonal fish, spaghetti, truffle risotto, range chicken, duck breast, flat iron steak)-- we have everything but the steak and doubled up on the duck breast. \nSeasonal fish is petrale sole. Everything was excellent. I don't normally order spaghetti or risotto, but like William Hung, I have no regrets at all. Each plate was very hearty -- the duck breast was one of the bigger plates. \n\nThird Course (Grapefruit granite, semifreddo all'amaretto, vanilla bean gelato, vanilla bean creme brulee) -- we had everything but the grapefruit. Semifreddo is very almondy, if you're into that, and goes well with expresso. \n\nPRICE: Prix fixe ~$35. Mix drinks $8-9. Tip included for larger parties. Damper -- they have a 3 course prix fixe for $29. I am sure the DAT is a better deal... I hope.\n\nTIPS: Make reservations early. Parking can get difficult. Isa has parking reservation service but we didn't try it. Happy hour before 7pm -- $5 drinks. Free wine glass per prix fixe Sun-Thurs. Choices for vegetarians were delicious! Kitchen is small -- our dishes came out a few at a time which was great for sharing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Definitely a good choice for DAT. Great choice if you have a vegetarian friend. Flavors match like Pixars Ratatouille. Breathe the same air as 49ner's great Joe Montana!", "author": "Stanley L."}

Made reservations in advance and were seated within 3 minutes of walking in. The lighting was dim and ambiance was quite intimate. The perfect romantic date. Oh wait, it's just my sister. Eugh. We made sure to order different dishes so we could taste more of the menu.\n\nFirst course: \n\nLobster Broth- I felt like I was drinking a small swimming pool for shrimp mixed with some tomato juice. Super raw. Even the shrimp was a bit below average and seemed a bit overcooked so this soup was only half eaten.\n\nPotato and Leek Soup- DELISHHHH! I love leeks and this just had enough flavor and the perfect amount of potatoes. My sister had a miss on hers so she kept trying to sneak in spoonfuls when I wasn't looking.\n\nSecond course: \n\nYellowfin Tuna Tartare- Can't really vouch for this since I don't like raw seafood but my sister seemed to really enjoy it and I guess tiny bit of seaweed salad met my standards.\n\nMussels: OH MY GOD. FLAVOR EXPLOSION IN MY MOUTH! This dish was big enough to be my whole dinner! I felt like Isa reserved their biggest and tastiest mussels just for me. I even got seconds on bread because I wanted to soak up all the delicious garlicky mussel broth. Take that, lobster broth! \n\nThird course:\n\nDuck Breast- YUM!!! I think this baby was cooked to tender perfection. The salad complimented the duck and the vinaigrette married the flavors together. I would definitely order this one again.\n\nFlat Iron Steak- My sister thought it was too gamey. I had no problem with it. Ate all of it because I didn't want to ask for a to-go box. But flavors as a whole, it wasn't very memorable.\n\nFourth course:\n\nCreme Brulee- Soft and fluffy. And sweet flavors.\n\nSemifreddo- Great presentation and tasted a bit more like coffee rather than almonds but delicious nonetheless.\n\nWhat I really loved about this place was their service. I was seated near the kitchen so it kind of took away from the ambiance but servers and waiters kept checking up on us which sort of made up for it. Our waiter was a bit awkward but was very attentive. While my sister was doing her usual photo shoot with the food, I was moving the tiny candle around to give her more light. By the third course, I accidentally tipped it too far and put out the light which made my table dark and bummed my out for a good 10 min. When our waiter came by to refill our water, he noticed our light was out. \"OH, what happened to the candle?\" I innocently responded, \"I don't know...\" He immediately told us he'll grab us another one and 20 seconds later, I got a new candle on the table. YESSSS. Dinner just got 100x better. So thank you, dude! It's the little things that count! All in all, food was pretty good (minus lobster broth) and service was terrific. I'd definitely come back when I'm feelin like a baller.", "author": "Arleen F."}

It was the first time we decided to try DAT and ISA has always been one of the places I've had booked marked for months to try.\n\nOur waiter had issues with our table and ended up moving us twice, even though we had a reservation made weeks ago and were on time. The menu was extremely long and there were definitely too many items we wanted to try. The portions were small and I am assuming it has to do with the promotion of DAT, but it was okay because the 4 course meal makes up for it. The soups, if I were paying full price, I would skip. Nothing out of the ordinary, pretty plain and bland. The appetizers, the ahi tuna was delicious! For the main entree, I would skip the scallops because you only get 2 scallops for the entire meal. The steak and the lamb chops were very good, but not the best I've tried. The dessert was great, the creme brule was just perfect, so was the alfredo. I don't think I would come back here again, but I am glad we got to try it out.", "author": "Karina A."}

The other items we had: lobster broth, scallops, & dungeness crab salad were nice, but if you're wondering why i'd give the overall experience 5 stars:\n\nAmbiance - very nice, easily date material. We sat in the outdoorsy patio and it had alot of natural light, but not too much. \n\nService - This was probably one of the nicest experiences I had in a while. The waiter really showed he had a passion for food & wine. He recommended the Sedna which blew my mind: I was never a big fan of Chardonnay til he insisted on the pairing. I could drink a bottle of that on the daily. \n\nMy date told him about my eyes rolling back when I was eating the risotto, and we stayed a bit after the check to hear about a story of another patron who had a drastic reaction to the food @ Isa. Just to make sure I truly enjoyed it THAT much, he had the courtesy of asking my date, \"Does he do that often?\" (cue The Weeknd - Often (Kygo remix) \n\nI don't remember his name, but it's a older gentleman with glasses.

We started with Soju cocktails- a yummy blend of blackberries, soju, and champagne was a lovely start to the deliciousness to come. \n\nWe began with the crab salad, simply sauteed Sea of Cortez prawns, and yellowfiun tuna, which was served with (a scant tossing of) sriracha, avo, and seaweed... and low sodium soy, but far too much of it. The Dungeness crab salad became my favorite thing I put in my mouth on this day- up to this point. It was actually more crab than salad- a generous portion of fresh local crab with grapefruit, julienned apple, and tarragon atop a lovely display of butter lettuce. The tuna was good, but far too salty in my opinon. However, the quality of the fish was top notch. As for the prawns, they were great, but, as the name implies, simple. The prawns themselves really stood out, as it should be, in my opinion.\n\nWe then shared the scallops, truffle risotto, and potato-wrapped sea bass. The scallops were divine, but small- a fairly inefficient dish, albeit a lovely taste. It basically amounted to four bites. However, I loved the brussel sprouts tossed with bacon that accompanied them, making it slightly heartier. The potato wrapped sea bass was heavenly! The fluffy potato wrap- with its brown butter, lemon, and tomato confit- was a perfect compliment to the fluffy, delicate, and succulent sea bass. The truffle risotto was nothing short of life-changing. 'Nuff said there.\n\nI will say however, that all this food, although delicious, was very small and pricey. One of my friends ended up ordering another entree and a dessert, which she ate in their entirety and seemed to enjoy. We had wine with the meal, and our bill was $223, so a very spendy dinner, but a delightfulk splurge nonetheless!", "author": "Chelsea T."}

Judging from the pictures, the patio looked like a cozy place to dine (which it was, despite SF's cold climate).\n\n--What was exceptional?\nThe dishes are \"family\" style.  My friend and I easily shared our dishes.  Our main courses were the highlight of the meal.  We shared: the grilled flat iron steak and the duck breast.  I was a little weary of the steak as my friend wanted her steaks \"medium-well,\" whereas I prefer mine still moo-ing (not literally!).

There's a little tablet like thing on the counter which is filled with games. An interesting way to kill time. They have an open kitchen (the wall separating is not there) it looks like so you can see the kitchen people make food.\n\n== Food ==\n\nI went here for their Dine about Town special and they did not scrimp out on portions or selection of food. The ~37 price got four dishes with choices that included dishes such as oysters and mussels.\n\nFor the first dish, they ran out of their lobster bisque so there was only the potato soup left. A bit disappointed, but their potato soup was simply great.\n\nThe second dish had a bunch of different choices such as mussels, tuna tartare, to oysters. All those were simply delicious and quite amazing. One plus side of the mussel dish is that you can use the broth as dipping sauce for the free bread they give. The broth is tasty so it's so worth it.\n\nThe third dish is the main dish, which I got the duck meat dish. It was pretty good, but it wasn't amazing to me. The special rib dish looked quite amazing compared to the duck. \n\nThe last dish was dessert, which I got a grapefruit granite. It tasted like a grapefruit snow cone. It was alright.\n\nDrink: Try the #7 drink. I recommend it.\n\n== Service ==\n\nGood service overall. Waitress came by and checked up on us a few times. Bread was replaced whenever asked.

The tablets they have at the bar are pretty cool, especially the fun games and couples' quiz (...miserable fail...)  \n\nThe smooth potato and leek soup was very bland and tasted watered-down, but the lobster broth with prawns was a lot better.  I had the yellowfin tuna and was not impressed by the freshness of the seafood.  The entree I ordered came with 2 tiny scallops that weren't cooked properly...over-seared on the tops/bottoms and then too slimy and rubbery on the inside.  I tried some of the duck breast also and didn't like that dish either b/c it seemed like it was seasoned with pepper only, but I did enjoy the latke it came with.  I had the vanilla bean creme brulee and semi-freddo for dessert.

Ambiance was great, not too loud but definitely lively and you could have a conversation without yelling at each other.  Servers were very helpful and dishes were ALMOST perfectly timed when coming out (had to tell them to slow it down in the middle of the entree section).  But they kept our bread bowl and wine glasses filled so I can't complain.\n\nCame here with 3 gfs and decided to go family style to take advantage of all their offerings and pretty much went with everything our awesome server, Jared, suggested.  \n\nApps-\nSalmon Carpaccio: My favorite of the apps we got.  Salmon was so deliciously fresh and the toppings complemented it very well.\nGoat Cheese:  Another good one but you definitely need to eat this with the bread, otherwise the cheese overloads you unless you like that sort of thing.  \nDungeness Crab Salad:  I also liked this dish.  It served with grapefruit as a topping and I'm not a fan of grapefruit, but I couldn't really taste it so the crab wasn't overpowered like other reviewers mentioned.  Maybe we got a grapefruit-less one?\nMussels: Mussels were average but the highlight was the consistent dunking and soaking of the bread in the amazing sauce they use.\n\nEntrees-\nSeared Scallops: TRUFFLE OIL!  That's what made this dish so amazing.  Gave the mashed potatoes and scallops a great, extremely addicting flavor.\nDuck Breast: Was really excited that this came with a salad since almost everything previous had been very heavy.  Duck was good..not too red and the potato thing that came with it was a surprising delight.\nTruffle Risotto:  Again...truffle oil.  Can't get enough of the stuff.  The mushrooms do overpower everything else though so if you don't like mushrooms, don't get this.  But if you do, definitely get this!\nFlat Iron Steak:  Before coming here, I was so excited about the steak because I needed me some red meat.  Since this was the last dish we got, we were all sooo full by then but when this came out, I couldn't stop myself from drooling.  It was cooked PERFECTLY medium rare.  Tender and succulent and delicious.  Again, very happy that this came with veggies too.\n\nDessert-\nGrapefruit Shaved Ice:  Like I said, not a fan of grapefruit so I only had a bite of this and left it alone.\nCreme Brulee:  I don't think I've ever had a bad creme brulee, but this was seemed particularly good.  Creme brulee is creme brulee to me though, I'm indifferent.\nVanilla Bean Gelato w/ Biscotti:  Vanilla Bean flavor wasn't too overpowering so very good.  Again, this is something almost everyone could like.\nSemifreddo All'Amarretto:  MY FAVEEEEEE.  Almond ice cream was so so SO good.  I was so sad that I was too full to finish the rest of it and that it had to go to waste :(\n\nI have no bad things to say about Isa so stop reading reviews and just go try it out!", "author": "Jane N."}

There were at least 5-7 items to choose from for each of the course!  Portions were generous and food tasted great! I'm not sure I'd call it a \"French Restaurant\" though.  I'd be inclined to think that it was more of a continental cuisine.\n\nThey have $5 wine and soju cocktails before 7pm (I'm not sure if it's M-F or 7 days a week though).\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nAppetizers:\nDungeness Crab salad - easily enough for 3 people to share as an appetizer.  It was refreshing!\n\nTomales Bay Oysters - half dozen.  Not sharable - I think I can easily have 2 dozens of oysters by myself haha.  Oysters were fresh and the dipping sauce (though not necessary - I like mine sans anything!) was actually pretty good\n\nBaked goat cheese - was perfect with their bread (we were never out of bread on the table!)\n\nEntrees:\n*Pork Chop with baked polenta and sauteed veges - huge pork chop!\n*Duck with roasted beets, arugula and goat cheese - flavourful (portion wise not as big as the pork chops)\n*Mushroom Risotto with truffle - creamy but not mushy.  It was too hot when it was served so had to wait a while but it was very good\n*Scallops - probably least exciting dish out of the lot\n*Chicken with mashed potatoes (I think it looked like mashed potatoes) - I didn't get to try any of this so I can't say - she was sitting too far away from me\n\nDessert:\nAll of us except for one had their Semi freedo with Amaretto.  It was served with 4-5 round biscotti.  Beautiful but we were so full by the time dessert came round that none of us really managed to finish.  One girl ordered the goat cheese dessert drizzled with honey and served with candied walnuts.  It was a massive chunk of goat cheese  - imagine 50 pieces of salami stacked on top of  each other. That was how thick it was (and it was round).  It was a little too much goat cheese for everyone's liking. Candied walnuts were good though.\n\nThe bar area and the restaurant area at the back have very different atmosphere.  Bar - very dark and romantic feeling. Then when you get to the restaurant area out the back it felt like we were outdoors (actually I think it was an outdoor area that was converted into an indoor area with a cover - so i'm not sure how quiet it'll be on a rainy day)\n\nAll up though we had a fabulous time.

Wow, this is as good as it gets!\n\nUnlike most places, they have a very good assortment to choose from for each course.  We never felt constrained in anyway.  And, the way they serve the courses, they are intended/designed to be shared - a really nice way to dine with friends.\n\nWe were a foursome.  We started with 3 orders of Crab Salad and 1 Steamed Mussels.  Both were fantastic and easily shared.  They were both generous portions with lots of crab on the salad and plenty of mussels in a fantastic herbed broth.  We all shared and we could not leave the broth alone as we sopped it all up with the wonderful, endless bread.\n\nOur mains were 2 Duck Breast w/Sautee Spinach w/pine nuts and bacon in a wonderful Balsamic sauce - a terrific and satisfying combination.  We had one Truffle Risotto and one Seared Sea Scallops.  Again, we were totally thrilled withe quality of food and the wonderfully efficient and warm service.  The duck was tender, moist, full-flavored - done perfectly.  The scallops were also done just right with a beautiful sear with perfect interiors.  The risotto was just as good.  You could, genuinely, taste the truffle!  Texture was perfect.\n\nOur desserts were 2 Creme Brulees and 2 amaretto Semifreddo.  The latter was good but the Creme Brulee was the best I can recall having in a long long time - perfect vanilla flavor, perfect texture - creamy/custardy and nice caramelization of the sugar top.\n\nOH, AND DID I MENTION THE FREE GLASS OF WINE THAT CAME WITH OUR MEAL??!!

Hostesses were attentive - checking on when table will be ready and telling you. Busy Saturday night but still seated 10 people in the backyard area that's sealed and heated. \n\nThe waiter pointed out that Isa serves dishes family style. Our group wasn't really on board with that so we just ordered like we normally would 1-2 dishes per person as suggested. Unfortunately, the way they serve dishes wasn't making our evening i.e. some people were left hungry sitting and waiting an hour for their dish to be served (big dislike.) The way they serve actually makes more sense for a couple or even four people sharing their food (a more intimate setting) but really doesn't work for large groups. No one wants to share their rack of lamb (4 pieces) with 10 ppl!!\n\nI ordered an arugala salad and seared scallops. The salad was refreshing but I'd prefer that they slice the oranges into smaller pieces so I get the same ratio of arugala to orange ratio b/c arugala is bitter.\n\nSeared scallops were alright I'm not big on scallops but this dish didn't change my mind about them. The mashed potatoes were good and creamy. The asparagus tasted like it was boiled then pan fried - it was kind of mushy. I like my asparagus grilled or baked so it's more crispy.", "author": "Donna C."}

My boyfriend and I were first time diners and were really excited to try this place out as we are big foodies in the city. \n\nMy biggest complaint in no shape or form is from the food. Everything we had from the 2 appetizers (tuna & crab salad), to the two entrees  (sole and lamb), to the side dish (wild mushrooms) and finally the dessert (flour less chocolate cake) was excellent.\n\nWhere this place fell short was THE SERVICE - it almost ruined the entire meal. I pick up on a lot of things since I used to be a bartender and waitress. That said, the waiter greeted us very friendly but he talked EXTREMELY fast... it was like he was either nervous or was trying to win a game of  \"who can say the most words in under 2 mins!\".\n\nAlthough he was knowledgeable, he came off as really trying to sell the fact that this place has  \"been around for 11 years and the chef really knew what he was doing.\"(which I don't doubt due to the delicious food).\n\nHad he not set our expectations so high... maybe the lack of service would have gone less noticeable.  OK that's A LIE... We waited forever. Our wine and appetizers arrived fairly quickly.  Then there was quite some lag time and a disappearing waiter act from  our appetizers to getting our 1st entree. \n\nThat wait however was extremely short compared to how LONG  we waited for the 2nd entree. About 30 mins after the 1st entree, we finally had to ask if they forgot our 2nd plate - that is after we had to hunt the waiter down once again. We nicely suggested \"hey we thought we lost you\" as he finally came to the table.. trying to get him to realize it had been some time. He made a comment about how the lamb rack takes time to cook (even though we ordered the lamb shank) which made me think that comment was a \"doh\" I forgot moment. \n\nLong story short another waiter (not ours) brought out a single plate of mushrooms (our side order) which sat for about 10 mins till the 2nd plate finally arrived.\n\nThe last straw was when our clean plates were left sitting at the table for an additional 30 mins after we were finished and cleared by yet another waiter (not ours). When the bill however did arrive somehow our waiter was right on cue and how funny - very attentive! \n\nI'm usually NOT this picky - but when I see bad service it really gets under my skin, especially  when you are shelling out about $150 bucks for dinner. I'm not into excuses and there shouldn't  have been any because by the time we were eating the place had really died down.\n\nWe  arrived at 9:30 for our reservations and left close to midnight.. would have liked to go out after but we were too tired from waiting (and our own food coma) to even fathom the idea of one more drink.\n\nFood:  4 starts\n\nService: 2 stars", "author": "Callie O."}

He added that they were expecting a large party soon and that we would have to leave when they arrived. I was shocked by that kind of treatment.

Was a bit nervous at first because the place is a nice Cal-French establishment and we have in the past felt uncomfortable at other fine dining restaurants when we have brought our daughter. Not the case here, we opted to sit in the heated covered patio in the back which I think is the better option. Noticed two other large families, one with a kid and one with a baby. Mind you our daughter knows how to behave herself and the other tables children did as well, don't expect a Johnny Rockets vibe with kids running around all over the place. \nThe food is served in portions that are slightly larger than an appetizer and slightly smaller than a normal sized entree. They encourage sharing. My wife and I ordered 4 dishes plus a cheese plate which for us was plenty even giving our daughter bites along the way. However if you are a big eater 1 to 2 more dishes would probably equate to a heavy meal. You order everything up front and the chef brings things out as they are ready and in the order that makes the most sense as far as flavor progression. They have an excellent wine list however most things seemed to pair well with Pinot noir. \n\nAlthough everything was excellent the 2 dishes that really stood out were the potato crusted halibut, and the mushroom and truffle risotto, Both were outstanding.

(Please refer to the picture I've uploaded). This God awful thing came out looking like a piece of turd, not just any piece of turd BUT A BURNT PIECE OF TURD!! As a chef, how do you allow something like that to leave your kitchen?? I've never seen foie gras like this! It was NOT seared but more burnt, if it were seared the searing marks from the grill would be visible (it was non-exisitent in this case). BTW, I ate a HUGE piece of burnt foie gras and it was painful! Usually when you cut into foie gras, it should be a smooth transition from the time your knife cuts through the top to the bottom. BUT not with this foie gras, I felt like I was struggling to cut this into pieces. There was also this stringy rubber like consistency that I've NEVER seen in foie gras, it looked like the phlegm you spit out into a sink!! *BARF* \n\nHOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO \"BLAND\"\nGRILLED GOLDEN GATE NATURAL ANGUS FLAT IRON STEAK w/ haircots verts, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce- The flat iron steak was cooked medium rare, exactly what I asked for BUT the steak was extremely bland. I found myself trying to grab as much of the moutarde verte as I could to flavor this thing. Why didn't I use the bordelaise sauce? Oh, because it was overpoweringly salty and made the dish even more unappetizing. The fingerling potatoes were undercooked, it was tough cutting into it and when I bit into it, it was pretty darn raw. The haircots verts was the best thing on the dish because it had a snap to it when you bit into it and it was seasoned nicely. \n\nTHERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT\nVANILLA CREME BRULEE- This was the best thing out of the entire meal, even then that's not saying much because the crust of the creme brulee was very very VERY thick (that's what she said). Usually when you have creme brulee, it's fairly easy to crack the surface by one top of your spoon. Well in this case it took both my friend and I 2-3 taps until the surface broke, we looked at each other confused and wondering is creme brulee suppose to be like this? If you're not careful eating this, you might just end up stabbing your mouth. Though the surface was tough, the inside was nice and creamy. \n\nSERVICE\nI felt like they were a bit unorganized, we got our entrees while we were still working on our appetizers and we had to maneuver plates around just to make room. Also, utensils were taken away after my appetizer. When my entree was placed in front of me, I was looking for utensils and there were none so I had to ask for  fork and knife. -_-\" Though I felt like the service was unorganized, they were very attentive and our waters were always refilled. \n\nCONCLUSION\nThe pros could NOT outweigh the cons.

Or as intimate as it can be because I am aware this place can be loud.  We were taken to the back patio and was seated in the very front of the patio.  Next to the doorway.  Near the bathroom. Where everyone has to walk by.  Inches away from a party of 10 or so.  We might as well have been a part of that party because that's how close we were.  Not quite the intimate seating I had expected.  I look around and I see an empty table for 2 available.  I asked to change tables but a couple had just been seated there.  Shortly after, another table became available, so we switched to a table in the back.\n\nIt was dine about town, so for appetizers we had dungeness crab salad and mussels.  Crab salad was good, but it was so simple that I feel like I could make it myself.  Mussels were good too and I enjoyed dipping the complimentary bread into the broth.  The bread was really addictive. \n\nI added the foie gras since I've never really had foie gras before.  It's definitely not my thing and thank goodness because I would've been sad about the ban.  It didn't taste irony, which is good, but it was soooo soft and mushy.  Paired with the brioche and it was just soft and more softness.  I needed some texture.\n\nFor entrees, we had the duck breast and the flat iron steak.  The duck was alright, but it would've been better if the skin was crispy.  The sauce wasn't very spectacular.  We waited for a long time for the flat iron steak to come out.  They started clearing our table to get ready for dessert and that's when we said we haven't gotten the steak yet.  Turns out, they accidentally had given it to the guy next to us, even though he had eaten his entree already.  So, finally the steak comes out.  But there's mustard on it.  And we had asked for no mustard.  So we just didn't eat it.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the semifreddo and the vanilla gelato.

What better time to try it then now?\n\nFor $22 the waiter boasts you get a generous size; larger than any other establishment would dare to serve (my words, not his).  So with great gusto my BF and I ordered it and shared it among the rest of our party.  \n\nIt came out a glistening hunk of meaty organ surrounded in a (red) sauce and accompanied with a type of bread(?).  The waiter suggest some sort of wine (I don't remember the name) with a flourish.  I vouch for the wine because I am testy about eating liver of any kind.  God forbid I taste the pate in bahn mi!\n\nI. DID. NOT. LIKE. IT.  \n\nIf this is what the French think of as fancy then I want to be a stinking, lowest class, loser who eats from the dollar menu @ McDonalds.\n\nOkay, so enough about my personal triumph over liver.  It won, I lost.  The wine did NOT help.\n\nWe also got the spicy Tuna salad which I adored.  I could have eaten the whole thing by myself but, alas, I had to share.  It was wonderful and I insist everyone try it (unless you don't like raw fish).\n\nAbout the entrees:  I ordered the Golden Gate (?) flat iron steak.  First of all, it is not golden, or even red, like the Golden Gate Bridge.  That's okay because I like steak anyways.\n\nThey had put this fancy schmancy wasabi bernaise sauce over the steak which rendered it inedible to me.  My BF liked it however, so I traded my non-tainted slices with his pure steak.  Oh yeah, the steak was sliced.\n\nThe sides that came with it were absolutely HEAVENLY!  I loved the fingerling potatoes, just crisp enough on the edges to make way for the salty, starchy insides.  And was that a type of balsamic reduction it was basking in?  Ah, delicious.  Truly foods for the gods.  The string beans were also good but that's because I have a special place in my heart for that particular vegetable.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the amaretto (almond) gelato.  It was a generous serving (1 1/2 scoops) with little amaretto cookies dotting the side.  Absolutely delicious.  It was easily the lightest, most airy ice cream I've ever had the chance to devour.  Everyone else ordered creme brulee which was good but nothing about it stood out.  I think I picked a good dessert choice (:\n\nAnyways, this place is really, really expensive.  The waiter spent quite a good deal of time explaining to us how to order (which really means how to extract the most money out of us).  We wisely ordered what we wanted and most of us were overjoyed with the results.\n\nI'd probably come here again if they lowered their prices (considering what they served).  It was also extremely crowded, as if they were trying to push as many tables as closely together as possible.  It was uncomfortable to be less than 3ft away from your neighboring diners.  They were extremely well staffed though.  Our food came out very quickly (though our waiter told us it'd be 30 minutes in between dishes) and everyone was very friendly and helpful.\n\nI'd say, go here if you can afford it.", "author": "Kimiko Q."}

Party of five of us came for Dine-About-Town and they had their entire menu available for it, not just a few choices. The covered and heated outdoor seating brings an atmosphere that you don't often get in the city. The staff was knowledgeable about the food and the owner was walking around all night making sure everyone was satisfied. The only thing that I didn't like is that they have a small kitchen so when it is busy they don't bring everyone's food out at the same time. This wasn't an issue for us since we were all sharing from each others plates and wouldn't be an issue if you are not in a group.\n\nThe food was fantastic. We purposely avoided the Foie Gras because I heard they burn it to a crisp, and saw pictures of it on Yelp. What we did order was top notch. Highlights from the meal include:\n\nSteamed PEI Mussels - some of the best I have ever had\nBaked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese - hot, savory and delicious\nTruffle Risotto - I am not a risotto fan and this was fantastic\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast - a must order!\n\nAppetizers are in the $10-15 range. Entrees are in the low $20s. They have a prix fix menu for $29.95 Sun-Thur if you want to save some money, but it does not include the duck breast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-16", "description": "After spending 20 minutes circling the area in search of a parking space, I finally found a spot about 4 blocks from Isa. Not bad right? WRONG. Especially if you decided to wear 3.5 inch heel booties 'cause \"it looks cute with your outfit.\" ESPECIALLY if you had to sprint 4 blocks in those same heels because you found parking 5 minutes before your reservation. A word to the wise, don't wear heels if you're driving to someplace with crappy parking...\n\nIsa. I've never been a huge fan of French cuisine, namely because of the notoriously small portions. But wow, Isa filled my heart and my tummy. \n\n\nMy BFF and I came here for the Dine About Town special. I had the salmon carpaccio, flat iron steak, and semifreddo amaretto, a glass of zinfandel, and a glass of really dry bubbly. I don't usually drink that much during a meal, but tonight we were being fancy, so why not go all out? My friend ordered mussels steamed in white wine, grilled fish (I think it was cod), and creme brulee.  \n\nimpressive: \n- salmon carpaccio: The salmon was very fresh! The capers, lemon, & cr\u00e8me fraiche were a nice touch. \n\n- angus flat iron steak: YUM. The steak was rather small, but it was cooked just the way I like my steak (medium-well). It was topped off with moutarde verte & an amazing bordelaise sauce. I believe moutarde verte is some sort of horseradish garnish because it tasted a little like wasabi. (I looked this up on Google, but only learned that \"moutarde\" is some sort of French profanity.)\n\n- steamed mussels: I hate shellfish, but today I decided to give mussels another chance. Although I still don't like the texture of mussels in general, the flavor of these was good enough to make me overlook that. The sauce was buttery with an alcoholic kick to it. (I love alcohol in food.)\n\n- semifreddo all' amaretto: Almond ice cream with 3 little almond biscuits. The ice cream was rich and creamy.\n\n\n\nmeh: \n- \"seasonal fish\": I don't remember what kind of fish this was, but it tasted like cod. The flavor was rather bland.\n\n\n\nsome observations:\n\n- My best friend and I had a dinner reservation for 6:15pm, but for some reason it was pushed back to 6:30pm. She was not notified of this change. A 15 minute delay isn't a big deal, but it would've been nice to receive a heads up or something---just as a courtesy. \n\n- The servers are very friendly, but are clearly amateurs. Our main server left after taking our drink orders, just as I was about to tell him we were ready to order everything else. There were times when a server would awkwardly mosey on by our table with an inquisitive look; but just as quickly, he'd disappear without a word.\n\nWe were served our food without proper descriptions. The server brought our mussels and happily announced our \"mushrooms are ready\". He also set down our tiny mussel-forks and said he'd bring us more \"spoons.\" I found this pretty endearing because of the server's confidence. English was obviously not his forte, so I can't give him crap for butchering the food names. However, a different server brought our other dishes without telling us what they were. Not cool. \n\nWhen we finished our main course, another server came and began rolling up the brown paper place mats before asking us to move our glasses. That would've been a liquidy disaster, had we not moved our 2 glasses of water, 2 glasses of bubbly, and my glass of red away in time. \n\n\nOverall, the food is pricey, but worth a try. Service is not exactly professional, but a smile & proper manners are often enough for me. \n\nOh yeah, expect to have a fun time looking for parking.", "author": "Lillian D."}

The ambiance is great, it was a lively environment (not super dimly lit and hush quiet). The only downside is that we were sitting along the \"wall\" and the rain was dripping down onto the backs of our jackets. :( Service was great though, waiter was friendly, and they were absolutely fantastic(!) about refilling water and bread. \n\nOkay onto food, first of all - the bread was fresh and still warm when it arrives on our table. Great texture and so good, I think we ate a couple of baskets of that alone. :)\n\nAppetizers\n-Steamed mussels: this was a sizable portion of mussels in a light tomato sauce. It was seasoned well and the mussels were tender. \n-Crab salad: crab and fruit on a butter lettuce. The presentation was fantastic, the taste is sort of what it sounds like. Not bad. \n-Salmon carpaccio: I don't have a lot of experience with salmon, but I tried it and it definitely tasted fresh and had a good texture.  \n-Goat cheese: maybe we're not huge goat cheese fans, but this one didn't go well with our group. It was just very strong. Maybe it grows on you?\n\nEntree\n-Seared scallops: scallops were definitely good and well cooked. I would only recommend this dish if you like brussel sprouts though (because you get a ton!), but the plus side is there is real bacon on top :D\n-Mushroom risotto: this was delicious, very rich but not super dense. I think it also had truffle in it, yummy!\nSeasonal fish: ours was the petra sole. This came out great, it had that perfect flaky texture. \n-Duck breast: I am neutral on this, the meat was tender (but my opinion is slightly biased since I don't like duck that much).\n\nDessert\n-Creme brulee: this came out in a relatively deeper dish, and had a thick shell of caramelized sugar on top that for some of us was pretty burnt. I personally don't mind that burnt taste and I like when the shell is thicker, but it depends on if you like it that way. the creme itself was really smooth and in the middle in terms of light or heavy. \n-Vanilla gelato: can't go wrong with ice cream! :)\n-Amaretto semifreddo: not a huge fan, but it was interesting to see what a semifreddo was (like a semi frozen custard).\n\nOverall great dining experience!", "author": "Linda L."}

I received a call the day of by a very friendly and polite gar\u00e7on to verify my reservations which was nice. Even though I had reservations, my friends and I still had to wait ten minutes for our seats, but it was understandable since the restaurant seemed to be extremely busy. Between the three of us plus two more who were there for good company and wine, we had a great time with wonderful food and awesome service. We ordered:\n\n-crab salad: I wasn't a big fan of the crab salad because it wasn't seasoned well and the presentation made it look sparse however the butter lettuce cups and apples it was served with were very fresh.\n-steamed mussels: this was meant to be an appetizer dish, but it came in an entree sized portion, which was a pleasant surprise. The wine reduction sauce it came with was delicious with the bread and the mussels tasted fresh and cooked just right.\n-maple leaf farm duck breast: it was cooked a tasty medium rare with a side of a goat cheese and arugula salad. The duck was extremely moist and delicious, the texture and seasonings made it taste almost like I was having steak. Yum\n-Herb roasted chicken: I usually don't order chicken when there's other meatier options on the menu, but my friend did so I just had to try it. The chicken took longer to arrive at our table than the rest of the food, but it was well worth the wait. The chicken was delicious with its herb seasonings and very moist.\n-foie gras: this was hands down the BEST part of the meal. It was perfectly seared and served with a perfectly toasted piece of bread. It was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH SPECTACULAR!\n-creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: my friend ordered and I had a bite to try. It wasn't the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had, but it was pretty good.\n-semifreddo all'ameretto: I really like the semifreddo here. It was tasty, light, and came with some cookies to provide a textural difference in the dish. \n\nAll in all, the food was delicious paired with great company and a lively ambiance gave this restaurant five stars!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-04", "description": "Party of 4. \n\nBut wait, I came here with 14 people and we had no idea how inappropriate a group of our size was for this restaurant. Understandably most restaurants in SF on a Friday night will have challenges with such a big party, but Isa's stands out as particularly ill-suited for dealing with more than 4 people per table.\n\nIn explaining the ordering process (1 starter, 1 entree per dinner suggested), our waiter noted that all dishes would come out as ready from the kitchen...eluding to a situation where we were preparing ourselves for a full on fight to ensure we at least got a bite of the dish we ordered. The anxiety and anticipation of the process, apparently due to a very small kitchen, had us uncomfortable and somewhat bemoaning the forthcoming meal. Most concerning: we had three people with dietary constraints: 1 vegan, 1 allergic to acids & vinegar, 1 fish eating but otherwise vegetarian. And this is a heavy on the meat (especially bacon even on the vegetables) kind of place.\n\nFood comes out in fits and starts, and floods the table in random places. In spite of the harriedness of everything, everyone seemed to have plenty of food. In fact, we ended up with way too much food and had two large to-go bags for a couple of guests. The bad thing about this way of serving (especially with a large group) is that it's hard to ensure people get enough of the dish they really wanted, and truly tricky for those with dietary limitations. The other challenge was the lack of pacing: we went from 0 to 100 in terms of waiting for food for a (sigh) while, and then it felt like a contest to see how many plates the multiple waitstaff could bring and place in the course of 30 minutes. Ambiance it was not.\n\nOverall the food was not bad, and the wine list is fine (no hard alcohol), but the experience in general left me with no desire to return on a more intimate scale. Funny side note: our waiter told us over and over again how their \"process\" of random service from the kitchen is tried and true for 10 years, as if to convince himself it would all work out for us.\n\nThe best: we all had enough to eat. No blood was shed over the few veggie items ordered. Heat lamps were on for most of the experience, helping the \"rustic\" dining space (drafty, cramped, super loud) feel more comfortable. This was a company dinner, so also was happy that the tab was not on me.\n\nThe worst: waitstaff that consistently leaned over me multiple times to pour someones water, drafty room (I was lodged into the end of the table right by the wall), hard to hear conversation across the table, and food that didn't sate me enough to get over my discomfort.\n\nPricey for what it is, and not sure I would call this French cuisine, with the exception of the foie gras (which I of course don't eat as I'm the pesky fish eating vegetarian), and not really a place I would go across town to experience again.\n\nSlight update to this review (and coming very late on my part). That's why I'm increasing the star by one....\nAfter I posted this the manager reached out to me to personally apologize for the less than stellar experience, and wanted to see if there was any way to make it up to me/my party. Though this doesn't change the food, or serving process that makes large party entertaining less than ideal - it's clear that the intentions are good, and that they want their guests to enjoy their time here.", "author": "Margaret K."}

As you can probably guess, there were a few too many pieces of pears.\n\nA big fan of tuna tartare and this was a particularly good version.  I enjoyed the largely chopped, fresh tuna at the perfect temperature, cold, but not so ice cold with good heat and a nice avocado moose.\n\nThis was a well cooked piece of fish (Halibut), rich butter poach flavor, moist fish with crispy thin potato \"skin\" that was a good touch with mix of nice acid and sweet red pepper confit.\n\nThe duck was overcooked unfortunately.

We were escorted through the seemingly small restaurant out back to a large covered patio area.  The seats near the walls were quite breezy so we strategically placed the boys on the outskirts and sat comfortably under the heat lamp.\n\nOur server was quite friendly and really helped us figure out how to navigate the menu, we chose a lot of family style dishes and devoured most everything presented in front of us.\n\n*only glitch in the evening came when the d*bags at the table next to us decided they were too hot and turned off the only heat source to our table, we exchanged a few words but when you're a d*bag I guess you don't hear anything so after we turned the heat back on, they again turned it off.  It would have been nice if the restaurant took care of the situation instead of me having to say anything.\n\nAlso, their credit card system is super slow so it took forever for us to get our final bill.\n\nSo my rating is probably more a 3.5 stars since it ended on not such a good note.", "author": "Mabelle A."}

Since we were bringing our dog with us, we had to pick a restaurant that offers outdoor dining.  After searching on Yelp with so many great reviews, I picked ISA.\n\nThe food here is just AMAZING.  We started off with corn soup and grilled Calamari.  They were SO GOOD.  The corn soup is incredibly flavorful.  \n\nThen for the main entree, I had the potato wrapped sea bass.  Boy!  I have never had such a delicious dish.  I thought those crispy part that wrapped the sea bass were bacons.  It was so crispy and yummy.  They are actually potatoes.\nMy husband had the pan roasted range chicken, they were really good.  But I like my seabass better.  :)  We had our dish \"family style', meaning we shared everything we ordered.\n\nSince the portion were big, after soup , appetizer and main dishes, we didn't have room for desserts.  Maybe next time, we will skip the  appetizer, and try out their desserts.\n\nThe service is EXCELLENT.  The staff was so attentive.  Definitely will come back.\n\nPS.

We had reservations for 6:30 and it was starting to get packed. We were led right to our seats in the back. It was very cozy though slightly packed to fit five people in a small table.\n\nWith the Dine About Town menu there is a free glass of red or white wine, always a plus. And I loved the fact that their Dine About Town menu isn't so restrictive to only a few items. The servers were very attentive and answered any questions we had throughly. There was even one server who recognized my dad from when he was head chef at another restaurant over 10 years ago. \n\nTheir bread is pretty good and great for dipping in the sauces of the mussels.\n\nFor the appetizers since we had five people, we ordered the raw oysters, the dungeness crab salad, and three plates of mussels. We should have listened to other yelpers..It was a LOT of mussels. We loved the sauce in the mussels and also dipped the bread in the sauce. I am not really a fan of raw oysters but even I had to admit that the oysters were good. I also liked the dungeness crab salad, though my parents did not. I liked the hint of apple flavor in the salad. I only wish there was more dungeness crab in the salad instead of those tiny bits. \n\nWe also got a salad, two steaks, the salmon, and the scallops. I liked the rich flavor of the fruits in the salad. The salmon was a little salty for me, but very flavorful and was most definitely not dry. The scallops they had were pretty large in size and they did not skim on the amount given to us. My all time favorite was the steak. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we got the sorbet and the creme brulee. The sorbet was tart with just enogh sweetness. The creme brulee was not bad.\n\nI would love to return some time and try out other things from their menu. Be warned, parking is most definitely not easy around here.", "author": "Jay L."}

The restaurant came highly recommended from several friends so I figured I'd give it a shot. The food itself was very good (the duck was great, Dungeness crab salad was refreshing, and the few desserts we had were all spectacular). The service and atmosphere, however, were terrible. The wait staff was rude and short with us. I was embarrassed to bring my extremely classy and proper parents to a restaurant that would disrespect my father. For example, they asked to take our coats when we sat (nice touch) but when we requested our coats at the end of the meal we were dismissively told to \"get them ourselves\" from a coat rack by the door. The food is supposedly served in such a manner that facilitates group dining, but I think that is more of an excuse to allow them the freedom to bring whatever is ready when it's ready rather than coordinating your meals. Three of our meals were served at the same time and were completely finished before the fourth even arrived. We had to ask more than once for the last meal in our party to be delivered and they kept assuring us it was on it's way. Talk about awkward for the person trying to quickly eat an overpriced slice of duck while everyone else at the table is already finished! After we were done, the waiter came by every minute or two to see if we had paid the bill. After making us wait for so long for a meal they couldn't wait to get us out quicker! He actually picked up the tab more than once to see if a credit card had been slipped in. This was the action that really rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the food, the dining experience as a whole was extremely unenjoyable. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing or classier evening. For the price and quality of the food I think there are much better choices that can provide a more enjoyable experience.", "author": "Victoria W."}

Blackberries, soju and something else I can't remember.  It was pretty good, but the blackberry pulp made it really hard to drink it out of a straw.  I also had the mojito which was pretty good.\n\nAs we were waiting for the rest of our party and trying to decide what we wanted to get, my sister-in-law asked one of the waiters if he recommended to chicken or the duck.\n\nThe waiter gave us this long winded explanation which came off way to strong.  I was already turned off of this place after he started talking.  I felt he was basically talking down upon us that we didn't know how to eat French food.  He said \"I can't tell you because you need to tell me what you are eating throughout the dinner, its not a simple question\"\n\nHe went on for another 5 minutes basically talking about how developed his pallet is and how you need to build the meal upon itself.  He then ended it with \"I actually wouldn't get the duck or the chicken at all\"\n\nAll we asked was a simple question, chicken or duck, not your life story dude.\n\nAfter his long winded explanation, another waiter came by and almost did the same exact thing but was a lot nicer about it.  He listed to what we were thinking of getting and then he made his suggestions, but said there are no wrong choices.\n\nWe started with the arugula salad.  Was pretty standard, didn't wow me too much.\n\nFoie Gras - very excellent, very tender and moist and just melted in your mouth.  The piece was huge also.\n\nGoat Cheese - was a standard sizzling, melted goat cheese, although too strong for my taste\n\nSeabass - Was a very excellent seabass.  It had a nice crispiness on the outside and juicy tenderness on the inside.  No huge fishy flavor either.\n\nDuck Breast - Was the best dish in my opinion.  The duck was juicy and  cooked rare just how I like it.  It also came with a side arugula salad with beets which was very good.\n\nChicken - Chicken was super tender and moist inside, with a slightly delicate but crisp skin.\n\nOverall the meal was good.

The bread is actually from Bakers of Paris, which I Google-d upon arriving home to see if there was any way that I can get my hands on a supply without driving all the way to SF. Not really, but at least they do sell to the public at SF Farmers Market.\n\nThe food here was really excellent, mainly because of the freshness of the ingredients - all the vegetables served tasted as if nothing was picked more than a day before serving. The freshness GREATLY contributed to the quality of the food here. \n\nSeared scallops - cooked perfectly. Only minor complain here is that there were some minor grit still on them. Corn was cut fresh off the cob, fava beans were fresh off their pods, cherry tomatoes were sweet. Truffle sauce made a nice touch pulling everything together.\n\nPan roasted chicken - my friend swears by this and it is indeed awesome. It's perfected roasted and sized perfectly too. Love the tasty herbs (I tasted thyme)hiding behind the crispy skin of the chicken.\n\nWild prawns - this is crazy good - was my favorite dish. The prawns weren't repeatedly frozen - they were really fresh and the parsley, garlic and lemon saute sauce was just amazing. \n\nFlat iron steak - could not give this a fair review because we ordered a lot of food just for two and this came as the last dish.

Very innovative to have an outside shelter making it as if your inside or vice versa.\n\nThe menu had so many things to choose from that picking just one seemed bias.

Yes, the Dine About Town has more options, and Yes, they offer a free glass of wine (a red of their choosing) with the Dine About Town menu - however somehow I felt slightly jipped (buyer beware: Flora in Oakland is also pulling this same trick for Oakland's restaurant week).\n\nMoving on to the important stuff, though...\n\nF O O D\n- The butter lettuce salad (blue cheese, pears, walnuts) was a solid salad. Flavors held well together, sizeable portion.\n- I heard the crab salad with grapefruit was fantastic as well.\n- I ordered the scallops with mashed potatoes, bacon, and brussel sprouts in truffle sauce. With ingredients like that - how could expectations NOT be sky-high? Unfortunately, it fell a little flat. Brussel sprouts at firefly are much better. Scallops seemed to be in that weird spot between seared and cooked which, at least for me, was not a happy medium.\n- I heard the duck was great - except that it came a little on the rare side (even when asked to be cooked medium).\n- We both thoroughly enjoyed the semifreddo all'amaretto for dessert. It's a large portion, and is extremely well done (perhaps I'm just a sucker for semifreddo, though).\n\nS E R V I C E\nFantastic. Really.

Delicious sliced french bread with softened butter and a sprinkle of salt on top.  I think I filled up too much on the bread... but it was so good it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe nice thing about Isa's menu was its extensive DAT menu.  At a lot of other places, you only get 1- maybe 2 options to choose from, but at Isa, each course had at least 5-6 options.  Obviously, to maximize my dining pleasure, the boy and I ordered different things, so we can get a better sense of what the restaurant has to offer.\n\nFirst Course: ORGANIC SALMON CARPACCIO & STEAMED MUSSELS (salmon was sliced a little too thick for us, but otherwise, the appetizers were portioned and seasoned deliciously)\n\nSecond Course: GRILLED FLAT IRON STEAK & DUCK BREAST W/ BACON (mmmmmmm nom nom nom nom. need i say more?)\n\nThird Course: GRAPEFRUIT GRANITE & CREME BRULEE (the creme brulee was the. best. ever. i could have gone without the grapefruit granite, but boyfriend liked his very much)\n\nService was fabulous.

They explained it was cartilage that must not have been removed when the calamari was cleaned.   Okay, that's better than plastic, but still not something to expect when dining out.\n\nOur next dish (paella) also included calamari and once again more cartilage was found.  At this point we were all disgusted and had no desire to eat anything further.  Our waiter was not the least bit apologetic, nor was the female manager that walked by.  \n\nI have been eating calamari in restaurants for decades and never had this happen, least of all twice in one meal.\n\nIf you go to Isa, just stay away from the calamari and don't expect service that accompanies their prices.", "author": "Amanda S."}

Based on previous reviews we chose Isa, and we were not disappointed. The menu recommended that couples share two appetizers and two entrees.\nEvery dish was fabulous; however it was too much food for the two of us. We were way overstuffed, but loved every minute of it. We had the salmon carpaccio, the mussels, the seafood of the day (which was halibut) and the sea bass. Everything was incredibly tasty!\n As far as the restaurant experience, you are really close to your neighbor, and things are a little noisy, but it was still a great experience and I will look forward to my next trip to SF to re-experience Isa.", "author": "Jacquie L."}

I was SO impressed with my experience.  Each member of the staff was so attentive, from the hostess to the busser to the server.  We came at 6:30 PM and they host a happy hour special until 7PM with very good wines for a discounted price.  Our awesome server gave us the happy hour prices well passed 7PM.  The DAT menu is served tapas style and my boyfriend and I shared the following dishes:\n\nMaine lobster broth with prawns -- the prawns were very big and the broth is similar to a cioppino.  We both got this but I wish I had tried the potato leek.  \n\nDungeness crab salad--very good.  So many details in the dish, from the fat pieces of crab to the grapefruit and tarragon.  There were so many flavors.\n\nSteamed Prince edward island mussels--EXCELLENT.  The mussels were huge and I wanted to drink the broth in a bowl.  This is one of the best mussel dishes I have had.  We soaked up every last drop with the warm grilled bread, then went for more with the complimentary breads.\n\nSeared Scallops: four large scallops surrounding mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, bacon...and TRUFFLE.  Amazing.  \n\nTruffle Risotto:  Thank you ISA for not skimping at all on the truffle.  This dish was not too heavy for a risotto and full of flavor.  The array of mushrooms was very generous as well.\n\nVanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e:  At first bite I liked it but didn't love it, but as you continue eating you can taste the real vanilla bean.  It's not too sweet and a very good dessert after a large meal.\n\nBuche Au Lait De Ch\u00e8vre:  The goat cheese with honey and walnuts is served with toasted crostini.  Excellent.\n\nThe meal was so unbelievable, especially for a DAT menu.  We had the priviledge of meeting the owner, a very sweet lady who told us that ISA spends their entire marketing budget on DAT week hoping to generate repeat customers.  They definitely won us over.", "author": "Samantha K."}

Water glass was never empty and they made sure we had everything we needed. Normally, I don't care about service, but this was remarkably good.\n\nHad the Truffle Spaghetti, Chicken, Flat Iron Steak, Two Salads and lots of cheese. Truffle Spaghetti is amazingly flavored but the noodles are a little soft and the presentation lacking. It's like they combined amazing truffles with Chef Boyardee noodles and still managed to make a good dish. Chicken had amazing crisp skin, with moist flesh, very nicely smooth textured mashed potatoes, and crisp green beans. Flat Iron Steak was the most boring dish, yet perfectly cooked, a little bloody in the middle and dolloped with butter. Salads were well dressed and included fresh fruit, but the lettuce salad was a little light on lettuce.\n\nAnd man, that almond semi-freddo tasted amazing, though I'm a sucker for almonds and the almond macaroons were a bit too crunchy.\n\nPrix fix menu had almost all of the normal main courses, which was nice. $30 for appetizer, main and dessert.\n\nOnly gets 4 stars, cause 5 is reserved for places that are little different or extra memorable.", "author": "Alexander J."}

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1). Food- we ordered calamari, dungeness crab salad, tuna poke for appetizers; truffle risotto, scallops, duck breast, fish of the day, and steak for mains. Highlights were by far the truffle risotto (mouthfuls of creamy heavenly goodness.. although it's very rich so I'm glad we shared!), scallops (literally melts in your mouth, with just the right amount of searing), and the dungeness crab salad.  For dessert we had flourless chocolate cake (super yummy).\n\n2). Service- delightful! The waiters were super attentive and refilled all of our bread baskets without us having to ask (and we ate a lot of bread).  One waiter got me a glass of champagne on the house for \"my longevity and wellbeing\" :) so sweet.\n\n3). Atmosphere- I had never been here before, so I was nervous about eating here for my birthday dinner, but it was exactly the kind of place I was looking for. There were adorable christmas lights strung across the walls in a cute/classy and not cheap/gaudy kind of way.  There were enough heat lamps to keep us warm enough, and the servers were kind enough to keep changing the heat lamp settings as the night progressed.\n\nOverall will definitely bookmark this place to come back sometime.\n\nTips: Definitely designed for smaller groups or for romantic dates, so plan accordingly. Also, the menu recommends 2 dishes per person, but for a group of 6, we found that 3 appetizers and 5 entrees were more than enough.  We were happily stuffed by the end of dinner.", "author": "Rachel L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "Marina yuppies beware: there is a pretender in your midst.  The girlfriend speculated that there was a change in management/ownership, as she's reviewed this place at 4 stars before (covering up for her error?  I'll let you decide...), but neither of us left happy last night.\n\nIt's not a terrible restaurant, but Yelp says two stars means \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that's a pretty accurate way to describe my sentiment.\n\nFor a place marked on Yelp as being \"romantic, classy\", I wasn't feeling either of those vibes.  We were first sat out on the back patio (covered, heated on a cold and wet SF night, to their credit), but it was insanely loud. Like every table yelling loud. Which made us have to yell to talk to each other.  Which just contributed to the loud. Not cool.\n\nSo we asked to be reseated inside, which happened quickly (again to their credit). From there on out, service was fine. Not great, not bad, just fine... if a bit on the casual side for a place marketing itself as romantic and classy.\n\nOn to the food:\nOysters - fresh, a bit meatier than optimal, but very good.  Mignonette was fine, and we both enjoyed this. It's oysters, so take from that what you will, but Isa gets credit for at least sourcing good product here.\n\nGrilled calamari - smelled the honey spice when it landed on the table, but the taste was not really present.  Flagolet beans a bit overdone, arugula thrown in there more for fun and visual contrast than anything else.  Overall, just not remarkable.\n\nLobster broth - ok, I get it.  It's a broth, not a bisque, and I should expect as much. The server wasn't kidding when he said \"it's a very intense lobster taste\" as he set it down... he could have just said, \"it's like being slapped in the face with a lobster.\" Dipping some buttered bread in it was my preferred manner of consumption, as it made it a bit more mild.  The girlfriend just gave up... and I didn't even bother to eat hers as I normally would.  Edible?  Yes... Good? Ehhh... if you're THAT into lobster flavor, maybe.  Not for us though.\n\nMussels - again, ok, but not knocking my socks off.  Aaaand that's all I have to say about them. Meh.\n\nBrussel Sprouts with Garlic, Bacon and EVOO - Not enough garlic, bacon was unremarkable in quality, and not enough olive oil.  Sprouts came out very undercooked and still bitter. Sent them back to roast again. Came back a bit better, but a little charred as there hadn't been any more EVOO added to the mix and they clearly had it under some high heat trying to rush it back to us. Sprinkled with a little salt, one could now eat it... but we ended up just picking the bacon out as snacks as we waited for the risotto to come out.\n\nMushroom Risotto with Truffle Oil - By far the best dish, but if this meal was a relay race, then the other dishes had left the risotto with a bunch of ground to make up as the anchor. Solidly put together, but also pretty straightforward and didn't surprise.\n\nWine - Eric Louis Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc - Good, $46 for the bottle which looks like the standard 2.5x retail.  No complaints there.\n\nWaiter comp'ed us the brussel sprouts when he saw that we barely touched them, and was friendly enough.\n\nAll in all, if I was was walking in to a random mid-range restaurant in a smaller city, my rating would go up. But for dining in SF, and with a Marina price tag, I don't see myself showing up again.", "author": "Kai Y."}

We made reservations for their prix fixe New Year's Eve menu for 10:30 pm, figuring that we'd be there through the countdown to midnight.\n\nWe arrived and were ushered out to the cover back patio. It was fine for a casual dinner, but a let down for NYE. There was no ambiance and it was a little dirty - the previous diner's used napkin was still on the floor by my seat. As a small insult to injury, I was also placed right below a spotlight which was uncomfortable. I will say, I think if we'd asked to be moved, we could have been.\n\nWe then waited for some time for the waiter to come for drink orders. In the meantime bread and butter were slammed onto our table by a bus boy who was literally running by at the moment. I mention this only because it proceeded to happen again when they refilled the basket. When the waiter finally came, he brought complimentary glasses of sparkling wine (nice, but part of the menu, so not special treatment), and made no offer of other drinks - you had your champagne and you liked it.\n\nWe ordered dinner around 10:45 or so and within 5 minutes both our first and second courses were out and the waiters were cramming them on the table. When the second course came about about 1 minute after the first, I said that I preferred that they slow down service a bit - we'd booked 1.5 hours for dinner and I suddenly felt like they were rushing us out before midnight. I was told, \"the kitchen closes in 10 minutes, so we've got to get the food out.\" He sent the hostess to speak with us and she was very gracious, but ineffective, because sure enough 10 minutes later my entree was being served. I swear I am not this person usually, but I sent it back. I asked for it to be served when 1) my husband's entree was also ready (they never once served both of us at the same time for any course), and 2) for when the previous courses plates were cleared. He did as I asked, but when it was re-served later, it was ice cold. Clearly just sitting in the kitchen, not even under a heat lamp.\n\nWe did the countdown and the crowd was fun! And we waited and waited and waited for dessert. The whole thing was a hot mess. And frankly, the food was passable at best. I will not be going back.\n\nI am open to the idea that Isa is a better place to go when it's not such a busy night for them, but it was an epic fail, so I for me that will be my last experience there.", "author": "Courtney S."}

I wanted to dress up for hte occasion, but my friend had informed me that it's really not that fancy.  The inside is more upscale than the patio area.  I dressed up anyway just because I wanted to =P.\n\nWhen we came into the restaurant, the hostess brought us out to the patio, and we sat down in a corner.  Two minutes later, she seats another couple next to us, and mind you the restaurant was not packed AT ALL, esp the patio area.  I was slightly annoyed at this, and requested to be moved inside since it was also chilly in the back patio.  They were fine with moving us inside.\n\nOnce insde, it was a little darker, a little more loud, but definitely had a nicer ambience inside.  With Isa, they claim that their dishes are for sharing like tapa style.  Being that it was our first time here, we ordered 4 dishes that we thought were good enough for sharing.  They bring the dishes out one by one, they say it's so that your taste buds don't get overwhelmed by certain dishes and they order the way the dishes come out accordingly.  But in reality, I think it's because the table just doesn't have enough room.  In reality, the larger dishes can be a regular entree.  That's what the regulars do.  \n\nThe food was pretty good, but just pricey.  We ordered the foie gras, which you could definitely taste the fat!  it was really tasty and came with this type of bread with it.  We also got the salmon tartare, which came with toasted bread crisps.  For the larger entrees, we got the special, which was some kind of fish ( I forgot) with corn, asparagus, and some other sauce.  That was REALLY GOOD.  i would highly recommend getting their specials.  We also got their duck, which was ok... it came with some bacon bits, which I'm not a big fan of.  The duck was cooked perfectly, medium rare.  it was the perfect tenderness and pink.  Although, it kind of tasted like ham to me...\n\nOur waiter was also great.  He was so enthusiastic and gave good descriptions on the specials.  The other assistants were also very attentive, and came by frequently to make sure everything was ok with the water and bread supply.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant has great food, but just tends to be on the pricey side.  The entire dinner cost about $90 for two people, with 2 glasses of wine from the happy hour special ($5/glass).

I'm not an expert on Sole (actually - first time I've had it) but it was very good. I do have steak with some frequency and the one I had at Isa was fantastic. It wasn't a very large portion but it was incredibly tasty.\n\nFor desert I had the Vanilla bean gelato with biscotti and Vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e. The gelato was ok and the creme brulee was very good. \n\nI am definitely going back if I crave a moderately priced meal of excellent quality. \n\nTab for party of 2 + wine and drink was $80 which I think is very reasonable. \n\nYou should definitely take advantage of the patio!\n\nThanks, Isa!", "author": "Carlos A."}

It looked like there was more seating in the back, but we were seated in the main area. \n\nThe staff is extremely hospitable.  It seems to run like a true team with everyone helping at every table.  They were all extremely attentive, warm and friendly.  They made great conversation with us and made sure we were comfortable and happy.\n\nThe food isn't too shabby either.  The plates are smaller than typical American restaurants, but they are meant to be shared (family style) even though everyone orders their own dish.  Hopefully you go with people you like, haha!  The salmon carpaccio was unique and tasty.  Due to an allergy, I couldn't try the crab salad.  My fellow table members said it wasn't bad.  The goat cheese was truly a surprise as a dish, but we loved it.   Mushroom risotto was sooooooo good!  The scallops were accompanied by mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.

If this is my last dalliance with the delicate fatty liver in SF, I've pulled a George Costanza by \"leaving on a high note\".\n\nMany more highlights here - a thick salmon carpaccio that bore a closer resemblance to generous pieces of salmon sashimi, sublime truffle risotto, and large, delicious desserts.\n\nOur two year old was equally impressed with his spaghetti entree, gobbling it up eagerly.

Our waiter told us that the restaurant uses \"the family style\" approach, which means dishes are shared; so, everyone can enjoy all the foods. Great statement if there was enough food to share. The portions were minute. Shrimps were good but it was just five of them on the plate, which means everyone got just one shrimp, the same was with all the dishes. The result after ordering five different dishes a bottle of wine and  the desert  was unsatisfactory. All five of us left hungry.

But when I came here for an Easter dinner last Sunday, the pressure was on from my boyfriend's seafood-loving family. I closed my eyes, took the oyster shot, and chewed. \n\nIt was incredible. It tasted like the ocean in the best way. They served the oysters with a delicious spicy citrus sauce that reminded me a lot of Thai ingredients. And I'm a huge citrus freak, so everything was just perfect on that front.\n\nI tried the mussels next, which are also great as long as you don't look at them. They were served up in a delicious garlic-tomato broth, and they tasted surprisingly like chicken.\n\nI have to mention the wine, because it totally made the meal. The parents picked out a cuvee from Chateu du Chatelard. It also says Beaujolais Villages on the bottle, so if you're looking through the wine list and you see any of those words, go with that. It was a nice, rich red that sat well with the food without being overpowered by any of the intense flavors, like the truffle risotto I'm about to rave about.\n\nGoddddd. Only get this if you're a huge mushroom fan and love a rich risotto. They throw just about every type of edible fungi into this dish, and I'm not complaining. The flavor is so full and decadent, just as it should be. \n\nTo top it off, our server was a sweetheart and took great care of us.

I HAD to go to Isa. I'd never been, but Isa had the appeal of having 5-6 options per course (all of which sounded AMAZING) so I was immediately sold. This meant settling for a 9:45pm reservation, so I walked into Isa starving and ready to chow down.\n\nUpon arrival, the place was packed! A good sign, I guess, but remember it's 9:45 and was ready to die of hunger. I was a little miffed, but we were promptly seated after 5 minutes or so. Our waiter was soo cute. He was this cute little old mad with the heaviest accent ever. He started speaking and literally the only words I could understand were \"share\" and \"have fun\" which in my mind didn't really equate to having a \"fun\" time, but I nodded my head and convinced him I was enthused. \n\nFor the first course, I had Salmon Carpaccio and my friend had the Steamed Mussels. Each dish came out individually, which really did mean we were going to share everything--a nice twist which meant I got to try everything AND this 3 course meal turned into a 6 course one. The Salmon Carpaccio was delicious. Nicely seasoned and incredibly fresh and melt in your mouth tender. I didn't think the mussels would top it, but they were seriously the best mussels I have ever eaten. Hands down. Period. Perfectly PERFECTLY cooked and they were soft and plump and flavorful--so much so that they really tasted like oysters. I had died and gone to food heaven. \n\nFor the second course, I had the Seared Scallops with Brussels Sprouts and Bacon in Truffle Sauce and my friend had the Duck with a side of Spinach in a Balsamic sauce with Potato Roti. Both were absolutely amazing. The scallops were seared perfectly, the potatoes sweet and smooth and garlicky, and the brussels sprouts were tender and only slightly bitter. The duck was a perfect medium rare and superr tender. \n\nOur choices for dessert, Creme Brulee and the Amaretto Semifreddo, were the perfect caps to our meal. The Creme Brulee had a nice, thick sugar crust and the perfect creamy filling and the Semifreddo was like a soft icecream with cake mixed into it. \n\nThe wines we tried were fantastic! I had the Riesling and my friend had the Chardonnay. Totally girly, but both were sweet and not too dry. \n\nI would definitely return to Isa, any day, any time. And the Dine About Town menu makes this meal a great deal at $34.95! The only thing is, I wish we had come on Sun-Thurs so we could have gotten FREE glasses of wine, but for a fabulous meal, I really didn't mind spending $8 on a great glass. Even though parking is rough, I can't deduct any stars for this outstanding place because my experience here was absolutely phenomenal.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

My husband and I had heard good things and were invited to dinner by another couple who had a 30% off coupon through Village Vines.  \n\nThe waiter was obnoxiously over-describing everything on the menu without actually having an opinion or making a strong case for anything in particular.  Interrupting us every few minutes to annoy us with more useless info, he cleared our plates then disappeared for over an hour before offering dessert or the bill.  \n\nWhen we finally got the bill, the 30% discount hadn't been applied and when we questioned it, a manager came out.  She explained that we had been 15 minutes late for our reservation and even though we called to say we were running 15 minutes late (which is polite) she could no longer honor the coupon.  On a $250 bill--with wine we probably wouldn't have ordered if we didn't have the coupon--this was pretty frustrating.  \n\nHad we known when we called about running late that 15 minutes would cost $75, we would never have eaten at this overpriced, mediocre spot.

Not cool, if i only want to savor my dish and don't really care for what others at the table have ordered....\n\nBut anyways, I ordered the calamari appetizer, which smelled amazing and the flavors worked well together.  The salmon carpaccio served with crostini was good, but nothing special.  The arugula salad with fennel was very bitter and boring - it needed something sweet to complement the flavors, such as orange.  The yellowfin tuna was very good, just the right amount of spicy kick and creamy avocado to balance.  \n\nEntrees:  Due to the family style nature of the place, I ended up tasting the truffle risotto, lobster bouillabaisse, sole, and duck breast with spinach and bacon.  Of course I ordered the duck and regretted that I could not selfishly enjoy the entire dish by myself, since it was AMAZING.  The skin was perfectly crisp, providing that delicious juxtaposition of textures expected in a duck confit.  The sole and risotto were both good too, but not as memorable as the duck, and the bouillabaisse was not as fragrant as I would have liked so I would not recommend that dish. \n\nAs far as desserts go, I wish they had more sweet options.  I got the semifreddo and though it was infused with almond flavor, the ice cream was a bit icier than I would prefer.

I inhaled everything on the table, and there was a LOT on the table.\n\nI prefer to try new restaurants as often as possible, to get a little taste of the whole city.  But I don't think I can stay away from Isa for long.", "author": "Mallory M."}

The environment was intimate and perfect for our event (small, lights dimmed) , except the large group of 13 next to us was kind of loud. The waiter was really knowledgable of the menu according to my husband, because I didn't hear half of what he said due the large group. I ordered lamb rack with extra rack(well done) & my husband ordered Flat iron steak(medium) and local calamari, grapefruit granite. When the calamari came out, I was kind of disappointed since I was expecting fried. Then entrees came out, they don't look like the pictures I saw on Yelp which disappointed my husband most. The steak was ok according to my husband and he is big fan of steak and had high hopes due to the pics I showed him before. My lamb rack was looking good, but it came out more raw than the steak( medium) and I ordered well done since I am not supposed to eat undercooked due to pregnancy. I was so disappointed in the food by this point( appetizer, entrees were beyond lower than our expectation) the taste of lamb, I couldn't eat it due to its seasoning ( my husband ate one rack, I barely had one, & I asked them to pack since both of us couldn't eat the lamb anymore. I was already down with the food taste and how they couldn't get my order right. The only things I will say that I liked are the bread and butter ( since I couldn't eat the food, I had like 3 baskets of it) & grapefruit granite (for my husband, it was sour, but I am big fan of sour things and I liked it) so the environment, bread/butter, dessert and waiter barely gets this place 3 stars in my book. But the food presentation and taste definitely takes off 2 stars and I will come back here just for the bread/butter and dessert if there is no other place to eat or I am not that hungry to begin with. Otherwise, it is not worth the hour drive on one way and expensive price for the food. (In case some say of course lamb not many people can eat it, but guess what I am Mongolian and grew up eating it in many ways but this lamb cooked wrong and taste not good) btw, my husband is not Mongolian and he didn't like it also, we ended up throwing away the rest at home.", "author": "Nancy K."}

We tried this place last Saturday for Dine About Town during dinner. For our friends and ourselves, this was our first time there. We also brought our toddler along with us.\n\nThe main restaurant is small but they have an outer area under a tent. The decorations reminded one of my friends as if we were on a ship. Considering it was cold that day, we barely felt anything but a few drafts here and there. It was pretty busy and it was a bit hard to hear everyone. The service was attentive, checking on us and refilling water.\n\nEveryone had either similar or different dishes. For the first course, I got the arugula salad and my husband got the dugeness crab salad. The arugula salad was okay. I think my least favorite out of the three dishes. One of my friends got the steamed Prince Edward island mussels and that was great. \n\nFor the second course, a few people got the truffle risotto and that was a good choice. I got the pan roasted rockey jr. range chicken and my husband got the steak. I mainly got the chicken because of my toddler and it was pretty good. \n\nFor dessert, I got the vanilla bean creme brulee and my husband got the semifreddo all' amaretto. Everything but the arugula sald was great. My friend who organized the Dine About outing did a great job. \n\nParking there isn't all that great. There is a meter parking garage on Pierce St, which is where my husband and I parked. You're lucky to find any parking in the surrounding area. Our other friends parked in a different parking garage but I'm not sure where that was. On the website, you can reserve parking.", "author": "Jenn D."}

The reason I'm writing this review is because it took the waiter about half an hour to describe each dish (not our request).  This became very annoying after the first few dishes.  I kept saying to myself, \"I can read the menu,  just let me order\". It was like wanting to buy a car and the salesmen starts reading the owners manual to you.  I felt that was pretensous, annoying and very tiresome.  I would much rather they tell me what they are known for, and if there is something new on the menu.  Not read the menu to me.

This really was the epitome of a fantastic dining experience..\n\nService: We are talking about a well-oiled machine..they have everything down pat. From getting seated to paying our bill, everyone was courteous and efficient. Even the reminder call I received was polite and personable.\n\nFood: Dine About Town menu was phenomenal..\n-Salmon Carpaccio: the fish was so fresh and not over powered by the capers. Sprinkle on egg and light drizzle of a citrus-testing sauce on top. The freshness of the salmon battles the fresh fish I've had in Hawaii..and writing about this dish makes me salivate! \n-Dungeness crab salad: overall not my favorite dish. The grapefruit in this salad was way to bitter and it overpowered everything else ok the plate.\n-Flat Iron Steak done medium: don't you hate it when restaurants say it comes with potatoes and it is just one tiny piece?? Well prepare to be wowed! This dish was fantastic...perfectly cooked, the meat was moist and tender, the string beans  weren't soggy, and the potatoes..oh the potatoes!! Crispy on the outside and big hearty  bites..yummmyy!\n-Duck breast: The texture in this was completely different from the beef, really moist, and soft. I looked the salad it came with. The medium was already pretty red for me, but they suggested medium rare for the duck. Try it is you don't mind the blood as much.\n-Vanilla Creme Brulee: was like vanilla pudding..not too sweet, perfectly creamy.\n-Grapefruit granite: This was really interesting. I've never had grapefruit shaved ice before! Don't eat this after the creme brulee!! It is really bitter if you do..\n\nThe BREAD here is so good!!\n\nOverall, this was an amazing dining experience.

I wish it came with a few more crostinis since there were so many pieces of salmon. \n\nBaked Goat Cheese-a must-have! So rich, warm and melt in your mouth good. The pesto, pine nuts and tomatoes compliment the goat cheese perfectly.

Still, great quality and value. They have these three course prix fixe menus that are a bang for you buck. The cuisine is French/Caifornian, yet leans toward more on the Californian side. The food quality tastes like it's like it's right out of your gourmet friend's kitchen, meaning that this is close to home comfort food. I have no complaints with any of the dishes. The sweet breads and scallops are both great. The only problem I have with Isa is that it feels a little cramp. We had a table of five yet we were seated at a somewhat small table in the corner.

From the street, it looks fairly small (some would call it \"cozy\").  But there's a patio area that's tented and heated, giving several options for larger groups.\n\nWhen organizing a large group dinner, I tend to expect certain sacrifices in the quality of food and service.  But Isa came through like a champion.  Our tables were ready on time, food came out at a good pace, everything was prepared expertly, and we never felt rushed.\n\nEven before we had arrived, I was impressed with how the management took the time to understand our needs in planning the menu.  While it's not unusual for a restaurant to be aware of food allergies and vegetarian preferences, I appreciated how much thought went into creating a menu that would satisfy everyone's preferences.\n\nPROS\n- Handled a party of 20 people with aplomb.  Service was good, food was excellent, and everyone enjoyed themselves\n- Very flexible with menu planning - between the vegans, the pescatarians, and the food allergies, we had a number of requirements\n- The goat cheese with pesto was by far my favorite dish (and I'm lactose intolerant).\n\nCONS\n- Not that it's really a con, there was TOO MUCH food!\n- No full bar - only beer and wine\n- The patio can get a little loud, depending on the crowd\n\nTIPS\n- There's a parking garage one block away on Pierce Street.

Next comes the potato wrapped sea bass, which is my favorite dish here. The fish is so tender and cooked to perfection, while the potato wrapping adds a nice heavy crisp to the dish.

Like all the reviews say, the food is well prepared, fresh and a true gem of haute French cuisine.\n\nDAT (4/5):  We ordered the dungeness crab salad (delicious chunks of crab meat; we also tried the scallops and it was so tasty and crispy from the pan), flat iron steak and Semifreddo all' amaretto. Definitely order the flat iron steak medium rare because it'll melt in your mouth. The moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce was so good that my friend sopped it up with her bread. YUM. For DAT, this restaurant is a good place to go.\n\nSERVICE (1/5)\nNow on to the review for one of the busiest times at Isa-- DAT week.  Perhaps it was an off day, but my DAT service experience at Isa wasn't very good and well below the standards of any successful, conscientious business establishment in the Bay Area.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the flat iron steak as our main course. The downside about this review is that because the restaurant was so busy during DAT, the clean up of our table was terrible.  Imagine tossing our silverware onto our plates and then SPLASHING steaks of red wine sauce all over my DRESS and my bf's DRESS SHIRT. Now that's really disappointing and totally unnecessary. In the wait staff's haste, they were negligent and careless, causing us an inconvenient trip to the dry cleaners and an uneasy feeling during the dinner.\n\nTo top it off, the waiter dropped glassware underneath on the floor next to our table and shards of glass scattered all over the floor, directly underneath our feet and onto my legs and my bf's dress pants and shoes. Sure, mistakes happen. But when you don't come back to clean up the mess after 10 minutes, then it's shame on you. Leaving broken glass underneath our feet made for a very uncomfortable and stressful dining experience. There was no apologies and even our neighbors shook their heads in disbelief (after pointing out the stains on my boyfriend's shirt in shock (yes, we have witnesses!)). \n\nIsa also ran out of its flourless chocolate cake, which is very unfortunate.  I'm a firm believer that successful restaurants should not run out of popular food items on a Saturday evening (one of the busiest days of the week for restaurants!). To top if off, I had asked our waiter beforehand if the flourless chocolate cakes would be available, as we were celebrating two of my friends' birthdays and I was sure that these cakes were going to be ordered. Our waiter said, \"Of course they will be available! This is Isa!  We will have everything on the menu.\" Imagine our great disappointment when the owner (Semera) said that they ran out. Very, very disappointing. \n\nI am certain that the details outlined in this review are \"outliers\" and below Isa's standards. However, I don't think it should have ever happened or there were mitigating factors (e.g., not being sloppy, quickly cleaning up broken glass underneath customer's feet, even saying \"sorry\" would have helped) that would have helped the evening be more pleasant. \n\nChef Luke Sung would be greatly disturbed and frustrated to learn that his culinary dishes have been compromised by poor service at Isa.", "author": "Sunny S."}

This restaurant was constantly busy for the time we were there, so I would recommend making reservations. The maine lobster broth and potato leek soup were mundane, I wasn't blown away. The $1/oyster was a good deal, but they're on the smaller side and there are bits of broken off shells in the oysters. The star of the evening was the scallops with brussel sprouts and bacon mashed potatoes. The scallops were amazing and the brussel sprouts were well-seasoned. I enjoyed the service here but felt a bit rushed due to DAT. This is a good date place and I'd come back.", "author": "Kristina N."}

The first time, I took my fiancee here for his birthday and we had the best service and excellent food! We went on a Friday night and it was very quiet inside and romantic.The second time we went was on a Saturday and it was extremely loud and noisy and croweded but the food was still awesome.\n\nRESTAURANT: The restaurant itself is beautifully lit with candles that bounce off the dark wood interior. Great ambiance-dark enough to set the mood but not too dark that you can't see what you are eating. The front room is packed with tales so you sit pretty close to everyone around you. They have both high top and low tables. THere is a back room as well but the time that I have gone we have alwasy been seated in the front room. They have a bar that is located right next to the kitchen so you can watch the chefs preparing the food.\n\nFOOD: I have had both their Chef pre-fix menu as well as just a single main course. The pre-fix menu was really an awesome deal and you had several selections to choose from. I couldn't decided between the  mussles and the halibut so we went with the pre fix menu so i could get both and my fiancee got the calamri and flat iron steak. The portions are still very good size but I love getting a variey of items. Their mussles are delcicuous. I have also had the potatoe crusted halibut which is amazing! I would highly reccomend  it. The crab salad with grape fruit seems to be a very popular dish as well. You get large chunks of jump lump crab meat along with grape fruit sections and argula. delicous.\n\nSERVICE: I thought out server was very nice from the start and was very attentive but not obtrusive. Our water was alwasy full, bread always replenished and since we ordered a bottle of wine, he always made sure our glasses were never empty\n\nOverall: Great food and service and I will defintley go back here again", "author": "Whitney S."}

Standout of the night goes to the Rocky jr Pan Roasted Chicken-- only a few dry bits (but it was white meat... so what can you expect) but overall very flavorful and tender. Best part of the dish was sopping up all the meat juice with crusty bread! MMM\n\nSlightly annoyed by the fact that the restaurant's \"suggestion\" of ordering family style is more of an edict which is enforced by the timing/execution of the dishes. If we hadn't ordered family style, people would definitely have gone hungry, as most of the things came out one at a time. That said, we didn't have nearly as long waits as some Yelpers have mentioned, which was nice (although sometimes hectic, when there were too many plates on our table).\n\nOVERALL: Doubtful that I'll be returning. The entire meal seemed overpriced (but can happen when you order family style at a resto that doesn't actually price things in a family style kind of way) and not really worth it to me.", "author": "Susanna W."}

She snagged a coveted 7 pm reservation - which was ideal since some of our guests were driving over 2 hours to meet us. We called the restaurant the day before to confirm the reservation and they clearly stated that we HAD to be there by 7 pm since they were very busy that night and would not hold the table if our party was late (they did not define \"late\") so we all busted our butts to be there promptly at 7 pm. When we arrived, we were told that our table would be ready shortly - they were setting up four two-tops in the cozy front of the restaurant, by the window with a street view. We watched them set it up. We waited. Then the unthinkable happened... a couple at the bar came up to the host (a friend???) and asked if they could sit up front instead of in the enclosed patio. The restaurant is tiny and I was standing no more than 3 feet away when the conversation took place. The little host tapped a few buttons on his screen (seriously, you would have thought he was flying the Starship Enterprise by all the industrious pecking he was performing). And much to my horror, he started dismantling the tables and seated the couple in the front... when I enquired why they were taking our table apart, the little host exclaimed that he thought we'd be \"happier in the back room.\" Another 20 minutes slide by and we were still standing in the tiny doorway, waiting, waiting, waiting... It reminded me of a doctor's appointment where they insist that you show up on time, but the doctor never sees you on time... a bit pretentious, to say the least. At 7:40, we were finally escorted to the back patio where we were crammed into a six-top with a seventh chair sticking out into the aisle. Not ideal, and certainly not the quaint/charming venue we were led to expect. And the food? Meh - at best. And I would NEVER characterize this restaurant as \"French\" - the only French thing about it was the snooty host. I had the braised short ribs. The flavor was dull and tires - and they were so fatty that I couldn't even get through a third of it. My wife had the fish (halibut?) and it was dry as a bone. Sigh. The rest of the party picked at their dinner with the only winner of the bunch my brother-in-law, who ordered the chicken. He seemed very happy with it. But then again, it was chicken. \nTo sum up - a mediocre meal with pretentious attitude equals an undeserved reputation. And with all of the amazing dining choices available in the city, we will not be visiting Isa any time soon on our coveted trips to San Francisco. Isa simply wasted one of our precious evenings in our favorite city.\nPS - we had a great dinner at Boulevard for 12 people the next night and it was a solid TEN.", "author": "Scott G."}

At Isa, they only provide the DAT menu during DAT and I appreciate that they focus on making DAT their priority so that the DAT food is on par with their normal offerings. I hate it when restaurants skimp because they feel like they're offering discounted fare, one of my major pet peeves while dining out. While Isa does serve French food, I felt like it was more like French food with a Chinese twist since a few of their dishes reminded me of traditional Chinese cuisine.\n\nTheir dishes are also served family/tapas style, so you get a taste of everything. \n\nBread and Butter. NOMS.\n\nDungeness Crab Salad with Avocado, Apple, Grapefruit and Tarragon. 1st course from prix fixe. This was pretty good, nice and fresh! I am definitely a fan! I liked the combination of the savory crab with sweet apple, creamy avocado and tangy grapefruit. Lots of textures and tastes in on one plate!\n\nSauteed Sea of Cortez Wild Prawns with Parsley, Garlic and Lemon. 1st course from prix fixe. I thought this was good, but not symbolic of traditional French cuisine. To me, it tasted more like a Chinese dish I'm familiar. It was still nommy though!\n\nLoch Duart Salmon Carpaccio with Lemon, Creme Fraiche, Cucumber, Egg, Capers and Crostini. 1st course from prix fixe. I love me some raw fish so I thought this was pretty bomb! The fish was also super fresh and tasty! NOMS!\n\nSeared Scallops with Butternut Squash, Sweet Potatoes, Spinach, Bacon and Truffle Sauce. 2nd course from prix fixe. This was pretty good, but it also reminded me of a Chinese dish. As a result, I found the scallops to be a bit overcooked and not really \"seared.\" Even though I'm not a huge fan of the squash and sweet potatoes I still found it delicious! \n\nGrilled Golden Gate Angus Flat Iron Steak with Zucchini, Polenta, Verte and Bordelaise Sauce. 2nd course from prix fixe. I found the steak to be rare on the inside, but a bit overcooked on the outside. So it was a weird chewy and soft, tender combination. I think I prefer my steak a bit less cooked on the outside as well. The polenta and the zucchini was really good! The polenta was nice and creamy, cooked to perfection! The sauce was also very delicious. \n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast with Huckleberry Sauce, Red Cabbage and Hashbrown. 2nd course from prix fixe. The duck breast was pretty bomb. I liked how it was a bit pink and it went really well with the sweet and tangy huckleberry sauce! I didn't really have any red cabbage because I'm not a fan of it. The hashbrown was pretty good! I definitely liked the sauce a lot and I had a lot of duck with it. NOMS.\n\nVanilla Bean Gelato with Biscotti. 3rd course from prix fixe. The gelato was pretty good, nice and creamy goodness! The biscotti was alright, but it might just be due to the fact that I'm not really a fan of biscotti. \n\nSemifreddo Al' Amaretto. 3rd course from prix fixe. I love me some good amaretto so I thought it was pretty good. NOMS. I'd definitely eat this again. It was nice and creamy deliciousness!

Not exaggerating, but I think there were just about a 1foot distance between each tables. Shoot, they should have just made our entire section a party of 12! \n\nAlso, I didn't like the fact that we were interrupted a couple of times by our neighbors, whom were just asking us about the dishes we ordered. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable to converse with my date. However, after a couple glasses of Merlot, I felt the annoyance subside and I was more accepting with the \"intimacy\" we shared with everyone else. \n\nNot that I've explained myself for the deduction of 2 stars, I will now praise them for their food. \n\nFor starters: \nOrganic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio- Raw (and bland) salmon drizzled over with a lemon cream sauce and topped with herbs, capers and cucumbers. This was our least favorite of all because the salmon didn't have the flavor that a great piece of raw salmon should have. \n\nYellowfin tuna- Their version of tuna tartare. Cubed tuna marinated with soy sauce and sriracha, topped with seaweed and sesame seeds over a bed of guacamole and greens. One of my favorite dishes of the night! \n\nFor entrees: \nHudson valley grade A foie gras- seared and paired with a huckleberry sauce and poached pears. Amazing! The foie gras was perfectly cooked and it melts divinely in the mouth. \n\nSeared scallops- served with butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, bacon & truffle sauce. Not the big fan of scallops but the flavors were astounding. \n\nI regret it now, but we opted out on dessert. We were too full. \n\nSo there we have it.

The food was very very good though.  Both apps were delicious, as were both entrees.  The desserts were acceptable ---- good but hardly memorable.\n\nThis is what we ate:\n\n-  Organic Loch Duart Salmon Carpaccio with lemon, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cucumber, egg, capers & crostini  (one of the best carpaccio I've ever eaten --- very well balanced and a very good portion\n\n-  Steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels with garlic, white wine, parsley & grilled bread (very good, huge portion --- could have been an entree portion in fact, but not an unusual preparation)\n\n-  Truffle Risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano   --- really really perfectly prepared...!!!\n\n-  Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast, a green (perhaps raw kale?)  & wild huckleberry sauce  (duck was moist and came out a perfect medium-rare, the portion size was really generous, the sauce was delicious, but the green needed to be braised a little bit as it was too tough)\n\n-  Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e  (good but not memorable)\n\n-  Semifreddo All' Amaretto (good but not memorable)\n\nOne of the BEST thing was having animated conversations with the two tables next to ours.

Isa was offering a special 5 course tasting menu for $59 and had vegetarian options listed for each of the courses so I was already excited. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very \"cozy\" - we were seated towards the back annex which was pretty cold even though they had heat lamps on. They seemed to pack as many people in as possible for the NYE rush, I felt a little bit like a sardine in a can. Talk about claustrophobia. Upon being seated we were immediately greeted with some bread and better (meh) and a cold glass of complimentary champagne. Our server was very nice and took our groups entire order at once. \n\nThe dishes started coming out slowly. It's always awkward being one of the first ones to get your dish while you wait patiently for the rest of the party to get their dishes. I wish the kitchen would wait to serve the group together rather than sending dishes out randomly. Further, throughout the night the kitchen did not send out dishes in order of how we ordered. Some people were eating their third course while others had been served their fourth course (and would later receive their third course). \n\nTo further complicate things, they didn't even wait for you to finish your course before they brought your next course. It was not uncommon for some people in our party to have no food while others in our party had two dishes, one that they were eating and the other that was standing (and getting cold) by. The 5 courses were very filling though none were particularly noteworthy. My favorite dish of the night was the flourless chocolate cake dessert which was warm and freshly baked and accompanied with a vanilla gelato.\n\nThe food here was simply OK here, the wait service was pretty good, and the kitchen just seemed like a disorganized mess. When the meal was over and we were ready to pay, we were notified that they would only accept 2 credit cards for the entire party. This would've been useful information for them to share with me one of the three times they called me beforehand to confirm the reservation or to see if we wanted to place our order in ahead of time to \"help out the kitchen\". Therefore it was a little complicated to figure the bill out (who carries cash these days anyway?) but with a few runs to the ATM and the help of the manager who broke some of the 20s, we were able to get the job done.\n\nTip:\n*I wouldn't recommend Isa for groups larger than 6\n\nBottom line, this isn't traditional French cooking by any means but more of a non-French chef's take on French cuisine.", "author": "H T."}

We ordered the spaghetti dish on accident and when it was brought out, we told our waiter that it was our fault we didn't mean to order the spaghetti. Our waiter was nice enough to exchange it for the Risotto. Few minutes later our waiter asked us if we want to box up the spaghetti or else it would be thrown away. We said okay and he said he will have to charge us for it. He didn't mention we were going to be charged til we asked him. Granted it was our fault we ordered the wrong dish..but you would think at a place like this and seeing how our bill was $631, they can comp us spaghetti that cost them $10 to make.

I get that, we overstayed our welcome, but we were not at the table talking for 30 mins. We just finished dessert about 5-10 mins and they started to ask us to leave. The final problem we had with this place is that they counted our money wrong when we paid the bill. 5 of us at the table counted the money and we were told we were $4 short. This caused some confusion because the 5 of us counted. So this prompt one of us to go up to cashier and ask her how we were short. The cashier said we are not short we are over thirty cents. Wait? We were just told by another person we were short $4. \nVery unorganized. As others said on Yelp, service was incredibly rushed and horrible!!!  If you are looking for a place to get together with your friends for dinner and conversation, don't come here. This is a place where you eat and leave. Don't even think about staying and conversating.", "author": "Kiwi T."}

We showed up early for our reservations because parking was at our mercy in that busy part of the Marina on a sunday evening. We checked in with our waitress and off we were to our seats on the patio floor. \n\nWe opted for two prix fix menus and also wanted to get additional appetizers off the regular menu. BIG MISTAKE. The host did let us know as soon as we got seated that Isa portions are to be shared. All we did was nod our heads in acknowledgment but in one ear and out the other it went! \n\nFrom the prix fix menu we ordered : Yellowfin tuna with spicy sri racha (very faint taste of spiciness), Salmon carpaccio with capers and creme fraiche (pretty bland and texture wasn't too impressive), grilled angus flat iron steak with green beans and fingerling potatoes (good but very BORING. I personally would not order steak if it's the only steak option on the entire menu but bf wanted to get this. Nothing too special about this dish but the potatoes were very nicely seasoned and crispy, like a chip), truffle risotto was SOO delicious! The creaminess of the risotto mixed with the subtle sweetness of the shitake mushrooms was a perfect balance and nicely topped off with the saltiness of the reggiano cheese. Mmm..definitely coming back again for this wonderful treat. We ordered the seared foie gras (why not? as long as the establishment offers it) the portion was HUGE. Anywhere you go, it usually comes in a small palm sized (if even) piece of it and you're always left wanting more. Not this time! This time was different. We could not even finish it, sadly to say, and had to be done with it because of its richness. We also ordered the mussels which we both thought was just ehh. The broth was a bit too salty and I, personally am not a huge fan of the mollusk, am very picky when it comes to ordering mussels. \n\nSo onto the dessert. After all that richness of the foie gras, I craved..no, needed something citrus-y and light. We had the grapefruit shaved ice with a drizzle of vermouth (yum and did the trick) and the creamy mascarpone with fresh fruit and huckleberry trifle (I LOVE mascarpone cheese on anything and the whole thing was kinda like a modernly constructed cheesecake). \n\nNo, of course we didn't finish everything! We barely touched the steak because I wanted to save room for dessert and I wanted the risotto for lunch the next day. We were stuffed beyond stuffed. The bill came out to be about $120 with tax and tip. I think we could've gotten away with just one prix fix dinner and two options off the regular menu.

From ambiance to service, and we will get to food... this place is HOT. \n\nLet's start off by saying, we had to wait almost an hour to be seated that particular evening. There were multiple parties all waiting to be seated when we arrived for our reservation. Apparently someone overbooked that night. \n\nThe restaurant is a family style eating and so you can imagine, parties can take their time eating like this. Good wine, large plates, a lot of conversation.. you get the picture. Diners can spend up to 2 hours at their table. \n\nSo you ask, I had to wait that long to be seated, even with a reservation, and you still give it 5 stars? Say it with me now... \"Yes! The food is that damn good.\"\n\nThe waiter was charming and made a lot of great suggestions. The decor was fresh and quirky. I love love loved it.\n\nHere is what we ordered: From the Prix Fix Menu, there were 3 of us and we could all order 1 item a piece. Since it was family style, we all ate real well that night. What a fantastic deal.\n\nStarters:\n\nOrganic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio, Steamed Prince Edward island mussels, and Dungeness Crab Salad\n\nEntrees:\n\nTruffle Risotto, Seared Scallops, and Duck Breast\n\nDessert:\n\nSemifreddo All'Amaretto, Vanilla Bean Gelato, and Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee\n\nThe best part though? The Foie Gras. It wasn't on the Dine About Town menu but the hostess suggested it to us when she came to our table to apologize again for the long wait. Hands down delicious. My friends enjoyed some great wine pairings with their meals as well. \n\nWe all appreciated the food and service so much, and honestly, once the meal started, we weren't even thinking about how long we waited to be seated. How great is that?I took tons of pictures and shared them with everyone I could like I was a proud mama.", "author": "Payal P."}

One could actually develop a palate eating at a restaurant like this so be sure to bring your kids so they aren't at risk of becoming future fake foodies. \n\nFrom the moment we stepped into the etherial semi-outdoor dining area (don't worry, it is heated and very clean!), I was overcome by what seemed to be black truffle 'land-mines,' exploding throughout the restaurant and into my nose. Our waiter was a bit 'involved,' in explaining the intricacies of the menu, but his sweet personality really shone through - he was passionate, and that's always fine by me because I am too! Besides, when is the last time you had service that actually and obviously cared about you as a person, I was taken back.\n\nOn to the food: Pt Reyes Oysters with a light spicy mignonette The seared scallops were perfectly cooked (slightly raw in center, and perfectly opaque). The salad was rather un-mentionable; bleu and walnuts with a mild vinegratte, really the plain-jane of the affair. The signature Pancetta wrapped bass was absolutely delightful - in a rich olive oil and red pepper/ caper sauce which complemented the light notes of the fish while not overpowering the flavor, nor sogging the perfectly crisp pancetta. The star of the show was the black truffle and fungi risotto- the best I've ever had, and we have all had good risotto here in epicurian Mecca (SF)! The perfect looseness of the rice fused brilliantly with the combo of Princely Parmigiano-Reggiano, Morelles, Black Truffle...and I did die, and am risen. Great gellato with lemon biscotti too. \n\nOur waiter made a point to mention to us that, amongst fine diners in SF, Isa Restaurant is their 'home base,' for regularly, exceptional cuisine! I am a convert. You know a restaurant is good when you leave full, but your soul is still hungry! Thank you Isa Restaurant. \n\nPS Sunday is Prix Fix day - Appatizer, Entree, and Dessert for about $30/p!", "author": "Zizzle f."}

The oysters were fresh, and the mignonette had a little kick to it. The lobster broth with prawns is packed full of concentrated lobster flavors. The prawns added just enough sweetness to the briny broth. The Gamma by the glass was an excellent pairing for all the seafood dishes. Truffle and mushroom risotto was also a little taste of heaven..how can you go wrong with wild baby mushrooms and a light overtone of tartuffo paired with creamy perfectly cooked rissotto? Although stuffed, I did manage to taste the flat iron steak which was tender and delicious. To finish off with a pear and mascarpone trifle topped with huckleberry sauce i would say is the perfect end to a happy meal :)\n\nNot a lot of parking, and the food comes out very quickly.

She understood that it was restaurant week and they were definitely packed but calling twice to confirm the reservation?\n\nThey wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived, so a couple of them parked illegally so we can get seated before they gave our table away then left to park.\n\nOnce we were seated, things started to look up from there.

We did trade bites tho.\n\nThe crab salad was light and refreshing, salmon carpaccio was also very good. \n\nFor the entree, all of the ones we ordered were good. I especially liked the steak and the duck breast. Both cooked to tender medium rare and the moutarde verte sauce really added to the steak. My friend who ordered her duck well done didn't like how it was still a bit pink. The roast chicken ordered by another friend was a bit dry.\n\nAs for dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was really good.

We didn't like the Number Seven, probably because of the champagne, but the Lemon Drop was great. My boyfriend was also drunk after about 3 sips.... We later ordered the McIntyre Pinot Noir for the table, which was delicious.\n\nSERVICE -- The hostess in the front was a delight. Our waiter I'm only giving Isa 4 stars. He was an older Asian man who talked to us like we were idiots, wouldn't stop talking, and seemed fairly oblivious to what we actually wanted (i.e. a wine recommendation, but no food recommendations, and for him to stop talking). He was completely irritating, and we didn't need him to walk us through every single menu item.\n\nFOOD - We were *strongly* encouraged to order one item from the top half of the menu and one item from the bottom half of the menu per person. We actually ordered 5 and 5 dishes for the 6 of us, which was the perfect amount of food (maybe just a little too much). The waiter warned us, on repeat, that the chef was a proponent of \"something called family style\" and that he recommended we plan on sharing everything, which we did. \n\nSalmon Carpaccio - incredibly well done, delicate, and flavorful. Just perfect. \n\nArugula Salad - Great proportions of all the ingredients and very fresh with a light dressing. \n\nTruffle Risotto - probably my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly infused with a great combination of rice and mushrooms. \n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb - a little gamey, even though our waiter promised it wouldn't be, but otherwise delicious. Not easy to share, but still good. \n\nDuck Breast - definitely interesting, but not my favorite. \n\nNot particularly memorable but still good: Yellowfin Tuna, Butter Lettuce Salad, Grilled Local Calamari, Seared Scallops, and the Flat Iron Steak. \n\nSUMMARY - The food was mostly outstanding, and if I were able to request a different server, I'd be back here in a heartbeat.

My party was a party of three so we tried as much as we could.  Overall the experience was delicious! \n\nFirst Course recommendations:\n-Baked Laura Chenel goat cheese with pesto, tomato & pine nuts. This dish is divine! Get wild and spread it over the house bread...\n-Simply sauteed Sea of Cortez wild prawns with parsley, garlic & lemon. AMAZING.  A dish I would certainly come back for. \n-Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple & grapefruit. This salad is refreshing!\n\nSecond Course recommendations: \n-Seared scallops topped with bacon, served with butternut squash, sweet potatoes and spinach. There is something really cute about this dish and the bacon adds a fun/strong taste. \n-Grilled golden date natural angus flat iron steak served with zucchini and polenta. I love how rare the steak comes out and I surprisingly really enjoyed the polenta.\n\nDessert recommendation: \nWe tried three desserts but the easy winner was the flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelatto. A wonderful pairing, both equally amazing!  I would come back for this alone. \n\nDATs, in general, are tricky but this one was worth it!", "author": "Sarah Z."}

Here's what stood out to me:\n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast\nI've never had duck and was feeling adventurous.  I really enjoyed it.  The sweetness from the sauce and the beets were a nice compliment to the meat.\n\nThe Pan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range Chicken\nPlain and simple comfort food at it's best.  From the mashed potatoes to the fresh vegetables served on the side this dish tasted like something my mom would make on Sunday.  I was surprised to find such a for lack of a better word \"snuggly\"  dish on the menu.   The chicken fell off the bone, just lovely.\n\nSteamed Prince Edward Island Mussels\nThis was a table favorite.  The broth was full of flavor and the mussels were tender and tasty.  It's served with a side of crusty bread for soaking up the brothy goodness and the bottom of the bowl.\n\nSea of Cortez Wild Prawns\nSauteed prawns in garlic and lemon.  How can you go wrong?  The prawns were garlicy and juicy.  The two orders of this were gone in a flash.\n\nWe ended out meal with mascarpone and berries.  It was described to us as a deconstructed cheese cake.  A light refreshing little dessert.  The natural sweetness of the berries was just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth.\n\nWe had a great time eating and catching up on this and that.  Our server was full of personality and very helpful when describing items on the menu.  We had a few challenges getting the attention of the wait staff.  There wasn't a lot of checking in and flagging people down became a task.  \n\nThe interior is dark and romantic looking.  The close proximity of the tables kind of decreases the intimacy level though.  The people at the next table can literally reach over and take the salt off your table.  We caught the tail end of a couple have a pretty nasty argument. Yikes!\n\nI wouldn't come here if I was in a rush to be somewhere else.  Sometimes you just want to see where the night takes you.

Cafe Gibraltar was much like that.\n\nThe excitement ended the moment I asked for a prix fixe course swap off the a la carte menu. A moment of confusion that apparently ruffled our server's feathers, we were then given the prix fixe menu and the server went on to make sure we knew that if we did not order a la carte we would lose 1000 points off the open table reservation. At this point it's amusing that changing menus could cause a slight ruckus. A bit abrasive but no big deal, we were excited to try the dishes.\n\nThe menu choices on a 5 point rating system. \n1 = Eek! Methinks not. 5= Woohoo! As good as it gets!\n\nThey don't deserve any preparation details as the dishes were about as plain as they sound. \n\n\nMe\n- Lobster soup, 2.5\n.........A bit watered down, but decent taste. The lobster was a bit rubbery and lacked flavor, but the broth was pretty good.\n\n- Steak, 1\n..........I love steak. It's pretty hard to give me a steak I don't care to continue eating, however Isa was up for the challenge and they delivered. I ordered a medium steak, which was served a bit raw with a dash of rubbery in the middle. \n\n At first I was trying to be nice after glancing at my dinner buddies' plates and noticing how weird the halibut looked lying on a bed of bleeding beets and noticed that my $7 lack table from Ikea had more personality than the chicken before me...\n\n Then I tasted the red rubber steak I just shared with them and realized that culinary altruism is a curse in a chefless diner. In fairness, the flavors weren't horribly lacking, it was just the preparation. I'm not sure which is a bigger fail, preparation or flavors?\n\nDining Buddy #1\n- Calamari, 3\n..........These were pretty decent, they taste better when combined with the peas they are served with. They were cooked well, and overall were what you would expect calamari to be. \n\n- Chicken & Mashed Potatoes, 3\n..........The skin was crispy, the juices were good, and they served alot of mashed potatoes, however Applebee's garlic mashed potatoes are better and I would have traded their chicken for our homecooked lemon pepper chicken in a second. Sidenote: Jean George's makes a killer parmesan crusted lemon chicken. \n\nDining Buddy #2\n- Mussels, 2\nTasted like Mussels.\n\n- Halibut, 1\n..........My dining buddy was likewise mutually unimpressed with the courses so far, so it should have been no surprise when she stepped outside midmeal for a cigarette after taking a bite of her halibut.\n\nAs we all know, a cigarette break mid-course in a restaurant with excellent food would likely taint your taste buds and break the flow of the tasting. With a meal that is so engaging you wouldn't want to step outside. At this point we knew we lost her, so I tasted the tail end of the halibut (typically the tastiest part in my opinion).\n\n I tasted an underlying taint of frozen/unfrozen but slightly expired and cooked halibut. It had that slight aftertaste of expiration that I recognize from my former fraternization days of old smelly beer battered tilapia from the fridge in a house full of boys.\n\n___\n\nThe Service, 0\n..........I'll spare all the details, but to sum it up - the server was rude, really rude. His solution to our halibut problem was to remove the prix fixe and charge a la carte sans the halibut. Weird! Then when we said we still wanted the prix fixe desert he became abrasive and muttered about how unbelievable it was. \n\nAll this over a halibut that was clearly expired, but that the server became indignant and rude was clearly the mark of a restaurant that is not on it's way to receiving a star. \n\nThe food ok/subpar, the service worse than Chili's Bar & Grill, but mostly it's the food that won't bring me back. If I had a bad server at Jean George's (and that would never happen), but if I did... I'd still go back for the food. Unfortunately the bad service was bad enough to turn a bland food experience into a horrible one.", "author": "Roxy G."}

This is my first review.... it obviously takes a lot to ruin my dining experience, but my evening at Isa was so bad- I finally felt inclined to contribute.\n\nThis is exactly what I would expect from the Marina- over priced, superficial, and run of the mill- definitely not worth it. Try Garson, or The Claude Cafe if you want a better French/Cal cuisine... \n\nLets be real- prix fixe  & family style are two different things. As is delivering food in courses- vs delivering food after all the guests finish their orders. One of the main dishes we ordered, the chicken from the prix fixe, (keep in mind there were 7 of us who all did prix fixe meals), came out when the rest of us had been patiently waiting for the server to clear our plates so we could order dessert.  Not ideal. And when we mentioned we'd just rather have it to go, the server reminded us it wasn't his fault the way things come out. In stead of blame shifting- try apologizing.

My dad would always splurge on food and wine and not hesitate to take us kids along to the fancy places. The running joke in the family was that before I could even read, I'd point at an item on the menu insisting that I wanted it for dinner and of course it never failed to be the most expensive dish. Back then I would stare at grown-up couples all dressed up out on date night and I couldn't wait to be one of them. \n\nI've come twice to Isa, each time feeling like one of those couples now that I am grown up and have found someone to share my love of food with. On our first visit we were seated at one of the snug little tables by the window, very close to two other tables, but yet we felt like we were in our own little world. The place is filled with conversation, laughter and noises from the kitchen, nonetheless you lose yourself in twosomeness here. The second time we opted to sit at the bar, our menus barely legible under the small, tinted lamp that is bolted on the bar. The waiters are once again attentive, but know when to just let you enjoy yourselves. \n\nThe Maine Lobster Broth is divine and the Tomales Bay Pt Reyes oysters are fresh fresh fresh with a nice spicy orange mignonette. \n\nFor the main courses, we had the Maple Leaf Duck Breast and the Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak the first time we came here. The duck was heavenly accompanied by beets, ch\u00e8vre and arugula. The steak was cooked medium rare to perfection. \nOn our second trip, I opted for the Dutch Valley Veal Sweetbreads with mushroom fricassee, mash potato and potato rosti. The sweetbreads were juicy, tender and melted on my tongue. The selection of mushrooms made my heart jump with joy. I devoured this dish. My boyfriend opted for the special of the day, butter fish with a brown butter sauce served over haricot verts and artichoke hearts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-18", "description": "Came here for Dine About Town over the weekend and had a fantastic time. FYI, Isa is ONLY serving from the DAT menu until Jan 31. Luckily the menu is fairly extensive and they have a couple of additional items and add-ons.\n\nFor $5 extra you can get the lamb chops entree, and I think you can substitute any entree for foie gras. I sometimes wish they told you the specials when you sit down so that you haven't already committed and fantasized about your future meal before they spring on some new options. How rude is that! I'm mostly joking. \n\nCouldn't help but get a cocktail (who knew it was happy hour! it was so dark outside I didn't even realize it was between 5-7 and cocktails and glasses of wine were only $5!) I decided on Number Seven, which I think was a soju cocktail with huckleberry and ginger. Twas good, but what an unoriginal name. At least it was actually the seventh cocktail on the list. \n\nThe coolest thing about Isa is that \"everything is served family style\" or to share. So even though we all chose our own appetizers and entrees, they did a nice job of bringing out each dish individually so that we could focus on one dish and share it among the three of us. It lengthened our meal and made our eating experience more  enjoyable! I liked the style a lot; it allows you to actually focus on a dish and savor it.\n\nOut of all the appetizers, I most enjoyed the salmon carpaccio. It's a nice one to share. The dungeness crab salad was also really good. The prawns were okay, it surprisingly came with five(!!) and the oil is perfect for dipping bread into. I found the prawns to be a little too salty though and I usually don't complain about saltiness. \n\nBy the way, the bread is on point. It's like lightly toasted and still warm and just perfect. Beware of accidentally eating too much while waiting... and in between courses. \n\nAs far as entrees go, I got the chicken with mashed potatoes (sounds boring I know) but the chicken was moist, flavorful, and tantalizing! It was the last dish to arrive yet I still ate a hefty portion as it was just that good. \n\nThe petrale sole was also quite good. I wasn't that fond of the veggies it came with (some squash and artichokes) because they gave us the same ones in the steak entree. I did NOT enjoy the steak with bernaise sauce. Not worth it. Plus it comes with polenta and I have a deep seated hatred for polenta because it never tastes like anything and I don't understand how it could ever be good with anything.\n\nAs for desserts, do not get the grapefruit granite unless you LOVE grapefruit and can handle the sour-ness. It is incredibly intense but probably the lightest option out of the four. The very creamy vanilla bean gelato comes with both the biscotti order and the flourless chocolate cake. I loved the chocolate cake, which was quite light and almost souffle-like on the inside. The portion is perfect in that the last bite is JUST enough to not push you over the edge to discomfort but you're still scraping at the sides of the ramekin to clean off the chocolate remains because it is just that good.  \n\nAfter all of these words, I would definitely recommend Isa either for DAT or just on a regular day. Apparently their usual prix-fixe menu is cheaper than DAT. \n\nAlso, their back patio seating is super cute, warm, and feels kind of like a tent! It is spacious enough and also has a homey feeling.", "author": "Lydia W."}

We enjoyed most of our appetizers: oysters, salmon carpaccio, tomato salad but the grilled calamari was a huge miss.  The sides and garnish that accompanied each dish were not always complementary.  For example, the halibut came on a bed of beet cubes which stained the fish a reddish color.  The steak dish was cooked perfectly and flavored quite nicely, but it would have been better without the horseradish sauce on top.  \n\nServices was slow and gruff at times, even on a slow night.  They do not have a full bar license, so only wine or beer is available.  All in all, Isa is a decent dinner spot to try if you are open to their rather unique food combination.", "author": "Wei K."}

The restaurant is \"family-style\" which is very unique for a place so expensive. They bring in the dishes with servers and each person takes a little onto their plates. Isa had a prix fixe menu and from there we ordered:\n\nAppetizers:\n- crab salad:\n- goat cheese: not a huge fan of goat cheese but the bread along with the cheese made it really good.\n- Salmon carpaccio: i am a hugeee fan of salmon. According to our waiter, this type of salmon is hard to find in everyday grocery stores. they were thinly sliced and paired with bread toast crackers. SO FRESH.\n\nEntrees: \n- Seared scallops with butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, bacon, and truffle sauce (perfect scallops, the sauce for the vegetable was delicious)\n- Grilled Golden Gate angus flat steak iron steak with zucchini, polenta, verte, and bordelaise sauce (AMAZING steak.... soo juicy and flavorful that I didn't even need steak sauce)\n- Pan roasted rocky jr. range chicken with fresh herbs, creamy potatoes, and jus de poulet (chicken was well cooked--not dry at all. The herbs went really well with the meat)\n\nDessert:\n- Semifreddo: it was a gelatto + biscotti. \n- Flourless chocolate cake: I got this one bc of the interesting name. It was definitely.... interesting. The consistency is what threw me off. It looked hard from the outside but right as I stuck my spoon into the cake, it was airy and kind of like a souffle. The vanilla gelatto that came with it was delicious and the hot-cold contrast did make it better. \n\nIsa also has happy hour until 7pm so my friends and I ordered their $5 Soju cocktails. I got the greyhound which is a grapefruit-soju drink. It tasted very bitter and it seemed as though there werent that much soju in it, but an hour or two later, I definitely felt the alcohol. I wouldn't recommend the greyhound if you like drinks that are a bit sweeter.\n\nNegative: Parking. We luckily found a spot right by the restaurant but if we hadn't, there would have been a lot of circling around--esp. because the area has a lot of restaurants and street-parking only.\n\nOverall, for the price we paid for DAT, the food was AMAZING, 5-star worthy and filling.", "author": "D S."}

Despite being late, they didn't seem to care and were very courteous and prompt. \nThe staff at the restaurant were very quick, professional, attentive and never intrusive.\nOur server was tall with glasses (highly recommend him.. didn't catch the name) with a very serious demeanor but very friendly and accommodating. He gave us the best advice ever which is that for 2 people 1 prix fixe (3 courses) and 1 extra dish is usually enough to fill you up unless you're both absolutely starving - he was right! He also was very kind to give us a taste of the pseudo Beaujolais they had that he recommended for our meal.\n\nFood: [4.8 stars] We ordered the following:\nprix fixe: Heirloom tomato salad - beautiful, simple, delicious and amazing. Truffle + mushroom risotto - nicely seasoned, not too creamy, just right. Aged goat cheese + honey - wonderful, the candied walnuts that accompanied it were fresh and not too sweet or sticky - perfect!\nNot on frix fixe: Duck - OMG did I die and go to heaven?? As soon as I had the duck I had to stop talking, close my eyes and savor the depth, smoothness, and deliciousness of this meat - supreme!!! The -0.2 comes from the fact that the salad that comes with the duck was greasy (too much bacon and olive oil), had no where near as wonderful tastes or flavors as any of the other dishes - what happened??\nIn general all the food is what a food-lovah could want: depth in flavor, exquisite use of subtle textures and seasoning - wonderful. I'm coming back just for the duck!!\n\nWine: [4.5 stars] The selection was very small, considering there is a large variety in the dishes. However, all three glasses of wine we had were delicious and went well with our meals.. despite the high price. I suggest going in a larger group where you can split a bottle if this is a consideration.\n\nDamage to the wallet: ~$100 (with 20% tip)\nOverall experience: Must find a way to make more money to come back!\nDamage to stomach: none, nothing was too sweet, too acidic or too heavy to make you feel like you ate too much or it wasn't good for you. Great balance in the dishes!!\n\nAdditional note: Waiter says he thinks the duck is #1 along with the foie gras and that the lamb is a very close second.", "author": "Acid B."}

(Couldn't resist throwing in some Jar Jar Binks speak in there.) :D\n\nBut seriously, Isa probably has THE BEST Dine About Town selection I've seen. There were tons of options for all 3 courses - practically the entire regular menu was on there! \n\nSince there were so many choices, it made it hard to decide. But since the plates are all meant to be shared, we got two orders of the mussels, sauteed prawns and Tomales Bay 1/2 dozen oysters to start. \n\nFor the second course, we spied what others around us were having and the halibut looked the best. Three of us got the halibut (which was indeed fantastic) and one flat iron steak. For some reason, the steak came out a good 15 minutes after the rest of us had already FINISHED our halibut. Obviously we were peeved about this (the experience was definitely 5 stars prior to this), but our server rectified the situation and offered a glass of wine on the house and let us choose our desserts from the regular menu.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake (which was more like a fluffy souffle) and creme brulee. The amount of food was just right and we all left satisfied with the entire meal.\n\nI've probably only been back to Isa less than a handful of times from my original review (wow, how my palate has changed! I could never do meat medium well again), but it's hands down, still my favorite restaurant in the Marina! They only have a wine and beer license though, so we had to continue our celebratory drinking elsewhere after dinner.\n\nTake advantage of the daily $35 DAT dinner menu before it ends on 6/15. Otherwise, they do have a Monday-Thursday prix fixe menu which is an even better deal at $28 for 3 courses.", "author": "Connie C."}

His training various top restaurants, such as being the garde-manger at La Folie, the vegetable guy at Masa's and the saucier at the Ritz Carlton Dining Room, has helped him create some interesting concepts for dishes.  \n\nThe one thing every French restaurant should have is good baguettes that are soft with a crinkly, crusty shell even if it's not baked fresh and bought elsewhere.  This is key for all the dipping dishes, such as the goat cheese and cleaning off the plates of the scallops with truffles and lobster boulllabaisse with the delightful sauces even if that is not good etiquette.  The sea of Cortez is a plate of succulent, jumbo prawns gone wild in terms of its size.  Usually, I'm a fan of duck, but this place presents it with a tender center and hard casing as if it was duck sausage or breast.  Although the sauces are at times too strong and salty for skirt steaks and seafood, the charming atmosphere of the candlelight dinners on high chairs keeps your spirits high and craving more with a wiff of all the sweet aromas coming from the kitchen.  \n\nFinally, the best way to end your meal on a sweet note is with the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  The cake is so soft that it's like a souffle that will collapse once you take a bite.  The only thing that could top off the cake is a molten chocolate center.\n\nOther than the flare that this restaurant brings to the Marina, this place is worth a try especially when there is street parking around the corner on Fillmore and lots near the Wells Fargo bank on Chestnut (between Fillmore & Steiner) and Pierce (between Lombard & Chestnut).", "author": "Jenny L."}

I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! If you're considering this as an option for a special occasion or romantic date, book it! Very classy ambiance inside, and the outside seating has lights strung up and is so sweet and romantic.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a set menu we follow every time we come in. Everything is shared portions but not in a huge, gross Buca di Beppo kind of way.\n\nWe start with the butter lettuce salad and Baked Goat Cheese appetizer. I am obsessed with the goat cheese, it is absolutely incredible and melt in your mouth amazing. I....I can't even....just get it.\n\nWe always argue about which two main dishes to choose from out of our three favorites, which are the truffle/wild mushroom risotto (so cheesy and earthy), the spaghetti (amazing flavor and texture), and the SCALLOPSSSSS. mmmm... seriously seared to perfection. I can't even order scallops anywhere else because everything else is just disappointing after Isa's.\n\nThe semifreddo all' amaretto is divine. But seriously, you can't go wrong here. Everything is made with the freshest ingredients and I'm always so impressed by the service. They bring everything out as it is ready so you're constantly immersed in yummyness. Also, they don't judge us for our massive consumption of bread...which is a plus.\n\nThis review is 3 years overdue and I owe it to the good people of Isa to share with the world how heavenly their food is.

T'was a nostalgic time where one could actually eat in the sunlight, unblocked by the mega-skyscrapers of Market St. that suck away luminescent happiness; much as the corporations within them drain the lifeblood of our nation... like Edward does to Bella in \"Breaking Dawn\" (OH WUT SPOILER LOL).\n\nOur waiter was most amusing and informative.  After seating us, he embarked upon a nearly 20 minute lecture of the menu filled with a plethora of praises for each item such as \"delightful\", \"heavenly\", \"most excellent\", \"most exquisite\", \"perfectly delightful\", and \"perfectly perfectly perfectly delightful\".   I sat in rapt attention as he explained the origin and awesome-god-like power each dish held as if it was a holy relic in ancient history.  So in depth did he plumb, I felt quite abashed that I was not furiously taking notes about the palate-cleansing properties of the sorbet nor the number of peasants-now-migrant-workers it took to churn the fromage bleu \u00e0 p\u00e2te persill\u00e9e.  Such a build up thusly created high and lofty expectations of the subsequent food to come....\n\n....and I was not disappointed! Isa is an exception to French cuisine due to the image one conjures of \"French Cuisine\": succulent food...but served in a quantity fit for a baby hamster.  Not so at Isa's!  Ordering from the fixed menu of $28, each person receives a choice of appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert.  Portions were enormous, fresh, and ,yes, perfectly perfectly perfectly delightful.  The salmon carpozzio (spelling? f*ck it I'm not that refined) was literally an entire plate enveloped by fillets of meat.  The mussels could barely fit within the bowl of champagne they were roasted alive in.\n\nOh and the potatoes! HEAVENLY SUBLIME POTATOES.  I highly suspect that there were no mashed potatoes with our entr\u00e9es. Rather, the chef crushed a stick of butter into a mash consistency and served it right next to the roasted chicken.  Honestly, my flat iron steak was amazing, but if I could replace all appetizers, entr\u00e9es, and desserts with Isa's mashed potatoes, I would do it in a heartbeat.\n\nOverall, spectacular food. Very welcoming staff.  Somewhat pricy, but hey, it really can't be beat for the quality.\n\nTL;DR: Ask the waiter to describe the mashed potatoes and if he doesn't spend at least 15 minutes explaining how they conquer the taste buds like Alexander did to Eastern Civilization, then you got gypped with the un-extended abridged version.  Subsequently request that all menu items be replaced with said mashed potatoes and water glasses only refilled with melted butter & gravy.", "author": "Gabe W."}

This place is really small since it's one of those small restaurants in marina. The hostess was nice and friendly, kindly greeted us and sat us to our table.\n\nSince it was dine about town week, they were only offering the DAT menu, I was hoping they had the regular menu to see what else they had. So we started with the lobster soup and the leak soup, which i thought it was ok. Lobster soup kina smelled fishy, which i don't think it should be, but the chunks of the lobster was BIG. The leak soup wasn't anything special, just a typical leak soup, it didn't really wow me or anything but it was ok. For the second course, we had the crab salad and the Baked Laura chenel goat cheese, the crab salad was good, it tasted fresh and i think the portion was perfect for 2 people. The goat cheese was also not bad, it was like a spread for the bread. Oh, the bread they serve here i think is good. For the third course, I had the risotto and my friend had the steak. I think the steak was good, perfectly cooked in medium well, perfectly seasoned, the sauce was really good too. The potatoes that came with it and the zucchini was perfectly cooked and seasoned as well. The risotto was o-k. Taste wise it was good, but I think it should've cooked a little longer since I think the rice was slightly aldente, which should be cook all the way.

Their menu suggests ordering about 2 dishes per person to share. Or they have a prix fixe meal (3 courses, but still dishes that are easily shared). I came during SF Chefs 2011 Restaurant Week. They had a special, where their prix fixe meal was served with a glass of wine.\n\nWe started with the mussels and the salmon carpaccio. Both were great. The salmon was very subtle and it was good quality fish. The mussels were a lot and very tasty. Good broth and bread to soak it up.\n\nFor the second course we got the chicken and the flat iron steak. The chicken had a crispy roasted skin (it includes a breast and a thigh) and was so juicy. The mashed potatoes that came with it were smooth and buttery. The flat iron steak was nice and rare, with roasted potatoes and green beans. The steak, while good, did not stand up to the chicken.\n\nFor dessert, we had the creme brulee and the semifreddo. Both were delicious - not terribly sweet or too large.\n\nFrom sneaking a look at my neighbors, the arugula salad also looks amazing. I will definitely be back to try more of their plates.\n\nEnvironment: The front room is quite small and dark. When I came, it was pretty crowded, so I highly suggest making reservations. There's not much waiting room, so I would not suggest it for large groups. It's casual, with a pretty friendly atmosphere. Great for a somewhat casual date.\nService: Our waiter definitely knew his stuff, but was not all that friendly. I don't remember ever being asked how things were going. But service was efficient. Dishes were removed promptly, water refilled, and the pacing of our meal was quite good.", "author": "Kailyn G."}

I normally don't like restaurants where you're supposed to share small dishes, because it gets awfully expensive and I never feel like I've gotten enough of the dish that I wanted.  However, this system worked well at Isa.  Portion sizes were generous enough, the food was easily shared and there were options to suit all of us, including the vegetarian in our group.  It did end up being a little spendy, especially once we started drinking, but the overall experience was worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable and casual.  Service was great.  Our waiter was very friendly and made some good food and wine recommendations.  Some of the dishes I particularly liked: Northern Halibut a la Plancha, Potato-Wrapped Seabass, Asparagus Soup.\n\nA word of caution:  Do not park in the Pierce St. parking garage when dining in the area at night.  First of all, a quarter will get you like 3 minutes, so unless you've got a purse full of rolled quarters, you'll need to go get some more.  Also, my car got broken into in this garage while I was dining at Isa.  There's no security here, and at night it's a magnet for thieves.  You've been warned.  There are lots of meters on the street around Isa (and mercifully, most take credit cards), so get there early and take your time finding one.", "author": "Erin L."}

We were seated promptly by the hostess in the garden out in the back. Our waiter was a bit pushy and told us that each person needed to order one entree and one appetizer. We were pretty hungry and ordered a lot of food. We also shared a bottle of wine.\n\n* Butter lettuce salad with bartlett pears, candied walnuts, watercress & roaring forties blue - I really enjoyed it. It was very crisp and refreshing. Didn't hurt that they mostly used the heart of the lettuce.\n* Arugula salads with mandarines, fuji apples, fennel, lemon vinaigrette and reggiano - It was good, although I don't remember tasting any fennel in there.\n* Calamari with honey spice, flageolet beans, lemon zest & arugula - I only had one piece and it was pretty nondescript and a bit tough.\n* Scallops with sauteed asparagus, mashed potatoes & truffle sauce - It was one of the favorites of the night. The scallops were perfectly cooked -- caramelized on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauce didn't overwhelm the delicate flavor of fish.\n* Truffle risotto with baby shiitake, hon shimiji mushroom & reggiano - It was creamy and unlike some other places, the rice wasn't under cooked. The aroma of the fungi was intoxicating, so luxurious!\n* Rack of lamb with saut\u00e8ed eggplant, zucchini, red peppers, nicoise olives & lamb jus - this was my favorite of the night. The lamb was so tender and flavorful, not gamey at all. The meat is cooked to perfection, if it were cooked a little less, it would be stringy; a little more, it would be tough.\n* Duck breast with bacon, baby spinach, pinenuts, raisins, sherry & vinaigrette sauce - like the lamb, the meat was cooked perfectly. The skin wasn't as crispy as I would have liked though.\n* Flatiron steak with zucchini, fingerling potatoes, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce - This is a pattern, but all the proteins at Isa are handled with care and spectacular.\n\nBy the end of the meal, we were too full for dessert.

The main dining room is business-like, simple yet uptight almost... Walking through and out into the patio, can't help but go \"whoa...\", like watching Avatar the first time around... You walk in and the place is very comfy, pleasantly lit with strings of xmas lights, and sufficiently warm with heat lamps; superb even with pouring rain outside.\n\nWe could've done the 3-course prix fixe meal for each of us, but that didn't include the option of scallops nor seabass... so then...\n\nBread and butter starter.  It is what it is folks. \n\nDungeness crab salad was absolutely delicious. FRESH. The avocados and apple pieces played well with the crab meat... AND holy crap, there is no mayo in the salad! Well done, well well crafted... the Lady loved this dish the most, I can't really argue with her either...\n\nThen the mussels: good, but I've had better. The portion was generous, but was hoping for a bit more flavor really, either from the mussels themselves or the broth... \n\nMy other favorite dish had to be the scallops.  Five grilled scallops on a bed of buttery mash potatoes, topped with asparagus spears.  Asparagus is difficult to mess up; either you overcook them or you don't. These were perfect, of course.. The mash potatoes were great; don't remember ever having potatoes this good. Must have been all the butter in it.. And the scallops, juicy and tender. Reminded me of lobster in terms of flavor, tofu in terms of firmness.  Really amazing dish. The only drawback (kinda) was the small pool of butter from the remaining potato mash.  Women get turned off by this... Guess there's more for me then, sweeet..\n\nThe seabass was good, but can't agree with the establishment that this was their best item. Kinda overcooked in my opinion. The potato skin wrap supplied most of the flavor to the dish. It's really freakin delicious potato skin I have to say, but expected the seabass to play a bigger role in the dish.\n\nCreme brulee dessert with candle and a familiar sing-a-long for the Lady. Simple festivity, adoring recipient. Wish I had steadier camera hands.. doh!\n\nTwo coffees. Normally, I never drink coffee at the end of a dinner, it makes no sense. Shouldn't a meal start with coffee??  Nevertheless, never let a Lady drink alone... ok wow, its actually great-tasting, non-starbucks, delicious brewed coffee! Keeps the night warm..\n\nOk, so with two big hits in the dungeness and scallops, and two subtle misses in the mussels and seabass, why do I place Isa in the 5-Star echelon?\n\nGive it up for Dean. Best server in the world. He was working the patio along with his runner, was always open to random chit chat, never seemed to be in a rush to turn the table.

He forgot to bring one person's glass of wine for about twenty minutes. He forgot to take our food order for equally as long, and actually started to take away the menus before we let him know that we had not, in fact, told him what we wanted to eat. Possibly the most awkward interaction I had with the waiter was when I went to order the arugula salad. I was to share the salad (they encourage sharing on the menu) with my friend who's allergic to dairy, and she had called ahead to make sure they would allow substitutions based on dietary restrictions (they said yes), so I asked for no goat cheese. The waiter said that would be entirely impossible due to the restaurant week menu, so my friend had to explain that she had called ahead about this, etc. At this point he said that only she would be allowed to order without goat cheese, so she ordered the salad and I ordered the appetizer she was going to get... talk about overly complicated and frankly annoying.\n\nAnywho, the food itself was incroyable. I had the potato and leek soup, which was really nice though a bit thicker than I expected, and I also sampled the lobster broth soup. Hooray soup.\n\nI then had the arugula salad - very fresh, light - and mussels - some of the tastier mussels I've had in SF. For main course, I did the seared scallops - perfectly cooked - that came with creamy mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. There was also bacon on the plate, but it seemed kind of unnecessary to me. I tasted the steak, too, which was really tender, though by that point I was stuffed. I had the grapefruit granite for dessert, but I should have gone with the ice cream dish.\n\nThis is the kind of place I'll take my parents when they visit SF, but it was fun to do the restaurant week menu with a group of friends.

A bit spicy from peppers, silky, soft and with a nice bite the way perfect tuna has to be. A gorgeous red color to complement the table.\n - Crab salad. Very tasty and light.\n - Mixed salad. Tasty but not special.\n\nMains:\n - Scallops. Absolutely perfectly cooked, with fresh bright brussel sprouts and bacon for complementary flavors and textures. I only shared because I had to.\n- Potato-wrapped bass. House signature dish and worthy of the name. Fantastic presentation and delicious\n - Duck. Best duck I've ever had, and that says a lot.

The food came in a timely fashion, empty dishes were cleared, and water was refilled regularly.  There was a little mix up on our bill which was fixed right away.  We had  a wonderful evening at Isa, and will come again soon to experience other items on their menu.", "author": "Sandy L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-20", "description": "Came here for father's day dinner because my parents wanted to try French food.  I chose the place because there were significant amount of reviews on yelp and had 4 stars.  Sadly, i was disappointed. With that many reviews on Yelp and high ratings from everyone else, I expected good French cuisine. *sigh* This was the first French restaurant I have been to since moving back to San Francisco, someone PLEASE tell me that the French food here is better than this place!!!!.. PLEASE!!!!! \n\nOk, i make this place sound horrible. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think the food was bad but it was just not amazing or great or good.... It was simply, for the lack of words, EH. Nothing left an impression so for my usual \"MUST HAVE LIST\" I will have to leave blank.  Another thing I did not like about the restaurant was how everything is done family style/ tapas.  For certain dish that's fine but seriously if you order entree like dishes it just DOES NOT make sense to break up the presentation and do it family style. I understand that this way everyone can try a little of something but it ruins the presentation and some dishes ie the fish is just not meant to be shared!!!!\n\n\"WHAT WE ORDERED\" :\n1. Lobster Broth - it was very runny and not very heavy at all. the taste was ok.  tasted more like tomato soup to me.  \n\n2. Foie gras - The only dish that I thought was pretty good.  Not because the Foie gras was super good quality but the way it was prepared with the peaches.  pretty yummy\n\n3. Halibut - My sister had this and as i said before it is definitely not a dish that can be shared. If you cut into a fish like that it will just fall apart and everyone will get like one bite. I stuck a piece of the fish and thought it was seasoned well but once again nothing special\n\n4. Duck breast - this was my dish. the duck lack flavor even with the sauce. However, it was cooked just the way i liked it, so not overly cooked.  \n\n5. lamb rack - I like lamb and can take the gaminess of it but this was a bit too gamy for me.  It tasted fine but a bit too gamy.  My Dad like it so thats what matters!!!!\n\n6. Sweetbread - very heavy. sweetbread itself is not something that is light and the sauce that it was in and the mash potato just made the dish very heavy.  My mom like it till the end when she couldn't finish it.  \n\nOVERALL: The service was ok. I appreciate how they acknowledge the dads with a glass of desert wine.  It was very nice of them.  The food was EH but the price was pretty decent for French food.  Our bill came up to be ~150 w/ tip +tax for 4 people.  I am not sure if I would come back....", "author": "JY L."}

The table we got probably only seated 4 comfortably but getting cozy with close friends did not bother any of us. The dinner prix fixe menu has a choice of 8 dishes each for the 2nd and 3rd courses, so we decided to eat family-style and have everyone have a taste of twelve different dishes. We also ordered a bottle of sauvignon blanc to go with our food.\nAll of us started with the lobster broth which was very tasty and perfect for dipping the bread. The second courses that stood out were the salmon carpaccio, the yellowfin tuna tartare, and the baked goat cheese. The third courses that were exceptional were the seared scallops, duck breast, and flat iron steak, and the shortribs. The shortribs, which was a special addition to the menu that night, was probably the best dish. It tasted like it was slow-cooked then charred on the outside, which gave it a smoky, crispy outside and tender meet on the inside.\nI don't say this often, but nearly everything was delicious.\nService was fantastic and the atmosphere was intimate yet relaxed.", "author": "Alfred L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-26", "description": "I had the pleasure of dining at Isa last Saturday while on vacation in my old stomping ground of San Francisco. My mom and I took two of my girlfriends out to dinner to celebrate my dear friend (yelp name AudyV) who is not only 7 months pregnant with her first baby, but it was also her 31st birthday.  Conveniently we arrived during Dine About Town, and for $230 had a fantastic 4 course meal with delicious wine for 4 ppl.  \nThe aesthetic in the back \"patio\" is gorgeous.  I was actually surprised how warm it is under the heatlamps and we even had to turn ours off at one point! So it is definitely the best if both worlds out there given the unique indoor/outdoor space.  I can't believe I lived 3 blocks from Isa for 4 years and never dined here as a local.\nAnyway the food was just divine.  I had the potato leek soup which was creamy with robust flavors, but not heavy at all.  The others at my table ordered the shrimp in lobster broth and neither of us had a drop left in our bowls.  \nFor the second course, most of us ordered salads although we were amazed by the wide variety of offerings, most of which included some form of seafood.  I had the butter lettuce salad with goat cheese and I could eat that delicious light and flavorful salad every day.\nFor the main course I had the chicken and mashed potatoes that were far from ordinary.  This dish was on par with something you would get at One Market or Town. I snuck a few bites of Audy V's truffle risotto and I swear, I teared up a little when I tasted the insane flavor punch.  I will dream of that risotto....\nFor dessert we had the gelato dish, the grapefruit icy sorbet and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  My gelato was the winner, and the grapefruit was not our fave.\nMost of all, the best part of Isa is the service.  Our server Justin was simply incredible.  He made great suggestions for wine that both suited our palettes and our budget.  He was patient, kind, attentive without being overbearing, and absolutely made our evening.  \nThe only possible negative was the timing of the meals, although Justin was careful to set our expectations properly.  Because Isa is typically a Tapas restaurant, the timing of the courses is really sporadic, so many of us received our dishes at different times.  We kept having to remind everyone to begin eating and forgo the tradtion of waiting to eat until everyone's been served.  So that was a little confusing and frustrating t times, but otherwise an A+.\nWell done and thank you Justin for being a part of our wonderful evening!", "author": "Christine S."}

We had a reservation for 7 PM and were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nThe service, needless to say, is very quick. I appreciated that, considering how hungry I was. The portions are generous as well, as each dish is served family style. We had the baked goat cheese and steamed PEI mussels for starters. For the main entree, flat iron steak and truffle and shittake mushroom risotto. Everything up to dessert was fantastic. \n\nI didn't really like vanilla creme brulee all that much. To be honest, while I was eating it, I thought to myself that I'd rather get a cup of vanilla bean creme brulee from the creme brulee cart. \n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience for my boyfriend and I.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-15", "description": "Bam! Five stars.\n\nHere's why.\n\nService: \n\nFrom start to finish...impeccable. We arrived an hour before our reservation time. Knowing that most likely we'd need to go grab a drink elsewhere and just return at our scheduled time, we popped in to inquire just on the off chance that there was a table available for the three of us. The hostess let us know that there was a table finishing up but that it would most likely be about 15 minutes; she then personally escorted us over to an open spot at the bar and put us in the capable hands of the bartender. Who was fantastic! The hubs asked if they had Guinness and they did not, but the bartender suggested an alternative beer and described it so delectably that of course, we ordered one. Personable beyond belief. Our server, well, he was among the best parts of the evening. He explained the \"rules of the road\" and let us know that Isa recommends that each person at the table order one appetizer and one entree, and then everyone splits everything as the orders arrive. We were cautioned that things would arrive to the table as they came out of the kitchen (so, we didn't expect all three apps to land at the same time, or even before the entrees, etc.) and that was just fine with us! He also went into detail on the specials and took the time to make several specific recommendations. In the course of our initial conversation (and it was a conversation!) he let us know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant's name (EEE-sa) and let us know the story behind it (named for the chef's daughter Isabelle). Just a side note for any Yelpers thinking of trying Isa - 1. highly recommend it. 2. it's a California French style, not strictly French as categorized on Yelp. Not a huge thing, but it is definitely not purely French. Personally, the Californication of the food makes for a phenomenal product. Lastly about our knowledgeable, grin-inspiring server before I start in on the food: in the course of our conversation he came out with a from-the-gut laugh that was irreverent! It was one of those laughs that just makes you laugh as well. His laugh left all of us giggling along with him long after he'd left the table.\n\nFood:\n\nWe followed protocol and ordered three appetizers and three entrees, along with one side dish. First up: Tomales bay Pt Reyes oysters (6 oysters on the half shell with spicy orange mignonette). Fresh oysters are hard to mess up, but the orange mignonette really took them over the top into sublime territory. Next came the Yellowfin tuna with spicy sriracha, toasted sesame, seaweed, avocado, nori and low sodium soy. Fresh, bright flavor! The clean flavor of the tuna was nicely offset by the mellow creaminess of the avocado. Yum! Our third appetizer was the Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & tarragon. Once again, a perfect symphony of complementary ingredients. The mellow of the crab was balanced with the creamy avocado and sweet apple, then perked up by the grapefruit and tarragon. C'est magnifique.\n\nOur entrees began to arrive next. Our first entree was the Seared scallops with saut\u00e9ed asparagus, garlic & truffle sauce. Four seared scallops were arranged on the plate with a mound of what may have been whipped potatoes topped with several spears of asparagus and drizzled with truffle sauce. The flavors came together beautifully and the truffle flavor was nicely subtle. We actually ordered a side dish of asparagus as well, not realizing that the scallops came with asparagus, but believe me, every stalk of asparagus on the table was eaten and enjoyed. The next entree to arrive was Seasonal Fish (halibut) with artichokes, tomato confit, olives, basil & zucchini. Delicious! Our final entree was the Potato wrapped Seabass with capers, fresno peppers, parsley, tomato confit, brown butter and lemon juice. The dish was excellent, but I am a sucker for anything brown butter so it put the entree over the top. \n\nAfter enjoying our apps and entrees so very much, we had to continue on to dessert. The hubs was being good and although we almost talked him into the grapefruit granite, he abstained and so we ordered two desserts instead of three. Both arrived at the same time, the first was a vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e which was sublime. The next was a vanilla bean gelato with biscotti and espresso, also fantastic. \n\nI cannot wait to come back here, it was just a phenomenal experience.", "author": "Trip C."}

Oh well ,all I know and care is the food did not retain their qualities :(\n\nWe really like the atmosphere especially the area in the back. They used to have an outdoor tent but now they completely insulated the area. Works with me. I don't mind. \n\nSo we went ahead with the 3-course fixed menu of the day. Somewhat around $30/ person. They ran out of what they had on the 3-course menu for appetizers. So we got to order the a-la-carte appetizers for no additional price. We had the tuna carpaccio, exactly what we ordered a year ago. It was as good as it used to be. We also ordered the yellowfin tuna. Raw yellowfin tuna to be eaten with toast. Pretty good for the appetizers. \n\nFor entrees, we had a risotto and the angus flat iron steak. These are just so so...... I would even say the risotto was.... ew.\n\nDesserts were hooorible! We had the grapefruit granite and semifreddo all amaretto. Absolutely no plating and/or presentation. Tasted very weird as well. The quality of the desserts totally cheapened the place. Very disappointed.  \n\nOh, we also ordered drinks: a Mojito and some red wine. Red wine is fine bc obviously its what you chose off the wine list. The Mojito was disappointing.....  Weird glass size for that type of drink, but that's fine. It tasted so bad that I barely drank any.....\n\nIn conclusion, the $30 3-course is a good deal.

This way we get to taste more.\n\nThe foie gras was definitely the best ever. Succulent, perfectly cooked, amazing sides that enhanced its flavor. It was an OMG dish. My partner and I thought that if this is an indication of what to expect next, then we're in for a truly fabulous treat.\n\nDungeness crab salad with avocado, grapefruit, apple and tarragon. Very light dressing, wonderful mix, very generous serving of perfectly seasoned crab. \n\nWe had two second courses, and it was a tie as to which one was the better one. \n\nThe flat iron steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare). The special menu said the steak was served with moutarde verte and bordelaise sauce. Truly amazing flavors. I'm actually glad they sliced the steak so that it was easy to share. We were literally lapping up the sauce with every bite. So scrumptious.\n\nThe duck breast with what appeared to be currant sauce was exceptional.

Parking is a headache, but remember that it's the marina/cow hollow.

I really wasn't expecting that at a French restaurant but I was quite impressed.  Another great thing is we didn't know it until after we were leaving the restaurant, but the world-renowned chef was actually serving our dishes and clearing the table just like any other staff member!  \n\nWe ordered soooo much and it was all delicious.  \n- Tomales Bay Oysters with spicy orange mignonette: I usually pass on oysters, but these were flavorful, not too fishy, and the mignonette was pretty insanely good\n- Maine Lobster broth: rich and thin soup base from lobster with tiger prawns. sooooo good for soup on a slightly chilly evening\n- Hudson Valley Grade A Foie Gras: gizzard lovers, you will love it!  This is the first time I've had Foie Gras and it was gamy, but good and extremely rich.  They give you a good sized duck liver too. That combined with the custard brioche (so buttery) made my heart stop for a second and I decided to go easy on the high cholesterol stuff.  Good but needs to be shared with others in small portions!\n- Season Fish was tasty and cooked to perfection on top of vegetables. A hint of bell peppers and other vegetable flavor seeped into the fish, which we all enjoyed.\n- Seared scallops were my favorite dish by far.\n\nI don't remember everything else, but the wine list was extensive, food was perfection, and the service is terrific!  I must save up before returning here.", "author": "Dee H."}

My husband asked me to choose a nice restaurant so I decided on Isa because I remember the food was delicious years ago when Luke Sung, the original owner used to own the restaurant.  So the day comes and I'm excited to taste the yummy food again.  We ordered the lobster broth, dungeness crab salad, scallops, wild prawns, potato wrapped seabass and roasted rack of lamb.    The lobster broth was so salty that I only had a couple sips. The dungeness crab salad was ok since the ingredients tasted fresh but there was barely any dressing. My husband said the scallops were still raw in the middle.  The prawns were definitely not fresh and tasted mushy. The seabass was way overcooked. My husband said the lamb was disgusting and chewy....to the point where he had to spit it out!  I want to add that my husband will eat just about anything, so for him to spit something out, that says a lot to me!! \n\nThe worst part was.....this may be TMI but my tummy started to feel funny and I had to use the restroom before we were even done with the meal! We sure as hell didn't stay for dessert!! \n\nWhat a way to ruin our first date night.  I don't know who's in the kitchen \"cooking\" the food but they should look for new jobs cause they suck at it!\n\nWe will never patron this \"restaurant\" again.", "author": "Crystal Y."}

He was passionate and amazingly friendly. The host was also very helpful, well spoken, and considerate, opening the door for us as we walked out. If only someone would have cleared away our dishes more quickly, the service would have been perfect.\n\nTHE FOOD: $100.36 (including 2 cocktails)\n* Foie gras and wine pairing - 4/5 - The foie and custard brioche were amazing, even though the huckleberries slightly overpowered the foie and the mango was hard to identify (We debated whether there was papaya mixed in). The wine pairing was an amazing, sweet and savory white.\n* Garlic prawns - 1/5 - Very tasty garlic butter parsley combo, but there was a dark, short, curly hair (...) in our food and unidentifiable hard granules larger than sand that almost broke my teeth.\n* Seared scallops - 5/5 - You wouldn't think cherry tomatoes, fava beans, and corn could be that tasty, but this was my favorite dish. Perhaps it was the truffle sauce.\n*Grapefruit granite - 4/5 - A coarsely textured, tangy granite. Refreshing for your palette, but not as amazing as:\n* Semifreddo all' amaretto - 5/5 - Dean described this dish as \"almond gelato\" but it is so much more than that! Amazingly fluffy and creamy, with soft cookie bits adding to the texture and flavor. Plus, almond cookies and mint as garnish. I was scraping the plate on this one.\n\nTIPS:\n*On a date? Isa is in the heart of the Marina. Take a walk under the romantic Palace of Fine Arts.\n*Foie gras lives! Isa has a Foie Gras Fan Club mailing list based on the premise that there may be a loophole in the law banning Foie Gras (effective 7/1/12). The idea is that the ban is on foie gras sold and bought in CA, and they order theirs from NY, so they may be able to have some sort of foie gras event in the future. Stay tuned.\n*Update: In light of the new Word of the Week in Time Magazine (7-30-12), I just had to say: Perhaps Isa will become a \"Duckeasy\"--A restaurant that clandestinely serves foie. Wouldn't that be neat?!\n\n\nOVERALL:\nGo, and go again. Just don't get the shrimp.", "author": "Fawn B."}

You take a large scoop of them, and depending on work schedules and obligations they begin to sift out. However, what you're left with is pure gold.\n\nLast night our considerably downsized group visited Isa for Dine About Town, and enjoyed the intricacies of a well thought out menu, some heavy pours, and as always, colorful conversation.\n\nIsa is a gorgeous space with a sleek, modern front, and a wonderland for a back patio. Seated in the back, we immediately forgot that the sky was wet, and felt transported to a warm spring night on a vineyard.\n\nOur server was fantastic. He was so giddy, and jovial, that it sounded like his voice was balancing on a medicine ball. His thoughts just couldn't keep up with his mouth.\n\nOne of the main reasons I chose Isa for DAT, was the amount of options they presented for each course. Many restaurants have a fixed 3 course for DAT, but Isa really gave you the freedom to choose.\n\nStarted with the Steamed Prince Edward mussels in a garlic white wine broth. The mussels held enough texture to keep the sea, but melted in the garlic broth. A heavy portion, the mountain of black shells were a delight.\n\nMoving on, the Petrale sole in lemon butter was gentle and comforting. Surrounded with soft baby greens and topped with diced tomatoes and peppers, the dish was a concoction of simple magic.\n\nEnding it all, I dived into a generous slab of Bucherondin de chevre drizzled with star anise honey and walnuts. Succulent, rich, it was the perfect note to sum up the meal.\n\nIsa is a wonderful combination of soothing ambiance, a daringly rich menu, and a staff that fire lights the room. \n\nChef Luke has something great here, and it'd be a shame to miss it.", "author": "Mike K."}

I kid u not...dollar signs and pictures of small portion of food literally pops up in my brain! hahhahhahha :) \n\nSo for me to like ISA must mean that I did not pay for it or it was really really good food that deserve 4 stars! well lucky me it was both of those things! The two times that I ate at ISA I did not pay and the food was always very good. The first time I went there I was on a date and my date ate less than me (not a good sign). We shared a salad, risotto, duck breast and creme brulee. The portions were small for me but apparently my date is full already (darn it!) I guess we're not getting anymore food :( The second time I went there, I only remembered eating spicy tuna crudo, the scallop and flourless chocolate cake. It was all very yummy but once again I go home feeling hungry. \n\nOverall, I love the atmosphere of this place. I liked the fact that they have a back patio that is very cozy and romantic :) If you are prepared to spend a good amount of money for the \"many\" food that you're gonna eat then this place is for you. hahhahha...well if you eat anywhere like me then you will def spend ALOT more money regardless! maybe I can score another date to eat here for free...just kidding!

We were already on a tight schedule as we had somewhere else to go after dinner, so due to dinner starting so late, it also made us late to our second venue for the evening. I have never waited so long to be seated with a reservation, and I was honestly very shocked, esp being a party of 16 ppl! \n\n2nd setback of the evening- I was told that my corkage fee would be waived if I purchased equal bottles of wines from the restaurant (which I did), however when the bill came, I was still charged for corkage.

It's been a while since I've had a nice dinner in a nice place, and this was a great way to end the year.\n\nA coupla initial notes:\n+ There's a prix fixe menu, 2 or 3 courses for $24 or $28, but as our server recommends: food here is best enjoyed family-style.  He's right.  Tapas is the way to go.  \n+ All drinks are $5 for Happy Hour, which is Mon - Thurs before 7pm.  We were lucky and ordered our drinks at 6:59pm.  PHEW!  \n+ Parking is very difficult and annoying in the Marina.  Be prepared.\n+ You can dress up or dress down at this place, which I like.  No need to bust out your finest suits and dresses, but a nice top/skirt combo or dress would be appropriate for ladies.  \n\nThe (very long) deets of the eats:\n+ Bread: Delicious and, as other Yelpers have noted, endless!  I think I must've eaten 4 or 5 pieces.  It's crunchy and soft, just very good all-around bread.  4.5/5\n+ Dungeness crab salad: A generous portion of crab, with avocado, various leafy greens, apple (or was it pear?).  Light, appetizing, a great starter.  Best part: I very much appreciated the generous amount of crab in the dish.  4.5/5\n+ Maine lobster broth: VERY flavorful, each spoonful is packed full of seafood fragrance.  It's simply a broth without anything else in it, and it is strong and savory.  I really enjoyed it, although I would question getting it again because it's not very substantial.  If you like seafood flavor though, get this. 4/5\n+ Foie gras: Damn, this was delicious.  Fatty, fragrant, HUGE piece, and the berry sauce and brioche were perfect complements. A highlight of our meal. 5/5\n+ Veal sweetbreads: This was my favorite dish.  Also, whoever decided to call \"various animal organs\" sweetbreads deserves a prize; what a sneaky way to make animal parts sound appetizing.  And really, appetizing it was!  The sweetbreads (Am I saying it right? Just call it sweetbreads?) tasted like tender chicken, and on top of the gravy, mashed potatoes, and mushroom fricassee (fancy term for any stewed dish with meat and gravy), it was an amazing combination of ingredients, flavors, and textures.  Not to mention, the portion was very generous. Get it. 5/5\n+ Duck breast: I loved the salad that came alongside this dish, which included bacon bits.  The duck, however, was mediocre.  It was cooked medium, though we asked for medium-rare, and maybe it was because we had this right after the amazing sweetbreads, but it was just alright.  I'd skip it next time. 3.5/5\n+ Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato: I am not a dessert person. I am not a chocolate person.  I did not particularly care for this item. My foodmates, who ARE dessert and chocolate people, also didn't think too highly of this dish, so I don't think it's just me. 3/5. \n\nI was worried that a tapas-style meal = not enough food, but their portions are decently-sized and, for some dishes, pretty big.  For the three of us, five dishes left us filled and satisfied, without being too stuffed.  Plus, I think the endless bread helped too.\n\nFood also came quickly, and great timing with each new dish coming at a good rate after the one before.  Servers were just the right amount of attentive and helpful.\n\nThe food, overall, was very delicious and I really did enjoy every dish.  The final bill, for three drinks and five dishes and a dessert, came out to $112 after tax.  \n\nDefinitely a nicer and more expensive option for dinner, but worth it for a special occasion because the ambiance is cozy and nice (candles, dark lighting, etc.), service is fine, and most importantly, the food hits the spot.

I'm adding a star for the follow-up and because the stomach really liked Isa, even if the back and eardrums didn't.\n\n-------------\n\nHow does a Beard award winning chef create a restaurant where I did not enjoy my meal? Come to Isa and find out firsthand.\n\nThe food is very good, if not quite at a Michelin level. Most of our dishes featured exceedingly fresh seafood. I found a few of the dishes oversalted, though happily for a French-inspired menu they were not too buttery. Isa makes very good use of very fresh ingredients, even if no dish stuck out as exceptional or unique.\n\nMy problem was the seating in the patio area, which is a disaster. I could hardly hear the person next to me, and for others at the table I did not even know if they were speaking. This covered patio amplified every comment, laugh, clink, and baby's cry into a painful cacophony. The chairs are perhaps the least comfortable patio furniture I have ever sat in, and I had to stand up several times because the seat was so bad. At first a heat lamp was broiling me, then later another guest turned it down and I found myself chilly.\n\nIsa bills itself as a shared-plates restaurant. For the uninitiated, \"tapas\" is Spanish for \"food that is served to the table, but is inconvenient for sharing\". Sure enough, Isa entrees are entrees and will mostly be destroyed by serving a portion to everyone at the table. To be fair, I've seen worse -- and this is more a personal peeve than a knock on Isa for following the tapas trend.\n\nBottom line: Eat in the restaurant and have a four- or five-star experience. Eat outside and take your chances. And I suggest you share appetizers only, and choose your own entree.", "author": "Stephen F."}

They normally have a $30 prix fix menu on Sunday-Thursdays with pretty much all the same offered dishes.\n\nI took off a star (sorry!) not because of anything terrible, but because I wasn't really wowed by any aspect during my most recent visit.  I still stand by my first review but I have 3 things to add:\n\n1) Looks like they don't have a liquor license here.  They only have a very limited list of unimaginative soju cocktails.\n\n2) They also insist that you share your food here.  Like REALLY REALLY insist.  I'm guessing this way there's less pressure to have your food come out all at the same time.\n\n3) To add to my recommended dishes from my first review, the salmon carpaccio with the crostini was excellent.  The duck breast entree also gives you more duck than what most restaurants will serve.\n\nThe atmosphere is still great, and they seem really accommodating for larger groups.  I'd still recommend this for a nice birthday venue if you're planning to go out in the Marina afterwards, but buy cocktails somewhere else.", "author": "S L."}

Typically with all of the French food encounters I've had in the past I was led to believe I wasn't much of a fan.  But Isa proved me wrong!  Since this place is rated $$$ I expected teeny tiny dishes, but they were actually decently proportioned.  Not too little and not too much.  There was five of us girls dining and I would say the only complaint that I have is our waiter told us their recommendation is for each person to choose a appetizer and a main dish which we followed and was left with too much food.  Not that it's much of a complaint since they were all delicious. :)  I would recommend the crab salad, and squid as they were both really good appetizers.  Bon Appetite!", "author": "Brenda L."}

The music and atmosphere are what drew eventually drew us in as the preference over other spots in the area.  Kind of a weird thing to note, but the acoustics seem to be really great here - at first I thought there was a live jazz group or something inside.\n\nWasn't at all impressed with the \"back patio.\"  It was as much a patio as the garden center at Home Depot. Completely enclosed with heat lamps, it smelled weird, was kind of cheesily decorated, and was certainly not what we had in mind when the offered it.\n\nWe ordered one 2 course prix fixe and one 3 course.  The portions are so generous here I would actually recommend just doing 2 courses a piece!  We split everything: the calamari (delicious), and mussels (delicious), the yellowtail (delicious), the herb-stuffed chicken (delicious, says the bf), and topped it all off with the cookies (mmmmm delicious!).  Pair that with 2 happy hour cocktails at 5 bux a piece, and we were absolutely stuffed.\n\nThe bread was also outstanding.  I saw the long baguettes resting in a wire rack near the kitchen, which resulted in crusty, warm, super-scrumptious bread.\n\nAll in all, we had a great experience.  I'd recommend to others, and will likely be back ourselves.  Cheers!", "author": "Allison B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-08", "description": "How can this place have 610 reviews and be completely empty?  Do people try this place once and move on to bigger and better things?  Maybe they just couldn't find it?  I didn't see it right away amidst all the scaffolding and loudly decorated windows of nearby eateries.  It really is  a shame.\n\nMy friend took me here for my birthday dinner.  It was 5:30 on a Monday night, so I wasn't surprised the place was completely empty.  Sadly, the place was just as empty when we left the restaurant around 7 pm.  Don't get me wrong, people pay good money for private dining, so I really shouldn't complain.\n\nIsa is a tiny French/Continental restaurant tucked away in the heart of Cow Hollow.  It's a narrow space with a few small tables and a patio in the back.  The decor accentuates the romantic aspect (read: cozy, simple and dark).\n\nOur server (also our busboy and our host) seemed to disappear into the darkness and reappear only when he was needed.  If you want to have a quiet conversation with a friend without being interrupted, it's what I call \"perfect service.\"  I wouldn't call our server particularly knowledgeable, but his timing was perfect.\n\nI went for the $28 prix fixe, which is a pretty amazing value for a fine French meal.  I started with baked goat cheese . . .  Why have a salad when you can get something fatty as your appetizer?  That's my motto.  The goat cheese was served in a pool of oil with tomatoes, pesto and pine nuts.  The goat cheese was really good, but I could have done without all that oil.  \n\nFor my second course, I ordered the angus steak with potatoes.  The steak, of course, was very small, but I expected that.  It was perfectly prepared and incredibly soft and juicy.  The waiter asked me \"is medium rare OK?\" when taking my order.  Since I order all my steaks medium rare, I was pretty excited.  The potatoes were very similar to au gratin (although they were called something else), and I love au gratin potatoes.  These were baked perfectly, although they needed just a pinch of salt.\n\nThe third course was dessert, and I went for Semifreddo all' Amaretto.  I arrived at Semifreddo by process of elimination: there were 4 desserts available to me, but two of them were cheeses and one of them was a grapefruit something-or-other.  Since my meal started with a cheese course, I felt like it needed to end differently.  Grapefruit is a big no-no in my book, so . . . Semifreddo it is.  Semifreddo, I believe, means \"half cold\" in Italian.  It was a serving of cold whipped cream with Amaretto liqueur and almonds.  So many almonds!  The taste of almonds, mixed with the taste of Amaretto, was a bit overwhelming.  I ate 2 of the 3 mini-biscotti decorating the plate, too.  It was a nice way to end the meal.\n\nWhile the food at Isa is neither outstanding nor particularly original, there is something to be said for great value.  $28 at Isa goes a long way towards impressing your date or your parents.  If I had to break it down, I'd say 5 stars for the value and 3 stars for the food.", "author": "Yan G."}

This is a great place for large parties, as the food is reasonably priced and can be somewhat dressy or not. so everybody can feel comfortable coming here whether you are in jeans or cocktail dress. \n\nMy husband and I shared four appetizers and two entrees. \n- salmon capaccio: I thought the salmon would be really thin, but it's actually on the thick side. it was delicious though. \n- asparagus soup: this was disappointing, not too much flavor\n- foie gras: my husband thought it was just a little bit cold in the center. I thought it was just excellent. good portion and good flavor. it wasn't the best I've had, but this isn't one of those really expensive French place. I guess it could've been more tender. they are doing a \"good bye to foie gras\" deal, for $15. it's a great deal, makes me want to go back there before I have to say good bye to it. \n- some sort of salad: I forgot which one, but it was good. \n- lamb chop: the waiter asked me if we wanted 4 chops to share instead of the 3 chops that normally came with the dish. I said just 3 would be fine, since it's my husband's dish and I just wanted a bite. but when the dish came, with the large group and some people getting 4 chops, there was a extra 4 chops dish and we ended up with it. We didn't know we had to pay extra for the extra chop. oh, well, I just wish it didn't work out that way. Otherwise the lamb chop was good. \n- potato wrapped seabass: I was deciding between that and the fish of the day. I'm glad I picked the seabass. I like the crispy potato contrasting with the soft texture of the seabass and it was cooked just right.\n- creme brulee: very good, lots of vanilla beans and excellent sugary crust on top. \n\nOur friends also got the crab salad, which they said was really good. I also tried the mushroom risotto and pasta from other people's dish, the risotto was great and the past was just ok.  There was happy hr on the drinks on a saturday, which was awesome. I'm pregnant, so it's sad I can't have any. \n\nOh, yes, my husband and I ordered a lot of food and we ate it all. I was very full at 8 months pregnant. so I would order less food normally. I would say one appetizer, one entree and one dessert per person is enough. If you have a large group, you should definitely share appetizers as there are so many good ones to try. \n\nWe were told that we had to be kicked out by 9:00 pm, but we ended up staying until 10. We weren't asked to leave. We had a lot of credit cards, but the restaurant only let us use 2 cards. We negotiated with them to use 3, which they agreed. just FYI, bring some cash with large groups.", "author": "Cicie W."}

You would think after two weeks, it wouldnt be so busy, but it still was! Came in at 7 and was told there is nothing available for the rest of the night.  Good thing I had made reservations at 9 for 4 just in case some other friends joined us.\n\nThe menu items that was being offered at the restaurant was not what was posted prior before on the website, so that was a little disappointing. Both of us ordered off the DAT menu. For appetizers, we got the salmon carpaccio and grilled calamari. For entrees, we got the lobster bouillabaisse and flat iron steak. And for dessert, some cheese thing with walnuts and creme brulee. The salmon was just plain smoked salmon with a few capers and a lemony-egg sauce dripped around. With the calamari, I prefer it battered and fried with dipping sauce.  The lobster stew was pretty good, came with a lot of different types of seafood and was warm and hearty. The steak came sliced already and was perfectly cooked and tender, but I wasn't a big fan of the sauce.  It was too heavy on the cognac taste. I thought the cheese was so gross, and just a slab of cheese with a few honey walnuts did not seem to be a whole course worthy. The creme brulee was simple but good.\n\nI really liked the setting of the restaurant, with the backyard tent with heaters and garlands for round lights.

It's a little misleading as the portions are neither large enough to feed a family nor budget-friendly.  The suggestion is to order double of every dish to ensure there's enough to go around.  Too often this means you're tricked into ordering more than necessary.  In this case, there WAS enough food to feed a small militia (or at least six very hungry people), but I didn't mind as everything was good to very good.\n\nSalmon Carpaccio: I had carpaccio only once before and thought it just wasn't my thing.  This carpaccio proved me wrong--it was cool and fresh, and the creme fraiche was smooth and provided great flavor. Atop the crunchy crostini, this was the perfect bite.\n\nGrilled Calamari: Overly salty and just a little plain, this was the weakest dish of the night.  But I liked the beans, and overall it really wasn't that bad.\n\nLaura Chenel Goat Cheese: A bit heavy and the flavor was too strong for my liking, but it tasted better with bread.  My coworkers are big goat cheese fans, and they liked this appetizer a lot.  \n\nNorthern Halibut a la Plancha: The fish was well-cooked but rather forgettable flavor-wise.  I liked the beets, which soaked up the tangy vinaigrette rather nicely.\n\nMaple Leaf Farm Duck Breast: After reading the Yelp reviews, I was adamant to forgo the prix fixe for this entree.  I love duck, and this one was fatty and delicious. The crunchiness of the (fried?) arugula provided nice textural contrast.\n\nGrilled Golden Gate Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak: My least favorite entree of the meal, probably because of the mustard greens in the sauce, which overpowered the meat.\n\nTruffle Risotto: Truffles, where have you been all my life?  How could I have gone this long without sampling your savory earthiness?  I practically inhaled this dish and greedily picked out all the remaining truffles when no one was looking.  Hands down favorite of the night.\n\nPan Roasted Rocky Jr. Range Chicken: The first piece of chicken I tried was juicy and tasty, but the rest of the bird (i.e. the breast) was a little dry. Not exactly mind-blowing.\n\nAfter the satisfying deliciousness of the appetizers and entrees, we were honestly too full to enjoy stuffing ourselves further.  It was for the best, as the desserts were a rather underwhelming denouement.  The Bucherondin De Chevre (aged goat cheese with honey) was just okay but far better than the Roaring Forties, which tasted like how my brother's foot smells (seriously).  No one much cared for the grapefruit granite, which had a very pure, sour grapefruit flavor.  The semifreddo all' amaretto was soft and delicious and tasted just like biscotti, but I wouldn't go out of the way to order it.\n\nOverall, the savory dishes were tasty, with a few high notes. Isa restaurant offers quality food, attentive service, and an enjoyable dining experience.  Despite the $$$, this restaurant is worth a try if you're in the area and looking for a good place to take a date, close friends, or even coworkers.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

I should have known because that's always the case in the Marina/Cow Hollow area but the hostess was very nice and sat us right away in the patio area which was very cute and warm.   Although, the service was sometimes on the slow side (they were very busy that night), I felt that they were still very attentive - I never had to ask for more water or bread or wine - they came by just on time. Food was served family style so I got to try everything.\n\nSo for the DAT, it was ~$35 for 3 courses.  \nHere's what we had.\nDungeness crab salad w avocado, apple, grapefruit and tarragon:  very fresh and very tasty.  Everything went surprisingly well together.\n\nWild prawns w parsley, garlic and lemon:  very succulent and tasty - one of my faves...\n\nSeared scallops w/ butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach and bacon:   The butternut squash was a nice surprise to this dish.  The scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  My only complaint would be that there were only 3 pieces of scallops.\n\nFlat iron steak with zucchini, polenta cake, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce:  this was probably my least favorite of the dishes.  It was good but somehow, they didn't go together from my perspective.  The polenta cake was great however - I'm not really into polenta but this was very tasty.  Meat was not tender.\n\nVanilla bean gelato with biscotti:   the vanilla bean gelato was very creamy\nFlourless Chocolate cake with ice cream- cake melted in your mouth and it went well with the ice cream\n\nGinger and Blackberry cocktail - very refreshing \n\nOverall, it was a wonderful dining experience.", "author": "glen o."}

They're DAT menu is very much like their regular menu, just plus and minus a few dishes, great selection overall. \nThe food is good, but didn't wow me away. Using LP's words, if we're in the neighbor then we'd maybe come back cuz we know the food's good, but we probably won't be driving out there specifically for the restaurant again. \n\nThe atmosphere was really nice, but dark. It's like a great dating spot. But for us old married couple (haha) it's a little too dark since we can't see what we're eating. The back patio is warm and closed-up in the winter, so it was pretty nice. The space is small, but cozy. The servers worked as a team and were so nice and welcoming. \n\nFor apps, we had the crab salad and sauteed shrimps. The crab salad was plentiful, and very nicely balanced. It's a great light app to share. The downside is we found a small piece of crab shell in there. That was not fun when it was dark and we couldn't see what we were chewing on. The sauteed shrimp was decent, but a bit too fattening with all that butter. I mean, I can make sauteed shrimp, and it doesn't need to have that much butter. We can taste the freshness of the shrimp though. Oh yeah, the bread for the table was good. Crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the right crunch, not too hard not too chewy. \n\nFor entrees, we had the flat iron steak and the seared scallops. What I can remember is both dishes were on the oily side. The steak was pretty tasty for a cut of meat that's not the best. I liked how it was grilled nicely, medium rare. The polenta cake and the sauces were nice too. The seared scallops were on the small side, there were 5 of them surrounding a plop of veggies. Again, oily veggies. I know there's bacon and all, but really, cut down the butter/oil a bit would be nice. Good taste though, only I can't seem to make out the truffle in the sauce. \n\nAh desserts. This is the climax of the meal. The flourless chocolate cake was lite a souffle, not overly sweet, it went so well with the vanilla gelato. Oh and the semifreddo all'amaretto, mmmm. Dessert is the reason for me to dine out, and this did not disappoint.", "author": "Lisa Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-17", "description": "This was a tough one to sit through.  Heard about a service called Savored, which seemed like a good idea.  30% off your bill at ISA was reasonable... you aren't gouging the restaurant like a Groupon can, yet you still get to lower the price point to try it out.  We came around 6 for our reso, and were promptly seated at the table next to the door.  Next to another couple using savored.  The restaurant was empty, yet they still wouldn't move us anywhere else upon request.  Seemed quite odd, but I can get over this.  \n\nThe part that was hard to stomach was our waiter.  He was horrendous from start to finish.  Didn't ask us at one point during the entire service if our food was good, gave no recommendations when we asked, forgot a course we ordered, and also never asked us if we wanted another drink after we finished our first.  The busser was nice, and the GM or another lady who started coming by towards the end were also very nice.  Unfortunately it was still far from salvaging the experience.  Probably a 4 star experience for the food, brought down to a 2 by Mr. Friendly Server.  Note to Mr. Friendly Server: I get it, you are unhappy that our bill will be less than full price.  Welcome to SF where Groupons, Scoutmobs, and Living Socials are all acceptable as forms of payment.  Tell your management to put you in another section so I can leave a 30% tip to someone who actually cares, and I can enjoy your restaurant how it is supposed to be enjoyed.", "author": "William B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-03", "description": "First off, the food quality is definitely 5 star worthy. Their marketing tricks and lack of management from management staff cost them all the negative points. Long story short. Special offer from their customer e mail that we were in. Prefix menu 3 things, 29.99 reservation only. Pretty simple right? When you are seated it's pretty normal, your given the menu, water and bread, and give you a few minutes with the 2 page menu. No introduction to the menu,Now here is the catch. BOTH pages of the menu clearly say \"prefix menu 3 for 29.99 Sunday thru Thursday \" on the top. Plain and simple. Not please see page 2, please ask server for details, nada. So it's a safe assumption to make that the prices next to the items are for people who want just one item, or two, but not the 3 for 29.99 thing.  One menu is full length, the second is shorter. So without any formal explanation from staff, you go by what's printed on the menu. So long story short, dinner tastes awesome, service was ok, waiter seemed tired, but when we got our bill of $200+ we asked the waiter why it was seperate items, he said it was wrong and he said he will get it corrected. Manager Indian  lady comes over , says you didn't order prefix. I say, how did we not, what's the very top of the menu say?? she says prefix 3 for 29.99. I go ok, how did we not. She goes, the second menu is for prefix, I ask what's the difference, they both say prefix on the very first sentence. She goes, this menu is to let you KNOW that we have a prefix menu, so I say then shouldn't the menu say, please see OTHER menu??? She goes this menu has ala carte prices, I go yes it does, for people who dont want 3 items, but above that it says 3 for 29.99. She goes well thank you for your criticism, we will take it into consideration. WHAT?!?! It's not criticism, I'm complaining that your menu is deceiving and the pricing is misrepresented and you just acknowledge it and didn't do anything about it.", "author": "Andrew J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-06", "description": "Last Saturday, I found myself in the Marina District for dinner with no inclination and no idea what we wanted. We saw the atmosphere of Isa and the menu outside and were automatically intrigued. It was 7 o'clock and we managed to get a table for two without reservations. Sweet.\n\nI would say we were seated quickly but in retrospect, we were seated briskly by a slightly abrasive waiter. He handed our menus to us and informed us that this restaurant is designed to be family style, dishes are meant to be shared and things come out as they are prepared and ready without any particular order. Okay, I can deal with that. I can also deal with the darkness of the restaurant and the fact that our waiter is pacing back and forth like a panther. I can deal with that.\n\nThe evening started out fine. We started with the prawns (a bit overcooked, but with a fantastic sauce and not terrible) and a very nice bottle of sauvignon blanc (don't remember the vintage as I was not the one who ordered it). However, it was poured quite poorly.\n\nAnd then I realized how terrible the layout of the restaurant was because a couple was seated at a table practically on top of us. The two 2-tops were separated by maybe 5 inches of space. It felt like we were on a double date at a classless rectangular 4-top. I get a bit uncomfortable with crowds and people, I have a difficult time speaking freely, this was not good for my date. Our waiter continues pacing back and forth like a panther, clearing plates in a speedy fashion that made me a little uncomfortable.\n\n1 glass of wine later, problem solved and everyone can talk freely. I notice our waiter less, I notice my companion more, and our scallop course arrives (we were both in the mood for seafood that night). Scallops came with a truffle sauce with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The sauce and the asparagus were both fantastic with the perfect texture, but I thought the mashed potatoes were too creamy with a texture that detracted from the dish as a whole rather than added to it. And the scallops were small though flavorful, if we're looking for a cloud with a silver lining.\n\nNow that we want a refill of our wine, we have to pour our own glasses. I can understand pouring our own water, but our own wine...? Really? \n\nNow I wanted to order the lamb initially but we ended up getting the halibut special instead. I am very glad we did this. The flavors were spot on (coriander, nutmeg, allspice to give a very earthy flavor to this fish). It was cooked properly and served with string beans. Everything was perfect about this dish. \n\nPour our own wine. A different, more experienced waiter comes by to clear plates and recommend the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. He jokes, we laugh and we forget about our tiger-esque waiter prowling by the hostess station. \n\nWe order the cake and double espressos. Our espressos arrive easily 6 minutes before our dessert (they were okay, but not the best). However, the dessert was absolutely fantastic with a wonderfully light texture (much closer to a souffle than any cake). \n\nOverall, we had a wonderful evening. The food ranged from good to great, but the service and layout of the restaurant totally killed our dining experience. I would come back with reservations in a different section (perhaps on the back patio) but not for quite some time...", "author": "Stephanie H."}

I'll complain first. I left it for ze boyfriend to make the reservations. He calls earlier in the week, but the person told him not to worry about it and call back Thursday and they would still be able to accommodate the party of 13. He calls back Wednesday just to be sure, and.. sure enough.. It was too late. Original plan of having it at 8pm vanished because of that bozo. The lady ze bf talked to tried to make it better by offering a 9pm slot. say what??? people will starve by then. at this point, i was peeved and steam was coming out of my ears, but fine, 9pm it is because i really loved it the last time. the next day, the lady calls back saying they can bump us up to 8:45!!! WOO HOO!! 15 minutes! at least they really put that effort into trying to get us in earlier.\n\nThe servers and staff were all very friendly and helpful. He helped pick out a very delicious wine. the Long Gamma. definitely beat the Vinho Verde. Onto the food.\n\nFor the size of our group, we ordered double of everything. And here goes: \n- Organic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio - served with crostini. still amazing. not fishy, refreshing from the lemon, order it.\n- Yellowfin tuna - actually more fabulous than the salmon carpaccio! i love the bit of kick from the sriracha, and the avocado adds an extra creaminess. Order this!\n- Grilled local calamari - not my cup of tea, but my friends were practically fighting over the last pieces.\n- Simply saute\u00e9d Sea of cortez wild prawns - simple but extraordinary. the lemon, garlicky butter is like having a bite of heaven. \n- Hudson valley grade A foie gras - still haven't mustered up the stomach for it, but it smells awesome, and everyone melted down their chairs when they bit into this.\n- Potato wrapped Seabass - AWESOME. that's it.\n- Truffle risotto - soooo creamy!!! i loved it!!! \n- Roasted rack of lamb - don't touch the stuff, but the friends that did eat it lOOOOOVed it. said it wasn't gamey (which makes me not like it) and it was roasted to perfection.\n- Maple leaf farm duck breast - still can't go wrong with this mother.\n- Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak - buttery meatiness.\n- Brussels Sprouts with garlic, bacon & extra virgin olive oil - mm.. not buttery enough, but they were cooked to tenderness. \n\n\n$57 per person for all that food and 3 bottles of wine, plus endless amount of cocktails, and 2 desserts, that ain't bad at ALL!

The restaurant is family style tapas and ordering about 2 dishes a person is more than enough.  The modern ambiance is great for dates, but Isa's also good for groups around 4 to 6 people (make a reservation) so you can try a lot of the dishes and get more than just a tiny bite of each.  I've always sat in the back patio lined with stringed lights which seems a little more casual than the front section.\n\nThe ingredients are super fresh and Isa really brings out great flavors in each of their dishes.  My favorites are the seafood dishes, though I've tried many of the other ones and can't think of a single one I didn't like.  Here are my selected favorites:\n\nLittle Skookum Oysters - so fresh and the sauce goes great with them\nDungeness Crab Salad - I'm a bit of a sucker for crab and even more so when there's no work involved in getting the meat out of the shell.  This salad is light, citrusy and refreshing.\nScallops - perfectly cooked, a bit on the small side\nShellfish risotto - creamy, and the prawns are great\n\nFor dessert, the creme brulee is delicious.  It's in a bit of a wider ramekin which means more caramelized sugar to break!  The custard base is the perfect richness and texture.\n\nOverall, it's a fabulous, fresh, French restaurant.

After I made my review for this restaurant, Kitty and Luke proceeded to harrass me about when I went, my name, so that they could look up my receipt back in December, etc.  They proceeded to leave very condescending comments about how I was a cheap tipper, etc. on my page.  I felt so humiliated that I took my review down.  \n\nThen, I came across an old high school friend's page, Jennifer H.  and she had received the same harrassment that I had!  So this got me riled up again.  \n\nBeware.  If you write bad things about this restaurant, they will be riding your ass until you take down that review.  \n\nI can't wait to hear the derogatory things this business owner has to say about me now!  \n\nTo say the least, this is not good customer service.  My advice: don't be so condescending and rude when you respond to your customers.  I was willing to give this restaurant another chance before, but after all of this bad aura coming from this restaurant, I will never return and will definitely not recommend this restaurant to any friends/family.\n\nOh yeah, and after the server demanded more tip from us, my obliging plus one left more tip even though I told him not to since the service was foul.

The Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato was also very delicious and seemed to be made with a hint of rum which added to its appeal. The ambiance is warm and lively and there is a diverse mix of of diners here that's not typical of most restaurants in the Marina (i.e., not everyone is a Yuppie!).\n\nThe bad: Maple Leaf Duck Breast with Wild Huckleberry sauce. I thought my duck was way undercooked, a bit too fatty, and lacked sufficient seasoning. I also felt the sauce was far too sweet and didn't complement the duck very well. I also felt portions were on the smaller side, but I guess that's typical of most French restaurants. Finally, I didn't think it was cool that we weren't seated until 40 minutes after our reservation time.\n\nThe ugly: Horrible service. Our waiter catered to the adjacent group's every whim, while leaving our table virtually unattended. In fact, while he was making multiple visits to the table next to us, he basically ignored my group until he brought out the bill 2 hours later. He event sent a bus boy to take our order. What the eff?! But it didn't end there. He went on to bring out the wrong desserts to my friends and me, and even ended up overcharging us by about $60. When we told him about the billing error, he apologized and brought out the \"correct\" bill--which was still wrong! Finally, 2 attempts later, he brought us an accurate bill. Maybe if you spent more time talking to us and actually being the one to take our orders you wouldn't have fucked up the first and second times! God, what horrible service.\n\nOverall, my dining experience was just okay. I was looking forward to Isa after reading a number of glorious reviews, but was a bit disappointed with the service and my main course. I don't think I'll come back for round two.

For me, Portland's now closed Scarlet Begonia is where I first tried and was immediately turned off foie grois. And Isa .. oh Isa .. is the remarkable restaurant that turned me back ON to it! I LOVE their seared foie grois! I am so thankful that (1) my date brought me here, and (2) he convinced me to give foie grois another chance. For that, I am forever grateful. :)\n\nAmong other notable culinary delights were the parchment paper steamed butterfish (I figuratively died and entered fish heaven .. it was cooked to perfection ... like butter, it seemed to melt in my mouth!) and a couple other tapas-style dishes (they were quite delicious, but my mind was still so hazy from the foie grois and butterfish, I have completely forgotten what else we ordered!).\n\nThe ambiance is perfect for an intimate date, or a small gathering of friends.

Here's what I remember:\n\nThe food:\n\nWe tried a salad (maybe the arugula salad, I don't really remember), the foie gras (which they are known for), the potato wrapped sea bass (also one of their reputed dishes), the rack of lamb and a pork chop special.\n\nI hardly remember the salad, so that's all of the review that it needs.  \n\nThe foie gras is one of their most popular and talked about dishes.  It was definitely good.  However, I have to disclaim that it is the only foie gras I have ever tried, so I don't have much to compare it to.  Regardless, once I got past the initial disgust of how fatty foie gras is, being warm, sweet, and creamy, it was absolutely delicious.  \n\nI was surprised by the sea bass because it did not taste like fish, nor did it have the normal texture of fish.  The flavor was neutral and the texture was firm.  In fact, my friend who \"doesn't like seafood\" was enjoying it (he thought it was chicken) until I told him it was fish.  I was a little disappointed with it, though, because I didn't think it was very flavorful.  \n\nPork chops are one of my all time favorite foods.  The flavor of this one was good, but it was definitely over cooked and therefore dry and tough.  \n\nRack of lamb is one of my other all time favorite foods.  This one was mediocre and unremarkable.\n\nThe service:\n\nOur server was adorable (cute, smiley old man).  He definitely made me smile.  The service was as exactly as good service at a nice restaurant should be.  Nothing notable.\n\nThe ambiance:\n\nThe ambiance of Isa is really nice.  The inside is modern and the back patio is a nice garden setting.  My biggest complaint (which is a huge one to me and, unfortunately, is way too common in SF) is that it is very loud.  Like super, duper loud.  I could not hear my friend sitting across the table from me, but I could hear everybody else in the restaurant shouting at their company.\n\nOverall, Isa is definitely good, but I wasn't especially impressed, especially for how expensive it is and how high of reviews it gets.  I probably won't go back to Isa because, for the money, there are better restaurants.\n\nReservations are definitely necessary.\n\nWithout drinks, expect to spend roughly $50 a person.", "author": "Rachel M."}

They also constantly rotated waiters, so one would bring me replacement silverware.

Same when they took away a dirty fork, but forgot to replace it.  \n\nAs for the food - the foie gras was burnt, and not in the good way.  A big chunk of it was inedible, and the edible piece was actually separate from the main one as if they gave me a piece of someone else's.  \n\nThe one thing I did like was the $5 for a glass of wine - every day - from 5-7PM.

While the foie gras was still excellent, it was the duck that was less than spectacular.  Normally accompanied with crispy skin and served medium rare, the skin was soft and still moist and the breast itself was rare.  The main culprit here seems to be a still capable cook staff minus a true exec chef to keep them in line.  This was apparent while waiting for the bathroom and getting a good long look into the open kitchen.  A top notch kitchen minus at least one academy graduated chef is destined for failure.

Spectacular.\n\nWent on my birthday - champagne at the bar, then my finance and I were joined by another couple. We were there because of the guest sushi chef. \n\nI didn't know about the sharing dishes deal, but it worked wonderfully. We ordered the poke tuna appetizer and convinced my formerly vegetarian / sushi-virgin finance to try. Unfortunately, we've ruined her, because she will never have fish like that again -- it was stupendous! We were dumbfounded by the perfectly crafted flavors of this dish and the freshness of the fish. Our friends chose several sushi dishes at each one was outstanding and represented the best sushi any of us had tasted to date. Gorgeous tuna and salmon layered over a delicate, flavorful mix of things within each roll. No wasabi, soy or ginger needed. Though the ginger, which was literally slices of cured ginger, not the pink floppy things you're used to, was quite a treat to munch on.\n\nI decided on the prix fix choosing mussels and flank steak medium rare (maybe I'm a big jerk, but if you don't order steak medium rare, maybe you should just stick to chicken?). My finance did, in fact, order chicken, which was the meal's only failure - overcooked! The mussel dish was elaborate, to say the least. 30 of them, piled high. And the number of shells was not diminished by the size of each - they were all well appointed. The steak was divine and the potatoes au gratin were a cheesy top-browned slice of heaven.\n\nOnly slight draw-backs  -- no liquor -- only beer and wine (though I recommend drinking champagne straight through dinner if you like it). French wait staff has the cards stacked against them being in two categories often lambasted for their snootiness. But our waiter warmed up to us when he saw how much we were enjoying the meal. The other drawback can't entirely be said to be the fault of the restaurant, but they did let her in: a girl of not more than 15 who walked in and sat next to our table, wearing snowman-adorned pajamas and a Michigan t-shirt. She was with parents, or were they step-parents, who appeared not to notice.\n\nI guess if I'm fine with passing a plate of glorious steak and potatoes over the table to a friend in exchange for exquisite ahi tuna, I should be fine with pajamas.

They were all delicious. I especially loved the salmon tartare. The crostini was buttered and thin and the toppings complimented the salmon perfectly.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered Seared Dayboat scallops (with asparagus, potato pur\u00e9e & truffle jus de poulet), rilled creekstone natural flat iron steak (with potato dauphinoise & cognac-green peppercorn demi-glace), and duck breast (perfectly pan fried skin and hash browns over a spinach salad with currents and bacon). The winner was the duck breast, hands down. It was medium rare and oh so flavorful. The scallops were delicious, but small compared to the ones I had at Peasant and the Pear (Danville). The steak was also good, but my least favorite out of the three.\n\nDessert time! For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake and creme brulee. Both were so tasty. The flourless cake was so nice and fluffy, almost mousse-like. It was accompanied by a yummy vanilla bean gelato. The creme brulee was also good. I thought the sugar was a bit thick.

The butterfish I had was not too bad, but along with the truffle risotto, it was way too rich and repetitive. Both dishes had the same kinds of mushrooms. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place. We ended spending over $100 on a meal that was mostly disappointing.", "author": "Jade C."}

BIG mistake! \n\nLuckily, my friend suggested we try this place for DAT. We went with a group of six and we seated in the most adorable back \"room\". I say \"room\" because it was almost like it was an outdoor patio with strug lights, wood paneled walls, heat lamps, and foliage. It was almost a perfect setting for a first date. However, I was dining with 5 dudes, so the romantic atmosphere was non existent. :) \n\nWe were able to try almost every appetizer- the salmon carpaccio, persimmon salad, and mussels were delish. The calamari was a little chewy for my taste, but the flavors were very distinct. I had the petrale sole as my main dish- it was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was a little too rich for me. It was a butter sauce, but the fish was soak with butter. Tasty, yes....but it was a little overpowering at times. I had a piece of the flat iron steak- good flavors, but they recommend cooking it medium rare. I normally eat my steak that way, but this medium rare was still cold in the middle. We had it sent back to cook a little longer, so I would recommend ordering it medium. \n\nFor dessert I had the Grapefruit Granite- a dressed up Slushee. It was very refreshing, but the tartness of the grapefruit flavor was overpowering. The Semifreddo all'Amaretto was definitely my favorite of the night! It was absolutely delicious and I would come back just for that single dessert!", "author": "lauren j."}

If I were to have rated this restaurant the first time I ate there about a year ago, I would have given them 4 stars.  Last night they deserved 5.  It just exceeded my expectations being especially good last night.  I think I had three of the same dishes too (the chicken, scallops, and steak) but this time it was phenomenal!  \n\nI never typically order chicken when I eat out but this was one of the best I've ever tasted - incredibly juicy, crisp skin, fabulous sauce.  In fact, every single one of our sauces were amazing.  So good that all the girls at the table protested when the server tried to take away our plates - because they wanted to lick the plates clean.  The truffled sauce for the spaghetti was just unreal.  Foie had some kind of rhubarb-tasting sauce that went nicely.  The flat-iron steak, a delicious chimichurri, and the perfectly seared scallops over mashed potatoes and asparagus in a very good mushroom-y marsala.  Unfortunately, I didn't do the ordering so I didn't read the menu and I'm just speculating about the exact descriptions.  Proteins are accurate though, so order with confidence.\n\nThe only so-so dishes I'd say, were the two appetizers we had - a tuna tartar with crostini, some kind of sauteed shrimp, and the halibut.  I could have gone without.  We had plenty of food otherwise.  \n\nI have to say that we came to surprise a friend that had just gotten engaged, and her fiance had arranged for us to  be seated by 9pm with two bottles of champagne and appetizers ready for their arrival.  Unfortunately, we got bumped to 9:15 because another party came in, and we weren't at the table by the time the couple arrived.  So... kind of an anti-climatic surprise.  Normally it wouldn't really be a big deal, but this was our friend's one chance to do it.  An engagement - Come on!  That just kind of sucked that it didn't work out like he planned.  However, they definitely were gracious about their mistake and comped one of our bottles of champagne and an appetizer.  Exactly what I would expect from a professional establishment.

I wasn't WOW-ed by their food; I'd say that the salmon carpaccio and truffle risotto that I had from the DAT menu were good enough to give this place 3.5 stars.  What really ticked me off was the fact that they lost my reservation.  I had called 4 days in advance to change my reservation from 7 to 10 people and the hostess that I spoke to said, \"Umm, yeah sure, that should be fine.\"  I should HAVE asked for the name of that hostess because sure enough, when someone else from Isa called me the night before to confirm, they apparently hadn't received an update to my RSVP and told me that they wouldn't be able to accomodate 10 people at 6:00 pm.  WTF???  Seriously?  You're gonna tell me this the day before, when all the other DAT restaurants are completely booked by this time???  Mind boggling.\n\nI had to beg/convince the confirming hostess to fit us in somehow because I wasn't about to look for another restaurant at the last minute.  In the end, she had to push what was initially a 6:00 pm reservation to 5:30 pm, which is a wee bit early for a night out on the town.  So this debacle took away a half star.\n\nI took away another half star because the foie gras was half good, half bad.  We got what looked like two pieces in our order: one was perfect and the other one was tough and tasted like . . . well, liver.  Bleck!\n\nLuckily the company of our good friends made up for the dining disparities.  \n\nOh and Isa - PLEASE don't harass me like you harassed the other Yelpers who gave you negative reviews.", "author": "Vivian D."}

We were seated in the covered patio in the back. There were heating lamps, but it was still a bit chilly, so I kept my coat on for most of the meal. Waiters promptly brought out the (slightly toasted!) bread and promptly replaced it as soon as it was empty.\n\nFirst course: I had the Dungeness Crab Salad and it was SO good! All the flavors were well-balanced and fit together so well! My boyfriend got the Salmon Carpaccio. I had a bit of this, but I'm not a big fan of raw fish, so I didn't enjoy it quite as much. He loved how fresh it tasted though!\n\nSecond course: I had the Seared Scallops. This probably had to be my favorite dish of the night. The scallops were so delicious and tender and I wish there were more than 4 pieces! The potatoes and brussel sprouts that came with it were good too, and the sauce with the truffle oil was amazing. We were scooping up the sauce with the bread so that we could savor it more. My boyfriend got the duck breast, cooked to medium-rare. This was my first time having duck that wasn't prepared asian-style, but I wasn't disappointed! I never knew that duck could be so tender and work with these other flavors!\n\nThird course: I got the Semifreddo all'Amaretto, which was basically like a frozen almond custard with cookie bits in it. DELICIOUS! My boyfriend got the Grapefruit Granite, which I personally did not like (but only because I don't like grapefruit). He's a huge fan of grapefruit though, so he totally loved it.\n\nWe each ordered a drink with our meal. Boyfriend got the Zinfandel to pair with the duck breast. I normally don't like the strong taste of red wine, but I had a sip and it was pretty good! Very smooth (: I ordered the Number Seven soju cocktail. Was good, and finished off the meal nicely.\n\nWaiters were attentive and prompt! Overall, enjoyed my experience here and the overall ambiance was perfect!

Food is excellent - but the good part of the experience stops there. Menu proudly says \"family style, share plates,food comes out when it is cooked\" What this means is that when your small table is filled with the small plates that you stupidly thought were the first course, after five minutes the waiter arrives with the large plates you stupidly thought were the main course. Even tho your small plates are still piled hi with food, the waiter wants to remove them to move you on. Send the large plates  back, but know that they will just be kept warm, congealing, until your wisely get rid of your small plates. And, the large plates will arrive literally in under 60 seconds after the waiters have snatched your finally empty small plates. This lovely approach removes any need for the kitchen and waiters to try to time courses. In well under an hour, you can be in and out with this approach - just don't imagine that you have dined.", "author": "Henry A."}

Although the restaurant is classified as a French restaurant, I found the seafood options to be utterly outstanding.  I came as one of a party of four and sampled a wide variety of options that they offered as part of the Dine About Town promotion.  We were seated in the back patio area which was nice and bright (I detest dim restaurants).  Noise was not a problem in the area.  I have eaten at over ten restaurants that have participated in the DAT event, and Isa offers the widest selection of choices.  Many restaurants give just two options for each of the appetizer, entree, and dessert options (and some don't even give you a choice!) but there were more than four choices for each of the categories, which was great for our group size.\n\nOverall, the food was very flavorful, portions were generous, and simply delicious.  I really enjoyed the seared scallops, mussels, and dungeness crab salad.  The skirt steak was great as well and cooked to perfection at medium rare.  \n\nThe restaurant did fall short, in my opinion, with the duck in huckleberry sauce in that it was just too salty and I could not taste the huckleberries.  I am a huge duck fan, and was really looking forward to the dish, given the excellent quality of the food that we have been served thus far.  The beets on the side were wonderful and saved the dish, however.  \n\nThe desserts, too were very disappointing, but it could have been the selection that was offered the day.  The grapefruit granite was average at best, and the other desserts including the cheese offering just wasn't that tasty.\n\nService was good and friendly.  Because it was a busy night, the management kindly asked us if we could leave a little early, which was reasonable because we arrived a little late and they offered to compensate us with free wine at our next visit.  I look forward to coming back, and looking at their website, it looks like they routinely have a $28 pre-fixe menu.  \n\nOverall, I had a spectacular dining experience, and if the desserts just had not fallen short, I would have given them a 5 * rating.", "author": "Bowdoin S."}

But the last visit was SO bad, that I will never be returning to this restaurant again.  Here's the story:\n\nWe had a few friends in town for dinner, and he had heard about the restaurant so we decided to go.  He was very excited about the potato wrapped seabass all day, and so obviously ordered it for dinner.  After about 45 minutes, 3 of the 4 of us had received our meal, but he had not yet.  When he still did not have his dinner 20 minutes later, I finally waved down the waiter to ask about the status.  He went to check on it, returning saying \"I'm very sorry, I thought I put the order in, but I apparently didn't.\"  This was obviously frustrating, but we simply asked that he put the order in now, and we would share the other entrees until his arrived.  He then tells us \"it's TOO LATE, the kitchen won't take the order any longer.\"  After a long conversation about how ridiculous it was that a patron wasn't going to receive any dinner because of a mistake by the restaurant, I was able to get the manager over.  He continually offered me a bottle of champagne, which I continuously replied \"no thank you, my friend would like to eat dinner, not drink it.\"  The manager was extremely rude, and refused to do anything about the situation.\n\nNever have I been so amazed at the LACK of customer service and the major fact that my friend NEVER WAS SERVED HIS DINNER!  \n\nThe food may be good, but you actually have to receive it for this place to get any stars from me.", "author": "Danny K."}

The staff is very friendly, but they don't quite serve dishes the traditional way, which is to time things and make sure you're not overwhelmed. The other thing, not to be an a-hole, but I had to really focus in on what my waiter was saying. I know he can't help the accent, but the idea at that point would be to slow down then. None the less he gave us great service. \n\nAs far as the food it was excellent except for my Foie Gras. They had this blueberry sauce and blueberries on top. There was pear balls and the traditional piece of toast. They offered to pair the course with a sweet, almost desert like wine. It paired well together, but the dish itself didn't work out. The blueberries were overpowering and reminded me of getting blueberry pancakes. If they had put a glaze of some sort and greens, pears were ok, toast was great. The foie gras itself was cooked to perfection though, and it was a nice big fat piece. The rest of the dishes were great !

Excited to try french food, but didn't realize it was 'french-american' \n\nSo despite that confusion on my part our party of 6 enjoyed our dinner in the covered patio area. It was kinda crowded with lots of tables squished in the patio. \n\nThe only thing that stood out was the fois gras - duck liver. So supposedly the duck is forced fed with a tube stuck down its throat inorder to enlarge its liver. Inhumane? Yes. Tastes good? Absolutely, but super greasy! Please share it with 3-4 ppl at least, 1 -2 bites per person is enough. I tried it once in my life, and that is enough.\n\nWhat we ordered for the DAT:\n-The leek and potato soup was soooo watery! Bland bland bland.\n-The flank steak with sliced potatoes; my brother said it was bland. He's a chef and went to culinary school. I thought it was ok, but just ok. I think its the best bang for your buck through for the DAT.\n- The sole was pretty good, just underseasoned. A bit of salt would of helped.\n- Bread is crispy and yummy with butter and table salt. \n- Salmon carpaccio appetizer is pretty good, pretty much like sashimi.\n- chicken dish was sooo dry! \n- Truffle risotto was not to die for at all. It was nothing special. I would order the steak if I had to do it again. \n\nOur waiter was very informative..maybe too informative. Emphasized the 'greatness\" of their food dishes and how everything should be ordered family style. 2 dishes per person to be shared. The dishes are good enough for one person , of course you want to have taste tests with all the dishes. \n\nOne last thing: 5-7pm happy hour drinks $5 wine and liquor.

The flank steak, duck breast and truffle risotto are all delicious entrees but my favorite was definitely the duck breast.", "author": "Sophia L."}

To be fair, the cuisine is more French American fusion, you won't find escargot or cassoulet. But what they do offer is a very reasonable special. For $30, you get an appetizer, entree and dessert.

But I give an extra star for their honest & friendly staff!\n\n7 of us had dinner on Saturday night and my boyfriend left an iphone at the restaurant. Somehow they were able to trace back to one of our friends who made the reservation (via opentable) and called my friend that they found a phone that probably belonged to us. My boyfriend even didn't know he left his phone behind until the restaurant called our friend! I was very surprised that they would go for the extra mile to return the phone - most of the place just waited for you to pick it up...\n\nI love the family style - it allows us to taste all the delicious dishes. The spicy tuna, foie gras, and duck breasts are exceptional. The spicy tuna is not really spicy (just a kick to it); but it was a very refreshing starter. The foie gras is just, fabulous. Not only it's cooked properly, I was surprised by the serving size on the plate. =D \n\nDuck breasts is my best surprise - I just love every bite of from that plate! We also had other large plates, including the Bouillabaisse, rack of lamb, and beef short ribs (daily special). The Bouillabaisse was flavorful - the broth was perfect to dip the bread! We ordered 2 duck breasts and 2 rack of lamb (but with one cooked in medium and one in medium rare since one of our friend is pregnant). And they did it! The meat was cooked accordingly. The beef short ribs was no surprise (it's the typical beef short ribs raised in red wine). They tasted delicious but not enough to shock me :P\n\nI had the lemon drop soju cocktail - it was pretty good!! The only thing I have to pick on is the sugar rim - it could have done better. However, the cocktail was yummy! \n\nThe only disappointment is the dessert menu. The dessert menu served at Isa is simple and straightforward. I only wish to see more offerings though! \n\nI like how the restaurant has extended its dining room into a covered backyard. I feel like we are tucked away in the heart of a city.

I turned off my engine, opened my door, looked to my left........o yeah hot chicks. I smiled to them and they smiled back and off I went. I crossed the street and I was just around the corner from Isa when I saw a few friends standing outside just chatting. I walked up to to them and threw out my multiple affiliated gang signs informing them that I have arrived. Our reservations were supposed to be at 7:30 but we didn't get seated till 8ish which kind of sucked because I was hungry and I was pretty damn close to getting me a hot dog next door. But luckily, the hot dog place next door charged 8 bucks for a hot dog........I am NOT that hungry.............not for a hot dog that's going to cost me 8 bucks at least.\n\nOur waiter was a pretty cool guy and he was really helpful with our orders and he kept bringing us bread which is awesome because I love bread+butter. The food took a while but it was well worth the wait because most of the plates we ordered were delicious. I ordered the goat cheese and the chicken but I also tried most of my friends stuff that they ordered. I didn't really remember what the hell i ate but all of the dishes tasted fantastic. I took a bite of the goat cheese I had ordered and........\"wat the heck did i just ordered, pleh\"! (Okay I should of mentioned that I have never eaten goat cheese before until tonight.) I saw the bread, then I saw the goat cheese and a light bulb popped into my head. \n\n\"If Joey from Friends eat so much, how come he didn't get really fat\"? \n\nThat's not it. \n\n\"Goat cheese and bread......awesome\".\n\nI spread the goat cheese into my bread, took a bite and it was amazing. The goat cheese just matched the bread perfectly and it was like heaven in my mouth. I then tried the goat cheese by itself and it tasted wonderful this time, much much better then last time. I am a fan of goat cheese now, woohoo. Goats, better watch out because I am after your chee..........wait, that doesn't sound right and I don't think goat cheese comes from the Goat itself, whatever. Next was the chicken and it was just pure awesomeness. The chicken was not dry at all and had a full and juicy flavor to it. The mash potatoes was also amazing and it was creamy and had a perfect blend of flavors.\n\nOverall, this place is a wonderful place to dine at and I would come back here again. The price wasn't that bad either and it came out to $40 per person for so much food and so much FREAKING BREAD+BUTTER. I took 1 star away because of our reservations being delayed.

It also came with pieces of pink grapefruit. Very nice, loved the tuna. Then from the \"Nigiri sushi & Sashimi (one piece), I ordered 2 pieces of toro, $5.50 each, 2 pieces of sunazuri [yellowtail belly], $3.75 each, whose texture was marbled with thin lines of fat, and 1 piece of uni, $3.50. My friend had the same, except he substituted kanpachi, 3.75, for the uni. The toro and sunazuri were extremely buttery, and I loved them. The uni was just as good as it had been at Kabuto. I had wanted to order the sayori [pencil fish, aka a hemiramph, aka a halfbeak, aka needle fish], $3.75, but they were out [I had 8PM reservations!]. Everything was delicious, umai is the only word for it. Having ordered $34 worth of food, we decided to save room for dessert, though really, I could've eaten more sushi, but decided portion control was a good idea, and good for my wallet as well! During my meal, I had a Daiginjyo sake [50~60%; no more than 50% of the original size of the grain remains], an \"Osakayacyobei hyogu\" [Osakaya Choubei hyogu] - \"Japan, light & fruity, full bodied [sic] with a rich taste\", glass for $11. For dessert, I had a grapefruit granite [French for granita] for $5.50. This was a nice complement to the grapefruit I had earlier in the carpaccio, and it was very flavorful, clean, and refreshing.

He is CUTE! Haaay! What yo' name be is? What star sign you at? Luke, I am yo' daddy! \n\nApparently, Executive Chef Luke Sung is \"talented beyond his years.\" In what ways, aside from culinarily, one can only imagine. \n\nOkay, now that all sexual innuendo has been released, let us get down to the nittay grittay. The restaurant itself.\n\nReservations for 8:15 pm, half our party arrived around 8:25 - they didn't even blink. Nice. Sat the PROMPT half (ahem) at around 8:30, and when everyone was finally accounted for, we ordered around 9 pm. Meanwhile, there's yummy house bread (2 baskets for 5 people!) (yes, 2.5 of us were prompt, and 2.5 were tardy) (it is possible) with super smooth creamy butter on the side. Also, they sat us \"outside\" which is basically inside but with this heavy burlap canvas tent encasing us \"inside\" and they had those fire towers that give off A TON of heat. It was burning my neck so I asked the waiter to please turn it down, and he totally did. That was so nice. Thanks lover!\n\nHere are the dishes we ordered:\n\n      Dungeness Crab Salad\n      13\n\nThis is TINY. Like a tumor in a baby tiny. Like a roll of Scotch tape tiny. But it was GOOD. The crab meat were plump and juicy and the grapefruit/avocado bed the crab was laid in was velvety rich and creamy. WAY TOO SMALL FOR $13 THOUGH. \n\n      Maine Lobster Broth\n      6.5\n\nWe didn't order this but hot dang if I could not smell it the whole time from my neighbors' tables tantalyzingly teasing me with its curly scents of seafood and spice.\n\n      Prince Edward Island Black Mussels\n      9.5\n\nNothing special - basically like every other bowl of mussels at every other small plates place I have ever been to. TIP: DIP YOUR HOUSE BREAD IN THE SAUCE. IT'S HECKA GOOD! It's like eating a crumbly, wheaty mussel! Except it fills you up!\n\n      Seared Dayboat Scallops\n      15.5\n\nThis was so good. It was so good I'm going to bring out the Korean and say it was SOH good! The scallops were fat and flavorful although the potato puree was basically average, which is understandable as the scallops are the main act. BUT only four scallops, no matter how big, should NEVER ever ever be $15.50. Like, ever. Unless Executive Chef Luke Sung is hand-feeding it to me.\n\n      Saffron Paella \n      13\n\nThis paella made want to shout! Throw my hands up and shout! Kick my heels back and shout! Take my pants off and shout! I am a HUGE fan of paella, and Madonna strike me dead (and a pose) if this paella wasn't done right! It was covered on top with what I can only call a THICK CRUST of assorted seafood. It was like me and my gay roommates when we used to do Facial Nights! and smear thick smotherings of seaweed and coal gook all over our faces. Except in this case, the paella is my face and the prawns, mussels, calamari, peas & red peppers is my mask! Yum to the CORE. \n\n      Shitake & Oyster Mushroom Risotto\n      13.5\n\nThis was the homely, pale, sun-starved step-sister of the paella. Bland and way too creamy. I could hardly stand it!\n\n      Pan Roasted Chicken\n      15\n\nThe crispy skin was incredible - BUT crispy chicken skin is GOOD anywhere. KFC, Popeye's, my mama's, etc. That's why it's called CRISPY. Because CRISPY is a thesaurus word for GOOD. I knows! The meat itself was a little too tough for the fact that it was $15.00 for like 1/4 of a tiny chicken. I swear, fancy schmancy restaurants never do a good job with chicken. Why? I don't know - maybe they just can't go the simple route. Executive Chef Luke Sung probably flips through an issue of Real Simple while at the checkout stand and is completely boggled out of his mind.\n\n      Maple Leaf Duck Breast\n      16\n\nI can't even begin to describe the nastiness of this dish. In fact, let me instead let Beyonce and co. sum it up: \"You nasty, you trashy! You classless, girl! You sleazy, you freaky!\" I mean I don't know anything about no fancy place but is duck supposed to be raw the way it was? It was G.R.O.S.S., y'all. I tried to eat the cooked outer edge but the texture was like chewing on 3-day old gum you found under your BART seat - flavorless, tough, and utterly disgusting. I am sorry, Executive Chef Luke Sung, dreamlover of mine, but duck should not be raw!?!?!? Right??!?!? As a consolation, I think some girl in our group liked it, but really, it wasn't for me or basically everyone else in our party.\n\nThe worst part was that the raw duck was the last dish to come, so it was like going to a really awesome club where they played great music all night, and then end with a medley of Creed songs, starting with Arms With Open. WTH? Exactly! \n\nExecutive Chef Luke Sung gets 5 stars. The good food gets 5 stars, minus 1.5 for the pricey price, and 1 star for the nasty raw duck = 3.5 stars", "author": "Joshua L."}

From the moment that we sat down, Dean was the most genuine, helpful, friendly, exceptional server that I may have ever had. No joke. He was a large contributing factor to our pleasant experience. Since neither of us had been before, he guided us through the menu, the experience and the wine list. He helped us choose a rather nice Pinot Noir as he suggested it complements many of the flavors on the menu.\n\nWe tried the goat cheese, the flank iron steak, the spaghetti and a side of asparagus. The food was really tasty. You honestly can't go wrong with the goat cheese: baked to perfection with tomatoes, basil and pine nuts. The steak was topped with an herbed butter and served with haricot verts and small potatoes. Delish! The asparagus was cooked just right with shaves of parmegiano. The spaghetti was my least favorite of the dishes, but only because it was a bit forgettable. I can't tell you exactly what flavors were melded into the sauce, however, i still remember thinking it was still solid as it hit my lips.\n\nWe skipped dessert as we were stuffed, yet we weren't pressured to leave or hurry up.

I would bet a large pizza at North Beach Pizza that when you go to Isa it is because the ladeez suggested it or you are a ladee yourself.  Men do not like small plates because they're...well...small.  It's not a meal.  Guys do not need tasting menus, they need meals.  So, Isa started off on the wrong foot for me.  However, the food, what little there is of it, is excellent, so Isa redeemed itself.\n\nOur waiter was excellent.  He looked like a younger and thinner Rob Thomas.  This made me nervous because my girlfriend loves Rob Thomas...maybe more than she loves me.  He was very helpful with both menu selections and the wine selection.  (In stark contrast was a ridiculous phony on the wait staff.  He greeted what I can only assume was a regular customer by saying, \"So good to see you again.  You look beautiful.\"  She didn't look beautiful.  I won't say what she looked like.  This type of kissy face pandering should be punished by repeated shots to the ding dong.)\n\nWe went for a variety of starvation sized plates.  The goat cheese was excellent.  The hamachi was also very good.  I really, really enjoyed the risotto.  The butter fish was good.  Everyone else at the table was having orgasmic fits over how buttery it tasted.  I was a little more in control.  \n\nLike almost every other small plates restaurant, Isa is overpriced, but they can justify the price by the quality of the food.", "author": "Chris I."}

Actual restaurant a little small but opens up to a covered back \"patio\" with heat lamps.  \nOrdered: Maine lobster broth, Avocado crab salad, Mussels, Seared Hudson Valley foie gras, Seared scallops, Seafood paella, Spaghettini, Flat iron steak, Local mushrooms, and Brussel sprouts\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$190.00\n\nFor our extremely overdue get together, the besties and I decided to try Isa for some yummy-goodness.  I wasn't quite sure what to think as I had received some mixed reviews but I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe came in with a big appetite and went a little overboard in ordering.  We figured as a tapas place, we could easily finish all of our dishes however each dish turned out a little larger than we expected.  The lobster infused broth was nice starter - light and herby with two chunks of shellfish.  The avocado salad was crisp, refreshing, and contained generous portions of fresh crab meat - delish!  I nibbled on the mussels a bit - nothing special but I concede...it's likely because my attention was focused on the hudson valley foie gras that was delivered at the same time.  Wow.  I was pretty blown away by that dish.  It was rich, buttery, and perfectly delicate.  It paired well with the toasted brioche and fresh huckleberry.  The price point was great as well! This dish is a MUST order.  The girls and I fancied the scallops.  The mashed potato puree was nicely whipped and was a savory complement to the scallops and asparagus.  My girlfriends loved the seafood paella.  I, unfortunately, am not a fan of paella.  By the time our sides (mushrooms and brussel sprouts) and steak arrived, we were all pretty stuffed.  I really had to channel my inner t-rex to finish the flat iron.  We ordered the steak medium rare and it was very tender and nicely flavored with the chimchurri sauce.  Of our orders, I certainly recommend the foie gras, scallops, spaghettini, and flat iron steak.  \n\nWhen our bill arrived, we were all shocked at the incredible value.  Ten dishes plus gratuity...less than $200.  Service was quick and friendly.  All in all, I really liked the vibe of this place and genuinely enjoyed the food. A winner!", "author": "Jess C."}

I loved how the server recommended the bottles and really listened to our preferences to do so. We've been to other restaurants in the area \"known for their wine,\" and they've never been as helpful. Anyway, since it's family style plates, we all started off with a bowl of the asparagus soup. It was great. I've never has asparagus soup before, but it won't be the first and last time. After that, we ordered some warm brie cheese and calamari. The  cheese was delish and they said they calamari was too. For the entrees to share, we ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes, the truffle spaghetti, and the truffle risotto. Can you tell we are truffle fans?! The chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly. I could of eaten the whole plate myself. The truffle spaghetti and risotto were very tasty also. I usually stay away from risotto because I think it's so thick and boring, but not Isa'a risotto! I also could of eaten this entire dish myself. Although we had a WONDERFUL time with great company, my hubby and I joked afterwards that we can't wait to go back and each order at least two entrees and eat like pigs. We are really looking forward to bringing out of town guests to Isa. P.S. Reservations are a must. They were nice enough to squeeze us in at the last minute, but warned us that the table was only good for 2 hours. They meant it! Once 9:00 hit, they politely asked us if we'd indulge in dessert at the bar. We cooperated and sat in the seats they were saving for us. Although ideally we would of stayed where we were, they did squeeze us in and give us a fair warning. They definitely felt bad and gave us all a complimentary glass of Prosecco to go along with our creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

Writing an official, honest to goodness update to my review for Isa from 2006.  How many times have I been there now?  I've celebrated at least two birthdays, been there on first, second, and third dates, shared numerous bottles of wine with some of my most loved people - my best friends, my family.  Sat in the back patio, sat in the front, sat at the bar.  Oh the memories ... \n\nAnd now 2 years later, I take a moment to reflect.  just like how the restaurant was named after the chef/owner's little girl, we've all in grown up, seen a few changes, learned a few things over the years, made quite a few fond memories.  We've all changed up our menus, looked at things from a fresh perspective, had some ups, as well as some downs no doubt.  Found ourselves perhaps or at least continued to strive to do so.\n\nAnd for this, Isa has truly persisted to be, through the years, my favorite restaurant in the San Francisco.  No place feels quite so much like home yet dazzles  afresh every time.\n\nI will never stop ordering the baked butterfish and the butter lettuce salad (hmm... pattern?).  I will definitely start ordering the baked goat cheese and mussels.  And for you foie gras loving folks out there, you will be happy to know that my parents will probably continue to indulge in that dish without me.  And with 20 other amazing small plates on the menu, I know I won't be getting bored.\n\nPlus, Mondays through Thursdays are prix fixe nights!

I'm also a fan of their roasted chicken (I know it sounds boring but it most certainly isn't). \n\nWe were in a group of 5, which worked out well but I can imagine getting better service if you were in a smaller group.

The hostess was happy to accommodate us on a walk in basis on a THURSDAY night 745  seating!\n\nMy friends and I wanted to eat but wanted a lean and light meal with a few small plates.   I had bookmarked this on Yelp - and remember that it  was known for its small plates goodies.   It wasn't long before we arrived with other diners vying for seats.  My kudos to our gracious host who tried to seat everyone ASAP and having inspected her board and talk with the manager, we got our go signal- and got a table in the back tent.   With our libation mood still intact- we ordered a bottle of Pinot to start on these plates:- \n\nThe Saffron Paella was wonderful- it contained fresh juicy mussels, tender sweet prawns, and soft briny calamari deliciously buried in the saffron rice stew of peas and bell peppers- I would have preferred a little drier version- but this was a tasty alternative.\n\nThe Spicy Tuna Tartare was rendered in an Asian influence with a tangy sweet seasoning-sesame ginger wasabi taste.  I wasn't particularly attracted to the avocado compote with  edemame and pinenuts.\n\nThe Honey Spiced Grilled Calamari arrived on a bed of arugula and rice with lemon wedges.  It was wonderfully charred with just enough sweetness to compliment the sour lemon zest.\n\nPS- Get a table in the back - it was so much more cozier and the al fresca ambiance makes it a worthwhile dining experience.  This restaurant also makes My List of Paella destination in the city- \n\nThe Paella shall be judged on the following: 1) Rice: The delicate saffron and broth used to cook to rice- It was just a little too wet for my liking but rice was almost* mushy but compensated by rich taste.2) The Seafood/ Meat- Freshness and Variety - Isa met the fresh and quality  3)Overall- I would definitely order this again to see if it passes the next time ;-)  3.5/5 stars on this plate!", "author": "Arissa C."}

And it was divine!\n\nI made a reservation for two on OpenTable for 8:15 on a Friday night.  We got to the Marina at around 8, and surprisingly found parking in under 5 minutes.  We waited at the bar for our table for around 15-20 minutes, and proceeded to order some wine.  We were seated in the patio area in the back, and it was lovely.  Our server was very friendly and we ended up ordering 4 dishes to share.  I love the medium to smaller dish concept because it lets us try more things!  We had such a hard time deciding which dishes to try, but ultimately decided on butterfish, flat iron steak, paella, and special of the night: beef short ribs. \n\nThe butterfish came first, and it was baked in paper with mushrooms and truffle oil I believe.  It was very tender and the flavors pretty much worked wonderfully.  It was definitely one of my favorites.\n\nThe flat iron steak was topped off with some bleu cheese, to which I dont really like but the steak itself was delicious.  bf devoured it in five minutes flat.\n\nBraised short ribs was the super star of the night.... tender, juicy, perfectly cooked and paired with broccoli and mashed potatoes.\n\nSaffron paella was just okay.... I like my paella a little different and without edamame, so i could do without this dish in the future. tasty, but not memorable.  I'd go with risotto next time maybe.\n\nWe must sound like pigs but we literally finished off every plate and licked it clean.  They were smaller portions so I guess three would have been sufficient but I'm glad we ordered what we ordered....the experience was terrific. \n\nGreat ambiance, great service.  Nice wine list, and I'd say this is a great place for a nice Friday night dinner with friends or just your sig other. \n\nToo stuffed to try dessert, but will def return next time to try.\n\nIsa, youre now my favorite dining spot in the Marina! xoxo", "author": "Peggy W."}

But hot damn, the food at Isa is GOOOOD!!\n\nWe were late, naturally, but Isa was ready to seat us as soon as we arrived. Too bad they squeezed the four of us onto a two top! Sucky move on their part, but actually, I hardly noticed (maybe it was the booze). Ultimately, it didn't matter too much since we ate family style, but appropriate space would've been nice.\n\nThe tiny quarters make for a cozy dining experience. With the heat lamps and low lighting, this place is best suited for dates, but they can still handle medium to large groups. The waitstaff is attentive and take care of your needs without being intrusive.\n\nOnto the food! \n\nWe started with oysters, which were absolutely delicious. Perfect starter / amuse bouche. GET THEM.\n\nNext came a quick succession of appetizers, with each dish timed perfectly to arrive as we finished the previous one. The transition to entrees was seamless.\n\nCrab salad was really good, but small-ish. I'd get it again, but it's pretty expensive for its size.\n\nGrilled calamari was a nice change of pace from the typical breaded stuff, but got mixed reactions at our table. I thought the flavors were good, others were unimpressed. Be prepared for whole baby squid! (How else do you think they'd grill it? haha)\n\nDayboat scallops were OMFG TO DIE FOR GOOD! We devoured these, and I was tempted to order another plate just for myself. Easily the best dish of the night, hands down.\n\nBaked butterfish was tender and buttery, not dry at all. The truffles and mushrooms paired well with it. Definitely a winner.\n\nWe also ordered the chicken, and what a great choice! We were wary initially, but Isa makes fantastic chicken! The (white!) meat was tender and juicy, the skin fried to crispy perfection, and mmm, the sauce! \n\nOur last main dish was the Saffron Paella. I thought it had potential, but my friend Virginia (who loves paella) pointed out the glaring lack of crispy paella pan-crust. The lobster broth was also so delicate, you could barely taste it. On the other hand, there was plenty of seafood piled into it, so points for that. Overall, we thought this the worst dish of the night.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the vanilla creme brulee for dessert. GUH. Jebus, this was good! You know how most of the time you want more of that carmelized sugar on top? The custard is so good, you'd be happy with just that. But they give you plenty of crunch anyway!\n\nWhen our bill came, I was plesantly surprised. Two bottles of wine and plenty of food (I was still hungry, but I'm ALWAYS still hungry), and it was only $50 a person! For such great food, I thought it was a steal.\n\nI love Isa. Take me here, and I'd definitely put out ;)", "author": "Albert H."}

The waiter encouraged the Romanticism of the evening and gave recommendations that were fabulous.  Instead of encouraging us to eat more than necessary the waiter made sure to let us know if we had ordered the right amount of food.. and you know what?  It was perfect.

Better those little duckies and geese than me!  What's a little pain and cruelty compared to the end result that is foie gras?  What's the difference between a humane death and an inhumane death for these animals that are to be eaten?  Are you all telling me that you go throughout life without causing ANY harm to other living things?\n\nAlso, why can't they use veggie stock?  BECAUSE IT TASTES LIKE SHIT.  I applaud the chef for not compromising his craft by giving into these asinine requests.  If you don't like what's on the menu, go elsewhere.  I recall a vegetarian restaurant right around the corner that I'm sure you'd love -  you'll make fast friends with the malnourished patrons I saw exiting:  maybe you guys could even plan your next PETA rally?\n\nAhhhh...I fell better.  Please make this recent California transplant feel welcome.  Flame on, hippies!!\n\nIsa is more like a \"design your own tasting menu\" - proper pacing and excellent service make this stand out from more typical, tapas-style restaurants.  The food we ordered was excellent for the most part, and I'd say that this is the best small plate restaurant I've been to in recent years.  What we ordered:\n\n1) \"Smooth\" Asparagus Soup\n2) Baked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese\n3) Rigatoni with black truffles\n4) FOIE GRAS\n5) Potato Wrapped Seabass\n6) Grilled Flatiron Steak\n\nI was expecting smaller portions, and on our next visit we will order one or two less plates.  The Foie Gras was my favorite followed by the  baked goat cheese and the flatiron steak.  The moutarde verte was an excellent compliment to the steak and don't forget to eat the watercress!  I saw many tables leave these greens untouched.\n\nThe asparagus soup was WAY under salted and the rigatoni used very low grade black truffles with almost no taste or aroma - but I didn't expect much at this price point.\n\nI'd give Isa 5 stars if they properly seasoned their dishes coming out of the kitchen rather than relying you utilizing the dish of salt at the table.  Also, the wines by the glass were relatively uninspiring and didn't match well with our courses.\n\nI'll definitely be back soon", "author": "Will H."}

They ended up giving our table away and we were seated 35-40 minutes later.  The waitress was actually really nice and we went through the hour well.  However, one of our dishes was not served, a pasta dish with mushrooms (one of my vegetarian friends ordered this dish), and the lead server comes out and rudely told us that it wasn't coming out since the kitchen was closed and he didn't know why we didn't get served this last dish, speaking to us as though it was our fault that they missed the dish!  Not to mention, the fact they seated us late coincided with their kitchen closing!  \n\nAs one of my friends started to tell him that he was speaking to us in a rude way, he cuts her off, tells us that it's better if we don't make a scene, and walks away!  We were totally floored!  I've never been treated so rudely before at a restaurant!  For the price you're paying for small dishes, you'd expect the service to match it. \n\nI personally would not go back!

The grilled steak is always very good, but my favorite (when they have it) is the truffled pasta.  OK, maybe I'm a sucker for truffle anything, but this is just a very nice combination.  Regularly, they will have the truffled rissoto, but it's not quite as good.  The potato wrapped sea bass is also very good.\n\nOther notes : try to get a seat out in the back.

We made reservations for 2 at 7:45pm, left her house early because I knew parking would be a hassle. No joke, it took us over 50 minutes to find parking in this neighborhood. It is straight up crackin' on a Friday night. I think I racked up 7 miles just circling the neighborhood for parking.\n\n25 minutes after our reservations time and 2 late girls scurrying to the restaurant, we finally made it and still had a table reserved.  Our hostess was a doll and sat us down right away, excusing our tardiness.\n\nAll the cocktail had soju in the mix. I ordered a Lemon Drop and bff ordered a Grapefruit Cocktail (The Greyhound). My drink tasted fabulous. Lemon drops are hardly wronged by bartenders, thank goodness. The grapefruit cocktail was good, yet bitter. After having a gulp of my lemony sweetness, the grapefruit was purely bitter. Got a buzz, that's all that mattered!\n\nAll the dishes were prepared for two people to share. \nGoing in order of the items ordered on the DAT menu:\n- Organic Loch Duart salmon carpaccio with lemon, creme fraiche, cucumber, egg, capers & corstini : The salmon wasn't as fresh as I read on other Yelp reviews. It could have been more fresh. It tasted exactly like salmon sashimi with a hint of smokiness to it. The creme fraiche threw the taste off a bit and didn't compiment it as well as I hoped. It came with a few thin corstinis which I enjoyed the most on that dish. \n-Dungeness crab salad with avocado, apple, grapefruit & taragon: The fruits in this salad went surprisingly well with the crab. It was real crab meat (bits and pieces of shell were found in my portion) and all in all a good appetizer.\n-Pan roasted rocky Jr. Range chicken with fresh herbs, creamy mashed potatoes & jus de poulet: The presentation to this was very poorly done. It was literally just two pieces of chicken and a blob of mashed potatoes on a huge plate without any extra garnish to touch it up. Regardless of the way it looked, it was the best course of the meal. The chicken was tender and not dry and its skin was fried and crispy. The mashed potatoes were buttery. Simple dish.\n-Grilled golden gate natural angus flat iron steak with zucchini, polenta cake, moutarde verte & bordelaise sauce: By the time this came out, we were pretty full. I didn't like this dish. The steak was not tender and had a lot of tendons attached to it. Chewing the meat was not a pleasant experience. The zuccinis were bland to the taste along with the polente cake. Putting all three onto my fork and eating it didn't touch-up the taste. We finished less than half of this entree and called it quits. \n-Semifreddo all'amaretto: I couldn't put a finger as to what this exactly was. It was an ice-cream texture because it started melting and there were bits and pieces of almond and cookie crumbles mixed it. It reminded me of almond milk tea... I don't know what it was, but it was amazing! The light almond cookies were soooo good. \n-Vanilla bean gelato with biscotti: Best fried loves vanilla ice-cream so she finished this up and allowed me to have a bite. The vanilla was very strong but it went well with the biscotti. A simple dessert.\n\n\nOur waiter didn't seem very happy and probably gave us half-assed smiles twice the entire night.

You can catch a place on a bad night, you can try the few dishes that are excellent (when maybe the overall menu is not great), you can get a server that is not on the game, you can get put in the worst table in the house.  All of these things can affect your \"rating\" especially if the rating is coming from one visit (which in a city with this much great food, is sometimes the only chance a restaurant will get).\n\nThat said, I have been to Isa well over 20 times through the years.  I can honestly say, that it is deserving of the 4 stars.  I have had some 3 star nights, but I have also had some true-blue 5 star nights.\n\nThe most recent experience was a 4 star.  The food was excellent.  If you have not tried the sweetbreads here, you are really missing out.  It is one of the best preparations in the city.  The richness of the mashed potatoes, the sauce, the mushrooms and the sweetbreads is truly like a little rich slice of heaven.  The goat cheese is a consistently excellent app, the oysters were fantastic, the flat iron steak was very nice (though I like their old preparation of this this dish much better), and on and on.  We had the grilled calamari, which was great on our previous trip, but very weak this time around.  It is an example of why Isa just misses the 5 star mark.\n\nThe service is generally excellent.  This time was decent, though our server was close a talker and had some rocking body odor going on.  If you are lucky enough to get the short floppy haired guy, you are in a for a treat.  I think he is one of the best servers in the entire city.  It's rare that you remember a server, but he loves his job, loves the food, and isn't afraid to give his opinion about that night's particular dishes.  I've even had him check on us if he sees that our server is being inattentive.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Very romantic.  \nOur waitress (server) was very nice to the other tables, which she spent the better part of a half hour chatting up.

I went to Isa with high expectations based off of the other reviews that I had read on Yelp, but Isa went far above and beyond. Our table was ready on time, which is always a good start. The atmosphere in the back room, where we were sat, was charming, warm and inviting. The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable - we never had to ask for a water or bread refill. The managers stopped by to ensure that everything was well. Finally - the food was amazing. The dishes were flavorful and beautifully presented in a prompt family-style. The baked goat cheese was outstanding and paired really well with the French baguettes at the table. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the sauce they were in was savory and so good with the asparagus (also cooked perfectly; who likes overcooked, wilted asparagus?). The truffle risotto was life-changing; the texture was just what it's supposed to be, and it was chock-full of wild mushrooms that really complemented the truffle oil and Parmesan flavors. The potato-wrapped sea bass was enjoyable; the contrasting texture of the crispy potato and the sea bass was good. At that point in the meal, however, we were so high off the meal as a whole the sea bass kind of got overlooked. To finish it off, we had coffee and creme-brulee - what could be better?\nIsa is obviously dedicated to using fresh ingredients - I appreciated the bowl of freshly ground salt on the tables instead of the typical salt shaker, and also the cubes of natural cane sugar that came with my coffee. The restaurant just embodied a kind of rustic natural ambiance that is so comfortable in such a fast-paced city. \nAlso indicative of Isa's charm is the fact that every table contained smiling, laughing, joking couples/friends/families that were celebrating, toasting, and chattering away. Everything, and everyone was just so pleasant and dedicated to having a good time. \nOne thing that I really appreciate in restaurants today is simplicity. Don't overshadow the food with crazy flavors/decorations/garnishes, etc. Don't embellish the restaurant with crazy table settings, napkin folds, over-dressed staff, artwork, music, etc etc. That doesn't equate to quality, in any way, shape or form. Let the food stand by itself, and complement it with classic flavors. Isa did this just right; there's something to say for sticking with the classics, and this French restaurant has certainly mastered the delicate balance between classic preparation and innovative flavors in a setting that transcended the city and became an intimate French retreat for all of its guests. The result is nothing less than fabulous. \nThanks, Isa, for a lovely evening. I can't wait to come back.\nFive stars.", "author": "Molly B."}

Nothing was disappointing.  We pretty much tried everything on the prix fix menu (since there were 4 of us and 4 options for each of the three courses) and no one was better than the other.\r\n\r\nThe service is what drove this review down way more than it deserved.  I felt we were being rushed through the appetizers and main courses.  The dishes did not come out in any kind of order and the servers kept moving our plates, while we were still eating off them!  I suppose they still may have been on their \"small plates\" cycle, but if you can't handle the prix fix menu, DON'T DO IT!  Quite simple.  And if the initial rush wasn't bad enough, it took _forever_ to get our dessert.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I'm sure it was a fluke due to the special prix fix menu throwing a wrench into an otherwise well-oiled machine, but still kind of left a bad taste in an otherwise satisfied stomach.", "author": "Chris M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-20", "description": "3.5 stars.\n\nOur group of seven came here on a Saturday night originally to sample the prix fix menu, but realized quickly that it's only offered Monday-Tuesday. Although the individual dishes are all priced pretty much under $20 each, keep in mind that your total racks up quickly when they recommend you order at least 2 per person + drinks. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Oysters: Definitely good but your standard quality oyster. Served with a mignonette that I chose not to flavor it with - I'm a pretty firm believer that good oysters should be served just as is =)\n-Salmon Tartar: Tasted awesome with the creme fraiche and I'm always a sucker for the capers and salmon combo. Recommended!\n-Foie Gras: We were very excited about this item and ended up ordering 3, but it didn't quite live up to the hype. Served with this bread that I found unnecessary. (Side note - for the best foie gras in the city head over to bushi-tei. I promise you won't be disappointed!)\n-Veal Sweetbreads: I liked this one! Sweetbreads were juicy and tender and cooked perfectly. \n-Duck Breast: Heard good things about this one and it did live up to the hype. Ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked and well balanced with the veggie accompaniments. Recommended!\n-Flat Iron Steak: Nope. I thought it was underseasoned and someone else thought it was too salty - either way we agreed that it was not properly cooked and completely dry. Skip this and go for the duck instead.\n-Bouillabaisse: Good but forgettable.\n-Creme Brulee: Standard - nice crust. Vanilla beans on the bottom were a nice touch =)\n\nOverall the ambiance was very quaint in the back and I would be back for the few key dishes and a glass of wine. However, if you're planning on doing a full on mean for ~$70 per person (food, drinks, tax, tip), I would probably recommend you head over to one of the \"pricier\" restaurants in the city as you'll end up paying the same here for food that is slightly less impressive.", "author": "Christina L."}

(I will add however that my father sitting across from me might rate it higher because he liked his sea bass.) Firstly we were guided into a crowded back room seating area which felt like having dinner in the middle of a live circus act due to multiple long dinner party tables and crowds arriving and standing, seemingly confused about where to sit or just standing and talking in the small spaces between tables...right next to our table (you also have to walk through the kitchen to get there... Something I don't normally experience). We were moved to another part of the restaurant that was less crowded, in the front, but as there are only 3-4 normal chair tables we were made to sit on bar stool chairs at a tall table which is a little difficult for elderly people. Then we were told, after we each already set our minds on what we would order, that the meals would be served family style and come staggered. That was ok, though it was different from the norm I experienced there before. I mentioned we would rather have everything at once What ensued wasn't OK. We ordered two duck entrees and one sea bass. The menu also looked like it said that one soup was $7.50 and two soups $10. My father and I understood it to read that way. In fact it's the same soup, but $2.50 to split it (a split charge). Then my fathers sea bass arrived. Time passed ... A lot of time. Then I was served lamb, which I didn't order, then we pointed this out and waited again. A long time. Dad is finished with his entree. We waited again. One duck entree was served. My mom watched me eat and insisted on waiting for her dish though I offered her my food. I had trouble enjoying my meal though as she was sitting there hungry and tomorrow is mother's day. I finished. (I might add that I felt my duck was a little undercooked and that the spinach with bacon and raisins that accompanied it was a rather ordinary way of adding flavor- we all know that adding sweet (sugary raisins) and bacon (fat and salt) adds flavor- a great chef knows how to add flavor without resorting to extra fat & sugar.) We kept waiting. Finally we told the waiter we didn't want to wait any longer and would rather leave and expressed our disappointment. A better establishment, realizing their mistake with the lamb, would have comped us something, anything, at that point. Nothing. Mom left hungry, I left frustrated. That night and into the morning mom kept exclaiming she wouldn't return. I have been here 3-4 other times. Once I came here two nights in a row! I never experienced this \"family style\" serving and all that waiting... If you enjoy watching other people eat at your table this is the place for you.... And I should add that the manager had kindly offered since posting this review, for us to come back and receive one entree free for my mother. As appreciated as this offer is I'm not sure my father & my mother want to go back after that experience, as we would still be paying upwards of $60+ for two entrees to go back. We also live in Tiburon and are rarely if ever in the city together. I express my thanks but it feels like too little too late. The moment to offer a comp was when we were still at the restaurant. Making the offer now is good for the restaurant as it brings them additional business. But, as appreciative as I am of the gesture I just don't think wild horses could bring my mother back. At least that's what she has expressed to me so far.", "author": "Nicole S."}

Disappointed. \n\nNothing special for the salad. \nSalmon carpaccio - the portion is big and very fresh.\nTruffle risotto - the best one for the night. smell good and taste good.\nDuck breast - under cooked. too raw to cut.\nFoe Gras -  It's okay with the pear but not sure about the bread. I think it might be due to the plate presentation, not impressive to me. \nCreme brulee - good\nSemifreddo all ameretto - well made dessert. \n\nI am not sure if ISA only offered one fork and one knife per customer as their standard service.  This is wired especially when it is for French cuisine and the rating is so high.", "author": "Cynthia S."}

The ambiance is very intimate with dim lighting. But don't let that fool you, it's also a great place for a few friends, order the tapas and cheers to some good wine. \n\nMy friend and I started with the MAIN LOBSTER BROTH and BAKED GOAT CHEESE, so delicious!!! I had a few OYSTERS which were really good but as you know oysters aren't for everyone. We followed up with the ROASTED LAMB and DUCK BREAST which were prepared perfectly. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that we were neglected at times.

So I decided to take the bf here for his birthday.\nNow that I've had some time to think about the night and meal, I think I can give a more fair assessment about my dining experience.\n\nPros:\n- For the most part, the food was very good.  We ordered from the prix fixe and I especially enjoyed the salmon carpaccio appetizer and free range chicken entree.\n- The decor was nice, although I think we would've gotten more attention if sat in the rear or main part of the restaurant than in the front by the window\n- Price: the prix fixe does get you a lot of quality food for a very reasonable price tag\n\nCons:\n- The service was a bit off; not rude but not also attentive.  Our original waiter seemingly disappeared after delivering our first appetizer and asking us if we wanted a 2nd basket of bread.  Instead we had different wait staff throughout the night for each course.  And our 2nd bread basket never came.\n- We did not like the calamari appetizer... the spices used tasted odd and did not go well with the dish.  I wasn't a fan of the flank steak either, as it was a bit tougher than I have had at other places.\n- The pacing of the when the plates were brought out was very disjointed.  Our second appetizer and steak arrived around the same time, and there was a big gap between the entrees, detailed below.\n- The steak and chicken were brought out at quite a large time span apart.  I understood this was a supposed to be a \"family style,\" type dining experience where we share our dishes, but the tables to our left and right (also couples), had their entrees brought out to them at the same time without a 25-30 minute wait in between (and one of the tables had the steak and chicken as well, so there really wasn't any excuse for our entrees not to come out together or at least reasonable close together).\n- We weren't given a steak knife (or knives - if this was truly supposed to be family style dining - for both of us), and had to ask for it.  And then were only given one set, so I basically cut the pieces for the bf.\n\nI might be a little more pickier with this review because I am more critical of restaurants I choose for special occassions, and I chose Isa for a special birthday.  In truth, the taste quality of the meal in proportion to the price weighs positively in Isa's favor.  Would I go back?  Possibly, but I'm not in a rush at the moment.", "author": "Mercutio k."}

Perfectly salted.\n\n\nI would give this place 5 stars if the service was consistent. The first time I went the hostess was not so inviting and the waiter was just busy.

We got the heirloom tomato salad (I think with feta and balsamic), the scallops (topped with sweet corn kernels and mashed potatoes on the side), the truffled spaghetti and the duck...  \n\nTomato salad was amazing!  Slightly chilled, perfectly seasoned heirloom tomatoes with a nice balsamic...  YUM!  Perfect way to start the meal.  \n\nScallops were great - contrast btw the sweet, crispy corn topping was great and the delicately sweet, tender scallops and creamy mashed potato was great.  \n\nSpaghetti was beyond expectation - I had read all the reviews on yelp and was like \"right...  it's spaghetti...\" - but somehow, the flavor of Isa's spaghetti is so deep...  Truffled spaghetti with tomato compote on al dente angel hair pasta...  Probably had tons of butter in it, but it was this amazing, deep, rich flavor.\n\nThe duck - the only disappointment of the meal (but maybe b/c everything else was so good).  Bf and I both agreed that we were let down by the duck (I think it was under-salted and bf said it was overall just \"flavorless\") - it's possible that if we ate the duck b/f other dishes, we'd like it better b/c flavorwise, it wasn't nearly as strong as the other dishes...  The entirety of the dish was disappointing though - duck was undersalted, came with undersalted jus that tasted slightly like blueberries...

I was impressed that Isa put some of their best dishes on it, as usually I've found restaurants will put their cheaper things on menus like that.  Our waiter was very friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu and wines without being overbearing. \n\nBetween us, we had the spicy tuna tartare, butter lettuce salad, pototo-wrapped cod, and the duck.   All were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I wanted to order a side of the truffled risotto, as I've had it before and it's amazing, but that would have been way too much food!  The desserts were to die for!  We tried one of each on the tasting menu, which was a flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, a vanilla creme brulee, and amaretto semifreddo.  \n\nHighly recommended, I will certainly be back here!

Since it was over an hour wait for a table, we decided to look to another to eat. We walked around and decided to eat at Isa. \n\nIt's been over three years since I've eaten here and I remembered it being really good. Although everything was meant to be small plates, I felt like the portions were quite comparable to entree portion sizes. We started with the fuyu persimmon and apple arugula salad. It was a perfect salad for a Fall evening. The sweet and crunchy fruit went really well with the spicy arugula greens.\n\nFor our entrees, we shared the butter fish and chicken. The butter fish was wonderful. The fish and mushrooms were baked in parchment paper. All the flavors were trapped in the parchment pouch, so the fish was full of flavor. I highly recommend this dish if you like fish. The chicken was cooked under a brick, so it was very juicy and moist. It was served with a side of soft and smooth mashed potatoes. \n\nThe dessert menu wasn't that impressive, so we just ordered the flour less chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. It was good, but nothing out from the ordinary.\n\nThe service and food were both great, so I would return if I'm in the area.

The hostess looked at her in disgust and was like, you can't have that since there are only two of you.  I had noticed a nice tall table in the window in the front dining area, so I went back out and asked the hostess if we could take that table.  She said we could.  But when my friend and I went back out, we took our menus with us. And the hostess grabbed the menus away from us (like we should have known to leave them at the other table) and was like the menus are already on the table.  \n\nThankfully, our server was much nicer (we were contemplating walking out after our experience with the hostess).

Other than the oysters, the other dishes were good, but not thrilling.\r\n\r\n2nd visit, I was craving the oysters and foie gras once again since peach season is ending very soon.  Additionally, I ordered the grilled calamari, crab salad, and the tuna tartare.  Everything was excellent and well executed.

If you do, chances are, you will be served by Jonathan, who is funny, personable and a wine connoisseur, who will pair your meal perfectly.  It's definitely worth giving up a little ambiance to have him at your table.\n\nOkay and one more tip: It's about sharing, do not, really, do not ,order for yourself only.

The tuna was really soft as well as melts in your mouth...it goes really well with the sauce and avocado.  \n\nSecond course: \nHalibut a la plancha with braised fennel, artichokes, capers, tomato confit & olives.

They'd changed the sauce and it's even better...love it love it love it!\n\nLobster Broth. Although not as creamy as their Lobster Bisque, but it's still very very good.\n\nCrab Salad. They've also updated the ingredients on this dish, and I like how they've put a little bit of mango in there.\n\nDessert:\nGrapefruit Granite. Refreshing as usual.

When the server came to pour a glass for me, he completely missed my glass, pouring wine all over the table. Because we were all so shocked, we were speechless for a moment, and then of course we told him to stop (since he didn't seem to notice that he was pouring wine on to the table). He looks confused, apologies and tries to clean up the mess (luckily none of it got on anyone). After a little clean-up, he attempts his pour again...and repeats - pours wine on the table again. This time we were quicker about telling him to stop, but at this point, he has spilled about 1/3 of our bottle of wine all over the table. Again, he apologizes and tries to clean it up. The third try, he put the mouth of the wine bottle on to my glass so that it was touching and poured the wine. Embarrassingly, he did that for everyone else and for the rest of the night.\n\nMistakes happen. But that was huge. In addition to that, he didn't seem particularly apologetic, nor did he offer to open a new bottle of wine for us or comp us in any way for the bad service. When we told him we thought his behavior was unacceptable, he said he would bring us a free dessert. He didn't. \n\nYou might think that after that experience, Isa would be on my banned list, but it wasn't; I still think the food is amazing and delicious and am willing to give them another chance.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI've been here ages ago, but I don't remember it being as good as it was this last time...

We had a great dinner with wine and cocktails...which only ended up being ~$50/person!  \n\nWe got the baked goat cheese, tuna tartare, potato wrapped sea bass, steak, lamb and truffled risotto.  Everything was delicious...  My favorites were the lamb and sea bass; the steak was the only dish that I thought was just average....but it was still good.  \n\nThe service was great.

They have hung all of these little white lights around which makes the patio area so cute.

The food was amazing. The service was questionable. The atmosphere had its ups and downs.\n\nThank goodness we had made reservations. The line was practically out the door (some w/ reservations even). The restaurant itself wasn't too big, but it was jam-packed and with only one hostess running around. The atmosphere was dim, nicely decorated, but very cramped. We got stuck at a table by a plant and somewhat in the middle of an isle. I thought that our waiter had a very cute-middle-aged-decent-kind-hearted-might-get-mugged-by-bad-guys look to him. So although my friends booed his service, my biased self gave him extra points compared to them. The table we got stuck at was extremely UNSPACIOUS and caused quite a bit of uncomfort. But I know how it is when people ask for a table change. People will be pissed, whether its the waiters or other staff. On top of that, they did have a s**tload of people waiting. So it was understandable that he couldn't give us that table. He did tell us in a nice tone. But I could understand why my friends were pissed. He told us that it was a GOOD table compared to many others already. Mistake. But on top of the extremely crowded spot we were stuck in, the bussers kept walking back and forth in between the tables next to us and they kept knocking down our bags, kicking our chairs etc. without any apologies. Our waters were refilled time and time again though. But, they did totally forget about our last entree, collected our dishes and handed us the dessert menu (the busser, and then the waiter). We had to remind them twice that we still had one more dish coming. Therefore, I had to knock down a star, despite the wonderful food. Oh yeah, and our server gave us the bill with the 18% gratuity added on there for \"our convenience\" he said. It would've looked a lot better if the gratuity part wasn't written in BY HAND. I let that slide once again because of the way he looked, but my friends were EFFIN furious! And since when was there gratuity for a party of 4?\n\nNow for the food. It was recommended that we order one appetizer and entree per person, therefore leaving room for dessert. Family style was recommended as well. I'm glad we only ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 2 desserts, because we were just the perfect amount of full afterwards. The dishes aren't cheap, and the portions weren't big, but nothing on the menu was bad. Consider it a tasting menu.\n\nCrab Salad - it was my favorite item of the whole night (and my friend's too). Large chunks of crab meat, and not with too many overwhelming spices. \nSpicy Tuna - this one was good too, but somehow I've just had better tuna dishes before.\nCeviche - I'm not positive of what fish was in this one, but it this dish was quite good. Better than the Spicy Tuna one.\n\nSeared Scallops - my friend really liked this one, but I felt that the scallops were a tiny bit over-cooked. I like my seafood raw or close to raw. But the corn and mashed potatoes that came with it probably TIED IT UP with the CRAB SALAD if not BETTER! It was just soooooo good! It was freakin' delicious. I wish they had a side of that to order.\nButterfish - they said they could taste the \"Chinese\" in this one. I thought the butterfish was perfectly tender and cooked just right (better than the scallops, but not the corn and mashed potatoes).\nFlat-Iron Steak - the steak was cooked to perfection and it was very juicy. Good steak indeed, but we could agree that its something we can have at many elsewheres.\nMushroom & Truffle Risotto - if there was a disappointment for the night, this one would've been it. There's no meat in this one, just mushrooms, expensive shaved tiny pieces of expensive mushrooms, and cheese. Lots and lots of provolone cheese. Cheese may be good to eat, but bad to smell. And we all felt that this dish was just too CHEESY. But it wasn't bad to eat, as I've mentioned previously.\n\nCreme Brulee - amazing and not too sweet, but the hard sugar coat on top was a bit TOO HARD. I'd prefer the creme brulee over at PPQ anyday.\nFlourless Chocolate Cake - the vanilla bean ice cream was good. The chocolate cake itself wasn't too sweet, which was good. But nothing too special.\n\nOverall, the food was great. Knocked down a star for the service and crowdedness of the restaurant.

My friends and I had a hard time reading the menu and figuring out what to get, partly because of the lack of light, and partly because there were so many excellent choices. And when you are hungry, you can't think straight. Some of us wanted to order the whole menu, \"but it's tapas so they must be small dishes!\" The rest of us politely tried to persuade them otherwise. \n\nSo, we all got the prix fixe. I had salmon tartar for appetizer and sable fish for entree. It was so much food we couldn't even order dessert. \n\nSalmon tartar was delicious possibly only because it had creme fraiche on it. I am very fond of creme fraiche and firmly believe it can make anything taste good. Like Creme fraiche ice cream at Bi Rite. You just can't go wrong. \n\nFish was slightly bland for my taste. Very moist and juicy, but besides the flavors of mushrooms, i just needed more. \n\nFriends had steak, foie gras, calamari. They raved about all of them, but I have to point out that the calamari was so great! I love calamari that are not fried, but sauteed with some beans and become chewy, juicy goodness full of great texture. The calamari here was even better than the ones at Delfina. It'll be a must for me when I come back. \n\nPrix fixe were $25 a person, which is reasonable for the amount of food you get. I don't see why its cuisine isn't just \"Californian.\" We didn't really get how it's \"tapas,\" \"French\" or \"Asian fusion.\" The only Asian thing we saw was the prosperity cat waving its little paw. \n\nMaybe it's a Marina thing: food isn't quite hip enough without the catch words like \"tapas\" or \"Asian fusion.\" But, it doesn't matter what it's labelled at the end of the day as long as the food is good.

The small plates are, as our waiter counseled us, intended for family-style dining.  And it's recommended that you order two per person.

The tuna tartare was also good. The baked goat cheese and lamb were even better.  The selection of fish, chicken, meat, shellfish and vegetarian dishes was sufficiently broad to satisfy anyone.

Slightly hidden on Steiner between Lombard and Chestnut, Isa continues to pack people in with a good combination of atmosphere, food, and service. Luke Sung, the head chef, has put together an interesting small plates menu that still stands out as rather unique. Like most small plates restaurants, the menu features a number of dishes that are \"small\" small plates (about appetizer sized) and \"large\" small plates (a large nibble for 2 people). The restaurant was redesigned in the last few years to create a more open dining experience.\n\nThe dishes on the menu offer a wide variety of options. There are some nice salads and a very interesting lobster broth that bears no resemblance to the usually cream-based lobster bisque you find in most restaurants. The strongest dishes on the menu are the seafood small plates, followed closely by the poultry dishes. I have been to Isa many times and generally find that you need about a total of 5 dishes for two normal adults. If you are out with a light eater, you might be able to get away with 4 dishes.\n\nThe service is generally quite good and the ambience is suitable for a nice early date (read 1st through 3rd date) or a night out with your significant other. Some of the tables in the main dining room feel a bit cramped, but the density of tables is a nice tradeoff when compared with the prospect of longer waits. Sitting at the bar is a fairly pleasant experience if you cannot get a table.\n\nCost: About $40 per person if you have 3 courses and a drink\n\nRecommended dishes: Potato wrapped sea bass, the sea scallops, and fulton chicken are all excellent choices. Other good choices include the steak and the duck.\n\nAdvice: This is a great place to take a date. If you are planning ahead, ask to be seated on the patio in the rear as it has more ambience than the main dining room. The wine selection is relatively affordable and includes a few nice choices for the seasoned eye.", "author": "Charles H."}

A note on the service style, this is a takeoff on tapas in that they offer small plates that come out as they are ready as opposed in traditional courses.\n\nWe started with the baked Laura Chenel goat cheese with basil pesto. It was very flavorful and smoothness of the goat cheese and the basil pesto complimented each other nicely. We moved on to the scallops with corn, fava beans, cherry tomatoes, mashed potatoes with a truffle sauce. The scallops had a deep sear with a nice medium rare center. Of the few hundred times I have had scallops over the years these were the best prepared I have experienced. Next we experienced the truffle risotto with an assortment of mushrooms. While truffle risotto was something that I have wanted to try I am not a big mushroom fan. As such, you had the earthiness one wants/expects from truffles and mushrooms but it was a little much for my tastes. My wife on the other hand is a mushroom fan and loved the preparation. The final items we had was one of the specials offered that day. It was the braised short rib. The short rib was tender and the demi-glace provided a great source of flavor to compliment the risotto that was served with this dish.\n\nBest single item was the corn that was served with the seared scallops. It was tremendously fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe facility is interesting. The inside is upscale and many of the tables appear to be good for an intimate dinner.

We were a group of 4, celebrating a friend's birthday. Our server was Dave and he recommended the Seabass and Yellowfin Tuna which we ended up ordering. In addition to that we ordered the Calamari, Spaghetti, Truffle Risotto, and the Range Chicken. My personal fav was the Seabass, Tuna and Risotto. But then again, anything truffle infused is almost always delicious. We also ordered the Creme Brulee and Flourless Chocolate Cake for desert. Our server Dave was supper friendly and attentive.

The seafood paella was a miss, a very small portion with an -eh?- ok taste. Skip the paella. It just didn't stand up to the other great dishes. \n\nOverall the food was excellent, the service was great and the ambiance in the patio was interesting (we went at 7:30, and since it's daylight till 9, the whole room had an eerie yellowish glow which was a bit weird, but after a few drinks it won't matter).

Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, covered in fresh huckleberry sauce with a perfect salad of beets, arugula and chevre.

I officially needed a fake ID at this point to finish my next round of drinks. Pleased to be back in my teens again, it only got better -- as I polished off the last few bites, a sweeet (SO sweet) elderly couple stopped by the table to wish me a happy ...16th...yes, SIXTEENTH birthday.\n\nOh, magically delicious duck, how I love you.\n\nDinner ended with a flourless chocolate cake, candles, a glass of dessert wine (courtesy of Isa) and a back patio remix of 'Happy Birthday' featuring the owner's son from upstairs  :)\n\nIsa (and the duck) never lets me down and proves time and time again why it's a tried and true favorite.

I was actually supposed to take my friend to Bistro Aix, but forgot the cross street, and ended up here instead.  \n\nAlthough we didn't have reservations and all the tables were booked up, we got a space at the bar.  The place is really nice, and at first looks, the size of the place can be deceiving, but if you look further into the room, it stretches all the way down.  The food here is excellent.  A mix between mediterranean and american, it doesn't really fall into any specific category.  There is a 3 course prix fix menu, as well as an a la carte menu.  I felt that the prix fix menu almost filtered out everything and just left the top of the list on their menu.  And for under $30, it's a steal. \n\nThe only complaint I had from this dinner was the wait we had to endure for our food.  We arrived at around 7, but it wasn't until 8 that we finally got our appetizers, then 8:20 for our main course, and finally 9:50 for dessert.  Usually, it wouldn't have been too bad, but we had somewhere to go at 9!!  Our waitress was very kind and apologetic and didn't put our wines on the bill due to the lag, and explained the kitchen is still recovering from VDay.  She tried to keep things pleasant and chatted with us during the wait.  She asked us where we were rushing to, and embarrassed to tell her that we wanted to rush back to catch Grey's Anatomy (such a teaser episode!!), I told her we had a movie to catch.\n\nI give this place 4 stars....3 stars for the wait, but overall 4 stars because our waitress was very nice and professional about the situation.", "author": "Tadd L."}

One of the great things about this place is that THEY ARE NOT STINGY WITH THE FOIE GRAS.  (with wild huckleberries, port & vanilla custard brioche) I hate when you go to a nice place and they give you a pebble of a piece, where you only think it tastes good because half the time it's the anticipation, the other half it's pure imagination.  This place will give you a fat piece where you think they musta stuff this duck like f__.   Approximately the size of your fore finger and index finger combined.\n\nIn fact, I think it's one of the few places that still serve it - wasn't there a city ban on it?  Well, shhhhhhh if it is.\n\nThey served the foie gras with a menu-paired wine - it was more of a dessert wine (Uroulat Jurancon 2001) than anything, but it pair well.  Or maybe it was just really really good dessert wine.  Not sure.\n\nThe roasted skate (with tomato, zucchini, potato, basil & extra virgin olive oil) was your typical white fish, but it was definitely light and flaky.  Full of flavor I might add.  And again, not stingy with the portions.  I would say 2 solid fillets.  Lightly grilled and tasty.\n\nLastly the Shitake & Oyster Mushroom Risotto was solid.   Flaked with parmesan reggiano, it was rather overpowering, but it was because the parmesan was perfect.  It almost took over the dish, but for your risotto with cheese lovers, this would be it.  Great consistency and buttery.\n\nBy the glass, the 2003 Chardonnay, St. Clement was crisp and perfect, the 2004 Pinot Grigio, Kris was ok - tasted a bit stale, but maybe it was just me.\n\nOverall, the 'tapas' are awesome.  Three tapas for two is plenty.  I have heard the mussels and steak are good, but you're on your own there.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nBathroom - clean and above average.  Serviceable.", "author": "Isaac L."}

Hooray for Isa!\n\nThe only reason why I got to go to this place is because of Restaurant Week.  Otherwise, I would never be able to afford this place.  It took me forever to decide which place to try out of the long list of participating restaurants.  I was sold by this place's menu.  Boy, was I glad I came here out!  This place is great!  Five stars for everything!\n\nAfter a long day of walking around SF and before a Giants game, Isa was just what I needed.  The host was incredibly nice, the atmosphere, intimate and cozy, the back patio, covered and heated, was an extremely nice touch.  Happy Hour drink specials were very reasonable.  But that's not the best part.  The best part was the server.  If only I could remember his name.  He was a little Filipino man with an accent, but so knowledgeable and friendly.  He was probably the best waiter ever next to Molly from Maestros in Beverly Hills.  He knew how to describe the food, and you could tell, he was totally in love with the menu.  He could recommend wines and drinks, whatever you'd like.  He could really sell anything and was very accommodating, especially with the inexperienced.  He knew how to carry a conversation and was very attentive, without being overbearing.  He had the nicest smile and explained everything thoroughly.  He really made the experience five stars.\n\nOh, and the food.  He was absolutely right about the food.  We tried the foie gras, perfectly cooked.  Duck, crab salad, salmon carpaccio.  Everything impeccable and served family style.  So tasty, so fresh, and so well-prepared.  The chef is really some sort of genius.  He is a young man, with a lot of talent.  This is really one of the best dining experiences in town.

When I got out I had to be very careful as I was afraid my butt might knock over the wine on the next table. btw I'm small Asian female. That also means I can hear the conversations on the next table too! So my husband and I were playing our phones to avoid talking too much the whole night. So if you want to take your date there and have a lot words to say, people on the next table can almost hear everything.....", "author": "Bob H."}

Let's just get something out of the way first:\n\nI'm an opentable junkie. It's gotten so bad that I just don't make reservations at restaurants unless they're on open table (that's not to say I won't go to restaurants that aren't opentable-enabled, I just won't be the one making the reservations). So I constantly scour the opentable \"just added\" list for new restaurants I haven't tried yet, and Isa came up. I went to Yelp and it seemed you Yelpers really liked it (four and a half stars!), so off I went.\n\nFirstly, I love the seperation between the front bar area and the back room. Both have distinctly different atmospheres perfectly befitting their purposes. The front area feels like a bar bistro, whereas the back area feels like a countryside chalet.\n\nThe service is utterly perfect. No beverage went empty for a moment. No plate remained on the table longer than necessary. Every course was served precisely on time and in its place within the context of the meal. Spices, herbs, and sauces were all utterly and impeccably executed. The wine list felt a bit short , but the selections were ideal for the courses, so I really can't complain here either. \n\nSome advice on dining here: Because the food is served family style and the portions differ significantly among dishes, I recommend hearing out your server's suggestions for course groupings in order to ensure there's a structure to the meal and that everyone is satisfactorily full at its conclusion.", "author": "Tal K."}

GREAT prices (during the week with the Prix Fixe deal) - AMAZING food - INCREDIBLE atmosphere - GREAT service! Just go here...mmkay? I was here with a good friend, but man - this is such a perfect setting for a first date.  I'm a sucker for anything outside. Drinking, eating, lounging. Granted, this is sort of a faux-outside area as it's heated and covered - it's great. Even inside was nice. But coming here, I'd definitely want to sit on the patio. It's a much larger space than you'd think from the outside, or even walking past the bar inside.\n\nOn a first visit make sure you go sometime during the week and take advantage of their Prix Fixe menu. We had the truffled spaghetti (don't come here and skip that - you'll regret it if you do), the butter lettuce and endive salad (incredible), heirloom tomatoes (I hate tomatoes - so I didn't have that...but my friend enjoyed it), baked butterfish (not bad - I'd give it 3 or 4 stars) and the scallops (it wasn't on the Prix Fixe menu - but we had to have them. Glad we did - SO WORTH IT!)\n\nPlenty of food. Great wine. Good price. Great atmosphere - 5 stars for that alone. Go here. Just do it. You'll love it.", "author": "Eli S."}

Everything was great and we left feeling extremely stuffed.  The service was quick (almost too a fault where you feel you have to rush).  \n\nMy irritation about this place is that, while I appreciate to hear what \"most people\" do, it doesn't mean I'm going to make the same decisions.  Our waiter must have told us 4-5 times that everyone should get an appetizer and an entree.  Again, I appreciate the opinion but I don't appreciate that after we made our orders (5-7 dishes for a table of 5,) the waiter thought he should warn us about how hungry we'll be when we leave.  It was a little rude, a little overbearing and left a sour taste in my mouth.  It almost seemed as though the fact that we didn't do everything as the waiter requested resulted in less attention/poor service.  \n\nThis is not to say we hated the place, since the food and atmosphere are great, but the waiter definitely put a damper on the meal since he was so pushy.  He ended the night with saying \"I bet you're still hungry.\"  I can be playful with the best of them, but I didn't want to play with him, I wanted to slap him.\n\nGo for the food, the ambiance and PLEASE order what you want.

Though parking was not the best I somehow got pretty lucky that evening. \n\nAs I made my way into the restaurant I was beginning to set the mood for a very elegant setting. We were seated in the back lodge patio area. It was ambient and cozy. It seems the patio is where people prefer to sit. Seated almost immediately we were the earlier bunch arriving just shy of the dinner crowd on a monday night. it was packed by 7:30 that evening. \n\nI started off with the Washington Oysters. At $11 per half a dozen they were tiny! however, i do love the sauce! the bread and butter, compliment of the house was nice to keep us from starving while we wait. The food came out at different times and it was explained on the menu as to why. So I was forgiving on that because I dont mind if the chef spent a little more time to make the plate perfect. Afterall, it's not fast food. I wouldn't call this place fine dining either but it definitely has an attraction to people with some shiny jewelry and an older crowd. I dont mind the bling haha. \n\nAnyway, lot's of older asian people there. however, it is still well mixed. let's conitnue with the dishes. we started with the Prix Fixe menu, which i highly recommend for your buck! plus all drinks are $5 before 7pm during happy hour, even wine. Im disappointed that the wine list per glass weren't the best. I didnt want to spend a load on a bottle. Im sure the list is better for the bottles. \n\nAnyway, for my plate, i enjoyed it with a glass of merlot. after one glass i dont think i'd have another because i couldnt enjoy it anymore. I had the Prix Fixe dinner and started with the Lemon Dill Cured Salmon. It was different and very good. I just dont prefer my salmon cut into little cubes. But it was topped on fennel, radish, cucumber, and lemon mustard dressing. it paired very well together. My second course was the Grilled Natural Flat Iron Steak with layers of potato dauphinoise & cognac-green peppercorn demi- glace. it was very good since im not a big potato person. We shared dessert and the Semifreddo and Creme Brulee was very rewarding.\n\nMy friend had a Prix Fixe menu as well. She started off with Steamed Mussels in white wine with garlic, shallots, grilled bread & parsley. And that was really good. She ordered the Pasta with Clams. She didnt really care for it so i dont know if thats any good. I cant say since i didnt taste it. \n\nAnother friend of mines started off with the Spicy Tuna as appetizers which was topped on avacado and something else. it was really good and different. The spicy tuna is also cut into cubes but the quality was perfect. She had scallops with brussel sprouts and they were very flavorful. I'd recommend that dish as well. She didnt do the prix fixe menu and instead chose a la carte and ended up paying more for her dinner. \n\nOverall, try the place out. Bring a date because it's nice and cozy. Semi-Casual dressing though it's not required. I had a great deal and my waiter was awesome enough to bring us some after dinner dessert drinks which was nice.", "author": "Lina P."}

Since I was hosting this large party, I paid the bill without closely looking at the details.  I was charged $19.00 for this small bowl of plain noodles.  After dropping nearly $500,  you would think they would comp  this or at most charge us $10, but $19.00????  Really???? At least they could have served us the sphaghetti sauce with truffle oil on the side!  Also, another thing that left a bad taste in our mouth was that our server told us the tip was included on our bill, which is to be expected for a large party.  But on my bill under \"tip\" was 0.00- so i asked my server if in fact the tip was included, since it said \"0\".  He said it was.  After getting home and looking at my bill, I noticed a charge of $73.00 under the beverage section and it was marked \"open item\".  So our server put the bill under beverage which means I had to pay tax and tip on the tip!!!!  Please be sure to look over your bill before paying.... shady things can happen.

We were late first, so completely reasonable to have us wait.  Not to mention, the hostess kept reassuring us that she hadn't forgotten about us.  About 10 minutes into the wait, she offered us a free drink on the house.  Even though we were seated before it arrived, she still brought us each a glass of champagne.  VERY classy.

My thoughts were free food, delicious restaurant, good company. Score!\n\nI had been hearing about Isa quite a bit and was surprised to see very few people in the restaurant when we arrived. We were given more menus than I would choose to flip through and after executively deciding against sushi, I was drawn to the prix fix menu. I found it a bit odd that a restaurant claiming to boast sharing dishes would have a 3 course prix fix, but we ran with it.\n\nOverall, I would say this restaurant is confused. Pretty large portions that came at very random times on a table too small to even hold three dishes simultaneously. I was not particularly impressed by any of the flavors and had a hard time understanding what direction they were attempting to take with their assorted menu.\n\nThe wait staff was awkward and impersonal. At one point, I asked my waiter if a particular desert was good and when he had little to nothing to say about it, I commented that he didn't seem particularly excited by anything. He let me know it was because he was not American and chatty as we tend to be. Odd? It did end up turning into a bit of laugh for all of us and he gave us the desert for free, asserting it was quite delectable. \n\nDid I enjoy myself? Yes. Did I get full? Yes. Will I come back? It depends if someone else is paying.", "author": "Alicia J."}

The food was served family style, and each plate I tried I loved. We first had the seafood risotto, which was pretty rich and creamy. You can only have so much of it, but it was still very tasty. Then the halibut, very succulent. Next, my favorite, the Fois Gras with peaches! I have never had fois gras before, and let me tell you..it was amazing. (I think i fell in love with liver that night) Then my other favorite, the duck. Served alongside with a balsamic salad I believe. Overall, Isa's food was great! \n\nThe venue is a little small. Tables pretty close to each other---I felt like ol' grannie next to me was listening in to my perverted conversations. But it's nicely small in an intimate way I guess.

The main dining room is technically an outdoor patio with heat lamps and string lights, but in such a sophisticated way. The server explained that every plate was small and the intention was to share, which was just perfect because my bf and i have the same taste in food, but more importantly, we share everything ;). I think we went through four bread baskets that night. We started with the butter lettuce salad and the baked goat cheese. the butter lettuce salad was amazing because of the beautiful pears and delicious dressing that came with it. my bf didn't love the goat cheese for some reason, but he seemed to eat most of it :P. I thought it was lovely because it was very easy to spread on our bread and i'm a huge goat cheese fan. the pesto and pinenuts that accompanied it really added a lot of flavor. Then we had the seared scallops with mashed potatoes, bacon, brussel sprouts and truffle sauce. This dish was AMAZING. i loved it so much because i havent seen too many scallop dishes prepared like it was at Isa. the scallops were succulent, the bacon was perfect, the sprouts were fresh, the potatoes were phenomenal and fluffy and the truffle sauce....self-explanatory. Can you go wrong with anything truffle-associated? nope! then we had the spaghetti with himalayan truffles. I've had better spaghetti but, again, the truffles just added so much to the dish. After, we had the pan roasted chicken with herbs, mashed potatoes, and jus de poulet. This chicken was cooked to perfection. So juicy and full of flavor. The potatoes on top of the jus were really delicious and the the herbs were underneath the crispy skin of the chicken, so every bite was awesome. For dessert, we had the semifreddo all'amaretto and the vanilla bean creme brulee. I love anything with amaretto, so the first dish was great with a beautiful presentation. My favorite dessert is creme brulee, and this one didn't wow me. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I always have high expectations of my desserts ;). I'm not a huge Malbec fan, but the wine we had was spectacular. Our server brought our food a little too fast, in my opinion, but he saved it when I was holding hands with my love across the table and he told us not to move because he \"worked around moments like that\" to encourage our romantic evening. Such a cute thing to say! Overall, this restaurant was darling and I can't wait to try more things on the menu.", "author": "Sheeva G."}

Their salads were definitely overpriced, though, and the patio was too cold! I couldn't drink my water because I was freezing--I definitely should've asked them if they could turn on the heater closest to me. \n\nBe warned: This place definitely brings in the preppy Marina first-date crowd, and the tables are close enough together that you'll probably get to listen to the people next to you awkwardly (and annoyingly) getting to know one another.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-02", "description": "Isa is a predominately French, family-style, small-plates restaurant with a fully weather-proof patio, an uncommon batch of middle aged, male servers, and fantastic food.  We ate there on Monday, February 1 and, arriving at 6, had no trouble getting a table, though the restaurant was filling when we left.\nWe were led past the open kitchen (noticed a shelf of celebrity cookbooks and bottles of Sriracha) onto the back patio which, despite feeling like a backyard deck with planters and strings of light, is fully covered, and replete with heat lamps and antique sconces.  Happy Hour doesn't end until 7 so we each enjoyed a $5 glass of wine (specialty Soju cocktails also available).  A 2-course selectable prix fixe is $24, 3-course is $28 and includes much of the main menu, including the daily special.  On the other hand, items on the menu range from $7-23, so I would advise  you to do the math, especially because everything is served family style.\nPrince Edward Island Mussels: The mussels were something classic, almost common, done exceptionally.  The mussels were tender, almost like the bellies of raw oysters.  The steaming liquid was unusually rich, with a little tang of wine, and far surpassed the normal parsley and butter.  The grilled bread served with the mussels was in fact burned, overpowering and inedible, but the warm sourdough baguette already on the table was a nice substitute.\nBaked Laura Chenel Goat Cheese: This dish didn't seem that exciting, but, like the mussels, was pleasantly surprising and unusual.  Served on tomato concasse (peeled, seeded and chopped...I learned something new today) with basil, pine nuts and olive oil, the baked cheese didn't have breading or crust.  Instead of being dolled up, the goat cheese remained a strong flavor with a delicate whipped texture.  It, too, went well with the warm bread and I plan to attempt to replicate it at home.  Being a small and light dish, I think it should have come before the mussels, instead of just a few minutes after.  The restaurant's philosophy of serving lightest to heaviest seemed to be offset by kitchen timing.\nDaily Special: Grilled Hamachi:  Hamachi grilled to a slight char like a steak, served with olive tapenade, clams and calamari.  A little much, no?  And it was, especially after cheese and mussels.  But I cannot fault them for how I ordered and the dish was good.  I am not partial to fish, but it was really nice and pink on the inside, and the tapenade covering it was mild.  The calamari was unbelievably tender, really, like custard.  But what I really enjoyed were the clams.  Like the mussels, they were tender, and each had its own little pool of buttery jus.\nDutch Valley Veal Sweetbreads:  The last thing to come, and by far the heaviest, was the veal sweetbreads.  The varied, wild mushrooms were all good, but mostly overpowered by the really overwhelming scent of truffles.  The sweetbreads were tender, creamy, and, thankfully, were cut to small pieces that looked less like brain.  This is my second time having sweetbreads and I'm really just not all there  yet.  The potato was smooth and soaked up the delicious, rich mushroom broth that turned to a proteinous blob in my refrigerator overnight (a good thing, despite the image).  Unfortunately, the potato pancake was very dense and not crispy, and didn't help allay the weight of the rest of the dish.\nThey recommended that we order two dishes per person which was really too much (as exemplified by the sweetbreads I just had for breakfast.  mmm) as both the hamachi and the sweetbreads were more than generous entree portions.  As a duo that usually tempers our appetites by perhaps sharing an appetizer, four dishes made for a giant doggy bag of food that doesn't necessarily reheat well (potato pancake).  I also feel that the dishes would be better served as courses taken away at completion, rather than a conglomerate of dishes.  At one point, all four were on the table at the same time which, besides being cramped on a two person table, did not showcase the food well.  Lastly, we ate no vegetables.  Most of the menu items had a base of mashed potatoes or mushrooms, and I'm all for umami.  But next time, I'll make room for a salad.\nOverall, the food was exceptional, the service attentive but not obsequious, and, the highest compliment I can give: I would take my parents here.\n\n-Arrive before 7 for Happy Hour $5 drinks\n-Double check the Prix Fixe menu for prices\n-Grab a mint on your way out.  They are anise flavored and each cellophane wrapper says \"Bye.\"", "author": "Laura S."}

We had at least one of everything on the D.A.T. menu, except the flatiron steak. I liked all the appetizers and I'd get any of them again. Regarding entrees, I wouldn't order the halibut again. The duck was a little too salty, but otherwise outstanding. The risotto was too rich in my opinion. It was excellent for sharing, but I wouldn't be able to eat even a quarter of it on my own. I think the real stand-out was the chicken, because it was just so unexpectedly good. Regarding desserts, I personally prefer my creme brulees to be in more shallow ramekins and the top layer of carmelized sugar to be thinner. However, really, they were all very good, with my personal favorite being the granite. \n\nIn terms of ambience, the bar area is very dimly lit, but it's completely different in the dining area.

Parking here is a nightmare, but my dad is historically lucky when it comes to parking spots, and we parked right in front of Isa and only paid 1 buck for 30 minutes since parking is free after 6:00 PM on Saturdays.\n\nOur seating was at 5:30 PM (right at opening) so we were able to get 5 dollar happy hour soju cocktails including glasses of wine. The Number Seven with muddled blackberries, lemon, ginger, soju, and splash of champagne is excellent to start your meal off. Isa's menu comes family-style so order a few dishes for the table for everyone to try. On a side note: their bread is delicious. We had the following for 5 people:\n\nLobster broth\nHeirloom tomato salad \nSeared foie gras\nArgentinian sea bass\nSeared sea scallops \nSweetbreads\nMushroom risotto\nDuck breast\n\nDessert: flourless chocolate cake, marscapone huckleberry trifle, creme brulee, affogato\n\nThe lobster broth was pretty flavorful, not heavy at all and came with big pieces of lobster tail meat. Good, but I wasn't wowed. The tomato salad was a great summer dish. The tomatoes were sweet balanced by the feta and basil and arugula. The foie pieces were huge and cooked perfectly, although the custard brioche and peaches were pretty much my favorite parts. The sea bass was kind of dry and flavorless although the potato crust was good. The sauce was a little too salty. Easily forgettable next to the scallops. Perfectly cooked with extremely fresh veggies. Very light. I could have probably eaten it for just my entree. Sweetbreads were flavorful and meaty, but nothing to especially rave about. The mushroom risotto was quite tasty. Cooked beautifully with lots of different kinds of mushrooms and salty, nutty parmesan shavings on top. I wouldn't have minded that as an indulgent entree to myself either. The last dish to come out was the duck and it was worth it. Moist duck with tangy huckleberry sauce with arugula and beets and cheese. You needed to eat them in a perfect bite to get the full amazing experience. Dessert was pleasant. The trifle was a great tangy mix of marscapone cheese, berries, and spiced apple/pears. A light ending to a really decadent meal. The chocolate cake was really fluffy but the gelato was the star of the desserts, especially in the affogato. \n\nOverall, Isa was a great, memorable meal with great service, although some entree misses in my opinion, but everything else was amazing. Cheap, well-made drinks during happy hour and great starter bread were huge pluses. I'd come back just for the foie, scallops, and risotto alone. 5 stars!", "author": "Vinh N."}

The lobster broth was light but incredibly flavorful. I've never had grilled calamari that was so tender to the bite and not at all chewy. The seafood risotto was a beautiful balance of flavors, and not a single bite was overpowered by the flavor of another. \n\nThe close-your-eyes-and-enjoy dish of the evening was the scallops. I have never, ever, ever had scallops so perfect. They weren't huge but the taste was. The buttery sauce glistened on the pearly flesh of the scallop and a sweet bite of salty bacon dressed the dish and the puff of potatoes that the scallops rested on. Just magical. \n\nMy other raves were the waitstaff who were incredibly attentive, cycling through to take our finished plates, the covered patio with heat lamps, and the yummy chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelatto served with a spoon AND a fork. \n\nDon't be put off by he hostess who seems overstressed with an attitude, shes just the gatekeeper meant to ward off annoying tourists who you don't want at the table next to you anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-17", "description": "My wife and I are inveterate zipcoders and seldom dine outside the Mission, and Isa is unlikely to change that.  We had a gift certificate courtesy of her parents, and that gave us the impetus to venture clear across the city for a pre-Valentine's dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were offered the table at the very front of the restaurant, which features side-by-side seating for two, which was nicely romantic, especially as the restaurant was sparsely occupied.  Our first concern was upon seeing the drinks list, which contained soju cocktails.  Not being a bar or restaurant owner, I don't know how hard or expensive it is to get a real liquor license, so I don't know if that's a factor in serving soju, and I imagine that it's more expensive to stock a full bar, but soju is not something I expect to see on the menu at an ostensibly nice restaurant.  Needless to say, we skipped the soju and started off with a couple glasses of bubbly.\n\nIsa's novelty comes from the fact that it is a French restaurant in which the plates are served family-style.  In general, I'm not such a fan of shared plates, but the style works well when there are just two of us.  We started off with baked goat cheese and salmon tartare, both of which were quite good.  The salmon included egg, which was an unusual but not unpleasant taste sensation, and the goat cheese was served with pesto.  Both dishes were delicately flavored, with the goat cheese being more memorable.\n\nWith dinner, we opted for the rack of lamb and flatiron steak.  I believe the steak normally comes with roasted potatoes, but we opted to get it with broccoli with garlic and olive oil.  The broccoli and the lamb's accompanying dish, a mix of eggplant, red peppers, and olives in lamb jus, wound up stealing the show, since both were utterly delicious.  The lamb was rich and flavorful but perhaps a little too gamy, and the steak, while also tasty, arrived lukewarm and got cold too quickly as we tried every component of each dish.\n\nWe moved on to cheese and dessert, with the cheese being a substantial block of bleu, and the dessert being the semifreddo all' amaretto.  I would have preferred a milder cheese or perhaps a selection of two, since the sheer quantity of such a strong cheese was overwhelming.  It did set up a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of dessert, however.  The soju was a problem again at the end of the meal as I would have liked a glass of scotch or calvados, and even the dessert wines were fairly scant in selection.  We were not offered coffee or tea, which takes me to the service.\n\nThe restaurant was mostly uncrowded, with just a few other tables occupied at any point, and the service was appropriately attentive yet somehow distant.  Our waiter was polite but not gracious and seemed either to be unfamiliar with one of the wines we asked about or simply uninterested in providing details about it.  I can't complain, per se, but I was neither offended nor impressed, which is how most of the food made me feel as well.  I would probably not choose to go back of my own accord, but neither would I necessarily seek to dissuade others from going.", "author": "Bitter J."}

Make sure you give yourself some time to find parking as parking is pretty hectic around the area! We made a reservation so we were seated promptly after arriving at Isa. The back patio is absolutely gorgeous! There is an option of sitting indoors or outdoors, but I felt that the indoor setting has a more romantic feel and the outdoor setting is good for gatherings. The ambience is awesome wherever you choose to get seated. I ordered the flat iron steak, which came with zucchini, polenta cake, moutarde verte and bordelaise sauce. I must say that the zucchini was DELICIOUS!..oh my goodness. Yeah, I am still dreaming about them. The steak had a very unique taste with the sauce, and it was very yummy as well.

The food comes in small quantity, and it's meant for sharing as well.  \n\nEach of us ordered 2 dishes, I order the prex fix: started, main and dessert.\nI ordered mussel and flat iron steak, the mussel was a big and the quantity is big for french restaurant.  The taste was unique with wine, tomatoes and onion.  The flat iron steak was ok since I do not like medium rare - I ordered medium. \nMy husband ordered: grill calamari and lamb chop.  The calamari was fantantic with asian mix fusion taste. The portion is pretty big.  The lamb chop according to him was awesome and so tender.  I took a bit ( I do not like lamb) there is a after taste. \n1: lobster soup and seabass.  Soup was good, I can taste the seafood broth on it. Seabass a bit dry but tasty. \n2: asparagus soup and chicken.  Soup is unusual, my MIL loves it. It's so tasty but not too creamy.  Chicken is a bit dry but yummy \n3: Seared scallop and saffron Paella.  I have to say the scallop was perfectly cooked and prepared and mash potatoes was also incredible.  the saffron was a bit fishy. \nWe have 4 dessert: flourless chocolate cake was the best. \nThe bill come out $180 with tax not tips. \n\nOverall, all of us are so happy with the food and the price.", "author": "Naruto G."}

I still love Isa and it is near the top of a short list of fun, inexpensive, and delicious restaurants to visit with a small group of good friends.  Most of the dishes are very tasty and the portions are quite generous for the price, being somewhere between entree and appetizer portions in most restaurants (although closer to entree size).  The foie gras, tartare, and potato-crusted halibut are institutional dishes and the setting is very conducive to gregarious conversation.

Neither the food nor the menu were very inspiring.  Everything tasted pretty run of the mill for SF with no standouts.  The converted garden in the back with the tent was interesting as well.  When we first sat down, it was hot from the heat lamps, but those were turned off and later it became a bit drafty.  \n\nWe came b/c my friend saw somewhere that Mon-Thur there is a special deal of 2 plates for $21.95.  He must have read it wrong, b/c what they do have is a 2-course prix fixe for $24.95.  However, even that is misleading.  Most of the pairings you can do are the \"lesser\" items from the full menu, and when you choose, for example, the butterfish, you need to add $2, so effectively you *might* save 2 bux.  \n\nWhat we had:\n\nCrab salad - generous portion of crab, but the bed of avacado was something creative that didn't really work\nLobster bisque - watery\nButterfish - probably the best item, came wrapped in an interesting paper wrap which I'm not sure is edible, came bundled w/some enoki and other mushrooms\nRack of lamb - the Isa-style prep is to have them medium rare closer to rare.  Surprisingly not gamey, and fairly delicious\nScallops - these were really whatever\nFoie Gras - is California outlawing it? The foie was excessively oily here\n\nService as a whole was pretty decent, the staff was pretty welcoming.  However, that just doesn't make up for the uninspiring food.

The wine, an excellent Syrah/Cab was just $28 - that's a bargain.\nThen the food started, and it was incredible. The plates are rather small (definitely not too small) and \"Isa\" recommends two plates per person - sharing is strongly suggested. The prices per plate range from under $10 to a little above $20.

Oh boy, as soon as the food hit the table we all turned silent and our eyes turn heavenwards. Every single dish was outstanding. We enjoyed impeccable culinary skill.

The variety was just distracting.\n\nMy standards might be a little higher, but I wouldn't take a date here.  Friends, yes, but this place is not reading on the romantic scale.

For the food, we got the crab salad and the salmon carpaccio as our appetizers. For our entrees we ordered the duck and the seared scallops, and foie gras. The desserts we had were the creme brulee and the semifreddo. Everything was absolutely delicious but the stand-outs were the salmon carpaccio, scallops (truffle!!!), and foie gras. Dip the scallops in that truffle sauce and you will immediately have a foodgasm. The foie gras was really different from what i've had before, seared beautifully and it just melts in your mouth. It came with a grilled brioche toast, which gave it a very different and slightly crunchy texture. Personally I preferred to eat them separately, but it's a very unique combination.

The \"Asian fusion\" category has me slightly stumped but loved all the small plates. Parking could have been a nightmare but we lucked out with a meter on the first go around. I suggest cabbing it...\n\nWe had late dinner reservations on a Tuesday and it didn't appear crowded walking into the front room where it was quiet with a dark, cozy ambience. We asked for seats in the back patio, where the loudness startled me at first. Once my ears adjusted and I could hear the waiter - I started to really dig the warm glow from strands of lights scattered about walls and the heat lamps throughout the covered patio.\n\nThe waiter arrived promptly and was very knowledgeable. We got our sparkling water right away...but then just sort of waited.  I started getting antsy and looking around. Bread arrived with soft butter. Can I just say how much I love soft butter that I can spread? [Still waiting]...the boyfriend said it was a cohesive team waiting on us, but I found it odd that the busboy was taking my order because I was making a \"where the hell is my wine?\" face. I used to work at a restaurant myself, so I understand being \"in the weeds\" but after what seemed like forever, I was surprised when we were still waiting on our bordeaux blanc.  Another waiter finally came over, brought it to us (aah refreshing) and magically our food started to crank out.\n\nThe plates were timed perfectly. The BEST ceviche I have ever had. They use a sweet fish that had me scraping the plate with bread to scoop up every last morsel. The dungeness crab cake was creamy and not overpowered by the avocado. We each had an oyster (didn't blow me away but I like the dipping sauce) followed by the corn and potato soup for two. I am a die-hard sushi fan so was skeptical to try cooked butterfish but it was AMAZING - steamed just right, similar to a nicely done sea bass, with of course, a rich butter flavor. But the um, scorched (parchment??) paper was a bit sore on the eyes for presentation.  The scallops were done nicely as well and we rounded out the night with dessert.  \n\nSince there was a little confusion about who our waiter was, I ran into the first waiter, asking him to surprise the boyfriend with a candle in their best dessert. I sat back down, and the second waiter asked if we wanted dessert. My boyfriend ordered the amaretto semi-freddo and I just prayed to two waiters would realize what was going on. A few minutes later, waiter #1 showed up with a fabulous flourless cake and vanilla bean gelato and a candle, the other waiter followed up with the semi-freddo. The eisewine was complimentary for his birthday and delicate and fruity and YUMMY.\n\nSo I love dining out and I hate waiting for my food and especially my for drink. It wasn't the waiter's fault, it was busy (still surprised for a Tuesday?) - I just wish I knew that it was a team style service so I could have anticipated multi-waiters and not ordered two desserts. So 4 stars as the food was FANTASTIC, I just don't like to wait. But would definitely recommend - especially to a couple as the lighting was quite romantic :)", "author": "Amanda B."}

Indeed the food is as good as it gets! I shall say though their dessert are their weak points...\n\nSince we went on Monday, we decided to have the prix fix menu which is $29 per person and is only available Monday through Thursday. We ordered salmon Carpaccio and grilled calamari as our first courses. Both of them are delicious and we are so satisfied after each dish. \n\nFor our 2nd courses, we first had the flat iron steak--it came with roasted zucchini and polenta cake. All of them are so well prepared that we love this dish. The zucchini is tender while very juicy. By the end of this dish, we were almost full even though none of the dish look a lot.  The our second order: the TRUFFLE RISOTTO came. It was the best risotto that I have ever had! It was very creamy and full of mushroom flavor that we could not stop eating it!! \n\nAfter these dishes, we ordered our dessert. But like I said, their dessert is their weak point. There were not too many options so we ordered Bucherondin De Ch\u00e8vre and Grapefruit granite. The honey and walnut that came with the goat cheese is very good but both of us are not big fan of goat cheese--it is probably our mistake to order this one. The grapefruit granite is just regular shredded ice with grapefruit flavor. Given that both of us had a cold that night, we did not enjoy it too much. \n\nOverall, even though I am disappointed by their dessert (but I have not had a very satisfactory experience with any dessert in the restaurants in the city!) I am still giving them a five star as their food are indeed well made and the price came very sweet at $65 total (we also ordered a hot tea). \n\nWe will definitely come back for their truffle risotto!", "author": "Jasmine C."}

I still dont understand what this sweetbread is... but it came with pieces of veal mixed with lots of delicious mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and a hashbrown on top. The veal was really tender and I really felt like it melted in my mouth mmmmmm. (i love baby cow) Also I got this scallop dish served with asparagus which was quite tasty as well. The scallops had a lot of flavor, not bland like I'm used to them being.  I would recommend both of these dishes! \nI also really liked the flat iron steak (surprisingly juicy and well marinated) and this halibut special (cooked so it was half raw in the middle - yum!). My friend ordered the bouillabaisse and she seemed to like it ,but i'm not really a fan. I was not pleased with the duck breast though... it was too sweet with what it was served with (red cabbage and some other strange berry?) \nAnyways, the waiter forgot to put one of our orders in so he gave us free desserts and I was VERY pleased. Creme brulee, this grapefruit icy thing, and a hot brownie thing with vanilla ice cream. all of them were REALLY GOOD. \nBefore 7 they have happy hour so their soju cocktails are $5 and glasses of wines are $5 as well. We ordered a bottle of sparkling wine for $25.

The restaurant has a very nice dimly lit ambiance and the backroom, which seems to be like the backyard patio area, was more open and had heaters.  I had planned out the menu with Kitty (coordinator at Isa) and we had agreed on how ever many plates to choose for my group of 10.  She was very attentive and accomodating in our emails back and forth as well as when we arrived.  Thank you Kitty!  \n\nAlso keep in mind that they suggest a family style type serving which I think worked out really good for our group.  Everyone got to try the food and hint: sitting in the middle is awesome since you don't have to share as much haha.  Each dish supposedly serves 3-4 people.  And for the amount of food we had, the price was fair.  You get what you pay for, and in this case, a little higher price gets you a great meal.\n\nOnto the food, which I'm still picturing vividly in my head:\n-Crab salad - MUST GET.  it may look simple, but crab meat is bountiful and its definitely a good starter\n-Mussels - If you like mussels, this is a go getter as the sauce is also really good with the bread.\n-Foie Gras - I was hesitant on getting too much of this, but it appears everyone enjoyed it with its tenderness and flavor.  Hudson Valley Foie gras, you are too good.  and Isa, great job on putting it with the poached pear sauce.  \n-Scallop with Asparagus - Scallops were huge and moist.  the mashed mashed potatoes (yes its double mash because it was almost as if it was pureed) was nice and light\n-Bouiillebaise - It was almost like a repeat of the mussels, but it had clam, fish, and squid...but I think the mussels were better\n-Flat Iron Steak - tender with a nice creamy wasabi sauce\n-Truffle risotto - nice and creamy with plenty of truffle flavor, helps get you full too.  hah\n-Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato - great great great\n-Grapefruit Granite - It was ok, but at least it was something lighter\n-Vanilla Creme Brulee - pretty tasty, but sort of heavy\n-Ameretto - although this was the most hesitant one, it turned out to be really good.\n\nAnd there you have it, the maginificant meal we had for my birthday.

I thought the strawberry paired with it was very interesting, but the thought of eating goose liver stopped me from enjoying it fully. So my friend ended up eating the rest. We then proceeded to the mussels and I was disappointed in the flavor of the mussels. It tasted like it was boiled with no taste at all. Our entrees were truffle risotto and scallops with orzo.

Give my food and the check in a reasonable amount of time, and have a few opinions about the food, and I'm happy. But the service last night at ISA was horrible.\n\nMy folks and I had a reservation for 9:00 p.m. We got there at 9:00 p.m., and the hostess said it would be five minutes. We waited 45 minutes, with perhaps one half-assed apology after 40 minutes. (And when you're waiting at ISA, there's virtually nowhere to stand where you're not in the way, and the bar area has all of four or five seats total.)\n\nWhen we sat down, in a cool, chill way, I explained to the waiter that we had waited 45 minutes and that my folks had to stand the whole time, etc. The waiter, to this credit, was sympathetic, but that was it. I ordered a calamari to eat while we looked at the menu. Instead, a persimmon salad arrived. I sent it  back, explaining we didn't order it. The busboy looked confused, but he took the salad and returned to the kitchen. Then, the waiter arrived and explained that the kitchen had sent this out as a token of their thanks for our waiting.\n\nOne little salad that no one would have ordered anyway? And the waiter couldn't explain that himself when they brought it out?\n\nOkay, so we ordered. Then, the waiter said that since that persimmon salad didn't work out, he would us comp a beer. One beer, like five bucks. Whatever. We ordered. The food was good, particularly the calamari. But the portions are small. We're talking 6 scallops on an entree plate. \n\nWhen the check came, they had put the persimmon salad on the bill. \n\nI could go on, but I think you're getting where I'm going with this.", "author": "Chris H."}

Hopefully, you'll feel better once you enter because the ambiance in this restaurant is excellent; it's very cozy and intimate. \n\nCame here on a Friday evening so we didn't get to eat from their fixed price menu. They recommend 2 plates per person and everything is meant to be shared \"family style\" but don't expect Buca di Beppo portions. Each plate is perfect for sharing between 4-5 people and everyone gets a piece or so. Not entirely sure on how I feel about the prices. They seemed high for some of the items and portions that my group decided to order but they don't call it French for nothing. They screw you when you're in their country and still screw you when you're in your own. Lose-lose.\n\n Their \"larger\" (small) plates were about $18-$25 each while their \"smaller plates\" (even smaller) plates were about $10-$15. The bread may have been the winner here, as was the halibut. Everything else (scallops, salmon tartare, and shrimp especially) was just run of the mill average but the service was very good. \n\n5 girls eating, filled mostly on bread and having ordered no alcohol, had a bill that was about $165 with tip.\n\nEdited:  I'm bringing down the star rating to 3 instead of a 4. Received a comment in response to my review from the chef/owner almost immediately (which he has since deleted) which really left a bad taste in my mouth as far as attitude goes. I appreciate that he checks Yelp out and reads feedback on the restaurant. A lot of people don't and that is probably what keeps them from their ultimate success in running a business or a restaurant for that matter. There's always an opportunity to improve and to use feedback to see how things are going. Instead, his comments made me uncomfortable. I was originally planning on bringing my husband to try the restaurant, but after having read the comment (and some below responding to other users) myself and a friend decided to not go back. The response was not professional or handled well in my opinion. With that said, I've been contacted by other owners and employees of establishments about my reviews and they have always been pleasant, regardless of what review I gave them.\n\nEdited 5/9/2009: I'm glad you decided to change and re-word your previously rude comments. \n\nAnyway, my last thought is that price is subjective. It should be respected. If you call anything less than a 5 star rating \"being stepped on\" because users are voicing their honest opinions which you may not agree with, then Yelp is not the place for you.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

I revisited the restaurant recently for dinner and ordered a bunch of plates to share.  We ordered the following items:\n\n- Salmon tartar w/creme fraiche, capers, lemon and more: lots of flavors but it worked well together.\n- Tuna tartar: pretty tasty loaded with avocados and nori sprinkles.  Good.\n- Lettuce salad: From what I remember, I thought this salad was quite good. It was served in a lettuce cup.\n- Foie gras served with brioche and apricots: my fav dish of the night. Grilled and juicy just the way I like.\n- Spaghetti: Was not bad but not memorable.\n- Sweetbread with green beans and mashed potato: Something I wouldn't typically order but I thought it was pretty good especially since it was fried. \n- Roasted rack of lamb: Not too gamy which was good since I can't handle anything too gamy.  I thought the temperature and texture were very good.\n- Duck breast w/a berry sauce and arugula, beets and goat cheese salad on the side: The duck was also prepared at a good temperature and texture and again not too gamy.  I really enjoyed the side salad!\n- Creme brulee: Good but nothing special.\n- Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream: absolutely delicious. Almost like a souffle with a gooey center, but fluffy cake...perfect combo w/the ice cream and not too sweet.  The only thing was that we had two orders of this dessert and one was not completely cooked so the entire dish was a bit gooey while the other was perfect.  When we mentioned it, the server was willing to bring out another order but we were all stuffed so we didn't get another.  They ended up giving us a glass of port which I thought was nice of them.\n\nI'd say overall the service was pretty good.  The only thing that bothered me a bit was that the waiter was a little pushy when we were putting in our order.  But otherwise, I thought the service was fine.\n\nLastly, I really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant.  It's definitely a cute, romantic little restaurant.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Normally on restaurant week, I try to go to more expensive places so that the promotion seems more worth it, so I normally wouldn't go to places like Isa that are cheaper than the restaurant week promotion. However, contrary to my initial beliefs, I found that most of the more expensive places tended to dull down their Restaurant Week menu and choose the cheapest ingredients (including Supper Club, Cortez, and Foreign Cinema) but Isa, coming from a different end of the price point, certainly did live up to the occasion.

The food is some of the best in the city!\n\nSo why am I giving it only three stars?  It's those heat lamps in the back that cause me the most dismay.  Every time I've been there my table is in constant competition with other tables over the heat.  The lamps get turned up high and we're roasting, so we ask to turn it way down.  Then before we know it, the heat gets jacked up again!  Perhaps its that table of Marina Muffys dressed for the clubs and showing off the 'girls', or the table behind us packed with Haight street expatriates in their thread-bare T-shirts (don't those tatoos keep them warm?).

As it was DAT season, my friends and I gathered here for what ended up being part engagement celebration dinner, part congrats on getting a job dinner.  We got there a bit early, so we went to a bar around the corner for a drink, but first we wanted to drop off a few bottles of wine and bubbly to celebrate the occasion.  The hostess and wait staff was super helpful in getting things chilled and stashed until we returned for dinner.  \n\nWhen we returned, we were seated quickly in the back patio.  The seating is a bit cramped, but the ambiance is definitely lively and energetic and having a conversation wasn't really an issue.  However, if you're looking for a quieter more intimate atmosphere, you may be served better with another place.\n\nWhen our waiter arrived, it was like he was welcoming us into his home and just having us over for a nice dinner.  He took great care in explaining the philosophy of the restaurant, how people tend to order, which were the popular dishes and the specials.  He certainly made things sound fantastic and we basically bought it hook line and sinker.  Most of us that did order from the DAT menu also got something else in addition since he made everything sound quite appetizing.  From the DAT menu I chose the salmon carpaccio, the bouillabaisse and the blue cheese plate, and then on top of that I added the foie gras which was a steal.  \n\nIt was suggested that we share the plates tapas style, which we did, so I was able to taste A LOT of different dishes. The carpaccio was sweet and fresh tasting.  The bouillabaisse was far superior to the one I had only a few days before at a Peruvian place in the city.  This time, the seafood was cooked perfectly, the broth a beautiful balance of sweetness of the seafood and the brightness of tomatoes and acid.  It was a really well executed dish.  The foie gras was fantastic; a perfectly caramelized slab of buttery goodness.   The blackberry compote that paired with it balanced well with the richness of the foie gras.  I also was able to taste a roasted prawn dish, as well as some of the best mussels that I've ever eaten.  The mussels were perfectly cooked and the white wine butter sauce it was served with was simply divine.  I could have drowned in that sauce and been perfectly content.  The desserts were also very well done.  Overall my meal there was just superb and the service excellent.  It's pretty safe to assume that I'll be returning here again.", "author": "Gary L."}

We walked in at 7:45, ordered a round of drinks from the bar and before we could go for round two a table on the rear patio was ready for us. \n\nThe bar drinks are wonderfully different, not your standard fare. For dinner we split a few plates as is recommended. Started with the oysters, always delicious; then moved on to the heirloom salad which was their special. The tomatoes were fresh and delicious and the compliment of arugula and basil made it very refreshing. We then moved on to the potato wrapped seabass which was amazing. The compliment of the salty potato wrap and the light fluffy flavor of the fish were outstanding (my fav dish by far). We ended with the lamb which was very good, but in my opinon the seabass dwarfs its flavor. For dessert we ordered creme brulee which was average as I like to taste a bit more vanilla and custard, however not sub-par by any means.

We ordered a wide variety of things including sweetbreads, the crab salad, mussels in a tomato-based broth, the flat iron steak, and a delicious chocolate flourless dessert.

I was impressed with the flavors of all the courses and felt more than satisfied for the $34.95 prix fixe pricing. The duck breast, served with bacon, spinach, and currants was cooked perfectly and was delicious. The deal sealer for this restaurant was the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Hands down, one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life! The dark chocolate cake (almost a souffle) was flavored with a hint of citrus and was a slice of pure heaven!

BUT. i am always one to find a silver lining: the cabbie that we ended up getting was by far the most hilarious cabbie i have ever met. he srsly made me laugh the whole ride home. so i cannot, in good faith, take off a star because it worked out quite well.\n\ni would love to come back to isa. it was one of the best meals i have had in sf.", "author": "Jason B."}

Their idea of serving food family style seems to mean that the kitchen can send out dishes whenever. When our first course came out, three of us got our food and the fourth person, who ordered soup, got his about 10 minutes later. His main course arrived when he was about 1/2 done with his soup. Two more main courses arrived about 15 minutes later, with the final one arriving about 25 minutes after the first.\r\n\r\nThe final straw came when one of our party went to the restroom and a waitress took his chair and moved it to another table.

Interesting.\n\nWe were greeted by the server, who quickly brought the menus, then decided to take a mini vacation in the back of the restaurant while he left us with rounds of bread. \n\nWe finally got his attention, and ordered the appetizers. The calamari was delicious and the goat cheese plate was equally as good. We quickly followed this up with our main plates, while we had the waiter available. We ordered: The chicken, duck, lamb and paella. The waiter then disappeared and waited a good 40 minutes before bringing us our dishes. When we asked him if our food was almost ready, he quickly brushed us off and said \"well, food takes awhile to cook, but I guess I could ask the Chef.\" Wow. Thank you for the wise words! The dishes were overall good, but not great. The duck and the lamb were the tables favorites.\n\nOverall, the food is decent, the atmosphere is your typical marina restaurant (after it's prime), but the service....oh the service....If I was able to provide a rating for the food and the service individually, the food would get 2.5/3 and the service .5, maybe 1 star (I am feeling more generous now that I was able to settle my stomach with dessert, from elsewhere).", "author": "SandJ C."}

My friend and I had just picked up some cupcakes at Kara's in the Marina and wanted to grab dinner. We thought tapas would be fun and a quick search on Yelp for a tapas restaurant on the Blackberry turned up Isa. \n\nThe restaurant is very small and intimate when you walk in, with only a few tables in sight. They have a covered patio in the back with more tables and it's very cute. We proceeded to order a Tomales Bay Miyagi Oyster on the Half Shell each, Maine Lobster Broth, Spicy Local Tuna Crudo, Seared Foie Gras, and Baked Fish. (We were hungry, OK? Besides, the waiter recommended that we order 2 plates per person.) We started with the oyster, which was seasoned with citrus vinegar and topped with tobiko. It was good but not too unique. The lobster broth was very light and flavorful, but I wasn't necessarily impressed until the foie gras came out. It was one of the best piece of foie gras I've had - tender, juicy, seared to perfection. And to top that off, the brioche that accompanied it was crispy and delicious, almost better than the foie gras itself (hard to imagine!) The rest of the meal went by in a blur (the tuna and the fish were both good but not memorable) because all I could think about was the foie gras. Hmmm, let me take a moment to reminisce about the foie gras again... OK, I'm back. When the waiter came by to ask if we wanted any desserts, we said, \"Can you bring us another order of foie gras?\" \n\nI've been back to Isa many more times since and have tried many things on their menu. My favorite - can you guess? - the foie gras of course! I've also discovered other dishes that are really good, such as the Seared Dayboat Scallops, which comes with a creamy potato puree topped with a truffle infused sauce. Yum!

If anyone should read my other reviews, sometimes I mark 4 stars for a 3.5 review, sometimes 3.  I choose based on what the current overall rating is. \r\nThere were some good dishes tonite - the potato wrapped bass was innovative and tasty, the thin-thin potato shell edges having turned crisp on baking while the bass remained moist.  The spicy tuna tartare - it was good as well, but it wasn't at all spicy. The lamb and flatiron steak were both well prepared, but not particularly unique.  Then there were some oddly plain dishes - vegetable medley?? Todd E. hit the mark when he said 'anytime you see medley it's not a good thing'.  We are at the peak of tomato season right now, and tonite's heirloom tomato salad, just didn't seem all that. Perhaps the dressing was too overwhelming? I dunno. And they burned the creme brulee. For shame. FOR SHAME!\r\nThe vegetable small plates started at $8-11, the seafood items~$13-17, the richer poultry/meats were in the upwards of $18.

Sure, its a fun idea and allows you to really sample the menu, but I'm a very selfish eater. I know what I order is going to be good and I don't want to share. Luckily, at Isa, everything is so good that you don't have to be concerned about coming with a non foodie and having your meal ruined by their below par selection.\nThe scallops were my favorite but to my dismay, they took those with the potatoe puree off the menu and replaced them with another scallop dish that had an edamame bok choy thing going on or something. Didn't sound nearly as appealing. \nThe al dente spagetti with truffles, fresh tomatoes, and basil is amazing! It doesn't sound all that exciting but they really load the truffles on this thing. So good.\nThe big surprise of the night on our last visit was the special, which was sweet breads! When do you ever see these babies on a menu... (practically never if that wasnt clear). Personally I don't trust sweet breads unless its my grandma thats making them at home, so I passed, but my friend braved it and was thoroughly impressed. Great sign of a quality restaurant if they can pull that off.\nAppetizers - oysters, goat cheese, lobster broth - all solid.\nThe back patio makes for an amazing date setting, so romantic (if you're into that sort of thing).\n\nThe only beef I have with the place is that if you aren't sitting in the back patio, and get stuck in the front, the place can get incredibly cramped and stuffy. And they seem like they overbook reservations pretty frequently. So even if you have rez's for 8:30, don't come starving, because theres a good chance you won't be seated till 9.", "author": "Taylor E."}

We went at 7:30pm on a Saturday, and the place was a madhouse. We were seated on the patio but immediately decided we couldn't bare to sit out there - crowded, HOT (heat lamps everywhere) and two tables with screaming children. I know the children were not fault of the restaurant, but you should be aware that the patio is the furthest thing from enchanting - in this case it was unbearable. And you should be aware that Isa is apparently a place that people think is appropriate for infants (and think it's fine to have them screaming at the table). \nMy BF wanted to leave immediately but I convinced him to eat at a teeny spot at the side bar. The food was generally very good (they sure love parsley, which I dislike immensely, but otherwise it was tasty), but the scene was just too chaotic. Part of the problem was my expectation for a refined, romantic experience - not at all the case. Would be a good spot for a loud, group dinner (bring your megaphone). The wine list extremely low priced - I was a little worried about the quality but to their credit it was fine.

Getting water, getting refills of water = huge challenge. We had to race down our server half the time. At one point the lady bought over one of our dishes and we asked if we asked her about the serving sizes and if we could add one more tomato or bring dishes out with 5 of items instead of 4 (there were 5 of us) and she snapped at us and told us we could cut it ourselves. The servers were rushed so they would just throw down plates meaning half the serving utensils were sitting in sauce before we even touched them.\nWould I come back? For the food...yes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-18", "description": "Delicious.  Delicious.  Did I mention, delicious?  \n\nWe went to Isa on Tuesday of this week to celebrate a friend's promotion and we were not disappointed.  I have to admit, however, after reading some reviews on opentable.com, I was a bit nervous about our dining experience; the timing of the dishes kept coming up as a concern.\n\nThe experience starts with the location of Isa.  It is located in the Chestnut/Fillmore area and I was reminded of how much of a gem this area is.  Tuesday night was the 2nd night of the heatwave so it was a gorgeous night.  \n\nWe were taken care of by Dean, a lovely, lovely man, and he walked us through the optimal dining experience by basically explaining their vision and offering his assistance in choosing our dishes.  We agreed to choose 2 dishes p/person, making that 8 dishes total.  The first half of the menu is what you would consider lighter, appetizer fare, and the second half of the menu are the heavier dishes.  Their vision: that each dish is shared and that each dish is served after finishing the previous dish.  \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\nFirst half of the menu: Spicy Tuna Tartare (recommended), Dungeness Crab Salad (recommended; the grapefruit paired well with the crab salad), Seared Grade A Foie Gras (didn't try), and a Seafood Ceviche (forgive me as I've forgotten what fish was used in the ceviche)(highly recommended if you like ceviche).\n\nSecond half of the menu: Baked Butterfish in Paper (highly recommended. fish melted in your mouth.  flavors worked well together), Caramelized Dayboat Scallops, King trumpet, Morel &amp; Shiitake Mushroom Risotto (recommended), and a Seafood Risotto (highly recommended).\n\nReally, everything we ordered was delicious.  \n\nTheir wine list included areas such as California, Italy, Oregon, South Africa, New Zealand, and Spain!  I appreciate that the wine menu was inclusive of different areas/countries, and that it wasn't an overwhelming list of choices.\n\nThe timing of the dishes was... impeccable.  At one point, we had 3 of our lighter fare on the table and it was after our 4th dish that the next 4 dishes, the heavier fare, came after the previous was finished.  I was impressed.  Once our table was cleared of a dish, the next one came within a minute or two, and it arrived piping hot so it was obvious to us that it hadn't been sitting around.  I still am impressed.  And may I just say that I appreciate their vision, although I know it isn't for everyone, and I agree with Dean's sentiments that bringing one dish out at a time really encourages you, and allows you the rare opportunity to enjoy, savor and appreciate the food/dish for what it is.  You take your time because there is only one dish on the table.  You are more prone to talk about it's flavors and what your thoughts are as you work your way through the dish.  You are less prone to eating at a fast pace.    \n\nDining at Isa is such an experience that speaks beyond eating out, I think it talks to life, in general.  It sort of reminds you to slow down sometimes, as cliche as it sounds, regardless of your daily grind.  It reminds you that food is nourishing, and that eating should be a positive experience for all involved. \n\nSo I raise my glass to Luke Sung for his vision and execution; I really do feel the commitment, hardwork, and love.  I also raise my glass to Dean, and his support staff, for taking such good care of us, and for making it an unforgettable night.\n\nI will DEFINITELY be returning to try the other half of the menu!", "author": "Desiree V."}

We arrived right after two other couples and were seated at a tiny table for two , in a tight squeeze right between the other couples.  It was like we were having a triple date with people we didn't know, or want to talk to.  It was awkward how much of everyone's conversation we over heard (the couple to my right was arguing about how much they were going to spend per head at their upcoming wedding... they left early wrapping up untouched food and left a half bottle of $50 wine!).  To my girlfriend's right was a woman who was loud and annoying b/c she spoke so loud over the din of the room.\n\nOK, so the waiter was French or something and carried a bit of an attitude for no reason,   I wanted the foie gras and my girlfriend inquired about the wine pairing that was suggested on the menu for her first drink.  The waiter said that was a dessert wine, as though she was supposed to know that... Well why is a dessert wine paired with an appetizer! A-Hole! \n(sorry)\nAs she went to look for something else to drink, he was pretty unhelpful with the wine list.  He ended up suggesting something she didn't like- and I got stuck with it.\n\nFOOD:  The asparagus soup was really good, light and with a citrus zest in the undertones.  The foie gras was AMAZING!  the brioche and accompanying white peaches made for one of the better foie gras dishes we have tried.  I ordered the the butterfish which was baked with  shitaki mushrooms- it was light, flavorful and also quite good.  Nothing fancy, but a simply, flavor-filled dish that was light.  My girlfriend ordered the duck.  At first bite it was the sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the duck, but in a really good way.  But as the sauce dissipated  you could taste that the duck was slightly over cooked and it left a gammie taste.  Dessert was creme Brulee- nothing special at all, rather flat and cold as ice in the center- booooo.\n\nIN THE END:\nwhen all was said and done, the food was good enough, but nothing like what I expected.  The atmosphere was too loud, i felt a bit like a sardine in a nosy room with no music.  The check didn't bother me, but I was ready to go once the dessert was half done.  I would go back to give it another try, but no time soon- too many other places to try!", "author": "Don D."}

We ordered the dungeness crab salad, but I don't know if the grapefruit complemented the seafood flavor very well. The salmon carpaccio was refreshingly tasty. We also split the asparagus soup which was smooth and delicious with just a hint of mint (?).  For entrees, we ordered the halibut, which was a little more raw in the center than we'd like, but it had a nice sear topped with perfectly cooked  and seasoned green beans and  sweet fresh corn. I decided to order the pan seared chicken, which had a  nice layer of herbs stuffed under a succulent crispy skin. I like white meat, so I expected the breast to be a little dry, however the pan sauce it comes with definitely compensated, as did the ultra creamy mashed potatoes. We ended by splitting the flourless chocolate cake with gelato--not as dense and rich as others I've tried; not bad, just  reminded me more of a very airy souffle, actually.  \n\nAttentive service, sleek ambiance, unpretentious crowd of all ages, good value.", "author": "Jen S."}

I rarely ever hang out in the Marina so I figured it was about time I checked it out.  \n\nWe (a party of 4) were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation.  Our waiter was very attentive and kept the water and bread refilled.  \n\nEach of us ordered off of the special Dine about Town menu.  I chose the tuna and avocado tartar and the maple leaf duck breast.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee.  Each dish was well done and smelled delicious.  The one dish that smelled even better than mine was the seared scallops with asparagus and truffle mash potatoes.  Other dishes that didn't disappoint were the lobster Bouillabaisse and the goat cheese dish.  However, I heard that the flank steak was cut a little too think, which made it tough to chew and the sauce was too salty.\n\nThe total with tax and tip came out to about $46 per person.  Pricey, but at least it was tasty.  There is nothing worse than paying a lot and getting nothing for my bucks.  It makes me mad.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

A friend had wanted to celebrate his birthday in this restaurant, and we didn't realize how much of a treat we are all in for. The staff is super professional, especially the waiter that suggested how we should approach the menu. The meal itself was on the expensive side, however, worth every penny.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-21", "description": "We used to live down the street from here and went once for dinner, had great food, and never went back. For the life of me I couldn't tell you why, as we went back to places where we weren't wild about the food. I'm thinking it's because it's not casual enough to be a neighborhood regular but maybe not nice enough to feel like a special date night? Not really sure!\nAnyway went Friday night. We couldn't think of anywhere to go, they had availability on Opentable, so I looked up their menu and it sounded appealing. From when we got there it was a bit of a nightmare. We had thought, we'll get there a little early and check in for our reso - if they have room for us we'll sit down early and if not we'll have a drink at the bar or at a nearby wine bar. It was PACKED, and with people that were a bit rude and annoying - the kind that shove you without saying \"excuse me\" and that try to cram up next to you at the hostess stand to make sure they get to talk to you next - it won't get them seated any earlier!!! At least we managed to squeeze up to the bar and get a glass of wine. The hostess was so swamped she spoke to us in three- or four-word phrases. \"You have a reservation?\" Exits. \"We'll seat you.\" Walks away. We realize that time she meant for us to follow.\nThe experience didn't improve all that much with the waiter - he asked if we wanted sparkling water, which we did, but he brought flat. He let us know that our appetizers and entrees wouldn't come at the same time, their kitchen is small so things come out when they're ready - which I understand for a group but seems odd for 2 people?\nBut. The food was awesome. I was so happy with my meal - the lobster broth and the crispy skin chicken, amazing. And my husband loved his warm goat cheese starter and steak. The menu also seemed to have something for everyone - a lot of the choices sounded appealing to me - a salmon tartare, a baked Butterfish entree, those I definitely want to try on future visits. And if you'd been out drinking the vibe in there might be kind of fun. And the back patio looked awesome.\nI think we'll definitely be back this time, if only for that chicken - but now I'm kind of thinking maybe the service was why we didn't come back the first time. Something about the experience must have left a bad taste in our mouths that we just don't remember. But I don't think we'll let it stop us this time. As long as you know what you're walking into, the food is fantastic. Oh - and with how close the tables are together - if you like listening in on other people's conversations, this is your spot! :-)", "author": "Sarah R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-07", "description": "At 4:30 on a Saturday (a holiday weekend, no less), my sister and I decided that she should treat O. and me to a special dinner that night. Jumping at the opportunity to partake in great dining at another's expense, I cracked open my laptop and got to searching for a place that would be special yet marginally affordable. I came across Isa, a French-Contemporary restaurant that welcomed us.\nInside the restaurant, one is greeted with sounds of conversation, hues of red, and warm, delicious aromas. To my sister and me, anyway-- O.'s disdain for anything from the sea got him apprehensive about the place, as there was a faint smell of fish going around (their halibut is popular, is the only way I could ease my thoughts). That unpleasant tidbit aside, the atmosphere is vibrant and congenial but at the same time sophisticated. We were seated immediately after checking in, which was impressive given that we had come in fifteen minutes past the time I had reserved.\nOnce seated, our waiter, who was personable and consummately attentive, placed our menus on the table and got our drinks started. He explained to us how Isa serves up their entrees family-style. We took this to mean that the portions would be large and beamed at the pleasant surprise.\nOnce seated, I was disappointed to find an utter lack of the potato-wrapped halibut promised as Isa's specialty on its website, which was what I had used to lure my sister to this place. Discouraged but optimistic, we ordered the halibut nonetheless, with capers, artichokes, and zucchini. We also tried the spaghetti with crushed black truffles in a basil-tomato broth ($13.50) and the mushroom risotto ($15.50), and for the appetizers an heirloom tomato salad ($8.50) and leek and corn soup ($6 for one; $8.50 for two. Isa was kind enough to split the soups three ways).\nWe had the privilege of sitting by  the kitchen, which divides the front portion of the restaurant (where we were) from the back (more formal, but we were looking for casual), where we could see the finishing touches put on all of the plates. The kitchen seemed to operate smoothly throughout the night, evidenced by the rate at which the food came to our table. Before and in between dishes, our basket was refilled with delicious, piping-hot bread (not sourdough!).\nFirst came the soup. The sweetness and robustness of corn was fully captured and the fragrance from the leek brightened this wonderful dish. However, this brought up the one theme that played consistently throughout the night: a lack of salt in the dishes, a caveat that may perhaps be unnecessary to most who don't like as much of it, but I was alarmed at how seriously this soup was lacking in sodium. As part of the decor Isa puts out a small wooden dipping bowl filled with sea salt at every table. I dressed my soup with much of it and sprinkled a smidge onto the heirloom tomato salad, which would have been spectacular even without the extra touch of salt. They were the sweetest tomatoes I had ever tasted, enhanced by the balsamic and offset by the tangy feta and peppery arugula.\nRemembering our waiter's claim that everything was served family-style, we stopped for a minute to look at the tiny plate before us. But the heady aroma of the basil soon took over, and we were able to ignore the size of the dish to rather just enjoy its flavors.\nI think the spaghetti, aside from the tomatoes, was my favorite. The pasta was perfectly al dente, something that I can never achieve myself (I always tend to go under). The truffles were not applied too liberally so as to be obnoxious, and I had never had them served any other way than shaved, which was an interesting experience. The basil tomato broth at the bottom was light and fragrant, salted and thickened slightly by parmigiano reggiano. A heavenly combination, and surprisingly the plate turned out to hold more than we had originally thought.\nO. winced and ate the last of the spaghetti as slowly as he could as my sister and I devoured the fish. It was cooked to perfect consistency, with a lovely, crisp crust, but I felt that, again, it was underseasoned and perhaps too fishy. Artichokes were soft and the capers were nice little balls of salty punch, but the zucchini, being undersalted, did little to enhance the dish.\nThe risotto was the most disappointing. It came goopy with bits of mushroom, which ranks at the top of my favorite foods. I could not, however, enjoy this dish. We expected a parmigiano garnish but the cheese was far too pungent to be so; it was probably pecorino. The extreme sharpness of the cheese against the blank slate of  the risotto was not a winning combination.\nDespite what I said about the risotto and the fact that the food is undersalted, I loved Isa! The ambiance is spectacular; the service was truly exceptional; and the food, despite the lack of salt, packs in a flavorful punch. Just make sure to put the little wooden bowl to good use.", "author": "Nuri K."}

The flat iron steak is also ridiculously delicious, though I felt like the specific preparation and level of quality is something I have had at other places.  Service is quite good, but certainly not on the level of a fine dining establishment.

I'm especially forgiving for a trendy restaurant with wonderful service. On first impression, this restaurant was not only not as trendy and cute as mamacita or bin 38 next door but extremely pretentious. However, things picked up nicely - we rapidly got drinks while we waited for our reservation, we were seated at an adorable table, and the entire wait staff was attentive. Food is meant to be shared and I suppose you could call it tapas-style. 4 dishes for a dinner for 2 is perfect. I strongly recommend the seared scallops with butternut squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, and bacon. BACON! who doesn't love a little bacon? The potato wrapped seabass was fantastic and the truffle risotto was served hot and mouth-watering. But be forewarned, the rack of lamb is NOT good. There's good lamb that has the appropriate amount of herbs and spices to cover up that gamey smell and then there's lamb that tastes WAY too much like lamb. Good thing creme brulee fixes everything. Creme brulee and a very large mojito....So overall, I'd say Isa was 3.5 stars and decent for a Saturday night dinner, but I bet the happy hour during the week could make it 4 stars.", "author": "Alisa A."}

Yet the prices are phenomenally outrageous, so your normal-sized salad (3 plates or so) would cost $24. Also, when I ordered the \"veggie\" options of risotto and asparagus soup, I was told both used chicken stock. Why, people? What's wrong w/veggie stock, a little olive oil, and some salt? Tastes the same. Really. We're in California, not some backwards country like Florida. Wine list is great, as are desserts (which are normal-sized all on their own).

Came here for a date, and ended up at the cozy little table for two in the front. Cute spot.\n\nI'd checked out the menu before coming here because I wanted to be prepared, but when I arrived, the number of yummy options made my head spin.  I ended up ordering from the prix fixe menu (quite a bargain at $22), and my date did the same.  I chose the baked goat cheese with tomatoes and pine nuts and my date picked the asparagus soup for the first course.  The goat cheese was soft and warm and the combination of tomatoes, olive oil, pine nuts, and spices complemented it perfectly.  Nothing overpowered anything else, and it just melted in your mouth.  The asparagus soup was extraordinary - just salty enough, not too asparagus-y, and not the least bit bitter, as asparagus can sometimes be.   I was a little surprised to see that the food was served family style (kind of weird to share a bowl of soup with someone you don't know all that well), but I don't really mind that sort of thing, so it was alright.\n\nFor the second course, I ordered the seafood pasta, which was fabulous - a totally different kind of noodle than I've ever had before, and it was cooked just right.  The tomatoes and arugula were really nice, and the calamari, shrimp and mussels were perfect - not overcooked at all.  As good as all that was, nothing compared to the paella.  Now, I've lived in Spain (for a year and a half total), so I know good and bad paella.  I've had weird fusiony paella way too many times here in the states, and I'm always reluctant to order it (even at most Spanish restaurants) ESPECIALLY when the word \"fusion\" is attached to the restaurant.  This paella, on the other hand, was perfect.  Just the right amount of saffron, great seafood, and even lima beans (most places wouldn't even dare!).  Eaten with a piece of bread, it was like being back in Spain in my flamenco teacher's dad's restaurant.

Due to this fact, the entry way got extremely full, since everyone was trying to check in for their reservation. Get bumped and pushed in a restaurant by people trying to check in, is no way to start your birthday celebration. When the hostesses finally came, they checked in people one at a time, then would run off and leave the hostess station again! WTF! Its a Friday night! The restaurant entry is packed with people, and you are just going to leave them hanging???? \nWhen we finally got seated, our waiter gave us menus and began explaining the menu in great detail, which was very appreciated. However, he began to attend to the other tables around us, and didn't come back for 15minutes. My friends and I were STARVING at this point; we ate all the bread in the bread basket and still nothing from our waiter. Finally my friend had to track him down when he was in between tables to remind him that we had not ordered yet. Then he was trying to push us to order 6 plates for 3 people. When we only ordered 5 plates, he was so insistent that we order 6. Seriously, we do not need to be forced to eat, if we want to order more, we will! \n\nThe only saving grace for Isa is its food.

The black cod in paper was very good, especially because of the nice mixed mushrooms included.\n\nThe rear patio dining was ok, but way too hot with the gas lanterns lit and the lighting was way too bright.

Anyone who goes to a restaurant for the first time looks at what people around them are eating.  My girlfriend and I knew from the second we sat down in one of their coveted outside tables this was going to be good.  Their menu is nothing elaborate or expansive.  This is ok.  There is most certainly something on the menu for everyone to enjoy.  As the food is brought out for the table to share, we decided to order two appetizers and two main courses.  We started with Tuna Tar-Tar, which was very fresh, tasted great, and presented very nicely.  Anyone who doesn't like avocado with fresh tuna can stop reading this NOW.  We then got the seared sea scallops.  Most definitely the sweetest scallops I have ever had.  We also got Paella and the stuffed chicken.  The herb stuffed chicken was fantastic, the paella was very good.  Of course we had to try the flour less chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream too.  Not too shabby at all.  If I could change anything about the restaurant it would be for them to have a full bar.  If you are a wine drinker, you will have no problem, they have a good selection.  \nAll in all, we were very pleased with our meal.  Good spot to go with a group of friends.  It seemed very casual outside, maybe inside it was a bit more formal.", "author": "Mike G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-14", "description": "I went to Isa for dinner last Friday. It was...okay. One might save a few dollars ordering from the DAT menu versus the normal menu, but if one tends to order a salad, a risotto or chicken and a dessert, you're probably better off with the normal menu pricing.\n\nFood wise. I'm not sure why this place gets rave reviews.  The mignonette sauce for the raw oysters had too much vinegar/acid. The dungeness crab salad had a good balance of crab, and citrus fruit for acidity, but is missing another ingredient to take it to the next level. The baked goat cheese was okay, but the cheese taste and texture dominates the taste of pesto and pinenuts. The high point was probably the duck breast, but the fat wasn't rendered out enough, and the skin was mushy but the sauce and the meat texture were well executed. The sweetbreads were just mediocre. Taste, texture, plate composition were just messy and rough. A note for vegetarians: the soup and the risotto are not vegetarian friendly, as they use a meat broth. The \"vegetarian plate\" is only main dish available and is basically a mishmash of the vegetables and non-meat items from other dishes thrown into one plate. \n\nFor dessert, the gelato was actually pretty good. I wonder from where they source it. The creme brulee has a decent caramel top, but the custard inside is definitely very light. It did not have texture of a normal custard.\n\nAmbiance wise, the back seating room can get very,very loud and impossible to talk without basically yelling. At the end of the night, my throat was a little sore. The front room tends to be noisier earlier in the night, but 9pm on, it empties out and is quieter.\n\nOverall, I think the price range of Isa allows people to give a good review partially because of value, but mediocre food is still mediocre food. Chapeau! is a better restaurant in the same price range.", "author": "Cary W."}

Food was \"fantabulously\" tasty w/ the sweet smell of fresh ingredients pouring out onto the dishes we ordered that sweet saturday night.  Dishes are served in a staggered system for the main Entree.  Meaning entrees are meant to be shared.  Almost like tapas style but not.  :D  I higly recommend the Maine lobster broth, Baked Chenel goat cheese and the Al dente crushed Black truffle spaghetti.  Saffron Paella i had mixed feelings about though.  I liked the fact that it was solely a \"seafood\" paella.  i am a big fan of this version than the ones w/ sausage or chicken kind.  although i was not to fond of the consistency of the rice when it was brought to our table.  Paella has nice al dente texture rice but i was looking for that part where there is a crusty top & bottom w/ chewy rice in the middle.   it would be also be nice if they presented the paella dish in a mini paella black iron pan to have that orangey saffron color contrasting w/ the black iron pan.\n\nOverall though my wife and I had a wonderful dining experience from 1st course till the 4th.   It does help that this is one of our fave strip in the city where you find good stores (w/out too many tourist), good eats and places where u can chill out for a drink or two.  Parking on weekends gets crazy so to combat that we normally take the bus to get here to shop and dine. \n\nLet me make mention of the great service everytime so far.  You can tell servers are well informed and are focus on quality of service.  Our server even chased us out the door to thank us for dining at Isa although i was alil embarassed since i thought he was chasing me for the bill.

So I decided to order off of the prefix menu. As I was ordering my prefix, which I thought was for one person, they say that their style is family style. Well if you offer family style eating why offer a prefix? So everyone ordered and when we were done ordering the waiter, he said he will try and get all of our dishes together. I didn't think that it would be an issue. Well we got our first course, which was good. I got the potato leak soup, which was a bit bland and needed more salt and pepper. Then it was time for our second course. The first dish came out. Then the second came out 5 minutes later, and then the last 2 dishes came out 20 minutes later. While waiting for my dish, which was the last dish to come out they offered nothing except for a bread plate so that we could have more bread. Then our dishes finally arrived. The steak was pretty tough, the polenta was burnt on the bottom, and the bournese sauce was way too tangy. The best part of the dish was the zucchini. I'm not exactly sure how or why they think that they are a family style eating restaurant. Especially with each main entree being over $20 dollars. I think that they have the concept all wrong. In addition I think that the overall service was horrible. The waiter was not very accommodating, and not interested in helping when I asked what wine he recommended. I was so excited to have dinner here, but it ended up being a huge disappointment.", "author": "Cortney H."}

I tasted the tuna crudo, crab salad, many scallops and the truffle risotto. Everything was exceptional and I am glad the portions are small because the food is so rich and so great you could do some damage to yourself eating too much. Nice wine list although I stuck with Champagne. THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC!!! The service and the tent not so much. There are a lot of reviews pertaining to the service and they are all correct, so no need to add to them. I am not at all crazy about the tent with the gas heat blowing on you when you are paying what you are paying to eat here. Sweating and fighting with the other tables through the staff about heat blaster on and heat blaster off doesn't really make for a great fine dining experience. So with all that said, I suggest bar seating inside with the ala carte menu. Everybody looked like they were having a great time in there. With that twist I definitely think that this is a 5 star place for food and I will drop one for service and none for my personal experience in the tent.

Usually made reservations and our call time was not honored on almost every visit.  It's always busy and the normal wait time is 20 to 25 minutes to be seated (with reservations).  That's the only negative thing I can really say about this restaurant.  The food is perfectly cooked and executed on every time.  Small plates (tapas) is great for sharing with groups and usually 4-5 plates is perfect for couples.  My favorite dish at Isa's is the pan seared sea bass wrapped with potatoes served with a tangy sauce.  That dish is outstanding!!!  The truffled mushroom risotto was ridiculously delicious.  It basically put my risotto to shame, and I stopped making it because I'm just so discouraged now.   The other dish that stood out from the rest was the Sweetbread and Foes Gras with a beautiful reduction sauce.  This dish may have been a special, so I'm not sure whether they offer it anymore.  If they do, I highly recommend this.  I agree with other fellow yelpers that the prices might be a little steep, but remember you don't eat like this all the time.", "author": "Hiro A."}

First and foremost, the service here is almost unbeatable, super friendly staff with personalities and great recommendations, I always feel very well taken care of here. I hadn't been in about four months when we piled back in on a Thursday night. Res. were at 8:00 and we were sitting reading over their brilliant Asian fusion  menu by 8:01. The wine list is well put together to match their exquisite, sometimes daring food, so after ordering a bottle of 2001 Chteau Tournefeuille, we asked our server for recommendations, and per usual, the descriptions were dead on and oh my god are the scallops here from heaven. We had a crab salad, which was brilliant, and the lamb tenderloin, fois gras, which were all suggested, and everything was truly fantastic. We left much broker, but full of good food and wine. We we're so satisfied that we went over the california wine merchant for glass after and lo and behold, our server stopped in and chatted with us over a glass, super cool, I love ISA, and have never been let down, so just don't think about the money and enjoy one of San Francisco's greatest treasures!!", "author": "Steve l."}

They did seat a couple right next to us even through the room was fairly empty which was strange.  The waitress was from the east coast (I guessed it) and she had a total NY type attitude \"you ready yet?\"  \"You been here before, it's like family style\", oh right like I've never had Tapas before.  It felt like I was at PF Chang's \"Hey, you been here before, let me mix the sauce for you\" type of thing.  Well, we ordered the Oysters which they said were from Hog Island so I thought I'd give them a chance.  They were fairly dried out, like they opened them 2 hours ago.  The next course was asparagus soup.  It needed a little salt just to add some flavor to it.  It had a nice sort of truffle taste, but it needed more truffle oil or truffles themselves.  Then we had the shrimp in some type of red sauce.  This was fairly good, the shrimp or prawns really had a great taste to them.  That was the best dish.  Then we had the sea bass wrapped in potato's.  It was definitely overcooked.  The fish was dry and had no taste and was hard to cut.  Overall, I wouldn't go back.  At the end it seemed like they were trying to rush us out around 10pm.", "author": "Mitch A."}

Firstly - the food is good. The wine is good. Favorites of the group were the lobster broth and baked butterfish. Secondly, the patio is extremely cute - definitely reminds me of Le Charm's patio, but larger. However, we all had issues with the timing of the food and the service. I understand that this is supposed to be a \"family style\" meal and plates will not come out at the same time. However, it just felt awkward - sometimes 1 plate would come out, then 3, then we would wait 15+ minutes for the next one, and so on. Also, the service was ridiculously slow - it may have been Friday night, but it was a late Friday night dinner and the place was not that packed...we waited 25 minutes to be seated, 15-20 minutes for our check and another 15 minutes for the card to be run.

I read the reviews, and although favorable, I was thinking it was going to end up like a tapas-style dinner.  Because of the size of the group, we did end up ordering a variety of items to sample, based on our gracious waiter's suggestion of ordering 2 items per person.  It actually worked out ok, as the portions were not as small as my BLVD. experience.  Now I'm usually a picky eater, but everything we ordered (ok, except the Vegetable Medley) agreed with my palate...spicy tuna tartare, heirloom tomato salad, foie gras, roasted quail over risotto, risotto w/truffles n mushrooms, dayboat scallops, rack of lamb, flatiron steak, and potato encrusted sea bass...that's almost half the menu right there.  I enjoyed every taste.  Some may point out that everything seems rather simple and uninspired, but sometimes, simple is the best way to enjoy a meal.   Take a lesson from the Italians and they'll show you how good a meal can be with simple, fresh ingredients and prep.

The fact that I have limited recollection of the many plates we ordered means that the food did not wow me. And yet, Isa has continued to flourish in the fiercely competitive restaurant business (especially in SF), so the experience must have been at least pretty good. I think we were seated next to the window so we had a nice view of the street. Our server was very friendly, and the overall atmosphere was peaceful (we like to dine in the early evening to avoid the crowd). I recall ordering the Lobster Broth. It came with foam on top, which I felt was completely extraneous, as it had no flavor; I know it was meant to provide contrast of \"texture\", but frankly, froth on soup just doesn't have the same appeal as froth on espresso. The broth itself had a very rich shellfish flavor.

Our service was TERRIBLE. We sat in the cove by the front window and our server kept on forgetting about us and we RARELY ever saw him. I think he was definitely taking care of too many tables. I'm not terribly critical usually about service (I'm more of a food person...), but when you're very thirsty and you have an empty cup of water for 30 minutes, you get a bit sad.....looking at that empty cup... there was one incredible bartender/server (short dark haired male with glasses) - I saw him so intensely making the soju mojito and became intrigued with his attention to detail - really working to crush the limes and mint to ensure a perfect cocktail. We watched him as we sat at the bar and instantaneously became sold and ordered it.\n\nAmbiance can definitely be nice for a first date or just a good girl hangout. Make sure to make reservations - not the biggest of restaurants.\n\nRegarding the food, I'm somewhat torn. Everything was cooked perfectly (texture-wise) - baked butterfish was flaky, fresh, and definitely NOT overcooked and the duck breast was perfectly juicy was medium-rare just the way I like it. However, the flavors weren't necessarily very astounding. It was nice to try the huckleberry as a complement to the duck breast - but the duck overpowered any taste of the huckleberry (perhaps some citrus could have helped to draw out the flavors more)...mm maybe some more garlic... :) the beet accompaniment was great with the goat cheese (but the arugula could go away - it was on this night overly salted with too much lemon - almost to where it stung your mouth as it touched either your lips or tongue). The idea of adding green to the plate is good as otherwise the colors would not be very widespread (all purple, blue, brown), but the arugula just didn't work out for the dish. The problem with the fish was also similar, it was just sort of bland - the veggies that it came with (mushrooms, carrots, etc.) were good and well - flavored, but the fish would have been slightly better with some type of rub. We also got oysters, but it wasn't anything special.\n\nI think I would come back again, but still alas, too many restaurants to try before I buckle down on anything...", "author": "Jeannette L."}

Although it is a small plates restaurant, everything is coursed out so the fois gras will not be served at the same time as the fish so you could be eating one dish alone.", "author": "Maria R."}

Kitty and Luke are a wonderful couple who have always treated us well.  The food has been great and very consistent over the years.  I enjoy this place better than Cortez, Andalu and most of the others I have tried in SF.", "author": "Brian L."}

We ordered 5 small plates (salads+tarters) and each person ordered big plates (lamb+chicken+steak), so it worked out well.", "author": "Ann S."}

The food is very consistent and well priced for the quality you are getting.  The service is great and the atmoshpere is cozy.  Weather you are on a date or out with friends, give this place a try.  They also have the best tuna tartar and the chicken dish is awesome as well.", "author": "Danielle M."}

They are doing some shady stuff with the SF Chefs. Food. Wine. Restaurant Week--CUSTOMERS BEWARE.  Long story short, they RIPPED ME OFF!  I noticed on their website that their regular menu (with a prix fixe menu of $28 for 3 courses) is almost the same as their \"special\" menu for Restaurant Week (with a prix fixe menu of $35 for 3 courses), so I called and asked what the difference was.  The host explained that they had to create a special menu to participate in Restaurant Week, so they created one based on their regular menu.  THAT'S IT.  I was like, \"OK, so why is this special menu more expensive?\"  Instead of giving me a straightforward answer, he said, \"Well, you can just order off of our regular menu.\"  That should've been an indication to me that Isa is just not the restaurant for me.  But I already made a reservation, and my friends were already coming, so I'm like this sucks, but I'll try it out and just order off of the regular menu.  I got there, and once again tried to get the waiter to explain to me the difference b/t the two menus.  He was super evasive and was like, well, one has a dessert and the other one doesn't.  And I'm like whatever, let me just order off of the regular prix fixe menu.  So I ordered off of the regular menu and it got even more confusing because he kept trying to explain to me what to order for the 3 courses, and I found out that there is a dessert option, but it's smaller, and at this point I was a bit tipsy so I didn't really pay that much attention and allowed him to steer me towards ordering certain things.  THEN, at the end, I got a bill for all the dishes at regular price (no prix fixe prices, regular OR special)!!!  I freaked out, but didn't want to make a big scene in front of my friends, so I went up to the waiter to ask him what was up, and he said that I didn't order off of any prix fixe menu and that the regular prix fixe menu was different than the options that I chose, even though I clearly told him that I wanted the regular prix fixe for the table.  I didn't feel like arguing with him and ruin the night, so I just sucked it up and paid the FULL PRICE.  I seriously hate this place now and feel totally conned by my waiter.", "author": "Lucks N."}

I literally made reservations late on Thursday for a party of  8  on Sat which they were able to accomodate at 8:30pm.  We were seated in the back room and that atmosphere was beautiful, albeit cramped.  They really pack them back there and it was quite loud.  We were worried at first that the server was taking a while to help us out and then continued to tell us that they were out of mussels, chicken and all the specials, but he really ended up turning it around.  We took his suggestion and ordered about 2 dishes per person.  It was really fun to share as the dishes came out.  They were all wonderful!  We had the salmon tartare, sauteed prawns, grilled calamari, warmed goat cheese, steak, sole, scallops, and truffle risotto.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine and some of our party had cocktails.  It came out to less than $60 per person!  Plus our server surprised the birthday boy with a chocolate cake (amazing!) and complimentary glass of muscat.  It was a great night!", "author": "L P."}

I have been here about 5 times before last night, the food and experience-always great.  But last night I sat at the bar as I usually do, my friend and I ordered 2 entrees and a salad to start to share.  His, ribs, mine a steak.  His came around 6:15p, mine never came.  I asked and asked.  finally I asked for the bill at 6:40p he was completely done eating at my insistance.  The \"manager\" came out and tried to justify the fact that my food never came!  \"it takes longer\" not all food can come at the same time  etc.  I have never been so insulted. Like I was wrong to expect my food to come at all?  I paid the bill for his dinner and my wine and left without any satisfaction, no apologies, no dinner,  nothing.  $50 for a salad we split and his dinner and some wine! I will NEVER go here again.  She could have said just about anything or given me a discount - anything, and I would have come back.  But nothing.  I hope the owner knows about this extrememly unprofessional and rude behavior from his manager.  nothing is worth that experience and I won't repeat it!", "author": "Merry D."}

I started going when the owner's little daughter was running around the place barely the height of the tables.  Now she's probably... like driving now? I don't live in the City anymore so the visits are stretched.  Isa is one of the few places I will drive the hour just to visit and support the Asian owner/chef.  Always good.  I've never had a bad night there.  I'm not saying everything is excellent but once I dip into the foie-gras I'm good for the night and everything else is gravy.  Yes it can get packed.  If you can't adjust to that... in the City... during peak num-num time then I don't know what types of restaurants you frequent... and they can't be all that good... TGI Friday's gets packed but no one complains about that... for $10 a head.  I happened to go on a saturday night about 7:15pm.  We almost had the whole back patio to ourselves (4 ppl).  I love the patio.  It has a casual feel with the tent, heaters and light strings.  I wouldn't exactly call it \"romantic\" , since it can feel a bit crowded with a packed house, and still don't know why ppl recommend it as such...  unless you were to rent out the whole back for you and your date... then that would be romantic in my book.  Get there early because parking's a biatch in the Marina.", "author": "No I Don't Have Time F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-15", "description": "I'm a bit torn between a 3 and a 4, but have decided to be generous.  The food is close to a 5.  The only thing we had that wasn't exceptionally tasty was the pasta, but it was by no means bad.  Highlights were the butter fish, steak with blue cheese, and creme brulee.  The reason for the lower review is I felt very manipulated and rushed, which isn't what you're looking for in a restuarant at this price point.  First, the waiter told us we would need to order 2 dishes each (total of 14 for the 7 of us), we ordered 10, he said it wouldn't be enough and it was still way too much food (and we have serious appetites).  He also told us that the chef would not allow us to order more dishes later in the meal if we wanted them. Second, the chef is in complete control of what food comes out and when.  I had no objection to the chef selecting the order, but the dishes rolled out so fast that we felt like it was a food marathon.  The table was small, so the dishes had to be cleared within a few minutes of arriving to make room for the next one.  The food was really good and I would really have liked to take my time and savor it instead of shoveling it in - especially for a final check of $70 each with only two bottles of inexpensive wine for 7 people.  Perhaps they would have been able to let us have more time if they'd sat us on time for our 6:30p reservation when our entire party was present.  If you want to brave it, I do think small plates in large groups is a great way to get to explore this excellent menu.", "author": "gretchen d."}
