I tried it for the first time a month ago when my mom suggested it, and we had no expectations, so we were pleasantly surprised!\n\nSpicy Numbing Beef Tendon ($7.95) - oh my goodness, SO delicious. Perfect texture of the tendons, great flavor, nice big pieces and awesome portion. Will order this every time I come here from now on.\nGuiling Rice Noodle Soup ($9.95) - also SO delicious. I really didn't expect much from this but the broth was really flavorful, a little spicy and a little sour. The consistency of the rice noodles was great and I enjoyed this very much. \nTempting Hot Pot - Combination, Chinese Herb Flavor (forgot the price) - this was good too! Didn't blow me away like the other two did, but still tasty and had a good amount of ingredients in it. Came on a burner that stayed strong throughout the meal. \n\nService was whatever, but I have low expectations for Chinatown. Interior is clean and decor is nice. There is a great hot sauce on all the tables so don't forget about that. Definitely excited to come back again to try some other dishes (but still order the beef tendon)!", "author": "Nicole M."}

Duck Boiling Pot-There was lots of unfamiliar spice and heat-different then what I know which was great and all but the duck meat was cooked on the bone, with the fat still on. Which personally isn't the way I like my meat prepared. It was a bummer because you really had to work around the bone and fat, and after working through it there was hardly any meat to my pieces (unless my mom got to them before me ;)) So just imagine the scene you're doing the spicy pant with your tongue trying to gnaw your way to some meat LOL \nFried rice was some of the best I've ever had (a little on the salty side) just how I like it-super flavorful \nThe service lacked a bit of.. refinement the waittresses stood near our table the whole time we were there and didn't seem to do it for any beneficial reason, just mainly as a space to chitchat.  \n\nI'd definitely be back!

I came here with my boyfriend a few days ago since this is our to go spot whenever we are in Chinatown and when we were done eating our food and asked for the check. Instead of putting the check down and letting me look at the bill to get out my card to pay, the waitress simply just held it out and said to me it's going to be $25.00. I wasn't given time to go over and look at my bill, only a quick glance. After that when I got my card back to sign, another waitress came and was rushing to get back the check that I signed. I wasn't even done signing yet and she kept rushing us and saying how she really needed this bill and quickly took it. Overall it was really rude. Keep in mind that restaurant wasn't even packed at the time I went..\n\nFood: Besides the service, the food is pretty good here. My go to orders are usually the numbing noodles and their house fried rice but I recently tried their house cold noodles and it was so good!\n\nNumbing noodles- if you are a fan of spicy, you would like this. Like the name, you get a little numbing feeling on your tongue from the chili and spice. It's covered in this chili oil and overall it's really good. \nCold noodles- Even though I usually get the numbing noodles I think I like these noodles more. You also get a lot so it's worth the price and it's also delicious.\nHouse fried rice- this is probably my favorite fried rice I've had in a restaurant. It tastes better than most fried rice I've had in the Chinese restaurants I've been to. \nExplosive chicken- It was okay. It was kind of like popcorn chicken/ chicken nuggets but a little spicier. A little saltier than most chicken nuggets/fried chicken.\nKung pao chicken- need to eat this was rice otherwise it's too salty to eat because the sauce is flavorful. \nCucumber side dish- it was sour and I personally did not enjoy it.\nOverall I recommend the food but the service is sometimes off.", "author": "Kochamon S."}

Perfect heat, the right amount of garlic and the quantity of each dish was good. Our server never came to check on us, ask us how our food was or even to see if we wanted another beer.

We were staying in Union Square and knew that Chinatown would be the perfect place to get spicy food. Found the place through yelp, and because it was President's Day, some of the ones with \"higher ratings\" were closed so we decided to take a chance on this one.\n\nWe arrived around 6:30 pm to a half empty restaurant, and as soon as we were seated, a waitlist started to form immediately! We got lucky before hitting rush hour. \n\nWe ordered the cucumber salad to start, my husband had the spicy beef noodle soup and I had the Tan tan noodles. The cucumber salad was tangy and savory, a very nice start to the meal (and a nice cooling contrast to the spicy noodle dishes we ordered) \n\nI was almost disappointed when I saw the glob of noodles arrive, it looked like it was hauled out of starchy noodle water and looked stuck together. It took a while to mix my tan tan noodles together, but as soon as all the spices and oil got mixed in between, the noodles clung to the spices and minced pork.  My husband, who has just recently developed a liking to Asian cuisine, thoroughly enjoyed his beef noodle soup and claimed it was better than our local beef noodle soup spot in LA.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-01", "description": "I came here on a weekday evening with a friend and we were seated on the very inside of the restaurant, near what is presumably the private area. I sort of knew what I wanted prior to coming in, but I wanted to look at the menu one last time, before ordering. I narrowed it down between the Cross Bridge Rice Noodle and the Hot and Sour Noodle Soup with Port Intestines, both dishes that I have never had before. I eventually went with the hot and sour noodle soup because it was three dollars cheaper than the cross bridge rice noodle. After deciding on our respective dishes, it took a while for the waiter to come take our order since it was very crowded and there was limited staff to field all the orders. \n\nAfter our dishes arrived, I went ahead and sample the broth. I felt a jolt of sourness running through me and was surprised at the level of sourness this dish had. A bit stunned, I then moved on to the pork intestines. The pork intestines were pretty quite soft and chewy. There was also a generous helping of peanuts and the bamboo shoots as seen in the picture, and I personally have no opinion on them since every spoonful I'm constantly reminded of the sourness of the soup. Glass noodles would not have been my first choice of noodles if I had to pick, but I don't think I can fault the store on that front since I chose the dish. \n\nToward the end of the meal, I was having significant buyer's remorse and felt that I should have ponied up the extra three dollars for the cross bridge rice noodle instead. It got to the point where I couldn't finish the broth, which I am normally able to do. I know I said this before, but I severely underestimated the sourness of this dish, as it overpowered everything else in the dish. One takeaway from this would be that I don't really have that high of a tolerance for sourness, and have to think about more about ordering sour dishes going forward. Anyways, I had to make an effort again to flag down the waitress for our check and we were on our way out back into the cold night. If I were to come back, it would be for the cross bridge rice noodle since that's the only thing on the menu that seems interesting to me.", "author": "Nelson X."}

After several months,after they rise the prices little bit I also noticed quality and quantity of their dishes dropped dramatically.  For example,I loved one of their noodles that got nice spicy soup and very good bargain deal for 7.99. Later not just they asked 2 dollars more but delivered a terrible noodle that came with pure hot water instead spicy soup. They simply mixed some hot water with their noodles.  That made the noodles tasted terrible bad . They also screwed my another favorite which is beef noodle. It got some delicious big beef meat that was big as 2/3 size of my hand and then later for the same price,a same beef noodle,what I found were some small piece of beef as small as my finger and also very few pieces. For another of my favorite dishes, I was asking to pay 2 dollar more and got only half of what I used to get before.\nI stopped going to this Spicy King after they couldn't keep up what they were good at till I visited them again 2 months ago.

Took 10 minutes before they even noticed us to be seated we were told to hold on twice. We got sat and they gave us ONE menu for three people. And some service is so bad of course I took another 10 minutes for us to ask for two additional menus. We were ready to order and it took 10 more minutes to wave down a waitress eventually my friend went to the cashier and said we were ready to order, they came 5 min later. Food was not good, you can find way better elsewhere, overpriced. They never came and asked how our food was or just check in. Tried to get a refill for tea and of course they aren't attentive. At this point we're already fed up and just wanted to leave and pay the bill. I've worked in the service industry and understand how much waitresses get paid but there needs to be actual work done to earn the tips. Thus, since we did more work waiving down to get served I decided not to tip. The waitress had the guts to chase after us into the rain and say that the boss says we NEED to tip. I am not sure if they thought we were tourist and trying to rip us off or what cause I was born and raised in the US and it is not against the law not to tip. At this point we were already beyond fed up so I tipped and left. Will never return, not recommended. Please spend your money elsewhere.\n\nUpdate: just saw another review where they automatically charge you a \"service fee of 15%\" on your bill. Now I probably tipped 30% at this point. I think it needs to be clearly labeled somewhere or told to us if there is already a service fee in the meal usually only groups of 6 or more have an automatic tip in my 24 years of life.

It's true that I almost always avoid places with less a than 4 star rating unless of course there isn't anything else around my hotel but after reading a couple of the reviews it seemed to me this spot was of 4 star caliber (perhaps more), at least as far as the food was concerned. So I took a chance, what can I say, I like living dangerously.\n   After seeing many a drool worthy pictures of the dan dan noodles, I was fixated. I rolled up solo and was quickly sat at the bar. The biggest challenge was looking through the extensive menu to find what I already knew I was going to order. I ordered and after what seemed like almost no time at all came a gigantic bowl of heaven. My first thought was... \"How in the world am I going to finish all of this!?\" I would later find myself scraping the bottom of the bowl for any remaining morsels to keep the taste in my mouth. Point is...holy moly was the broth tasty, the meat succulent, perfectly balanced numbing spice with the freshness of the cabbage hiding under all those noodles. GAAAHHHHHH was it good and the price was extremely reasonable.\n   So all I can wonder is...\"why only 3.5 stars?\" when this was sooo dang delectable. Sure, the service is straight to the point. The no fuss kind you get from the best Asian restaurants in my opinion. You just have to let them know when you need the check or more water etc. This bothers some folks, but to me...no big deal because servers were constantly present, buzzing around taking orders and delivery food and most importantly the food spoke for itself.

Though I really like Z&Y for Szechuan, their popularity makes getting a table difficult sometimes.  Spicy King is a little off the tourist path which means seating is easier; also it feels like some of the dishes might even be spicier.  A good way to get your chili fix.\n\nChicken w/ Explosive Chili Pepper: Despite all the chilis, it's not that hot if you don't eat the dried chilis (which don't have a good texture anyway, since they're dried).  The chicken chunks are pretty large, like a bite or two per piece.  And they seem more generous with chicken portion than at other Szechuan places.  Lots of perfumey Szechuan pepper taste (which are from the little peppercorns, not the long dried chilis).  A little fried chicken overload for one person, but great to share.\n\nChongqing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodles w/ Peas & Meat Sauce: Thin crinkly noodles, like ramen, in an oily chili sauce.  It wasn't quite numbing, but it was appreciably hot.  The bland cabbage pieces were a nice palate cleanser between bites.  I wasn't really feeling the peas since they seemed like the canned kind (or maybe frozen), but definitely not fresh out of the pod.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-09", "description": "Another popular trend in Chinese cuisine besides hot pots is spicy food, specially Southwest Chinese regional style.  Szechuan is the most famous along with Guizhou.  Szechuan's capitol is Chengdu, most famous for its panda reserves.  \nThe recent trend that started a couple years back is numbing hot, a sensation that leaves a tingling sensation on your tongue and renders all flavors to be neutral (neither salty or sweet).  This is not my cup of tea and, for me, if you can't taste it, what's the point?!\nThe restaurant is known for their hot pots which is difficult for lunch, given most people are on a schedule workwise.  After studying their individual serving dishes, I decided to try their Tan Tan noodles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YzdsvLPG1YjkobZ7k0n8PQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) for $7.95.  \nEating this in my office, it was a bit difficult to mix the ingredients as most of the meat and sauce were on the bottom.  After eating my way down about 1/3rd of the way, I was able to better mix those with the cabbage.  The flavors weren't overly spicy but still had good enough heat.  The cabbage added a crunch to the noodle bounce and the minced meat pieces.\nYes, I would have this again.\nMy friend and I stopped for hot pot but there was an interruption so I'll withhold comment until I actually enjoy this here.\nThe chef apparently worked for the popular Z&Y on Jackson Street for some time before branching on his own. The original spot was the former location of Pot Sticker about half a block away on the other side of the street.  I've tried his other restaurant on Geary Blvd last year, coincidentally during the Warriors' finals' run.\nFor Chinatown old timers, most will remember this spot of the famed Uncle's Restaurant, where many of the political negotiations back in the day happened in the community.  This was a popular breakfast place for local business owners and family association officers for discussing situations and solving problems (ala Sun Wah Kue, Mary's, Jackson Caf\u00e9, etc.).\nThe ambiance is a bit dark in there with a few large tables and mostly two or four seat tables.  Checkout the \"ride\" in the front of the restaurant, which doesn't make much sense to me.\nBut I guess that's the thing about Chinatown... many things don't quite make sense here.", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-09", "description": "4/5/15: Just a quick look at reviews tells me many people misunderstand what this restaurant serves: authentic Chinese Szechuan (Sichuan) food.  Here's a quote from a 1 star review:\n\n\"However, be warn with both of these dishes the food is sitting in a pool of chili oil.  The chili oil is how they make everything spicy. It's so greasy. Yuck.\"\n\nObviously the reviewer has no idea what true Szechuan food is since the \"pool of chili oil\" is the hallmark of such cooking.  Many of the dishes mention a \"numbing oil\" referring to the fact that if done properly your mouth should feel somewhat numbed (to let you tolerate much hotter foods) as a result of the special pepper corns they use, yes, in a pool of oil.  Anyway, just wanted to point that out.\n\nThat said, I've had my fair share, including some really awesome ones in Monterey Park, and unfortunately this place isn't among the best, and is actually sub par...\n\n1. Couple's Delight $7.95: This is the MUST HAVE for any Szechuan meal--the typical 2 or 3 foods (out of sliced beef, pig ear, and tripe) combined for an appetizer, hopefully with ton of numbness dished in.  In this case, they did the famous dish right.  Everything was super flavorful and rich.  8/10.\n\n2. Chongqing Hot Numbing Spicy Noodle $7.95:  My girl was SUPER HAPPY to see this on the menu.  Even immigrating from China she has never had this dish and was looking forward to duplicating it.  Unfortunately, what they server was NOT IT.  Also, not hot or numbing at all.  -2/10.   Yes you read that right: NEGATIVE TWO / 10 for making a joke out of a famous dish.  -----2/10\n\n3. Boiling Live Fish w/ Numbing Chili Oil $28.95: Sigh..... so, my girl and her friend immediately said this was not \"live.\"  We even asked the waitress who confirmed they did use a live fish.  I dunno, maybe it was killed in the morning and they called it \"live.\"  Personally, I thought the fish was okay, but was more disappointed that it was cheapass tilapia, the cheapest live fish you can get at Ranch 99!  For nearly $30, totally not even close to worth that chunk of change.  Taste-wise, again, I thought it was okay, but out of the humongoid pot, I think 2/3rds of it was chilli peppers and inedible filler.  Very little actual fish.  This is one of the most expensive items on their menu, so I warn you--DO NOT GET THIS.  2/10.\n\n4. House Special Lamb Ribs $13.95: I LOVE ribs.  American.  Chinese.  Whatever.  And I've had ribs at other Szechuan places and I always love them.  But this one.... some pieces were okay, but most of the ribs were not intact, with half their meat ripped off.  The ones that were still one piece were good.  The rest was just lying in the dish.  Also, some of the lone pieces were super chewy and were barely swallowable.  Note, this is the cumin-flavored variation, not the bbq type.  2/10.\n\n5. Chicken w/ Explosive Chili Pepper $13.95:  I thought this one was decent.  Pretty tender chicken to me with good pepper taste.  But the girls disagreed.  Anyway, for me, 5/10.\n\nThis restaurant just isn't as good as their average competitor.  Go elsewhere.\n\n#chinese #szechuan #sichuan", "author": "Dean C."}

I was friends with a Chinese family who owned a restaurant in Ohio, and they approximated Sichuan cuisine, but I've never had the food made with the real recipes.\n\nI ordered the Hand-shredded cabbage, which was meant to be spicy.  I talked to waitress about it, and I mentioned tofu.  She showed me Mapo Tofu, which is a Shanghai-nese (I've been reminded by someone that it is Sichuan.

I had asked for iced tea, as she had brought hot tea.  They didn't have any.  She also asked if I wanted steamed white rice.\n\nWhen I returned from the restroom, she had brought ice water.  It wasn't long after that when she brought the appetizer, and fairly quickly, the main course arrived, along with steamed white rice.\n\nSince I wasn't sure how anything but the rice should taste, I was pleased with all of it.  The appetizer was cold and the level of spice was mild.  The level of spice of the cabbage was a bit higher and there were many red peppers that had been cooked with the cabbage as well.  Is this typical?  I don't know.\n\nI remember being told that Sichuan recipes were extremely spicy, and they had some tongue-numbing recipes, with the word \"numbing\" in the description.\n\nI felt more secure as other Asians entered the restaurant.

You can't tell a whole lot from the outside, but it's very nice interior inside, and big portions of food.", "author": "Lola H."}

It is DELICIOUS.\n\nYou in for some spicy Si Chuan food? Then get, it, girl, and get your stomach ready.\n\nThings we got: ma po tofu, a combination clay pot, garlic eggplant (duh), and black bean spicy beef. Also the noodles. And, at the request of my boyfriend, even though I kept giving him skeptical \"are you sure\" looks and comments, preserved eggs with jalapenos.\n\nThe ma po tofu didn't come with the ground pork that I expected, but it actually worked out well because it means the vegetarian in the room got to eat it. And even without the pork it was full of flavor, and the tofu was that perfect firm but but not too firm.\n\nThe combination clay pot was full of red peppers, and was like a little \"find your treasure\" kind of situation. Spam, beef, shrimp, fish, lotus roots, bamboo shoots, mushrooms--it was all thrown in there, and you just had to dig past the pepper corn and chiles to get your favorite parts. A lazier person would've been over it. I was showing off my chopstick skills and in full Mama Bear mode, so I was into it.\n\nBlack bean spicy beef was solid. The noodles were SO GOOD. The chewiness of ramen, and the spicy broth that made me think of Korean ramen.\n\nEven the preserved eggs with jalapeno were good, floating in a spicy chile oil, the creaminess of the preserved egg help cutting into the spiciness.\n\nThe one thing that I'll say is that you have to order rice separately, which makes me a little sad face, because I think rice should come with food, but they have hot pot, so it makes sense that it doesn't come with the entrees.\n\nThe wait was LONG, but the food was def worth it.

We ended up sharing our table with another couple because we were so hungry and the places smelled so great we didn't want to have to wait any longer. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They came out crispy and fresh. That was a great way to start off the food experience.  \n\nNext came the princess chicken. I don't know what flavors they used but the combination was sweet and spicy and drenched in sauce yet the chicken was still crisp. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nAfter the chicken came out we realized that we had ordered some steamed rice and actually had to ask them to bring it out. I'm guessing they forgot too. That kinda sucked.\n\nLastly came the orange beef. That was pretty amazing too. It wasn't very tough to eat and came with tiny shavings of orange peel cooked into the sauce. That was a refreshing and delightful touch.\n\nSo, I really debated if I was going to give this place 3 or 4 stars. The wait staff was absolutely horrible! They never asked us how the food was. Never asked us if we wanted another beer or if we wanted more water. It was a shame.

We took this option, but it meant staring at and smelling the amazing foods our table-mates had ordered before we had even placed an order! We went simple: \"fish flavored\" egg plant, hand torn spicy cabbage, and spicy broth tofu. When the cabbage finally came out we devoured it almost instantly! It was the exact Sichuan style dish we were craving! Sadly, the subsequent dishes were not as satisfying. The tofu seemed to have cracked black pepper, which we found odd, but the eggplant was inedible due to the skin, which we can only surmise was burned.\nThe service was also very slow. I think they were under-staffed, but the tables that emptied stayed dirty a long time before anyone from the developing crowd at the door could've seated.\nIf you're looking for fancier dishes, this place seemed to do the trick for whole fish and hotpot, but for more modest fare I think you'd be better off looking elsewhere.", "author": "Charles G."}

The appetizers were on par with Z&Y's (though the cucumber dish was not what we expected), and while the hot pot was okay, it had a particular medicinal/herbal aftertaste that I wasn't too fond of.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The restaurant is a little on the smaller side, and it seemed to me like some of the tables were arranged closely enough that they wouldn't be accessible.

Although this place is tucked away in Chinatown, the have a large space that's great for fairly big groups (~7 or 8 people).\nService here is not that great, if you're expecting someone to come in and check on you often or being able to flag down a waitress quickly, but I think it's perfectly fine. The staff here does hit the major points: takes orders well, delivers food fairly fast (even when they're crowded), and brings the check at the end of the meal.\nThe real winner of this place truly is the food. Service aside, this place deserves 5 stars for the taste of their dishes. I love the explosive chili chicken and mapo tofu. It's such a hearty, comforting meal with a bit of a kick.

They have huge menus with tacky photos of two chefs on the cover wearing numerous medals (medals from what, who knows) around their necks, and beautiful tasty looking photos of all the dishes. But there is fine print that says something like our dishes may look different from the photos. Ordered a bowl of dan dan noodles and a bowl of chongqing noodles. The chongqing noodles had a tad more of the numbing spiciness, and included a few tiny strips of lettuce-like vegetable. The dan dan noodles came in a different style of bowl, and had a teensy tiny bit of sweetness in the broth, but other than that the two were virtually the same. There were only maybe 3 tiny crumbs of ground meat in the dan dan noodles. Where's the meat?\n\nJust because there's that disclaimer on the menu, it doesn't mean it's okay to leave out one of the three usual components of the dish. The noodles were tasty...but...they were plain noodles and sauce. For $18. Which doesn't sound like a lot, but they were just plain noodles, and that's 30% to 50% more than the average lunches in Chinatown, lunches that include actual ingredients like meat and vegetables.\n\nService/decor - I would have thought they had only been open a couple months, and were just ironing things out. Didn't realize till looking at Yelp now that they've been open 2 years. Service was totally disorganized. It wasn't that busy and people walked back and forth inefficiently and it wasn't always clear who worked there. The decor is gimmicky. Little bowls have scalloped rims which looks kind of cool, i guess, but there's a reason why no other places use bowls like this. It's not very conducive to the Chinese way of shoveling rice into your mouth, or sipping soup directly from the bow. They sat us at the \"bar\" which ended up being very uncomfortable.

Bottom line: The food was good, the service was terrible. Had to search for the waiter to order (we were in a cubby) and ordered a simple dinner for two. Asked for water, the waiter brought us a carafe with NO glasses. Flagged him down and asked for glasses, he said they only had paper cups (?) then he brought glasses. After 45 minutes with no service (we were talking) searched for the waiter again.... Apparently he had FORGOTTEN to place our order. Had to get the manager to get the order placed. Thought they might comp us or give us something extra for this snafu, but nothing (even charged for the takeout boxes). It was early in the evening and not yet full so there were no excuses for this bad service. I hesitated to make this review, but apparently poor service is standard here.", "author": "Josie E."}

First thing to note is that if you're looking for this place, there's no sign for \"Spicy King\" outside it.  I think it was like Uncle something...\n\nAnyway... I ordered their lamb dish and and I can't remember what my husband ordered.  We're Caucasian and have never eaten at an authentic Chinese restaurant so we probably should have gone with something familiar like beef and broccoli.  (Yes we've had chinese-american food a million times, but definitely different from the real deal, which is why we stopped here...)  Anyway, the waitress made a big deal of telling us the food was spicy, specially my husband dish because its had \"spicy\" in the title.  Both dishes were fine.  My husband and I actually traded our dishes because we each liked each other's better.  I didn't think either dishes were \"spicy\" at all.  I know some white people can't hold even a dash a pepper, but that's really the only spice they added to our dishes.  Not sure if they toned it down for us even though we said we were fine with spice... oh well..\n\nThe pot stickers were amazing.  And I really liked that they served tea instead of water here, but our main dishes were just kinda barely tolerable.  They just didn't taste that good.  Oh well...", "author": "Cassandra A."}

The lady passing out the menus walked us one block to the inside of the restaurant, which was very impressive.  The place was very busy... We were immediately greeted, seated, provided menus and tea/water was already coming.  We ordered traditional items; Spring Rolls, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Steamed Rice.... And, was given the opportunity to increase or decrease the spicy.  The food was delicious!!!  Very authentic!!!  Amazing!!!  Definitely would go back again.

I generally like food with flavor, but the food here was so salty, it was basically pouring msg down your throat. On top of that, I generally don't have high expectations for tea at restaurants, but the tea served here was basically water. We were curious so we looked into the tea kettle. To my surprise, there was a teabag, but the tea was tasteless? It makes me wonder if they reuse the teabags over and over again.  \n\nWe weren't impressed with the service either. We came in with a group of 5, and they decided to seat us at a big table meant for a party of 10. In the middle of our meal, they asked us to move because a group of 14 was coming in. Why seat us there in the first place? \n\nAlso, it is pricey. Every dish is $10+. We (and our wallets) would be way happier going around the corner for better, cheaper Chinese food at Capital.

I came here with my party of six on a Thursday night and we were seated in 5 mins. \n\nTwo of us ordered the vegetarian dinner option and the rest of the party ordered a shareable pot of the hot and sour soup, prawns flaming pot, sauteed string beans, onion pancake, spicy beef noodles, and rice. \n\nThe noodles were flavorful, spicy, and not at all overcooked accompanied with onion, broccoli, & carrot. The onion pancake was savory and not soggy as I'm used to from other restaurants. The string beans were absolutely delicious here! They had the right amount of bite, sauce, saltiness, and spiciness. The spring rolls that came as part of the veggie option were average, yet good. The hot and sour soup was super yummy and definitely hit the spot as it was quite chilly that night! It was both spicy and tart. The rest of my party enjoyed their spicy beef noodles saying it was a good combination of salty and spicy. The food was so satisfying, we were all done eating after a few bites.\n\nWe were somewhat disappointed with the service here since no one bothered to check up on us for drinks. We had to keep waiving for staff to take notice of us even though we were seated at the biggest table front and center of the restaurant. It wasn't even a busy night. On top of that, we never received the steamed rice we had ordered at the beginning. The waitress later admitted she had forgot & included it in our leftover boxes.

I looked around and saw another table having an authentic style whole fish in boiling chilli oil sauce. My main regret is not being able to sample all the dishes in one sitting.\nMy orders tasted fabulous, the fish had the right amount of peppercorn and dried chilli in hot oil, there's no such thing as too much in authentic Sichuan dishes.. The only missing item is fresh sichuan peppercorn but it's banned in California so I can't ding them for this. The timing of servings is bad. They served two items and promptly forgot about the rest for 30 minutes. Come on, this is a casual Chinese restaurant, the proper way to serve is to have every dishes on the table 15 minutes or less after the order. One star off for that.

We started off with jasmine tea which was nice, despite being a little bland. \nWe shared a large hot and sour soup (more than enough for 5 people). The soup was pipping hot, spicy (this is Szechuan cuisine), balanced, and had a nice touch of cilantro added - defiantly the highlight of the meal.\nFor the remaining meal we ordered Szechuan beef, green beans, Chinese broccoli, and pork belly. The beef was the weakest part of the meal - although the spiciness level was pretty good, the amount of cornstarch added to the sauce contributed an unappetizing amount of gloupiness. The beans were nice and lightly sauced - nothing special though. The broccoli had a touch of garlic and was surprisingly subtle. The pork belly was the last to arrive - it was 13.99 on the menu and from price alone I would have not guessed it would be an entire pork belly. To be honest, the pork was quite dried out - if you want to be make decent pork belly you need to cook it for a very short time or preferably, for a very long time, which they clearly did not do. The flavor was good though - I manages to reinvigorate the pork by smothering it in the five-spicy sauce. \nThe prices were all pretty fair, and the service was fast, though nothing stood out as particularly good.
