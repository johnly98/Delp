I've heard all about Sam Wo for decades but haven't visited until recently. \n\nMaybe it's the hype, maybe it's the press, maybe it's the reopening, but I had pretty high expectations for Sam Wo. Unfortunately, everything came up short. \n\nBBQ Pork Rice Noodle Roll - one of the, if not the, most popular dish here. The rice noodle was thick and hard. The BBQ pork was bland and dry. Ask for mustard, hot sauce, or soy sauce to give this some flavor. \n\nFish Jook - some people like their porridge super watery while others like it thick, to each their own. I actually like the consistency of the porridge here since it's between the two. However, for a Fish Jook, the fish is supposed to be the star of dish and it wasn't very fresh so it came out very bland. \n\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup - beef was tender and noodles had the right chewiness to it. Although the broth could be a bit richer, this dish always hits the spot. \n\nDuck Chow Mai Fun - more like lo mai fun instead of chow mai fun, but I think it tastes better this way. The sauce gives the noodles a nice savory and fragrant aroma to it.", "author": "Nancy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-23", "description": "\"There comes a time when the world gets quiet and the only thing left is your own heart...\"\n\nDeja Vu all over again. Sam Wo is legendary for being known as San Francisco's oldest restaurant. No official records exists, but historians date this \"Hong Kong\" style eatery back to around the great San Francisco quake of 1906. The earliest surviving photo of this historic restaurant dates to 1912, and the aged restaurant already looked old! I've been here before, well maybe not in 1906 silly, but back with the ex, pre-yelp days, and at the original location. Ohhh boy, the old location was like eating in a dungeon, and if you were lucky, or unlucky enough, you were served by the honorary Edsel Ford Fong aka \"World's Rudest Waiter\". Sadly he passed away decades ago, but his notorious ways are what urban legends are made of. Today many imitators and knock offs try to capture his sarcasm, but Edsel Ford Fong was an original and that will never be replaced. His \"rude waiter\" style was so over the top that it was more like a hilarious episode of Seinfeld. Yet, there was still a reclusive charm about him... and a restaurant called Sam Wo. \n\nLast night I was feeling a bit nostalgic so decided to drop in to Sam Wo. Realize much has changed since a decade ago... a move down the road, the wife left me for another woman, and the prices oh the prices have caught up with the times. Yet, it was no turning back, son. The \"new\" Sam Wo is much bigger than the dungeon-ish old location, but it's actually still in an older building. And ironically it still has that rickety old steps to the second floor. \n\nI enter with no fanfare and there's no spirit of Edsel Ford Fong anywhere. It's a new restaurant with the old menu and a story of once was... but hey, it's okay and times must go on. I did find many framed photos and newspaper clippings of the old location on the walls everywhere, so that was a nice touch. \n\nI settle in and order the famous Won Ton Soup (w/ the BBQ Pork) and a side of Spring Rolls. Hot Tea is a must, unless you go the alcohol route. It was crowded, but a managed chaos of patrons. A mixture of local Asians, European tourists, and San Franciscans just clinging on to the old story. And before you know it... my dinner is served in your typical Chinatown ware. Yes, please. The Spring Rolls were nice and crisp. The Won Ton Soup was also a win... except I'd pass on the BBQ Pork topping next time. The Chinese Tea complimented the meal like always. My neighboring tables were doing entree family style, and those meals looked darn good too, albeit pricier. \n\nIn the end, I'd recommend Sam Wo, but with a disclaimer attached - don't expect the Sam Wo of the past and expect prices of today, tbh I thought the entree prices were a bit steep for a Cantonese casual style restaurant. Yet, even though the legend of Sam Wo probably died a little with the passing of Edsel Ford Fong, his spirit is still here, I guess, maybe in the popular rice noodle appetizer? Time always moves on and the next generation will never experience the \"world's rudest waiter\", he was certainly original and in a funky century old building made this even more of a urban legend.", "author": "Eric R."}

It was definitely one of the spots to go to for people getting out of the clubs and are starvin' for some nourishment after some booty-shakin' sessions. \n\nMy friends first introduced me to this establishment when we were \"hanging around\" at 2 o'clock in the morning hungry for some late night grub. They ordered the scrambled egg with shrimp over rice and this has been like one of my comfort food since then. The difference between other places is they cooked the eggs runny, which is just the way I like it. I would sprinkle some pepper with a dash of soy sauce and mix it all up with the rice and it was heaven in my mouth. Yeah, it probably wasn't the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it was always the most delicious thing I've ever had at 3 o'clock in the morning. \n\nThe original location was on Washington Street, and claimed to be the oldest Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown as the records dates back to 1907, a year after the Great Earthquake in 1906. Back when we would frequent this place, there was a waiter on the 2nd floor we called \"Lee\" and although not as famous as Edsel Ford Fung (AKA \"World's Rudest Waiter), he certainly had his moments. I don't even know if his name was Lee since he never corrected us. My friends called him Lee, so I just rolled with it. \n\nAs the years passed and my party days were over, I did take my family here several times on rare occasions until Lee wasn't there anymore. I would always have a craving for the scrambled egg with shrimp dish and it never disappointed me. Then when they closed in 2012 due to health reasons, we thought that was the end of an era. \n\nFast forward to present day and this was my first visit in probably over ten  years. Although in a different location, just a block away, it still recaptures that essence of the original location. And the server we had was so very nice, a far different time and era has indeed begun. \n\nThe new menu is certainly different and more expansive than the previous place, but they still offered the runny scrambled egg with shrimp over rice. Although it didn't taste exactly the same as I remember it, it was close enough to bring me a little bit of joy with a slight tear in my eye. All the memories and experiences we've had at Sam Wo came out like a floodgate. We've witnessed so many things (good, bad and weird) that I can probably write a whole novel on this restaurant alone with different chapters, I kid you not. \n\nIs it the best Chinese food out there? No, and far from it. But it holds a special place in my heart full of nostalgia from a different era of San Francisco that I miss. Or maybe the friend that I lost too early, who introduced me to this place at a young age, who was probably smiling from above as we stepped back in time just to catch a glimpse of yesterday.", "author": "John G."}

Going upstairs felt like I was in Asia for sure (like how not fancy and slightly unclean everything is) and we didn't actually wait that long after I put my name on the wait list. \n\nI'm surprised at how good the noodles are, like a guilty pleasure type of feeling. It's not gourmet or Michelin type but it does taste authentic and comforting, like my grandma made it. The garlic gai lan was a bit too garlicky for my taste but it helped to balance our carb-loading with some veggies.

One of the clips is an episode of Conan O'Brien where Conan pokes fun at the restaurant, partly for being run down and unsanitary. \"Wow, these guys are good sports\", I thought to myself. Almost immediately afterwards, I noticed that the cook (a section of the kitchen is completely visible from the cashier's counter) had a persistent cough. Half of the time he was coughing without covering his mouth, directly over the food he was preparing. The other half he was coughing into the back of his hand and then wiping his face with said back of hand, and getting back to preparing food bare-handed without the slightest pause. After watching this for a few minutes, the Conan clip seemed less light hearted and more mean spirited. \n\nFour stars were still in play for Sam Wo's, because what's a little mucus between a restaurateur and his guests? They had good buzz after all, and the menu was promising. Unfortunately, the dishes came up short. The pork noodle roll appetizer was fatty and sweet, but with a little too much cilantro for my taste. The combination wonton soup had pork and shrimp; it had plenty of wontons and meat, but could have used some salt. The chow mein and chow fun were decent yet similarly bland. The sesame chicken was good, though offset by the Mongolian beef, which was honestly sort of heinous. \n\nEveryone I know tells me that SF Chinese food is supposed to be superior to the Seattle offerings.

The place is located across the street from the park where all the people are playing cards and Chinese checkers. \n\nThe good item is the meat rolls, which are like rice paper rolled pieces of BBQ pork, served with a delicious mustard sauce. The mustard is one of those yellow hot and spicy kinds that you usually see served at dim sum, but it is mixed with a soury vinegar like substance, and also sweetened, which ended up complimenting the BBQ pork rolls really well. That would have been given a 4 star!\n\nUnfortunately, I also got the Duck Dry Mixed Noodles, which wasn't nearly as good, and in some ways, quite bad. There were a ton of noodles, which was great, but the duck tasted like it was just boiled, and had the meat shredded off of it and placed on top of the noodles, and then they added lettuce and green onions on top. \n\nNot quite the most delicious dish.

I ordered Beef Chow Fun and Wonton Noodle Soup from Caviar delivered to my house.\n\nNever had I had worse chow fun AND wonton soup from any other Chinese restaurants in my LIFE. I am truly baffled how a Chinese restaurant can't even \"meet expectations\" on two STAPLES of a Chinese cuisine - This only goes to show the quality of the rest of their food. \n\nThe chow fun was SUPER oily, but the worst part was, it had ZERO flavor. Usually, these noodles are oily because the more oil the more flavor. I'm not sure how this equation worked out here. It felt like they  put a bunch of oil in the wok, and let the noodles swim around in the oil for a very undercooked amount of time. Voila no flavor. No salt. No soy sauce. Most of the onions were just plain raw. WTF. I won't even let the stringy and chewy beef get in the way of this complaint, but that was just the cherry on top. I was eating chunks of flavorless noodles that had congealed together. \n\nThe wonton noodle soup was just flabbergastingly bad. Forget al dente noodles, these noodles were beginning to liquify in my soup. WTF. Did they use expired noodles? The wontons themselves were terrible. The meat was showing through the poorly wrapped and broken wonton skins, and a lot of them were RED. Not normal for wonton meat. I ate a couple, and the craftsmanship sucked.

But really, it tastes very yummy in general... However, it's the perfect ending to a drunken night out. I was introduced to this lovely spot by none other than my fellow Yelpers! After going to a few bars in the area, we had worked up a bit of an appetite. It was suggested that we hit up Sam Wo, and I was all for it! I wasn't all for the journey of a walk that it took to get there though (everything seems farther away when you've been drinking).\n \nWhen we arrived, I was a little stunned. At first glance, this place looked super tiny. We were guided up a flight of stairs by a host and lo and behold; they had a second floor with tables to accommodate larger parties. I noticed that they also had a TV in the corner that was playing an Asian soap opera in the background. There was 7 of us in total, so you know we were about to be feastin' it up!\n \nThe spread:\n \n*BBQ pork rice rolls\n*Salt & pepper chicken wings\n*Noodle wonton soup\n*Beef chow fun\n*Wonton noodle soup\n*Mongolian beef\n*Sesame chicken\n*Shrimp fried rice\n*Pork Jook (porridge)\n \nI have to say that overall, I was pretty impressed! It didn't take them long to prepare everything and one by one, our dishes began to arrive right after one another. I would say that I enjoyed the Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and the wonton noodle soup the most. I looove Mongolian beef and although it wasn't spicy, it presented great flavor. The wonton noodle soup was hot and the broth tasted great! The sesame chicken was super on point; not overly sweet or over battered with a little bit of crunch. I didn't particularly care of the pork jook or the salt & pepper wings. The pork jook lacked seasoning and the salt & pepper wings were a little too salty. A few of noticed the mounds on salt that had been loaded on the fried skin. Despite the minor mishaps, everything else tasted really good!\n \nThe service was pretty much spot on! There was one gentleman in general who serviced our table for the entire time that we were there, and he pretty much remained upstairs for the duration of the time. We were stuffed! When the bill came, I was actually shocked! All of that food only costed us a total of $100! One thing I LOVE when it comes to Chinese food is when it's good and CHEAP! I can't forget to mention that this place is open until 3 am on the weekends! We rolled in there around midnight and didn't end up leaving until after 1 am.\n \nAll in all, this is an excellent spot for some late night grub when you're in the city!

The house fried rice I will say was family size huge and didnt skimp on the chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, or scrambled egg. The problem was it had zero seasoning of any kind and wasnt fried at all.

Most of the dishes are $7 - 11  USD.\n\nA lot of the dishes at Sam Wo are VERY simple. It's always some combination of (Soup) + veggies + meat + Noodles/rice. The meat portions are also quite small. Especially in the noodle stir fries, you can barely even see the meat since the slivers blend right into the dish. \n\nI also dislike how they only have two types of noodles: rice noodles and egg noodles. I really like thick/heavy/hand-pulled options, but it seems to me that a lot of their ingredients are premade.\n\nI ordered the beef rice noodle soup - decent. The beef in my beef noodle soup consisted mostly of fatty parts. I would say 40% of the chunks were actual lean meat. Also, there were NO vegetables apart of green onions (they don't count!). They don't even have cilantro or radish :( which I think are absolutely essential for beef noodles. The broth was very savoury and rich, but it was very \"one-dimensional.\" Maybe they used a poor quality soy sauce, or not enough ginger... either way... the noodles back home are MUCH better in comparison. The amount of noodles they put in the soup noodles versus the stir fry is also noticeably less... not sharable between duos or families.\n\nThe servers were very nice, and the place had a very authentic vibe, but I felt like this was more of an overrated tourist dining spot than anything else.

Well, I couldn't have any of that because I was in town for a wedding, but I hoped to find something, anything, that could come close to a home-cooked meal.\n\nAfter a quick search on Yelp, the fiance and I headed to Sam Wo Restaurant.  We added our name to the wait list and were immediately seated!  I saw that they had congee on the menu, and knew that I had to get it.  Specifically, I needed the preserved egg and pork congee, it's one of my ultimate comfort foods.  He was craving noodles, so he got the chicken chow fun.\n\nAt Sam Wo, they use thinner noodles than I normally expect for the chow fun, but, the sauce and seasoning for the dish were delicious.  He added some hot sauce on top, and he finished the mound of noodles in no time!\n\nMy congee was a little more bland than I'm used to, so I added some pepper and sipped away.

But something about San Wo still made me want to check them out.  Having not felt so well earlier I suggested somewhere to my friend that serves soup.  His office is by the TransAmerica building, and I think he's mentioned Sam Wo before too so I said why not and suggested to meet here for lunch.  \n\nWe were easily able to get a table upstairs, which yes is a bit awkward but roomier than downstairs.  I got the BBQ pork wonton noodle soup, and he got the house special chow fun.  He also asked for a coke.  The young waiter served it to him with just the can.  No glass, no straw, just the can.  Who does this?  Now not to stereotype but I'm Chinese, third generation ABC (American Born Chinese) to be exact, yet I still do what my grandparents used to do with soda, the rare occasions I get a can of soda, I rinse and wipe it down then I pour it into a separate glass.  There's actually a decent amount of Chinese people, including those who are grannies that dine here, and I know if they drank soda they would be doing the same thing, so I don't know why he didn't even bring my friend a glass or the very least a straw to drink it out of.  \n\nAnyways, onto the food.  The broth had that clean taste and didn't make me thirsty.  But it was a bit bland which makes me think that they dont use MSG.  The wonton filling is a bit stingy and I think it's all pork instead of the usual shrimp and pork mix.  Also they were pretty darn pink still (however I've seen articles saying sometimes this still happens when boiling).  Noodles were fine.  The texture of the cha siu (BBQ pork) was almost too soft.  It was lean too with no actual BBQ portion such as the nice sweet salty char.  I was also disappointed how they didn't include any bok choy.  His house special chow fun used thinner noodles than what's typically used in chow fun.  His tasted slightly better than mine, but like someone else mentioned this dish definitely missed the seasoned wok taste.  He had to use a lot of soy sauce and chili sauce as well.\n\nWhat's also kinda neat but odd about Sam Wo is the upstairs seating, we had to take a four seater table and it had extra seating on the side against the wall area in which I put my purse and jacket on.  But this was also intrusive when the grannies at the table in front of us left, and came was a noisy fobby lady with her even noisier three girls.  It seems like she knew a lot of the restaurant employees, perhaps a family friend or just a frequent customer, but literally we did and the guy to the next table kept staring at them whenever they would open their big mouths, but they wouldn't ask her if she could tone down her screaming or her kids' screaming, and with how the upstairs area is sound travels a lot.  The waitress that took over for our original waiter at the end was better than he was, but not even that can save Sam Wo in my opinion.\n\nThere's still some better spots in Chinatown for legit, non touristy Chinese food.  Sam Wo is slightly pricier than most quick Cantonese spots and I honestly don't know why because the food is so subpar.  I do have to say that it seems fairly clean for a spot in Chinatown though.  Get your jook, wonton mein, or chow fun fix elsewhere.", "author": "Cat C."}

The pork itself was pretty good and I love the cilantro that was in it.  But, I prefer it the other way.  Also good was the Chinese Broccoli.  It had a good garlic kick and was still crunchy.  As for the rest of our entrees, again, they were just ok.  Nothing else to say.\n\nThere is an upstairs area, which we didn't go to.  But, that just means more seating.

One weekday evening, I came here with a friend and was seated upstairs. At first glance, the interior is pretty cramped, which is to be expected I guess. After much deliberation, I ordered the B.B.Q. Pork Curry Noodle Soup, mostly because that was the one dish that stood out on the menu, apart from the Sampan Jook and the Pickled Cabbage Shredded Pork Mai Fun Soup. \n\nWhen my dish arrived, I eyeballed it and there was a scoop of curry powder near the top of the dish, slightly submerged into the soup. Prior to mixing the powder into the soup, the soup tasted a bit bland. After mixing the curry powder in, there was a strong taste bitter-like dish in the soup. I personally thought that there was going to be a thick curry sauce in the soup but I don't think that's how it's normally made. Anyways, the B.B.Q. pork didn't make an impression on me, and the noodles were okay. One thing I couldn't understand was why there was a dash of ketchup atop this dish. The ketchup had no synergy with the rest of the dish and I was left wondering if they meant to put sriracha in there instead. \n\nOverall, the dish was alright, although I wouldn't recommend ordering the soup dishes judging from this experience. Perhaps I should have ordered the jook instead with a side of Chinese donuts. The service was normal and nothing out of the ordinary.

Luckily, Sam Wo was walkingu distance from the bars that we had been at so getting there was not a problem. What also attracted us to Sam Wo was that it opens late hours, during the weekends they are open till 3AM! Yayy Baby! Sock up those late night alcoholic drinks! \n\nThe tradition and history of this place and Edsel Ford Fong is amazing to read about. Apparently the restaurant is in a newly opened location (former place was opened in 1912).\n\nMy Yelp friends and I entered and was greeted right away from the friendly staff. When you walk in you don't assume that they have an upstairs so I was totally shocked to hear that they had room for a group of 7 people. Less than 5 minutes later, we were being directed to an upstairs that had about 3 big tables. (They totally can cater large groups upstairs, don't let the downstairs seating discourage you). \n\nWhat was on the menu? Tons of yummy food! OMG! Its just something about eating after you've had some delicious drinks where EVERYTHING we ordered tasted extra delicious! Let me tell you what we had from the menu:\n-Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings\n-Beef Chow Fun\n-Mongolian Beef\n-Wonton Soup\n-Shrimp Fried Rice\n-Sesame Chicken\n-BBQ Pork Rice Noodle Roll\n\nI was completely expecting to wait a long time for our food but my table was surprised to see the food come out in less than 10 minutes. It was so much food that we decided to eat family style and it was the BEST decision! The portions were super generous and the prices of the food items were so reasonable!  I was able to try everything that was on the table and my favorite was those BBQ Pork Rice Noodle Rolls! OMG! Makes me wonder why I haven't explored this part of the City until now! (Where have I been?)\n\nOverall, great night filled with tons of fun and catching up with friends! I totally recommend Sam Wo if you are in the area! Not only is the food really delicious but the customer service is top notch (Thank you Howard & the rest of the staff!

I did note to add pei dan (aka thousand year old egg, preserved egg, etc) which they did. Not sure if we got charged extra for that, but I actually brought an egg from home just in case. I love extra pei dan, so it came in handy. I also noted extra cilantro and green onions which they didn't seem to do. There was a little in the jook itself, but I thought I would get an extra side. I ended up adding green onions I had at work, so it worked out anyways. The jook itself was a little bland to me. I had to add salt and a bunch of white pepper to give it more flavor. The chinese doughnut (you zha guo / you tiao) was delicious. Oily as they normally are, but super savory and comforting. The perfect accompaniment to soak up the jook.\n\nDecent option for jook, but I wished it had more flavor. And I wish I had gotten my extra cilantro and green onion.

I like the proportion of the beef to the veggies (onion, bellpeppers). Perfect seasoning and the one dish we have ordered 3/3 times we have been ther.e \n\nChop suey: Veggies are steamed perfectly, but otherwise not very notable.

It's a cold dish so it felt like it was lacking a little something since the BBQ pork was also cold. Still, I was too hungry to care. You can dip it in horseradish (also called chinese mustard) but be careful to not dip too much since it's spicy and the feeling travels up to your nose and makes you regret everything.\n\nWe also tried one of their chow fun dishes and a porridge.

Service was excellent, but definitely nothing special about the foods. I've had much better tasting foods at other Chinese restaurants. This one seems to be the spot for westerners and tourists.

The BBQ pork isn't sweet with any glazed crust layer. The BBQ in the roll tasted soft but more on a steamed side. There was no cilantro in it. It looked like more stems of cilantro versus leaves. My mom tried it and said the BBQ pork had no flavor, the rice noodle seemed thicker than the old one from their old shop, and she didn't taste cilantro either. So disappointed.

The atmosphere is much laid back and ongoing as I welcomed there. The concept is much simple for this relocated place. Much spacious for both floors with good ample of tables to sit. The interior design is very modern and contemporary giving this place called home like the revised Jade Fountain Cafe in Sacramento.\n\nThe employees from servers and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me a sensational service! Very friendly and approachable. No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered the chicken fried rice, and so far as I ate it, it tasted delicious and flawless! The seasoning of that fried rice is top notch and the chicken cooked perfectly for perfection including the rest of the ingredients too. I've heard about their well known appetizer of BBQ Pork Rice Noodle roll for a while. I haven't tasted it after my first visit, yet I'll be back next time in the near future.\n\nParking at Sam Wo can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearest surface street parking nor the Portsmouth Parking garage (closest) if it's available. Alternatively, you can ride a bike, walk, carpool or public transportation easier without the hassles or gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Sam Wo the most coolest and remarkable local Chinese restaurant that I've ever dined in for the first time to eat good Chinese food for less than $10! Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering of all ages! A well visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

My House Chow Mein was awesome, lots of yummy ingredients that really came in for an awesome flavor. The Tomato Beef Chow Mein is exactly how it sounds.

Nevertheless, it was an awesome lunch.\n\nI kept eyeing the fried spring rolls and noodle rolls around me. If I could eat more, I would have definitely ordered those too.

They told me about the infamous Edsel Ford Fong and how you had to go through the kitchen to get to the dining room on the second floor. I ate there once several years ago at their old location, and I wanted to check it out again while I was in town. I had no idea how famous or how old this place was until I Googled it to get directions.\n\nThe new restaurant is a little more organized than the old one, I feel, and from the memorabilia on the walls you can tell they really play up their historical significance, but at the end of the day, the food was cheap, filling, and good. I feel like even if some of the character of the old place might be gone, but it still manages to be everything someone would want from a late night eatery.", "author": "Charles D."}

It met the expectation, what can I say? I got the Chow Mein with Beef and Greens ($8.95). For that price, I was served a huge portion of Chow Mein. I really liked how textured the noodles were, very soft but chewy. Also it grabbed onto the sauce pretty well. My only problem is that the beef was too chewy, not tender at all. Also the greens was a huge piece green onion, which I'm not sure how to eat. \n\nOverall, good place at good price, no complaining there. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? Will come back and try again for sure.", "author": "Vivienne C."}

I kept brushing up against the guy that sat behind me.  There was a TV screen showing the history of the restaurant and a lot seems to have changed.  The service was great though.  They were very friendly and recognized when we had finished our meals.\n\nI got the BBQ Pork Wonton Noodle Soup and my friend got an egg scramble with shrimp.  My noodle soup was just OK.  I was expecting larger slices of BBQ pork, but instead got strips with barely any bbq parts.  The wonton, noodles, and broth were fine.

I looked at the reviews at this place hoping to have a great experience. I knew I should've turned back when their audio playback discussed how the restaurant shut down due to health safety. \n\nThe wait to get a seat on a Friday at 2230 at night was probably the best part of the experience because I was really hungry! The worse part of the experience was when they decided to seat me three feet away from the restroom. Customers constantly stood behind me waiting for the restroom and this experience continued throughout the entire time I was there. \n\nI still decided to give this place a shot as I've been to whole in the wall joints that have horrible service and seating but great food. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those places. Based on other reviews and popular dishes that night, I decided to order the beef wonton noodle soup, a wonton soup (for my wife), and the Chinese doughnuts to share. As soon as I received my order I noticed it looked very bland. Upon the first few bites, I found the food very tasteless with no flavor that it almost made me feel nauseous. My wife and I immediately stop eating, paid for the meal and walked out of the restaurant.\n\nI would never recommend this overhyped place to even my enemies (now that I will have some after this review).", "author": "Leonardo D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-27", "description": "I ended up at Sam Wo as it is one of the few restaurants in Chinatown that is open late. During my first visit I decided to get the beef and wanton noodle soup ($8.99) to-go. After ordering to my surprise Sam Wo took payment via credit card and provided a receipt which is completely out of character when compared to its peers in Chinatown. After ordering it was a short 5 minute wait and I was on my way.\n\nAs expected they provided a single container with both the noodles and the broth. This is a problem as by the time you reach home the noodles completely absorb the broth and become soft. I decided to eat this as soon as I got home (which is not too far from Sam Wo). What the soup had going for it was the broth and the wantons. The broth was unlike the watery broth that you get in other Chinese places. It was like the thick broth that you get in good Ramen places. The wantons were also very good. They did seem to tear and split easily but they were good. Obviously what let this dish down were the noodles that were thin vermicelli type of noodles that I am not a very big fan off. The advantage of having thin noodles is that they don't soak up a lot of the broth and become soft.\n\nDuring my second visit I was provided a menu which was so sticky that it would need to be burnt by people in hazmat suits. Anyway I ignored this and decided to get the same beef and wanton noodle soup to-go. I made a cardinal mistake of asking a question. Can I get the thick flat noodles instead of the standard noodles? Oh man. What a reaction. I was tag teamed by two grumpy servers who made me repeat this over and over again. Finally they scolded me for not knowing that I wanted \"fun\" noodles and that I should remember this the next time I make such a request anywhere. What? Where is this attitude coming from? Is it so difficult to substitute regular noodles with flat noodles without knowing the technical term for it? I've never faced this problem anywhere else. If there can be no substitution I am told No, but this kind of bad attitude I've never got. I wanted to ask them to give the noodles on the side but after the attitude that I went through to get a simple substitution done, I wisely decided against that. Anyway after ordering it was again a small 5 minutes wait and I was on my way.\n\nThis time the experience with the food was worse. The broth and wantons were good but the \"fun\" noodles had turned to mush. I should have stuck to the regular noodles, would have had a better dish and have avoided the attitude. So remember if you want noodles that can stand in for baby food please ask for \"fun\" noodles at Sam Wo.\n\nSam Wo falls into the places that I categorize as \"entitled\". These places feel that they have a right to give bad service just because they exist. Thank You but I'll pass.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I'd like to believe it was just an off day for the soup. I did enjoy the Duck Chow Fun! This was perfectly seasoned and not overly greasy or salty. Plus, they give you large chunks of duck.

We asked the lady serving us what she recommended since we're from Seattle and has never ate their food before. She recommended some good ones and we ordered. The BBQ Pork Noodle Roll was pretty good. I thought it was a good appetizer. We also ordered the House Chow Mein and the House Fried Rice, which I have to say were the best out of everything we ordered. We also ordered the House Chow Fun and the House Chow Mai Fun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-03", "description": "When the original Sam Wo closed down.. I was a tad bit sad about it since I had gone here a few times with my husband. I also was already moved out of the city by the time the original Sam Wo closed so I thought i'd never be able to eat there again until they later opened this location.\n\nI originally went to chinatown to try that new Chinalive thing. First.. didn't know its only opened for dinner. It also JUST HAPPENS to be closed on the Sunday I went there to try it. I ended up walking around and remembered Sam Wo had reopened elsewhere so Hubbie and I headed over to give this place a try.\n\nThe BBQ Pork Rolls were good. I don't like the sauce they serve with it but the rolls are definitely a must. Hubbie ordered... I think it was Egg & Beef over rice.... it did NOT look appealing at all. Super heavy and covered in gravy. He also said it wasn't the best and wasn't too happy with the dish. I ordered a wonton noodle soup. I didn't know how much of a difference it was from ordering the normal wonton noodle soup to the combo wonton noodle soup (actually can't remember what its called but there was a few different options of wonton soup). My soup came out very bland. I wasn't too pleased with my dish either. I was expecting a flavorful hearty bowl of wonton noodle soup. Our salt & pepper Chicken wings were just DRENCHED in salt. I wish they didn't cover it in salt because the chicken itself was actually quite juicy. But that salt just ruins everything. Most chinese restaurants that make this appetizer isn't as salty but here at Sam Wo....it made me feel like i just took a tablesoon of salt with a hint of chicken. The food here.. aside those rolls....really reminds me of those Chinese restaurants that don't make a lot of business type of comfort food. \n\nHonestly... if you come here to eat. JUST GET THE ROLLS. I don't really recommend getting anything else as the flavor and taste of the food has changed drastically NOT for the better. They are quite crowded here... I guess all the tourist and news about this place really helped this small tiny restaurant get tonssss of people in. Hubbie was even saying... you mainly see a lot of white people here and not too many Chinese people here. I think that says something if Chinese people don't eat here.", "author": "Linda L."}

Open for a 100 years (or something like that) and having the worlds most famous rude waiter (according to the menu), Sam Wo is a restaurant that received enormous press when it burned down and had a prolonged and well published effort to remodel and reopen. \n\nHow come is it that I've never been? (And I've been going to Chinatown all my life) \n\nAdmittedly, Sam Wo was our third stop for a late night snack (they're famously open until 4 am), but I wanted to check out what the fuss was. \n\nLuckily, we dropped by just as a seat opened but a line of tourists and regulars alike soon lined out the door.  My first bad sign: I didn't see a lot of Chinese people. \n\nThe menu was a simple one and highlights include their chow fun, fish jook, and BBQ pork rice noodles.   Service was very friendly from both the cashier (owner?) and staff.  English is the language of choice.  Our order:\n\nFish jook - $7.50.  A large and generous bowl of jook with plentiful scallions and lots of minced ginger was ready very quickly and we took a sip.  Temperature was luke warm to cold.  My wife said it probably was served piping hot.  But they just delivered it! I reminded her.  Maybe it's the cold ginger and scallions.  As an SF native, she had more experience with Sam Wo and perhaps her nostalgia was impeding her judgment. \n\nI liked the chunks of quality fish but found even the jook average.  Not cooked long enough and no flavor in itself.  I poured on Chinese pepper and it was little better.  Pass. \n\nI thought perhaps that Sam Wo was the real deal but I'm much more fond of Sam Woo (from SoCal and Vegas).  Maybe there is a reason I've never been.  Give me Hing Lung for jook instead.  \n\nI probably should come back to try more one dish but Chinese friends more familiar says it was an institution but more for longevity than anything else.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-23", "description": "Several years (two? one?) ago over lunch break a friend of mine and I went to Chinatown during our regular lunch walk. I saw a sign that says Sam Wo was closed due to building safety reason. Sam Wo was special to me. When I was just out of college, I liked to go clubbing on Saturday nights. There used to be this dance club atop of Westin St. Francis, called Oz. On Saturday evenings, it had a disproportionately large number of older white male population (30s-40s) to the female and younger Asian (early 20s) population. Every Saturday after the club was closed, my friends and I would come here, hungry and giddy, in stilettos and short skirts, almost always with some misc. white men in tow. We always sat upstairs, always ordered the same duck wonton noodle soup for everyone at the table, and always ordered them in Chinese. It was the best, cheapest food in town at 2:30 AM. \n\nThere was something really surreal about this restaurant, it felt like it should be from an old movie, so Chinese, so Asian, so different than the rest of the city. We enjoyed shocking our white guests as much as we enjoyed the food. We repeated this routine week after week, for years on end. \n\nThat memories gradually faded with the end of an era.\n\nA few months back, I read on the paper that the restaurant had reopened and moved to a new location. It made me to want to return; if anything, I wanted to see if the food was really as good as I had remembered. \n\nSam Wo has not really changed that much. They still have an upstairs and downstairs. They had old sign that says \"open until 3 am.\" There was still a dumbwaiter system but newer than the old, and they seem to bring dishes by walking upstairs instead.\n\nAs I sat and waited for my duck wonton noodle soup (off the menu, just order that and they know because it was not on the menu 20+ years ago either), I posted a picture of the restaurant on FB. One of my girlfriends said, \"What? Is it still there?\" She remembered coming here in the 80s with her friends. Some old Chinese waiter would yell at them, and she, then a blonde blue eyed young girl born and raised in the Bay Area, always complied with his order out of fear. \"The food was so good that I didn't care. Those are some of my best memories.\" She added.\n\nSam Wo is a 100 years old, according to its signage.  It serves authentic San Francisco Chinatown Cantonese food. I know it's a mouthful but it's super important to note that. You can't get this anywhere else, not in Canton province, not in Hong Kong, not in Macau, not EVEN on Clement or Irving or Noriega street. ONLY in San Francisco Chinatown. It's still super inexpensive. And, it seems that everyone has a story of their own with Sam Wo. \n\nIt's a real San Francisco institution. And now it's reopened, I trust new memories will be created for generations to come.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I was in town and decided to hit the new spot. I must say it was more than I expected. The old place was a dive but it was great food and service. Today they have the same great food, service AND a clean impressive location....They kept the same coziness with the upstairs seating and some small tables in the kitchen level.\n\nNow to the food:  The bbcue pork roll appetizers were as good as I remember...FRESH AND TASTY...and don't forget to dip in the spicy mustard... Also had The pork fried rice, sesame chicken, vegetable chow mein, salt/pepper chicken and wonton noodle soup.  (Not just me, There were 5 of us)...Also a welcome treat, wait for it................\nBEER!!!! A tsing Tao to enjoy with my meal...They have secured a liquor license so no more brown bagging it from the place across the street!!! \n\nAll in all 5+ stars...I'm old school been a fan since the mid 90s when I lived here. I kinda didn't like the tv's and the commercials playing with celebs etc. it takes away from the local hideaway late nite spot I remember but that's the only negative I have .... still 5+ stars. Also can't end without a shout out to the staff, especially Howard who made us feel at home and had a great attitude and excellent customer service.

But then we order and get our food pretty quick and then I understand; they are efficient, getting your order in quickly, cooked fast and then you enjoy the tasty! Win-Win-Win!!

I escaped work a little early to beat the traffic but there was none, haha. I used to live in San Francisco and I go quite often so I knew my way around. \n\nWalking here from Union Square took no more than 15 minutes. No hills but you go up Powell then be prepared to burn calories from the incline. The restaurant opens at 6 for dinner service. We got there around 6:15. I am so glad we came when we did because not too long after, the restaurant was packed! \n\nService was commendable. The gentleman spoke fluent English, was funny, welcoming, and knew the menu by heart. He convinced us to order the BBQ pork rice roll (banh cuon). This one is served w/ their spicy mustard (like horseradish) and I did not care for it (I used regular soy sauce) but seriously, after my initial bite, I kind of stayed silent for a few seconds because it was THAT good. The Chinese donut was fried perfectly and was a perfect addition to the chow fun. Though it was funny and cute that Gavin thought I ordered him an actual donut. The chow fun was delicious (dry-style). The wonton soup was good, I assume since my sister finished that w/o uttering a complaint. The Chinese chicken salad was huge! Definitely order this because it was filled w/ lots of chicken (super tender and juicy) and it was cheap! \n\nNot expensive but pricier than what I normally pay at a Chinese restaurant but I can say that I now know why this place gets packed and gets raved reviews. Man, I will order the entire menu next time!!!", "author": "Tram N."}

The second dish was the bbq pork wonton soup and it tasted like average wonton soup with bbq pork. Again it felt like they made a big batch of soup and added the toppings to whatever dish you get. Im sure if i order any other wonton soup or chow mein they would taste very similar. The last dish was the bbq pork rice noddles and this was unique but flavor wise it didn't blow me away.

It's got a pretty simple menu with an obvious focus on congee.  I went on the early side (...because I basically only had coffee for breakfast) so had no problem getting a seat.  But the first customer to have to wait was at about 12:05PM.  Then by the time I left around 12:30PM, there was a huge line out the door.  Pretty busy for a Monday right after a holiday weekend!\n\nBBQ Pork Rice Noodle Roll: The real super star of the meal.  BBQ Pork, like the kind you see hanging in shop windows around Chinatown.  A little cilantro.  Wrapped in a thick and soft rice noodle.  With some house-made hot mustard for dipping.  So many awesome flavors and textures going on.  One of the best appetizers I've had in Chinatown!\n\nDuck Jook: A bit bland, but that's basically what congee/jook is.  The duck had the texture of boiled chicken rather then more tantalizing Peking duck.  Not much else besides some scallions on top.  Good for a cold day and/or when you're nursing a cold.\n\nChinese Donut: Forget coffee, this really helps jazz up the jook.  Soak a pre-cut piece and then scoop of a spoonful of donut and jook.  The deep fried goodness does wonders to the experience.  It's no mystery why this is such a popular pairing.", "author": "Adam B."}

Problem is, what if your Asian mom doesn't live in SF? Sam Wo to the rescue!\n\nMy ultimate comfort food (besides mashed potatoes!) is preserved egg and pork jook / porridge. This place does a good job with giving you enough preserved egg and pork, and also doesn't add too much seasoning beyond the ingredients. I wish they'd add some green onion too. The BBQ pork rice rolls are definitely fresh (you can tell because the wrap is super soft), but the wrap is probably a bit thick for my liking. You can also order bowls of beef tendon here (both curry and original flavors!)-- ughhh such deliciousness. The beef and string bean stir fry I got once was also alright by Chinese standards. 100% authentic Cantonese food for sure-- I'm Cantonese, trust me. I always lol at the people who eat at authentic Chinese spots and are angry that they don't have soy sauce covered everything or demand another region's cuisine (ex: the guy on who complained that the chicken was not spicy and had no chilies). Dude, this is Cantonese food, it's never spicy and never has chilies.\n \nAs for service, this place is at times surprisingly non-Chinese; I've tried to order takeout in Cantonese and had to switch to English because the server only spoke English, and the shop is kept quite clean and actually somewhat decorated (which is super weird for Chinese shops). They accept credit cards!\n\n--\n\nEdit: I came back recently for some comfort noms. The thousand year old egg in the porridge was kinda sour, which I've encountered before, but sorta made the porridge less enjoyable.

I wanted to snap a picture of my tall friend while he was walking the steps with the sign \"Watch your step\" in the background, but I guess I was too late for that... The restaurant had a lot of comfy wooden chairs and booths plus the environment was intimate yet noisy. It almost reminded me of stepping into one of my Chinese friend's home and eating some of his delicious food!\n\nFood:\n\nUghhh.. The food was to die for!! There was one item on the menu I did not like! Everything was cooked well with the perfect crisp and sauce. Nothing was too salty or horribly oily to handle. Everything about it was O.M.G. DELICIOUS! Words can't explain how much I love their food, but I guess you'll have to be there to believe how awesome their food tastes.\n\nCustomer Service:\n\nThey're the nicest group of Asians I've met so far in SF Chinatown.

It was pretty awesome how honest they were as to how much food we should buy to feed five hungry people!\n\nOverall:\n\nDespite the horrible parking and all things negative, I wouldn't mind coming back here again for the comforting Chinese food and the superior customer service!", "author": "Aubrey D."}

Surely you remember Conan O'Brien's commercial for the old Sam Wo's about eight years ago (video: http://bit.ly/1kBvmLI). I ate there back then, and I have to admit the hilarious faux-ad was pretty accurate in its skewering (review: http://bit.ly/1XWoOG8). Yet, when it closed three years ago due to owner David Ho's inability to bring it up to code, I felt a slight twitch in my stomach. Perhaps it was acid reflux in memoriam. That was mean as Sam Wo, as dilapidated as it was and as indifferent as their servers were, still served decent, middle-of-the-road Chinese food, take it or leave it. Jamie W. and I decided to give the new place a try.\n\nIt's at a different address on Clay Street opposite Portsmouth Square where a group of mostly women dance in unison to the beat of Chinese pop music. This was where Anna Bakery used to be because I remember how hard their almond sugar cookies used to get. We walked in and didn't enter the kitchen like I used to at the old place. The kitchen is toward the side behind glass like a normal restaurant (photo: http://bit.ly/1LYUZzr). The immersive greasy spoon vibe was gone and so was the dumbwaiter. I don't mean a dumb waiter, I mean the pulley-operated elevator that transported the food to the second floor..\n\nThere are still two floors, and the tables still have the formica tops and backless stools. Don't get too comfortable, but the restroom looks new. Enjoy that while it lasts. The menu is all laminated now and filled with familiar dishes. We decided to start with the $6.95 Wonton Soup with BBQ Pork, and we both were able to get two small bowlfuls out of it. It was pretty good with the broth clearer than we expected and a lot of wontons (photo: http://bit.ly/1ME20Tn). More vegetables could have helped for contrast, but this is Sam Wo's, not Eric's, so get over it. Then we had the $8.50 Chow Fun with Duck (photo: http://bit.ly/1MPBzR4).\n\nAgain it was no-frills with just bean sprouts and a few chopped scallions added in. We were pretty convinced that we got chicken instead of duck until I overheard the server at another table explaining how they don't roast duck here. So OK it could have been duck. We ended our meal with one of their premium dishes, the $10.25 Sesame Chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/20D5ujD). Because Jamie has been on a General Tso's tear lately, he figured that would be within proximity of it. It was, maybe a little too crunchy (i.e., overcooked) and the portion wasn't near Henry's Hunan sizes. All in all, it was not a disappointing experience but if you're looking for the cranky, greasy \"charm\" of the original, let it go.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...decent Chinese dishes unadorned with spices or hearty vegetables, not much different than the dishes of yore\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...it's clean and still crowded,..no health hazards to be seen so far\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...no crotchety old waiters like Edsel, just young servers who were surprisingly attentive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Sam Wo, we hardly recognized ya", "author": "Ed U."}

I have to say that after sitting down and looking around at the very spartan interior, I had very, VERY low expectations. \n\nI ordered the Ma Po Tofu, the Hubs had shrimp fried rice, the Wee one got a big bowl of wanton soup with noodles, and we split an order of spring rolls. Nothing was fancy, but everything was delicious. \n\nThe spring rolls were crisp and yummy (I wish we ordered a double helping they were so good). My kid's soup was LOADED with delicious wontons and tons of fresh eggy noodles. My Ma Po tofu was delicious and came stir fried with Chinese pickled vegetables (an unexpected but yummy addition). The Hubs fried rice was one of the better versions I've seen in a while and loaded up with lots of big fat shrimp. All the portions were large, and the flavors were spot on.\n\nThe next time I'm in China Town, I will be having lunch at San Wo again.", "author": "Julie T."}

All three were excellent, but the Dry Mixed Noodles might be my new favorite Chinese dish. I think my description could do it no justice, but it was so good we were all fighting over it.\n  The staff was great, I had two kids with me, and they were not sure what to order.

Very tender and flavorful. \n- Spring rolls. Ok. Very crispy, which is a must for me, but left me wishing for a protein like shrimp or pork inside. \n- Chinese donut. Not my favorite. Bland and cold - wouldn't order again \n- Two types of Chow fun. Both were excellent. Noodles were a bit greasy, but that's to be expected with an oily sauce. Super tender as were the beef, pork, and shrimp. \n- Chicken Chop Suey. Not good. In their defense, this wasn't on the menu, but we requested that they add chicken to their vegetable chop suey. Chicken was fatty and bland. Not like the sueys were used to - more like chicken and vegetables in brown sauce. \n\nOverall, it's a must stop.

So many memories at the old location!\n\nModern, but thankfully, still good ol' Chinatown pricing.. slightly higher than what I remembered (inflation, y'all) but the portions are still generous.\n\n*MUST ORDER* BBQ RICE NOODLE ROLL: $5 AND STILL BOMB AF. Cha siu and cilantro wrapped in a sikly rice noodle and dipped in a liquidy spicy mustard sauce. Dip sparingly as it's like wasabi where it'll give you that same clearing sensation through your nose.\n\n*GOOD* GREEN BEANS: $8.50: heaping plate of green beans and enough to feed 3-4 people.. I'm used to this cooked more Northern style where it's more dry/fried - this was more of a stir fry with black bean sauce, still good though. Dat gravy would be good with rice!\n\n*YUMMEH* COMBINATION WONTON SOUP: $8. I actually never ordered wonton here before but my coworker said this was her go-to, so I trusted her. I thought $8 was kinda pricey but there's AT LEAST 6 large wontons in there along with some pork and cha siu. The wontons could be improved if there was more shrimp, but it's good the way it is, and fair for the price.\n\n*MUST ORDER* DUCK DRY MIX NOODLES $7: Now THIS was really the gift that kept on giving because damn, I don't know how we just kept pulling noodles outta this bowl. Honestly, the duck in this isn't that great, but I was eating it more for the noodles. Silky lo mein noodles lightly dressed with some kind of SUPER ADDICTING sauce. Flavorful even though the noodle color looked kinda plain.

It still retains the same vibe as the old place, but you no longer have to walk through the kitchen in order to get to the seats. I definitely recommend sitting upstairs, because it's nice and roomy up there and being up on the sort-of balcony gives you a unique experience that you don't get from other restaurants.\n\nAs for the food, I have never been disappointed by the dishes here. I definitely recommend the rice noodle rolls with pork as an appetizer. They also have excellent tomato beef chow mein and chow fun, with real tomatoes in it. (The tomato beef chow fun is not specifically on the menu, but you can ask for it). They also have a really good green bean dish with black bean sauce. \n\nThe service in the old days was a lot different than it is now.

This was often my after school meal and my family became regulars who brought thermoses and mini buckets to get their vaunted jook, wonton with and without noodles, and Chinese donut... well, it's actually a baguette shaped deep fried bread that is the perfect pairing with porridge; the Chinese words translate to \"oil fried ghost\" in Cantonese.  There was a crew of around four or five men who manned this place in those days, three in the kitchen while one or two worked the front of the house, if you could call it that.  Since most of my food was takeout, I did not encounter the famed Edsel Fong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsel_Ford_Fong) until my high school years.  He manned both the 2nd and 3rd floors for many years and became more famous than the food coming out of this Chinatown institution.  When the dance and club scene was along Broadway on the outer edge of the neighborhood, many intoxicated and sober partygoers would venture for late night meals and since this place opened until 2 am on weekends, a cult following grew.  For a summary of the reasons for Edsel's 'fame', just read the link above.  \nWell, the kitchen staff slowed passed over time and none of the next generation had interest in assuming seven day, twelve hour work shifts so the business was eventually sold after Edsel passed too.  Many believe the Edsel was the actual eccentric owner of the business and the rudeness and flirtatious behavior was merely a part of his act. \nOver time, as with most places in the neighborhood, the food quality and dining demographics changed to be a more budget conscious one.  The mainstays that stayed on the menu were their raw fish salad (steelhead) and BBQ port rice roll aks \"guen fun\" (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y1Gyl-FRdOBcowzhlAAzHg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  \nAfter a long and rocky hiatus, the business owners reopened and saved many relics like the signs to harken back memories of those times.  I recently placed a takeout order through Eat24 for two orders of the rice rolls, asking them in the special instructions section to pack them in separate containers as this was our pre-Warrior game meal on a recent weeknight.  Paid by credit card, the transaction went smooth and easy until I opened my bag at the Oracle parking lot and saw only one box.  Luckily, this was not a major issue since we just munched on the pieces like we would if eating sushi.  The flavor and textures were pretty much spot on, though it seemed a bit light on the cilantro.  The food ranks 3.5 stars, but I am docking them for the box issue, especially since there is a specific special instructions form to complete prior to sending the order.\nWill stop in and try the food one of these afternoons, but I will definitely temper my expectations.  In my mind, it'll never be the same.", "author": "Mike C."}

After waiting for 15mins we finally were seated. \nThe location is pretty small much like the old sam woo. But the waitress was really friendly when taking our order. We ordered the famous pork noodle roll and the porridge. Also chow mein with veggies and the scramble egg over rice. So when the pork noodle came that was delicious 5/5 stars.

Came up to SF for Chinese New Year and I knew I had to get some Sam Wo for the first time. I came around 3:30pm worried there was going to be a wait, to my surprise no wait, maybe because they were going to close soon. I came in and the staff were very welcoming. I sat down looked at the menu. My eyes wondered over the \"dry mix noodle\" section. I asked the waitress in Chinese what the dishes were. She said they were \"Lo mein\". Very interesting how they call It dry mix noodle. I ordered the duck dry mix noodle since on Yelp and Instagram it was the most common item that popped up. In a matter of 5 mins after ordering my mix noodle came! \n\nThe Lo mein is defiantly something you would not find in the San Gabriel Valley. The noodles came in a bowl and had green onions and lettuce on top! That's right ice berg lettuce! I quickly mixed it up to find the sauce and duck meat on the bottom. I took one bite and I was in heaven! The flavor of the gravy sauce with the noodles and duck were amazing! The green onions and lettuce were actually really good with the dish! I quickly gobbled it up and paid.\n\nSam Wo was so good I took my friends the next day for dinner! We ordered the tomato beef chow mein, wonton noodle soup, and Sichuan beef? I forgot haha. The dishes were great and tasted like classic old school Chinatown cooking. My all time favorite is still the duck dry mix noodle!

We met our kids here the other night for dinner and it was a joy to eat here.  The new place is on Clay Street-  They have a video screen out front which shows a short video of the history of Sam Wo and its a great way to share this special spot with folks.  \n\nThe food is good.  But really the best part of our night was our waiter HOWARD.  He is the epitome of a kind person and excellent customer service employee.  He is personable, outgoing and a long time member of the Sam Wo fan club.  \n\nWe ordered the BBQ Pork Rolls to start and continued with Tomato Cha Su Chow mein, Kung Pao Shrimp, Cruncy delicious string beans, Gai lan stir fried in Garlic and oil and a Chicken with Fun noodles.  It was delivered really quickly even thought it was super busy and it was hot and delicious!", "author": "Erin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "description": "At the risk of revealing my real age, I started going to Sam Wo more than 50 years ago,\n\nIt was a great place to eat late night. Open until 3 am, with no fried food after 1:30. \n\nSam wo was the home of the surly, loud Edsel Ford Fung, renown as the world's rudest waiter. It was all an act of course. Eddie fed many a hungery hippie who found himself out of money.\n\nTomato Pork Chow Mein was $1.75 a plate. Rice noodle roll was $1,00.\n\nSam wo closed on Washington St. A few years ago and has reopened in a new space a block away.\n\nThe stools and marble tables are still there as is the dumb waiter and the buzzer. Except it is now a OSHA safe and apptoved ELECTRIC DUMB WAITER WITH DOORS as opposed to yhe old shaft with a rope to shout the orders down to the kitchen and haul the dishes up to the 2nd fLOOR THAT edsel ruled supreme.\n\nCeramic tea pots have been replaced with stainless, they sell soda bnow, take credit xards, serve water, and sell souvenir t-shirts and bottled mustard.\n\nSo I ordered my old usual tomato pork chow mein now priced at a bargain $8.95.\n\nThe recipies are the same but the taste, while good, was a little off. Noodles were gumy and not as crispie or flavorful as I remember them.\n\nOn my way out I noticed why. Boxes of packaged won ton noodles, obviously made by machines in a factory.\n\nAt the original Sam Wo they made the noodles in house, by hand. There is a difference.\n\nSo while I wish I could rate higher because I cried when the original closed, the new version is not as good due to buying processed foods with perservatives added.\n\nBut as they say, you can never go back.\n\nSo if you never ate at the orginal, you'll probably like the food and the price is certainly right.\n\nThe spirit of Edsel still permeates the place.", "author": "Norm G."}

Service was prompt and I was seated immediately. \n\nI ordered the beef stew/wonton with hor fun and the beef stew was very tender and flavorful. Wonton was also filled with pork and bits of shrimp. My issue was the hor fun and the broth itself. I understand these hk style soup noodles often use the standard broth but something went terribly wrong with this one. It was flavorless. I took the first sip and I thought, no way. Sam Wo has been around for 100 years how could they mess up on the broth?!\n\n2nd sip. Sad face. The hor fun was overcooked and was mushy in the bowl. The broth was probably the most bland thing. If it's a good noodle soup, having a decent broth is crucial! \n\nPerhaps I came on a really off day, but I would recommend getting their porridge instead as that's their stable.", "author": "Sarah I."}

I held it as a fond memory, especially those in which we, the patrons, crossed paths and swords with Edsel Ford Fong. It was a place to be experienced.   I felt sadness that the venerable old joint closed. When the old Anna Bakery closed without any notice, one wondered what would take it's place, if anything.  Happily, Sam Wo has risen like a phoenix and moved into the space.  They salvaged some old signage from the old place and moved into the crisp and clean space.  There is an upstairs (where we ate today) and a sign in sheet down on level one (make sure you sign in or you won't get a table).  21 tables, the place is small, but does not feel too terribly cramped.  They've just opened, so you need to give the staff a break, service is not spotty, they're simply busy and getting the hang of things.  Service was very friendly!\n\nFood, well, #1 for me, the cold rice rolls with bbq pork.   OMG, those are delicious!  OMG the Sam Wo mustard!  Why they have little packets of \"chinese mustard\" on the table is an insult to the little dish of spicy gold they serve with the rice roll.  It has a nice kick, really nice fresh wasabi like kick!\n\nMy companion had the beef stew soup with rice noodles and said it was very good.  I ordered bbq pork and won ton soup.    Mine was delicious.  Mind, they are not huge bowls of soup like you'd see in a pho place.  That being said, we shared the rice roll (which was huge) and were both very satisfied and full upon leaving.  \n\nThere is a huge to-go business for them, which might slow some table orders down.  We waited to have our order taken, but, the food arrived pretty fast.\n\nThe decor has some lovely nostalgic items, like some of the old panels from the old place with the well worn signs.  Lost of photos of people with Edsel Ford Fong, so it's nice they are embracing the history of the place.  Only sadness was the non-use of the dumbwaiter they installed.  The waitstaff carried trays up and down the stairs.  I give them kudos for that and not spilling!\n\nMy lunch companion and I both said we will make a return trip.

We saw Sam Wo's and knew it was the place!  We even encountered some of the rudest service ever!  :)\n\nFlash forward 25 years and I was in San Francisco recently and in the mood for Sam Wo's.  Sadly, a Google search revealed the original restaurant was gone, but like a phoenix, Sam Wo's arose in a new location.\n\nSame great food, but much cleaner and more friendly service now.  Definitely worth a visit!", "author": "Chris P."}

We wanted to eat at a well known Chinese place and this had good name recognition. I have never eaten at the old location and we got a little bit of history from our Lyft driver on the way over. It's your typical small, Chinatown restaurant - no frills. There are only a few tables downstairs and more room upstairs. We were told to go upstairs and found a roomy \"booth.\" The waiter upstairs was super friendly and asked us where we were from, what places we've seen in the city, etc. We had wonton soup (generously sized dumplings), combo fried rice (with BBQ pork), beef with string beans, and chicken chow mein. All were extremely tasty and satisfying. We were offered some hot tea also, which made our experience complete. I recommend this place if you're in town. It does the job of \"I had good Chinese food in Chinatown\" quite well.", "author": "AP C."}

The limited menu options and quality of the dishes left me scratching my head. I felt like we had wandered into a 1950s small-town version of a Chinese restaurant in which the chef had never heard of actual Chinese cuisine (or, for that matter, even Americanized Chinese cuisine). San Francisco is supposed to represent the pinnacle of Chinese cuisine; this place doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. Disappointing and to be avoided.", "author": "Roger K."}

We all shared the BBQ pork rice noodle roll, chow mein with duck, chicken with string beans and Chinese doughnuts. Everything tasted great and they serve tea as you sit down to have your meal. It was enough food to feed four of us with each of us getting a bowl of rice. My only wish was the doughnuts were fresh but we came later in the evening so no worries as they still tasted great.

Yes, the prices went way up, but at least the location is clean (for now) and again, nowhere else sells BBQ pork rice noodle rolls! \n\nBBQ pork rice rolls - $4.95 - 4/5 - I can eat several of these things! Make sure you ask for the homemade mustard - it's much more horseradishy than those packets that most people are used to. One roll has about 8 pieces. \n\nDuck Dry Mixed Noodle - $6.59 - 3.5/5 - These were much more flavorful than I expected and the noodles were homemade. I just didn't really care about the duck. I was expecting roasted duck but it was shredded pieces and lacked some flavor. Next time I think I would be much happier with BBQ pork. \n\nTomato Beef Chow Fun - 3/5 - This wasn't on the menu, but I asked if they would make it since they make the same dish with chow mein. It was very saucy, but a little too much on the sweet side. I liked how it had a lot of tomato flavor though. \n\nThe location is pretty nice for Chinatown but the upstairs can get stuffy if too many people are up there.

This seems to be an authentic Cantonese style restaurant.\n \nI was in a training class and a classmate suggested we go here, as Chinatown was only a block away, we walked of course. She raved about this place, and heard that it had re-opened, and she was VERY excited, so I said sure! When we first walked in I wasn't sure if it was a sit-down restaurant or take-out only.. But they immediately invited us in to sit. It's a small narrow restaurant and didn't look as clean as I would have liked. They took us to the second floor, up steep and crackly wooden steps and my immediate thought was, oh no, where did this girl bring me. (I was worried!) The second floor was actually pleasant, looked cleaner and newly renovated/decorated than the first floor, so I was a bit relieved. Smaller, but much brighter than the first floor. There was a hostess/waiter and water station there as well, which for me, for some reason was comforting to see. \nThe table had small stools as chairs, I have never seen that before, it wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought. I would have liked to hang my purse on the back of a chair, instead of the floor, but I had no choice.  (Floor it is!) :/ \nWe ordered an appetizer, the BBQ pork rice roll, it looked like a sushi roll, it came with a spicy mustard, which tasted similar to wasabi. I wasn't in love with the dish, but my friend insisted on it being the BEST thing in the menu and we had to order it. Meh.. Not a fan! It didn't taste like much, it wasn't bad at all, but it was kinda bland if you ask me.. my friend loved it. I did however see others eating it as well, so it definitely seems to be a favorite amongst guests. My friend ordered the beef chowfun and I ordered chicken with green beans, it came with white rice. (They didn't offer me brown rice, not sure if it was even an option). :( It was lightly saut\u00e9ed with a black bean sauce, I thought the chicken (a generous amount) was mostly the fatty pieces of the chicken with cartilage still on it.. I really had a hard time chewing and I kept spitting out the hard to chew chunks, I know, kinda gross! The flavors were nice, though. \nPrices were great, we walked out paying $23 for the 2 of us, not too shabby and service was good too, they were very nice and responsive, it did take about 15 to receive our food! \nHonestly, my friend ranted about this place, but I really wasn't impressed. It's in a congested area, not so sure how easy parking would be, there is a garage nearby, however. \n\nAlthough, I didn't mind it, but I really wasn't a fan of the food.

The rice rolls were slightly different from usual fare you'd see at dimsum places, but had a good balance of meat and rice noodle. The duck noodles looked pretty average but ended up being our favorite dish of the three. The noodles had a great, springy texture and a perfect amount of seasoning.

I was super bummed about this bc we were in the mood for good Chinese food, but I should've known as soon as I saw the entree list full of Chinese American dishes and nothing authentic, that this was a bad idea. The Chinese donuts came not exactly cold, but unless fried dough is hot, it's crap. It was stale and you could smell the old grease. The only ok dishes were the Pork and Preserved Egg Congee and the chicken wings (nothing special but the only item that wasn't cold when it came out). The rest of our order wasn't even room temperature when it arrived and got increasingly colder as soon as it hit the table. Why go to a restaurant if the food isn't hot!?! I was excited to try the wet egg and shrimp over rice dish I saw pictures of on Yelp...it came out with cold rice and dry egg. I even showed the waiter the picture before ordering and that dry, cold mess was the atrocity we received. What I don't get is how there was a line of people when the food was so below average?!? It's Bc Yelpers do the disservice of lying to other diners. Don't make excuses for this place anymore with a rating above 2 stars. It was an $80 tab and I'm kicking myself for wasting that kind of money; it wasn't worth even $20. Save yourself the time, bc the history of this place doesn't matter if the food is bad. And btw, does it even count as historical when it's at a new location with no old world charm?  It's just another whatever Chinese spot with cheesy ambiance and sticky tables.

I grew up frequenting the original Sam Wos, also known to us as \"the rude waiter restaurant\". My father, a loveable and curmudgeonly fellow, found the Rude Waiter endlessly entertaining, a hilarious alter ego if you will. \n\nI think it must have been fate when my friend and I wandered through the door this weekend, only to discover that this was the reincarnation of the Sam Wo's of my childhood. It's a Formica table, comfort food kind of place. But the quality of the food we had didn't disappoint. And I'm quite the critic when it comes to Chinese dives. \n\nWe only had Peking duck chow fun and string beans, but they were the best chow fun and string beans I'd had in a very, very long time. The duck portions were stingy and not top quality cuts, but the flavor was fantastic. I wouldn't expect more for the price we paid, some eight bucks for a huge platter the two of us couldn't even finish. That is the point of a dive after all. Flavor over expense. True wok hay. Five stars for the new Sam Wos. \n\nThere is no rude waiter of course. The wait staff is in fact wonderfully friendly and helpful. They joked around with us and treated us like old friends.

We had our plates stacked hoping they would get the message but they ignored us. \n\nThe reason i am giving Sam Wo's 1 star is because I am taking a star off for every hair that i found in the food. I thought it was my hair at first but no, there was another one buried in the noodles. The third one was the last straw, and the waiter saw me pulling the long hair out of the food and just made a grossed out face and ignored us after that. \n\nLastly, I they lose another star because the wonton soup was so bland. It was just wontons and soupy water. The wonton's tasted extremely which sometimes may be a sign that it is not fresh. I ate one and stopped because i was worried i would get sick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-30", "description": "Let me start off by saying that I have never eaten here and that I had reservations about this place only because it's been pegged as a tourist joint. We had a lion dance performance last night in Chinatown and we decided to come here after for dinner. Having never been to the old location, I had even bigger reservations to find a place that was brightly lit, newly painted, clean, and orderly. \n\nIf you've lived here long enough and been to enough hole in the walls in Chinatown, you would realize that this is not your typical fare. Great, we're probably going to get ripped off for watered down chinese food. Imagine to my surprise when I sat down and saw that the prices were completely within line for what you would normally pay at similar places. The food itself is pretty decent. It's cantonese style, portions are ok, but what really really impressed me was their service. For a place that busy and that small, they have the friendliest waiters I have ever met in a very long time. While most waiters will treat you fairly when you go to a restaurant, they often forget that they're being observed as well when they are not at your table. How they greet other guests, how they communicate with each other, people are watching all the time. \n\nYou can tell how much a waiter enjoys their job when they come to take your order. They'll either stand there impatiently while you flip flop through your decisions or help you decide in a friendly manner. Or when they bring out a dish and forget a side condiment. All that makes a difference. I would definitely come back just for the experience alone. Drop by for lunch here sometime, you won't regret it.", "author": "Eric L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-12", "description": "We were in San Francisco on June 29th with my son and his family.  I ask them if they wanted seafood or Chinese food.  Our grandkids voted for Chinese.  In that case I wanted to have Chinese food that wouldn't  be so American style.  We parked the van in a garage near Clay street, and as we were getting into the elevator, I ask a local man that was toting a large Chinese carry out bag if he could recommend a good one.  He said with no hesitations \"Sam Wo\"!    So we checked Yelp and saw that it was rated very good.  At first glance it looked like they might not be able to accommodate all eight of us, because it's narrow with kitchen on one side and dining on the other.  It reminds me of the many small restaurants in Manhattan.  Within minutes of inquiring if they could seat us, they had a table on the second floor.  \nWe were greeted  by a wonderful waiter, he was on point all night and interacted with our grandkids very well.\nAfter exploring the menu I found some items I had never seen before.  So I had to try the Fish Jook, and I though it was very good.  My grandkids also tried some food that was off the normal American Chinese menu, and they loved it, Go Kids!  Out the door with two appetizers, drinks and tip for eight was about $80.  Not bad.\nYou know you can find the real deal, if the restaurant has been around over 100 years.\nI'm sure there our other good restaurants in China Town that are as good, but if you don't want to drive around looking for a parking space, then Sam Wo is right across the street from the Public parking garage.\n BTW, you won't find General Tso's Chicken on the menu, because it's an American made up dish.", "author": "Doug B."}

I was leading a group of 12, and we didn't make a reservation (we weren't sure where we were going to eat). I called literally about 2 minutes before and asked if there was anyway to accomodate us, and they said they would make it work. \n\nWe got there, and they had a large table set up for us in a cosy dining room upstairs above. One of our party asked if they could just bring us what they thought was best, and the host, in a lovely jolly christmas sweater said \"not a problem.\"\n\nWe had a great meal of wonton soup, noodles, chicken, beef noodle, tofu and veggies, and it came out in record time. He explained what each dish was, and was diligent about making sure we all had our water glasses filled throughout the meal.\n\nIt was very good American Chinese cuisine, and they put up with us too. The best part, and probably most painful part for them, was spilling the total cost up 12 ways. And even though painful for the staff, the host joked with us about it, and took care of it with ease. \n\nI applaud, and deeply thank the Sam Wo staff for dealing with a big party, surprising us with great food, and a warm and welcoming service.

It was about 9:30pm and the place was hopping. We put our name on the wait list by the wall and waited for about 15mins. It is a small place, like the old Sam Wo but it's only a one story building :-( oh, I so wish Edson, the mean waiter was still working there or just came around to joke with the patrons. \n\nThe food, I must say is still just okay, not the best but it's the nostalgia that people come for. Sam Wo was the place my dad would seldom take us for Beef chow fun back in the 70's. This was a very special time for me since it was our shopping day...just dad and I. The fond memories of dad and I going there just the two of us is very clear in my mind. \n\nTonite, I craved beef stew and Gai Lon over rice. My friends had their rice roll and another had soft scramble eggs with BBQ pork over rice. My dish came and the size is larger than what I expected. But for 10.00, it suffices the price to food ratio. However, my meat was luke warm. I just am a stickler for Luke warm food! And it had so much more tendon than I liked. Most people prefer the tendon but I wan neat!! It didn't have that much taste to me....had much better at Sun Kwong on Jackson/Hyde and $3.00 less. I tasted my friends scrambled egg rice dish and it was bland as well. The highlight are the rice rolls. I could eat two orders of those easily. \n\nBut, I must say, the service is good. They are busy but do come around and make small talk or check on our water situation. The bathroom is a single unisex so the wait can be a challenge but at 10pm, it was clean, not smelly and well stocked of TP. (Rarity in Chinatown) oh, if you have a sever back problem, do not expect a chair with a back to lean on. The stools are from the old Sam Wo and tiny little stools they are! If you are a ladies size 16 and up, be careful...these still are not very sturdy. \n\nAll in all, I will return for the rice roll and maybe the porridge. I think it is still cash only..maybe.

Since there were so many to choose from, we used Yelp to help find a good place. We decided to come here since it had 4 stars. Plus it was late & the majority of the restaurants were closing or closed & this place was open until 3 am. This place is place small. Once seated & reviewed the menu, the waitress took our order & brought our food 20 minutes later. I got the mixed wonton soul, my daughter the beef stew, hubby the chicken fun something , and my son the sweet & sour chicken plus a side of Chinese donuts. Needless to say, we were disappointed. My soup tasted like water with chicken broth flavor. The dumplings were good but not enough BBQ pork or shrimp. There were at least 3 leaves of Bok choy plus I pulled out a piece of plastic from my mouth. I knew the te tire felt weird. I was done. Couldn't eat any more. My daughter's soup had no flavor what's so ever. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried it... nope.. it was bad. My son's sweet & sour chicken tasted like breaded pieces of chicken that were rolled in the sauce, the donuts were bland. The only good plate was my husband's food. That one had great flavor.  Looking at the tv screen waiting for my family to finish eating dinner, I saw this restaurant was featured in Connan O'Brians show ... I'm sorry but the hype for the restaurant from my personal experience & the plastic I pulled out of my mouth was not all it was cracked out to be. Service was great but not the food.

Walking in I was warmly greeted! Only a few small tables in a clean, updated \"old school\" style chinese restaurant. A pot of hot tea promptly showed up which was a nice welcome on the wet evening. \nThe menu was simple, not too complex like many other Americanised places, with a symbol next to their house specials. I ordered the recommended Duck Noodle, and the Sesame Chicken. The duck noodles came first, I liked the noodles, it had a good texture, not too soggy. Several slices of braised duck with a generous heap of shredded lettuce sit atop the noodles in a braise sauce. It was good, for those that are familiar, think street style, simple, good, hot noodles. \nThe sesame chicken was just what it says, just a little less sweet than your regular ones. The steamed rice that it was served with was very comforting. All in good price, comforting food.

I never set foot there before, though my husband used to eat at the old one when he was a kid.  We started with an appetizer, bbq pork rice roll.  It was unlike any roll I've had at a Chinese restaurant--so delicious, not fried, and with a tiny bit of hot mustard on the side.  It was out of this world!  The chicken dry noodles were delicious and simple--noodles, shredded chicken, and strips of lettuce.  Very light, fresh, and did I mention it was \"delicious\"?  The other dishes we tried were the sweet n sour pork, sesame chicken, and broccoli w/oyster sauce (and of course steamed rice).  These were also very good and comparable to what you would find at other solid Chinese restaurants.  But because those first two dishes were spectacular, because the service was outstanding (though there was a small mistake in our order), and because the atmosphere was cheerful on New Year's Eve, Sam Wo gets 5 stars.

Now, if anyone remembers how these were in most dim sum shops in CT, made with glutinous rice flour and sprinkled with pieces of bbq pork, green onions, steamed and rolled up flat like a crepe, you'd remember them being light and not dense, savory and not sweet.  These were definitely not bringing back any happy memories.  These were dense and heavy (the rice roll themself) wrapped around pieces of bbq pork, cilantro, fried egg, like a sushi roll, and was seasoned  sweet/salty, emphasize the sweet!\ni dont know if this is an attempt to be \"fusion, contemporary, or what\" but if this place was supposed to give us the opportunity to experience the ol sam wo, then it's iteration is all wrong.\n\nEven the simplest chow mein Sam Wo used to have, simply seasoned with oyster sauce and green onions was light years better than what i had today.  \n\ni'm sorry it didnt work.  would have liked to have brought up fond memories while eating..", "author": "dee c."}

So guess what my mom says after we have late lunch at the famous Sam Wo? My mom is a huge sucker for wonton soup and she's been to Yin Du and Hon's on Kearny was closed so here we are. The wait was 5 minutes. But there were 3 open tables as me and about 4 other people waited to be called. There is a wait list and as the waitress rattled off another five parties that were absent, it was clear that the place was understaffed. Another 5 minutes until we were waited on but afterwards the food came FAST. \n\nWe decided on wonton soup with beef stew and a shrimp chow mein. The wontons were only pork with little crunchy bits of what I can assume are turnip or lettuce interspersed. There were 9 total. The broth was uninspiring and gave us forewarning as to how the beef would taste. It was colored very red from the bean curd it's traditionally cooked with but there was no indication of any flavor. Slippery and slightly tough, and neither salty nor savory, and also no turnips. Indeed, Mom was right. \n\nThe chow mein though, wow. I normally scoff at ordering chow mein but the flavor was amazing. Now here is the salt and umami and sweetness the other dish is lacking. Garlicky, oniony, green oniony. It's also a very generous portion. That was the star. There, I could see why the name Sam Wo shines.", "author": "Rachel H."}

We ordered the tomato beef noodles, the dry duck noodles which came with a side of light soup,   the fish porridge,  mo po tofu with rice,  bbq  pork rice roll,  Chinese broccoli , and Chinese donut.  Food arrived within 5 to 8 minutes.  Quite fast.  Tea was refilled.  This is my 3rd trip to this restaurant.  Good service and yummy no nonsense food.", "author": "E. C."}

This statement applies to the new location of Sam Wo. I went there often in the 1950's when Edsel was at the top of his game. I went after church, after bar-hopping and for nice warm jook.  I finally had the opportunity to visit on Monday the 2nd. I liked that they kept similar tables and stools. I ordered the bbq pork chow mein and pork/preserved egg jook with an order of fried doughnut. The chow mein was mediocre, more like lo mein. On the wet side, not fried crispy. Back in the day, the cooks made their chow mein with a very unique flavor that I could get ONLY at Sam Wo. The jook was also OK and you could get this anywhere. The fried  'ghost' was good. I will not return.", "author": "Gerry P."}

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by a friendly server behind the counter.  Although this is an eat-in restaurant which is very quaint I was placing an order to go.  The server recommended a few dishes and I figured I would order a few things to eat for dinner as well.  Since patience is not a virtue of mine I began to try the egg roll on my way back to the office...they were perfectly fried, crunchy not creasy...delicious.  I then tried their signature BBQ Pork Rice Noodles and let's just say that they did not make it back to office and it was only a few blocks away.  Although I was relatively full I did want to try the duck fried rice and it truly did not disappoint, YUM!", "author": "Anna P."}

Things has gotten a bit more pricey than before but it is still cheap compared to other places in the city. You can only get B.B.Q pork noodle roll at Sam Wo ... nowhere else.  Another dish that I really like is Dry Duck Mixed noodle... Delicious!!  The owner's daughter, Julie, has exceptional great services.  Sam Wo opens till 12am so it is a great place to hang out.", "author": "Evelyn W."}

Beat service i have ever had in Chinatown.  Really liked how much cleaner the new restaurant is. Great lighting too compared to the old spot.", "author": "S L."}

I got Chow Main with Tomato and Beef and it turned out to be very sweet. It is full of tomato paste. Tastes like SpagettiOs from the can. There is very little beef and what is there is very chewy. It does not look at all as pictured on there website. Will not go there again!", "author": "Nozima T."}

I heard they closed and recently they reopened after renovations (not sure when that happened...). It's so tasty. The chow mein was perfection and wonton soup was delicious. The prices are still totally affordable. Such a good meal!!!", "author": "Rachel N."}

After they moved to their new location on Clay Street we noticed that they no longer use the same chow mein noodles & seem to have also changed the recipe & possibly a new cook. Very disappointing and unfortunately I'm no longer a regular customer.", "author": "Marcia G."}

Something that is hard to find in Chinatown. The food was great as well. Don't miss out on their famous steamed pork rolls as appetizer! The place is small but an authentic shop and super cozy.", "author": "Srinath A."}

My first time at the new location. Excellent. This is the food you will get at your friends' grandma's house. Simple and good. Old-school Chinese-American food, Cantonese cuisine. No pan-Asian fuss. Howard was running the joint with wit, skill and kindness. Thank you for a great meal in a great city.", "author": "Old N."}

The chow mein was simple, yet very rich in flavor and non greasy whatsoever. The Hong Kong Tea was my favorite however. It's their own blend of teas and carnation milk. The staff were super friendly and very attentive. Will definitely be coming back when I return to San Francisco.", "author": "Marcos H."}

The waiters and waitresses are friendly but a bit disorganized. Our order was wrong, waited a while to get the correct one,  then the white rice came when we finished eating! The dishes were definitely not traditonal Chinese. Portion sizes were small, favor and style of cooking were mismatched with the publicity and rating. Noodle was overcooked ramen, not the tradional fine noodle. What a disappointment!", "author": "lucia j."}
