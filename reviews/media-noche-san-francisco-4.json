This place is pretty aesthetic and quite a small place, so I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a seat but we came a bit late - around 1pm so we were easily able to find seats. \n\nI ordered the Chef's Cubano which is a monthly special where some of the proceeds go to a charity. This month's sandwich was an asian-fusion inspired cuban sandwich with crispy pork belly, coleslaw, asian vinaigrette and more. This sandwich was super bomb and everybody who tried it loved it.\n\nThe other things on the menu were kind of mediocre. My friend had the pollo bowl and they said the chicken was kind of dry and wasn't the best. The El Cubano, which is the standard cuban sandwich is definitely better than other cuban sandwiches I've tried but doesn't blow my mind, but it's a decent sandwich if you're craving it.\n\nAll in all, I gave 4 stars because of the excellent Chef's Cubano and I'd definitely come back to try the El Cubano and some of the other menu items because they seem pretty promising.", "author": "Christopher L."}

The Gloria sandwich came on pressed Cuban bread with two slices of crispy deep-fried eggplant, a delicious coconut slaw, creamy avocado, and a wonderfully herbal green sauce. We also had the Chef's Cubano, which on my visit was Preeti Mistry's Indian-inspired \"Vindalated Cubano\" sandwich with juicy vindaloo pork, curry leaf mustard, melted Swiss, and apple fennel turmeric slaw. The flavor fest of spices, the crunch from the slaw, and the tenderness of the pork on the crispy toasted bread was the perfect combination, and such an interesting take on the traditional Cubano!

Order at the counter and food is brought to you. Some outdoor seating and all seating inside is communal or counter. \n\nWe almost went to Souvla but saw this place on the way. It's VERY similar to Souvla in terms of aesthetic (even down to the bowls) and theme (sandwiches and salads). It's sort of like a Cuban Souvla. \n\nWe got empanadas, plantain chips, ceviche and a salad with pork. Everything was a few dollars too expensive tbh. I thought everything was delicious-ceviche has a nice kick to it and the salad was flavorful. Pork in the salad was slow cooked and tender. The size of the large salad is *huge* and I got two meals out of it.\n\nGood option when in the area for a quick bite but this is definitely the *new* (aka gentrifying) Mission. Lots of cheap local food abounds in the area at taquerias and pappuserias. As with all businesses in the rapidly changing Mission, I hope they train and hire black and brown people and have them in the front of the house/at the register as well as cooking in the back or cleaning.

The mimosa was amazing and really nice to sip on casually while chatting, although it didn't necessarily go that well with the sandwich. The pork in my sandwich was a bit too dry and too salty to me, although the condiments complimented the overall sandwich pretty well. Media Noche was a bit underwhelming for me, as I was expecting a more Latin America flavor to the sandwich and was a bit disappointed that it was more American in taste. Portion size was perfect to finish in one sitting and was standard for the city's price and definitely not too expensive for a casual dinner.

The price for what it is - especially their Cubano Sandwiches and bowls - is pretty outrageous. \n\nI got a Ropa Vieja bowl (pretty small portion) with added avocado ($19) and a drink and this came up to about $26.

The ham to pulled pork ratio was totally slanted in favor of the pulled pork.

I understand that the sandwich is like a panini of sorts (in terms of how the bread is pressed), but I've had other Cubano sandwiches (in Miami) where the pork is busting from the seams!! \n\nThen again SF is not Miami and I may be a bit rough here. Overall, great place-- check em out. Also, I heard the ceviche was good..", "author": "Vasiliy M."}

Based on what I had- 5 stars. \n\nThe counter service could have been friendlier and a tad less snarky. There were like 8 people in line from 2 different directions and no sign indicating where it starts/ends so people just kept lining up in different areas, there were legit tributaries forming and it got a little tense and awkward and I think some basic signage would help avoid that and make people feel a little more comfortable with their full experience at Media Noche.  \n\nOverall really enjoyed it and will definitely be back and will keep my fingers crossed for a slow day so as to avoid any line confusion/altercations.", "author": "Candice G."}

I order via Caviar the ropa vieja, which I've had before here as I was craving Cuban food. \n\nI can't believe they charged me $3.50 for 3 small, thinly sliced pieces of avocado that didn't even add up to 1/4 of a small avocado.  To make matters worse, they are added the avocado to a coconut slaw and not to the main course I ordered. Avocados are expensive but not to the point of charging this much. \n\nI won't go deep into the fact that the ropa vieja had very little sauce and was essentially dry pieces of beef on rice. \n\nI tried calling about the avocados, but shocker, no one is there to answer.  \n\nBest believe I will go to Cuba before eating at this establishment.

We decided to try: \n\n1. Lechon Asado: This was absolutely delicious. From the pictures, the portions looks kind of small because of the huge bowl but it's actually A LOT of food. They give an extremely generous amount of pork. The meat was perfectly seasoned and fell apart beautifully. I also really loved the black beans and rice. I highly recommend this dish. \n\n2. Ceviche: Good amount of calamari, octopus and shrimp. I've never had it with calamari before but it went really well with the plantains. My favorite pieces were the shrimp however because that's what I'm used to when eating ceviche. \n\n3. Verde Salad: I tried a piece and it was pretty good. The large is huge. You could probably share it between two people. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, I really like the feel of the place. It makes me feel as if I was in a small Cuban restaurant ordering home made food by someones mother. The place is pretty clean and they have indoor and outdoor seating. I'll definitely have to try the empanadas and El Cubano Sandwich next time. The only down side was that it was a really hot day so inside of the restaurant was super hot.

Aye...\n\nThe restaurant industry is so volatile in San Francisco that you never know if it's going to be the next hot spot with 2 hour waits (or a dud that closes in 6 months) so I like to visit new businesses when they first open. \n\nAlways wanted to visit Radish for their shrimp corn dogs but they closed before I could visit (see, what I mean!) and has recently been replaced with Media Noche, a fast-casual eatery serving Cuban inspired food. \n\nOn the menu are Cubanos ($11.50-$12.50), Salads ($6-$15), Rice Bowls ($11 - $16.50), Snacks ($5-$10): ceviche, croquetas, empanadas, and Ice Cream Bars ($5). Wine and beer only. Cc's accepted. \n\nTo start, I ordered the Piccadillo Empanadas: Spiced ground beef, famous green sauce ($9): http://bit.ly/2mzxCsE. The empanadas were the perfect pockets of fried savory delicousness. Beautifully crisp exterior filled with a flavorful ground beef mixture: http://bit.ly/2nPYWDn. The accompanying chimichurri sauce added good acidity and herbacousness. They also have a bottle of Salsa Picante on every table that was BOMB - wonderfully tangy with good heat. I made sure to ask for a tiny container of it so I can dunk my leftover empanada in later. \n\nI also ordered the Verde Salad: Cabbage, young kale, avocado, manchego, spiced pepitas, mojo vinaigrette (Large - $10 + $5 lechon): http://bit.ly/2nPNIhZ. I would not recommend it, nor would I order it again. The lechon was tender but was missing that rich, lush mouthfeel. I know it's a verde (green) salad but it could have benefited from another veggie like sliced radishes, tomatoes, or red onion for varying texture and a pop of color. The vinaigrette had lots of acidity so it would have been nice to have more buttery avocado for balance. \n\nI came for an early lunch so service was prompt and I received my food in less than 8 minutes. \n\nLoved, loved the festive space! There's a beautiful flamingo mural outside and as you walk in, you're greeted with pretty floor tiles, lots of teal, greenery, and destressed tables for that fun, beachy and rustic vibe. The bright banana wallpaper in the restroom was super cute and seems to be selfie worthy. Tables are communal and there's counter seating. I heard that outdoor seating is in the works. \n\nParking...it's the Mission so good luck but make it worthwhile...Boba Guys is just a couple of doors up and Garden Creamery is just one block over. \n\nHighly recommend the empanadas but skip the salad and go for one of their cubanos which looked huge. And, slather that salsa picante on e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g...no judgement because next time (when they have yucca frita), I plan to wear that sauce!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And because it was in the middle of the week and the day, it was pretty empty so service was spot on/friendly and we had a nice quiet lunch overlooking the street action. \n\nWe got the Celia and the El Cubano, both were freshly made and very tasty! It didn't look at all what I was expecting. Then again, I only ate one Cuban sandwich before here and that one was a massive, saucy, spicy beast!

When we were in the Mission this Sunday I had to give it a go.  \nWe came in after picking up our usual loaf of bread from Tartine.  Stark difference from the line we always encounter there to Media Noche which only had one couple inside.  I ignored this choosing instead to blame it on timing; way late for lunch & too early for dinner.  Normally I would walk the other way when there is no one in, a sure red flag for me.  \nThe decor is cute and minimal.  Pretty tiled floor, communal tables, hanging plants.  There's self serve water next near the cashier and food is served in an enamelware plates that reminds me of camping dishes.   \nThe menu is not extensive which is sometimes a good thing: sandwiches, bowls, salads, and snacks.  Drink selections: wine, beer, sangria & mimosas along with cold Cuban coffee and cafe con leche.  \nWe ordered Picadillo Empanada ($9) Mariquitas ($5.5) Croquetas de M.N.($9) and El Cubano ($12.50).\nCoquetas were on the small side.  It comes with what they describe as aioli but it reminds me more of tartar sauce because of the pickle relish.  I would have rather have a couple big ones than a few quarter sized ones for $9.  Not worth getting and taste is meh.\nMariquitas came in a bowl with their famous green sauce which I think was the best thing they had.  Thicker slices than what I'm used to and not seasoned enough. This may be worth the $5.50 but not with the hair we found at the bottom of the bowl.  Took off one star for this one. A definite not coming back here again mistake.\nYou get two empanadas for $9 but they are also on the small side.  Its filled with spiced ground beef and served again with their famous green sauce.  It has a nice pastry dough which is generously sprinkled with salt crystals.  Crispy and meaty but also not worth the price.\nEl Cubano wasn't what I expected.  The pork shoulder was too mushy and the smoked ham didn't help.  Again for $12.50 its not worth it even for SF standards.    \nOverall not worth it.  I've had Cuban food for far less and taste much better like Portos in LA. I don't mind paying more for food because of overhead cost such as being in SF but at least be good.

(I was dining with a friend that was vegetarian so I need to come back)\n\nWe shared a few things:\n\nQueso & Black Bean Empanadas ($8.50) - Come with their famous green sauce, the dough is a bit on the thicker side and it's deep fried so it's crispy on the outside. Definitely not healthy for you, but it's good with the green sauce. I'd get these again. \n\nMariquitas ($5.50) - Plantain chips with green sauce - these were pretty standard plantains, you can probably buy something similar at Trader Joe's or down the street at the Mexican corner store, but it pairs well with the green sauce, so it's a nice snack for 2-4 people to share. \n\nGloria Cubano ($12.50) - Crispy eggplant, coconut slaw, avocado, green sauce. This was good and a nice vegetarian option but it wouldn't be a sandwich I'd order over and over again. The eggplant is deep fried and pairs well with the coconut and the green sauce on anything is good, but overall was just okay. Next time I'll try one win pork. Decent for a vegetarian option but not amazing.\n\nOverall, it's a decent place for Cuban food and one of the few in SF. The place is decorated nicely, slightly above average prices for the type of food, and the food is pretty good but not very authentic (not that I've been to Cuba but I've had a lot of Cuban food in Miami).

Most of seating is communal, although they have bar seating along the windows (great for people watching). \n\nTheir menu is on the smaller side but everything is incredibly well-crafted. I ordered the queso & black bean empanadas, the ceviche, and the El Cubano sandwich. The empanada was really good but definitely needed the kick from the green sauce. Their ceviche was probably some of the best I've ever had. The amount of seafood and plantain chips was very generous and the juice was so good I actually drank it with a spoon (no shame). The cubano was perfectly balanced - you could taste each ingredient and nothing was overpowering. \n\nThey also have a good selection of beverages. We ordered a few different beers, but I definitely want to come back for their sangria.

The first half was perfectly fine, and actually quite good, but when I got towards the second half of the sandwich, I noticed that the chicken was starting to grind on my teeth, kinda like when you've cooked about 80% of chicken at home, and slice it open to make sure it's cooked, only to find out it's not quite done yet. That was not a pleasant surprise. I'm not going to complain much about it though, or bring down their review, since it is a new restaurant, and the first half of the sandwich was good. And, I didn't get sick after lol. Overall the sandwiches were super delicious, but also small for $12.50. I would return for the El Cubano sandwich without a doubt though!\n\nThe service was extremely slow - it took us about 25 mins to get our food (it was a Saturday around 12:15pm). I mean, they are new and all, so I'll give them some slack. When we asked to follow up with our food and where it was, they were apologetic and gave us the fried plantains side on the house! Sweet. Anyway, it seems like they need more help overall. The cashier is also doubling as the busboy and bartender. I mean the drinks aren't much to put together (sangria, beers), but adding on top of bussing tables and cashiering is a lot. \n\nI wish I had ordered the sangria - it looked super refreshing. \n\nAmbiance is very cute - love the bright colors, that make you feel like you are in Cuba! But the restaurant is pretty tiny, and there are only a few tables, along with bar seating cramped up against the walls. It was a very uncomfortable experience sitting in bar stools, turned the opposite direction looking for our food, with small clearance between stools and the tables next to us, and people going in and out. Just a little tight on the real estate! Plus all the customers who don't have a table yet are just staring all customers down scoping out for a table. Happy saturday lol. \n\nWill return - would recommend too, but wait a few months so they can get their groove together.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

First thing I noticed walking up to Media Noche were the aesthetics. A giant flamingo painting is on their wall outside. And when you come in, you are greeted by so many bright colors! White, teal, and light pink stood out the most. The interior is beautiful and I think the best way to describe the vibe is tropical vintage. It made the experience feel more authentic. Everyone was taking photos  inside and outside in front of the flamingo wall.\n\nAnd the food!!! Everything tasted SO FRESH and that is what will keep us coming back. We ordered:\n- El Cubano: Roasted mojo pork shoulder, smoked ham, swiss, house pickles, mustard. Such simple ingredients but wow it was delicious! The bread was also toasted to perfection and gave that perfect crunch.\n- Ropa Vieja: This bowl was big and included slow braised brisket, peppers, onions, black beans, rice, & coconut slaw. The combination of flavors blended very well together. If you like spice, take the green hot sauce that's on the tables and pour some over. This dish was savory and rich and was very flavorful!\n- Picadillo Empanadas: Spiced ground beef, famous green sauce. These were probably my my favorite. I love empanadas and the spiced ground beef was seasoned so well that it will make your mouth water when you take a bite. The famous green sauce for dipping was also fresh and had a touch of sweetness. Empanadas didn't have too much dough either which is also a plus. \n\nService was wonderful. Staff was happy and friendly and our food came out so quick. I still can't get over how much I love the bright, beautiful interior of the place. Oh and the bathroom has metalic banana wallpaper all over! Very fun and creative. If you like Cuban food, you will love Media Noche!", "author": "Chisholm T."}

The bowl was delicious! The chicken had a lot of flavor and I was a big fan of the inclusion of a coconut slaw. \nSimilar to some of the other reviewers, my biggest complaint has to do with the price. The portions weren't huge, but I guess that's just usually the standard for SF dining. \nThe most irritating thing was the \"carafe of sangria\". No. A half carafe of chilled white wine and a cup on the side with a few chunks of pineapple in it does not count as sangria. I forked over $26 bucks for that, which was extremely annoying.\nIn the end, the food was delicious and I hope to stop back in to try some more options from the menu...I just won't be ordering their \"sangria\" any time soon.", "author": "Nicole N."}

I had Media Noche bookmarked and was looking forward to eating there. We specifically picked an earlier dinner time (we arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening) to avoid the line and table waiting that many post about. We did indeed arrive at the optimum time, by 6:30, when we were leaving, there was a line out the door.  I love Cuban food and have had wide range over the years. This in not strictly \"traditional\" cuban, like you might find in other parts of the country, but a fresh, contemporary take on cuban flavors. So that's what you should expect. What we ate:\n      Roja Salad, roasted root veg (beets) quinoa, baby kale, in a yummy cumin dressing. it was outstanding and the small size is not all that small. could really be a meal if you add some meat. Don't miss this!\n      Empanadas and of course we couldn't decide between the bean and Picadillo, so luckily they told us we could order one of each! Yay. Both were amazing, delicious,crispy shell and the picadillo was a standout, all the right flavors in there. At the risk of being redundant, the green sauce is life changing. Green sauce on everything and especially great with the mariquitas. Somehow the mariquitas seem healthier than tortilla chips? I know I'm fooling myself. \n\nBUT wait there's more, even though we're getting full! (i'm gonna say it now, we over ordered)\n\n      Mojo Chicken bowl, with rice, black beans, white meat chicken in mojo sauce and crispy coconut slaw, that was visually very pretty, lots of different veg and colors. All the components separately were delicious,mixed together amazing. My one suggestion would be more dressing on the slaw. I got the full flavor in some bites and wanted more. Again we had tortured ourselves at the order counter over which bowl to get (the mojo or rope vieja) and one of the owners (who had overheard our struggle)brought us a sample of the Ropa as we were eating. It was also unbelievably good a definite must have. \n     Classic Cubano, roasted pork, ham, melty cheese, pickle and mustard, a perfect umami for me.  I would say maybe a little more butter on the bread, but then again, I hardly need it.\n     Drinks, Sangria and a midnight mimosa ( made with their homemade aqua fresca). The sangria, considering it was a white sangria(not my fave) was outstanding. Not too sweet with boozy pineapple. Just order the carafe and be done with it! \n\nWe were SO stuffed and the portions are really quite substantial, some reviewers say small,I don't understand it. We ended up taking home almost all of the Cubano (which I am eating whilst writing) and half of the Mojo bowl. Green sauce to go, thank you.There were 2 of us and we could have easily fed 4 on what we ordered. for about 80$ exclusive of tip. I'm not sure how many places you could do that in this city considering the quality of the food? Again, I don't understand the folks complaining about the price. I'm certainly not going to make it at home so......\n\nOf course the restaurant space is so unique. The antique lanterns are gorgeous and the tiles are thoughtfully designed and executed. It's not a formal space and has a nice community feel to it. Completely the opposite of so many restaurants in SF that tend to look like they come from the same mold. Media Noche definitely breaks that mold. Happy customers, we'll be back!", "author": "Ann K."}

You order at the register and then they bring you your food. My dad and I shared the ceviche and the eggplant sandwich. I absolutely loved the ceviche! What's unique is that they come with plantain chips. The ceviche is super fresh and has a good spicy kick. Kinda wish they gave just a tad bit more. The sandwich was just okay. I feel like eggplant tends to get lost because it's texture blends in with the bread. Also it was pretty expensive for a vegetarian sandwich and it's not like it comes with any sides. I really wanted the guava cheesecake dessert but they had none at the time. Matthew, the server, was kind enough to compensate for this by offering my dad and I a taste of their other dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-08", "description": "They have a nice start with the interior, though its not very Cuban feeling. I mean sort of with the tile but not quite. They could certainly liven it up a tad more with some paintings and music. Its hard to feel your in Cuba without some paintings or photos of old cars somewhere. I know the new thing is to be bland, but you can make something work to make it seem more like Cuba. Creativity is not just for the bathroom. As it is now, it is more leaning towards a cappuccino spot. A bit more effort in to making the place feel more like a cultural escape would do the place well, IMO. How about a giant pink flamingo extending past an entire wall? Or a giant 50s car? Anything Cuban really. White tile. Meh. \n\nThe food: It seems like the food would be the sort you would get at a very good street corner spot in Cuba. One of those great find dive spots. Except Media Noche is bringing you this food to San Francisco in a very posh setting. Its obvious the chefs here know what they are doing. All said, I can't say that I am aware of Cuba being known for its food. All in all, its not really about the food, which don't get me wrong is not bad, and more about experiencing a culture. The food, IMO is just nothing to write home about. ...mustard and pickles is a good combo, no one can argue... However I do feel more cultured as I leave Media Noche, knowing what they eat in Cuba. ...great people...\n\nPrices may seem expensive but its the norm these days to spend $12-14 on a sandwich. \n\nOverall, I like this spot; food is good enough-as good as Cuban food can be, the atmosphere is great, and the people working there are very friendly. I do find it a bit strange getting a nice plate with a sandwich in such a nice setting. It makes me miss the old mission district a bit more. That said, I will definitely be coming back, mainly for the friendly people and good vibe.\n\nAdvice: don't give up on the interior yet. Your 65% of the way there.

Well in the case of Media Noche, it is something special indeed.  So a long review is what they get!  In town visiting and checking out the mission district we came across this new place and were intrigued.  Was here on what I think was their first day being open.  So of course this could have been a disaster as I have been to places open a month that still don't have their shit together.   The folks running this place know their business and it shows in both look and taste.\n\nGreat feeling to the space.  I've never been to Cuba, but seen pictures and this certainly has the feel of that part of the world.  Simple, clean, bright colors.  Cool tiled floor and vibe and of course a playlist heavy on some great latin sounds, which is a nice change of pace.\n\nOrder at the counter from a small but potent menu.  They bring you the food.  Nothing fancy but it works and is fast.  Mostly counter seating in the place and I think 3 or 4 tables which I guess are communal in style but not that big. \n\nSo of course, had to try the cubano.  I've had many and this is one of the best I've had.  Kind of the deli sandwich of Cuba.  But with a very tasty house roasted pork and home made pickles on a perfect light french roll,  this baby toasted up in the \"press\" just the way it should.  Cheese was melty and the flavors were right where I like them.   Tried the Ceviche.  I am not normally a fan of this but wife is,  and she loved it and I ate it too.  Which says a lot.  It was very fresh tasting with a different kind of marinade on the fish.  Side order of fried plantains were perfect in thickness and crunch.  Killer green salsa that I don't know what was in it but it sure was very tasty.  Not spicy and a different kind of flavor, not your typical salsa.  You could put this stuff on a LOT of things and it complements the dish,  not overpowers it. \n\nPicadillo empanada and veggie empanadas were also standouts.  Perfect fry on the dough so not greasy but great flavor.  And the piccadillo is something they should serve in other items as it is like the best comfort food around!  Sweet raisins and salty green olives in the beef give you that very savory taste bud happiness.  The sloppy joe of cuba! The veggie one had seasoned cuban black beans and cheese and was really good.   Side of cuban slaw was also a winner with the unusual addition of some shaved coconut.  Fresh flavors, vinegar based it was great with the cubano.\n\nThen of course came the dessert.  Never thought they would have something so good but they said they make their own ice cream and make what they call moon sandwiches. Had the guava one,  dipped in a crunchy sweet dark chocolate, these were a perfect end to the meal.  \n\nWe wanted to try more food but needed to save room for dinner that was in a few hours.   If the other items are as good as what we ate,  I could only wish I lived in San Franciso as I would be a regular at this place. I'll be back on my next visit for sure...\n\nRicky Ricardo would be proud and singing and dancing!", "author": "Bruce M."}

In addition, we shared the El Cubano and the Cecilia between us. The standout was definitely the El Cubano that had the right mixture of everything in between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread.

No one needs to be told that being hungry between the hours of 2:30 and 5:30 is not allowed!  We wandered in here around 4:30 for a lunch/dinner meal.  We split a tiny carafe of the wild hawk sangria, white wine, pineapple, lemon and mint.  Pretty good, but I make better sangria.  We did end up drinking two of them, so...there is that.  We also split the beef empanadas, a small kale salad and the media noche.  Beef empanadas were delicious, if a bit pricey for two small ones at $9.  They are fried not baked, which I don't usually prefer, but the picadillo filling inside is fantastic.  Juicy, deeply savory.  The salad was also good, with pumpkin seeds and Parmesan.  The media noche was the weakest thing on our order.  It was really small, and the cheese was not melted and caramelized on the edges, just sort of limply heated through.  I associate a reckless abundance of pork and melty caramelized cheese with this sort of sandwich, and this one was sedate and not terribly generous.  It wasn't bad though, and I would go back and try the other things and see.  The place is really attractively painted, and has counter service.  The seating is a bit awkward, mostly stools and shared tables, but a good place to come for a quick bite in between events.  Our friends met us there and one of them got the eggplant sandwich which was juicer than our media noche.  Our meal was $55, for sangria, a split appetizer, salad and small sandwich.

One of the most hipster oriented restaurants that I've seen in San Francisco.\n\nYes, Cuba is in fashion therefore \"Cuban food\" is the new thing. While the names of some of the plates are in line with the names of original Cuban dishes, unfortunately some of the preparation are not.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients are excellent, unfortunately it's not Cuban food in preparation. For example the bread that is being used for the sandwiches is not even close to what Cuban bread is. And without real Cuban bread for sandwiches, they tasted like bakery sweet bread. The preparation of the black beans were way off in flavor and seasoning as they would've been prepared in any good and simple Cuban kitchen. Also missing are \"Maduros\"! How can serve Ropa Vieja without maduros!! It's unforgivable.\n\nThe closest thing to Cuban food in the peninsula is \"Cuban kitchen\" try it out and notice the difference in the preparation and ingredients used.", "author": "Lacio S."}

We've eating a fair number of cubanos from different restaurants.\n\nMedia Noche's signature cubano arrived pressed like a panini, with the brioche bread quite blackened and bitter on one side, having a strong scorched-sugar taste - the flavor you get when you burn a pot of caramel on the stove. It was not pleasant and pretty disappointing. I should have sent it back to the kitchen, but since it arrived served with the black side up, both the cook and the server had seen it, so I stupidly figured this was the way it was supposed to be.\n\nMy wife thought the agua fresca tasted like sweetened guava nectar from a can with lime juice added. The empanada was hearty, with a spiced ground beef filling that was more or less a chili flavor. The green sauce it came with was tasty.\n\nWe will not be back.", "author": "Deane G."}

And not to be picky, but the cheese wasn't right. It was a bit too creamy. It needs that bit of tang of swiss cheese.

It's not terrible or inedible or anything like that, just a touch disappointing. I think they need to marinate the pork more and perhaps go with a higher ham-to-roast pork ratio to mitigate the mushiness.\n\nThe Lechon Asado bowl is a better deal at $16.50 and if you're going for dinner, it's a pretty good meal. It tastes fresh and healthy and the portion size is good. \n\nThe place looks great.
