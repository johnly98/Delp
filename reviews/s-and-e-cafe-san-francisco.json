This is about S&E Cafe, the day I ate there since the bus wasn't coming. It was very good.\n\nAt first glance of the menu, I could only eat toast and drink milk tea since I'm vegetarian. Luckily I met two Hong Kong people; one shares tables like in Hong Kong. They asked in Chinese for the freshest vegetable, which was bok choy. Later they advised me to order the egg noodles with soy sauce. They also suggested the dry curry with rice noodles, but it was too late to change my order. Next time! \n\nThe bok choy tasted fresh from the market and was flavorful, with a nice balance of garlic. The egg noodles dish was an enormous portion (plenty to take home) and also delicious. The Hong Kong milk tea was very good, and the server was so nice to give me a cup to go on the house. Merry Christmas! It tasted like the milk tea in Hong Kong. \n\nI will return to try the curried rice noodles, and suggest you stop by when you're in the area, or just waiting for the bus.", "author": "Carol W."}

They cleaned up the place and everything looks very nice from what I last remember. Maybe it is a fresh coat of paint? \n\nHong Kong cafes are in my \"comfort food\" zone. My favorite is generally the baked pork chop or chicken over spaghetti. They generally make really good scrambled egg over noodles or rice dishes. The last two visits, the scrambled egg \"gravy\" dishes were tasty. My last visit I had the minced beef with raw egg, which was not bad. I was craving protein so I ordered this dish but the rice was slightly under cooked and the sauce slightly on the bland side. The raw egg was hiding snuggled in the rice under the blanket of hot minced meat sauce. Not a bad choice on a regular day I imagine. \n\nThe servers were busy and running around in haste, but they usually respond to your requests unlike some restaurants where they ignore you usually because of being short staffed or what not.

As for the pork, it had a grainy quality to it as I chewed.\n\nThe house special curry beef had a decent back of the throat kick and the meat was tender. I enjoyed the consistency but will admit it's not like most Chinese curries that I have tried. My sister in law actually had to send a dish back because the sauce, cream based, tasted sour.

However, I can't say I was super satisfied with what I got. I ordered the minced pork rice with a raw egg because in the photo there was a pretty raw egg in the middle (and I LOVE eggs). When I received the dish, I didn't see any egg. Only after mixing it all up did I realize the egg was stuffed at the bottom but now I lost it because I already mixed up my dish. Also, the dish was incredibly salty. I will have to say they give big portions so its worth the money especially since everything in the city is so darn expensive. We also ordered the fish balls, which were pretty decent. I got a shrimp and egg fried rice to go. It was pretty good except there was way more rice than actual shrimp, egg, and seafood. They give you honey lemon tea for starters and taro soup for dessert. Overall, the food was mediocre, but if you're in the mood for cheap large portions of Asain food then I would say come here.", "author": "Alice Y."}

It was busy but there were still some open tables so we were promptly seated.\n\nAs many Yelper's have mentioned S&E Caf\u00e9 IS a step up from D&A Caf\u00e9 (my fav HK cafe) and ABC. Everything is pretty clean including the bathrooms so you don't have to worry about being in contact with yucky germs like the bathrooms of the aforementioned HK cafes.\n\nF O O D:\n*FRIED CHICKEN WINGS (midsections): OK.\n\nWINGS ARE MY ADDICTION so much so that I've had to designate a DWS (Designated Wing Stopper) on the weekends just so I can keep my paws off of them when I'm drunk. It wasn't the weekend and there was no DSW, so of course I had to take advantage of this opportunity. :X\n\nThe 6 moderately sized wings are fried w/o batter so it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it. The meat was tender but not moist and lacked seasoning. It was accompanied by bottled thai chili sauce which added some sweetness, tang, and spiciness but was too syrupy. \n\nIf you like Chicken Wings, definitely pay a visit to D&A for their Ginormous Salt & Pepper Wings, they're BOMB!\n\n*HK BAKED PORK CHOP w/ Rice (comes with soup and dinner roll):\n-Veggie Soup: EHHH, the soup tasted like it was made from bouillon and then watered down b/c it was bland and you can see a ring of orange color on the edges of the bowl. The only veggies were soggy onions and parsley.\n\n-Dinner Roll: GOOD! The dinner roll is similar to a Pan de Sal that's lightly brushed with butter on top for that shiny brown sheen color. The rolls come out warm out of the oven and is pillowy soft, delicate and very fluffy. \n\n-HK Baked Pork Chop w/ Rice: MEH!\n\nIt took about 20 minutes for my order to come and when it did, I swear my pork chop tasted like chicken. I even had my friends taste it and they thought it was chicken also. I asked the waitress and she was convinced it was pork and even had the chef come out to confirm it. I was buzzed NOT drunk but ummm, ok...\n\nThe \"pork\" had a very soft texture and was slathered with a runny tomato sauce which tasted like watered down ketchup; very bland and lacked a savory sweet tang. It was lightly topped with cheese, but not enough to flavor the dish. It was very unappetizing to say the least. Normally when I'm buzzed, I can polish off my food with no problem; this time I could only stomach myself to eat half of my order.\n\nS E RV I C E:\nAlthough the food took some time to come out, our waitress was very friendly and nice. Unlike some other HK Cafes, it was easy to get the attention of the wait staff when we wanted something and they did it w/o us having to ask multiple times or getting an attitude. \n\n2 Stars for the food and 1 Star for the friendly customer service which is a rarity in Asian restaurants. \n\nThe search continues for MOUTH-WATERING drunk eats...\n\nP.S. - CC's Accepted", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Every once in awhile I get a hankering for their delicious crispy chicken wings and a sandwich but every time I break down and order delivery I am left a bit disappointed with how I am treated as a customer. I have ordered delivery from them about 10 times and this is what I have noticed:\n\nFirst, if you don't like mayonnaise (or are allergic!) don't get any of the sandwiches. They will not listen if you request no mayonnaise. One time we put \"no mayonnaise on the sandwiches, please!\" FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES in various places when we made the order online. In turn, they slathered that mayonnaise on perhaps a bit more than usual. Many of our dinners have been ruined because of this. \n\nSecond, their fries are usually soggy and under cooked. Some people like that, and I have no qualms with shoving them in the oven for a short while but this defeats the purpose of \"ordering out\" in my opinion\n\nThird, the delivery person will without fail call you and make you come out to the street to get your food.

Feeling the pressure from newcomer Smile House Cafe down the street, and T-28 further down, these folks, always consistently good through the years, have decided to really \"ramp it up\" and COMPETE, (a good sign, I'm always impressed when I see businesses doing that. It means they are smart, are paying attention, and value their customer base's loyalty.) So in the competitive environment of the Taraval St HK Cafes, S&E has made a conscious decision to compete.....and the result is that they WIN, hands down! Just finished their spectacular \"Portuguese Chicken\" with spaghetti. Giant sized and Yum-O!! Great value and definitely worth the money. Be hungry when you order this, and you will be full, guaranteed! POSTSCRIPT: Except for offering Winnie and I \"jello\" for the complimentary dessert (offered to all customers at the end of their dinner meal,) while offering all Chinese customers \"sweet potato dessert,\" the dinner was perfect. (Yo! Ma! Do I look like \"jello\" to you? Dang dawg, why you wanna be so prejudice? Lol. Haha. Jk. But n e way, Winnie, overhearing them offer that to all the Chinese tables around us, and not the \"jello,\" told the waitress that we would prefer the sweet potato one, and she did bring it to us.) Point being, they do offer dessert to everyone! (unlike some Cantonese restaurants that offer it only to their Chinese customers, something I have experienced countless times both here in SF and in the East Bay, see my review for \"Kirin.\") even if they do their version of \"racial profiling,\" when they do. Haha. All in all though, a good place to go for a quick, good, filling, casual dinner after work. But man, that dang Portuguese chicken, can't get my mind offa that....:)", "author": "George F."}

I still remember their place before they remodeled it to the way it currently looks.\n\nBesides opening late (I believe 2 AM), S & E Caf\u00e9 foods' can definitely satisfy one's appetite quite well. In addition to being flavorful, their portions are more than average. Depending on how much you can eat, you can have some leftovers, though it may not be a complete meal; more so, a snack. What I also like is the presentation of the food. Very often I order the club sandwich. The way they cut and place their meats, lettuce, and everything good in between usually stay together after I take a bite. It's not sloppy at all.\n\nThe service here is quite good. There's one particular waiter that seems very aware of customer needs (i.e., automatically refilling tea without being asked) and always smiling when taking down your order.\n\nAlthough this is a cash only place, there are plenty of ATMs around the neighborhood (and even one right next to this place).

This place is a solid 3.5 stars.\n\nFor this restaurant, each dinner dish included a fresh dinner roll, soup of the day mini bowl, choice of rice or spaghetti and coffee or tea or milktea.\nOur dinner was: \n* Grilled Pork Chops with House Sauce and White Rice $9.95 (4 of 5) The dish came with two boneless pork chops. They were good portion and very moist and juicy. It was a very tasty piece of pork steak. The house sauce was mediocre. I prefer pepper sauce with my pork chops, but the menu didn't list it, so I assumed they don't serve it. The side vegetables were an assortment of dark and leafy greens and heavily boiled in salt and garlic. It was pretty salty, but fine when I ate it with the rice. \n* Oven Baked Pork Chops with Tomato Sauce over Fettuccine $9.95 (3 of 5) The dish came out with a baked top. Be warned-hot plate. The pork chops were sliced and I found minced celery and onions in the tomato sauce. It was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI think my pan fried pork chops were better than the oven baked chops because they were not sliced and retained their meat juice and moisture. \n\nOnto the sides, I did enjoy their dinner roll (5 of 5). It was a really yummy dinner roll. Fluffy and lightly sweetened. LIke hawaiian buns, but not really. \nThe daily soup was corn and egg flower soup (2 of 5). It was really watered down and really peppery. Not the highlight of the meal.  \nLastly, the meal included dessert. The choice was a cut of J-E-L-L-O or small bowl of red bean tapioca sweetened. We both choose the tapioca (2 of 5), but it was like the daily soup. The dessert was watered down. \n\nThis caf\u00e9 serves better quality meat, but has no daily specials. The price starts at $9.95 and goes up from there. It is nice and clean.

Our food all arrived at different times, with the last meal taking at least 50minutes from the first meal. We asked for a discount or refund for the last meal, because we had all finished eating, and it's ridiculous to think it's okay to deliver a meal so late compared to everyone else's. They claimed that it was really busy, and that they \"didn't forget the meal, it just took forever to cook,\" which was very obviously not the case. It was very clear that they had forgotten the order.

It was one of those nights of partying and drinking that really screwed me up. Shortly after I ordered my food, which tasted great and came quickly, I fell asleep next to the other half of my club sandwich for about half an hour. When I woke up, I threw up in your sink, which is probably clogged by now. I avoided the toilet because of my bad knee and because I didn't want to touch the toilet or the ground. I am really sorry. Your restaurant has great food and great service. From what I remember, the club sandwich was great, and did a good job of keeping me full for that half hour. I will come again for sure!

The meat(s) are savory and, once you add in the sauce and the rice, you've got a delicious meal to enjoy. These are a staple in the HK cuisine and the portions here are more than enough - each dish comes with a soup and bread (both of which are delicious and a nice starter) and milk tea or coffee. The milk tea is quite good and has a nice hint of sweetness when you ask for the condensed milk. If baked dishes aren't your thing, there's also sandwiches, noodle soups, and other rice and noodle dishes to choose from.\n\nIf you've got a Yelp account, check in and they'll give you a free soda or iced lemon tea (one of my favorite drinks at HK restaurants)! \n\nWord of caution: parking sometimes sucks in the area so be prepared to walk a block or two if necessary.", "author": "Cheston W."}

They served us the wet wings by accident, but they were so good that I really couldn't complain. They were crispy, flavorful, and fresh! This alone made my trip to S & E Cafe worth it. If I'm going to splurge, this is definitely worth it.\n\nThe other dishes that we got were just so so, including the Almond Chicken, Black Bean Sauce Noodles, and Dried Saut\u00e9ed String Beans. The sauce used for the chicken and noodles tasted very similar (even though I don't think it was supposed to). In fact, when we brought our leftovers home, we ended up just mixing the two and heating them up together. The string beans were okay, but a bit salty.\n\nI will say that their portions are huge. You will definitely leave this place with leftovers unless you are a skilled eater :)\n\nThe only other comment I have is about the wait. Instead of using a host/hostess to take down names, they hang a whiteboard next to the front door and have people sign up themselves. As there are a lot of people who want to eat here, it gets confusing whose name goes where and who was here first. As a result, I had to hover over the board in the crowded entrance to make sure no one was stepping in front of me.", "author": "Sean C."}

It's pretty much your typical HK style cafe, similar to ABC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ezLa_XcMRNBAgDEU6eeeAA) or Broadway Bistro (http://www.yelp.com/biz/V8OScvscIu3y8TPhKyRhAg?fsid=MfNMwhggv4VovbcpT3AJ2g). However, it's not as trashy as the first, nor as stuffy as the second.\n\nAnyhow, the food itself is decent, but nowhere near the best in town. Any of your basic HK fusion style dishes can be found here, such as Portuguese chicken/pork chop, curry beef stew, baked seafood covered in cheese, chicken/pork chop with corn, etc. all over rice or spaghetti. At 1:17 am, it's plenty good to fill me up, although it's not exactly a scintillating feast by any means.\n\nThe service can be a bit shoddy at times, with the waitresses sometimes acting like they don't want to be there. The good thing is that they have never kick us out no matter how long we sit and chill.\n\nS&E is actually a cool hangout spot for the local teenagers and college aged kids, and it looks like many of Sunset's finest like to patronize at the wee hours of the morning. My crew and I have been known to spit a few lines or two at the customers here.  =P\n\nThere is also nightclub right above, but I have never been inside. I don't know if they are connected or not, but it seems a bit shady to me, and always gated up. Maybe one day, I'll have to check it out.", "author": "Eric W."}

With the old one they had a \"happy hour\" of sorts with tea sets of smaller portioned food that was perfect. Now there is a place that tries too hard to stay with the times trying to cater to both the Asian crowd and the American crowd. The food itself for the price is uninspiring to say the least. The place is clean but I would say you can go to any other place in the sunset to get something better. The only thing that this place has is that it's open late at night.\n\nBack to the food and it being bland. The portions seem to get smaller and smaller every time I come here, and their soups are just plain tasteless. The drinks seem like their big but they fill most of em with tons of ice just to make it look cool. The Singapore style noodles have no bite and they seem to even screw up the fried noodles also.

I was pleased that the curry chicken over rice had solid pieces of lean chicken in it (some of the other late-nite places have very fatty chicken).   The three meat noodles was tasty, although the quality of the pork pieces wasn't that good.    The yang chow fried rice was good...generous amounts of shrimp thrown in for good measure.   \n\nService isn't outstanding.    Expect to be aggressive in asking for tea or extra napkins.   Nobody actually came around to refill tea the whole time that my friend and I were eating there.   I found it rude, but laughable, almost to the second that we finished our meal (at around 1:30 a.m.), the waitress almost instantaneously teleported over to our table to present us the bill, as if they couldn't get us out fast enough.   \n\nIt's not that cheap ($7-$9/plate) but I'd rather pay a little more to avoid getting garbage on the table.

I've been here maybe two or three times, but they were not as bad as ABC, like I stated before. They have the typical cafe food such as, ramen noodles, etc. Prices are decent, people are decent, but I think I remember them taking forever to make my ramen noodle.

I think it's been over a year since the menu has changed and over a couple months since they had their huge renovation. The place looks really nice now, but they cut down their menu a lot from what it was before. I guess I'm a bit bitter that they took out my old favorite dishes. Nowadays when I come in with my friends I take a long time debating about what I want to eat since I'm still not sure what's necessarily good there. But anyways, the food is decent, it's okay/cheap-priced, and it looks really nice. Oh yeah it's open really late which is good for late night diners. All in all pretty decent place but nothing too spectacular.", "author": "Julie L."}

Their variety of Chinese and \"Gong Sik Sai Chan\" literally \"Chinese know make western dishes.\" is amazing. This ain't your daddy's ABC garbage, this is for some true cuisine seekers. They know how to make their food delicious and not even remotely disgusting. Fried rice, flat noodles, linguine pasta with pork chops, sandwiches, and a multitude of special sweet drinks make this place a unique dining experience. After the remodel, this place is clean, the staff is efficient, and I feel comfortable sitting in the restaurant. Before the remodel, the place felt like it didn't want you inside of it. Hopefully they can upkeep the way it looks now. -1 point for parking is insane sometimes and completely impossible on 19th", "author": "Chris L."}

I remember when it looked like crap but for some reason those were the better experience I had.  The other night I came here and the worst experience ever.  I ordered the Sweet and sour fish with rice.  They should just change it to sweet and sour sauce with a hint of rice and fish.  The sauce was so overwhelming.  This was the only time I ever had to dig through the sauce soaked rice to find some plain white rice to eat, how sad was that.  I ended up leaving the whole plate full of their red sauce mess.  I give this place a 3 star because its open late, as long as you dont get the sweet and sour fish you'll be safe.", "author": "David O."}

I tried a few months ago to eat at the new S&E at a busy time but left after waiting 15 min without having my existence acknowledged. I think the place is one of the best examples in SF of its type of cuisine (HK version of an American coffee shop--that's shop, not house, think Woolworth's lunch counter or Denny's/Lyons, not Starbucks), so this evening I decided to give it another try. Good thing I did.\n\nYes, the decor is much nicer, with the bamboo at the entrance, dark grained linoleum floors, wood-grained Formica tables and the framed food porn photos on the wall above each table. And the service was better than the previous reviewer said, with one of the waiters coming by now and then so see if I (or other diners) needed a refill on my lai cha (HK condensed milk tea) or needed ice water.\n\nTonight I got one of the two specials listed in Chinese at the door (the printed menu is completely translated, and the waitstaff will happily translate the door specials on request. Cheng tong hoisin saimin translates as soup with seafood and angle hair pasta. It was $13 and well worth it: a soup plate with broth containing salmon, prawns, some kind of white fish, with bits of asparagus and tomato. Yes, at this price the fish was probably farmed but it was all good and I finished it off.\n\nThe price included my choice of hot coffee or  tea, or for those in the know hot HK tea with sweetened condensed milk. True to its coffee shop origins, it also included a small cup of soup (chicken veggie with macaroni) and a dinner roll (nothing fancy, just like you'd get at a coffee shop). Jello or, again for those who know to ask, a cup of HK style barely sweetened red bean and tapioca soup for dessert.\n\nIf you're feeling nostalgic for mid-western food, this is the place. Just be aware that you're seeing it through an HK lens, and that the prawns come in-shell with tails (they did take the heads off, but that's not a given in these types of places). Keeping that in mind, it's a good buy.\n\n(Just be warned, french toast at this kind of place generally comes without syrup.)", "author": "Charles B."}

In the past year or so they've updated both their menu and decor, both for the better, in my opinion. Yes, the prices are a higher than before, and they no longer do free substitutions with drinks (soda instead of coffee, for example), but this is quibbling. Before they offered a significantly wider range of choices (such as baked pasta), but they were very hit-and-miss. The accompanying vegetables in particular used to be served almost raw, without any seasoning whatsoever. Now they still offer both Chinese and Western dishes, but less of them, and everything on the plate is tastier.\n\nMy partner and I went there this past weekend. We ordered two of the dinner specials: pork chop with onion sauce over rice and the chicken with cream sauce and spaghetti. The entrees came with coffee or milk tea, a hot roll, soup of the day (ours was cream of spinach), and a red bean dessert. Both of us thought the soup was delicious, and it appeared they actually make it themselves rather than from a can. The entrees were both cooked well, the meat still tender and juicy. They came with a small amount of mixed veggies (zucchini, broccoli, and carrots) which were sauteed in garlic and butter -- quite good! I wish they had included twice as many veggies as they did. The pasta was also very good, with a hint of garlic and olive oil seasoning.\n\nFor about $10 a person, this was a satisfying meal and a good value. I'd stick to the mainstream dishes and you probably won't go wrong here.", "author": "Sasquatch M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-07", "description": "So, I would say that S&E is a step up from ABC cafe on noriega.  If you want to escape the firm clutches of ABC without having to escape Sunset then you should try S&E.  I'll have to use ABC as a comparision tool on this review.  Same type of food, but with a much cleaner and renovated environment.  S&E certainly doesn't close as late as ABC though.   The food here is much prettier with more garnishings...a sprinkle of cheese here and a dash of parsely there.  They've gone with a cream of carrot soup instead of the vegetable soup you'de get from ABC.  I actually just ordered a cup watermelon juice (quite decently sized I would say) while my friend ordered the NY steak special posted on the front chalkboard, and a porkchop and fish meal.  I was surprized the NY steak meal came with two large shrimp wrapped in bacon.  And again, both dishes were quite nice to look at when compared to the meals from ABC.  Both my friends enjoyed their meals and said it was very tasty.  The guy on the table next to us had ordered some type of fried fish meal but told the waitress that it was too salty and she quickly told the chef and aksed him what he'd like in place of it. that was quite nice.  This review is getting way too long...so to sum it up,  S&E = Hong Kong Style cafe, cleaner than ABC, A SLIGHT variation from ABC, a LITTLE more expensive from ABC.", "author": "LittleBird 8."}

Two of my friends and I hung out really late one night and drove around sunset to see what was open for a quick bite.  The only place we discovered at the time:  S & E Cafe.  We didn't know when they closed, but we took our chances and parked on the street nearby.  We realized we got there 10 minutes before they closed.  We were the only guests and we were surprised that they actually let us order still even when they were pretty much all set to go.  Luckily for them, only one out of three people ordered something.  My friend ordered (the always safe dish)  baked tomato sauce over porkchop, rice and egg.  I took a few bites, and it was as good as I thought it'd be.  Personally, that's one of my favorite dishes at Western-style Chinese restaurants.  You really could never go wrong with that dish.  Anywho, good to know that the next time I come here, I should come wayyy before 2 AM lol.", "author": "Jasmine T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-18", "description": "The S&E has a new, improved, and expanded menu that is greatly appreciated.  All I need to make me happy is French toast at 2 A.M.  The place is really clean and the guy I assume is the owner is always chilling with some group in the back, which makes him look like a pimp.  Everytime I order here it is a gamble because the food is different everytime, but I cant bring myself to complain because I eat there so often.  I am the only non-Asian customer I have seen there, so it may only be a problem for me, but a few waitresses sometimes don't understand my order.  The news in the background always seems to spark good conversation.  I cant say many things bad about a place three blocks from my house, open until early morning, and pretty cheap.  It isn't outstanding but its good enough for me.", "author": "lup b."}
