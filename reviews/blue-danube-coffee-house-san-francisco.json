I live in the neighborhood and have never had such a bad experience with a local coffee house until today. We went in there at 8:25am on a Saturday morning. It wasn't busy at all. It took us close to 30 minutes to get 2 large lattes and a breakfast bagel, a breakfast wrap, and a plain bagel to go. I'm also so irritated that the breakfast sandwich was an open sandwich. No where on the menu did it say that! It was also supposed to come with a fruit cup, which wasn't in my box. This breakfast sandwich cost me $9. We could have spent the same amount at The Richfield for example and get much better service and more food. Never coming back here again. The worst!!!", "author": "Minna F."}

For some reason, my sandwich was both crispy and soggy...they pressed it panini-style, but had a really soggy tomato in there...which meant that my sandwich was soggy on the bottom. Because. They put the soggy stuff on the bottom. o.O Sandwich fail!\n\nThe wifi here is crap. For the $2/hour I paid, I feel like I should have gotten quality wifi. I mean, it didn't seem like the others here were using THAT much internet. I loaded google docs, which took forever. Tried google street view for my next locale, and I couldn't get the maps to load at all. It was a blurry mess. \n\nThe coffee...because I'm an addict, was okay. It's not the best coffee you'll get, but it's solid. This might be a good place to meet up with someone and catch up, but definitely not good to study or work from. \n\nOh. Also.

You got your order on time so what do you care? You don't. This place is cool in your book. This review isn't gonna change your mind so keep going there. You're gonna be satisfied, you're gonna love the ambience and have a great time - but just know that while you suck down that smoothie and sip on your latte, there's someone like me waiting for their fucking sandwich for 50 fucking minutes. I'm not even joking about that time too; it was 1:05p.m. when i ordered and 1:55p.m. when they gave it to me in a box so the workers don't have to deal with me anymore. \n\nYou guys working that day probably thought you smoothed things out by finally getting me my sandwich, but wait till your boss reads this review. If you're the owner of Blue Danube Cafe, the guy taking orders at the counter was a pony-tailed latino dude, one waitress was a short asian, and another waitress was a chubby latino girl. All your employees were to blame for this fuck-up. Not one of them stepped-in and assured me my order was on it's way. Not one. I actually had to get-up and tell Mr.Ponytail about waiting after 30 minutes. Still, even after another 20 minutes, orders were heading out to the other patrons leaving me going; \"what the fucking fuck man?!\". Shouldn't my order take precedence now? Mr.Ponytail, how nice of you to actually get your ass into the kitchen and make the sandwitch yourself in front of the kitchen staff.\n\nNot even a fucking courtesy refund. 50 minutes you incompetent dummies. 50 minutes. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you idiots let this kinda shit happen all the fucking time. No-one is calling you out of this crap in politically correct San francisco.

I ended up paying just under $10 for a sandwich that wouldn't satisfy my appetite. I'm a bit torn because while the sandwich wasn't as big as I would've liked, it comes with a salad. Personally, I'd rather have a bigger sandwich than a side salad, but at least it forces me to eat more vegetables haha.\n\nI pondered their juices and smoothies menu, seemed like more of a fair pricing structure, given that they supposedly used organic ingredients and Jamba Juice (bleh) is more expensive.\n\nI hate to knock a small business on pricing, I understand they're a small business, which I like to support.

It would be fine if the stellar food somehow made up for it, but as mentioned above, it doesn't.

There is a small TV by the door showing soccer with many nicely framed artwork and mirrors all around the walls. This place gets a lot of natural sunlight from its large opened windows, and the old wooden decor gives this mom and pop the layout that embodies the spirit of San Francisco. \n\nSitting here doing some work for the last few hours has been a blast. There's a lot of foot traffic to allow for people watching while those who remain are either reading or waiting for their name to be called at Burma SuperStar. My soy Americano ($2.35) gave me a nice jolt while the background music made it easy to keep motivated on my writing, including this review. Haha...\n\nService is friendly and responsive. Although they do provide wifi service it is unfortunately not free ($4 whole day). 4.5 stars for a great cafe with lots of character and very cool ambiance.", "author": "Daniel L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "There are only a couple of things I really want from a coffee shop. One of those is good coffee, and Blue Danube has that (but then, so do literally hundreds of other places in San Francisco). I also want a good atmosphere, and Blue Danube has that (but so do hundreds of other places in San Francisco). I want polite, efficient staff, and Blue Danube has that (but so do hundreds of other places in San Francisco). \n\nBut the single thing I most want -- the consideration that trumps literally everything else -- is that if I get a cup of coffee to go, I want the lid to fit tightly enough onto the cup that they effectively restrict the coffee from exiting the cup/lid combination anywhere other than through the designated drinking hole, so that the cup/lid combination is essentially a single object THAT DOESN'T LEAK ALL THE FUCK OVER YOUR SHIRT WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING AND TRYING TO DRINK IT. This is the single most important factor that 95% of the coffeehouses I've ever been to get right EVERY SINGLE TIME I visit them, and this is of course the area in which Blue Danube failed the one and only time I tried to get coffee there. In fact, their lid leaked faster and harder than basically any other defective lid I've ever dealt with at any other coffee shop ever. I must have lost a good 15% of my drink onto my necktie, which I failed to notice until the drink was maybe 2/3 gone because my necktie, you know, doesn't have any nerve endings in it, and can't tell me when coffee is leaking on it while I'm driving.\n\nSo, yeah, pretty good coffee. Pretty good baked goods. Nice atmosphere. But if the price of getting coffee from this place is involuntarily wearing their coffee on my clothes for the rest of the day until I get home and can change, then yeah, I'm going to one of the hundreds of other good coffee places in San Francisco next time.", "author": "Patrick M."}

Also a great spot to strike up conversation if you choose. The chairs and tables are arranged in friendly way. I've never tried the food. But I did get a coffee to go, and didn't have any problems with the lid leaking. \n\nI'm a fan, since I think coffee shops have gotten way too corporate, and uncomfortable.

However, space is a commodity in the city so finding this place was quite difficult (I drove by this place twice without realizing it). But once I found this unassuming little hang out and stepped inside, I felt like I was home. It had everything I wanted in a coffee shop. Two desktops were located in the front. Comfy couches in one corner. The tables didn't really match (they look like they were taken out of some guys house). Jazz was playing too. Furthermore, it was good jazz and not that new, smooth kenny g stuff. Also, I love the fact that the menu was hand written on a blackboard instead of being ready-made like the dollar menu at some McDonalds because it makes me feel like they actually care about what they do. \n\nSo I ordered the mexican hot chocolate (a chocolate bar melted into some milk with cinnamon, nutmeg and other stuff). It was one of the best hot chocolates I've ever ordered. While other coffee shops create a rather disgusting hot coco that becomes chalky towards the end, Blue Danube's version is quite smooth throughout. Instead of a clump of coco powder at the bottom of the cup, these guys have REAL SUGAR! \n\nThe service was alright. They seemed friendly enough.\n\nIn short: Mexican Hot Chocolate is rather good, Love the vibe, Price may be a bit high, I will be back for sure and suggest I suggest that you stop by if you're in inner richmond and have time to kill or just want to relax.", "author": "John B."}

Lots of parking early in the AM and you don't have to pay the meter until 9am. The shop itself is cute and the latte was decent. However, they charge $2 if you want to use wi-fi. Seriously? Even McDonald's gives you free wi-fi. Also, when I handed the guy my credit card he said there is a $5 minimum and he was really strict about this. It's not posted anywhere so I didn't know beforehand. I've been to a few places that have a minimum for credit card use but they have always been nice about it and let it slide since I didn't know. It's too bad this place did not turn out to be 4-star material. I was hoping to have found my new morning coffee shop.", "author": "Megan P."}

PARKING is a pain but I suggest circling the block and looking for parking on Clement...one is bound to open up.  \n\nOK -- to the food!  I got the half sandwich/salad combo with Mexican hot chocolate and my bf got the french toast with a 12oz orange juice (also have 16oz).  The french toast DELIVERED...the best I've ever had.  The hot chocolate had a cinnamon-y/subtle spicy flavor that was OFF THE CHAAAIN.  My tuna sandwich had new, unique flavors I've never had in a tuna sandwich (it was orange-y in color!) and my mixed green salad was fresh and well-tossed (had onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and dark leafy greens)  We sat out in the sun and enjoyed a filling, yet light brunch.\n\nThey have a really wide selection of beverages and foods that I want to come back and try.  WHAT A TREASURE!  \n\nOnly thing that kind of caught me off guard was the CASH ONLY.

I love brewing up some fresh tea, watching the leaves open up and let the smell permeate my nose. Lately I have been going to different coffee shops to get my study on, school has been consuming my life and I hate it. Sadly there isn't much i can do, I am going to graduate after this up and coming spring semester so i need to crack down and get my shit done! So lately I've noticed that i have been choosing coffee over tea and I am really not sure why...\n\nI was here at Blue Danube last nite, but not to study. Just to relax, enjoy a Bright Eye(Ghirardelli chocolate and Expresso blended with ice) and chat with one of my good friends Jan S. One thing i noticed that i really loved was large window panes or more like window doors that open up and allow some natural air to flow through the cafe. The walls were covered with various different art work and the menu was packed with different food items, smoothies, coffee and alcoholic drinks. I've decided that i won't be coming here to study because this will be my spot to chill and chat with people. It has a relaxing environment which helped me unwind and mellow out. \n\nOne thing i really wanted to try, sadly the kitchen was closed when we got there was the FRENCH TOAST...ive been drooling over the pictures that ive seen of it.

Here, you order the coffee and they dispense it for you from a pot behind the counter. Pretty strong coffee.

We usually get one breakfast plate (a GREAT brunch spot, not that I want to divulge this secret for all you folks overrating Eats and Q nearby.) The sandwiches have really yummy Ciabatta bread and the fresh salad always comes with a light, sweet and tangy vinaigrette.

With a rustic wooden interior, this place looks very much like a cafe you'd find in Vienna.  It reminded me very much of a miniature version of a Gasthaus in Wien called the Schloss \"something\" across the street from the Zentralfreidhoff (central cemetery) where Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and even the composer of the \"Blue Danube Waltz\", Johann Strauss Jr. are buried.\n\nThere are small tables, a wonderful couch and even a few seats with internet access for a nominal fee.  For dinner I had the Rosemary Focaccia Sandwich and a Blue Danube salad which is spinach, cranberries, slice apples and other interesting ingredients that blend well together.\n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable but the crowd seems a tad too eavesdroppy as if talking isn't the coolest thing to do.  That being said, it's still a comfortable world sheltered from the San Franciscan noise.\n\nThe Sangria was excellent, and for a healthy dessert capper, I enjoyed a very tasty smoothie called the \"Bananarama\" which is a mixture of yogurt, honey, cinamon, and bananas.  As it was made fresh, it was smoooooooooth and very good.  Most of the smoothies fit the overall musical vibe of the cafe's name by having musical references.  Not classical references like a Beethoven's 9th smoothie, but references to recent bands.  \n\nHaving a smoothie called a Banarama and given how cruelly cold it was in the city yesterday, having a drink named after the band who wrote \"Cruel Summer\" seems highly intuitive.", "author": "Tony U."}

Even though it is clear across town from me, I hopped on Muni 2 to try this place this morning, and what a great breakfast I had this morning!  \n\nI had the California wrap (lox, avocado, capers, eggs) and a small mocha for about $10.  I was ear-to-ear smiling eating at my window seat looking out to Clement Street - it was sooooo goooood.  The tortilla used for the wrap was thin enough to hold everything all together without overwhelming the fillings - the lox and capers were a perfect salty balance against the avocado and fluffy egg layer.  And the wrap was perfectly toasted.  Yum!  And the mocha rounded out my meal nicely.  \n\nService was very friendly and smiley - that is always appreciated!  5 stars, definitely!

I had a single espresso, a plain croissant and their granola.  The espresso had a nice foam on top and was surprisingly perfect to my taste which is not over bitter.  I've seen the mixed reviews on their coffee, but I certainly liked my espresso.\n\nTheir croissant was flaky and soft.  The granola was served in whole milk with fresh fruit on top.  The blueberries and blackberries were large and perfectly plump with the strawberries and sliced banana being sweet.   Ever notice that the smallest of things can make the difference in your day?  The granola made my morning.\n\nI have decided to make this place a mainstay for a quick breakfast.  Tip:  for more table space, sit in the middle of the cafe.", "author": "Janet H."}

No offense to the cute coffeemaker and worker, but Blue Danube needs a little work. First, it's super crowded and the seating is so awkward. Everyone is kind of too close to one another and there's barely any room to even look comfortable. Second, you have to pay for Wi-Fi? I mean come on... the coffee is already a bit too much to start off with. When asked about the Wi-Fi, one of the workers in the back rudely told me \"You know you have to pay for it right...?\" No, I didn't and that's why I asked? Personally, I didn't have such a great experience with my Iced Peppermint Mocha either. It was watered down - not enough coffee and too much syrup.

You all know the coffee shop I'm talking about; chalkboard menu, standard espresso drinks, dried-out pastries, mediocre food, salvage furniture and musty carpet, probably near a college campus. There are tons of these. And Blue Danube isn't, at first sight, terribly different. In fact, you may even peer in a few times and write it off as an impostor, before you actually patronize.\n\nBut you should go in. Blue Danube is full of sparkly details that really set it apart from the horde of shitty cafes. \n\nFirstly, they have beer and wine. Judge not lest ye be judged in return, okay? A beer and wine license makes any cafe better, and you know it. Also, they have sangria. Which makes pretty much everything better.\n\nSecondly, they have a sizeable menu of decent foods, including tasty sandwiches and classy little amuse bouche plates of apples and brie. \n\nThirdly, they sell individual Oreos. Out of a jar. So you're like, \"Hmm. Mediocre madeleine, or trusty Oreo? Trusty Oreo. Definitely\" (Which, yes, I realize will kill you at age 30, but they don't have Newman-O's and there's a limit to how picky even I can be.

Since the full sandwich comes with a mixed greens salad, I took this to mean that I can get a 1/2 order of a sandwich with 1/2 order of one of their special fancy salads.  Not so.  I was informed I can only get the mixed green salad.  I get that anyway with the full sandwich, and it costs almost as much as the full sandwich, so I said no way - just give me the full sandwich.  It wasn't overly large, I might add.  \n\nThe one I ordered was pretty good.  It was called the Caprese Sandwich: mozzarella, basil, tomato, greens, and balsamic.  The mixed greens salad is actually very nice too.  I'm going to have to go back to try out the coffee.

You add tomatoes to yours, a fresh take on the traditional style which I enjoy very much.  All of your breakfast open-faced bagel sandwiches that I've tried are delicious, including the scrambled egg and cheese one.  Your fancy-shsmancy french toast is sweet and rich, and at lunchtime your sandwiches and salads are quite satisfying.  I am especially a fan of both your tuna salad and sandwich.  You're even open late enough for me to enjoy this delightful cafe fare for dinner.\n\nIn my personal opinion, your coffee leaves something to be desired, but it's pretty good in espresso-drink form.  So if I must have caffeine with my delicious breakfast bagel or decadent french toast, I get it in latte form.\n\nThank you, Blue Danube, for providing a much-needed European-style cafe right here on Clement St.\n\nCheers,\nErin", "author": "Erin M."}

I'm very picky with my coffee, and I like to drink it black (I know crazy, but I use to work at a coffee shop that will remain nameless and we had to do tastings all the time).  I like the fact that they have huge windows that they leave open, so even if you sit inside you get a nice breeze and don't feel like you are in a stuffy room.  It is always crowded, so if you like to people watch, this is great place.  Also they serve beer!  Now that just makes this coffee shop even better.", "author": "Sarah M."}

They also have some fragrant delish coffee and some great looking desserts. We went last night to see Tranny Bear and Trout play (kind of a performance art band) and art show. My husband and I really enjoyed looking at and discussing the art, which had both Asian and Media influences. I would say the pieces on display were vibrant and playful. If you have a chance stop by and check them out. The band was great, it was a very interactive performance and the crowd loved it. Something about a band in costume and singing full throttle guarantees a good time. Reminded me of the good old college days and Luna's in Sacto. Anyway it's a great place and I would totally go there again and the owner is awesome to provide this venue to local artists and the hungry public.", "author": "Tiffany T."}

Great.\r\n\r\nThat's what you get when you go to this place. Twice, now, the hipsters behind the counter have taken out their issues out on my out-of-town guests. First, one friend asked what kind of fruit juices they had, and the short-haired brunette smirked as she rolled her eyes, \"Honey, there's a whole LIST behind you.\" Why didn't she say, \"You can check out the menu behind you and I recommend the watermelon-strawberry\"? Why is that so hard?\r\n\r\nThe second incident was this weekend when my sister-in-law stood at what she thought was the beginning of the line, because they have a long counter and no sign as to where to stand. Turns out she was standing in the area where you can wait for your food after ordering; we weren't there so we couldn't tell her, but I can totally see how it is confusing. The food preparer behind the counter asked if she'd been helped and like any normal person, she said, no, but can I have X and Y? The blonde behind the register then turned to her and said, condescendingly, \"This OTHER customer was before YOU. Next time, the line is over HERE.\" Not, \"Sorry, would you mind waiting until after I help this customer? The line is actually over here.\" See? Not hard. Well, the customer is always right and so my sister-in-law walked out while they were making her order to give her money to some people with manners.\r\n\r\nI don't care that what I have ordered there has been fine.

It was a wet, rainy, Sunday afternoon in the city - perfect coffee drinking weather. The caf\u00e9 is small, some might say too small, but it makes up for its lack of space with good old fashioned bohemian ambiance. There were lots of people there: students, artists, suits, etc. It's nice to see a diverse crowd at a coffeehouse - I think it adds a little character to the establishment. They have a fine coffee/ tea menu and a pretty extensive food menu for a coffeehouse. The Mexican hot chocolate that I had was delicious and my wife certainly enjoyed her Chai tea. We also tried their Brie and apple plate and it was very tasty; The veggie sandwich that we tried was also very good. Over all, I would recommend Blue Danube - good atmosphere, good coffee, good food, friendly staff. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that you have to pay to use the internet.

I ordered at the counter it was $3.25 and then sat down to wait. When i was finally served, holy by golly wow, the thing was huge, about the size of half my head. The cup though big was a perfect hug mug. The first sips were the best with the mixture of foaminess and melted marshmallow that accented the cinnamon and nutmeg in the chocolate. Lipsmackin good and perfect for a winters day. This is no chocolate pouch with water, the drink is made of real chocolate melted by steamed milk with dashes of spice that really makes the drink special. \n\nMy bf is a big fan of Mexhotchoc and I can't wait to take him here!", "author": "Nicole L."}

I have a theory that you're better off studying comfortably over struggling to focus and mentally trying to drag yourself over your material, so I hoped that this place would be comfortable and worth the trek. All I knew about it I looked up on Yelp because I've never been to this neighborhood before. \nIt went well; I got a seat right by the large open window and it was a warm night. I got a (decent) hot chocolate and I pulled out my binder, my two French books, my French verb book and my French dictionary - along with some worksheets and pencils. So I took up the whole table, I was in the depths of translating this stupid story called \"Generation Kangaroo\" which I'm going to be tested on next week when.. this horny couple posts right next to me outside. Oh nights when they have the windows open, you become oh-so-aware of  whoever sits outside because they're right against you practically - too bad it doesn't work the other way (?) cause this couple did not consider me at all. I had all my schoolwork out and I'm pretty obviously trying to focus on my work rather than their non-talent of loud lipsmacking kisses and annoying yuppy-couple-banter. I could not clear my throat, cough and fake-sneeze enough. It was a classic \"No, you move! I'm not going anywhere\" moment.  So just keep in mind that if you go here, you might run into that \"fun\" swinger couple that wants to give you a little show.

Outdoor tables, cozy inside, and it's literally less than a block from my house. \n\nBut I can't like to myself. And I definitely can't lie to you.\n\nToday I wandered into the Blue Danube on my way to Eva's Hawaiian Cafe. The thought of Hawaiian BBQ seemed a little bit heavy but I haven't tried it since it has opened and for a Sunday afternoon, why not? But first, I needed coffee. SO I decided to give the Blue Danube another try (who says I'm a total hater? see: Buckshot review). The last few times I've tried coffee from there, it was pretty terrible. The espresso tasted burnt and overpowered any minty-ness I had desired. And it was weak, which is even worse. Don't mess with a lady's caffeine intake. Anyway, so I intended to try my latest caffeinated obsession: soy latte (I know, I missed the whole Starbucks era). As I stood in line waiting for my turn, I noticed the sandwich board. Apparently I had forgotten they served light lunchtime fare and it all of a sudden seemed like such a better choice than the fried chicken katsu I had been thinking about all morning. The line was getting shorter and the first sandwich I saw was a B.L.A.T. on multi-grain. Hella yeah. \n\nThere was some shit going on at the counter and the cashier seemed flustered. No big thing, it's Sunday. I ordered my stuff to go and turned around to wait for my goods. \n\nNot one place to move. No room by the counter. Everyone looking at you impatiently for blocking the counter. But where am I supposed to go?! Feeling awkward, I finally saw an empty patch of couch next to a middle aged gentleman. I found out why it was empty, homie was having some deodorant challenged issues. But hey, I lived in Santa Cruz for 5 years so ain't no thang.\n\nThe soy latte came up; not bad. Not great, kind water-y. Kind of weak / no taste. 1 point for using vanilla soy though.\n\nThe sandwich finally came up. A man brought it out in a to go box. I was excited. BLAT! Just the name is enough to get excited over.  Bacon! Lettuce! Tomato! Avocado! I practically skipped my way home.\n\nI love mayo as much as the next overweight American. I dip my fries in it. A sandwich is never complete without it. And both sides of the burger bun get it's own helping.  Yet, there is such thing as overload. When I opened the box, the first thing I saw was mayo, mayo, MAYO! Like it was attacking the sandwich. The whole thing felt somewhat soggy from the pure amount of mayo slapped on there. Did I mention it takes me about 2 minutes to walk home from the Danube?\n\nThe next thing I noticed was how thin the poor thing was. Upon further investigaton and peeling of the bread, there seemed to be some soggy pieces of romaine and wait, what was that? Ohhhh, those tiny reddish brown things were bacon? The tiniest pieces of bacon on the planet I think. And hold up, where's the avocado?! WHERE IS THE AVOCADO? Missing :( $7.25  for that experience! Perhaps if I hadn't felt the pressure to get out of the way of this place, I would've checked before I left. Sigh.\n\nThe whole experience bummed me out. How fantastic would it be to have an awesome sandwich place down the street? Seems like I won't find out any time soon :( I suppose it's a decent place to go if you can actually find a place to sit and don't order anything besides a black cup of coffee.

It's bijou enough to be cozy, but there are still comfy low couches to be found. The coffee is very good, though not fantastic, but that's not what this place is about. What keeps me coming back is the atmosphere - it's balanced. Not as self-consciously hip as Ritual, and not as over-40 bridge-and-tunnel as Trieste. And, as someone else said, it's definitely not Starbucks. It's quiet, but most of the regulars are open and social. The baristas are friendly and the menu is surprisingly good. There are juices and smoothies to be had, as well as wine, and the food is excellent. If nothing else, try the Greek yogurt, I usually get two. \n\nOne other plus is that it's open later than most other cafes I've seen around here - 10 on weekdays and 11 on weekends, which is perfect for a procrastinating student like myself.", "author": "david p."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-23", "description": "This review is purely based on the coffee as I had read most people who rated this place high were due to the food items: \n\nI was dining at Burma Superstar across the street and decided to finish off with some coffee.  They had a good selection of drinks to order and I noticed that they had holiday flavors.  So I ordered the hazelnut spiced mocha with non fat milk and my fiance ordered a white chocolate mocha with soy milk.  The prices were good; I believe it was $3.50 for large coffees.  The coffee, however, was somewhat of a let down.  Probably because I saw the Yelp sticker outside the window and because I normally prefer mom and pop coffee shops over chain ones.  My coffee was overly sweet and the hazelnut wasn't really highlighted - it tasted more like hot cocoa with a hint of cayenne pepper.  My fiance's white mocha didn't taste anything like white mocha.  It tasted like strong brewed coffee with a hint of flavored syrup.  The baked items I didn't try but they looked pretty dry and it was only 1pm... It was pretty crowded and smelled like a thrift store - i dont know if it was the store or some of the people who happened to be there that day.", "author": "Allison J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-08", "description": "I've been patronizing this coffee house for over twelve years, and have seen it change hands at least three or four times.  The current owners appear to have gotten the establishment's vibe and flavor down, for indeed simultaneously the most lively and mellow java joint in the Clement Street commercial corridor.  The other notable coffee houses in the neighborhood like Java Joint and Cafe de Flore don't really compare in terms of having an inviting attitude  and an interesting, colorful clientele.  \nIt's cosy enough to encourage friendly conversation with fellow coffee goers and also for people watching.  It's also a place for laptop junkies and readers as well as writers.  I've seen people sketching in their black books, and I've seen people killing time awaiting their table at Burma Star, something that wasn't really done back in the day, liquor license notwithstanding.  I sketch in my own black book, so I find this a great place to draw people.  I also like sketching the environment itself, which is busy due to the space's size but contains curious objects, like the large mirror with an ornate frame, and the tree decoration with holiday lights hung from it's leafless branches.  \nAnd it's all so compact, even cramped, but that's what contributes to the place's appeal.  It always gives the illusion of crowdedness, so that when you take your seat inside, you feel  a part of this close knit caffeinated Blue Danube community.  It's like a living room vibe.  You want to stay and watch live reality and hear layered conversation, and that's to me always enjoyable, and as been for over twelve years now.  \nThe coffee's good, the food and desserts are delicious, the beer's on tap and will give you a buzz if you drink enough of it.  One thing I do miss about one of the past incarnations is Wednesday night Simpson's happy hour!   Yup, that's right.  There used to be something like $2 pints during the Simpson's weekly episode, back when a television once hung from the ceiling corner above the entrance.  It was marvelous!", "author": "Roland C."}

I just moved into the area recently and it has since become my regular hangout...unlimited internet for 15/month, and really fresh, good food. The coffee is a little bitter so if you're looking for something based on taste rather than caffeine then it might not be what your looking for. All of the sandwiches that either me or my friends have tried have been amazing. Also, I love the fact that the sandwich plates come with a simple mixed green salad instead of chips which you find at a lot of restaurants (a nice, healthy alternative to some greasier food options). Good baked goods (and cake!) as well. And, if you fancy that you've been working long enough and want to relax with a beer or are just passing time with a drink before dining at Burma Superstar, they have that too (as well as sangria and mimosas!). Besides that, I have to say, whoever chooses the background music makes some good selections...", "author": "Carmen C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-17", "description": "I always want to hang out here more often, but it's busier during the day on the weekends. It's great because they have comfortable seating inside as well as some seating outside for the few sunny days we do get. The owners and the people work there seem to be genuinely nice, and one of the employees introduced me to La Oreja de Van Gogh because he was picking the CDs to play one day. The snacks and drinks aren't bad, but not outstanding. On slow days, it's one of the more comfortable coffee shops in the neighborhood.", "author": "Tami H."}
