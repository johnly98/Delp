The bar has a design where booths and tables are situated all around the entire place. So, you can have privacy or communal seating if feel like it. It's also nice that the servers come around and check on you.\n\nThe back patio is a true patio, which doubles as a beer garden really. Again, there are sections for privacy and the patio is tiered so you get extra isolation if you want. The outdoor area does close earlier though.", "author": "Peter L."}

Wanting to continue the drinking while sitting outside (it was a nice day), one of the boys suggested Valley Tavern. We stopped by on Saturday, June 17th around 2:30pm. We all ordered at the bar and brought our drinks to the outdoor patio.\n\n*Tavern Pimm's Cup: Pimm's No 1, gin, lemon, lime, cucumber, ginger beer ($12)\n*Racer 5 IPA: Bear Republic, Healdsburg CA, 7.5% ABV, 75 IBU ($6.50)\n*Space Dust: Elysian, Seattle WA, 8.2 ABV, 73 IBU ($7.50)\n*Allagash White: Allagash, Portland ME, 5.1% ABV, 28 IBU ($8)\n\nI got the allagash white. I couldn't really drink anymore, so I wanted something that was easy to sip on. We sat outside for a good two hours just enjoying the sun and talking. It was a slow afternoon, so we just chilled and caught up. I hadn't seen my some of my friends in a while. The waitress was really nice and attentive. She kept checking up on us even though we were just nursing our one drink each. The patio is actually rather big with many levels. We didn't have trouble finding a table as there was only one other party out there. Ended up sitting at the picnic table on the top level to the left when you enter the patio.\n\nGreat bar if you want to sit outside and enjoy a drink. Or a few if you're in the mood. If in the area, I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Elena N."}

I am a big hoops fan & especially since the Warriors have been having a historical season which makes hoops in the Bay Area exciting. I haven't owned a television in 20 years nearly as long as I have been vegan so going to see the Warriors play in the Finals at a Sports bar is a definite for me.\n\nI met some friends at Valley Tavern to watch the Warriors & the Cavs game. My friends enjoyed their beer while I had a grapefruit juice. The service here was on point. The energy was nice & the bar had several large screens for viewing the game. \n\nAnother nice addition was that Valley Tavern allows you to enjoy food from outside. One of the friends I was with had some pizza from Patxi's Pizza next door & found out that Patxi's pizza has Daiya Vegan Cheese which is awesome for those who want vegan pizza. \n\nThe game was exciting as was neck & neck the whole time yet the Warriors broke through in the final minutes led by Durant's superb performance in the clutch. He will be the Finals MVP!\n\nThe only drawback here was we were sitting right next to a smoking room & every time the door opened it was heavy w/ the smell of cigarette smoke. Definitely a time warp into back in the day before there was smoking & non-smoking sections of restaurants yet for those who smoke that could be a good thing. \n\nGo Warriors! I recommend coming here for game 4 of the Finals on Friday where the undefeated Warriors could potentially have a historical game becoming the first team in pro sports history to remain perfect in the post-season.\n\nWarriors! Warriors! Straight out of Oakland.", "author": "Shane S."}

My friend and I were exploring the area and felt it was time for a drink or two. Valley Tavern popped up on Yelp and was also the closest one. We walked in around 4:30-5 and the place was pretty empty (but by the time we left, they had a full house and a live band setting up!). The bar is super spacious, with bar seating, booths and regular tables up in the back. And what sports bar would be a sports bar without walls of TVs?\n\nThe bartender was interesting -- she was super nice, but at the same time a bit standoff ish? I'm not sure...She asked for our IDs, then walked away to help another customer. Then she'd ask us what drinks we'd want, then go close out someone's tab haha It was in no way rude, but it was weird?\n\nAnyway, I had my first Bloody Mary here. Yes, you read right. I had it with Grey Goose, medium spicy. SO GOOD! My friend got hers spicy, and loved it as well. After our cocktails, we both got a pint of beer. The bartender actually gives you samples to try! I don't see this happen too often at bars (or maybe I'm going to the wrong ones...). But that was super nice! The strawberry wheat one, not 21st Amendment, was really good. Those who don't like sweet may not like it though haha\n\nThey have a menu of all their cocktails and beers on the tables and bar counter, which is great. Prices are pretty reasonable, too.

TVs blare overhead in every direction as the bartender makes her way over to ask what you'd like. Giant Bloody Mary for $10? Or special Valley Tavern mule (in the right cup) for $6? Or, how about one of our tens of draft beers, many bottles of wine, or solid selection of spirits? I could grow to love this place, especially because the space is huge and parking is easy.

So on our bar hopping day drinking event on a hot San Francisco Saturday, Valley Tavern was my first stop.\n\nThe place is huge. Long bar, with a number of booths across from it and past it. There are two up front areas - one of which is a designated smoking section with it's own door that I thought was an interesting touch. The beer selection is actually pretty good. Not a pure craft beer bar, but they did have Almanac on tap and a number of other local craft breweries which I appreciated. The staff was also very attentive and helpful. There are pool tables somewhere, and they grab food from neighboring spots.\n\nNow for the true highlight of the bar - the backdoor patio/beer garden. Ok, first you hit this back foyer type area, which is the perfect spot if you're by yourself and want to read or get some work done and enjoy your beverage with natural light but not outside. Then you reach the three tiered back patio: \nThe bottom level has a table but is really there if you can't get higher seats. \nThe second level has 4 long wood booths. Depending on the way the sun is hitting or popularity, you might be sharing one of these.\nThe third level has one dedicated booth (which makes it feel a bit like a private VIP section) and another which was closed off that they may turn into a quick bar on popular days. \n\nThe outdoor area does close early due to noise, but the amazing Irish bartender was serving us out there.\n\nIf I'm in Noe Valley and want a great weekend day bar, Valley Tavern is it.", "author": "Michael C."}

I don't think that's me being cheap, either (I've paid $10 for German craft beers, so I'm not afraid to spend, as long as it's for a worthy product).

The Irish lady was SO nice and gave us our drinks on the house to welcome us. It was the start of a beautiful friendship. The best thing about the Valley Tavern is that when you sit outside in their fab beer garden, the cheerful ladies come out just as you're putting your empty glass down and ask you what you would like for your next drink. But the options aren't red, white or ros\u00e9 or one kind of beer. Oh no. You can have a Bloody Mary made to order with extra jalape\u00f1o and an olive, an Irish coffee, a WINE GLASS OF PROSECCO, a mimosa, a house special margarita or choose from the many beers they have on draught. They also play every sports game you would possibly want to see - and STILL COME OUT TO TAKE YOUR DRINKS ORDER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOSE YOUR SPOT. And even on the most busy of game days, they don't get pissed off if you order a Bloody Mary with extra celery. They still bring it out to you with extra celery - within 3 minutes!!! And they don't judge you for being British and getting drunk on a Sunday afternoon in the most child populated area of San Francisco.

Aside from the awesome beer garden at the back of house, VT just feels like home: a drunken and debauch home at times, but home nonetheless. Staffed by some of the friendliest bartenders in SF, this place just feels warm and inviting. Some people might disagree with me considering the front of house looks a little plain and almost draconian, but take a step inside and sit down for a while. You'd be surprised by how easily you can strike up a conversation with one of the patrons or the bartenders when he/she isn't busy. In a world full of bars populated by sleezy men or hunched drunkards, Valley Tavern is a refreshing respite: great drinks accompanied by even greater people.\n\nLet's be honest.

I had left mine at home, but about 90% of the people in there (to include my FATHER) could attest to me being over 21, since I drink with all of them. HELLO! We're there for CUPCAKES, not DRINKING. This is the CUPCAKE CROWD, not the DYL ALCOHOLIC CROWD, hence being a lack of SF Yelpers. There were hardly any damn people in there! You were so damn ubiquitous that you would have been able to catch people buying drinks for anyone who even *could* have been under 21. \n\nThen the leaves started falling all over us in a sudden wind gush, and we screamed a little. It was 3pm and you're yelling at us to keep it down because there are people living nearby? Look asshole, if you're going to live next to a BAR then prepared to stay up until the drunk idiots go home or throw up on your plants. At this point, she berates me for my damn ID again. \n\nMe: It's at home, but I'm 21. \nHer: It doesn't matter, you guys are yelling and if the cops come and they check ID's then I'm going to get in trouble\nMe: What? That's a nice crack pipe you have in your mouth.\n\nOk I didn't compliment her on that, but I'm PRETTY SURE that she was smoking SOMETHING, or PMSing because she was acting like a bitch.\n\nIf I'm going to go somewhere and drink, I'll skip this one, thanks.

The Valley Tavern is an amazing place to go after a long workday, or even a long work week.  They have SO many beers and ciders on tap that it makes those of us with decision making problems go absolutely bonkers, in a good way, of course!\n\nIn addition to the plethora of beer and ciders available, the bar also features 3-4 flat screen televisions so you can catch a glimpse of your favorite athletes battling it out, a jukebox for your music needs, and a few pool tables in the back for when you and your friends want to get a little competition going.  \n\nAny time I've visited this place I've had  no problem saddling up to the bar and ordering, but there are also tables for small parties and social gatherings if that's more your style.  The bar staff are friendly, when comparing them to other bartenders around the city, and most will sit and have a chat with you if the evening isn't too demanding.\n\nJust so you know!  The Valley Tavern does not have a kitchen so, unfortunately, ordering food from them is not an option.  They do have a carry out option where food from another restaurant can be delivered to you but I'd just eat at one of the adorable locales in Noe Valley and venture on over to the Tavern afterward.\n\nI absolutely cannot emphasize how much I love this place and hopefully I'll have an opportunity to run into some of you there!!", "author": "Kat R."}

That's right. Matthew outbid everyone for a date with moi, who he already gets to do a lot more than date with. Aaah, My Hero!\n\nI used to avoid Valley Tavern. Mostly because I'd spent more than a few nights there, being hit on by men old enough to be my dad. But Valley Tavern appears to have changed a lot in the past 4 years. The crowd is younger, the bar staff is quick and generous, and the owners are clearly saints of the highest caliber. (In addition to allowing a full Yelp takeover for fund raiser purposes, they also gave us beer specials and donated a percentage of sales for Saturday night). \n\nThere were hot boys aplenty, drink orders were filled quickly, and  the place is huge as far as neighborhood bars go. There are pool tables and lots of tvs to watch sports on, too.  On principle alone, I'll be back and I'll recommend Valley Tavern for parties, get-togethers, and afternoon drinking on the patio. \n\nThank you Valley Tavern for a memorable night.

During midweek when she felt like it, she'd just leave the house in her pajamas and roll into one of the nearby bars. That was years and years ago and I'd not been to this part of town since, so when I drove here today, the deja vu started kicking in. \n\nUpon entry you notice that the place is sectioned into many little pockets of hangouts, all with ample access to one of many tv's to view sports. There's a small cove on the right side of the doorway, the main room with the long bar to the left and booths to the right, a step up the pool tables and then outside where there are three more levels of outside patio. Today, Yelpers basically took over the outside area where Yelper Euge L. hosted an SF Foodbank Fundraiser. I had promised to man the BBQ station so I went to the very top of the patio to find a Weber coal kettle and another large gas grill waiting for me. As I started firing the two up people start drifting in and even the manager comes out to greet us. I assure her that I will try not to set the back of her bar on fire and that we'll behave for the sake of the residential neighbors behind the bar. Pretty soon  ribs, leg of lamb, trip tip, whole bbq chicken and booze is flowing and every one is having a good time. Other treats where homemade salsa/guac, pasta salad, rice crispy treats, Pastry Chef Yelper Laine L's amazing cupcakes and tons of other goodies. To top it off there's a fried chicken cookoff going down with Yelper JR H. from Selecta Auto next door allowing the participants to fry up in his shop and that food makes its way over to the Tavern too. It was funny to be running back and forth between the two place carrying tongs, knives and trays with people in the streets giving me funny/dirty looks. As the night progressed we gathered everyone inside to the pool area and various Yelpers were auctioned for the fundraiser. Amongst the World Series, Cal-ASU sports watchers, and costumed Halloween celebrators, we became one large rowdy crowd. \n\nI have to give kudos to the staff at Valley Tavern because, not only were they super cool about letting go us rampant on the place, they were some of the friendliest servers ever, and more than willing to help promote the fundraiser. Hell they even let me cook with large amounts of fire and explosive propane :)\n\nGuinness on tap (a personal favorite) as well as many other cheap tasty drinks, great staff, pretty cool patrons and laid back vibe.

Though I'll admit, this was my first legal bar & beer way back when..so I may be a bit biased. However, it has a certain comfy Noe Valley vibe to it that most friends tend to appreciate. After a long night of hopping through the Mission or Castro, I definitely sigh with relief once I've almost made it home and can enjoy the last call somewhere the crowd isn't pretentious and the bartenders are sweet & welcoming.\n\nOk, so the pool tables are a little cramped, but overall the layout of the place is great for a small neighborhood pub. The ladies bathroom is clean and rarely full of wasted girls doing who knows what. The crowd varies depending on the night, but generally Noe Valley locals tend to take the majority. *Just an FYI to those who think Noe Valley is made up entirely of \"yuppy\" moms, dads and their golden retrievers; try to look past the borders of 24th street on a weekend afternoon and you might see another picture. \n\nValley Tavern: Awesome selection of beers on tap and consistently tasty cocktails for the price.

We showed up early, at 9am, giving us a good while before the game started, and we made sure to start with the drinking there and then. More of our friends arrived and before long there were about 10 of us, all drinking beers except for one designated driver who was drinking coffee.\n\nMidway through the game I went up to the bar to order more drinks and some water for the DD. They proceeded to charge $3 for a glass of tap water. When I questioned it, the owner came over, Mr. Grumpy Money-Grabbing Irishman guy (his real name is Vincent M. Hogan according to the CA ABC website) and got all up my face. He said they couldn't have people in there on the busiest day of their year drinking for free. I explained that she was the DD, that the rest of us were drinking (and had been for a while) and that she wasn't looking for bottled water, just from the tap. I suggested that they should be encouraging DDs like many other bars, especially when they're making damn good money off all the people she's transporting to and from the bar.\n\nNow it got really unpleasant.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I'm not the aggressive fighting type so it was pretty damn surprising to be physically threatened by this obnoxious little fuckwit.

My normal style when going out for drinks is more of a laid back lounge scene.  Somewhere that has a cocktail menu along with the traditional extensive selection of beers.  It's just more my style.  Usually I hate frequenting bars or pubs where there are loads of loud sports fanatics cheering during the latest playoff, but The Valley Tavern seems to be the exception to my own rule.\n\nThe tavern looks completely divvy on the outside in my opinion, therefore making me believe that the inside would reflect their grungy outward appearance. Not true.  I was shockingly pleased with how clean and nice the inside actually was.  And there was plenty of seating besides at a bar stool!  Although decorated like your average sports bar & pub, it is done nicely which earns it points in my book.  \n\nThe drinks are generally cheap and decent, and they have a couple of pool tables and pinball machines, which add a nice addition to the place.  I do on occasion enjoy a good game of pool (even though I suck), so the pool tables definitely helped in my overall first impression.  My good friend and I got our butts kicked a few weeks back...but it was all in good fun (it was HER fault we lost).\n\nSo if you're like me, and weary (or sometimes even scared) of entering those sketchy run down hole in the wall bars, give The Valley Tavern a chance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-02-02", "description": "Update 3-07-07:  On the good side, this place has gained a bit of character by displaying local artwork.  On the downside?  It's gotten extremely young, and worse yet.....very boy-heavy.  I'm just too old for this place.   The place is infested with teeny boppers and faux surfers, and all of the older folks seem to have vanished.   It's still a decent hangout during the day...but the last five times I've been in here, I've wound up looking around and asking myself the same question: \"What the hell am I doing here?\".   \n\n(Original Review Below)\n\nMost Drinking establishments gather a culture, a scene, a crowd, or a dominant pack of regulars that pretty much sets the scene and forms an unwritten code of conduct, the likes of which govern any place of congregation.  Once things settle in, you can pretty much predict what'll be happening and who'll be around any time you visit.\n\nThe Valley Tavern is not such a place.  Despite it's location smack-dab on 24th street in Noe Valley, it has failed to garner an image that will aid in predicting what type of crowd will be hanging out at any given time.  Two owners ago, the same place played host to an extremely diverse crowd of interesting people.  But the place changed hands during the dotcom era, and the new owners subjected the \"Rat and Raven\" as it was called, to a an extensive remodel.  Out went the old wood, the worn floors, the creaky doors, and the battle scarred bar....and out went the bar's soul.  The place changed hands again about 4 years ago, and the new owner managed to undo allot of the dotcom era wretchedness that stained the place around the turn of the Milena.  Unfortunately, the character that came with decades of hard wear can't be brought back.  To it's credit, some local artwork of the surrounding area has displaced the buy-in-bulk reproduction beer advertisement decor that plauged the walls until recenty.  Sure, it's a nicely fitted place, but very little about it is distinctly San Francisco.  The entire bar could blend into the scene of any Major U.S. metropolitan area if it was yanked up with it's foundation and moved...\n\nIt's a bar that many visit, but few call home.  A small collection of middle to late-middle aged regulars tend to collect at the end of the bar farthest from the entrance, yet they make no effort to mix into the more dominant twenty-something couples and singles that begin to fill the place well after nightfall.\n\nOn the positive side, the owner's pro-active management style has been one of weeding out problem patrons such as sloppy drunks, combatitive personalities, and drug dealers.  In short, it's one of the best run bars in the neighborhood.  Peace has it's price however, as the establishment lacks any kind of \"edge\" that many city dwellers seek out.  Dueling pool tables in the back make a great place for multiple groups to mingle, and a detached smoking area that faces 24th street provides a conversation-friendly refuge from the music, which all too often is loud enough to hinder friendly chat.  A covered patio in the back makes for an even quieter oasis from the noise, and  a clear, corrugated plastic roof lets sunshine in and creates an audible pitter-patter on rainy days.  \n\nThe Valley Tavern probably gets almost half of my monthly bar tab, mainly because it's walking distance from home.  It's a got a convenient location, a good beer selection,  and it lacks an insular crowd of overbearing regulars to contend with (i.e., like the Dubliner down the street).  All in all, not a bad place....though somewhat lacking in character and local charm.  I'm considered a regular, but if I lived in another part of the city I wouldn't consider this bar a destination worthy of inter-neighborhood travel......", "author": "Mike W."}

I personally don't like getting ignored when trying to buy a drink just cause the bartendar feels like being a jerk.  Bliss bar a couple of doors down is way nicer and has better service.", "author": "Patty G."}

There is even a little smoking lounge in the front and a bigger one in back.  You can get hammered here and they still treat you with respect. This place is as unpretentious as it gets in SF.", "author": "Bethany L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-12-03", "description": "As sportsbars go The Valley Tavern, and consequently The Dubliner (same owner, same block), try very hard but fail as places to go see the \"big game\". The televisions, while plentiful, have the distinction of being roughly ten feet directly above your head, making for a very sore neck after three hours of football. In addition, the view from the seating area another twenty feet away is no better, and from there you will also have to wait a century before the waitress will arrive to take your order. For that matter I found the bartenders to be completely obnoxious when I sat at the bar. When the waitress came to take my order (at 11 am) I let her know I would need some water to rehydrate first and would then have a beer. She brought me my water. Immediately following, the second waitress behind the bar also asked me what I would like to drink. I told her the same thing. Within fifteen seconds of that conversation the owner approached me from behind the bar as well. He informed me that there was a two drink minimum and that he was \"trying to run a business\". This all took place within three minutes of my arrival. Is this really the way to treat your customers? Suprisingly, the owner decided to utilize this same setup for both of his pubs.", "author": "Doug G."}
