One of my favorites was the red licorice very fresh and chewy and very authentic tasting red licorice. I find myself traveling through San Francisco with a little extra time so I thought I would stop at Shaw's and get a taste of that old red licorice. So I called ahead to verify that they were still around and still carried red Licorice and the girl who answered assured me that yes they still sell red licorice. So I drove across town fighting with the traffic only to arrive at a tiny little candy shop. The girl behind the counter said \"yes here's are red Licorice\" ....and handed me red gum drops....\nWhen I told her that wasn't red licorice she said that's all she knew. Then said that she had black licorice and pointed at the black gumdrops....\nCongratulations on hiring the dumbest teenager in town.....\nWhat a tremendous disappointment Shaw candies of San Francisco has become......", "author": "Leather M."}

The cashier who was an old man told me he would not charge me that $180 by handwriting on the receipt. Lo and behold I receive a $180 charge on my Bank of America.  I couldn't believe the guy lied to me! I called Shaw's several times and most often it went to voice mail. I visited the place five times. The first time they took the receipt away to notify their manager. Then claimed it was never received. They later reached out to me saying they will mail me the information and receipt.

Beyond just being a West Portal institution, they've been around for over 85 years!   Kind of nice how, despite how much the city has changed over the last decade or so, some SF favorites have managed to stick around!\n\nWalking into Shaw's, I imagine what kids nowadays see is very similar to what kids that came here in the 60's and 70's saw - shelves, racks, and display cases filled with housemade fudges, jelly beans, sweets, chocolates, gummies, and candies.  Sure, their sweets aren't the cheapest, but it's hard to beat their service and selection.  Years ago, when I was dating this girl who went off to study abroad in Korea, this was just about the only place I could find that sold the chocolate covered gummy bears I was looking to buy for her care package.\n\n-- Some of their candy selection: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shaws-san-francisco-san-francisco?select=Yl-9IfLETlp1JmwI6qhimw)\n\nOddly though, despite all the enticing sweets that they sell, the real reason why I come to Shaw's is for the Mitchell's ice cream that they sell at the back of their shop.  They may not have all of the flavors to choose from, but coming here is so much easier than having to drive all of the way down to the Mission.  And when the craving strikes for a scoop of Grasshopper Pie ice cream, I don't want to have to drive that far to satisfy it!\n\n-- Grasshopper Pie: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shaws-san-francisco-san-francisco?select=yjqLsZ6vcvI69sTC6StZ1w)\n\nIn all seriousness though, Shaw's is one of those vintage SF businesses that I truly hope is able to stick around for another 85 years.  At the risk of sounding like a cranky old man, while I certainly appreciate many aspects of the City's evolution over the last several years, it'd be sad to see another longtime favorite like this fold due to inflated rents and/or get evicted.  Really, neighborhood gems like Shaw's are becoming increasingly scarce, but I'll keep coming here for my Grasshopper Pie fix for as long as their doors stay open!", "author": "Mike L."}

Popular, fun boxed candies are for sale in addition to purchasing candies & chocolates by the pound.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I picked up some chocolate covered gummy bears, as well as some sour chewies and his favorite fudge.

I'm giving this a 3 star review because of the horrible service given by the young blonde girl this evening. Firstly, she made 2 groups of us wait 3-5 minutes bc she had cleaned the floors (it was about 8:15pm and they close at 10pm. She probably started cleaning to get out sooner not expecting the rush of people). There was a family of 6 in front of us and she was as rude to them as us, and those behind us. She said they only take cash, which is not true. She even said \"go outside to the atm at the bank and get cash\". When asked if they don't have a machine, said yes they do but it's slow! She was soooooo lazy!!!! The machine was at the front of the store and she didn't want to walk back and forth but felt it was ok to tell customers to leave the store, get cash and come back. She also hesitated to give a receipt. What the heck?? I would definitely go back for the ice cream but note to the owners: that girls needs to be fired!!

That said, I'm really having trouble lately in finding any redeeming qualities in what should be a local gem of a candy shop. I also am sure it's quite difficult to run a small business these days, hence the hefty price on their bulk candy. So here's what I got last time- two very small, sadly wrapped bags of candy and a melted junior cone for $18. $18!!!! There must have been a misunderstanding, because there's no way the candy could be that expensive.

I had planned to get something crazy and only had my card. Even though they had no minimum purchase, I felt bad and bought another (very efficiently selected) $12 in mini truffles but it was so hard to accomplish because the bored/mad teenager working today was so bothered at having to help us, she kept mouthing \"sorry\" over us at her friend who was waiting to visit. I'm sure it's impossible to find people who aren't completely insane criminals for minimum wage but maybe try harder? \n\nI hate complaining on yelp without first contacting the business directly but they have no info listed and no website. People in cities have literally no reason to go to brick and mortar stores except to have a positive/special/not horrible experience.

When I found out Shaw's carried mitchell's ice cream, and I could get my fix without the hour long line, I was excited. But I wondered why the store was empty, when Mitchell's is always packed. The same product, so I thought, why not?\nIf it seems too good to be true, it is...the ice cream was delivered days ago so it was not nearly as fresh as the one at Mitchell's. It was half melted and had pieces of ice in it, gross! Plus the waffle cone that was also delivered days ago was completely stale. I asked for another but every single one was stale as though it were weeks old. So she had to give me a sugar cone but the ice cream was so melty that it spilled out.

I went in a month and a half ago to browse their selection which is pretty nonexistent at this point. Other than the few candies that seem to be made in house, they have barely any stock on their shelves and what is on the shelves is obviously old. While this sparse selection was alarming I still spoke with a sales representative and placed an order for some 50s decade candies to pick up eventually. He wrote my order on a paper bag and took my name and number, telling me the owner would get back to me soon. I am glad I took a card with me as I did not hear from anyone for two weeks. I then decided to call the number on the card for the owner Marissa Dhillon. It took me to the establishment where a female rep told me the owner was not in and that she would have her call me when she arrived. I called when they opened, waited till 4pm and called again. I was told the owner wasn't in; now this being for my mothers 50th birthday event and something that's time sensitive I insisted that she get in touch with the owner and have her call me. To my surprise I did get a call from the owner about 20min later. At this point, the owner assured me she could fulfill my order and even offered to bag them nicely for me. I agreed and later asked for an example of past bags or a preview of the ones she would prepare for me. She explained she did not have past examples, but said she would send along a picture of the ones she would have for me. I have not heard from her since, the party is in 10 days, and so I decided to let her know that I would handle the bags myself and thanked her for the time and effort she put in so far. No response to that either... For such a quintessential candy shop of SF I was hoping for far better service and professionalism. You can do much better Shaw's.", "author": "Kiva M."}

At 6:30 pm last night, I took my two boys for an after dinner treat.  As curious children go, my son pulled open the lever on a jelly bean dispenser before I could place a bag underneath.  The woman behind the counter (apparently the owner) began yelling, \"Do not touch that again!!\" I explained that it was an accident and asked her to please calm down.  While on the floor cleaning up the small handful of jelly beans she continued to yell, \"those are all garbage now and we are not going to be able to sell them!\"  My 2 year old son began to scream at this point, clinging to me and grabbing at my hair.  My 2 year old is on the autism spectrum and became very dysregulated as a result of this woman's rage.  While on the ground with now two distressed children (my 5 year old also in tears), I locked eyes with her and asked her to \"calm herself because it's not a big deal.\"  When she continued to have words with me, I stated, \"You can obviously see I'm struggling.\" \nI quickly poured some jelly beans in a bag and turned to the counter.  Prepared to make reparations, I pulled out a $20 bill, handed it to her stating, \"go ahead and charge me an extra $5 or $10 dollars for the spillage.\"  It was less than 50 cents worth of jelly beans.  I was prepared to give her $20 and call it.  She then told me she wasn't going to sell me anything and to get out of her store.  She threatened to contact the police and grabbed the phone. I tossed the jellies on the counter...a small plastic spoon tipped over ( I think) and we left.  To be fair, I called her a name on the way out. \nI got my boys safely in the car.  It took a while to get my 2 year old calm.  This was supposed to be fun.  My 5 year old felt awful for spilling jelly beans.  I assured him he did nothing wrong (that he is a child and still learning).  I pulled around to the front of the store and waited a few minutes for the police to show in order to explain what really happened (and to reassure my children).  We left after a few minutes. \n\nThis afternoon, I contacted Shaw's and asked to speak to the owner.  The woman from the previous night identified herself as the owner.  I stated who I was and attempted to explain.  She immediately started yelling again, threatening me and stated that the police were \"looking for me\".  She hung up in a rage.  \nI contacted Taraval station and spoke with one of the officers on duty.  He provided me with the CAN number as well as the names of the officers that came out.   I explained the situation in detail.  The officer explained that a report wasn't even made and that the owner was making \"idle threats\".  He did say that police responded to the call (as obligated), stayed a few minutes and wrote one simple note, \"verbal dispute\". The officer was kind and apologetic for the way my children and I were treated.  I offered to give him my name and number but he didn't feel this was necessary. \nAs a member of several parent groups and Autism Speaks, I plan to inform all parents that Shaw's is not child friendly.  Nobody deserves this kind of treatment.  There are too many wonderful, accepting businesses in the bay area to ever have to step foot in this sad establishment.\n\nA side note** If you scroll through most bad reviews, the primary complains are regarding the terrible service and most parents seem to echo what I've said.

You can probably have a complete retro-50's dining experience by eating at Manor Coffee Shop and then getting some ice cream at Shaw's where you're likely to see Wally and Eddie hanging out when Mrs. Cleaver suddenly walks in with the Beaver... Eddie: \"Wally, if your dumb brother tags along, I'm gonna - oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Cleaver. I was just telling Wallace how pleasant it would be for Theodore to accompany us to the movies.\"\n\nShaw's actually takes me back to my childhood in San Mateo where it was a big treat to go Shaw's on El Camino Real for their ice cream. I think the candy-strip awning is still the same, but the chain was sold years ago. This may be the last one left, and whoever owns the place is smart enough to serve Mitchell's ice cream. Jamie W. and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon, thrilled that it was open since it closes its door at 6PM. I went with a small $3.50 cup of Pineapple Coconut (see photo) and promptly sat down on the solitary bench in front. Chocolate turtles - their signature confection - were in sparse numbers in the display case. Bummer.\n\nICE CREAM - 4 stars...it's Mitchell's, no-brainer\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...retro vibe in the Wayback Machine\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...chipper\nTOTAL - 4 stars...\"That's a lovely string of pearls, Mrs. Cleaver.\"", "author": "Ed U."}

I was there on 5/27/16 from 2pm-3:30pm and the young girl working there was incredibly rude to my two year old for spilling no more than 10-15 jellybeans. She yelled at her as if she was some military Sargent. I'd already gone and told her to stop doing that and grabbed her by the hand and brought her closer to me by the line away from the jellybeans. She started to cry because she was so scared and there was a big group of people in there. I understand that it's her job to check the customers if they are doing something wrong (which I know my daughter shouldn't have done that) but did she really have to yell \"COULD YOU STOP?? JUST STOP! STOP!\" to a 2 year old?? And then roll her eyes at her and torn around with the biggest sigh as she was having an asthma attack. Then, when she finally took my i e cream order she said \"you know what mam, I talk to all the kids and adults the same way\". Really??? How the hell is she still working there. It's an ice cream shop where kids go and maybe she should go work at a library. I told her that it wasn't the first time she was rude to us and her response was \"that's not true. I've never seen you before\". Then continued to roll her eyes and sigh some more. I called today and talked to the manager and it really didn't sound like she gave a crap. She sounded like she was trying to just rush the convo and end the call. She did offer is free cones for our next visit but after going there for over 4 years and my husband since he was a teenager we will not be going there again.

Ube, purple yam, is one of those flavored at my favorite candy store, shaws. \n\nUbe is a classic flavor at shaws. The candy shop now has anything you could want. I suggest not going there from 2:30 - 3:30 because all the students after school go there. My personal favorite ice cream is the ube and the grasshopper pie. They give many different sizes of cones and they just came out with a mini mini cone which is great for kids. \n\nShaws has now brought cotton candy, kettle corn, and a frozen drink makers into their store. I've only had the cotton candy which was delicious, but not as well formed as the ones you buy at the store or zoo. I've heard great things about the kettle corn, but I've never seen someone get a frozen drink. If you ever get cotton candy, I highly suggest the pi\u00f1a colada flavor.\n\nThe candy that they sell is old and new. They have my personal favorite throwback candy, Razzles, and the more modern candies like Reece's. They also have candy cigarettes and gum cigarettes. The candy cigarettes aren't that good, but the gym cigarettes are delicious. They have many flavor of jelly beans and many different pez heads. They also have action figures, lunch boxes, and pillows that have something to do with candy. They have many different fudge flavors such as rocky road and cookies and cream. They will name one fudge the \"Fudge of the Month\". I've personally never seen someone buy fudge, but the pieces get smaller and smaller each time I go. \n\nOver all, this candy shop is great for people of all ages and a great desert place if you go to a restaurant near by.", "author": "Doon B."}

It makes a mockery of candy shops.  First of all, the candy is unappetizing.  I could tolerate that if the place weren't so unwelcoming to children.  The proprietor watched my kids like they were animals who were preying on her precious candy.  I don't know if she felt they were going to steal something or make a mess, but her evil eye was making me anxious.  She then yelled at one of my kids when he accidentally spilled a few pieces of candy on the ground.  She is clearly more interested in the cost of her candy than serving the children the store was originally opened to serve.

DAMN YOU COLD!!!\n\nAnywho, I just went with a junior scoop of Ube on a sugar cone since thats my usual Mitchells flavor and I knew my tummy would enjoy it even if my mouth and brain couldn't.  Well, it wasn't a junior scoop. It was more of a blob. A glob of Ube flubber if you will. The old lady that came in looked at my ice cream and said \"ooo.. thats pretty.\" Im sure she was talking about the gorgeously bright purple hue and not the scoop itself.\n\nI licked and nibbled my way down to the sugar cone. It had a white wrapper on the outside so I started tearing it like foil on a burrito. I get down to the tip and find GLUE DIRECTLY ON MY CONE!!! GROSS!!! The whole wrapper was glued onto the cone on the bottom!!! I know I can't taste anything and probably wouldn't be able to taste glue on my cone.. thinking only that that one bite was a little chewier than others, but I'm sure little kids wouldn't have noticed and would have gobbled it right up. Tell me it was edible non-toxic glue?? UNACCEPTABLE!!!", "author": "Angela W."}

I walked into Shaw's hoping to find exciting, unique candies & found none. Sure they have gummy worms & some salt water taffy (the old stand bys) but nothing too \"boutique-y.\" \n\nI settled for chocolate (yes, I prefer candy over chocolate.) Eyeing my options (fudge, gorgeous truffles, Mitchell's ice cream, etc) I picked three filled milk chocolates: maple, lemon & strawberry. Not too impressive, similar to the chocolates you find in a generic Valentine's Day heart shaped box from the drug store. At least the price was right ($2 for my three pieces. Their chocolates are $15.95/lb.)\n\nShaw's is old school. Nothing is shiny or new, nothing is colorful, nothing is lively. I'm sure Shaw's has a special place in the hearts of people who grew up eating their sweets, but it did nothing to tug at my heart strings. \n\nThe Filipino couples running the store were extremely personable.

They now have Mitchells Ice Cream which is great as I love close to Shaw's but far from the actual Mitchells Ice Cream store. The only bad thing is that a lot of their candy is over priced... I think many of it you can find at the corner store or even Walgreens for a lot cheaper HOWEVER I will say you must get their chocolate covered gummy bears as you can't find them at most places but beware it's about $11 a pound but sooooooo worth it.

One-The prices of the candy are not labeled so make sure you ask because even though they have only a small amount to choose from, the prices per pound vary up to  a $2.00  difference. ($8.95-10.95.) Second- The woman that waited on us said she\"gave\" me more than a pound amounting to $11.95. I asked her to put it back because I only wanted a pound and she had not asked me. It was only on inquiring that I found out about the differences in prices, it was not volunteered. The extra dollar added to my purchase without consent bugged me enough that I will probably not go back.", "author": "Janet H."}

First, much of their stuff is clearly not made by them, they buy it in bulk and then mark it up. Second, the prices were out of this world. $10.00 for a small chocolate bunny? $7.00 for a small bag of jelly bellies? Simply not worth it.", "author": "LH N."}
