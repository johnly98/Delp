The prices are affordable if you opt for the \"regular\" burrito. If you upgrade and get the \"grande\" the price increases substantially.

I never had chile relleno in a burrito so that was a very interesting touch. I would recommend it to anyone! \n\nThis place is so tiny and cute, and most of all, it feels authentic!

The reason I was surprised about the service  is because the place actually uses grills rather than steam pots that keep the food warm. I think it's pretty great, because every single person who orders is getting fresh meat straight off the grill, rather than food that's been sitting there for a while. Also, despite numerous people waiting for their order at a time, the owner never feels pressured or rushed and always converses with the people there.\n\nThe food itself was NOT bad at all. I would say that it was average. My definition of average is probably different than others as someone who has ate at many, many burrito places in the past. I've definitely had amazing burrito's far above average in the Mission, so if I'm not doing a comparison and being less picky, I would definitely bump this review to a 4 star, as the place itself is pretty good and worth a try.\n\nHighly recommend this place is you are craving Mexican on a work day and are in the area.", "author": "Alex B."}

Tamales are extremely dry, and come with a small (think tiny dipping sauce) container of black beans instead of salsa, and was not worth eating. Shrimp burritos are okay, but definitely far from the best in town - part of this may be because they seem to microwave the shrimp instead of freshly cook it.

The menu is pretty standard Mexican food with nothing fancy. I decided to go with an order of nachos and added shredded chicken. It's kind of different how they do the nachos here, but I like it.

They are always cleaning the food and counter areas to the point where they don't even need to. If the health department had a problem with them using a bathroom sink --- trust me, they'd be shut down in a heartbeat. You can view a list of EVERY restaurant in SF's health records by going on to the dept. of health's website and restaurant database. There are PLENTY of expensive restaurants that do way worse than use a bathroom sink to clean their dishes... and all you have to do is research! Fine dining don't mean the kitchen is safe, ya'll! Just remember: your dollars don't go toward cleaning or health requirements or making sure the kitchen staff isn't licking their fingers to try a soup or washing their hands after they pee :-)\n\nEnough about that. On to the food:\n\nLa Canasta is the best cheap Mexican in the Cow Hollow/Marina area and the portions are glorious considering the prices. They are so friendly and pretty efficient considering the phone is ringing off the hook non-stop. So if you're far away from the Mission and you're looking for a quick Mexican fix, head on by.

The meat is freshly grilled per order over open flame.\n\nThe carne asada is simply awesome, way better than the \"cook in a 20lb batch, chop to bits, and let sit forever in a steam table until the next batch\" system of every other place.\n\n2. The salsa, guacamole and the hot sauce have interesting flavors I've not experienced before, and they form a flavorific synergy.\n\n3. When I ask for a HOT burrito, they can deliver.\n\nMost every place's hot sauce is a joke, but they have habanero sauce such that my burrito can be burning lips, \"gimme the milk now!\", warm esophagus, warm intestines, and then the next day, fire in the hole.\n\nOther places that rely on Serranos or Jalapenos for heat never achieve that warm, lingering, mouth-filling heat, and have to use so much of those blandly flavored chilis that the pico de gallo suffers, as does mouth feel. Too much quick concentrated heat that overpowers the flavors of the food.\n\nHere's what I always order if you'd like to try it: Regular grilled steak burrito with guacamole, hot sauce and a bit of habanero. The super adds cheese and sour cream, neither of which adds anything. Both are bland and dilute flavor, the cheese a bit sour.\n\n\nThe low ratings here surprise me, everyone I've brought here has thought it awesome, but it seems the bad reviews often mention delivery.

It's time to actually walk off some of our food, so I can then begin to consume dinner relatively guilt-free.\n\nBut I don't feel guilty when I get my mexican food fix at La Canasta. After the ridiculously accomodating staff takes my high maintenance burrito order (no rice, no sourcream, extra beans, extra cheese,ect ect) I eat in peace at home. The homemade salsa is fresh, flavorful, chunky and spicy. It stands alone, which you can't always say for salsa. Their veggies are fresh, their meat tender and not overcooked, and no lard, no crappy ingredients. Fresh, delicious, relatively healthy mexican food (if you consider burritos healthy like me) and right in the marina hood.\n\nAnd by the way, the kitchen is CLEAN. I was impressed, and the ladies working that evening were meticulous about food placement, burrito creation, and packing your messy to go order, so that it didn't get all over your pants in the car, or drip down your leg while walking with the order. \n\nNo real wait, as it's a togo only place, so you can call it in and hike to go get it.

I had a few dollars on me, so I needed something quick to fuel me, but I wasn't down for something bad for the arteries. La Canasta showed up like a quick solution for my dilemma.\nBefore I walked in, I had a feeling it was gonna be good because of the number of people hanging around outside. I walk in and the elder gentleman behind the counter takes his time taking my order as he is focusing on his customer before me. I respect that. So he greets me with a big smile and I am immediately feeling a \"grandparent\" feeling from him. I like him. I order a camerones taco, a shrimp taco, extra hot. He smiles when I tell him extra hot.\nI wait for my order with my elbows on the counter watching the two ladies preparing other orders before mine. As I watch them, I observe how they delicately prepare the food, not rushing like I've seen other small places like this rush to keep up with the customers. It's like they have their own small world behind the counter, respecting the food they prepare. I watch the gentleman behind the counter carefully bagging up the boxes and I can't help but feel that the people here not only run a business, but respect the food the business depends on, despite the crazy rush of people coming in. I sort of panic because I'm just wondering when my inky dink taco is gonna get bagged. No worries, grandpa takes care of it right away. Though he wasn't paying attention to me, he remembered me and bagged my order and gave it to me while still talking to the people waiting for their stuff. I have to give this place props because their service was absolutely classy.\nThe food. My order. Heaven. That \"inky dink\" taco I waited for was definitely not inky dink in taste or in size. The salsa that was made was so fresh, you can taste all the flavors come together. They didn't skimp on the shrimp either. Every bite had shrimp in it. Gotta give it to them.

Someone who complains that the owner's English is poor, and doesn't use an upper case \"E\" is not trustworthy. Alberto speaks impeccably, and Lily, a stunning & refined lady, speaks just as well, but with a bit more accent.\n\nTo the guy who commented that La Canasta doesn't compare with the Mission? Perhaps he needs to consider that Mexico is a huge country, and has regional dialects and foods, just as we do in the United States.  The owners come from Puebla, a  highlands region south of Mexico City. The food is lighter.  To further illustrate, consider New York versus Chicago style pizza. Both species are available in San Francisco. Then go to Italy, and order pizza from a small outdoor cafe in a hidden piazza. Now you have some experience upon which to draw a good comparative study. \n\nTo most people in California, \"Mexican Food\" means food from Northern Baja.  It's heavier, greasier and cow-centric. La Canasta is not for you if you have Baja in mind. That is not their fault.  Don't bash them because you haven't bothered to learn culinary dialects.\n\nLa Canasta is special to those of us who live in Cow Hollow-Marina-Pac Hts.  Fresh, wholesome and made to order. No lard. Food made with love that fills stomach and soul.  My first choice always. Good value for the price and you needn't feel guilty feeding their food to your kids.\n\nLily and Alberto are two of the kindest  people in Cow Hollow. When my eldest son was a  baby,  Lily would grab him, and send me out for a walk. I needed that!  She sat him on her hip and fed him guacamole by the spoonful!   Both boys are grown and healthy; must have been all that vitamin A!\n\nOne more thing.  Waiting for something sure is a pain.  But we all have to expect that we will find ourselves waiting for something or someone, right?  (Say, nine months for a baby.  Or waiting for that baby to, albeit a bit mournfully, to grow from  toddler into a Little Gator and looking outward now. Or waiting for your son to come home from his first semester at university?)

Some of my buddies and I had heard of these mythical places.  They served something called...burritos.  We wondered what burritos were.   What were these strange things from the land beyond Tejas, Arizona, and California.  (Diversity where I grew up and attended school meant you didn't celebrate Columbus Day or St. Patrick's Day.)  We began wolfing these strange and wonderful foodstuffs down.  Better yet, they were open late.  For the first time in my life I was confronted with what the hell \"refried\" meant.  (As Mitch Hedberg once said, \"I like refried beans, but maybe fried beans are just as good and we're just wasting time.)\n\nFlash forward to the summer of '99 and my arrival in the Golden State.  I learned a new lesson.  Taco Bell sucked.  You could go elsewhere for the magical burrito.  And there were lots of places to buy them.  Wow.  I can get fat at a variety of establishments.  Wonderful.  I then learned that the best place to get burritos was in the Mission.  However, whenever I ventured into the Mission I got dirty looks from people.  These people wore black, had pierced parts of their bodies that I did not know could be pierced, and seemed to hate clothing that has either a collar or buttons...or heaven forbid....BOTH.  I was told that these are hipsters.  They are cooler than you, hate your madras shorts and collared shirts, and don't want you in the Mission.\n\nThat's where La Canasta saved me.  This is exactly the kind of Mexican take out joint that prevails in the Mission.  Except there aren't a line of pretentious hipsters inside giving you dirty looks because own a razor and wash on a regular basis.  Most importantly it is in a great location and I can walk down the hill to get there.  \n\nThe portions are awesome.  Sometimes too big to finish.  (Who am I kidding...I always finish their burritos.  Just ask my tailor.)  The ingredients are in good proportion to one another.  The shrimp burrito is excellent.  Probably because they put more than two of those little critters in there.  I wish they gave you some complimentary chips, but then my tailor would be apoplectic.  (I can't take out these pants anymore!!!  Lose some weight instead!)  \n\nMy only complaints are that I wish they stayed open a little later and were a little speedier.  The ordering area is a little tight as well.  Another reason to pass on the chips.  I might not fit in there otherwise.", "author": "Chris I."}

I could walk to Chestnut, but dealing with Marina folk tires me out too much. That, and I'm lazy.\n\nI usually switch between burritos, tacos, or the chicken tortilla soup. All the meat is really good, but I usually get the carnitas (good thing my boyfriend isn't kosher). My co-worker gets the enchiladas all the time, but I wasn't that impressed with them.\n\nLet me just say something about the soup: it was really, really weird at first. The broth is red, which I was not expecting. The first sip has a tomato-y taste. I thought, 'Great. Thanks, coworkers. This shit sucks.' But then, the next thing I knew, it was five days in a row later of chicken tortilla soup for lunch. The tortillas in the soup are THE BEST I've ever had. They're not stringy or gargantuan strips of tortilla chips...they're just the perfect size so that you can eat them in one bite, and so that they end up just the right amount of soggy by the time you eat your soup.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is their guacamole, salsas, and Mexican wedding cakes.\n\nI always spend no more than $6-7 (because I always tip them at least $1), and end up really full.\n\nI love the owner (the old man). He's so friendly; I want to adopt him as my Abuelo. (I'm not Mexican). He always remembers things we talked about last time. His wife is not as friendly, but I presume this is because her English is not that great. I should mention though that almost every time she helps me, my order gets a little tweaked or takes longer than it should. (I think she works the later shift).\n\nIt is a REALLY small space. My bathroom is bigger than this place. Sometimes it's hard to figure out who's waiting for food, and who's waiting to order. They have a makeshift wrap-around bench outside, and there are two other benches, though I'm not sure if they belong to Canasta or Jamba (it's right next door). I would hardly consider that outside seating, since anything as messy as a burrito or taco shouldn't really be eaten over your lap.\n\nI never think about what goes on behind the scenes in a restaurant; if washing dishes in the bathroom sink is what you're worried about, you probably just shouldn't eat out (I can attest to the many entries about the [un]sanitary levels in restaurants, having worked in many dining establishments before). I once worked at a restaurant where we served a bagel that had fallen onto the floor to a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL. \n\nBut the two big cons: the size and sanitary issue...aren't these part of the charm of hole-in-the-wall ethnic eateries anyway?", "author": "Sachi T."}

There are a lot of positive reviews listed here, but I'd argue that the 'Canasty' is completely overrated simply because of its location.  I've eaten their burritos several times because its so convenient, but generally the food is really bland and serves as little more than filler.  I'd like to mix up my orders and try something new, but their menu is extremely limited.  Plus they close sort of early.  Somebody ought to open another take-out autentica Taq.Cancun-style Mexi place in the Cow Hollow area and give them a real run for their money.

Compared to Taqueria Cancun, La Canasta's carne asada and grilled chicken are consistently overcooked,  the beans are mealy, much of the rice included in the burrito tastes like was stuck to the sides of the warming tray for a while, the guacamole doesn't taste fresh, and the spicy salsa is anything but.

I would so much rather drive all the way over to the Marina district then try my fate at almost any of the taquerias in the Mission (exception: Papalote).  First off they grill their meats to order, not in bulk to wither in bins for hours.  There's no grease, just chicken or steak and grill.  They use breast meat rather than whatever they can scrape off a chicken (which usually includes bones and cartilage at other tqrias).  You can blindfold yourself and try anything on the menu as all is delicious and won't leave you wondering what hit you in the stomach an hour later.  I'm particularly fond of the enchiladas, tacos and burritos.  For the people that complain about costs, I can only say you get what you pay for.  If you are not finicky about the quality of the food you eat, by all means save the $2 and head to the Mission; but if you're like me and don't want to gag on semi-warm, haphazardly cleaned, second-grade meat, for the love of Mexican food, eat here.

Next time I plan to try their chile relleno and will test out the veggie burrito which will be real soon I'm sure.  They even have a veggie torta.  I would recommend La Canasta without a doubt. They've been in business for years and it shows.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

I have to agree with alot of the other reviewers in that the people behind the counter are extraordinarily friendly.  The food however isn't the greatest.  So far the fajita steak burrito is the only one i would say is above average (had it w/ everything plus extra spicy).  The chicken and carnitas burritos were very forgettable, and borderline unenjoyable.", "author": "Ethan K."}

Awsome burritos and nice service.  They tend to get busy at lunchtime but that is only because this place is so good.", "author": "Les L."}

The Marina lacks this simple and wonderful convenience.  After 3 months of living here and trying to convince myself that La Canasta is decent, I have officially given up.  The food is bland, the place is not clean, and the staff doesn't seem to really care much.  Sometimes I get pinto beans, sometimes refried beans - but NEVER do they ask for your preference.  They do ask if you want hot sauce - and I always say yes - but I have yet to taste it.  The clincher came yesterday when I found a mysterious hard object in my burrtio.  Kind of like a miniature peach pit.  Gross.  I really wish this place was just decent, but no dice.", "author": "Green T."}

I tried to convince her to at least try Papolotte, but noooooo.  So, I figure, what the hell.  I'm a veggie, so I check out their menu, black beans, that's good and two choices.  The vegetariano and the garden veggie.  I opt for the g.v. and after a LENGTHY wait (in fact, my friend's food was sitting there for five to ten minutes before my burrito was done) I got the WORSE BURRITO I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  It was BLAND black beans, blander rice and the blandest veggies ever.  NO SALSA, DRY to the bone and tasteless.  The tortilla was sticky, gummy steamed, not grilled crispy.  Holy Christ, what a fucking waste.  And, to top it off, my friend was bitching  about how bad her taco and salad were.  How the fuck do you fuck up a salad?  Oh, and to top it off, they forgot to give me my change.  Ah, yeah, I don't think I will be back there UNLESS I get alzheimers.", "author": "AJ L."}
