I also liked the rice and beans, but unfortunately it was cold. I'm not sure if that was intended or someone in the kitchen made a booboo. Also there was little rice and bean. After three bites, my rice and beans were all gone. Very small proportion for the rice and bean. Service was great, quick and friendly. \n\nCheck out my picture...", "author": "Anita T."}

Unfortunately, we won't be back.\n\nThe service was very attentive most of the night. There never seemed to be one dedicated server per table, which was a bit confusing, and led to our dinner plates sitting in front of us for a while at the end. However, everyone was friendly and helpful.\n\nThe food was not fresh and overcooked. The guac came out within two minutes of ordering it so clearly not freshly made, despite the bowls of avocados sitting out on top of the bar. The tostadas were like cardboard pucks; stale with zero flavor. I had the enchilada verde, which was fine but not great. The chicken was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the pork which was borderline inedible. Way overcooked and super dry. I tried to save the meal by ordering churros for dessert. They came out burnt. \n\nVery disappointing all around.", "author": "Erica G."}

I came here on a Saturday evening, about 7 pm, and this place was practically empty. I was promptly seated upon my arrival, which I was very pleased with. I started my dinner off with a nice simple house margarita, which was pretty tasty. I ordered some chips and salsa, as I was super hungry, and needed something to quiet my stomach as I awaited my meal. For my entree, I ordered the Pollo Regalito (1/2 chicken), which came with a few tortillas, rice, and beans. The tortillas served were so delicious and fluffy; you can tell they used fresh ingredients to make their tortillas. After a few bites, I was stuffed. You definitely get your money's worth here! I highly recommend stopping by this place, if you are in the area. Very great experience.", "author": "Alexus S."}

It is a very discrete building in the  mission, grey with yellow accents and very contemporary symbols. It has two, two seaters outside and bright yellow/lime doors. The best part of coming in was one, escaping the cold, but the attendants were so accommodating and happy. They also got along really well and kept the restaurant going. The menu is pretty limited, which is nice. It had a nice selection of entrees, including vegetarian options. The wine selection was surprisingly extensive, given that their menu was not.the dessert list was limited to 4-5 but they all sounded delicious.\n\nAs an appetizer we got the papas con chorizo. This plate was so good and such a good starter plate. The best way to describe it is an ounce or two of chorizo cradled by a bed of crispy roasted potatoes and topped by crema and pico. Make sure to ask for hot sauce. IT IS SO HOT! But it does bring some nice notes on the chorizo and potato seasoning. I had a super burrito as my main entry. This just means crema and abocado are added to the normal burrito. The torilla was perfect! Extremely thin an crisp. The chicken was nicely seasoned and the rise was not overpowering. The slices of avocado gave it a very fresh taste that was accentuated by the cream. My friends ordered the chiles verdes and the tinga de pollo. I am not of fan of stewy plates but the ting was actually very refreshing. The chiles verdes were so good! I was impressed by the presentation and the balance between all the elements.", "author": "Emmanuel T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-18", "description": "Last year before I left my office permanently after 40+ years of working for the State of California, my co-workers gave me a farewell luncheon, many wonderful gifts, written kind words (to the point of humbling me and bringing tears of happiness to my eyes) and a Groupon coupon for Regalito Rosticeria.  It was dinner for two for my husband and me to enjoy.  I have never used a Groupon coupon before and this was my first time.\n\nBefore I continue writing this review, I want to especially thank Lionel (my co-worker) who suggested this restaurant.  I wasn't too sure if I wanted to be in the Mission district in the late evening.  There was that certain fear and worry about the Mission being as dangerous as Downtown Oakland/Broadway.  It was not at the time, and shame on me for holding such a stereotypical view.\n\nOur reservation was for 6:30, and we arrived at 6:15.  Parking was not easy because the streets were filled with parked cars, but we found a spot on 19th Street (close to Mission Street).  \n\nErnesto, our waiter, explained (as stated on the coupon) that for $30.00 we could order one appetizer, two dinner entrees and one dessert.  Beverages are extra and not included.\n\nAppetizer:  4 Taquitos filled with chicken and topped with queso, crema and cilantro.  I was warned that the salsa was very spicy and it was (for me, muy caliente).  My husband enjoyed them with the salsa and lime.  4 stars\n\nEntree #1:  Tinga pollo with chipotle sauce and avocado salsa.  Accompaniment - seasoned Mexican rice.  Husband said it was delish.  5 stars\n\nEntree #2:  Enchiladas Verdes - three corn tortillas dipped in salsa verde and chicken, garnished with crema, queso fresco and onions (ceballos).  Accompaniment - whole pinto beans.  I was impressed with my choice.  The free-range chicken was fresh and the pinto beans cooked to perfection...not undercooked and not mushy.  5 stars\n\nThe warm thick corn tortillas were wonderful.  Forget the ones that I buy in a pack from the supermarket.  \n\nAgua fresca:  Jamaica...tasty and refreshing...delicate hibiscus flavor...not artificial.  4 stars\n\nDessert:  The choices were flan, churros with Mexican hot chocolate or torta de tres leches with strawberries.  I wanted the sponge cake with strawberries, but they were out.  I opted for the flan, and the two waiters who served us comped us with churros and Mexican hot chocolate.  The flan was not overly sweet and they did not drown the flan with caramel sugar.  The churros were absolutely the \"bomb\" - freshly prepared and the aroma of cinnamon still in the air.  They were heavenly, dipped in the cocoa and eaten with the flan.  My husband usually does not eat dessert, but this was something special that we both enjoyed.  5 stars\n\nThe ambiance was quite charming and we definitely will be back to dine here again.  The service may be a tad slow, but one has to remember that preparation of food of high quality does take time and IMO I believe Regalito aims to please the customers and do things all the way right.  Patience is a virtue; and what's worth waiting is worth getting and that's exactly what we received.", "author": "Carol C."}

The ambiance us that of a family style atmosphere.  We were warmly greeted and the staff (especially Edwardo) were very nice and catered to all of our various requests.\n\nWe ordered a family style service where we were allowed to choose three main dishes that would be served to the group.  We went with the pozole, chicken mole, and carne tacos.   Let me say, they did not disappoint!   The chef created amazing dishes, they were unique but not crazy different like you wouldn't recognize.  The flavors were truly authentic and very delicious!   The side dishes to complement were also very well done.  The portions were perfect, enough to leave satisfied, but not overwhelming.\n\nThe prices are a bit on the higher end, but well worth it if you are looking for a quality dinner.

The tortillas were thick and had a good slightly rough/grainy texture, but once again if I'm being picky, they were a bit hard. The pork had a good taste but for something that's slow roasted, it really should've fallen apart easily under my fork and been much softer. \n\n* Enchiladas Verdes - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/regalito-rosticeria-san-francisco?select=7e83iijpB-J7YzpvgI5fOw#QvCEkeB_mr6moPS-FzdNBA\n(Handmade corn tortillas dipped in a tomatillo and green chile sauce filled with roast chicken, garnished w/ queso fresco, crema, onions & cilantro, served w/ rice & beans. $17)\nThe rice & beans that came on the side were awesome.

I found parking a blocks away and we walked back.\n\nWhen we went in we thought maybe they weren't open because no one was in there at 2:30 in the afternoon. \n\nShe ordered the pozole and I got the enchiladas verdes. Both were excellent.  The Pozole was spicy and flavorful. We compared it to a Pozole made by some family friends and think this was definitely spicier and better.  The enchaladas were also very good and flavorful.  My only issue was that there was quite a bit of sauce on them - I though a little too much.  The beans and rice on the side were also good.  And they supplied a small bowl of habanero salsa if you wanted even more spice (it definitely had a lick to it).  We like it spicy and this met our expectations.\n\nWe sat at the counter so we could watch as the prepped for dinner service.   and service was immediate - almost too fast, one minute after getting the menus they were asking us if we were ready to order..  The staff was friendly and courteous - and when we complimented the chef on the Pozole and asked about the recipe, he said he would give it to us the next time we were in.\n\nIt was definitely worth the stop and will be back, though with their prices it won't be too often.", "author": "Jeff H."}

I tried once before to eat here, sitting outside with my dog for 10 minutes and nobody ever came out to check on me, so I left. I tried again today and honestly, I wish I hadn't. Since I was on my lunch, I had a timer going so I knew when to head back to work. It took 12 minutes after I sat down before the hostess came over to take my order. Once I ordered, it took nearly 20 minutes to get my meal. The place wasn't so crowded as to justify such a long wait for my food. \n\nTaste wise, the food was pretty good. I ordered the guac and tostadas and some enchiladas verdes and just had water to drink. The tostadas were nicely crispy and thick and the guac was made fresh to order. The enchiladas were good if a bit small but there were three of them and the chicken was nice and tender. The bill for JUST MYSELF was $28. I know this is Valencia and all, but DAYUM! That was too damn much money for food that took too damn long. I even had to get up and refill my own water because the server never really came back.\n\nI really don't see myself returning to this place unless one of two things happen; either they lower their prices and speed up their service or there is a crazy apocalypse and this is the only remaining restaurant in all of San Francisco.", "author": "Liz S."}

Getting a same day reservation on a Thursday night was really easy--that probably should have been my first clue that this was going to be a mediocre experience at best.\n\nThe service was fine--not particularly good, but not bad either--and the menu looked promising. The food, on the other hand, left A LOT to be desired. For appetizers, we ordered the taquitos and the Papas con Chorizo. The taquitos were perfectly fried and the chorizo was tasty. For my main course, I ordered the ribs, which were served with rice and beans. The rice was not your typical Mexican-style rice. It was white rice, sauteed with onions and garlic, and had an oily texture. The refried beans were extremely salty. The ribs were tough and they did NOT remove the silvery membrane on the bone side of the slab of ribs. What self-respecting restaurant leaves the membrane on the ribs?! Amateur move. Hubby ordered the cochinita pibil which looked delicious, but was extremely bland and desperately needed salt.\n\nThe price point is similar to Nopalito, but the execution of the food was sub-par. Considering the availability of low-price, quality Mexican food in the Mission as well as the smattering of higher-priced full-service Mexican restaurants in the city generally (think Nopalito, Padrecito, etc.), Regalito Rosticeria really needs to step up its game.

The last time I was here was a few years ago, but I remember being very impressed with the freshness of the food and really liked that they use free-range meat. I had the house special roast chicken before, but wanted to experiment a bit. As it turns out, we were very happy with our selections, which our very sweet and enthusiastic wait person was very helpful with. \n\nThe menu offered such interesting vegetarian options as well as meat dishes. We started with a botana; a vegetable empanada. The masa was delicate and the filling flavorful but not overwhelming. It was served with a little marinated red onion salad, which was the perfect compliment. We enjoyed some of the house sangria as well which was very flavorful and fruity without being too sweet. \n\nFor entrees, we shared the tinga de polla and a chili relleno. The chili relleno was a pasilla chili stuffed with squash, herbs, onions and topped with melting cotija cheese. We loved the texture and thought the flavor was delicate and very special.\n\nThe tinga de pollo almost reminded me of Hawaiian kalua pork, with it's smokiness, but the avacado, lime and other flavors made it much more complex and very tasty. Our server informed us that they go out of their way to make it very authentic and use a unique recipe as well as very carefully prepare the ingredients. The house-made tortillas were scrumptious and we loved scooping up the chicken with them. \n\nFor dessert, we had the best churros we've ever had in our lives! We were so full, we didn't think we'd finish them, but couldn't leave a delectable morsel behind! \n\nOverall, we thought the restaurant had nice atmosphere and great service!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-08", "description": "I wanted to post this review of regalito focusing primarily on the quality of the dishes and the traditional style that Eduardo and his kitchen staff follow. Growing up in SF I remember on going to Chavitas on 17th St. and los Jarritos at the corner of S. Van Ness Ave. As I remember it these were two of the \"most authentic\" Mexican restaurants in town and considering that I traveled to Mexico regularly when I was young I knew that these restaurants were not very good or very authentic. Regalito under Eduardo's management is in my opinion one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in town. His touch is so good that even the beans taste amazing. The other dishes like the cochinita is simply superb and no other place in the city makes the cochinita the way that Eduardo cooks his. While some might say that the servings are small the truth is that outside of the US supersizing is not a thing, meaning that in my opinion the dishes are of more than adequate size. Some have also complaint about the burritos, well the point of this restaurant is for you to eat real dishes that are more authentic. I have tried almost all the dishes and my personal preference is the cochinita simply because I love the dish and know how very very hard it is to cook it, that said the enchiladas are amazing and the chicken is very good. I hope that they continue the good work.", "author": "A.M. E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-24", "description": "Overall, a disappointment. I don't understand the positive reviews here. Regalito has little to offer. Let's go through the categories. \n\nComfort: We were seated at the bar area on freezing cold metal chairs, and it was a cold night to begin with, so the chairs were literally sucking any warmth away from our butts. They were hard and uncomfortable. Looking around, people are crammed in little tables on unpadded chairs. I don't understand why restauranteurs miss this simple, but crucial point. Make your guests comfortable. Put comfortable chairs in your restaurant. It's not that difficult.\n\nAmbiance: Very small and very loud. I don't recall any music, or anything to enhance the vibe.\n\nDrinks: They have no liquor license, so forget about getting a margarita with actual tequila. That's a major bummer.\n\nFood: The core food is decent here, but it is not as good as I expected it to be. The dishes are fairly simple with minimal creativity, and portions are smaller than the prices suggest. I prefer Mexico City-style flair. Color. Fruit. European influences. Regalito has none of that. The dishes, although solid, are somewhat boring.\n\nThe Chili Relleno, which is traditionally a stuffed pepper, wasn't even stuffed. The ingredients were lazily ladled on top of a charred pepper. Disappointing.\n\nCost: For what you get, and for the Mission, it's not a great value. $18-$25 for one entree.\n\nService: The kitchen is literally right in front of you and it is clear from the workload of the cooks that they were totally overwhelmed. There are only two cooks working the entire restaurant, and they were busting their asses. I felt so sorry for them, I wanted to go back there and help them. This is why it took quite some time to get our food. We waited and waited.\n\nMade the mistake of ordering dessert. Again, waiting and waiting. Cooks overwhelmed.\n\nFrustrated, I told the server and he assured me that they were frying the churros. I told him he was full of it, because I was watching them the whole time. Sure enough he asked, and they hadn't even started. Thankfully he took it off our bill, we paid and left. Never to return.", "author": "Brian C."}

What a deal!\n\nObviously, this place is going to charge more than your regular mexican joint in the Mission. This place has ambiance and waiter service, and they're gonna charge you for them.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Papas con chorizos: the chorizos is yummy with oily goodness\n- Pollo regalito: tender juicy roasted chicken. I like the collard greens that comes with it too\n- Enchiladas rojas: I don't really like enchiladas in the first place, so this one is ok. My boyfriend really likes it tho.\n- Churros: can't go wrong with churros!\n- Flan: way too eggy. I think this is the only failed dish.\n\nService is outstanding. The owner always ask how we're doing, our water is always filled promptly, he also gave us the habanero salsa which is really good and spicy. Their tortilla is also made fresh. We sat at the bar so we watched the entire process, it's pretty cool.\n\nYou definitely need a reservation, otherwise you can just sit at the bar.

The cochinita pibil is the best we have ever tasted.  Eduardo, the manager, says it's his grandmother's recipe.  She was a chef in Mexico and taught him well.  The pork is marinated overnight in orange juice, garlic, achiote and other spices and wrapped in banana leaves.  The result is an amazing, tender, juicy, flavorful treat.  We also sampled the beef tamales in a wonderful tomatillo sauce and the chicken in Oaxacan mole and they were also wonderful.

Thank goodness for holiday weekends when most locals are away.\n\nMy friend mentioned they are known for their handmade tortillas and mole. I tried the tortillas and they were delicious. Tonight the mole came with the one-remaining special lamb dish, which I decided to skip. Instead I ordered the Enchiladas Rojas ~ \"Handmade corn tortillas dipped in red sauce of New Mexico and Guajillo chilies; garnished with onino and queso fresco; with rice and whole pintos.\" I really enjoyed this. I had a bite of my friend's Enchiladas Verdes, which was also wonderful.\n\nAlso tried the Elote ~ \"grilled corn on the cob, cotija cheese, house-made mayonnaise, lime, and chile powder.\" Decadent and delicious. Note to Self: Don't order this on a date (unless I want to make it an awkward one), it's pretty messy.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Capirotada ~ \"Warm bread pudding with apples, raisins, nuts & Oaxacan Queso; Mexican vanilla gelato.\" Fantastic! My friend, Jeanine S. described it like a 'bready apple pie' ~ heavenly. We all enjoyed our food.\n\nOur server also brought a spicy avocado cream sauce with cilantro.

I bought the Huevos Americanos for 13 dollars.  I assumed that it would be a more filling dish, and literally laughed out loud when I was presented my plate. \nThe dish came with two eggs and potatoes and bacon. The two eggs were pretty standard and there was the equivalent of maybe 2 slices of bacon sliced in half twice to create a sad illusion of caloric substance.  The serving of potatoes is what really made me laugh.  I kid you not, there were 5 pieces of potatoes roughly fingertip size. I ate them in one bite to make a point. \n\nMy entire meal was gone in probably 45 seconds and I immediately went from the restaurant to a taqueria for some actual food.  I now understand why my group of 15 were the only ones in the restaurant during brunch hour on a sunday morning.  No one wants to pay $15 for a tiny portion of mediocre mexican food (especially not in the Mission where options abound).

And while I'm aware that these things happen (we are eating animals, after all), there were various pieces of bones in my enchiladas.\n\nI thought dessert would end on a high note, but sadly the hot chocolate was brought to us cold. And it wasn't a particularly busy night.\n\nAs far as service, it also left something to be desired. Even though I made a reservation, our server tried to seat us at the bar. What is the point in making a reservation if they're just going to try to squeeze you at the bar? There was obviously a table for two that was available, which we took. Additionally, getting your water glass refilled didn't seem to be high on their priority list.

Though we'd already ordered it, he seemed to be warning us off it:  \"Some people think it needs more salt\" he reported.  Often, I'd heed this warning, but I was curious.  \n\nCauliflower, tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos bathed in a lime juice, topped with fresh avocado slices, and served with chips and a side of habanero salsa.  It was good; a cross between pico de gallo and ceviche (minus any seafood), and no extra salt needed. \n\nWe shared a fine bottle of red ($36 - $40) though I think the sangria would have paired better with the food.  \n\nKnowing that RR turns into \"Pigalito\", with an all pig menu once weekly, J opted for the pork special which our waiter reported had been roasting all day, along with pineapple and other goodness.  Served with beans and tortillas, the pork was definitely the blue ribbon award winner:  Delectably tasty, it reminded us of a dish someone would prepare for their best friend in their Guatemalan kitchen.  They know their pork here.  \n\nI was wavering between two meatless entrees and took the waiter's recommendation of the Chile Relleno ($16), which was mild in flavor and unremarkable and made me wish I'd gotten a chicken or pork dish instead.  \n\nThere's a million other - and better and cheaper - places to choose from in the Mission but RR is a nice place.

However, he was happy to allow me to use my groupon if I was okay with potentially sitting at the bar.\n\nWhen I first walked in, my thoughts were: uh yes! I'm very happy to sit at the bar and watch the flames grilling our meat and the fresh tortillas and guacamole being produced. While I guiltily and anxiously awaited my date (husband was circling the block looking for parking), the host was gracious and made sure to check in on me to let me know he hadn't forgotten that I was waiting for a table. I didn't make a reservation and there are other complete parties here... and you're remembering me?? Thanks!! :)\n\nBased on all the rave reviews about the guacamole, we ordered it as our appetizer.  For $10, it's a very decent amount of guac and deep fried tortilla (GIANT chips!), albeit on the pricey side for guacamole. But WOW, my husband was BLOWN AWAY... he would not stop raving about how delicious the guac was! The portion is better suited to a party of 4, so I over-indulged a bit on guacamole and was a little full by the time our entrees came out.  But after our first few bites, we were both studying the guacamole-making lady and taking mental notes to try to replicate the recipe at home. THAT GOOD!\n\nAs for the entrees, the flavor was fresh and ingredient-focused, rather than deep slow-cooked flavors.  Husband got the enchiladas verde (his fave) which came with a side of rice and beans.  Everything was well-seasoned and tasty... not super greasy and not super spicy.  At our server's suggestion, I ordered the carne asada, which came with rice and excellently crisp green beans and a side of red sauce.  Per my request, the carne asada was perfectly medium and served with soft freshly made tortillas.  The green beans were my fave.\n\nWe ended our meal with the bread pudding for dessert as it was included in the Groupon.  It had an really interesting smoky flavor from being skillet grilled with an awesome crunch from raw (blanched?) almonds.  Even with the caramel sauce, this was a more savory than sweet dessert.  But nothing special to both of us.\n\nWe also had a sangria (for me!) and a Corona with lime (for him!) and appreciated that the Corona was served in a frosty-chilled glass.  A great effort to overcome their lack of beer on tap! Overall, we enjoyed our experience, especially for the price (thank you Groupon for introducing us to this place and saving us $30 on our first meal).  We would like to come back with husband's parents who have dietary restrictions but miss Mexican food (if they could get it without the excessive salt, spice and grease), especially for the guacamole.  However, the price was bit much for my stingy wallet, but understandable for the very fresh ingredients and very attentive service.  Without the Groupon, our appetizer, two entrees, dessert and two drinks would have been $90.  3.5 stars if we had no Groupon, but rounded up because... we did! :)", "author": "Hannah C."}

After all, in my fantasy, this was to be my new neighborhood old standby.\n\nAlas, I was underwhelmed.\n\nLet me start by saying the ambiance and decor were lovely, the staff very attentive and polite, and they were very accomodating to our large party.  But all of that can't make up for the fact that I just didn't dig the food.\n\nWe ordered three bowls of guacamole to share at the table, and as it arrived, I was salivating, just thinking about how good homemade guacamole was going to taste in my mouth...and then I tried it.....and I was disappointed!  It was bitter, needed salt desperately, and all of us were so unimpressed with it, that it lingered on in front of us, as we were less than interested in consuming it, despite our hunger.\n\nFor dinner, I decided to order two appetizers:  an order of Taquitos de Pollo and one order of Taquitos de Papas y Queso.  They arrived with a squiggle of crema and a spoonful of salsa over the middle, the latter portion looking decidedly anemic given how much taquito there was before me.  Both the chicken and potato-cheese taquitos suffered from chronic flavorlessness, and the chicken also gave the double-whammy of being super-dry, sawdusty, even.  I craved a dipping sauce, especially after using up with the first taquito what little salsa was on my plate.  Eventually I flagged down the server and asked for some more crema, which definitely perked up the taquitos...but my stubborn food brain was still annoyed that it took a cup of crema to give my dinner any flavor.\n\nMy partner got the Enchiladas Verdes, which were by far the most tasty offering on the menu, everyone at the table agreed.  I enjoyed several forkfuls of this dish, but noted the small portion for $14, knowing full well that I could go to any of a zillion other Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood and get that same dish for almost half the price.  It wasn't, sadly, special.\n\nAnother friend got the carnitas.  I found the meat dry, which is pretty rare for carnitas, and again, lacking in any depth of flavor, which made me very sad, since I love carnitas!  Also, we both noted tha the pintos were strangely spicy, almost inedible to us, something one doesn't generally expect from pintos.\n\nI wouldn't go here again unless I'm dragged for a birthday or something like that.  Not because it's a bad restaurant, because it most certainly is not.  But because it just didn't inspire me to want to go back.  I suppose that different taste buds will feel differently about this restaurant, and honestly, I'm happy it exists in my neighborhood, because it's clean and pretty and the orange lettering on the front makes me happy to walk by.", "author": "Amy L."}

My parents are from Jalisco and Michoacan (Mexico for those of you unfamiliar with Mexican states) so I'm always excited to find a place that doesn't bastardize the food of my parent's homeland or list \"taco salad\" or a burrito that weighs 20 lbs. as a main entree.  \n\nNow onto this lovely spot!  I've been here a handful of times and it's always because of the food.  Here are my favorites in no particular order.  **Disclaimer: These are only my favorites because this is all I've tried to date.  They have all been awesome and excited to try more.\n\nSo the entrees:\n\n1. Tinga de Pollo - as good as my mom's recipe!\n2. Carne con Chile Colorado - this takes me back to visiting my family in Mexico City!\n3. Carnitas - you can never go wrong with pork on a fork.\n4. Pollo con mole negro - this isn't the \"come out of a jar\" garbage they serve at most places.  You can taste the Oaxacan love in this dish.\n\nOther pros?  The service is awesome and very attentive.  Did I mention the handmade tortillas - this may seem like a small detail but I've been eating tortillas since before I could walk and nothing makes a mexican meal more amazing than that.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for those of you interested in experiencing a little taste of Mexico.

My experience has always been a winning combo of delicious and unusual takes on classic Mexican cuisine, warm and attentive service and a comfortable setting with a lovely outdoor space. I've never had a bad meal here, but the standouts for me have been the taquito app (I love them so much I often get as a main with a side of their DEELISH brussel sprouts); chicken enchiladas - healthy portion, yummy tomatillo sauce, perfectly cooked chicken; and carnitas. \n\nLast night, however, I tried their ribs in mole special. I'm not generally a mole fan - it's so easy to be heavy-handed with it. This was undoubtedly the best, most complex and flavorful mole I've ever had! The ribs were fork tender and the pork was complemented by the flavors in the mole, rather than being overpowered as so often is the case. They came with homemade tortillas (mmm), rice and beans. As always - service was perfect, vibe relaxed and inviting and the Cab I ordered - delicious. But, really, this dish is the stuff of fantasy - can't stop thinking about it!", "author": "Ruby G."}

The selection of dishes were quite unique: homemade chicherons, pork belly, mole sauce, and Mexican hot chocolate are not super common, even in the bay area. And we liked the fact that all the meat was sourced from hormone/antibiotic-free animals. But we also felt that the prices were somewhat high, even for gourmet Mexican food. Two glasses of sangria, an appetizer, two dinners, and a desert, none of which were very large, came to just over $80, plus tax and tip. Had we been asked the value of the meal after we finished, we would have put it closer to $60.

I don't mean that we pick the wrong place.  I mean we wait until it's too late (and by late I don't mean 10PM, I mean 6 or so - hey, with 2 kids we need to eat a bit early) to make any plans and then we struggle to find a place that a) looks appealing, b) doesn't cost a ton (this is SF after all), and c) isn't already packed.\n\nSo on this day we were wandering around the Mission, checking out the cool shops and letting time pass us by.  It was around 6 when we decided that we must eat.  We passed a few places by - too full of hipsters, too expensive...etc, when we stumbled upon Regalito.  The menu looked good, albeit a bit steep for uppity Mexican food, but we weren't going to let that deter us.  After all, we've learned that we should eat at the first place that seems decent or we could pay the consequences of our poor decision-making.\n\nRegallito is a nice looking restaurant, with fairly modern, clean decor and only a handful of tables.  As I said before, the menu seemed to have some traditional Mexican dishes, but with a healthier, California twist.\n\nWe started with the Tortilla soup, which was honestly the best tortilla soup ever!\nFor the main, I chose the veggie Enchiladas stuffed with nopal (cactus).  Meh.  It took a while before I noticed the nopales, and even then there wasn't much flavor.  Price $18.  Ouch.\n\nMy wife ordered the Pollo Regalito which was tasty - well spiced with good sides.  Note that everything was jammed onto a smallish plate.  A bigger plate would have been a lot easier to eat from.  Price $17.  Ouch.\n\nMy son chose the Carne Asada.  Not a ton of carne for the price, but it was good quality and well-seasoned.  He liked it.  Price $22.  Holy crap!\n\nThere is a theme here.  Yes, we knew it was a bit pricey before we sat down.  But we also expected something extraordinary, not just a medium step up from the typical Mexican places found in the Mission.  Yes, the food was good, but not $70 for dinner good. I guess we paid for the good service, nice decor, and superior ingredients.\n\nNext time we'll save some money and go to the nondescipt Mexican restaurants that serve similar dishes for half the price.

Overall decor is bright and cheerful, and the restaurant is very clean, refreshing counterpoint to the dingy \"naked bulb lit\" burrito joints that line the streets of the MIssion... Organic/fresh/sustainable ingredients in very tasty food. Portions are not huge, but plenty filling. The giant round tortilla chips that came with the excellent guacamole seemed handmade to us, unlike the claim of another review -- regardless they were just the right foil to a tangy guac and I enjoyed them (and I'm a foodie). Mole is excellent, as is the steak, and pork. Have not tried any of the veggie options...A wee bit pricey.", "author": "Kate A."}

I always wonder about the places that have to offer these deals and assume that they are little better than average, so I went into it with no significant expectations.  We came on a Tuesday night and could only get 5:30 reservations.  It's cute inside but small.  Think neighborhood taqueria given a decent makeover.  They serve wine and beer, but no hard stuff.  \n\nThe Good:  Every bit of food and salsa served to us.  I'm serious.  I thought for sure I wasn't going to be impressed, but they really surprised me. The taquitos and empanadas on the appy menu were off the hook.  Fried perfectly, meat flavorful and moist, perfect garnishing of queso fresco and crema along with a very good pico de gallo.  Then you have the habanero salsa they provide to the table.  A great balance of heat and flavor that doesn't overpower the food if accompanies.  Emapanandas were flaky and the filling meaty and moist.  Also a home run.  \nMain courses were the Enchiladas rojas and the Chile verde.  The enchilada sauce they used had a great smoky chile flavor and they tried to do justice to the mushroom and swiss chard filling.  I would have liked a little more flavor in the filling, but the enchilada sauce helped.  The chile verde - oh. my. god. - perfectly cooked nopales (cactus for all who don't habla) add a great citrusy note and slightly crunchy textural counterbalance to the most succulent hunks of pork in a great sauce.  The rice was given the stamp of approval from my dining companion who measures all Mexican restaurants by the quality of their rice. The servers were very nice, helpful, and attentive without being intrusive. \nDesert was the Arroz con leche (mexican rice pudding) that my companion said had the subtle cinnamon and bay flavors her Mom managed to get into her cooking.  I had the homemade churros with mexican chocolate.  Churros were incredible.  Crispy on the outside and still just slightly doughy on the inside. Prior to that cup of chocolate, I have always had a negative opinion of mexican hot chocolate as grainy and watery - the cinnamon notes are nice, but i've never been that impressed.  This changed my mind.  Rich, smooth, some spice notes and great chocolate flavor.  Damn.  The wine list here may not be expansive and may not win a Wine Spectator, but they did a nice job of picking mostly South Ameican wines with good flavor at reasonable price points.  \n\nThe Bad: I dunno... parking?  \n\nThe Mediocre:  The enchiladas themselves were just OK for me, but the dish was helped greatly by the enchilada sauce.  After tasting the chile verde I don;t see myself ordering the enchiladas again.  Hey, at least they offer a vegetarian option.\n\nOverall:  Two enthusiastic thumbs up. The next time I come here I am eating my way through the appetizer menu and then going straight to dessert. YUM!", "author": "John G."}

I should clarify that this goes for taco shop Mexican fare only. Aside from Mariscos, I have been unimpressed with SD's selection of sit-down and regional Mexican cuisine. Although I recently lived in Mar Vista, LA where every Mexican restaurant happens to be Oaxacan and specialize in mole, Regalito does a much better job. \n\nI probably don't need to credentialize myself by noting that I have been to Oaxaca or recounting my numerous encounters with different types of moles. I will say though that this place does it right. I came in with the wifey and a couple of friends last night for dinner and had to have the mole. They had some pork mole enchiladas, but I had envisioned a half of a chicken smothered in the rich, delicious sauce. The waiter said that he could have the chef do the mole with chicken enchiladas, shredded chicken, or the roasted chicken. Score! Although they initially gave me just the breast, they added in the thigh, competing the half chicken promptly upon request and without questions. I love how flexible and accommodating they were about this. It really shows that they care about their customers. \n\nAs for the mole itself, amazing! I tore it up. A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole for her first mole experience and had to save the last one to bring home for her husband to try. She was really impressed about how flavorful the sauce was while not sweet or excessively spicy. We also got the guac, which is a bit pricey at $10, but it is huge. The four of us did not finish it. It is also made very fresh and is delicious. \n\nThe wifey got the cochinita pibil, which she thought was a miss. I think I have had better versions, but enjoyed the flavors. The pork may have been a bit dry. Our other friend devoured her enchiladas verdes and reported that they were excellent. \n\nWe had a Bloomspot coupon for this one, which helped with the price. Regardless though, this is a nice place to come and have a satisfying meal. I don't mind paying more money if the food is going to be this good. I have been here once before and tried the tortilla soup, which was amazing. Unfortunately, they did not have it this time. I have to make it in some time for the pozole and really want to make it to this Pigalito thing too. Check this place out, it is the bomb!", "author": "Miguel V."}

They don't wear no steenking badges here, senor!\n\nBut if you've ever been to Oaxaca, you know there is a whole other side of Mexico that has nothing to do with sombreros, mariachi bands and those plastic dogs that have the heads that go up and down on your dashboard when you go low riding in the barrios. In fact, Regalito is exactly the type of clean, modern-looking place you'd find along a side street in Mexico's culinary capital.\n\nMake no mistake that in a neighborhood full of great south-of-the-border eateries, this one stands out for the fresh ingredients they use in some interesting variations on basic Mexican dishes. Standing out in its own building on 18th Street between Valencia and Lexington, the small, tidy place inside has a warm vibe with a bright chartreuse hue on the walls and stainless steel and beech wood on the lengthy counter.\n\nI ordered the $12.50 Pollo Con Mole Negro, which is a quarter-chicken, free-range of course, covered in a thick Oaxacan mole full of chiles, nuts, and spices. It came with stewed pinto beans and rice. Tasty and the breast-dominated chicken was cooked to the right tenderness. My friend had the simpler $9.50 Pollo Regalito, which is the leg and thigh of a chicken marinaded in garlic, lime and chiles. It also came with the beans and rice.\n\nBarely three months old, they also offer pork, steak and veggie dishes which I look forward to trying some other time. There are also a bevy of appetizers and side dishes of which we just ordered the $3 Salsa Fresca y Tostadas, a bowl of incredibly fresh tomato, onion and chile salsa with deep-dried tortilla rounds you need to break apart to scoop up the salsa.  Yummy and just enough of a teaser for the entree.\n\nThey even offer a $9.95 \"Mexican worker's lunch\" consisting of agua fresca, a chosen entree (today it was a pork dish), dessert or coffee. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. The staff is friendly and incredibly quiet though not in a dysfunctional way since I am making the grand presumption that it is a family-run place.\n\nKeep in mind that it is small (just three tables and the counter), so I imagine weekend waits are a given. Even though you can have dessert here, just walk up 18th two blocks to get your scoop of salted caramel at the Bi-Rite Creamery.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...fresh tasting...you feel you've made the healthier choice in the Mission\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...clean, contemporary and no sombreros, serapes or velvet paintings of orphans on burros\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very accommodating but no worries, they don't hover\nTOTAL - 4 stars...has potential to earn another star if they get more daring on the dishes but fine and dandy for what it is", "author": "Ed U."}

I tried this restaurant on a Monday evening and my 3 friends and I dined al fresco on the patio in back.  Since there were four of us we were able to sample a good portion of their menu. \n\nWe started out with the soup of the day .. a creamy sweet corn soup.   It was tasty.  The soup tasted as if it were made with real cream and it was a white creamy soup.   It was rather rich  and perhaps a tad too sweet for my taste but not sugary.  It tasted vaguely like cream of corn (only better) without all the lumpiness. \n\nFor appetizers we order the taquitos de papas y queso and there were 4 taquitos so we each had one.   The taquitos were large  over an inch in diameter. They were served on a bed of cabbage salad and were topped with cream and salsa and a bit of the queso fresco. This dish was a hit for everyone and not a spec of food remained when the waiter cleared the dish.\n\nFor the main dish I had the Chile Relleno with a side of Elote.  This dish was wonderful the vegetables meant it was a \"mild\" dish but they had salsa and hot sauce on the table for me to spice it up. (I tend to like a bit of spice or a lot of spice).  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and was a nice change from the cheese filled rellenos you get at other places.  The Elote was charred perfectly and tasted delicious.  I could have used a bit more spice on this one, but I'm not complaining.\n\nOne friend had the Enchiladas Rojas and it was served with 3 tortillas loosely rolled and filled with veggies.   It was another delicious dish but a bit more filling than the Chile Relleno.    Someone else had a side of brussel sprouts.  The brussel sprouts were cut in half and sauteed or baked.  They looked delicious. \n\nWarm corn tortillas were served with dinner, I am not quite sure if they were made on the premises or purchased from a tortilla vendor, but they were fresh and tasty. \n\nWe also had a few of the juices  (non-alcoholic) and a Soju bloody Mary and a bottled beer (no beers on tap).   The Soju Bloody Mary was a bit watery and seemed rather weak (perhaps because it was soju).  I don't know if it was just our bartender, but it really looked more like a strawberry aqua fresca that was watered down.    I'm not a fan of Soju so I didn't try it. \n\nI would definitely try this place again.  Tha patio on a sunny day is an excellent spot to enjoy a meal.", "author": "Cat C."}

Table rocked, so we shoved a napkin under. Another 10 minutes goes by and sure enough, we finally get water. \n\nEverything went pretty slow from there. Granted, roasted Elote does take some time, but it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get our beverages to us when the restaurant is dead. I also think our waitress didn't like our jokes about how we wanted our drinks \"right away then\" since when we requested the corn be delivered as an appetizer and they couldn't do it (since it takes so long to cook, she said they'd probably end up being with the entrees).

A lot of restaurants like to skimp on the guacamole--not Regalito. The surplus of guacamole helped accompany several of my meals the next day. As for the carnitas, the generous portion had a good blend of both succulent, juicy shredded pork and fattier chunks that will make your cholesterol jump a notch or two. Served with delicious rice & beans and a fresh salsa medley, the savory blend was quite enjoyable.\n\nOn the flip side, the chicken enchiladas were rather disappointing. They were somewhat bitter and the overall flavor failed to land an impressionable punch. \n\nA small, but noteworthy point, I took notice to how they packed up the leftovers. Most places put all remaining items in a box where it eventually ends up tossing and turning into a giant mess. With each item having its own small box the different items maintained their proper flavor. This notion of \"separate but equal\" for leftovers is the only way to go (sorry Dr. King!).\n\nLeaving the restaurant full, but not completely satisfied, the consensus was that although some dishes were tasty, filling, and moderately priced, there was not whole lot that would make me choose going to Regalito over Nopalito.

Still, I feel like I have to share my experience here.\n\nThere wasn't a wait for a table for three, so it didn't seem like they were totally slammed. They did seem to have only one waitress working, who took our order for drinks and guacamole and then disappeared for a long time before returning with the drinks and to take our orders for food. At least half an hour after putting in our orders she came to tell us that our food would be out soon. 20 minutes later we put some money on the table for the guacamole and lemonade and went to Taqueria Cancun.  I wonder how long it took them to notice we were gone. For the record I've never left a restaurant after ordering before, but they just took so ridiculously long to bring out our food that waiting any longer seemed unreasonable. \n\nSince I didn't get to eat it, I can't tell you whether their food is any good, but I can tell you that the service is awful.

The pork was chunky and braised.  Super juicy and flavorful.  They came with whole pintos, a chunky salsa fresca with jalapeno, and sliced avocado.  And the homemade corn tortillas were to-die-for.  Not greasy.  Just perfect.  And they topped it off with a spicy habanero salsa.  \nThird - any place that serves Victoria beer is already starting off ahead of the rest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-03", "description": "I tried dining here once before when I was REALLY hungry.  After enduring a reasonable wait (we had no reservations), we were seated at the counter.  This afforded me the opportunity to watch some great tortilla making, as well as food being prepared with fresh ingredients.   I enjoyed having the kitchen right across from the counter, as I am somewhat of a culinary voyeur.  But, after waiting over 20 minutes and never being acknowledged by anyone, my stomach told me that I should come back when I could wait a while without getting sick.  Yes, they lost my business to a less posh but totally delicious Mission restaurant.\n\nI returned to Regalito last night (a Thursday) in order to redeem a Groupon that I bought after my initial visit.  This time, I packed my patience.  When I arrived, we were quoted a 15 minute wait time- reasonable.  \n\nWe killed the first 15 minutes doing some produce shopping in the neighborhood.  The next 15 minutes were spent sitting outside.  We chatted with some guests that were dining at one of their outdoor tables about their fear that the server had abandoned them- yikes!  This prompted us to check on our status.  The server inside said that  it would be a few more minutes and she would try to get us a table *wink/nudge*.  Literal wink.  As though we are getting the insider VIP treatment.\n\nBut alas, I packed my patience.  More importantly, I packed my Groupon that was already paid for!  Nothing was going to make me leave.  Within 10 minutes after receiving the \"wink-of-assurance\", we were seated at a table.  YAY!  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant was very warm and welcoming.  It is quite cozy (small), so discussing top secret info might be risky.  I could clearly hear everything that the table 6 inches away from mine was saying.  \n\nOn to the food!  We split two appetizers and two entrees.  To start: Guacamole con Tostados and the Taquitos de Pollo.  It was pretty cool watching the guacamole and tostados being made to order.  My only criticism is that the guacamole was pretty bland.  It lacked acidity and any level of complexity in flavor.  Pretty much tasted like delicious avocado mushed with a few tomatoes here and there.  I really liked the Taquitos de Pollo- crispy, densely packed with pollo, fresh flavors.\n\nI asked the server for recommendations for our entrees.  She said we should definitely try the Cochinita Pibil, which is citrus and achiote marinated pork wrapped in a banana leaf served with habanero and pickled onions.  HELL YEAH!  Sounds like a party on my palate.  The other recommendations that she gave were Tacos de Pescado and Enchiladas Verdes.  Since the fish of the say was arctic char, I went with the fish tacos.  \n\nUnfortunately when our entrees were to come out, the server only brought the Tacos de Pescado and informed us that the restuarant was out of the Cochinita de Pebil.  \"No big deal, I will get the enchiladas verdes\", I told the server.  But I was really pretty bummed.  The pork dish really sounded interesting.  \n\nThe fish tacos were quite good.  Again, the homemade tortillas come into play.  The fish tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly.  By the time we finished the fish tacos, the enchiladas were being delivered to the table.  The kitchen did a good job of getting the new entree out asap.  \n\nThe enchiladas were just ok.  The chicken inside was bland.  And the enchiladas were more like folded chicken tacos with a fine chunky salsa verde instead of a smooth green enchilada sauce on top along with some onion, queso fresco and crema.  I really would not recommend this dish. \n\nOverall, the food was hit and miss.  The service was much better on my second visit, but I can't speak to the consistency of service.  I think that the people outside felt abandoned because there was really only one server and a food runner attending to all of the tables in the restaurant.   If you plan on dining here, get a reservation and know that the service may be slower.  The food is more expensive than your average Mission restaurant, but if you care about eating fresh authentic food or ambiance (which I value much less) the price is pretty reasonable.  \n\nWill I be back?  I have to.  I have one more Groupon!", "author": "Floyd R."}

My dear friend K is quite the foodie and had read some great recommendations for here.  We made reservations for early on a Thursday.  We were one of the few people in the restaurant at that time but service was still slow.  The atmosphere is OK but other than some interesting wall art (which you will have plenty of time to look at) its nothing amazing.\n\nAll that aside, everything can be forgiven if the food is great and this food... it was merely edible.  I'm talking bland folks.  I got the mole and it tasted like \"Denny's American Diner does Mole\".  Very unflavorful.  I kept searching for something with kick or interest in the whole plate but it was a dud.  I kept it to myself for a while then saw K just kind of poking at her food too.... another dud.  Two meals, totally mediocre.  We didn't finish, definitely didn't get to-go boxes and left to find something else worth the calories to fill us up.\n\nOn the a positive note, although slow the service is friendly.  I left something in the restaurant when we left and the waitress came out to give it to me.  Also, their Sangria is VERY tasty... just don't come on an empty stomach :)", "author": "Michelle B."}

It has a fast-food/taqueria feel to it (open kitchen area right next to the seats), but the prices are more expensive than a taqueria ($16/entrees).

The restaurant could not accomodate all of us at one table, so some of us had to sit at the bar.  \n\nThere was a live mariachi singer who sang us Happy Birthday, but I think he was a free agent (not hired by the restaurant).\n\nFOOD:\nThe tortilla chips & guacamole & salsa for appetizers were decent, not out-of-this-world.  The guacamole was a tad bland. \nI got the chicken con mole negro, which is poached chicken with mole sauce, rice & beans on the side.  The entire dish was pretty bland, average for Mexican food in the Bay Area (I've been to some hole-in-the wall places that had much tastier food).  The portions are hearty though, and the mole sauce was good.\n\nOverall, I give this place 3 stars.

Unable to think for myself, I helplessly entered and soon found myself seated at the bar. \n\nInitial impressions, aside from the amazing smell: The space is on the smaller side and has lots of character. Open kitchen with bar seating watching the action and table seating to the side. Lively colors and colorful artwork drape the walls. I likes. \n\nThe service staff is super friendly and before long I began chatting with one of the service staff. I discovered that I was 3.5 yrs late in discovering this place and it is family owned. I also found out that every Tuesday the restaurant procures a whole 200 lb pig and roasts it. Carnitas. Chicarrones. Pork belly. Todos. Is your mouth watering yet? Mine is.\n\nBefore I go into what went down, I would like give much love to the little Mexican lady making the hand-made corn tortillas (read: FTMFW). \n\nContrary to standard operating procedures when trying a new eatery, gf and I ordered only 1 plate a piece, thanks to the 1 hr limit on the parking meter. What went down:\n\nEnchiladas de pollo - Good (but not great). Hand made tortillas really make the dish and the salsa verde is very tasty, if not a bit on the tart side. Also topping the dish were crema, queso fresco, and of course, cilantro y cebollas. Served with pinto beans and well seasoned rice (you know, the orange kind). \n\nCOCHINITA PIBIL - A must-try-dish. I think this is the thing that grabbed my nose. It's pork wrapped in banana leaf and stewed with cocaine and magical fairy dust (disclaimer: not really cooked with cocaine and magical fairy dust). The color is a deep red and the flavor is phenomenal, thanks to the 5-6 hrs of stewing in a pot. Served w/ black beans, pickled red onion and tortillas. Unbelievable.  \n\nI missed out on the special of the day, which was Mexican pork chops (as it was explained to me).

The vegetables are fresh, the chips are crispy and the sangria is sweet. \n\nThe downfall is the price. It's worth it for the quantity and quality, but for much less you can get equally as good a meal from one of the other fine Mexican food establishments in the city.

The decor is nice modern European style, and we enjoyed sitting at the counter and watching the staff bustle to prepare the food.  Unfortunately, for the food we ordered there wasn't much preparing.  I got the Pollo Con Mole Negro.  This was prepared by taking a piece of chicken out of a container that was keeping chicken warm and putting sauce on it from a vat.  Ian H ordered the cochinita pibil.  The preparation of his dish involved taking the pork out of a container, putting it on top of some black beans, sprinkling a bit of greens on top of that, and handing it all over to us.  \n\nSo yeah, fast, but at the expense of everything being already premade.  Now, for my dish, the chicken was pretty dry and quite bland by itself (especially compared to say the nearby Limon).  But the sauce was quite tasty.  Ian's dish was pork and beans.  Seriously, that was it.  The pork was kind of tastless and the beans were beans.  It's like that Weezer song, only, the Weezer song sounded better than the dish tasted.

Tonight we decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed.  We had guacamole as an appetizer and it was very bland (the tortillas were good though). As a Latino myself one of the ways I measure really bland food at a Latino place is if I need to pick up the salt to add to my meal, and this was the case here.  Looking at the menu I saw the chicken rotisserie totally overpriced ($19 for 1/2 chicken!! when at Limon for $20 you get a full chicken plus two sides, and the chicken at Limon is very tasty), so chicken was a no-no.  I had the cochinita pibil and it was good, but it came in a plate full of black beans (bland too) and that was it on the plate.  My spouse had the green enchiladas and said they were bland too, we started joking that we could have had a more tasty one for less than half of the price at one of the delicious taquerias in the Mission.  We decided not to get dessert there.  The place has a modern cool feel inside, the service was pretty good and as others have said, no waiting line (which is actually not a great sign on a Friday evening).

My group of 8 was looking for a nice restaurant in the Mission and stumbled upon Regalito.  The photos of the establishment do it justice, it is a nice-looking establishment.  Our party of 8 was seated in an outside patio area which was heated (nice and cozy).  The food, unfortunately, was very disappointing.  Members of our group are connoisseurs of Mexican food, having eaten it from all over the U.S. and in various regions of Mexico, so we were familiar with different styles, but we were incredibly disappointed with the results here.  We started with taquitos, ordering one vegetarian (potato) and one chicken option.  When the server brought over the taquitos, I was handed the first dish which was dentified it as the \"chicken\" dish.  Much to our dismay this was incorrect and our vegetarian ended up having her first bite of chicken in 3 years.  I later took the server aside and told her that though we were \"fine\" with it, in the future it is very important to identify correctly vegetarian from meat dishes (especially in SF).  We then ordered 3 orders of enchiladas (2 green and 1 roja).  There was virtually no cheese in the dish (certainly not melted) and the sauce was not really identifiable - or tasty for that matter.  I ordered the chicken mole, which true to the photo on Yelp, was one leg attached to the thigh.  I enjoyed the mole sauce, but I was not impressed with the dish overall.  Too much bone and skin, not enough sauce - and on top of that, everyone was disappointed in the amount of rice and beans for sides.  One person in our group asked for a few more beans, which arrived in a 1/2 cup-sized bowl, amounting to an added charge to the bill.  Even after the appetizer issue.  Seriously, at a Mexican restaurant, you charge for a side of beans?  We also ordered the carnitas (pork) which was not very flavorful and included no sauce of any kind.  I will give them credit for their tortillas, which are made from corn and thicker than typical, and very flavorful.  But, as mentioned before, with only a smidgen of sauce and beans/rice, it was difficult to wrap up the meat in the tortillas and be satisfied.  We had a child in the group who ordered quesadillas...he didn't like the tortilla or the cheese (no taste).  I think that these folks could improve the experience if they increased their sauces, rice, beans serving sizes, and maybe even offered a bit of lettuce/veg on the table, in case someone wants to add to their dishes.", "author": "Mona N."}

Another reviewer wrote \"bland, Americanized Mexican food\" - and I guess if your only food experience in Mexico was in Cabo San Lucas, then maybe that's true.  and Regalito is not trying to compete with Taqueria's for christs sake. \n\nI think the idea here is actually an upscale twist on more traditional central Mexico dishes.  My dining companion, who spent time in Oaxaca, confirmed that.  the emphasis is more on pork and chicken, less on seafood, and includes central Mexican specialties like cactus.\n\nThe carnitas were indeed to die for, I will be going back for them.  I got the roast chicken with chili and garlic, but I must say the spices are very subtle, almost too much. It is organic chicken, so maybe the idea is just to let the birdie goodness come through.  the only other complaint would be that the cactus salad was so cold it seemed like it came right out of the fridge.  I think that dish is supposed to be closer to room temperature... what the hey it was a slow night and maybe it has to be kept in the fridge.\n\nTable seating is rather limited but it's got the ever-too-popular counter option if you're flying solo, and you can watch the chickens turn in the roaster!

If I'm going to pay $9 for 1/4 chicken with rice and beans, I'd expect the chicken to be juicy. I'm not hard to please really I'm just asking for more flavor. The guacamole was fresh, surprising for this time of year, and the corn chips were crispy and addicting. But here's the thing, I can't help but wonder if regalitos is trying to cater more towards the american palette because the flavors lack that little heat I'm used to. While the guacamole was fresh and good, it lacked that extra flavor. I prefer my guacomole with a bit more lemony tartness and a lot more heat, both of which were sadly missing in action. Perhaps I am just being nitpicky but still I can't help feeling somewhat  disappointed by the blandness of the dishes.\n\nThe desserts however are worth trying. My prefered dessert is the gelato made from Ibarra chocolate. It's both dense and rich, and shockingly it was the first gelato dessert I could not finish. Yes I left half of it untouched, what a waste. I've also heard good things about the tamarindo gelato.

For this review let's play a game of  fact vs. fiction with Mexican Professor Esmar T. Pantalones, shall we?\n\nBienvenido, profesor Pantalones! Ready for question one? According to the website, Regalito's menu got inspired by the type of food you eat at an honest to goodness Mexican Mercado! Fact or fiction, Profesor Pantalones? \n\nProfesor Pantalones: \n\"FALSE! FALSE! Mexico is an enormous country. Traditionally Eurocentric maps favor Europe and the US (Mumbling) horrible colonists countries...by appearing bigger!! Yet Mexico is even bigger than Alaska or Scandinavia at .7 mill square miles. (shaking his finger) Regalito!!! Be specific and show your work! Mexican Markets WHERE? El Centro? El Sureste? El Norte? El Bajio? La peninsula de Yucatan? They are all strikingly different cuisines!!\n\nME: You mentioned Yucatan...what did you think of the Cochinita? It is an authentic staple from the Yucatan peninsula! \n\nPP: As we all know Cochinita is more of a sit down dinner you'll find at a home or a restaurant. Generally it comes wrapped in banana leaves adhering to Maya styles of cooking, and delicately spiced with achiote and bitter orange. It is NOT stall food!!! Regalito's was a little bit greasy. Regalito!! You didn't do your homework!!! Tache!!\n\nME: What about the \"comida corrida\"? Isn't that something you would find in Mexico?? What about the papitas con rajas ($5)? La sopita de fideo ($8)? Y las calabacitas a la Mexicana ($5)?? They are VERY authentic!! I seemed to liked them all just fine. \n\nPP: Yes...but they are something you would eat maybe at a \"FONDA\", not a market. And who would pay those prices for \"FONDA\" food??? Or market food? The only thing you would maybe find at a market in Mexico City would be the Pepitas con chile y limon ($3), along with esquites, alegrias, pepitorias and palanquetas.... all of them mere cents. MEXICAN MARKET FOOD SHOULD BE CHEAP!!\n\nME: OK.....we have to clarify that they use organic produce as much as possible, so I think THE PRICES ARE UNDERSTANDABLE. Besides we are in the US and things are more expensive here. And don't you want our fellow Mexicans working there to get paid reasonably? But let's backtrack for the sake of our non-Mexican amiguitos and amiguitas out there...can you briefly explain what a \"FONDA\" is, professor?\n\nPP: A diner basically. A small neighborhood restaurant. Again, not market food nor gourmet cuisine. At a Mexico City market you would eat stuff like Tlacoyos!! Empanadas de Huitlachoche! Pambazos! Charales! Cuimiles! Sopes! Huaraches!! Jugos y licuados...and..!!\n\nME: Professor, we are getting off topic! Besides, if anyone wants to try *some* of the food you mentioned they could always go to places like \"El Huarache Azteca\" in Oakland...or better yet, go to MEXICO! When it comes to Mexican food, there are always options for everyone. You have to remember that most of our Amiguitos and Amiguitas here are accustomed to \"Tex Mex\" and \"Taqueria\" food...they always want a side of chips with their food. Please understand them...they may not know *anyting* about the diversity of Mexican food....\n\nPP: QUE PENDEJOS!!!\n\nME: Professor, this is a family review! \n\nPP: My madre alway said about chips \"Esas cosas te empanzonan y te llenan, pero no te nutren!\" They are not even Mexican foodl En el Sureste they call them \"totopos\"...and they are round, not triangular...\n\nME: (rolling my eyes) Anyway.... is there something you *did* like at Regalito?\n\nPP: The Fresas con crema. They are apparently a seasonal dessert, not usually on the menu. They are beautiful strawberries with creamy, slightly salty Mexican Crema. If they had a side of \"galletas maria\" I would be transported back to my childhood in Irapuato. And the Ensalada de nopalitos ($8.50) is a good choice for its nutritional value. Nopalitos aid naturally in processing blood sugar, they are good for diabetics. However the ones at Regalito didn't get rinsed enough.  They have to rinse out the gooey roping, specially if they are going to make SALAD! Put them in a colander and rinse them well...then drain them, Regalito!! Minus one point!!\n\nME: (throwing away my note cards) Professor, I had 10 more \"fact vs. fiction\" questions but this is taking way too long...we can't get pass the first question! Besides, I'm the one giving the review!\n\nI'll give this restaurant four stars, because everything was fresh, it was  nicely decorated, and just because they are trying to cook something different....\n\nPP: Pero ni tanto!!\n\nME: The staff was very nice....\n\nPP: You just kept giving the big bear of a waiter \"ojos de borrego a medio morir\"! I saw you!\n\nME: OK, this review is over! Please join us some other time for another game of facts vs. fiction with Professor Esmar T. Pantalones....\n\nMaybe.", "author": "Raul A."}

It's a food lover's paradise, and a recent blossom in this culinary Garden of Eden is Regalito.\n\nWe were on the fence about ordering an appetizer, but our server enticed us into trying the guacamole. (OK, \"entice\" is a rather strong word. I was sold before she got to \"...amole.\") As promised, it was very good, and the fact that it was served not with chips but with crispy corn tortillas hot from the fryer was a really nice touch. The combination of sizzling crispness and tangy-spicy richness was delicious. \n\nFor entrees, we split the Chile Verde and the Pollo De Plaza -- roasted free-range chicken served with enchiladas rojas, potatos and carrots. I'm a big fan of chile verde, and Regalito's rendition is excellent. I'm not sure if green beans are a traditional ingredient in chile verde, but they worked. Also, I don't like too much tang in my chile verde, and this dish had just the right balance. The chicken was pure comfort food: juicy, tender and simply prepared. The carrots, potatoes and enchiladas rojas -- again, very simply prepared -- were satisfying and rounded out the experience.\n\nit also bears mentioning that the sangria was very good.\n\nThe dining room is much smaller than I expected, and we had to sit at the counter to avoid a 25-minute wait. I normally don't like the restaurant counter experience, but I didn't mind it at Regalito. Maybe that's because the service was so attentive and friendly.\n\nI'd like to give Regalito 3.5 stars, but since that's not possible here on Yelp, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and bump it up to 4 stars. (It definitely deserves more than 3 stars.)\n\nI can't wait to try the carnitas next time.", "author": "The Other Jeff A."}

I think they must have about 7 tables, tops?  But what they lack in tables they make up in a good amount of counter space, which I don't mind at all if you are a party of 1 or 2.\n\nI don't know if I would have chosen the Mission for the location of this place, as it is bound to get a lot of flack from the tacqueria-eating die-hards.  I found the modern setting refreshing, and the simple food satisfying, and not coma-inducing like so many other places.\n\nWe started with a carafe of sangria - very tasty with lots of fruit on the bottom.  The guacamole is a huge portion and is served with round crispy tostadas instead of tortilla chips.  We also had the chicken tacquitos which were very good with strips of fresh chicken inside.  \n\nFor my main, I had the Carnitas which were very good.  The portion was ample, not gargantuan, which was nice, and the meat was very tender and had just enough fat for flavor, but not too much. It served with beans, salsa and fresh avocado.  I also ordered a side of Elote which was so so so so good!  Give me some corn on the cob, cover it in cheese and mayonnaise, add spices and you have something bordering on lethal.  \n\nThe rotisserie chickens were mezmerizing me as they rotated on the spit, and I'd definitely stop by to get one for take-out on a week night.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the bread pudding which was pretty good - I would have preferred it a little more crisp, but it was tasty, with chunks of fruit and a scoop of ice cream as a topping.\n\nRegalito is a good choice if you are craving Mexican food, but don't want to feel all bloated and unhealthy afterwards.  The food is simple, the portions reasonable, and you'll have room in your stomach for plenty of beer later.", "author": "Liz S."}

Having already overly high expectations, I was still impressed on my first visit for dinner.  \n\nThis is not a taqueria, it is not cheap food, it is not the place to go if you want quick and dirty tacos from a truck.  I love taco trucks as much as the next guy but sometimes it's nice to sit down to a clean table and have something a bit different than my favorite street taco style fare.  \n\nThe guacamole here is freshly made one serving at a time.  It's simple, not overdone, like you'd make at home but yet Regalito and Colibri seem to be the only restaurants in SF who make it just right. The papas (potatoes) with pasilla chile strips are the other simply elegantly flavored thing here which just don't taste as good anywhere else.  The slow roasted 1/4 chicken I ate was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The seasonings here at Regalito are clearly not designed to explode in your mouth or compete with a taqueria style mexican meal that many people know and love.  The flavors are melded together in complimentary ways to massage the pallet with a slow seduction of savory sensations.\n\nThe agave wine based margarita here was very tasty, a bit sweet for my preferences but to be expected since wine has more fructose than tequila. Agave nectar has such a wonderfully smooth sweetness about it though, so much silkier than regular sugars.\n\nUpdate:\nRegalito is on my list of potential favorites, but I really think they seem to need more than 1 server when it's busy even though it's a small place.  On a few occasions I haven't been satisfied with the flavors of the food, things are bland sometimes.  When they're good they're good though, hope they can get these issues worked out.", "author": "P H I L H."}

The owner Tom\u00e1s was always present. COOKING. He was quiet but focussed on his kitchen. There was dedication and I then though, love for his business.\n\nOur experience at Regalito yesterday left us not wanting to ever set foot in it again. Tom\u00e1s, no longer in charge of his kitchen, or even present. Left it to amateurs who cooked up the most insipid (and overly expensive) collection of disappointments. What's worse. We left with such pain in our stomachs, I couldn't sleep last night. Today, my stomach still on fire. Regalito not only got crossed from our favorites in a matter of seconds, the food was so plain and digestively unsettling that Regalito deserves no stars for actually giving us pain on top of it all.\n\nIf Tom\u00e1s cares for his business he surely must act now.

It's a very small place and luckily a few tables cleared as soon as we walked in. I was super hungry and super excited, especially because I saw them making handmade tortillas...WHA? OMG!! \n\nThe service definitely needs some serious help. The place is so small that we had to prance around the counter just to let customers exit. The waiter half smiled at us when we walked in. I was so confused. Do we sign our name somewhere? Is there a hostess? Do we seat ourselves? We patiently stood by the counter waiting to be acknowledged. After a few minutes the waiter finally came up to us and asked us how many in our party...um just two. He then just walked away. Awkward? No not as awkward as the man playing his guitar 18 inches away. Very nice music but it felt like we were invading his space or like we were interrupting someone's serenade. \n\nFinally we get seated. I was so hungry and excited for the tortillas that I let that ridiculousness slide. The service did get better after that. The guac was very good as were the freshly made tostadas. The enchiladas verdes were SO good! Just the write blend of spicyness. I highly recommend getting this dish!! The mole was also good. The chicken just melted onto your fork and the mole sauce was quite tasty. I just wish that they could marinate the chicken in the mole sauce instead of just pouring it on top. I think it would enhance the flavor of the chicken. With a small resto comes small tables. We eventually got all of our plates to fit but any sudden movement and we could kiss our guac and tostadas goodbye. Too bad I was driving or else I would have enjoyed me a few more glasses of their sangria--SO good!!

In any case, the chicken and its accompanying rice and beans were fine, but this dish's portion was too small. We enjoyed the fried tortillas that we had to break apart ourselves to make chips, but the salsa, of a pico de gallo style, had too many (serrano?) chiles in it for us, and we like spicy food.", "author": "Tara M."}

Or go by yourself, sit at the bar & watch the action. When I was there, there was 1 hostess/dessert maker (learned I could freeze churros from her), 1 tortilla lady, 1 server, 1 grill/sautee/cook & 1 dishwasher. That's about all the people that can fit in their prep space though, & they did a great job of coordination (although only 2 tables & me to wait on)  \n\nI went on a Tuesday night, slightly raining, around 5:15pm, & sat at the bar. Not realizing it was \"pig night\" - when the menu centers around all things pig - I was happily informed they had 2 dishes for non-pig eaters. 1 vegetarian dish & (what I went for) Regalito Pollo. \n\nOMG!! What a fantastic dish! I rarely compare other's chicken to my Dad's (he makes a darn good grilled chicken) but this cook had it down. The chicken was super moist, the skin crunchy in some places & chewy in others, golden brown & a good portion. The swiss chard had garlic chunks & onions laced thru it (LOVE that!) & was sauteed to the point of perfection. The tomato salsa had a nice balance of chuncky tomatoes, onions & a sprinkle of fresh herbs. The tortillas (5! for 1 person!) were fantastic - grilled to doneness without being dry. You could even taste the corn! When asked, I was told to cut up the chicken then make tortillas/wraps out of them. With the squeeze of lime to give it the final touch, these tortillas were heaven. The corn tortillas held up to the sauce from the vegs/lime. I ate 2 that way then ate the rest of the chicken & sides as is....a heavenly plate of texture, spice/flavoring, and well-prepared food. Hard to ask for anything more. \n\nI'll happily go back and tell others to keep this place in business for many more years.", "author": "Marissa H."}

Sometimes, I can't help myself, like Hard Knox Cafe, and I have to go home and talk about how miserable it was.\n\nThat wasn't the case with Regalito.  We walked away with a distinct feeling of \"meh\", disappointing in light of how close it is to the boyfriend's house.  The interior is adorable.  Man Candy's enchilada was too hot, the green beans and chicken I ordered was nothing that I couldn't have pulled together in my own kitchen, if I wasn't so lazy.  The pumpkin seeds were a bright spot, but again...I wasn't raised to be this lazy, I'm eschewing my genetic code.\n\nBut I AM that lazy.  That would be too lazy to walk to Dosa on a cold night (an additional four blocks away) and the Chron had just run a review that talked about how the experience got better each of the three times that they visited, and that they dialed the flavors up.  My whining won out, and we ordered a boatload of food-chile rillenos for the MC, green beans, and some chicken, potatoes, carrots and enchilada thing for me.  And taquitos, the potato kind.  We were going for broke.  Starch central!  \n\nIt was quite good. Really, all of it was.  During the intial visit, plates were both spicy and unflavorful.  Now, they're just using fresh ingredients and letting the food speak for itself.  Just in case we were too hungry to judge, I heated up the leftovers tonight-and they were still good!  Even the rice and beans (which came with the chile rilleno and I dumped some TJ's salsa on before I put it in the microwave.\n\nI can't speak for the service, but I can assure you it's being added to the take out rotation.

I could see if it was before we had been served our orders or well after we were done and our plates were cleared, but damn, while we're eating?!

Yeah, that didn't make us feel rushed or anything. *rolls eyes*\n\nFlan is $8 and it's not even good. The sauce is too sharp and thus throws off the flavor balance of creamy/sweet that flan is supposed to have. Weak. And by the way, if you are vegetarian, dont eat the rice because it has chicken stock in it. \n\nThe only good thing they had going on was the interior design.

It's like kool aid with a few tiny pieces of orange in it. This continued the run of shitty sangria I've had in this town.

They have raised their prices from what's listed on menupages - and for no good reason. The food was average or below. The prices were above. I'm no mathematician, but that doesn't add up. My chille relleno was drowning in a really watery sauce - which makes no sense bc you fry something so it will be crispy (ideally) - but then you dump it in a watery sauce so it becomes a mushy mess? And, it still had no flavor. \n\nBeware - the \"quesadillas\" are actually empanadas and they rest on a bed of very spicy sauce. It was the only item I enjoyed (all 2 bites worth), but it almost took my man down. He's delicate.\n\nThe guac was just ok - lacking flavor punch, and served with the now infamous 3 fried tortillas. Luckily a nice busboy stopped and offered us a couple more so we could polish off our average guac.\n\nSomeone in the kitchen must be on a low sodium diet bc everything seemed to lack salt - and they don't even have salt shakers on the tables. I didn't bother asking for one for fear of getting charged.\n\nThe thing is, I would have paid the money and put up with the service if the food had been great - I would love to support a new local place trying to make it happen in the Mission.

The taqueria culture here is pretty low-rent, where even mediocre joints are propped up as the \"best\" or \"tastiest\" or whatever.\n\nSo, it was with resignation that we sat down at a table at Regalito and pored over their promising (aren't they all?) menu.\n\nMuch to my surprise, the food was not only good, but good enough for me to want to return for at least a second try.  Let me qualify that by saying that I didn't find the food amazing or great by any measure, but it had heart and the quality of ingredients and cooking improved my mood.\n\nOur lovely waitress was friendly and eager to suggest items.  Boyfriend ordered Pollo con Mole Negro.  I've had the pleasure of eating extraordinary, hand-made mole and was impressed at how close to perfection Regalito got it.  I only tasted the sauce, not the chicken, so I can't comment on the whole dish. Boyfriend enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nI had Cochinita Pibil, which is (to quote their menu) slow roasted, banana leaf wrapped, citrus & achiote marinated pork garnished with onions and cilantro.  The flavor profile was exquisite, which is a fancy way of saying the sauce and flavorings were spot on.  I wish the pork had been just a tad more succulent.\n\nThe taquitos were nothing to write home about, but I often react  that way to taquitos because their contents are often dry and uninteresting.  Can someone tell me if taquitos are anything more than crunch buried in sauciness?", "author": "Andrew L."}

(Especially when I am hiking and just had chalky Cliff Bars)\n\nAfter hiking all around Muir woods on Saturday morning a group of us decided to try out this semi-new restaurant. There was 7 of us and the first waiter told us they only had seats available at the bar. Then the second waiter sat us at a table in the corner. (Granted this place only has like five tables so our party was very large, in fact they used all the unused chairs at all the rest of the tables to seat us). \n\nThroughout the meal it was clear that the waiters were not communicating which definitely made the service suffer.\n\nWe got Guacamole to start which was served with a small amount of flat bread. The Guac was decent but definitely nothing to write home about and the serving of carbs was horrendously small.\n\nThe dishes we order spanned the small menu. Several people got breakfast which were basically Mexican scrambles. Probably the breakfast items were the best out of the dishes. I had the cactus salad which was simply cactus and salsa. It was good but unimaginative. Several people in the group tried the rotisserie chicken. The skin was a bit rubbery, it had no distinctive flavors, and not very tender.  Finally the last person in the group had a pork dish which they were sourly disappointed with.  She thought it tough and salty.\n\nAll in all I was disappointed. I thought the concept interesting and was excited to try a new variation on an old stand by (Latin Food).", "author": "Courtney R."}

I appreciate it was free range, but they should do the bird some respect in making it juicy and delicious, so we may enjoy this bird in all its glory.\n\nAlthough they were generally polite, the service is slow, forgetful and amateurish. I was annoyed when our server did not do a last check in before putting our bill on the table, prominently standing up, then he came back asking to pay up so he could cash out. That was either rude, or dumb, if he didn't realize what he was doing. They forgot our tortillas with our food, but did finally bring the bland things to us. They forgot other things we asked for till we reminded them. I hate that... It makes me feel like I'm being a pest. I also don't like paying $3.50 for coffee and getting only milk, but no half and half (but that's just me).\n\nIf Regalito can step up on the flavor and service, I'll come back here.

It's small, but not too small, the service is fast and friendly, and the food is really good. \n\nWhen I think of all the different Mexican restaurants in San Francisco, Regalito is probably the best.  The food is fresh, clean, authentic, and affordable.  There are probably people who will say Regalito is for only for gringos and that may be true.  Since I am a gringo, I don't have a problem with that.\n\nThere are so many good Mexican restaurants in the Bay Area.  There's old school places like Tommy's on Geary, Puerto Allegre, Los Jarritos,or even Mi Lindo Yucutan.  Taco trucks like El Tonayense or tacquerias like La Tacqueria, El Farolito, and Cancun.  Then there's overpriced restaurants for yuppies like Dona Tomas or Tres Agaves. \n\nTo me, Regalito stands above and beyond all of these.  There are probably some people who aren't willing to pay a little more for Mexican food.  However, when you consider the high quality of the food, the freshness of their ingredients, good deseign, and excellent service I can understand why they have to make up for it.  \n\nI think Regalito is worth it and hope it stays around for a long time.", "author": "Ezra Y."}

The list is small but everything I've had has been really quite good.\n\nI think the sides and apps here tend to be the stars of the show -- on a previous visit I'd had the spiced pepitas, which kick ass. Also tried the fried tortillas (aka big ol' chips) and guac -- not too bad! And, I must say, the rice and beans that came with my chicken were somehow divine -- flavorful, perfectly fluffy rice; perfect ratio of rice to beans. It's hard to get something so simple so right, since everybody does it.\n\nI was frankly less impressed with the chicken, which I'd say was only okay. The skin was loose and flabby; I prefer at least part of the chicken skin to show that it's been, well . . . roasted.

Yum! (oh, and I had two desserts again...damn them!)\n\nChef Tomas of Regalito has got something good going on in the Mission.  Mole with depth and silky richness, flautas that are crispy and delicate without being too heavy - also with a veggie friendly option of potato and cheese.  The house lime-ade is perky with mint and very refreshing.\n\nI hate to admit it, because I am a delicate flower of a girl, but I had two desserts.  (Shameful) the bread pudding had layers of flavor including fabulous vanilla ice cream, apples, almonds, cheese (yes, cheese) and spices.  And also the Flan.  I am very picky about flan.  This is excellent flan people - Chef Tomas has played with the recipe for the last 6 weeks and its finally perfect.. I however, loved every version I tried.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-07-20", "description": "First, let's talk about the tequila issue.  Personally, I don't believe any decent sit-down mexican joint can exist without tequila.  Little taquerias where you go to get your burrito and taco fix are exempt from this, of course.  El Castilito and Papalote are great for a quick bite, especially after a ride, and beer is just fine.  \n\nBut for a nicer place when you want a big plate of food with beans and rice and everything else, you must have tequila for the margaritas.  The agave wine they serve with their \"margaritas\" is an affront to all that is right and holy about good mexican.  First, it tastes like crap and second, get ready for the headache that comes before you leave the restaurant from such cheap, poorly made wine.\n\nNow I understand that they don't have a liquor license, which may be beyond their control, but that doesn't make it right.  And what's worse than not having tequila for a margarita, is putting margaritas on your menu when you don't have tequila!  It's like advertising you have beer, but then only serving non-alcoholic brew.  Es muy malo! \n\nAs for the food, not that impressed.  I had the carnitas which came out very dry served with beans and salsa.  Not nearly enough beans were served and they were mediocre.  There were big chunks of pork, but\nwithout enough carbs to go with it, it was not a very satisfying meal - and like I said, quite dry, like a desert in my mouth.\n\nA friend had the chicken mole.  It wasn't bad - the mole was spicy with good flavor.  The guacamole was pretty good and like some of the other reviewers, we had to ask for more of their giant chips.  The Barbera wine was  good and very reasonable at $23 and the girl serving us was generally attentive and accommodating.  The prices seemed reasonable too.\n\nOverall, not a bad place, but you have to ask yourself, with so many excellent mexican places around, what's the point?  They are obviously trying not to be a simple down-home mexican food place with enchiladas and chimichangas.. Their menu is smallish and tries to offer something a little higher-end, but without the tequila or great execution of what they do offer, it just falls flat for me.", "author": "Eric F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "Like many people who have grown up in California, I have been eating Mexican food my whole life.  I have traveled extensively throughout Mexico, lived in Los Angeles, and have been eating and cooking Mexican food for as long as I can remember.   \n\nWhen I came across Regalito, I was thrilled to see a beautiful, classy restaurant that embodies my values in serving free-range, organic chicken with local ingredients.  I had high hopes that Regalito would demonstrate the breadth of Mexican cooking beyond what is typically found in the taqueria.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  I felt that too many elements were not fresh (commercial tortillas!), lacked flavor, and disappointed in execution.   The kitchen is open to seats at the bar, and if I hadn't seen my meal being made in front of me, I might question my disappointment.   \n\nWe started with Chicken Taquitos and Ensalada de Nopalitos (cactus).  The taquitos were pulled our of a warming tray below the stove, and warmed before serving.  Flavorless, not crispy, and you can get better for a third of the price anywhere on the block.  The Ensalada de Nopalitos was basically nopalitos out of a jar, thrown on to the grill for a minute, with salsa on top.  Nothing special about this, nothing you couldn't do in your house, and for $8.50, I expected better (a big jar costs about $2.50 at any grocery store).  \n\nThe reason Regalito gets two stars instead of none is their Cochinita Pibil (slow-cooked pork served in a banana leaf).  This was the only thing I tried that one can't find down the street better and cheaper in any taqueria, and it was AWESOME.  Flavorful, cooked to perfection, and made up for the tortillas not being fresh or homemade.  \n\nDessert was the last straw with the lack of freshness here.  We had the Capirotada (warm bread pudding with vanilla ice cream).  Upon ordering, we found out that they were out of vanilla ice cream, and only had mango or avocado.  We ordered the avocado on the side, which was great, but definitely didn't go with bread pudding with apples and raisins.  It became obvious that the bread pudding came from the fridge, the inside was cold.  Maybe not microwaved for long enough?  I can't believe that I'm writing that about a $7.00 dessert that was already missing its ice cream.  \n\nI want to say something good here, for the sake of their amazing Cochinita Pibil, but for the size of our bill, I was pretty disappointed.  Maybe breakfast would be better?  \n\nI would recommend that this place think carefully about what it is trying to do and figure out how to make itself better than any taqueria down the street.  Homemade tortillas, attention to detail, and making taqueria favorites stand out would be a good start.", "author": "Emily S."}

The inside is small and a wee bit crowded, but it feels cozy and is decorated in nice citrus colors. \n\nWe started with some chips and delicious homemade salsa, after which I had the best tortilla soup I've ever tasted. All too often I find that the tortilla strips are soggy, the avocado is tasteless and the flavors of the soup are unintelligible. Not so at Regalito. Their's is absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it. Next came the cactus salad... good, but not really my cup of tea. I liked the queso fresco and fresh avocado, but the cactus itself didn't really do it for me. It was sort of pickled-tasting and had an odd texture. However, I think that is more just my own personal aversion to cactus and not the restaurant's fault. My dining companion had the pulled pork, which she was kind enough to share with me, and it was delicious as well, although a bit on the oily side.\n\nAll in all I think this a great little spot, although I think I'd recommend going when they're not too busy, as the seemed a little overwhelmed by the crowds and our service wasn't great.", "author": "Lindsey S."}

Since the place is named for rotisserie I expected this little bird to be ripe with flavor, tender and moist, like a slow-cooked hen should be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-25", "description": "So I had a first date at Regalito.  I had just returned from Japan that week and a month without authentic SF mission Mexican cuisine had put my culinary palette in an uproar.  Moreover, hiking around Mt. Tam for most of the afternoon gave First Date and I two Hungry Man Meal - sized appetites. \n\nStill undecided upon Regalito,  I pulled into the bus stop in front of Regalito as First Date went into the restaurant to assess the reservation situation and menu. He exited Regalito with two thumbs up.  Hopping back into the care excitedly, First Date relayed that he tried to make a reservation, but they insisted that currently we didn't need one, so he told them that we were coming back and just needed to find a parking space.   We did parking reconnaissance  for 30 minutes and considered ordering a bevi from Farina in order to make use of their valet parking lot next door to Regalito before finding a park in front of the theater on 17th Street off of South Van Ness where I saw a poetry slam judged by Beth Lisick back in the mid '90s.\n\nWith appetites in hand, First Date and I walked into Regalito.   Recognizing First Date, the host  promised us expedient seating. \n\n\"It wasn't this crowded when I came in here .  I would have made reservations,\" First Date said with a tinge of disappointment.  \n\nSome time later, the host remorsefully informed us that only bar seating, which I am not a fan of, was available.  Hunger and my desire to make a good first impression superseded.  We gingerly took our seats at the bar facing the two man/one tortilla lady kitchen. \n\nI went to the bathroom and implored First Date to order apps.  Upon my return from Regalito's poorly lit and sparsely decorated excuse for a bathroom, First Date informed me that despite valiant efforts, he had yet to order apps.  After a couple minutes, the host, now our waiter or \"haiter,\" greeted us and began reciting the Regalito schpeel  when he stopped himself midsentence and apologetically informed us that he had to seat an incoming group of patrons and would return shortly.\n\nFirst Date and I exchanged a silent glance that said, \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"He's lucky he's cute,\" First Date said as I nodded in agreement. \n\nAs the bottomless water with lime, made possible by the deft front house help, quenched my hike - parched throat our haiter returned.  He succinctly extrapolated the specials from memory and when I asked for a replay of the last dish he  delved into a culinary monologue describing the lamb shank in a apricot/avocado leaf sauce served with  beans and rice, the earthy taste given to the sauce by the avocado leaf, and the regions from which the other elements of the dish hailed.  At the end I was sure whether to order or clap.  All things considered I order the lamb shank special and First Date ordered our Tortilla Soup, nopalitos salad, and the Regalito lime marinaded chicken with sauteed greens for his entree.\n\nFirst Date commented that the bar seating was terribly undesirable for conversation, let alone a first date, but we made the most of it and enjoyed ourselves despite the constant traffic of restaurant staff visiting the bar to pick up entrees and apps on their way to hungry patrons.\n\nThe warm nopalitos salad with grilled cactus was really tasty and well grilled. It provided a good contrast to the tepid onion,\ntomatoes, and garlic and cold queso [super] fresco and avocado.  I usually stick to nondairy cheeses, but the queso [super] fresco had me asking our haiter if they had a quesero in the back.  The tortilla Soup was pleasantly spicy without numbing your taste buds and and flavorful, but despite being made from chicken broth I didn't taste any hint of  chicken. To each their own, I like a little bit of chicken in my chicken broth.\n\nFirst Date's chicken was well prepared, doubtless to say - they know how to roast chicken, but he found the meat to be dry.\n\nUpon tasting, I agreed and also noted that Regalito had some how made lime marinade synonymous with bland.  \n\nI was excited about my lamb shank, but my elation found no cause.  The lamb shank was an excellent cut of meat with little fat and a average amount of meat on the bone comparable to a small turkey drumstick, but First Date found the meat to be a bit dry.  We both found the apricot/avocado leaf sauce covering the lamb terribly disappointing.  Only the color of the sauce recalled the apricot from our haiter's expounding .  The earthiness of the sauce attributed to the avocado leaf over powered any other flavors the chef attempted to bring out of the dish.  The whole pinto beans and rice lacked flavor and added nothing to the meal.  I tried them several times independently and with different combinations of chicken, lamb, and apricot sauce on tortillas to no avail.  But at least the tortillas were good.

The taquitos were served with an amazing salsa that saved them -- otherwise, they were (surprise, surprise) somewhat bland.\n\nThe flan was excellent.  The french-press coffee was well done.  \n\nIf the food were more consistently flavorful, I would be happy to return many times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-24", "description": "I noticed lately that most of my reviews on Yelp are 4 or 5 stars, but this restaurant ain't gettin' close to that.  I am so very grouchy about this restaurant, for many reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is unacceptably overpriced for what you get:\n- $19 for three shrimp enchiladas with very little shrimp in them.  The red sauce was unpleasantly bitter, and the asparagus did not work with the dish at all. \n- Dishes come with a *small* side of rice and pinto beans.  No choice of type of beans.\n- Coupled with a $10 glass of wine, this meant a $30something dinner/person for subpar food.   I was so underwhelmed with the food that I would have been grouchy even if the charge was only half as high.\n- No complimentary chips and salsa or other appetizers, making the value even poorer.\n\nNext, service was acceptable in some ways but poor in others.  No one acknowledged us when we walked into the restaurant, despite the fact that it was less than half-full.  However, I will concede that it was friendly once we were seated.  Belatedly-commenced friendly service, however, cannot redeem a poor-tasting, overpriced meal.\n\nFinally, the one thing that I was really looking forward to was a margarita ... but they didn't have margaritas or other liquor-based drinks on the menu.  Only after I had ordered a glass of wine did I read the Yelp reviews - and realize that apparently they are clandestinely selling margaritas, if you know to ask for them.  My guess is that they're trying to get around the lack of a full liquor license.  Whatever the case may be, I didn't get the Mexican food + margarita I was looking forward to, and I am tres grouchy.  We thought we'd found a convenient alternative to waiting 30 minutes for a table at Tacolicious, late on a weeknight ... but it turns out that T-lish warrants the wait; this place isn't worth paying for or waiting for, especially in the Mission, with so many amazing alternatives a stone's throw away.  Given the number of excellent other choices, I predict that this restaurant will have a richly-deserved CLOSED indicator on Yelp in the future.", "author": "B L."}

Oh wait, they don't give you chips!  Forgive me for thinking every Mexican restaurant must have chips, in my mind it's like the 11th commandment.  So, we started out with the house-made chorizo and potatoes; this was not bad, didn't make my tongue do somersaults or anything, but the potatoes were cooked well and the chorizo, nice and spicy.  Accompanying the chorizo, we had the nopalitos salad, which was a bit bland and uninspired.  Like it was described in the menu, it's nopalitos and salsa, comes out cold and a bit slimy.  For our main, we had the Elote (grilled corn on the cob).  This was definitely the highlight of the meal, well grilled, sweet corn, melted cheese, lime and spices, YUM!  Alongside the elote, we shared a plate of Cochinita Pibil, and though this sounded good in writing, in execution it was a bit lacking; for citrus and achiote paste marinated pork, it was a bit bland, but at least tender, but my tongue wanted more.  Oh yeah, the tortillas were not bad.\n\nI know, you're here for the low down on the restroom.  I felt like this restroom was not up to the standards in I had set after seeing the modern decor of the interior of the restaurant proper.  It felt like they didn't put any thought or feeling into making this important room a comfortable escape for hand washing or bladder relieving, it was cold an uninviting.  At least it was clean and well kept, but i didn't like the cleaning station in the corner with the little-person shower thing.  It makes the place seam a bit lower class than it tries to be.     \n\nAll in all, RR is a cute but small place, the service was OK and i like the open kitchen, I think I would have been happy to watch the cooks from a bar seat, if we had been forced to sit at one.  However, for having unexciting food I will stick to the more affordable taquerias next time I hunger in the Mission for some south of the border treats (or the bacon wrapped hot dog cart).", "author": "Adrian L."}

While the salsa could have used more salt and a little more zing, I liked the freshly fried corn tortilla that they used as the chips. It was a new twist on chips and salsa. I had the Enchiladas Rojas ($13.50) and Elote ($6) as a side. My enchilladas were above average and the Elote was FANTASTIC. I'm not sure I've tasted corn like this before and I would return to this restaurant just for the Elote which is Grilled Corn on the Cob, Grated Cotija cheese, mayonnaise, lime and Arbol chile powder.\n\nThe downside of this place was the service. My husband and I received our main dishes at least five minutes apart, so, I felt bad eating my food before him. In addition, his entree was supposed to come with beans and rice, but, they never brought any. Since he felt lucky just to get his food, he didn't complain. I got my sides several minutes after my main arrived. I don't understand why they can't bring my main and side at the same time!

I think this place can pull it together and move from very average to better than average eatery.  I sensed a real desire to please on the part of everyone, hence the three stars.  Without that sense, probably would've given it one or two stars.\n\nThe lowdown:\nStarter - potato dish was EXCELLENT and got me excited for the rest of the meal.\nFood - had the carne chile colorado (not exact name). Server said it was verya spicy but I love spicy food.  He was right.  It was terribly spicy, so much so that I couldn't figure out the point.  The spice wasn't highlighting some flavor, it was just burning my mouth.\nWine - had a glass of Malbec that was very enjoyable but something of a light pour for $8.  Then my partner got the same wine and it didn't taste anything like the glass I had.  This fact isn't figured into my rating because I honestly don't know if it tasted different because most of my taste buds were dealing with being spiced to death.\nService - super friendly and one of the biggest pluses.  Everyone was very nice.  But, the restaurant was less than half full and there was a ratio of less than 3 tables per server and I saw food sitting a long time at the counter waiting for delivery.

I really wish that we hadn't waited until the end of the semester to check this place out, their food kicks ass!\n\nRegalito was serving their special Tuesday \"Pigalito\" menu, along with a couple of specials. We scored a 9:30 reso on Open Table, and the parking gods bestowed upon us a spot right in front on 18th St. We were warmly greeted upon walking in, and there were 3 other occupied tables in an otherwise uncrowded restaurant. Luckily, the coziness of the space gave the place an upbeat vibe, perfect for celebrating the end of 4 months worth of homework and cramming for exams.\n\nI ordered the pork shank off the Pigalito menu, while the lady went with the chicken enchiladas off the specials menu. The pork shank was the best this side of the revered O'Reilly's Holy Grail (seriously the best restaurant ever to walk the face of the earth), fall off the bone tender but not at all overly fatty. It was bathed in a very spicy, complex sauce which struck just the perfect balance between flavor and heat. It was mucho caliente y mucho delicioso (did I mention I got a C in the Spanish class?). Las enchiladas con mi amor were 3 overstuffed flour tortillas bursting at the seams with pollo and topped with a mild green tomatillo sauce and sour cream. Our super-cool waiter brought us a huge bowl of rice and beans to share as well as their special hot salsa. The beans were perfectly cooked and added another layer of depth to both dishes. My puerco definitely did not need the salsa, but wifey said it rounded out her enchiladas (which she did admit would have been a teench underseasoned and bland otherwise).\n\nWe passed on dessert, as the dinner portions were just enough where you felt full yet would be overstuffed with sweets.

The manager made it clear that the burden of proof was on us: who did we talk to, when did we call, etc.  Not an iota of responsibility or regret , no attempt to make it right.  Told him this was not OK and I would probably not be coming back. His response:  \"that's fine with me.\"\nThere were other major problems as well: 1) Sitting at the counter  (no table for us), we had a clear view of the kitchen . One employee was using her hands extensively in food prep: stuffing peppers, shaping dough for tortillas, etc.  All this and more ..........without wearing gloves.  Maybe not a code violation but definitely unappetizing. 2) Manager informed us  we'd be charged tax on the entire value of the meal, not the Groupon purchase price.  Not sure this is even legal but it has never happened anywhere else -- and we use lots of Groupons.\nFood was OK - service slow - but  the best dinner ever would not get me back.", "author": "Nancy L."}

Both times I visited were with a Groupon.  If it weren't for the second Groupon, I definitely would not have gone back.  The food was decent, but very bland.  Of all the dishes I have tasted in my day, this is some of the blandest food I've had in a SF restaurant.  In addition - it's super pricey!  You definitely don't get what you pay for.  I'm glad I didn't come here and pay full price.  I had the half chicken on my first visit and the flank steak on my second visit.  I was able to also taste the green enchiladas, red enchiladas, and a shredded chicken dish.  All were just meh.  Nothing mind-blowing.  The service is attentive, and the drinks are tasty (but again, expensive for what you get).  I did enjoy a glass of their sangria.  While it was a clean, filling meal (dinner on both occasions), I know that I won't be back.  There are too many other wonderful places to eat in SF that offer better food and a better experience.", "author": "Jenna C."}

The restaurant is small, but designed well. The design concept of the restaurant was inspired by the name \"Regalito\" meaning \"little gift\" in Spanish. There is even a \"ribbon\" of contrasting material/color that wraps around the entire space. The kitchen is divided from the diners by a glass sneeze guard so you can see everything as it is prepared. The owner was in the kitchen with his staff and was very friendly with all the customers.

I like the long bar seating area where I sat by myself next to the kitchen.  I started with a black bean soup, which was delicious.  Had a bunch of avacado in it as well as some nice cilantro and seasoning.  From there, I was excited about the main dish.\nI ordered the Chicken Mole, in which the mole recipe came from Oaxaca, in which I've been.  I was less than happy with it.  The mole was just OK and there was only enough to cover the chicken, so I had to order more.  The chicken was dry and flavorless and even with the extra mole sauce I had problems finishing it.  Also, the chicken was so large that it was hard to manage it on the size plate they serve it with.  Kind of strange for a rotisserie place, but to me, it seemed like they took it off the rotisserie a few hours ago before they served it.  They should take some lessons from the Limon rotisserie (there, the chicken was delicious, even without the sauce).  Service was good though.  Not sure I'd come back after that.", "author": "Mitch A."}

When my  friend suggested it I was excited to go and try it.  We scanned the small menu and decided to go for the guacamole when we saw it on someone elses table. It does seem expensive but it was obviously fresh and made to order. Not like some other joints whose guac tastes refridgerated and scooped out of a big tub. This homemade quality  justifies the extra dollar or two for me. Also it was well seasoned. It wasn't spicy, but it wasn't bland either. \n\nI decided to get a little meaty and ordered the spiced pork leg. It came with rice and whole beans. I tasted the beans first and again thought they were well seasoned with salt if nothing else. The rice didn't have a lot going for it. It was somewhat overcooked and had no other discernable flavor other than salt. I'm not saying that the meal was over salty, just that there was no depth of flavor and salt was the only seasoning. Living in the Mission, I have come to expect some spice and heat from my Mexican food. Unfortunately my whole plate was completely bland and underwhelming. The service however was beautiful and friendly and helpful. I was brought limes and salsa when I asked. I was brought tortillas even though I hadn't asked and they are a separate  a la carte item.  So A+ for service.\n\nLuckily my dining partner ordered the enchiladas verdes which did have heat,  was seasoned well and was very tasty.  I think Regalito has a future in the Mission but they really need to taste their food before they send it out. They won't last long unless they up the flavor and possibly the heat of their offerings.Consistency is key here. They have everything else.", "author": "Claire K."}

We were a little wary at first as we were almost the only people in the place (seats maybe 30 people total inside) at 7PM on a Thursday night, but it quickly filled up so by the time we left at 8PM, it was pretty full.  They had 3-4 tables set up to eat and drink outside as well.  The waitstaff was super friendly when we arrived and during the entire meal.  We ordered the cactus salad and 2 chicken dishes that were all very good - everything came with freshly made tortillas, but they have no dishes with seafood or steak.  We had so much food left over that I would recommend  2 people only need an appetizer and an entree to split.  The agave margarita carafe was a little too acidic for us, but that might be because there was so much of it for us to drink.  We paid $78, but our bill could have easily been under $40 without the drinks and extra entree.  Definitely will be back!", "author": "Luke L."}

Both entrees were boring and the server turned his back when I told him we were ready to order our food and did not come back until he had our drinks in hand about 10 minutes later. I know he heard me so is that being overly-picky?

The grilled Cactus salad ($7) was served with salsa and cheese and all the flavors and textures did not blend right...they should have added something crunchy like tortilla chips to balance out the soft succulence of the cactus. As for the main course, the Mole sauce ($16) fue muy fabuloso, just the right combination of cacao, fruits and spice, pero...the Chicken was dryer than the Sonoran desert. The homemade Habanero - well balanced and flavorful but could be mas picante.  In short, overpriced Mexican comfort food, but with fresh organic ingredients.

First of all it was freezing inside, and the cold metal chairs and table did nothing to help this...  We ordered a few beers and checked out the menu.  I was a bit surprised...  I think it is a little pretentious of a mexican place to go al  a carte unless the food is spectacular (which it isn't).  I mean, what sort of place feeds you mexican food without either free chips and salsa, or free rice and beans - what is it, five cents a customer to make a big vat of beans and rice at the beginning of the night?    Anyway, we decided to order (for $3 bucks or something) some chips and salsa.  \n   The chips and salsa came and it was very spicy, which was nice, but there was a huge bowl of salsa and THREE round chips.  Three? are you kidding me?  At least they were a few inches in diameter, but still, breaking them into tiny pieces i only got maybe four bites. Not starting off to a good start...\n   Then the red enchilatas came out and I was floored.  They were literally three small tortillas folded over into quarters with enchilata sauce on top with NOTHING inside. huh?   For $7-8,  all I get is three tortillas with sauce????    nothing, no cheese or anything?  plus the sauce was chalky. a few bites and i was done.\n   After that experience we asked the server if he could put some cheese or something in the green enchilatas.  So we got three little enchilatas with some cold cotija inside... hmm these were ok but still not worth the $7+ bucks.  The green beans were actualy good, but the potatoes were swimming in butter and not all that good.\n  All in all, there was no ambiance, it was cold, over-priced ( bill was about $50 bucks for about a cup of veges, a bowl of salsa and about nine tortillas with sauce... is this some sort of sick joke???) and the food was not flavorful and boring.

We were told he could, so we made the choice to stay. \n\nThe place is pretty cute inside, and they have a decent variety of dishes in the menu. The pumpkin seeds were excellent, the green beans were nice too. They made our vegan friend a grilled zucchini dish and all seemed great. \n\nAt some point while we were chowing down, our waiter brought over some beans and rice and told us that there was chicken stock in the rice as a warning. Knowing that we were all vegetarian we wondered why he brought it to us. I let him know we wouldn't be needing these sides as none of us could eat it. Then, he stopped our friend from eating her chile relleno as she was about to swallow the fork and everything on it. These words, verbatim, actually came out of his mouth. \"What kind of vegetarians are you?\" Her response, \"The kind that doesn't eat meat.\" There was some squabbling about why the dish is asteriked as vegetarian on the menu (a question still unanswered) and we learned from our waiter's explanation that there are apparently many kinds of vegetarians and some vegetarians eat chicken. This is strange because I know a lot of vegetarians, but not a single one like that. People may have their own diets and rules, but in a restaurant, it's normally safe to say that anything marked vegetarian would be lacto-ovo. \n\nThe attempt to provide information to veg customers doesn't go unappreciated, but I strongly disagree with the answers we were given about their choice to asterik the menu item. Considering many other vegetarian customers may have ordered this dish in the past,  it's probably safe to assume that loads of people have uknowingly eaten their meals here doused in chicken broth. \n\nI was too disgusted by this experience to ever have the trust to return.", "author": "aaron f."}

The quacamole is ample with fresh salsa and served with whole fried corn tortillas. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would considering I'm not a huge fan of salsa (I'm getting better at this). But the fried potatoes with the chorizo, queso fresco and crema was a clear winner amongst all of us. I could eat a whole plate of this...\n\nAnother carafe of the fabulous sangria came with the four entr\u00e9es of the evening. One special of the evening, roast lamb with New Mexico chili sauce, Enchiladas Verdes, chile relleno de Calabazas y Maiz, and Cochinita Pibil.  The enchiladas were served with whole pintos and fine, but too cilantro-laden for enjoyment by yours truly. The Chile Relleno was my order and was stuffed with queso Oaxaca, squash, corn and garnished with ranchera sauce and cream. I could tell that it was good, but a bit on the spicy side for me. I also ordered a side of carnitas just because I tend to always want to taste a restaurant's carnitas. It was very good and served with some black beans. The lamb was very tender and quite rich. But for me, the dish of the evening was the Cochinita Pibil; slow-roasted, banana leaf wrapped, citrus and achiote marinated pork with habanero pickled red onions. LOVED that dish...\n\nTwo desserts were shared over coffee; the churros with hot chocolate and Capirotada, warm bread pudding with apples, raisins, nuts & jack cheese - topped\nwith Mexican vanilla ice cream. The bread pudding was HUGE and while I enjoyed the caramel sauce, it was a bit on the gummy side. Everyone loved the churros as well. They were obviously very fresh, but a still a bit gooey on the inside, I thought. The hot chocolate was superb. With tip, $50 a person.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

Thank you to my golf clubs.\nIt was my pricey set of golf clubs in the back of my jeep that caused us to drive past our targeted restaurant to the parking lot adjacent to Regalito.  It was raining, we saw the signs....end of story (or beginning).\nThe host welcomed us into the restaurant wearing his backwards hat and speaking perfect English.  I began to worry a bit.  We double checked that they served margaritas, as that was the night's primary objective, and were told they use agave cactus wine instead of tequila.  At this point i was very worried about this place.\nAfter a 10 minute wait, during which time the cooks gave us samples of the special wine, we were seated at one of the few tables.  The food, drinks, and service that followed were pure bliss.  \nIt turns out that the host is fluent in both languages and their 25% alcohol margaritas are excellent and don't destroy your taste buds before dinner.  The food contained by far the freshest ingredients I've had at a Mexican restaurant, including the swanky ones.   The modest prices reflect the premium ingredients, nothing else.  Even though we all cleaned our plates, which included beef, pork, and chicken enchiladas, we didn't have that 3-lb burrito feeling that is always due to cooking with lard and 1-2 day old ingredients.  Regalito also doesn't need to compensate for taste with enormous portions.  Instead they spend the time to arrange smaller plates with traditional sides.  They are aware of how good their meats are and that you do not need to drown them in beans and salsa for flavor.\nSo yeah, this place is great and i hope it doesn't get too popular for the walk-in crowd.", "author": "Gavin D."}

I ordered the half chicken and I was completely underwhelmed when it came out.  The skin was all soggy and gross looking and incomplete, to boot.  A huge section of the skin of the chicken breast was missing and the meat had been prodded around in and damaged, I'm assuming to determine if it was fully cooked, but who knows.  They tried to hide this catastrophe behind the other piece of chicken, as if I wasn't going to notice.  I sent it back without touching it and had it taken off the bill.  My girlfriend's tinga de pollo was awful - greyish pieces of chicken in limp sauteed onions.  At $16.00 a serving, you expect a lot more. It didn't stack up to even the cheapest Mission burrito spots. Won't return.", "author": "Karthi X."}

Totally acceptable despite what the other reviewers have written.  My critique lies in the food.  I think it has potential, but there was little to no taste in any of the dishes we had.  My friend ordered the Rojas enchiladas and there was nothing inside the tortilla.  Everything, which was not much, was thinly layered on top of 4 tortillas.  My other friend ordered the Tinka and it was nothing to write home about.  I had the carnitas and they were fine, but could have used a whole lot more flavor.  In one word, I'd describe the food here as bland.  For the price point, the food should not to be bland.", "author": "Dara S."}

The service was great.  Everything was fresh and pretty much perfect.  I have a feeling my husband and I will be seen there again.  We had the guacamole with tostadas and habanero shrimp appetizers, followed by the machaca and 1/2 whole roasted chicken, respectively.  The fresh, homemade tortialls were great.  I was only a little surprised that the machaca wasn't what I thought - the beef was cut and prepared a little differently that I expected but it was still very good.  The beans beneath the machaca were amazing.  The roasted chicken was like butter.  I never eat chicken skin but the perfect glaze on this roast made me break my rule.  Oh, and you MUST GET THE FLAN.  The flan is the way flan is supposed to be - simple with it's caramelo.  It was perfect.

Okay, to be fair, my wife loved her enchiladas verdes although she was surprised that it did not come with a side of rice / beans for the price.  However, the carnitas, which came highly recommended by the waiter, fell far short of what should have been a great tasty dish.  Instead, it was surprisingly bland.  My friend and I looked at each other almost in amazement that it lacked any taste.  Once I started adding salt, pepper and salsa, it made it only slightly better.  The only good thing that we liked about this dish was the fresh corn tortillas that accompanied it. and required other condiments to give it some zing, e.g. salt, pepper and even the salsa.  When you consider that the dish cost $17, I walked away feeling disappointed.  Because we were with friends, I did not want to complain.

You will not go to Regalito and get a wild black cherry pecan encrusted saffron dusted Loup de Mer....  this is not what Regalito Rosticeria is about.  Regalito.. means 'small gift' in English from the Spanish.   I think Regalito means for me a small gift and attention to detail.  Restaurants today are big in style or so many try and few execute well.  I found Regaltio a simple Mexican style Rosticeria.  This is a highly differentiated restaurant concept that does not exist in San Francisco.  This city could not have another Taqueria unless it was highly differentiated.  I ordered the Mole and it was well prepared Mole Poblano is a brilliant sauce when done well and a severe disappointment if it falls short.  For this Rosticeria it was well executed.  The salsita was fresh and so were the tortillas.  There is an organic approach to the food and it shows well.  The sangria was delicious and it was nice to see they gave the glasses a coating of cinnamon.  I have never seen that before and it worked well.  The fruit slices were evenly cut and it is a better presentation when it is smaller cubes.  The coffee... which I have never seen in any restaurant (and I have eaten out a lot ...London, Paris, New York, Chicago, Florence, Venice, Madrid, Barcelona....) was served in individual French presses.  These small touches go a long way.  The service was thoughtful and not overbearing.  You have to review the restaurant for it's intent and not compare it with restaurants that it should not be compared to.

I had the mole on another occasion and it was OK, but the meat and the sauce where utterly unaware of each other.\n\nI don't know what they're trying to do here (\"Tex-Mex\"?, \"Neuvo-Oaxacan\"?), but it sure isn't the rich, hot, hearty, fatty, garlicky family-style Mexican food I'm used to.", "author": "Aaron C."}

Maybe because there is so much inexpensive and quick Mexican food in the Mission, it never really made sense to go to a higher end place -- but this is no taqueria, and it's not just fancy burritos, either.  I was FLOORED by how delicious everything was, and every dish had a creative twist.  We were a group of 5 people, so we ordered a lot of different things on the menu, and every single person was impressed.  The tortilla soup was delicious - savory, light, flavorful.  The corn was devoured in minutes.  I had the carne asada - it was awesome.  The one entree that was underwhelming was the enchiladas rojas.  The desserts were pretty good -- there's a creative grilled mango dessert, churros with hot chocolate, a pretty standard flan, and a very good bread pudding.  The sangria was great.  On Mon/Tues nights there is a $28 prix fixe in which you can choose any appetizer, entree and dessert.  Unfortunately when we tried to order this, the waiter said it was \"too late\" because he had already entered in our orders - that was lame and we would have appreciated him being more accommodating - but other than this, we loved the place.

We had to suffer through his crap for about 6 months. Then, he was fired and replaced with a competent chef, and things returned to normal. Then, that one was fired and replaced with a chef who is totally and wholly incompetent. The food became horrible, but what's worse, is that the management of the restaurant has become totally incompetent. One Sunday, there were no beans available because they didn't plan ahead and soak the beans. Then, halfway through the meal, they gave me a bowl of hard uncooked beans. The food itself was disgusting and almost inedible. I waited 6 weeks until returning. This time, the restaurant was closed b/c they changed the hours. I waited 1 hour to return.

What I got was quality below the regular taqueria joint at 3xs the price!  \n\nNot withstanding the wait that was estimated to be 15 minutes that turned out to be almost 90 minutes, the meal started out okay, but got progressively worse.  We started with taquitos - the chicken ones were fine, but nothing spectacular.  The potato ones were not good, but edible.  I did really like the slaw that came with the taquitos, but that was pretty much the highlight of the meal!  The guacamole was also pretty good, but could have used a little more lime and salt.  We shared fish tacos and enchiladas rojo.  The fish tacos were $17, so I expected something really spectacular and delicious,  but instead got overcooked, flavorless fish, and rubbery tortillas.  The enchiladas were tortillas with sauce that was way too burnt tasting to be edible.  No cheese, nothing - just tortillas and bad sauce.  The sangria tasted like flavored water and after drinking several glasses and not being the slightest bit buzzed, I'm pretty sure it was flavored water.\n\nI don't know why anyone would go here given that there are a ton of better places within steps of this place.

I can't say enough good things.  Last time I came in with 7 people and we had to squeeze, but they accommodated us and the service was fast and the food was tasty as the first time I went.", "author": "Liz M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-12", "description": "I had to write a review about how \"real\" the Mexican food is here.  The comments that this is an Americanized or a California interpretation of Mexican cuisine are completely laughable. The idea for this restaurant was born from the food stalls in Mexico City, as seen in the \"weird\" set up as one yelper mentioned. I personally think sitting where you can see you food being cooked in front of you, is a good thing (unfortunately the Health Department requires that glass wall).  The red rice and refried beans, burritos, tacos, nachos, etc. are all \"border food\" and those are the Americanized versions of Mexican food.  Don't get me wrong I loves me a super burrito like the rest of us.  But I have to agree with the yelper who said for those who appreciate the PBS show Mexican:One plate at a time, have an appreciation for this restaurant.  As for the comments that the food tastes bland, I guess there is a reason for over seasoning.  If the meat or produce is not organic or fresh, than seasoning is needed to cover up the true flavor and quality of the food.  However, just try the enchiladas verde and if you think it is bland than maybe you just don't get it.  No worries there are plenty of taquerias to chose from in the mission.", "author": "Bryan S."}

I really like their chicken soup, rice and beans and taquitos.  I will defiantly be coming back.", "author": "Anne G."}

I like the chips and salsa ( the chips are actually whole crispy tortillas).  Chile verde dishes are worth trying.  The restaurant is bright and cheery and clean; it is small however.  And parking is always a challenge in the Mission.  It is worth at least one visit to make your own decision.", "author": "K J."}

They were really good! our waiter told us they were the best thing there, and that they weren't really spicy, but the flavor was rich and just went \"on and on and on.\" Well he was right, they were really good. some onions and cheese on the top and corn tortillas. There was rice and beans (not refried, the healthy kind) on the side in a bowl. For apps, we had guacamole with tortillas. It was mmm and came with plenty dip. Could have used a few more tortillas. All 3 of us had the mango juice, which was sweet and tasty. I was worried it'd come from a can, but it didn't!  Overall, very friendly staff, yummy, healthy tasting food, and good prices. It was a little small so I bet it can get crowded. But all 3 of us liked it. J expressed that it's his favorite Mexican place in san Francisco so far. I think this place and the one in west portal are tied, although they are different types of Mexican food. I think of this as what we'd be cooking if we lived in mexico... since of course you cant eat that greasy Mexican restaurant food every day normally... so it's probably more authentic than others.", "author": "Merredith L."}

(this place also does b-fast and brunch hence, the juice on the menu.)  all in all, i would definitely come back. next time for an earlier meal to try something different - and to be able to order my oj w/out shame :)", "author": "Tanvi A."}
