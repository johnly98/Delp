Portions are always generous and I've never been disappointed in their bbq chicken which is flavorful and juicy. The BF always order their chicken kayaks which fulfills his friend chicken cravings. I love that they're willing to sub the standard plate lunch sides ( Mac salad and rice) for all veggies ( cabbage). They also have a nice salad option if you're t unit to watch your carb intake ( not that you would go to get Hawaiian bbq and worry about carbs). For me, I realize a mini plate is plenty of food and can satisfied a hungry month. If you're starving  he regular plate is more than enough with left overs a guarantee. \n\nPro tip: place a phone order! It'll be faster.", "author": "Diane T."}

The line can sometimes get long but the wait is usually manageable.\n\nSo BBQ beef, chicken, short ribs, or chicken katsu are the main attractions here. So order something with that or a combination of all of that. The plates come with 2 scoops of rice, macaroni salad, and some veggies; alternatively, you can request all rice and everything becomes rice instead.

I usually don't eat the cabbage, because they put the meat on top of it and the cabbage gets all oily. The portions are huge and the meat is tender and juicy, not dry at all. Don't forget the sauce that goes with the meat. Be careful when pumping out the katsu sauce because it once burned my hand since it was so hot. Another time it wasn't even warm, basically too cold for my enjoyment. \n\nThe wait time can be at least 10 minutes long, depending on how many orders are ahead of you.

Since we fulfilled the Mexican craving, we decided to order Hawaiian barbecue. It was a holiday, so our normal place wasn't open. Decided to try Ono Hawaiian BBQ since they were on Postmates. We placed our dinner delivery order on Monday, May 29th at 6:45pm. It arrived at 7:44pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Kalua Pork With Cabbage: Slow roasted pork with a hint of smokey flavor, served shredded over steamed cabbage, Includes 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of our famous macaroni salad and vegetables ($8.79)\n*Hawaiian Bbq Mix: Bbq chicken, bbq beef & kalbi short ribs, Includes 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of our famous macaroni salad and vegetables ($9.79)\n*Chicken Katsu: Curry, Includes rice and macaroni salad ($6.59)\n*Macaroni Salad: 4 scoops ($5.69)\n\nI got the bbq mixed plate. It was a good portion with one slice of kalbi and a good amount of chicken and beef. All the meats had a nice smokiness to them. I also ordered the chicken katsu to share. This was not very good. Chewy, hard, and dry. Not much chicken either. The curry didn't help much as it was really thin and didn't coat the katsu. The roommate got the kalua pork which he seemed to enjoy. We both like macaroni salad, so he got a huge side of it. One disappointing thing, we ordered Spam Musubi (2pcs): A block of rice topped with a dash of teriyaki sauce and a slice of spam, wrapped in seaweed ($3.99), but never received it. Not sure if Postmates forgot to order it or Ono forgot to pack it, but we did get a refund on that item. Such a bummer cuz I love spam musubi when having Hawaiian food!\n\nDecent replacement for my usual go to Hawaiian spot. I'd just avoid the chicken katsu. If I ever order from them again, hopefully my spam musubi won't be forgotten!", "author": "Elena N."}

I was struck dumbfounded with a dilemma because that was the only thing I order at any Hawaiian oriented place.  \n\nIt's been awhile since my last visit, there were a few new things I noticed.  Chicken breast was a new choice of meat, pre-sliced cutlets of chicken breast over peppered and extremely salty.  They now have spam and eggs on the menu officially.  An expansion into the experimental realm of noodle soups has begun.  The bowl of noodle soup tasted like a microwaved concoction of canned noodles and vegetables.    \n\nMost of all orders come with the macaroni salad like I remembered.  Overall consensus I have come across on the macaroni salad is one or the other, massive addiction or complete disgust.  This is probably the most consistent item at all Hawaiian fast food restaurants.      \n\nThe service at this branch was very courteous and the cashier even sympathized with my cruel inner dealing of their lack of loco moco.  Hawaiian fast food has hit a minor chord and its name is Ono.  Why aim for a healthier angle?  Isn't everything fried, deep fried, or grilled in a bunch of oil anyway?

If you're a SF State student and have a night class, your late dinner options are very limited. A quick search on Yelp and Ono was one of my options along with the food court at Stonestown, which closes at 9p.m. Ono stays open until 10:30p.m. and shouldn't worry about being rushed out.\n\nI was going to go with the chicken combo, until I saw the Hawaiian BBQ Mix, which includes BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef, and Kalbi Short Ribs. Ono bills it as \"A meat lover's favorite\". Immediately after paying for my meal, my stomach sank as I saw the nutritional information for my carnivore plate. Let's just say that if you're health conscious, stick to the chicken.\n\nWith regret in full swing, I dug in to my BBQ Mix and the chicken and beef were first up. The meat was tender and flavorful without any additional sauce or condiments. The steamed rice and macaroni salad were the perfect compliment to the meat plate. In a sign of defeat, I didn't touch my short ribs and threw in the towel. In all fairness, it's a lot of food for one person, especially for $9.\n\nI was contemplating downgrading one star, but figured it's my fault for ordering the BBQ Mix and not asking for the nutritional information beforehand.

It was strange (I've never had BBQ chicken in a curry before) but they didn't skimp on the meat.  It was cut the way their BBQ chicken comes (big pieces, boneless).  The chicken was quite tender and the marinade was on the salty side (not too bad, the rice and bland macaroni salad help) with a bit of sweetness.  I was looking for more curry flavor.  The chicken was accompanied by one big scoop of steamed white rice and a plain creamy macaroni salad, heavy on the mayo, with carrot shreds.  \n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for fast food though the food takes awhile to arrive.  The soda fountain machine is in the dining area (free refills).  They also sell Hawaiian drinks.  \n\nThe clientele is mostly young and Asian (they probably like fro-yo too).

I just can't fathom why. It can't be for a healthier selection because let's face it, nobody goes to Hawaiian BBQ to slim down. NOBODY! The Mahi Burger was nothing short of greatness. Now it's just nothing but a memory. Another let down is the fact that they never offered fries. How do you sell burgers and not fries?! \n\nAlthough their Hawaiian drinks are pretty good, $1.62 a pop is a little pricey considering you can pick up a six-pack of those bad boys at Ranch 99 for around that price. I don't know why, but their fountain Barq's Root Beer is one of the best fountains around, too.\n\nThe one thing that they still have going for them is their Kalbi Short Ribs is still spectacular. I've once ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner at Ono's for four months straight to save up for my motorcycle and I can safely say the short ribs never gets old. I hope to God none of you are ever put in that position, but just know the Short Ribs remains your safest bet. \n\nThe Spam Musubi is still pretty good too.

I've tried almost everything on the menu and it is usually pretty consistently ok. I usually stick with the bbq or teri chicken (which taste almost the same, I think the only difference is the teri sauce they put on top!) and kalua pork, which is my favorite dish. When Ono is on, their pork is tender and flavorful. When Ono is off, the pork can be a little dry. I don't really like their beef dishes - I think the cut of beef you get for the price is just not tender at all. I'm also not a fan of the katsu sauce they use, although the katsu is pretty decent. Stay away from the curry - it is the worst possible excuse for curry I've ever tried from a hawaiian fast food joint. \n\nLastly the spam musabi is pretty good, although they do make it the lazy way (Ono wraps the nori around the rice and spam, but with the spam touching the nori. For wraps (and not just a strip) imo it should be rice, spam, rice, and the nori all around the whole thing.)", "author": "Dom L."}

When it first opened up though, I thought this place was great...relatively genuine Hawaiian food that actually tastes pretty decent for the money.  However, I have to admit that over time, you could see that the service was starting to slip a bit, and the friendly workers they started with were no longer around.\n\nThat said, I think they still do a pretty good job with the food though.  The Chicken Combo (BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu) is a personal favorite.  The portions are generous, and you could split it over two meals and still be full with just eating half of the order.  In addition to the main items, there's also a serving of cabbage (meh...it's cabbage) and macaroni salad, which tastes much better than Hawaiian Drive Inn's.  They also do the spam musubi pretty well, with two per order and the right portion of meat/rice/sauce.\n\nDespite any drop-offs in service, I've only done takeout so any exposure is pretty limited.  As long as the food stays close to the same quality, and the portions don't shrink, I'd still make a return trip or two.", "author": "Mike L."}

The chicken katsu had two pieces with human hair fried to it which made us wonder what was hiding in the other two main dishes.  We stopped eating right away.  The grease on the cabbage was so gross.  The rice and mac looked were super small scoops like they didn't have enough to make the family meal so they switched to smaller ice cream scoops.  This is not what we were expecting at all.  Horrified we threw out the food and went to Daly City L&L Hawaiian BBQ and got some more food.  In addition to the waste of time, this was a big huge waste of money (over $30.00 for the family meal).  We would have taken this back but the containers were all soggy and not sufficient to hold the food without the food falling out and making things gross in our car.  It is clear these people don't care about quality.  I and my three young ones  will never come back to this Ono's.  My true review is I would really like to give it negative 30 stars for the $30 plus dollars I lost in going to this place.  I hope this was helpful in warning others.", "author": "Tahiti Lucy B."}

With the advent of several other chains and Hukilau, the competition is pretty fierce for authentic Hawaiian food.  The menu doesn't exactly exude Hawaiian other than the barbecue meats, macaroni salad, rice plates and the spam musubi; it's actually more of a fast food version of Korean barbecue, cross westernized Japanese food (katsu and teriyaki), and noodles.  The portions are generous as I ordered a chicken combo plate to go ($8.13) which comprised of barbecued marinated chicken (tasty with sweet flavor) and chicken katsu (breaded and fried with sweet katsu sauce on the side) on a bed of cooked cabbage (normally raw in Hawaii), a large scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  It was very filling as I was already full after eating about 2/3rd of the plate.  They used to have a self serve sauce station, but they now give the prepacked sauces with your order.  A good point is that they do serve the food warm, unlike many fast food places who leave them under heat lamps (pre-cooked).

The rice is okay, but the macaroni salad thingy is very bland, cold, and lacking.

It is our favorite place to get take out Hawaiian food in the city.  You can eat there like fast food style too but usually the swarm of loud high school and college students discourage us.  We usually order the spam masubi (2 LARGE rolls for $2.50!) and the BBQ Beef Mini meal ($4.09!) and trust me, they give you plenty for 1 person!  What a bargain!  Call ahead and order if you want take out since the wait can be long.", "author": "SFFoodie F."}

This place has screwed up my order a few times and yes its my fault for not checking but unwrapping all the food we ordered before walking out is a huge hassle and we shouldn't have to do it.  I've had curry katsu with no curry and similiar things like that.  I am not a food snob and yes I know what to expect when going to fast food places.  I gave L & L 4 stars but ono is lucky to get 2.  Their spam masubis are ok (yes there is better ways to cook spam)...  and there service for a fast food place varies too much.   Sometimes its ok but sometimes it would have been faster to go eat at king of thai across the parking lot.", "author": "Jae L."}

If I didn't feel like any of the other food places on Lakeshore Plaza, I'd pick this.  I've had the BBQ Chicken and Pineapple Chicken?  The BBQ Chicken isn't that great, it COULD be better.  Though I like their pineapple sauce, the chicken is still the same BBQ Chicken.  I actually do like their macaroni salad that comes with the meals, but you can only have so much of it.  The place is very very clean since someone is constantly cleaning.  Another downside is that it may take a while to get your food.  But kudos for them for carrying those nectar drinks!  \"Pass-O-Guava\"!", "author": "deeks .."}

They had enough time.  I went to pick it up and when I gave them in receipt, it seemed like they didn't know about my order.  All I got was \"they're cooking it now\"... but in reality, they forgot about my order and just started it.  They made me wait and the party was delayed because of their poor customer service.  I asked to talk to a manager and they said he wasn't there.  That's fine.  I gave them my phone number and asked that the manager call me.  Guess what.  No phone call.  I have to give them 1 star for their customer service.", "author": "cow d."}

The food is good and I really can't taste the difference.  The restaurant is new and furniture and decor is of modern contemporary design.  The parking situation there sucks like a Dyson vacuum cleaner.  Make sure you have insurance in case someone bumps into your car.", "author": "Raging R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-14", "description": "I don't know anything about hawaiian cuisine.\nThis place is in the strip mall by my place. There's always parking in the lot right in front. The portions are huge, I'm a big eater and I always get the mini meal ($5) and it fills me up. The macaroni salad is always good, if a little underseasoned. The rice is always good, never to wet or too dry, never undercooked. The grilled chicken is good, though the fat doesn't always cook off completely. The beef is quite salty, fine for me but I'm surprised others don't complain more. I've tried their fried stuff too, sometimes it's a bit dry, but you have their delicious warm teriyaki sauce to fix that. between the teriyaki sauce, katsu sauce, vietnamese rooster hot sauce, soy sauce, and hot mustard, you can add flavor in the direction and quantity as you see fit.\nOnly reason they don't get five stars is that the shortribs are really fatty (inedibly so) and the wait time is inconsistent (sometimes under 5 min, sometimes over 10). You can call ahead, but most don't.", "author": "Matt G."}

But, who gets something to drink with their food these days? Okay, I admit, I do! The food is great though. So far I've had the mixed sea food combo and the Haiwaiian BBQ Mix and I've been more than just satisfied with both. The sea food seemed fresh, and the meat was quite tender, but not too tender. The crowd there, sometimes at least, is very hip. So hip that I'd rather avoid it, but the place keeps me coming back for more. Another positive factor is that you can sit outside, sure you can do that in many places, but here you can do it while it rains too. Yes, you read me correctly, while it rains. Isn't that awesome? I think it's quite cool. I haven't ever seen anyone sit outside while it rained, nor have I ever been in that neighborhood during a rainstorm. Does that mean it never rains there? No, it doesn't. But it means, by my disturbingly illogical logic, that it's a great place to eat.", "author": "Roger W."}

Therefore, I find this location to have the best tasting Hawaiian food, and their Mac is good too.  How the food is perceived depends upon what one is used to eating.  And I think nationality plays a very big part.  When I was last in the Islands, we met some Hawaiian guy in Hana that was BBQ'ing in his front yard to make money for family vacation.  His taste was identical to what I'm used to and most enjoy.  Food  at Ono Hawaiian BQ is ONO!!!!!  (Hawaiian for good)", "author": "Dee W."}
