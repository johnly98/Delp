There is one big table in the middle and we shared that table with another party but it wasn't too bad. You would feel very cozy but also boujee here. \n\nThe service was really great. They were attentive, since the place is so small, you can always get their attention.  \n\nThe food is on the more expensive spectrum but the portion size is pretty decent. \n\nLamb Couscous: very filling because it comes with lots of couscous. The lamb was very tender and the vegetable toppings and caramelized onions go really well together. It tops with caramelized onion so it tastes a bit sweet. But I like my food sweet so I would high recommend this dish. \n\nMrouzia: The lamb WAS AMAZING. It's saffron honey so it is like a sweet and savory taste. If you dont like sweet flavor, don't order this. But it was very tender and flavorful. It comes with only lamb and like some dates... Not as a well rounded dish as the Lamb Couscous.\n\nFish Tagine: the Fish was tender and full of flavor. The fish piece was pretty huge too. And not dry at all. I was a bit hesitant to order fish, because most places dont cook fish right and it just smells but not here! \n\nI usually don't order lamb, because it tends to have a weird after taste.

They cooked the lamb in a pot and poured it onto my plate upon serving. It had a few piquant pieces of salted some-type-of-citrus skin that was so soft and added a nice tanginess. There were olives and a clove of garlic which offered a different set of flavors. The lamb was amazing, the fat melted in my mouth, the meat fell apart easily and was juicy, tender, flavorful, and well seasoned. The veggies on the side included some purple potato, brussel sprouts, potato, and asparagus.

Hrmmm perfect cold appetizer to start the meal with\n-Kafta- lamb meatballs were cooked perfectly and seasoned well, satisfied my tomato sauce craving\n-Chiflor- if I had to choose one least favorite dish, this would be the one. It was not bad, but I thought the cauliflower was a bit to cooked and I didn't care for so much creme fraiche on it. Would have preferred the creme fraiche on the side.\n-Tangia- slow cooked lamb was very good and the other ingredients on the plate complemented well. \n-Chicken tagine- recommended by our waiter and it was tasty as well. The chicken was very tender though portions were a bit smaller\n-Beef tagine- wanted to try it since many Yelpers wrote about it. I didn't think it was bland like some Yelpers said, but the flavors were certainly lighter. I thought the lighter flavor actually helped balance out the other stronger flavors of other dishes\n-Couscous- good/solid\n-Saffron rice with raisins- or what we heard the waiter say \"side of fries\". Hahaha my friend was so disappointed when we tried ordering fries but the waiter said he said \"saffron rice\". LOL. I loved the rice though. It was cooked perfectly and so yummy. \n-Baklava- good, but I've had better! Thought it was too wet and a bit too sweet\n-Special phyllo dough cheese dessert- I'm not a cheese lover, but this was delightful. Very light and not too sweet at all. I think everyone liked this dessert more than the baklava because we kinda neglected the baklava after we had a taste of this one (we all shared desserts... and every dish)\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR\nRestaurant is small and cozy. Nicely light with natural light from windows. Noise level surprisingly on the quiet side given how small the restaurant is. Just be watchful when walking through tables to get to your seat/restroom or leaving the restaurant. There is a small counter/bar area where you can enjoy a drink while waiting for a table. I'd say it's a good spot for date night, casual but could be a bit romantic/intimate too since it's cozy.  \n\nSERVICE\nGreat and timely service. Waiter was friendly and gave us some good recommendations on what and how much to order. Food came out at a good pace and water cups were never left empty. Andes chocolate mints came with the bill.", "author": "Iris H."}

An hour in, I started daydreaming (don't front, you know you do it too!). \n\nJust when we were getting to the juicy NSFW stuff, I was startled by the loud crinkling of bags next to me. I looked to my left and the lady next to me was going to town on her monstrous super burrito. I sat there simultaneously side-eyeing and salivating each bite of stretchy cheese action as crema and salsa roja cascaded down the sides of the tortilla. \n\nWhy you gotta be so cruel?! \n\nBut, I suppose this wasn't as bad as when our former director thought it would be OK to bring in a whole rack of ribs for her lunch during a meeting. While talking, she would suck on the bones like....NVM. Keeping it classy! \n\nAs soon as the meeting was over, I was hangry and on the hunt for a lunch spot. Khamsa, a new Moroccon Fusion restaurant popped up as one of my nearest bookmarks so I made my way there. \n\nKhamsa is located at the ground level of a luxury condo in a part of The Mission that doesn't get much foot traffic. Most businesses in the area are auto body shops so it was a nice change of scenery to walk into such a cute restaurant. While small, the owner(s) did a great job with making the space warm and inviting. There's also an outdoor patio for those rare warm days. \n\nWhen I walked in, there was no one in the dining room so I stood awkwardly near the bar area. After several minutes, I was able to get the attention of someone in the kitchen who sat me down. He said, he would bring me a menu but never did. Five minutes later, the host/server appears and brings me a menu to peruse. \n\nThe Morrocon Fusion menu offers apps (e.g. basteeya), salads, and entrees (e.g. tagine). The lunch and dinner menu appear to have the same items but the prices are lower for lunch. Beer and wine only. \n\nI ordered the Beef Tagine with a side of rice. I was told the Beef Tagine comes with a side of salad or couscous so I went with the former which I don't recommend. More on that later. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, my Beef Tagine w/ side salad ($17) arrives: http://bit.ly/2isCpug. There seems to have been a miscommunication and I didn't initially receive a side of rice ($5) as ordered. But, the server later brought it comped which I really appreciated: http://bit.ly/2w7VXra.\n\nSadly, the Beef Tagine was disappointing. While the English cut short ribs were meaty and tender, they were severely underseasoned/underspiced and there were too many sweet components making the dish cloyingly sweet: http://bit.ly/2w7IAXZ. It desperately needed an acid to cut the sweetness from the caramelized orange (tasted like candy), and the dates and honey balsamic dressing from the salad. I would skip the salad and order the couscous to help balance the sweetness from the short ribs.\n\nService was cordial but spotty even when it was empty. Water glass wasn't refilled until I was getting ready to leave and I had to go to the bar and ask the server for a box and the bill. Maybe it's because I went during lunch but the staff seemed to be distracted with delivery (?) people coming in and out. I'm sure dinner service may be better.\n\nKhamsa is only a month young so I would give them several months to work out the kinks in the kitchen. Wishing them much success!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The description on their website made it sound like one of those hipster-focused fusion restaurants where the owners intentionally neuter the flavors and spices of their native dishes to appease the masses. In fact, the more impatient food bloggers angling to become local taste makers are already referring to the restaurant as serving Moroccan-Californian fusion cuisine. That's not why I came here after work last week. I was just looking for a different take on vegetarian dishes since I'm eating wisely these days.\n\nIt's a compact spot with tables already occupied at 6PM, so I took a seat at the far left of the counter in order not to disrupt bigger parties coming in to try the place. The friendly server saw me struggle with my starter between the $11 Zaalouk and the $12 Chiflor, which was a small plate of charred cauliflower sprinkled with zaatar, a Middle Eastern blend of various herbs, crushed sesame seeds, and salt. It came with small dollops of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche mixed with Argon oil sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2vQC9Ke). It was delicious healthy eating with just a hint of decadence with the cream. For my entree, I bypassed the lamb, fish and beef to try the $18 Vegetarian Tajine.\n\nThe dish indeed came in a traditional tajine, a small one suitable for a solo diner. It was quite flavorful and fragrant with figs, raisins, almonds, summer squash, carrots, potatoes, and a lemon yogurt sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2vQC754). It automatically came with a side of Couscous to sop up all the goodness of the tajine (photo: http://bit.ly/2v5cTNA). I was already full when the server came by with a complimentary Zaalouk with pureed eggplant mixed with onions and tomatoes. It came with wedges of fresh pita that were hard to resist even though I had been avoiding carbs for weeks (photo: http://bit.ly/2vgmmko). Really delicious and quite filling, all of it.

The food was really tasty and the space beautiful--except maybe for the really creepy mural of a blue-faced lady.  I will be going back for sure!!\n\nFood\nApp- Basteeya, so unique and definitely should try. It's a sweet and savory pastry with chicken, almonds, cinnamon and powdered sugar but somehow it all works. I think it was slightly on the dry-side but I would order it again. \n\nSide- Chiflor, if you love cauliflower get this dish. \n\n\nMain-Beef Tagine- amazing! super soft and moist beef. Would definitely recommend. The portion is good and 2 people can share of ordering sides. \n\nMy friends ordered dessert but I did not try it. However they really liked the baklava and ice cream!", "author": "Maliha Z."}

Would be nice if it came with some couscous or rice as keep in mind it was steep at $30. The side of  vegetables were sadly not a great consolation prize as they were soggy and under seasoned that cane with our other main.\n\nLastly we got some dessert that came with ice cream that I have to advise against. The pastry component was cold (we were told that it was intentional) but it tasted very stale. Especially with a cold side of ice cream, I recommend it to be hot.", "author": "Susan Y."}

They recommended the cauliflower appetizer, which was a dud.   And the chicken in pastry appetizer, which was average.  I've had much better.  She also recommended the tagines.  \n\nThe chicken tagine was ok.  Not amazing by any means.  The lamb couscous was tasteless.  The veggie tagine was a weird flavor and almost unedible.  I've had moroccan multiple times in the past.  \nThe service was horrendous.  Took a long time to be seated even with reservations and an empty table.  When they gave us the check, the lady looked at her watch.  They kept giving us the evil eye when we chatted during dessert.  It seems since we were already committed to a 20% tip since we were a party of 6, it didnt matter how they treated us.  \n\nOh, and it was super expensive.

We booked a table on opentable but there was no wait at 540pm. as we left close to 7pm, the place was still quiet. I'm guessing it's either the bad weather or people didn't want to head out on hump day.\nWe did some research here before coming and the cousin discovered that they upped their prices. When we got there, we realized they upped their prices AGAIN. But we gave them a fair chance.\nWe got the kafta and the meatballs were good. They were moist in the center and outside was a little soft. The seasoning was done perfectly. Nothing was too salty.\nThe chicken tagine was amazing. The meat was falling off the bone. Cousin and I felt like they must have marinated the meat for a looong time. Again, the seasoning wasn't overwhelming. It wasn't overly salty. The potatoes were soft but seasoned well as well.\nThe lamb couscous was great. The lamb was not too game-y. It was also very tender and soft. you really could just use your fork to break apart the meat. the couscous was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were great. the only thing was the sweet potato was a little too sweet for us.\nThe Moroccan lemonade was delicious as well.

Amazing! Also be sure to order the Moroccan tea! Has a great hint of cardamom.\n\nThe spot is quite tiny so I would recommend a recommendation way ahead of time. Not ideal for large groups but we had 5 and it was great. The seating arrangement is long communal tables.", "author": "Antoinette C."}

Veggie tagine was flavorful! be sure to order a side of couscous if you need some carb to go with your tagine. The lamb dish (not the tagine) was delicious as well. Lamb was done well /right consistency!\nFish tagine was really good, although little bit of salt would make the dish more flavorful!  Service was really  good! They don't yet have a regular dessert menu, we requested if they could make a dessert dish out of those delicious dates and honey that came with the lamb dish and they offered us a plate free of charge! that was a really nice gesture!  overall solid food.

The space is clean and inviting, and beautifully designed with Mediterranean tiles, lighting fixtures and colors. Every detail seems to be carefully considered, from the elegant tea service to the jewel box that carries your bill. There is also great music (my boyfriend describes it as \"modern Arabic pop\") playing. The service is attentive and the food is BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS. We had the kofte, the lamb couscous and the basteeya. The flavors were delicately layered in each dish. The couscous had an almost buttery, nutty flavor and the lamb was tender and moist. I had the kofte on a Mediterranean salad that had a delicious, bright dressing, salty, almost bitter olives balanced by mild feta. We had to take the basteeya home untasted because we were so full, but the dish itself, like everything else we ate, was GORGEOUSLY presented. What a surprising gem of a find!", "author": "Susan C."}

As it turns out, the very wine they were looking to source for the wedding can be enjoyed at Khamsa - this was a good initial indication.\n\nFrom there, both the eggplant and cauliflower starters were delicious. Specifically, the eggplant was deep and smokey - I'm already thinking getting back for round 2 in the next week or so.\n\nFor the main, I went with the leg of lamb - it was falling off the bone flavorful. The raisin, squash, and onion base really combined well. Delicious. \n\nMy wife, who's vegetarian, raved about the tagine (veggie). \n\nAs for the decor and atmosphere: It's intimate yet exciting.
