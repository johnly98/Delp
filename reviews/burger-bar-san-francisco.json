Ordinarily we wouldn't seek out restaurants in such a touristy area but we've ended up near union square for several of the pop up museums and no way we were parking twice just to find better food options. Despite it's touristy locale, and it's chain status burger bar is pretty good! \n\nThey have a kids menu and the option to build a burger to your liking so you can get exactly what you want. Even on a weekend it wasn't too crowded so we were seated right away, and they do have the option to make reservations online as well. You have a great view of union square too!\n\nThe first time we went my husband got the spicy burger, I think it's the \"inferno burger\". It's crazy hot. The waitress asked him several times if he was SURE he wanted it. I asked if a lot of people ordered it and she said yes. Then I asked if they liked it and she said no. It's so hot you have to sign a waiver. Even my hubby who loves spicy things said it was too hot, though it didn't stop him from ordering it again!\n\nOn our second visit we opted to build our own burgers, and he was able to get jalape\u00f1os on his to make it spicy, a much more manageable level of heat. I built my own turkey burger and it was cooked to perfection. Often when I've gotten turkey burger they are too try. Not a burger bar, it was juicy and delicious!", "author": "Michele B."}

We really wanted to sit by the window, but we're told that it was by reservation only. Although, they didn't seem that busy, but whatever. \nMy boyfriend got the Kobe style Waygu beef burger, and I got the Chef's natural line burger with mushrooms, grilled onions, and cheese. I didn't try the Kobe burger, so I can't speak to that, but according to the boyfriend, it was only alright. My burger was dry, and the mushrooms had a strange taste to it? The sweet potatoes fries that I got were pretty run-of-the-mill. I feel like I've had better burgers at Five Guys. \nI didn't particularly enjoy the service either. Not sure if our server was just having a bad day, but he seemed irritated when taking our order and during every interaction we had with him after that. \nThe best part of the meal would have to be the salted caramel milkshake-so good!

The bacon that came with the burger was good - the two pieces were thick and crispy. The skinny fries was good too -nice and crispy. \n\nThe cob salad was good but next time I will have the blue cheese on the side as it is so pungent and strong in flavor.  A good size salad. \n\nI thought everything was a bit pricey but we were in Macy's department store. We also shared two pitchers of porter beer each pitcher costing $28.

The only reason we wanted to eat here was for the view of Union Square during December. We luckily got a window seat overlooking the Christmas decor at Union Square. This includes the whole view of the ice skating rink, Christmas tree, and surrounding Christmas lights/buildings. \n\nWe ordered: \n1. Peppercorn Burger ($23) My bf ordered this and didn't want to finish it :/\n\n2. Le Frog Burger ($23) I absolutely love Brie, but it was an overkill with this burger. I thought it would have been an interesting and different twist to a burger, but it was way too rich. In the future, I'm definitely sticking to the norm - jack or Swiss. Yes the black angus was good with the mushrooms, but I definitely couldn't finish the Brie with it. Halfway through the burger, I ended up scrapping the rest of the cheese off. \n\nBoth burgers come with your choice of fat fries, skinny fries, or sweet potatoes fries. The fries were good, especially with the truffle mayo, but then again, you can't really make fries wrong. I thought the presentation looked a little ghetto with the bagged fries. It definitely didn't feel or look like a $23 dish. \n\nThe service was excellent. She was super nice and friendly, which I always appreciate great customer service.

My boyfriend and I had sat down around 10 pm\u200b and were asked for our drink orders. We both ordered milkshakes that NEVER appeared during our stay in the restaurant. When we asked our server about them (the third time) a half hour later while our food was served, he replied, \"Oh it's not my fault, I asked them to hurry.\" Our food was edible but not something memorable to make me want to return. \n\nThroughout the course of the meal, we asked our server about our status on food and drinks as we were seated in a section that left us hidden from most servers. His responses left us feeling uncertain about when we would be served, showing an obvious lack of training or discipline regarding customer service. As the face of the restaurant, servers/waiters NEED to be in clear communication with kitchen staff and customers. Rather than focus on serving us, \u200bhe seemed more interested in getting to know us, even going so far as to ask\u200b my age, which clearly upset my boyfriend.\n\nAs a student studying Hospitality and Tourism Management, service is something I am highly critical of. I saw what looked like a manager and asked to speak with him. I explained to him the entirety of our experience and his response was \"Your waiter is seasonal...\" and he went on to explain how a few \"milkshake guys\" quit that day leaving them understaffed on the milkshake bar. This seems like something servers should be trained in to alleviate instances like this. While he may have felt he could share his dissatisfaction with our waiter with me after I told him I am studying the industry, as a manager you NEVER admit to employing staff that are incapable of the job. This reflects on you, the company, and your training standards. In this case, Burger Bar, you have done poorly with training on a standard and managerial level.\n\nAfter listening to the manager Aaron explain away the reasons as to why we were not served properly for 10 minutes, he finally provided a solution. A 10% discount on our meal. I was not complaining to gain something, only to give constructive criticism, however, \u200bI agreed to\u200b the discount. He then came back apologizing, saying he could not edit the charge already made and would write his name for us to mention \"next time\". He stated he was there from Las Vegas, and I'm not sure their protocol there for charges but in San Francisco, you void credit charges and then charge the new transaction. Aaron failed to remedy the situation and I WILL NOT be returning to ANY Burger Bar nor will I advise my friends to experience this horrendous service.", "author": "Kiva M."}

Food is extremely subpar.\n\nYears ago, I had ordered the salmon burger. I used to just eat the salmon without the buns. It was alright. Came back here recently and got the Caesar salad with salmon, and it was terrible. The salmon was undercooked in parts. The \"salad\" part was leaves of lettuce with some cheese and croutons. It was not a tossed salad to eat with a fork. Interesting presentation, but an odd way to eat a Caesar salad, and it wasn't particularly tasty. \n\nI also got their hazelnut milkshake. While it was good, it was extremely sweet. I asked them to make me a kid's size for half the price (and half the calories). \n\nThis place is not cheap and the food isn't good.

The Burger Bar is located in Union Square near the top of the Macy's building. The elevator is on the opposite side of the elevator that goes up to the Cheesecake Factory. When we arrived to the restaurant, it seemed pretty busy. My wife put our name down for a table and requested a table by a window if possible. The hostess told us it would be 30 minutes. We sat waiting for nearly an hour. When my wife checked on our status, they finally said our table was ready. As we were being escorted to our table, we noticed that there were many empty tables. We were a bit shocked as to why it took so long. My wife guessed that they may have been short staffed and were managing the number of customers in the restaurant. On a good note, they were able to get us a table by the window, which was good. \n\nService and our server was good. Friendly, and checked on us throughout our meal. I ordered a smoked Gouda burger with bacon, and caramelized onions; with a side of fries. It was ok, but nothing to sing home about. Considering we spent the day walking around Union Square, the food really hit the spot. Not sure how often I would eat here but it was nice to experience a new burger place.

Since we were going to be in the Union Square area, I just randomly picked Burger Bar as I haven't been here in years. (It was actually where the roomie and I had dinner on what you could have called our first date 6+ years ago.) We stopped by on June 5th around 9pm.\n\n*Rossini ($65): Kobe Style Wagyu Beef from Australia, saut\u00e9ed foie gras and shaved truffles on an onion bun. Named after a XIXth Century Italian composer whose love for fine food was legendary. The preparation always includes foie gras, truffles and a rich brown sauce - in this case, Black Truffle. Served with Skinny Fries.\n*Caesar Salad ($6.95 Small): Crisp romaine hearts, shaved parmesan, crunchy croutons and caesar dressing.\n*Fish and Chips ($8.95): Fresh battered rod cod, garlic fries, tartar sauce and coleslaw.\n*Jalapeno Onion Petals ($3.95)\n*World's Hottest Sauce ($8.95)\n\nI've always wanted to try their rossini burger, but thought it was too pricey. The roommate said to just go ahead and get it, so I got it. So not worth the $65 in my opinion. The burger patty was a little tough and the foie and truffle didn't have much of the decadent flavor I love in both these ingredients. Maybe because everything was frozen for too long? I don't know, but for a rich burger, it just had dulled down flavors. I also got the hot sauce without looking at the price. $8.95 was too much to pay for this tiny tin of sauce. And world's hottest? I beg to differ. The roommate ordered the rest of the items. They were just average. Nothing special.\n\nProbably would have given them 3 stars if I didn't order the rossini and hot sauce. Minus one for the pricing and flavor on those. I've had better burgers elsewhere. Overall, just super overpriced.", "author": "Elena N."}

My husband has fond memories of his place, and speaks of it as the best French food he has ever eaten.  \n\nAn errand into the city meant we needed a lunch place.  He wanted to try Burger Bar, so off we went.  \n\nIt was shoulder to shoulder in Macy's, and I was concerned about seating.  Surprisingly, there was no wait at 1:00 on a Sunday.  At least, there was no wait to be seated.  \n\nWe waited to order drinks.  \n\nWe waited to receive drinks.  \n\nWe waited to order food.  \n\nAnd then we waited, and waited.  \n\nAll that waiting gave us time.  Time to find all the little things that needed refreshing in the restaurant; our table had sticky stuff all over it.  The chairs were badly dinged and the walls were in serious need of a paint job.  I felt like I was in a very busy Applebee's that was scheduled for a remodel.  I was seated directly across from a slightly obscene picture of two women sticking their tongues out, ready to suck on a straw protruding from a single milkshake.  My husband's view was of a 50 something woman displaying her \"senior yoga\" skilz on the TV in front of him.\n\nFinally, the food came.  I had ordered a Wagu hamburger on a sesame bun, medium rare, zucchini fries, and a side salad. What I got was a small, hockey-puck sized, almost well-done burger on a ginormous, untoasted, sesame bun.  The fried zucchini appeared to be cooked from frozen rather than fresh.  There was no salad.  The hamburger was pretty good, even though most of its life was cooked out of it.  \n\nHubby ordered a regular hamburger and a side salad.  Though his meat was cooked medium rare (he had ordered it rare), he said the burger and the salad were pretty good.  (Since I had no salad, he shared his.  It was very good.)  \n\nNot surprisingly, there was no check back after ordering the food, and our drinks were refilled long after they were empty.  The bill reflected the two salads we ordered, and the young man who waited on us seemed surprised that we didn't receive two.  \n\nAll in all, for the price and location, I would consider this an emergency restaurant.  I would not seek it out, as there are so many other, better choices, in the area.  The burgers are good, but not great.  The view is pretty great, if you can get a window seat.  The service was pretty terrible and the decor was in bad need of a facelift.  For the price, it is... okay.\n\nHerbert Keller, you don't know me, so take this advice for what it is worth-- some stranger with very little professional cooking experience, on the internet, advising a world famous chef how to run his business.  Crazy, huh?  But, this time, hubris wins over sense, so here it goes.  Burger Bar is probably not what you want San Francisco to remember you by.  It needs some love and attention.

I prefer this restaurant over the Cheesecake Factory because it's less crowded and loud, but the food/drinks are still great.  I would choose the Cheesecake Factory if I wanted a table outside, but overall I prefer Burger Bar for the service and selection.  The menu has a lot of customization options, great appetizers/salads, and drinks.  You can also choose to sit at the bar, and the bartender can refill your drinks faster or give you extra napkins/sauce, basically anything you need.  The portion sizes are also great, you can share depending on how much you eat.", "author": "Lola S."}

My burger was entirely satisfactory; it was the peppercorn burger. Ultimately, though, it was quite pricey for what it was. For ~10% the price, you can get equally good burgers in the same neighborhood.\n\nThere was a $50 wagyu beef burger on the menu with foie gras and black truffles. It seems kind of gimmicky to me, but if it's something that appeals to you, it's something exclusive to Burger Bar, so maybe think about that.\n\nMy lunchmate got the sliders, and she was actively dissatisfied with them, mostly because they came without any sauce.\n\nWe didn't get any of the shakes, which I sort of regret, because they looked pretty darn good.\n\nThe kicker was that the service was pretty crummy. Our silverware didn't come until after we'd had our food for, like, five minutes. We had to grab condiments from an adjacent table. And they'd run out of beer glasses ... ? That one isn't a big deal, but it struck me as kind of weird, and is perhaps indicative of the lax service overall.", "author": "Greg P."}

As soon as we sat down we we're greeted by a waiter, and then a couple minutes after by the shift manager as well and taken care of really well.  It was nice to see service on point when the establishment looked like it was at about maximum capacity.  Again the service was so on point we even had someone who had too many drinks bothering our table and they had him escorted out and resolved the problem swiftly.  \n\nAs for the food all the burgers we ordered came out to perfection! I remember ordering the Kobe burger, JJ recommended it to me since I couldn't decide on what to order... everything looked so delicious! The result? That Kobe burger is one of the best Kobe burgers I've ever had! Also they have a pretty solid selection of beers, craft beers, and liquors as well too! Again big thanks to JJ helping us out and making us feel welcomed.\n\nSome other cool features about this spot is the view by the window is really nice.

There was hardly anyone there, probably because it was a weekday.  I hear it can get busy, so good thing they take reservations.\nWe were seated at one of the tables by the window, so we got a view of Union Square.\nThe food was pretty average.\n\nAmerican Classic - Angus Beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato on sesame bun, with dill pickle:\nBurger was pretty close to well done. We requested medium rare. The leafy lettuce and tomatoes tasted crisp and fresh though. \n\nBurger Bar Sliders - Buffalo with caramelized onions, Angus with plain bacon, NatureSource beef with American cheese, with skinny fries:\nThese burgers were well-done too, if not a little more dry, probably because small patties cook a lot faster. We couldn't really taste the difference between the 3 different types of beef. \n\nNutella Milkshake - Chocolate ice cream, Nutella, chocolate sauce and chocolate whipped cream, topped with toasted hazelnuts:\nThe milkshake was not bad. It was a lot smaller than I expected, but kind of a relief, because it was so thick and cloyingly sweet. The toasted hazelnuts were the best part.\n\nMost of the burgers are around $15-$25, with the exception of the \"Kobe\" style burger with sauteed foie gras & truffles for a whopping $65. I'd pay $65 for a faux \"Kobe\" steak, but not for a burger. Even with the foie gras and truffles, it seems overpriced. & why would foie be sauteed?\n\nIt's cool that the menu has different types of beef - Angus, Buffalo, Australian... but considering ours were all pretty overcooked, we couldn't tell the difference anyway. I didn't expect much from a burger in a department store, but once I realized it was Hubert Keller's restaurant, I wondered why it wasn't better. The chef is known for the FleurBurger after all. Then Mr. Joy reminded me of the episode on Top Chef when he didn't do so well with the burger challenge.

Barely any effort to announce your name when called good thing I was standing within 5 feet of him. He just seemed very uninterested in being there. \n\nBurger was perfect. And that's why you come to burger bar. \nThe staff is not as good as the Las Vegas location. I was brought skinny fries instead of the fat like I ordered. The guy that came and brought us our food could barely speak English so figuring out whose order was who's took a little bit of work. It was not a big deal since there were only 3 of us. Everyone's burger was cooked perfectly. My friend ordered the truffled mayo and all 3 of us tried it and tasted no truffle at all. My chipotle aioli was quite good as a spread not too overpowering. \n\nTwo of us got shakes a mint and a salted caramel. Damn they were good!!!

Luckily, Burger Bar is not quite as popular as Cheesecake Factory, so I was still able to make a reservation with only a couple hours notice on a Saturday night. Unluckily, my girlfriend and I got seated in one of the few booths at the restaurant; this meant that we didn't get to enjoy that spectacular view of Union Square that is half the draw of this place. I would have easily traded the booth, with its embedded TV, for the view.\n\nIn terms of decor, think of a sports bar version of the Cheesecake Factory. They managed to cram plenty of seating into this place, but there isn't much in terms ambiance.\n\nIn any case, here's what I had to eat...\n\nThe Hubert Keller Burger, which features buffalo meat, caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese (yum!) on a ciabatta bun, was absolutely delicious, and the (alcoholic) Mint Chocolate Chips Milkshake was pure decadence.

My friend had spoken highly of this place so we gave it a shot. \n\nI'm not sure what everyone is talking about, but wen it comes to service, they did just fine. They were fast, and checked on us. They didn't fill our waters until we asked but I didn't mind that. \n\nI ordered the hangover burger. I felt it was the most bang for buck. It was the only burger that came with fries. It was a reasonable price at 13$. It was very delicious! I loved that sauce. However, the sauce can make everything soggy, and if you eat slow or just don't want a soggy burger, I suggest ordering the sauce on the side. The fries was superb! Moist inside and crisp on the outside. It was enough to share with my bf. I ordered mine medium rare. \n\nMy bf ordered the Kobe with ciabatta bread, I think, and pepper jack cheese. He ordered his medium. His burger was pretty good too. You can definitely taste the difference between meats. \n\nThis place can get pretty pricey. If you choose the custom burgers, you choose a bread that could be .75 to I believe a $1. Then you can get a basket of fries and things like that for $5. Or add avocado and other things. \n\nThey have a decent dessert menu which we had no room to try. But what caught our eye was their alcoholic milkshakes for 10$ I believe.

We ordered the Kobe burger ($17.75) and the American Classic burger ($15.75), both cooked medium. The menu claims the Kobe burger is a Wagyu patty that is \"tender, melts in your mouth, and has unmatched flavor.\" The Kobe burger I got was nothing like that at all. It was dry, bland, burnt on the outside, and had no flavor. It also does not come with any sides. The American Classic burger has Angus beef, American cheese, and bacon. It also tasted plain, dry, and ordinary. It came with skinny fries, but the fries tasted old, chewy, and previously frozen for too long.\nService was almost non-existent. I needed ketchup to wash down my bland burgers, but we almost finished eating before the waitress would come check on us. Also, the hostess told us the wait would be about 45 minutes, but ended up being closer to an hour and a half. Even towards the end, I went up to the hostess to check and they said 10 more minutes, but after 20 minutes, they still had not text me. \nI seriously cannot believe people are waiting one and a half hours to eat the worst, overpriced burgers ever. The only decent thing is the view. Burger Bar is on the 6th floor of the downtown Macy's building and if you get a seat in the bar area, there is a nice view of Union Square. It's a high tourist area, but a VERY BAD representation of San Francisco eats. There are lots and lots of great restaurants in SF, but this is NOT one.

We were stuck in the way back of the restaurant, where all the servers hang out. It wasn't atmospheric at all. They've made this restaurant as big as possible, so this other back half feels super isolated from the rest of the restaurant. The decor seemed run down, no theme going on at all.

My wife, our son and myself decided to eat there on Christmas Eve (Sunday 12/24/2017). Big mistake! We got there right before closing, not realizing it closed at 6:00pm. We were seated and it went downhill from there. The waiter obviously did not know what he was doing and he was conversing with us as if he was with us. Very awkward! He didn't know the menu at all. He forgot to bring our waters, disappeared for the longest time and eventually came back with one of the two drinks we ordered. We had to ask about the second drink, it ended up that it was so bad my wife did not even drink it. We ordered the fries sampler and they arrived cold. Our waiter never came by our table so we could address the issue, so I flagged another employee walking by and it just happened to be the manager, although we did not know it at that time. We told him about the cold fries and he said \n\"Oh, ok I will just re-heat.... I mean, I'll get you some new ones\"  \nWTF... Sure enough! HE JUST WARMED THEM UP! And there were less fries when it came back!.... It gets worse. So, our meal arrives and one burger that is supposed to be medium well was just freshly slaughtered...so rare!! I mean  completely raw in the middle. I ordered the sliders and they were cold and hard. Our waiter was informed about our issues and he just stood there telling us that the normal cooks were not even there that night. I asked for the manager. What do you know, the guy that returned our rewarmed fries walked up. What?!? This is the manager? Ok. Well, we started telling him how dissatisfied we were and  he strait up tells us, \"the guys in the kitchen are in a rush because it is Christmas Eve and they want to leave\". What customer wants to hear that the food is crappy because the cooks don't want to be there? To top it off, he only removed the raw burger and half of the sliders. So, we still had to pay full price for some cold-reheated fries and a bad margarita. The worse customer service I have ever encountered at an eating establishment. And dessert? Hell no!!! We were done and eager to leave to enjoy our Christmas Eve in the big City. Or so we thought... It is located on the 6th floor of the Macy's building and there was only one out, the elevator as the store had since closed. Well there was about 25 customers all waiting at the elevator door trying to leave this nightmare or some kind of social experiment!? First of all, the elevator takes a long time to come. We wait until the second time it came back and the doors open, It was still full (The Cheesecake Factory is located just two flights up with customers leaving there as well.) So by time the door opened the third time, still full, I asked an employee where the stairs were located? They told me there are no stairs... WTF... That is SO illegal NOT to have an emergency exit. Then I saw an EXIT sign and asked if we can just go down there. THEY HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME NO!! So I just walked over and checked to see if the stairs really did go down to the street. Once I saw they went down, we told all the rest of the 25 or so people waiting by the elevator that we found the stairs... Oh, and the employees actually tried to stop us all from going down the stairs! The best thing about our experience that night is that we still laugh at the series of events and the utter awkwardness of our waiter and so called manager of a restaurant that is supposedly owned by a renowned chef...ha what a joke!

I was looking for the classical American burger experience, and I was extremely happy with my order.

Boy was I wrong. \n\nDidn't read the reviews on Yelp but I did notice it had an average of 3 stars after 2000+ reviews, so I knew that going in. It was right across the street from where I was, and they had burgers, and they had beer, so it was still a no-brainer despite the 3 stars. \n\nGot seated pretty quickly considering it was prime dinner hour, in Union Square, on a Sunday, during the holiday season (red flag #1). I chose to build my own burger. I opted for the Kobe beef (their most expensive choice at $18) and stuck with normal Monterey Jack cheese, some bacon, and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo). \n\nFood came quickly (red flag #2). I mean it was TOO quick, ya know? Got my burger and there was no bacon. Asked my server for the bacon I ordered (I'm not paying an extra $2 for something I didn't get). She brought it right before my burger was finished! Oh well, I'll just eat it anyway because, hello, bacon! I ate it and I'm pretty sure it was the crap my mom eats- that already-cooked-just-microwave-and-eat crap. It looked like it, smelled like it, tasted like it. \n\nThe meat of the burger, the Kobe beef, the pricey stuff... I ordered it medium rare, which it was, but the outside was so burnt I couldn't tell if the Kobe lived up to the hype. All I could taste was charred meat. I was so bummed. The burger should have been on point, tender, and wonderful- at least that's what the menu said. It wasn't. The bun was also dry and seemed reheated (?). \n\nAfter dinner I grabbed a Red Velvet adult milkshake. It was yummy but not $18 yummy, maybe $10. It was pretty light on the alcohol for the price. \n\nAll in all, after spending $78 there for a burger dinner (and crappy fries), I was totally bummed. It was definitely not the best burger joint in all the land as I had hoped. It wasn't BAD it just wasn't good. Lackluster is a good word for it. Don't waste your time.

Disappointing.\n\nI went here thinking it would be the same as the Burger Bar in Las Vegas.  It's got the same name, same menu, same \"Hubert Keller\" establishment.  It's the same place, right?\n\nNO.\n\n#1) NO GLUTEN FREE FRIES ANYMORE!!!\n\nThis was the main reason I went there in the first place.  I was super juiced to get some gf french fries which- if you have celiac, you know- basically never happens.  But alas, I was denied the french fry experience.  They no longer serve gluten free french fries.\n\n#2) I ordered the turkey burger - same thing I got when I went to Burger Bar in Las Vegas - and it was this weird, flat, chicken burger looking thing.  I'm *pretty* sure it was turkey (?), but it was not the giant, mouth-watering, thick and juicy, fresh ground turkey burger I had previously gotten at the Vegas location.  It looked (and tasted) like a flat, fresh-from-frozen, hockey puck of a poultry patty.\n\nBummertown: population me, bro.\n\nThe side salad that they gave me in lieu of the fries was surprisingly good, but obviously, I didn't come to a burger place for a salad.  My sister said her burger was good.  And it looked good, as did her fries.  But if you have celiac and want a burger and/or fries, don't bother coming here.  Us celiac folks can get a good enough real beef burger elsewhere for less money, and definitely a better turkey burger basically anywhere.  \n\nPoints for the good salad and still offering gluten-free buns, but otherwise, not so impressed with what comes in between 'em for the price. \n\nSorry Burger Bar.  I may give the Vegas location another shot, but I'm definitely calling ahead of time to make sure it's still the same menu before I go!", "author": "Teenie J."}

Asked if this was an every night thing or if they just happen to be closing early on this night and he just said it depends and they just close it whenever they want. I don't understand why a restaurant would accept reservations online PAST the time they keep their kitchen open and then notify you DAYS after your reservation that they can no longer accept it. Being that it is in the heart of San Francisco you would think they would keep their kitchen open longer. I guess the only reason I give them 2 stars is because they had the decency to call me and tell me, even if it was 2 hours before the reservation. Better than getting there and being without food. Still extremely disappointed and will not be visiting.", "author": "Hannah O."}

I was craving a good quality burger and that's exactly what I got.

Also got the chipotle aioli on the side. My burger also came with a side so I tried their zucchini fries. Every bit of it was better than I anticipated. The only thing that was a bit of a challenge was taking a bite out of that massive burger (it also had thick slices of bacon) but I managed. I think it's awesome that they offer so many options to customize your burger or milkshake. Since it was my first time I decided to stick with the regular menu stuff but would probably be a little more adventurous the next time I visit.\n\nAll in all it was a great dinner. The host greeted us as soon as we got out of the elevator and he seated us right away at a table with a great view of union square. Super chill place. Apparently they do parties too..thumbs up! I also like how the host called the elevator for us as we were leaving our table so as soon as we walked up, the elevator was waiting for us.

Next time if I ever see this on my bill, if i ever come back, your waiters can thank you for me reducing their tip to account for that \"health\" add on you just hit me with. Shame on you.", "author": "karinneh a."}

Touristy, you betcha, but the view of the lovely Union Square garden and shops is tre fancy. Brought to SF from famed chef Hubert Keller (who now is a DJ, go figure), Burger Bar sits atop Macy's and is a huge pull for out-of-towners / countriers, and it will also pull the money right out of your wallet!\n\nYou better believe it's pricey, so my party all went with the American, which is probably the least expensive burger and subbed different cheeses for American cheese, which I love, but not on a $16 burger. The Kobe beef burger also caught my eye, but to be honest, beef is wasted on me. I more care about how spicy or flavorful something is, but it doesn't have to be red and bleeding to be good. \n\nI got my burger cooked medium and it was truly was. Not that I went out of my way to check, I just happened  to be full from IPAs and shots of Fireball from earlier in the evening at 83 Proof, so I cut my burger in half and was in awe of the gently pink center. \n\nWe all got different sides of fries, I had the Onion Rings which were crispy, sweet, and gigantic, my friends had the curly fries and shoestring fries and we all shared Buffalo Chicken Wings. I had a Cider with my meal which cut the richness of the burger with bacon and cheddar, and I got jalepenos ots, of course. \n\nWill I be back? Purrrrrhaps, but with so many other places to try and an ever dwindling bank account, I may find somewhere more in my price range. Thankfully this meal was paid for by my friend since he owed me dinner, so it tasted a little sweeter just for that. AND I'M OUT.", "author": "Crystal C."}

While being in Macy's at Union Square I remembered Burger Bar was on top of the Macy's building (not literally as in rooftop but 6th floor). So, off we go.\n\nFrom the lobby floor at Macy's to Burger Bar the transition was quite simple. Not too confusing. Although alot of hussle and bussle. The combination of tourists stopping snapping away and sightseeing, to the locals, to the employees the area can get pretty hectic. Being that Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf are the tourist mecca of San Francisco the prices can be somewhat inflated. Just an fyi.\n\nOnce at Burger Bar we were seated immediately by the hostess and that's when I realized I should have requested a window table overlooking Union Square....Next time. Looking at the menu the first thing that stood out to me was that $60.00 dollar burger. I said to myself how in the world can a burger be worth $60.00 bucks? I found out soon enough when I saw what was included in this burger.\n \nIt's called the \"Remixed Rossini Burger\" (Kobe beef stuffed with braised short ribs, topped with a lobster tail, shaved black truffles, truffle sauce on an onion bun. \"SOLD\". Not only was this a unique combination but the shaved truffles and lobster tail was my deciding factor. Burger was great, worth $60.00? I think so. Nice flavor, Kobe beef with the stuffed short ribs was delicious, lobster tail was fresh and the truffle sauce went hand in hand. I'd definitely order this giant burger again.  Towards the end the onion bun could not support all the ingredients and the experience started to get sloppy and I refused to use a knife and fork on a burger. I had to put my pride to the side and use that knife and fork or I would have had to resort to eating like a caveman. Extra napkins please!\n\nIn summary, I thought the Remixed Rossini Burger was great. Expensive but nonetheless worth it in my opinion. Service could have been better. Had to wait a while on the menu out of all things. Besides the $60.00 Rossini burger Burger Bar offers a wide variety of burgers. Vegan, Vegetarian to the \"World's hottest hamburger\". Also, you can build and customize your own burger with a plethora of ingredients. Alcoholic drinks were not the best but sufficient and the fries which were tasty come in steak, skinny, and sweet potato styles. I would come back.", "author": "Alastair G."}

One of the chairs was damaged which pinched my daughter's finger causing it to bleed profusely. As I went to clean her up I asked for a new chair and when I got back it was not replaced. I had to ask numerous times for them to bring us a new chair. The restaurant never apologized or offered any type of compensation for the incident.\nAside from that, as one of my guests ordered she asked a question. The waitress rudely  implied that she was too incompetent to order and that someone else should order for her. After such rude treatment, the waitress had the audacity to remind us that the expected tip was 20% and that she had earned it. Overall the experience and service was horrible.

There was a 30 minute wait for our party so we got a name on the list, went to the bar and had a few drinks before getting our table. I had a mojito, it was ok. Nothing spectacular but it was very refreshing on such a warm day. \n\nThe restaurant is really narrow so if you have a decent sized group like we did, there's not a lot of room. But it was all good, just had to move out of the servers way a few times. \n\nWe finally got our table and started to look over the menu. The burgers here are a little more steeply priced than burgers elsewhere, but that should mean it's really good, right? Ok.. So as everyone was ordering, I noticed they had a Kobe burger ($18) on the menu so I went with that...medium rare with Brie cheese, saut\u00e9ed shrooms and grilled onion. Oh, and a plain bun. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth in a Kobe burger. We also had ordered some hot wings and a trio of fried goodies.. Cheese sticks, zucchini & onions. They were good, typical little bar snacks that you can't really mess up. The hot wings were not very spicy at all to me, but everyone else at the table found them to be spicy.. Flavor was good, they could have been a little crispier though, not a fan of soggy chicken skin. I wish I got a picture of the wings... Oh well. \n\nFinally our food came out. I was so excited to get my burger and once it came out....... It wasn't what I had ordered. I mean, it kinda was, but it wasn't. It was the Kobe (or so they said it was) with Brie, shrooms and grilled onions but it also had avocado and was on a wheat bun. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado and am a fan of wheat buns, it's just it wasn't what I had ordered. Low and behold, my bf's cousin noticed his burger was wrong too. His was on a plain bun and had no avocado. Minor mistake but still... I saw our waiter write down everyone's order exactly as we were ordering it. It took a hot minute for us to find our waiter so we could tell him that out orders weren't correct, he finally came around and took the food back. Oh yeah, another person in the party had ordered a separate order of fried zucchini sticks which never came out, luckily it didn't end up on their bill. Finally our \"correct\" burgers came out, but they both were still wrong. Mine had avocado and the bf cousin's had no avocado. LOL it's just a matter of switching it off, I know BUT STILL! The waiter ended up bringing an extra side of avocado out for the cuz and I got avocado I didn't order, but I didn't complain! Finally I got to bite into my Kobe burger.... One bite and it wasn't medium rare. It was medium. The bf cuz's burger was overcooked as well. What can you do... We were both over it by that point. Anyways, the manager ended up coming to our table and asking how our experience was, so we told him what had happened. He ended up taking 50% off two burgers, mine and the bf's cousin's because of their error. My burger went from $30 (yes $30) to $15... Which is what it really should have been at full price because that burger was sure as hell not worth $30 lol. \n\nService here is not the best when it comes to waiter attentiveness. The wait staff seemed frazzled, unfocused and irritable. Final outcome: There are a ridiculous amount of better burger places in the city.

There was a party of about 20 or more and were accommodated nicely. \n\nI've never been to Burger Bar before so I wasn't aware of this but there are several menus here. There's the standard restaurant menu which you receive when you walk in to dine. This time, we were given separate menus which are labeled according to price. We were initially given $31 menus which consist of an appetizer course, meal course of your choice, and a dessert of your choice. The host requested $27 menus which only consist of the first two listed in the $31 menu minus the salmon sandwich.\n\nThe dessert looked good though...so I got it. The desserts were milkshakes so I got the Caramel Latte flavor. Really pretty presentation and delicious in every way (very generous with caramel) but DAMN. REALLY overpriced. $10! I didn't know how much it cost until I got my check!\n\nThe appetizer course consisted of beer battered jalape\u00f1o pickles, onion rings, and zucchini fries. Another table had yam fries in place of zucchini fries. All of the appetizers were delicious. The table favorite was the onion rings because they're irresistibly crispy. This appetizer course came with a trio of sauces: chipotle aioli, BBQ sauce, and house ranch. All three were good but the favorite was chipotle aioli.\n\nThe meal course consisted of a few choices in burgers and sandwiches but I chose the American Burger which was a classic cheeseburger with bacon. I chose to get Medium rare but medium rare here is WAY more rare than you would think....so I requested having the medium well which was perfectly pink and juicy.\n\nThe quality of the burger was good. It was very juicy and delicious but not totally memorable. The fries were pretty good. I appreciate good fries.\n\nService was also really nice and attentive. The only issue we had with the service was the communication between the cooks and the servers who gave us our food. Several of us ordered the same burger but with different variations of done-ness. I had to cut into everyone's burgers just to figure out which ones were which and in the end a lot of us had to have them recooked because they were less well-done than we were expecting...if that makes sense. \n\nTotal (for me) came out to be around $50. DAMN. Even if I didn't buy the milkshake? Still $40! Crazy expensive. I don't think I would plan on going back here for burgers unless it was a really special occasion on someone else's request.", "author": "Sofia R."}

The meat was prepared medium rare as ordered, and it was moist and juicy!  Toppings didn't overwhelm or overpower each other.  I thought the shaved asparagus was especially good, adding a slight crunchiness with each bite.\n\nI didn't use all of the truffle mayo on the burger, but used it as a dip for the curly fries. The curly fries, but the way, were a little on the soft side, but still had a nice crispiness on the ends and edges.\n\n Service was efficient, but friendly, and my order came out quickly.  The burger was pricy, but very good.\n\nWorth coming back?  Yes, but next time I need to order a shake!", "author": "Steve L."}

And my stomach. But mainly in my heart because of my amazing boyfriend :)\n\nThe first sign of priciness is that you can get to this restaurant either by riding 6 floors on the elevator or 6 flights on the escalators in a Macy's shopping complex. The next sign is the mini televisions found in each of the private dining booths, just in case your dining companion isn't interesting enough. The third sign is the section on the menu talking about the chef Hubert Keller. And the most obvious sign is the dollar signage itself.\n\nBurger Bar has a very eclectic range of burger choices, including the famous Kobe beef burger. But it confuses me as to why someone would eat high quality Kobe beef in the form of a minced meat patty. I'm saving the popping of my Kobe beef cherry for my next trip to Japan yeeee.\n\nOpting for simplicity, I ordered the BLACK ANGUS BEEF BURGER on a whole wheat bun with all the fixings (tomato, red onion slices, lettuce, dill pickle sliver), $9.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-san-francisco?select=ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA#BXAy9QGxuDAx4C8okc2Onw), adding a side of BUTTERMILK ZUCCHINI FRIES for $3.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-san-francisco?select=ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA#J-Dnjkonuy9QGs-1HS6rRA). My boyfriend ordered the AMERICAN CLASSIC, Black Angus beef with American cheese and crispy bacon on a sesame bun, for $14.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-san-francisco?select=ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA#gnVWAd-L_0H9M_cBRDvBhA), and the burger comes with your choice of fries. He chose the SWEET POTATO FRIES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-san-francisco?select=ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA#x50roHgFd1JlPFWXBCp7hA), which are normally $3.55, the same price as the regular fries. Unsure if he could've substituted the more expensive fries. Hm, thinking on it, I should've just gotten the Monterey Jack combo ($13.95) or the American classic combo because it comes with fries, which are already $4, AND the burger comes with cheese. Always on the lookout for cost-effectiveness ;)\n\nWe both asked for medium-rare, and I have to say that my medium-rare was done well (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-san-francisco?select=ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA#ma5-fEYSpDATSc3Mq3U5XA). Raw has never looked so good, amirite? ;) Unfortunately, my boyfriend's leaned more toward a medium-medium-rare, but at least he had bacon!\n\nThe sweet potato fries were thin and crunchy, enjoyable but not memorable. The buttermilk zucchini fries were delicious, largely due to the lipid-licious batter. I'm not even certain that each fry had zucchini in it...\n\nAside from the food, the service was spectacular. Our waiter, John, was amiable, attentive, and all-around awesome, especially since he played along with my boyfriend's request haha :)\n\nDespite having exotic menu choices, Burger Bar does their basic burgers well.

They had TV's at the bar so we were able to catch the soccer game. The service was good, everyone was friendly and attentative. \n\nThat being said, the food was just okay. I don't think the quality is worth the price. When I pay  more than $15 for a burger, I expect something more substantial. I got the slider trio bc I wanted to try a variety of burgers (I was curious about the buffalo burger, I've had bison and it's GOOD). I liked the slightly sweet buns that it came on, but the meat could've been better. I got them medium rare so I expected them to be juicier. They also lacked a lil flavor. On the plus side, they gave me a ridic amount of fries!\n\nMy bf got the one of the signature hamburger (sorry forgot which one), and we weren't impressed. Basically just a patty on bread with some cheese and bacon, with tomato,  lettuce and onion on the side. I think the quality of the meat wasn't what we expected and that's why the flavor was lacking. \n\nAfter our meal we both said we could've gone to In and Out and been more satisfied.

Sadly, we were extremely underwhelmed with this place. \n\nFirst, it's inside a mall. Inside Macy's, to be exact. That was really strange to find. We still held out hope, we were hungry and excited to be on vacation. \n\nWe were seated next to a wall with absolutely no view. There were multiple open tables next to windows so we requested to move and were denied. Not sure why, as some stayed open for a while and other people eventually got seated there. Maybe they had reservations? Either way, the way our request was handled was odd.\n\nOur waitress seemed almost offended at having to serve us, very dismissive. Still, we were happy to be eating and chalked this up as a place that seemed like a typical suburban chain restaurant.\n\nThen the strangest thing happened. I went to the restroom and when I returned, the waitress was practically sitting on the table talking to my BF about her weekend plans, laughing and giggling. As soon as I returned, she took off. BF said it was really strange. As soon as I was back at the table she returned to her gloomy demeanor. So, a waitress who hits on my BF while I'm away, but can't be bothered to help us otherwise?\n\nTwo stars is simply because the food was good enough for a quick lunch. Maybe a little overpriced.

We had our team lunch here and were seated in a private banquet area that seats about 40 - 60 people. 2 50\" HDTVs on the walls and a gorgeous view overlooking Union Square.  \n\nThey have a pre-set menu that had fried zucchini, fried pickles, and onion rings served with three sauces (BBQ, ranch, and thousand island/tartar?  I forget.) as the appetizer.  They have two choices of burgers (American Classic or Hubert Keller)... and a salmon burger (Atlantic Salmon Steak) and veggie burger (Chef's Veggie) for those that don't eat meat.  Dessert was the Milkshake Paddle which was an assortment of milkshakes... a sampler of all their most popular milkshakes (Nutella, Caramel Latte, or Strawbery).\n\nThe appetizer was good at first cause I was starving but after maybe 5 minutes, it was starting be overwhelmingly fatty because of all the fried batter and I only really liked the onion rings.  @___@  I ended up just taking off most of the batter and eating the insides..  I had the American Classic medium rare with mushrooms.  Burger was standard, classic.  Nothing amazing.  I don't know if it's because of our huge party or what and just tried to get everyone's food out as soon as possible... but it seemed like they weren't putting enough time and effort into grilling our burgers.  My burger actually came out more rare than medium rare.  It was almost undercooked. :c  The fries weren't amazing either, just your normal ol' fries.  The milkshakes were not for me and too sweet for my liking.    A very normal burger meal.  Actually, a very heavy meal ... felt like 3000+ calories in one sitting. x_x  Goodness.\n\nWhat I will give a huge applause for, is the amazing service that we received.  Over the course of our time dining there, there was at least 1 waiter at any given time (from when I was actually on the lookout) of the 4 that tended to our party.  Any additional asks that we had, were all accommodated for and they were very quick and efficient at serving our food/drinks and taking our orders!  They actually forgot my mushrooms with my burger, but right when I mentioned it to our waiter, he immediately took care of it and brought me a side of mushrooms to add to my burger!  I know it's hard sometimes when you have to deal with huge parties, but huge + to Burger Bar for the great service!!!", "author": "Carena N."}

I came here for specifically to try the Hubert Keller Burger (buffalo). I never had freshly, made, ground buffalo before (I bought frozen patties at Traders Joe's). I've heard that buffalo meat is really tasty and not gamy at all. I had the buffalo burger and I liked it a lot. The burger was moist and not heavy. As people have said to me that buffalo meat is lean meat that doesn't have a strong taste. After having this burger I believe them. The other items I liked were the alcoholic milkshakes. I can't think of a burger joint where you can have an alcoholic milkshake. I ordered the French Kiss and you can feel a slight buzz, but the alcohol was not overpowering.\n\nMight not be fair but this rating is based upon my comparison with Fleur De Lys.

We also ordered onion rings. They gave you generous amount of onion rings. Its too much for 2 people. \n\nI probably would go back again and try other burgers. .  I see people ordering sliders. Or maybe i can try their build your own burger. I am also intrigued about their surf and turf burger. I will give it another try and bring more people so we can order and share different types of burger. \n\nI think it would be a nice idea to have a burger tasting on their menu? \nPrices are ok but not cheap.

Everything from the long wait to take an order to forgetting to put bacon and a bacon cheese burger. With that aside i will only talk about the food now...\n\nIn burger subcategories - this place falls into the gourmet burger section. Offering standard cheese burgers all the way to kobe beef and foie gras burgers. I had the chef special - Hubert Kellar. Which is buffalo beef toped with spinach and blue cheesed top with a red wine reduction sauce. Sounds fancy, but fit and finish did not come thru well. The blue cheese was over powering. The meet just fell apart when i was eating, while the chiabata bread was soaked in its fat that it became soggy. I should have just stuck with the cheese burger. Overall taste was feasible. I think if they put a little bit more work in polishing the burger - it would have been really good. I guess Hubert wasn't in the kitchen when i made the order.\n\nOn the up note... i did order a ridiculously priced alcoholic milk shake ($11). I had the mint chocolate with mint liquor. I did not taste any alcohol.Although the consistency was perfect. One of the more enjoyable milk shakes i had in my day. \n\nWell. Overall the food tasted better than most burger joints.

So there's 1 star. \n\nAfter looking over the menu, I told my family I would much rather go somewhere else to eat. As most people mention in the reviews, it's way too expensive for what you get. Yes the view is great, but if you're not right by the window then it just feels like you're at any other burger joint. \n\nIt took the waitress around 5-7 minutes to come over and take a drink order. Then another waitress came by, introduced herself and asked what we want to drink. After telling her we ordered with another waitress, she proceeded to take our food order with no explanation as to who the first waitress was. After looking over the menu it was clear that most of the burgers did NOT come with fries as the menu had a detailed fry/onion ring section with various prices. Some burgers said they came with them, but most did not. So we ordered a fry sampler and 3 burgers that didn't say it came with fries. Food came and 2 out of the 3 burgers ordered came with fries and additionally we got a fry sampler for $12. Why did the waitress not inform us when we asked about the fries and how many people could share them that 2 of the burgers come with fries? The burgers were pretty good. There's the second star. The waitress wasn't very good or attentive. She did ask if everything was ok but as she was staring at 3 empty drinks. I mentioned to her that it wasn't necessary to order the fry sampler because the burgers already come with them. She responded ,\"Oh yeah it IS a lot of fries!\"  Then concluded the meal with, \"Do you guys want the check?\" Well....not really! For 3 people it was $75 before tip for 3 burgers, fry sampler, a beer, and soda. Should of gone to IN-N-OUT. \n\n Throughout meal I also recognized some un professional matter by wait staff. One waitress was eating snacks in a drink station that was visible to customers. Another waiter had a really bad attitude about a large party splitting the bill.

By that time, it would be dang near dinner! There was a measly five minute wait at the Burger Bar, so it was going to have to do the trick.\n\nMy lady friend bought me some nice crystal decanters at the Macy's while we waited. I reckon I'll put some fine whiskey in them when I get back home. Mighty fine whiskey.\n\nNice views at this here place, if you get a spot by the windows, which we did. Some lady at a table next to us wanted to take a picture of them skaters in that there Union Square. She kept leaning around us trying to snap up a shot. It wasn't that annoying, but it was mighty weird. She had a disposable Kodak camera, the yellow and red kind. I thought they stopped making those after the two towers fell down. Damned terrorists.

Some got a beer, but not all of us did.  In the end, when we split the bill we paid $35 per person - for some burgers and fries?!!!!  I should have anticipated this, since Burger Bar is located in Union Square.  This is why I was borderline ready to give 4 stars, but I was just not happy enough to be so generous.  If you are going to charge high prices, at least have the food be incredibly delicious or have that something extra (because location) that justifies the cost.\n\nFor example, the ambiance feels just like a simple burger joint (with high tables and high chairs) rather than something a bit more classy (booth seating).\n\nFor what it's worth, our server was friendly, and the hostess was friendly and responsive.\n\nLikely won't be back for a while...maybe just for the dessert or a beer.", "author": "Elisha Y."}

I know I'm not supposed to, but I thought my burger experience here was pretty solid in a strangely unexpected way. You should know I've been avoiding this place for months because of two arbitrary but palpable reasons. The first is Hubert Keller not because he's not a great chef but because serving burgers strikes me as slumming for the man who revitalized Fleur de Lys' reputation. The second is the undesirable Cheesecake Factory-in-Macy's vibe I get when I'm stuffed into an elevator only to find myself in a waiting queue as if I was holding an E-ticket for a Tomorrowland ride. \n\nImagine my surprise when Jamie W. and I found ourselves immediately seated on a Sunday evening the moment we saw the hostess when I expected to see half the East Bay and a lot of the South Bay filling the tables. As we were perusing the menu, we could see why they weren't there. The exorbitant prices. After I put my eyeballs back into their sockets, I noticed there was a pretty wide fluctuation in price points that you have to study to know what you're getting. I was immediately drawn to the left side of the menu, the Chef's Burgers since they came with skinny fries. The a la carte side on the right just struck me as a nickel-and-dime operation meant to cater to anal-retentive burger lovers with bottomless wallets. \n\nJamie ordered the $14.50 American Classic, which sounded pretty standard down to the addition of bacon, all on a sesame seed bun (see photo). Mine was a marginally more daring choice, the $13.75 Black Jack Burger which came with melted jack and a spread of tapenade, all in a ciabatta roll (see photo). I threw caution to the wind and also threw in a $1.25 order of oyster mushrooms on top. Both were seriously delicious with the Black Angus beef fresh and cooked to order. We definitely didn't feel like they were skimping on the ingredients. \n\nThe $3.25 Diet Cokes came with free refills, a big plus, especially on Jamie's checklist (see photo). And the view is nice if you can get a table next to the window. I only noticed later that there were TV screens in the booths, which I felt was rather ridiculous if faster turnover is necessary when the throngs of tourists come in. There's no getting around the prices, even though I am more than willing to overcome my elevator phobia to have another one of Keller's burgers. The happy hour specials strike me as a good time to gorge. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...an excellent burger but you need to empty your pockets a bit \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...has that unmistakable Cheesecake Factory vibe to it \nSERVICE - 3 stars...better than I anticipated but still a bit shaky \nTOTAL - 4 stars...I honestly would have no hesitation coming back some time for another burger...it was tasty for sure", "author": "Ed U."}

We ordered two burgers, waitress said the chef recommended medium so we ordered them that way.  They both came very well done and were really small pathetic little things.  The flavor was fine but they were definitely not juicy and relied on the melted cheese and other toppings.\n\nI asked for no tomato.  It came out without a tomato but clearly there was one on it at some point before it came out as the lettuce was covered in tomato juice and tomato seeds so I couldn't have it.  Not sure why they wouldn't just replace the lettuce, that would have cost a few cents.  Waitress was no where to be found so I chose to eat the hamburger warm without lettuce instead of waiting.\n\nOrdered two cocktails - was surprised they would send out drinks looking so sad.  One drink called for a pineapple garnish - the piece of pineapple had mold growing on it and yet was pale - so it was both unripe and growing mold (not sure how they even pulled that off).  The other drink was a martini and it was just mediocre.  I thought going to a restaurant called \"Burger Bar\" that has a martini in the logo - that a burger and a martini would be a safe bet, but they really did not deliver on it.\n\nThe most disappointing part is that the first time we went there the burgers were really good.  \nIt seems like no one there really cares - the waitress didn't bother to walk all the way up to our table to check on us so no corrections could be made.  At one point she just kind of called out from a few tables away.  Decor is not kept up - space needs a refresh.\n\nWhen the bill came they did that thing where they calculate tip options at the bottom of the bill to save the customer from doing math.  They calculated from 20 - 25%.  It was optional of course but I just had to laugh - if you are going to assume 20% tip on the low end perhaps your waitresses should actually come to the table to check on people.\n\nGreat location and views if you get a table by the window.  They did give us a great table and the host was very welcoming and sweet so it wasn't a one star experience.", "author": "David B."}

We, however, found two seats at the bar, and decided to just sit there, so we didn't need to wait. I assure you this was just plain, good luck. The bartenders/waiters serving the bar were really lacking. There was two of them, and they both looked like chickens with their heads cut off. They were going every which way trying to make the drinks for the tables and trying to serve the bar. It just wasn't good. It seemed like the manager came to try to help them at a certain point, but he didn't really look to know that much more than they did. So, it did take a while to get their attention and get our drink and food orders taken. Anyways, my hubby and I both ordered the build your own burgers. They came out fairly quickly, and were pretty tasty. I had the bison burger patty and it was very appetizing. Sometimes bison can be really dry at restaurants and this was not, which was a pleasant surprise. Not surprisingly, it took quite some time to get our bill paid, which I absolutely hate. A part of me just wants to walk out of a restaurant when the waiter/bartender is nowhere to be seen or doesn't seem to care to check back about the bill.

My girlfriend wanted to order a mojito at this time but she never got the chance to do so because he left so quickly and never came back. Our drinks were never refilled and we had to ask the other staff for refills. \n\nAs a server myself, I try to give other servers a benefit of a doubt. I understand they are busy and have a lot on their pallet.

Yelp friend Simone F organized the outing, a UYE of sorts, which brought together about twenty of her friends and Yelp friends old and new.  I had to leave my job early to attend, but for good friends and good food I'd do it again.  Thanks again Simone for organizing!\n\nThe restaurant set up a super long table for us just beside the bar which made it easier for the beer drinkers to get their brew on.  I was anticipating a call to return to work so I decided to stay beer-free that night and just sipped on the glass of ice water that was provided shortly after I was seated.  I don't drink beer too often anyway, but I often do so in a social setting.\n\nThe name, Hubert Keller, does nothing for me.  Sorry Mr. Keller!  I work nights, I watch very little television and I rarely follow the culinary arts.  Simply put I had zero expectations for this restaurant knowing only that I had read many mediocre reviews judging this Keller dude and his new restaurant simply on expectations.\n\nThe menu is kind of busy and confusing.  Thank goodness I was sitting next to Fong L who had already been here before.  It helps to have someone to help navigate a confusing menu.  Basically one page had burgers all thought out by the kitchen and the opposite page gave you the chance to build your own burger item by item with a specific cost for each item.  I decided to take the easier route, but I was happy to learn that it was okay to add items to the \"pre-designed\" burgers.\n\nAfter a bit of waiting for folks to arrive and get settled in the round of ordering began.  Other people at the table had already ordered milkshakes with the drink orders, and those darn things looked good.  After checking my pocket to make sure I had a supply of my trusty Lactaid Fast Act tablets I went ahead and ordered the alcoholic version of the mint chocolate chip milkshake.  My burger of choice was the American Classic (Black Angus beef, American cheese, bacon, tomato, onion on a seeded bun).  I ordered the beef cooked medium and had a fried egg added onto it.\n\nI was too busy listening in on conversations when my big milkshake arrived, beautifully assembled with liquid already oozing down the side of the glass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=RMY1PNJ8Evaz_V1tqSURaQ).  My photo doesn't capture its awesome beauty well enough.  I hope Fong and Simone got better pics of it.  The shake consisted of mint chip ice cream, hot fudge, mint liqueur, chocolate whipped cream, big chocolate chips and an Oreo cookie.  Oh my!!  This was so good!  The chocolate whipped cream was nice and fluffy yet light as ever with very good chocolate flavor.  The shake itself was thick too.  I can honestly say that I could not taste the liqueur but no doubt this was one of the most incredible milkshakes I've ever enjoyed.\n\nThe food service coming out from the kitchen was a bit spotty.  I was among the first at our table to get my burger, but others at our table waited a long time after our food arrived to get theirs.  The burger came with a side of Skinny Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=Xe7cyB5ko5EmFbsQYj8ATg).  The fries were very generic, but I liked the burger very much.  I forgot to take a photo of the inside of the burger, but my beef was more of a medium rare than it was medium.  The beef had good flavor and it was fresh tasting so I really didn't mind the rareness of the burger.  The quality definitely shows; although, I wished they used a sturdier bun.  The fried egg was one of perfection cooked just below over medium with the yolk just beginning to cook yet having a nice liquid center to ooze out onto the beef.  The bacon was thick and flavorful.\n\nThey brought us complimentary desserts too in the form of their chocolate burgers and cream cheese burgers which looked fun.  I only sampled a bit of the chocolate one which had a thick chocolate ganache burger, a glazed donut bun and some exciting passion fruit flavored gelle that acted as the cheese.\n\nWhen it came down to settling the bill the restaurant had everything already separated based on individual seat locations so determining who owed what was an absolute breeze.  I wish more restaurants would do that for large groups.  That alone helps me to boost my rating up to a 4.  \n\nI'd like to return to try the Kobe beef and more outrageous ice cream concoctions, but until then I'm very happy to have attended this Burger Bar outing.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

However, negative things started happening from the top with the service: three of us ordered various complex shakes, whereas my dad just ordered something on tap. All of the shakes (presumably as if they were all of our drinks...?) arrived at once, as my dad's never came. It took poking another waiter 5-10 minutes later to remind them.\n\nThen came the meals. I ordered the Hubert Keller Burger. Just before it was served to our booth table, the server literally dropped the bun to the ground. The rest \"stayed afloat\" and a new bun was replaced (are they \"pre-crispy\"...?), but that illustrates how all of our service was.\n\nThere was a Kobe beef burger on the menu for $60. I would not pay $60 for this kind of service anywhere. Flavors were fine, so the problem is not in the kitchen. Might just be a summer break thing, who knows...

(6/6/14)\nOverall the experience was 3 stars, but I gave it 4 because:\n\n1. After we were sat the waitress came by and dropped off water for our table. But we waited at least 15 minutes until she finally returned. I wouldn't say that we were provided horrible service because it wasn't; they probably were just understaffed even though it wasn't too busy for a Friday night. The service was good because every time she finally had time to check up on us the interaction was good, even if it was slow and not so attentive.\n\n2. There was a group of horrible, ratchet ladies there for a bachelorette dinner. (Of all places, BURGER BAR??!) Anywho I think every one would agree that they ruined every one else's dining experience today. Screaming, yelling profanities, being ratchets and drunk (or maybe even sober and I would believe it.) For paying about $20-$60 per burger I would say this restaurant qualified as quite classy, however today the vibe wasn't very much so. One couple had their young children with them and everyone can tell they were particularly upset at how rude the women were being. They even covered their children's ears in response of all the profanity of the party.\n\n3. The only factor that made this review a four star instead of three was that the manager on the floor tried to do his job right. Upon realizing that most of his customers were disturbed, he approached the bachelorette party and asked them to settle down. He then proceeded to go around every table in the restaurant and asked how they were doing, while apologizing for the table responsible for all the ruckus. In these types of situations not many managers would come out do what he did. For that I highly respect that and I think he made things better by doing so. But I hope he at least comped part of that family's dinner because the dad left bright red.\n\n4. Most importantly (I guess) onto food. The burgers were very tasty. Melted brie and truffle mayo are highly recommended for building your burger. I don't personally believe in paying more than $15 for a quality burger but I guess you're paying for the view too. Would come back again for the food&view. Hopefully ambience is better next time.\n\nAs for the ratchets of the evening, well congrats bride-to-be. I hope you have a wonderful wedding. And may I suggest Applebee's or in-n-out to hold your \"fancy\" wedding dinner? I'm sure you and your friends will fit right in.", "author": "Vicky H."}

I think it deserves a better location than being at the opposite elevator as Cheesecake factory. I made a reservation for 2 people at 7:30p. We were seated at a table with bar stools looking right at Union Square. Great view, but not that great for someone afraid of heights. Looking down 6 floors while eating your burger? Thrilling.\n\nI wanted to try foie gras on my burger but I wasn't ready to pay $60 yet. You can build your own burger for less expensive and possibly less flavorful. So it's your call. I built mine with kobe beef cooked medium rare, add-on foie gras, sprouts, swiss cheese on a sesame bun. FORGOT to add in sauce. I knew it was missing something when I took my first bite. My burger was definitely juicy enough, the taste of foie gras and burger blend in quite well. I must say, foie gras had an acquired taste. My piece wasn't as wide as my burger, so sometimes I couldn't have a bite full of everything I ordered in the burger. Very fresh ingredients, I must say. I should have chosen a better cheese, like monterey jack or pepperjack. I was afraid of the flavors of the cheese being too overwhelming and covered the tastes of the kobe beef and/or foie gras. It wasn't the best burger I've had, but one of the few good ones I've had in SF. Definitely coming back again and perhaps build a better burger to serve Burger Bar some justice.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection, tried the Union Jack IPA, went pretty well with my burger. the restaurant had two rooms, one with the bar tables and large TVs and the other room more romantic and quiet. Service was great, I liked my server a lot, very friendly and didn't forget about us just because we were at a corner seat.", "author": "Connie C."}

It has a very clean polished interior and we were seated right away at a table next to the window wall with a breathtaking overhead view of Union Square during Christmas time (lights, giant tree, ice skating rink and all). We ordered the Bison burger, which was juicy and tender, and also the sliders. They were nice enough to let me sub fries with mozerella sticks. If you come here, definitely come for their signature beer floats and spiked milkshakes. We got the French Kiss spiked milkshake which was amazing in taste (like a gourmet chocolate cake) but had a low to non-existent alcohol content, so dont expect to get drunk off them unless maybe you ask your server or are a lightweight.

I came here for a Christmas party with my dental office few weeks back and were totally looking forward to it.\n\nThis place is cracking, so make sure that you make reservations. The guy who is in front is sort of harsh, so make sure you have a reservation of check in with him before he hunts you down.\n\nWe had a wonderful view right next to the window where we could see the city. The tables and chairs were set high like a bar setting, and we were seated and assisted promptly.\n\nThe menu offered a variety of specialty burgers, (even a vegetarian option), along with the most expensive burger on the menu, a kobe beef burger for 60.00. I ordered the \"le frog\" burger, a delicious burger with brie cheese, grilled mushrooms, and asparagus shavings, and it also came with a serving of fries. The burger was very good. The meat was juicy and the melted brie added the perfect punch. The only downfall was the incredible thick and doughy bun. Towards the end of the meal, i had to just remove the bun and eat the meat. One of my coworkers ordered an order of onion rings to share, and those were quite tasty as well. They were huge and had the perfect crunch to them.\n\nService was prompt and everyone was sweet. I'm not sure this is a place I would frequent, but I would most likely return because I want to take my hubby there. :) I'd have to say that it's slightly overpriced, ranging from 16-30 dollars (not including the 60.00 kobe beef burger).

First one was a Pyramid Hefeweizen which wasn't cold at all (sorry but I like my beer ice cold) Second was a Lagunitas IPA which was extremely cold so they made up for with that one.

And there's nothing too special about them. Tasted just like the burgers I make at home. Just greasier. The fries were pretty good, but nothing amazing. \n\nI think the service was seriously the worst part of my Burger Bar experience. I don't know if our server has having a bad day, or if it's just their policy to be rude to their customers, but she was horrible. For example: \n\nMy family really likes to have their burgers cooked rare, including myself. When I ordered mine rare, the server advised against it, so I figured that since she worked there she probably knew what she was talking about. My sister also ordered hers rare, and the lady explained to her that it wouldn't be as good. However, my sister was set on getting a rare burger. No big deal, right? Wrong. The lady got really pissy, like she was offended that my sister didn't take her advice. \n\nWhen our food came, a lot of the orders were missing some of the items that required an additional charge. For example, they charge extra for certain sides or ingredients (truffle oil mustard, bacon, etc.) The server did give attitude for us asking for our items THAT WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR. Also, some of the burgers were cooked all wrong. My sister, who ordered rare, got medium rare. It was pretty obvious because it looked just like mine. My cousin, who ordered well done, ended up getting an extremely rare burger. He ordered one of the simplest items on the menu: a cheeseburger. Yet somehow, they managed to screw that up. \n\nWe had a group of nine, so gratuity was automatically added. Even though the service was shitty, we're not monsters so we didn't complain about having the tip be automatically added to the bill. We asked a question about the bill--which literally had nothing to do with whether or not she would get her tip--and she snapped about how there's nothing she could do about it being automatically added. She also rolled her eyes, and told my uncle they couldn't take his card (which they eventually did and it went through with no problems.) \n\nOverall, I probably won't be returning to this place.

While it's location near Macy's and the Cheesecake Factory make it appear as if it's another 'mass production' establishment, I find it to be anything but.  \n\nDon't just stuff your face with one of these burgers, take little bites and enjoy!  You can really taste the difference between this quality meat and cheap ground beef.  I'm notorious for eating quickly, and last time I was there I prolonged my burger consumption to a personal record of about 20 minutes.  My only wish is that they would offer a larger version of their burgers for gluttons like myself.  My personal favorite?  The Peppercorn Burger with sweet potato fries.\n\nPlus, who couldn't love a place with alcoholic milkshakes and beautiful views of Union Square?  Nicely done, Hubert Keller.\n\nUpdate:  I went back for the Peppercorn Burger and it was delicious as always. I noticed the World's Hottest Burger on the menu so I had to go back and try it the very next day.  It was great--not the world's hottest for sure, but really flavorful and lots of good heat.  Despite these yummy eats, I have to pull back a star from 5 to 4.  The burgers are still a bit small for my taste, and I was really annoyed by a 30 cent charge for a one ounce side of ranch.  How stupid is this when I ordered a $20 hamburger with sweet potato fries (which, by any standards, should rightfully be served with ranch to begin with)?  Hubert, make me a bigger burger or stop with the silly charges and you can have your star back.", "author": "Alex H."}

This place was pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon, we waited for about 15 minutes and our shakes finally came out. Mr Keller was also standing near us briefly while talking with management. \nI ordered a vanilla shake and added oreos and chocolate chips. The price for the shake was a bit steep ($7.95) and the size was a 16oz but the shake was actually pretty good.

We walked in late on a Saturday night and were seating at the window in the bar area. The seating is tight and the noise level is high but the view and milkshakes compensate. \n\nFor starters we each got a shake: Black & White and the Nutella. OMG go with Nutella! I loved it and would go back for this alone. \n\nFor dinner I went with a build ur own Kobe Burger with Cheddar, Button Mushrooms, and Avocado with fat fries which was yummy until I tried my Man's Hubert Keller Burger with skinny fries which was amazing. Definitely what I will order next time. As far as the fat v. skinny fries well neither out performed the other so I have no complaints. \n\nOverall the place offers a pricey but good experience. \n\nNow about the place. Deco was super sub par. Nothing other than the view made the place look good. Now lets discuss bathrooms. Yup, bathrooms. I am a fan of staying healthy so I wash my hands before every meal. When I got to the bathroom I realized the ladies had one single use stall which was occupied for what seemed like forever. What is this Starbucks?!? When I saw a staff person I asked if there was another ladies room and they pointed me to a door that was covered by a large plant on the opposite wall.

We were there the weekend after Christmas and found the seating time to be adequate. We requested a nice window so we could sit and enjoy the view of Union Square and told the lady we'd wait for the right seat, when we were seated, there was like a 5 foot tall christmas wreath in our window, at this point I could see where this was going.  \n\nThe waitress came to take our order, we started with water and a beer, no appetizers. We had seen the sizes of the burgers coming out to the other guests so we decided to share our meal, the burger arrived and it was dry like shoe leather, the bun was hard and the fries were cold and stale. I had initially asked for mayo and some bbq sauce on the side, this never arrived. I had to ask the waitress again for the squce and mayo, she tried to make it a point that the server should've brought it out....at this point, I really don't care who was supposed to bring it out, just bring it.  I had to constantly ask for a refill on my water and beer which again, finding my waitress was painful.\n\nWe were shocked when our bill arrived....she charged us $2 to split our burger!  Who does that?  Secondly, we weren't notified of that...I would've cut that damn burger with a chain saw on my own...what a rip off.\n\nNeedless to say, she received no tip...actually she did...tip was \"next time, notify the customer of a $2 split burger fee, don't serve up cold fries, and make sure they're water glasses and beer glasses are full.\"  this is no lie, I wrote that on the bill!", "author": "Tony C."}

I was excited by the idea of it. With a place like this I wouldn't expect it to be inside of a Macy's. When I first got there, mind you it took me a little while to locate, I went to the elevator and thought \"is this even working?\" The light on the elevator button barley lit up. When I walked into the restaurant I wasn't even greeted by anyone, which struck me as odd. I saw my friend right away and sat down. We were right at the window which would have been lovely if there wasn't a banner that was semi transparent blocking the view. During the entire lunch it was hard to hear my friend because it was loud in the place. I can't remember if this was due to all the people or due to the TV or music. \n\nOur waitress was nice and came over quickly. Almost a little to quickly because I hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. Having looked at the menu briefly online before I arrived here I knew I was going to get the cheaper of the burgers which was the Turkey Burger on a sesame bun with sprouts and pepper Jack cheese with the Fat Fires. That alone came to $16 (rounding up a little bit). It was good but didn't taste any different than a burger I would make at home. The fires were very good and there were more than I expected. Looking at other thing on their menu I would say it is over priced. \n\nOur waitress was nice but mediocre. She came over once after we got our food and then for the bill. My friend and I split the bill, apparently that was too much for our waitress to handle. I told her what needed to be on each card, however she had to come back to figure it out and then charged it all on my card in the end.\n\nOver all it was nice but I wouldn't go back there. I can get a better burger at the diner down the street from my school.", "author": "Tahanee B."}

I love burgers so I agreed to go. I went in with high hopes, but the overall experience let me down....\n\nWe came in around 9pm on Saturday night and were seated right away. We had a good seat with a decent view of Union Square. The view was great and I loved the vibe of the restaurant -- very casual and fun. This is what saves the restaurant in my opinion. \n\nThe food idea is a cool idea. You get to build your own burger in a way by picking your own bun type and fillings. I like this a lot. But, my liking of the burgers ended there. When my food came out, the burger was just mediocre. For the $16+ price tag and by being able to pick what I wanted on the burger, I was expecting excellence and it just wasn't met. Boo to the burgers! My boyfriend also said that his burger didn't meet expectations either and he didn't finish his. As for drinks, the boy got a build your own milkshake (which he loved) and I ordered a beer. The beer I originally wanted, they were out of (which was a bummer), but the waiter suggested another kind, which was really good. Beer = good times!\n\nService here was lacking. The server never checked up on us once during the 45 minutes we were there and he was just slow in general. No good in my book. \n\nOverall, this is a cool place to hit up for the view and vibe, but that's about it. If you want a great burger, I'd go elsewhere in the city. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Michelle M."}

I was impressed with the menu and the view of union square. Normally we will just eat at cheesecake factory so I was stoked to change it up! I got a turkey burger on a wheat bun. Salad fries etc are extra. I was thoroughly impressed with my burger, although it was turkey it was juicy and the bun was crunchy. Delicious. My friends got a kobe beef burger and that was delicious as well. I will definitely be coming back here when i'm in SF. We had NO wait and our waitress was excellent!", "author": "Lauren Ashley G."}

So many different varieties to choose from and you can customize it any way you'd like. Service can be slow and our waiter last night was forgetful and inattentive, but the other time I went, it was fine. \n\nYou got the basic burgers that will cost you $10-$15 or you can go gourmet fancy and get one for as much as $60. Yesterday, I decided to eat healthy and get the Buffalo burger with pepper jack cheese ($18). It came with either fries or mixed green salad. I chose the salad. He got the low carb burger which had no bun, but instead, portabella mushrooms. We ordered a side of zucchini fries too! The beef patties are sooo tender and big. I could barely bite into my burger. I really appreciate the fact that they cook it the way you order it. I wanted my burger done medium and there it was!! Reddish pink on the inside. When I bit into it, droplets of blood and grease dripped down to my plate. Mmmm. I could definitely tell that the buffalo meat was leaner but it didn't take away from the taste. \n\nDessert: We had the cheesecake burger, which wasn't that good. I HIGHLY recommend getting the chocolate burger! Trust me, I'm not too crazy about chocolate, but this one is an exception! Comes out looking exactly like a buger, but it's all sweets. The bun is a warm fluffy donut, lettuce is kiwi, ketchup is strawberries, the meat patty is a nutella patty. Has a cute little mouse mouse for decor. Soooooooooooooo ridiculously good. Milkshakes are a must too!! Can't wait t come back and try their other burgers. Oh! You get a great view of Union Square too...so if you want to people watch, it's perfect.", "author": "Lynn V."}

I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't a larger bar area, but the space itself is pretty small.\n\nWe were seated at a booth, which was pretty roomy. The tall walls of the booth also gave the feeling of a lot of privacy. There was also a small TV embedded in one of the walls of the booth, which I assumed played any big sporting events that would be happening (it was off when we were there).\n\nI did appreciate the interesting assortment of burgers that were available on the menu. I was very curious about the remixed Rossini burger due to the ingredients (braised short ribs, lobster tail, shaved truffles, and truffle oil) and the price (at a cool $60!), but of course I was not about to drop that much money on a burger. I also like all the options that are on the \"create your own burger\" menu. They have a wide variety of various fixings to choose from. \n\nThere's only a few other food items on the menu other than the burgers and this includes chicken wings, fish and chips, and a few salads. Their shakes on the menu were really yummy and came in a pretty and tall glass and their \"build your own shake\" option has lots of ingredients to choose from.\n\nFood quality was decent, but does not set itself apart from all the other decent burger joints that are probably a bit cheaper. I did not think that there was anything particularly special or unique about the burgers or the menu. \n\nThe one defining quality of this restaurant is the great view of Union Square down below and the view of the San Francisco city skyline at about eye (and maybe even slightly above) eye level. I definitely recommend requesting for a seat next to a window, if possible.\n\nOverall, I think this is a trendy restaurant in a touristy area with great views and only decent food. Good atmosphere, but if you're looking for something unique to the city, this is not the place to look for it.", "author": "Nirel R."}

I was crazy enough to accept my friend's offer. He offered to pay for my meal if I could finish the Insane Burger and a beer. I've done spicy food challenges before so I thought \"Why not?!\" Big mistake...\n\nThe Insane Burger is not even on the menu but a description of it is found in front. It's an Angus beef burger that has The Source hotsauce (6,000,000 Scoville units!!) slathered on top. It also has jalapeno and , habanero peppers, tomato (what?!), chipotle aioli and served on a jalapeno cheese bun. They make you sign a waiver before eating it. \n\nThe burger also came with fries that had cayenne pepper spritzed on it and the plate was sprinkled with cayenne pepper and a nice garnish of habanero.\n\nOk. Now on to the challenge...\n\nFirst bite was great! Had a kick and I could clearly taste the smoky, Angus beef flavor. \n\nSecond bite - \"Hmmm... it's starting to kick in...\" \n\nThird bite - \"Oh man!! What am I getting into?!\" It's about this time that I took a bite and the sauce went straight down my throat! I have never thought I would be able to imagine what it would be like to have red, hot molten lava poured inside my body but this is what I imagine it would be like. My face started to turn all different shades of crimson and my friends laughter started to leak out at about this time. \n\nFourth bite - \"...\" It was about this time that I lost all feeling in the lower part of my face. Dribbles of sweat was pouring down my face and starting to drip from the corners of my eyes. My friend's cameras came out and started snapping away at how I looked. I put down my burger and started downing cup after cup of water and beer. \n\n...\n\nThe pain, numbness and sweating didn't go down until about an hour after I took my fourth and last bite. Fast forward to the next morning and I was clearly reminded why I'm not scared of eating this type of stuff but I'm deathly afraid of that stuff coming out. I had FOUR bites and that thing felt like I was evacuating a poker that's been marinating in fire for hours!! AArrggghhhHHH!!\n\nIn other foods and drink, I also had the Maui Brewing Company Coconut Beer. It came in a can (what?) and had the dark, mocha taste of a good porter. I also had the sweet potato fries that was a great combination of sweet and salty.\n\nNow that I know what 6M Scoville units feels like I can safely say I will never try that again. 1M Scoville's maybe...still gotta try a ghost pepper. =D A grain of 16M Scovilles...maybe. Yes, I'm a sucker for punishment but there's nothing like a new experience.  \n\nI would definitely come back here but never again for the Insane Burger...", "author": "Don D."}

Even the menus scream \"tourist\" and \"novelty\" restaurant with a giant picture of Hubert Keller and menu items like the world's hottest burger. \n\nThe burgers are pricey, easily in the 13-15 dollar range and possibly up to 20-30 if you decide to splurge. I find it a bit silly that you have to pay for every single additional topping, even aioli. I ordered a regular black angus burger with american cheese, caramelized onions, and aioli. The first noticeable thing about the burger is that the patty is almost an inch thick. This, in combination with the puffy bun makes its rather difficult to even eat the burger. The patty itself was somewhat dry, unevenly seasoned, and slightly overcooked to my requested medium rare. When biting into it, almost no juices came out. it was the most clean and unmessy burger ever. My bun looked barely toasted and didn't really do much. They did load up my burger with a ton of caramelized onions, which imparted some nice flavor and the side of sweet potato fries were ok, not very crispy at all though.\n\nOverall an overpriced burger for how mediocre it tastes.", "author": "Tim W."}

I've eaten here before and it was fine... But today seemed off. I've also viewed recent reviews and it seems to just keep getting worst.\n\nI ordered a salmon burger. It did not come with sides (that's extra and the burger alone is already at $10) and when I asked to SUBSTITUTE (in which it didn't say no substitutions) for SPINACH instead of LETTUCE... He still charged me the extra topping at 1.15$.\n\nMy paramour was calling out \"the hottest burger\" and called it BS that it can't possibly be this hot and so he ordered that (he's Mexican btw).\n\nOur food came in 15 mins which was good cause we were starving...\n\nLet's start with the salmon burger...\n\nI got ciabatta bread with it because it's amazing but this bread was chewy. Tooooo chewy. And didn't taste toasty at all. It didn't compliment the salmon well which is crazy cause when I make it at home THEYRE DELICIOUS WITH SALMON. The salmon itself was plain with no flavor. The spinach (although saut\u00e9ed in some oily stuff) was also plain to my palate. No sauce came with it so I drizzled it with tapatio to help. But it just couldn't suffice. I was disappointed.\n\nOK... On to the HOTTEST BURGER.\n\nI took a quick taste of the sauce only and I was on fiyahh! It was hot! I was scared for my paramour. He took one bite and was red in the face. DEFEATED. It really was that hot. So hot it lacked flavor and tastiness. It's one of those foods that it's too much of something that it doesn't even taste good at all. \n\nAfter our unsatisfying meal we ordered calamari to make up for the blah in our food. And MAAAAAAANNNN. The calamari was TERRIBLE as well! It was either uncooked or too cooked. The squid was tooooooo chewy. We ate 3 pieces and left it as is.\n\nLet me tell you about my server though. This guy just added the cherry to a ruined meal...\n\nHe takes our orders. Comes back 30 secs after our food had just arrived... And I told him please bring some milk out because of the burger. He says of course... NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. I was upset. I mean my paramour JUST ate the hottest burger he simply needed the milk, but no he never came. 5 mins later we were passed to another server. In which our waiter failed to tell us he was leaving. This second waiter was GOLD. He was the reason I gave this 2 damn stars. But it was short lived because the original waiter came back only to hand us our bill and scoot us away.\n\nA total for two burgers and 3 beers... 85$\n\nDefinitely a tourist price with a tourist view. \nI mean a Hef is 5$ and they charge 8$ ..

I'm finding that after several lunches here, I'm not overly impressed with their food anymore. There's still some awesome things there (I still love the deep fried pickle spears) but the burgers are kinda not hitting the mark for me anymore. They're not terrible by any means, but the veggie patty really isn't all that I find. It's difficult to eat and most of the time it doesn't fit on the bun properly, making a huge mess and not really being a \"burger\".\n\nToday though, the service we received was poor, borderlining on outright rude.\n\nMy coworker had ordered a salad and requested an ingredient be left out. The salad came out unaltered.  She sent it back and they were pretty quick in getting a replacement out. Except her replacement had bits of the ingredient she'd requested removed (I don't know if they just picked it off or if they made a whole new one and random bits wandered in).  The problem came when she tried to flag down a waiter about the second salad also being unacceptable and it took nearly 10 minutes of waiting for someone to finally come over. She requested a soup replacement and even that took another 10 minutes to come out.\n\nIt wasn't that crazily busy for the service to be that poor on this visit. There were a good number of waitstaff out and around the floor. We felt like we were getting ignored as we were trying to get someone's attention. We had very little service overall once our food was out (dare I say it was nonexistent?) and it was somewhat frustrating by the end of the meal.\n\nI'm on the fence with this place. There's definitely some things I like about it, the potential is there for a lot more.  The prices still make me cringe (I ordered a pop today because I just couldn't handle the $8 price on the milkshakes) and the veggie burger is still kinda on the \"meh\" side, but the pickles are amazing and more than make up for it in a way.\n\nThere's other places I'll likely go to when given the option in the area but this will be kind of on the list of \"maybe, if the other places are too full or closed or I really feel like deep fried pickles\".", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Living in the Bay Area for a summer gave me the opportunity.\n\nBurger Bar attempts to take the classic American diner experience and elevate it to something finer. Keller has succeeded in elevating the prices, but the rest of the experience was a short of the mark.\n\nThere are TVs built into the booths. I understood this choice as television is common in diners, but we were given no control over what was shown. In our case it was an eating competition. Nothing diminishes the appetite more than watching someone devour hotdog after hotdog and proceed to blow chunks. We couldn't turn it off, either. It was distracting and disgusting.\n\nThe restaurant uses higher quality ingredients than a typical diner. Kobe beef was offered for the burger patties. The burger was around $17 and I couldn't taste much difference-- perhaps the reason you don't see a lot of burgers in fine dining. We also ordered milkshakes, but beyond the price we paid, they were nothing special.\n\nThe waiter also made an error with our order on the burger toppings. He said he would bring the correct toppings right away, but didn't return until we were finished eating.\n\nDon't go to Burger Bar unless you like to spend a lot of money on mediocre food.", "author": "Jake L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-25", "description": "So, as some of you who read my reviews already know, I recently went through a five month stretch of eating zero/almost zero beef (side note #1: even after all this time, I still find it weird that I might have \"regular\" readers.  Assuming I do though, you guys are great!).  Though it didn't end up to being as tortuous as I had feared (once I got past the initial withdrawals), there were still a few times that I had some serious burger cravings (side note #2: if you read the opening to my Serpentine review, you'll get how bad I wanted one at that point).  So, with my beef ban over, what better way to celebrate than to go out and get some BURGERS?\n\nWhen our party of three showed up on a Friday around 7:30, we were pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately.  No wait on a Friday night for dinner?  Score!  Table with a mini-TV airing the Giants game?  Double score!  After skimming through their menu, I decided to try my hand at creating my own concoction instead of getting one of their specialty burgers.  After all, with their wealth of ingredients, how could you not be tempted?  So, after some careful consideration, I opted to go with a Black Angus burger on an onion bun with slices of provolone and pepper jack cheese, jalapeno bacon, and, of course, a fried egg.  Along with a Brown Cow milkshake (vanilla ice cream and hot fudge topped with chocolate whipped cream) and baskets of Skinny Fries and Buttermilk Onion Rings we all decided to share, this certainly wasn't a healthy sort of meal.  Dieters beware.\n\nWhen our food was brought out, it looked quite appetizing.  Maybe my cravings had something to do with it, but not much time passed between when the plate met the table and when the burger met my mouth.  The verdict?  Solid, but not life altering.  I liked that the patty wasn't too thick, had some beefy flavor, and was cooked exactly to medium as ordered.  On the flip though, the bun didn't taste like onion to me, though that's probably because everything else in the burger blocked it out.  The combination of cheeses didn't work out too well as the tastes got muddled together, but that's more my fault for doubling up than theirs.  My favorite part was their jalapeno bacon - though it wasn't as spicy as I hoped, it was still flavorful.  And the egg?  Well, who doesn't love a fried egg?  Definitely added to the burger, but it also made it a lot messier to eat as well.\n\nAs for their fries and onion rings, I liked both - crispy, but not oily.  Neither are the best I've had (side note #3: the fries tasted great with the truffle sauce), but both are good companions for your burger.  As for the milkshake, I was a little conflicted.  Outside of it being a little too sweet, I thought it was good.  However, I was disappointed that it didn't come with the excess amount in the metal tin cup like at other places.  I understand that it might not be classy and that they probably measure out exact portions, but at $9.00, it'd be nice to have a little more than just that tall glass to sip on.\n\nDespite hearing only modest praise from friends and fellow Yelpers, Burger Bar was always a \"must try\" given Hubert Keller's reputation.  I could see why people haven't been overwhelmed by their experiences, but I wouldn't say it was a disappointment either.  It's certainly not the best burger in the city, but it's still pretty decent (side note #4: where else would you find a burger that's built around Kobe beef and foie gras?).  I'd say 3.5 stars is about right, but rounding up to four stars since I was in a good mood that night.  Ending a beef drought will do that to you.", "author": "Mike L."}

I love burgers.  I would eat them for every meal if I could, but that's not going to happen.  For being just a burger place, the burgers were only, alright.  They didn't wow, they weren't the best thing ever, they just fell a little flat.  I got the American Kobe Beef Burger with cheddar cheese and that's it. It also came with some veggies on the side to put on top.  I think a really good burger should be good enough without a ton of condiments on it.  It just didn't have a lot of taste, and for almost $17, I want this burger to be amazing.  I want it to punch me in the face and tell me how good it is.  This burger did not do that.  \n\nThis place had a really nice view, a long drink list, and a good atmosphere, so it has all those things going for it, but I probably won't be wating for an hour for an expensive only okay burger again.", "author": "Kimmy G."}

It being a burger focus, we had a few expectations: 1- that it would be over priced because of the view on Union Square, 2- that it would be a decent burger. We got the special for Tuesday which was the mushroom and Swiss burger, was supposed to come with sweet potato fries and a coke but we asked for skinny regular fries and the Burger Bar Amber ale. Turns out they were out of their own ale so had to go with anther choice. Beers were twice as expensive as anywhere else - roughly $8 a beer. Burgers were mediocre at best especially for a place that prides themselves on their burgers. Our order came with sweet potato fries instead so we had to sent it back. Waiter was nice and pleasant but preoccupied by something else. We asked for ranch and the order was missed twice- he finally brought it and comically he had the audacity to say that he was comp'ing the tiny sauce container for us. When the bill came, we used a 10% discount on entrees that Macy's had given us. The bill however did not reflect this discount and when I asked, the waiter went back for clarification, then came back and still could not explain the numbers. He sent over the manager to discuss, however the manager himself could not explain the numbers when I did basic math for him and his answer was \"I don't do math, I just push the buttons\" and hearing my math he said he wasn't going to argue the math. He was overall rude about it and ended up comp'ing a beer but gave us an attitude like he felt we were jerks for checking up on the bill. It wasn't a lot of money, but it was the principle and the way they behaved that made us stick it through. Overall just get In n' out and eat it in Union Square. They have better service and food- oh but forgot our waiter comp'ed the ranch dressing... :)", "author": "Gaby E."}

His eyes bury into their hopes and dreams and with one stern stare he dashes their whole world.  \n\nOn that note, he has a burger joint in Macy's!\n\nThis sits on the 5th floor, and as the elevator doors open you are greeted with a waiting area.  The host(ess) waits behind a podium and leads you into the further seating area.  \n\nThe decor is somewhat confused.  There are notes of classic San Francisco design, with a touch of forced casual encounters.  Big wooden booths are matched with neon signs.  The decor is just an effort to infuse high dining, an homage to San Francisco, and a casual experience (to not intimidate tourists, I suppose).\n\nMy dad and I were met by a server in a cotton shirt (another push for a casual, inviting environment) with waters.  And then came the menus.  \n\nSweet zombie Jesus, the menu.\n\nOk, any menu that claims a $60 BURGER is worthy of being, nay, automatically pretentious.  The burgers range at around $14 or so to the epic $60 burger (still not over it).\n\nI opted to build my own burger, pairing a regular burger with pesto and bacon on foccacia, paired of course with fat fries.\n\nI must say, despite getting an overly-pretentious vibe from the decor and prices, I was impressed.  The ingredients are clearly fresh and high quality.  Easily better than my typical good-burger fall back, the mighty East Bay establishment, Barney's.  \n\nWhile the sandwich was big enough to eat half and bring the other half home for dinner.  It sat heavy in my stomach but did not leave me bloated or feeling self-loathing of any kind.\n\nI wouldn't feel the immediate urge to come back, but it is a good place to hit for bragging rights if you can't afford Fleur de Lyss.", "author": "Andrea C."}

Picked the place after learning the Cheesecake Factory had a 2 hour wait. As someone who won't even stand in line at Disneyland (oh, Space Mountain is badass? I'll take your word for it), I'm definitely not going to wait that long for jambalaya. There's definitely still a wait at Burger Bar, but it's not as depressing.\n\nSeated in a booth towards the kitchen, service was friendly and fast. I ordered a turkey burger on whole wheat ($8.75) with pepper jack (+$1) and guacamole (+$2), along with sweet potato fries (~$3.50). Burger looked small when it came in, but was DENSE. A little too dense, actually...it felt more like eating a meatball than a burger. Sweet potato fries were stellar; a huge improvement to the string fries (bland). \n\nOverall a bit pricey, but for the location it's livable. The milkshakes were alluring, and the vibe was comfortable. One downside were the TV's at each table - you can't change the channel, and we had a middle-aged man at another table staring at the baseball game on our screen. Creepy is an understatement. A waiter noticed, and came up to change our channel to Tyler Perry. Not sure if this was an improvement, but at least it gave us some privacy.

I was kind of wary after reading the reviews, but I was around Union Square area so I decided to try it out anyway.\n\nThe ambiance is alright. The view is nice, but they have fluorescent lighting by the window tables... not sure what that's all about, but it didn't bother me too much.\n\nSomeone on here noted that the strawberry milkshake was delicious, but it was \"tiny\", so her friend had to order 3 of them. I like strawberries, so decided to try it. The milkshake was pretty good, not the best thing I've ever had, but I think they put real strawberries in there and it wasn't overly sweet. It was far from tiny though! It was a pretty decent sized milkshake. I shared it with my boyfriend and it was enough for the both of us. So.. yeah.\n\nWent with the country natural on sourdough with swiss and beetroot pickle. The burgers are pretty decent (ordered mine medium), but lack flavor. I kept having to dip mine in extra ketchup for any kick. And they're so freaking thick! They look kind of small, but I think if you squashed the patty and bun so that they were the thickness of a regular burger, it would be about the size of a regular burger, so overall mass is about the same. Beetroot pickle was kind of a waste of a dollar. \n\nAfter a while though, I got really annoyed with how thick the burger was. I mean, when I'm eating a burger, I don't care how tall it is.

I have seen numerous reviews negatively posted about the service here. However our server seem to be very attentive. His name was Josh I believe, and he was quite busy the place was packed, but he did still keep on top of our service including water drinks etc. \nOnto the food...\nStarted with the wings and their house buffalo sauce with blue cheese dip--very good not outstanding though. I ordered the le frog burger for myself (Black Angus shaved asparagus brie cheese portobello mushrooms truffle Mayo incl. fries). Nyah ordered the American classic which was as you can imagine your standard burger with bacon, cheese lettuce pickle onion tomato. Kind of lame that they charged us for Mayo for her burger. We both ordered medium rare, and that's exactly how it came medium rare. We both felt that our burgers were fantastic. The fries were also good they were crispy not soggy, and they went really well with my extra truffle Mayo hee hee hee hee. Great flavors with the burger! We finished the meal splitting their famous dessert which is the Nutella-hamburger. This was truly a delight. I didn't go into burger bar with super high expectations, but I'm glad that I didn't. I tend to be a little tough as a food critic. Maybe due to the fact that I've been professionally cooking in kitchens for 20 years now ha ha.

French fries and large pickle were served on the side.\n\nThe menu has salads, different burgers beef, chicken, turkey & veggie plus an assortment of fries: potato & sweet potato. Classic burgers with Angus beef start at $8.50. Burger bar also features sundaes and shakes which looked delicious (huge too!)\n\nThank goodness for the well stock bar and large selection of beers on tap. The wait can be up to hour or so on a busy weekend so it is worth it to call for reservations.", "author": "Jim D."}

BB has its own elevator that takes you directly to the restaurant, which is located on the 6th floor and boasts a beautiful view of downtown. BB is more like a Ruth Chris than a normal burger place like Red Robin or Islands. The staff wears fancy, all black outfits. The bar area and the dining room are both dimly lit and really fancy decorated. The one thing about BB that I really loved is that every booth has its own personal, small flat screen television that is hooked up with Direct TV. They actually let you watch what you want, which was cool for my group because we were able to watch some college football while we enjoyed our burgers. \n\nThe menu at BB is pretty impressive. Besides the build you own burger option they also offer many signature burgers, one of which that costs $60 and contains a Kobe beef patty, saut\u00e9ed foie gras, shaved truffles and maderia sauce (not sure what that sauce is but it sounds fancy). They also offer salads, chicken burgers, buffalo burgers and salmon burgers. After looking over the many options on the menu, this is what I created: \n\nCiabatta Bread- Kobe Beef Patty- Blue Cheese- Pepper Jack Cheese- Avocado- Caramelized Onions- Jalape\u00f1o Bacon- Prosciutto- Button Mushrooms- Lettuce- Tomatoes- Pickles- Pesto Sauce- Garlic Aioli \n\nMy burger was fantastic. This was defiantly one of the better burgers I have had from a build your own burger restaurant. The Kobe patty was big, juicy and flavorful. All the toppings were great, especially the jalapeno bacon, which was super crispy and had a nice spicy flavor. To go along with our burgers my friends and I shared an order of sweet potato fries and onion rings, both of which were wonderful. BB also has an incredible dessert menu. They have a build your our milkshake option that offers some of the coolest mix ins I have ever seen. You can mix in things like Nutella, Twinkies, Peanut Butter, and all different types of candies, etc. They also have dessert burgers that use donuts for buns and contain different fruits and other sweet condiments. \n\nSince BB is an upscale place I was expecting the service to be great, and it was. Our waitress was super friendly, even after we kept asking her to change our TV from one football game to another. The entire time we were there, she was very attentive and chit chatted with us whenever she stopped by our table and checked on us. \n\nThe reason I think BB has such a bad rep on Yelp is because of the high prices. Again, this place is an upscale restaurant so I knew ahead of time that I was going to have to drop at least forty dollars for a burger. The burger patty itself and all the toppings were of higher quality so I did not mind the high prices. To be honest it was not the best burger I have ever had but it was still amazing. If I lived in SF I would not eat here on a daily basis because the prices are so high but it is definitely worth check out.", "author": "Craig R."}

The only area that was first-come, first-serve was the actual bar which could seat 15 peeps, 20 peeps at the most. Nothing opened up during our entire wait. To be honest, 50 minutes seemed reasonable considering everyone was in town for the Women's Nike Marathon and not to mention all the Giant fans roaming the streets of San Francisco to watch the game. \n\nWhen we were finally seated and had a chance to look at the menu, we were shocked at the prices of these burgers. $22?! These darn things better be worth it, Chef Hubert Keller!  I was tempted to try the $60 Rossini burger but figured if I enjoyed this meal so much, I might go back and get it next time around. \n\nFor this visit, I decided on the Hubert Keller burger which was buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese. My dinner date ordered the American Classic which was black angus, american cheese, bacon, tomato and onions. I also ordered a size of onion rings extra crispy as per what a few yelpers mentioned in the review.\n\nAlthough we both thought our meals were delicious - they weren't out of this world, never tasted anything like this before, got to have, kind of burger. They had great flavors and were cooked well but I gotta tell ya, I would have a hard time paying $60 for the Hubert Keller burger.  The onion rings on the other hand were fan-freakin-tastic! I think the extra crispiness is what made them great. They didn't fall apart when you ate and the flavors were tasty. We ate ever single one of those babies and there were plenty. \n\nThe decor however was not very charming. It was like a Marie Calendars/Cheesecake factory blended into one. Not sure where Chef Hubert Keller was going with this but if he was going to be charging that kind of money for burgers, he could've thought about the decor a little more. Perhaps an afterthought?\n\nI'd definitely go here again but I'd have to be feeling pretty darn good to order the $60 Rossini burger and might have to try the other $15-20 burgers before I get to that point.

But a burger joint shouldn't be too difficult for a renowned, experienced chef, right? Maybe for Keller it is.\n\nThe Le \"Frog\" Burger, with brie cheese, shaved asparagus, sprouts, and garlic aioli, was just okay. The flavors weren't very strong, so it didn't have anything special going for it. The thick meat patty wasn't cooked enough for a \"medium,\" so it was just an unseasoned, mushy burger. I've also had the Hubert Keller burger, which I had at a \"medium,\" but was strangely too well-done, so it was just an unseasoned, dry burger. \n\nThe one redeeming factor? Burger Bar has some pretty killer fries. Both the regular and sweet potato fries were delicious -- perfectly crispy. The view of Union Square is also a good reason to come up for a drink or two.\n\nAs for the main star of the show, Burger Bar's burgers just aren't good enough for the outlandish prices. In fact, if you just walk a few blocks down, you'll hit Pearl's Burgers, which has burgers that are phenomenally better at 1/3 of the price. \n\nThere are so many delicious burgers in SF that Burger Bar should only be considered if: (1) you're shopping at Macy's and your lazy ass is too hungry and tired to leave the Macy's building, or (2) you are a tourist who doesn't know any better.", "author": "Roy C."}

Also, it's frequently packed to the gills, and waiting could only be not horrible here if you're in need of new ladies undergarments.\n\nLocation aside, noise aside, this place serves - I repeat - the BEST (restaurant) BURGER EVER.\n\nThe HK Burger is not the only superstar burger on the menu (I haven't even tried the chocolate dessert burgers), but it's the best. It's American bison with caramelized onions, sauteed spinach, bleu cheese and red wine-shallot sauce on a ciabatta bun. There's a reason it sounds weird and not-weird at the same time: it's French. Like Keller himself, the burger is French cooking expertise at its finest applied to American cuisine. But ciabatta's Italian! Perhaps. But a baguette in bun form would just be ciabatta, wouldn't it? In any case, it's designed to perform the French bread function of absorbing the meat's juices, and it performs perfectly.\n\nKeller admits he knew little about burgers at all before tasked with creating a burger-themed restaurant. So that's his secret: bypassing the standardization that's happened to the American \"burger\". It's only a grilled red-meat sandwich! Chefs should take that concept and run, but so many top it with the exact same five ingredients. At least the Big Mac uses \"secret\" pickley thousand-island dressing. It's time for more red wine-shallot experimentation. Red meat goes with more than American cheese, lettuce and tomato.\n\nDo make a stop here. If you're a master chef yourself, buy one of Keller's books (his latest has the HK Burger in it, and the Burger Bar has its own recipe book for sale), but be warned: the recipes are as complex as anything in Bon Appetite.\n\nP.S.

The best was the founder's burger - the sauce was delicious and I loved the ciabatta roll. I suggest getting it! \n\nI did enjoy the kobe burger - but for $60? I think it could have been better or cheaper! I definitely won't be getting it again if I come here again. I made the mistake of getting the house burger well done - ALWAYS GET MEDIUM WELL!  \n\nWith the kobe/lobster burger, you get your choice of a cheesecake or nutella burger for dessert. We got the nutella. It was pretty good - with nutella (meat), cake (bun), jelly (cheese),  random nuts, chocolates and the best part - a fake mouse! Super cute! \n\nOverall, I think this place was a cool experience and recommend trying it at least once.", "author": "Mimi V."}

The salmon tastes fresh and its a thick salmon steak. They always cook it well and it's never dry. It's just really tasty and a good option to pick instead of beef. \n\nMy favorite topping are the jalapenos, fresh, not from a jar.

As a fan of Chef Hubert Keller, we weren't going to miss this place. Killer view of Union Square, lively diner-like atmosphere, fun and creative menu which was divided into two sections - the chef's burgers and the \"Ultimate Burger Experience\" or build-your-own.  The build-your-own features four kinds of meat: black angus, country natural (sustainably raised beef), american kobe and buffalo and about 45 add ons.\n\nI opted for the Hubert Keller Burger from the chef's burgers section of the menu. I really wanted the Rossini (kobe beef, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, onion bun) but didn't want to shell out $60 for a burger. The Hubert Keller Burger has buffalo patty, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese, red wine shallot reduction on a ciabatta bun. The burger was flavorful, tender, meat was cooked medium rare and the blue cheese did not overwhelm. It was perfect but I don't think it's worth $22. \n\nFantastic atmosphere, great view, great food, but the value, not so great.

Pretty basic. So why was I waiting for my meal for 45 mins? The only reason I gave this review an extra star was because the bartender was so attentive and friendly. Since he's not a waiter he doesn't have easy access to the kitchen. So when he saw the girls next to me get there food right away (they only waited like 15 mins) He literally walked his ass to the kitchen and brought us our food. He didn't have to do that and he shouldn't have to that.

No fish sticks allowed on this night. \n\nThis was our first time dining here and we all very curious to finally sample and see what all the buzz was about. I had heard all about the $60 dollar burger and was expecting to see some steep pricing, but when opening the menu I found what I would consider some pretty reasonably priced offerings. Sure, there are a couple of burgers that are priced to the point one may consider taking out a home equity line to eat here, but that is the exception.\n\nWe walked in just after six and were immediately seated in the main bar area. Drink orders were taken and within a few minutes and I had a tequila gimlet sitting right in front of me. Alexandra had glass of pinot  which she never really took a liking to, my wife went with a Junipero martini which looked pretty refreshing and Alexandra's boyfriend had some fancy micro brew beer. \n\nAfter a few minutes of browsing the menu we were finally ready to order. Three of us went with the Country Natural which is farm raised beef, my wife however decided to try something a little different and boldly ordered the buffalo burger. We also requested a side of aioli for fry dipping. Speaking of fries, we obviously did not forget out about our little French friends and ordered both skinny and fat fries.\n\nWhen our burgers arrived I was very impressed by the size. A nice thick perfectly cooked (rare for me) meat patty carefully placed on a toasted bun. My burger came topped with caramelized onions and cheddar cheese. The toppings were sparse, but I had no problem with this as is how Hubert Keller intended. He wants the burger to speak for itself which it did. Pure tasting goodness within each bite is your reward. It was quite obvious that Burger Bar uses only top quality beef and they know how to cook it up. \n\nThe atmosphere is much more casual than I expected and all kinds of dress is perfectly acceptable here. The service is very good and attentive. The front bar area seems a little more lively than the seating in the rear of the restaurant and would prefer sitting there. There are also plenty of TV sets for those wanting to watch and keep track of your favorite team (gooooooo anyone but the Lakers!). The only sad part of the evening is we were one Popchip Angel down and she was missed. But on the bright side we get to see her next week! \n\nIn my opinion both Absinthe and Bix still makes the best damn burger in San Francisco but, overral I would say that Burger Bar is the Cats Pajamas and would definitely make a return visit.", "author": "Rene C."}

The hubby does say that it's painful process once the spicy burger is fully consumed, so don't plan on eating it on a heavy touring day, or right before hitting the ballpark.

Are the other Yelpers tasting the same burgers and fries I've eaten on my two visits?\n\nYes, I see a few areas where Burger Bar could improve, and I've only been during lunch on weekdays, but still, I'm not sure if I've ever had a better burger anywhere. And that's what it's about for me. Okay, let's get down to burgers and fries.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n* Black Jack Burger - Black Angus beef, Monterey jack, tapenade, tomato, lettuce on a ciabatta bun. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw&select=9lco7HVv7ZwPDLD7vIlrAQ\n\n* Chef's Veggie Burger - Caramelized onions, button mushrooms, lentils, green peas, brown & white rice, pumpkin puree, potato, bread curmbs, and mozzarella cheese on a whole wheat bun.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=cDB_VJfIIn8mM-qTk7MxTw\n\n* Sweet Potato Fries\n\n* Chocolate Burger - Donut, chocolate ganache, passion fruit, and strawberries http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw&select=wQFrfROysPEt0L9_gL-U5Q\n\nThe Black Jack Burger was juicy and satisfying. I didn't add ketchup (very unusual for me) because there was so much flavor already. It was so big that I felt I'd have to unhinge my jaw to bite into it. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw&select=H0BoiL3qyRN6fIQxnO3lpQ\n\nThe Veggie Burger was excellent, perhaps the best veggie burger I've ever had. The veggie patty had a lot going on and in a good way. I was extremely full and satisfied. One thing that also stood out to me was the bun. The bun can make or break a burger and this was super fresh from the Italian French Baking Company and enhanced the burger. Vegetarians are not left out here. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were simple and perfect. Probably the most delicious I've had anywhere. \"Nuf said.\n\nThe chocolate burger was cute and gimmicky. The bun was a donut from another bakery, and though it made a nice looking hamburger bun, it wasn't a great donut (I know my donuts - I even have a donut list). The chocolate patty was just so-so for me (yes, I've got a chocolate list too and I'm picky about chocolate). So the dessert was a 5 for cuteness and creativity, but only a 3 for taste. I liked the tangy passion fruit coulis (faux ketchup) and the gelatin cheese slice - those were well done. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw&select=RavFgtF7jd3Zy3KnBBH_HQ The strawberries (\"tomato\") and kiwi (\"lettuce\") were good too. The rest of the dessert taste-wise wasn't as high quality as the main course fare for me.\n\nWhat's right about Burger Bar:\n\n+ Excellent burgers and fries (haven't tried shakes yet!)\n+ They grind their own fresh meat 2x/day\n+ Many natural and specialty meats available\n+ Plenty of non-beef options for vegans, vegetarians, & pescetarians\n+ Very clean\n+ Attentive service\n+ Great views overlooking Union Square\n+ Some booths with TVs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=wEh92OkZn6L4XyD921pGhQ\n+ Hubert Keller sightings (I met him yesterday and he was very nice)\n\nWhat I see as justifiable complaints:\n\n- Music is loud and annoying (even on their website - ack!)\n- Could be kid-friendlier (they could provide crayons and paper, etc.)\n- It is expensive\n\n5 stars for fantastic burgers and killer sweet potato fries.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The alcoholic milkshakes are yummy but not very strong but you can nicely ask your waiter or bartender to give it a stronger kick. The dessert burger is absolutely phenomenal though. It looks just like a burger but instead comes with a slice of chocolate ganache, fresh strawberries, passion fruit all between a sugared donut.

It didn't. Instead, it came in a tiny pitcher. Cute, but not ideal for anything except, well, being cute. I ended up pouring it onto my bun and letting it soak in a bit. It was delicious, but there has to be a less messy way to enjoy it. Maybe a splosh of cream to thickened it? I could be wrong, but I doubt they get a lot of vegans.\n\nThe beer float I had with my burger was good (the one with stout and coffee ice cream), but I wanted a slightly higher beer to ice cream ratio. The beer was gone far too quickly. Another quibble, my friend's veggie burger tasted kind of bland and the texture was dry and crumbly. Add some cheese for a better eating experience.\n\nThe beer selection is almost overwhelming, but it's really cool that there is the option to create almost endless samplers. The ambience is decent (shiny, pretty big screens oh my!) and is probably amazing when the shades are opened to reveal the gorgeous skyline. The service was typical (great to start and nonexistent when it was time to pay and go). \n\nI have to admit, I hold celebrity chef's restaurants to a higher standard than a chain or independent joint. I adore Hubert Keller, so I was hoping for amazing. Instead, I got ok. Regardless,  I will go to Burger Bar again.", "author": "Nicole M."}

After my yearly trip to Moscone Center for the Annual Auto Show, my beau and I decided it was time for burgers, beer and most of all - frites!  \n\nNot much a wait - enough time for beer and scotch at the bar before we were seated.  I inhaled the Hubert Keller Burger with sweet potato fries and it was heaven in my mouth.  The buffalo was cooked to perfection - nice and juicy.  The scrumptious bleu cheese melted so that it slowly dripped over the burger and into the nooks and crannies of the ciabatta role that it was served on and the spinach was such a nice, new touch on a burger... it was a nice change from boring old iceberg.\n\nSo, yes - the food was awesome... def one of the best non-traditional burgers I have scarfed down, but that wasn't the highlight.  If you remember, I mentioned my chef crush on Mr. Hubert... well, whilst sitting with my beau, savagely devouring my massive mountain of buffalo, Chef Keller causally walks by.  Not wanting to be \"that girl\", I just swallow my tongue and start heating up from the inside out.  My beau, being very well aware of my admiration notices that woman A) from around the corner asks for a picture.  Seeing how amazingly gracious he is to woman A), my beau speaks up and asks Chef Keller if he would take a photo with me, as well since I am such a huge fan.  Beet red and full of anticipation, I spend one minute stuttering my words like a fool, and one second smiling for the camera.  \n\nThank you Chef Hubert Keller for the picture, the sincere kindness and the buffalo.  ;)", "author": "Kris I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-11", "description": "B/c most people just want to know the general idea/impressions of a restaurant review, I'm going to try something new and begin with my short, generalized conclusion statements, and finish with the details of a long review for those who appreciate the small stuff.\n\nGeneral Impressions:\n\n1. Was it the best burger i've ever had? No.\n2. Was it a good burger? Sure.\n3. Is the price/potential wait worth this good, but not perfect burger? No.\n\nFor those who are satisfied with my quick statements, ciao and thanks for visiting my review! For those who crave the whys and whats, here are the details entailed in the style of my usual reviews:\n\nI came in to Burger Bar at SF with mild expectations. I say mild because I have heard through word-of-mouth that this burger joint has long lines, overpriced food, and food that is \"eh.\" Nonetheless, on a beautiful day in SF where I couldn't think of where to eat in Union Square for an early dinner (5pm), my gf and I decided to try Burger Bar, considering we don't have to fight a crowd at the this early bird time. \n\nFood:\n\nEntree(s): note about their entrees - most of the regular burgers (black angus, kobe, etc) do not come with fries. They must be ordered on the side. However, certain \"signature chef burgers,\" such as the Hubert Keller Burger, Rossini Burger, etc. come with fries. All burgers, however, come with the basics: lettuce, tomatoes, pickle. You also have a choice of buns, including plain, sesame, onion, ciabatta, sourdough, and wholewheat. \n\nAmerican Kobe Beef Burger: I decided to forego the fancy ingredient burgers and get the simple Kobe Beef burger so I can get a true, uninterrupted sampling of Chef  Keller's creations. I opted for the ciabatta bun and added avocado and an order of zucchini fries on the side. \n\nBurgers at upscale establishments such as this tend to shape their meat patties in a similar fashion: a smaller in circumference, but thicker patty. My American Kobe was just like that. Cooked exactly as I wanted it (medium well). I decided to skip the condiments to first get a real taste of the burger. I must say i was not that impressed with the flavor. The patty, though cooked perfectly, could not differentiate itself from  the flavor of any other meat patty i've had in the past, from backyard bbqs to other restaurants. I suppose the only difference I could taste was that the meat was moist and not dry. Given that, flavor was lacking and preferred the patty to be more seasoned. Could I tell it was Kobe? No.\n\nMy gf opted to treat herself to one of Hubert's more extravagant creations: Surf & Turf Burger. Black angus beef, grilled half lobster, asparagus, on a plain bun. Sounds to die for right? I almost wanted to get it myself but thought the combination of flavors would make it hard for me to appreciate just the meat patty. Fortunately for myself, I still got a hearty sampling of my gf's burger.\n\nTo my utter surprise, there was the same lack of flavor in the Surf/Turf burger. The lobster, though cooked perfectly (moist, but not undercooked) was also unseasoned. The black angus beef and lobster combination did not really blend for me. There was two separate ingredients put into a burger, but the combination just didn't add up. Same story: cooked well, but not flavorful enough. \n\nService:\n\nHard to review as it was a casual dining experience, but I can say our waitress did what was expected of her, gave us our food promptly, refilled our drinks, and was polite and friendly. No complaints. I also wanted to note that this establishment is notorious for the wait on a normal night and that I cannot attest to that since, as mentioned earlier, I came here at a very early time (5pm). \n\nOverall, unimpressed. Good food, but not great. Not worth the bill (our check was around 75 total for two people). I guess it was an experience to try, but I wish the flavor was there. I came away physically full, but my taste buds were still hungry and begging for something more satisfying.", "author": "Nathan T."}

I have had the Kobe burger at Burger Bar at my first visit, and it was pretty darn good.

It isn't over the top fancy, very simple, but there isn't really much you can do to mess up a salad.  The chicken was great, small pieces so I didn't have to waste energy cutting it (lazy, I know).  Lots of egg, cheese, tomatoes and bacon.  Just the right amount of dressing.  The skinny fries are great.  Cooked just right, and come with a ranch dip if you are so inclined.  My dining companion had the Kobe burger with bacon and said it was \"off the hook\" good, along with the fat fries (more like steak fries - big and thick if you are into big and thick things).

This is THAT review.\nThe food is fine.  Great, even, for a high-end burger place.  I've been here several times and to the one in Vegas even more often.  The milkshakes are especially good (if on the small side) and it's nice to have a variety of meats, buns and toppings to choose from.\nThe meal service on our most recent trip was just okay.  Nothing to write home about.\nThe challenge for me and my party was the fact that we left after Macy's had closed, so the gate leaving the restaurant was down.  There was a line at the (only) elevator where we waited about 15 minutes.  The elevator never came to the floor (and yes, the button had been pushed).  We then said, \"Hey, it's only six floors, we'll take the stairs and walk off this larger burger we just had.\"  No go; the stairwell door was alarmed.  We asked the host and hostess who said the elevator was the only exit.  I inquired as to the stairway and the hostess said there wasn't one.  (!)  I asked about the exit sign by the stairway and she said, \"That doesn't go anywhere.\"  \nAt this point, I was becoming slightly claustrophobic and more than slightly annoyed.  I then asked about what would happen if there was a fire or other emergency and the hostess, and employee of this establishment said, and I quote, \"You could always go out the window.\"  Seriously?  From the sixth floor?  (By the way, still no elevator had arrived)\nI asked for the manager and explained the situation and the \"solution\" of the hostess to a fire emergency, and the manager laughed off the story like it didn't happen.  (For those keeping score, the elevator arrived at this point going UP and didn't have any room for any of the now 27 people waiting to leave).\nMy group was now searching for other ways out of the restaurant (the kitchen, the other side of the dining room) and seriously considering going through the alarmed stairwell (which the hostess still denied existed).\nLong story short (too late!) Macy's DID finally assign a security agent to serve as an elevator attendant and got everyone down (while still taking people up to Cheesecake Factory on the 8th floor (which for the record has two elevators, one of which is express).\nEat here if you must, but plan on leaving before Macy's closes.\n[I also harbor no illusions that management will respond to this review or even read it.

Of course, it was obvious that this restaurant was going to be more casual, hence the name Burger Bar.  It is located on the 6th floor of the Macy's building, which we thought was a bit funny.  The elevators on the left side lead to Burger Bar and the right side elevators lead to Cheesecake Factory.  We got seats along the windows which I totally loved.  The view of Union Square was beautiful, especially how I can people watch also.  We were welcomed with glasses of water and our menus with many recommendations since it was our first time there.  Our waitress was very nice and tried to explain the types of meat and what she had tried already in the past.    \n\nWhat we got:\n1. Burger Sliders- comes with a side of fries ( which was barely ).  Standard, nothing for me to make my significant other try them out.  It comes 3 different types of meat, which includes the buffalo meat.  $13\n\n2. Black Angus Beef Burger- with wheat bun.  A bit dry for a medium flavored cooking and not as flavorful as can be.  Does not come with side of fries. $10\n\nOverall, I don't think I will come back here if I were to crave for a Gourmet Burger.  For those of you that don't know about The Counter, Definitely go try their gourmet burgers there.  TEN TIMES better and a tad cheaper. AND their SWEET POTATO FRIES are TEN TIMES to die for there compared to Burger Bar.  Everytime I have gone to the Counter, I come out of there completely and beyond satisfied unlike Burger Bar.  This place is just average to me, nothing that would draw me to come back.  I mean it makes me curious to see how a Burger can cost $60 here.  If you let me taste it for free, I would come.  I think Hubbert Keller, from what I know and heard, should just stick to his specialty of Fine dining.    \n\nSide Note:  After a couple of hours later, I am still suffering from an upset stomach.

I am sure that the tables around us weren't too excited seeing the 11 of us waltz in but we had a good time and were relatively well behaved.  \n\nMy turkey burger was one of the best I have ever had.  It was so juicy and flavorful.  I think I could have eaten it plain and enjoyed it just as much as I did with it piled high with avocado and peppered jack.  The sweet potato fries were also delicious.  \n\nOur waitress didn't seem very happy to be there or very interested in serving us.  We ended up ordering our drinks and entrees at the same time since we had been there quite a while before she even came over the first time.

I ordered the buffalo burger for $16.50 + added toppings for additional costs. I had avocado, sprouts, carmelized onions, and asparagus. The burger ended up to be over $20. I think it is a rip off with the charging of additional toppings. My burger was extremely tall, so I had to use a fork and knife. The buffalo tasted like beef. I couldn't tell the difference between buffalo and beef. The sweet potato fries and deep fried zucchini were okay. They were mostly soggy. Also tried the hummus appetizer. The dish comes with a bowl of hummus with 4 pieces of pita bread. Yeah, I don't think four pieces of pita is enough. Someone needs to rethink the math on that dish.\n\nService was pretty bad. The chef forgot the sprouts and avocado on the burger. Other co-workers got stuff missing from their burgers. In addition, we wanted more pita bread, but we ended up getting another order of the pita appetizer. In addition, it seemed like a really long time to wait for the food.\n\nThe meat patties are better at \"Burger Bar.\" However, I can easily go to \"The Counter\" where there isn't an additional charge for toppings and the burger is just as good.", "author": "Jackie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-16", "description": "Oh Hubert, you're a victim of your own success. Because we're used to such amazingly high standards from Fleur de Lys, we have equal expectations when dining at any of your other restaurants, including a place which at the basic premise is nothing more than a fancy McDonald's. I realize that's not a completely fair assessment, but let's be realistic, when you think of burgers fine dining is one of the last things that typically comes to mind. I could even accept the high-end burger concept, were it done to perfection, and felt like something grandiose rather than just a burger with some expensive topping(s) on it.\n\nWe initially came here hoping to see Hubert himself, after dining at FDL a few nights prior (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleur-de-lys-san-francisco#hrid:2qTi2qd_ur5A6JDSrHACmA) and being told he's spending almost all his time here now. We've been huge fans of his long before the Top Chef Masters show took him into a new level of chef stardom, and we mainly wanted to thank him for inspiring some fantastic dishes at home, as well as for the fabulous dinner at FDL, but no luck, he wasn't in Burger Bar that night either. This fact became quite evident once we actually received our burgers.\n\nWe decided to go with one of the premade selection, the peppercorn burger, which is coated with peppercorn and dijon mustard and comes with a side of peppercorn. This was ok, I think the judge of a burger place is how well they perform with their basic burger concepts rather than how much fancy stuff you can add on at exorbitant amounts. No offense to the Rossini burger here, which I'm sure is amazing, but if any place decided to put shaved truffles, foie gras, and a wine reduction sauce on top of their burger I can't imagine those flavors not being superior to the rest of the menu, which is why I don't use that as my yardstick. \n\nThe sliders were miniscule (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=_pypfetOujQo-zkiJl60EA), probably the smallest I've ever seen. I barely got much of a taste of any of the 3 different types, and as a result they all tasted pretty much the same. The fries here are also forgettable, another shock at a place with this pedigree.\n\nProbably the biggest upside for me about Burger Bar was the custom milkshake options, because you can get essentially anything you've ever wanted in a milkshake added in, at least in the way of unhealthy chocolate-based products. I decided to go all dark with a mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake with chunks of skor bar, hazelnut mousse and homemade chocolate whipped cream. The consistency was perfect, and all the ingredients harmonious, a truly great milkshake.\n\nThe beef float paddle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=jUMkja8RKqLkuci_WD6BXw) was much less impressive, providing a subpar offering of beer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjn-0kb7M6DQmaLsQIxO7Q?select=cWPFhwGF7wEas3Lgcmpk9A) with ice cream floats which could barely handle their opposing flavors. The only one I really like was the Lindemans and vanilla ice cream combo, mainly because if you add Framboise to just about anything it tastes great. Other than that the Beamish and the Eel River were both ok, but the others were entirely too sour.\n\nA final little annoying thing about Burger Bar, the bathrooms were just rancid when I went in. I'm talking like gas station bad, soaked in urine smell. If you're going to try to pull of fine dining with a burger spin, then I expect to be all of your restaurant to be fine dining, not just your menu.", "author": "Justin C."}

The fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings were all incredibly good.\n\nYou may be waiting there for quite some time as the lines can get long.

However, they reassured me that it wouldn't be a problem to get a seat for lunch on a Tuesday, and they weren't lying. We stepped off the elevator and were seated right away. I was surprised that the decor wasn't a bit more special...it kind of felt like a hip restaurant from the early 1990s. \n\nThe server was very nice, and helped me choose my fixings for my custom burger. I ended up going with mozzarella, which was the best decision I've made in a while. Who knew that this chewy gooey cheese would be so good on a burger? I also added chipotle aioli, in accordance with my aioli addiction, and got some sweet potato fries on the side. The burger was nice but probably not worth the price, and although it's hard for me not to love sweet potato fries, these were a bit dry and not that fresh. \n\nThe burger was good...burgers are good in general.

Service was good, Sylvia was good attentive. The place was not too busy and it's really a place for tourists. Very over-priced for a burger. As a native San Franciscan, I can tell you, there are a lot of better choices for a burger, like super-duper, Marlowe, Bullshead. This place nickle and dimes you for everything-fries don't come with the burger and by the time you add fries, cheese, bacon, or avocado, you are paying well over $25 +. Our first appetizer, the mild chicken wings, $15.20 and we switched for fried zucchini instead of fries, and up-sell and were not told about it up front when she offered the option, andI can tell the wings were good! But when we ordered a second order, one of our guests said the inside of the chicken wing, the chicken to the bone was cold. We had already talked to manager Travis about not having the gluten free fries available because their fryer was broken, that they somehow fixed after complaining, and that when ordering we asked for the sourdough bun and that was also not available. He said he was sorry, had some excuse and offered dessert, which at the time I said \"well thanks\". He compt one, because we only ordered one, and didn't even compt the chicken that had to re-done because it was cold, like it had come from the fridge and only the outside of the chicken wing had been cooked. Travis, the manger, never came back. You barely saw him working the floor and never came back to check on us since we were having a bad experience,.

Awesome view, I'll give them that but the rest of the meal was less than average.\n\nHere were the negatives and why I'm only giving this place 2 stars:\n1. I ordered my burger to be medium rare but 2 of the other people in our party ordered their burgers to be well done.  Unfortunately, my burger came well done NOT medium rare.  For a place whose name has \"Burger\" in it, I expect their burgers to be cooked 100% of what the customer orders.  The other person in our party ordered his burger medium and his also came out well done.  \n\n2. Service is less than exceptional.  Our waitress was friendly at taking our order but after that, we never saw her.  No \"Can I get you anything else\" check in which I found annoying because we wanted to ask about our burgers being over done.  I also wanted to ask about a sauce I ordered which I'm 99% sure was not the correct sauce they put on my plate.  Not a big deal and I went on ahead to eat it with my burger but worth-it to mention because I would have liked to ask the waitress yet she was nowhere to be found.    \n\n3. Overpriced.

I wonder can i just order the foie gras without the meat?  I'll still come back there and get my dranks and dessert. i love the view from this place.  This place can get packed during weekends, so it's best to come on a weekday after lunch hours.", "author": "Belinda C."}

I wasn't in NY at the time nor do I particularly care for the Yankees but it was still pretty cool to watch. I didn't miss out since I was sitting in Burger Bar and we had our own personal tv in our booth. The exclusive tv's are a neat feature of Burger Bar. You kind of feel like you are in a sports bar yet you still have plenty of privacy to enjoy a laid back dinner amongst friends and family. Burger Bar is a great alternative to Cheesecake Factory in Macy's. It's the same amount of fun without the long wait time. Just don't forget your wallet. The burgers are not cheap.\n\nI originally booked Burger Bar for a girls' night out but then one girl's hubby came along which was totally cool because Burger Bar is the perfect spot for both sexes. Burgers, beer, sports and shopping. Burger Bar is in a great location and the burger menu is endless.\n\nSome of our group built their own burgers. I went for the Hubert Keller burger. It was my first time eating buffalo. The buffalo meat was lean, full of flavor and juicy. It was topped with caramelized onions, spinach and bleu cheese. The Hubert Keller burger was an interesting combination in my opinion and it surprisingly worked very well. If I ever go back to Burger Bar, I'll get it again. The ciabatta held up nicely and my favorite was the side of skinny fries. The fries were held in a wire basket which looked like a miniature shopping cart. \n\nOur mama-to-be got a Nutella milkshake. It wasn't anything special but it did taste like Nutella when you drank from certain parts of the glass. In other words, it wasn't shaken up very well. For dessert we shared a chocolate burger. The concept was too cool to pass up. Too bad it didn't live up to it's expectations. Sure it looked amazing. But if dessert doesn't taste good, then really there's no point is there? If you looked quickly you would not have even known that what you were staring at was not a cheeseburger. This burger was really made out of a cold donut bun, strawberry tomatoes, mint leaf lettuce, passion fruit jelly cheese and a chocolate ganache patty. It tasted interesting. Really sugary and rich textures. It was a good idea for four people to share it. I couldn't imagine eating or wanting to finish a whole one by myself. It's really too much and not so appetizing for one person. \n\nI had a good time at Burger Bar. I somehow thought it was going to be cooler since my only recollection of it was from Vegas but it just ended up to be a casual spot with expensive, if you can even call it fancy, burgers.", "author": "Rachel A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-04", "description": "Ten weeks from its opening, Burger Bar is mostly still a bust.  There were significant conceptual and execution problems all around.  For one, they didn't cook our burgers to order.  It's understandably difficult to cook with grass fed beef because it dries out so quickly, but that's life, and they need to nail it if they're going to specialize in burgers.  We sent all three of our burgers back because they were either missing toppings or had been overcooked.\n\nWe also struggled with the buns.  As others have noted, the buns are far too big and bready for the burger.  It's carbo hell.  Worse, two of our three sets of buns were stale, and I can't really imagine the excuse there.  (For comparison's sake on all of these points, I had the Luke Burger at John Besh's restaurant in New Orleans, and it's simply stellar across the board -- none of the problems described here.)\n\nMy last nit goes to the veggie burger, which is a mushy mess of carbs.  Pair it with the buns mentioned above, and you've got yourself a dish that just shouldn't have made it to the menu in the first place.\n\nIt's still worth calling out what worked: the meat is tasty (when cooked properly), the sweet potato fries were nice, and the milkshake that the manager comped us was delicious.  I appreciate that the manager solicited our feedback, and while I'm sure he didn't enjoy hearing what we had to say, he was an absolute professional about it.  I hope he's able to improve the experience here. \n\nIf the goal is to compete with the Cheesecake Factory for the tourist crowd, then Burger Bar is a huge success.  That may very well explain why the Burger Bar is doing such brisk business.  I'm curious, however, what this all says about Mr. Keller.  It certainly makes me think twice about going to Fleur de Lys again anytime soon.", "author": "Laurence W."}

It doesn't hurt that Hubert Keller was cruising around from table to table making sure everyone was happy. \n\nFast forward to 2014 and you have the reason for only two stars. We had a reservation and arrived about 10 minutes early. We were told that our table would be ready right on time for our 7:30 reservation and we were all happy to wait. After being seated in a large booth, that is where it all went downhill. After waiting 20 minutes, we were first acknowledged by a server that apparently wasn't ours. He brought our waters and took our drink orders. After another 10 minutes the alcohol came to the table but no soda for my pregnant friend. We had to ask two more times for the soda to come. Once we finally placed our burger orders (a burger that I had been dreaming about since 2009), my medium burger came out with zero pink in it. This was the case for everyone at the table.... No pink in a medium rare burger??? C'monnnnn. We were all too fed up at that point to fathom sending the burger back in fear that we would never see it againAlso to make matters worse, when the food runner delivered our burgers, we had no silverware for condiments. I ended up spreading the cranberry sauce on my burger with my finger with zero shame before the silverware arrived 5 minutes later. \n\nAll in all, if I could recreate my 2009 burger bar experience, I would happy return, but at this point, my next trip to San Francisco will certainly not include this restaurant.", "author": "Alison C."}

OVER HYPED & NOT WORTH THE WAIT!\n\nDespite Mr. Keller being at the restaurant there that night, service was horrible. We should have known the moment we found out that they gave our table away. We were a party of 10 and had been waiting for 1.5 hours. Cheesecake Factory was the original plan but the estimated time was 3 hours there.\n\nFlag #1: We were seated and they brought waters for 7/9 people. We ordered our food and asked for water, but it never came.\n\n#2: Food came out and we were missing 2 burgers and a side of fries. We thought they were going to bring it out. No one noticed for about 5-10 mins and we had to flag down multiple people to inquire about it. They kept saying, \"It's coming out.\" Then one guy goes, \"It's coming right out.....By the way, what did you order???\" You mean bullshit is coming right out?\n\n#3: They brought out one burger that was missing and we were wondering why he was scraping off the mushrooms. He said I didn't order that (btw, he's 10 years old). He ordered the plain basic burger, but they brought out a kobe burger with mushrooms. Since he was hungry, he ate it anyways.\n\n#4: About 25 mins after the manager got involved with our missing burgers, the chicken burger finally came out and the rest of the party was already done eating by then. They did not even comp this burger even though we had to ask 10 times about it before they took action. Also, the server said the chef would bring it out himself. We were kind of excited and got our cameras out, but that never happened even though we saw him walking around the restaurant. We noticed everyone started avoiding our table after that burger fiasco, especially the managers. They would avoid eye contact or turn around before they reached our section.\n\n#5: When the bill came, they charged us for the kobe burger even though we had ordered the plain burger, but was given the kobe. It was a $7 difference so we asked the server about it. He implied that since he ate the kobe burger that we should pay for it. Seriously? We have to pay for your mistake?? Then after realizing that NO we weren't doing that, he reluctantly got it taken care of. Needless to say, we didn't leave a good tip.\n\n#6: Bad Customer Service. My friends and I have been in the hospitality industry for years, so we understand issues/problems that come up, but the way they handled everything was appalling. They weren't sorry for making the mistake and even tried to make it sound like it was our fault. They could have simply comped the 2 burgers that came extremely late. ANY other restaurant would have done something for their mistake like comping the meal or providing a free dessert. How everyone handled the situation, including the managers, server, busboy, runners, was to \"cover their ass.\"\n\nFOOD:\n- Grilled Shrimp Salad: over drenched with dressing, shrimps & grilled vegges were okay\n- Kobe Beef Burger: nothing special, served with basic tomato, onion, lettuce side, bread good texture\n- Onion Rings: taste like any other place\n- Sweet Potato Fries: good, but a little surprised this gourmet restaurant didn't serve any type of aioli sauce to accompany the fries\n\nFrankly, I think the server messed up and simply forgot to put in the order for the last 2 burgers. He was busy with 2 large parties and had a few other tables. That's a lot of people to handle for one server. Either have a seasoned server or don't be short staffed like that on a busy Saturday night.\n\nEveryone knew about our table and how we were upset. We complained to the manager (Edward) again after paying for our meal. He was nice enough to listen but they didn't do much to make us want to come back. He simply said we could write to the GM on this card. It was a basic restaurant card with no email address and no name.\n\nYeah, Burger Bar is located in a prime location where the amount of tourists alone that visit will pay for the rent, but good luck surviving when it's off season. Also, it's logistically a nightmare to get in & out of the place, especially when Macy's closes. They only have ONE ELEVATOR. Be prepared to wait and panic if there's a fire or earthquake. The only good thing is they have a very extensive beer list and you can watch the game. The bartenders are efficient. \n\nI would rather wait 3 hours at Cheesecake Factory.

Burger Bar is a gourmet burger joint with higher-then-average burger prices- And i think this place rocks!\n\nYes- the average burger here will run you between $16-$22, although they do have $9-$11 options. Since this was my first time trying Burger Bar(and i wanted to give Yelpers my best assessment), I decided to go all out and get \"Hubert's Favorite Choice\" as advertised in their menu; the Hubert Keller Burger. Hubert Keller is the head chef and creator of Burger Bar, so if this is his favorite burger it had to be good!\n\nFolks, this burger was much better then good! It was outstanding! I understand for $22 I could have purchased a hell of alot more double cheeseburgers from McDonalds- But I could sincerely taste a difference and believe this burger is WELL WORTH IT! The juiciness of the burger was just awesome! The caramelized onions were just falling out of the ciabatta buns! The blue cheese was so pungent, yet so delicious. The Hubert Keller burger was so flavorful- it was down right amazing.\n\nMy Girlfriend purchased a Buffalo Burger- which tasted great as well! I had a few bites, each seemingly more tender than the last. You can really taste the difference between the Angus beef and the Buffalo beef.\n\nOn top of this- they serve really unique milkshakes such as Nutella and Twinkie flavors. Plus, they have a really huge selection of beer and wine. My jaw dropped when i saw their beer list! I ended up picking some random pilsener from Germany I'd never heard of- that's always fun lol.\n\nI really do plan on coming back to Burger Bar soon. I might not drop $20 on a burger again since i'm sure the quality of their lower priced burger is just as great!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-03", "description": "Being an avid Top Chef Fan, I was so excited to go to Burger Bar after hearing they serve Kobe beef and foie gras. After seeing mixed reviews on YELP, I wanted to wait a bit hoping they would iron out their wrinkles. After several weeks later, I just couldn't wait...was it worth the wait? ABOSULTELY NOT! I have to say I AGREE with all the negative reviews regarding Burger Bar's food quality, pricing, and service. \n\nMy friend and I came here on a Monday night around 6:10 p.m. We waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated. Upon walking to our booth, I was shockingly surprised about how mundane the d\u00e9cor was. More on d\u00e9cor later.\n\nFOOD:\n*Kobe Burger w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese on an Onion Bun: The Kobe was very meh. I have had Kobe several times before and I have to say I agree with all the other YELPERS who say it tasted exactly like ground beef. The Kobe wasn't seasoned properly and therefore lacked flavor. I requested the Kobe be cooked MEDIUM, but it was WELL-DONE. \n\nOk, while the Foie Gras and Kobe sounds like a good combo in theory; it didn't pair well together. Because the patty was substantially larger as compared to the foie gras; it got lost in the patty. The only thing it did to the burger was add a salty oily flavor to it. \n\n*Skinny Fries w/ Chili Aioli Sauce: The fries were ok; I would say something to comparable to McD's fries minus the salt. They would have probably tasted better if they were hot versus lukewarm. There was NO kick or heat in the chili aioli sauce. It looked and tasted like colored mayo.\n\n*Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Nutella and homemade whip cream: They claim their ice cream to be homemade? I'm guessing that's why it took 33 minutes to get our ice cream! The ice cream was just average; there was nothing that really stood out about it. \n\nPRICING: Build your burger concept...pick your patty which ranges in prices. Then if you want to add cheese, grilled onions, veggies, condiments (i.e. Dijon mustard), etc, there's a separate charge. \n\nMy Kobe w/ Foie Gras and Swiss Cheese came out to be about $30. Fries were an additional $3.35. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was nice; however, once we first seated, she was anxious to get our orders. And, after we received our food, she was no where to be found. It took about 25-30 minutes to get our burgers. After eating out burgers, we decided to order dessert. After 20 minutes of waiting for our ice cream, we flagged down the waitress to cancel our order. She said they were running behind schedule, and that they were preparing it right now. Another 10 minutes passes, and nothing. We asked again to cancel the order and to just get the bill. She apologized and said the Manager will comp the ice cream and they were making it now. After waiting a total of 33 minutes, we finally got it. Unless you're churning the ice cream as we speak, it should NOT take that long to scoop ice cream and pour some nutella sauce on it. \n\nD\u00c9COR/AMBIANCE: Ummm, if you're going to serve burgers ranging from $15-$60, you better have a decor that's more extravagant than the typical Sports Bar and Grill which pretty much sums it up. Cheesecake's d\u00e9cor puts Burger Bar's d\u00e9cor to shame. Sad...And, what is up with the TVs in the booths? It was very distracting especially when trying to hold a conversation. So yah, fellas, not a good date place. \n\nCROWD: Tourists, tourists, and more tourists. I guess they should be thankful that they're located in a prime location. \n\nWe were able to see Chef Hubert Keller walking around the restaurant, hence the 2 stars. Would have been a nice touch if he made an effort to reach out to the patrons...\n\nTo sum it all up, I was disappointed with my experience at Burger Bar and highly doubt I would return, nor would I recommend it to anyone. There's far better places to get a burger that's more reasonable (e.g. Bullshead, Barney's, etc). I know Burger Bar is no Fleur De Lys, but if it's any indication of how it may be; I rather go broke and trek to French Laundry.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I was not about to ask the guy to go through the large list of beers each time but had no problems asking him for the menu then passing it back to him every time I needed a new beer.  It was an inconvenience he would have to deal with.  Wasn't sure what the big deal was with letting me keep a menu to browse but whatever. \n\nI had ordered a customized burger that was delicious.  The burger consisted of Kobe Beef, an egg, chipotle sauce, and pickles.  Haha, I am a very simple guy. The burger didn't come with fries but I was able to have some from the others in the group. \n\nThe place looked a little run down.

A ton of options including meat, toppings, sauces, cheese and bread are plentiful.  They also have specialty milkshakes as well as build-your-own milkshakes, which is nice because you can customize something to your liking with ice cream flavors, mix-ins and toppings.  The sides (fries and onion rings) are also great.\n\nMany have complained that the biggest problem is the flavoring of the burger and I really do have to agree:  the burger lacks flavor.  I can tell that the quality of meat is incredible and very tasty, but the fact that the meat itself is under seasoned causes a lack in the burger experience.  Everything else is great - the buttered toasted bread, the fresh vegetable and special toppings, even the sauces are great, but the fact that the burger lacks seasonings (really just a bit of salt and a hint of pepper) leaves one a bit unsatisfied.  When a customer is being asked to pay $10 or more for a burger and the burger is from a world-renowned chef, it should be close to perfect and it wasn't quite there.  Honestly, the remedy is simple - add a bit more salt and a bit of pepper and the burgers will be fantastic.\n\nRestaurant - 4 stars\nService - 4.5 stars\nBurger - 3 stars\nFries/Onion Rings - 4.5 stars\nMilkshakes - 5 stars\n\nOVERALL: 4 stars", "author": "Ken G."}

I watch his PBS show religiously and had resisted ever watching Top Chef until I heard about the \"Masters\" version he was going to be in.  When I first moved out here, Fleur De Lys was all the rage and after years now, Hubert Keller's brand is as strong as ever if not more so. Going on opening day knowing things are going to be crazy is a good way to set your expectations. Chef TV exposure? Grand Opening? The middle of touristville? Check, Check and Check. Even though it was really late on the first day, we still had a significant wait. \n\nBack when the Vegas one opened I had been very tempted to try the Rossini burger. Should I do it now? $60 is an awful lot and on opening day it's a risky proposition. So I decided for the peppercorn burger with some additions. Lo and behold the waiter said he couldn't do that. I guess some of the signature burgers have their own mise en place and you really mess with the line cooks if you add stuff. Ok, no big deal. So I went with a kobe buger, pepper bacon, pepper jack cheese, Fleur De Lys peppercorn sauce and then a half lobster for good measure. Damn that thing was yummy even though they went slightly over on my medium rare. Not enough blood (hmm that didn't sound right). Decent sweet potato fries and ok pickled jalapenos. The drinks were solid and the service was definitely on the tattered side as the tourist patron crush was non stop. \n\nTowards midnight Chef Keller popped in all dressed up (more like DJ Hubert Keller) and made his way directly to us and chatted  for a bit. We talked about the stress of opening something brand new and how things weren't going to calm down till about 1:30am for him. It's good to see that he values his customers experience and proceeded to say hi to a number of tables in the main room. \n\nI'd say if you really want to try this place and haven't already, wait. Let things get a but less hectic or eat late as they plan to hold 2am hours (thats awesome). Also keep in mind to the fact that the fame of the owner, the area it's and what they're striving for image wise, you're going to be paying a premium.

The caramelized onions were not as dark as I was expecting, but also really good. The cheese was almost non-existant. I could see it, but couldn't taste it. I put very few jalape\u00f1os on my burger, as they were potent. They were NOT chopped, they were sliced which was disappointing. With something that hot, you don't need a bunch, but you also don't want to have to chop them yourself table side. The side of jalape\u00f1os was huge, something you could easily share with someone else. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were tasty, but obviously frozen as they seemed a little emaciated. \n\nThe sodas are a jaw dropping $3.50, but they're not stingy on free refills. I guess they have to make their rent somewhere (fountain drinks run about $.02 actual cost). I ordered a diet Coke and they brought me a diet Pepsi with no warning.

There are other things on the menu, appetizers, other sandwiches, full bar - but Burgers reign supreme here! In addition to the lineup of burgers listed on the menu, there is a rather extensive toppings list - you can then customize your own burger - which is why I did.\n\nWe ordered a number of appetizers to share: Deep fried spicy dill pickles, fried Zucchini, and Onion rings. All were crisp and tasty - I'd never had a fried dill pickle before - wasn't bad - but I still prefer crisp, cold, dill pickles!\n\nI ordered a custom Bison burger: Buffalo meat, with pepperjack cheese, jalapeno bacon, and Chipotle Aioli - with lettuce, tomato, and onion, on a wheat bun - cooked medium well. Ordered the burger with Sweet Potato fries. Plus I had a couple of beers - neither of which I had before - nor can I remember their names - both were good though!\n\nWhen the burger arrived, I spread the Chipotle Aioli on the top wheat bun, slapped on the lettuce, tomato, onion, and took a big bite. Very tasty - BUT the Burger was cooked Medium Rare/Medium.

I waited to review the Burger Bar for service and food.  I've tried the Angus Burger and the Buffalo burger.  I thought the buffalo burger was dry due to the meat being lean and not much fat to be juicy.  When I went to San Francisco I tried the Angus Burger and the result was even worst.  the meat was dry and overcook that it was flaky.  The bf had the surf and turf in Vegas and then the Angus burger in San Fran and according to him same result.  The meat was dry and hard to eat.  \n\nWe both love the french fries, it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The onion rings had a thin batter and you can taste the onions.  The choices for the beers on tap and the bottles were extensive and so many choices.  \n\nI wish the food was better.  I love Hubert Keller and Fleur de Lys.  The Burger Bar was a disappointment.

Well, I met the woman, and I have a theory: She is in fact not a woman, but an apparition sent to observe the lives of mortals, not to intervene in our trivial affairs. Either that or she just didn't fuck!\n\nA lot of waiters try their best if for no other reason than getting a good tip. I could only assume that our waiter was in fact an eccentric millionaire on sabbatical, moonlighting as a waiter in an effort to get closer to the common man, because he sure wasn't concerned about getting a good tip. We saw the guy like once every half-hour, and you pretty much had to jump in front of him to get him to stop. I think he was a little shocked we expected to get food.\n\nThe beer list, at least for me, was the shining light of my dining experience. It's about as extensive a list as I've seen, with beers for all seasons and all reasons. Some are on the pricier side; lets not lie, pretty much all more expensive than happy hour prices you can find around town. My friend and I counted at least three different beers at $38, so it is what it is. You can still find some brew at $5 a pint.\n\nIf the expensive beer wasn't enough, my friend bought a $12 burger and was charged $15 for it. We didn't feel like fighting it, we were in the moment. The place has ambiance, if nothing else. Celebrity chef, Hubert Keller, was even on deck mingling with customers, serving and things of that nature. He was a better host than the one we got.  \n\nWhen it comes to drinking I've got the stamina of a rhino, and the work ethic of a turkey-buzzard; needless to I enjoyed the drinking at this place. It really is a great place to do some boozing, plus the burgers are pretty good, though I really don't think they're worth their asking price.\n\nWhen my other friend arrived, wanting to join in on the experience me and my other buddy were enjoying, he ordered the veggie burger. He was kind of shocked that when it arrived, it didn't really come with fries or anything. The waiter had neglected to mention that, which was odd seeing as how that was kind of important. Also, our burgers came with fries, why not that one? Of course making matters worse, as I mentioned before, we only saw out waiter every fortnight.\n\nDespite our incorporeal host, absentee waiter, and all around shitty service we still managed to scrape together a good time. I'll probably go back cause I like having to work for service, I guess. I just want the beer more than anything xD.", "author": "Shirrod R."}

I really do.\n\nI've been four times now (including a few days ago), and there's just no denying it.\n\nBurger Bar is, and given its location, will continue to be an overpriced restaurant that caters to tourists. It's just not a place for locals to go. Why pay tourist prices in one of the most tourist-saturated squares in the country, when there are a million other places you could go in SF?\n\nI'm willing to pay a little extra for fresh, quality ingredients, and rest assured, the quality of meat and produce at Burger Bar is really great (and essential for any \"gourmet burger\" joint). But I don't want to pay tourist prices, sorry.\n\nI usually get Country Natural on Ciabatta, with pepper jack cheese and pesto sauce (+ peppered bacon, if I'm in the mood). Burger sans fries is 13-15$. Not OK. Tax and tip with a fairly basic burger and reasonable sized order of fries (which were served very cold this time, and had to be brought a new order) is always 20$, bare minimum. Want to have the world's smallest (but admittedly very tasty) milkshake? That'll be $7.50, minimum. \n\nNot much else to say, as every time I try to talk about how good the food actually is, I am reminded that I'm kinda being taken advantage of.\n\nDo try Burger Bar out - the food is really good, but I can't come here more than once a year...which is exactly what I've done since it opened...", "author": "Conrad B."}

They had everything from your classic American, which runs for about $10, to the Rossini, a high end burger with Kobe beef, foie gras and truffles for $60. Honestly if you want to spend $60 for some ground sirloin you can have it - I'd rather have filet mignon at that price - but to each his own. \n\nWe had reservations (which I am glad they take unlike that other place across the way) for our large party, so it made things easier on us. I must say the waiter was very handsome too, which was a plus. But I digress...I ordered the sliders, which came with one kobe beef, one buffalo, and one angus beef slider. I couldn't tell which was which, which speaks of the quality of the angus, or the lack of quality of the others. They were smaller than most sliders I've had at other restaurants, and there was more bread than meat. The skinny fries that came with them were more to write home about - they were crispy, salted perfectly, and tasty. All this for $13 - not horrible but I can get meatier sliders elsewhere. I'm giving it 3 stars for the location, the fries and the service. We asked a staff person for a candle for cupcakes I made for my friend's birthday, and they obliged without hesitation. She was so surprised, and I'm glad they went along with it. I'm not giving it 4 stars because the burgers were just so-so, which is not a 4 in my book.", "author": "Laura G."}

We were all feeling burgers and since Burger Bar was known for their milkshakes, it seemed harmless to give it a shot. \n\nWe were greeted at the host stand around 9:30 and luckily the place was empty.

We sat at the bar seating close to the window and were promptly greeted by a very lovely server who's name I forgot. She probably the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 because everything else was definitely not up to par with any restaurant among the same level. She was patient, friendly but not pushy with recommendations and her timing was excellent.\n\nOur meal however, once ordered was sub par at best. My iced tea unfortunately wasn't brewed properly and someone didn't let it brew properly and add hot water to it. It was the first time that's ever happened to me and I was sort of embarrassed sending it back. 3 of us ordered burgers and no one got the right internal temperatures. Strike 1. There were hardly any alternatives for people who didn't eat burgers even though the name on the menu did say \"Burger Bar\" and that was a disappointment. Strike 2. Did I mention it cost $3.50-$5.00 for sides that aren't included with the $10-$16 burgers? So you could be paying about $20+ for a burger and fries here. Outrageous. For the price alone I'm gonna have to say Strike 3. \n\nThe burgers are petite and the buns are dry and accompanied by a spear pickle, a thin slice of red onion and a piece of romaine lettuce. Who wants a spear pickle with a hamburger? A spear pickle belongs on a hot dog if anything but at this point I was surprised they didn't charge you for that too. \n\nI was also surprised one of the youngest in the group also didn't get carded while we joked around about how he obviously looked 16.

I had waited for Burger Bar to open in San Francisco since it was first announced a year ago.  I am a HUGE fan of burgers... from McDonald's McDouble to the succulent juices of Balboa Cafe's burger and now Burger Bar's Kobe Beef Burger!  My history of burgers started because my Dad used to operate an American restaurant serving burgers, pasta, and sandwiches.  Ever since I was young I have been addicted to burgers so this place just was beckoning for me to try.  FYI: I was a proud fan of Burger Bar SF on Facebook stalking it until they opened today!\n\nWhat I ordered:\n-Kobe Beef Burger\n-Peppered Jack Cheese\n-Bacon\n-Caramelized Onions\n-Onion Bun\n\nThis burger was smoking hot when it came out! I touched the onion bun and felt a surge of joy rush through my arms.  I had the BIGGEST PERVERTED GRIN on my face as I picked up custom created burger.  My eyes moistened and grew the size of hamburgers themselves much like the ones you see in Japanese Manga/Anime.  I trickled my fingers over the bun to give the sensations of touch on my fingers and began the countdown.... 3... 2... 1... FACEPLANT right into the hamburger like a merciless Tazmanian devil ravaging through its prey.  The beef was so tender that I barely needed my teeth!  I was pretty sure I could have eaten the beef with my tongue... every turn of the burger showed the kobe beef crevices.  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for in a burger.  Boy did this place deliver a good burger!\n\nLiked:\n-Excellent burger. Best I have had in the Financial District!\n-Nice attentive staff. Our waitress (I think her name was Ashley) was very nice and came to check on us multiple times before and after our order.  She even told us that our burgers were coming out shortly while we were waiting for our meal.  Even when getting the check... when my eyes met hers she instantly came over to make sure everything was alright.\n-The view was rather splendid and the environment was very nice and amiable\n\nConstructive Feedback:\n-We did order our burgers medium rare, but it seems more medium to medium well. no biggy for me, but it did bother my coworker a tiny bit.\n-The wait time for the burger was not too bad although if you have a 30min-1hr lunch there is no way you can eat here and enjoy the full meal.  We rushed and ordered as quickly as we could.  Getting the waitress for both ordering/check was no problem, the food coming out was what took a bit longer.  We came @ 11am which is before the lunch rush and it was pretty empty so I would caution the 12pm crew to make some time and be prepared for a 1hr+ long lunch.\n\nConclusion:\nMuch thanks to Hubert Keller for bringing this place to San Francisco!

Keller does a great job of taking something as simple as a burger and transforming it into a high class meal. I had the buffalo burger, plain with no cheese. This was sort of a stretch for me because I generally do not order burgers, but you could taste the quality of the meat. I have to say the highlight of this particular lunch was the Butterscotch Milkshake I had. The glass was coated in caramel and filled with a coffee, butterscotch milkshake. It was topped off with whipped cream and a graham cracker. Next time, I'd probably just be happy with the milkshake! The reason for 4 stars is that it was REALLY crowded and the wait staff seemed really buys and a little pushy to get people out of tables.", "author": "Hayley H."}

Given that it was his birthday we decided to splurge and had the Rossini burger with black truffles and lobster.  It was AMAZING.  I would have never thought of the concept, it seemed when looking at the menu that they had just tried to think of the most expensive ingredients for a burger when in reality the flavors together were divine.  The lobster's salty flavors enhanced the meat and the black truffle pulled it all together in a savory yumminess.   I cannot attest to how their average burger or lunch is, but this \"special occasion\" burger was to die for.  One of the best burgers I have ever eaten. \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive.

The woman I went with is a \"cleanser\" and doesn't eat many things like nuts, dairy, gluten, meat, etc., so she got the SF Vegan and LOVED IT. She was over the moon. \n\nService Staff: Nice. Not exceptional, but no complaints. \n\nEnvironment: You'd expect it to be crowded on a Saturday at 7, especially on one of the Macy's deal days, and I suppose it was. The reason I'm not sure: this is a pretty big restaurant. I saw many people eating, but there was no line and we were seated almost immediately. The food came quickly (10-15 mins) and was quite good. TVs placed all over were playing Access Hollywood (Kanye might be cheating on a PREGNANT Kim!) and some nice music was playing at a reasonable volume.

OK, I can get over that if the food and service are good.\n\nOrdered a diet soda and the turkey burger. Something was wrong with their fountain as the soda tasted like the machine needed cleaning. Took one sip and then had to push it aside. The server either didn't notice or didn't care, probably didn't care. The turkey burger was very dry, which is very surprising since this is a Hubert Keller restaurant. I only ate half of the burger, again the server didn't notice or didn't care, probably didn't care.\n\nMy husband had knocked some of his fries on the floor (he picked them up), when the server came by he mentioned it and the response was \"that happens a lot around here\". Really? If it does happen a lot then maybe the serving vessel should be changed so you don't knock over the long handle. I thought a more proper response would have been \"would you like me to get you some more?\" at the high prices, that would have been appropriate. Although, again, our server didn't care.\n\nLater, she did ask my husband if he was done and cleared his plate, didn't ask me and never cleared my plate. \n\nOverall, poor to mediocre food, poor service and overpriced.

I didn't get the chance to try it on my last Vegas trip so I was excited to see that he opened one in San Francisco. I am a bit bias since I was rooting for him the whole time during his run on Top Chef Masters. However, even that favoritism cannot earn Burger Bar a good review due the very poor service and the extremely overpriced burgers. \n\nIt's hard to argue with the location of this Burger Bar. The 6th floor of Macy's downtown gives diners a wonderful view of Union Square. The view is great especially during the holidays because of the ice rink below. Knowing how busy this place can get, we called ahead and they held a table for a party of five even though their website says they only take reservations for parties of 13 or more. Once we got there, we were a little late and they had just called our table, but they accommodated us pretty quickly. The booth seating is both impressive and practical. There are coat hangers on the sides and the best part is the built in television set, which was set on the football game.\n\nAfter being quickly seated, this is when it all went downhill. Service was extremely slow and poor. While our milkshakes came out pretty quickly, we had to wait a while for the burgers. When the burgers did come, mine was split into two orders, which I didn't ask for. It didn't really make sense since each person ordered one burger so why would we have one split into two orders? They didn't apologize for the mix up and I ended up eating a split burger. I think the delay resulted in an overcooked burger. But everyone's burgers were overdone compared to what they asked for. Apparently medium means medium-well and medium rare means medium, etc. The sweet potato fries were also dry and soggy at the same time, a result of the wait time. The highlights of the meal were the Nutella milkshake and the peppercorn cream sauce. I think the sauce would be more practical if it had been put in a small dipping cup over a pouring jug. If you love hazelnut, the milkshake is like drinking liquid Nutella.\n\nOverall, the food did not merit the price paid. I've also never been to a place where they charge to split something like a milkshake. Our server didn't even check on us once until the very end. I understand that it's a new restaurant and the kinks will be worked out. But it was still a disappointing meal and I think I would have gotten great satisfaction eating at Red Robin.

I felt so bad for her--she had the deer-in-headlights look the entirety of our stay--but I wasn't going to skip asking for something because she was overwhelmed. Also, her manager could have stepped in and helped at any point but chose to stand at the perimeter of the room and do nothing instead. Also, no modifications to the burgers. We couldn't add anything, we couldn't make our own burger. \n\nOur beers took forever to come out. And they didn't come out in the right glasses. I don't care about the shape of my glass but for a place to make such haughty distinctions and then not live up to the expectations it made for itself is lame.\n\nEveryone's food took different times to come out. By the time I got my burger, I was STARVING. I had ordered the American cheeseburger and was hoping it would be good. It was not good. It was so far from good I was offended that this place had any reputation at all. The burger was completely tasteless. My boyfriend got the buffalo burger and he didn't fare any better.\n\nThe only pro is the strawberry milkshake. My friend ordered one. It was so tiny that she ended up ordering three.

We settled in at the bar, easily getting stools within a few minutes. Our first drink order took about 5 minutes; but the bartender was more than nice in apologizing for taking so long.

I mention this because I've seen so many of the reviews ripping on the service. \n\nFun fact: After checking out the place for a bit, we noticed that this location used to be the old bridal department of Macy's.

I've heard great things about this restaurant  but left completely disappointed.\n\nI came here for a business lunch.  The location is perfect looking down at Union Square.  \n\nUpon arrival the staff was friendly and greeted me.  The place was nearly empty with only 2 other tables at 11:30am.  My greeting was where it all the glitz ended.  After being seated, the entire experience went downhill with service and food.\n\nTo start, our server took our drink orders.  I had to remind the server to bring my drink.  He had left it sitting on the counter and by the time it was served to me my ice was melted and received a watered down drink.  I was also surprised that drinks were served in plastic cups.  Not a great look for what I thought would be a high end burger joint.\n\nWe ordered two entrees and a side of fries to share.  The entrees were good just not spectacular.  I could have had a similar order at Red Robin or TGIFridays.  Again we had to remind the server to bring out our fries.  We were half way done with our entrees by the time he remembered to bring them out.  When they arrived they were barely warm.\n\nFor the price on the menus and the name backing the restaurant, I would have expected more in regards to service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-21", "description": "Situated in Macy's below a Cheesecake Factory and serving alcoholic milk shakes, this place screams T.G.I.Friday's with more subtle inward flair.  Thankfully their make your own burger menu goes beyond the realm of BBQ sauce to truffles and foie gras.  Alright, so it's more yuppie than suburban, but still feels mall chain restaurant-ish (which technically it is being the third Burger Bar and located in the mallish Macy's).\n\nBurger Patties: Had the Black Angus Beef and Country Natural (sustainable) which were so similar they warranted the same review.  The insides on both were cooked to request perfectly.  The outsides had a good browning with a some spices: definitely black pepper in the mix.  In the upper echelon for sure.\n\nOnion Bun: Like a brioche with onions on top.  Enjoyed the consistency while the onion flavor was too subtle to notice given everything else that was going on in the burger.\n\nSourdough: Always a San Francisco specialty.  Was as good as an Acme or Boudin.\n\nBlack P\u00e9rigord Truffle Sauce: I expected truffled decadence and received mushroom gravy.  Granted, the black truffle is not as potent as the white truffle, but it still has a nice flavor when used in proper portions.  This reminds me of those deception lobster bisques that only have flecks of lobster in them!\n\nRich Red Wine & Shallots Reduction: This was a great sauce to absorb into the buns and give the feeling of a fancy au jus.  Very well suited to make good beef better!\n\nCheeses: Had the provolone and blue cheese.  In this day of super fancy (and often local/sustainable/organic) cheeses, it was disappointing *not* to see some name dropping (Cow Girl, Cypress Grove, Point Reyes, Andante) or more exotic cheeses listed.\n\nJalape\u00f1o Bacon: A culinary first for me!  When you're tired of smoked, peppered and mapled varieties it's always exciting to see a new pork fat option!  It tasted like the jalape\u00f1o juices were coming out of the bacon.  Possibly my favorite topping!\n\nProscuitto: Cut the thickness of deli ham rather than traditional airy proscuitto.  Definitely better than actual ham, but a let down for afficiandos that only use proscuitto on cheap nights when not eating serrano or ib\u00e9rico.\n\nCosmo Milk Shake: You had me at alcohol and ice cream!  The strawberry ice cream, orange liqueur and citron vodka are a good combination, but don't really taste like a cosmo since cosmos are never creamy.  I'd call it more a jacked up strawberry creamsicle.  Too high of a whipped cream to shake ratio for my tastes though.\n\nIrish Coffee Milk Shake:  Whiskey and coffee ice cream are a brilliant combination, why has no one else been doing this sooner?  Probably because svelte bar goers would look like Middle American couch potatoes if all our hard alcohol came wrapped in tasty ice cream!  The caramel sauce and chocolate liqueur make this even more irresistible!\n\nZucchini Fries: Breaded like mozzarella sticks, but with a much less interesting center.  I can't believe with so much attention paid to burger toppings, specialty fry dips are ignored.", "author": "Adam B."}

However, as a Georgia girl raised on a cattle farm, I can really appreciate a well-crafted burger and I do not find comfort in (for example) the ground shrimp concoctions that are taking the place of an all-beef patty on certain trendy menus. This being said, I was excited to visit Chef Hubert Keller's Burger Bar while I was staying in San Francisco this past month; it certainly did not hurt that my hotel was in eye-sight of the Macy's in which Burger Bar is located. My classmate, who works as a Chef in her own state, is just as much of a burger freak as I am and was thrilled at the idea of stopping in on our way back to the hotel from our romp around the Ferry Building. Upon checking-in with the hostess we were told to expect a 15 minute wait and were satisfied that we only had to stall for about 7 or 8 minutes. Even better, we were seated next to a window overlooking Union Square so that we could enjoy the beautiful day outside from our comfortable perch 6 stories up.\n\nWalking the hills again had re-whetted my appetite and thirst so I started my order with a Pyramid Breweries Hefeweizen while Robin went for a flight of sampler pours including the Pyramid Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Pyramid Outburst Imperial IPA and the privately-labeled Burger Bar Brew. Robin seemed to enjoy getting to taste so many options and I thoroughly enjoyed my wheat beer; it was the perfect weather for this light, slightly yeasty wheat beer. Before we could make up our minds on burgers (there are SO many options to either pick a composed burger or to create your own from endless choices) we picked out an appetizer to split. The Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles were something to behold and provided the perfect combination of slightly pickled, flavorful heat and substantial batter to absorb the spicy juices and create a rich, yet slightly crisp, exterior. The chipotle aioli that accompanied the jalapeno fries provided just enough creaminess to balance the heat; I cannot see ordering these gems with any other sauce offered on the menu. Finally, as if the fun flavors were not enough, the battered peppers were served in a cute miniature fry-basket; this was a first in presentation for me!\n\nMulling over the menu while I munched on jalapenos helped to inspire my customized burger and Robin and I agreed that we were ready to place our next order just as our waitress approached. I was allowed to order first and chose a toasted onion bun as my base, the sustainable Country Natural burger (cooked mid-rare), caramelized onion and pan-seared foie gras for my add-ons and the rich red wine and shallot reduction as my sauce. After placing my order I guess Robin decided to simplify things and just asked for one of the same, right down to the skinny fries with a classic aioli. Despite my longing for the $60 Rossini Burger (a Kobe creation oozing black truffles and foie gras) I was thrilled with my own composition and I am comfortable to say that this ranked in my top five favorite burgers and is kept company by the Black Tie Burger of Minetta Tavern in Manhattan and the 10 O'clock Burger of Holeman & Finch in Atlanta (In-N-Out holds a spot near the top as well, but for totally different reasons). The burger was perfectly cooked and rich without being fatty and the foie gras added a beautiful element of creamy caramelization and decadence (gotta get your fix of California foie gras before July 1st!). The shallot reduction was the perfect finish to the structure and the fries were an excellent accompaniment without being too starchy, yet still satisfying.\n\nI will go back to Burger Bar again next time that I am on the west coast and would definitely check out Chef Keller's Las Vegas Burger Bar location next time I am in Sin City.

Seriously, all he has to do is pass out kobe burgers and black & white shakes to the voters, and Keller could rule the free world.\n\nIt's hard for a burger to get much better than this: you have an amazing selection of meats (kobe is my fave, but there's also buffalo and salmon,\n to name a few), a huge variety of toppings, and a delicious array of buns.  The only thing that sucks is it takes a while to peruse the menu and make all these decisions.  But it's so worth it.  What you get at the end is a truly custom burger with amazing flavor. The only thing I'd love to see added to the topping selection is peanut butter (for New Orleans style PB and bacon, or my fave, thai style PB and jalapenos).  \n\nSetting aside the burgers for a second, let's talk side dishes.  The fried pickles are salty-crunchy deliciousness on a stick (well, technically on a plate) and the fries (of which there are several different varieties, of course) will please even the most persnickety fry connoisseur.

The service was absolutely abysmal. We were constantly trying to flag down our waiter who seemed to never be around. When our food finally came they made mistakes on three of our six orders. Then, when it was time to pay the bill, the waiter dropped the tab and left. The bussers came and started cleaning/MOVING our table while we were still seated waiting for our waiter to come and take the tab with our card. Ten minutes later (after the bussing staff forced us out of our chairs to stand) we took the bill to the Maitre D' table ourselves to close it out.\n\nThe food was decent. Certainly overpriced for the quality. Every single one of our 6 burgers was overcooked.

After hearing so much about it, we finally came here after the Yelp Holiday party across the street. \n\nThe establishment is a lot smaller than I envisioned, long and very narrow. I ordered the American Kobe beef burger that everyone raves about. While the chuck itself was excellent, the rest of the burger left something to be desired. I'm not sure what I expected - maybe because Hubert Keller's name is all over the place, I wanted something exotic, a twist on the classic burger. But what I got was a plain ol' burger with special meat. It wasn't bad by any means but I've had better (using just regular ground beef at that). \n\nMy cousin had the peppercorn angus burger and while I can't speak for her, she also seemed far from blown away. The Nutella shake was awesome the first few sips but became overload quickly. They should blend the Nutella into the shake instead of just piling the syrup over it. \n\nNot bad, if I'm in the area I'll give it another try.

Those were great experiences but things seem to have gone down hill.  Burger Bar used to be a high quality restaurant and we didn't mind paying for the extra attention to food and service. Now, however, it seems like a run of the mill touristy burger restaurant.  \n\nFirst off, the wait was long but to be expected as it is busy in downtown SF around the holidays. They underestimated our wait (45 min) but overall got seated within an hour or so of putting our name down.  For whatever reason, there were many tables empty even though there continued to be a long wait.\n\nOur server was very nice but still the overall service was poor.  \n\n1.  We had a TV in the booth but it was showing an inappropriate show (for children) with curse words, etc.  We asked to change the channel to the Warriors game but our server didn't know how to find the remote.\n2.  My son ordered a kids sliders meal and was told that it came plain.  When it was served, the burger had cheese on it. Since our son doesn't eat cheese we asked for a new one and the waitress was understanding and replaced it. However, when my son got his burger, it was obvious they just scraped the cheese off.  My son chose not to complain about it and tried eating it but it really ruined his meal.\n3.  My daughter went to use her napkin and it was really dirty. Gross!\n4.  The milkshake was good although they initially brought the wrong milkshake to us. But it was nothing we would seek out.  \n5. Overall the service was slow and unfriendly.  The servers just dropped the food off at the table without saying anything.  We hardly saw our waitress. It was hard to even pay our bill.\n6.  Lastly, the food was not even very good. The chicken burger had no taste.  The other burgers were pretty bland. The french fries were not even crunchy and were also very plain.\n\n\nWe were hoping to have a nice holiday meal with the kids at Union Square however it really was a disappointment and we have no plans to return or recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Courtney T."}

It  was and felt like a local bar that happened to serve unique burgers. If it were in my neighborhood, I would probably visit every other week.\n\nFor the food, I created my own burger. Angus Beef (Medium Rare) on a Sesame Bun with Jalapeno Bacon, Provolone Cheese, Prosciutto, and Foie Gras on the side. The beef was cooked exactly how I wanted and the Jalapeno Bacon added that needed \"kick\" without being overpowering. However, that \"kick\" may have numbed my taste buds to the Prosciutto and Foie Gras because I was unable to taste them. Go figure. Anyway, I washed down my meal with a Coney Island Beer.

I didn't like the Salmon Burger, sometimes things aren't meant to be switched around like that. My sliders were cute and okay, but a little on the dry side. The buffalo burger looked tempting, but I've had real fresh buffalo (read: buffalo steaks at a buffalo farm in Wyoming), so I didn't want to try it here. \n\nCan't comment on the setting/view, since we sat right at the bar.

BUT, to be fair, you can't walk into a designer burger place in Union Square on top of Macy's owned by Hubert Keller and then dock stars simply because the burgers are $20.  In reality, it really isn't that different from Carls Jr. charging $8 for their fancy burgers either, I mean...it's Carls Jr.  So with that said, yes they have $20 burger, they even have a $40 burger,  it just all depends on how fancy the one you order is.  I mean I ordered the buffalo sliders, which comes with fries and it was only $12.\n\nOk, on to the food.  They burgers are good but it didn't blow me away good.  I have definitely had better at small local burger joints.  I read a few reviews here raving about the sweet potato fries and all I can say is, yalls are trippin.  My husband got regular fries and they are so much better, it fits with the burger meal.  The sweet potato fries are just too sweet for the burger so it doesn't compliment well, and it isn't crispy (insert sad face).  However, the shakes they have are to die for.  We got the twinkies shake and it has chunks of twinkies in there and half of one as a garnish.  It was SO good, taste just as you would expect. \n\nThe service is very mediocre and slow.

I was expecting more out of the place since there has been so much hype about it due to it being Hubert's restaurant. I possibly would have had a better experience if I didn't have any expectations going in.\n\nIt gets fairly crowded on weekends since it's located on the 6th floor of Macy's in Union Square. I'm guessing many of their customers are hungry shoppers dropping in for a meal. The service is a bit slow and the food isn't quite worth the price. The average price of a specialty burger is $20. If you want to build your own burger, it costs about $8-9 for just the meat. All the add-ons are charged separately so the cost of the burger ends up being close to $12-15 ($0.75-$0.95 for a piece of cheese, about $1 for grilled vegetables, $1-$2 for sauces, etc.). If you want fries or a side salad, that's an extra $2-4. The burgers at The Counter are typically $9-$11 but the price of the burger already includes the toppings and sauces.  The portions are bigger at The Counter too.     \n\nReview of what we ordered:\n\nMarinated Chicken Breast with Whole Wheat Bun - $9.25\n+pineapple $0.95 + side salad $2.50\n-Chicken was somewhat dry and oily. The side salad is a typical mixed greens salad. The bun was possibly my favorite part because it was toasted just right. \n \nMarinated Chicken Breast with Whole Wheat Bun - $9.25\n+ avocado $1.55 + sweet potato fries $3.35\n-Sweet potato fries were good and not too oily. However, The Counter's sweet potato fries are definitely better...better tasting + bigger portions. \n\nWe wanted to order dessert but most of the desserts were $9-$12 milkshakes so we decided to pass. \n\nOverall, very mediocre and doesn't live up to all the hype.", "author": "Angela F."}

We had planned on going to the Cheesecake but after stepping off the elevator into a tourist mob scene, we decided to try Burger Bar. We walked right in and were sat down immediately at a table with a great view of Union Square. \n\nThe service was good, but our waitress could have used some help. She was the server for all of the tables in the bar area and had a guy shadowing her awkwardly and not doing much of anything to help. That being said it took a little longer to get help, but we were in no rush. She gave great suggestions on the burgers and was knowledgeable about the beers on tap. \n\nWe ordered a pitched of Magic Hat #9 (I highly suggest it as well)  and I ordered the \"Le Frog\" Burger with sweet potato fries. My girlfriend and her dad had some buffalo burger with a red wine reduction and caramelized onions that they were raving about. We were very satisfied with the food and when it was time for desert the milkshakes sounded too good to pass up. We ordered a half vanilla and half chocolate shake and it was to die for. They come with huge straws to make for easy drinking of the thick and tasty shake. \n\nNow this is where things went south, Like I said earlier the waitress had no real help for all the tables in the bar area. So we finished our shakes and sat there for what felt like an eternity waiting for her to come back and check on us or bring the check by. We had to stop her before she went to help another table because she would look at us otherwise. So once we finally got the bill we got up to leave and noticed a line for the elevator backed up into the bar. We thought no biggie we will just take the escalator.. but it wasn't possible, Macy's had closed and the only way out  was via the elevator. But of course with the cheesecake factory above every elevator coming down was full of people already.  BTW the max occupancy was 10 people on the elevator and every one was packed with almost 15. Crazy!\n\nWe asked the Hostesses if there was another way out and they told us that there were stairs but that using them would set off the fire alarm. We demanded to speak to the manager and when the Hostess told him we wanted to talk to him he told her there is nothing I can do and didn't even make an effort to apologize to us. \n\nI doubt it is the first time that this has happened, but it should be dealt with. I am sure the Fire Marshall would not be okay with this. I know I wasn't. \n\nAnyway go before Macy's closes and you will have a great meal and experience.

I ordered something different - the Kobe burger with my usual \"healthy\" additions of swiss cheese, bacon, and avacado.  The server asked me how I wanted it cook and I said, \"medium rare.\" After eating 1/4 of it, I was upset about how it was more well done!  I told the server, but first asking for his feedback as I showed him the missing redness from my burger. He apologized and brought it back. My family witnessed this mess. I mean it's a $24 burger at Burger Bar...get it right!  \n\n2nd burger comes out and I eat half of it to feel the same discomfort because it was well done again or close to it. I have the server look at it again after he asks me how's my burger. At this point, I'm over it and just deal, but the server was embarrassed and took it back to the kitchen and told his manager about it. 3rd burger is better, but I usually get more blood/redness at other restaurants. The manager and server repeatedly apologized for the previous attempts and offered a free dessert. We get the most expensive one - banana split with the works!  \n\nI really respect Chef Hubert Keller, but I am sure he would fire the chef that prepared my order 3 times!

As a matter of fact, after dating a \"gourmet\" hamburger addict, I've become rather an expert on all things hamburger.   That said, when my daughter suggested we have our post Black Friday Shopping Expedition dinner at the Burger Bar, I was sooooo \"in\".    \n\nImagine my huge disappointment when my \"Kobe\" burger arrived way, way, way over cooked.  It looked more like a charbroiled hockey puck than a top-of-the-line hamburger. It was so dry and overdone I sent it back...in spite of a lifelong pledge to never, ever return food.  So, the sweet waitress acknowledged the meat was over done and returned it to the kitchen...they quickly sent out another burger...only slightly less over cooked.  \n\nI suppose I should back up to clarify that I had asked the waitress how her chef defined as burger with a \"sliver of pink\"...medium or medium well.  She said the kitchen had a tendency to UNDER cook their meat, so she recommended medium well.   Now, one would think when I sent it back, the chef would rethink the original order and go for medium...e.g., that sliver of pink.  At any rate, beyond being over done, the burger really had no flair.  It didn't taste like the kobe steaks I've had in the past....quite honestly, it tasted like a plain, ol', regular, not overly flavorful hamburger.  Not to mention, with all of the rework that was done to the burger, my bun was dry...dry...dry.  \n\nNot to mention, one of the managers stopped by to ask how we were enjoying dinner...I told him about the over cooked burger and he mumbled something about the kitchen having a tendency to under cook and walked away!?   \n\nMy daughter said her burger was nicely done...\n\nOh, well.

I think the other reviews refer to the great view--I guess it's cool if you like overlooking the square--we were watching PX90 commercials and old hockey footage at the bar. The beer selection seemed good. I had the lambic, which I get wherever I find it on draught and there were a full side of the menu that listed all the beers they have.\n\nThe service was slow, we weren't asked if we wanted anything until we were there for about 15 minutes...at the bar...on a slow rainy afternoon...\nWe ordered wings, the American Classic for me and Peppercorn Burger for HungryD. \n\n1. The wings were good. I asked for them dry. I know. I know. HungryD likes his smothered in the sauce too but I personally like them cooked and then dipped, by me, in accompanying sauces. I just do. I think it makes for a better wing experience. This way the wing stays crispy and the sauce stays kinda cold and gives it a nice dippy taste. Shrug. The wings came out steaming (yum!) and the hot sauce was tangy and good.\n\n2. Subsequently about 2 seconds after our appetizers came out. (Yes, I said 2 SECONDS), they brought us our burgers. I saw the bartender give the runner a look that said, \"OH HECK, but i JUST brought out their appies...what should..I...uh...\" Well, the runner made the executive decision to bring us our burgers anyways. Eh, I didn't really mind, although it would have been nice to at least have a moment or two alone with the wings so I could give them the mouth time they deserved.\n\n3. Fries were cold. gross. It came out in mini-fry baskets...they were the thin kind and they were cold. UGH. that's all I can say. \n\n4. The burger was okay. There was lots of meat that tasted good. The bacon that came with it was kinda crispish and the lettuce/tomato looked the way they were supposed to and you get a pickle spear. Not bad but not worth the $15 it cost for me to eat it. HungryD's burger? $17ish or so and he didn't look so impressed either. I guess we could have just shared the kobe/foie gras burger they have for $80 and at least had bragging rights or some sort of cool story to tell. Nope, just some cold fries and a pretty mediocre experience.\n\nSo...overall?\n\nI guess if you're there for the view and you like the novelty of eating in a department store, this might be the place for you. I just realized that after paying the bill, I would rather stand in line at the airport and get a McD's Cheeseburger combo with hot fries right out of the fryer in a red recyclable container and buy $70 of booze instead. I'm just saying.", "author": "jina y."}

Burger Bar offers diners numerous choices, including organic, free range, buffalo, vegetarian, as well as many other forms of burgers.  Diners can choose from a list of Chef's Selections or create their own monstrosity a la carte.\n\nHowever, this plethora of selections comes with a stiff price tag.  From a Country Natural Burger for a mere $10.50 to a Kobe Beef Burger for more than $60, Hubert reaches deep into diners' wallets.  To add insult to injury, the ever-shrewd business man has the gall to charge for \"extras\" like tomato, lettuce,and mustard that should be included.\n\nIf diners are paying dearly for their burgers, they are entitled to good service, right?  Not so at Burger Bar. While there were numerous, friendly young servers clad in black pants and white shirts running around, the wait for drinks was nearly 20 minutes and delivery of food took even longer, indicating serious \"production\" problems in the back of the house.\n\nWell, at least patrons can relax while getting their pockets picked, right?  No, not at Burger Bar.  Far from being an calm oasis in the mel\u00e9e of shopping crazed Union Square, the brightly lit and noisy dining room is not conducive to a relaxed dinner.  With an atmosphere reminiscent of an upscale Wendy's, Hubert's business plan obviously relies on volume rather than quality.\n\nIf you are looking for a really good burger, there are far better (and less expensive) establishments in The City.

After a bit of confusion, we found Burger Bar located within the Macy's building. The menu is very pricey, this is has a large part in experience pricing. The real estate and the presentation of our meals were probably added into the price of our tab. There's also my first time seeing a SF Healthy Fee of 3.5% added to our overall check. \n\nOur server was fairly out of it, he had a blank indifference vibe whenever he was taking requests. Even though he's not the most friendliest server we had, he was fairly prompted with our orders and checked up on us frequently.\n\nOne friend went for the Burger Bar Sliders with onion rings, another for the American Kobe with cheese and a side of sweet potato fries, and I went for the Hubert Keller burger. The Hubert Keller burger is supposedly the signature burger named after the founder and owner of Burger Bar. I stole a sweet potato fry from my friend's plate was amazed how sweet and crispy it was. My Hubert Keller burger was pretty interesting spinach and cheese topped  it came with a side of sauce that I topped onto my meat. I asked for a medium rare burger and it was perfectly done, the sauce actually did kind cooked parts of my meat through. The ciabatta bread is nicely toasted it got a lil soggy from the sauce I poured over my meat. The spinach was nicely cooked and it's a uniquely accompanied helping the to the burger. The skinny fries was put into a little mini deep fryer basket. It was my first time actually having a burger done medium rare since I still have beliefs of any meat that goes through a grounding process. The burger was quite good.\n\nSurprisingly with my huge appetite, I'm stuffed three-quarters from my meal. I barely able to finish my skinny cut fries. To accompanied the burger, I ordered the Nutella milkshake since it's strongly recommended by Pei. I can see why some people like the milkshake a lot. The milkshake made of a generous amount of nutella, I would say that more than half of the milkshake was actually nutella itself.

The location is convenient, we were seated right away in one of the high tables against the window. It was beautiful looking over union square especially the holiday ice skating rink. The fry selection is great garlic, curly, sweet potato and onion rings. We got curly fries which were the same you get anywhere, actually is prefer the ones from jack in the box. But, the onion rings  were AMAZING!!!  Thick buttermilk batter, fried to a country perfection.  The chocolate shake was also delicious and they seem to be big on shakes with tons of customizable toppings and syrups.

It was the only restaurant they knew of, and wanted to go.\n\nI dont want this to be a biased review just based on burgers because I really haven't eaten hamburgers in a long time so I can't give that a review to its full potential. But my bf n I split a salad and something else that was alright. Their sweet potato fries were delicious but served cold. The dipping sauce was bomb. Drinks/ beer from the bar was good. Server seemed like a fake airhead. When she talked to us, it's as if she wasn't really listening and looking passed us.\n\nNow that I live in the city, when I see a restaurant that is way too overpriced I am just not impressed. Since I live in the sunset and make most of my own food, if I can make the plate for myself at home, I dont see the point of slappin' $10 on a plate of leaves-- what for? Presentation? The fact that there are TV's at each booth, so need $? There are so many other DELICIOUS restaurants out there that are fighting to stay alive and open in SF. They have recipes that have been passed down by generations, including the same pan that their grandparents used (collects allllll the deliciousness people). Big chain companies just don't understand quality, and the reason they even get massive amounts of $$$ is because so many people have been brainwashed with fast food---they don't know real flavor when they taste it. \n\nWhat bothers me is that it seems that restaurants these days keep trying to compensate quality for quantity. If you slap up a buncha big screens and little tv's then that is supposed to entice the customer to enjoy the ambiance. However.......please realize that customers are ALWAYS going to remember the food and the service the most--accounts for 80%. That many tv's is good for a sports bar, but not in a restaurant. Why are you trying to sell the idea to customers that they all need their own tv to watch, instead of sitting down to a bomb meal and talking/laughing/drinking with each other.

You can order 1 and have them split it into 2 tiny glasses, for you and your friend, or bf/gf...\n\nTo further your dining experience at Burger Bar, they are located on the 7th floor of Macy's women in Union Square.

Considering the ho-hum yelp reviews and the newness of the place, I was very much prepared to underwhelmed and dare I say, disappointed. So pleased that it wasnt the case at all.\n\n730 pm on an Thursday? We were certain to have beaten the crowd. Nope. We ask the hostess in the lobby the wait she told us an hour. We weren't quite convinced as it was pretty apparent she had taken a leaf out of Tim Lincecums book if you catch my drift. \n\nAlas indeed that it was an hour wait. There wasn't even seating at the bar,  it was so packed. I jet off to the restroom only to return to find HUBERT KELLER himself mingling with us minions waiting. \n\nSo my friend (who doesn't quite have my sense of celebrity chef awe) says to him: \"Well I hope the food is good enough for an hour's wait\" \n....I DIE.... \nBut just like that Hubert takes our name to the hostess, they look intently at the computer, and we are seated five minutes later. AMAZING. He's not walking around fishing for compliments, he is clearly a hands on chef who is in the trenches ensuring the success of the resto. He took pictures with us and came by several times to check on us. I also noticed that when people were seated around us (those who had been waiting longer than us, oops) he made sure to bring a milkshake over to each table and greet each guest and apologize for the delay. whatta charmer. 2 stars right there.... \n\nWalking past the dozens of folks throwing some SERIOUS shade because of our luck (or my friend's big mouth?) we are seated in an area that had several open booths. Tsk Tsk hostess girl. Server comes, seems a little harried but is certainly attentive when its our turn. Clearly the staff was on edge. Who wouldn't be with the \"Michelin Man\" standing by and overseeing everything?!?\n\nFood: I had the country natural w pepper bacon, Monterrey jack, caramelized onions and aioli. After noticing yelp says it comes about a half bit more done than specified I ordered it well-medium. .... \nit came rare..... \nI hope that means that folks are taking notice of the feedback on yelp. However, a little too over-corrected for my plate... \n\nFriends had the veggie burger which was dense, nicely seasoned and very satisfying because of its cohesive texture. She RAVED about the pickled veggie root that accompanied it. \nTurkey burger was also good, with nice smoky flavor without overpowering burger. onion rings and fries pretty good. Aioli best on fries, lost punch in my burger and turkey burger. \n\nOverall, we were quite satisfied (surprisingly). We had an amazing meal which was somewhat pricey for a burger but its Hubert, in Macys, in Union Square.... so I anticipate tourists packing this place for a long time to come. \n\nsidenote-I really wanted him to win Top Chef so I appreciate his having the fancy resto w great views, while Rick Bayless' Frontera is banished in the basement food court.

It's more like \"surprise sex!\"\nI had been to the location in Vegas before this one so I knew what I wanted: a kobe beef burger on a ciabatta roll, with swiss cheese, bacon, mushrooms, guacamole, onions, and lettuce. The ciabatta felt like it came right out of an oven... crunchy on the edges but a soft, fluffy roll nonetheless. The guac was flavorful, creamy and I could taste the fresh tomatoes in the spread. The mushrooms, well, they did not disappoint. The price I paid for the Kobe beef... well, I didn't feel jipped. Could most definitely tell the difference in the quality of the beef. It was a decent size and if it weren't for the fries (which were crispy and realllll fresh) I wouldn't have felt totally fat waddling out of there back to the hotel.\n\nI'm also not a person for sweet things, but I do love their shakes! It's real ice cream and they have different things you can get blended into it and different toppings.

You can either use the side elevators on Geary Street or ride the escalators to the restaurant. Arriving on a late Saturday morning, getting a table for six wasn't a problem. Seated in a booth facing Union Square, we were impressed by the \"personal\" TV screen at our table, showing the Cal game (Go Bears!). The menu offers a variety of selections where you can follow their suggestions or build your own burger. To buy more time, we ordered each of the side dishes except for the pickled jalapenos to share. The list went like this: \na) Crispy thin fries - nicely cut, but just lukewarm. \nb) Sweet potato fries - tasty and sweet, but again just warm \nc) Thick cut fries - came hot and melt-in-your-mouth soft. \nd) Onion rings - came hot too and crispy thick. \ne) Zucchini Fries - served hot but not as health as it sounds.\n\nAsking our waitress' recommendation of meats (Kobe - \"fattier flavor\", Angus, Country Natural), I followed her suggestion for the Country Natural, a local organic beef ($16.50 before accompaniments). One of my friends did his homework on the Internet, noticing a burger combination on the website menu named MBA. The description listed grilled mushrooms, bacon, and avocado.

It took you a good 20 minutes before you took our order and it WASN'T even busy on a Wednesday Night. We weren't asked about the drink menu, were barely checked on, and the only time you hurried up was when it came to paying for the bill.\n\nAnd why do people automatically get seated at the bar area and are NOT asked if they want a table? Lame. \n\nSigh. I still get mistaken for being a college student because I am often dressed in flip flops and jeans (I have a casual dress code at my job) and I am lugging around a backpack (my work laptop stays with me at all times). It seems like at Burger Bar to get decent service you have to dress up. Seriously? Burger Bar has comparable atmosphere to Cheesecake Factory next door.

It's across from the Cheesecake Factory on Union Square....you don't anymore touristy than that.  And unlike the Cheesecake Factory, they don't have the outside balcony, so you only get the gorgeous view from the inside.  Considering how windy it gets up there, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  \n\nAll that being said, the burgers aren't bad.  Sure, they are a little frou-frou and every single one on the menu is over $10.  But how many places can you get a Kobe burger with grilled fois gras?  On the other hand, how many times are you going to pay $60 for a burger?  I didn't get the Kobe/fois gras burger.  I got something a little more down to earth; something that would let me taste that meaty beefy flavor that I love so much.  I didn't ask, but I would guess that the meat is like an 80/20 mix.  Certainly not any leaner, otherwise you wouldn't have the taste.  \n\nThe Black Jack burger was good.  Done properly, though maybe a little over.  Still tasty and not dry at all.  The thing is is they serve their burgers on a cibatta bun.  It's nice, and makes it a little classier, but it doesn't have the same consistency as a regular hamburger bun.  It does soak up all the juices pretty well though and does contribute nicely to the taste.  And it holds up better as well.  \n\nThe fries were good, though very under seasoned.  I had the \"fat fries\" which is another term for steak fries.  The portion that comes with the burger is pretty small, though the place is called the Burger Bar, so they make it clear what they want you to see as the star of the show.  \n\nI would say I'm a fan of this place. This was my second time there, but the first time I really got to really think about the meal.  Service was good and the place was clean.  I would definitely come back here.", "author": "Adam E."}

There were TV's at each table but featured nothing I would want to watch. The burger that I ordered (medium) was really piecy and crumbled. The beef did not even stay in the shape of a patty. It was kind of gross. Two other people ordered theirs both \"medium\" and got burgers that were obviously cooked differently. \n\nAfter we finished, we asked to talk to the manager. Now, mind you, we are NOT the type of people to do something like that EVER! It's just something you don't do. However, we told him we were not looking for a discount but simply wanted to let him know that the burgers were not cooked the same and were of somewhat poor quality. Well, Mr. Macho seemed like he didn't really want to hear it. All he said was that he'd take them off the bill.

I would get this exact combination again.\n* Irish Creme milkshake: I'll never look at Irish Creme the same way again. Alcohol & dairy mixes really well in this amazing concoction.\n* sweet potato fries- just so-so.

I really liked that it didn't cost extra to have sweet potato rather than regular skinny fries.\n\nAnyway, my boyfriend ordered sweet potato fries with his burger as well but they mixed up and gave him regular fries. After letting them know, they brought out his sweet potato fries and also let him keep the regular ones as well! More for me! Hehe\n\nOne of my friend's asked for her meat to be cooked 'medium rare' but when it came out, it was bloody red. She asked them to re-do it politely but when it came back out 20 minutes later, it was WELL-DONE. Like..SUPER WELL-DONE. I don't know what was their problem...either the cook was just pissed off with her or they forgot about it on the stove.

Thats right people, I am a full fledged burger fanatic.  I eat burgers, I sleep burgers and sometimes I even double fist burgers (although not too often).  So when the opportunity came up to have a burger and a beer at the famed Burger Bar in San Francisco, I simply could not have said no.\n\nNow for those of you peeps out there who don't know, Burger Bar is Hubert Keller's take on an modern gastropub.  They've got tons of beers, wines galore, and gourmet burgers, so for a burger fanatic like myself it begs the question \"what's not to love?\"\n\nWell for starters this place is expensive, yeah you can build your own burger and make it just the way you like it, but when it was all said and done my burger came to a whopping $23 and thats before beer, tax, tip, and a second tax deemed the \"sf health tax\" (WTF).\n\nAnyways I went with the Kobe Burger, and topped it off with blue cheese, carmelized onions and a little aioli for some added fun.  Now while it was a pretty good burger it just didn't do it for me.  I guess I'm spoiled with all the fabulous burger joints we have in LA or maybe I was just stuck on the fact that this burger was way too expensive and not worth the 23 dollar price tag.  \n\nOverall I would say that I expected more from this place and was a bit disappointed in what I got.

They also charge extra for various types of beef and for non-hormone fed beef, etc. With these incredibly customized orders, the delivery of the food was a joke. A guy, not our server, came out and basically just threw seven burgers at us without announcing at all which was which. The person next to me got a bun with a giant thumbprint pressed into it. Seriously? I have no idea if I got the regular Angus beef or the non-hormone-fed beef I ordered (and paid extra for). You cannot do that. I even asked the server if she could tell the difference between my non-hormone classic burger and the Angus classic someone else got and she could not say for sure.

I had been wanting to go for quite some time, especially after going to Fleur de Lys and loving that place. \n\nWe ordered the kobe beef burger and the buffalo sliders. I enjoyed my sliders, but the kobe beed burger was just \"meh\". We expected something remarkable about it, but it tasted just like any other burger. I'm assuming it's because Kobe loses what it's known for when it's ground up: tenderness. It was no where near worth the $16 price tag. The sliders were enjoyable, but didn't have anything about them that made me go \"wow!\". I'm sorry to say it, but I think places like \"The Counter\" on the Peninsula make it hard to enjoy this place.", "author": "Amanda D."}

Kobe beef burgers around $15 then your additional toppings  can get a little pricey but very decliciouso! All burgers come with your choice of bun: wheat, onion, ciabatta, seasame (to name a few) and lettuce, tomato, and a pickle. If Kobe beef aint your thing, they have several other choices of meats including chicken and a salmon patty if meat ain't your thang. Starter menu items include salads, soup, fish & chips. Dessert items are fab! They also include build your own shake, if your into that stuff.\n\nWith my burger, I always order the sweet potato fries and Abita's Purple Haze beer. This beer is amazing! Berry infused beer, very girlie :)\n\nLove the view of union square, daytime or nighttime. I have ate here several times usually around dinner time, and there is always a wait on the weekends.

I have no problems with celebrity chefs, but running restaurants is not about waiting for lines it's all about the experience.

The only way I could have eaten a better burger was if I added on a crapload of toppings and end up spending $30 on a so-so burger. The ciabatta bun was good though! It was not hard to chew at all which is always the concern for ciabatta. \n\nThe zucchini fries were moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. They were really good. We also tried the deep fried pickles and they were delicious! I love pickles! Deep fried makes it even better. Watch out though because the crust likes to come off real easily since there's nothing to hold onto the pickle spear. YUM.\n\nI had a bite of Joe's Kobe burger and it was good.

No more than 30 seconds later, a rude customer came up and said she'd been PROMISED that table. Fine, we'll wait for another. We went back in the system and headed over to gift-wrap again. Got some boxes and got another call. No table yet, so I decided we'd just wait there, another 15 minutes, we were sat at a window table. Great. \n\nMomma loves sliders, and I've started taking after her. We each ordered the sliders, her's with sweet potato fries, mine with curly fries, we also ordered an onion ring appetizer. I was intrigued by the sliders because there's 3 different kinds of meat: buffalo, Angus beef, and natural country beef. The tastiest of all, for me, was the Angus. The onion rings came out with the meal, bummer! But over all the burgers were juicy, tender, and well seasoned. \n\nI don't know if I would return here - though my husband is a big fan of buffalo, so I might offer to bring him here. The milkshakes looked great, too... Maybe I'll try one.", "author": "Lauren S."}

It was interesting to watch this elderly shopping pro have no less than three sales clerks hopping in Fine Jewelry. It made me exhausted just watching. We started at 12:30 and she was done with her transaction by 3. We didn't have lunch before getting there either because she made a beeline to shop with her coupons in hand. She was fine. I was starving. \n\nShe says there are two restaurants in house at Macy's: The Cheesecake Factory and the Burger Bar. At that point, I felt I was too weak to go through the phonebook sized menu at CF so we chose the Burger Bar. At 3pm, there was no wait and we got a great window seat view overlooking Union Square on a sunny, beautiful SF day. While this menu wasn't as big as the Tolstoy's War & Peace Cheesecake menu, there were a fair number of pages. One whole page was devoted to shakes. Good thing this was the first day back on my diet!! FML. Anyway, I ordered the lo-cal ass reaming priced burger (no bun) and she got her usual burger with cheese and mushrooms and a side of fries. As others have said in their reviews, the prices here for a hamburger are pretty steep so I was expecting a pretty effing fine tasting burger. What can I say.... I was unimpressed. While the burgers are hefty sized, the taste was okay. Nothing spectacular. My Auntie got a side of spindly fries with no taste (McDonalds and In n Out Burgers have better tasting fries) and an undercooked burger when she asked for medium. My lo-cal meal was okay. The cole slaw was pretty tasteless. The food was mediocre but not for prices they are charging. Good thing she paid for the meal and I was starving or else I would have given them one star. Lol...really, I am bumping it up one star for the view and service. The food was overpriced and just okay. \n\nI guess we paid for the view.", "author": "Barb B."}

You couldn't go into the kitchen and check for yourself? You couldn't offer me an extra side? You couldn't remember that moments ago you had promised me extra lettuce? You couldn't take one or two pieces of lettuce off the TRAYS of salads that left the kitchen for a private party in the next room? Come on! My burger was $12!

Needing food and (more importantly) alcohol to hopefully erase this image from our brains, we decided to go to Burger Bar.\n\nOur expected wait time was 40 minutes, so we decided to hit up the bar for a bit.  There's a huge selection of beer, which was great.  As expected, though, it's overpriced.  $7 for a Stella?  MEH.\n\nThe selection of \"chef-made\" burgers was underwhelming, but the ability to build your own burger pretty much makes up for this.  I got a Greek salad and the Peppercorn Burger, which was pretty filling for two.  The olives in the salad were particularly delicious, and the burger itself was very well made.  I was definitely satisfied after my meal ... and finished it off with another $7 beer.\n\nI think the best thing we had was the London Cloud shake.  Beer + ice cream?!  :: drool ::\n\nAs a burger joint / bar alone, I wouldn't see myself coming back often.

So it wasn't the whole one-topping-per-slider deal that deducts stars from me, but it was the rock hard brioche buns the sliders came in. I seriously took one bite of a slider and the bread split into pieces onto my plate and I swear it made a \"thud\" sound.\n\nFor dessert we all shared a banana split which was good, but the sugar coating (?) on top of the bananas was painfully sharp. \n\nOur waiter was pretty good, but unfortunately I've still gotta give Burger Bar 2 stars.", "author": "Joy L."}

I've been trying to go to Fleur de Lys (which is closed now, not that it matters much).  And now, I think I'll pass on restaurants with his name attached.  My husband and I decided to go here for a birthday lunch.  I didn't comment to the wait staff about my burger but for the rest of the day I wish I had.\n\nMy burger was over cooked and just not that great.  Especially when it all cost $20  Sourdough bun was at least a day old.  And there was no mayo.  Here's the thing with mayo:  You don't need much.  It's not about the taste but more the glue for a burger/sandwich.  It's a bit of a buffer for the ketchup taste (yep, I've thought way to much about mayonnaise).  Our server said I would have to pay for a small bowl of it.  No thanks.  I got a fried egg that was undercooked.  This irked because it cost $2.  I can make a fried egg with a runny yolk but without the runny white.  And it costs less than $2, why can't a professional chef do this?  My husband ordered jalapenos on his burger... he got a little cup of sliced jalapenos.  Nothing else was done to them.  They weren't smoked, fried, anything.  Just a stupid little bowl of jalapenos that cost $.75, which is about the cost of 2 jalapenos from the grocery store.  I think I was saddest about the pickle.  Why give a pickle spear as a side to a burger?  I want it on my burger, not as a palette cleanser.  \n\nThey get 2 stars because the restaurant and bathroom were clean.

The only people that would go to this tourist crap, er trap, are tourists who are shopping at Macy's and couldn't get into the Cheesecake Factory (which I've never been to because I have an idealized vision of what that place is like and I really don't want it shattered by reality).\n\nIn any case, pox on Hubert Keller for lending his name to a stale-concepted, poorly-executed fancy burger place.  My excuse: a 16 year old's birthday party.  The bottom line is that the burgers sucked.  How so?\n\nI ordered the Kobe burger with bacon (I'm a purist except for bacon) on a plain bun, rare.  It arrived a very solid medium and the other two adults ordered their's medium-rare and they were sold well-done - brown shoe leather well-done.  When the waiter stopped by, we asked him (really in a friendly way) whether he thought they were rare or med-rare.  He smiled and said, no that they looked well-down and quickly turned around back to the kitchen.  That was cool, he was going to re-fire everything... mistakes happen.  Five minutes later he comes by to see if we wanted more drinks... then he asks how we like our burgers (uneaten except for 2 bites).  What?  The f*cker had just walked away and hoped that we'd be compliant tourists and eat our overcooked burgers.  So we again asked for them to be recooked.\n\nReplacement burgers show up 5 minutes later... but, no, really?  Mine is still cooked medium?  The bacon tastes of cold pork fat (you can't heat bacon?).  The bun was stale.  The burger had a crumbly texture from too little fat (just because it's Kobe doesn't mean it has the right fat content), was only about 2/3 the size of the bun.\n\nThis place is a crap, cynical restaurant that can't execute on its basic premise, as dated as it is.

I've been here about 5 times and 4 out of the 5 times I've ordered the Buffalo Burger. I think that's the best burger I've ever had.

The menu has A TON of options! They have the usual like  bacon, avocado, cheese,etc. but they also have toppings like jalapenos, aioli, fried egg, and chili. I like how Burger Bar has so many options when you build your burger, but some of the toppings are kind of ridiculous. I mean,why would I put black truffles or foie gras on my burger?\n\nAlso Burger Bar has happy hour, but it ends at 6pm (so early!) so when I go there after work I only have about 10 minutes to order drinks.\n\nBottom line, if they didn't have the buffalo burger then I probably wouldn't come back so often.", "author": "Therese M."}

I was really looking forward to this since I ate at the Las Vegas location last year and had a great experience.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday, and since it was relatively empty, we were seated in one of the outstanding window tables which was great for people watching.  Within the next half hour more tables filled up, but they were probably running at 50% capacity for the night.  \n\nI ordered the American Kobe Burger (med-rare), with cheddar, and jalapeno bacon!  My party also had the skinny fries, fried zucchini, and beer battered onion rings.   They had a great selection of beers on tap, so that was a big plus.\n\nUnfortunately, despite being half full, service was very inattentive....  Our drinks took almost 15 minutes to arrive at our table.  When we got our myriad of fried goodies, we didn't have any plates to put our ketchup on.  Which is fine if our main dishes come out immediately after, but they didn't.  I asked one of the waiters for some plates to put ketchup on.  He gave me a puzzled look and pointed at the ketchup bottle on the table.  Shocked, I responded with a \"I don't feel like pouring ketchup on the table and dipping my fries in it!\"  \n\nAs for the burger, it came out red (completely raw) in the middle and lacked any kind of juiciness.  The other guests in my party also agreed their burger was less than satisfying.  The sesame seed bun was dry and hard, possibly from over toasting.  For the better part of the night, we had to keep asking for service, rather than the waitress coming to ask if we needed anything.  \n\nTo sum it up, the selection of beers was good, sides were pretty good, the burger was blah, and the service was horrible for a half empty restaurant.  \n\nI'll have to give this place another shot in the future, but my first impression was not good.

In the brief 35 years that I have been on this earth, I have experimented with many burger restaurants and chains. \n\nI have created my own blends of different ground meats with varying levels of leanness and fat,seasonings and dressings.  I have used almost every cheese under the sun on top of the burger, between the burger until the cheese oozes out and even under the burger.  To make a long story short, I know my burgers.\n\nJust call me Wimpy, a 34 year old (almost) 300 lb Burger fiend; \"I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a burger today\" should be tattoeed on my ass.\n\nSo last Saturday, my wife and I visited Burger Bar.  Needless to say, great ambiance, elegant seating and more tv's than I can count in one shot.  We sat in a booth near the entry way to the kitchen where the traffic back and forth was distracting me from enjoying the company of my lovely wife.\n\nIt did not help any that the tv in the both we sat in was playing old classic reruns of wrestling matches from the 80's.  Nothing more romantic than watching two sweaty over sized men rubbing up on each other and beating their bodies in to ground beef. Sorry no pun intended.\n\nNext, the extensive list of  beers highlighting the best the world has to offer was lacking in the one I drink most frequently, Heineken.  I opted for the Milk shake instead.  It was great  but when a shake is served on a concaved glass and they do not give you the tin tumbler in which is made, makes for a bad joke of a tease. I swear, I could down that shake in three gulps max.  In this economy, although tasty, not worth the price.\n\nOn to the main course.  the burger.  $60 For a freaking Burger?  are you that self indulgent?  (Sorry, I've been watching American Idol too much).  Give me a break.  Who has discretionary income to afford such an unnecessary and decadent \"luxury\"? \n\nI've already spent too much time at this place and on this review to keep thinking about this financial/ time sink.  \n\nTake it from me, go to Fuddruckers!!!  Fuddruckers offers a great selection of Burgers that are 100% USDA fresh ground beef.  Or, you can choose, Buffalo, Kolbe beef, hot dogs or chicken from their menu.  \n\nWhat I find impressive is that their buns are made from scratch every morning  and throughout the day on the premises.  Equally impressive is the farm-fresh produce and all the other fabulous \"fixins\".", "author": "Javier O."}

We accidentally knocked over a fork, and he picked it up :)  Great to see him so hands on, and not hierarchical at all. \n\nUnfortunately, besides him, I was pretty unimpressed by Burger Bar.  I been there twice for lunch, once during the first month and again recently.  Both times was eh, blah.\n\nThe first time, the service was HORRIBLE.  They had sooo many people and just couldn't figure out how to staff and divide and conquer.  Let's not forget the hostesses (plural during lunch time) who had no idea what they were doing.  They obviously were getting paid hourly, and didn't have any incentive to make more money, greet people or be informed about what was going on.  The first time I went, they were so slammed  that the bartender ended up taking our order and serving us.  Btw - this was not his job, we were sitting at a table and didn't see a server for almost 20 minutes.  How he came about to serve us was we asked him if he could send our server over or if he's seen him/her and he actually couldn't find the person at all... go figure.       Btw - the bartender was a decent server and pretty pleasant considering the clusterfuck going on.\n\nOf course, it was the first month so I recently went back to try it again. Just as blah.  The place was much more empty, but the service was still kinda blah.  I'm not expecting the creme de la creme here, but I feel like in SF, there's a higher caliber than if we were in say, San Jose.  \n\nI'll probably won't initiate plans to eat here, but if in a big group I wouldn't object.", "author": "Laura H."}

With a beautiful view of Union Square, you can sit right up against the floor to ceiling windows, without the threat gale-force winds.\n\nAt my 5 star visit, a friend and I went right before the dinner rush on a weekday. We started with a french fry duo. The sweet potato and the skinny fries were good, but what made them great was the chipotle aioli. Yes, it was an extra 40cents for the side, but our attentive waiter let us know it was worth it. What wasn't worth it? Paying extra for not only sauce but fries. \n\nEntree time: my friend had a standard beef burger, and I opted for Salmon. Our server was very helpful and even gave me the choice of ordering my salmon burger \"med\". So, with a side salad, I tried the \"med\" cooked salmon and found it actually pretty amazing. If you're not a fan of cooked fish (aka, a big fan of sushi or tare tartare) this would be the seafood burger for you. It was seasoned well, and most importantly, not dry.\n\nTo end an overall great meal we went for the gusto and had the beer float sampler. Say it again: B E E R  F L O A T. Ice cream and beer. With 5 beerfloats to sample, we were elated. I'm not a big beer drinker, but of course curiosity got the best of me.  My favorite of all of them was the Raspberry Velvet. It was sweeter and the ice cream and berry beer seem to mesh better rather than the strawberry ice cream and pale ale float (that one had a sweet/savory thing going on. Still good though!) There was one float you should stay away from. I'm not sure about the name, but it was the only minty one. So when you get to one that tastes like mint, set that one aside, or cover it with a napkin. Do what you can to forget about it. \n\nThe 1-star visit? Let's just say\nHorrible service, even though it was dead in there: Monday night, hour before closing. I and a few friends did a round of beer floats that were late and practically thrown at us. \n\nVeggie burger was very tasty, but again, slow service with not a smile. but with more of an irritated grimace. \n\nDessert? Why not a burger again!? The Dessert burger had a krispy kreme-esque donut bun, nutella & chopped hazelnut \"patty\", strawberries, kiwi, and a mango jelly \"cheese slice\". All together, the components of this dessert were good. If you're a fan of dessert mash-ups, like ice cream sandwiches you'll like this. Some of my friends disagreed, and would have opted for just the nutella patty, making it a protein style dessert burger.   \n\nOverall:\nPros - Go at an earlier hour, where the servers are at a better disposition. Sit by the window, if there are no window seats, leave, or get really drunk off beer floats. Try the non-beef items, ironically, but no matter, what, try the beer floats.\n\nCons - Bring 40 extra cents if you want to make your fries stand out, and avoid the surly servers.", "author": "Veronica G."}

What makes them killer and adds to the cost are all the many, many toppings you can put on the burger.\n\nThe fancier burgers are definitely more expensive but judging from the plates I saw - might be worth it.

The most expensive burger is only so expensive because it has some foie gras and shaved truffles. They might as well throw some gold flakes on it because I think these are unnecessary garnishes. I do recommend getting the sauces as sides though. The peppercorn sauce was just lovely. It was not spiced at all, incredibly creamy and sweet. I think my favorite part of the burgers here is the bun. It's nicely shaped and a plump thickness. I was sad that my burger was served with only one slice of tomato and one leaf of lettuce. I had the american kobe beef burger, which was thick and juicy. The meat was tender, but crumbly. It was not packed too tightly, so it was nice and loose. I usually order my beef medium rare, but I didn't want to risk it for a burger so I decided to go safe with medium.

I really don't understand how Chef Hubert Keller is so popular, as I am always disappointed after eating at his restaurants (Burger Bar Vegas & SF, Fluer de Lys)- maybe it's his pleasant demeanor? Anyhow, come to Burger Bar if you must try it, but come with low expectations.", "author": "Amy D."}

I walked in and thought I was in the Cheesecake Factory, JR. They look very similar. \n\nI met a friend for lunch since I have so much down time now. I was expecting to be WOW'd. Instead, it was just an OK meal. I tried the Peppercorn Burger, medium rare, which was more medium - medium well. The patty resembled a hockey puck in shape and size. A little too perfect. I opted for the Fat Fries over the skinny fries, because I like them thick. The extra Pepper cream Sauce went great with the fries. \n\nMy friend had a Veggie Burger with Sweet Potato Fries, and reports that everything was very good, and wants to go back. I tried the Sweet Potato Fries and they were no better or worse than any other fry.  Both of us were sorry we didn't order a milk shake.  There was one that was brought to a table that may have been three different kinds in small glasses ... we both didn't see it on the menu, but will look for it or inquire next time.\n\nWe opted to have some wine with lunch ... why not? The selection seemed impressive, but we wanted to limit our consumption to just one glass. I wanted the Merlot but they were out, and chose something else. You won't have any trouble finding a bottle to your liking. \n\nFor dessert we had the Chocolate Donut \"Burger\" with the same hockey puck shape chocolate patty. It was interesting and good, and I may order it again. \n\nI want to go back after the holiday madness, provided I am still out of work!

The granite tabletops were so cold (I mostly mean this figuratively) and reminded me of my kitchen counter at home. I was also confused about why it took 10 minutes to seat us, even though the restaurant was only about 1/3 full. Moreover, we got seated all the way in the back of the restaurant, near the bathrooms. Never a good location! \n\nThe food was pricey. I know it's in Union Square, but really, the atmosphere they created for the restaurant did not lend itself to such an expensive menu. We ordered the sliders to split, which was $12.75. The sliders looked pretty, but were very small, dry, and not very flavorful. There was bacon in one, but the bacon was chewy and tasteless. The string fries were similarly tasteless. I really wish I had trekked to Taylor's instead. \n\nI'm not sure what Hubert Keller was thinking because this is not at all a San Francisco restaurant.

She was a bit afraid that downing a huge grease filled burger may add a few unwanted inches to her butt so she armed herself with her tight butt building walking shoes and hopped on Caltrain.

The reviews were not the best and my favorite burger place in the City is just hard to beat. \n\nThe place was packed and a little more ritzy than I expected.

It turns out the bartender is from Burlingame and opened up his burger playbook and helped us with our orders. He recommended that I try the basic Angus burger, which at under $10 was much less than I had expected to pay. My friend upgraded hers to the organic which was only like a dollar or two more. \n\nOur bartender suggested I get the sweet potato fries, which I must admit did not thrill me.

I was a little anxious because it was a) in Macys, which I hate going into for so many reasons, b) they don't take reservations (is it that hard to keep a reservation book?), and c) we were going to be there at 7:00 on a Saturday night during the holidays.  But the promise of good meat and milkshakes spurred me on in spite of it all.\n\nWhen we arrived we heeded a fellow yelper's advice to avoid the elevator...it takes forever and people really jam themselves in there!  So we scurried up the escalators without any problems.  We checked in and were told that the wait was 45 to 60 min.  So we wandered about the china and glassware department to make fun of the crap they sell at Macys...really, who buys a casarole dish with a lid shaped like a bunny?!?!  After a while we just loitered near the door and listened for our party of 6 to be called.  To our surprise, we were seated in about 30 minutes.  WOW!  Didn't see that coming.\n\nWe got a nice table right in front of the milkshake bar.  Our orders were taken promptly and our drinks came out before we knew it.  My caramel latte shake was fantastic.  Very smooth and creamy...not  a super thick consistency that requires vacuum suction to get up the straw.  My only complaint is that for an $8 shake, the portion could have been more generous.\n\nOur food came to us fairly quickly.  The food itself was good.  Not out of this world, but not bad either.  I mean, they're burgers!  I had the sliders and they were tasty, nicely presented and filling.  They came with skinny fries that were good, but I have had better.  My friends had a variety of burgers:  buffalo, angus, kobe.  Again, all very good.  One person thought her burger was a little over cooked, but the truffle sauce more than made up for it.  The sides were pretty good, too.  The sweet potato fries were great and so were the onion rings.  The fried zucchini were good and even better dipped in the aioli.  My friends reported that the fried pickles were a bit disappointing...I didn't try them myself because, well, they were fried pickles.  eeww.  \n\nI will definitely want to come back to try some other things on the menu.  The Peppercorn cream sauce was calling to me.  As was the Surf & Turf Burger (a burger with half a lobster on it...HALF A LOBSTER!!!)\n\nAs for price, yes, it's very spendy.  But when you go to a place like that, what do you expect?!  It's in Macy's for godssakes!  You're paying for the Hubert Keller name, the view and all the fluff.  But I think people have overlooked the fact that you are also paying for some quality ingredients that go into these burgers (even though they are just burgers).  Foie Gras and truffles ain't cheap (but they are oh, so good!).\n\nOur server was a very nice young woman who checked on us often and was not judging as we greedily slurped up our truffle sauce.  A small troop of servers helped her bring our food to us so it all hit the table at the same time:  one of my standards of excellent service.\n\nWill I go back to Burger Bar?  Yes (remember, half a lobster!).  Will I go there often, No.  It's a good place to go, but it's definitely a special occasion kind of thing.  I LOVE burgers and there lots of good places all over the Bay Area to get tasty \"everyday\"  burgers.

There is no doubt that Hubert Keller is both a culinary star and a good guy -- when I ate lunch at his new Burger Bar location on the 6th floor of Macy's, he was all smiles -- and despite being a celebrity chef, the man is still in the trenches, and that's admirable. \n\nThat said, the service from nearly everyone else was in shambles. The hostess was practically lifeless and didn't seem to know where she could seat us; we waited five minutes for water, five minutes to order drinks, and spent another 10-15 minutes trying to flag down someone, anyone, to check on our beers. Yes beers, and we were actually sitting in the bar and not even the dining area! Our waiter was overwhelmed by the lunch rush, but was doing his best, clearly put in a situation he didn't have control over. But when at least 5 other servers and busboys passed us without any help, despite our efforts at flagging them down, something was clearly off.\n\nThe menu is all about (guess what) burgers, with toppings galore, and there are even some of Fleur de Lys' famous sauces to choose from if you're feeling extra decadent. I tried the buffalo burger, which was a serious piece of beef (and should be at $17), and came out full of flavor and juice, sandwiched between a toasty sourdough bun. Sadly, the sweet potato fries were a disappointment, as they came out lukewarm, and the fried jalapeno pickles we had as a side were also underwhelming.\n\nSure, the place is brand new, but this is a high concept restaurant in a gastronomic city, filled with raving foodies that thrive on buzz. Still, Mr. Keller deserves his reputation, so I'll try and go back at some point... but I guess for now will let the savages and tourists have their go. The search for the perfect burger experience continues...", "author": "Nish N."}

Jokingly on the way up in the elevator I said \"wouldn't it be great if Hubert was there\".  Sure enough, we walk in and BAM.  We even took pictures with him and he was soooo sweet!  \n\nOK so yes, this review is biased because I met Hubert in person so now for the real review....\n\nThe food is good, really good. I got the buffalo burger and it was delicious.  Well seasoned, juicy and tender.  I got onion rings as well which were also very very good.  They have no BBQ so we got a side of ranch instead which was the good kind of ranch (you real ranch lovers out there know what I mean).\n\nAmbiance and service was also great.  We waited maybe 5 minutes for a table on a Friday night around 7:30 or so.  Beautiful views of Union Square.  And the service was very prompt.\n\nSo the only negative side of the whole place is the price.   It sure is pricey.  Mind you I did get a buffalo burger which is like a whopping $16 JUST for the burger alone but still, it's pricey.  With a beer each, 2 burgers, fries, and onion rings it ended up being like $70 with tax and tip.  Oh yeah, and we got the dessert donut.  My bf loved it but I would definitely pass.  Something about eating a dessert that looks like a burger psychologically doesn't stick well with me.\n\nAnyway, seeing Hubert really was one of the highlights of my life (seriously!!), and the food was great, but for the price, I probably won't be back unless someone else is paying.", "author": "Rachel S."}

So we ended up at Burger Bar - wait, correction... we ended up at Burger Bar after finding out there's at least a 2 hour wait time at the Cheesecake Factory (I know, not that much better...).\n\nThe wait time at the Burger Bar will almost always be better than the alternative (50 minutes versus 2 hours).  \n\nOnce you take the elevator upstairs, you immediately arrive at the Burger Bar - which is nice.  And the hostess is already there to write your name down.  Immediately after seeing this, I thought that it was a bit inefficient.  Granted, not all restaurants have the pager system that hand out, but I felt that with the long list that they have - they should seriously consider in implementing it.  This way, their hallway will not be crowded with guests waiting for their names to be called.  Moreover, that they don't butcher people's name when they call them out. Also, since it's inside Macy's people will be able to move around and shop to their heart's content and not have to return every 5 minutes to ask if they've been called yet or what their status on their list is (which I've done 3 times and another person has done... even more frequently than myself).\n\nMoving on, once called the waitress shows you to your table and the place is crowded with not much room to move around (my mom is legally blind and it was a bit of a challenge to help move her around all the standing people, waiters, and chairs in the way).  I felt that this place needs more space or a better controlled environment.\n\nOnce seated, it took a long time before the waters were handed out (it would have been nice to have straws to accompany the water, but I suppose you have to request for them around here).  \n\nIt took even longer before our waiter (it changed from the waitress that we initially had, I wonder where she went...) came to take our order.\n\nThe prices on the menu is a bit higher than I anticipated, but considering that this is a tourist area and inside Macy's it shouldn't be too surprising.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nKobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries (19.85)\nBurger Sliders with Skinny Fries (12.75)\nKobe Burger with Pepper Jack (17.45)\nCaramel Latte Shake (8.75)\nBlack & White Milkshake (8.75)\nLarge Pellegrino (8)\n\nIn short, I repeat that a lot of things on this list is too overpriced (note the milkshake, the latte, and the sparkling water.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the milkshake is almost worth it.  The sweet potato fries is recommended, but the kobe burger is a bit bland for my taste.  It needs more seasoning or something but it was still decent.\n\nIn short, this place needs a vast improvement in terms of service and the way the position the tables and handling crowd control.  The food is decent, but needs more work.  A part of me wonders if the food would taste better if their cooks had more time to prepare them.", "author": "Nina M."}

My guests arrive at 8 pm. and were seated. I arrive around 8:30 p.m. and the restaurant is empty! Our party was the only one occupying tables.

It's more fun to build your burger than ordering the Burger Bar concoctions. The skinny fries are good, the fried zucchini and onion rings had too much batter. The milkshakes are my favorite!

Once for just a milkshake and again for a burger and a shake. \n\nThe shakes were excellent both times -- especially the \"Nutella\" shake which is made with chocolate ice cream, Nutella, chocolate sauce and chocolate whipped cream. When I went back for lunch I ordered the Rossini burger. Made with American Kobe beef (which they falsely describe on the menu as the \"most expensive\" beef in the world), seared fois gras and shaved black truffles. It goes for a whopping $60. At this price I would expect an amazing burger, especially given the fact that you can get amazing burgers in SF for $15 at quite a few places. This burger was nothing close to amazing. I ordered it medium rare and it was overcooked. My friend's Rossini burger was also overcooked so it definitely wasn't a one-off mistake. It didn't melt in my mouth... it wasn't even that flavorful. Not even close to the best burger I've had.\n\nThe ambiance also leaves a lot to be desired.

And while Burger Bar may not have *the* best burgers in town, i was certainly happy with what i had.  My 4-star rating is mostly due to their extensive menu.\n\nRight off the bat, im a little blown away by their long list of beer offerings.  I wasnt expecting that at all.  All listed, separated nicely, in categories.  I love me some organization.  First time i came here, i had the Hitachino (how many burger places do you know that serve this?!) second time, i think i had the house ale.  Either way, both were good and i was pleased.\n\nI went simple with my meal and had the kobe burger and skinny fries.  Everything was really good, my burger was nice and moist and my fries were perfectly crispy.  The extra add-ons and sides are endless, the list of things left me speechless.  You can add just about anything on your burger.  I was tempted to add lobster, but that not only would have made me a fatass, but would have been way too indulgent.  Next time.\n\nDessert was just as delicious.  I, again, kept it simple, and had a strawberry chocolate sundae.  But i was very intrigued that they had beer floats.  Yes, boys & girls, BEER. FLOATS.  Ive never had one, never even seen one, but it looked absolutely mouth watering.  \n\nOverall, i was surprisingly pleased with Burger Bar.  The extensive menu really bumps this place up.  Our waiter was not only sickeningly cheery, he was a total rockstar - on top of everything.  Sure, its a tad overpriced for a burger, but wtf, are you really going to eat here everyday?

And whenever I hear of a high end chef doing burgers, I get really excited (think Danny Meyer's Shake Shack or Jean-George's ABC Kitchen burger).\n\nHowever, Hubert (or \"Bert\", as I like to call him), didn't really cut it.  The restaurant was just a shameless example of tacking on a celebrity chef's name to a restaurant without running the restaurant to the standards one might think such a chef would expect.\n\nThe burger wasn't bad at all.  It was just OK, and certainly not worth the price (many of the burgers are over $20, which is unwarranted given the taste and experience).  But what gets me is the tacky scene of the place.  I suspect it's a partnership with Macy's (it's on the 6th floor of the store) and Macy's had more input than Bert.  It felt like an Applebee's/Chili's crossover.  Not that there's anything wrong with those places.  My recommendation would be to hit this place up when you're just out with the boys and want to grab a beer and a burger.

And the fries, all 15 of them on a sad plate, were equally bland and flavorless.   After reading about this place all over Urban Daddy and 7X7, etc. I was excited.  Man, what a let down!!!\n\nTwo of us came here for dinner, 6pm, no wait.  I got the Angus Burger with cheddar, caramelized onions and a side of skinny fries.  Friend got the country burger, both medium.  We were in consensus regarding this review.  First, while the meat was juicy, there was surprisingly no flavor. It was as if the chef had no salt or anything.  Same wth the fries, which, as other reviewers noted, were paltry.  Tiny portion of fries, all laid flat on a side plate. Who are they kidding?!  Also, the beef was way too small for the bun.  Also, one burger was actually RARE so we sent it back. (Friend has stomache ache now). Come on Burger Bar, cook the meat properly!\n\nThis wasn't even an \"ok\" burger. It was *completely forgettable.*  I neatly cut my burger in half, intending to take half home for a tasty snack.

It's not that pricey for a regular burger, but...the food, ambiance, service, it all SUCKS BALLZ.  This place makes Cheesecake Factory seem like a five star restaurant. Ugh.

We showed up around 1 on a Sunday, and there was the Nike Women's marathon and everything going on so the wait was understandable. Plus this was the 3rd day it was open so everyone would be eager to try it. \n\nSo after we were seated, the waitress came and took our order. I had the Kobe Beef burger, with caramelized onions and portabello mushrooms on an onion bun. When it finally came, it was beautiful. I can't put into words how excited I was. I took a bite, and it just was heavenly. The burger was nicely rested, so the juices were in the burger instead of the bun or the plate. It had a great flavor, like almost having a King cut from House of Prime Rib, in burger form. Very fresh beef. And being that it was Kobe beef, it melted as soon as it reached the palette. The combination of that, with the Earthiness of the mushroom and the sweetness of the onions was just edible nirvana. There were condiments such as tabasco, ketchup, A1 steak sauce, and mustard available at the table, but believe me, those aren't needed. Those will just mask the true flavors of the burger. \n\nShe had an angus burger, with baby spinach, and portobello as well. I kind of preferred the angus over the kobe. The angus was more of a burger-burger. It was meaty and it had incredible meaty texture and flavor. I honestly have never had a burger that good. (Sorry Darla's but you've been dethroned). What kicked the most was the aioli. It comes separate, and costs an additional $.45, but it's worth it. It gives the burger such a great kick. Plus it's great to dip the sweet potato fries in. \n\nWhich brings me to the fries. I can kinda do without them. At $3.35 or so a plate, it was a pretty pathetic portion. Granted, one shouldn't eat too many sweet potatoes in general unless they're asking to become a foul smelling musical instrument for the next few hours, but hey seriously, why skimp out on the fries? It was almost a half portion it seemed to me, coming on a white plate with lots of gaps and holes, the presentation was just awful. \n\nAside from that, the experience was great. Service was a bit slow, but I'm forgiving since they just opened. Hubert Keller was walking around, greeting people and giving out mini milkshakes...which I noticed that he gave them mainly to parties of all women. I didn't get one =[.

So why the five star review? Because we met, chatted and had our picture taken with none other than Hubert Keller himself. Does it negate the above mentioned flaws? No. But it does make for a foodie fan moment. \n\nInstead of going whole hog and scarfing down the $60 kobe beef, foie gras and truffle laden burger, I decided to take it down a notch or two and built my own burger, starting with the country natural grass fed beef, then chose the house-made pickled beets, grilled onions and yes, I paid extra for what the menu said was homemade dijon mustard. The burger was really amazing, as far as burgers go. I'm no beef aficionado, but I have to say, the beef was so flavorful on its own with no seasoning and it was served perfectly pink, just as I requested, which doesn't seem to happen a lot of times.  \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't save room for what sounded like a dreamy way to end a nice meal; a Nutella milkshake. I can't even begin to describe what a Nutella fanatic I am and to see that on the dessert menu nearly sent me over the edge. However, after a couple of drinks, a burger, sweet potato fries and a conversation with Hubert, I really couldn't fathom how I was going to enjoy that shake.

The new Burger Bar in SF? Not so swanky, set above Macy's with good burgers, ok fries and fantastic (expensive) milkshakes.\n\nWe split the American Classic (hello, bacon cheeseburger!) and the Peppercorn Burger. The American Classic was, well, classic - cooked a perfect medium rare with melted cheese and bacon. I enjoyed the Peppercorn Burger a bit less - the whole peppercorns were a bit much for me. The meat for both burgers was tender and fell apart with each bite (in a good way) \n\nI wasn't a big fan of the fries. They were skinny and crispy but for some reason felt fake to me, like they were cooked hours before and just dropped back in the oil for us. The milkshake on the other hand was fantastic, as it should be at almost $9!\n\nThe overall ambiance reminded me of a slightly upscale Johnny Rocket's and felt very chainy. With such an amazing space I was hoping to be transported to this burger paradise but ended up feeling like I was in the nicest chain restaurant somewhere in the midwest. And our server was either clueless or ambivalent, not quite sure which.\n\nThree stars for the combination of good food, expensive prices and the generic shopping mall like atmosphere.

I'd heard from my sister, whose opinion and taste in food is much like my own, that it was a decent place, though certainly not worth the price of entry.  Her main gripe being that for as much as they charge, they should be able to properly prepare a burger.  \n\nI was hungry, I was in the area, I was curious.  So I ordered the Hubert Keller burger: buffalo meat with blue cheese, caramelized onions, and baby spinach served on ciabatta with a reduction of something on the side.  The fact that I can't remember what it was should tell you it was not memorable.  I ordered my burger medium rare, as always do, and the server seemed very happy about my preferred done-ness.  \n\nWhen it came, it appeared to be perfectly done, as there were obvious signs of red juice on the bottom half of the bun and the outside of the patty had a handsome sear.  But, as I was warned by my sister, the burger was severely over cooked.  There was hardly a shade of pink anywhere to be found in the meat; it was medium-well at best.  I'll grant that I really prefer a really rare steak, but medium rare is the standard doneness for steaks and only slightly less the norm for burgers.  I've had buffalo several times before, both in burger and steak form, the latter being one of my favorite things to cook, so I know what to expect.  It's kind of a delicate meat that requires attentive care during preparation that this piece was not afforded. The flavors were okay, but were obviously marred by being woefully over cooked.  \n\nHad this been a less expensive burger without the staff touting about how wonderful everything was going to be, and the care they take, I would not feel the need to be as critical.  But given the intended dining experience, the fact that they served a horribly improperly cooked burger is very disappointing.", "author": "Lewis M."}

I have to say that my burger was delicious; angus burger with cheddar, fried egg and caramelized onions. We also ordered the fried pickles and sweet potato fries, both were tastey as well. Unfortunately our service was so atrocious that I can't remember the last time I had that bad of service, it has probably been years, YEARS.\n\nOur experience:\n\n15 minute wait in the afternoon on a Saturday, not too bad. Looking good so far. We get seated and know what we want, so when our waitress comes with the water we are ready! We order our food and a float of the 6 beer shakes for dessert. That is to come at the end of the meal though, after our food. \nThere was a problem with one of the glasses on the table, so it was removed and replaced promptly. Handled slightly strange by the waitress, almost like her reaction was, \"I didn't do that!\" No shit sherlock, but a new glass would be lovely, thank you.\nFood comes and one of our burgers is wrong. They whisk it away and apologize, no worries guys-these things happen. The waitress comes over to double check the wrong order, apparently that was the problem, she wrote it down wrong. While she did not admit that, it was obvious by her approach and questioning of the order. No apology was really made, just that it wouldn't be long. OK. About 10-15 minutes later it finally arrives, cooked wrong but consumed none the less. We are now in the better part of an hour of waiting for food, we are both starving and don't want to wait for another 20 minutes to be cooked correctly, it was too rare.\nDuring the consuming of said burgers we never get a check up to see how things are, I feel avoided. :(\nOnce we are about 90% done with our burgers she comes along and asks if we still want the shake float, yes we do. She says she will put in the order and leaves.\nAbout 10 minutes later the manager comes by to check on our experience. Bad move buddy, bad move. Walked into that one! Our convo:\n\n\"How is everything ladies?\"\n\"OK\"\n\"Just OK\"\nWe eyeball each other and smirk a bit, \"yeah, it was not fabulous\"\n\"Uh, oh, what happened ladies?\"\nSo we tell him everything; the burger, the glass, the horrible sub-par service, the MIA shakes, the plates still on the table, all of it. He ripped the lid off the can of worms.\nHe apologizes, tells my friend (Chelsea B) that her burger will be comped and he will check on the shakes immediately. At this point it is almost 2 hours at the table and while we are in good spirits, it really has been a bad experience. He comes back to us and lets us know that the shakes are not yet made because more information is needed. We just say cancel the shakes, bring the check we are done.\nStupid waitress girl brings the check and tries to walk by our table 3 times before I have to flag her down to pick up the obviously ready bill to pay that has the credit card laying out in the open on the receipt. \n\nShe should not be a waitress in such a quick moving environment, if not for her, our experience would have been substantially better than it was. She continued to amaze me with how bad she really was. By the end of the meal, I was shocked she could get worse than we had already experienced.

I did not expect a Fleur-de-Lys experience at Burger Bar SF in terms of service or atmosphere.  If I wanted a fancy Hubert Keller experience I would have booked a table at Fleur de Lys but that's for another time.\n\nI went back to Burger Bar SF and had the much-discussed Rossini burger.  Yes, it comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, and shaved truffles.  Yes, it is $60.  More than anything  I loved the concept of pushing the limits of flavor profiles of burgers. \n\nThe Rossini burger came out on a big plate with a side of  au jus, sea salt, black pepper, and skinny fries.  The truffle aroma was instantly released when I poured what I assumed was a truffle au jus.  I love that earthy smell.  Foie gras  added decadent richness, and the Kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium doneness and had more of a \"chopped\" texture than the average ground meat texture and it tasted fantastic.   \n\nWas it better than the sum of its parts?  This is what made me think about this experience for two days and a visit to another one of my favorite burger places over the weekend, to mull it over.  In the end I felt  that the three kings of flavors were competing for attention and they did not necessarily come together as well as I had hoped.  \n\nBecause it is a burger I have to put the meat first.  And I realized they had to go with Kobe beef for it to stand against the truffle and foie gras.  The truffle and au jus were great flavor enhancers for the meat, but that left the poor foie gras out in the cold.  I like the classic pairing of foie gras with something sweet and fruity to offset its richness, but in this case the contrast was lacking.  Structurally it fell a little short, too,  because while the onion bun was a good choice for this ensemble, I don't think it was toasted, and it became soggy after the  au jus.  I ate my burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nNonetheless, I was happy with the experience.  Why?  Because it made me think for TWO whole days!  \n\nIncidentally you could get the truffle as a side with their other burgers at $30.  they have some interesting alcoholic and nonalcoholic milk shake options in addition to other beverage options.  I also had a dessert chocolate burger in which chocolate mousse serves as a 'meat' in a donut pastry 'bun'.  Cute. \n\nI am still a fan.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-22", "description": "I wanted to love Burger Bar. Burger Bar had all of the right ingredients to be a huge success, yet managed to come up short. Opened by one of San Francisco's most renowned chefs and Fleur de Lys proprietor, Hubert Keller I couldn't wait to try Burger Bar. Add in that it is located in a prime location in Macy's at Union Square, has a full bar and is a restaurant dedicated to burgers, I was excited to try to this new bastion for burger lovers. \n\nI need to preface this review that I ate at this restaurant at a late time and so it could have just been an off night. I plan on going back and will update this review. But for now, here are my thoughts. \n\nLet me break down the Burger Bar experience. \n\n(1) Burger ---- I ordered the black angus beef burger, medium with jack cheese. I expected to bite into a juicy, tender piece of meat that would be oozing with flavor. Instead, I got a burger that was overcooked, crumbly and noticeably lacking in flavor. I could tell that they used good quality meat, but the lack of flavor failed to excite my senses. \n\nIf Burger Bar wants to improve their ratings, this is the area where they can improve the most. When people walk into a Huber restaurant, they expect something different and exciting. Instead, it was more of the same. Yes, you can add foie gras for $30, but who wants to pay that for a topping? \n\nBottom line in this area (1) add some more flavor to the patties, (2) do something different and more exciting for a reasonable price and (3) be sure not to overcook the burgers. \n\n(2) Bun ----  I had the wheat bun and was impressed. The bun was tasty, healthy, fluffy and exactly what I look for in a hamburger bun. Not very many burger joints offer wheat buns and those that do usually mess it up. I thought they did a great job in this area. \n\n(3) Garnish ----- The burger came with onions and a pickle as garnish. I thought they did a good job here and I don't have much to add in this area. \n\n(4) Sweet Potato Fries  ------ We ordered a side of sweet potato fries and found fries to be cold and over-salted. It could have been because I came here late, but this was a disappointment. \n\n(5) Drinks -----  I was impressed with their range of drinks and beer on tap. They also carry Lotus vodka, which is a favorite of mine and not too many places carry it. Good marks on this point. \n\n(6) Atmosphere ----  I thought it was a little too much like cheese cake factory and not quite unique enough. I wanted something a little more Huber-esqe in the feel, something a little more San Francisco and different. Although I recognize that they probably had a lot of design limitations given that they were in Macy's and were probably instructed to mimic the Cheesecake Factory formula. It was just a little too similar to Cheesecake for my taste. \n\n(7) The Hubert Factor ---- So, perhaps the most redeeming part of the experience (and why this restaurant gets three stars) is that I got to meet Hubert after dinner. He was at the bar and was chatting with diners. As a huge food network fan and as someone who admires Hubert, it was fun to meet him in person.

I agree with the rest of the reviews; it's touristy and not cheap, but the window seat overlooking Union Square is great.  Good people watching while you wait for your 20 dollar burger.  I started with the cucumber cooler?  Or something.  It had a cucumber in it.  And it was pretty good.  It wasn't good enough to make me enjoy the Oscars, though, or all the red lipstick on pasty white celebrities I saw.  (Except Sarah Jessica Horseface, she looked like a piece of bacon.)  \n\nAnyways, speaking of bacon, you can get it on your burgers if you choose....  I chose Kobe beef and added pepperjack and guacamole.  And that brought my total near 25 dollars for one burger.  But it was good.  I would actually strongly suggest the Buffalo - my hot date got that and we ended up splitting the two...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-21", "description": "Hubert Keller. In person. Live @ the Burger Bar last night! He's wonderful, talented, and really, everything that a celebrity chef should be. At random points of the night, he would appear suddenly from the kitchen, all smiles, greeting various guest and even personally serving his signature milkshakes. Definitely enhanced the dining experience to see such a revered chef being so personable & present. And...that's pretty much the only 100% satisfactory thing about my experience at Burger Bar.\n\nI had no problems with the hostess, as other yelpers had mentioned. She seated us within the time quoted, but the seats were HORRIBLE. Although there were other 2-seater tables open in various parts of the restaurant, we were seated behind a wall. Bless her heart, she sold it to us like it was a great seat - you get a window!-but she didn't mention that there was a solid wall blocking our view of the restaurant (and most importantly, the view of our server from seeing our needs for refills and such). The table was also squeezed between the smallest of spaces (i couldn't even hold my arm out).  It was very uncomfortable & claustrophobic. \n\nOur server seemed a bit frazzled. Seems a bit understaffed here. Most of the time, she was nowhere to be seen. She seemed to have little experience and because everyone was probably just as frazzled, she had no help. Hopefully this is something that'll get better and not worse.\n\nMy friend & I ordered:\n\n-Kobe Beef w/ Bacon\n-Veggie Burger w/ Shiitake Mushrooms\n-Skinny Fries\n-Soda & Iced Tea \n\nThe burgers came with lettuce, tomato, and onion...but let me tell you, it was the saddest thing ever. The lettuce was about 1/2 the size of a regular piece. Maybe it was for presentation purposes, but really? they could only spare 1/2 piece of lettuce? Disappointing toppings aside, the burgers were both good. The veggie was especially soft (might be too soft for some) and had a nice flavor that hinted at the pumpkin puree. Neither, however, were mind-blowing. The fries were tasty..similar to the kind they have at McDonald's, except without as much preservatives or a documentary spotlight.\n\nThe Drinks deserve their own paragraph. The pepsi was completely flat. Completely. The iced tea tasted watered down. It was shocking to say the least. For a newly opened restaurant, I can give them slack for not getting their service in order or maybe even for a kitchen that is not at its full potential, but getting Pepsi and iced tea wrong? That's inexcusable. They cost about $3.50/ea, by the way.\n\nOur bill came to about $50. For what we had/experienced, it was pretty damn overpriced. The burgers get 1 star each. Hubert gets one star for being Hubert, whom I still love with all my heart despite my unhappiness with the meal. I really hope this restaurant does well because he deserves that, but until things turn around, I don't think I'll be contributing to the Burger Bar Fund again.", "author": "Rona J."}

At first I thought what the heck is this?... and my friend started raving about how good buffalo burgers were.  Being skeptical I couldn't see myself ordering a whole buffalo burger.\n\nSo I ordered the slider sampler.  It was three burgers all different meats.  One of which was buffalo.  When our orders arrived, the food smelled and looked so delicious.  I randomly chose my first burger and bit into it.  OMG, this burger was freaking awesome!! Moist, tender, full of yummy goodness...  I wish I had ordered a whole one of whatever it was.  After eating the next one, it didn't nearly compare with the first.  When the waitress passed by I asked her to ID the sliders.  Undeniably, it was the buffalo I had fallen for.\n\nWill I go back to this place? I sure hope so.

Otherwise, I can see no reason to return. \n\nThe \"ambiance\" consisted of grease-smeared tables, spacey teen-aged waitresses, and dirty bathrooms. The menu is a chaotic mess using no fewer than three different ugly fonts; it looks cheap, like the design I used to do for my company newsletter in Adobe PageMaker circa 1998. \n\nThis is the kind of place that makes me pity tourists from Ohio who stumble in, thinking they will get an authentic San Francisco food experience from the renowned chef Hubert Keller. They will leave feeling ripped off (as they should) and vaguely nauseated. I live in SF and expect to pay more for everything; however, I also expect the quality to be commensurate with the price. \n\nWe had the Hubert Keller burger (spinach, blue cheese, and buffalo on a ciabatta bun). The untoasted bun was dry and the burger was half its size. The cheese was good, the spinach completely untaste-able. It came with a side of decent \"skinny fries.\" Price: $22. Seriously.\n\nWe also had the kobe burger with a slice of foie gras. This was ok, if the meat a bit mushy in texture.  Again the bun (plain this time) was dry and untoasted, and melted into a greasy mass under the burger before I even picked it up. Only the awesome power of foie gras redeemed the dish. The onion rings, while passable, were over-coated with breading and had little or no onion flavor. We were charged $1.50 for the ranch dressing. This was not mentioned on the menu nor by the waitress. \n\nThe beer selection is very impressive. I enjoyed the Imperial Oktoberfest on draft and my husband liked his Three Philosophers. \n\nThe service was amateurish but friendly. \n\nI wanted to like this place, so much. I had hoped to take my husband to Fleur de Lys for a special dinner in the near future, but after this disastrous meal, I will not be giving Keller another penny of my money.

The three complementary sauces that are worth a try include mayo, pesto, and a thousand island like dressing.  My favorite burgers are the Hubert Keller burger, which was served on Top Chef Masters with roquefort blue cheese, and the American Kobe beef burger with oyster mushrooms and truffle sauce.

After I was done, I ate the pieces of Kobe beef that had fallen off the burger and that was a nearly life changing experience.  The beef was some of the best beef I have ever had.

Prices are pretty high here of course, you can easily spend $20-25 a person between food and drink.\n\nService has been attentive, but one thing that was kind of stupid was this:  I wanted to try the surf-and-turf burger (you know, the one that comes with lobster on it) but instead of skinny fries I wanted to substitute sweet potato fries.  They said that's not an option.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries are the same price on the menu, so I can't really fathom any reason that they wouldn't let you do the substitution.  So instead of ordering the $24 surf-and-turf, I got a $9 turkey burger (and added oyster mushrooms, cheese and avocado).\n\nStill, the food is damn good so I recommend trying it at least once.  Between this and Pearl's, there are great burgers to be had in the area.", "author": "Joseph N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-21", "description": "I like burgers.  When I heard there was a fancy burger bar that recently opened in town, I had to check it out.  I've seen Hubert Keller perform on Top Chef Masters and boy was I impressed.  While I haven't had the privilege of eating at Fleur de Lys, I can imagine it is wonderful.  I figured this may be a chance to try something more recession friendly.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, it seemed like a casual place, so I marched over to Macy's and rode the elevator up to the sky.  This restaurant is interesting because it is literally In Macy's.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the lighting was excessively bright.  The easiest way to make a restaurant classier is to dim the lights.  What you can't see won't hurt you.  And everyone has heard the expression, everyone looks good in the dark.  On a side note, ladies, always go on a first date in a dimly lit restaurant because you will look hot.  As I was thinking this, they did dim the lights, which they probably do at the start of evening.  \n\nI sat at the bar where it was easy to find a seat, but hard to find service.  The two bartenders were about twelve years old and both ignored me.  I had to find an abandoned menu from some previous patrons and ask for service every time I wanted to order something.\n\nThe menu is a la carte with a few predetermined burgers on the other side of the menu.  However, if you order from the fixed menu there is a strict 'no substitutions' policy, which seems a bit ridiculous.  I also noticed some sweet burgers for dessert, like a chocolate burger.\n\nI ordered an a la carte burger, which nearly resembled the Classic burger, with a few changes.  It took a while to order a drink after that because I was getting no service.  I did hear that they were short staffed one bartender, but the two that were there did not seem very skilled.  Watching them tap a few beers was embarrassing.  I have never seen anyone pour so much head on multiple beers and then serve them to guests.\n\nWhen my burger did arrive, it was short my order of sweet potato fries.  I reminded the bartender that I had ordered them, and he had neglected to put this order in.  I tried to eat my burger slowly while I waited for the fries, but as my burger turned cold, I reminded a server about my fries and he brought some for me.\n\nThe burger itself was middle of the road.  I ordered it medium, but it was about medium well, which is okay with me.  The burger was the perfect size, not too big, not too small, with a thick pattie.  However, I found the meat crumbly, rather than juicy.  The bread was nice and the condiments satisfactory.  I love sweet potato fries, so they were probably the best part of the meal.  The selection of beers is very extensive, another highlight.\n\nThis seems like a nice place to eat while downtown, and I would come back to try some other burgers, but the service begs improvement.  I am surprised to hear that Hubert Keller is on site running this ship, because it feels more like a Cheesecake Factory or another chain.  At one point during my meal, the previously dimmed lights had a minor 'malfunction' and came back on, to everyone's surprise.  It was one of those aha moments, perhaps indicative of the service and inconsistency.  I hope H irons out the kinks here and gives the Cheesecake Factory a run for their money.", "author": "apple r."}

But I do not love Burger Bar.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at Christmas shopping, my friend and I decided to have a late lunch/early dinner here. Because of the odd hour, we were seated immediately. We started with sweet potato fries and the fried jalapeno pickles. Both were a let down: the fries were sad and overcooked; the jalapeno pickles were heavily battered and cut in spears and tasted like boring pickles and had no jalapeno flavor. \n\nMy friend debated ordering the $65 burger and then the $23 surf and turf burger. He then debated ordering a burger a la carte with a half lobster on top. He finally settled on the country natural beef patty, seared foie gras, swiss cheese, carmelized onions, and oyster mushrooms on an onion bun. \n\nI ordered the country natural beef patty with jack cheese, and a fried egg on ciabatta bun. We also decided to try the truffle sauce, which was not as good as we hoped. The flavor did not match our burgers but that was our mistake for getting overly ambitious. \n\nWhile decent, the burgers were not impressive for the price. The quality was good and the flavors were fine but not phenomenal. The burges were also very difficult to eat. We finally gave up trying to eat with our hands and busted out forks and knives. While the idea of so many interesting and fancy toppings is great in theory, attempting to eat such a thick and messy burger prevented me from getting bites containing all the components of the burger. \n\nThe a la carte menu is great in theory, except that the price of one burger really adds up the more ingredients one adds. There are so many great burgers in SF that are a fraction of a cost of a fully loaded burger here. All in all, I am glad I tried this place but I have definitely had tastier, less expensive burgers in town.", "author": "Jenny K."}

It took them 15 or 20 minutes to seat us in a restaurant that was less than half full, and when they finally did, they gave us a bad table in the back, walking past all sorts of better, empty tables to get there.  They kept apologizing for keeping us waiting.  However, once we got our server, things were okay as he was much more competent than the hostesses.\n\nSince it is inside a department store on Union Square, anyone could predict that it's overpriced, but I loled when I saw that Chimay Grande Reserve goes for $36 here (it retails for $9-$11 in stores).  Also, if I remember correctly, they have PBR on tap for $5.  So the beer list is decent, though things of PBR quality and things of Chimay quality are given approximately equal representation, but plan to overpay in spades, particularly if you want to get a good/somewhat unusual beer.

I was enthused when I discovered that Hubert Keller was bringing this place to SF, telling everyone I knew the week it was opening. \n\nFast forward to last Friday, a week after their official opening. We arrive at around 9:30p and are promptly seated. My first impressions was that this place had a feel of an Applebees or a TGI Fridays (you know trying to be something bigger than it actually is). Upon sitting down at the table, I discover that the table is a little sticky and greasy. More people we know ended up joining us so we switched tables. STRIKE ONE - Dirty Table.\n\nAlso, the first waiter we had seemed like he was a bit in a hurry. We sat down, he comes over and we politely say give us a second as we hadn't even opened our menus. No more than 45 seconds later, menus still closed and still getting situated, he comes back and says, \"Are you guys ready now?\" But, then we switched tables so not a deal, just kind of annoying though. \n\nSo I go to order my beer; it's true that Burger Bar has a huge beer menu... IF ONLY THEIR SERVERS KNEW WHAT THEY SERVED. I order a Goose Island Bourbon Stout, to which the waitress then said, \"I don't think we have that.\" As I look back over the menu, I seriously thought I was loosing my mind because it wasn't there. I quickly grab another menu and discover that there are two menus, one with more beers than the other. I point to my selection and they DID have it. STRIKE TWO - Not knowing your beer list, not knowing you had  two beer menus (admitted to me as a new and old menu), and not updating the two menus. \n\nWe got our food. The food was pretty good, I mean it's a burger joint. But it wasn't the epicurean revelation that I hoped it would be. Additionally, someone at our table ordered the fried jalape\u00f1o pickles. When ordering them he asked if these were whole jalape\u00f1os that were pickled or if they were pickles brined with jalape\u00f1o spice. The waitress had no idea how to respond and stalled a bit. My friend slowly asked, to make the distinction clear, \"Are they fried jalape\u00f1os or pickles?\" She looks back at him, with that, I hope I get this right look and says, \"Jalape\u00f1os.\" The end up being the pickles. STRIKE THREE - Know your menu! \n\nTraining, training, training... the service here makes what would have been a decent experience into a mediocre one at best. And for that price, I could probably get better service at the afore mentioned food chains (though I haven't been to either of them in at least 7 years). \n \nBottomline, if your stuck in Union Square and you want a burger, save your money and go to the food court in SF Center because I'm sure there's something better there. If you want the best burger in SF with no BS, go to Chez Maman and make sure you get the egg topper.\n\nMonsieur Keller, I think you're better than what was portrayed to my visit to Burger Bar SF. I really wanted to like this place... check that I really wanted to LOVE this place. I'm sure there are people like me who were/are excited to have a Hubert Keller experience that would motivate me to finally make that reservation at Fleur De Lys, that I've been stalling on.

One of my friends ordered a stout beer (they have a great beer selection) and the bartender simply poured the beer straight into the glass with no tilt and with the glass about 6 inches below the tap. As expected, all head. He did this again and we all looked with shock. SHOCK! The experienced bartender looked at us, then looked at you know who, put down his beer and said, \"Let me show you how to pour a stout (or any beer).\" Parenthesis were in my head.\n\nNow we waited 45 minutes for a group of 5, though they said it was going to take an hour and a half. Take that as a good thing or a bad one, your choice. I ordered the Angus Beef cooked medium, with jalapeno bacon, peppered jack cheese, and truffle sauce.

High school cafeterias do a better job with presentation.

The veggie burger, though somewhat cripy on the outside quickly took on the form of a not-quite-warm-enough squash mash on a bun.  The beef was juicy and cooked to the right temperature, but not served hot and overpriced for what it was.  The fries were also a huge disappointment: round white salad plates with a smattering of dehydrated sweet potatoes, and completely mundane fried (frozen?) potatoes.\n\nIf you're going to call yourself burger bar, you may want to concern yourself with getting the burger and fries bit down before you go offering to top it off with foie gras or half a lobster.\n\nI wanted to tell myself that Hubert Keller wasn't aware of what was going on.

I was tempted, but the life of a starving student precludes such lavish indulgences.  So I opted for the $16 dollar American Kobe Beef Burger instead.  HA!  There are a lot of add-ons such as a variety of cheeses, mushrooms, foie gras ($12), truffles ($30), among many other things.  You can basically customize everything, even the bun.  I opted for swiss cheese, portobello mushrooms, and black Perigord truffle sauce (no not $30, this one was only $5.50) on a sesame bun.  My medium rare \"kobe\" burger was good, but I'm not sure if I feel that comfortable paying more than $10 for ground beef between two buns.  \n\nThe night had a lot of bumps (slow service, 3 mixed up orders), but they comped us on a few things so it wasn't too bad.  It was also my friend's birthday (perhaps the first bday Burger Bar SF has had?) so we brought a cake and they kindly accommodated us.  Chef Keller even brought out a 6-shake treat for my friend.  He went around chatting it up with all the tables and making sure everyone enjoyed their meals.  That was pretty cool seeing him after watching Top Chef Masters.  I hope that the same hiccups do not continue past a few weeks.  \n\nPLUSES: Nice View; Customizable Burgers; Huge Beer Selection; Made an effort to fix mistakes.  \n\nMINUSES: Service is a bit shakey (our server was very nice though); In the end... its still just a burger.", "author": "Bert N."}

We actually had friends from out of town, and they kindly saved us a seat while we made the Trek from the East Bay to S.F. on a busy Friday night. We were obviously late, but the server (Chris), was warm and welcoming. He offered us Drinks and brought us up to speed with the Menu. We started with the Minty Chocolate shake, and our friend ordered the Irish Milkshake. I also ordered Onion Rings. Both of the Shakes were Luscious and the Onion Rings were very crispy and very good. I did not taste the Alcohol in our Mint Shake, but the Irish Cream was very potent. We were taking our time with the Menu, but decided on Sliders for the Wifey, Peppercorn for Moi, and a Black Jack for one of my friends. My other friends ordered a Burger to split. We were so engaged with the conversation, that we did not realize that our Burgers came out. The Peppercorn came out perfectly cooked and the Sweet potato Fries were very good. My wifey loved the Sliders and that says a lot since she only eats In & Out and does not eat Beef. The Sliders come in 3 different Varieties Bacon with Apple wood Bacon, Buffalo Burger, and the Angus. My other friend had the Black Jack and said it was okay. The Black Jack has Black olives and Monterey Jack. We ended the meal with a nightcap. We ordered a Cappuccino, Coffee, and my friend ordered a London Cloud. A London Cloud is a Beer Float. Irish Stout with a scoop of Ice cream. I saw that she liked it, but I was happy with the Cappuccino. The Server was very friendly and was quick with the check. He even split the bill 3 ways and was very upbeat. I forgot to mention that we had a Tv. in our booth and were comparing notes on the Opening Ceremony between China and Canada's Festivities.

I've tried 3 of your burgers at Burger Bar now (plus a bite of your $60 burger that my companion ordered), and I've been impressed all 3.5 times.  From the Buffalo Burger, to the American Kobe Beef Burger, to the Hubert Keller Burger, you knocked my socks off!

I was afraid to drink an entire Nutella milkshake by myself, but I took a sip from someone in my party who ordered it, and I got transported to chocolate heaven!  Please find a way to lower the sugar and calorie content in that drink, so I can order it without feeling guilty, otherwise I will just have to content myself with devouring it with my eyes, and you wouldn't want to do that to me, would you?\n\nCan you also please tell me what in the hell your waitresses eat at your restaurant?  Do they even eat at all?  Because they're all pretty skinny, and I know they didn't get that way from your skinny fries.  Maybe they eat your fat fries?  Or only one fat fry?  But can you do me a favor and tell them to improve their customer service because it seems like it takes them a long time to come around and take your order, or check up on you.  Tell them to eat 2 fat fries if that's what it takes.  Oh, and maybe you can expand your restaurant in the near future, too?  When I come with a party of 3 people we're always seated right away, but any bigger than that and I end up waiting 30 minutes or more.

I am quite surprised Hubert Keller has put his name on Burger Bar.  I was personally expecting more from the renown owner-chef of Fleur de Lys.  \n\nI had basic cheeseburger and there several critical things wrong, first the bacon was not crispy - it was kind of soft and opaque looking, they used American Cheese - that was obviously intentional, but probably a bad choice, cheddar would've been better, my bun was soggy with meat juice, and the burger had cooked like a small ball in the middle, not like a paddy -- and it was noticeably unsalted.   This was a fifteen dollar burger that was more like a 7 dollar burger. \n\nNow, to be fair, the fries were great: crispy and hot, and the service was also good ( with the exception of the hostess, who refused to seat us at a table at the bar unless we were going to eat).  I had two glasses of white wine, and while slightly over priced, the selection was good.\n\nWhat this place has going for it is the amazing view of Union Square, but as far as vibe it is full of tourist, large groups of women/girls, European gigolos, and grandparents.   The decor is completely basic, like any bar on Main Street, USA.  Brown chairs and tables, neon beer lights, and basic off white walls with little decoration on them.  It was not impressive.   And you have to fight your way into a crowded elevator in the lobby of Macy's to even get there -- which is probably somewhat expected, but still a crowded ride up.

The view from so high up was wonderful. \n\nIt took about 20 minutes for our food to come out and I don't know if that was good or bad, I just know I was starving and it felt like forever.\n\nMy burger was great!!!!  It was also huge. I'm an old fashion burger eater so I refuse to knife and fork my burger.

No toilet paper, paper towels over flowing the bins, and only one stall. WTF??!?!?! I expect way more from this. It was nothing short of looking like a bathroom at a gas station. I've seen cleaner bathrooms at Greyhound. #2 - Cali BFF and I decided we were in the mood to have a milk shake. We wanted to share one so we told the waiter we wanted one and was going to share.  He bought us out two glasses the size of maybe an oz more than a shot glass. We were like WTF but wasn't tripping because we knew our food would be out soon.  Once we got the bill, we were charged the full amount as if we got the regular glass full. The regular glass was about 12-14 oz so I was pissed that the waiter thought I was stupid to believe what we received was equivalent to a regular glass. When the manager came out to talk to us he didn't compensate us and try to beat me in the head by saying we actually get more ice cream in that size cup...WHATEVER!!!! #3 - Nothing comes with anything in this place. You're burger doesn't come w/anything but lettuce, onions and tomatoes. Cheese...extra, fries...extra.  By the time we were finished our food, for 2 burgers, 2 pieces of cheese, 2 shot glasses filled w/ice cream, 2 fries, our bill was about $20 each without tax and tip. YIKES!!!!!\n\nThe food was good.

I had a wonderful experience at Chef Keller's Fleur de Lys but was disappointed here. \n\nWe arrived at 4:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner amidst the Xmas shopping madness. \n\nWaited about 15 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad considering how crowded the restaurant already was. But then we were led to the bowels of the restaurant, and seated at a small booth right next to the kitchen. \n\nIt was *extremely* hot in that area, to the extent that we both peeled off all the layers we decently could and were still sweating from the heat of the kitchen coming through doors that were rarely closed.\n\nOur waitress took our order fairly quickly. We both opted for custom burgers: I had the Country Natural beef with caramelized onions, Monterey jack cheese, and oyster mushrooms. He ordered the American Kobe with caramelized onions and the truffle sauce on the side, both burgers on onion rolls.\n\nAnd then we waited. And waited. And waited. In the heat, with an annoying TV in the booth playing a basketball game from a decade ago, awful music blaring on the sound system, and our waitress nowhere to be found. \n\nAfter 45 minutes the waitress finally dropped by to check on our order and it was brought out a few minutes thereafter. \n\nYou would think in our ravenous state we would have found the burgers delicious. But they were very average burgers with thick patties, too much bread, and no real stand-out flavor. The truffle sauce was watery and had very little flavor at all, much less the kick that even a smidgen of truffles brings to food. The sweet potato fries & onion rings were better than the burgers.\n\nI love burgers and am a fan of those at Burgermeister and Spork (two very different burgers), but the entire experience at Burger Bar (heat, intense noise levels, glacial service, and mediocre burgers at a high price) left me dissatisfied. \n\nAll in all, definitely not worth a $50 price tag for two burgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.\n\nSome suggestions for improvement: \n\n1. Buttons or remote controls for the annoying muted TVs. That way we can either turn them off or at least soundlessly watch a game that was played in *this* century.\n\n2. Better air system when the kitchen gets hot and the resto gets crowded. I do not enjoy sweating along with my food.\n\n3. I understand it's a busy resto, but a 45-minute wait for a burger?  Unrealistic and must be addressed. At least you could have offered us a milkshake for the delay.\n\n4. Change the music from cheesy pop to something soothing & cool.

With a wonderful view of Union Square there is a mix of tourist, Macy's accidental shopper than happened into Burger Bar and those who are looking for a spectacular burger.\n\nI don't think it is asking too much for a superb offering, quality, service and innovation--but you get none of it.  The pricing structure should command a better offering and more attention to detail.  My burger--a simple Angus burger was of a mediocre quality--the standard fixings were all there but unexciting: a pickle spear, a very small slice of red onion, tomato, and a uninteresting lettuce.  Additions could have been baby greens, early girl tomatoes, a quality pickle, an outstanding bread, a special sauce?  \n\nThe onions were just as interesting as the entire experience.  Just because they are large and crunchy does not make an onion ring--a dash of pepper and even a splash of beer could have made them sing.\n\nThe wine offering by the glass was mainly California wines--and at that uninteresting.  Here a mark of difference could have been struck and a wine list that could zing.  The beer offering was a bit more generous.\n\nThe service was friendly but challenged.  I had to ask a couple of Burger Bar staff for my bill; I was never offered additional water and it was not that crowded which made my wait even more frustrating.\n\nI also look at ways Chef Keller could have departed from a standard diner burger to a gourmet burger; I would like an organic or natural ketchup and mustard and sea salt.\n\nA disappointment and I am surprised Hubert Keller would give this restaurant his signature.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

I'm not saying it's bad, it's just nothing amazing.\n\nSince yes, I am veggie, I got the veggie burger. I had it on a whole wheat bun with grilled asparagus. My first bite I thought was excellent, but that may have been due to the fact that I was absolutely starving. Their veggie burgers are made with a combination of potatoes, lentils, mushrooms, peas, rice, pumpkin, and mozzarella cheese- all of which sounded like a really, really good idea. But it was too mushy and I think made with too much potato, so it really fell short. No crisp to the outside, and a good veggie burger needs a more solid consistency. \n\nOur fries, while cut just the way I like them (and sweet potato option!!!) came out cold, which I think is pretty inexcusable. If all you really have on the menu is burger and fries, both better be really frickin good, or at least served fresh.\n\nMy man got one of the 'signature' burgers but said it was pretty bland, which annoyed  him since even the waiter mentioned 'flavor profiles' for the signature burgers. \n\nWe didn't try the milkshakes, but they looked damn good. Lots of options there too. I did want to laugh at our waiter though when he was giving his \"We're all about building options here at Burger Bar speech\" - I mean, really, it just seemed a little too \"flare\"-ish. Schpeels like that don't belong anywhere besides movies making fun of TGI Fridays. I do, however appreciate all the array of options here- you can put anything and everything on your burger (or in your shake)- so that is a plus.\n\nThe view of Union Square is cool and the overall atmosphere was nice. \n\nOverall, this had a slight feel of a tourist spot and seems a little generic. Don't think that just because Hubert's name is on this place it's going to knock your socks off.", "author": "Kristen L."}

We went here to celebrate a special occasion but needed a place we knew 3 toddlers would enjoy too.\n\nIt was a  little confusing trying to find the place, suggestion just take the elevator to the 6th floor in the Womans Macy's Building.  It takes much longer and a little searching if you take the escalators but I didn't have any problem since I pretty much stopped on every floor to \"window shop\".\n\nOnce you step into the restaurant you can see the beautiful view of Union Square, pretty much the same view if you were eating @ the Cheese Cake Factory.  You can either sit on a regular table, tables that are next to the window view, or huge booth that has your own personal tv and you can request them to change the channel to your hearts desire (Direct TV) Nice option for the kids or to watch any sports games.\n\nI ordered a customized burger,  with Onion bread, portobello mushrooms (YUMMM) American Cheese, Peppercorn Bacon & Peppercorn Cream Sauce.  There were so many other options but I'm a tiny person and didn't want to do too much on my first time there.  The food was delicious!!! The portobello mushrooms are a MUST!!!  My boyfriend ordered the Surf N Turf Burger and I tried a piece of his fresh lobster and it was delish!\n\nFor dessert we ordered the cheese cake burger & nutella burger.. They're both good but it was the first time I ever tried nutella and feel in love with it.\n\nThe atmosphere was okay.  The only place I would sit is either by the window or in the nice booths.  We went there on a Monday night so it was a little slow.  I don't think this would be a place I would think of going again to if it was just to drink and hang out.

Sadly though, as much as I am enamored of you and of your flagship Fleur de Lys, I wasn't as blown away by the Burger Bar. \nI was underwhelmed by the decor (as mentioned here many times) however found it preferable to that of the Cheesecake Factory, which is overdone to the point of spectacle. I don't need a 3 ring circus to accompany my meal, just make the food good enough that I forget all other ills. \nAt this, Chef Keller excels. I would absolutely eat here again, despite the patchy service, slow food, and various intervals of waiting. Waiting for our names to be called (and while I respect the prioritizing customers willing to wait within vocal calling distance, if waits are more than 15 minutes for a 2 top, one should have a more advanced system than \"you need to be here to hear your name called\".

I could happily order 3 sides of foie gras, and a cosmo milkshake, and I would leave happy every time. The free-range beef was tasty, the wine shallot (?) reduction sauce was fantastic, and bizarrely enough, my boyfriend's order of fried pickles was edible! HE loved them, I thought they tasted of a pregnant woman's fantasy, or the flavor of the smell of a county fair in August. Weird, but delicious. \n\nI'd like to return when service/administrative issues have been worked out, because the food and the concept are fantastic.

It took about 15 minutes to get seated, which was the amount of time estimated, so + for the accurate time of seating.  After we sat down, the experience as a whole went slowly down hill. \n\nTo start, my coke was a bit flat and it took me a few minutes to wave down a waiter to switch to something else.  It took me another few minutes to get his attention so that I could get a filled bottle of ketchup.  It seems like the staff has laser eye line of sight and don't see anything except whats in front of them.  It improved by the end of the night, but we were about finished by then - so negative points for that.\n\nThe food was prepared well.  I got the Hubert Burger and it was moist for a buffalo patty.  Unfortunately the toppings weren't applied with much care.  The spinach was all to one side and the caramelized onions weren't evenly distributed either.  I had to open up the burger and center everything myself.  Also, by the time I got the burger the bottom was already a bit soggy, so taking time to center everything didn't help with the already drenched bottom half.  All-in-all, this burger was probably worth $12, not $22.  I guess the extra $10 pays for the experience/location/ambiance.  Unfortunately only the location deserves anything higher than a neutral recommendation.\n\nWe also ordered the sliders.  They were OK.  Nothing noteworthy either way.\n\nOne potential positive note is that the milk shakes looked good.  I'm not a big milk shake person and my fiance doesn't handle them well - (TMI, I know) - so we didn't order any, but the presentation of their milk shake sampler looked quite delish.", "author": "Johnny C."}

The meat was dry yet held together with very little fat. A little pricey but it is the leanest of the burgers offered. The downside is that it does not include fries so you have to fork up another USD 3-4 to get those.\n\nShakes are a big deal here but we could not really fit it in. There was just one guy doing those drinks so I guess they take them seriously. So it you are into them you might be in for a real treat.\n\nSERVICE: They told us the wait would be 45 mins but it ended up being only 30mins. We missed the call but when we inquired they sat us right away. This was GOOD.\n\nThey got my order wrong: I had ordered buttermilk zucchini fries and got regular fries but frankly I did not care and the fries were just so good anyway. It worked OUT.\n\nWe really did not like our table--narrow booth for 2 with a TV monitor that we could not control. I thought that was kind of weird--the TV is just such a downer. This was BAD.\n\nWe would have stayed at the crappy table but somebody from management stopped by and asked us if everything was OK and when we mentioned our dislike for our table they gave us another table. This was GREAT.\n\nThe big PLUS is seeing Hubert Keller just working away, giving away shakes and being cute with the kids. We did not meet him but he seemed really nice and just very normal.\n\nAMBIANCE: It is noisy and I wish they put some time in improving the lighting. Right now it's like being in a Safeway.\n\nTHE MINUS: The Burger Bar should get rid off the TVs in the booths in the back. In fact, the narrow corridor with booths close to kitchen and coffee station is a downer. We felt like we were being punished when we were sat there. Your view is either the kitchen doors or the coffee station.\n\nHUBERT TO DO LIST: Get rid of the 2 top booths--they are uncomfortable. You are too much of a nice guy to have a Siberia section in your restaurant! Also, the TV have to go. You can't control them and you can't hear them so what's the point. It's awkward on a 2 top.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt was obviously the 2nd day after opening so you could tell with some of the staff but overall there was a real effort to ensure we had a good time and that is really commendable.

So I won't deny it, the burger was good. I got the Black Jack Burger which is one of the ones you cannot change from the menu. No really, don't ask. You can't. We just can't do it. Don't try...or so the waiter kept telling us again and again. Okay, okay I get it! The skinny fries were just that. They were skinny and they were fries. Nothing more, nothing less. The pickle was a pickle. So basically it was a pretty good burger with nothing more than average stuff to go with it. Why I struggled with this review is because I think I was expecting the sky to open up and see some form of deity or something. Didn't happen. \n\nThe location is great (Union Square view) and in Macy's if you really wanted to make a day out of it. Decor was nice, but nothing to write home about. And that brings me to the service. Not horrible or anything, but here is where I really think things should have been outstanding. Here is where you make a burger more than just going to eat a burger, even if it is a really good burger. \n\nFirst, there seemed to be three to four hosts hovering/working at one time. Yes the place was busy but it felt like three airline employees trying to rebook 100 people who's flights just got cancelled. When we were seated, the TVs were really distracting. Why would you make me watch infomercials while I'm trying to eat? Our order took what seemed to be an unusual amount of time. More time that a really good burger should seem to take, then our waiter started to acknowledge it too. Clearly something had happened, or the kitchen was just really slow. Oh, and my friend's drink order was messed up. I'm not trying to be negative about the service, but there really wasn't anything spectacular about it. \n\nI'd go back, but only after I've tried a few other places I've been meaning to give a shot.", "author": "Mike C."}

I have had much better fried stuff elsewhere. Being a \"gourmet\" burger place you would think the batter they fry this stuff in would have a twist to it or come with some sauces that make you just want to dive in again and again. How about some flavored salts? Maybe throw in some truffle salt? \n\nThey did have a fun dessert for the birthday girl. It was a cheese cake in the shape of a hamburger. The cheese was passion fruit gelatin and there was chocolate underneath with a bun made of a donut dough. \n\nIf you are in Macy's and shopping and tired and you have a choice between Burger Bar or one more floor up to face the madness of Cheesecake factory I say hit Burger Bar.

Despite it's convenient location atop Macys, you will likely find me waiting the hour at Cheesecake Factory than eating at Burger Bar. Service was slow and the food was not worth the wait. The burger was a la cart and each add-on cost money, including the fries options. The Country Natural burger ($10.50) with cheese ($0.75) and chipotle aioli ($0.45) was a little too thick and over cooked. Zucchini fries ($3.95) were the size of fried mozzarella and tasted ok, but nothing to rave about. Onion rings were good and crispy ($3.55) and probably the best thing I tried. Managed to stay away from the whopping $3.25 soda though. \n\nTip: grab a booth in the back for a table with your own TV.

Menu had a great variety offered from various cuts, meats and even included a veggie and salmon steak. The taste was ok at best - nothing to write home about. Nice full beer selection and unique selection of blended/ice cream drinks. Very limited selection of sauces which makes no sense.

I went New Year's Eve around 7PM with two people just taking a chance that we may squeeze into the bar seating at least.  We fully expected to either get turned away or encounter a long waiting time, an hour or more, but we were pleasantly surprised.  We crossed our fingers as we ascended to the 6th floor of the Macy's building through crowds of tourists and street entertainers across from the, decked out for the holidays, Union Square Park.  The hostess was exceptionally pleasant and welcoming despite the throngs of people jammed in front of her podium anxiously waiting to be seated.  She acknowledged new people almost instantly and assured us that she would find us seating ASAP.  We were mentally prepared to wait for quite awhile but we were actually seated within 5 minutes. For a celebrity chef restaurant,  the menu was very reasonably priced and diverse enough for even those in our party with dietary restrictions to appreciate and enjoy.  Of course at a burger place I NEEDED to have a burger and yes it was amazing!  I ordered the Chef's special Black Jack Burger medium - a black angus burger with jack cheese and black olive tapenade on ciabatta bread accompanied by skinny fries.  Yum!  cook temp was perfect on the burger, the flavor of the olive tapenade melting just perfectly with the cheese into the burger was salty savory goodness. The ciabatta roll toasted golden and the skinny fries were so crazy fresh that I could smell and taste real potato as if it was just hand cut moments before frying - crispy outside and comforting tenderness inside.  I usually avoid fries because they aren't made well but these were something spectacular.  I just wish I had saved room for the milkshake paddle that I kept seeing people order.  It looked sinfully good. I guess I will just have to go back!", "author": "Bia R."}

Then they sat us in a small corner and I asked can we sit in one of the booths or the other open tables, but the staff said \"I'm sorry we do not seat two people in the booths,\" when place is only 40% filled and non-peak hour.  That is just bad business practice.\n\nFor a $15+ (regular) burger, you did expect to get a pretty good size portion, but not what I got the meat patty was quite small compare to the one I had in Vegas this past summer.  And they forgot to include the extra pesto sauce (they charge for all these different toppings and sauces) my guest ordered.  \n\nOverall, the food was just okay , it is more of a hype and the table service was good (besides assigning us a small table).

He happened to be at the restaurant on the day my sis and I visited. We had just eaten brunch with our parents and as they left to return to the east coast, the two of us decided to grab beers at Burger Bar because of it's location and sweet view of Union Square. As a longtime Top Chef fan, I had recently fallen in love with Hubert following the last season of Top Chef Masters during which I was convinced that I was his biggest cheerleader. So you can imagine how starstruck I was when I saw him pacing on his cell phone behind a set of closed doors - though you can barely see through the doors, I'd know that white ponytail anywhere. I kept turning around and staring like a fool, and finally decided to get a hold of myself. After sometime, he decided to come out as my sister grabbed me across the table and exclaimed \"Pia, he's gonna walk by us!\" Not knowing what else to do, as I saw a flash of white go by, I screamed out \"Hubert!\" (to this day I scold myself for not calling him \"chef\"). Anyways, despite  my lack of eloquence, he was so polite and sweet and was truly flattered that I was such an adoring fan. He asked us if we had tried the burgers and we apologized that we had not as we came here on full stomachs. He then asked if we liked milkshakes, and we both nodded eagerly. Chef Keller himself then had 2 complimentary milkshakes (which were delicious!) sent out for me and my sis.

One was so dry, I was at least glad I finished it first.\n\nStill, from what I was able to taste, the quality of meat was pretty good, and the fries were delicious.  The selection of beers is pretty awesome and the staff are quite friendly.\n\nI'd go back, but not for dinner, the place is SO LOUD, it's not the type of place I would visit for a quiet evening of dining.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

So I \nwas surprised to see this dilapidated spot in union square called burger bar.\nWow what a difference a city makes. Being a Keller restaurant located in a \"higher end\" store I thought they would have brought the same great food, service and ambiance. Guess not.  We all ordered medium rare burgers and were all given well done taco meat. My friend even had the minerals to get the \"signature\"  $60 Kobe, lobster and truffle burger. His analysis, \"I wouldn't pay $6 for the burger. The lobster tasted frozen and microwaved, the truffles were a joke, the wine reduction added nothing to the meal and the meat was painfully overcooked\".  Lastly this place feels like ur in someone's old apartment that hasnt been swept or cleaned for months. $20 or so for a burger barely ahead of red robin.  This place will surely shuffle in all the shopping tourists that think they are getting a high end meal. As for this local, I am severely underwhelmed.", "author": "Mark N."}

Don't get their peppercorn burger ... it's bland and very dry . They forgot to give me my fries . Their BB twinkie shake is really good but also very fattening . I love how they have twinkies and little pieces of twinkies in the shake ... it makes the shake have some texture . A few hours ago , I came here and ordered The World's Hottest Burger and let me just say ... it's no joke ! I didn't expect it to be all that spicy because I've had all kinds of spicy foods and rarely ever come across that I find as a spicy challenge but this burger defininately was ! It was almost unedible !! What's really spicy about the burger is their sauce . I took a couple bites and I felt like my mouth was on fire . I was surprised to find that a tear rolled out of my eye . It was so bad I found myself grabbing whatever was in site ( fries , water , beer , my friend's burger ) right after taking a couple bites to put out the fire in my mouth . I didn't want to waste the burger so I took it apart and ate it . It wasn't as spicy when I ate the meat , bacon , and bun separately but it was still spicy as hell . I ordered an Irish Coffee Milkshake which tasted really good . Too bad the waiter gave it to me so late because it sorta helped calm down the fire in my mouth . I was able to finish the meat and almost all the bacon after taking apart the burger but then it just got to the point that I didn't like the feeling of my mouth burning . No wonder they don't allow you to order The World's Hottest Burger to go and make you sign a waiver before serving it to you ! The skinny fries that came with the burger had some red pepper powder on it so it was a little spicy as well . The fries were really yummy . It is comparable to McDonald's fries . If not , better .  I was curious about their Purple Haze draft beer so I decided to try . It tasted like shit ... it tasted like someone's puke . My friend's Buffalo Burger tasted pretty good . The buffalo meat was really yummy and flavor ... it tastes better than cow meat . I'm not a big fan of sweet potato fries so I was surprised to find that I really liked their potato fries . Their beer battered jalapeno pickles are pretty good ... it's nice and spicy and I like the texture of the beer battered outside coating . I eventually found it fattening so I ripped off the beer battered outside coating and just ate the jalapeno pickle . I would definately recommend coming here for their shakes ... they're really good . If you plan to try The World's Hottest Burger , proceed with caution .", "author": "Eileen L."}

The two couples on either side of us were also comped due to complaints about the sub-standard fare.

We arrived and waited and waited, even though we were told we were next multiple tables were seated in front of us...finally we were seated and again we waited, and waited, and waited....we literally sat there for 5 minutes talking about leaving, then finally flagged a hostess to ask for our waiter...who ran over and without even saying hello said \"are you ready?\" we each rattled off our orders, the burger, toppings, sides, etc...each time as if he wasn't listening and was robotically programmed to upsell \"would you like a side\" and each time, \"yes, we already ordered the fries, salad, etc\" my friend ordered a salad for an appetizer, he never asked what dressing he wanted (flash forward to later when it arrived dressing-less haha), didn't take his drink order.and literally ran from our table as if we had just inconvenienced him. \n\nThings began to come..drinks first, but no refills without almost literally grabbing someone as they ran by our booth, a salad with no dressing, a burger missing the mustard that they charge extra for, my friend asked for no pickles and was assured they were not on the burger but would not be on the plate at all, hey look at that a pickle on his plate! One time I think he ran by to check on us once we finally got everything we had ordered after multiple trips to the kitchen, but he didn't even stop long enough for a response from us, he just mumbled something and ran off...Actually he did come back, to try to sell us dessert, which we may have ordered but at this point were ready to put this meal out of it's misery. \n\nWe got the check, after asking...and we had each ordered totally different things, especially me because I am unemployed and even $20 (which is difficult to do here) for a meal is a lot for me right now, and this was supposed to be a treat. We explained to him which card got which amount, confirmed it twice...he came back, hands me my card \"sorry sir I accidentally put a $53 charge on your card, but i voided it then charged you $20 again, but it probably wont even show up.) This was Thursday night, It is now Monday afternoon, the charge is still on there, and that $53 is being held from me...did I mention how broke I am right now?! \n\nI was going to just ignore it, but my money is still not available, and I called to try to discuss it with a manager today, hoping for some kind of a resolution, they weren't there, and I never got the call back I was promised hours ago, even though I made it very clear how upset I was.\n\nI am not sure if you read your yelp reviews Mr. Keller, but if you see this here is my advice...spend less time and money on the massive flatscreen portrait of yourself, and more on training your staff in proper customer service so that when you charge 3 people $88 for a burger meal with no booze, they dont feel like they have been punched in the face by the entire staff to boot.", "author": "Dan B."}

I had to call - guess they're not on opentable.com anymore. Although after trying to get into the city on a game day proved to be difficult, we called and pushed back the time of our reservation - it wasn't a problem. Still when we got there. A line going all the way to the elevator and no hostess in sight. So we had to wait for the hostess to get back, help the people in front of us and then wait some for the table to be cleared for us. Finally we were seated on the right side of the restaurant, which is kinda the empty side. We were at this table that looked like they just put it in the middle of the room. There's some tables by the windows that have amazing views of the City - wish we gotten one of those. Anyways, I ordered the American burger. It had mushrooms, cheese, bacon and a giant patty. Most everyone else got a customized burger. Seems like a good thing but pricey. And of course we got the fries, regular and the sweet potato variety, for the table. Also a couple things of truffle sauce for everyone to try. It's pricey at over $5 per order for a small thing of sauce but the table wanted to try it and how many times in your life are you ever going to have some truffle sauce. The burger was huge so I really struggled to finish it but I did. Had a few bites with the truffle sauce and it was tasty but not sure it's $5 extra worth of deliciousness. The fries were one of the best I've had. So crispy and hot and tasted like sweet potatoes. Mmmm. Service was just ok - nothing special.

Turkey burgers, salmon burgers,veggies burgers are not substitutes for a real hamburger.\n\nGiven the above, I was eager to try the buffalo burger at Burger Bar. It was priced much higher than their regular beef burgers and the same as their Kobe burger.  The one I had here was pretty good, not on a par with Ted's Montana Grill, which serves the best Bison Burger I have ever had.  Hell it is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.\n\nI like the Burger Bar's approach -  where you basically design your own burger - you select your meat, cheese, condiments, roll, and whatever else you wish to have on it.  All the ingredients are top notch, fresh and from great purveyors.  If you do not like your burger here, you only have yourself to blame.", "author": "Steve S."}

On the side, sweet potato fries and a chocolate milkshake. The wait was an hour long (we arrived at 1pm) so we took our food to go and ate in union square. \n\nThe burger - such a disappointment. To begin, I'm not even sure they gave me the red wine sauce with shallots. The sauce looked like any other au jus - not red, no shallots, and tasting bland as could be. Such a disappointment because I am a huge fan of redwine reduction sauces and this was just no where near such a sauce in my book. The burger was cooked to medium, which must be their standard go-to doneness level because I forgot and was not asked how well-done I wanted the burger. It was standard. Not overly juicy or flavorful in anyway. The bun was good, but should you really come out to Macy's for a 'good' bun? No. If you want bread go to the Boulaungerie. Don't go here for the burgers. \n\nThe fries - standard, nothing special, not even great. For someone who has been on and judged Top Chef, Mr. Keller should know a thing or two about seasoning. There are so many sports bars with great fries around. It's a must. A must. So don't go for the fries.\n\nThe milkshake - My best guess is that the milkshake is made with whipped half and half and then a bit of ice cream.  It was really thick, and room temperature in about two minutes, and barely cool to begin with. I was expecting a cold creamy milkshake, not chocolate whipped cream. BTW if you do get a milkshake (but you should skip it) don't get whipped cream. I think that just drowns out the flavor even more. \n\nI guess I am saying - I know you want to go for the experience, but seriously save yourself the $30 or more and go anywhere else for a burger. Infact try Nopa. The burgers and fries are delish, and surely they have a dessert that can top that sad milkshake. \n\nHonestly, I can't even give the benefit of the doubt since they just opened on this one. Everything was disappointing, and I don't think a month or two will make any difference.\n\nOn a positive note, Mr. Keller is delightful. I had about a 30 second interaction taking a photo with him when we first arrived and he was nothing but pleasant and happy to see you at his restaurant.", "author": "Erica L."}

We placed our order, then, just waited and waited. No matter though, since we were just relaxing and enjoying the downtime from our very productive and efficient morning of shopping. We were just looking forward to our burgers. So here's the quick lowdown. \n\nFood: 3 stars\nI got the Hubert Keller favorite (buffalo, caramelized onions, sauteed spinach, and blue cheese on ciabatta bun with skinny fries. My husband got the American Kobe w/bacon and cheese on ciabatta w/sweet potato fries. We both agreed the burgers were good but nothing particularly outstanding. I ordered mine medium but it came out well done. I didn't complain though since I was hungry and tired and didn't particularly care at the moment as it still tasted good. The fries were fries (i.e. tasty), but nothing special to note...equivalent to The Counter.\n\nService: 2.5 stars\nSlow but friendly -- It took about 30 min. before our burgers came out\nI usually don't dock points for slower pace service because it's not a pain point for me when dining out unless I've got somewhere to be afterwards. That said, I would've given 3 stars if they hadn't kept rushing me to finish. I only ate about 1/3 of my burger and stopped for a sec to rest when 3 people came by all within 15 min. to ask if I needed a to-go box or if I was done. I just got my burger, back off!!\n\nDecor/Ambiance: 3 stars\nTo be honest I thought it was going to be more posh than it was. With the uniforms and branded items for sale (panties, tees, and wifebeaters) it was more gimmicky than I would've expected of a Hubert Keller eatery. It makes me think perhaps Hubert is a fan of establishments like Cheesecake Factory, Hooters, and Hard Rock.

I had the peppercorn burger, which I liked, although it was a little plain for being the price that it is. I also had the deep-fried pickles which at the time sounded like a really good idea (I was thinking it would be like jalapeno poppers), but it was pretty disappointing! It really just tasted like pickles in batter, not a miraculous transformation of any sort. I wish I had just stuck with fries, even though they also looked just ho-hum.  Also, just so there are no surprises for you, the portions for the sides are really tiny. I think my boyfriend got like 4 medium sized onion rings as his side. \n\nOne highlight of this experience were the alcoholic milkshakes! I've never had them elsewhere, so I was pretty excited. Albeit, $10 is pretty pricey for receiving such a small portion (it didn't come with that requisite extra bit of milkshake in the mixing cup). However, the mint chocolate shake was pretty tasty, provided that you drink it really quickly! Halfway through my meal, the milkshake was already becoming lukewarm and was getting pretty gross-tasting. \n\nService was sub-par, the waiter forgot to bring me back my credit card and I had already left for the grocery store before I realized it. I guess maybe I was irresponsible for not making sure I got it back, but damn, the waiter should have just done his effing job correctly. For the price, the wait and the annoying atmosphere (I mean, its Union Square), I probably won't be back.", "author": "Ruby H."}

At least the restaurant died down a bit and we were able to move - where we had a lovely view of the Macy's kitchenware department.\n\nMy $10 alcoholic milkshake just didn't work.  It was watery and tasted like a decent cocktail, but certainly not a milkshake. The Hubert Keller burger was better than I expected, quite good with an excellent pairing of cheese and other toppings. And the sweet potato fries were actually one of the best I've had, I just wish that there was a better dipping sauce.\n\nUnfortunately the price for two people was around $100 including just one drink (the milkshake).

I had high hopes for this place but sadly BB did not meet my expectations.  \n\nLet's start off by saying I met Hubert Keller who was gracious enough to shake our hands while we were waiting and chatted with us for a while.  He does seem like a genuinely nice guy.  \n\nOnto the food...\n\nThe burger in my opinion is too small.  I've had the regular Angus burger and also the Kobe burger.  The kobe is much more flavorful and juicier but not that much more.  The issue and why I am giving it three stars is because the burger is just too small.  If it was bigger it would probably get another half star or full star.  So the burger is small and if you build your own burger it doesn't come with fries, you have to order it.  The sweet potato fries are yummy but the other fries are so so.  When the burger is small, don't put it on a large plate where half the plate is empty.  That doesn't look good; it makes the burger look even smaller.  \n\nLet me just say this, I love burgers.  I have tried to try as many burgers as possible.  I have a delicate stomach so I can't eat at every place but I love burgers.  \n\nI would rather pay a few more dollars and to have the combo of fries and burger than to have to pay separately.  Put some fries on the plate so the burger won't look so small.  \n\nThe dessert burger, to be specific, the cheesecake burger with a hint of mint leaves, passionfruit, pineapple, strawberries, that is the best dessert burger there can be.  Just thinking about it makes me want to up this review to 3.5 stars but unfortunately I can't so let's stick with 3 stars.  \n\nBurgers need to be bigger, juicier, and all burgers need to come with some kind of fries.  If that happens and when it does, I will give it four stars.  \n\nI haven't tried the burger with foie gras despite loving foie gras.  I will say that it usually doesn't go together.  I've had it a few times at other places (NY, Vegas, Hong Kong, LA) and the best one was LA because they made it into a cream.  \n\nWill I go back to BB?

I didn't bother getting any drinks because I personally could find better ways to spend $13 than on a bottle of Duvel (even though Duvel is delightful). \n\nOverall, it's a pretty solid burger although it's comparable to the Counter.

It was not a horrible experience by any means.

Additionally, out plates were garnished were another remembrance to roadside eateries across the land...the obligatory lettuce, slice of tomato and slice of onion. Again, hope was over ruled by what one could only perceive as strict business practice, nothing but the normal red ketchup, yellow mustard, salt, pepper and hot sauce on the table. The little TVs were nice the intimacy of the booths really were not conducive to TV viewing as much as they were to conversation. \n\nThe menu was quite interesting I want to point out. You can order from already selected burgers such as the All American, The this and the that. They all come with preselected goodies on them that is exactly what you get. You also have the option to build the burger exactly the way you want it. Your selection of meat, toppings, cheese and bread plus the fries.

The premise of the location is simple and accessible: provide a list of super-high quality ingredients and let the customer build their own custom burger to taste. On my first trip I built a kobe beef burger with blue cheese, bacon, jalape\u00f1os, and mushrooms. My second burger was a country farm patty with mushrooms, swiss cheese, and jalape\u00f1o bacon. Both were excellent, though the kobe patty was clearly superior in flavor.\n\nDiners B&T were at both excursions, and reported somewhat mixed reviews on the vegetarian patty, but on the second trip B enjoyed his salmon patty and T experimented with the buffalo patty with good results. Much to everyones great envy, B had the foresight to order the peppercorn sauce and it was amazing, I'll be sure to add that to my next burger concoction.\n\nI think the one thing I most like about the burger bar is the ability to make small incremental changes to a base set of taste to discover what appeals to you most. Like, the difference between my first two burgers was relatively small, but the taste differences were large. If it weren't so expensive -- to say nothing of unhealthy -- one could setup a series of fun taste experiments.\n\nTo top off the whole experience I recommend getting a milkshake.

It was a decent sized party (9) and our original plan was to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  Since CF doesn't take reservations, we were told our wait was going to be 4 hours.  So we went over to Burger Bar instead where we were told the wait was going to be 1 hour.   We were actually seated in less than 30 minutes.  And that maybe should have told us something about what to expect (the place wasn't all that crowded either, like there were still empty tables when we were seated).\n\nSo first the positives:\nOur server was super friendly.  Not the most attentive of fellows, but he did an adequate job.\n\nAnd that's about it...\n\nThe food was mediocre at best.\n\nI had the Chili in a sourdough bowl and I actually would have preferred a can of Hormel Chili.  At least Hormel Chili has chili spices to it.  This chili just tasted like a southwest-inspired hamburger stew.  It was barely warm.  It had no flavor.  The sourdough was pretty bad too.  I usually expect burger joints to do a decent chili, especially if they use good meat, which this place supposedly does.  But man, the chili was pretty bad...\n\nMy cousin got allegedly the hottest burger in the world (they claimed it was a million scoville units and hotter than the jolokia pepper) and even had to sign a waiver for it.  We were all pretty skeptical about it, but wow, the burger was a TOTAL joke.  The only reason my cousin even started to sweat was because he ate the raw habanero pepper that came with it.\n\nMy other cousin got a turkey burger that was overdone and dry.  Supposedly because people were complaining that the burgers weren't well done enough.  My two cents, if people don't know how to order a well-done burger, I think that is their problem.  I don't think the restaurant should be pre-emptively making everybody's burgers well-done.\n\nEverything else we had was merely OK, probably two stars.  The reason why this place only gets one star is because of the prices.  I know we are in a touristy area and they can get away with inflated prices, but seriously, the food should at least be decent.   There are plenty of places in SF to get good food at good prices, this just happens to be one of the places where you can get mediocre food at mediocre prices.\n\nThere is absolutely no way I am coming back to this place.  I would rather wait the 4 hours for the Cheesecake Factory next time rather than go back to this place.  Or better yet, try another family styled place in the area.", "author": "David K."}

I came here on a early Sunday afternoon, hoping to beat the crowds. While waiting for the super slow elevator, Hubert comes rolling in through the double doors. He greets us and heads for the escalator. He either (a) doesn't want to spend the next awkward moments with us in the elevator, or (b) knows better than to the wait for the super slow elevator. For the amount of money spent here, you would think that the decor would be less blah. But blah is about all you're going to get with the white walls, like the one I sat next to when there was huge window display of Union Square to be seen. \n\nMy sister and I weren't too hungry, so we opted to share a kobe beef burger with mushrooms, grilled onions, and a side of sweet potato fries. We also ordered a chocolate milkshake to share as well. The milkshake came in two separate and very small cups. Although cute, about half the cup was filled with cream, a forth filled with chocolate syrup, and the other forth, you get your \"milkshake.\" I overheard this older couple ask the waiter to get the same as us. But the waiter loudly proclaimed, you're getting ripped off if you get those cups and it's not really worth it compared to the individual size. First of all, I did not ask for my drink to be separated and secondly, how rude is it for the waiter to say that so loudly within our perceptual range? \n\nThe food comes separated in two plates, which was appreciated. But it really highlighted how much food you're getting. Overall the burger was lackluster and flavorless. Fries were alright, but I've never met a fry I didn't like. The meal all together cost $40. A bit steep for burger, fries, and milkshake. Would have been $7 at In-N-Out and I would have been happier. At least Hubert smiled at me and for that I am content.", "author": "Adrianna C."}

I went for lunch and as I usually eat very light for lunch ordered the Burger Bar Sliders which consisted of a trio of different mini burgers accompanied with a side of skinny fries $12.75. The three sliders were 1.Buffalo with caramelized onions, 2. Angus with plain bacon and 3. Country Natural Beef with American cheese. \"All sliders cooked medium. No substitution on temperature or toppings.\"  All three were very tasty indeed. Not incredible but very tasty. The buffalo had the most delectable flavor and was the juiciest. None of the burgers were cooked medium. The buffalo burger had a hint of pink and the other two were cooked through. All were moist and tender and I do realize that cooking a silver dollar burger medium  takes some extra attention but hey, this is Hubert Keller's place and being so I would expect perfection in the cooking preparation. The fries are a completely different story. Being in a restaurant purveyed by a renowned French chef I was anticipating yummy fries. What I was served were hot and salted perfectly but were dry and tough with only the flavor of the oil they were fried in. Simply put they were atrocious and disappointing.\n\nAll in all the 3 mini burgers were very tasty but not incredible and the fries were awful. For $14.75 tax and tip included I expected to be served something  more worthy from Mr. Keller. My first lunch experience left me feeling like Burger Bar is indeed nothing more than another Cheescake Factory type chain restaurant.\n\nI will give Burger Bar another try, order a full size burger and hope for a better culinary experience.", "author": "Steven B."}

The burger was perfect and the bacon is very good.  The combination was delicious. \n\nMy husband had natural beef with cheddar cheese, fried egg and bacon.  He ordered it medium, but the burger was cooked medium rare like mine.  Nevertheless, he still enjoyed his burger, and I think next time we're going to try the burger with egg and truffle sauce.  We also ordered skinny fries and sweet potato fries.  Both were good, but not particularly special.  I had hoped they would offer duck fat fries, but that was not on the menu at all.\n\nWe split a banana split that was quite good other than that the pineapple was not really ripe and should have been chopped into smaller pieces. The banana with a brulee coating was quite good and an excellent addition to the classic banana split.\n\nThe decor is a little bland - the tables and chairs are super generic, and I always thought something by Mssr.

This is a great concept, and I don't know why more restaurants haven't thought of it.\nPretty solid beer list as well, though serving every beer in its own branded glass is a little cheesy.  The Belgian ale I had came with its own little wooden support thing.  Novel for the first sip, but just give me a pint glass and I'll be fine.\nYou can build your own burger or get one pre-made.  We both opted for the build your own.  She got Kobe with cheddar and onions on an onion roll, I got the Angus with provolone and jalapenos on ciabatta.  Both medium rare.  The bun selection turned out to be important, as mine held up to the juiciness of the burger, but hers didn't.  Both burgers were very good, though.  Quality meat, perfectly cooked, very juicy, as I just said.\nWe also got an order of the deep fried pickles, which were outstanding (though I swear the menu said 'deep fried pickled jalapenos'..eh).    \nOur waitress was friendly and helpful, 5 stars for the service.\nOverall, if someone else is paying, this is a 5 star place.  However, I saw the prices on the menu, and it's pretty spendy.  I think my 2 beers alone were around $25.  That being said, it's a great burger place with the added bonus of booze-filled milkshakes.

Catchy name, located on top of the Macy's building........hmmm, let's check it out.\n\nA lady friend of mine was turning 31, so she says, and decided she wanted to have her party at Burger Bar.  We arrived, the table for 14 was all set and ready for us, and the server, who was easy on the eyes, was ushering out water as soon as we were seated.  Reviewing the menu didn't take long, as they a build-your-own-burger option, and about half six or seven chef's creations.  I'm not trained in beef science, so I truly don't know the difference between black angus, kobe, or buffalo, but the choices are there for those who are beef divas.  I got a black angus burger, known as the Black Jack.  My choice was based more on the toppings accompanying, rather than the type of beef.  It was served on ciabatta (I do love ciabatta), with pesto, olive tapenade, jack cheese, and tomato.  But let me tell you, I should have ordered a pitcher of water with it.  That burger, which I had cooked medium-rare, was so dry, that a photo of it would be placed in the wikipedia entry under Mojave Desert.  So, they may not shine in the core product, however, the skinny fries, which come with each of the chef's burgers, are excellent!  They were crisp, and salted just right, yummo!  I tore those fries up!!!!!  Can we get a standing ovation for the skinny fries!  At my table were 13 others, and their commentary was similar to mine, and they weren't thrilled about the high price tag attached to the burgers.  \n\nIn an nutshell, their pricey burgers aren't something worthy of my to-do-before-I-die list, but their staff was pleasant to deal with, and they're not overwhelmed with long wait queues, like the other popular restaurant on the opposite side of the Macy's building.", "author": "Damon Z."}

Since I have never been to any of Hubert Keller's restaurants, I had no idea what to expect.  After reading so many mixed reviews of the Burger Bar, I am glad that I had a pretty good first experience.\n\ni actually tried to make a reservation for our party of 8 but was told that they only take reservations for parties of 13 or more.  They did assure me that there will be plenty of tables to accommodate our party and true to their word, we were seated promptly upon our arrival.\n\nThe infinite number of burger combinations was too overwhelming for me so I ended up ordering the Burger Bar Sliders.  The buffalo with caramelized onions was definitely my favorite.  I've never had buffalo meat before until today and knowing how lean it is, I half-expected it to be dry but contrarily, it was was moist and juicy.  The Angus beef with bacon was pretty good too but the Country Natural beef was nothing special at all.  I subbed the skinny fries with sweet potato fries and those were pretty yummy ~ not greasy at all.\n\nMost of the people in my party seemed to enjoy their burgers as well, with the exception of one person who ordered the Chef's Veggie Burger (with lentils, peas, brown and white rice, etc...doesn't sound appetizing at all).  But then again, who would expect that to be good?  If you are a vegetarian/vegan, then you are probably better off with the Vegas Vegan (with grilled zucchini, eggplant, tomato and peppers sandwiched between two portabella mushrooms), as another coworker who ordered it said it was delish.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Milkshake Sampler Paddle, which consisted of two chocolate, two coffee and two strawberry shakes.  I had the coffee one, which was really yummy.  I tried it before mixing in the caramel on the side and the chocolate syrup in the bottom of the glass and liked it better without them as it made the shake too thick.\n\nOverall, pretty good meal.  Service was okay...nothing spectacular.  Expect to pay around $15 or so for a burger.  For those who have the money to splurge, you can try the Rossini for $60 which has Kobe beef with foie gras and shaved truffles.

It's a great combo... reminds me of the Father's Office burger  in LA, but not as good.  I ordered it medium-rare, but it came out closer to medium... but still a really good burger.  The skinny fries tasted pretty average.", "author": "Todd K."}

I have no problem giving the 5 stars in this case--if I could, I would give more.\n\nFirst, after being told there would be a 40 minute wait (and happily choosing to wait because we got the opportunity to shop a bit in the meantime), we came back after about 20 minutes to check in. Although we were still pretty far down on the list, the maitre d' just bumped us to the top and sat us immediately (what luck).\n\nThe place was super busy (I think it was a Friday night or something) and although we managed to get our drinks promptly (two Speakeasy \"Burger Bar\" Blondes--which, by the way, are quite good), the food took quite a while.  Our waiter, however, was amazing.  You could tell that he was extremely busy--he was sort of frantically running around--but never failed to check up on us.\n\nAfter the food finally arrived, it was worth the wait.  Everything was just simple, fresh, and impeccably well thought-out.  I had the sliders and fries while my boyfriend had the country natural burger.   Even though the meals are simple, the food just tastes good.  It's the combination of great meat, freshly baked buns, and fresh veggies.  And to top it off, everything is pretty reasonably priced.\n\nBut here's the icing on the cake:  during various parts of our dinner, Hubert Keller was walking around to all the tables and asking the patrons how their meals were.  He seemed to truly have cared about the service and everyone's satisfaction regarding the food.  He even agreed to a few photo-ops from other customers, and didn't seem even remotely perturbed, nor did he try to run off (though he appeared to be busy as well).  It isn't every day that you get to eat an amazing meal and then have the opportunity to meet the chef, who has become sort of a celebrity because of his appearance on Top Chef.  It was amazing.  I could not have asked for a better experience.", "author": "Lauren W."}

On a Thursday evening, the place was packed with a 45 min+ wait.  Tables are cramped, it's fairly noisy, and it's just kind of sensory overload at this point.  None of this is really surprising, but it's worth stating.\n\nThe Burger Bar is terribly named.  The logo is terrible.  The font faces throughout the menus are hideous.  The photos which the Burger Bar team use for promotional purposes seem about 20 years out of date.   The photo of Keller on a motorcycle drinking a milkshake.. well.. let's just say that HK isn't too concerned about being taken seriously anymore.  (To be fair, he's pretty much the nicest guy in the world - we met him at Fluer De Lys a few months before the whole Top Chef Masters madness).\n\nThe burger selection and selection of condiments  is quite impressive (in addition to a sizable beer/wine menu), although the basic menu seems like it could be designed in a much simpler format. It's so incredibly busy.    I went for the buffalo burger w/ avocado, sprouts, and peppered bacon w/ a vanilla milkshake.   The portions are fairly large, and the burgers are so large that keeping them together is a definite problem.  Everything tasted quite good, and afterwards, I was in a definite meat coma.\n\nTwo people.  Burgers, milkshakes, one beer, 70 bucks pre-tip.  Expensive burger meal, no doubt, but that's to be expected.  You can even go big and get the $60 Kobe burger w/ foie gras and truffles.  Oy. I like the concept of the Burger Bar, I just don't really like how it was executed.", "author": "chris c."}

We split some regular skinny fries which was just ok. It hit the spot as we were both hungover, had shopped all day and were beat and in need of something greasy and tasty. But, i have no desire to go back to spend $25 on a burger/fry meal. We both suggested buying our own bottle kahlua then going around the corner to BK to get a burger, fries and milkshake and make our own special shake for a quarter of the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-29", "description": "For you ADHD types who can't read more than a sentence, I'll get this out of the way- the burger at Nopa tastes much better.\n\nI figured I'd check out the quality of their simplest burger offering and  tried the basic no-frills grain fed Black Angus Beef burger.\n\nThe burger came out cooked to order on an onion bun (you get several choices, including standard issue burger bun and ciabatta, just like at Jack in the Box...) with the optional blue cheese that I added. The onion bun had a nice, sweet, buttery taste with good spongy texture. The accompanying dill pickle slice had a nice tart briny taste to it and was nice and crunchy. The tomato, red onion slices and lettuce were good quality and tasted nice and fresh.\n\nThe big letdown came in the form of the beef patty. It's probably better than what's in 90%+ of the burgers you encounter in the City, but it wasn't anything special. The patty itself was nice, juicy and thick, around 1/2 inch thick. Unfortunately, the patty was pretty bland. Perhaps chef Keller doesn't believe in over-seasoning the beef in the patty, but it really could have used something stupidly simple like salt to improve the taste.\n\nI suppose the \"flavor\" gets introduced in the $12+ signature burgers via the additional sauces and toppings.\n\nIn contrast, the grass fed burgers at Nopa (which currently costs $13, and includes fries) do not require ketchup or A1 steak sauce to taste good. Nor salt for that matter. Incidentally, Burger Bar provides those condiments along with good old yellow mustard. It's a bit of a shame that no attempt is made to serve up house versions of those condiments. Maybe it's cost control, but it would be nice to eat the gourmet burgers without using typical foodservice condiments from Heinz and Kraft. To be fair, I asked for aioli for my fries and I was pleasantly surprised that I had a choice of garlic and chipotle.\n\nThe skinny fries (ordered separately, not included in burger) were good, although they could have been a lot hotter temperature-wise.\n\nThe onion rings (ordered separately, like fries) were quite good. Surprisingly so. In fact, I'd come back to this place just for the rings. The fat onion rings had an awesome panko breading batter that had a very nice crunch when you bit into them, the oniony innards releasing tendrils of steam.\n\nThe rings and fries were both expertly fried with good quality frying oil. Not a soggy fry or ring in sight. Kudos to the cook manning the fry station!\n\nI also tried the Caesar salad. Nicely executed. Good quality chilled romaine lettuce was tossed in a creamy dressing with a hint(?) of anchovies. The shaved parmesan added a nice kick to the salad. The wafer thin crouton slices added a nice crunchy contrast to the lettuce. I was surprised that the server didn't offer freshly ground pepper for the salad, but then again, it really didn't need it.\n\nI was eyeing a milkshakes and/or desert burger but the preceding burger, salad, and rings did me in. Perhaps next time.\n\nBoth bottled and draft beer lineup was decent, with a good selection of micro and macro brews. Wine list? Yeah, they have that too, but I couldn't be bothered. Their full bar is a nice feature for a place located in a prime location on Union Square. The Red Bull logo'd cooler in the bar kinda tells you who the targeted demographic is for the restaurant.\n\nService in general was efficient. The front of house hostesses were okay, going through the motions. They did their best to manage the quiet chaos in the front lobby. They could have been work release workers from Cheesecake Gulag Factory for all I knew.\n\nBurger Bar provides a decent dining alternative in Union Square to the madhouse cum tourist trap and formulaic corporate restaurant known as Cheesecake Factory. Oh hang on, Burger Bar is a formulaic corporate... At any rate, after a long day of shopping, you're probably going to get a table at Burger Bar in the time you manage to get one of those buzzer gizmos at Cheesecake Factory that starts your long-ass wait.\n\nOh, and I managed to get a dinner and a show on the night I went. Chef Keller was chatting up with guests and mugging for photos with starstruck diners. Bah. Gimme a break. I wished chef was in the kitchen checking on my burger before it was served to me.

It was conveniently located inside the huge Macy's at Union Square.  At 6:00 P.M., my friend and I only had to wait 5 minutes before being seated in the bar area.  We had a great view of the Christmas tree, ice skaters, and holiday lights outside, but it was dark, crowded, and noisy inside.  The music and and noise level was so high it gave me a headache.  As I walked to the restroom in the back of the restaurant, I noticed the booths had TVs on the enclosed end.  When we got to the restaurant, I was planning on having the $60 Kobe burger with foie gras, shaved truffles, and truffle sauce, but opted for a less extravagant meal.  There are several specialty burgers to choose from, but there is also the option of getting a plain burger and loading it up with a variety of toppings, including cheese, vegetables (both raw and cooked), other meats (bacon, foie, prosciutto), etc.  My friend chose the $12.75 Burger Bar Sliders with skinny fries.  Her trio included a buffalo with caramelized onions, Angus with bacon, and Country natural beef with American cheese.  All three burgers were cooked just past medium rare, and the fries were plentiful and crispy.  She also tried the pickled green tomatoes, but they were so sour they were inedible. I decided to have the $16.50 American Kobe beef burger, and added bacon, grilled onions, and sauteed button mushrooms.  My burger didn't come with fries, so I ordered a side of zucchini fries, which were just strips of battered and deep fried zucchini.  There was no dressing or sauce on my bun, but ketchup, mustard, and A-1 are available on each table.  I LOVED that I could order my meat prepared the way I like it, not the standard medium-well preparation at most burger joints.  The waitress said the rare is pretty true, so I ordered my meat medium rare.  It was cooked correctly, and the American Kobe beef was tender and moist.  The onions and mushrooms weren't seasoned well, and were a little on the skimpy side.  After eating half of my burger, I got rid of the dry bun and ate the meat and veggies alone.  It wasn't the best burger of my life, but it was good. The quality of the meat was obvious, but I don't think it was worth $20 (including my toppings).  I wouldn't make the drive from San Jose just to eat there, but if I was shopping in the area, I might stop by for a snack.  The milkshakes and desserts looked interesting.", "author": "Lorianne L."}

It then took awhile to be recognized as a new table, for a wait staff to come and take our order.

Then got our food from a food runner, which was just ok- but still... No inquiry about our welfare. If I wanted to just order without service I would have gone to a cafe....

Now I have to warn everyone, they claim to serve Kobe Beef burger, however, this isn't truly Kobe beef, its KOBE STYLE BEEF.  Authenticate Kobe beef is from Japan and would cost a lot more than $16.50 per burger.  The burger was good, not fantastic.  The sweet potato fries were AMAZING, very addicting.  I went through two orders just for myself.  My biggest complaint is the service.  It plain stinks.  Our waitress was pleasant to our face but barely came to our table.  She literally waited until all the tables in her section were filled before returning to our table and was snooty with my date over her request for non buttered buns.  In hindsight I should have given her a small tip.  Overall, I'm not returning to BB and would advise anyone that wants a good burger to go to the Counter in Santana Row before going to BB.

The burgers come a la carte...so we ordered french fries and deep fried pickles on the side.  The fries were just okay, but the deep fried pickles were just god-awful.  For some wacky reason, they batter and deep-fry whole dill pickle spears NOT the customary dill pickle chips.  I won't get into the semantics of properly making deep fried pickles, but needless to say it was basically deep fried batter covering a mushy pickle spear.  I only managed to eat one and got so grossed out that I couldn't finish another....  \n\nI don't know, maybe I'm wacky...but I thought my buffalo burger was okay but nothing stellar, especially since there was more bun than burger....certainly far below what I would expect from a Hubert Keller establishment.

However, after seeing the multitude of negative reviews, I wanted to wait a while for things to settle before eating here.  I've always felt it's sort of unfair to solely judge a place just after it's opened - of course there are going to be bumps in the road.  \n\nWell, it's now been a few months after they've opened, and I gotta say it's not bad at all.  There was a bit of a wait (on a Saturday night), but nothing horrible, and expected for a place with this much buzz about it.  Our waiter was attentive, and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  \n\nSides:\n- Fries  were very meh.  While hot, they still weren't crispy.  They really should fry them longer.  Pommes frites they are not.\n- Sweet potato fries were okay - still not that crispy, but better than the regular fries.\n- Fried zucchini - decent, but nothing to write home about.  Would order again though.\n- Onion rings - nice, lightly coated in panko, not too greasy.\n\nBurgers were a tad on the rare side, but still within the acceptable range (ordered medium-rare).  The meat wasn't overly seasoned, so you could still fully taste the beef.  My ciabatta bun was nicely toasted and lightly buttered with a nice crisp consistency (not uber-crunchy/crusty/chewy like some places).  Their bacon was ok, a tad on the chewier side than crisp, but that's a personal preference (I also prefer it a lot smokier).  Another thing of note is the Perigord truffle sauce has a rather light truffle flavor.  So if you order it, you probably shouldn't get other toppings with strong flavors which would completely mask the truffle flavor.  It's a thin sauce, served on the side in a tiny pitcher (and not a bad dipping sauce for the lackluster fries).", "author": "T C."}

I\"m trying to flag down our waiter but the person who served us was apparently not our waiter. In the meantime we're starving so we eat the regular burger which was good but not worth the price. We waited on the kobe because for almost $20 for that burger (not including fries) it better be cooked right. Finally, after about 25 minutes we get someone over and they didn't even apologize. They were just like \"oh you don't like this?\" and then it took him a minute to even think to offer to get me another one. Hello? where are your service skills. Second time around it was about medium well but at that point we just wanted to get out of there. I think the first burger was better.

I got the veggie burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. The veggie burger was cold and mushy, it had the consistency of oatmeal. There was no flavor in it was so ever. The blue cheese did nothing. It tasted closer to a queso, none of the good punchency that blue cheese usually has. The sweet potato fries were a joke. They were lukewarm with no seasoning. The size was also comically small, about the size of McD's kids size. It was so small I actually counted and there were only 22 fries. That is crazy when charging $3 and change.

Oh wait...the burger I had at Burger Bar didn't consist of GOOD ground beef or TOASTED bread. Darn...\n\nAnyways, to begin with, this place doesn't take reservations. It took us THREE tries to finally get a seat, so I was super excited to actually be able to have my fat butt (THANK YOU THANKSGIVING DINNER!!!) firmly situated on one of their bar stools. The first two times we went, we were told the wait was around an hour (too long, if you ask me), so we finally got in on a Monday night, around 6PM (five minute wait). \n\nWe got a table right by the window, so had a great view of the Christmas tree, pathetic-looking fabric Menorah, and the ice-rink.

When the burgers came, they looked quite impressive. It was cooked to perfection, medium, just as we had requested. The quality of the beef was OK - I've definitely had better tasting beef. The taste overall...hmm, I'm 100% sure I've had better, juicier burgers. Heck, a burger at Fuddruckers is much tastier, and it would have cost us half the price. The bun was probably toasted at some point in time, but they might have left it out in the cold, because it came to me...NOT WARM & TOASTY!!! The skinny fries are not worth mentioning...so I'm going to fast forward to my conclusion.\n\nWould I come back? Sure, but not for the burger. I'm really curious about their milkshakes. SF has too many burger joints to offer to really give me a reason to return to Burger Bar. A return trip would have to offer me a 5-star burger, not a 3-star poser.

She looked so hot from behind, with her perfectly tanned legs and smoking hot body. And once we got a look at her from the front, we perhaps lost a part of our appetite.

The buffalo burger patty was tasty.\n\nHaving said that  I am now hesitant to check out Fleur de Lys as the lack of attention to detail at Burger Bar was pretty surprising.  It was a weekday lunch and it wasn't crowded but the food was unloved.\n\nThe bun was somewhat stale :(  The grilled peppers weren't even lukewarm, they were cold.  The biggest crime however was that the tomato, lettuce, and onions that came with the basic burger were so pathetic.  Had I just gotten the basic burger I would have had a single mealy and tasteless tomato slice and a tiny piece of lifeless lettuce and a couple of rings of red onions.  Actually I might be overreacting but the tomato offended me.  If what they had to work with was so bad they should have oven roasted them or made a chutney.  \n\nThe pickled green tomato was also bleh and actually was the worst pickled veggie I've ever had.\n\nThere are some exceptional burgers in San Francisco and I am so sad this was not one of them :(  I was very much looking forward to this being my oasis when I'm with out-of-town guests or running around Union Square.", "author": "MJ C."}

Two drinks later we had built up an appetite! Our ADORABLE and HILARIOUS waitress (wish i could remember her name!... short, curly brown hair) had sold me on their signature burger, the Hubert Keller burger which was a med-rare buffalo burger topped with melted blue cheese, saut\u00e9ed spinach, and caramelized onions.  To tie it all together, it was served with a red wine shallot reduction. AMAZING!  My sister is an insanely picky vegetarian and was reluctant to even order anything but our waitress sold her on the veggie burger.  My sister opted for the \"build your own\" option and added pepperjack cheese, sprouts and avocado.  She said it was the best veggie burger she's ever had!

The service was pretty slow, but we were waiting for a friend so it was OK. They have a good menu selection - all different burgers including the $60 kobe beef burger with shaved truffles.  Um...we didn't have that.  We did go for the natural, the American Classic, and the Burger Bar sliders, all with skinny fries.  The meat was flavorful, the toppings were fresh, and the ranch was really good.  Oh, and you have to try the onion rings!\n\n2nd visit: My mom wanted to eat at a restaurant where we could see the Christmas decorations in Union Square.  The hostess seated us at a table for four near the bar with a perfect view of Union Square.  We all ordered different burgers - the natural, the angus, the kobe. All different toppings, all different fries - and we enjoyed them all.  The sweet potato fries were just OK.  I like the skinny fries better.\n\nOverall, probably one of the best burgers I've had.

They have a buffalo burger that costs 22.00 that my cousin raved about. She and her sister both ordered them.  I got the sliders (an angus, a country(?), and a buffalo) for 12.95.  The bf got the black jack which was angus with tepanade for about 13.00 also.  All of the burgers came with substitutable skinny fries. The bf & I got sweet potato fries (same price ), my cousins got the zucchini fries ($0.35extra) and the fat fries (same price i think).  They all liked their food.  The sliders looked super tiny, but they actually filled me up in the end.  I'd say their portion sizes are just right if you're hungry.\n\nOne of them also got the nutella shake which she let us try. It was really good.  Although, it was $9.00 and you don't get the extra silver cup to refill your glass when you've finished. Sad.  Again, though, if you have the money to spend and don't mind paying, then it's good.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to share two items: the dessert burger and the dessert cheeseburger?  Get the one that does not have chocolate ganache. The one with the cheesecake filling is really good, although the donut could've been less stale... hahha. It was $6.00 for each of the desserts.\n\nSomething cool was that they had a tv in each of the booths.  I see it as both a good and bad thing.. On the one hand, you get to watch exciting sports games, but if you want to have a conversation with someone, it might get too distracting.  I'm not sure if you can choose to turn the tv off... hehe.\nWould I come again?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-05", "description": "Oh, Burger Bar, I wanted to like you. I *really* wanted to like you. But alas, what an epic disappointment you were. I'm a huge fan of the gourmet burger fad that's sweeping the nation. When I was up in San Francisco this past Sunday, my tummy started grumbling while we were shopping downtown, so my friend suggested we grab a seat at Burger Bar. I didn't hesitate to say yes--gourmet burgers AND a celebrity chef? Yes, please!\n\nSo we made our way up escalator after escalator inside Macy's to get to the Burger Bar on the sixth floor. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, only about 10 or 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad considering the number of people waiting outside the restaurant. I was salivating reading the menu while we waited. Foie gras on a burger?!?! Truffles?!?! There was no way I was going to order either of these--I'd rather pay my rent--but the very idea that I *could* was so mesmerizing.\n\nI decided to order the turkey burger on ciabatta with Provolone cheese, caramelized onions, bacon and Dijon mustard, with a side of \"skinny\" thin-cut fries, but resisted the urge to order a milkshake. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait too long before our food came. But wow, what a disappointment. The turkey patty needed something to hold it together--it was dry and crumbly, falling apart with every bite I took. The bacon was a sad sight--I'd expected nice thick-cut gourmet bacon and got what looked like your average store-bought bacon, stringy and full of fat. The caramelized onions were still gray and needed to be caramelized longer to get that nice golden color and deep flavor. The Dijon mustard was fresh, with lots of mustard seeds, but had absolutely no flavor. I like my Dijon strong, you know, the kind that'll clear your sinuses with every bite? The Dijon I had was too sweet and had no mustard flavor! The fries were OK--nice and thin, but a little too salty for me. This seemed to be a problem with my meal as a whole, actually--both the burger and the fries were so salty I had to down like three or four glasses of water with my meal.\n\nWhen the bill came, as I'd feared, my meal hadn't come cheap. As other Yelpers have lamented before me, you pay for every side and every addition to your meal at Burger Bar. Let's take a look at the bill, shall we? The burger was about $11, but then you add 75 cents for the cheese, 95 cents for the caramelized onions, $1.15 for the bacon and a whopping $3.80 for the side of homemade mustard. By the time I was done tinkering with it, my\"$11\" burger came to $18. Yes, you read that right, almost $20 for a burger. Now I'm not one to skimp on the costs of food--I've routinely handed over $20 or even $30 for lunch--but I felt incredibly ripped off after my lunch at Burger Bar. I wouldn't bat an eye paying for the pricey burgers at The Counter, because they use quality ingredients, but the ingredients at Burger Bar didn't merit the prices.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the food that was a disappointment--the atmosphere was rather off-putting too. What I had hoped to be a hip, yet elegant, spot to grab a burger looked no different than a CPK or Chili's outlet. Some tables seemed very intimate, secluded in an alcove at the windows overlooking Union Square, then there were booths with built-in TV screens. We had the unfortunate luck to be seated in the tables in between, cramped close together in no-man's-land. These tables was rather perplexing, like Burger Bar didn't know if it wanted to be a hip fine dining spot or your run-of-the-mill sports bar, so they designed it to be both--but not really executing either one all that well. There was a cacophonic din of sports fans, loud conversations, a busy bar, screaming children and a busy kitchen. I'm not opposed to loud restaurants per se--but there's a difference between a loud restaurant with a vibrant, bustling atmosphere and the confused chaos at Burger Bar.\n\nI guess I should have expected as much from a restaurant inside a department store. But with Hubert Keller's name attached to it, I had hoped for better. But don't be fooled by a celebrity endorsement and expect a gourmet burger here. I've come to realize, despite its attempts to be haute cuisine, Burger Bar is no different from your average chain restaurant you'll find inside a mall food court. You can certainly find better burgers in San Francisco.", "author": "Raul N."}

Don't worry, it does come with lettuce, pickle, tomato and onion).\n\nThe burger had good flavor and it was thick  I only finished a quarter of it and took the other quarter home.  For $5/quarter you better not throw it away!\n\nRudy (bartender) was energetic and very personable!  He made our first visit enjoyable!!\n\nView was great and the restaurant setting was casual and sportsbar feel to it.  I can get loud in there.", "author": "R M."}

In fact, it was pretty good.  However, it really wasn't any better than a number of other burgers at nice restaurants nearby.  Like Burger Bar, those places offer high quality meats and other ingredients.   If it were just the food alone, I would give it 3.5 stars\n\nThe big differences? \n\n1. It doesn't cost over $20 for a burger at those places.\n2. Alcohol, while overpriced at those places, is exorbitantly priced at Burger Bar.  Seriously, an extra $2 surcharge for virtually every beer on the menu compared to other restaurants in the city carrying those beers.\n3. The ambiance.  It was sort of like a cross between a chain burger place and an upscale sports bar.  Great views of Union Square, but really, it felt less like we were in a hip restaurant and more like we were in an Applebees.\n\nSo that is why it is only 2.5 stars worthy.  It is good, but just not worth paying so much for what you are getting.  I mean, for two burgers and two alcoholic drinks it was $70.

We waited patiently and went through a few drinks. Luckily the bartender was knowledgeable so we didn't mind waiting. We even told the bartender that we were waiting for a table. We see three tables seated by windows and we wonder hmm those people just walked in.\n\nSo we walk over and ask if a table was ready since we saw three that were open. The hostess goes \"oh yes they are\". We look down and for no reason she had crossed us out. \n\nThe service from the waitress was just ok. \n\nNow the food. I've had a Kobe Beef burger on several occasions at different restaurants. This was by far at the bottom of the list. It was cooked medium yet still kinda dry. It was an ok burger.

I finally have a day off to do a couple reviews.  I have been suffering withdrawals lately, shaking and the cold sweats..Not good..\n\nAfter work a buddy of mine and myself wandered over here.  We had both never been here, and my phone was dead (couldn't check out the reviews on Yelp, I wish I had...)   We sat down looked over the menu.  We almost did the foie gras/kobe burger, but we both couldn't justify $60 on a burger.  I decided on a normal burger and fried zucchini and my buddy did something I didn't care to remember.  \n\nOk, now here's where it get weird. The server, a girl in the bar area, was a complete weirdo.  She never once smiled, said thank you, and was a complete automaton.  She would say, \"can I get you something to drink,\" we would tell her what we wanted and she would just walk away.  She did that for everything, \"Can I bring you anything else?\"  --\"Ranch, please.\"  and she would just walk away.  It was severely odd.  I didn't like it, I seriously almost threw a fork at her just to see if she would cry.  The burgers, I could have had a mimi's cafe or red robin.  There was absolutely nothing memorable or special about this place.  Well except for the price.  Let this be a lesson to all of you, just because the restaurant is owned by Hubert Keller doesn't mean a damn thing.  Next time I will get me some bottomless fries from Red Robin.  At least I know I will enjoy those and the service will undoubtedly be better than what I experienced here..I expected more...\n\n\np.s. the milk shakes are why this place gets two stars, damn good!", "author": "Shaun C."}

It's also great for groups of people that like different types of food because they can customize thier burger to thier taste.

I spot the waiter, give him a look.. he finally looks at the table and ding ding.. no food.. he goes to the kitchen and after another 5 minutes or so, YAY.. food arrived!!  Everything was hot, and very delicious... The waiter checks to make sure everything is OK...  we eat.. my Hawaiian (chicken) was really good!  And my partner got the low-carb made with Kobe he was it was also delicious!  \n\nThen we finish and he comes by to check if we need anything, our plates are almost empty and he doesn't carry anything away..

I wasn't aware until we ordered that it was Hubert Keller's restaurant. Being a big Top Chef fan, this excited me. I built my own burger and had the beer battered jalapeno pickles on the side. The pickles were TO DIE FOR. I'm salivating just thinking about them. Everyone at the table raved about the rest of their food as well and the service was pretty good. I also loved that there was a television embedded in our booth, though the channel never got changed for me. No biggie. It's a bit pricey but not surprising since it's in SF. There is a parking garage right across the street as well.

After another while, I told the host that I was ready to order. He took my order and went and gave it to the server. Said server brought me my drink. No water. Then he came back later to deliver my burger. And he disappeared again. No checking back on how you like your burger, if you need anything else, nope, nothing. While eating my burger, which was delicious by the way, I observed the restaurant. Same server brought water and chit chatted with two young blondes customers. Oh ok. I was not young, I was not blonde. \nAfter finishing my meal, I would like to order dessert. I asked about the dessert burgers, and settled on the Nutella burger. Said server brought me the cheesecake mousse burger. Then disappeared. I tried to get somebody's attention to have the dessert exchanged. ( the host took a little break, and the waiters took turn standing at the host stand, chatting). When the friendly host returned, I mentioned to him I was brought the wrong dessert. He went to get the server. The server asked me if I was ok with the cheese cake mousse burger ( which I started eating after all the wait! Out of exasperation!! ) and he offered to bring me a chocolate milkshake to make up for his mistake!! Oh lord, a burger, a dessert burger AND a milkshake?? Food coma guaranteed!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-03", "description": "I don't think Mr. Keller cares at all about Burger Bar... to wit, he has not acknowledged or responded to the following:\n\n\nMr. Keller-\n\nI just left a review of Burger Bar SF on Yelp... in it, I promised you a letter to be delivered at Fleur de Lys on Sutter.  This is that letter.  I feel compelled to let you know that I had the WORST experience of my dining life the other day at Burger Bar.\n\nMy friend and I walked in at around 4:00pm and after being promptly seated, my friend left for the restroom.  Shortly after he left, the server approached the table and asked if I had decided on my drink.  I pointed out that my friend was returning shortly and that I would wait for him to place my own order, but that water would be welcome.  My friend returned.  Five minutes later the water arrived.  A few minutes after that the waiter arrived with a blank look on his face and simply stood next to the table, saying nothing.  I picked up on his passive approach and said that not only did we know our drink order, but that the time we were left alone had afforded us time to decide on our burger choices.  I don't know why, but his silence was accompanied by a rather sour look upon his face.  My friend ordered the daily special (Union Square Burger), cooked medium-well, and a root beer.  I ordered the daily special, cooked medium, with fat fries, and a root beer; two exceedingly straightforward, easy orders.  Presumably a burger with a slice of cheese on it is no sweat for the kitchen.  Presumably a kitchen that cooks burgers all day long knows the difference between medium and medium-well... I would presume to believe this, especially in a restaurant bearing your name, Mr. Keller.  \n\nWhen the burgers arrived, my friend and I eagerly got started.  Neither of us had ever tried Burger Bar before, but both are fans of Fleur de Lys, and of you as a chef, Mr. Keller.  Clearly, our expectations were running high.\n\nMy burger was WAY PAST well-done.  It was grey as concrete in the middle and hard as a hockey puck.  My friend's burger was as I had pictured mine, on the pink side of medium, but certainly not as he had ordered, medium-well.\n\nWhen the waiter arrived at the table after a few bites to check on the burgers, it was with some hesitation that I asked him to look at both burgers and then told him that I believed that my friend had been served my burger and that the burger on my bun had been left on the grill for far too long.  How could he explain it?  At first, the young man was extremely defensive; this was followed (and made worse) by him arguing that my friend's burger was a perfect medium-well (despite the fact that it was a nice pink inside and had juices flowing out onto the plate) and that mine was well-done, as I had requested.  With his bad attitude, he failed to understand that your name would be dragged into the experience.  How could a Hubert Keller burger be so far from edible?  In any case, he plaintively looked at my friend, then at me, and slithered away from the table meekly, with a barely audible apology escaping his lips as he left.\n\nHe next showed up a good five minutes after we had stopped eating.  All the while, I was amazed that my burger was so grey, and so hard, but I ate it all the same.  I am not a huge fan of waste, so I would not have asked him to throw the burger away and build me a new one.  He should have at least offered to do so; he should have at least comped one of the burgers, if not both, or comped a free dessert, or offered a manager, or offered a gift certificate to come back again, or done SOMETHING other than sheepishly ignoring us the minute he realized we were not happy.  When he arrived at the table and looked at my plate, which I had emptied mindlessly because I was both starving and seething, he asked how the burger was.  I said to him, quite bluntly, \"This was the worst burger I have ever eaten.\"  He looked at my empty plate, then back at me, and said, \"Oh, I can see that... you must have hated it.\"  I replied, \"I don't find this funny.  I ate the whole thing fast because it was terrible and I was starving and you didn't offer to make it right, and you ignored our table.  All I want to do now is leave!\"  He was floored.  He obviously was not prepared for this.  \"What can I do?\" he stammered.  \"Now?  Not a whole lot.  That was by far the worst burger I have ever eaten, and now I want nothing more than to get out of here.\"  I was repeating myself to this obviously untrained kid, and he was making me repeat myself again, and again, and again.  I told him pointblank that I wanted him to do SOMETHING to rectify the situation.  He had no idea what to do.  He fumbled with something in his hands and finally said, \"I'll get a manager.\"  Did he not hear me say I wanted to leave, in a hurry?  I wanted to see the manager, so that was correct, but I would expect a manager to come over quickly.

I have to say, the burger I ordered (the sustainable beef patty, caramelized onions, aioli, etc. on an onion roll) was good, and cooked perfectly per my request, but was it worth the extra expense just to add whatever toppings I wanted? Not really. Some people find a thrill in the selection process, fulfilling their every desire by adding whatever sounds great in the moment, but in my group, that \"make it a Dagwood\" mentality seemed to be why we all felt like our burgers were too good to be true once we got to eatin' - things can get a little messy and flavors can be a little heavy if you don't really think about what you're ordering first. And it's not like it's a free-for-all. You can end up with a $30 burger if you get too crazy, which is money I'd rather spend on other things than such a basic and ubiquitous food item. Also, I always find it annoying when places serve fries as a side plate that you have to order separately from the main event; like they didn't charge ya enough for all the add-ons, you gotta buy your taters, too. Pssh. Service was casual and nothing more than what you'd get at any big name chain, not that I'd expect anything more, but with such an extensive menu, it almost seems like our server would have had more of a presence during the meal. Oh well. \nThough I still have a crush on Hubert and his vibrant gray waves, next time I feel like dropping some dough, I think I'll enjoy him at Fleur de Lys instead.", "author": "Danielle D."}

My only complaint was the whole wheat bun which could have half the thickness. Just too much bread for my taste.  The kobe beef burger was also delicious, despite the same issues with the bun.

It was a Tuesday night so the crowds weren't as bad as indicated in other reviews. Took us about 5 minutes to get seated. I'm not normally the kind of guy to go to an upscale burger joint, simply because most burgers are pretty darn delicious to me, but my friend wanted to try it, so we went. I just got the standard burger, which was very good. Got a side of sweet potato fries which were also excellent, although they were presented oddly, just dumped on a plain white plate. They could do something about the presentation here. \n\nOh yeah, and the beer list was extensive and I looooove my beer!\n\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and perky--all good things to say in that department.  She seated us in this hidden nook around a column, completely hidden from the dining room. While this might turn some people off, I rather enjoyed the privacy and we had our own perfect view of the square. Otherwise, the restaurant seemed like it could be a little on the loud side. \n\nOne downside--the interior is lacking in ambiance. White walls in a restaurant--what are they thinking?? They got some work to do on that front. \n\nSo if you  want an upscale burger with a great view of Union Square and don't mind paying the price, this is a pretty good choice.", "author": "kevin b."}

Burger Bar totally redeemed itself from my first visit.  I did have a few issues with Burger Bar.  The too cool for school tatted up bartender was a moron and knew nothing about the food or beers they offered and my burger was cooked medium not medium rare like I requested.

The burger wasn't flattened enough so it was barely over half the size of the bun and was so thick I had to cut it.  The grind on it was so large that when I cut it, it basically turned to ground beef on my plate.  Gross.  The meat seemed to be good quality and had good flavor BUT was over salted and overcooked.

We knew it would be busy since it just opened recently, and with a party of eight, we knew there could be a significant wait. We were told it would take about 45 minutes to seat us, which was fine -- but in the end it was more like 15 minutes. Excellent! I guess we got lucky that two adjoining tables happened to open up simultaneously.\n\nSince it was a birthday, we decided to splurge and go all out. I got the kobe beef hamburger with \"fat fries\" (aren't all fries fattening?) and a mint chocolate chip milkshake, which includes creme de menth (I think ... some sort of alcohol, at least).\n\nMy kobe beef was excellent, but a little too rare. I ordered medium rare and another friend ordered medium. Both of ours seemed pretty rare. Maybe it's the style to cook kobe on the rare side? It seemed to only be that way for those of us who ordered the kobe beef. Anyway, it was excellent but I would probably err more on the cooked side by ordering a medium or medium well in the future.\n\nI *love* that some of their milkshakes include alcohol. But it's not a lot. I really wanted to be able to change my FB status to say that I was getting tipsy on a milkshake, but the truth is, I'd probably explode if I drank enough milkshakes to get a buzz. However, the sugar rush had me trembling. That was one decadent shake! Another friend got a beer float. Not root beer, real beer. Actually, it sounds rather gross to me, but he enjoyed it. \n\nOne friend who came with us is vegan. (I know, why would a VEGAN go to burger bar? Because it was a birthday and that was the plan.) For people who don't eat red meat, there are many other options like salmon, lobster, and chicken. For vegetarians, there are other veggie burger options, but they include cheese so they aren't appropriate for vegans. There were a few vegan options, but they included some ingrediants that my friend didn't care for (like eggplant). But here's the thing: my friend told the waitress what sorts of things she liked and the chef whipped up something custom just for her. Now that's excellent service!\n\nSpeaking of service -- yeah, it was slow, but it was a super busy Saturday night with long waits. Any new, popular upscale restaurant would have the same experience. And you have to treat Burger Bar like an upscale restaurant, not a regular burger joint.\n\nI really wanted to try the chocolate burger for dessert, but we brought birthday cupcakes and we were already about to explode.

They put us in the hallway between the main dining room and the bar.  This area was too dark and made it hard to read the menu.

We order...Food comes... my order was correct and my burger was good.  My friend was given the wrong bun on his burger so they took it back and changed it.  Yes they changed it but they gave him a cold bun that was not heated or toasted in any way.  By the time they brought it back the burger was cold.  Service was lacking at best.\n\nMaybe my first experience was a fluke as the restaurant had only been open for a few months.  We returned for a second chance.  There was no one waiting when I got there so we were seated almost immediately.  The milk shake that the waitress told me had no tree nuts in fact did.  Thankfully I did not have an allergic reaction!  She exchanged it for another.  Both my shake and my friends were horrible!  They were no where close to thick.  Both \"milkshakes\" were more like chunky flavored melted ice cream.  Again, service was lacking at best.\n\nIn conclusion, Burger Bar is over priced for the quality of food they serve.

Best burger of your life, probably not, but then I do not think that is the point.  \n\nIt's taken me a while to get a table, a few weeks as I have better things to do than wait.  Third time was the charm for me, having tried opening night and of course not having a chance at all of getting in.  But on a quieter Monday 2 weeks in I finally did get a table.\n\nI opted for the sliders, and it was a good decision.  3 burgers, Buffalo with caramelized onions, Black Angus & Country Beef.   All are good, but the Country Beef is special.  I haven't a clue what they feed those cows, but it has to be some tasty crack because this is a damn fine baby burger.  When I come back I am having the full sized version, without condiments I would advise, you really need to savor this flesh, the way flesh should be savored...\n\nWhat better way to savor but with Chocolate.  The milkshake bar is sic.  I could gain at least 4 rolls on my belly tasting each one....my advice is to share.  I had the nutella shake, yes, the nutella shake, topped with whole hazelnuts and chocolate whipped cream.  Freakin thing must have at least a billion calories, so it counting is your thing, its not for you.  But for those of you into some decadence with your savoring, this is better than Agent Provocateur.\n\nThe down side to all this decadence, along with the weight you are going to gain, is the price. I mean sweet jebus there is a $60 Burger on the menu!  Even the sliders were almost $13 for three teeny tinys.  I like my lunches under 10 when I am not bringing something from home, so clearly if you want a bargain bite type thing this aint your joint.  But for a upper crust kind of burger experience, there is no place in down town SF like it, like any good indulgence and worth the splurge.", "author": "Helmut S."}

Staying in Union Square and shopping at Macy's when I stumbled upon in-store restaurant Burger Bar.  I was in the mood for casual and low maintenance, and it fit the ticket.  There is literally not much else on the menu except burgers, but they also have veggie, turkey, and chicken as options.  I got the turkey burger with grilled onions, and pepper jack and Monterey Jack cheeses with curly fries (they have at least 6 different types of fries to choose from.). The burger came out suspiciously quick, leading me to presume the patty was precooked.  Despite that it was average/good and not too dry.  The curly fries were really good!  I also noticed the couple next to me ordered beef burgers an they came out super quick as well.  I think this restaurant could move up to 4 stars if they grilled each burger fresh to order instead of pre-cooking.  It was an ok meal though for a good price and great view over looking San Francisco's Union Square.", "author": "Christine L."}

Everything looked and sounded great, but it kind of fell short on delivery. \n\nPros: Best part of my burger was the sauce I ordered on the side, the red wine shallot reduction. That with caramelized onions, was awesome.  I ended up just dipping my fries in it; I liked that better than the burger.  It's because of that sauce I gave this 3 stars. Also, service was really great and accommodating for our large family even when they were really busy.  Lastly, the nutella dessert burger sounds and looks strange, but we were curious so we tried it. It was so good. It's definitely a novelty, but it was tasty. \n\nCons: All of the fries we got were disappointing except the skinny fries. The others were cold and mushy. They tasted frozen. The onion rings were pretty good though. \nFor me the biggest disappointment was the kids meal. My son is not a big meat eater, so I ordered a grilled cheese. It was literally two end pieces of a loaf of bread with american cheese in between not even melted. Not even grilled! I ended up asking for butter so at least he would have bread and butter to eat while we ate. It was seriously that lame of a grilled cheese.  \n\nSo, you may like this place for convenience and that it's good for families and large groups, but overall SF has many tasty restaurants at the same price point that I would rather eat at.", "author": "Rhonda R."}

We waited in their empty dining room, watching football with many other people. We had seen them come in and call other parties around us. After 20 minutes, we asked them how far along we were, only to realize they had crossed our name off the list. \n\nNext, after ordering 2 burgers and some hot tea, took 20 minutes to just get hot water and 45 minutes to get burgers (one beef, one veggie). We ordered the burger rare...\n\nEach booth had a TV to entertain us while we were waiting for the meal. This was very good...except after football was over, it switch to cartoon cats for half an hour. We asked them to change the channel for us. They enthusiastically agreed to, but when the waiter left, it never happened. I guess he forgot. We stared longingly at other TVs playing \"5th Quarter\". \n\nThe burgers were not good. Beef was over salted and veggie had no flavor at all. If we weren't so hungry from the wait, we would not have eaten them. Very dissapointing. We would have sent them back, but then who knows when we will get fed. At this point we no longer trusted them.\n\nBusers were very quick about taking away our plates and cleaning up. However, not once did the waitress ever come back to fill our water. She avoided eye contact with us. She was very nice when she took our order though...just not aware of anything the guest might need after that.\n\nLighting was weird...would get really bright and really dark in 2 minute cycles for 5-10 minutes. Eventually it calmed down. \n\nWhen asking for the check, I asked for a comment card to let the owner know about our experiences here. I don't normally do that, because I don't like to cause a scene. She said there were no comment cards, or other way to communicate with the manager or owner at the moment, but offered us a business card instead to send a letter. It did not occur to ask her if I wanted to comment on a good or bad experience. I felt she did not care.\n\nAt that point, I decided since they cannot not convince me to return to this restaurant, I cannot help myself from warning others to stay away from this place. STAY AWAY!!!!!", "author": "Judy C."}

The service was terrible. I won't ramble on about how rude and uninterested my server was but I will share one gem: my quest for utensils. I ordered a side salad with my entree and when the food arrived i realized that I had no utensils. Looked around and could not find  any servers. Five to ten minutes later, someone walked by and I flagged her down and asked for a fork. She looked confused, said ok, then disappeared. Maybe five minutes later she walked by but didn't stop. A few minutes after that, my server came by to see how the food was. I asked him for utensils. He looked confused and said ok and walked away. About a minute later, some other guy came by with utensils for me. Now, I'm really not sure whose job it is to make sure that the customers have utensils but I don't think it's a difficult task to accomplish. I work in an office and my job description doesn't include cleaning the kitchen but if I'm in there and notice a spill on the counter, I will wipe it up because, you know what, it's not rocket science.

Had we known of the actual wait time, it might have prompted us to return on a day when our tummies would have been more forgiving of the wait (we were starving). In addition, they seated a couple that arrived after us before we were seated. We were also a party of 2 so I can only presume we got skipped. When I went up to the hostess booth to inquire, they seated us immediately. \n\nService issue #2: Our burgers were put on the wrong plates. That is, my burger was served with the side order that my husband ordered, and his burger was on the plate that had my side of fries. Thankfully we figured this out before they whisked the plates back to the kitchen. \n\nService issue #3: My husband ordered a beer when our food came and the waitress forgot about it. We managed to flag her down about 3/4 of the way into his burger to ask her about it. She promptly got him his beer and apologized. \n\nLucky for them, the burgers and the skinny fries were super tasty. This saved the day. \n\nOur server was nice and guided us appropriately with our order. The forgotten beer was the only issue. \n\nThe host approached us at the end of the meal and apologized for our wait time, so I appreciated that he recognized. \n\nBTW - our check came out to $50 for two burgers with sides, two sodas and a Shiner Bock. Definitely on the pricey side for a burger lunch, so just be aware of that. \n\nLike many others on Yelp, we love Chef Keller and FDL. We are glad that the food here is good and hope that the service will catch up soon.", "author": "Marcela R."}

I have been looking forward to going to Burger Bar after seeing the incredible photos on their website.  My group of three ordered a buffalo burger, veggie burger, a regular beef burger, sweet potato fries and fat fries.  Unfortunately, the evening started with bad service.  One waitress showed up promptly, took the drink order and dissapeared for a good 15 min.  Then another waitress showed up and asked if we would like drinks.  We told her we had ordered already.  She skirted off too.  There was some confusion as to who's table we were and about 30 minutes into it, we got our drinks.  Secondly, the food was just so so.  The burgers are pretty, but the taste is flat.  I had the veggie burger.  On the menu, it was described well and sounded scrumptious.  I can tell you that the veggie patty sub at Subway has more flavor and you can get a foot long with all the toppings for $7.  \n\nI wouldn't go back.

(yelpers of the world, unite!).  i came when they first opened. 11 am.  there was no wait. i got sat in the best seat in the house (the absolute center view of union square).  things were going real well.\n\nit was still early, so i was kind of in the mood for a \"breakfast burger\".  i chose swiss cheese, bacon, sauteed onions, portabella mushrooms and a fried egg on ciabatta bread (on recommendation from the server).  i ordered it medium rare. (i figured if this was \"sustainable beef ground fresh 2x daily i could afford it bloody). i also ordered a side of fried zucchini and a beer.\n\nwhen the burger came i immediately noticed that it looked amazing. (and the side of fried zucchini looked tiny).  to be honest, the ciabatta was not really fresh.  it kind of fell apart a bit (even before i cut into the egg--which i will get to in a minute).  the burger really looked good though. there was a little bit of blood juice at the bottom, which i think is amazing nowadays when so many places are too gd afraid to serve you a burger with a bit of blood. (SEE PICS)\n\ni cut into the burger and the egg burst (just as it should).  i took my first bite and i was in semi-bliss.  it was one of the best burger bites i have had in the city (or anywhere).  the meat was juicy. the bacon was thick cut and a tad bit chewy (yea i do not like super crisp, burnt to the core bacon on my burger, thank you, so i enjoyed the fact that it had a good bite to it, but didnt taste overcooked).  the egg was PERFECT. 'nuff said.  the veggies were there. they didnt add much (and for like 2.50 i thought they should have played a more substantial role...)  the fried zucchini were the second best i have had in my life (behind, only, burgertown usa in redlands).  what can i say? the food was really good. not amazing but really f'n good.\n\nnow the important part. the whole meal cost me like 35 bucks. more than id like to admit.  the burger was 21 bucks on its own. do i honestly think it was a $21 burger? no. it wasnt.  it was one of the best burgers i have had. but i also consider in-n-out's $5 burger to be one of the best i have ever had (now i know i am comparing apples and oranges-but still...)  i enjoyed it but it wasnt life altering. (the fact that the only life altering burger here would cost about 75 dollars kind of scares me).\n\ni will probably come back. to experience that $75 burger at one point in my life.  will i come back to eat here otherwise... up in the air. depends on how badly i want a semi overpriced burger that tastes great and a place that offers me an amazing view of one of the nicest places in sf.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-25", "description": "This review is more like a 2-2.5 star rating for me.  I went for the second time earlier this week and was disappointed with my experience.  It's a combination of things that led to my rating and they're coming from both occasions.  For the most part my breakdown is pretty simple:\n-1 for price.\n-1 for service.\n-1 for cold fries.\n+2 stars because the few times I came to Burger Bar I enjoyed my burger.\n\nTo begin with I think the location of Burger Bar is awesome.  Hubert couldn't have picked a better place but the restaurant itself is too cramped and gives off a feel of some cheap pub; it is awkwardly split in half with the hostess stand smacked in the middle.  I came here during Christmas, both times, so it was quite festive inside.  The dining area to the left is nice because it overlooked the big tree and ice skating area.  The second time around we were seated to the right of the hostess stand on the other end of the restaurant.  I wasn't a big fan of this spot because it was just dark and drab looking.\n\nAnyway my first time here, and to burger bar in general, was just horrible.  I wasn't too hungry and decided to go for their sliders with sweet potato fries.  The food itself was ok but I had issues with service.  The bitch seemed like she hated her damn job.  She kept rushing me to order and was obviously annoyed with the questions I was asking her.  Sorry if it was my first time there!  I'll ask all the damn questions I want.  Anyhow my fries freaking came out cold so I sent them back and asked for a new one.  She was pissed about this but I don't care.. don't bring me out cold fries, you fool!\n\nFast forward to Christmas 2010, a year later.  I really didn't think I was going to be giving Burger Bar my business anymore but I went to the one in Vegas and enjoyed my burger so I thought I'd give this one another shot.  Service was better but still not the best.  My sister and I split a build your own burger and added a side order of sweet potato fries and fried zuchinni.  My BF built his burger as well and added a side of sweet potato.  When our food came out we had a small asss portion of sweet potato fries on each of our plates and like six small pieces of zucchini.  It was a what the fuck??? moment, i kid you not.  How dare they send out these three side orders in that fashion and charge me an additional $12!!!  I brought this up to the waitress's attention and she brings me out ONE full order of COLD sweet potato fries- this brought back a past memory.  Anyway, then comes the bill and here I get charged for THREE full orders of sides when they only really brought me out 1.5.  I mentioned it to the girl and she took out one of the orders, but then replied with \"I thought we were cool when I brought out the extra fries\".  No, homegirl.. you bringing out one full order of what was supposed to be three full orders (to begin with) does not make us cool.  She swears she did us a favor by bringing out my damn order of fries.\n\nService in SF and Vegas are not the best and they really need to recheck their employees and do a major sweep.  They all suck and have major attitude.  My $22 burger was not worth the price and definitely not worth paying for crap ass service as well.  I don't care if its even just $12.  I spent $22 on just a burger and an extra $8 worth of sides, thats $30 fucking dollars... give me what I order.\n\nOh yea, its a bitch just to get to the restaurant.  They've got this one dinky ass elevator that takes forever to take you up and down.  The both times I went it was dumb ass packed with people in line trying to get in and out of the elevator.. how annoying.  I'm just going to throw in another deduction somewhere just for this reason. haha.", "author": "Reg E."}

It's true, I'll buy that big tub of concentrate and whip up giant 50 quart little league cooler vats of the stuff then guzzle it till my tongue turns black.  Despite (ha!) all that, I gotta give major props to the Other Keller and his undeniable burger accomplishments.\n\nSuper Fianc\u00e9' and I ate there on a busy ass Saturday while in mid-Groom outfit shopping quest so I was desperate for a nice distraction.  The initial vibe was less than stellar; reminded me of the Chiles in the Atlanta airport (busy, noisy, a lot of windows, those annoying barely big enough for two people mini-non-booths) but once the food came it all turned around.  I had the sliders due to indecision (3 different burgers, just about perfect) and Uber-Bride had the Kobe burger with a minimum of accoutrement.\n\nLet me pause here to qualify my high opinion.  I am fucking obsessed with hamburgers (right now).  For the last 6 months I've been scouring the galaxy (ok, the east side of SF) for burger excellence.  Burger Bar kicked me right in the mouth nuts.  The hot, buttered buns with just a dusting of toasty-ness.  Man, the bun can make or break the burger and, as we all well know, first impressions count for everything.  The bun is a 5 star thing; not too hard and chewy but not doughy and soft.  It didn't disintegrate under the onslaught of some utterly delicious medium rare beef (or bison in the case of one of my sliders).  Yow.  Good.  Damn.  If you've slogged through any of my other reviews you know I have a borderline medicateable fetish for proper proportions and this place had it in spades.  Fresh veg+light sauce+perfectly cooked juicy meat+Zeus crafted bun = Giddy, 1 year old playing peek-a-boo for the first time ever delirium.\n\nIt also didn't hurt that Hubert Keller himself was in the house running the show and stopped by to check on us.  For a celebrity chef the guy was tres humble and seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  I almost gave the place 5 stars based on his drop by but then the famewhore in my eyes faded a little and I realized we paid $50 (with tip) for two burgers, some interesting (but weird) deep fried pickles with jalapeno (NOT pickled jalapenos we were confused to discover), and a couple of drinks in what is, essentially, a Red Robin.\n\n... but oh those burgers!\n\n.... oh, and the service was really excellent but I might attribute that to the owner lurking around as there was a certain peripheral terror floating under every frantic inquiry into our needs.", "author": "Milk N."}

I would have if the burgers were cooked right.  The space of the place is second to none.  On the 6th floor of Macy's in Union Square overlooking said square with the view; the space is spectacular.  The selection of beers on tap is amazing, multiple flat screens for sports, and from what I could tell an extensive and impressive wine list.  Although I didn't partake in wine on this particular journey I could see the cellar from where I was sitting and if I wasn't driving that night I would have been very tempted to order a bottle.\n\nEverything that you could ever ask for in a restaurant, except for the fact that my burger was cooked awfully.  My wife's burger was cooked a little better but not by much.  \n\nWe ordered our burgers medium rare.  Hers came out rare.  Mine came out alive.  I mean that when I stuck my finger in the middle of the the meat it was luke warm.  The burger was not cooked medium rare or rare or at all.  I don't send food back to the kitchen.  I actually didn't mind that much that the beef was rare.  Contrary to popular belief it is not necessarily the worst thing in the world to eat raw meat.  In fact it doesn't bother me at all.  Anybody ever had Carpaccio?  \n\nWhat bothered me was that I ordered the food Medium Rare, not raw.  The quality of the meat was obviously good I can't justify giving the meal anymore kudos.  If I hadn't trusted the quality of the meat I wouldn't have eaten it.  For example had I been served that burger at \"bistro burger\" I would have eaten it.  But the guy that owns Burger Bar owns Fleur De Lys so I'm thinking that I'll be OK.\n\nAll in all I built my own burger and the next time I am going to choose one of the creations on the menu.  In fact fact I'm going to go and have the 60 buck burger with seared Foie Gras and Shaved Black truffles.

Really?\n\nOtherwise, the non-Kobe beef burgers were decent enough to satisfy the red meat eaters (mine was pepperjack, medium rare, served with a side of fries) and so were the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries.  There is also an option to create your own burger with whatever toppings you like - the only drawback is the risk of going overboard and ending up with a $70 burger.  Case in point: truffles on a custom-designed burger costs an extra $30! \n\nTo top it off, the view from our table of 17 was amazing - quite possibly the best seat in the house with easy access to bars and floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the festivities in Union Square, giant christmas tree, skating rink and all.  \n\nThe damage report of $25 per person for the birthday dinner was not bad - I could think about a gazillion other places that would set you back more than that and I would not have budged.

Unfortunately for me it was prom night, so I was stuck sandwiched between two cars in the parking garage. Took me about 45 minutes to find parking, and get to BurgerBar. Lucky for me the food was not served yet, and I made it one piece. I had a shared a burger which was delicious along with jalapeno fries and regular fries. I would go back there, but I would like to share my food since the portions are huge. Needless to say at the end of the night I was happy  with the food, but GPS had to bring me on the freeway to go home. I'm sure one can guess where my thoughts went from there.", "author": "Evelyn B."}

The wait was only 30 minutes. That was the only good thing about this lunch. It went downhill after that. \n\nOur orders took an hour to come out. At almost 3:30 pm, the restaurant was half empty. My sister inquired why it was taking an hour to get our orders, the manager said that they were short staffed in the kitchen, some of the chefs called in sick and that they were still waiting for the replacements. The manager was kind enough to check on our orders. She came back and said that the meal would be on them. \n\nI ordered the veggie burger and after waiting an hour for the veggie burger, I was given a cheeseburger. The server sent the cheeseburger back and I had to wait another 15 minutes for my veggie burger, which I thought was bland and was overpowered by the potatoes in it. \n\nThis was very disappointing. I have dined at Fleur de Lys and I thought this burger joint would be similar to Fleur de Lys, at least in service.

This is NOT a portobello mushroom on a bun -- the mushrooms ARE the \"bun,\" and inside there were tasty grilled peppers, tomatoes, and other vegetables.

My dinner date, a longtime friend in from the East Coast, was in town and staying in Union Square so I suggested this place. I arrived, and the host wasn't at the station, so I had to wait a few minutes. He seated us at this totally rad table overlooking the Square, which was great. Our waitress arrived like a second later, so we hadn't had a chance to look at the menus. I asked if they had half glasses of wine, since (cough cough lightweight), and she seemed confused, then said No. I said, because some restaurants (cough cough, GOOD restaurants) offer a 3 oz glass of wine. I ordered the angus beef burger with no bun, peppered bacon, avocado and chipotle aioli, and my favorite drink, a shot of Patron and a large club soda. I thought it was intuitive that I wanted the shot separate (so I could add as much as I like). It came in a medium glass *combined* that wasn't fizzy and was way too strong. :( Our waitress also disappeared so my GF didn't have her wine until after her dinner came. Dislike. My burger came, and it was fine, but definitely not mind-blowing. I think it had maybe one total slice of bacon. For $1.55 add on. I mean, meh. It didn't come with a salad or anything, just a few pieces of romaine underneath, and the avocado was about 1/4 of one. If that. My girlfriend had 2 glasses of wine and the sliders. Our bill was $78 with tip. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. There are a zillion places for burgers and most bunless burgers come with a huge salad. Like I said, I don't understand the appeal of this place.

So, I had to be patient and, as soon as I heard it was finally open, I nagged the same friend to trust me to check it out again.\n\nWhat a mistake....we really should have just walked the few extra blocks to Pearl's, where the burgers are consistently excellent and affordable.\n\nUpon arrival, we were told it was a 45-60 min wait.  So, we wandered Macy's for about 40 minutes and returned up to the hostess stand.  She brightly said, \"We can take you now!\"  I was very pleased, and then, for some unknown reason, stood for another 15 minutes at the hostess stand.  I interrupted her conversation with the other hostesses and asked why we were still waiting and she said she didn't realize they had to clean the table.  So, it takes 15 minutes to clean off a table.\n\nWe were brought to what may be the worst table in the place.  It was jammed up against a wall that jutted into the dining room and squished between other tables, but just a stone's throw from a window  seat overlooking Union Sq.  I asked the waitress if we could be seated in the window and she said it was a table for four people, and they had to hold it for that sized party.  I understood and sat at our crappy table.  Ten minutes later, they seated a couple at my requested table.\n\nAlthough we immediately placed our drink and burger orders, it took a good 20 minutes to get our drinks and then almost 45 minutes to get our burgers.  When I stopped the waitress after half an hour and inquired about the state of my burger, she flippantly said, \"We're really busy.\"  She then yelled out something about checking the burger's status as she walked away.  She never checked and, finally, the food came to us.\n\nMy burger was fine, the meat was good and it was prepared medium rare as I had requested.  I got the Country Natural, which is the sustainably farmed burger, and cost $.75 more than the Angus burger.  I was a bit disappointed in Hubert here, if you can provide the sustainably farmed burger, why even bother serving something else?  The burger was thick and the ingredients were good, but it was definitely nothing special--and in no way worth $15.  The sweet potato fries were fine (a bit thin), but without the chipotle aioli, they wouldn't have been as good.  We also both ordered the truffle sauce, about which I was super excited.  What a joke!  It tasted NOTHING like truffles and didn't even have a truffle aroma.  It was clearly just a mushroom gravy.  We brought this to the waitress's attention and she said, \"I'm sorry\" and walked away.  No offer to bring us another one, to see what went wrong, or to remove it from the check.  She then avoided us, as she filled the water glasses of the tables around us, but never came back to check on us or fill our glasses.  About 15 minutes later, a manager came over and expressed his regret that the truffle sauce was not up to par and shared with us that he thinks it's great and had it on a burger just the other night.  Hey cool guy, that's wonderful, my sauce sucks and that just rubbed it in!  He shared that they would \"take care of\" the sauce on the bill.  That was fine, and although overdue, was the appropriate response.\n\nThen, we got the bill.  The removed only ONE truffle sauce and, instead of the other, removed one of the orders of fries.  We were so annoyed and over this place, that we just paid the bill so we could get the hell out of here.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the decor is bland and chain-restaurant-like, and overall, unappealing.  \n\nNext time, Pearl's.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I went with the Kober beef burger, medium rare, with bacon, pepper Jack, and button mushrooms on an onion bun.  This burger was so good that it just about wiped away thoughts of my all-time favorite burger, the Shack Stack from NYC.  The beef was a tad over-cooked- it was more medium than medium-rare, but damn, talk about it being juicy, well-seasoned and flavorful.  You almost didn't have to chew any of the meat.  The onion bun didn't hold up particularly well to the juciniess of the meat (the bottom bun got soggy quick), but I loved the onion bits and salt on top.  The toppings were great- lots of button mushroom and the bacon was nice and crispy.  Try the jalapeno bacon if you can- you only get one piece, but the piece my sister got on her burger was fabulous.  We also tried the onion rings, the buttermilk zucchini spears, and the sweet potato fries- ahh, my stomach just growled at me.

Although the Kobe is just a tack softer meat, but it's a burger, so it's really not that much different.\nAll the patty was overcooked.  Medium came more of a Medium-Well, and the Medium-well came well done.

I have to say that so far, the best burgers I had in town are \"Bullshead\" on Ulloa near West Portal and Il Pollaio on Columbus Avenue in North Beach.\n\nI have actually been to Burger Bar a couple of times and was always mildly dissapointed, but thought hmmmmmmm....this is Hubert Keller.  And I think Hubert Keller is great.  I love Fleur De Lys- one of my all time favorite restaurants- ever.  \n\nBut today, I really was disappointed.  Two burgers- one the \"Low Carb\" and one \"Beef Angus Burger\" and a cup of Lentil Soup.  Total bill for two smallish somewhat dry burgers and a watery soup was $40!  I found the price shocking because the quality did not come close to matching it.  \n\nAlso, to pay a premium for a burger, I would also want perfectly crisp pickles and great greens.  Honestly the pickle was not crisp, and the dressing on the greens was impossibly salty.  \n\nAdd to that a somewhat unpleasant atmosphere.  On the plus side, the view from the seventh floor of Macy's overlooking Union Square is nice.  But the harsh music with the overpowering volume and strange music negates any chance of having a pleasant lunch.  What distresses me is the continuing belief that the  target market of 20 and 30 somethings cannot enjoy themselves without an unpleasantly loud and harsh environment.  \n\nThe service was no more than bringing the food and the check.  There was a total lack of warmth by the person who took the order with a somewhat friendlier demeanor by the people (bussers?) who brought out the food.\n\nI wish this were a better restaurant.

This is understandable - it's a new restaurant . . . it's very popular and the staff are still finding their feet.\n\nThe food was a big disappointment. I had a Kobe beef burger with swiss cheese and caramelized onion with 'fat' fries and a side salad. Hubby had the famous $60 Rossini Burger (complete with foie gras and black truffles - VERY fancy) and 'skinny' fries and we shared a nutella shake.\n\nThere were a couple of hitches with the service - we were brought a vanilla milkshake instead of a nutella milkshake and my salad came covered with dressing even though I asked for it on the side - but again, we can let this pass as 'teething problems' - and the waiter was apologetic and sorted things out very quickly.\n\nThe big problem was THE FOOD. We really wanted to like the food., especially since we saw the very imposing-looking Hubert Keller wandering round the restaurant. Surely with The Man himself at the helm, the food would be superlative? Sadly, we found the food sub-standard. There were many tough pieces of gristle and fat in our burgers. Isn't Kobe beef, supposed top be tender and of a superior quality? This wasn't. This was far inferior to premium burgers we had eaten at Orson, Slow Club, Zuni, or our favorites Bix and Mission Beach Cafe. Mo's Grille or even humble In-n-Out would not have the kind of unacceptably poor burger grinding exhibited here, and the fact hubby and I both had 4-5 pieces of gristle each makes it hard to dismiss as a fluke. Also the fries were sub-standard - not crisp,  not fresh-tasting, not evenly cooked - neither of us finished our fries and I didn't finish my burger (hubby felt obliged to finish his burger after spending $60 on it!).\n\nThe milkshake was lovely, though a bit on the sweet side (the mention of Nutella gives the game away) - we really enjoyed it!\n\nWe did complain to a manager about the burgers and were comped the milkshake, but were not offered any explanation for the unpleasant burgers.\n\nUnless the standard really improves or unless I can be persuaded otherwise, I will go to one of my regular burger places for my burger fix in future. Hubby says if you crave a decadent truffle burger, go to Bix instead (the ambiance there is MUCH better as well).", "author": "Writer G."}

I was so happy that you arrived in my City so I wouldn't have to fly to Vegas every time I had a hankering for your burgers.  I really hoped you'd live up to your reputation.\n\nSadly, it won't happen.  Not here, anyway.  I'll save my Burger Bar excursions for Las Vegas, where the SERIVCE is excellent and the FOOD is cooked properly... which JUSTIFIES the higher than average prices for burger joint fare.\n\nFirst Visit:  Just about a week after opening.  We waited almost an hour and a half (that's 90 minutes, Miss Burger Bar Hostess) after being told that the wait would be just 10 - 15.  In my experience, when the host says 10 - 15 for the wait-time, they are lying.  But because we were  in Macy's, and because our dining companion had just flown all the way from Hong Kong to see us, we decided to wait it out and browse the store instead of bagging the idea all together.  The server came out and took our drink orders.  20 minutes later, our drinks arrived and my friend who ordered a vanilla shake noticed chocolate sauce at the bottom of her glass.  When we were able to finally locate our server again (10 more minutes) to ask about the vanilla shake, we were told that yes, Vanilla shakes do in fact have chocolate sauce in them.  \"It's our fancy-wancy way of making a shake,\" she informed us.  Seriously? WTF.  The truth was, she didn't want to admit there had been a mistake and didn't want to go back to the shake station (which was probably slammed beyond belief) to fix it.  oy vey.  The rest of the meal was uneventful once the food finally arrived (47 minutes after ordering) and nothing stood out as either good or bad.  I was disappointed.\n\nSecond Visit:  My Birthday, about a week and a half after my first visit.  I ordered the Fancy Wancy shake (just to test them) and it came out as a plain vanilla shake.  No Chocolate sauce.  No duh.  I ordered a veggie burger *with bacon* and got a look of consternation from our server.  Service again was  s l o w.  Had to ask three times for water refills.  A lot of staff walking around but not doing much of anything.  My burger arrived cold.\n\nThird Visit:  just a week ago, having promised another friend I'd go with her.  The wait was 40 minutes.  Our server didn't seem to know anything about the menu -- what brand of ice cream they used for the milkshakes... are the rolls and buns house-made?  I waited 15 minutes and had to remind her twice of my iced tea.  My sweet potato fries arrived cold.  \n\nSo that's it.  I've had it.  I won't be going back.

Nothing about the experience at this place is worthy of five stars, and I'll make an argument for my one star.....\n\nWent for solo lunch today, Oct 19 around 1pm. Was told it would be 30 minutes or I could grab a seat at the bar when they were free. The only place to wait is outside, so unless you hover (which I find annoying) the bar option is a melee. In fact, I kept checking back to the bar and the hostess pushed at least three other parties into seats at the bar ahead of me, despite the fact that I was there first. So, strike one - don't make people fight it out for the bar. Keep a list.\n\nFinally seated and waited a few minutes for waitress. When I asked her opinion she said \"we don't get to eat the food here, so I can't tell you. I'd have to come in on my free time\". Holy WTF? Hubert - really? It would take a pre-service meeting to cut up a few burgers to get your staff up to speed. Shame on you. Big big big strike two.\n\nDecor was disappointing too. Incredibly generic. Nothing about the place had any personality. It felt like an ill-placed sports bar that was completed in the 90s. Bleh.\n\nBurger took 20+ minutes to arrive. Bun was soggy on the bottom (I ordered the standard angus with \"crisp\" bacon and skinny fries). Bacon was equally soggy, so much for crispy. Fries weren't well salted. Just ok. Burger meat was ok, but really nothing better than your average TGI Fridays or other crappy chain. If Hubert is gonna put his name on something, I want an exceptional burger, well-seasoned and served with appropriate fixings. Shame shame.\n\nConsidering the cost, it was a disappointing experience.  Hubert was there, and I was impressed by that. He made rounds and shook hands. But maybe he needs to get in the kitchen and revamp the burger process, train his staff and add value to his chain. I assure you there will be more reviews like mine once the real guests start eating and posting. Too bad.\n\nGo to Mission Burger for a better experience!", "author": "Shaka Z."}

We put our names down at 7pm and left at 11pm. \n\nOther than the guy who came to refill our water, nobody else paid much attention to us. The wait for a table was long, about an hour and a half, for ten people. They won't take reservations for less than 13. That makes no sense to me. I witnessed two tables complain while waiting, now I know why. I even overheard someone say she was \"babysitting\" the staff because they didn't know what they were doing. Nice. Obviously she didn't know what she was doing either because there were still complaints.\n\nThe food was ordinary. They need to learn to cook hamburgers and serve them at the same time. 2 burgers came out of the kitchen and it took at least 10-15 minutes for another 6 to come out. The order still wasn't complete, we were still missing 2 burgers. They kept getting the orders wrong AND didn't even know what the burgers were when you asked which was which. 4 our of the 10 burgers were not cooked properly. One burger was asked to be cooked rare, it was well done. Three asked to be cooked medium well, it was cooked medium to medium rare. We would have sent them back, but we were starving and would have waited an eternity for new burgers. Their only saving grace was their milkshakes, thus the one star. It was a pretty good milkshake, but it took about half an hour to make. It's a milkshake for goodness sakes, were they milking the cow in the back?! They still managed to get one of the two milkshake orders wrong. \n\nI understand that gratuity for large parties is usually added onto the bill. The problem was, they told us it was added, but it doesn't say so on the bill. There's a line for gratuity as well. So, if the waitress didn't tell us, we would have paid an additional tip on top of what they felt they deserved. 20% in my opinion was way too much for lousy service, a long wait time (table & food) and not knowing how to cook a burger.

Ah the trickery!!! \n\nOne would think that such an established name as part of the equation, it would be easy to establish an eatery that was able to function. Nope. Friday, 1:30pm, end of the lunch rush and the chef has to close the kitchen for 20 minutes because they can't get orders out. No, not a fire, not a service person stabbing themselves, not a flooded bathroom or \"we've run out of meat\" or anything like that. Just the plain old I wish I were Gordon \"SHUT IT DOWN\" Ramsey act of simply not being able to get food off the service line. We stick around to watch the train wreck since its a slow day at the office...The 18 year old front of house tries to dodge the angry special sauce/lettuce cheese masses. No fewer than 10 tables sit empty for over 10 minutes. The \"manager\" does her best frightened bunny imitation and stays in back, looking out over the place from the safety of the service window. No effort is made to comp or pacify those who stick around for a seating, although people ordering take-out are being given milkshakes in a sinister tease. \n\nFinally a table, finally an order in, finally service. I've seen better presentation at Bob's Big Boy, but I'm not holding that against them as this is a BURGER place. But I still feel that there is a gap that needs to be closed between the wilted lettuce and the fact that there's a $60 burger on the menu. Our orders are undercooked, my burger has the wrong bacon, which quivers as the plate is literally dropped in front of me. Sweet potato fries are cold, and while there's always a certain amount of limpness associated with SF, never would I make that a positive attribute of Onion Rings...My milkshake, which is what earned the 2 stars, was an interesting effort.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-17", "description": "I have to be a little critical of BB since 1) it's a brainchild of Hubert Keller, and 2) b/c it is from Hubert Keller, expectations were higher, and 3) $16 base price on some of the burgers demands matching quality. And so sadly, and honestly, I've really had better burgers.\n\nWhere BB could have been better:\n- More preset combos: While custom designing your own burger can be cool, BB should offer more pre-set designs. Why? Because it guarantees a tasty combo. \n\nOur group opted to venture out on our own creation. American Kobe with Avocado ($16.50 + $1.55) on sesame bun. While the meat was cooked just right (medium - still pink in center) and the kobe was tender, it lacked flavor. You would have needed a couple of other toppings to make the burger taste more interesting. Otherwise, it's just ground meat.\n\nWe also tried the Salmon Steak ($8.50) on wheat. It was really boring. With no added toppings, it was doomed to dry failure. \n\n- Need softer buns: Ok, what's the point of choosing the type of buns, if they all are overly thick (out of proportion with the meat) and dry. I expected super fresh buns, toasted and soft. These were not. We ended up tossing the buns aside, and not for carb reasons.\n\n- Need Experienced Service: Maybe it was an off day, but we got a server who didn't seem to know how to take orders or remember what we ordered. Again, for an establishment with HK's name on it, we expected the best and it wasn't.\n\nWhat Made it Bearable:\n- Plenty of seating: We came just before 7p on a weeknight. Had no problems securing a table. No waiting is a plus.\n- Rockin milkshakes. We split the black and white shake and it was very tasty. Thick rich vanilla ice cream blended with oreos made this a delicious favorite.\n- Burger Bar Sliders ($12.75): You get a tasting of 3 meat - Buffalo with caramelized onions (good tasting meat complemented by the sweet onions), Angus w/ bacon (anything is better with bacon), and Natural beef w/ cheese (anything is better with cheese). It's a great way to taste the different meats and with a touch of paired topping. And the order comes with fries of your choice, while the a la carte burgers require additional ordering.\n- Cheese Cake Donut ($5.75): Thought this was a creative twist. They take a glazed donut, split in half and sandwich creamy whipped cream cheese in the center with thin slices of pineapple. The \"cheesecake\" center had a tangy note and made a nice contrast to the glazed sugar of the donut. The whipped cream mouse with almond ears and chocolate eyes was cute as it appeared he was chasing down the donut.\n\nOur total tab with additional orders of skinny fries ($3.35) and onion rings ($3.55), 1 milkshake, 1 dessert, 3 burgers, 1 soda came to $26 (with tip) per person. It's not exorbitant but do you know how many In n Out burgers I could have gotten instead?! I give BB a 2.5 stars.", "author": "Cindy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-04", "description": "I really wanted to like this place.  I mean seriously, after I went on a trip to New York earlier this year, I've been searching for a burger place that can meet up with NY's standards.  So I heard about this place because of a friend's bday and I never knew there was such a restaurant inside Macy's let alone a restaurant from restaurateur, Hubert Keller famous for Fleur de Lys, which has been mentioned in pretty much every review on Yelp.  So anyway, I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I was very disappointed.\n\nFirst off, I know I'm in a Hubert Keller restaurant, so it's going to be a little pricey, but I find it hard to justify paying more than $10 for a burger.  And if I am paying more than $10 for a burger, it better be damn good because I've had plenty of burgers cheaper than that to satisfy (heck, a Six Dollar Burger that's less than $6 at Carl's Jr. can sometimes do me good).  So the price supported my mind that this burger experience is going to be the one that I'm looking for.\n\nI order from the \"Chef's Burger\" side and being a little tight on cash at the moment, I order the Black Jack Burger, which looks to be a pretty classic burger but with tapenade (yeah, I didn't know what that was, and even my web browser thinks I misspelled it, until I tasted it, and it tastes like chopped olives), so I thought this should be a safe bet with the extra savory flavors that I'm paying for.  The wait time was decent, the place was packed and I was at a table with 14 people, but the service was fine.  I get the burger and my impressions are good... the garnishes looked the freshest I've ever seen with everything cut perfectly for you.  The patty looked pretty standard and I added ketchup and mayonnaise on it and put the burger together.  I took a bite.  I took another bite.  And another bite to be sure.  And that's when I got verified that this burger tasted no different from any other burger I've had before.  I would go as far as to say it tastes the same as a burger from Chili's or Red Robin or TGI Fridays.  I mean, it's not a bad burger in any way, but I was so disappointed from all the visceral hype I gave myself when sitting down in this fancy burger joint.  I asked my fellow adjacent guests about their burger and they all felt the same way.  Oh, this burger also came with fries, but nothing really to note here... it tastes like your typical french fries that you can get anywhere and I would still rather have McDonald's fries over this one.  I was definitely not feeling it that night.\n\nAn upside though, I got one their $8.25 shakes, I got Black & White, and that was pretty damn good.  The shake wasn't overly thick or overly sweet and that was the only thing that gave me enjoyment of the meal and the 2 stars for this review.  Though, I thought it was a little weird with the consistency because someone else at my table got the same shake, but the difference being that mine had chocolate chips on top while the other didn't.  Just a little detail that I noticed, but otherwise I'd recommend the Black & White and there was another with alcohol (forgot the name) that tasted even better.\n\nIn conclusion, I expected so much, but nearly all my expectations were crushed and I am yet to find a burger place to fill in my void ever since I went on that NY trip.  I really wouldn't spend my money on a burger here where I can get virtually the same burger down the street for half the price.  I would even say In N Out burgers were better than here.  I'd be open to try it again with a different (and unfortunately more expensive) burger, but if that doesn't meet my expectations, then I have no choice but to update my review with a 1 star, no matter how good the shake and atmosphere is at the place (the place does have an awesome view of Union Square).  This doesn't give me any negative impressions for Fleur de Lys, I still desire to go there one of these days because I'm sure that can't go wrong, right?", "author": "David Y."}

The sweet potato fries were presented in this cute metal container and they were mostly good with a few old, dry pieces here and there.  I also had a martini which was ok.  The waitstaff asked me if they could clear my plate at least on 3 occasions even though we were still eating and the restaurant was near empty.  2 stars for some ambiance and views--waitstaff were too eager for my tastes.

Talk about tardy! I mean . .. ! Now that it's open, I'm so glad, so glad that I now have a default eatery down in the Square, Westfield notwithstanding. I mean, one can only eat so many cream puffs, right?! I finally bit into burger heaven pleasure last week with my girlfriend and others. We met there for one of the world series games shortly after 5pm. The place was large and surprisingly empty, but it was early and a weekday after all, so no worries. Oh there's indeed ample of space, which I didn't expect, and plenty of natural light, an entire wall is glass, looking out onto Union square six levels below. Hii, shoppers!\n\nWe initially hunkered down at the bar and were instantly engaged in light conversation by the friendly bartender, who gave us a brief skinny on the spot. We had a good reposado tequila while waiting for the others to show. We admired the full bar replete with I believe four rows of top notch liquor - always glad tidings of joy. \nOnce our friends arrived, we moved on to a booth. The great thing about their booths is the high def television set right into the booth. Although there's no sound, it was great to be able to watch the game right at the table while we drank what must be drunk and puzzled over our orders. Now everyone that's been to BB in Vegas knows the drill: Build your own juice gourmet burger. They've got some very notable fixings, my fave being anything with truffles. Don't know if I'll ever choose the foie gras, though I love the stuff. I think I'd explode if I did. \nSome day perhaps. Their patties are thick and juicy and delicious. The best element is the quality of their beef. You know from the first bite, trust me. You'll never stoop to In'n Out again! Expect on road trips, that is. Home Run, Burger Bar! \nFor my next trip to BB: The milk shake bar! The bartender told us their shakes are off the hook awesome. Best part: you can spike your shakes with liquor! Smooth. \nOther perks: great beer selection! \nOn the low: I wish they had more interesting appetizers, but can forgive them. After all, it's burgers & fries, c'mon ! \nBe prepared to spend the cabbage at this joint. It isn't Sonic. But it's worth the cost.

However, this place opened two weeks ago and they still have some kinks to work out. Thankfully, they made up for some of it with a round of martini's on the house (which helped).\n\nMy husband and I both built our own American Kobe beef burger. Man, that beef is tasty. It probably would have tasted better if they hadn't over cooked our  \"medium\" requests into well-done.  However, overall a really great burger. \n\nService is a bit spotty, and probably due to the immaturity of this group working the restaurant. Our waitress seemed more interested in turning tables than selling us expensive burgers and drinks. It's frustrating to signal down your server for water refilling when your glass has been empty for 10+ minutes. It's also not great when the server finally comes over to ask us for our order, but fails to ask if we need another cocktail (hint: the empty glasses sitting at the edge of the table, closest to you, is your clue).  During our meal, two tables over from us, a glass falls and shatters on the ground. I wonder out loud how long it will take this staff to clean up the mess. Most seasoned restaurants would get the mess picked up before the glass hits the ground. It took the staff at Burger Bar about 15 minutes. So yes, service needs improvement, but overall I think this is a great place to check out. Service in a newly opened restaurant can only improve (well, it should). \n\nAfter our meal we could not resist ordering the dessert burger which consists of glazed donuts (the buns), chocolate ganache (the beef), gelatin-ized passion fruit (looks EXACTLY like american cheese!), mint (the lettuce) and some whipped cream. The p-fruit pretty much overpowered the whole taste, but I really appreciate how cool the desert looked. It really looked like a burger!  Once we peeled off the passion fruit, finishing the plate was no problem. \n\nIn the end we dropped about $60 for two burgers and a dessert. I would do it again, definitely. I understand that opening a new restaurant can have it's problems and I  was happy to see management pop for some drinks for our troubles.  In the end, I feel we got our $$'s worth for some great food. Highly recommend.", "author": "Alison A."}

I love his cooking shows on PBS and then his appearance on Top Chef Masters just made me like him more. Ever since Burger Bar opened in Las Vegas I have been craving something special from this concept. So, when the Union Square location opened I was so excited! Well, I have to say I am extremely disappointed. It may be that my expectations were too high, but my experience there was a huge let down.\n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere is decent. Kind of like an upscale pub meets ice creamery but without the warmth of a real pub and without the welcoming feeling of a creamery.\n\nNext, the service. Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. There was no spring in his step, no feeling that our satisfaction was his priority. Timing from the kitchen or from our server was way off too. I ordered a milkshake with my meal and I had finished the shake by the time our burgers and fries were delivered.\n\nLastly, the food. It was ok. That's it. Ok. For $51 tip included for two people I expected a lot more than ok. The shake was great. I ordered chocolate and it came topped with real whipped cream and had hot fudge swirled down the side of the tall fountain glass. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came to me cooked medium. It was just ok. The meat needed sone basic seasonings like salt and pepper. The overall effect of my bacon cheese burger was off the mark. All the ingredients seemed high quality, but the net result was not quite there. Too dry and not enough flavor.\n\nLike others have said, I've had much better burgers for a lot less elsewhere.\n\nThe French fries too were not great. I was expecting twice cooked French method French fries. But what I got were just regular old fries. They were cooked ok, but they didn't have the depth or texture of fries from places like Cafe Maman or Cafe de la press.\n\nIt's funny, I went around the corner of our booth to retrieve our son's stroller and literally bumped in to Hubert Keller. It was great to see him there but I was so disappointed with our experience that I acted like I didn't know who he was so I didn't have to go into how not great our meal was.\n\nI will not be going back to Burger Bar again unless something drastic changes there.", "author": "Rob W."}

I'm not one to say that I've had a perfect burger ever in my life and I'm not about to think so now, but since my boyfriend can appreciate a good burger, I can't say no to that.\n\nWe were seated immediately close to a window (can't expect everyone to have window seats, can I?) and was greeted by our waiter not long after (As a side note, seeing a hot waiter with a t-shirt that says \"Fresh Meat\" almost made me feel like I was at a male Hooter's for a good several minutes, not that that's a bad thing ;)).\n\nMy boyfriend saw \"beer floats\" on the menu and asked the waiter what that was about and he explained to us what they were in detail and since my boyfriend and I were on root beer float binges for the past 2 months, he decided to give it a shot since it was far too unique not to.\n\nI went with the American Classic that is a Black Angus burger with crispy bacon along with the typical sides (red onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickle) and I decided to add in avocado as well, it also comes with shoestring fries. My boyfriend order the Kobe burger and built his own along with a side of onion rings.\n\nThe beer floats came to our table first and the waiter patiently explained each float; there is about 7 in total, each with a liquor and ice cream of its own. My boyfriend liked it ok, I didn't (I don't drink alcohol).\n\nOur burgers arrive and I immediately start panicking looking for the mayo and to my despair, there is none. I know, I know, you're thinking I shouldn't drown anything in mayo but I'm part of the elitist 2% part of the population that believes that you can never have too much mayo. Anyways, it's no big deal, but I really did wish I had mayo. I try the fries and they were cooked perfectly, I couldn't ask for much more. I asked my burger to be cooked medium-well and it got to be well-done. I actually prefer it well-done, I just don't want it dried out hence the medium-well, so it actually works towards how I wanted it.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend ordered his medium-rare and his was close to medium-well. He showed the burger to the waiter and the waiter agreed and took it back immediately and had a new one brought out (although probably a good 10-15 minute wait). After getting his new burger, it was still a bit on the overcooked side, probably closer to medium than medium-rare, but he decided to let it go. His onion rings were done very well though along with a very nice batter.\n\nWhile eating, I peered over to a table not far from us and it looked to me that it was a sundae and I just had to get one since it looked too good not to. To my disappointment, what she got wasn't a sundae but it was a milkshake! A heads up, don't get their sundae. When you're paying 7 bucks for a sundae, you expect a sundae, but this was a scoop of ice cream with an additional charge for toppings. But whatever, it was my own fault for assuming that she got a sundae; if I come back again, the milkshake is definitely on the list.\n\nAll in all, the bill came out to be about $80 with tip, it's definitely much more than I was prefer to spend on a meal with a burger. It wasn't great and it's not a place that I would be craving for any time soon but I wouldn't say no if I had to come back again. Oh, and one more thing, there's a split charge for like all the items on the menu, I'm not exactly sure what the etiquette is for charging for a split charge but when I'm shelling out 80 bucks for a meal, I am not a happy camper having a split charge on my bill. Now, it's not like it happened to me because the waiter was kind enough to tell us that the \"split\" button on the machine was out of order when we asked about it but that is a tad ridiculous if it did work.", "author": "Richard C."}

Party of 4 please?\n\nOnce we stepped out of the elevator, the familiar ambiance of Burger Bar LV (with an SF twist of course) instantly greeted us.\nIn my opinion the space is noticeably different (in a good way), they managed to still capture the signature style of Burger Bar Las Vegas, but with a SF feel. I totally didn't feel like we were in Macys. The lighting was much more soft and relaxed and the music was hip and I could very often hear local artist in the play list. \n\nWe scored a window seat and our waiter was nice to look at and very informative. He was not your usual over bearing opinionated \"I tried this... this is really good ... everyone likes this ...\" suggesting things without being asked kind of waiter. He instead explained the menu in a very inviting way, in a way that made us want to try everything. \nIf you have yet to visit B Bar, I find it unique and quite cool that one side of the menu are Chef Hubert Keller's personal creations, and the other side of the menu is for you to build your own burger, with only the best ingredients of course. \n\nWe were surprised to see world renowned, famous King of French cuisine, Top chef Masters Finalist, behind the milkshake bar whipping up a milkshake or two. You gotta love it! Of course we took advantage of the photo op and he openly and genuinely answered the girl's questions regarding \"Top Chef Masters\" and shared a quick story about  their favorite episode. It was nice to see that he is just as cool in person as he appears to be on TV and especially as cool as he is behind the ones and twos (DJ booth). \nWe ordered a sampler of fries (still can't decide which is my favorite). The girls order Kobe beef burgers and giggled in excitement the entire time while eating. I decided to build my own burger with Kobe beef, BEST BURGER YET (aside from my usual out of this world Rossini of course). My girlfriend ordered Chef Keller's Surf and Turf, after a taste, I must admit that her burger out weighed anything I imagined it would be, so delicious and so divine. \n\nWe bought a cookbook for my daughter, and chef Keller personally signed it. I hope next time I return that I'll have a martini in one hand snapping my fingers to the beat of some cool ass house music that Chef Keller is spinning in that cool private room they got over there. \nStill wondering about the negative Yelp reviews I read, maybe they were expecting something a little more IN and OUT??

Whenever we opened a new restaurant we would do a mock run where we invited vip's and provided food for free so that the staff could get a feel for how things were going to be. After that we would staff as many floor managers, trainers from other sister restaurants, bartenders, waitstaff and busers as we could for the next two weeks so that we were prepared for the rush of a new restaurant. This all makes sense right? First impressions are everything right? \n\nWe went to Burger Bar last night at 6:30 and were disappointed that the simple things are not happening yet. Understaffed, the staff that was there were totally stressed out, they didn't know the menu, I never saw a floor / front of the house manager even once, the hostess was unorganized and flustered (there was only one so she had to check people in and seat them and do table checks to see which tables were available to be seated). Another hostess did show up during the madness. Furthermore there was no teamwork amongst the waitstaff and they were all getting double and triple sat (plus the bar was getting slammed at the same time and the bartenders seemed like they were fresh out of bartending school with zero experience). The bar was dirty with plates and glasses for a good 15 minutes while we waited for our tables. Our drinks took 15 min and our burgers took 30. Not so bad for a flustered stressed out staff . The burgers were pretty good and everything seemed to be a pretty good value for San Francisco. \n\nMy main gripe here is the fact that on an opening first week the staff seemed really weak and stressed out because there weren't enough of them!

While waiting for our food, I saw several orders of fries coming out in decorative metal coned shaped baskets. But, when ours finally arrived (after inquiring our waiter about the length of wait for our food), they were just thrown onto 2 small white plates & they were COLD!!!! We complained to someone (not our waiter because we could NEVER find him!), they apologized & told us the fries would be deducted from our bill (BIG DEAL!)\nAfter another 15 min., our main course finally arrived...My son had the Peppercorn burger which he said was ok, my husband had the Angus burger & that was ok, my niece ate the Salmon burger which she liked & I & my sister-in-law both had the Cobb Salad which we thought was pretty good. But is that enough to go back? I don't' think so &I don't want to be discriminated again like that. We'd also noticed that 2 other parties who were seated AFTER us were served before us & even left before we'd finished our dinner. \nI'd eaten at Fleur De Lys before & that was truly a memorable experience but unfortunately, it wasn't that way at Burger Bar.

We both ordered the American Kobe Beef Burgers \"as is\" so we could taste the fabulous beef.  The manager came out a little while later to let us know that it would be a bit longer as they would need to re-cook our burgers.  We were catching up so it wasn't a big deal.  We had both ordered our burgers medium.  When they arrived mine was a bit less cooked than my friend's and I thought both looked a bit fleshy to be medium, I would have judged them to be medium rare.  I asked if they could just cook it a bit more and they did.  It came out alright but I can't say I noticed any particularly great flavor and really wish I hadn't spend the extra $7 on the Kobe.  In hindsight, a steak would have been a better way to experience Kobe beef.  They offered us free dessert for our troubles.  We ordered the Chocolate Burger and a couple scoops of ice cream.  It wasn't amazing and honestly it lost a lot of dessert appeal since it looked so much like a burger.\n\nI doubt I'll be back.

I don't know what it was, maybe because I changed my order, maybe because I wasn't absolutely starving, maybe because we paid over $50 for 2 burgers and fries and the fries were the best part of the meal. We were completely unimpressed with Burger Bar this go round.\nFirst of all, I hate the decor. I hate the dark wood against the white walls, it's the epitome of Faux Pub. It's trying to be homey and loungey but only superficially. There's nothing genuine about the attempt to simulate a bar atmosphere. Just blah\nThe Kobe beef upgrade is totally not worth it. I couldn't taste the difference from the half-the-price Black Angus burger. Maybe it was a little juicier but not worth an extra 8 bucks. The flavor of the meat is kinda non-existent; a little salt and pepper would go a long way. The sourdough bun isn't sour at all; sourdough for people who don't like sourdough, and they could stand to toast it a little. The whole package was just so Blah. I really like the skinny fries though. It's really bad when I'm eating the fries more than the burger. If I ever have to go back I'll probably just order fries and a chocolate shake.\n\nI think a big factor in the \"meh-ness\" of this experience is that there are so many delicious, gourmet burgers to be had for much, much cheaper. The burger at Chez Maman is a great example; pure deliciousness for about $10 fries included; same with Jacks Prime in San Mateo.

Now, grant it, it was the day of the Giants World Series Parade.  But then again, its moments like these where professionalism can really shine, unfortunately, that is not Burger Bar.  \n\nSo what about the food?  In short, overpriced burgers - that's it.  Exhibit A: a pretentious $60 kobe beef burger, a ridiculous concoction that includes foie gras and black truffles as toppings.  Puh-lease.\n\nActually, I have no 'beef' with the quality of the food (pun intended).  I ordered the daily special, what appeared to be a regular sized burger on a fancy bun with swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms for $11.25.  Fine, whatever, I love burgers, bring it on.  I briefly glanced at the other burgers and the \"build your owns\" started around $15.00.  \n\nThe burger and fries were fine.  Although, that's no surprise.  I mean, c'mon, it's pretty hard to mess up a burger and fries.  The burger was served with fresh lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a slice of red onion.  It also came with a quarter deli pickle which was average.\n\nBut the service!  Are you kidding me?!? The hostess called out our party, \"Francisco.\"  While I was trying to get a member of our party's attention to answer the hostess, all of a sudden, right in front of me, a woman walks up, says \"Francine?\" to the hostess and the hostess begins to take her away to our table.  I called out to the hostess, to tell her to hold on, \"Francisco\" is right here, and the hostess said sorry, she had already called \"it\" and walked off with Francine.  I don't know who I was more shocked at - the unprofessional hostess or Francine.  Later I decided I disliked them both equally.  In any case, after our meal, I mentioned my displeasure to the hostess on the way out to which she replied whatever and rolled her eyes.  \n\nAt least our server wasn't rude but she wasn't anything to write home about either.  \n\nSo the bottom line is if you want to pay $15 to $20 for a burger and fries, a burger that is in no way special or worth the price and fries that remind you of the battered fries at Burger King, then this place will fit the bill. Just be sure to respond quickly when the hostess calls your name.  What a joke.", "author": "Brian H."}

The waiter some how looks as if he is on drug (blank stare and inattentive to what we order.  Repeated questions that we have already asked).  \n\nIn the course of dinner, he drop plate of food for another table.  We have asked for milk for 4 kids and he only brought one (when obviously we had 4 kids), and he went on asking how many more when all others other than the kids already have drinks...  \n\nFinally when we asked for the check, we waited for more than 15 minutes, and when the bill finally came, there were extra items that was added to the bill (20$ worth) which we never ordered, and it was obvious that from the number of 8 parties, it is not possible to have that much food.\n\nWhen we brought this up and ask him to correct the bill, I passed my credit card to him so we can settle the bill quickly as we have to catch a show.  5 more minutes passed, thus I walked up to the billing corner of the restaurant to see what was the problem.

With a minimal menu of burgers with a salad or two you would think a \"famous chef\" would make an effort to make everything sing. I didn't try the fries but the salad was overdressed, and though I asked for a MR I received Raw burger seared on the outside, with toppings that could have been interesting if a chef was involved. But a chef was not involved in this meal. The toppings were indistinguishable and the cole slaw found in a supermarket deli. The underpaid immigrant prep cook of chain restaurants across the country was probably running this show.\n\nThe bar had a nice selection of microbrews and the alcohol milk shake bar had possibilities. But it all came with a tourist price tag, and coupled with the small print % surcharge to \"cover the SF health initiative\" expensive. I'm sorry but this just reeks of BS. If it is part of your overhead put it in the price. I didn't see a % surcharge for AT&T's overpriced  charges. This appeared to be an effort to make prices look less than they actually are, and an offensive political soap box.\n\nService was generally friendly but involved a rotating team of everchanging faces. The Rare burger was dropped off and I was not approached about how the meal was until it was time to clear the table. And then, he did, he asked, do you need change?

Maybe they should go upstairs and get some advice from the Cheese Cake Factory. Service: What service? They have a pretty good beer menu, but I highly suspect they did not bring me the correct beer I had ordered. Also, they actually brought me a glass of water that had food on the glass, this was something to remember. I also understand that it was opening day,  I was told that it's a 45 min wait this quickly turned into 1 hour and a half, by the time I was seated i'm pretty sure that anything after hanging out at the bar would taste pretty good. \nFood: Well I could say that the burger was pretty good. Here is what we ordered.\n1 American Kobe Beef Burger with Blue Cheese and side of Onion Rings \n1 Country Natural with Pepper Jack Cheese and Zucchini Fries. \n\nDrinks: \n1 Irish Coffee Shake\n1 Warstiener Pils Beer\n1 Gin and Tonic\n\nTotal cost: $74.00\n\nIn conclusion: The drinks, with the exception the beer which I still suspect is not what I had ordered were excellent, the burgers and onion rings were great. Zucchini Fries, not so great. Was it worth the $74.00, well factor in the service and the fact that in the end your only ordering  burgers, your better off going to Brick House on Brannan Street ordering the same thing enjoying some live music and your bill will still be about half.", "author": "Philippe P."}

I was skeptical at first walking in being on the sixth floor of Macy's. Had a wonderful window seat overlooking Union Square and the lit Xmas tree, but it still felt a lil too commercial for me. How could this be \"the \" Burger Bar I had hoped to dine at ever since seeeing the opening in Las Vegas. I am a huge fan of Hubert Keller so I had to try it. \n\nOk, I could care less bout the ambiance once I got the burger. Can't say much about a memorable experience about the service either. But OMG! The ambiance could have been %&$@# because I had my eyes closed for every second that mouth watering burger was touching my palate. Kobe beef burger, toasted onion roll, Pan-seared foie gras and a side of the red wine shallot reduction sauce. Although $30 may be a lot for a burger, everytime I have $30 in my pocket while in SF, I will be knocking on the door of Hubert Keller and the Burger Bar. I cannot say more to describe this experience. \n\nAn added plus was the arrival of the MILKSHAKE PADDLE! Once again Hubert has hit the spot. 6 mini versions of his signature milkshakes with gourmet ingredients. My fav was the Nutella. Wife and kid loved the strawberry. \n\nAfter reading this review after typing, it must seem like I am an employee or investor for this concept. That is not anywhere near the truth. I love you guys Burger Bar! I will be back next week! Maybe even add the black truffles to the best burger in the whole entire world!\n\nI CAN NOW DIE A HAPPY MAN!", "author": "Christopher M."}

The only reason I give 4 stars is because we have always had slow and even rude service.\n\nThe food however, makes up for the wait-staffs short-comings. Different selections of fries - my fave are the sweet potato fries of course :)\n\nThe buffalo burger is delish - i was hesitant to try it, but it was quite yummy! Have yet to try the famous $60 burger, might need to save some money for that one, but the menu is full of great items for semi-decent prices.\n\nBest of all - this place is owned by Hubert Keller - and a lot of times, he is actually there! So cool to see him in the back cooking and prepping food!!\n\nDesert is great as well - try the desert burger - I won't ruin the surprise for you, but needless to say it is delicious.

The beau got the Surf and Turf Burger which was pretty good. Nice tender patty and a big chuck of lobster, delish! I opted for the Hubert Keller burger (his favorite apparently) and was a bit disappointed. I guess I had high expectations since it was his favorite. The buffalo patty was nice and tender, but it being buffalo, medium meant it was a little pinker than medium for beef. This isn't a big deal, but just bear it in mind if you order medium for buffalo. I've read some of the other reviews down below and people were complaining that they're burger came out too pink, ahem, this might be why so just take it into consideration. I was expecting this burger to be just as wonderful as I remembered when I tried it for the first time with the Burger Bar Sliders, however the caramelized onions didn't play a major role in the Hubert Keller Burger like it did in the sliders. Also, the blue cheese was over powering. Many have pointed out the playfulness in Hubert Keller and one of my favorite things here is the milkshake paddle. For $20 bucks you get six small milkshake glasses (three flavors: Strawberry, Caramel latte, and Nutella) on a paddle. A very good deal if you ask me considering that one regular milkshake already costs $8.75. Service was superb, better than the first time I was there when the waiter told me I couldn't substitute my skinny fries for sweet potato fries.", "author": "Karen L."}

Had a beer at the bar.  Pretty good beer selection, friendly bar tender, TV's to watch... pretty nice. Hubert Keller came in like he owned the joint... said \"Hi\" to all the employees... seemed like a nice friendly guy.  Rest of my party arrived...since it was pretty empty, we got a good table by the window with the view over union square.  Pretty nice. Being inspired by his appearance, I got the Hubert Keller burger, medium rare.  The burger was very good.  It was cooked to my specification.  Very tasty, but not too juicy, which is good because it was buffalo meat which is leaner than regular beef I hear.  The toppings were pretty standard and kind of weak.  Bleu cheese, caramalized onions and baby spinach.  While I like all three, nothing about it was special and I probably would have enjoyed the burger just as much without them.  It also came with a side of fries (you get your choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, or onion rings).  I tried all three, and both style of fries were pretty standard.  The onion rings were good, but not awesome.  Overall food was good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nAs far as atmosphere goes,  this place kind of feels like a touristy-chain restaurant, which makes sense as it's in the middle of Union Square in the same building as the Cheesecake Factory.  It's also priced that way, meaning it's a bit expensive for burger and fries, but what do you expect.  There's nothing SF-unique about it and it's almost got an upscale-city-version of Chilis feel.  But that's ok because the place is very clean, service is excellent, and everything is done the right way.

Overall, the burger patty itself was delicious --- moist, juicy, and flavorful. The cheese and avocado didn't really add to the burger even though they are my favorite toppings. The letdown was the fries. They weren't hot (as in temperature) nor were they anything more than grocery store freezer spuds. \n\nMy fellow diners had the buffalo burger (also really juicy and didn't taste that much different than beef), skinny fries (again nothing special), fried pickles (a lot of batter and not great), sweet potato fries (just ok), and the veggie burger (supposedly really good). I think that someone also mentioned the sauces as being really good, so I might have to try that next time (if ever). \n\nSo, all in all, a decent burger, but the sides are lacking and it's grossly overpriced.", "author": "Cecilia W."}

I got the truffle burger w/ foie gras just had to try it and it was just ok. It's really all about how many expensive ingredients you can put on a burger. The second time we ate I just made my own burger and I think this is truly the magic about this place like other places like the counter you get your burger the way you want it. But Hubert has offered unlike other places an upscale ingredient list. And the beers on tap were great!! It is hard to find good beer in Vegas!! The third time we ate at burger bar was in Frisco as guests of Hubert. We had to wait 45 min tobe seated but I didn't mind we had just popped in during a crowd rush and once seated we quickly found out that Hubert was trying to get us in a booth by the kitchen so he could serve us. First he sent us out an appetizer plate with pretty much every appitizer on the menu on it. All good as usual. Then we ordered our burgers which have always been good.  But to top it off as we were all so full we couldn't eat another bite. Hubert popped in with a flight of milk shakes he had just made for us.  Somehow we found a way to eat them all I think his finess had something to do with it.  He was so excited to have us try them and I have to say they were really really good.  Strang enough this is the first time I've had a head chef drop off a bill and pick it back up. By all means how much do you tip a chef? If standerd good service is 18-20% what does a Michiline chef that has gone out of his way get?

We arrived and realized there was a 10 minute wait but a lot of tables were open- apparently they only had 2 servers which doesn't make sense when you advertise to 24,000 people for that same day. We waited about 20 minutes and had to split the group up to make it easier. We all picked out what we were ordering while we were waiting so when the waitress came we could order drinks and food and all ordered something that worked for the coupon and had them all on the table. We waited 20 minutes for just water! Finally our drinks came, then food - it was really good but pricey. When the bill came the girl said it's 1 coupon per table. We were all upset because she knew we were all ordering our free drink (sounds so petty but...) then we talk to our friends at the other table and they mentioned the waitress honored all of their coupons. The EXTREMELY RUDE manager came up to our table and said \"you wanted to talk to me?\" we said no, but we don't understand, and he cut me off and fought that he didn't comp anyone's drinks, blah blah blah. We basically sat there and had to cut him off and say \"at this point we waited an additional half hour for our check, just give it to us please\". He was a complete jerk about the whole situation.

I got to meet Hubert Keller, which was awesome!\n\nThe Cons: The service is slow, you'll still wait for a table even when you can see several tables clearly free.  The fries are not good.  \n\nI've had the Kobe burger, which to be totally honest in a burger is not really worth it.  It was also well done.  I had originally asked for medium rare (but then the waitress had warned that it would be one the rare side) so I asked them to make it medium instead.  What I got was a well done burger that was not very good.  The second time I went there a week later I learned my lesson and I got the Country beef and stuck to my guns with the medium rare, I was much happier.  Being an optimist I have to see the silver lining to all of this: Burger Bar in a way has taught me to trust my instincts.  The Country style burger I had was really good, I also added Cheddar and Guacamole.  Both good choices.  Although I dunno if $3.00 for an ounce of Guac was really worth it, but it was good nonetheless.  I had to skinny fries each time I went as well, nothing to write home about, and unless they come with your burger they aren't worth the $2-$3.00 price tag.  The shakes I haven't tried.  \n\nI will probably go back one more time, Just to try a burger with Foie Gras on it, just cause Foie makes everything a lot better. However I don't think this place will be a destination I'll be going to often.  Burger Meister and Barneys are much better and about the same price.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

The reason I even ended up at Burger Bar was because the Cheesecake Factory had an hour wait and we had theater reservations. If you like paying over $ 80.00 out the door for hamburgers and two drinks, you might like this place, but I doubt it. The waitstaff is still getting their bearings; our waiter didn't know how the individual televisions in the booths worked,  and did not know what gins or scotches the bar carried. I ordered a martini straight up and it came with a watered down taste the result of ice cubes that weren't cold enough. The drinks were $ 11.00 each which is probably par for SF, but the drinks should be well made. A martini well made is one of the best drinks around; poorly made one of the worst. One person ordered a specialty burger medium well and it came medium rare. I ordered the sliders which were all supposed to cooked medium. They came well done. My wife ordered the salmon burger which she liked. Fries came with the sliders and they were good and plentiful. I would not come here again since their menu is pretty limited to burgers and variations thereof. Their burgers don't compare to Zuni's and they aren't even as good as the fast food versions at In-N-Out or Five Guys. I had high expectations for this restaurant since Keller's name is associated with it. I was sorely disappointed. Maybe I should have waited the one hour at Cheesecake Factory.", "author": "Bob Z."}

The fries, which were a huge complaint before, were better although still a bit generic. I noticed that, despite ordering medium, blood was pooling up in the plate. Even worse in my friend's plate who also ordered medium...clearly these patties could have been rested longer. Still, the burger was solid, and the peppercorn sauce, while subtle, was a nice addition. \n\nI decided to try the chocolate burger dessert. It really does resemble a burger, but it is made from a donut with a chocolate patty and sliced fruit as garnish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-12-10", "description": "While I've heard that Burger Bar in Las Vegas is incredible, Hubert Keller's San Francisco homage to the humble burger is far from it.  I was there with a rather large group for a work event and kept lowering the bar until I could step over it which is saying a lot for a restaurant that one co-worker declared was more like a TGI Fridays than anything else.  When we first arrived, we sat at the bar and when the bartender finally came over he asked us to wait.  Was it crowded?  Was he knee deep in fixing fancy cocktails?  No and no.  We were two of four people seated at the bar (the other two were with us but had arrived earlier and were enjoying drinks already) and we were told to wait so that he could finish filling the ketchup bottles he was so focused on (wouldn't want to interrupt that).  I ordered a \"Palms\" cocktail - a Kettle One martini with blue cheese stuffed olives that I found undrinkable.  I will give it to the restaurant as I'm not a martini drinker and because my friend tried it and said it was pretty good as far as martini's go but I still felt a little taken advantage of at $13 a pop for a drink I wasn't crazy about.  We got seated at our table and I ordered the Sangiovese (an Italian red wine) but was brought out a glass of white wine - twice.  When the waitress first brought the glass out, I mentioned that I ordered the Sangiovese and she said ok and returned to the bar for what I thought was the right glass of wine.  The same girl returned minutes later holding the same glass of white wine and I mentioned yet again that I had ordered the Sangiovese, a red (I even showed her the wine list to ensure she got it right). The third time was a charm and she finally showed up with the wine I now so desperately needed.  The table ordered appetizers and my main thought was this: why hummus and pita at a burger place?  The hummus was terrible (pasty and musty) and was served with fried chickpeas that I'm sure were delicious when they first came out of the fryer but that was probably yesterday as what I put in my mouth was mushy and cold and entirely  lacking in flavor.  The other appetizers were comprised of the fried snacks tower (ooh), chicken wings, sliders with French fries and shrimp cocktail.  If I could have eaten one thing all night, it would have been the deep fried jalape\u00f1o pickles as they're truly extraordinary but everything else just paled in comparison.  I ordered the American style burger which was a Black Angus burger with American cheese and bacon.  It was good but certainly not worth returning for as I've had better (for cheaper) at In N' Out.  The service was barely keeping up even though we didn't order that much and towards the end of the night when the waitress dropped a knife on my arm as she was clearing my plate I almost wasn't surprised.  All in all, it feels like Burger Bar is looking to please the first time visitor and isn't interested in return guests.  I was expecting more given the chef connected to this restaurant is world renowned but after the way the night started and ended I'd say low expectations are the only way to go.", "author": "Erin H."}

Both my wife and mothers burgers did not come with jalapenos that they ordered or cheese. And my wife's burger was overcooked. \n\nNow on to mine. \n\nI'm gonna start off by saying that I have no problem with paying $60 for a burger, if in fact that burger is good. I ordered my burger Med-Rare and it came out Well done. I informed the waitress of this and that the other 2 burgers were incorrect. She came back out with the jalapenos and cheese that was missing but nothing about my burger.\n\nWhen it was time for the bill to come nothing was taken off. \n\nThis is when I finally said something. I told I was going to pay the full bill, but there should have been a gesture on their part for all the mistakes. After all The bill was $155 for 3 people. She then went to a manager and took $30 off and no manager came by. And never at any time did anyone apologize for all the mistakes. \n\nI will try the one in Vegas at some point. But I think Chef Keller should check up on this location more. 3 Yelp stars for a Chef of his stature, he should be embarrassed. \n\nNext time I'd rather eat a $6 happy hour burger at Flemings steakhouse than $60 or anything he has to offer.", "author": "Christopher B."}

He's proof that a great Burger is or should be a passion, a commitment and a work of gastronomic art.  So today I parked in the garage at Union Square and crossed the street to Macy's where an elevator whisked me up to Burger Bar after a receptionist gave me a brief description of what to expect.  \n\nBurger Bar is on the 6th floor of Macy's Union Square under the much larger Cheesecake Factory and I hope becomes as busy.  So I get off the elevator on 6 and am in a foyer dividing my destination from the retail behemoth is rents from.  It's modern, sleek, casually upscale and almost totally bereft of any visible attachment to anything other than the architectural design.  A clean and slick rectangle you enter from the foyer outside the elevator or by escalator through the lower floors of the host property.  A pleasant, black bedecked hostess welcomed me and offered a table or seat at the bar for me, a single diner, and I chose the bar which is long and densely populated by 24 draft beers, a top shelf bar with almost everything but Tuaca which surprised me with such a tribute to so many liquors.   At the West end of the bar is a chilled wine cellar with windows displaying bits of a huge and smart wine list.\n\nThe bar has 12 comfortable stools and the adjoining lounge features 7 bar high four top tables looking out over Union Square or at the four large flat screen monitors tuned to four different sporting events.  Beyond the bar area is the dining room which has a 'soda fountain' and further along a glassed in butcher shop where they cut, trim and grind the various meats they use.  It's all impeccably clean and orderly but also pretty damned sterile.    Nice tile flooring, white walls and ceiling with patches of mahogany paneling and five huge, modern octagonal hanging chandeliers are pretty much the eye candy until you get to the gorgeous menu and then the really good purpose of this joint, BURGERS.  \n\nThe menu is well organized as well as pretty, and its truly about the sandwich with some form of cooked meat between the bread.  In this case we're talking the BEST meat in several varieties, Buffalo, Salmon, house made garden burger and a ton of ways to customize whatever you choose.  A lobster tail on your burger?  There amazing, tempting choices in many categories and execution is what M. Keller is renowned for.  For my first of many visits I chose the slide plate because it offered three different meat choices and it came with fries which I'd heard are among the best anywhere.  This menu choice doesn't allow choices on doneness of the meat and the menu states each will come out medium.  The platter was delivered and had the three good sized sliders on one side of the rectangular plate and a lot of sizzling hot fries on the other.  The only things I noted that weren't as described were the rareness of the meat patties and the lack of quality condiments provided.  All they offer without ordering as a side are Heinz Catchup and Grey Poupon Mustard.  I wish I'd been told that there are choices I might like to add to my burgers, but I know now and will adjust and be prepared next visit.\n\nI'm enchanted with the idea of treating this great sandwich with the honor it deserves and in his book, Burger Bar, chef Keller discusses the challenges and opportunities in making great burgers.  The buns here were perfect, the produce excellent, the meat great and the portion and price a terrific deal.  I will be back and will be updating my review as time passes but Burger Bar is a must visit place for anyone with a passion for GREAT burgers.\n\nThere", "author": "Stu S."}

Unfortunately I was VERY disappointed with the outcome.  \nMy girlfriend and I both ordered the $16.50 Kobe burger.  Hers well down and mine medium.   We also ordered the Sweet Potato and skinny fries.    When the burgers showed up they were tiny and imagine a large oval white plate with the 4 inch wide burger on it.  Also all the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.   So you have this large white oval plate the 4 inch burger and a scrape of wilted lettuce, onion and Tomato.  It looks like something Denny's would be serving at 3 AM.  I mean come on this should blow me away and it's a total joke.   The Fries come out on these little white plates like a kid's side at Applebee's.  Very low budget presentation for such a bit of hype about the owner.   Sorry Hubert but just giving your name to this place will drop your stock price at Fleur de Lys.

The Burger Bar requires a minimum party of 13 for a reservation and since we only had 11 in ours we were unable to make reservations. \n\nWe got there at 6:45 hoping to be seated by 7:30. Not the case. After being told it would be less than an hour wait, we were not seated until after 9pm. Our table was next to the bar, so we could watch the group at our table argue with the waitress for about 20 min about something. We just assumed it was something small, you know there are just some people that like to complain.\n\nAfter being seated we ordered drinks and quickly thereafter we ordered our dinner and milkshakes. The alcoholic milkshakes are out of this world. I ordered the American Kobe Beef Burger.(I know, I know that does not make sense, kind of like saying a Californian Texas Burger) It took about 45 min for my burger to come. But only my burger and the person next to me's burger came. The waitress said it would be about 5 more minutes for the other dishes to come out. (Which took more than 15 min.) So this put us in a bad situation, do we be rude and eat our burgers in-front of the rest of our party that has been wait now 3 hours to eat, or do we wait and let our $18 burgers to get cold. Even McDonald's has heat lamps. \n\nWell the rest of the dishes finally came, sort of. They got 3 orders wrong, so the servers came and went four times to sort it out. Finally everyone was eating, but one of the girls looked enraged. Turns out she had ordered a med-well done burger and she got a rare burger, it made my med-rare burger look well done. But she didn't send it back because she was starving.\n\nWell despite our bad experience so far we decided to stay for desert. I went to the rest room while we waited for the chocolate burgers and milkshakes. Well you don't expect to see vomit in the bathroom sink of a nice restaurant like this do you? I didn't, but that's what I saw there.\n\nI got back just in time to see that the kitchen made the wrong desert for the same girl who got the rare burger. You can probably already figure out that she wasn't pleased.\n\nFew other notes. Our waitress was not at the table when our food was served. Our water glasses were filled once and that was only after we asked. Nor were we asked if we would like refills on our sodas, or if we wanted another beer when it was gone. Our waitress only asked one person how the food was and that was when she handed us the bill.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention how my American Kobe beef burger tasted. Let's put it this way, if you didn't tell me that's what it was I would have never known it wasn't just plain beef with salt and pepper on it. That's right, not extra tender, no special spices, just a slab of beef with lettuce and tomato.", "author": "Dave G."}

I was coming from seeing A Christmas Carol by ACT and decided to check out Burger Bar since I would be dining alone.  I've heard so much hype about this place that I figured I had to give it a shot.  Hubert Keller can do no wrong, right? \n\nWrong.\n\nI walked in a stopped at the hostess stand and was ignored by a gaggle of teeny-boppers posted at the stand.  They were literally talking about some kind of drama right in front of me.  Very unprofessional.  I asked if I could have a table for 1 person and the little girl told me that I could sit at the bar.  This place is HUGE and was rather empty around 9pm so it was a little off putting that I was shunned to the bar.  Dining alone isn't the end of the world, folks.  People do it all the time.  Besides, I wanted to take advantage of overlooking Union Sq.  I decided to pull up a seat at said bar (I LITERALLY had to wrestle a seat loose from a crowd of people).  The bartender was pleasantly attentive and took my drink order.  He then offered a menu and that was that.  I cracked up the menu and was expecting to see amazingness... not something that looked like it was ripped off from Applebees. \n\nI decided to go for the 'American Burger' and even though it had a hefty pricetag of $16.00, I figured it would be well worth it.\n\nWrong again.\n\nMy medium well burger was dripping and the bottom part of the bun was soaked pink from all the excess 'juice'.  The french fries were, well, french fries and I could tell the aioli was not homemade. \n\nI got my bill and really could not believe that I just spent $20 bucks on a burger.  I would have been more satisfied at In-N-Out for a fraction of the price.  Next time I shell out $20 for a burger, it better buy me flowers and open the car door for me.", "author": "Michelle P."}

We ordered the sliders for our son.\n\nMy husband and I both noticed our burgers were more rare than usual, but didn't think it was an issue. My husband scarfed his burger down.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-10", "description": "Burger Bar get's 1 star because the floor manager was a nice guy and very cordial.  He understands the service timings and protocols that your drinks need to come out before your food so you actually have enough time to finish them.  I would go back there just because I liked the floor manager and one of the bussers was nice and it has a good view of Union Square.  The second star is for the beer selection.  Other than that, here is a list of gripes:\n\n1.  Ashley our server was not attentive.  I ordered a beer and a $11 Pina Colada, a salad and a Kpbe Burger.  The beer came out right away and I had to remind her of the Pina Colada.  She said that the bar is really backed up and was not apologetic of the fact that we had the beer on the table for about 15 minutes and I was drinking by myself while my wife was empty handed.   \n\n2.  Her Greek salad and my Kobe burger even came out before the $11 Pina Colada.  By the middle of my burger the $11 Pina Colada finally came out.  By the time we were done eating my wife only had a little of the Pina Colada.  I can't really expect her to chug a $11 Pina Colada and we needed to go.  When I brought his up to our server Ashley that I would like her to take off the Pina Colada from the bill because it came out after the food was half eaten, she said without being apologetic that there were 12 milkshakes being made in front of it, (even though they had time to cook our food and bring it out before then).   \n\n3.  The Kobe Burger was the correct temp of Med Rare but Cheesecake's Kobe Burger is a little tastier and cheaper.  The Salad was fine.  The $3 skinny fries were room temp.  They also have an extensive beer selection.  Looked like about 20 draft beers and an entire book of bottled beers. \n\n4.  Just so you know what our tipping habits are, we normally give 20%.  In this case, the bill was $53 and even after I was offended by our server, I still left $11 on $53 which is still about 20%.  Drinks need to come out before the meal and if not then your server should be somewhat apologetic especially if you're dropping $11 on a Pina Colada.", "author": "nino l."}

None of us were hungry enough to order whole burgers so we opted to share a bunch of things -a few orders of the sliders (each order consisting of 1 angus, 1 beef, 1 buffalo), sweet potato fries, regular fries, fried zucchini, and onion rings.  I also had a vanilla milkshake.  While none of us were blown away by anything we had, we all agreed that we'd want to come back to try other items on the menu.  \n\nLet's be real - a burger is a burger and there are only so many ways you can make them.  The novelty here is the selection - there aren't too many places where you can get a Kobe beef burger or a surf and turf burger.  Temper your expectations and enjoy it for what it is - a fancy burger place.\n\nMore on the food:\nSliders: Maybe it's because it was 1am, but the buffalo slider I had was delicious!  Cooked just right and with a nice texture.  My friends also thought the other two sliders were really good.  At $12.75 not too expensive.\n\nFried stuff: The regular fries tasted like McDonald's fries and the sweet potato ones were ok - Taylor's Refresher has better.  The other fried stuff was ok but nothing spectacular.  \n\nShake: The milkshake was a bit of a disappointment - for $7.50 you'd expect it to be the best damn milkshake ever, but it's not any better than a Mel's shake (and half the size).  \n\nService: Not too many customers at 1am, so the service was great - our waiter answered all our questions and was attentive to our needs.

I went here with a friend for the first time last night and was hoping I was going to like it.  I have to say the service was very good and the people were friendly but as far as the food goes, it was disappointing.  My friend had the Angus burger and thought it was okay but my veggie burger was the absolute worst one I ever had in my life.  It tasted like a potato pancake that wasn't cooked long enough.  It was beyond weird.  The onion rings we ordered were actually very good but that would not be enough for me to return.  I've actually had better food at a few local dives in town.  The view out to Union Square is really cool but you can get the same view from The Cheesecake Factory upstairs and the food there is much better.  Also, there is a heated outdoor patio at The Cheesecake Factory.  All I'm saying is this place didn't meet my expectations.  For a restaurant bearing the name of a celebrity chef, I would expect a lot better.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

(My dad is a huge fan of buffalo meat!)\n\nWe arrived 20 minutes before our reservation and were seated a few minutes before our actual reservation, which was surprising considering how busy it was in there.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable and was easily able to answer any and all questions that my parents threw at him (they're from the midwest :).  I was impressed with how fast our drinks arrived along with our appetizer.  We started out with onion rings and beer battered pickles...my favorite!\nFor my burger I decided to build my own, which seemed confusing at first but our server definitely had a hand in helping me build my perfect burger.  I chose the Country Natural Beef and added cheddar, bacon, portobello mushrooms, grilled onions and truffle sauce.  It was delish!!!! I was quite proud of myself for coming up with such an amazing burger.  My dad ordered the Hubert Keller Burge and was so impressed with the flavors that he actually took a napkin and wrote down all of the different ingredients that came on the burger.  He loved the combination of buffalo meat with blue cheese, spinach, and carmalized onions on a ciabatta bun.  My mom, who is constantly \"watching her figure\" ordered the grilled shrimp salad but ended up taking most of it home because she couldn't get enough of the burger I created.\n\nAfter we finished our burgers, we all agreed on no dessert, we didn't think it would be possible to take another bite of anything.  The server came by to offer us coffee and dessert but we turned him down.  While waiting for our check, my dad made a trip to the restroom and on his way back noticed an entire station in the restaurant that is dedicated to making milkshakes.  He was so amazed by this that he talked us into ordered a milkshake to split.  We went for the mint chocolate chip ice cream shake and we couldn't have been happier with our final choice at the Burger Bar!!", "author": "Amber R."}

HOWEVER. if you cant present good ingredients in a palatable form, maybe you should try something else. \n\nlets start from the begining. ive become much more patient over the past few years and dont mind having to wait for things. perhaps i burnt myself out real fast at an early age, but its pretty hard to get me upset about things now. i didnt quite understand why they would have one server to our party of 20 when the place was pretty much empty besides us, but meh. i had a beer. im not complaining. i ordered a country burger. it looked pretty middle of the road on the menu. i had half the mind to order the $60 burger, but meh, i wanted to see how they do a \"regular\" burger. i added a chipotle aioli, provolone cheese, prosciutto and a side of skinny fries. this came out to be about $25 or so. i ordered my meat med rare. the burger was infact medium rare. the meat seemed to be of good quality. completely underseasoned. i understand a low salt diet, but this was one of those moments when you say, ok. i understand what those judges were talking about on top chef... all this dish needed was some salt and it wouldve been so much better than it was. are these burgers designed so that you need to pour one of those additional cost sauces? thats kinda crappy. the burger left MUCH to be desired. \n\ni enjoyed their nice beer list. i probably had a couple too many beers, but i liked my duvel on tap. 11 bucks is a bit steep, but its a good beer. i enjoyed my chimay white. but $30 bucks for a 750ml? a bit steep. and finally i enjoyed my racer 5 on tap. \n\nin the end, would i spend 80 bucks on beers and burgers again? not here. i have a tough time imagining this place will be around for much longer than a few more months unless they change some things around quickly....\n\nSALT!!! \n\nsaving graces? nice beers. nice view. good staff, though a bit slow. the nutella milkshake i spilt with the lady next to me was pretty damn good and i dont even like sweets. \n\nsaving graces from last night. good friends and that always makes up for anything.\n\nlets see the score. i liked fdl in vegas, but didnt like fdl in sf. i didnt like bb in sf, maybe ill like bb in vegas.....", "author": "Euge L."}

Now, this isn't Fleur de Lys by any means, but this is a H.Keller restaurant - with that said, the service was less than stellar.  We basically had one of those servers who took our order and we didn't see her for the rest of our meal, only when she came over after asking if we wanted dessert!  Not - 'how was everything guys? Do you need anything else?' Just, 'would you guys like dessert? No.' - check drop! I ordered an ice tea, never got it from our server, had to ask twice from the bus boys passing by.  Food came, things were missing, had to wait and ask twice before they finally came - still hadn't seen server since she took our order!  She did come to refill our water glasses (after we ate and the plates were already cleared) - I'm sitting closest to where she was, with my ice tea glass almost empty - does she offer me a refill on anything? - no!\nFood was good, I found the buns for the burgers were on the 'hard' side, bread wasn't soft enough.  Zucchini fries were very tasty, nice crunch, nicely seasoned.\nAs we sat at our table - ready to leave - still our server is M.I.A. - since dropping the check.  One HUGE peeve I have when I'm in a restaurant - a guest should NOT have to ever get up from the table (once seated) and only to use the restroom and cause they are ready to leave.  We waited long enough and my friends were ready to go, I had to get up, walk to the Host stand to tell them we are ready to leave and our server is all over the place but coming to our table so we can pay our bill - so can you please handle this (as I hand over payment with our check!)  They obviously told our server there was a mishap, when she returns to our table to bring the credit card slip, do you even think she even mentions this or apologizes for anything - NO!  The basic elements of food service 101 was completely missing from this experience - I've gotten better service at Denny's.  Mind you, this place was not slammed or busy at all at the time we were there.  \nNow, writing a review on a restaurant and all I've mostly written on is how the service is lack luster... you can come to your own conclusions.

All of the meat, whether buffalo or beef, was a little dry, unseasoned, and devoid of flavor.  The truffle sauce tasted like McCormick instant Au Jus.  The fries were okay, in a McDonald's sort of way, but not in the delicious French bistro pomme frites sort of way that I'd expect Keller capable of producing.  The onion bun on which the Kobe burger came was reminiscent of Safeway.\n\nI went here on a relatively slow Monday afternoon, and yet somehow the fire time for our order exceeded 20 minutes.  For burgers and fries.  On a slow afternoon.\n\nI'll say this however:  the view is lovely.  Come here for the view and a drink and try to ignore the awful mall chain restaurant feel of the place.

Had the Hubert Keller Burger - buffalo burger w/ carmelized onions, blue cheese, and sauteed onions. It totally hit the spot; I couldn't have been happier. The battered zucchini was great appetizer as well - nice, crisp coating with al dente zucchini in the middle (hate when it gets mushy). OMG the Nutella Milkshake.. all I have to say is try it or you're missing out. The skinny fries were great and so were the sweet potato fries - perfectly crisp on the outside w/ just the right tenderness on the inside.\n\nThe food was nothing short of fantastic. An added bonus - getting to meet Hubert Keller! He just happened to have been checkin things out that night and came over to our table for a hand shake and gratitude for our patronage. \n\nSo why only three stars? Horrible service (this is a deal breaker for me most of the time). Our first waiter didn't want anything to do with us (maybe it was because he was ending his shift; still not an excuse). It was hard to flag him down and when we did; he got our order wrong (could've been his \"walk and listen\" method that didn't work. yes. he didn't even stop to listen to our order. the d-bag kept walking). After we couldn't find him for a good ten minutes; we asked someone for something simple -  a straw - but never got it. Then we got pleasantly surprised with a new waitress. Definitely better than our first - bubbly, attentive, and willing. Things were smooth until the place got busier. After a while we never saw our waitress so it took forever to get anything. When we tried to flag her down she gave us the index finger. So we tried to ask someone to pass on the message that we wanted some tea... when that didn't come after 15 minutes we were able to finally get her attention and she said she never got the message and that she'd make sure the tea would make its way to our table - never happened. Finally, she came back after another ten minutes, after we had to flag her down of course, and told us they had no more of the tea we wanted.. went to the fourth floor for some tea instead. Something small but significant enough to bother me...\n\nThank goodness the foood is wonderful; or else I'd have no other reason to come back.", "author": "kassandra t."}

And my expectation is very high too, something that is better than the generic hamburger places that we can have anywhere else offering by mass and commercial restaurants.\n\nI got there on Saturday night about 7 pm. and waited about 20 minutes to get seat. The menu is impressive, They offer a lot of choices for hamburger.. from angus beef, kobe beef, ground turkey, salman, chicken, etc. I chose American Kobe Beef hamburger with mozzarella, Jalapeno Bacon, avocado on side and coleslaw. I have to order their dijon mustard (that they claimed it is homemade) on side because they do not offer any dijon on the table. -- minus 1 star for this and the taste is like the regular dijon. They only offer yellow mustard from the commercial brand on the table. I ordered my beef medium, and my husband ordered medium rare. But I got medium rare and my husband got medium. -- minus another 1 star for this. The quality of my kobe beef is ok but no flavor. The skinny fries that I got was already cold and plain, nothing special.- minus another star for this. If you tried fries from the restaurants in Napa, you will know what I mean, the fries that hot and crispy outside. For my personnal opinion, I think the fries at in & out is better!!!\n\nThe customer service was nice. Our waitress was nice. No complain about this. \n\nThe interior.... it looks mass or chain restaurant.

Another friend had the country burger meat and another the portobella mushroom -- all completely satisfied.    \n\nThe ambience is great as we sat in front of the window looking down on Union Square right next to the bar.

He was walking around the restaurant looking involved and attentive and our nice waiter, Chris, asked if we would like to meet him, well, duh- yes!  Mr. Keller stopped by and chatted with us very openly in his friendly style. He even stopped by a second time after our meal to ask us how it was.

Oh and those drinks we fought so hard to order? NEVER got a second chance to order another! Glasses sat empty for an hour and a half. LAME. Finally, someone got up and got us water at the bar. I asked the hostesses twice to find our waiter. He still was never anywhere to be found. The sundaes? The milkshakes? WHO KNOWS? I didn't stick around to find out how they tasted. Wanna cheap tasty burger? Stick to In n' Out. Want a pricey, indulgent burger? Hit Zuni Cafe. At both places you get what you pay for and the service is always RIGHT ON.", "author": "Alexander G."}

WRONG!\n\nWhen you eat at Burger Bar, you can throw out all of your hopes that Burger Bar's food will be the same quality as his finer dining institutions. Before I continue to knock Burger Bar, I think the decor of Burger Bar has Hubert Keller's charm and enthusiasm. There are booths with personal TVs and the restaurant has the feel of a classy diner.\n\nWe came here early to beat the lunch rush. We were immediately seated next to a window that had breathtaking views of Union Square (kudos to that!). The menu is not overly complicated, but PLEASE NOTE that when you order a \"create your own burger,\" fries do not come with your order, which warranted a major demerit in my opinion. However, the specials come with skinny fries. My friend ordered to Kobe beef burger and I ordered the Hawaiian Burger. The orders came fairly quickly (probably because they are simply grilled pieces of meat placed between two buns). To our surprise, my friend's kobe burger did not come with fries and the lettuce, tomato and onion sat awkwardly on the half of the plate where we expected fries to occupy. We both just stared at it like two kids opening a gift box to find it empty. The Kobe beef burger is cooked to your liking but looked rather charred when it arrived. However, my friend said it tasted ok, as he downed the puppy in a matter minutes (read as: the burger was small). My Hawaiian burger came with a side order of skinny fries, which I unwillingly had to share with my friend. There were two pieces of marinated chicken, a slice of bacon, grilled onions, and a roasted pineapple on a buttered bun. To say the chicken was flavorless would be a compliment. I have no idea what the marinade could have been since I tasted no hint of flavor in the chicken. To make matters worse, the chicken came steaming hot, which made the buns soggy. The grilled onions were a mushy mess. The roasted pineapples seemed to have a few pepper flakes on it and was not particularly appealing. The only saving grace was the bacon, but it is pretty hard to mess up bacon. The mushy onions and the soggy buns made each successive bite less appetizing than the previous one. My burger and my friend's burger were highly disappointing.\n\nI really wanted to like Burger Bar, since it would provide a less crowded alternative to Cheesecake Factory. I also wanted to like it because I am a big fan of Hubert Keller, but alas, my high hopes were unwarranted and unrewarded. If you want a better burger, head two blocks south on Powell St. to Burger King (you would also pay about $20 less for your food). Sorry Burger Bar, never again.", "author": "Gary L."}

They used to have a rude hostess and impossible seating.  Thanks to their manager Richard, things have greatly improved and we always manage to get wonderful seating.  The views from the windows are spectacular and the booths offer nice privacy.  The burgers are always delicious.  I've tried so many of them the only advice I can give is to go for the plainest ones because the meat is delicious.  I got the Black Jack, and the olive tapenade while good, overpowered the delicious hamburger underneath.  Lots of different types of beef (including Kobe and Black Angus) as well as salmon and veggie burgers.  We go after theatre as they are open late and it's the perfect fun end to an evening.  The service is attentive and friendly and they always take such good care of us, we never go anywhere else for late dining on Union Square.

We ordered a salmon burger and the slider trio.  We also ordered a side of zucchini fries.  The salmon burger was very generous.  The fish was a thick piece of fillet, not a salmon mash mixed with bread crumb that is what you get sometimes for that order elsewhere.  The sliders, though they were supposed to have been made using three different types of meat, all tasted the same to me.  The only differences between the three are what was put on top of each of the patties.   Both dishes were fine, nothing all that spectacular. However, the zucchini fries were the most disappointing.  The fries used all the breading that was not used on the salmon, and then some.  The breading has this unpleasant taste/odor that stopped me from having another bite after the initial taste.  I did not detect any zucchini with that one bite I took.  Overall, I'll probably go back there again, but not too soon.", "author": "Yvette F."}

It was replaced graciously with an excellent petite syrah of the maitre d's choosing.\nBurger - You can put together a foie gras burger for lots less than the $60 one if you omit the $30 truffles.  Choose from the left side of the menu to do this.  For what it was, i.e. wretches excess, it was good.\nSides - The sweet potatoe fries seemed cut too thin to retain moisture so they were not very good.\nDessert - I asked.  The waiter checked.  The ice cream is from Dreyers (hello, Safeway) or from something like Bluebells in Idaho or Iowa, which I take it is another low end creamery.

I haven't been to Fleur De Lys but I think he should stick to it since I've heard good things about it.  Unfortunately I was really looking forward to dinner here and had high expectations.  I wanted to like it.  Really I did but when you charge me more than $8 for a milkshake that is supposedly alcoholic but tastes like you just threw some Dreyer's mint chip ice cream in a blender, then you have lost a possible fan in me.  First off, our waitress sucked!  I usually tip between 20 to 25% but I think we ended up leaving her a 10% tip if even that.  Throughout the meal, we were constantly looking for her.  She wouldn't take our complete order at once.  Instead she insisted upon breaking up our ordering so that we would order everything in the order it should arrive.  A good waiter would take the entire order and just stagger the input of the order into the kitchen.  Usually I wouldn't mind if it hadn't been for the fact that the waitress kept disappearing so we'd have to try to find her and flag her down to order our burgers after our drinks finally arrived.  I ordered the sliders plate because I wanted to try the various types of meat that Burger Bar served.  It had the Angus, Country Natural Beef and buffalo burger on it.  When the burgers finally came, I expected that the wait staff would at least point out the different sliders and describe the different meats.  Nope, some guy just plopped it onto the table and left without asking if we needed anything.   We never saw the waitress again until we flagged her down to get our bill.  She never checked on us and wasn't the one to drop off our food.  As for the burgers, we had to just guess what was what.  My friend and I were ultimately unimpressed with it.  You could taste a slight difference in the meats but it was still pretty flavorless.  I don't think they season or flavor the meat at all.  I suppose that if you custom ordered your burger and got the difference aiolis and sauces, it would be a different story.  Unfortunately substitutions and add-ons are not allowed on their signature burgers so we made due with ketchup and mustard.  Good thing they were on the table or else we would've ended up with some dry-ass burgers since we would never have been able to find our waitress to request those condiments.  My friend had wanted to order the dessert burger but we were full from the shakes and burgers.  It sounded intriguing but I was already disappointed and didn't want to waste any more money on a let-down.  We spent nearly $30 each for shakes and sliders and pretty much stiffed our waitress on her tip due to her craptastic service.  All in all, the burgers aren't bad but for the prices they charged, I would go elsewhere that will charge half as much for a mediocre burger.  The service was terrible for none too busy happy hour timeslot in the middle of Union Square.  I won't be back unless some friend has a birthday there and I have no choice in the restaurant.", "author": "elsa w."}

After making your way through Macy's, you are greeted with a fantastic view from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant, and the food is not too shabby either. I was a bit skeptical about Beer-Battered Jalapeno Pickles, because they sounded like a strange combination, but they were surprisingly delicious, and not too spicy.  I was thrilled to find that the Veggie Burger was not just some pre-made patty. It's their own combination of ingredients, including pumpkin and cheese and a load of other things, giving it a very complex flavor. It was incredibly filling and tasty, and not like anything I've had anywhere else. My boyfriend said his American Kobe Burger was seasoned and cooked quite well. He also enjoyed the White Lightning beer, which our server explained was brewed just for the Burger Bar. And the milkshake sampler we had for desert was outstanding, if a little overwhelming!

The sweet potato fries and onion rings were also delicious, however, I also love their fried pickles! They were very generous with the pickles and it was perfectly crispy. My favorite thing however was the alcoholic milkshakes, specifically the mint one made with ice cream, bailey's and mint flavoring. You don't taste any alcohol, it tastes just like a delicious mint milkshake and then you start feeling the affects, its lovely. They also have one in vegas that I want to hit up!

However, after that we didn't see anyone for about 10 min.  We didn't know who our waiter was so we actually had to ask a bus boy to get somebody for us.  A couple of other waiters walked right by us and could clearly see that we were sitting there for a while yet didn't take the time to acknowledge our presence or get anyone for us.  Just shows that all they cared about was their own tables and not the overall customer service of the restaurant.  We finally got our waiter and ordered.  I ordered the kobe beef burger.  Although it took very long for it to come out, it tasted really good.  However, our waiter never checked on us, and we actually had to ask for the bill.  The bussers were very prompt.  Once we finished our meals they were very quick to clear our table.  So again, we sat for probably 5 minutes now with a clear table waiting for our bill.

We arrived at approximately 6pm and were told the wait would take about 10 minutes since they weren't seating anyone yet.  After waiting about 10 minutes, another group showed up and was told the wait would take about an hour.  Frustrated, I asked the hostess about our wait and she looked on her small white note sheet and said we're number 14 in line and it will take an hour.  We noticed a small group arriving way after us and asking for a table for two and were seated right away.  The lady in that group was chatting with hostess and telling her what a great job she's doing and to just ignore all the negative comments from the impatient people waiting to her right.  If I knew I had to kiss up to hostess for a faster table, I would have done the same.  A group next to us saw what happened and left very upset over how unprofessional the hostess was acting.\n\nWhen we finally got seated after an hour and 10 minutes wait, we only saw our waitress three times during the entire evening.  I never got her name since she never introduced herself.  We first saw her when she dropped off our waters and took our order.  We never saw her again until my boyfriend noticed her walking by and asked for the check.  I did mention to her that the service was really slow and she replied by saying \"it's opening night\".  Her final visit was dropping off the receipt and we promptly paid our bill in cash so we wouldn't have to wait any longer for her to return.  \n\nIn terms of the food, my boyfriend was satisfied with his Hubert Keller Burger, but my burger was anything but desirable.  I ordered the Angus beef and the patty was falling apart as I bit into it.  The pesto sauce had a very rusty oily taste to it which made the burger very hard to eat.  Additionally, my fries were very over salted and my pepsi was flat. \n  \nI completely understand that opening nights are a bit tricky, but our complete dining experience was horrible.  I wouldn't have mind the wait if the service or food was better.  I have been to the Burger Bar in Las Vegas and very impressed with the food and service.  I even made reservations for Fleur De Lys for my boyfriend's birthday dinner because he is such a big fan of Hubert Keller.  We were both very disappointed with our dining experience.  I'm sure we'll be back in the near future to give Burger Bar another try when all the kinks are figured out and a working beeper/pager system is in place so people won't have to wait around for an hour. \n\nCalled Burger Bar after our horrible dining experience since we didn't have time to wait around another hour and spoke with the manager, Danielle.

I ordered the Kobe burger with jack cheese and peppered bacon on a sourdough roll (they have 3 types of bacon to choose from!). My girlfriend and friends ordered the Country farm burgers, along with onion rings and fries to share. The onion rings were amazing! Lightly battered and crunchy with just the right amount of salt seaoning. A place that serves Anchor Steam Liberty Ale, the perfect burger beer?..wow that's using their noodles! Unfortunately the chef put my medium-rare jack burger on the wrong bun and served it to my girlfriend while I got her medium-well country farm burger on a sesame roll. After a couple of bites into my burger I could tell it wasn't my Kobe medium-rare. The server was very attentive and took my burger back to be redone fresh. My girlfriend liked my Kobe burger so much she kept it and ate it all...medium-rare no less! The manager came over during the redo of my Kobe, apologized profusely, topped off our beers for free, comped my burger...very attentive of her ! The new burger was served to me and it was one of the top three burgs I've ever had. Seared and juicy with medium-crisp bacon. At the end of the meal, a foursome of different flavored milkshakes arrived for all of us, againd comp thanks to the manager! Delicious! The waitress and manager made us feel as if they cared about the problem which was quickly corrected.\n\nI'd give it five stars, but it's in the first week of its opening and the kinks usually take a couple of months to work out. We'll be back soon to enjoy the full experience around Christmas time. The one thing I would recommend to Mr. Keller is to offer some other type of ketchup besides Heinz.

There was no juice left in the meat. We also ordered fries that were good  when we received them, but sadly turned very limp.  The noise level is very,very high. Tables crowded together. Very few tables with a view or window. We were at a wall. Service very slow, but the waiter was nice. At the end, the manager came by and listened to our complaints, but had an o well attitude. I  had part of the meat left and there was just a shrug!  Save your money folks. Yes it is convenient, but that is the only plus.

This was an Angus beef burger with American cheese, bacon, onion, tomato, pickle and fries.  The first one to come was one of the most pathetic excuses I could have imagined for such a high scale place.  It was well done with no pink at all, broken in pieces and overly a very sad example of what a great burger should be.  It was immediately removed with my pickle only half eaten (great pickle by the way).  The second attempt was delivered by what seemed to be the cook whol apologized for the first burger--this one was cooked perfectly medium and looked and tasted good, but not great.  The sesame bun was a little dry.  The bar tender was nice enough to comp a side of onion rings for my inconvenience.  They were the best!  Sadly, the restaurnt charges an extra $.45 for dijon mustard because is it home made.  Otherwise you are forced to use the free French's yellow mustard that I personally do not like.  The onion rings came with no side sauce-a ranch dressing would have been nice.  The fries with the burger were not very crispy but looked like they could achieve greatness in another visit. I love French-style skinny fries, but these were not the best I've had.   I had asked for crispy fries but this request  did not seem to be an option.  Next visit I will do the \"make your own\" concept which others near me ordered and looked much better than mine.  It starts with a burger (beef, chicken, turkey or veggie) and you add all the options, each with their own price.  I find alot of the extras to be nickle and diming for items that should be included (such as dijon mustard).  Apparently mayo, ranch dressing and a few other sauces are free.   I have a personal problem with finding the perfect Sunday burger from 3-5 and had high expectations for this place.  Not sure why this is so difficult in this city of great dining options, but it continues to be a reality.  Still have a few others that are much better, Elite Cafe and Bar Johnny (if Roland is there).  I will go back to the Burger Bar, the bartenders were awesome:  friendly and cute, the concept is good although pricey, and it definately has potential and is a good location.

The foie gras flavor is overwhelmed by the beef and I didn't get any sense of the truffles. In addition, the chocolate milkshake is also over-the-top. I love chocolate. But thick fudge sauce and chocolate chips overpowered me. Together, it doesn't work. While I never expected this to be \"health food,\" I swear I could feel my arteries clogging up with cholesterol.

It was especially glorious during christmas, with the skaters and the tree right across the street.\nTo finish off, we'll be back, in fact i keep making excuses to go to macy's just so i can go back to burger bar.", "author": "susana b."}

We dined early  (7:00 pm or so) on Halloween night and it was already quite crowded, a tribute to Keller's reputation as a chef, since they're not  giving anything away with burger prices ranging upwards from $12.75 to a high water mark of $60.00 for the \"Rossini\", complete with fois gras and truffles.  I greatly enjoyed the \"American Classic\", perfectly cooked, medium rare, complete with American cheese, bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and of course, the requisite garlicky pickle.   (In fact, the accomodating waitstaff brought out a plate of 8 in response to my questioning as to whether the burger would come with one!)  My husband loved his peppercorn burger, and we both gobbled the skinny fries.  We were tempted to have shakes but opted instead for a nice glass of wine and a \"weiss beer\", one of many unusual choices available.  All around us, people seemed to be having a good time and relishing the terrific view of Union Square.", "author": "Bean R."}
