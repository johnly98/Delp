She replied that their Jasmine milk tea comes with matcha. At that point I asked if I could get it without matcha (pretty basic right?). She stated that she couldn't because its in their \"policy\". After listening to her pretty much yelling that it was her policy, she kindly replaced it for a cherry blossom milk tea.\n\nThe cherry blossom milk tea was bland and the milk taste overpowered the cherry blossom tea taste.

Decided to try it out since we were pretty parched. \n\nThey do carbonated drinks with Boba, which was actually kind of interesting. They offered Yogurt in it, but we both thought that probably would have tasted awful had we decided to include Yogurt in it. \n\nWe're pretty sure it was torani syrup for the tea we got since we saw the pumping, but I don't really care. It was a refreshing drink, pretty cheap and the Boba was good. Having good Boba is a big deal for us when we order drinks. \n\nService was adequate, nothing to write home about. Not sure if we'd drive all the way out to chinatown just for this place, but I certainly enjoyed trying the carbonated tea drink with the boba in it. \n\nEntrance of store could use more seats in my opinion. A bit of an awkward set up with everything being more to the back and then a long bench kind of placed up front for people to wait. Seems like there's enough space to put in a couple more tables.", "author": "Jay K."}

And by minutes, it was a 12 minute walk from Union Square to the outskirts of Chinatown.\n\nThe interior is spacious and cute. It's perfect for high schoolers to hang out and play games or study. (Just a cool story I thought I'd like to share)\n\nWhat's interesting about these drinks is that they include \"Asian puff cream\" in their milk teas, which give it a sweeter and a tad thicker flavor (like sea salt crema) than most places. However, unless you have a sweet tooth, you will most likely have to cut down on the sugar, as the cream makes it pretty sweet already. I tried it once at 50% sugar, and again at 0% sugar. Personally, I'd probably go for 25% or 30% next time. In spite of the sweetness irregularity, I found the actual tea to be quite strong (a good thing in my book)! \n\nThey also serve food, but in terms of milk tea only, it's an interesting concept, and I can see this place being a solid stop for milk tea in Chinatown.

Not sure why, but somehow the name caught us, although we didn't initally go in because we were still being touristy and walking around.  This store is actually located just outside ChinaTown, and we happened to pass by it a second time and decided to go in.  I thought the place looked super clean and new, so I checked it out on Yelp, and yup, only a few reviews, so I guess this place just recently opened.\n\nTheir menu is not extensive like other places, but they seem to focus more on their teas.  At the top of the menu there was a section of drinks that all included milk puff, and when I asked about it, the cashier had a hard time explaining.  She basically said that it was similar to the salted cream you can get on top of drinks except it's sweet, and it goes on the bottom on their cups.  I was intrigued since I've never heard of this kind of topping before, so I decided to go with the Matcha Latte with Milk Puff with pearls.  My friend is lactose, so she was browsing through their tea options and settled on the Cherry Blossom Green Tea.\n\nThe wait for the drinks took a little bit longer than expected, but I was okay with that because I noticed that for my friend's tea, it was fresh brewed, so that was a pleasant surprise.  The total wait time I think took about 15 minutes, which might not sound like long, but at the time, we were the only customers in the store, so they could work on efficiency a bit.  Drinks are sealed, which is nice, and the cup and decoartion on the seal is quite cute as well.  Purely aesthetic, but hey it doesn't hurt to have a pretty cup to drink from haha.\n\nFirst sip of my drink, the matcha latte is pretty much what you'd expect and not too sweet, so that was nice, but I had to sort of dig my straw into the Milk Puff to get a taste of it.  Oh boyyyyyy, this is some pretty good stuff.  A bit hard to explain, since I feel like this topping might be unique to this place.  It's a bit creamy with a slight sort of custard taste and sweetness, and it is like, so I guess that's why they chose to name it Milk Puff.  Not sure if this is some new topping from Asia, but I'm sold on it.  The pearls however could use some work.  They had a slight firm texture, which I like, but they kind of didn't have any flavor to them.  My friend's Cherry Blossom Tea was extremely floral and fragrant.  The flavor was wonderful, and I think she got it at 50% sweetness, so the bitterness of the tea came through, but it wasn't overbearing.\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed my experience here.  My friend and I already discussed coming back sometime even though we're in South Bay, so SF is kind of a drive, but the drinks were great.  They also have a cheese milk foam that is also quite intriguing, so I'll have to give it a try next time.  I would have given 5 stars, except the workers weren't too great an English, so there were some difficulties when ordering, and initially, my drink didn't have pearl in it, so I had to ask them to remake it, even though I had already waited like 15 minutes, so -1 star for that.  But if you're in the area, you should definitely check them out, and try one of their yummy fresh brewed teas, or something with milk puff!!", "author": "Brendan D."}

It is very easy to spot,  is nicely decorated,  and spacious lounging/waiting area for their guests. So,  why less stars? \n\nTheir register is right by the door and they make their customers wait for quite a ridiculous amount of time even when there isn't a lot of backorder. When I arrived there,  there were two gentlemen before me waiting for who knows how long. They ordered together,  and I was surprised that rather than getting my order right after,  the woman had me wait a very long time before she eventually got to me. There was already a woman making drinks on the other end of the counter and another woman messing around with her coworkers. I understand that they do phone orders and they want to make their workplace fun,  but literally ignoring a customer right in front of you while messing with your coworkers is just plain rude.  \n\nWhen I finally got my cherry blossom green tea without milk or cheese foam from the older woman on the other end of the counter (who was working hard the entire time in my opinion), I was a bit disappointed with my drink. Yes,  they allowed me to have no foam on top (their drink selection is pretty much either milky, foam on top, sparkling tonic, or thick smoothie), but the tea itself was rather bitter (bottom of the pot type of bitter) even with my lychee jelly topping masking it a tidbit.  \n\nPersonally,  based on my experience,  I wouldn't want to go again during my timed lunch break since it is a rather long process from start to finish.

Especially since Cool Tea seems to have shut down a couple of their locations.  That was my go-to for tea on the Chinatown/NB border.  But when we walked up to HiTea, we were awed by the shiny, new shop with the big adorable signage.\n\nWe were also totally puzzled by the menu!  Now I'll admit, I'd never had milkfoam or cheesefoam style tea.  I just haven't seen it around here.  The menu is puzzlingly, needlessly complicated.  I totally appreciate the level of customizability in drink choices--but the layout of the menu is bizarre.  The font is soooo small, the illustrations don't illustrate anything about the drink categories (because they're too small), but just take up space.  \n\nSo, here's the skinny.  Hopefully the owners figure out a way to fix the menu because it's bonkers confusing.  There's puff cream and there's milk foam.  Puff cream gets all mixed into your milk tea.  Milk foam sits on top.  There's two types of milk foam--salt milk foam and cheese milk foam and you can choose which kind.  If you want milk tea but you have a foam phobia, you can get it without the foam or cream and they call it \"Classic Aromatic\" on the menu.  If you want puff cream all up ins, it's called \"Originate,\" and if you want milk foams all up ons, they call it a \"Pure Milk.\"  I know.\n\nIf you want some of that salty foam or cheesy business, but don't want a milk tea, they have a Teaspresso called a \"Pop Star.\"  If you're scared and confused you can just get a snow or \"Italian Snow\" or I'm not sure which it is because ITALIAN is capitalized on the menu but not Snow, so maybe it's just an \"Italian.\"  If you're lactose intolerant then maybe try the \"SPECIAL\"  Iced Sparkle Tea or just take a Lactaid and live a little.\n\nAll that said, the tea is yummy, the shop is cute and spacious (for SF), and the staff is really nice.  I've been here like four times already.  I think my boyfriend would drink a whole cup of just cheese foam.  I really like the Royal Ceylon milk tea with pudding and pearl.  \n\nSuggestion to the owners:  Do drink specials for people with ADHD who can't read your menu.  So they can just point at the board and be like, yeah I'll just try that I guess.  (Like how ShareTea just has a bunch of pictures of drinks up).  I guess I can only speak for myself, but I know I'd just randomly try whatever the drink of the day was.\n\nLast but not least, @ The girl who posted outrage that her Matcha was made from powder--I hate to break it to you, since powder apparently gives your cousin mud butt or whatever.

I can say after trying this place on multiple occasions that this place does a few things pretty well and has become my go-to for tea in the area. \n\nFirst, the tea! Its probably the best in the immediate area (or at the very least tied with Cool Tea Bar). My favorite tea here is currently the peach oolong tea with agar boba. Its nice, and I can taste the strong tea flavor come through. The selection is not expansive as others tea places, but they do the tea and boba part well here. \n\nAmbience wise, It's all brand new and clean. Big plus! Also the space is pretty roomy. The tables and chairs are all in the back. This makes for a quiet and sort of private space to drink, study, converse with friends, etc. Every time I take a look, I see one or two people studying or working in this area. Its a decent space for sure. \n\nHey, I'm in Chinatown. I can get lunch for under $5! That's why initially I thought that this place was expensive, but for boba the price is only slightly above average (but only very slightly). $3.75 for most of the drinks, extra 50 cents for additional boba toppings. I think they cups are decently big, so I think its an okay price. .   \n\nThe tea baristas are all very pleasant. I made a comment about how I should have signed up for five star earlier, since I only just recently signed up, and they credited me a few extra points toward a free drink or snack, out of kindness of their own hearts. Good service!\n\nFinally, for snacks they don't have popcorn chicken but they have some chicken wings, and curly fries. The snacks are all about $5 or less, though I have not partaken.", "author": "Huy V."}

Jasmine actually tastes a little like a mix of matcha and jasmine green tea. But their specialty stuff makes everything comes together great! Both the Cream Puff and crema (Himalayan or cheese) are very creamy and addictive. Milk tea (instead of tea) with crema is pure indulgence! \n\nHowever, I'm not sure how fresh and healthy the ingredients are-the crema is very thick and stays that way, but usually fresh cream melts pretty fast. So I'm not sure if the pricing is fair.\n\nI have yet to try teas and boba toppings, but I will. Fried chicken wings comes hot, tasty and juicy.", "author": "Liz H."}

You can adjust the sweetness of your drink to your liking.

It barely had any matcha in it and felt very watered down. When I got the drink I thought hmm it was barely green, but I thought it would be like the matcha milk tea from Gong Cha (which was barely green too). That was not the case. All I tasted was sweetness and I asked them to make it less sweet. The puff cream was different, maybe because I had never had it before but I decided it was not for me but might be for other people. Overall, I am not a fan. I would come back to see if it would be any different but it does not look like it from the other reviews. Minus one star for being overly sweet when requested less sweet. Minus one star for barely tasting the tea and being watered down. Minus one star for there 5 stars being down.", "author": "Mike G."}

Then a orange koala, just there, sitting on the tree chilling. Black wood bench, tall table with tall chairs (HEART) \nI like their back room the most, cozy and relaxing however the pillows doesn't match the painting nor the feel. It seems they're still finishing, there was some tools laying around, some loose paint chips and that loose nail. \nIt's a clean place, considering its new :D\nHopefully they will keep it neat, clean and clutter free and not overwhelmed their customers with 200 different drinks and food menus plaster all over their wall (don't be a quickly) \nService was okay, there was 2 girls behind the counter, one elderly lady and a young lady, elderly lady looked at us and waited for the young girl to take our order. I don't know what that was about. \nDrink was ready within 4 minutes? they weren't busy so why 4 minutes for ONE DRINK. \nPractice makes perfect. \n\nUmmm ... Price is cheap (I think), range from $2.99-$4 (plus tax) from what I remember (didn't really care since I wasn't the one ordering, just wanted to seat and sneeze) \n\nFirst time- 3 weeks ago, free drink- regular milk tea with  some pudding like substance (later found out its puffcream) I don't know what to think of it. Idea is original but taste was weird. Not bad weird but interesting. It was too sweet for my taste, but my cousin likes it (she's a sugar maniac) \nSecond time- Earlier yesterday, Matcha milk tea with 'PUFFCREAM'... ummm straight up powder! Cousin got the bubble guts, you know that's not good. I stop drinking after 4 sips and she forced me to drink 3 more sips so it's not going to a waste and she tried to finish it. \nThird time- Yesterday night, went with friends after dinner, they like boba too. Ordered salted coconut milk tea, avocado milk smoothie and grapefruit black tea with lychee jelly. All 3 is a fail. Friends didn't like it. Salted drink had no coconut taste. Avocado milk smoothie- 5% avocado and 95% milk and ice. Grapefruit Black tea- flat, watered down and why was there lotus seed inside?\n\nWill not be purchasing my drinks here. Sorry : (\n\nIt's located in Chinatown, soooo parking will be difficult unless you're lucky enough to find and pay for meter or just parking garage (majority is $3 an hour or flat rate for $10/$15 or personal parking lot for $4/$5 an hour) \n\nI gave it 3 stars because it's a new place, clean and smelled nice. Price is cheap but for something that's bland yeah $2.99 is good enough. Service is alright, could be better in time. \n*whisper* there was a cute ish guy that night, I think he's the son or sorts of the owners because they were eating all together.", "author": "Fiona B."}

The milk foam has very rich texture and it's very tasty. The matcha was so good too. We will come back for more often. So happy to find a good boba place in Chinatwon. Definitely recommend my friends to give a visit.", "author": "nellie z."}
