No. However when fresh, they are delicious, but what fresh donut isn't. \n\nI also rated lower because a couple of times I went, I actually had a cold and/or stale donut.

So maybe it's a freshness thing. \n\nBut still not the best donuts I've ever had. Just a convenient late night donut fix. Not better than your average donut shop.", "author": "Josie W."}

One hot day, my coworker and I decided to stop and get a lot of donuts to bring back. I had one custard for my SO, and a few other variety of donuts like two custard bars, two fritters, some bread pudding, and the big ass giant donut.\n\nBy the time the donuts were eaten... the custard had a sour taste to it... not thinking that it could have gone bad.... but my coworker decided to call and ask if the custard had a lemony taste to it. One of the employees,  Jeff picked up the phone and told her that it's not supposed to be sour or taste lemony for the custard one. He told her to come back anytime and he will replace the donuts. All the donuts had the custard cream all over them so none of them could be eaten. \n\nWe went back to the donut shop on a colder day and told them what happened. The guy at the register was near Jeff and he heard the conversation. So he was nice enough to help us. Instead of getting the custard we got the bread pudding since it's supposed to be THAT good. \n\nBasically what we paid for and what was replaced, we're supposed to pay the difference, but since the difference was so little, he waived the cost. I am very happy with the customer service and their bread pudding REALLY good. \n\nI am on a keto diet, but it was worth breaking keto for that bread pudding! \n\nWill definitely be back since it's a few stops via bus and a block of walking!", "author": "Eugenia W."}

This place has a complete old school feel to it and their products are proudly displayed at the front window of the store front.  The normal doughnuts are on the bottom shelf but the eye level top shelf has some pretty crazy sized doughnuts which are about the size of a cake.\n\nTo me I'm a fan of the old fashioned so I went with an old fashioned glazed.  They have more of a surface to glaze ratio and also have more of a crunch than the softer cake type doughnuts.

I can't help it. I'm hooked. I'm addicted. The large variety they offer, the fact that they're always soft when you receive them AND the next day as well, and the fact that they're opened 24 hours is enough to get my vote. \n\nIt's a super basic shop inside. You have two small tables to the side and then some counter seats, otherwise you're basically stopping by to get some donuts to go. Donut prices are also very affordable for what it is and where they're at. On my most recent visit (like.. 2 days ago.. hehe.) I was able to get 8 donuts + a dozen donut holes for around $15. That's way less than what I would've paid had I gone to Krispy Kreme and only got a dozen donuts. \n\nWhile it seems odd to give a donut shop such a high rating, they truly earned it. The workers are always friendly and open to giving suggestions and you're basically able to fill your munchies if you were to come to the area high. Plus, people tend to bar hop on Polk St. so the fact that you're able to drink some then get some donuts should be enough of the deciding factor. \n\nParking may be a little tough as it is in the city and every spot is pretty much metered unless you park further away.

Yes, it was the time vampires and werewolves roam the streets, plus a few zombies and lady boys to add to your diverse collection. Like many say the best time here is after a night of binge drinking or being kicked out of your overpriced loft, or both! \n\nAhh Bob's Donut & Pastry Shop. The spot hipsters and millennials think \"they\" discovered, yet ask any Polk street vagrant and he'll tell ya... Bob has been around since 1960! Here's from the lips of Bob...\n\n\"Bob's Donuts opened in 1960 as a family owned and operated establishment that has become a cornerstone in the Nob Hill community. Our family continues this tradition to this day, dedicated to preserving the art of making handmade donuts. We are proud to be one of the last independent donut shops that still make our donuts and pastries from scratch. Our donuts have a classic taste...\"\n\nNow don't expect fancy here. Expect something from Hill Valley from Back to The Future, sans the root beer float and Chip. You can expect counter stools and small rickety cafe tables. Stacks of pink to-go donut boxes clutter half the counter top and a crew somewhat as dated as the stools. On my latest visits a couple of younger employees liven the place up. One kid blasts gangsta rap behind the counter! No longer is it only Bob and grumpy beehives working. I'm not sure if the latest hires are to entice the young hipster drunks, but it seems to work with the myriad of customers I saw - coming and going. Old and young, all wanting donuts! I've had the maple bar, old fashion plain, chocolate donut, cake donut, glazed donut, etc. I have yet to try the legendary apple fritter or the gigantic donut! \n\nBob's Donuts (did the hipsters add \"pastry\" to it?) is one old school donut shop! The coffee is average at best, but damn it works at 2am. The donuts on the other hand, are exceptional and always freshly made. Fluffy AF! And yes, Bob has a loyal following not only with the drunks, but those that know the warm fluffy donuts freshly pop out before 5am. \n\nAll in all, I recommend trying Bob's at any hours at least once, but if you want the full effect come after midnight and before the sunrises. That's all part of the Bob's Donut urban 'lore. Try the donut eating contest Bob has going too - that might be fun (or annoying) with a group of sniffling hipsters, but I'd refrain from the contest showdown with the pimp vs. John. Yet, today Bob's Donut is no longer just for the drunks and hood rats... it's for all to enjoy! \n\nAnd \"she ain't nothing more than a pit-bull with lipstick!\" I think I heard Bob say that once... well it was Twilight time! Maybe I was drunk! Or perhaps the drunk behind of me! Uggh! Bob!", "author": "Eric R."}

I'll tell you now, NOTHING.\n\nI came here on the recommendation of two different friends during my most recent trip to SF. They both said it was a must if I was visiting and looking for the authentically good spots that the city has in terms of food. On my last day my friend and I said why not and made our way to Bob's.\n\nLocated in the Nob Hill neighborhood, the spot itself doesn't look like much from the outside but the second you walk face first into the smell of freshly made doughnuts you know you've found something good. Its a long shop that has stools and tables where you're able to sit at. Besides that this spot seems like a place where people come and go on a regular basis.\n\nWhen it came time to order I stuck with a chocolate eclair ($4.50) that was definitely screaming my name as I looked over all the glorious options they had available. This spot is also known for it's massive doughnuts (basically the size of a human head) that goes for about $12. Definitely an ideal dessert to tackle with a friend.\n\nAfter we ordered we walked to a nearby coffee shop with outdoor seating and enjoyed our desserts. This is definitely a good option if you're looking to stay in the area to enjoy what you just ordered.\n\nThe service and staff were great too!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-05", "description": "I know the doughnuts here have been the talk of SF for years, and I've been here several times before, but was craving doughnuts (thanks to fab fellow yelper, Cheryl M.), so thought I'd give it another try. I've always viewed Bob's as mediocre, because I'm always comparing raised glazed doughnuts to Stan's in Santa Clara, which is my all time favorite, specifically for their raised glazed.\n\nDon't repeat my mistake by coming here on a Friday afternoon! After being told they were completely out of their raised glazed and crumb doughnuts, they informed me that Friday's are notoriously busy for them, as many folks order dozens to bring into their offices. The owner said people sometimes purchase 10 dozen on Fridays. Can you believe that beautiful sight?!? They were going to make more later, but I was certainly not going to stick around for 2 hours for raised glazed doughnuts. \n\nAs a result, I ended up purchasing:\n\n- an apple fritter - I like the slightly crispy glazed parts on the outside, but the inside is way to doughy for me. Very very few bits of apples actually inside theirs, but I'm not really in it for the apples anyway.\n\n- doughnut holes - These were my only alternative to the raised glazed, which, again, they were out of. I think these were sitting around for a while, as they were a little dry. These, I find, tend to be good only when they're super duper fresh, which these most definitely were not.\n\n- an old fashioned glaze - In general, cake doughnuts tend to be my least favorite, but theirs was surprisingly good. They had just made these, and they were perfect! Ever so slightly crisp on the edges with just the right amount of glaze. I should've just bought 2 of these and would've been happy.\n\nThere are also some ginormous doughnuts that you'll see in their window. I mean huge, just see my pic. If you can polish one off in less than 2 minutes, you get the doughnut free, a t-shirt, and your name on their Hall of Fame. Maybe Joey Chestnut can do his stomach expansion training with these if he gets bored with the hot dogs. Always best to vary your workout routine, after all. \n\nAmbiance? Absolutely none, as you can tell from my pic. No old fashioned diner-type charm even. I'd take my order to go, like most everyone else.\n\nWhile I was there the workers were laughing about a customer who had just phoned, requesting doughnuts formed in the shape of a letter. The owner chimed in about a call she recently got from someone who wanted a doughnut made in the shape of the Transamerica Pyramid. Now, that's a creative and an interesting business venture for someone with an entrepreneurial doughnut spirit, though unlikely very profitable. Anyway, the doughnut maker nixed all that when she said they only make doughnuts in one shape - round. That was my laugh for the afternoon.\n\nOverall, I still think of Bob's as a mediocre doughnut joint, and would save all the calories here and \"spend\" them all at Stan's in Santa Clara any day. However, if you're craving doughnuts and in the area, Bob's is a good option, as opposed to any of the chains, even Krispy Kreme.

Boring I know, but they didn't really have much to choose from by this time. So, lesson learned - come super early bc they don't keep the full stock for a brunch bite craving.\n\nMe and the BF ordered a normal glazed old fashioned, an almond ring, and a savory Ham and cheese croissant. By no means do I consider myself a donut connoisseur, but based on the high reviews on Yelp I definitely expected something tastier. The glazed donut was good but not grand, the almond ring needed a little more flavor love, and the savory croissant was good but would have been better if it was warm with the cheese slightly melted. If you're expecting something to Krispy Kreme; don't bother bc you'll have wasted your time. This is a smaller establishment that makes their donuts in batches based off foot traffic times.

Right away we noticed there was a line out the door!  Mind you it was a Sunday night and it was pretty cold outside.  Still a line!  Man, I was getting more and more excited wondering if the hype is real.  \n\nStanding in line we can see through their display window the array of donuts they had for sale.....Especially those huge donuts that I swear were calling for me.  Since it was my first time here, I asked for a dozen of anything the cashier recommended.  We had a great mix of glazed, chocolate, sugar, cake, etc donuts.  I couldn't wait long enough to take a picture as I bit into my first donut of the night.  \n\nI've been to many popular donut places: Sacramento, Portland, Vegas, San Diego, but THIS place was as good as it gets.  I'll for sure be back to get TWO dozen: a dozen for the ride home and a dozen for home hehe.", "author": "Troy T."}

I arrived around 8am and there was already a line out the door, but it goes quickly. A friendly lady greets you at the counter and assembles your order - note for first timers, it's best to have a good idea of what you want/like going in or you're going to get an assortment which might not include what you personally love. If I'm going to eat a donut, it's going to be an old fashioned but for the rest of the guests, I got apple fritters, cake crumb donuts, and regular glazed. Also a pro tip: if they have a donut that just came out of the fryer, ask for it!!! Hot and fresh is the best part about this place and if you get a dozen fresh from the fryer, you won't regret it. Price point will put you right under $20 for a dozen, so roughly $1.50 a donut but more for the bigger ones like the apple fritters. Overall, busy busy place but the selection is fantastic (if you get there early enough as they tend to run out of the popular flavors early on).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-20", "description": "Pretty disappointed by all the hype for this donut shop. My friend and I came on a Tuesday around 3 pm, and there was no line and maybe one other person at their sit-down tables. We came after hearing so many people talk about \"the challenge,\" which is basically eating a large donut (worth $12) in 3 minutes or less. But after arriving at the shop, we decided to just get the regular donuts because we had just finished having lunch and didn't have much space left in our stomachs.\n\nI liked how they had a variety of options besides just donuts. When we went they had cinnamon buns and chocolate croissants! Chocolate croissants?! Yup. I've been on the look out for the best chocolate croissants in the NorCal area, and was pretty excited to try it out. My friend on the other hand got a buttermilk donut. We also got a cake crumble to-go for another friend. \n\nI think part of my disappointment with this place was when we were paying for our donuts and we asked the owner to see how big the big donut was (out of curiosity and to gage how much space we need in our stomachs for next time). She turned around to show it to us, and then proceeded to tell us that she didn't think we could do it because she hadn't seen any girl finish \"the big donut\" before. Yikes! I just looked on their website and see girl names, so I don't really know what she was talking about. \n\nMy chocolate croissant was very mediocre. The only good thing about it was it had chocolate filling throughout the croissant, unlike many others that just have some parts filled. I tried a bit of my friend's buttermilk donut and thought it tasted okay. It definitely had a distinct taste because of the buttermilk. I think the donuts would have tasted better when fresh, or at least slightly heated up. We decided to heat it up using the microwave provided by the front of the shop. But I soon realized that after heating it up my croissant got flat instead of the crispy and flaky I wanted (my fault).\n\nDespite the change in texture of my croissant, I was able to finish it and still thinks it tasted pretty good. But it's nothing to write home to mother about. My friend, on the other hand, was not able to finish her buttermilk donut (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES donuts). The cake crumble that we got to-go was also not that great and also went un-finished. My friend thinks its because it lost a certain air of freshness to it.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by this place, especially because there are so many good reviews and people talking about this place. To top it all off, I was very turned off by the half-gallon of half-&-half milk for the coffee just sitting out on the counter for who knows how long. Probably won't be coming back any time soon, but I really do want to give this place another shot (perhaps sometime in the far future).", "author": "Tammy C."}

The cooking area was filthy, the long-haired donut maker should've been wearing a hair net, and we were invisible to the cashier as we stood directly in front of her while she continued to talk to someone who was already seated and with a donut in hand. And get this, she completely stuffed half a dozen donuts into a small brown bag when there were pink donut boxes in small and large sizes stacked everywhere. She smashed all of our donuts into the bag! Sloppy. That's why I don't have a photo of the donuts!! My +1 and I ate two donuts and chucked the rest.

Nothing is open but the local coffee shops and maybe some donut shops. \n\nFast forward this event......so the goal was to find the cruffin store in Nob Hill. We found it. Just our luck it was still closed. We wanted some food and coffee so we went up the street around the corner and BAM....Yelp led us to Bob's Donuts. 4.5 stars and thousands of reviews. Ok so this place is legit right? Sorry not the case here. Just from the beginning the lady behind the counter never acknowledged my presence and mind you I was standing directly in front of her staring at her as she babbled to a seated customer. Ok maybe they are good friends, but damn say something! Like, yo Island boi, I'll be with you in a few. Acknowledge I'm there. Anyway, that was just the first of the negatives I noticed. \n\nSo the donut fryers were busy, as it should be because heck it's a donut shop and it's early in the morning. People want that sweet fried pastry all glazed up or filled. What I noticed is a dirty, unorganized prep area. The food service saying of \"clean as you go\" did not apply here. Even the donut maker was grubby. The shop itself was littered with trash under the tables and chairs. Nothing was wiped down. \n\nThe donuts themselves weren't even presented well. Glaze on them look like a bunch of kids put them together. We ordered about a half dozen mixed donuts and was baffled when the lady stuffed all 6 donuts in a small bag. Really?!?! Ahhh where's the presentation? Donuts that I ate were ok. I've had much better. \n\nSo my recommendation to anyone looking at the 4.4 stars this shop has on yelp.......IT's A FACADE!!

Am I finally seeing Bob's Donuts, where the brigade of gargantuan donuts is casting ominous shadows on the sunny sidewalk outside?  Yes!  Yes, it is!  I've finally arrived to conquer and divide these donut mongerers, specifically the big cahona - the one they call the doomsday donut (just kidding, no one calls it that, but me).  \n\nWhy do I dub it thee doomsday donut?  Well, its quite simple actually.  You are doomed to either the walk of shame by failing to eat the entire donut in the 3-minute challenge, or you are doomed to have a date with the toilet after ingesting the entire donut in an unnatural 3 minutes time.  Like I said, either way you are kind of SOL.  So all this talk about a 3 minute challenge - what is it, right?  Here's the dealio: if you love, love, love donuts you at least owe it to yourself to put your love to test in Bob's Giant Donut Challenge.  If you think you may be able to eat a 3-lb donut in 3 minutes or less, then step right on up.  To participate in this challenge, you must first make a reservation (yes, an actual donut reservation) where you list what time you'll be in to complete the challenge, and what type of yeast donut you want.  Do you want chocolate icing?  Do you want sprinkles?  Once you're donut is specially made, you have 2 minutes to eat the entire donut if you want a refund (it's a $10 donut, y'all), a free Bob's Donut t-shirt and your name on the wall fame.  Eat it in 3 minutes and you get everything except the refund.\n\nOkay, with the logistics out of the way - I was crazy enough to try (TRY, being the operative word) and compete in this challenge.  Because I'm all about sprinkles, I asked for chocolate icing and sprinkles on my donut...but looking back now - that wasn't the wisest choice.  If you are going to do this thing, make the donut as plain as possible...every little sprinkle counts.  Without recounting my entire failure, I'll just say that I did not complete the challenge.  I, the self-pronounced donut queen, did not pass the test...I'm a failure to donuts everywhere.  Despite this atrocity, I loved the dense donut.  I'd like to say that I remember all donuts that I eat, but this one was definitely one for the books.  Even if you don't order up a giant donut, the regular-sized ones are just as fantastic.  My fianc\u00e9 and I both loved the apple fritter along with the long john!  I mean, these are some sexy donuts, and they aren't badly priced either.  \n\nIf only I lived in San Francisco, Bob's Donuts would be my newest watering hole!  I do believe that Bob's Donuts is a must-see, amongst all the other attractions, when coming to this wonderful city.  No great city would be complete with a great donut shop.", "author": "Lauren K."}

Whenever my boyfriend and I are in the area we try to pop in to grab a donut or apple fritter. The fresh ones are the best because they are so warm and fluffy that they just melt in your mouth. I think they start selling the apple fritters after 5pm. The prices are reasonable. There's some stools at the bar and a couple of tables to sit at. There's usually some kind of documentary playing on their TV. The only bad thing is that it's hard finding street parking in this area.", "author": "Nicole S."}

I came here with friends after a night out (around 12am) and there was a line out the door. The line moves pretty slowly which was a bit frustrating. My friends and I decided to get a bunch of donuts and split them.\nWe order 2 Crumb Cake Donuts, 1 glazed donut, 1 chocolate eclair, 1 apple fritter, and 1 HUGE donut.\nThe Crumb Cake donut was my favorite. It was soft, fresh, and the right amount of sweetness. It felt deceivingly guilt free!

As soon as I saw that, I was just about to walk out of the store. But the lady asked me what I wanted right when I wanted to walk out so I just bought the crumb donut anyway. \n\nWalking back to work, I took it out of the bag and ate a bite. As soon as I ate it, I see that the donut had black marks on it. I examine it even closer to make sure it's not just burnt marks and it wasn't. If you closely look at the picture I attached, you can see that the whole bottom of the donut just looks so dirty... After that, I just threw my donut away immediately. It's okay because the one bite I ate wasn't that satisfying anyway. Sigh, so disappointing.

There happened to be a fresh batch of donuts ready, and I opted for chocolate old fashioned as well as a maple bar plus milk, which cost $4.90 altogether. The donuts tasted great and I can only imagine the other flavors tasting just as good, even the giant donuts Bob's is famous for. I'm glad this place is nowhere near a BART station because I would be going way too often if that were the case!", "author": "Edwina D."}

I tried the traditional cake donut with maple glaze and sprinkles. Super delicious, the only critique is the doughnut was heavy on that malty taste. Still super good though. \n\nWhat gets the \"Hands-Down-Delicious-Come-Back-For-More Award\" is their old fashioned donut. The thing tastes like a funnel cake with icing.

I went twice on a recent trip to San Fran... once around 3pm and once around 9pm... and both times they were FRESHLY frying the donuts.  And YESSSS they are absolutely amazing.  First time, we HAD to get the giant donut.  The giant donut was good and would be able to feed 10+ people... I've seen pictures of people using the giant donut as their wedding cake!  The second time I came, I opted for just a single glazed donut... and that was heavenly.  The freshest and tastiest and BEST EVER donut.  The donut was tastier in normal size... lighter, fluffier, more glaze per donut inch lol.  The giant donut was good, but it was much denser... more for the pictures and the novelty of it.

I was tempted, but I just had brunch and was going to go to Alcatraz afterwards so I didn't want to plague my friends with a seasick friend haha.\n\n- Timbits (I mean, donut holes): these are so nostalgic of the True North strong and free :P I've never seen a non-Tim Hortons donut shop ever sell donut holes, but I guess here in America there isn't any Timmy's haha. Anyways, these donut holes were so nostalgic of little bites of Canada hehe. \n- Classic Glaze: this was recommended to me by my co-workers, being the one donut that isn't overly sweet, and the best of all. I would say it lived up to expectations! It wasn't too too sweet, and light and fluffy on the inside.\n- Maple Old Fashioned: this wasn't the best, which is partly why this is 4 stars and not 5. The dough felt like it was drenched in oil and fat (well, it's donuts so what was I expecting haha) but I definitely liked the regular donut batter is a lot better. It was pretty funny because one of my friends said that the maple tasted almost like curry LOL. I guess that's one way to describe it? XP\n\nYou wouldn't think there's any notable service at a hole-in-the-wall and donut shop like this, but the cashier guy was really nice. The folks in front of us had ordered a dozen classic glazed donuts, and he was recommending they try an old-fashioned one, but the couple said they like their classic glazed and they were fine, and so he gave them a free old fashioned donut in their box to try! That was nice of him. Overall, I was quite content with the sugary treats, and I'd definitely come back to have another classic glaze soon!", "author": "Joanna C."}

It was around 12:30AM. I wouldn't call myself a donut person in any regards but I wanted to accompany my friend while she sobered up. \n\nI did my due diligence for this place after the fact and it turns out that we did all the necessary things to make our experience very similar to the other reviewers that gave this donut shop such high praise.\n\n- Visited the shop during the sweet-spot period: 12-2AM when the donuts and pastries are at their freshest.\n- Noticed that the line cook was deep frying a batch of cinnamon rolls and decided to order that as we were guaranteed it would be freshly made.\n- The visit occurred after a night of at least a moderate level of alcohol consumption where the mind state is slightly altered but slowly recovering.\n\nMy friend and I were *very* happy at our cinnamon rolls, which we consumed with sips of milk. Each bite was simply perfect - the dough was still quite warm and very fluffy and pillowy so that it easily dissolved in your mouth AND there was just that right amount of glaze so that you can taste it but you can still taste the dough. I don't like too much glaze on my rolls as it can make a roll just taste more like sugar and make it past the sugar threshold for me.\n\nKeep in mind that for a perfect repeat visit the following conditions I listed earlier must apply. I can't visit later in the day as that would ruin my appetite for the next meal and the dough wouldn't be as fresh. From previous experiences with donuts I don't appreciate them as much when I'm stone-cold sober, even if it was paired with great coffee. Should I find myself in the area again late night after a good drinking session, I know where to go to sober up. I also hope that the stars align and we find ourselves in the front of the line when the apple fritters are being made.", "author": "Isabella B."}

It wasn't bad, however I've had far better donuts. The donuts just tasted old and oily, which I know is part of coming in when they haven't been freshly made. But the almond ring was really dry, I had a couple bites and it wasn't bad I'm guessing it's delicious fresh. Unfortunately, when I had it it was obviously old and so I can't rate it assuming how good it must taste fresh. The Apple Pandowdy was actually gross though. It left that film of oil around your mouth which is not something I wand when I'm already feeling guilty for splurging on such a dense sweet treat. You can tell they just use their old unsold donuts and chop them up and mix them with apples and icing to make this. It looks glorious, however the taste was pale in comparison. I'd recommend maybe just  trying their regular donuts and coming when they are making them fresh.", "author": "Kathleen F."}

According to him, these are supposedly the best donuts in the SF area; thus, I had high expectations. \n\nThe Original Glaze is my favorite so far. It was super doughy and chewy which I really enjoyed. Compared to Krispy Kreme's donuts, these are way more doughy, chewy, and less sweet. You don't feel that unhealthy while eating these because they don't taste overly oily and sweet. The original glaze is a classic but a must-try for good donut shops. You just gotta try the classics first before rollin' into the wild ones. \n\nThe Maple Glaze was a good runner-up. I still liked the original glaze more; however, these were still pretty good. These were sweeter than the original glaze and it obviously had a maple syrup kinda flavor to it. This is a must for the syrup lovers out there!\n\nThe Apple Fritter was my least favorite I'd got to admit. I know people go nuts for these but apple and cinnamon flavors aren't my favorite flavors in the entire world. It's also probably because I ate this one last, which was over a 3 day span. So obviously the Fritter wasn't fresh, hot, or crispy anymore. However, I still thought this was good! \n\nFinal verdict: If I ever get a chance to stop by Bob's Donuts again, I'd definitely will! I hope to try other flavors and their donut holes, even the gigantic donut sounds super good. Possibly I can finish it in 3 mins and win a cool shirt? Maybe.", "author": "Amy H."}

I gave them a call, placed an order for three of the ridiculously large donuts, and came in at 7 AM to give it a shot with two of my cousins. None of us finished the donuts in the allotted three minutes, but I got close and finished three quarters of it. Once the time was up though, my eating didn't stop. Even after consuming what is probably the equivalent of 9 donuts, I kept picking away at the addicting donut. IT'S THAT GOOD. \n\nAlthough I knew Bob's is highly regarded, I thought the challenge donut wouldn't be as amazing as the regular donuts. I guess I figured it would be just about the quantity and not the quality, but I was wrong! Instead of the sheer size of the donut being the most memorable aspect, I found that the amazing taste was the most memorable part. Bob's makes the best old fashioned donut out there; no doubt about it. I definitely want to come back and try more than just the glazed donut.", "author": "Naeem B."}

The reason for my \"Meh\" review is the counter person. The little old lady who packages your donuts and takes payment needs to do something else in the business. She was short in patience (bad bad bad customer service), and right after handling boxes and putting drinks in the fridge, used her bare hands to pick up the donuts we requested and put them in the boxes (2 dozen). To be sure, she did have the small square of white wax paper nestled in the palm of her hand, but she used all five fingers to grip and handle the donuts! Then after taking payment, she went right to the next patrons order without washing her hands. After such a long trek to get to this highly reviewed donut shop, we had to try them...grossness aside. \n\nSo yes, if we got sick or anything started growing from our tongue it would have been completely our own fault at that point. LOL.\n\nThe donuts were meh and greasy. I've definitely had better, but my favorite spot is all the way in Pinole at A La Mode donut shop :-( . I would still say its worth maybe trying this spot IF they would reassign the little old lady (is she the owner? Maybe she should stick to the books), and reassess their grease. I'm sure that on a good day she can be very charming and not annoyed and frazzled by every customer with a large order, and I'm sure she usually washes her hands before handling food with her bare fingers, but she wasnt and she didnt that day, hence my review. \n\nOn the positive note, the young girl donut maker looked like she really knew what she was doing!", "author": "Veteran m."}

Minus $9 but plus immeasurable happiness. I actually didn't expect the donut to be amazing since there was a possibility that the size factor could render it gimmicky more than anything, but rest assured that it is quality. The outside was gently crusty while the inside doughy, with the only sweetness coming from the chocolate topping so a good balance of fried bread flavor and sugar.

And I blame my bestie, who was going through a phase where she had to have bourbon sours everywhere we went.\n\nRemember that scene in The Seven Year Itch when Marilyn Monroe realizes that potato chips go great w champagne?  It was just like that, except w Bob's Donuts & bourbon.  \n\nThe city's peppered w several other old & divey small donut joints for sure, but Bob's is the creme de la creme.  \n\nThis is not Dynamo.

It doesn't have that greasy oil taste like some donuts do at other places. The coffee wasn't great but it was cheap.

The people there were kind enough to assist you with every need; however, it would be nice if they could smile or show they are welcoming a bit more.

I recommend getting whatever they are cooking fresh that day/ night!

My sister got 6 glaze, 6 sugar for $18. We were confused about the difference since I asked for customized purchase.) Adding on, the staff (specifically the older Asian woman) was not polite. I get it...people have long days...but she knew this already working at a popular shop. (She huffed and puffed when I had misheard her and she had to do the extra work of putting donuts back.)

One of the women asked me if I was okay, and I sobbed through the whole story of my break up with a crumb donut in my mouth. That was a low point a few years ago. But I will never forget the kindness of the employees. This place is comfort to me.. I mean how can you not feel comforted by a bunch of warm donuts, staring at you saying \"eat me and you'll feel better\"?! I usually get whatever is warm (which if you haven't tried yet, you need to head down there asap and try it). No judgement if you also emotionally eat. No shame people! Listen if you've had a break up, lost your job, or needing a way to deal with the lack of gun control laws in this country, or the President and his daily disappointment: Bob's donut is the place. They don't judge they really don't. So if you show up to Bob's please be in a non judgmental state towards yourself. Treat yourself. Eat the big donut just for fun. Don't feel guilty about your trip here. That will be the only thing ruining your experience. So leave that guilt, calorie counting BS at the door. Nothing about these babies are healthy and that's why they are so fucking glorious. \nPlease also be aware that there is an elderly woman that works there. Be nice to her, and don't get aggravated if it takes a while for a dozen donuts. Be grateful that you have the luxury of buying some donuts from Bob's. Seriously though, this place is cozy, and glazed with super cool art from locals on the back wall. If you're feeling adventurous, they also have a donut challenge. You must eat the big donut in less than 3 minutes. You'll get your name on top of a list of all the other glorified donut eating champs.\nIf you haven't been here as a local, shame on you. And if you're visiting, definitely stop by. The donuts are cheap, fresh, and done the traditional way. No over the top icing designs on these babies.

The lady working at the counter was nice and helpful as she patiently suggested I try their most popular item - the apple fritter, which she spoke highly of, saying it was \"the best in the world\".  I also ordered a plain glazed donut and a chocolate glazed.  \n\nThere was a guy hacking loogies in the place, so I decided to get the goods to go.  I was staying only a few blocks away, but by the time I got back to the hotel the grease from the donuts had seeped through the bag, rendering it completely translucent.  It didn't bother me too much though, because if I wanted to be healthy that day I would have had a protein smoothie, not a fried pastry.  Anyhow, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into those babies so I took a bite of each one successively.  And honestly, I couldn't really tell any of the three donuts apart from each other.  They all tasted the same and were greasy to the point that I could feel the oil gushing out of the dough as I chewed.  The texture was crumbly and dry which is rare for yeast based donuts (unless they're stale and old). But I think I was most disappointed in the apple fritter as I couldn't find any trace of apples in it and especially after the woman raved about it.\n\nI'm willing to give Bob's another chance, say, if someone brought them in and/or they were free, because my friend says the crumb donut was amazing (perhaps it's cake based?) but I won't be going out of my way for these anytime soon.", "author": "Virginia T."}

Two minutes gets you a refund, (the donut is 8$) a t-shirt, and your picture on the wall of fame; Three gets you the t-shirt and the picture. I personally had the maple doughnut. Needless to say, I finished only half in the three minutes. \n\nNormally, after scarfing something so dense that fast, you'd except to be kinda sick of it; however, after the three minutes, I kept on eating.

It's a great place for a binge snack, but that's about it.  I'm sure the donut's taste a lot better straight off the baking sheet ... and since there is a line at 2am.. the best time to get fresh donuts at this place is from 12am - 2am... just FYI.\n\nI was craving a donut yesterday around 4pm...  I've commonly walked past this place at late night and the line has been out the door 10 deep.  It's right in the heart of Polk street, between all the bars, so it makes sense that it's a one stop shop for all your late night eating needs. The two donuts I got were:\n\n- Raised Maple donut with sprinkles on top\n- Maple glazed French Cruller.\n\nI'm not sure how long the donuts had been sitting, but they didn't look fresh.  They were smaller in size than I expected, but that didn't really bother me.  Each donut was $.95 cents I believe, which was actually more than I suspected.  IMO, they are worth about $.60/per, but that's neither here nor there.  \n\nThe first donut I tried was the Raised Maple... it was really soft, and extremely sweet.  Not your \"ok this is sweet\", but \"damn! this is nothing but sugar!\"  About three bites in to it I realized why people like them so much.  There is a ton of sugar packed in to these small things, which will make you sick if you have too many.  By the time I finished the first donut, I was ready to run a marathon.  I bit in to the french cruller and could only eat half of it before I had to throw it away.  \n\nThe place was ok, but not the best I've ever had.

I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with this donut shop. There is definitely a good variety of flavours and donut options. To be honest though, through the window, I could not really choose one that was appetizing. They did not look fresh and they seem to look dry. \nI asked one of their staff, what their popular items were. She listed a few but suggested I go for the freshly made ones that were in a cart behind her. She indicated that the fresh ones were either the old fashion glaze or the old fashion chocolate glaze. I opted for the simple glazed one to share with my fianc\u00e9e. If this one was good, I would not mind going for seconds or thirds lol...unfortunately this \"fresh\" donut didn't do its magic. It was dry... I expected it to be a bit cakey and fluffy since it is an old fashion donut but it was crumbly and not as enjoyable as I hoped for. It was also really sweet and I honestly didn't think the donut was fresh...\nI really want to give this place another chance due to the raving reviews. \n\nMaybe waiting in line for an actual fresh batch will do the trick :P next time perhaps!", "author": "Daphne W."}

Old-fashioned chocolate and the maple bars filled with custard are amazing too! \n\nIf you're here for the first time, be sure to scope out the donuts in the front window before getting in line.

However, the wait goes pretty quickly. \n\nBob's is open 24/7, the service is friendly, and the prices are crazy affordable. You can pretty much get anything you want without feeling guilty about how much you're spending. How you feel after you finish eating 5 donuts is another story though.

Sure, often times it's drunk people after 9pm, but even drunk people deserve awesome donuts!\n\nIf I was honestly checking in every time I stopped in here, I'd be the reigning Duchesses supreme. So there, my dirty secret is out, go ahead and judge. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bob's donuts. I do have some ground rules though, for starters I can only get one if I've walked there, because the .8 mile round trip from my apartment TOTALLY burns off the calories, right??\n\nGreat thing is they are making the donuts fresh around the clock. So you're never getting anything stale. My favorite donut used to be the chocolate bar, but I haven't found any like the ones I used to get in SoCal. Bob's has broadened my horizons, yet thankfully not my waist line. The crumb donuts are truly the BEST. I have a preference for the raised crumb donuts, but the cake crumb are a close second. I'm also a big fan of these amaaaaazing cinnamon roll raised donuts. So I don't completely hate myself, I cut that one in half and eat the second piece the next day. \n\nEveryone who works here is very friendly. You'll usually find the nice older lady working in the afternoon/evenings.

Someone mentioned they wanted to stop by and I figured a donut could be tasty. Let me tell you... it wasn't just tasty. IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DONUTS EVER. Look, this is not some fancy donut shop with bells and whistles. They seem to put all of their effort into concocting the most tasty donuts this side of the Mississippi. \n\nMy friends and I walked into this small unassuming shop on a Thursday evening. We had just been talking about whether or not they would have the selection or quality we desired as it was later in the day. I asked if they had any maple donuts as I didn't see any in the display case. The guy at the front (who was very friendly) said he did and pulled one out of the \"freshly made\" tray. It wasn't hot out of the oven... but it had that lingering warmth that told me, it was fresh. I paid my $1.25 for my donut and sat waiting for my friends to join me at the counter. \n\nNow before I tell you about the experience I had ingesting that donut, let me tell you what I look for in a donut. It's actually really simple: 1. It needs to be fluffy and 2. It needs to be sweet but not hurt my teeth when I bite into it. \n\nBOB, you have nailed it on the head. The first bite into that perfect morsel was such an experience I inhaled the rest. INHALED. I promptly got up and purchased another one. It was so freaking delicious. It's probably a good thing I don't live in San Francisco or I would be a lot squishier than I am now. \n\nIf you are looking for a donut shop that will give you the most delicious classic donut experience... go to Bob's.

This is considered as a local community staple for the locals and any visitors who can appreciate its raunchy vibe that makes it unique. If not, you can go to one of those upscale homogeneous emulated version of Bob's Donut where you love to throw $5 dollars for a coin size donut and hang (socialize) with your friends over conversations with no substances and pretend to be open minded when you really aren't! If you feel happier sipping on $7 dollar organic coffee and believing that the label fair-trade is good for the community because you are a supposedly community conscious. Fuck you dude! Giving the farmers $1 dollar extra for a ton of coffee is basically like saying for every $30 dollar breast cancer shirt you buy the company will donate .01 cent to the cause or for every $1000 of Nike shoes you purchased... .25 cent will go towards building a community.

We came in the middle of the day, probably around 2pm when there were a few people around the shop. In the window I could see a not too wide assortment of donuts, but they had what I wanted to try all the same. Inside, it was pretty dingy - didn't feel the most comfortable ordering from this place. But hey, health score reportedly fantastic so, what the hell.\n\nI got an apple fritter, which may or may not be a donut depending on who you ask but personally tells a lot about this donut shop. Terrible. I really hope that the particular fritter I received was way out of the ordinary. The glaze was way too sugary (I get it - it's glaze so sugar is expected, but there's a point when it becomes too much) without a cinnamon flavor, and somehow (maybe it was fried for too long?) the inside was soaked in oil. I took one bite and it was truly one of the most unappetizing donuts I could imagine.\n\nI also got a plain glazed, which was nothing out of the ordinary really. It wasn't cloud-like in softness or delicately sweetened, nope just your average glazed donut.\n\nI judge a donut shop on the simple things.

By nature, donuts are guiltfully delicious for the most part, but these Apple Fritters are freaking amazing!\n\nIn nearly every way, the APPLE FRITTER exceeded my expectations.  Despite its larger than expected size, the donut wasn't doughy at all.  The outside had a terrifically crispy crust and the inside was moist and soft.  More importantly, the taste was spot on - just the right amount of sweetness and apple flavor.  Too bad (for me) there was only one donut for all of us to share!\n\nAs much as I loved the fritter though, the other donuts we tried didn't make as much of an impression.  To be honest, the FRENCH CRULLERS (Frosted and Chocolate) and the BUTTERMILK DONUTS (Frosted and Chocolate) didn't seem all that different from what you can get at any other donut shop.  The French Crullers were light, airy, and a bit creamy, but the frosted one in particular wasn't all that flavorful to me.  Both buttermilk donuts were better and pretty solid overall, but it's important to note they're heavier than regular donuts (hellooo buttermilk!) so be prepared.\n\nDespite the fact that they're open 24/7, you shouldn't be surprised to come across a line no matter what time you go.  Yes, they're that popular (1300+ reviews...for a DONUT SHOP!).  And be sure to keep an eye out for their jumbo donuts too!

If you like your donuts fluffy and not too sweet, seriously, go for the raised glazed donut. It's a classic that just won't die for a reason. Cinnamon rolls: bomb. Chocolate donuts: delicious.

So I paid (2.35-- 1.35 plus 1 for refill)or a small when I never even drank the amount of the whole cup. Seems petty on my end right? Well it seemed petty to me as well to charge a customer that didn't even fill up the halfway the first time around. \n\nBottom line? Donuts are decent. Not the cleanest place.

So while I was waiting, I looked up the reviews on Yelp for what was good. Apparently they are really famous for their apple fritters! Anyway, all of a sudden a bunch of people from the clubs just rushed behind me and I was pretty much surrounded by drunk people who were very loud and eager for some donuts. \n\nAfter about a half hour wait (it's kind of like Porto's where they take your order and gather up your donuts and ring you up before going to the next customer), we were finally at the front of the line! There were way too many options. We got a bunch of random donuts like a custard/blueberry danish, glazed donut, sugar donut, the freshly baked apple fritter, maple donut, donut holes, a chocolate donut with custard filling - the total came out to be around $8 which wasn't bad. \n\nSo was the apple fritter as good as Bob's Donut proclaims? I would say yes, but only if you eat it fresh! It's very sweet and cinnamon-y with lots of flavor. It was pretty big, and I couldn't finish it until the next day and then it wasn't very good. Donut holes were all right. The custard danish was good. The maple donut was pretty good, too according to my boyfriend. We had a lot left over that we couldn't finish and the custard filling donut got bad so I had to throw that out. \n\nOverall, a very nice hole-in-the-wall place with friendly servers and donut-makers! There are people who just sit at the tables, waiting for fresh apple fritters. Everything looked really good, but there were just too many different options that it was really overwhelming, esp. with the line behind us. They take card too! \n\nMust try if you love donuts!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

She makes a mean donut. She was very polite and very friendly and extremely talkative, all rarities for little Asian women in the food service industry (at least from most of my experiences living in New York).\n\nThe place itself is as bare bones and ghetto/depressing looking as possible, but I think that contributes a lot to its charm. No music, no decorations, no frills, no nothing (except for the abundance of signage and newspaper clippings showing off how good and renowned the place is). It feels like an old school coffee/donut shop, and it's fun to eat at the counter and chat with the aforementioned friendly woman.\n\nWe got the much hyped about apple fritter (7x7 list), and now I definitely believe the hype. My wife loves her donuts, and she said it was one of the best fried things she's ever eaten, and I would have to agree with her. It was slightly warm, and delicious in every possible way. We also got a classic chocolate donut with rainbow sprinkles, which was also awesome.\n\nI regret that I just had a massive burger and fried chicken and macaroni and cheese for dinner; otherwise I would have done the big donut challenge. Even those massive donuts looked delicious. If I'm ever back in San Francisco, I'm gonna make sure to hit up Bob's earlier in the day to make sure I have more room to waste myself on a lot of that fried goodness.", "author": "Mike C."}

Measuring Bob's against some of my favorite NY donut spots (what up Doughnut Plant and Dough!) just isn't fair - they after all are 2-3x the price and are a totally different species of doughnut. But w/r/t a basic no frills doughnut, I'm not sure if I'd choose Bob's over a Dunkin Donuts or even certain supermarket doughnuts. And I certainly wouldn't wait 20 minutes (during off-peak hours at that!) for a Bob's. \n\nMy issues with the doughnuts here: unless you get a piping hot fresh out of the fryer doughnut- which btw is generally almost impossible to screw up so I wouldn't consider that as evidence of a good doughnut- I found Bob's cake doughnut to in fact be a blob of greasy, cold, hard and somewhat stale dough. Maybe we made a poor choice by choosing a variety that had been sitting by the front window for god knows how long (although there was no way of knowing they'd give us one of those doughnuts until it was too late)-- but they shouldn't be serving those if they're no longer any good. Even if donuts are only 90 cents a pop! The yeasty doughnut, which was served from one of the rolling trays (and not from the pile by the front window), was somewhat better. Softer and fresher for sure, but still packed with a greasy sugary punch. I guess it's convenient having a place like this open 24/7- especially after a night out. But Bob's is definitely another prime example of how Bay Area Yelp reviews (4.5 average???) confound me.", "author": "Jen H."}

After all, Bob's, from what I understand, is a SF institution. So, before we left the city to make our 1-hour-long excursion up to Napa, we made a pit stop for some of Bob's famous, sweet delights.\n\nAs you approach the storefront on Polk, the intoxicating aroma of fried, sugary goodness overwhelms the olfactory system, propelling it into a crazed overdrive. That distinct donut smell, the donut smell that is ingrained into the walls of the building due to years of incessant frying and glazing, animated me to action, and I had an extra spring in my step as we neared the doorway. Indeed, I was a happy boy.\n\nNo visit to Bob's would be complete without the infamous Apple Fritter and a cup of coffee. I believe my travel companion opted for one of the attractive danishes that was being showcased. The Apple Fritter was fresh, crispy, and embodied everything an Apple Fritter should be. I recall that the danish, too, was quite tasty, although I was somewhat disenchanted that my companion didn't buy a donut, instead. After all, we were at a donut shop. Nevertheless, I try, as hard as it may be, to keep in mind that he doesn't get the same type of thrills over sugar as I do, just as I don't share his obsessive passion for grease-laden potatoes, eggrolls and any other items that can conceivably be thrown into a frying vat.  But I digress...  \n\nThe interior of Bob's is very homey. It's certainly one of those neighborhood familiarities that everyone knows about and can identify with in some sort of fashion. I absolutely love the mom-and-pop feel. If I was a local, I fear Bob's would certainly be one of my regular haunts. Luckily, geography is on the side of my waistline.", "author": "Gary R."}

Although we are pretty stuffed full by the time we hit up Bob's Donut, we always somehow have room to squeeze in a few donuts.  Anything fresh is super awesome. We have tried ones that were not hot, and those were okay to good; however, the nice, hot, and fresh ones were the best. We have had the glazed donut and old fashion donut fresh. They were making the giant donut while we were there, but we did not have time to stay and wait for it that time. My fianc\u00e9 will not let me forget that we could have had that huge donut. He reminds me about it every time we talk about donuts or pastries, so we are definitely coming back. Hopefully they will have that giant donut ready for us next time.", "author": "May N."}

My boyfriend makes me drive there at 2AM to get the fresh batch of donuts after he comes back from drinking & 2. I always end up breaking my diet to eat these delectable dounuts! Okay, I guess that's not Bob's fault for my hate relationship with them. They can't help the fact that their donuts are just so damn delectable! \n\nLike I stated, my boyfriend and I usually come around 2AM when the raised donuts are fresh out of the fryer. Although there are times the line is 3 stores down because the night clubs are all closing at the time, I don't mind the wait because the freshness is worth it! \n\nThe (I think) owner is amazing. She's super nice and even when she's totally slammed she's very attentive to everyone's needs! =)\n\nTop favs:\n1.

Yes, go for another!\n\nLast up, crumble cake. 4 for 4, tastes great yet again.\n\nEating donuts here makes donuts from every other donut places taste stale in comparison.

It is a generous way to complete my evening especially after clubbing.  Getting all that sweets and that carbohydrates along with that coffee -- prevents that nasty hangover when I wake up!!  Get the picture?\n\nThe best time to come here is around 3:00 AM especially on Friday's and Saturday's.  Otherwise, anytime between 11:00 PM to 2:30 AM I guarantee you will be waiting in line for awhile.  Why -their fresh batch of doughnut holes and the rest of their pastries usually cooked at that time.  So everything is hot and fresh!!   \n\nI usually buy their GLAZE DOUGHNUTS and it is always warm and fresh.  I also highly recommend getting their FRENCH DOUGHNUTS HOLES .....and I leave the best for last -- try BOB'S ALMOND RAISIN PASTRY.  It is out of this world!  The dough is so fresh, the almonds and the raisin are so crunchy and moist - you will absolutely be back for more.  I guarantee it!  \n\nThe owner is so nice too - I keep forgetting her name -but every time I come back -- usually around 4:00 AM - she remembers everything about me.

It made the gut-turning ride to get there totally worth it, even though our taxi driver had a major death wish (re: rain+roads=slippery driving conditions, especially downhill=slow down).\n\nBut yeah this place is a total dive straight out of a '70s detective flick -- the type of flick you forget the name of but you only ever catch a few minutes of it a time while flipping channels and then you try to look it up on Netflix but realize it's too awful to even stream, well, anywhere but that one TV channel that only shows really bad movies. \n\nAnd you're OK with this, especially when you add in the layers of grit and the grime and the giant $6 donuts the size of your head. It all reminds you of that one classic donut shop back home that somehow survives to this day despite the Krispy Kreams and the Dunkin Donuts popping up all over. And the fact that, here at Bob's, you'll run into cool kids from across the globe who are eating said head-sized donuts is a novelty all its own.

Donuts are always wonderful, but they are even more wonderful when you can buy an ENORMOUS donut for $8. I got that instead of a cake for my best friend who loves donuts, and needless to say, it was perfect. The owner is one of the sweetest people. I also do not think she is the Bob of Bob's Donuts, but who knows? All I know is that this place makes a damn good donut. You can also call their number and you get a list of automated messages that will tell you EXACTLY when they start making the fresh donuts. Yes! A donut schedule! How beautiful is that?!\n\nThey don't have a special \"dozen\", so each item is purchased a la carte. For the pillowy clouds of fresh-made deliciousness you get, that is totally fine. Taking these donuts into work netted me loads of thanks, hugs, and general statements of how awesome I was. Basically, if you need a boost of self-esteem, buy your office a round of Bob's. Chances are most of your office mates will thank you, cut many of them into silly small pieces due to some diet, and you will still have plenty of donut leftover. If that's not a win, I don't know what is.\n\nMaple is my favorite, but I am biased because maple donuts are the best. The owner agrees with me. I'm probably never going to stop by at 2am for a donut because I hear the lines are astronomical. I stopped by at 830am and there was no line, but many of the donuts were also out.

I ended up with a crazy doughnut craving one night, and a native lead a group of us to Bob's.  We trekked a little over a mile through the Tenderloin and got there around 11:30 PM, and our guide knew the entire staff.  So they happily showed us what was fresh.  The doughnuts were around $1 a piece.\n\nI had a glazed cake doughnut and an apple fritter.  The glazed doughnut was straight out of the fryer, and it was amazing.  The inside was perfect.  I can't even describe the amazing factor.  The apple fritter was good but slightly over cooked.  It was not freshly made, though.  I bet a fresh one would be amazing!\n\nHonestly, just go in and get what is coming out of the fryer.  The fresh doughnuts were out of this world.\n\nThe staff was really nice and very cool.

The apple fritter, how from the fryer was crispy on the outside, but I was surprised that there wasn't much apple in it. This made it less sweet which I am not complaining about. We also had a crumb donut, which was just okay nothing really unique. I also ordered a cheese danish that I had for breakfast and that was pretty good. I like that the filling was also not overwhelmingly sweet nor a large amount. The breading itself was good and also had some sort of glaze on top that I liked.\n\nOverall this shop had some good stuff and also very nice service.

My friend has told me about the huge donuts here before and raves about them all the time so for surprise gift, I decided to get him one. I came here around 3 and it looked a little run down and a hole-in-the-wall type of shop but I already expected that from the yelp reviews. So I got the two donuts, and the total came up to $17. Kinda pricey for donuts but I thought \"hey they must be THAT good\", by the way they didn't even have a menu so I wasn't expecting it to be that much. I got the chocolate glazed one and the maple glazed. When I got home, I tried the maple glazed and it tasted just like a regular donut, but it wasn't even fluffy/puffy. It was kind of hard and bland, especially the parts with no maple, aka the bottom of the donut. I was expecting more from this place but I'm pretty disapointed, I feel like the only reason this place is famous is because they are the only shop to carry the huge donuts but if Krispy Kreme were to start selling those, I would much rather buy it from there.

That's when you know they're fresh. I asked for an apple turnover, but the guy behind the counter was like, \"if you really want something apple, you gotta get an apple fritter. We just fried them.\" Well, you sold me on that one.\n\nAs we sat at the bar with our donuts, coffee, and cartons of milk in hand, we watched one of the guys from the back come out, took a BOX full of LARD and dump scoops upon scoops into the fryer.

I couldn't resist INHALING them.\n\nAnyhoo, I had the Groupon deal of $12 for a dozen delicious donuts AND a custom t-shirt. Who can say no to that!? A note for those with the Groupon (which you can still buy): \"Must use promotional value in 1 visit. Valid for raised donuts, old fashioned donuts or crullers (chocolate, maple, glazed), or cake donuts (chocolate, powdered sugar, cinnamon, maple, crumb). May substitute larger and/or filled donuts at a reduced quantity.\" Essentially, you can fill that pink box with circular, unfilled donuts.\n\nMy favorite was the FRENCH CRULLER, which I've never had prior to the ones at Bob's. It's a fried, ring-shaped choux pastry that lends to a very light and airy donut. I first chose glazed, which looks more like crumbled sugar and totes tastes like a churro--soooooo good. The chocolate cruller was almost as good, except the chocolate sauce they use is distinctly artificial tasting. Slightly ruined it :/\n\nI also grabbed a few RAISED DONUTS made with yeast, which yields your typically large and fluffy donuts. The dough was airy and stretchy, and glazed is always my favorite. Maple tends to be too sweet, and it's no exception here.\n\nThey also have chewy CAKE DONUTS, which results from a cake-like batter made with baking powder or soda. It's denser and crumblier, and the CINNAMON (with a hint of nutmeg) has a kick to it.\n\nPlaying off the cake donuts are the OLD-FASHIONED DONUTS with their iconic ring-around-the-ring crust. They're dense and crunchy--not my favorite (I like 'em fluffeh), but still good.\n\nGET THE GLAZED FRENCH CRULLER. Be wary of the artificial chocolate and the overpowering maple glazes. And watch out for me at the gym sporting my new Bob's branded donut t-shirt.\n\nDONUT MESS WITH ME.", "author": "Adele F."}

The draw was their apple fritters and chocolate glazed donuts the size of a dinner plate! (Only $5.50)  We were lucky to hit them up while a fresh batch had just come out of the oven.  Fritters were awesome, also got some cake like donut with bread pudding with apple stuff layered, chocolate eclairs and then contemplated the plate sized donut.

My friends and I ordered a variety of donuts that we shared with each other, and my opinion for each individual type of donut varies.  So here goes:\n\nApple Fritter: 5 stars.  An apple fritter isn't something that I'd typically order since I'm not a fan of the fruitty baked goods variety, but this was awesome.  Hot, crispy, fresh, and surprisingly cheap for its quality.  There's a reason this was branded one of the \"Things To Eat In SF Before You Die\".  Check.  Or, well, partial check... cuz I just had a piece of my friend's\n\nCrumb Donut: 4 stars.  I think at Bob's, the smaller, more dense/sweet donuts are better than the bigger, more light-doughish ones, and this is one of the former.  \n\nChocolate Ecclair: 2.25 stars.  Something about this donut that just wasn't right.   So, this is one of the bigger donuts I spoke of above, and, while the inner non-custard portion of the donut is fine, the outer shell of the donut threw it off.  For such a decadent donut, the unfrosted outside of it was dry and \"blah\", kind of felt like I was eating a generally okay donut that was coated by bread crust.  The custard filling was this light white stuff that's different from the thick, yellow-whitish good stuff that's usually inside.  And while this is more of a shallow point, the ecclair was cut in half, versus intact and injected with custard, making it kind of sloppier to eat.", "author": "Frances L."}

It happened over the course of time, I swear!)\n\nUnfortunately, because of my  \"diet\" (aka the diet that I never started but is always in the back of my mind that I should) I have to resist and limit myself to these confections.

They're not re-inventing the wheel, its just donuts. Comparable to most other cheap donut spots. \n\nOf course their donuts are good...they're donuts! They still use the same flour, same glaze, same chocolate, maple etc. The same usual suspects like raised, old fashioneds, holes, twists, etc., as other places. \n\nBecause of the volume they sell, they make fresh donuts at higher frequency maybe so you probably have had FRESHER donuts here than other places. Like most fried things the sooner it was cooked, the better it is. The apple fritter isn't made better than anywhere else. It probably was just fresher.\n\nI used to go here often. My diet has changed so I don't frequent it as much and I'm not on Polk street late-night because Im not a douchebag. The lady that would be there on my visits was very nice and always remembered me. I got great donuts because I didn't just pick my favorites, I asked which were the freshest. So I got to try a variety over the years and the freshness made it great. I've had the not-so-fresh versions and they are as average as  most other donuts you've had.\n\nDon't expect a life-changing donut like some of these reviews are saying. Expect a fresh donut...which of course still is a great experience.", "author": "Monsieur_Meursault _."}

Fresh, golden, and deliciously dripping in a glaze or icing of your choice that just won't stop running because of the hot pastry goodness beneath it is a sight to behold! At Bob's you've got two chances to witness this, 9:30 and midnight, but what I really want to see is when they make their GIANT DONUTS! These babies are bigger than a hubcap and must weigh a ton! On my recent visit I walked in to find a skinny young guy trying to make his way through this mammoth monstrosity... ON HIS OWN! It was larger than his head and required two hands and every bit of arm strength he had to hold it up. Bob's has a challenge surrounding this legendary creation, but based on the sign on the wall, not too many brave souls had succeeded. I was impressed by this guy's determination, so I captured it in a photo you can find on the Yelp page, but one look at it and I knew there was no way I could take it on! \n\nI settled on one of the glazed cake donuts that had just come from the fryer. It was warm, crunchy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside, just the way a good cake donut should be. The glaze gifted this donut with the sweetness that satisfies only the most ferocious sweet tooth. For me, it was too sweet, and after just a few bites, I handed it off to a friend to be finished.\n\nThis place is a local legend, and I had hoped to learn about it from the very staff that takes the time to make Bob's Donuts daily. So with a sugar high like no other, I asked the guy behind the counter \"Who's Bob?\". The reply, \"No one\". Well he must've been someone, so I prodded on trying to get the story of Bob. All I could get was that he was a guy who opened this shop in the 1940's. This was a very sad version of what I'm sure is a colorful tale about a very caring and passionate individual.

Showing up in the afternoon to a little joint reminiscent of a 60s (or is it 80s?) coffee shop, my options were already a little limited (I didn't see any raised chocolates left), but I ended up nabbing an apple fritter and a crumb doughnut.\n\nImpressions? Good, but not mind-blowing (Pro Tip: toss the doughnuts into a toaster oven for a few minutes at 200F, including the preheating phase). The crumb doughnut was easily the star of the two, for both flavor and texture (crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside), while the apple fritter was a bit too dry and doughy. I do like the fact that both of these doughnuts, especially the fritter, were not as overly sweet as many a doughnut shop will make them, but I did feel like the fritter was a bit lacking in flavor (not sugar mind you, but flavor).\n\nTotal came out to $2.60, cash only, though I don't know the breakdown of the prices - which, I hear, supposedly fluctuate depending on who's working the register.

When the boss is there she is charming and respectful otherwise she is a shrew and a half to deal with.\n\nSonia has been at Bob's for something approaching 30 years and has turned into a sourpuss over it.

Still this is no excuse for hassling her customers.  \n\nI recently met several long time locals at other places on Polk Street and asked them why they were not at Bob's?

At 1:30am on weekend night, we were amazed to see a line out the door- one that took us 30 minutes to finally order. The apple fritter was surprisingly on the dense side (think store bought Entenmann's) with just a few pieces of apple bits and didn't taste particularly fresh. We also had a jam+custard danish that also was average. Perhaps we should have gone with the donuts? (They were certainly being freshly made). Overall, a disappointing venture for baked goods although at least it was cheap (only $3.50 for both our items)!", "author": "Amy D."}

I of course wanted it to be something special and something that I love and then realized that I haven't written a review on Bob's Donuts!\n\nI could basically live here...actually I may have. The donuts here are so simple yet that's what makes them so special.  If you're really special, maybe someone will get you a giant donut...which could be the next best thing, unless its paired with Bi-RIte ice cream...now that would be truly amazing.\n\nThe standouts here are the original glazed donut, the crumb donut and the apple fritters.  You can't go wrong with any of them and you should probably get 4 each because donuts are meant to come in a dozen.  Grab some chocolate milk...obviously for protein and you got yourself a complete meal.\n\nIf you are in love with donuts, then you absolutely must stop by here.

SOLD!!\nCame by this place after stuffing ourselves at Craw Station. \nI've never seen a donut shop with their display right in front of you on the sidewalk in the glass case flaunting all their choices. It definitely lures you in. If I were just walking by the shop, I would most likely go in and grab me a few just because of their huge display. \n\nI can see how parking can be difficult because it's all street parking, but we were lucky to get a spot almost right in front on a Thursday night around 11:30. \nThere were already a few customers when we got there, and most of the seats were taken, so we took the donuts up to Twin Peaks and ate them there.\n\nWhen we got to the cash register, it was kind of hard to order if you don't already know what you want and what the donuts are, because there's no labels on any of them.. I'm not huge donut person, so I felt like a noob when I couldn't tell which donuts were which...and the difference between a raised donut or a caked donut? or something like that.. I didn't want to bother the cashier by asking her which is which, so I ended up getting an apple fritter and my friends got some chocolate one, a cinnamon bun, a powdered one, and 2 others that I can't remember.\n\nBut my apple fritter was SO GOOD!!! It's probably my go-to donut when I can't decide what else to get. The dough was so fresh and soft and fluffy, but the outside was still kinda crisp from the frying and the cooled glaze. ahhhh just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water! I don't know how often they make their donuts, but mine was definitely not more than an hour old I think. Old donuts seem to have that stale-ish inside where you can tell that the bread has been sitting there for a while cause its stiffer towards the center. These were so soft throughout the entire donut. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I come back to SF in the future!", "author": "Kimmy U."}

GrRrrrRrrRrawh~  Anyways, friends and I went to Bob's for late night (about 11:45 PM maybe) and the store was widely empty with a few customers probably because it was on a week day (night).  We ordered a \"Giant Glazed Donut\" to share.  Yes, a Giant! It  was really big (8\" diameter) and seriously the biggest donut that i had ever seen in real life!  Cute!!  We cut it up into 8-10 slices and everyone took a slice!  The friends said it was good but both my boyfriend and I thought it was bland, and cold, and no more than JUST A-OKAY!  It would have been a lot better if it was served fresh and hot (or at least warm!) and glazed more generously!  I like donuts and pastries with lots of glazing/ frosting or whatever that makes life sweeter!!\n\nWe saw some donut cakes coming out fresh from the fryer so we bought three of 'em to share among the five of us.  YESH! Those were very good and delicious because they were fresh and hot and sweet!\n\nFYI:  \n1) Cash only\n2) Open 24 hours a day, which is really cool!! \n3) No decaffeinated coffee (while i was there) so you better watch out and get a carton of milk or a bottle of fruit juice if you are going in for late night but looking forward to going to bed afterward.... \n\nSince Bob's Donuts' been around for so many years, everything inside this super duper uber old-school shop feels like Antique!

Laced in processed layers of sugar, infused with globs of fat, and so uncomfortably dry and mushy at the same time that it leaves the most unpleasant feeling in your mouth. Bob's enlightened me to a new world of possibilities where a donut can actually taste amazing.\n\nIf you come on a Saturday night, prepare to wait in line. Along with burritos, donuts are some of the most sought after drunchies. If Bob's opens a location in the Mission, that combination is very well possible. \n\n- Raspberry Jelly Filled Donut: I grew up eating sufganiyot, the Jewish version of a jelly donut. Bob's is hands down the best I have ever had. The dough is so delicately fluffy and mild. The jelly just oozes out in perfection. It's not too sweet and is the ultimate combination of rich raspberry flavor and blissfully fried dough.\n\n- LARGE DONUT: To this day, I still can't fathom how they pull off making these. Who would be crazy enough to buy one? Apparently we were, to the point where we ended up getting two. The dough is cloud-like, gently melting in your mouth. The hype of M&Ms or 50 Cent melting in your mouth doesn't even come close (no homo). The flavor is all in the topping, which blends wonderfully with the rest of the donut. \n\nMy friend who initiated the excursion here ended up leaving the 2nd donut at our afterparty spot. The next morning, her first text wasn't \"Hey are you hungover?\" or \"Hope you got home safe.\" It was \"Where is my donut? -___-\" That just proves what kind of addiction Bob's can trigger. \n\nThe comparison to your average Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme is simply heaven and Earth.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

I am not a huge donut fan but I must admit that the donuts are excellent and usually extremely fresh.  At my friends prompting, we ordered the large glazed donut with chocolate frosting.  When I say large, I mean about the size of a tire on a Smart Car (ok, a little smaller but definitely big enough to serve four people or more).  I thought the novelty of the big donut would be just that, but it was delicious.  Service was friendly and I thought the donut was very reasonable priced.

We also added a small milk to balance it all out.\n\nWhile most people seemed to take theirs to go, we decided to sit up at the bar while we enjoyed our sugar coated eats. MAN were they good. The glazed twist was comparable to a Krispy Kreme glazed (my #1 in the donut world). My apple fritter did not disappoint in the least. Both were delicious and I will definitely add this to the list of go-to places when I have people in town. \n\nIf you have the time, I would recommend eating your donut at the bar, just to have the full experience and see all of the little gems that make this place such a classic.", "author": "Emily S."}

We thought Bob's would hit the spot: delicious and cheap donuts, how can you go wrong? Bob's highly exceeded our expectations -- we tried 5 different of their donuts and \"wow\" is all I have to say. Between the 5 of us, we got the following flavors: apple fritter, chocolate custard, caramel, original glazed, and a regular chocolate one. All of the are warm, fluffy, filled with probably 1000 calories each, and so delicious you won't know what to do with yourself. \n\nIt all comes down to personal preference when deciding which one is your favorite. I'm a big chocolate person, and I think overall, my favorite one was the chocolate donut (chocolate frosting on top), with custard stuffed inside of it. It was sooo chewy and creamy and had the *perfect* balance of everything in it. Not too much chocolate or custard. One of my friends loved the caramel one (this was probably my 2nd favorite) because it was simple and just hit the spot. The other three loved the apple fritter one the most, the donut that Bob's is famous for. It's super delicious and if you see them making it, you'll see them pour a tonnnn of milk over the donuts which probably infuses tons more calories but lots more goodness. The apple fritter one is super different and unique and unlike other donuts I've had, but I'm just a chocolate sucker at the end of the day.\n\nYou should totally come here after a meal or in the morning - or just whenever they're making fresh batches of them. Bob's is NOT to be missed! I'm glad I only tried it now though - if I had tried it when I actually lived nearby, I would have probably gone everyday and would be 15 pounds heavier right now. :)", "author": "Priya G."}

Very soft and light, and I swear the jelly actually had some sort of cherry flavour instead of just being sweet and coloured red.\n\nOverall, I liked the donuts, and they're not too expensive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-01", "description": "I promise you, this is a story about Bob's Donuts.  Kinda.\n\nSo, taking the bar in California is pretty messed up.\n\n(1) You study for months, more often than not paying thousands of dollars to do so.  And when I say study, I mean your recommended course load is 12 hours worth of work a day, learning 16 or so entirely different and complex areas of law.  No big deal. \n\n(2) The test itself is three days long, six solid hours of testing a day, not counting all the time you have to wait just sitting around as proctors do proctor things, and the same announcements are read to you and your thousand test-taking peers over the mic in the convention center, where extension cords dangle from the ceiling and you imagine this is how cows feel nowadays.  Or as my friend Ryan astutely put it when describing the test-taking ambiance, \"it's the exact opposite of Burning Man.\"  \n\n(3) Then, it takes almost four months for you to wait for your results.  And if the wait alone isn't enough to make you want to cry/eat/drink yourself to death, you know the exact moment the score will be available (6:00pm on a Friday), so the months/weeks/days/hours/minutes/seconds leading to that time are excruciating. If you fail, you will have to repeat the whole process.  If you pass, holy shit, you're an attorney and you're really just relieved you don't have to repeat the whole process again.  This part, more than the others I think, is not so cool.  In fact, it's maddening.\n\nMost people take that Friday off in anticipation of results, so they're not a flaming ball of stress at work.  I planned to do something like that.  And the actual night of said bar results?  Oh, I had it all planned.  I was going to check the results in the privacy of my dark, candle-lit bedroom.  I would be alone, but for the company of two critical mates: a dozen donuts from Bob's and a chilled bottle of champagne.  I expected the worst, so I also had a couple documentaries on standby about devastating stories happening in the developing world.  You know, for some perspective.  It's a goddamn test, not the end of the world.  Then I'd just stay in my room until I ran out of donuts.  This was, quite possibly, the most perfect plan I'd ever devised in my 25.5 years of living.\n\nHowever, I had to take a meeting in the East Bay for work.  Okay, no sweat.  I bought the champagne early, tucked it away into the fridge, and went onward.  Distraction would be good, focus on something besides the clock ticking down toward my ego's doom.  \n\nThe meeting ran late.  \n\nBy the time 6:00pm came around, I was on the 1, homeward bound.  I called my mom to keep my mind and body from having spasms in public, and my phone from ringing/texting with inquiries or news.  It was 6:25 when I got to my stop.\n\nBut I didn't have the donuts.  \n\nI needed the donuts.  \n\nI couldn't do this without the donuts.  \n\nSo I detour to Bob's, order up my pastries of choice (primarily old fashions, FWIW), and even make a little small talk while in there to try to stay sane, while my mom was still on the line, getting pretty frantic herself.  Bob's wasn't very crowded, and I felt no need to rush the woman who helped me.  I even thought if I happened upon a homeless person en route to my dreaded login, I'd give him a donut or two.  You know, for some perspective.  And to be a good person, in which case I wouldn't have mentioned the good deed, it would have just been an anonymous act of kindness.  But alas, stumbled upon no such unfortunate soul, so I can tell you this part.  I proceeded home.  \n\nBy the time I was in front of my computer - after I had first washed my hands mind you, I'm no animal! - to finally check my results it was maybe 6:40 or so.  At some point around here, I can't quite recall because it gets a little fuzzy, I started crying on the phone with my mom.  But I do remember I popped open the champagne, poured some into the flute waiting patiently all day at my desk.  And I ate one incredible, calming, perfect donut as I readied myself for the most foreboding click of my life.  \n\nThis is a story about how important Bob's donuts are.

While in the queue the lady behind me mentions that today, for the next 45 minutes, is national donut day! Who knew?\n\nFinally, just before midnight we got our turn. Despite a no doubt grueling day of servicing donut crazed customers for hours on end the lady at the counter cheerfully took my Groupon, allowed me to upgrade for free to the red T-shirt, and tossed in a couple jelly donuts in lieu of the lesser cake ones. Hallelujah! As the clock stroked midnight we were well on our way back to our side of town and hopefully my son has some memories. Did I mention? We're nuts and saved the donuts for the morning!", "author": "Chanel B."}

She was, however polite to the other customers who did NOT have a groupon. Isn't it the business's choice to sign up with groupon to offer those promotions? So why would they be so blatantly rude to a paying customer?  It was BOB's decision to promote their business through Groupon, not their paying customers.

If we lived closer to Bob's I'm sure we'd make it a habit, but then maybe it's for the best (for our waistlines at least) that this will have to remain a special treat.\n\nWe arrived as the donuts were being freshly baked, and while there wasn't a huge variety available yet (it was around 10:00 pm), the choices were all scrumptious. My fianc\u00e9 and I split a maple long john filled with deliciously creamy fresh custard (none of that nasty whipped cream that often masquerades at custard here), and while I think it's a little lame that the donut was cut lengthwise to be filled instead of piped, who am I to argue with deliciousness? Because we hadn't been gluttonous enough at that point, I also had a crumb donut, and the fianc\u00e9 tried a chocolate frosted and sprinkled cake donut. We both agreed that those donuts were amongst the best of those varieties we've had in the city, and I personally can't wait to sample more of Bob's confections (I've got my eye on the giant donut challenge).\n\nThe shop isn't the fanciest place you've ever been to, but it definitely has its followers for good reason.

One of the women we were with said she preferred Starbucks new old fashioned donuts. The cream in the cream filled was a delicious cream, but the actual donut part was a little stale and just uneventful. \n\nThe selection by the time we got there was pretty picked over. But again we were there at 10:30-11:00 on a saturday morning (4th of July to add even more onto it).\n\nTo sum everything up, I think this is a place where timing is HUGE.

We tried a variety of them and here is the countdown.  Cheese Danish - the best by far, generous amount of cheese filling that was very tasty, kind of sweet and buttery and a nice flakey crust - very good.  Cinnamon sugar - a good donut, not the best I've had but a solid 6 on a 1-10 scale.  Jelly filled donut - similar to the cinnamon sugar, good but not earth moving.  Sweet roll with nuts - basically tasted like white bread dough coated in cinnamon then rolled up with a few nuts sprinkled on top, not sweet or caramelize sugar tasting at all.  Old Fashion (sour cream?) glazed donut - probably worst of the bunch, basically tasted like grease with lots of sugar glazing on it.  Not much donut to it at all, normal size donut but only about  1/2 inch in diameter.  Also not the cleanest or best organized store I've been to.

In my opinion, the donuts themselves were complete perfection. We cut up and shared quite a few, and my favorite was the buttermilk with chocolate frosting. The buttermilk ones are dense, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying. I'm also a fan of the classic cinnamon sugar, and I even really liked the creme filled eclair (usually not my thing at all, but the custard was incredible!) \n\nThey're very fairly priced, so you can walk out with a bunch to try them all. Or if you decide to just stick to one, I don't think you can go wrong with any choice. Honestly, I'm not even really a donut person, but I'm already craving more. Likely due to their dense and rich consistency rather than the standard fluffy airy kind (boring). \n\nSo the only drawback is the place itself. The donuts are displayed in the window, which may work to attract customers, but for me it was a downfall. I already came out of my way to try the donuts, so I wasn't really in the mood to stand outside in the cold to decide which I wanted. While doing so, I also unfortunately witnessed a small roach scurry through the display. This was almost enough to make us turn around, but we decided to brave it and pretend that never happened.

A nice little crunch/crispiness to the outside, then soft and warm to seal the deal on the inside. The maple to top it off was sweet to perfection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-20", "description": "I was new to San Francisco and wanted to take Anna and the boys to get donuts on the way to school one morning.  I was still learning the City so I looked up donut places on Google Maps to see which ones were on my route.  There was one named Bob's Donuts that was perfectly positioned. I clicked on the name and to my surprise I found myself on a Yelp page devoted to reviews of Bob's Donuts.  There was a whole screenful of Yelp reviews.  Wow! This was amazing. Who would bother to write a review of a donut place? \n\nI must have spent 20 minutes reading reviews for Bob's Donut Shop. There were 1048 reviews in all. They were so entertaining that I didn't even look at any other donut place. How could a donut joint attract 1,048 reviews?  To get somebody to write a single review, that would be pretty hard work.  To get over 1,000 seemed impossible.  I wondered how long it had taken to earn that many reviews.  I flipped back to the 1,048th review.  It had been authored by Stephanie D. on September 16, 2009, just over two years ago.  That worked out to more than a review a day.  I tried to imagine who wrote the reviews, but I couldn't really make it sensible. The only explanation I could think of was that the donuts at Bob's were just so amazingly unique that people were literally compelled to write.  I had to go there.\n\nWhen I took Anna and boys there the next morning, I was as excited as if I were 12 years old.  This place had to be great, though you couldn't tell it by looking. The shop was about 20 feet wide.  There was a long counter that ran the length of it.  On one side were racks where the donuts were stored once they come out of the kitchen.  On the other side there were old fashioned soda fountain stools along a long counter.  Anna and the boys sat on the stools and turned around in circles while we waited for service.  \n\nWe all had donuts, theirs covered with chocolate, mine with sugar. They ordered a \"side\" of donut holes. Though it is hard to imagine that any donut could live up the hype that was contained in Yelp, the donuts were really good.   But best of all, after we had been there 5 minutes, the woman who was running the place asked me if I was going to be there for another 5 minutes. I said I would. She asked if I would mind if she left to move her car. \n\nI said that I would be honored. She walked out and left me in charge of Bob's. I rooted for customers to arrive - where were all these thousands of Bob lovers when I needed them? - but sadly after 10 minutes she was back and I had to turn the nuclear codes back over to her without a single transaction. But I was very satisfied with every aspect of Bob' Donuts.", "author": "Jay D."}

Imagine Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory in your mouth, without, you know, Willy Wonka being a bastard.\n\nProbably the best, most fried thing I've ever eaten. Donut itself wasn't oozing oil, like other places (in my area) typically do - but hey, if you're eating a donut, it kind of comes with the territory - but this was a happy surprise. The inside was soft and airy, not at all dough-y or undercooked. the texture is what really sets Bob's aside; these are artesenal donuts, akin to $9 bottles of Voss tap water, only infinitely better, and way cheaper. \n\nThe glaze was sweet without screaming diabetes; this is oft over looked, as when people think of donuts they think of sugary heart attacks. I really enjoyed the chocolatey bits as much as I enjoyed the cake bits; to have both come together in such a sweet, sweet union is almost too good to believe.\n\nI want to go back and get an apple fritter; I've heard many gluttonous things about them. I hear they have great donut bars and cookies as well. Also, if you're lucky, you can see them deep fry one of their humongous donuts.\n\nFor those of you who expect healthy, green, non-carbon based donuts, this is not for you. This is for donut connoisseurs, manly men and women (or womanly men and manly women, its in the tender nob and all..)\n\nAll in all, delicious and worth the trip.

Thank god it wasn't super sweet.  But... \n Yes there's a but when things get good.  I didn't know why it's rather oily.  I figured they had fry it like 15 minutes ago but it shouldn't be that oily.  I wouldn't have minded the oiliness if the fritter was more crunchy. It was on the soggy side.  Last thing was the greasy aftertaste.  It was in my throat for the rest of the next.  Not strong but lingering. \nNot sure why it' was there since I thought Bob's was a decent establishment.  Maybe they only change the grease in the morning and I might have gotten a donut from the first batch for the evening crowd.

The beautiful aroma of sweet, fried goodness will hit you from a half a block away. A rotating assortment of donuts, cruellers (not sure of the spelling), turnovers, eclairs, and all sorts fruity, gooey tart-looking things. You can either gawk in the window or better yet just go in and buy a few. Or a dozen...  Digression: One late night I saw some poor guy, possibly drunk, come out with one of those pink bakery boxes and dude stumbled out the door and most of his donuts fell out onto Polk St. But did he walk away, cursing his bad luck? Oh hell no, he quickly jammed them back into the box (5 second rule?) and sheepishly walked away. Which prompted my friend to call out to him: \"hey those aren't donuts - those are some flo' nuts!\"  Good times. But back to the review: friendly place, a little bit on the older, grubby side (wonder how often they change the oil in those fryers) but donuts are constantly in production and there's usually a huge rack of stuff alongside whatever they've got on display in the window. Presumably the fresher stuff is on the rack. I think they take credit cards now (I remember seeing a sexier iPad terminal recently). When you get a craving for sweets, and aren't watching your waistline, come support these people.

The dough was dense but so soft and fresh. It was slight weight warm from the fryer, not oily or greasy at all. The chocolate was delicious and more reminiscent of actually melted chocolate than chocolate flavored glaze.\nThe apple fritter I had was less impressive. I read raving reviews about their apple fritters, so maybe it was overhyped for me. They at first seemed darker than I had imagined, like maybe they were fried too long. Overall maybe I just had them on a bad day and they weren't as fresh as the other donut, but they were good, just not as amazing as I expected.\n\nThe place reminds me of a donut hole-in-the wall. It was ironic because they had this cool iPad as the touch screen for the register, yet the actual maintenance of the place could use some fixing. \nI questioned when i saw tubs of glaze just sitting on the side, and you can see the level marks when the glaze set for a while. \n\nClose your eyes, get your donuts, and don't think about sanitation.

You are IT.\n\nAPPLE FRITTERS (5/5):  \n\nBob's Apple Fritters are delicious.  Warm and fresh, the apple fritters at Bob's have a mild, cake-like consistency, but it's not overly dense and doesn't make you want to drink a gallon of milk.  The donut is like a sugary pillow that melts in your mouth, and the little bits of apple pieces sprinkled throughout the fritter make for an explosion of sweetness.\n\nYes, at 4 a.m., Bob's definitely came to our rescue and we found ourselves in donut heaven for a good few minutes (yes, it only took us minutes to consume our donuts, even though we ordered a whole bunch).\n\nWe asked the cashier, \"Can you give us your best, most popular donut?\"  The answer: apple fritter.  We then asked, \"Can you give us the freshest one?\"  The answer:  apple fritter.  \n\nThis conversation was deep for two reason: (1) it shows that apple fritters are the bread and butter of Bob's Donut & Pastry Shop; and (2) it shows that the apple fritters are fresh!  I know, not that insightful, but it means a lot when you're looking for the freshest and best donut.  At Bob's, you can fulfill both quests with one donut: THE APPLE FRITTER!  And it's nice to know that you're getting fresh donuts, rather than old donuts that have been sadly sitting at the window.\n\nTHE OTHERS (3/5):  \n\nI also tried a regular sugar donut and a chocolate glazed donut.  I prefer Krispy Kreme's sugar donuts and old fashion chocolate glazed donuts.\n\nVENUE: \n\nIt looks like a donut shop.  Haha.  That's about it. \n\nThis place is open 24 hours.  Y.E.S.

I don't typically think of old fashioned donuts or even apple fritters. \n\nAlthough, this place totally changed my mind. I've only had the opportunity to taste the crumb cake old fashioned donut and the apple fritter. Oh my god Willis, these are so good. One taste of the crumb cake donut and you will be asking, if not begging, for more. Is there like crack in this mixture because man, I think I kept going back for more at least three or four times and I normally don't eat that many donuts in one sitting. After having one of the crumb cake donuts, it was indefinite as to what my fate would be...another crumb cake donut. Soooo mmmm mmmm good. \n\nThe apple fritter on the other hand was as big as my 7 year old son's head. It took all three of my kids to try and eat half of this monstrosity. The hubby and I even shared the last half of the fritter but of course I'm back to raving that there must be crack in these donuts/pastries because you can't just have one. The fritter does actually taste like fresh baked apple pie and it even smells like one fresh and warm out of the oven. Even the next day they still tasted fresh. The texture and the flavors just made you crave another one and coffee or even hot chocolate was a nice compliment to it. \n\nSo if you are in town, or in need of a glutenous fill, seek these donuts, you won't be sorry. In fact, ask for more than you are craving because you will definitely be asking for more.\n\nHopefully I'll be back to try all their other tasty morsels.

Anyway, I went with three other people and we were all going to get apple fritters, but there were only 3 left. :(  We bought those three and got some other donuts to try as well.\n\nFriend #1 had a chocolate cake donut which she described as, \"meh.\"  \nFriend #2 took a bite of the apple fritter and said, \"too sweet!\"\nFriend #3 had some apple fritter and thought it was decent.\n\nI then ripped off a piece of the shared apple fritter and I'd say overall, it was a solid \"meh.\"  The edges are crisp-ish, and the inside is soft-ish.  But overall, it tasted not that fresh (maybe I should have come around 2 a.m., as other reviewers have mentioned, to try and get a fresh apple fritter).

I've had the apple fritters here on several occasions and they've always been the same: over-fried and lacking much apple or cinnamon flavoring. Most of the time, I can taste the oil that the fritters were friend in. Not a good thing. I'm looking for a slightly crisp exterior and a nice and chewy interior with juicy sweet bits of apple mixed in. Again, not the case here. \n\nApple fritter rant aside, there are some things to redeem Bob's. The old-fashioned chocolate donuts are good. The chocolate frosting is good and they're decently sized. Still a bit over-fried, but not as big a deal with these. Everything else I've had from here has been pretty average. It just seems like a lot of cakes/pastries/cookies are either dry or bland. I've mostly stopped by when only if I happened to be nearby and wanted a donut late at night. The service here has been consistently very friendly.

My first bite was a big disappointment. I like donuts to be light and airy and melty, more like Krispy Kreme than not, and Bob's donuts are not like this, at least not the twist glaze. The donut was doughy and kind of hard and chewy. I don't think it was particularly old but neither was it just out of the oven.

This was Stop Four, our last stop, on a multi-adventure day that consisted of drinking in a saloon-like bar, filling up on all-you-can-eat sushi, and relaxing with hookah.  At the end of hookah, fellow adventurer Tanya suggested we all get donuts.  \n\nIt was 1am.  Why not?  :)\n\nWe walked over to Bob's, and Tanya was telling us that this is the best place in the city to get donuts.  \n\nWow.  I don't really have a sweet tooth, but I was certainly curious.  Best donuts in the city?  Need to try.\n\nThis is a 24-hour place, and apparently 1AM is the best time to come because that's when they roll out all the freshly-cooked donuts, piping hot.\n\nI got an old-fashioned glazed one + milk = $2.35.  My friend was smarter and got a coiled donut because she saw them bringing it out on the tray, meaning they had JUST made it.\n\nSMART DECISION.\n\nTip for you: if you come here at 1AM, you should ALWAYS go for whatever is the freshest, whatever you see them making right there and then.  That fresh, hot donut was AMAZING. I have never had a donut like that in my LIFE.  It was scrumptious, hot, soft, crazily fluffy, perfectly sweet - wondrous!  I should've gotten one of those.  \n\nSo, we sat there in that shop, at like 1:30AM on a Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, watching Oprah, and eating our donuts and milk.  It was a delicious and perfect way to end the eight hours of adventure.  \n\nThank you, Bob's Donuts, for being open late and making fresh, delicious sweet treats for silly young souls in the middle of the night.

We saw the line out the door and fully intended to keep walking, but decided that if there was a line out the door at 12:30am that it HAD to be good.\nWE WERE RIGHT. As every good drunk person does, we got three HOT donuts each and headed home. The glazed ones were fresh out of the fryer and the glaze was still drippy, so obviously those were the best. Here's how the rest were:\n\nThe Chocolate Glazed: as good as the glazed...\nThe Croissant: excellent (and my husband is a bread snob and has lived in france, so that'll tell you something)\nThe Apple Fritter: AMAZING. they are huge and delicious and wonderful.\nThe Old-Fashioned: good, but a bit crumbly. Would have definitely been better if I hadn't chosen to eat it two days later.\n\nHere's where it only gets four stars: I will say that I've been to Bob's twice. Once at 12:30am (fresh! hot!) the other was around 11am (not so hot, but still good). The selection definitely dwindles, I'm sure it's from all us drunk gluttons on Saturday night that the selection for Sunday isn't superb. \n\nThe craving for Bob's doesn't go away.

Even the TV was showing some old tv show or movie along the lines of CHiPs.\n\nGreat apple fritters which fulfilled my hunger cravings but too bad they were already cold and not fresh when I had them.  But it's a cheap eat, can't complain about that.  They had one giant glazed donut also about the size of a 12 in cake and it's only $5.  Maybe if I really liked donuts as much as Homer Simpson I would get it and frequent Bob's more often.", "author": "Tony L."}

It is definitely not your Safeway donuts. And no, it is not even similar to Krispy Kremes. \n\nI first went there for my friend's bachelor party last year. I had heard of it, but needed to go with seasoned professionals. There is a way to order at Bob's. It goes like this: \n\nYou get there between 10:30 - 11:00 pm, no earlier. You wait in line, and while you're waiting, you watch the Chinese guy who owns and runs the place prepare a brand new batch of donuts. (note: his name is 99.9% unlikely to be Bob). Then it's your turn to order. Sure they have a case full of donuts in the window display, and sure they have racks of donuts made within the last half hour, but that's not what we're after. All you have to do is point to the freshest donuts, still cooling off, maybe dripping with grease a little, and tell them you want it dipped in either their maple or chocolate frosting. \n\nThis was my second time going, but I still went by the rule of only getting the brand new donuts. There are only 2 flavors of frosting here. I go for the maple and a pint of 2% milk. Milk and donuts is like a fine wine matched to perfection to some fancy meal.\n\nMy friend and I go sit at the donut bar, watch some Letterman and bite into our warm, fresh donut. I take my first bite. Rich, soft, warm, buttery, yet light at the same time. I look down to see what the heck I'm eating. This is not a maple bar, this is not a bready cake donut that is all spongy, this is the real deal. I continue. Another bite, then we talk about how good it is, then we take a swig of milk, then an \"ahhhhh\" and then another bite. This process continues, but not for long. It's time for round 2. \n\nThe next batch are buttermilks. They are glazed this time. Again, another pint of 2% and we're ready for more. Again, warm, moist, sweet, and satisfying. I actually couldn't finish this one. I got too full. Noooooooooo! I hate that!\n\nI ask my friend who lives in the bay area if he knows the owner. He responds by saying that the Chinese guy is too busy doing his thing. And that's what makes it Bob's.", "author": "Nick M."}

The donut was still melt-in-your-mouth fluffy delicious even the day after it was baked, and the walnut-topped sticky bun was just the right amount of sweet without going over board, which makes a sticky bun perfect in my book.

And I did this with my kid on a bike, one in stroller and wife to boot (a nuclear family in SF we surely did stick out like sore thumbs.) Well, we got there and I got an apple fritter like everyone writes about. It wasn't warm and didn't seem that fresh. The rest of the family got regular donuts. To be honest, these were right on par with what you get Sunday after church in the hall. They weren't bad, they weren't great, but they weren't worth a 3/4 mile walk from the hotel.

Unfortunately, I couldn't wait around until 10-11pm where they \"supposedly\" make their fresh batches of donuts. I went at 8pm.

Here's my verdict...\n\nApple Fritter: I was surprised by it's size. It was like six inches in diameter! Huge and overwhelming. Taste was OK. I liked the apple slices inside, they did seem fresh, but not the BEST donut I've ever tasted. For all the hype, I expected WAY better, esp if it was for $1.50. 3 stars.\n\nMaple-Glazed: This tasted just like any other donut...like just the same as if I've gotten it from Safeway. Nothing special. I could've actually gotten a better donut elsewhere for less than $1. 2 stars. \n\nOne thing that did earn them some brownie points is that they are open 24 hrs...I've not heard of many donut/pastry shops that are open pass 7pm. \n\nI don't doubt how it could've actually tasted if it came out fresh, since most of the reviews from others were quite consistent of how good it was.

Every week for the past year, I make my way to Bob's Donut to pick up their World Famous Apple Fritter.  Bob's Apple Fritter is like an addicting drug that I need to take once a week to get my high.  The best way to eat an Apple Fritter is to throw it in a microwave for 30 seconds until it's warm and soft.  If you want a fresh Apple Fritter, they make them fresh at 2am every morning.  Bob's is open 24 hours, so if you work the graveyard shift or late nights, Bob's will always be there for you.            \n\nWhen I need to run errands on Polk Street it's impossible to walk by Bob's window without stopping by to get something.  Donuts decorate the front window and call your name until you can't resist any longer.  The staff are really friendly and wave to us when we walk by (that's how often we go!!!).

Really friendly service\n4. Cheap, and in the good way! You won't see any hipster, $3 donuts here. \n5. Best apple fritter around - I think what makes their fritter so good is the thickness. You still get the crispy edges, but there's also some fluffy, doughy areas too. And, of course, a perfect ration of apple and cinnamon to icing.\n6. Portion size.

I tell the boyfriend that I was hungry and I wanted to complete more of the 7x7 100 things to eat before you die... Bob's Donuts seemed to be the best bet and my girl Anne A. told me they are usually fresh after hours.\n\nI head there and ask for an Apple Fritter and was sadly informed that it wasn't available for another 20 minutes... my slightly drunken form said to wait for a fresh one... so I curb the appetite by getting a regular glazed. \n\nThis ain't your typical Krispy Creme Donut. This is deliciousness at it's finest. The doughy interior with a sweet, crispy exterior in its warmth was divine.  So divine, I got an additional 6 donut holes and coffee.\n\nThen I was thoroughly entertained for the next 25 minutes watching the donut man (who I dubbed Bob) go through his process of donut making. Kid you not, I saw him make at least 100 donuts. From the fryer, to the kitchen to fetch more donuts, to glazing the donuts, crumbing the donuts, chocolate glazing donuts, flipping the donuts, then doing the process in an seamless fashion. I was in shock and awe and enjoyed my front row view from the counter top.  Screw the conveyor belt, Bob made his donuts with love! \n\nAnd finally, he brought out cinnamon rolls and apple fritters. He kept those bad boys on the fryer longer than the other donuts and I started questioning his craft as he continued to neglect the frying goodness and tend to the HUGE donuts and chocolate or maple covered donuts. I got nervous that I'd have a failed, burned apple fritter. But the boyfriend told me to trust and so 5 minutes later, I had a fresh apple fritter in the bag.\n\nI'm no Apple Fritter fan... but Trust. This pastry is amazing, especially fresh, and especially after a night of drinking. The crispiness on the outside complimented the soft, gooey apple cinnamon goodness on the inside. The boyfriend and I enjoyed it til the very last bite.", "author": "Alyson C."}

The price is always right, under $2 for even the more complicated offerings in my experience to date.  \n\nI'm always getting my stuff to go, but it looks like a place I could just sit a spell and just be enveloped in this yeasty hug because the place ALWAYS smells so damn amazing and just looks comfortable and homey.", "author": "Charlotte M."}

As a quick disclaimer before you continue - this is MY yelp on MY favorite donut spot in the world.  Disagreeing with me is simply not allowed for this one.  \n\nSometimes I like to make outrageous claims such as:  Bob Dylan was named after Bob's Donuts.  Old Fashioned Donuts are appropriately named after the drunken founder of Bob's favorite cocktail.  Bob's is on the corner of Polk and Sacramento aka the corner of My Street and My Town.  Doughnuts are spelled DONUTS because Bob's said so (not Dunkin).  Old Asian ladies are the best at handcrafting these delicious treats due to their nimble fingers and attention to detail.  The military mistakenly drops bombs over Iraq when they should be dropping Bob's over my office.    \n\nI recently spent my 25th birthday at Bob's.  What did they give me? - oh nothing more than HONORARY Donut clerk for a few customers, a shit ton of Frits, and the whole entire store (customers included) singing happy B-day.  No matter what happens in life, I will die a happy man.  \n\nWhen I ran into Barry Zito at Bob's he told me he's a fan of All Star Doughnuts on Chestnut (LoL).  I think I may have converted him to a Bobaholic (like me)  \n\nMy favorite bars in the city are probably Mays, Hemlock, McTeagues, RBar, etc.  You see a trend?  They're all within close vicinity to divinity.  Oh and if you think I go to Bob's only after getting trunked up at these bars, then you are exactly right.  They stay open late when I'm on the donut prowl.  \n\nSo what's good at Bob's?  Oh I donno - everything!  Lots of buzz on Yelp about the fritters, but a good move is to go with whatever is freshest.  You may even end up with a cinny twist or caked D, but those are still bomb ... you know what? those are ATOMIC bomb.  It is also a good idea to order a few extra Frits to munch on during a lazy of NFL watching.

I could never figure out why the Bay Area, with its world class baked goods, never could supply me with a world class donut.  Until now, my favorite donut could be found in San Diego (VG's in Cardiff) of all places -- In a region where I could never find a decent loaf of bread. Go figure... \n\nWell, the reigning title for best donut on the planet now goes to Bob's.   This is where I start to worry.  It was kind of nice knowing that my worst food temptation was 500 miles away and I could only indulge on the occassional trip to SoCal.  I am a donut fiend, and having a donut this good so close to home could be trouble.  I'll have to fight the daily temptation of the fresh, warm glazed donut and cold (hand-poured, nice touch) milk to wash it down. How can you be so fluffy AND gooey at the same time????", "author": "Val U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-27", "description": "So for my first ever review, I would like to start out on a positive note with a special place close to home. What better place to start than with one of my all time favorite late night spots right? This one's for you Bob's!\n\n First of all, there are two important elements to what makes this place stand out:\n1) You can get a donut here 24 hours a day. \n2) They continue to make fresh donuts late at night.\n\n A traditional donut shop generally makes most of their donuts early in the morning. This means that the later you get there, the older the donuts taste. Because they are continually making donuts, just ask the staff for one from the freshest batch and you will always enjoy that fresh donut taste. And there are only a few things as magical as the melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-from-the-fryer donut taste. Just ask any cop, lol. No seriously, ask them. That being said, most of the donuts I've tried are definitely above average in texture and flavor but at the same time not really anything extraordinary. To me, the fresh donuts are really the major appeal here.\n\n The other thing that sets them apart is their GIANT DONUT. You really haven't had the full Bob's experience until you've had their big donut. Yum! As far as I've seen when I go, they have at least three flavors. Glazed, chocolate, and crumb. I've gotten the big donut a few times now and I'm leaning toward the glazed as my personal favorite.\n I'd rather not ask how many calories is in one of these things but let me just say that I definitely recommend bringing a few friends along to help finish it off. And an equally GIANT glass of milk!\n Unfortunately, these are not as plentiful as the rest of their stock so they don't always have them ready but that's the unpredictability of supply and demand yeah? Also, on one particular occasion I brought home a big donut home and discovered it was not cooked all the way through. Many sad faces were earned that day =(, but that's the only time I've been disappointed it the few years I've been going. However, I still feel they deliver an above average product quite reliably and will make it a high priority destination next time I return to the mainland. \n\nThanks Bob's, and may you continue to please donut lovers for years to come!", "author": "Freddy A."}

You could tell these donuts were going to taste really good just by looking at them.\n\nWe had the apple strudel, French cruellers (original and chocolate), crumb donuts, glazed donut,  bread pudding, and a chocolate cream filled donut. They were all a good size, moist, fresh, and not overly sweet. My favorite was definately the crumb donut. It's probably one of the best i've had. They were not warm b/c they were made earlier in the day, so I will definately come back in the morning between 10-3 when they make them. We got 10 donuts for a little over $10. Avg per donut was about $1+.\n\nIt's great that they are open 24 hrs, which means I can satisfy my donut craving any time of the day. We went around 8 pm on a Friday night and parking was difficult, but found a space nonetheless. There is about 8 counter seats, and a row of about 4-6 tables with two chairs each. You can also order coffee and milk to go along with your donut(s). TV for entertainment. Fyi, you might want to come early since it looked like a lot of the donuts were already sold out. There are def a lot more donuts i want to go back and try!\n\nIf you know you're going to be buying a few donuts, make sure you tell the person behind the counter to put them in a box or he/she may start stuffing 12 donuts into a single bag. The lady working tonight was very friendly.\n\nWill come back several times!", "author": "Veronica H."}

As I approached the shop, I saw all kinds of baked goodies in the front window including the shop's giant eye-catching donut.  There was a bit of a line as people were ordering boxes of goodies including donut holes, jelly donuts and crullers.  Trying not to eat a thousand calories, I only tried the glazed donut and the apple fritter.  The glazed donut is smaller than most glazed donuts I've had but it definitely tasted like no other donut I've had before in a dense sense.  It was not overly glazed and had a soft but nice chewy bite to it.  As for the fritter, I definitely loved the crunch of the outer layer and the nice bites of apple in the fritter.  However, the fritter was extremely grease-laden to where if I bit the fritter, I could feel the oil squeeze out of the fritter.  Fritters wouldn't be fritters without its greasy goodness but this fritter was way too greasy for me.  While I probably won't order the fritter again, I plan to return to try more of their items.  The donuts and patries are definitely easy on the pocket.  Bob's is cash only and I noticed they didn't have a menu which would be nice to see considering they have a lot of goodies to offer.", "author": "Maya S."}

But twice I came here with my boyfriend in a sudden urge for a donut to find the shop closed and dark, teasing us with its neon-lit open sign.  Even calling the phone number got no answer (obviously).  I asked the lady at the counter about their hours when I came back on a weekday.  \"24 hours!\" she said.  Then I asked, \"Even Sundays?\"  \"Oh we're closed 6-10.\"  Ahem.  That's minus one star for not posting their hours.  Sorry, I become unhappy without a sugar fix.\n\nRegardless, the pastries and donuts here are amazing.  I remember sitting at the mini tables on a \"bad date\" (not the current bf, mind you).  They are nice for an intimate post-dinner footsie, but obviously not for me.  I wished they were larger so I could get a good sugar fix without the bad date in my face.\n\nGet the donuts and pastries when they're fresh from the oven.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10 pm and had a fabulous freshly baked glazed donut.  The other times I have come, I had the apple fritter, a cheese pastry and an apple turnover.  Amazing, but would be better if warm.  I often take the pastry/donut with me back on the 49 to the mission.  Convenient location too, a block from Van Ness!\n\nI find it rather difficult to know what to get since the goods don't have labels.  It's all about pointing-- \"the thing with nuts...no no, that one to the left, no a little farther...\"  I often have to go outside to look through the window and decide what to want.  Was that an intentional design decision (give people fresh air? let pedestrians experience the goods?)  or just simply bad layout?\n\nThe ladies at the counter are unpretentious.  They happily accommodate both the rowdy club-goers and those coming for a quick sugar fix.  The walls are filled with glowing reviews of the place, but still they carry a community feeling.  \"Friends are welcome here.\"\n\nWhen I first came here, I went to Bob's diner on the corner.

Following Allison's tips, I decide to wait until 10p to leave the house, ironed a few more shirts, asked the parents if they were interested and off we went.\n\nGo to Polk, parked the car, passed by Donuts and Things and wondered where Bob's was because I remember seeing California and Polk, but no, Bob's was Sacramento and Polk.\n\nSo after some searching, I find it...a not so brightly lit donut shop with its pastries displayed in the window.....pastries and donuts that looked...well....stale and a little digusting.... for a place with nearly 500 reviews and 4 1/2 stars, this was definately not what I was expecting. Also, it being 10:30p....and according to the late night reccomendations for fresh donuts....there definately were none.\n\nAnd having craved donuts for the past few hours, I was not about to settle and get one here, no way! walked back to donuts and things, went through the doors and like a halo, there they were, a beautiful case full of donuts nicely placed, and looking FRESHLY made. \n\nordered a dozen donut holes and a half dozen of regular glazed and cake crumb donuts. The nice lady went to the back to get me some warm ones, boxed them up and off i went, happy that i FINALLY had my donuts.\n\n1 star for Bob's for looking like a donut reject bin and 4 stars for donuts and things for the great donuts, minus 1 star for not being nicely placed in the box.", "author": "P M."}

Most fritters are either too oily or gooey, but these are just perfect.  Crispy on the edges and soft, flavorful in the middle.  Bought a dozen goodies for the Engineering staff and everything was good.  I tried the glazed twist as well and it was also fresh and fluffy.  \n\nMost donuts/pastries are about $1.50 each but well worth it!\n\nThis is a destination when I get back into SF.", "author": "Erick P."}

I'm still full.  Then again, I also polished off way too much dinner mere minutes before, but that is trivial information when we're talking donuts.

Whether it is a younger worker or the owner, they have an attitude with certain customers -- they seem to love the haole customers but not their own.  The last time I came, I wanted to buy a chocolate sprinkled donut for my 3 year old daughter (who was well behaved and excited to be getting a treat) -- the owner purposefully picked one which only had a few sprinkles deep in the case when they had many other donuts with lots of sprinkles.  When I pointed this out, she said she took the one closest to her (not true), then tried to force me to buy the sparsely sprinkled donut by accusing me of touching it (I only touched the wrapper).  I then asked for napkins (3 year old), and they gave me a single napkin, forcing me to have to ask for more. I don't get it -- the donut she tried to force me to buy must have cost her 5 cents to make -- why upset a customer for life?  Then I heard her complaining to the other haole customers about us on my way out.  My 3 year old was traumatized and needless to say, we won't be coming back.

What this means:  no more size 6 dresses, no more looking like a 21 year-old in a bathing suit, and _lots_  of food - including donuts. \nAfter a hearty meal at Victor's Pizza, my crew decided to top it all off with some deep-fried doughy goodness. \nMy first impression wasn't so hot.  A homeless guy tried to help my \ntwo-year-old up onto a stool.

But,  still - WTF? Don't touch my baby, dude!!!\nThe donuts almost made up for the initial creepiness.  The kids had chocolate-coated cake donuts and I had a raspberry-filled, chocolate-covered wonder of a treat.  I think our friend Olivia went for the maple.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-24", "description": "I'm gonna meditate long and hard on this.  \n\nI've strolled past Bob's donuts a million times before but had never aspired, or even thought, to walk in.  Donuts are truly my favorite snack. To enjoy them, well, that was once a carefree snacking sensation requiring only the raw instinct to masticate with whimsy.  Once you reach this age and metabolism, enjoying deep fried dough dumplings, now much more rare indeed, takes on a heavier air of consequence and requires deliberate musing, brooding and chin stroking.  The threat of ingesting meaningless carbs, fat and calories poses only secondary concern.  More importantly, ugly premonitions of the slow, painful, gastrointestinal mini-implosion to come take flight in the mind's eye, for donuts - those irresistible little puffs of sweet dough, some airy and light, others dense and cakey - which come in an almost endless array of flavors, styles, shapes and colors, are at once the most lethal poison and the perfect pastry and thus embody true evil.   \n\nSo when my compadre and I recently revived our ancient ritual quest for the perfect donut, Bob's was one of our first destinations.  We tried Happy donut...fair.  We tried Rolling Pin...fair to middling.  We tried All Star...less than fair (pubic hair on donut).  And then we remembered Bob's.  The Bob's that we had both sauntered past countless times without a second glance.  \n\nAs you step inside, you step back in time and can hardly believe your eyes or that you've neglected this place for so long: old fashioned (formica) counter service with little (vinyl) stools, a clunky TV with a faded screen and rabbit ears, an old Triple Play pinball machine in the back corner, walls covered with near-psychedelic artistry, a grizzled bum sucking down black coffee, a friendly talkative chinese lady behind the counter serving your heart's desire from out of the racks in the window while yabbering without pause.  \n\nHush now woman.  You have entered the sacred ground of the donut temple.  You are the monk.  In an instant, words become meaningless.  To meditate on a donut is mentally backbreaking work until you find yourself gazing face to face into the enlightenment of a jelly crossed buttermilk.  Allow your burdensome worries to just (apple) fritter away, as if ethereal gasses catching a ride on the eastern winds.  Embrace the ecstasy of donut nirvana.  There are no painful consequences in the donut temple, only vinyl, formica, and pure sublime deeply fried beauty.", "author": "Rick H."}

So you can't say I didn't try to like this place.  I even had the coffee.  I can't say I was impressed.  Which is weird because all signs pointed to deliciousness.  Why?  Because we were hungry.  We wanted donuts.  Theirs smelled really good.  The weather was nice.  We found parking immediately.  And everyone and their mama loves this place.  But you know, friends, I gotta say, it wasn't all that.\n\nMy buddy and I had been stressed out for two weeks straight, so on a beautiful Sunday afternoon after a day of running errands, we had to call an Emergency Donut Break.  I tell her that there's this donut place called Bob's in the Russian Nob area that's supposed to serve some bad ass donuts and pastries.  The donuts and pastries came.  We munched on the donuts.  They were fine.  Not good, not bad, just fine.  The coffee was okay.  The apple bread pudding pie concoction was downright nasty.  All in all, a pretty mediocre experience.  I looked at the Yelp sticker displayed proudly on their pastry case, looked at my friend and just went, \"I don't get it.\"  She looked back at me and goes, \"I don't get it either.\"  Pretty much, if this place wasn't open so late at night to catch all the hungry drunks and stoners with a bad case of the munchies, they probably would not have much of a selling point.  \n\nFinal verdict?  I think you have to be drunk or stoned or both to really enjoy this place.  Totally sober on a Sunday afternoon?  Not so much.", "author": "Diana Y."}

You have to time it right you know..... if you go in the afternoon or mid-evening, you'll get the ones that have been sitting out for a while....not worth it in my opinion. But now they do glazed around 1a.m. Chocolate and other goodies around 2a.m. The Red Devil crowd can sometimes be annoying....but they don't stay long because they are too drunk and stupid to know where they are. There's even a pinball machine and you can watch random cable on their little tv when sitting at the counter. Sadly my boyfriend and I had to limit our Bob's journey's because eating donuts every night, no matter how good they are makes you really fat. Which is why if you check out some of my other reviews, I've hired a personal trainer to take off the Bob's. But there is no hating here.....I've just learned to moderate my relationship with Bob.", "author": "K B."}

Since the very first time I had their donuts I've been dreaming about eating more!! This place is just too far for me to keep coming back often.  This place probably has the best crumb donuts. The crumb donuts are big, moist, fluffy and ooooh soo freakin delish! The apple fritter or something is pretty good too. I wish it had more of an apple taste though. But nonetheless, it was yummy! I also tried the bread pudding which was topped with apples...that was sooo good. Their bread pudding is very unique..haven't had a bread pudding like this anywhere else.  I had the chocolate and glazed cruellers too and those were so moist and yummy! Of course the next time i come back here I definitely wanna get here early to get some fresh donuts.

They are constantly baking so the selection is different all the time. Bobs is the perfect stop weather you are grabbing a dozen doughnuts for your church group on Sunday morning or a dozen doughnuts for your intoxicated frat boy asshole friends on the way back from R Bar.", "author": "Adam M."}

Maybe they do that for the benefit of people working afterhours and party-goers, and I've certainly ended my fair share of eventful nights here at Bob's. Unfortunately, by day this place is totally forgettable. But it earns 3 stars for those delicious fresh donuts, which are sometimes accompanied by other out-of-da-oven pastries. Oooh, memories of a warm apple fritter. I feel like going out for drinks right now just so I can hit up Bob's. Who's with me?", "author": "Joseph R."}

BUT, i do think this place is really cool.  while we were sitting at the counter enjoying our donut, so many people came in, many appearing to be regulars since the lady working behind the corner seemed to know exactly what they would want.  if we're ever passing by here again, we will need to stop by and give this place another try.", "author": "Waynele Y."}

Bob's makes donuts fresh throughout the weekend nights and nothing compares to a fresh-out-the-frier-donut. You can debate which is the best donut, but I would just ask for whatever is freshest. They get so hot from the oil that they stay hot for a long time; you can pick up a box of fresh ones and arrive at a party with still warm, melt in your mouth sugar glazed apple fritters or ol' fashions. The place has an authentic, slightly greasy feel to it. Their drip coffee is surprisingly good against the sugar.", "author": "Sarah L."}

Dense, cold mounds of solidified lard - that's what I thought of them. But my first krispy kreme fresh off a conveyor belt converted me to the cult of light, fluffy fried fat. I became eager to try donuts of all shapes and sizes and began to crave donuts at the most inopportune moments (business meetings, yoga class...). I tried the flavors of the uber-gourmet donut and discovered the joys of the late night cold fritter. But Bob's, my friends, is the real deal. Watch your circle of raw dough float in a pool of oil and then be deftly flipped by two chopsticks. Then the golden dough is hand drenched in glaze, instantly melting on the scalding surface. A minute later it's in your hand. Perfection. In donut form. For a mere 80 cents. Go for the simple glazed. Less is more.
