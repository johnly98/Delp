I love the coffee, the Italian pastries,  the \"old North Beach\" feel of the place and the interesting people from all over the world you often meet there.  Of late, however, What the HI-FIDELITY!?? is going on with the music there.  The baristas BLAST their choice of music to the point that one has to scream to be heard by the person sitting across the table from you. Forget trying to converse with anyone.  When asked if they could lower the volume just a little, one barista replied, \"it helps us (the workers) not to have to hear your (the customers') conversations.\"  \n\nMaybe it would be better for Caffe Trieste if the customers were not there; there were no tips; the workers would not have to hear to the customers; and then they can play their choice of music as loud as they want to. Has someone lost sight of what customer service is here?", "author": "Nickie M."}

Are you (wo)man enough to know? Italian enough? Oh well, I'll share anyways... only 'cause I like you. Yo! \n\n*cues the theme of The Godfather* \n\nDid you know the classic trilogy, The Godfather, by Francis Ford Coppola, based on Mario Puzo's best selling novel, was written at Caffe Trieste back in the day?! Young Francis made this Italian caf\u00e9 a regular stop in the 1960's-1970's. Legend in the Cinema world soon follow his name. Caffe Trieste on Vallejo St. near Columbus, est. 1956 is where it all began! Yup, she's as legit as My Cousin Vinny!\n\nPerhaps my favorite caf\u00e9 in the city, definitely my spot in Little Italy. The interesting factoid about Caffe Trieste is I've been here dozens of times, but it was the \"other\" Caffe Trieste on Market & Church St. I'd frequented a decade ago. The one on Market St. no longer there, nor was it the original, oh well. This is the original and after half a century of poets, writers, and romantics... it still flexes it's pectorals! \n\nLately, I've been wandering around Little Italy trying to find the best bites in the hood. I mean all the regulars know me, like \"little Gino\" who's as big as your door, or \"big Tony\" who's the size of your Pomeranian. Yup, that wise guy humor! I mean even Joe DiMaggio who played ball up the street would crack a smile with all the funniness in North Beach! \n\nSo I wander... and I wander... until I remember hey that Italian caf\u00e9 on the corner! Like my Junior Prom date I have fond memories. Feathered hair aside, I recall strong coffee, legit Italian bites, and a vibe that can't be duplicated... Caffe Trieste! I walk in to that \"mafioso vibe\" and I feel at home, sans the olive oil on my lips. I peruse the caf\u00e9 and see an eclectic bunch of Italians, Sicilians, pseudo Italians (Snooki et al), poets, writers, tourists, romantics. Ahhh all the romantics, like me with a baseball lid tilted to the side, Yo! Caffe Trieste!\n\nI have been here two times the past two days and have ordered the following:\n\nCappuccino - Mmm so strong, yet smooth. Has that Uncle Vito kick, sans the swim w fishes. 5-Stars!\n\nBiscotti - Mmm another winner. Not too sweet and perfect dipped in the strong Cap. 5-Stars!\n\nLatt\u00e9 - No frills Latt\u00e9. Creamy rich with the signature strong Trieste coffee. 5-Stars!\n\nCombo Pizza Slice - Good, but no cigar. True Italian thin crust, just lacking the crisp & bang. 3-Stars!\n\nBaklava - Yo Adrian! Maybe the best Baklava I've had and it's more Ottoman Empire than Rome. So buttery rich, albeit smallish, so delizioso! 5-Stars! \n\nIn the end, I recommend Caffe Trieste to all. I admit it's my favorite caf\u00e9 to just relax and be me with the other eccentrics. I feel la famiglia!  Giovanni Giotta aka \"Papa Gianni\" opened his doors in 1956! RIP Papa! So, close your eyes and think for a sec you could be sipping from the cup Francis Ford Coppola caressed when screenwriting The Godfather. Highly unlikely, but your chances are way better here!

My brother is a coffee aficionado.  He lives in Berkley CA home of the original Pete's Coffee which was about 2 blocks from his home.  As you may know Berkeley is also the home of UC Berkeley which has many coffee shops.  \n\nHe bought me an iced cafe latte that was so delicious & full bodied without any bitterness or acidity, just a good strong robust flavor that was so smooth and delicious.  I asked the barista what type of coffee it was.  He told me it was their secret blend (I think he was the owner).  I enjoyed it so much I bought another round for my brother & 2 business partners for $20.  A bit pricy but it was delicious, but a little too much caffeine.  \n\nOne of my business partners bought an assortment of pastries which complimented the coffee perfectly.  He got the following baked goods.\n     1) Pecan rectangle (this was my favorite)\n     2) Dark Chocolate Biscotti that was very good\n     3) Rectangular pastry w/some fruit topping\n     4) Triangular Pastry w/nice buttery crust w/fruit \n\nI really loved this place as it had a really cool vibe.  It was a great place to kick back and talk to my brother and friends and listen to a variety of music from jazz to blues to country....  I loved just sitting there getting a much needed caffeine fix with delicious coffee  & pastries, watching people and enjoying the company & music.  I would love to go back to this place instead of the cookie cutter coffee houses like Starbucks or Caribou....\n\nAwesome place if your ever in Frisco & you like good coffee I would highly recommend.

As we walked up there was a border collie and his owner outside and turns out my date's sheltie and this dog are friends - this shows you what kind of locals spot this is.\n\nAfter watching dogs play we walked in to that something special kind of place. While definitely on the younger side in attendance, I appreciated this more. My date pointed to the pictures on the walls with people only reading newspapers, and then we looked around and saw papers on every table and I really liked that. \n\nBut now on to food and coffee - you head towards the middle to get in line, which allows you to pass by the pastries and other baked goods. I saw a ham and cheese pastry and this being the day after SantaCon it sounded perfect. However the raspberry tarts were incredibly hard to turn down. Also got an espresso.\n\nThe coffee was solid, but the ambiance, staff, and other customers really made this place.

The clientele feels very San Fran (bearing in mind this is coming from a San Fran newbie learning the land), with an eclectic and artsy group of regular patrons. Great place to hangout for a while on a leisurely afternoon (catching up on yelp reviews!).  The pastries look decadent and they also serve wine and beer too. Saturday afternoon they have concerts too, which would be fun to come listen I would think.", "author": "Alice C."}

I have lived in North Beach on an off since the late 70s. I have spent a veritable fortune in your establishment. I was sadly enraged by some comments on your FB page. I wrote a critique of the changes that have occurred since the former days when the Trieste was managed by family members that welcomed artists such as myself. As the third and last official bassist for Sly & the Family Stone I also weathered the tantrums of the special people that frequent the establishment. Over the last years the service and hospitality, compared to the past has literally gone down the toilette. Ida has interfered with my private life outside of the establishment and interfered with my former marriage and through salacious comments she made in Lodge 120 leaving my ex-wife felt too embarrassed and humiliated to set foot ever again in your judgmental hall of shame, where gossip precludes good service and a genuine welcome. Your service employees look down on the majority of customers. They are the rudest Baristas I have ever come across. Paul take delight in his nasty quips in full earshot. I haven't frequented your establishment for about a year. I now live in Sacramento and work close to the Governor. Whatever was good about the Trieste is no more. I don't miss it all, however I passed by last week to say hello to some old friends and acquaintances, especially to pay my respects for James who just passed. I was rudely confronted and told I was not welcome in your establishment, most likely because of my critique of how what was an extended home has become a salacious harbinger of some of the lowest form of Beach society. I am appalled and disgusted. I am sure you know me as you rammed my ex-wife's brand new white Mercedes in the rear on Potrero Ave because you were distracted on your cell phone. Never once did she get an apology. Personally I could care less about your over ratted coffee and tepid ambiance. I was a friend of your late brother and your father was always a gentleman. My mother and Yolanda were good friends many moons ago. As a business you need to be aware of criticism and a Cafe should not trample on my personal life. As a musician you have never really stepped out of your own domain. It used to be fun to come in and see the neighborhood, maybe from deaths, the cost of living and the aging out of  many former customers, the Cafe changed and change sometimes is not welcome, but that is life....I hope you reconsider the rudeness and the slap in the face as you personally didn't have the guts to come and speak with me face to face? Obviously you are not like your father and as for Ida, she needs to understand there is such a thing as Defamation.", "author": "Alexander D."}

The place still has a classic  Italian cafe' feel to it, even though not so prominent any longer. There is all sorts of interesting photos and newspaper articles on the wall for customers to explore. The baristas are a bit too into themselves: surprising considering that they're evidently not Italian. \n\nBesides coffee drinks, they serve also food and beer and wine, just like you would find in Italy. It's an interesting combination for a coffee shop. As far as coffees it's mostly standard Americanized menu...there are lattes, Americanos, mochas; but they still retain some of the original Italy influenced simple drinks: espresso (variety of 1, 2, or 4 shots), cappuccino, macchiato...The coffees are served \"for here\" by default, if you want a paper cup to go it will cost 15 cents. Make sure you have cash as they don't take cards.\n\nThe food on offer did not look too fresh or appealing so I skipped and went with Espresso Grande...The barista issued a warning that it will be 4 shots of espresso. Unnecessarily doubting me...No caffeine overdose here! The espresso was really good-strong and flavorful-coming out of the hand operated machine (unlike Starbucks where they just hit a button).\n\nThe bathrooms are in the back and totally inappropriate, I just have to take a star off for it. I am by no means a large person and could barely fit in. I can hardly imagine anyone over 6' being able to squeeze into the restroom. \n\nNext time I'm in North Beach and in need of caffeine fix, Cafe Trieste will receive my patronage. However, if I am not in North Beach I will not  go out of my way and seek it out. It's good, just not something you would visit specifically...Unless you're crazy about Corleone family and everything related.", "author": "Vedran V."}

I have come full circle: Caffe Trieste, you see, is my personal GROUND ZERO where my entire love for coffee was kicked off.  [And I have my two buddies, Michael Grosse and Shane Wesbrock to curse for that!] ;^)\n\nI should clarify that my \"awareness\" for coffee happened quite early as a youth in Seattle when dear old mom would take me to the original Starbucks at Pikes Place Market when there were JUST ONLY a handful of Starbucks at this moment in time.  So you see, you haterz out there are NEVER going to get me to vilify Starbucks because for me that would be like cursing my mom.  It ain't gonna happen. But even with my decades-old appreciation for Starbucks, I still enjoy and prefer classy cafes & independent coffee houses when I get the chance to frequent them whichever city I'm in, and it doesn't get any classier or more fulfilling than visiting Caffe Trieste.\n\nTHE SETUP\n\nIt was a night of firsts that Michael helped happen.  We actually came down to San Francisco for a SONIC YOUTH show (my first) at the Fillmore (my first time at this venue) this particular night in the late 90s.  [The show, by the way, was spectacular, and Kim Gordon was to DIE FOR.]  But before hitting the Fillmore, Michael wanted to stop by Caffe Trieste - a place as of yet I'd never been (so again, another first) - and this is where we met up with our buddy Shane Wesbrock.\n\nUp until this point, I was mainly a soda freak all throughout college and law school.  But I had a mocha here and immediately fell in love with coffee, for the first time.  [Soon thereafter, Americanos, Lattes, and even espressos entered my lexicon of caffeine.  Ah, the good life!]\n\nHISTORY\n\nBut this place is much more than just coffee.  It is part of the living, breathing history of coffee in America.  Caffe Trieste opened in 1956 by Giovanni Giotta (aka \"Papa Gianni\"), who in 1950 had emigrated to San Francisco from the small fishing town of Rovigno, Italy (now part of Croatia).  Missing the espresso houses of Trieste, Italy, Giotta opened his own cafe.  And Caffe Trieste is said to be the first espresso house on the West Coast.\n\nCaffe Trieste is also a tribute to the living history of authors and beat movement philosophers whom once congregated here in North Beach and solidified their manifestos for social reorganization. Michael told me that authors such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg found and expressed their inspiration to others here while sipping on coffee.  Shane shared that Francis Ford Coppola wrote most of the Godfather screenplay while finding solace here. \n\nAnd Trieste's \"Artist\" vibe has always attracted famous artists and entertainment personalities including Bill Cosby, Joey Reynolds, Michael Douglas, Chris Isaak, Armando Peraza, Paul Kantner, Boz Scaags, Robert Vaughn, and Vincent Price to name a few.   In 2009, Israeli poet Roy Arad visited the cafe and wrote about it in his diary.  \n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nCaffe Trieste is MORE than just a place about getting a cup of coffee.  It's the caffeinated heartbeat of alternative and artistic America, and one can't help but wonder what current authors, future artists, etc., are getting their inspiration here as we speak....*turns the page*...", "author": "Michelangelo S."}

Soon thereafter, the forefathers of the budding Beat Generation, such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, took over the caf\u00e9 to compose and recite their poetry.\n\nModern-day poets on laptops in search of the perfect word still occupy many of the cafe's tables.  Black and white photographs dangling from the walls affirm the cafe's popularity with famed writers and actors.  Supposedly, Francis Ford Coppola worked on the screenplay for The Godfather while sipping espresso at Caffe Trieste.\n\nCaffe Trieste was a switched-on place for a coffee break during our visit to North Beach.  We found the baristas surly and short-tempered, but their espresso drinks were spot-on.  Caffe Trieste deserves three stars for its storied history, bohemian vibe, and robust espresso.  A little smile from the staff would have warranted a fourth star.", "author": "Joe R."}

I frequent cash-only places, greasy, dingy, hole-in-the-walls, places with weirdly aggressive or apathetic staff...but somehow my recent experience with Caffe Trieste compounded a lot of small annoyances into a generally unpleasant time. \n\nCaffe Trieste is cash-only, which is surprising for such an established place. But not a big deal if you plan ahead. The menu was nice, varied with okay pricing. I happily ordered a NY egg cream and my partner got some sort of sandwich, an espresso, and a beer. I watched the barista put my egg cream together with some half-hearted whipping of the chocolate and milk. He then overflowed the drink with carbonated water and slid it over to me without wiping the glass down. No napkin or straw accompanied my order ...which again...is fine. I toddled over to the back half of the restaurant and discovered disgusting cafe tables made up of a DIY mishmash of colorful ceramic tiles. The 1/4\" gaps between the tiles were embedded with what was pretty much soil -- a  deep, dark brown build-up of probably old food particles and human skin flakes and dirt. I looked closer and saw tiny, 1mm long translucent bugs making their home in this \"soil\". I quickly moved back to the more crowded front-end of the cafe where the tables were of the generic metal sort. Let me break it down:\n\nPros: \n- They had free, somewhat spotty wi-fi.\n- Pricing was decent (~3 for a caffeinated drink, ~8 for a plate of food)\n- Food was not bad (I admittedly can't really tell the difference between an okay espresso and an amazing espresso. The sandwich was meh, with half of the fixings on the side, which is a thing, I guess? The NY egg cream tasted fine, although it was room temperature)\n- Big windows in the front\n\nCons:\n- Cash only\n- Checked out employees and mediocre service\n- Gross tables in the back, grimy sort of place in general\n- Crazy people wandering in and yelling at the baristas/bothering the patrons\n\n\nSo I probably won't be coming back here and I really don't get how this place is so well-established. Maybe their coffee is mind-blowingly awesome and I lack the refined palate to taste it? I am at a loss.", "author": "Jasper P."}

BUT, the HILARIOUS story to follow is why I have to bump up from a 3.5 to a solid 4. Allow me to explain=) Hubby and I go in last minute after we ate a crappy dinner at the Stinking Rose (we needed a good laugh!) We come across this platinum blonde, frizzy haired old rocker dude. A true SF veteran, spending his nights tending coffee bar. Sounds like a cool dude, no? Great guess because he was. He served us a cup of coffee, even though they were closed. My husband then asked this man (who is obviously in a hurry to go home) if he knew where to get good pie, this barista apparently misheard what he said because he starts pointing to the homeless guys across the street and says, \"Down that alley I'm guessing\"....UM...?? Took us a second to realize this guy thought we were asking for POT. LMFAO!!!!!!!!! BWHAUAHAHAHA!

Additionally, I curb the stale formaldehyde soaked cherries.  The cream is dense and heavy, with almost a pasty quality.  It is about as smooth as Greco's and noticeably smoother than Cavalli's.

This specific Caffe Trieste appeared in many of the movies I rented before moving, dreaming of a SF lifestyle. And I couldn't believe it when I got a place just a block from it. I felt like I was living the dream.....until I went there for the first time and though 'OMG'!.....to finally realize that I DO live the dream! :-)\n\nLike many people have said, it's not the place for the coffee snob - when it comes to COFFEE there are better places in SF. And you do have to run into lots of tourists, as it's a SF landmark. When I first moved from SoCal I felt unsafe and overwhelmed by the local characters who were always in the place. Then there was the service - which I am ALL about. I wondered what was wrong with those people that seemed like they hated their lives and couldn't even look at  me in the eyes and acknowledge my order? Why would I go to a place to be treated like that, to be surrounded by people that looked 'crazy' and to have a mediocre coffee?!?!\n\nThen it was the day before my birthday. I walked by it and thought it would be a good idea to have an iced coffee before going home, so I stopped by. I mentioned casually that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I got the barista's attention, who decided I needed to have some wine to celebrate my big day, and I then I saw myself sitting outside, with a nice glass of white wine in my hands, surrounded by my new friends, laughing until my cheeks hurt,  contemplating a nice warm sunny afternoon in my neighborhood, just hanging out and appreciating my new life in SF! My Big day couldn't have had a better start.\n\nRabah and Hakim are now special people I call my friends. The ones that seemed so hostile, now are the sweetest people in the world! Did they change? Nope! I was the one who changed the way I looked at them. I now can SEE them! They are the nicest people, with a 'keepin-it-real' attitude. I always bring my friends here.

Whenever I'm in San Francisco, I try and come out to Cafe Trieste every day, and drink their mochas.  They use fantastic chocolate, their espresso is great, and their foamed milk is just the right balance of smooth vs. foamy.  It's also not too sweet - more a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate on the sweetness scale.   I've tried to recreate their mocha recipe 100 times, and every now and then I'll try mochas at other cafes just to see if they can compare - and they can't.  This is hands down the best ever.  \n\nA little warning though - there are a couple of other Cafe Trieste's in SF, but it's only the one in North Beach that makes the mochas so good.  I tried the one on Market St. and they unapologetically use a different recipe - using chocolate syrup in there instead of 100% chocolate powder (which is KEY), and they acknowledge that they use completely different recipes.  WHY?  WHY VARY FROM PERFECTION???\n\nAnyways - cafe trieste northbeach has the best mocha ever.", "author": "Charles G."}

There's a lot of great cafes here (Ritual, Sightglass, Blue Bottle, Four Barrel), but this one beats them all. I started stopping by occasionally in the morning and it didn't take long for the barista to remember my order and have it ready before I got to the register during the morning rush, right as I stepped in the door! Whenever I have come here, I've always felt welcome and this place has been apart of the neighborhood for decades. The coffee is always rich, well-prepared, and delicious as-is with no added cream or sugar. This place is classic to San Francisco and holds a lot of history. It's the best in every way, and although new competitors seem well-equipped, you can't beat the service and quality Caffe Trieste provides.", "author": "Leigh H."}

For those who don't know, I have a strong aversion to mayonnaise and had to deal with the fact that it's on or comes with just about everything in the UK. I adapted and I've become a little less high strung since then.\n\nThe last time I went to Trieste, I threw a Yelp bitchfest about the lack of outlets, the lack of nonfat milk, the rude service, the poor quality pastries, etc. \n\nBut I've gone back several times and have come to the conclusion that the problem before was me, not the cafe.\n\nThere are few outlets in the shop, but it's a place that's more conducive to conversation and reading than computers. The pastries are poor, but apparently their savories are good (never tried them). They may not carry nonfat milk or soy, but the coffee is really good anyway. On top of that, they have the nihilistic history of Jack Kerouac and beat idealism  as well as Gypsy-esque music every Wednesday. \n\nThey create an atmosphere. And if you look past the little things, you can appreciate this place for what it is. It's an old building with a lot of history and old ideals.\n\nI normally order nonfat caps, but I went in this afternoon and ordered a double cap with presumably whole milk. It was rich, frothy, flavorful and exquisitely made. I took it to go and it was hot when I got back to the office to have my homemade blueberry lemon scone (which I made this morning).\n\nIt's not the best espresso I've ever had and it's not the best coffee house environment, but I like it in the evenings. I like the history and I can look past little things like soy milk now to appreciate the place for what it is.

In fact, I got a little curious when Trieste first opened. So I checked their website.  Turns out the original Caffe Trieste was the first espresso caffe in the United States..  It opened in North Beach in 1956 and was one of the hang outs for the beat scene, when Burroughs, Ginsberg, and  Kerouac were running around this hood. So this place is basically a San Francisco landmark.\n\nWe used to bop around North Beach as well, when I was a young-in...\n\nOne night, we parked and strolled over to Savoy Tivoli and took a table out front.  We managed to order drinks and tried to meet some girls.  But we were way too immature to make any real progress in that area..  But that didn't stop them from letting us into one of those dirty strip clubs on Broadway.. Watching girls dance to the Talking Heads was a little surreal.  So, thanks for the memories North Beach. And thanks Savoy Tivoli and for serving us back in the day.  \n\nThanks for the pitchers of beer and jack and cokes, and providing us the unnecessary fuel to run wild on Grant street.  Later in the night , a couple of us headed down to Caffe Trieste for some coffee to straighten up for the ride home.  Their strong coffee and pasteries saved our little asses that night.  \n\nNow fast forward to today; I headed over to Caffe Trieste after a nice afternoon lunch with a friend in North Beach for an espresso.  Not only was the espresso amazing.  I asked the guy behind the counter to hook me up with a little milk in it.  He told me to say when.  Keep going, keep going.....okay good.  That was the best espresso I have had in a long time.  Of course it was basically a custom macchiato.\n\nHe added the foamed milk to my liking and I added just the right amount of brown sugar.  Loved it. Sipped it. Then shot the rest.... Stop by the original CaffeTrieste for a slice of local San Francisco history and some the best coffee in town.", "author": "Georgio N."}

I stopped in here last weekend with a friend to enjoy the ambiance that others have favorably reviewed here and to reenergize myself with a latte. The staff was friendly and the coffee was delicious - full of flavor, strong, fresh, and very satisfying overall.  The latte was well crafted (though definitely a bit small for the price) with the proper mix of milk, foam, and espresso.\n\nUnfortunately, when I visited the caf\u00e9 was absolutely packed (all tables taken and no real place to stand...) as a woman sang at the back of the caf\u00e9 (which is small). Since there wasn't much space, my friend and I were forced to grab our coffee to go (the few tables outside were also taken - generally, the scene was chaotic).\n\nMy 3 star rating is based on this experience - great coffee with an inability to sit / enjoy the coffee inside the establishment.

Anyways, I was in North Beach recently with a few friends and when we passed by Caffe Trieste we knew that we had an obligation to try it out. However, we aborted our first attempt when, literally, a bus-load of geriatric tourists rolled up and funneled into the place. Nevertheless, when we went back, about half an hour later, the place had quieted down and we were able to order our coffee. \n\nI got to the front of the line and the barista, while not exuding warm fuzzy kindness, was perfectly friendly and even joked with me a bit (I ordered an espresso, only to be told it consisted of four shots, at which point I unordered said espresso by saying \"shit, I think I want to sleep sometime in the next week\"). I got a cappuccino instead. \n\nNow on to the coffee. My cappuccino was made to order and was very good. The coffee had a very rich and complex flavor and the whole thing was very aesthetically pleasing with little swirls in the foam and whatnot (not that I need such flourishes: see Lulu's review for reference). \n\nAlmost as important as the coffee, however, is the history of the place. The photos on the wall depict a coffee house with a rich history; apparently Francis Ford Coppola wrote much of the script for \"The Godfather\" here. \n\nAll in all I was perfectly content with Caffe Trieste.

I think it is entirely possible to have 2 people serving customers to make the line go just a LITTLE faster.  They make a damn good cup of coffee though, and I love the live music on Saturday afternoons.

There's still some part of the beat generation-enamored college kid in me who, whenever he's in North Beach, finds himself gravitating to City Lights and other Kerouac / Ginsberg / Ferlinghetti haunts nearby. I'm sure the locals are sick of it (unless they're all folks like me who've simply taken it one step further, succumbing to their nostalgia and just moving into the neighborhood to soak up the vibe all day, every day). \n\nIt wasn't until my most recent trip, however, that I finally stopped by the storied Trieste.  And, you know, discount my rating however you like for viewing the place through tourist-colored glasses.  I'm sure if I lived in the neighborhood and just wanted a quick cup of coffee and a good danish on my way to work, I'd see it differently. \n\nAnyhow, long review short: my fiancee grabbed an espresso and some blueberry coffee cake (which I nibbled on -- good stuff!  Moist, just the right amount of sweet, and good size for the price).  I noticed that the Trieste serves a New York egg cream (essentially carbonated chocolate milk, and maybe the best thing ever), and couldn't resist the chance to finally try one.  They were nice enough to make something of a production of its construction, which was cool ... I was able to see how it was made, and they seemed to understand that, hey -- this is a beverage with a little bit of colloquial history, and should be treated with a smirking sort of reverence. \n\nAs for ambiance, I give high marks.  On Saturday afternoons, the Trieste occasionally hosts live music and other performances, and there was a great little band playing traditional Italian and eastern European  folks songs when we walked up.  I poked in long enough to grab my beverages and ogle the literary wall of fame, then grabbed a seat at a sidewalk table with my fiancee. We whittled away an hour or so just enjoying the nice day, listening to the music and enjoying our food, people watching on a sunny afternoon in San Francisco.

All the desserts are worth the $4.75.  Its an amazing place.  The service can be a little rude, but its because the line seems to grow faster than the seconds that pass and customers need to understand this.  PLEASE have your money ready and when you order.

The old gritty atmosphere is what makes it, so it is a bit dirty(something else i hope to improve)but the history is in the dirt. some might not understand that and to you my advice is dont come by.

I believe the coffee is good because they roast it on site, so it really is fresh.

Simply the best. \n\nOkay (here's to those that try to compare Trieste with their taste(s) for Starbucks, and all the other coffee places opened by people who really have no knowledge of what they're doing): that's not what coffee is suppose to be. Espresso is finely ground; firmly packed -- dripped as a thick/almost syrup drink-- it takes longer than the \"little bit stronger than brewed coffee\" that is passed for what goes into those drinks bought elsewhere. Nonfat milk does not foam and is not conducive to a good latte, cappuccino -- not ever! Whipped cream is thick and put on [Mochas] with a spoon. Iced coffee is over cubes. Blenders are for booze.  \n\nThough I miss the original owners -- she always used to greet me with \"Cece\" and give me an extra large piece of wine cake... the young men that work there currently are probably the nicest; quickest thinking, get it right barristas in the City -- they're just really busy and I have watched (not regulars, but...) customers hem and hah ... because their day is blown, for they truly believe soy is suppose to be in a coffee drink -- and being behind them, I find myself thinking more impatient thoughts about them than I have ever witnessed one of Trieste's employees letting on to being annoyed (facially or verbally). The coffee is always fresh roasted/not stock-piled for months... \n\nWhen I lived away from SF, Trieste air-mailed lbs and lbs of beans to me wherever I lived... in the interim, my Xmas shopping list has become pretty easy -- I buy/ship coffee to friends. When friends come to visit SF, Trieste (not Starbucks,etc.) is where they request to go. Gladly!", "author": "Katherine H."}

I spend a considerable amount of time in North Beach, and when people ask me where to go that isn't touristy but rather true to North Beach's quirky characters and old school Italian, I point them to the direction of Caffe Trieste. \nThe coffee is good, the service friendly, but it's the overall vibe of Caffe Trieste that brings me back. Today for example...a rare day in the city where it's actually HOT. I went to Caffe Trieste for an iced tea. My friend and I sat outside amidst some kooky locals--a toothless old lady who dresses like she's 20, a poet who gave me a poem about a bull fighter, and an old guy who never seems to leave this cafe. So I suppose what I really love about Trieste is that is feels very representative of North Beach--you'll see families, yuppies, crazy local people everyone comes to know...they're usually all meshed together at Caffe Trieste.\nAnd if you don't really appreciate this sort of experience like I do, and just want a good cup of joe, well...this is the place for it too.", "author": "Sophie D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-18", "description": "1 extra star for the history, decor, and live music. As for the rest...\n\nI really want to love this place. \n\nIt  was the first place I discovered in San Francisco where I could crash-land, read a book, or spend an hour or two with a friend. I used to love it, because compared with places nearly anywhere else outside of SF it really is a great cafe. But this was before I moved here two years ago, and I've learned a lot since then.  \n\nWhat I didn't know then is that there are a plethora of amazing local cafes in this city, all of which offer what Trieste and its regulars seem to think it is. It's easy to believe that many of the 4- and 5-star reviews are coming from people who just don't know what else is out there in this lovely city.\n\nThe coffee tastes better at Blue Bottle Cafe - the last couple times I've been to Trieste the house coffee was not only not-great, it was actually pretty awful. Burnt, watered-down, and, worst of all, not hot. I can't speak for the espresso drinks, as I'm a Dale Cooper black-coffee-and-cherry-pie kind of guy.  \n\nBlue Danube is a more comfortable study or lounging spot - I don't know if it's a greed thing, but Trieste has packed so many tables in that you literally cannot fit in between them to get a seat. On top of that, there are only 4 outlets for laptops in the entire place. \n\nCafe La Vie is better for the friendly baristas - simply put, the service here sucks. This is the biggest reason I avoid this place now. I've never once gotten so much as a \"Hello\" out of the baristas there, and I've got a good rapport going at all my other regular places. I'm not looking for someone to kiss my ass and I don't expect my regular caffeine-pusher to be my new bff, but there's a base level of bonhomie to be expected anyplace that's supposed to be a comfortable hang-out / third-place kind of spot.There's a general vibe of disaffected surliness here, and I don't know whether those guys really dislike their job that much or if it's some kind of lame keepin-it-real affectation. Either way, that's fine at a bar or a diner, but that doesn't fly at a neighborhood cafe. \n\nLastly, Ritual already steals the title as mecca for the ultra-douchiest. Trieste douches, you are past your prime. \n\nI was talking to a friend about this last night, and I understand why Cafe Trieste and much of North Beach in general are as they are. No matter how many locals spurn the place, there will always be a steady stream of tourists to support it. It's the last reason I kept going, I actually like interacting with visitors, especially all the international tourists that come into Trieste so often. But when nostalgia alone is enough to keep something profitable, everything else will inevitably slip. From what I can tell and have heard from locals, Cafe Trieste has been slipping for 20 years now. \n\n\nMy general rant about most North Beach landmarks applies here: Kerouac, Bukowski, Scorsese, blah-blah. Mel Brooks said it best when he wrote Spaceballs: \n\n\"What the hell am I lookin' at?...\nNow. You're looking at now sir, everything that happens now is happening now. \nWhat happened to then? \nWe passed it. \nWhen? \nJust now. We're at now, now. \nGo back to then. \nWhen? \nNow. \nNow? \nNow! \nI can't. \nWhy? \nWe missed it. \nWhen? \nJust now. \nWhen will then be now? \n...Soon.\"\n\nIn 2009, this cafe is weak-sauce.", "author": "david p."}

But the floor was kind of dirty and there were a few too many bugs flying around (at 10pm on Saturday) for my comfort. It was a good place to take my visiting friends for some San Francisco history, but I don't think I'll make it my regular coffee joint.", "author": "Whitney R."}

There're tiny flies just owning the air (nearly Holloween, mid-afternoon), though luckily they're mostly interested in people with food. There are more interesting people here than I've seen in any coffee shop so far. They seem comfortable, and friendly, and have made this place interesting.", "author": "Brian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-01", "description": "Had a cappuccino here yesterday afternoon after a long absence.  It was wonderful & perfect.  Trieste in the Beach was the very first coffee house I walked into during my very first visit to San Francisco back in the 80's, and indeed, it hasn't really changed since, and hope it never will.  As everyone knows, it is a particularly colorful square in the colorful quilt that is San Francisco culture, a coffee sanctuary or shrine to the city's past as well as an ongoing signpost to both it's present and its future.  Sure, it's expanded into several more spots in San Francisco as well as in Sausalito and wherever else.  There's only one original Trieste, and this is it.  Coffee strong and mind awakening, black & white pics all over one wall, a wall painting on the back wall, masaic table tops, windows to the ceiling looking out onto Grant & Vallejo.  I grow older, Trieste remains.  A melancholy joy.", "author": "Roland C."}

Its near impossible to surpass the espresso drinks ( I always order a Caffe Africano which is like a less milk cappuccino, no foam) let alone match them. In addition to fantastic espresso, they have a great people like Paul in the morning, who once they know you start making your drink when they see you. And the decor is just classic North Beach old school down to the phone booth with a sliding door/pictures of the Saturday (day) Opera of times past (don't go to that unless you like serious crowds of tourists). And of course to top it off its filled with the best mix of weirdos/writers/crazys/politicos/business  to make it interesting.

All of these are true of Caffe Trieste, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go. The line can be long, the clientelle can alternate between infuriating and consolatory and it's often too deafening to get any work or reading done, but the service is quick and friendly, the coffee is of course of the highest quality and if it's sunny out and you can grab a seat outside you're set for hours. Wine by the glass is also astonishingly cheap and the tiramisu is delightful. If you're stuck on what to order I recommend the hazelnut latte.

Christmas Day did have its kinks though. Early that morning my good friend insisted that we get coffee.  Trieste was the closet place that was open. I've been there before of course, being a San Francisco native I enjoy drinking coffee all over the city.  And \"YES\" I know that Caffe Trieste is a bit different, however,  for as weird as it is it has history.  My experience of Caffe Trieste wasn't to great though.  I could care less about what other people are doing when I'm drinking coffee, but this Christmas I guess some of its regular customers do care about what people like me are doing when they are drinking coffee.   I want even talk about the service\"MY GOD\" but there was this guy sittin' at  a table next to the door who was obviously annoyed by my presence.  He let me know where I stood was irritating him, because he was trying to read the paper.  I let him know I was reading the article on the wall.  He said it was just about a man catching a fish.  I informed him I was not reading that article and that I was actually reading the article  written in Italian about the most beautiful city in the world. He wasn't impressed that some city kid who went to public school was exploring another language. No, he let me know  by stating he was still annoyed. I was just waiting on my friend so we could leave that's why I was standing by the door.  What a jerk!  Oh did I forget about the crazy guy who stormed pass me walked out and then walked back in to express to me that  he doesn't like black folk.  When I say black folks, I hope you get the picture. That was even  before I was criticized about the space I was taking in the joint. He sure needed a joint or a chill pill.  WOW what the (bleep) is that all about.
