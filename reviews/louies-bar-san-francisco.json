At the time it was fairly quiet but more people seemed to come in as we ate. Its a pretty chill bar with good bar food. \n\nThe burger is delicious! The meat patty is thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! The garlic aioli is also really good and all the flavours together just make it a really solid burger. The potato bits add a great crunch. Would order again.\n\nThe southern fried chicken sando is interesting. The flavours I get from it don't scream southern to me but like a sweet chili sauce with like a thai flavour. Its nkt bad but would try something else next time.", "author": "Chung H."}

Understandably, my feet were blistered due to the friction in this condition and had caused difficulty in my stride. I had offered to show him my blisters in hopes of staying for a meal but he mercilessly refused. I felt extremely guilty that my friends could not have a meal after the long walk there and we were all freezing and starving.\n\nI don't believe customers should be falsely accused, misdiagnosed and discriminated against for not being able to walk comfortably.

Sister bar and restaraunt Tempest in soma is one of my favorite spots and they serve alot of the same menu. Iv been interested in trying the place since its near my work, alot more convinient to get to, and supposedly an old historic whaling bar.\n\nThe food is amazing same as tempest/box kitchen. I had the quail egg and crispy pork belly potato skins and the corned beef Reuben egg rolls both of which were excellent. I got like 50 bucks of drinks as well. A shot of fernet, a top billin cocktail, and a variety of craft beers. The drinks were solid and made me drunk.  \n\nI sat at the bar and both bartenders here were dicks tho. Shortly after I sat down 2 businessmen sat next to me and within a few minutes of chatting and browsing the menu they were told to order or get out that seats are rented and this isnt Starbucks. In several hours they made zero conversation and just complained about the customers to each other. I asked one of them for a cocktail recommendation and he looked at me like something was wrong with me said shot of whiskey and left. No joke with a follow up just an autist with zero people skills in a customer service job. The bouncer and assistant who was occasionally at the bar were cool tho for what its worth. \n\nIf you want the same dank food with good service go to tempest instead. Not even anything historical or whaling related here. Not saying im a hardcore history buff but an oldschool moby dick vibe as advertised would have been cool instead of a generic alleyway dive.", "author": "Sean G."}

They have a fantastic beer selection that is always updating.\n\nA bit less obvious, but something you definitely need to pay attention to: the food!! As much as I love trying new things (and I do) I'm always a sucker for their Rueben egg roles! Holy hell, if you're a Reuben fan, a fan of meat in fried wrapper or someone with some semblance of a decent palate, then you need to get on this!! \n\nThen there's the burger! Let me preface this by saying I'm not a burger guy. If I go somewhere and see practically anything else on the menu that mildly peeks my interest, I'll pick that over a burger. Louis' is a whole different beast! This thing is out of this world!!! The description alone had me: Schmitz Ranch beef, bacon bourbon bbq jam, potato sticks, aioli and arugula on a potato pepper bun. Yes please! They cooked it perfectly; it was juicy and flavorful and everything and more that I wanted it to be. The fries were fine...nothing special, but solid fries.

I warn you that it does get packed so it's good to come here early if you want to nab some tables for your group. It does get loud here too so you might find yourself close and personal while you have your conversation, but that is part of the experience.\n\nThey had some solid food options such as the sweet potato fries & the wings. The burgers on the otherhand were alright in my opinion & normal french fries too salty, but others at the tables were big fans of them. We mainly opted for finger foods so I'd be curious to try their other food menu items since they sounded solid. \n\nThe service here was great for how busy it was during happy hour, but they really made sure to clean the tables as soon as they saw empty cups & take our orders quickly.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

Not that lunch was bad, but wasn't all that.\n\nWe ordered up burrata toast, a grilled cheese, the schnitzel sando's, the avo salads with crispy shrimp, chicken and steak and while it was all solidly priced and good portions, nothing was as gourmet as the menu made it out to be. \n\nThe avo salad with crispy shrimp was literally little bay shrimp, breaded and deep fried, with zero flavor. The burrata toast was really salty and not enjoyable and the grilled cheese sando was pretty pedestrian. Friends who had the schnitzel sando said it was huge and good, but the  roll was overkill and didn't quite compliment the sammy.\n\nService was great, and the line for a large party of 6 was closer to 30/40 minutes than the original 15/20 we were quoted.\n\nOverall, a solid dive bar serving up probably better bar food with a few beers vs a power lunch with colleagues.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

My interest was sparked when I found out that \"Louie's Bar\" not only wasn't far off from my usual SF scroll. But \"Louie's Bar\" was right across the street (kinda) from \"Montgomery St Bart\" so there wasn't any reason for me not to stop in. Intimate, Sophisticated yet Welcoming. Allow me to tell you a little bit more..\n\nThursday July 20, 2017\nLocation: Louie's Bar San Francisco, Ca\nPeople: 1 Adult\n\nStory:\nI was feeling good, and in the spirit of being a good \"Yelper\" I happened to look on my Instagram and saw that \"Louie's Bar\" showed my some love on one of my latest posts. Lucky me I was hungry and thirsty and wanted to finally say that I visited and had a chance to take in everything. Thanks to a slight look at \"Google Maps\" I set my course and headed to the bar.\n\nService/Hospitality:\nOf course I had to get my few obligatory \"Yelp\" photos in. My first encounter with staff here was by way of a \"bouncer\" the guy was pretty cool, he even asked the usual \"Are you a Yelper?\" question I tend to get at times because of my snapping a few photos. He even gave a few recommendations of things I should try when I got inside. Inside was indeed packed! but seeing that it was a Thursday evening and that a lot of people were just getting off work and the \"SF Giants\" were playing....it was to be expected. A waitress walked up to me and asked if I was there to dine or drink, I told here both and she guided me to a table and took my drink order and allowed me some time to look over a menu before she came back and took my food order. She was pleasant the whole time and smiling. Seeing how busy the place was, she could of easily been irritated or annoyed but she didn't show that at all. She knew how to handle it well and that was nice to see. Consistent checking in with me and I have to say the hour or so I was there I was hardly in unattended all the way down to asking me about my food. Great service and hospitality here all around. \n\nFood/Cleanliness:\nLet me say this, the food pictures doesn't do this place justice. This place is a must try! On \"Instagram\" and even here on \"Yelp\" this place seems to have a pretty good fan base. But the thing that had me sold the first time I saw pictures of them are their \"Sweet Lou's Bangkok Wings\" $12 and if you're a wing person as I am then these are sure to become a favorite of yours. Allow me to tell you about them..\n\nSLB Wings - Chinese Black Vinegar, Sesame Seeds, Thai Chili's and Delicious! The 3 nice sized wing portions was fried first and then coated in the sauce which was sweet and slightly tangy. The thai chili's added a nice heat to contrast the sweet and tart taste along with the nutty flavor of the sesame seeds and crunch of the skin and the juiciness of the wings. They were a hit for me and I would totally order them again.\n\nI ordered two beers during my time here, first a Anchor Steam $5 and second a Miller High Life $3. If you've had either beer before you should honestly know how both of them taste. They went well with the wings, especially the Miller High Life. I used the restroom once, and it was pretty spotless I must say, because places that tend to get busy tend to have dirty bathrooms. And I from what I could see from where I was sitting and the table around me. Everything was clean, nice! that means the staff is paying attention to detail and that's a good thing.\n\nOverall: \nI would recommend this place to the \"Yelpdom\" if you haven't been before. A nice place to join a few friend, coworkers, \"Yelpers\" for a casual drink and catch a sporting game or some show that MTV always seems to come out with. Intimate and Sexy I would describe this bar. \"Louie's Bar\" is \"San Francisco\" which is something I like about visiting SF biased bars and restaurants, because most tend to shy away from just being a \"San Francisco Bar\" and start to cater towards other cities and or destinations. I see myself as a fan and I'm sure that you will too if you decide to pay them a visit here. So I leave you with this....\n\n\"So now \"Yelpdom\" with an open heart and an empty stomach, I say unto you in the words of my uncle, \"Allez Cuisine!\"", "author": "Tre S."}

And the food comes out fast and quick!

Louie's is a solid choice as a late night dining option with reasonably priced drinks and good service.\n\nHidden on the dimly lit Stevenson, we found Louie's and entered to find a long bar on one brick wall, tables along the other brick wall, and an open kitchen in the back. We sat ourselves at a table unsure if there was a cocktail. So I went to the bar to order a beer from the complete list on the chalk board and grab a menu. The bartender was busy muddling an old fashion but still acknowledged me which confirmed that he could multi task and we would receive sufficient service.\n\nThe menu has plenty of your typical bar food but is kicked up with special ingredients and touches to make it more gourmet. Their signature item is their burger which none of us were in the mood for at the time. I ordered the short rib \"French dip\" accompanied with a pint of guinness. The braised beef elevated this sandwich above your typical French dip, but I could have done without the arugula. Also ordered were the lamb gyro and the buffalo wings which were both delicious and finished completely. Though I'm not sure the purpose of serving the wing tip, it never gets touched because there's nothing edible on it. The seasoned fries were fresh and were cooked to order.\n\nI wouldn't classify Louie's as a dive bar because of the elevated food, atmosphere, and service which would make it definitely worthy of a another visit if I'm in the area again.", "author": "Arthur M."}

A super soft pita warm pita wrapping up some delicious balls of falafel with greens, also I appreciate the tin foil wrapping to keep this goodness nice and warm while I munch away. My bf devoured his ruben and said it was super tasty. I thought the fries were nice, personally I would go for the sweet potato fries next time, but that is just my preference.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-22", "description": "I never gave much thought to Louie's since I associated it with networking mixers and other awkward events where I had to mingle. You know how to mingle, don't you? You just put your lips together and kiss ass. Yeah, I guess that's why Louie and I had a period of estrangement until somebody told me it was a good place to grab a bite for lunch. But it's a bar. Doesn't that mean I'd be having jalape\u00f1o poppers and pretzels and come back to work smelling of Lucky Strikes? No, it turns out the same guys who own the Tempest and the Box Kitchen on Natoma took over this alleyway spot on Stevenson, and the same kind of creative bar bites came over as well.\n\nOn my first visit, I went solo and was surprised at how big their lunch menu was (photo: http://bit.ly/1FdR8Zq). I ordered the $10 Hot Pastrami Sando, which was a lovely, hot mess of pastrami, pickles and shredded cabbage piled high on a sourdough English muffin. It was dripping with horseradish aioli and the whole creation was gooey with melted provolone cheese. I was semi-good and had the salad on the side instead of the fries, and it was drenched in a tangy Caesar dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1pa6Xyi). I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was, and as decadent as the pastrami was, it was just the right size not to overwhelm me with post-lunch guilt. At least not enough for me to be concerned with pastrami breath back at work.\n\nWeeks later, Jamie W. had discovered Louie's on his own and said he had the best burger there. OK then. So back for a second visit last week, we went at the height of Happy Hour thinking it would be insufferable in there. It wasn't. Even though it was fairly crowded, we had plenty of elbow room at the bar to eat and have a beer this time. Naturally I ordered the $11 Burger with bacon bourbon BBQ jam, potato sticks, aioli and arugula, all of it housed in a potato pepper bun (photo:  http://bit.ly/1BZj9HX). Done medium rare, it lived up to the hype. It was bar-friendly good, nice and juicy and with just enough creaminess between the jam and the aioli to make it a finger-licking affair.\n\nBut no salad this time as I indulged in the $6 Garlic Fries with fried herbs, sliced peperoncini, Parmesan and garlic confit. I washed it down with a nice $6 pint of Guinness which evoked warm memories of Dublin for me (photo: http://bit.ly/1torISn). Jamie changed his game and went for the $11 Chicken Parmesan Sando which took a breaded chicken breast and decorated it with squash noodles, tomato basil sauce, cherry peppers, fried capers, and creamy burrata oozing out of a soft rosemary slipper roll (photo: http://bit.ly/1FdRjnt). He wet his whistle with a tasty $7 Chocolate Pumpkin Porter direct from an Alaskan brewery. I have to tell you Louie's really exceeded my expectations for a watering hole since their bites compare favorably to a lot of the food served up on the major thoroughfares. And no mingling necessary.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...bar bites that are definitely far more than you would expect between the sandos and the burger\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...well, it's still a dark bar but not an unpleasant one\nSERVICE - 4 stars...found the servers and bartenders fast, efficient and interactive when asked\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Louie Louie Louie, Louie...

Super good!) but also full on sandwich/burger items as well for someone who wants more of a meal.  \n\nThe music also is pretty good here.  Although it's really loud(not a surprise, it's a bar) but the type of music was up my alley.  They played mostly 80's/90's stuff so I heard MC Hammer, TLC, and Run DMC amongst the many old school hits during my brief two hours here.\n\nIt's great to find a place that offers decent food with drinks as well as some very cool big screen TV's on the wall.

They say food is quick but i waited 25 minutes for a burger and fries (and the place was NOT packed at all). I'm not a burger person, i repeat I'm not a burger person.... but the burger was tasty. No water refill and no asking if everything is okay after my food was dropped off.

I went for medium-well on the patty and still came up very juice... very very juicy. The bacon bourbon BBQ jam reminded me of the sauce of baked beans. The potato sticks in the burger were a great twist, added a nice crunchy texture. Arugula gave it a more milder taste than lettuce, but I appreciated it - however towards the end I got sick of the arugula taste. The bun just tasted like a bun.\n\nSIDE OF FRIES - regular fries.

He then led us here during our wedding weekend celebrations one of the nights before the wedding to get dinner with some out of town friends. We got there at about 8pm on a Thursday night and it was PACKED. This is not a big place - it almost seems like an alley between some buildings that was closed in to make another space, but there was a football game on TV that led to it being incredibly crowded and loud. I was shocked that THIS was where dad picked to take us with some friends we hadn't seen in years. Turns out, when they were there before, it was NOT football season, and there were MAYBE 3 other sets of people in the place. My dad's gf said they never would have brought us there that night had they realized how crowded it could be!\n\nWell I'm glad we went anyway - we ended up managing to snag enough tables as the game wound down, we eventually had 10 people total in our group. We ordered drinks plus a selection of food to all share: Tacos, burgers, loaded fries (omg yum!), RANCH POPCORN (my new favorite snack!), and maybe some other things. All the food was great, everyone got their fill, and everyone had a good time. We will definitely try to come again when we're back in the city.", "author": "Amanda M."}

This is probably more a testament to my tendency to get into far too emotional of relationships with descriptions of food on menus, and really something I'll need to work through with my therapist. \n\nI mean, try starting a serious relationship with a kale salad and then having it all whisked away by the words \"We don't have that.\" I mean, I had a small house and kids in mind already, am I moving too fast? Maybe that's it. It's not you, it's me. Me and my kale house. \n\nBut honestly, the point at which it was truly heartbreaking was when essentially the drink that fit my bill (it had ginger and whiskey and something else that made it absolutely perfect) and the dish that made me super happy (anything with sweet potatoes... an-y-thing) were both out. That should have been the three strikes rule but it was Monday in the SoMa and that's apparently like going out for a breath of fresh ocean air in the middle of the desert. That oasis? An illusion, buck up, man. Buck up. \n\nSo the dishes I went with were great, big pile of greasy fries, fantastic little salad with grapes and something else, maybe. Who knows, my heart was broken. I didn't care anymore. I was busy filing divorce papers from the place in my mind the rest of the meal. The drink specials were go... eh.  \n\nCome on, you can make it through this. You can DO IT. \n\nBut seriously, the drinks were well balanced, the drink specials were varietal. Shots and a beer selections were on point, with something for just about everyone, except for those people giving up beer. Or shots. Or shots and beer. \n\nWould I go again? Of course.

Had I been alone, I wouldn't have wanted to trek here all by my lonesome. Granted, I am a broad-shouldered, nearly 6 foot tall woman, but my parents instilled in me the sort of paranoia that characters in horror movies clearly don't have. \n\nI would hate to run into some dark and shadowy figure just to get my drink on, so I would advise other ladies to make sure you have an escort if you are coming here. The FiDi seems pretty empty late at night, but still... you never know. \n\nThey have a pretty good shot and a beer deal (pint of Miller High Life + a shot of Bulleitt bourbon for 8 bux), but the food is pretty much a complete flop, at least when it comes to vegan options. It is kinda cool that they serve food until 1am, so your drunk ass doesn't have to go all the way to the Mission for a burrito. \n\nI ordered the Falafel Wrap (without tzatziki sauce and without feta). They put the cheese in it anyway, gahhhhh! ::insert string of expletives here::\n\nI really need to start being more aggressive about this and maybe even saying that I have a severe dairy allergy, since many restaurants do not take it seriously. I think I do have a slight allergy, in that I get really congested and my stomach gets queasy and angry, but maybe that's just lactose intolerance? Even so, renegade cheese DOES NOT belong in my falafel wrap. It seemed really small, but it does come with a side of fries or salad.  \n\nMy friend ordered the Sweet Potato Tacos (with no crema) and I wasn't impressed. Beyond bland, no seasoning at all, and the taters were way undercooked. \n\nI suppose that living in San Francisco, one of the food meccas in the country, has turned me into some snobby c*nt who turns up her nose at everything, but I'm just being honest.

I waited 10 minutes for our check that I asked for twice now and her response was, \"Oh did no one bring it?\" and I'm like \"umm you're the ONLY waitress working so...no\".

I ordered my first Fernet and coke.  I usually drink Fernet neat and he made it perfect in my book.  I can't really compare LOL but it was refreshing and tasty.  My sweets ordered the cheeseburger and in the words of my sweets the fries were the Bomb! I did get to try a couple before he devoured them and I would agree they were seasoned great and cooked perfect.  I was kind of depressed I didn't get more hahaha.  I guess I was too into my curry mussels and buffalo wings.  The mussels were ok.  The curry took over and I could not really enjoy the flavor of the mussels.  The sauce on the wings was delish and different but sadly the wings themselves did not seem fresh to me.  It seemed like they may have been frozen too long.  I'm so sorry to say I disliked the potato skins and that is what I was most looking forward to.  Sooooooooo sooooooo salty. Yuck!  They were edible but it was like licking a salt block.

This bar is no more than a 3-4 minute walk from the campus, so off to Louie's we went. It had the Happy Hour I desired (High Life drafts for $3 all night I think, Bud Light bottles also $3 from 4-6). That's all I needed to hear. They have some different food specials as well, but I didn't really partake in them. I had some buffalo wings that looked fairly artisan, but were tasty. The bar around 4pm is packed to the gills and there's very little ventilation, forcing you to feel like you are sitting in a sauna. There's a decent amount of seating, both with high tables sans chairs and booths, but the bar is really narrow, so it's tough to find a spot. Luckily, we were able to commandeer a booth in the back for our moderately large group (small tables can be pushed together to create one larger table for assistance). Servers are fast and attentive, and really friendly. I always appreciate a good banter with the people doing all of the heavy lifting. They have TV's overhead for sports watching too.

I had just gone to Nightlife at the Cal Academy. Had a few drinks but was resisting the $11 drink prices all night. I was on the M line heading downtown looking on Yelp for places that were open late and more than 2 stars. Finally I gave up, went to Google and found a 7x7 Article on late night food in San Francisco. I immediately began cross comparing the Yelp reviews to the website article. Luckily it didn't take long to find something open late, downtown, with good reviews.\n\nIt was a little tricky finding the place (if you see the Shields place you have gone to far; it is beside some Japanese place). Walk in scan the menu and order the burger and a drink special. \n\nThe Drink Special is on all the time. You get a shot of Bullet Bourbon and a beer for $8. I asked the server if i could get it on the rocks, and to my delight I was brought 2oz of premium Bullet Bourbon and the beer. I should clarify I know my bartender skills; that really was 2 full oz; no club shots here! So it was awesome. I drank up the bourbon sipping slowly, the food came and I ate my burger with it. Man did it hit me hard. For $8 I was instantly feeling it; I've spent $60 at other places for the same result. So needless to say it made for a great night and made the BART all that more enjoyable!\n\nNow the food is what really shocked me. For late night food I was not expecting much. The burger though was amazing! It was the type of burger that is ground chuck, cooked medium rare bloody as hell. It was amazing. \n\nLastly service was excellent, and I was given the check and my card ran really quick so I could run to catch the last BART.\n\nNext time I want some cheap drinks and late night eats I am heading there!", "author": "Chris S."}

Well, yes. This seemed a little strange. I ordered the porchetta banh mi, normally a favorite of mine. Louie's sandwich had very, very little porchetta. It was basically a veggie sandwich with a porchetta topping. This was disappointing because the pickled onions, aioli, etc. were really good together. They were just missing the meat. When our food came all 4 in my party had mostly empty drinks but none of us were asked if we'd like another round. Even when the waitress came back to clear the empty plates she didn't ask. We again had to flag her down to order a second round. \n\nWhat I did like: Louie's is off the beaten path and one wouldn't just stumble upon it, so some friends and I decided to try it for drinks & dinner on a weeknight. The atmosphere feels very casual and unpretentious, but still adult-like. And I mean for real unpretentious, not the fake SF kind that can make a place feel even more pretentious.

Excellent drink selection on both the liquor and beer front- the $8 shot n' beer specials are especially good value in SF, the land of the $12 cocktail. \nThe kitchen is clearly skilled, and the menu is focused on high end pub food, usually with some kind of gourmet twist. \n-Summer chicken sando was good but not great. The breading wasn't as crisp as I had hoped for and the aioli was pretty bland.\n-Chicken chicharones was definitely an interesting plate. The fried chicken was very moist, and if I'm remembering right it had kind of a chimichurri sauce thing going on. Very original and tasty dish.\n-Loaded fries. The potatoes were cooked _perfectly_ hat off to the man on the fry-o-lator! The \"loading\" of said fries was a little underwhelming. Pork belly, sour cream and green onions definitely added some heft to the fork, but the flavors weren't as incredible as they sounded on paper. Maybe it needs something else to set it off like a bit of dry spice?\n\nOverall, I would definitely return to this place any time, even though we eventually got chased out of there because someone (bartender?) just kept turning up the shitty death metal louder and louder and louder.", "author": "Steve D."}

We spoke and he agreed to my request of moving to the next vacant table as that would have freed up 3 consecutive tables and would have made space for 10 of us who wanted to sit together.\nNext, enters the bar manager and asks that guy to sit back in his seat. He then came up to me and very rudely asked me not to talk to his customers. I told him that its fine to tell me that he didn't like it but it's not fine to be insulting and rude to me. He went on to say that it was his bar and he could do whatever the f*** he wanted to. I was shocked!

Rivals the one in Trainspotting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJrWlHRT-18\n\nClearly, the bathroom is not of importance to the management.  It looks like it's never, EVER been cleaned before: big clumps of black gunk clustered around the perimeter of the sink...  Truly nasty.  For its location (Financial District), and the amount of money they must make, this is absolutely shameful.  How can a customer feel good about eating the food there when the bathroom is so awful?  A direct reflection of how much the owners/managers care about their business, which is to say \"Clearly, not much\".  One might make the case that Louie's is a dive bar, and that such things are to be expected.  To this argument, I say that Louie's IS NOT a dive bar; it is a DOWNTOWN bar.  Casual, yes, but not a dive.  Its patrons are not a bunch of bleary-eyed 20-something students/hipsters; they are Downtown FiDi types, and as such, Louie's should take a little pride in how they present themselves, and have a bathroom that reflects the taste/affluence of their customer base.  One might also make the argument \"What does the bathroom have to do with the quality of the establishment?\".  To this, I say \"Quite a bit\".  I shouldn't have to tell the management this; they should already know it.  Perhaps, one day, when Louie's finally catches on to these basic principles of running a business, it'll be a decent place.  Until then, I'll skip it.\n\nTo be fair, the fries are good.", "author": "Eric H."}

Anyway, on a night when it isn't busy, this place is a good quiet spot to have a low key happy hour.  On a busy night when there are people lined up to where the staircase is, it's one of the worst places.  My co-workers and I have frequented this place enough to where Cindy (the owner, I think) knows us and pushes a few tables together to make space for our crew.  She knows a few of our drink orders (I swear we do a lot of work during the day time) and asks us for our food order.  The food, well, it's toeing the line of being bad.  The nachos we usually have evolved from being the \"Nasty Nachos\" to \"Not Again Nachos\".  I mean they are really just not that good. Now, their fries have made a HUGE comeback.  They were already really great (straight from the freezer bag, but whatevs), and now they've brought in SEASONED fries!!  After a few shots of Fernet, those little things are pure gold.  Like I said, this place is a definite crap shoot and I would never say that this place is great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-19", "description": "I should preface this by saying that I have wanted a buffalo chicken sandwich for approximately 3 months now, going so far as to walk to the Denny's on Mission, which totally served these as recently as a decade ago, only to discover that they, like every other establishment that fit within my criteria of (1) being walking distance from me when I am hungry and (2) not being up a hill, don't want me to have nice things.  So this review may be biased.\n\nAt a loss for what to eat for lunch, because I am full of first world problems, I said that I didn't care what we ate because nothing sounded good, and \"all I really want is a buffalo chicken sandwich, but I would settle for a fried chicken sandwich with slaw on top.\"  We chose Louies as a compromise because it is close, has seating, and is too dark for a passerby (read: boss or client) to walk by and see us eating at a leisurely pace.  The burger is great, the Tempest (in either iteration) is delicious, and the menu changes enough that there is always something new.  Well today, as if God himself was smiling down upon me to make up for a life's worth of bad boyfriends and that time I got the H1N1, the menu boasted a new (to me) addition:  Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, with Buttermilk Ranch Slaw.  It may be the luckiest day of my life; I may, in fact, play the lottery today so that I will have enough money to hire a chef to make me buffalo chicken sandwiches at my every whim.\n\nIn summary, the sandwich was delicious.  I did that thing my mom always hated where I hummed and danced when I ate (which she believed showed an unhealthy fondness for food and a propensity for weight gain), and the waitress carded me and not my coworker, which made me feel like not an old crone.  To show I am not overly seduced by my sandwich, my only criticism was via my coworker who wished that the sourdough english muffin buns on her patty melt were not \"inside out,\" so that the juice would have soaked into the nooks and crannies.  But forget about her -- please never take away that buffalo chicken sandwich.", "author": "Sarah W."}

My husband and I shared the buffalo hot wings and loaded fries, both of which were incredible and more than enough good for the both of us; although it was after 4pm and neither of us had eaten all day. The wings were the largest I've seen and very flavorful, they were also sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles. The loaded fries had a citrusy, sour cream sauce which was absolutely amazing. I would DEFINITELY recommend this bar to anyone venturing down to San Francisco. The bar has been revamped to showcase their alcohols and the brick walls add a vintage feel to the homey atmosphere.

I think the waiter was great and really friendly but she got my order and and my friends' order all wrong. My coworker ended up getting more than he ordered and I ended up getting less. Since we ordered different cheeses he didn't want to just swap, plus I ordered fries instead of a salad. But basically I ended up taking the egg and bacon from his burger to complete my actual order. The extras a bit pricey and they even charge for tomatoes in your burger. As I recall I paid $9 for the burger and ANOTHER 8 or 9 dollars just for my toppings.

The waitress was attentive and very nice, with personality so I give her a star.  It's not her fault that the fry-a-lator guy didn't know what the eff a timer was, nor did he know that to achieve greatness in chicken wings, you have to fully cook them.  Generally from room temperature.  And if they start out frozen, you have to fry them a little longer.  For the sake of Pete, make sure they have the crispy skin on the outside, even if they have no flavor but for the firey burn of orange glaze.\n\nThe fries were EXECELLENT!!!!  I don't even care that I spelled that wrong.  The fries here, are the only saving grace.  Plain, without that garlic faux-good and without cajun masking powder (if you wanted cajun, you could have brought your own powder, or better yet, used that Japanese red sprinkles pepper stuff that makes udon so much more delicious!).  The way the fries came out, it made me forget that McDonald's is around the corner, that they have frying down to a science that even slivers of human beings can accomplish feats of physics-defying crispness.  \nIf you've ever bitten into that perfect fry, been pleasantly surprised, and then fought your dining mate for the rest of the basket, you know what I'm referring to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-18", "description": "I work very close to Louie's and it's always been a favorite haunt of my co-workers and myself. It's an awesome liitle dive bar in an alley that's not taking itself too seriously (at least that used to be the case, read on for more info). You feel you can go in and have a beer after work without being surrounded by the \"club\" atmosphere you get at some other places. That being said, don't expect any great happy hour deals there. It doesn't bother me so much, but it's a peeve of many of my co-workers that there aren't really any good deals around happy hour time. \n\nBut onto the real reason they are only getting 3 stars.... my co-workers and I used to go to Louie's for lunch EVERY Friday to get the chicken tenders. Now, I realize I have the taste preferences of a five year old, but seriously I love chicken tenders and ranch, I'd consider myself an expert on the subject. These were the best chicken tenders and ranch I have ever had. Anywhere. That's a HUGE compliment coming from me. \n\nBut recently (about a month ago now I think) Louie's was sold to new owners. The completely re-vamped the menu and of course, because my luck is awful, they took away the tenders. Now all I can do is dream about them. For many weeks we didn't go back because we were so sad about the tenders but we recently gave them their fair chance and I do have to admit, their food is pretty good. I had the B.L.T.A and my co-workers all had the burger (they said the burger was good). Sidebar -- Now this isn't technically a problem, but their menu is just stupid, they are trying to be cool or something and they call their sandwiches 'sandos,' I'm sorry but I think that's just plain dumb. Anyways,-- The menu options overall are pretty hipster, especially compared to the old Louie's. And let's face it, you're a bar in an alleyway, you should have plain, regular bar food. But anyways... the sandwich I had was pretty good, some of the bacon was a little burnt, but other than that is was tasty. The fries leave something to be desired in my opinion, nothing really special about them and they were slightly overcooked, plus they give you a pretty pathetic amount of them with your $10 meal of a sandwich and fries. The old Louie's used to really pile them on. They even changed their ranch dressing, which used to be amazing, I'll admit the kind they have now is still a lot better than most places around here so I'll accept it.\n\nThe chicken tenders being gone is my main complaint, but my second one is they have a lunch menu and a \"happy hour menu.\" The happy hour menu has pretty cool items such as loaded french fries, but you can't order them until after 3pm. Why not? You have the fries, you have the cheese and all that and I know you are cooking fries at lunch time. Why can't you slap some cheese and such on my fries before 3pm? I can understand when places have lunch menus and dinner menus that are very different, the dinner stuff is often more involved and complicated to make, so they don't offer dinner stuff at lunch time. But this is a friggin' bar, you're serving burgers and fries. Really, you can't give me the loaded fries before 3pm? Annoying...\n\nI will say the new servers are nicer and more attentitve than the old servers. And I'm super happy that Cindy is still there, she's the absolute best. \n\nSeriously, if the new owners are reading this please please please please please bring back the chicken tenders! I'm begging you! Find out where the old owners ordered them from and just give it a try. I know it doesn't fit in to your idea of your bar's style but I promise you will benefit in the sales.

In an effort to avoid the happy hour crowds, we would arrive early & open a tab with whichever friendly server/bartender graced us on that particular day. Funny enough, the staff never forgot us when the crowds arrived--they always made sure our glasses were full & our tummies properly satiated.\n\nWhen I made the decision to leave the corporate world, my boss actually used some of our team's budget to send me off the right way at this spot. I have since returned to Louie's to visit with my old cronies, and have actually stopped in to Louie's by myself a few times for one MAJOR reason.\n\nWhen it comes to San Francisco, I am a complete whore for free wireless internet.

Each attempt failed miserably. My first meal started with the Pulled Pork Sandwich at $8.00 an experience that left me wanting for a Manwich. The pulled pork was served on too soft a bun as the pork was slathered in a tomato based product that some would dare to call a sauce.  Garden gloves sold separately.\n\nThe second disastrous encounter was the Burger and Fries Combo at $7.50. The beef was under-cooked; the Brit in me would call it Blue and the onion, tomato lettuce was wilted like it had been left out at Burning Man under the hot Black Rock sun. \n\n As if that wasn't enough to dissuade me from further culinary abuses, I ordered the Fish and Chips combo with Coleslaw $9.00. I thought the cook had made a mistake when he brought out my order because I said \"I ordered the Fish and Chips, not, the Chicken Fingers\".  The chef was not amused, nor was I after I bit into what he called \"a delicate fish fillet in a cornmeal crust\".  It would have been better described as a Hush Puppy under a steam roller.......

When not crowded, its a great place to go with friends, drink, and be merry. When crowded, its small, cramped, and loud. They don't have very good drink specials and their happy hour seems to be strategically placed right before I get off work. Not much more than your garden variety bar. Not worth the trip unless your close by. If Louie's wasn't more than a few yards away you definitely wouldn't find me here. I go simply for the convenience of it.", "author": "Brad M."}

There are a few tables, after work you'll be lucky if you grab one. The beer is cold and the drinks are of decent strength. Typical after work type of crowd. There's a kitchen in the back, but have never eaten here. There's a bartender with one of the best tats I've seen. And I've only seen part of it...but still worth an extra star.", "author": "The Sock S."}

I sat down to a cup of Japanese beer on TAP for the first time ever in the USA [for me that is]. The place is just big enough for someone my size to still be comfortable and just small enough not to be obnoxious, close to the heart of the financial district so not too far to walk drunk to BART, and off the beaten path enough to skip away from the groupies and yuppies. Too hard to describe however just drunk enough not to remember. Me likes.", "author": "JP X."}

I had the turkey on sourdough with Swiss and the largest portion of coleslaw that I have ever experienced.  The sandwich was fresh but the service was not.  The woman who served us was not the happiest camper that I have ever met.  I would go back if I got lost in the city and couldn't find anything else.
