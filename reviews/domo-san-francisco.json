It's essentially a Lion King Roll (the most common name) with scallops added in. I thought it was pretty good but not great which in my world makes it a 3 star venue. The servers were friendly, would be nice if this place had a flat screen as some other sushi spots have since there was a big game going on when I popped in and that would have been reason for me (and I'm sure others) to dine in and order more.

In fact, I would have to say it was the best sushi (nigiri) that I have had in the Bay to date.\u00a0 Things that I tried (and she left it to my jurisdiction):\u00a0\n\nuni shooter (appetizer)\nscallop shooter (appetizer)\nHamachi Carpaccio\nDaddy Roll (special of the day)\nhamachi belly nigiri\nsalmon belly nigiri\nsnow crab nigiri\nuni nigiri\n\nShooters: uni + scallop\nPROS:\n- good presentation: very clean\n- pure, not too complicated: the uni came on top of avocado which complements texture wise but doesn't overpower that of the uni.  The scallop came out super clean and sweet, slightly torched but definitely not even close to being overcooked or fully cooked.\n- quantity: the pieces of scallop and uni were very large and they were generous with their portions.\nCONS:\n- NONE\n\nHamachi Carpaccio:\nPROS:\n- great amount of fish, definitely shareable\n- not overly seasoned with the sauce\n- fish was fresh\nCONS:\n- NONE\n\nDaddy Roll: tempura roll with salmon on the inside, fish roe (tobiko?) as well as topped with salmon on the outside (possibly smoked, but I cannot remember sadly)\nPROS: \n- good quantity: huge amount of fish/filler and plenty of roll pieces to share\n- good flavors and well balanced: not too much rice, the tempura and salmon on the inside were able to come through\nCONS:\n- could have a bit more fresh fish on the inside but I tend to be more of a fan of raw fish versus cooked fish.  The balance was fine, this is more of a personal preference.\n\nSnow Crab Nigiri\nPROS: \n- good quantity of snow crab\n- very filling\n- crab was not too salty (some snow crab come ridiculously salty from the salt water that it is frozen but I could be mistaken)\nCONS:\n- not as sweet as I would prefer, then again, it is not snow crab season.\n\nHamachi Belly Nigiri\nPROS: \n- super generous with the fish\n- hamachi belly was super flavorful: anything belly is, but this was an incredible rich but light and clean flavor\n- not overpowered by the wasabi underneath: I honestly feel that sometimes too much wasabi can kill a piece of really amazing nigiri.\nCONS:\n- NONE\n\nSalmon Belly Nigiri: this is probably one of my favorite types of nigiri.  It's not easy to find as well although I seem to have found it \nPROS: \n- very generous with the fish like the hamachi belly\n- not overpowering with the wasabi\nCONS:\n- cut was probably a tad bit thinner than the hamachi belly, but if I were to assume that because salmon is richer in flavor, it would be too overpowering to have as thick of a cut similar to the hamachi.  That being said, this was probably more of a preference than a con.\n\nUni nigiri: from Hokkaido.  Can't go wrong.\nPROS:\n- super generous with the uni\n- super fresh uni: Believe it or not, I've actually had spoiling uni, in Hawaii of all places, where the uni tasted metallic.  My friend told me later after a bout of GI issues that the metallic taste was consistent for uni-gone-bad.  No issues here at Domo!\nCONS:\n- NONE\n\nI would hands down come back here.  There is no real table seating though, and this place gets crowded very quickly.  Their rolls were also very unique and their daily special rolls were even more exciting.  Service was on point, waitresses were very attentive, but it also wasn't a full house when we were there and the last game of the finals for professional basketball (Warriors vs. Cavs).", "author": "Vera L."}

This time a client recommended Domo. He courted his now wife when they both lived in the city, and he swears it's the best.  So not being all that hungry we figure \"soosh\" is the best bet and decided to give it ago.\nFellow elites are pretty spot on. The sushi is fresh creative and clean with emphasis on creative. \nThe poke made me remember my first poke in Hawaii with lip smacking fondness. Clean plentiful slices of grade A tuna on a bed of seaweed salad that was an awesome start. \nThe taco was pretty creative and tasty but I was addicted to the fireballs. Reminiscent of monkey brains, hot spicy chewy goodness! So I wound up eating most of em. \n\nThe place is ridiculously small. I dropped Bae off to get in line while I ventured the area for 20 minutes to park. We still had to wait 20 more minutes. Highly recommend lift or Uber to this neck of the woods especially on a Friday evening!  As I walked toward the restaurant a Silicon Valley Bus dropped off a crap load of folks getting home from work, right out front and I noticed a few dropped in  to pick up to go orders.  Smart!\n\nI was shocked by the smallness of the place including the kitchen area that looked more like a closet. But man those hombres in back were busting it, preparing very delectable looking plates to the 15 or so patrons crowded into the dining area. \nThe wait staff was efficient and worked to keep pace with Diners and take out orders alike. \n\nI was tasked with not only snapping for Yelp but was told by my client who is land locked in Tucson to send pictures so he and his wife could ooh and Ahh with fond memories of their apparent multiple times a week dining experiences from the past.\n\nI like the creativity of sushi that's not 100% traditional and  knows to keep international palettes happy, and that visual presentation is equally important to be inventive and bold without venturing too far from traditional ingredients and flavor profiles.  Domo does this expertly and with so many creative and delicious specials written in white on the mirrored wall... you literally want to try em all. \nA place that's so intimate that you are seeing what the folks next to you are getting and have no compunction to ask \"wow that looks amazing... what's that!\"\n\nIt's just to tiny cramped and long to wait to be a regular thing. But I totally get it if you are lucky enough to live nearby. \n\nGreat date night place. Just be patient it's gonna be a while.", "author": "Craig G."}

I'm not knocking this place but, it's one of those sushi spots that gives you an experience like you'd expect for basic sushi. The only difference is that Domo is more expensive than what you're getting. \n\nI ordered the lunch special which was a solid deal. 14.99 for soup, salad and your choice of two proteins on top of rice. I opted for the spicy tuna and seared albacore and they were what you'd except. I also ordered a side of ikura nigiri and they were decent. \n\nLook. The fish is good, just good.

It's a small space, so during peak dinner hours there can be a wait.  There is indoor and outdoor seating, though I think it can be variable whether they are sitting customers outside or not.  \n\nDuring my last meal, my friend and I decided to share a few appetizers and rolls.  The seaweed salad was solid, but I was more impressed with the fish taco: they somehow found a way to combine salmon, avocado, salsa, albacore tuna, and sriracha sauce on a sheet of what looked like tempura-fried nori.  It was a somewhat messy endeavor to eat it all, but it was definitely worth the trouble.  We also tried the firecracker, which involved panko-crusted spicy tuna balls fried and covered with unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and sriracha.  I thought this was tasty, though the fish taco was definitely the standout.   \n\nFor our rolls, we tried the Wiki Wiki and the Temptation; I thought both showcased fresh fish and were not overly covered in sauce.

We went to another sushi location nearby and came to this location second. This location was about to close in less than 30 min so the moment we walked in the Asian women said to us, we're closing soon, please give me your whole order at once. A little shocked, I was like that isn't a 10/10 for service for sure. There is nothing wrong with sharing that your location is going to close, but the way she said it was shocking. Next time you (readers) say something to someone make sure you check your tone ;) \n\nPrice/value: we ordered 3 things at this location: Fish Tacos (crunchi nori, avacado, albacore, salmon, salsa & sriracha), small crudos choose any two for $8:\n(Salmon - capers, sweet onion, avocado & olive oil\nSpicy Tuna - sriracha, sesame oil, cilantro & avocado \nUni - avocado, wasabi soy & sea salt\nScallop - yuzu cucumber, tobiko, rice vinegar & sea salt\nAnkimo - monkfish liver pate)\n\nWe chose the salmon and scallop. And lastly the Castro roll (crab & avacado roll topped with salmon, hamachi, maguro & albacore).\n\nOf all the items we suggested, our total bill came out to be $33.71. I would rate this place a 3/5 for price and value. Mediocre. Nothing too special. The portions were not big, nor filling. \n\n\nTaste: The crudo came out first, $8 for what it is was not bad. Although I highly prefer the salmon over the scallop. The scallop wasn't as fresh nor was the taste amazing. My bf enjoyed the \"juice\" in it which is vinegar and seasalt but I did not like it. It was hard to chew, and did not melt immediately in your mouth. Next the fish tacos came I was surprised to see the fish cooked in this entree and the salsa+siracha being very spicy. I suggest doing raw fish on this one and adding spicy mayo which would help with the taste of the fish. The spicy salsa in this dish overpowered the fish causing it to taste merely like spicy salsa. Next the castro roll came, it was pretty much a rainbow roll, but a lot more dry. The sushi rice was subpar and the crab inside the roll was very bland. I would not suggest ordering this. Taste 3/5/ \n\nService: as first mentioned I felt rushed since the moment I came in. Right after we got our third dish the roll, she gave us our check...

Each specialty roll costs about $9-15 which is average in most places and cheap in San Francisco. The place was super quaint and didn't have a large number of seats but a counter spot facing the street was still perfect. We had the firecracker balls, the spicy hulk, and the red dragon roll for our entrees and the chicken karage as an appetizer. \n\nThe firecracker balls are highly recommended - it has a fishy eel taste to it but came out super hot and crispy so you barely taste the fishiness. The sauces for the roll was also a wonderful mixture of flavor. \n\nThe spicy hulk is good, if you're into raw fish. It's just fish wrapped in cucumber with pieces of avocado in the middle and no rice. The sauce for that is spicy and quite heavenly as well. \n\nThe red dragon roll is a typical spicy tuna roll, it was delicious but not anything out of the norm. \n\nLast but not least, the chicken karage. It was a rather large portion for $7 and was super crispy! We had to ask for rice though since chicken karage is salty in nature. \n\nOverall a wonderful experience and we'd definitely come back again.", "author": "My N."}

Everyone ordered this dish, but it didn't live up to the expectation. I took one bite and put it down and never touched it again. I'm not a fan of cold tempura fried anything. If it's fried it needs to be hot.\n\nFirecracker balls: more like firecracker sushi since it's a sliced up roll topped off with sauce. Again cold fried food is a no-no in my book. It was both bland and cold even though it was fried. Maybe it was sitting out to long before they brought it to us. Neither of us finished this.\n\nThe negi Toro was the best thing but it's basic like my brother said.\n\nSame with the salmon sashimi.\n\nThe tasting spoon with uni and the second with ankimo was a disappointment. Runny kind of old tasting uni and a less than fresh tasting ankimo.\n\nThe California roll with different fish on top, I forgot the name of it, was okay. The problem we had is that it just tasted like supermarket fresh and not like we were at a restaurant. Where's the flavor?\n\nThe worst roll was the baked California roll topped with special sauce. How could something baked still be cold and yet bland at the same time?\n\nAnd service, well, they leave you alone with water and that's self service. If you ordered tea like we did you're lucky to get one refill since they are busy with phone orders.\n\n2.5 stars rounded up only because they agreed to sit us inside.", "author": "Jack R."}

The ambience of Domo is popping, it's a nice, clean spot with a personable crowd! It's not quiet, it's not bland in decor! We got our sushi rolls and I've never gotten a spicy tuna wrapped in cucumber, instead of rice but my goodness it was so so delicious, so fresh (and so clean).  We got sashimi, salmon of course cause there's no other way to go and it was fresh, wholesome, we wanted more! Our service was excellent, our waitress was attentive and checked on us regularly which was impressive for how busy it was! In addition to our rolls, we got drinks (cause it's my birthday) and they even scored well there since I'm not really into sake, the white wine was pretty tasty. I give this place four stars instead of five because of the menu selection. You can really appreciate what the place has concocted and put together, delicious rolls I'm sure but it was a little frustrating not finding a simple salmon and avocado roll or a roll when salmon that had no crab or shrimp with it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-30", "description": "In New York City, my former home, there's a delightful sushi joint by the name of Domodomo. So stepping into Domo, a hole-in-the-wall at the intersection of Laguna and Linden, I couldn't help but think, \"will this only be half as good?\" As it turns out, not exactly. Like the city as a whole, it's about two-thirds of its east coast counterpart. \n\nCalling Domo a hole-in-the-wall is simply a turn of phrase. So apologies for any confusion. It's actually inside of a hole in the wall. Once you enter through the restaurant's door, the space itself is similar (though not identical) to other restaurant interiors you've seen. There is bar seating along the window and a sushi bar on the back wall. We sat there. \n\nI tried three rolls. The first was a special called \"Daddy.\" It consisted of green onion tempura, avocado, shiso, tobiko and ocean trout*. This roll was the best and I really liked it. Go, Dad! Next was the \"Domo,\" a ~baked~ California roll topped with salmon and scallop. This roll was the second best, and I liked it. Last came the \"Kobe Beef\" roll, containing Kobe beef, avocado and ginger. The roll was actually wrapped in the beef, which was a hoot. This roll was my third favorite, and I didn't really like it. Whereas seaweed generally succeeds in holding a roll together, the Kobe Beef roll easily fell apart. The Kobe Beef roll was less integrous than a seaweed-wrapped roll. \n\n------\n*Curiously, ocean trout is commonly referred to as steelhead, and is often confused for salmon (\"Sah-mon\"). Though they taste and look similar, the ocean trout (or steelhead), is not actually a salmon but rather a trout. More curiously, the ocean trout (still the same as a steelhead) is the same species as the rainbow trout. When the freshwater rainbow trout enters the salty ocean, it is then, by definition, a steelhead (or ocean trout). The steelhead is simply an anadromous form of rainbow trout that has migrated to the ocean. If this reminds you of the movie Air Force One, it's for good reason: the Air Force's VC-25 plane's call sign only becomes the titular \"Air Force One\" when it is carrying the the POTUS. In this 1997 flick, the President is Medal of Honor winner James Marshall, played (spectacularly) by Harrison Ford.", "author": "Oliver S."}

The Alpha roll was good but because it was lathered in sauce rather than because of the pure quality of the fish. I liked the Salmon Citron roll and the lemon undertones.

I got there about five minutes after opening and all the indoor seats were already taken. Luckily, they have a few tables outside which are actually really  nice since weather in SF has been pretty good. They're also more fun if you want to people watch. I also personally liked the outside seating more because the inside smelled really oily and restuaranty. \n\nI got the seared albacore tataki, the fiesta roll, and the I.C. roll. Part of me regrets not following what other Yelpers suggested, but I'm just not really a fan of unagi so some of the more popular rolls wouldn't have made much sense for me.\n\nSeared albacore tataki--so spot on and so so so delicious. Would highly recommend you order this if you go! The albacore slices are super generous and the ponzu sauce just completes it perfectly. I''d definitely consider just eating this as a whole meal. It's five slices per order, so if I ever go back, I'd be down for two of these lol.\n\nThe rolls... were not so great. Pretty mediocre rolls. The fish cuts were really thin and not worth it. Rolls were fine but nothing special. I liked I.C. enough, but I honestly felt like both rolls were super mediocre. \n\nAll in all, price came out to be about $20/person without tax which wasn't too bad since we didn't eat too much.\n\ntldr; meh not as good as I think Yelp makes it out to be, though the seared albacore tataki is spot on", "author": "Jasmine X."}

We were amazed that this place has such a high health score-- 100 out of 100?!?!?!? Wth!? \n\nNormally, I don't even notice the health score on restaurants. Since, I use my yelp app on my phone, the health score rating is not necessarily the thing that pops out at me when I research a place. Haha but we were looking at the restaurants' page on my boyfriend's laptop so the health score section was pretty visible to the eye which helped our decision of picking this place for dinner.\n\nThey don't take reservations. Upon arriving, we noticed there were prob about 7 little groups/couples waiting for a seat. Domo is most definitely a very petite restaurant. They had a notebook by the entrance where you can write down your name & phone #. We ended up going back to car to kill some time instead of waiting outside since it was kinda chilly & there weren't really any shops open to wander around about. Oh and we found parking in one of the residential streets/alleyway that was about 2 blocks from Domo.\n\nThe wait was about 45-50mins, I think. Yeah, the wait wasn't that fun, but it was so worth it! \n\nWe got seated in the middle of the bar counter in front of the sushi chefs making their creations. My hunny was more interested in watching them work their magic than me. Haha... We ordered the Kobe beef app, Domo roll, Crunchy Cali roll, Firecracker Balls, and the Red Dragon roll.

The fish was fresh and \"melts\" in your mouth. There's also some unique appetizers, such as fish tacos and crudos. I ordered the salmon and scallop crudos, which were delicious. They're served in little spoons, so it's a little confusing whether chopsticks should be involved in the consumption of crudos.\n\nService is really fast: they serve sushi as soon as it's made, and they work pretty quickly!

The best thing about this place is the presentation of their food! The presentation of their dishes looks so great that you take a moment to enjoy looking at it before stuffing your face! :D\n\nFor the appetizers, definitely try the carpaccios! They are delish! Their fsh tacos are also a must!  - and no, its not the type that you fold and hold with your hand. All the ingredients are layered up top and it's held up by a round, crispy taco shell on the bottom.\n\nAnd definitely order the Crudos - which is similar to sashimi but served on a spoon with different seasonings and flavorings.\n\nAs far as the rolls/nigiri/sashimi goes, they have the usual and from experience, it just depends on personal experience what you like to order (eg. I don't like my fish cooked - baked or fried - when i order rolls). \n\nOverall, an excellent sushi joint to come and visit if you're in the San Francisco earlier!

The chefs are not traditional, but this place is anything, but ordinary. We started with the Spicy Hulk- perfectly wrapped and light on the palette.\nAfter that we were ambushed in the nicest way. Croquettes are not usually in my favorites, but they were crisp and wash down perfectly with a Sapporo. The Domo roll is a must- as with most restaurant's \"house roll\". This left me with a rush of flavorful, crunchy goodness that leads into the absolute number one reason to come here...\nThe fish tacos are somehow the best dish in this gem of a sushi treasure. Overall my experience was one I would repeat and would recommend others to do so as well. The man with the glasses? Yes. That's the manager and although he won't crack a smile or offer a warm welcome, this establishment makes up for it in terms of food selection, eclectic dishes and overall warm atmosphere. In contrast, his staff was very accommodating and always stopped by at the right time to follow up with the dishes that were being brought out.

Apparently, even to my Pomeranian (no wonder he was tilting his head and looking at me all funny). \n\n\"WTF is wrong with you?\" asks, Mr. NSS. \"I'm like that blonde chick on MTV's 'Money From Strangers', she has to bow and say, 'Domo Arigato' to everyone in the sushi restaurant to get the $1,000\", I replied. \"The only thing you'll be getting is a bad hangover tomorrow\", the smart ass said. Well, no hangover today so HA!\n\nThe older I get, convenience and comfort are my bffs. Not wanting to travel far for dinner, we decided to go to Domo which is near my work. Even though Domo boosts 4 stars on Yelp, I was a bit weary going in after reading some reviews that it was a Chinese owned sushi joint. While I'm 3/4ths Chinese myself, I prefer going to Japanese owned sushi joints because most have a purist approach to sushi which is what real sushi is; no CA rolls and no bukkake of sauces all over. Would you eat an 21-day dry aged bone in ribeye covered in gravy? Doubt it; so the same thing applies with sushi. The purer the better. \n\nDomo doesn't take reservations and it's small with just 14 counter seats and three two-top tables outside so come early to avoid the wait. \n\nFitting for the neighborhood, Domo offers an array of jiveass rolls which they seem to be known for. But what separates Domo from other sushi joints in the same category is they serve solid nigiri to appease the purist sushi snobs as well. I dare say, it was better than some Japanese owned restaurants I've been to like the overrated Eiji in the Castro. \n\nFor $100 pre-tip, dinner for two was very reasonable for sushi especially with a  bottle of shochu. \n\nOUR ORDER:\n*Crudos: Ankimo, Hotate, Spicy Tuna & Sake ($14): http://bit.ly/1aOG5It\n*Fish Tacos ($8): http://bit.ly/GB4nwz\n*Hamachi Kama ($12): http://bit.ly/17x2gTP\n*Sake Toro, Kanji, Hamachi Toro, Hamachi & Sake Nigiri ($5-$5.50/pair): http://bit.ly/1g7ttAa\n*Unagi ($5): http://bit.ly/GBlEVp\n\nThe Crudos were a great way to start dinner. They sadly didn't have uni available last night so I settled for the ankimo (monkfish liver) and hotate (scallop) while Mr. NSS for the spicy tuna and sake (salmon). Both of my Crudos were very fresh with a nice tang from the ponzu sauce. They don't compare to Koo's Spoonful of Happiness though which is in a league of its own. \n\nThe Fish Tacos were surprisingly stellar. Crunchy tempura battered seaweed topped with avocado, a thick slice of salmon and tuna that was slightly torched then a generous dollop of housemade salsa. It was Japo-Mexi fusion done right. \n\nThe star of the night was the Hamachi Collar. It was perfectly broiled which left with a yummy crisp skin. The flesh was insanely buttery and flaked off with the fork with minimal effort. What made this the BEST Hamachi collar was the accompanying ponzu sauce. Not sure what was in there but it was like phuckin' liquid crack. If you see this on the specials menu make sure to order this. Lucky for us, it was available last night. \n\nFor a place that's known for their jive ass rolls, the sushi chef made some solid nigiri. My only gripe was the fish selection was minimal but of no fault of the chef since the owner is usually the one who controls the ordering. If they broaden their selection, I would love to try their omakase to see what they chef can really do.\n\nWe stayed with the more fattier selections like sake, hamachi, sake toro, hamachi toro, and kanji (trout; tastes like sake) and were not disappointed. The buttery cuts were blanketed over perfectly seasoned shari (sushi rice) and each bite made me want to kick myself for not coming to Domo sooner. Since I'm not a fan of tamago, we ended dinner with rich unagi which was glazed with a savory sweet sauce. This usually takes the place of dessert but not going to lie, we went to Smitten afterwards for some Kelvin action. \n\nService at Domo was excellent. The staff was very friendly, attentive, and timely. They work in a very small space with no real kitchen so what they do, they do it well. \n\nI'm adding Domo to my sushi rotation which means poor Mr. NSS will have to endure a whole lot more of Domo Arigato, Domo Arigato, DOMOOO ARIGAAATOOOO!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The wait is deservedly so since the sushi screams fresh!\n\nI ordered a crudo.. what's that you said? What is a crudo? Oh I'm so glad you asked - I had to ask too. It's a small bite of seafood served in one of those little soup ladles. Mine was the Scallop crudo. Delicious! Each piece of nigiri was flavorful and fresh and the signature Domo roll was very filling. Instead of having the usual hot sake, I paired my meal with their cold sake (which I can not recall the name). I was hesitant at first but the first sip reminded me of a citrus juice. Not sure if that is the flavor cold sake should have, but I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe atmosphere here is pretty chill - I am a big fan of intimate sushi settings where you can chat with the chef.

Don't even get me started on the Fatty Tuna again, we all know how much I recommend it. Domo Roll was fantastic if you love your baked rolls. I could've done without the salmon and lemon rolls only because there was basically only lemon in the end pieces and it was pretty flavorless. The Saba roll was pretty good if you like Hamachi.

I tried the uni and the ankimo, both of which were delicious, but not comparable to the spoonfull of happiness at koo sushi.\n\nWe also tried the salmon citron, 5 roll wrapped salon slices. It was ok, presentation was soso.\n\nAnd the fireball... was not good. The portion is super small. It's super fried, and basically tastes like fries rice balls.

My friends and I chose this place because another sushi place was too packed so I didn't read the full details before coming here.  The place was really small and cute.  My friends and I were the first group there for dinner.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nHawaiian Style Tuna Poke--pretty good but nothing too special.  They just mixed tuna and wakame and topped it with tako.\n\nCrudos--Salmon & Scallops.  They were both delicious. It's probably my favorite dish ordered.  They are in spoons and it's like drinking a shooter.\n\nSake Nigiri--nothing too special. It was a lot smaller than I expected but still good.\n\nRock & Roll--unagi and avocado roll.  The ratio of avocado to unagi was 2:1. I like avocado though so thought the roll was good.\n\nFire Cracker Balls--These came out very small.  It just tasted like deep fried rice balls topped with their sauces.\n\nSpicy Hulk--tuna inside a cucumber wrap. Good but probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe owner was very nice to us and constantly checked up on us.  This place can be pricey if you're looking to leave full.  I had to order more food because I was not full and no where near satisfied.\n\nI would recommend this place as a place to try at least once.", "author": "Jessica T."}

The uni was some of the freshest I have had in a while and the walu sashimi was served in meaty slices.  Very fresh with lots of flavor.  There is a wide variety of specialty rolls and a few of the basic.  Quite frankly the hamachi jalapeno roll was simple but one of the best.  At only $6 there was a good amount of fish in the role and just enough jalapeno to compliment the fish.  \n\nThe only downside is the long waits for the tables and the horrible hostess with all kinds of attitude.  You might be able to get away with being so nasty, but there is no reason to be.  The other minor annoyance is the writing of the specials on a mirror.  \n\nProbably a good concept, but functionally a terrible idea.  Very difficult to see what is written on it because of the reflection.  \n\nJust get a chalk board.  the place is small enough for everyone to see.", "author": "Scott C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-02", "description": "Unfortunately, I have to give this place 2.5 stars because of the quality of their fish. I have never bitten into a piece of nigiri or sashimi and had to chew through an unbreakable piece of muscle ? fiber. This unfortunate event happened in 2 of the 3 pieces of nigiri I had there- most quality sushi joints will have trimmed out the less desirable parts of the fish filets. It's the equivalent of biting into a piece of steak and getting your teeth stuck on a particularly stubborn chunk of gristle or tendon that you can't chew through and have to spit out. That aside, the sashimi salad was okay, the spicy tuna crudo was also okay. I find that the flavor of the fish used in each crudo (small appetizer on a big spoon) was a bit overwhelmed by sauce and all the onion / vegetable toppings they put on it. The ankimo pate crudo and fire tuna balls were definitely more enjoyable, even if the tuna rice balls were bit unconventional and mostly rice and spicy mayo, they were fun to eat. Toro belly nigiri quality was much better and almost melt-in-your-mouth soft, but one excellent dish out of 6 isn't enough to keep me coming back. Service was good, wait was okay, and window seats were a bit crowded but intimate and good for gazing outside on a rainy night.", "author": "Joy H."}

We were promptly greeted and seated at the bar as soon as we walked in.The waiter was very polite. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\n- Fish Taco: So creative and delicious! It was refreshing yet satisfying. \n\n-Spicy Hulk roll: I personally love cucumber so I thought it was so good! \n\n- Crudos: Each order comes with two: we each got the scallop and salmon one. The salmon was good and fresh. The scallop one was very good and very fresh. I was surprised. \n\n- Fiesta roll: This one was good.

My sister and I were so happy we stumbled upon Domo right before it became crowded for dinner.  We grabbed a seat at the sushi bar and were able to place our order directly through the sushi chefs. Service was prompt and our food came out quickly. We tried the following three dishes:\n\n1. *Fried Baby Octopus* (chalkboard special) - this was amazing, probably my favorite dish out of the three. Succulent baby octopus fried to a perfect crisp with some spicy mayo and micro screens scattered on the plate, what more could you ask for in an appetizer? \n\n2. *Fire Cracker Balls* - Loved this. A perfect blend of spicy tuna, crispiness, tobiko, sriracha, and spicy mayo. \n\n3. *Castro Roll* - It's nice to find a place that uses 'real' crab instead of 'imitation' crab in their rolls.  This was decent but definitely over-shadowed by our appetizers. I would probably go for something else on the menu next time. \n\nAll-in-all a tasty meal--we plan on returning soon to try the crudos, toro, and other chalkboard specials!  Street parking is available but you will need search for it and may have to walk a few blocks. There is indoor and outdoor seating (very limited!).", "author": "Kristin C."}

I thought it was strange, only because people coming in off the street were being given the same wait time. stupidly, we waited and then jumped when a table became available outside. \n\nthe subsequent service was not great, although I will say the sushi is good. not change-your-life good, but it definitely checked all of the boxes. however, it was what I saw behind the counter that compelled me to write this review.

Unfortunately my experience proved otherwise. \n\nI came here on a Monday a little after 6 pm and asked to be seated for 3 people. All seats were taken and the waitress asked us to put our name on the waitlist. At this time we were the only ones on the waitlist and were suppose to be seated next. Sadly that wasn't the case! Guest of 2 people walked in without having to be on the waitlist and the waitress happily sat them down when chairs finally opened. This happened a few times, so I asked the waitress when we will be seated paraphrasing she said \"well we only have 2 seats available at a time but a party of 3 should be leaving soon and we will sit you there.\" I thought they would be able to prioritize who came first (what's the point of a waitlist, if there not going to use it) and even though there was 2 seats available there was room to add an extra chair and although 2 separate parties of two sitting adjacent to eachother were about to close their bill, instead of keeping those seats open for us they just sat another party of 2 so of course we would never be seated at that pace. Anyway we waited 1 hour to be seated!!! (While other non-asian guests were seated under 10 mins) We were so frustrated we were going to leave!!! But we were already too hungry and have wasted our time waiting. \n\nThe food was great, service not so much.\nI felt the waitresses discriminated with prioritizing and seating their guest. I waitressed for 4 years and was an assistant manager at a restuarant before my professional career and there should be no reason guest be treated the way we did. \n\nBasically the food was good although on the pricey side, place is very small but good interior design, service bad, wait time bad.

We were so excited that we got there before the dinner rush and the fact that there was outdoor seating was an even bigger bonus. \nWhen we walked in, the waitress originally wanted to seat us indoors but we opted for the table outside because it was really stuffy inside. She was nice enough to comply and seated us at the table outside furthest from the door. \n\nAfter exploring the menu for about 10 minutes, my boyfriend and I had decided on an kobe appetizer, the crudos, and a few of their speciality rolls. Not gonna lie, we were hungry and they all sounded super delicious to us. However, after being seated for 15 minutes, I started wondering why our waitress had yet to come back and ask us for our drink order or if we had any questions about the menu. Oddly enough, we hadn't even received glasses of water. The servers were all inside so my boyfriend stood up and waved his hand inside several times to try to get their attention and let them know that we were ready. But nope, nobody paid attention to us. About 5 minutes later, we saw a waitress walk out and seat another table of two outside, closest to the entrance, who were served glasses of water after they got their menus. Weird. The server (who also happened to be our server as well) took their order shortly afterwards. We tried to flag her down but she wouldn't even look our way before she scurried back inside. Minutes later, yet another couple went in and were seated in the indoor seats facing toward us and they too received water.... Uh?\n\nAt that point I was like wtf, we've been here for 20 minutes and no one has tried to take our order or  even serve us water! I felt blatantly IGNORED. Believe me, I've worked as a server before and I know what it's like to deal with dinner rushes but after seeing two other tables receiving service after they clearly arrived after me was just inexcusable.  Not to mention, this restaurant is TINY. It's not like they couldn't see us in a crowd of only 12 diners! We gave it another 5 minutes to see if they would come around but nope. 25 minutes was enough to realize that they clearly didn't want my business. I had no choice but to just get up and leave.

I definitely recommend ordering this if you come here! Sadly, the whole \"taco\" falls apart after a few bites..\n\nWalu (Hawaiian Butterfish) - pretty good! Don't know how else to describe this\n\nDomo Roll - this seemed very popular on Yelp, so I decided to order this, but I wasn't really blown away. It's pretty much a California roll topped with salmon and scallop and baked.  It reminded me of a Dragon roll because I could barely taste the scallops.. \n\nSweet Potato Roll - I'm super lame and had to order the non-fishy food and there's not a lot of non-seafood items here, unless you want miso soup and edamame. Don't expect bento boxes of teriyaki chicken and udon because this place serves lots of fish and sushi.. The sweet potato roll was really good! Tempura fried sweet potato wrapped in rice and seaweed and then topped with teriyaki sauce (i'm guessing?) \n\nCalifornia Roll - I hear the crab meat is made from real crab, so I ordered this...

I didn't even put a lot of soy sauce on it (like I usually do) because I wanted to really taste what I was eating. \n\nEven though I was full, I couldn't resist ordering the crispy California roll which took me over the edge.

The first thing that pops in my head when I hear Domo is Bubzbeauty's puppy, the small brown furry sucker.\n\nBesides the point, my friend wanted to go to Eiji. Sad to say, they decided to take a summer vacation this week and we were in tears, sitting on the curb, wondering how it would have been if we had a taste of the sweet sweet dango.\n\nShe had another place already in mind, Domo. Only problem was that it was pretty far from where we were, in terms of walking. Decided to drive there and was seated promptly during prime lunch time. Note, this place isn't the usual chair-and-table restaurant; every seat was a bar seat, and lucky for me and my friend and her boyfriend, we managed to nab three window bar seats.\n\nSince I didn't have unagi in ages, I immediately decided on the Open Face Dragon, Who can say no to the combination of freshwater eel, tempera shrimp AND avocado over rice? My friends decided to share an order of the Hawaiian Style Tuna Poke.\n\nBoth options were pretty good; Open Face Dragon was plated with a elegant design that you would probably see in a 5-star place. I was considered that the place was going to give me a straight up bento box with all of these things in its compartments; I am pleased for the fact that Domo decided to elevate something that seems so basic.\n\nMy friend did mention that she was concern about taking me here, since she never had tried it and that it was catered more towards the American crowd, not the old-fashion hole-in-the-wall Japanese ryouri that I can get back home in Little Tokyo. Lucky for me, that thought disappeared as soon as she took her first bite of her own food.\n\nA place to get a nice meal, if you don't mind shelling out a few extra dollars.", "author": "Tom T."}

Domo is tiny - it seats maybe 20 people - and it was full when we arrived. We put our names on the list and settled in for a wait. The sushi gods were smiling on us because a few minutes later, the entire restaurant paid their checks simultaneously and left. We sat at the outward-facing counter with a lovely view of the cute block Domo inhabits.\n\nWe started with edamame. It was lightly dusted with salt: perfect. We had snow crab (from the specials menu) and unagi nigiri, both of which were fresh and flavorful. We continued with the Alpha roll which adds mango to the usual combination of fish and accoutrements for a fun twist. We also had the Fire Cracker Balls which are absolutely not to be missed. They are a refreshing take on the overplayed fried maki motif. We also snagged some negi toro (also from the specials menu) maki which was fatty and delicious. The only food I didn't love was the fish tacos - too many flavors and textures competing with each other.\n\nThe service was attentive but there was a serious lull between our first round of food and the rest of it.

However, everything they put out is great and the quality of the fish is good as well. My favorite roll is the Castro roll because of its simplicity and the huge pieces of raw fish on top. The California roll base is made with real crab, and the generous slices of sashimi make for a huge roll. The Alpha roll is also a great pick, with tuna on top along with mango and jalape\u00f1o that makes the flavor pop. For something a little heavier, the Dragon roll or the Domo roll are saucier and heavier. The Domo in particular, is baked and has a little more sauce on top, but I appreciated that it wasn't drowning in heavy flavors like baked rolls in a lot of other sushi places. The scallop on top was also a nice refreshing touch. Domo is definitely one of my new go-to spots to satisfy my sushi fix!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Crunchy, spicy bits of goodness that burst in your mouth (thanks to the roe on top). It's, quite literally, a flavor explosion-osion-osion-osion (echo fade)! Spicy tuna rolled up, breaded and deep fried topped with a variety of sauces, scallions and roe. So spicy. So good. I almost regret getting them because I know I'll end up craving them and will be unsatisfied as they are only available across the country. Sad face.\n\nDomo is a teeny tiny little sushi joint not far from my magical wonderland Miette. I stumbled upon it while wandering around and, after a week long binge on super rich foods, I decided sushi might make a good, light dinner. Of course I order the deep fried roll but that's neither here nor there. The point is, this place was good. \n\nIt's got mega limited eating. I was exploring solo so I was able to grab a seat at the bar quickly as there was one lone chair available. The wait wasn't huge but there were a handful of folks milling about at the door waiting for spots to open up. \n\nI was having a severe case of my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Everything on the menu looked so good. I wanted to try 2 appetizers and a crap ton of rolls but I limited myself to some edemame (decent--I'm not sure how edemame can be kind of subpar but this one was. There was just something a bit different to me in terms of the flavor) and a couple of rolls--the firecracker balls and the domo roll. Still too much but oh so good.\n\nThe firecracker balls were my favorite, as I mentioned, but the domo roll was a close second. A california roll wrapped in cooked salmon and seared scallops topped with spicy mayo and a few other sauces. Oh good lord those scallops were good. I wish there had been more of them (it was more salmon heavy). Although delicious it was difficult to eat. I think the scallops made it a bit hard to roll so the pieces fell apart. Huge sushi pet peeve of mine but it was damn tasty I let it slide. SLIDE RIGHT INTO MY BELLY, THAT IS.\n\nThe service is quick but not overly friendly. The sushi chefs were right in front of me but barely glanced in our direction. Focus! There were only a couple of waitstaff around and I saw them doing things like preparing the edemame and other small apps. They do a lot more than just taking your order and bringing your plates! The kitchen is visible and super teeny tiny. Like, studio kitchen small. It's amazing that they churn out so many delicious hot dishes (like the FCB) with a space as small as that. Impressive!\n\nThe prices for the special rolls are a little up there but worth it if you like sushi.

We ordered six plates to split and tried a bit of most of them: \n\nHawaiian Style Poke: Might have been the best Poke I've ever had! The addition of the seaweed salad and the octopus made it phenomenal. \n\nKobe Beef Roll: Might have been my favorite unique dish of the night. The flavors were delicious and it was a nice alternative to traditional sushi rolls. \n\nFire Cracker Balls:  Good, but I've had other fried sushi before and this was about on par. Would order again though. \n\nButterfish Nigiri: Just because :) \n\nNot sure what the last roll was because I did not try it, but it was apparently good as well.  \n\nOverall a great dining experience even though you should go into it knowing you will need to expect a wait!

Domo defied expectations in every way. The place is very small and intimate - it seats probably 30 at most. The food is simply amazing. I had the Fire Tuna Balls, friends had less adventurous fare like California and red dragon rolls - \"this is the best California roll over ever had,\" more than one time was heard.

Not a Hayes valley hipster, just a Hayes Valley visitor ( it is great and amazing how each SF neighborhood has its own distinct vibe ). Being  a bit of a Japanese food snob, I was kinda underwhelmed with Domo... especially based on many rave reviews. I kinda think the expectations of diners poking sushi in their mouth has gone down, or perhaps more accurately maybe they just don't know any better. Yup, I will admit I LOL when someone raves about how the Edemame is cooked, and I have gotten grumpy about hearing how wonderful the cutesy \"rolls\" are at joint like this.  \n\nDinner with 2 friends @ one of the rare (maybe the only) 3 person table. Thought the fish was ok. Had all of the usual nigiri treats & a roll. Having not seen one friend for quite a while, we were a chatty group. As reported it is a small & popular place. \n\nService is best described as odd, with the space cadet waiter accidentally poring tea into one of the water glasses on the table. After a few seconds the  realization  that the cheap glass tumbler was not a tea cup gripped his face.  Maybe he was trying to make iced tea. Hmmm but there was no ice. Once the sushi was mostly gone off of the plates, started feeling rushed, like hearing \"anything else you would like?\" 3 times. I then felt like saying \"good service\" would be a start. \n\nKinda wished we had gone to Suppenk\u00fcche a few doors down for a high calorie German fare with no apology.. Only in SF could you have this kind of distorted dining thought, like oh I just had an OK Japanese dinner but maybe should  have gone to Suppenkuche.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

It can hold about 15 people max, so expect a bit of a wait since they don't take reservations or call-ins. We came at about 7:50pm on a Thursday night and were seated at 8:30pm. Since there are so few patrons seated at once, the wait is very dependent on when people sat down. Sign your name on the sheet out front to get on the wait list.\n\nI always have trouble keeping track of what I eat at sushi restaurants, so I know I'm forgetting a few items and probably mistaking one or two, but here's the breakdown to the best of my ability:\n\nMy Top 3 Favorites:\n+ Small Crudos. These are little spoonfuls of goodness. We got one Uni (Sea Urchin) and one Ankimo (Monkfish Liver Pate). I tried the sea urchin and was blown away. Flavorful, delicious. My date seemed to enjoy the monkfish liver pate.\n\n+ Hamachi Carpachio, but they were out of Hamachi, so my date had the brilliant idea to ask for Butterfish instead. SO GOOD. My favorite thing all night.\n\n+ Fried octopus. A mound of little octopuses on top of arugula. I didn't think I liked octopus, but I was so very wrong. This competed with the Carpachio for my favorite item all night.\n\nOther Deliciously Fresh Items:\n+ Miso soup. Can you really go wrong with miso soup?\n+ Octopus Nigiri - made with a bit of wasabi\n+ Butterfish Nigiri - I'm officially obsessed with Butterfish\n+ Tuna Nigiri \n+ Salmon Nigiri \n+ Sea Urchin - Also one of my new favorite things ever\n\nEverything I had here was great. Highly recommend if you're willing to wait a bit and throw down for some good quality seafood. \n\nBargain Alert: They have a $13 lunch special: Soup and Salad with your choice of Chirashi, Sashimi salad, Open Face Dragon, Sushi Combo, or Maki Combo.", "author": "Talia G."}

It is very small and if you do not show up early you should plan on waiting for a bit, especially on a weekend - every time I walk by it is always packed. This is a sushi restaurant with sashimi, nigiri and rolls; there is not an option of chicken teryaki or anything similar so keep that in mind.\n\nThe quality of the fish they serve is good and getting one or two of the special rolls written on the mirror is probably the best course of action. Overall it is a little overpriced compared to similar restaurants in the area that have just as high quality of fish that I can tell. \n\nThe one thing I can not understand is why it has consistently smelled like a sewer in front of this restaurant for months now (unfortunate location maybe?).

The fish is really fresh and the rolls are just amazing. I want to say awesome, but the word is just too plain in comparison to what the sushi actually is. \n\nFor starters, I ordered two orders of uni. So dang fresh, I closed my eyes and had dreams of ocean living. My husband, on the other hand, liked watching me.\n\nThe place is small and crowded- elbow to elbow crowded. While waiting for seats, my husband (oh yay, I can actually say that now!) and I met a really cool couple, whom we ended up buying their desserts cause they were just that awesome, or it could have been the sake that I was feelin while I was waiting as well. \n\nLet's get back to the nitty gritty. The sushi was amazing. We ordered the Domo roll, which was a crazy roll that was california roll with scallops and salmon or hamachi and some other stuff I can't even remember right now, but damn, that roll was made up from some crazy imagination, it was HELLA GOOD. The sauce was somewhat garlicky, which I believe was the magic of it all. Mmm. I'm dreaming of it right now.\n\nWe also ordered the Spicy Hulk. Man. Unbelievably fantasmic. Great for spicy lovers, which I am famous for, wonderful for tuna lovers, which I am not. So it says A WHOLE LOTTA SOMETHING.\n\nThe reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because when we ordered mochi for dessert, please tell me why my husband saw them pull individual mochi balls from the box of 6 that I can buy at Pacific Super for $4.59 and then get charged $3 per ball on a fancy little dish with acrab fork? Everyone who eats this mochi ball knows we don't need utensils!!! BOO!\n\nI'm coming back! But not order mochi. I'll just bring it in my purse, just to be ghetto.", "author": "Sharon B."}

Wasn't overly dressed either.\n\nWe also had the Sake sashimi, which was melt in your mouth fresh!  \n\nThe jalape\u00f1o himachi is something to try if you like a little bit of kick.  It's basically just a plain roll with rice, himachi, fresh jalape\u00f1o and seaweed.  It was awesome!\n\nWe felt daring so we decided to try one of their interesting rolls... The Mac Daddy.  Tempura veggies and avocado rolled up with fresh salmon on top.  SO good!  \n\nWe ended with their Toro.  Mmmmmm\n\n2 things that stood out to me was the freshness of their fish and the rice to fish ratio.  Not too much rice.  Just perfect.  I believe that less is more. :)", "author": "Delilah B."}

There is only one table that seats 3 people.  Everyone else sits at the sushi bar.  The restaurant comfortably holds no more than 20 people.  There is outdoor seating available (about 3-4 tables), but with the San Francisco weather no one usually sits outside. So this is not good for large groups unless you were to rent out the entire restaurant. This is ideal for a 2-3 person party maximum.  \n\nThe Wait: I have only gone for dinner during the weekdays and there is still always a wait (about 20-30 minutes).  My boyfriend and I try to go right after work so as not to wait too long.\n\nThe Food:  You really cannot go wrong with anything you order.  The sushi is fresh and the rolls are amazing. \n\nSince Domo is in the heart of Hayes Valley there are tons of things to do around there.  If there is a long wait you can go to Two Sisters Bar and Books around the corner, you can simply take a stroll in Hayes Valley.  You can also stop for a drink at Absinthe, the Sugar Lounge, wine tasting at Arelequin and if the beirgarden is open have a beer.  So many great things to do afterwards. \n\nThis is a great date spot and great spot to catch up with a girlfriend.", "author": "Vagabond V."}

The place seats about 18-20ish with customers eating on high chairs over counters.  Some face the chef and the sushi bar, others face the wall and/or the window.\n\nThe small crudos were a rip-off in my opinion--literally two spoonfuls for $5.95.  We ordered the scallop and ankimo.  For ankimo that size, it would probably have been more worth it to pay the $8 and get it as an appetizer.  Taste-wise, though, both dishes were fine.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try many of the fusion rolls, which judging from other reviewers seem to be a high point of this place, but we tried the sushi and sashimi.  The sunazuri (hamachi belly), which was a fantastic deal at $5.25 for two pieces, was light and clean.  The sake (salmon) was presented as a rose, which is a trend these days, and was smooth and buttery.  Unlike the sunazuri, though, it was nothing to write home about.  Then we tried the tazmanian trout, which was really something.  It was my first time having it and the taste, while similar to salmon, had a bit more texture.  Those who find salmon too 'slimy' might appreciate trout more.\n\nWe finished things off with a rock & roll but it was truly mediocre.  I've had rock & roll from a food court in Irvine l that was better than this.  If you want a really good rock & roll, go to Kirala in Berkeley.\n\nStill, the overall experience was pleasant.  My impression of Domo is that it's very affordable given the quality of food.  There isn't an extremely wide selection of fish or sake like there is at, say, Sushi Bistro, but they do have some stand-outs with the sunazuri and trout, which you may not necessarily get elsewhere.  They also have shiro maguro (albacore) which is also a delicacy that not all sushi bars may necessarily serve.  Plus the sake is a super good deal--nice 'small' bottle for $7!

Forget that it has 15 seats and doesn't take reservations--it's charming with specials handwritten on a mirror and cozy with views of either tree-lined Laguna Street or the sushi chefs hard at work.  The menu is big enough for classics and creativity, yet small enough to not be visually overwhelming. \n\nMy boyfriend let me take the reigns with ordering and, of course, I went crazy.  We began with uni (sea urchin) and ankimo (monkfish liver) crudo (two for $6).  They were beautifully presented on soup spoons, and I couldn't help but compare them to the Spoonfuls of Happiness at Koo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/koo-san-francisco).  Although the crudo here was delicate in flavor and rich in texture, the Spoonfuls of Happiness there were a foodgasm in my mouth.  We also had the dynamite mussels (two for $6)--these were hot, juicy, and flavorful, though I'm still more crazy about the baked mussels at Sushi Zone (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-zone-san-francisco).  \n\nA sushi bar is only as good as its cuts of sashimi, so we had to have some of my favorites: hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon) (5 pieces each for $10).  The hamachi was incredible--so fresh and so thick.  The sake would've been as enjoyable if it weren't so thin.  Where Domo shines, however, is the rolls.  We had the fire cracker balls ($10), the spider roll ($9), and the spicy hulk ($10).  The fire cracker balls were a flavor explosion (no pun intended)--crunchy and saucy with kick.  It was my pick of the three.  The spider was as good as any great one that I've had.  The parties on either side of us ordered the spicy hulk, so we did as well; the spicy tuna in it was delicious, but the ponzu sauce overpowered it sometimes. \n\nAlthough I've had better versions of the same things elsewhere, my collective experience at Domo was still nothing short of five stars.  Even with seven items, beer, and sake, the total bill was only $83 before tax and tip.  Yes, it isn't cheap but it's reasonable--the bites were well worth the dollars.\n\nThis was the perfect cap to our Sunday afternoon walk through Hayes Valley.  First, wine in the garden of Arlequin Cafe; next, macaroons at Chantal Guillon; then, we scored the last two open seats at Domo without having to wait.  Sometimes the best dates are the unplanned ones.", "author": "Liz T."}

Very nice staff and they are open to you making adjustments / substitutions to your roll. Prices are reasonable for the quality and hey, it's sushi, so you can expect to pay anywhere from $10 - $14 a roll. I got the Domo and Fire Cracker Ball rolls. They were really good.

So what I'm saying is, I'm measuring my success in high fives from locals.\n\nAside from that though, Domo just did everything right. I always grin on the inside when there's music I like in a restaurant, and I entered to A Tribe Called Quest. The mix only continued with more jazz-based hip-hop, then moved into some lighter folksy stuff as my time there progressed. If you're paying attention, I'm sold on the place and I haven't even ordered yet.\n\nI ended up getting the firecracker balls, and the real crab california rolls. That bit is important: real crab. Not enough places do this (read: almost none) and what you usually get is this semi-solid white and red piece wrapped in rice. That wasn't the case here, but I'll get to that later. Firecracker balls! Great stuff. I was really pleased with the flavor and texture. I should have ordered two, honestly.\n\nI had a bite of my friend's unagi which was also delicious, but then came these califonia rolls. Actual crab meat made such a difference in the flavor. I'm used to california rolls that taste like rice and cucumber, and whatever amount of soy sauce I mask it with. This had a prominent crab flavor and it was fresh. \n\nNot only that, but staff was attentive throughout the dining experience. No hovering, no abandonment, just careful observation. \n\nThe only thing I can't say is how lucky you'll be to get a seat. I was on vacation so I had the luxury of visiting in the afternoon. You may not be so lucky on a Friday night, for example. That's because it's a really small place. It's not cramped, but it's definitely suited for small parties.\n\nAll that said, Domo gets 5 stars.

As for any Hayes Valley residents, there are never a shortage of amazing places to dine just a reach away. Not to mention we are so close to the Mission.  But this place is just around the corner and we've unintentionally been ignoring it for a long time. Finally decided to give it a try and what a huge mistake! \n\nCalled them on our way in Sunday night, the hostess said the wait is around 15 minutes. We walked over and were there five minutes later. Turns out there are about 4 other couples ahead of us as well as a party of 5 (the place is tiny). \n\nWe put our name down. \nWe wait for about 45 minutes - the place has such poor ventilation that we both begin to get slightly barfy from the fumes of re-fried oil evaporating from their tiny kitchen. \n\nFinally we're being seated. Nobody takes our order for at least 15 minutes. The waiter doesn't even bother to give us a friendly smile or apologize for making us wait so long. \n\n30 minutes after we place our order, still no sign of food and not a single member of the er.. 2-member staff bothers to check on us. \n\nSo to sum it up:  arrived at 6:45PM, seated at 7:30PM, food arrives (but only after I lost my cool and yelled at the waitress) at 8:30PM - RIDICULOUS.  \n\nThe rolls and nigiri are just ok, nothing to write home about in the city filled with amazing sushi places.  We left very disappointed and upset. The silver lining was the waitress telling us as we were leaving that she likes some sushi place in the Castro where the wait is usually close to 2 hours but the food is so amazing it's worth it. Well. I couldn't care less where this waitress likes to eat her sushi and at Domo the mediocre food is most certainly not worth the long wait, the rude staff, horrible service and the nasty smell inside the restaurant.

It's nice to break away from traditional rice-based sushi to enjoy a set of different textures and tastes all at once. \n\nWe also had the domo roll, which is the restaurant's signature, but all in all, a mediocre warm cheese sushi. I think it was good partially because of the other rolls we had next to it.\n\nLastly, in order to have a bit of a traditional flavor, we went with the hamachi sashimi, which honestly was one of the best I had tried in a long time. Really fresh fish that could stand alone without the shoyu and the wasabi.

It was my first time in San Francisco and going out for sushi was something that he said we must do. We were trying to go to a different sushi place but since it was a Sunday that place was closed. We tried Domo instead.\n\nI enjoyed it. It is a really small place but we had no trouble getting sat by the bar seating in front of the kitchen. It is not that loud so you can actually carry on a conversation pretty easily. We watched the food being prepared while we waited for our order. At one point we had a few questions about a couple of items so the staff told us more about the items. It wasn't too pricey, but it wasn't cheap either. \n\nMy second time was on Memorial Day of 2014. After spending a few days in Humboldt, and then the ride back to SF, I had the afternoon free before my flight back to Chicago the next morning. I remembered how nice this place was the year before so instead of trying out a new place I just wanted to come back to Domo. I ordered a few things I had last time and an additional new item I have not tried. I came in by myself and sat in the same bar overlooking the kitchen. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Being there the second time a year later felt like the year before. Service was on point and everything was consistent.\n\nI do not like flashy restaurants, and some sushi places can be. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. My dinner here felt unrushed and enjoyable. I recommend this place if you are looking for fresh and outstanding sushi but also want to enjoy your dinner with a friend or you're just visiting from out of town.", "author": "Luke D."}

It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is always friendly and spot on. The specials never have let me down. They also let you do take out which is nice for those days you wanna grab a roll and eat at home. \n\nThe rolls are pricey but the quality is well worth it. Some of my favorite dishes include the Hawaiian Style Tuna Pok\u00e9, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Hulk and Fiesta.

This is a small courtesy that has a big impact, and it definitely influences my mood when my table is ready (as in, did I stand around making half-hearted chitchat for x minutes, or did I get to take a stroll and pop into a bar for a quick drink). Great start.\n\nSecond, the space is very cozy. Some would say small, which is true, but when it is small in a way that feels good, I go with cozy. The great part of a small joint is that the noise level is low, the service is very attentive, and it makes the whole experience feel very intimate (date night!). We sat at the bar facing the street, which I think is the superior spot since you get to people watch yet still have the warmth and comfort of sitting inside.\n\nThird, the food is delicious. We went to Domo because I was having a major tuna and avocado craving, so most of our rolls had those elements. Usually we try to get at least one new thing, and a mix of rolls and nigiri, but this time we focused in on tuna or avocado flavors and stuck with rolls. Our favorites of the night were the fiesta roll and the crunchy California roll. As for amount, we ordered 5 sets of rolls for two small/medium adult appetites, which was about 1 set too much. We also each had a beer.\n\nOverall, the whole experience at Domo was wonderful. We were treated well and enjoyed a delicious dinner, and we will surely be back.", "author": "Laura M."}

They brought out my entree first before the sashimi. Sashimi should've arrived first since it's the quicker of the 2 dishes to prepare. Salmon sashimi was fine. Came with 5 pieces for $11. Shrimp tempura was not good. I ate it because I was hungry and I don't like to waste food. But it wasn't until I reached the very last roll before I tasted bones and scales from the eel. I spat most of it out but ended up swallowing some. I've never seen scales or bones in a sushi roll before. Needless to say I will not be returning to patronize this place.", "author": "Max F."}

I like the fancy, over the top, unauthentic rolls with more ingredients than you can count, and this restaurant's namesake roll, the Domo Roll, fit the bill perfectly. It's got everything you might want in your sushi roll all mixed together: salmon, crab, scallops, avocado, spicy mayo, bbq unagi glaze, tobiko & scallions. It's visually appealing and extremely tasty. Oddly, the salmon on top is baked, not raw or smoked, which I was surprised to learn works well.\n\nI also tried one of the specials. I don't remember all the details, but it had a crunchy nutty exterior (crushed almonds perhaps?) and scallops inside. It was nearly as wonderful as the Domo roll. My boyfriend prefers the simple classics; he ordered a california roll and a tuna roll and he liked them both as well.\n\nI'm usually left wanting more after dining on sushi, but I was pretty stuffed after leaving Domo; both of my rolls were very filling.

My favorite seats are by the window, overlooking the street so you can people watch whilst enjoying your meal. The sushi/sashimi/maki menu seems a little limited as sushi restaurants go, but they have all the essentials. They also have a large non-sushi menu, for those of you who haven't given in to fully appreciating amazing cuisine that is sushi. They have rotating sushi + non-sushi specials, too. The one thing I can't go without on their menu, though, is the small crudos. Try them, they're amazing.\n\nThe waiter let us sit on Saturday around 9PM-ish, right as they seem to be closing the kitchen and sushi bar for the night (DISCLAIMER: Yelp says they're open until 10PM, but seems like they close much earlier on slow nights.) We knew exactly what we wanted, so it was all good! Thank you waiter sir, for not letting my sushi craving linger.\n\nThe one thing that score major points for me (outside of their name, good food and good service, obv): Domo is open more days of the week and later than *other* great sushi restaurants in the area.

It's a relatively small and modern restaurant, able to fit a maximum of 20 or so people. I was helping my friend move last weekend and for his last dinner before he moved we decided to hit up Domo. I really didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like I was going to say no to soooshi! :)\n \nBetween the two of us, we ordered:\n- Three bottles of Sake (http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/VENheXH8mYtgwPrFtMU_Ow/l)\n- Hamachi and Toro Sashimi (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/GT2ksGp2QBhJO19j-w3G-g/l)\n- Domo Roll (http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/XByYhTTvoVewW3nd25g0MA/l)\n- Crunchy California Roll (http://static3.px.yelp.com/bphoto/MzHL9-eDlchb7xxBK5oWvA/l)\n- Omega Roll (http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OgLyxt4lFEaGnlsIgFvTfg/l)\n \nHamachi Sashimi (3.5 Stars): Fresh Yellowtail, one of my favorites to order.  Not the best I've had, but still quite good and tasty.\n \nToro Sashimi (5 Stars): My other favorite, the Fatty Tuna that was extremely stimulating and scrumptious.  When I devoured the first piece I instantly fell in love.  It seriously just melted in my mouth.  One of the best sashimis I've had in quite a while. I highly recommend this for any sashimi lovers out there!\n \nCrunchy California Roll (5 Stars): Tempura Battered California Roll with spicy mayo, unagi sauce, scallions, & tobiko.  Out of the three rolls we had, this was my favorite.  Again, I am a sucker for fried rolls, so I am a bit biased.  The crunchy tempura layer is what does it for me, so exceptional!\n\nDomo Roll (4.5 Stars): Baked California Roll topped with salmon & scallops with spicy mayo, unagi sauce, and tobiko & scallions. This roll was a close second in terms of what I liked between the three rolls we ordered. Full of flavor and packs quite a tasty punch!\n \nOmega Roll (4 Stars): This was on their special menu written on the mirror.  Our waitress informed us the specials rolls and what they contained, and I didn't catch everything she said.  I do remember it having shrimp, mango, and macadamia nuts.  This roll was quite refreshing and luscious.\n \nSake - Cream de Sake (5 Stars): This is my first experience of having unfiltered sake and my only question is, why have I never had this before? OMG, it was so good! It looks real creamy and milky like, and tasted so smooth and sweet.  I think I will start ordering unfiltered sake from now on! :)\n\nSummary (5 Stars): A true hidden gem! They have Toro Sashimi to die for, as well as highly addictive and delicious rolls. It all goes so well with their Cream de Sake!

The biggest problem I have with Domo is that things are not quite as they describe on the menu.  Perhaps I'm a bit picky, but if a place is going to offer specialty rolls and go to the bother of listing all the ingredients in those rolls, I expect the finished result to match up.  The changes they make on the fly are not trivial... for example, crab which was not in the description, or substituting tuna/salmon interchangeably.  That radically changes a roll, to me.  (I'm not *just* picky - I have really bad food allergies - so essentially they've made my meals inedible).  \n\nIf friends insist on going, I'll tag along and stick to sashimi or nigiri, hard to screw up.

But, I decided to try something new and ordered the Spicy Hulk roll ($9.50) and on my friends recommendation, the Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll ($11). We were told the wait was 20 mins so we went to grab a drink but when we came back they had already called our names so we told the guy and he signed us up for the next spot. We were seated another 20 mins later and skimmed through the menu before deciding on the above plus the Sweet Potato roll ($4) and the Salmon Avocado roll ($6.50 I think). The crunchy roll was just about the best thing I've ever tasted. It had cooked tuna which resembled meat loaf, avocado, tobiko and spicy mayo and then the whole thing was battered and fried. I don't really enjoy spicy food but this was nice and complemented the other flavors well. The Spicy Hulk roll was tuna mashed up (looked like ground beef), avocado, a tiny bit of tobiko and all wrapped up by a piece of cucumber in a spicy sauce that was like lemony soy sauce (ponzu?). I didn't like this at all...the texture freaked me out and I felt like I was eating cat food. It also might have been less enjoyable because I had it after the Crunchy roll. I didn't eat the sweet potato or salmon and avocado rolls, but my friend really enjoyed them, especially the sweet potato roll. I'm so happy I came here and went the adventurous route; I would've completely missed out had I not! The only thing I have to complain about is the size.

The sushi is innovative and interesting. The rolls are unlike other ones I've had. The Domo roll was baked and tender. The crunchy spicy tuna was not that crunchy, but had a thick layer of tempura batter, which was even more exaggerated because it was sliced diagonally. The kobe beef roll was delicious and juicy. The beef was sliced incredibly thin and it was really tender. The avocado and asparagus inside was good. Same with the cucumber roll, good use of a different type of wrap than the usual nori.

Well, that's true, but I stil think you should not discover this place. It's mine now! =) I actually am planning to come back more frequently.\n\nSo, I just wrote a review recently, but my previous trip this weekend trumps my first visit. Ryo is quite superb at executing an exquisite looking and tasting dish. All the flavors meld and sing together. When I came this time, I merely asked him to make me dishes he felt like creating. Therefore, all the dishes I had this time were off-menu. \n\nFor starters, credos! The first one was quail egg, salmon roe, salmon, and shiso. Heaven in a spoon! The second type was avocado, uni, and a touch of sea salt. mmm....\n\nOur salad course was comprised of daikon, arugula, and flash fried baby aji. It was perfectly light and the fish were amazing. I don't just trust anyone serving me whole fish, but I will here.\n\nThe next dish was too amazing for words: avocado, thin slice of grilled kobe beef, topped with uni. Each bite just melted in your mouth. I kept waiting to eat another bite or taking a sip of water because I wanted to savor every delicious bite. \n\nOur final dish was a similar to a crab cake, but it was made from mussels and served in the shell. They were perfectly baked and tasted delicious. Each bite was warm and filling. \n\nSo, here's the deal. Come to domo, befriend Ryo and let him get to know you. After you know him, let him make you food. Although everything on the menu is great in and of itself, the true genius of this chef shines when he was the free reign to create masterpieces with the freshest ingredients he has in his kitchen. \n\nRyo, arigato gozaimashita~", "author": "Brent A."}

It's easy to sit at the bar and engage him in conversation while he prepares you some delicious sushi.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful with the menu. \n\nI like to recommend Domo as a good date place, especially for dates #1-4.  It's small and intimate with soft lighting, so everyone looks pretty good and you don't have to yell to communicate.  The seating is all counter style so you sit next to one another which can work when you're too nervous or don't want to be forced to face each other, or, when you want to be able to lean in closer or even have a reason to \"accidentally\" touch.  Finally, it's sushi.  For those fortunate enough to be on a date with someone who likes sushi, it's perfect date food, light, yet filling, allows you to show off your cultured palate and the dinner can be as long or as short as you can handle.  And to help you seal the deal, you can try going off the beaten path from the menu and order dinner from Ryo, omakase (chef's choice).\n\nWhile they don't have a \"kitchen\", there are some excellent dishes besides sushi/sashimi that are unique to Domo.  Try any of their Crudos; the Ankimo, monkfish liver pate, is made in-house, fresh, and is great for those who enjoy foie gras or duck liver pate.  The Daikon Salad, served with arugula and bonito shavings; light and refreshing while anchored with the earthy bitterness of the arugula and the delicate saltiness of the bonito and drizzled with a house dressing.  Iidako, deep-fried baby octopus served with a spicy dipping sauce, takes the pedestrian calamari to a different level.  One of my go-to favorites, and highly overlooked, is the Hamachi Kama.  The kama is the jaw or cheek of the Yellowfin Tuna that they broil and serve with lemon and a light soy or temari sauce.  It's always cooked perfectly tender and completely satisfying.  Try the Fish Tacos.  It's a creative take on mexican tacos using deep-fried nori as the shell, filled with a couple different fish and avocado and topped with a house-made salsa.   And finally, while I am not a roll girl, I would recommend trying the Crunchy California Roll, which is a tempura-style deep-fried roll, the Domo Roll, which is a really luxurious baked roll topped with scallop and sauces, and the Jalapeno Hamachi,not nearly as big or as fancy as the previous two, but the juxtaposition of the sweet, soft hamachi with the crunchy, crisp, sometimes spicy jalapeno and sea salt is one that I often crave.", "author": "Shirley T."}

This was a major bonus given that the entire time we were dining, there were parties of two waiting.\n\nMy GF and I split a few items.  I thought the standouts were the firecracker balls and the hamachi sashimi, which was cut nice and thick so you could really get a good bite.  The fish tacos were good too.\n\nSo why isn't this a 4 or 5 star review?  The service was pretty bad.  Although the server was prompt in taking our order and bringing out the firecracker balls and sashimi, there were long delays in getting our other dishes.  In fact, the server clearly forgot about us and had to come by and ask if we were waiting on anything else.  At that time, we told him we never received our appetizers and one other dish.  A bit of a cluster fuck.  Maybe it was just b/c they were busy but you would think that checking up on your customers and delivering the food that has been ordered is pretty standard operations.

All customers were there in pairs or maybe threes, but the noise level was wonderfully low.  Also, the super cool drum-n-chill music (not too loud either) plus the low lighting and the wood decor, it all helps a lot to make this an imtimate place for enjoying food.\n\nOften at sushi places the staff are super hectic, but not here - lots of smiles and time for you.  Congrats for that.\n\nFood: The first time I had the Tak\u00e9, and absolutley loved the balance between the raw fish and the greens.  The second time I started with the fish taco (4 stars) and then a chalkboard special: fried octopus - awesome!!!   A  I didn't try any rolls in my two visits, but they sure looked interesting as well.\n\nPlease note that i am giving it five stars for totally achieveing what this place is trying to do:  if you want a super romantic place or somewhere to show off, this is not the place.

The Ankimo appetizer needed a touch of Japanese sea salt, didn't taste seasoned enough although the thinly sliced cucumber added a perfect crunch. The Wagyu Beef roll needs a little less avocado and the meat seemed a little on the tougher side - maybe add some crab in the middle and call it surf n turf. The Tacos were surprisingly good, crunchy with great flavors and the salmon was cooked perfect. The Fiesta Roll was refreshing and a interesting take on Mexican-Japanese fusion. Had 2 orders of the Yellow fin Belly, sooooo good. The Butterfish nigiri was super fresh. Sushi is all about the rice and I forget how good it is made here. Keep up the good work Domo. \n\nAtmosphere: Tiny but they have outdoor seating and usually doesn't take that long on weekdays. Farely Hip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-17", "description": "The first time I ate at Domo, I did something so terrible that I thought the sushi was \"two star - meh - I've experienced better\" as a result of my deservedly bad karma.\n\nThere aren't a lot of sushi restaurants in Hayes Valley and Domo had just opened and everyone was saying great things about it and everyone wanted to eat there, so everyone was standing outside waiting for a seat.  We put our name on the list and joined the crowd on the sidewalk.  It was cold and windy and the sun hadn't even gone down yet.  By the time it did, I was starving AND freezing.  I can deal with starving better than freezing.  \n\nFinally the hostess came out and called a name. It was the name of my dining companion, but it's a common first name.  We'd been there awhile, but not long enough for her to be calling us at that point.  She was calling someone else with the same name.  She called out a second time.  No one moved.  We looked at each other and both got up and walk to the hostess for 'our' seats.  \n\nHere's how karma kicked my self-entitled ass.  First, the seats that we just jumped ended up being outside (where it had not gotten any less cold or windy.)  Then, in the interest of this being a useful review, the nigiri was small and not very fresh and the rolls were bland.  Domo is a sushi restaurant that's open on Mondays if that tells you anything.  It wasn't exactly bad (no one got sick later), but the color and texture were off and there are tons of sushi restaurants all over SF that are a lot better for the same price. Since 'everyone' was still raving about Domo a year later, we gave it another shot.  We didn't jump in line this time, but it was still cold and the sushi wasn't any better either. \n\nAt least it'll be warm when I get to hell.\n\n***To be clear, this is a 2 star review of the sushi, not SF weather.", "author": "P J."}

So its great for a date. All the seats are bar style around the window and counter. I'm guessing maybe 14 people can fit in here at one time...max. the atmoshpere is energetic but quiet because there are a lot of people in  small space. the service is good too. we sat down less than 5 minuets afer walking in and sat in a little edge on the wall. i think we were both blocking someones  chair but nobody was going any where and we would have gladly moved for someone to exit.  the timing is a little off but the food made up for it. we got our edamame right before the first roll so we didnt have time to enjoy it before we dug into the main event. from there the domo roll took a little long to get out but then again it was cooked may have needed a little more love than the other rolls. \n\nWe ordered the Temptation, Domo, Kobe Beef, and Chef's choice Sashimi\n\nTemptation: everything i always want in one roll!!! i love it! it was pretty small. about 6 pieces but it was delicious!\n\nSashimi: well it was fresh and it was good but there were only two pieces of each type of fish so it wasnt very satisfying. and i have had fresher sashimi before but that doesnt mean theres wasnt spot on good. \n\nDomo: Took a little longer to come out. Just the right amount of spicey mayo. I love the baked rolls and the presentation was the best ive probably seen in a baked roll.\n \nKobe Beef:  while everything was super great and yummy we werent quite full yet so we decided to order one more roll. No rice, just steak. Thats just about as americanized sushi can get. it was soo good but i doubt i would get it again. it was nice to try.\n\noverall a great experience.", "author": "Ashley H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-07", "description": "I think Domo served some of the best non-authentic \"fun\" sushi I've had in San Francisco!  One thing I always complain about is how San Francisco lacks good sushi.  I'm talking about delicious L.A.-style sushi.  You know, the trendy, fun sushi that you eat at Katsuya while people-watching.  For me, Domo served this purpose... except without the celebrities and celebutantes... \n\nIt was a Saturday night and we had made dinner reservations at a different place in Hayes Valley and were STARVING.  To our dismay, we learned out our table would not be ready for awhile since other diners were lagging, so we decided to walk around Hayes Valley.  I wasn't even craving sushi at the time, but saw Domo and instantly started to think about how delicious it could be.  We put our names on the list and - lucky us! - were able to get seats at the inside bar area within a few minutes!\n\nPlease note that I can't speak to the quality of the sashimi or nigiri because we were STARVING so we just shared rolls (more bang for our buck), but the rolls are outstanding if you are in the mood for that!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nFirecracker balls: 5/5 REaLLy tasty!  Don't expect to really taste the fish and to love the firecracker balls as sushi, but still expect to love them.  They're SO flavorful!  And deliciously spicy.  No wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nSpicy hulk:  5/5 One thing Domo does REALLY well is its spicy tuna!  Get as much of it as you can!  I usually don't like rolls wrapped in cucumber rather than rice, but the spicy hulk was SO good!  Again, perfectly spicy and tasty - no wasabi or soy sauce needed.\n\nCrunchy spicy tuna: 4.5/5 Also delicious, again because of the outstanding spicy tuna.  Would definitely get this again.\n\nJalapeno hamachi: 3/5 Decent.  We didn't love it, but it was still decent.  The chunks of jalapeno were a bit much, I thought.  My eyes started to water a bit.  I wouldn't get this roll again.\n\nFiesta: 1/5  Yuck.  I guess I don't like mango pieces in rolls.  It tasted a bit disturbing with the fish and I ended up pulling the mango pieces out in the end and dousing this roll with soy sauce and wasabi.  Definitely would not get this again.\n\nFish taco appetizer:  This dish gets probs for how creatively it is put together.  The taco \"shell\" is made of seaweed and tempura batter.  I am going to refrain from giving this a rating since I HATE salmon and didn't realize, in our ordering frenzy (don't judge me), that there was salmon in here.  My dinner companion liked this, though, and he's a salmon fan.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Domo.  We shared a bottle of unfiltered sake, which made for a fun evening:)  \n\nJust a tip:  I don't recommend coming here if you have more than 2 people because I think it's pretty hard to get a table.

In a restaurant the size of most people's studio apartments with seating for about 15 patrons, you don't get more imposed exclusivity than that. It melts hearts, I tell you! And Domo definitely is a great first date dinner for a more adventurous couple of first daters. \n\nI stand by my 4-stars. My date and I found the portions of the dishes adequate for sharing (as most sushi over the one-roll limit is). The wakame/seaweed salad was moist and the right amount of sesame seeds. The Spider roll was just this side of crunchy with the required bits of crab leg sticking out (I'm not a fan; it's not a tempura shrimp roll, mkay?). The Kobe beef roll was great in theory, but I found the beef to be a little too chewy. The sauce was stunning, however.\n\nIt's good to see a Japanese restaurant whose sushi DOES come with a measured serving of eel sauce (the sweet black sauce, for those not in the know). It's a secret weapon that I use for all my sushi requests that brings out flavor in the most interesting ways.\n\nI'm also a HUGE fan of the FIrecracker balls. They are unusual enough to warrant their own review. Tasty, meaty, moderately heavy on the hot/spicy.\n\nIn sum, one doesn't come to Domo for an ultra-mod, stylish ambiance or sultry people-watching. One comes for oishi (yummy) sushi, no-frills service, and the satisfaction of being in a restaurant before the dinner crush and not having to wait over an hour to be seated. :)", "author": "C. P."}

I could honestly eat it for every meal, or just all the time without even stopping. But then I'd be broke. It doesn't help that Domo is literally three blocks from my apartment.\n\nI dropped by here with a friend the other night since we've been trying out a lot of the places in Hayes Valley we've never been to. Figured that (A) they have a lot of good reviews, and (B) their menu isn't insanely expensive like some places (i.e. Blue Fin). Both points are pretty spot on.\n\nBe warned, Domo is a sushi BAR, not a restaurant; there's enough seating for maybe 15-20 people at most, making it a pretty tight squeeze if you're looking to bring friends. The atmosphere is both modern and intimate, so it'd make a nice little dinner-date location if anything. My friend and I arrived a little after they opened for dinner (5:30P) and by the time we left (6:20P) the place was already filling up.\n\nFood-wise the sushi is incredibly flavorful and fresh. The two of us split a few special rolls (Spicy Hulk, Firecracker Balls) and I had tried some nigiri (albacore, hamachi), and all of it was good. The portions felt a bit small for the cost though, so don't expect to be stuffed unless you're prepared to pay a pretty penny. Still, the quality is of a much higher caliber than many other sushi places I've been to. Domo also has lunch specials, which I'm eager to try.\n\nOverall, Domo is a pleasant, quaint little sushi bar that deserves the (current) 4-star rating on Yelp. There aren't many negatives to it other than its size (but come on, you can't entirely fault them for that) and perhaps the price-to-portion ratio, and it's worth repeated trips especially if you live in the area.

You don't have to read any further, because it'll just get more boring, and I've had a run of long reviews lately.  But if you insist....\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYesterday was my last day of rotation #9 (yay, me) and my most annoying Caucasian brother (his words, not mine) was in town.  Because I did not have any more assignments to do, nor did I have to wake up this morning at the butt crack of dawn, I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically agreed to meet him in the city for dinner.  However, this involved getting to the city from Napa at rush hour - I kept hitting stupid traffic...bay bridge traffic started way back in El Cerrito...and then again at the Octavia St exit.  And then when I *finally* made it to Hayes Valley, there was no parking AND stupid-ass drivers kept blocking the roads.  To top it all off, I had drunk a gallon of coffee at work, and didn't pee before I left Napa.  This equaled a miserable Kerrie L.\n\nAfter I *finally* found parking, my friend, his friend, and I went into Domo...where a table for three was miraculously waiting for us.  (I made a bee-line for the bathroom, which was nice, by the way.)  So...apparently, we're all pretty loquacious, which meant we weren't in a big hurry to look at the menu.  We pretty much made our decisions while the server was there, taking a little more of their time than they had wanted, I'm sure.  So - their patience was a high point.\n\nWhen I finally got around to looking at the menu, my first thought was, \"JIVE ASS.\"  Firecracker Balls, Spicy Hulk, Sexy Mama???  What would Nobu think? :(  I told my companions that I could go for anything...anything except uni and monkfish liver.  Because...well...EW.\n\nBut as the night went on, and I drank more sake, I learned to accept the jive ass...even encouraging another order of the Fish Tacos.  Everything was fresh, flavors were strong, and of course, the presentation was very nice.  Finally, one of us dropped out and said he was done, but being the troopers we were, the \"bro\" and I decided to go for one last dish.  And because I was in such a great mood, I agreed to try an order of UNI and MONKFISH LIVER (you pick two items from the \"small crudos\" section of the menu).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "My number 1 sushi spot to go to in the Bay Area.  Reasonably priced and good quality fish.\n\nBest thing about this place is the chill and relaxed vibe and the head chef/manager Ryo.  I've become a regular here and he definitely knows his fish and his technique is impeccable.  Sit at the bar, order from him and he'll take care of you.\n\nFor me a sign of a good chef is one that's constantly tasting his food, making sure that it's up to his standards of taste and quality.  I've had the pleasure of sitting in front of the sushi bar and watching Ryo break down the complicated structure of a flying fish, all the while tasting different cuts and making sure they were excellent. Over the next few weeks he refined his marinade and cure for his flying fish to the point that he really brought out its beautiful flavors without sacrificing the fish's great texture.\n\nIt's a common misconception that sushi is the freshest fish available when in fact most sushi is aged, marinated, or cured for a few days before serving.  There in lies some of the art to great sushi, and at Domo, Ryo knows how to treat the fish he gets.  I'm a sushi purist.  Give me your nigiri, give me your sashimi.  I don't really care for sushi rolls but I've had them and they don't disappoint either.  Before Domo I used to HATE mackerel.  At other sushi places, the fishiness of mackerel would be overpowering.  At Domo, Ryo prepares his mackerel carefully and in small batches and the outcome is a fresh fish taste and texture.  I love the mackerel at Domo, and I believe that he elevates all of the other fish he receives to a higher degree than most other sushi spots at the same price point.  Along those same lines, a sign of a really good chef is consistency. If I like a restaurant, I'll always return a few times, and when it comes to sushi I'll invariably have bad visits - times when I'll find a bone in my sushi or the fish won't be up to par.  This hasn't been the case at Domo.  I've been several times and it's always been wonderful.\n\nMy faves on the menu:\nFish Tacos - Love the tempura fried nori.  I always ask him to go light on the salsa.\n\nSea urchin crudo - He pairs his urchin with avocado, and it reinforces the butteryness of the urchin while mellowing out the oceany flavor.\n\nAnkimo (monk fish liver) crudo - a simple presentation and take on ankimo and it's really good.\n\nSake toro (salmon belly)\nSunazuri (hamachi belly)\nRyo has a great way of balancing out the fattyness of these cuts with something bright and refreshing be it a thin, thin slice of kumquat or some pickled ginger.\n\nAnd again, ask him for what he's got and what's \"fresh\" Ryo is great at showcasing some of his fresh batches and what's in season.  Some of my faves off-menu have been:\n\nFlying fish - great texture and mild flavor\nHalf Beak - a firmer, smoother texture than most fish but delicious\nWalu (butterfish) - cured well with an almost sweet/buttery flavor\nBlack Snapper\nRed Snapper\n\nCome to Domo, sit at the bar, order sushi, and enjoy - rinse, wash and repeat.  You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Rodney A."}

Sushi spot next to Patxi's, closed at 10, Patxi's closed at 10:30 and we walked in at 10:32, Flipper's Burgers closed at 10. It was one of those nights, until we walked a few blocks up the street and found Domo. It was about 10:40 and we could tell they all wanted to close up shop and go home (or to the bar more likely for some beverages and fun) but they were really cool about it. We sat down, ordered quickly and the food came out really fast. Miso soup was very tasty, sea weed salad was fresh and also very good. Then we started to get to the meat and potatoes, or freshly sliced fish and rice in this case. The Hamachi carpaccio was pretty good. It could have been seared less b/c it was a little more cooked than I liked, but hey, might plate was clean so who I am to nit pick we had another roll (forget the name) that was very fresh and really clean. And the academy award goes to..... FIRE CRACKER BALLS!! Let me tell you, we had no idea that this was the best dish in the house and somehow we managed to save it for the finale and hot damn it was so good!!!! A slightly crunchy texture, very fresh tuna and the unagi sauce was money MONEY!!!!! \n\nNot only was the food good but they stay open til 11 and didn't have a problem serving us just before closing, which really made our night b/c we were starving!!

A good trick to avoid waiting for 30minutes is to call as you're heading out and ask for your name to be put on the list; it's not a reservation but they will gladly do it and by the time you arrive, you only have a few minutes to wait. This time, we were seated upon arrival.\n\nThe food is fantastic, as I've said. This time we had the Kobe beef roll, the IC, and Domo, the Shiitake (only place that does this really well) and soup and edamame. The IC was a special roll and I believe last time we ordered a special too, so I would suggest checking out the list on the mirror. The Domo roll is hot and sooooooo yummy. It's like melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The Kobe also had great flavor and I've definitely never seen beef in a sushi roll but it was wonderful. \n\nI mean seriously, this place is really really good.

Last night my date and I arrived around 8:00 at the restaurant, put our name on the sign-in sheet, and proceeded to wait for our table. After a while I noticed that the round table in the corner was set but had been unoccupied for a good 10-15 minutes. I went in and asked how much longer the wait would be (we were the next on the list). The waitress looked around and said it could be up to 20 more minutes. When I asked about the table in the corner she told us that they would only seat a group of 3 there. When I asked if a group of 3 was waiting or if they were expecting anyone, her response was \"no, but you never know.\" Now, there were several groups of two waiting, and at this point we had been waiting for nearly an hour. So if a group of 3 happened to show up, they get to basically skip the line and get seated right away? This doesn't make much sense to me and really pissed me off as a loyal, paying customer. In the end we did get sat (only once a group of two vacated seats at the bar) and enjoyed the food, but the waiting experience really ruined it for me. Bottom line - if you have customers waiting - seat them. If a group of three happens to come along they can wait their turn like the rest of us. In the end, we were there til almost closing and a group of 3 never showed up. So no extra revenue for them, and they are now losing a loyal customer.", "author": "Dan S."}

But not so much the hangover this morning...\n\nThis place is tiny. It really doesn't suit large parties of people. Four of us showed up and we had a seriously long wait to get a seat along the wall (when I say along the wall, thats really the only option bar one table in the corner). Seeing as the couple occupying our space were on the way to an adventure of the horizontal sorts, it took some time to get us seated. On the upside however, the waiter was clearly embarrassed to have us waiting on the side. I like it when I see that people really care about me and my feelings. \n\nSo once we were seated, we got to the menu. We ordered (along with a nice ginjo): \n\nsalmon and spicy tuna crudos - tuna - very spicy. Its the first time my food has been served in a soup spoon... and I feel like I have gone up the world\nfirecracker balls - delicious and worth every rave review\nsexy mama - I love any roll that uses lemon. This one did not see me wrong\ndragon - its a dragon roll. You can't go wrong really. \njalapeno hamachi - 3/4 members of the party gagged on the power of the chilli. I, however thought that the flavour of the hamachi and the jalapeno worked really well together. For me, a win! And I got the last one as a result :)\nfiesta (special) - this was delicious. Mango, shrimp, roe... and other stuff. It is a party in your mouth. \nwasabi peas - enough wasabi for flavour, but it wasn't overpowering\nedamame - good edamame. Nice edamame. Still crunchy and flavourful\n\nAll in all, there wasn't a single part of the meal that I didn't enjoy and for that I have to give it the full five. It was definitely well worth the wait. I just wish it was a little bit larger.

The albacore tuna nigiri was also dollhouse size, miniature (looking at the posted images ... our portions were no where near what is shown).\n\nTo add, it was pathetic how they, a Japanese restaurant, could run out of hot sake.

I don't even remember what I had but it was good.  Firecracker balls were spicy but not overly which is good for me.  And the fried CA roll was a nice twist, not the first time I'd seen it but it was yummy nevertheless.\n\nService is good, and people watching from the window always makes good dinner conversation.", "author": "Denise B."}

Domo's food is so unique and artistic that it is an experience to remember. From freshness to flavor, texture, creativity, everything about their dishes are really executed well. Each plate I tried did not disappoint. The only thing I could possibly complain about are the portions which are on the tapas / smaller end. The place is very small so seating is hard to get especially in prime time.", "author": "Ed L."}

My S.O. and I planned to attend a party in Hayes Valley last night, and I asked a friend for places to eat dinner before the party in the neighborhood. She recommended Domo b/c her husband had eaten there before. Sold! This was the perfect spot for my \"congratulations-on-finally-getting-a-job-as-a-librarian\" dinner with my S.O.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 PM, put our names down, and only had to wait about 15 min. And those 15 min. passed quickly thanks to the cold unfiltered sake that we shared while waiting.\n\nWe were seated in the corner along the window, which was a great experience. I don't know about you, but it's rare that my S.O. and I sit next to each other while dining, unless we're eating on the couch and watching TV together. I would definitely recommend Domo for couples and not larger dinner parties, as it would be difficult for more people to talk at the counter together. There is only one round table in the corner, and all of the other seats are along counters or the sushi bar.\n\nHere's what we ate:\n- edamame\n- salmon nigiri\n- hamachi nigiri\n- ikura nigiri\n- sweet potato roll\n- rock & roll\n- spicy tuna\n- and a small bottle of inexpensive cold sweet unfiltered sake\n\nAll I can say is Wow. The fish melted in our mouths. My S.O. usually measures sushi restaurants by the quality of their ikura, and so we've sampled it at a lot of different places. The ikura here was by far the best I've ever had. Clearly fresh, it lacked the fishy taste that we've experienced at other restaurants. I measure sushi restaurants by their spicy tuna, and while the taste wasn't exactly the same as my favorite place in Boston, Domo's was good in its own right. Fresh fish, spicy!, and crispy cucumber all did a little dance in my mouth. Best of all, we we were both surprised that the total bill wasn't more expensive. No, please don't raise your prices or shrink your portions!\n\nI wish I could give Domo 4.5 stars. It doesn't earn a complete 5 because it took about 10 minutes for our server to take our order. Also, it took us about 35 minutes to find parking, but I guess that's expected on a Saturday night in Hayes Valley, so I don't really fault Domo for that.\n\nWe'll definitely be back for an intimate evening at Domo. There's a lot of charm and delicious food packed into a small space.", "author": "Wendy K."}

Too good since they are a block from my apartment. Too bad, they opened right before I moved to New York.. nevertheless, I had 3 glorious back to back occasions of eating here before I left.\n\nThe ambiance is great - it's small, but packed. Great deep house music on the set. If you are by yourself, try one of the seats facing the sushi bar : the owner will chat up with you. If you are in a drama mood or with some chick - take the Laguna facing seat. The windows are large and look right towards Moby Toby. The food is excellent - the toro will melt in your mouth.. the miso is tasty and the rolls are not just great, but extremely fresh and filling. The rainbow roll had 8 peices.. all fresh. Prices are quite economical. If you were looking for a sushi place in Hayes Valley and Sebo didn't cut it -- you are in luck with Domo.", "author": "Sav B."}

The bartender hears us discussing the different dinner options in the Hayes Valley vicinity and downloads a 20 minute diatribe on how AMAZING Sebo is and how we HAVE to go there NOW and enjoy the Sunday small plates, blah blah blah.  So SO and I get all excited and race home and run over to SEBO and guess what, it's closed!  Yayyy for private events, yayyyyyy!  \n\nSo now we have no choice, I mean we're on a sushi mission and if we don't eat it we will just DIE.  We hop on over to Domo and grab two seats at the bar.  We are excited to nosh at this place cause every other time we'd walked by the lines had been out the door and it has been crammed full of people. \n\nWe started out with the seaweed salad, very yummy!  The really big surprise, however, was the two crudos for $5.95.  I got the uni and the scallop, they both come sitting in their own spoon. with tasty accoutrements, WOOOWWWEEEZOOOWEEEE.  Seriously good people, wow. \n\nWe followed these tasty treats off with a spicy tuna roll and a spider roll.  My spider roll was still warm from the sprimp being fried and the uni was magnificent.  Seriously, I'm leaning towards five stars on this one! \n\nThe only set back was the fact that we found most everything to be a little too salty.  I mean, salt is sooo yummy that it was almost good salty...is that a weird comment?  Anywho, I will return again FOR SURE and give it another go.

The place probably sits 15 people at two bars and a table.  \n\nI've been dying to find a good sushi place in SF; I've been so surprised that the sushi here doesn't stack up to what I became used to in Seattle.  Domo might fit the bill.  The menu, like the space, is small, but if the fish is good there really isn't a need to get all fancy-pants.\n\nMiso:  I've found that miso usually a good indicator of the meal to come.  Theirs was really quite good.  Not tons of tofu (which is good in my book) and the broth was fantastic.  Not watery, just light and flavorful.\n\nAlbacore Tataki:  Lovely seared pieces of fantastic steak-like fresh albacore.  The sauce was a tiny bit bland, but it was hardly needed since the fish was so good.\n\nUnagi Nigiri:  Thank you for serving pieces of nigiri I can fit in my mouth in one go!  I'm so sick of places serving humongous \"mouthfuls\" that wind up as messy pieces on my plate.   The perfectly cooked and tender eel rested on just the right amount of rice to make the bite sing.\n\nRolls:  I think we had a rock 'n roll (unagi) and one other with tempura shrimp.  The unagi one was a bit bland (surprising considering the Nirgiri was so good) and the tempura was fantastic, but really, can you go too far wrong with something deep fried?  I think not.  Again, well put together and the pieces were not too big.\n\nService:  The waiter hadn't tried everything on the menu yet so had a couple \"I don't know\" moments.  We did go without our water filled for the last half of the meal, but I think all this is pretty excusable for day two.\n\nAll this with a bottle of Nigori sake - yum yum.  Still, maybe not as great as my favorite spots in the hometown, but definitely catching up!\n\nI can't rate higher just because I didn't get more Nigiri or any Sashimi to REALLY test out the freshness.  Just wasn't in the mood.  The real test will be next time I'm feeling like ODing on raw fish.  Then I'm all over this place.", "author": "Pamela J."}

I was in class 8 hours a day, and that particular day, I'd been in class for 9 hours.  There was just no end in sight.  There was no stopping the relentless beating that accompanied my chosen path.  And to top it all off, my BF was having an anti-going-out-to-eat phase.  I hate it when he does that.  \n\nIn a daze, I somehow stumbled off the bus at the requisite stop.  I wandered down Laguna looking for the same blue and white scheme as on Domo's website.  Well, don't because that's not what's out front.  It's a tiny red neon sign in slightly psycho-killer handwriting \"domo.\"  Inside, it was lines with high, bar-bistro height seating, at the sushi bar and then wrapped around the perimeter.  In one cozy corner was an equally high bistro-height table with some chairs.  \n\nI looked at the menu.  I looked for a server.  I shyly asked if they did takeout.  The guy looks at me, I look at him.  We had an understanding.  A spark.  I order the hamachi, the uni, amaebi, sake, and the ankimo appetizer (very good value).  It was about a tray's worth.  It included the fried shrimp heads.  and it cost $33.  I scarfed that tray down and nearly licked the grooved plastic.  \n\nOn the taste and freshness:\nFreshness - not bad.  Nothing suspicious or smelly about it.  The things were tender.  The hamachi was a strange color though, it looked more like kampachi and not hamachi.  It was not as fragrant as hamachi usually is.  I'll let this one slide and say that the sushi chef misunderstood.  \nTaste - also not bad.  Not as fragrant as it could possibly be.  The uni, while not offensive, did not have that sweet, briny, ocean taste.  Usually, uni makes my heart sing and my spirit fly.  This time, my heart merely whistled \"Dixie\" and my spirit leaned over the edge of the Titanic.  \n\nPortions were smallish.  The rice was small (but I like that), however, the fish was not as mouth-full-of-feel as I would have liked it.

Definitely a sushi place that prides itself and knowing its fare and keeping their customer happy.  They are driven to please you, whatever you want, you can have...but some say otherwise. So I'm not sure how open they are to suggestions (what you don't like, or; what you do like) and having them create something special for you.  However, the service is always great, the atmosphere is serene for a date or with a couple friends (this place is TINY, so not good for more than 2 people).\n\ni highly suggest ordering the butter fish sashimi which is not on the paper menu, but you'll find it on the hard-to-read mirror menu on the northern wall of the restaurant.  it is one of the few sushi places (that I know) whic carry this fish and the only place I will order it.  always a slight cool and definitely fresh, i sometimes have three orders.\n\nas for their rolls, always go from the cucumber wrapped spicy tuna (Spicy Hulk) and the soy sauce they use just makes it much more enjoyable and my brother's favorite; the (light) deep fried firecracker balls.  they are always an order for me each time i go, so good and bite size.  i've also had the opportunity to try to domo roll with friends, while delicious, i always tend to go for the mercury laden tuna in my rolls.  i'll never learn (maybe when my fingers begin to curl into my palms) then I'll learn.\n\nthe ambiance is always on the quite side since it is a smaller venue, the lighting always dim and the seating mostly bar or window bar with one lone table that seats up to four guests makes it a perfect evening with friends yet you can still feel intimate with your date (however, one time I heard the depressive story of a girl and I wanted to tell her to shut up).", "author": "Boho H."}

I mean, I really could find no disparity between what they offer (fresh fish, great service, cozy atmosphere) and what they deliver (fresh fish, great service, cozy atmosphere).\n\nThey have a rotating list of specials, which I consider to be an excellent sign for any place, but def for a sushi place. They also highlight their new rolls, which is nice for people who have been there before.\n\nI have had endless, fresh nigiri and sashimi, with nary a misstep on presentation, cut or taste. All the rolls are creative, interesting and daring - and so well pulled off! I hate when you try an interesting sounding maki roll, and it tastes terrible - like the chef did not even taste it. Not the case at Domo, each roll works and it is a great place to experiment with new kinds of fish and flavor combinations that you might not have put together yourself. Don't miss the Spicy Hulk! Somehow replacing nori with cucumber works, and you don't even miss the rice!\n\nTheir sake menu, while limited, offers a variety of tastes for a variety of price levels, which I appreciate. They also have a fine selection off beers.\n\nSome may complain about the cramped quarters or long waits, but that's what happens when a place is this good! They never rush you out, and the helpful staff seems to encourage the practice of ordering food as you want it - not all at once - which I really like.\n\nDomo is an excellent spot in Hayes Valley, and I can highly recommend taking someone here that you want to impress with some great food for a pretty reasonable price.", "author": "Melanie D."}

Their Amaebi (sweet shrimp) was probably the best I've had in the city, and I have definitely frequented my share of sushi restaurants. It was impeccably juicy and simply melted with the rice on my tongue. Their two crudos for 5.95 was also a great item on the menu - that's where I was able to try their uni and scallop, each on their own spoon.

The neighborhood seriously lacks one and I'm not talking about that one place that tastes like uninspiring vomit. \n\nOnwards for Domo:\n\nTheir assortment of sushi is small but incredibly delicious.  It's all the wonderful things that good sushi should have.  Their ingredients are fresh and each roll is done with love and care.  They give you ample portions of seaweed salad and the miso soup is pretty decent.  They also have a list of creative sushi rolls which I will be back very soon to try.  \n\nSeating is very limited in this small restaurant but the ambiance is cozy, charming and comfortable.  It's a Modernist's vision of the perfect sushi parlor complete with knick-knack, DIY light fixtures, something you'd find in an early 20th century science lab.  \n\nAlso, I commend them for their great music selection!\n\nThey don't take reservations so it's best to arrive early (before 7pm) for seating.

Domo was a short walking distance around the corner and the earliest to open so I popped in with a fresh bottle of Wakatake Onikoroshi daiginjo.  I was actually 15 minutes early from opening time, but they told me to go ahead and come on in - my kind of place.  I thought both the nigiri and sashimi servings were very fresh and satisfying.  I rarely order rolls and can't comment on these since I didn't order any.\n\nFor San Francisco the price relative to the quality was surprising i.e. a good value, less expensive than I would have normally expected.  I sat at the bar and found both the owner and staff to be polite and friendly.  They made me feel comfortable and good conversations ensued.  The service was prompt and efficient.  \n\nI would definitely come back when in the area and wanting sushi.  I'd like to see some izakaya items added to the menu.

It's most bar seating unless you are willing to sit outside (1 inside table for 2). Intimate. \n\nThe sushi was good. This is really a \"roll\" place. The nigiri was really mediocre or even worse bad. I always tend to get some hamachi, sake, and seared ahi nigiri. The ahi was the best nigiri I tried there. The Hamachi carpaccio was the bomb.  The crudos were also quite nice, particularly the uni if that is your thing. The famous firecracker is a great blast of flavor that is a must, at least for 1st timers. I wouldn't order it again though. The flavors are bit too familiar.\n\nThe sequence in which we received everything was totally wrong. All the most flavorful items came first so we had to do a lot of palate cleansing. I'm sure the rest of the rolls are also good. There is a little too many spicy tuna type combo rolls for me though.\n\nI don't think we will come back. I would though recommend this place a friend to try out. Maybe come back for that carpaccio.

Um, do you not see that we're ALL shoved together at this bar? If you really have a problem, you could ask.

Oh I guess I'll get tempura.\n\nWho goes to a sushi restaurant and makes a fuss about fish being cooked? It was hard to tell what this lady's definition of \"cooked\" was. Perhaps she meant warmed, or steamed, or fried the hell out of it. Whatever she meant, I learned later that night that she 1. has never eaten at a bar (so confirmed to her equally lame male partner) and 2. only orders tempura when she goes out. What a waste of fish.\n\nThis was all trumped by the conversation going on the other side of us.\n\nAnother guy-girl pair. Guy asks the server, \"I want to see your most sustainable fish.

The seaweed salad was really good, and the rock and roll (roll) was yummy too. However, the firecracker balls were rockin! The flavor was intense and wonderful, unagi sauce added the perfect touch, and there was a mild spice that made them taste better than any sushi rolls I have ever had.

We ordered the similar rolls from last time including the sexy mama, spicy tuna crunchy, ST handrolls & firecracker balls. \n\nEverything was crap...handrolls had 1/2 the amount of fish, rolls were drowning in spiced mayo to the point we couldn't taste the fish or finish the roll & the rice wasn't prepared correctly as it was too soft and fell apart on all rolls.  Service was not pro like the 1st time...the busboy from last time served us. This was one of very few times where we have left a personal tip for the chefs that was to tone down on the sauce.\n\nYour inconsistency has disgraced the family Domo! 1 last chance left due to the close proximity and a once proud 5 star rating.

The fiesta roll sounded interesting because I like tuna, mango and cilantro, but it's actually kind of weird to have salsa on your sushi so I'll never order that roll again.

I don't think I would make a special trip for it, but after Symphony, it's a good choice that's close by without having to resort to giant chocolate desserts at Max's or something. \n\nThe decor is much more hip and nicer than the pictures on Yelp. By 6pm on a Sunday, it's already filling up very quickly. The seat arrangement surrounding the room probably doesn't optimize the space, but I kinda like it. It's like everyone is on their intimate little date. You are so close to your dining companion your knees brush against each other's, but if you ever get bored with your conversation, you can always check yourself out in the mirror or look outside the window for more exciting potentials. \n\nAnd did I mention it's dim so everyone looks good? \n\nMusic is hip; waiters are hip. Menu is also less traditional, featuring crudos---spoonfuls of delight that would normally serve in an appetizer dish. But now they appear even tinier, almost big enough for one bite, but oh, those spoons so cool and hip. \n\nMy husband and I had a bunch of nigiris: tuna, hotate, hamachi, aji, and uni. It was good that we ordered uni last, because they were good enough for me to bump this place to 4 stars instead of 3. The rest of the nigiris were good, but not memorable. Rice kinda falls apart a little too easily. \n\nWe also had the crudo with crab and ankimo. Both delicious; both really small. But we should have expected that with the price being only $6. Rock N Roll was very decent. Not overpowered by the sauce like a lot of bad sushi places tend to do. \n\n$40 for 2 people; a great little gem for dates if you arrive early.

I didn't notice whether they have heater outside. Call me weirdo, but their bathroom was pretty nice and clean. I don't like dirty bathrooms. It's a reflection on the kitchen. So now let's talk about their food, DELICIOUS! Excellent. We truly enjoyed it. Except our my miso soup, it had a hint of dishwashing soap taste to it. Didn't bother to tell the waiter because it was too late, I've ingested the entire soup. We ordered the following: toro nigiri, monkfish, salmon, domo rolls. Everything plus tip came out to be $70. I have no idea why people rank this as $$. We didn't order much and as you see the bill was pretty up there. So I ruled out the $$ to more like $$$.

Soft, lightly acidic, with excellent rich mackerel flavor but no heavy oily fishiness that can happen so easily. It's obviously cured in-house, and quite well. Their ankimo is tasty and the presentation is lovely. It's not too much, either, which is nice for what should be an appetizer. Their hamachi kama is delicious and very generous with the fish. Huge hunks of creamy salty goodness and a piquant dipping sauce. They had hamachi toro, which was fun to try but not as good as bluefin toro. They also had salmon toro baked in salt, which makes for a crispy skinned rich fatty morsel, smoky and salty like pork belly but with much better mouthfeel. Definitely eat the skin right along with the fish. Good rolls with inventive combinations, although a bit heavy on the deep frying.\n\nService was fast and informative, and the price was right. We three dined well and left full for $95 without tip, including a few beers (no Asahi, but the Asahi Dark was a nice complement to the fatty foods we ordered.)", "author": "Sean B."}

Walking in there was great because it reminded me of what I love about good Sushi places, where the bar is the centerpiece and best seat in the house. The second thing that told me I was in for a treat was the specials -- Toro, Aji, and Hamachi neck (a first for me) among others which demonstrate the chef's willingness to pick up exotic yet delicious fish which a place like Sushi Rock may avoid.\n\nNeedless to say, the fish was all great. Very fresh, not horribly expensive (Sebo anyone?) and well presented. There were lots of interesting rolls (like the fire cracker balls, a must) and old standbys like their delicious salmon skin roll that made the entire experience a great one. \n\nFor the record, we went at 6:30 and it was empty. We got some one on one with the chef, and the food came out quick. Later on around 7:30 was when it really started to pack in, so I highly recommend getting there a little earlier than usual to avoid a wait. \n\nFive stars for a classy joint like this one, with great fish, a great atmosphere and great prices.", "author": "Jeff G."}

I'll never go back there!  We were in that neighborhood, going to walk over to Van Ness Ave.  I had a friend with me because we were going to the opera and we wanted a fast bite to eat before it would start.  \nDomo had wheelchair access, so we went in at 6:10 pm on a Wednesday evening.  (1)  I knew as a wheelchair user I wasn't going to sit at their Sushi Bar, but they moved their cash register a bit, gave me a space of nine inches by 18 inches and put me sideways as if I can eat turning and with my left had when I'm right handed and sideways!  Well, I said in a loud voice, \"I'm not going to eat, I'll just have hot tea.\"  My partner was seated at the left-end stool at their bar. (2) The wheelchair was really disturbing movement in-and-out of their customers, but they made no effort to move us to a table when one was available.  So, I received dirty looks like, \"Why did you have to come here?\"  I didn't have the time to protest the treatment because of the opera appointment and continued to sit to the left of my partner's stool, like a dog, looking up while they ate. \n(3)  The tea was served in a tall clay-like mug or glass and it was too hot for me to even hold.  At the time to leave; I hadn't even had one sip of tea, so, I asked for a container to take it with me.  I had the plan to sip the tea from a paper cup on the way and before the opera.  No such luck!  Domo has no paper cups and gave me my hot green tea in a clear plastic container; you know, like the ones used for potato salad at the Deli!  I looked them and then at the container:  I saw a doggy-dish which had plastic leaking toxins in to my hot green tea, and I again felt so insulted.  \nThe Kobi Beef was fair, just ok, nothing special, my guest said.  \nOne meal with white rice and two teas, close to $30 dollars and filled with contempt for disabled customers!", "author": "Corinne d."}

To start out, we had the hot sake, always a must, when chatting about dirtbag guys and catching up with friends.  Then came the edemame, which were always a plus. Edamame is always good when they aren't overcooked, slightly crunchy and mildly salty. On to the rolls. My favorite was definitely the spider roll, it was so light but incredibly flavorful. Next on my list would be the crunchy california roll, which was great! The roll was a little hot when we received it, so we let it cool down for a minute, but then.....nothing but a fiesta in my mouth!\nOur third roll was the Spicy Hulk...a variation of the spicy tuna roll. It also was delicious, but a little big to eat in one bite. More like 3 bites. Ok, so finally we got around to the nigiri, because we were still hungry after the three rolls. We ordered the scallop, salmon and tuna rolls. They were all really fresh, which is what makes or breaks the whole experience. It's easy to spot day-old fish, and there was none of that here.

The sexy mama roll was different than I expected - very refreshing.

We also had seaweed salad, a few other rolls, and a combination of sesame and green tea ice cream for dessert -- all of which were excellent.

It's a small place, so if you were to go when there was a line, it might take a while; the place seems to only seat 15 people or so.  I wasn't very impressed with the food at all.  The fish wasn't very fresh at all and I just didn't care for the spicy tuna.  The roll was huge, however, so if you're the kind of guy (or gal) who prefers quantity to quality, you might enjoy yourself.\n\nAll in all, the place is over hyped.

The sushi is always extremely fresh, the rolls are creative and the warmth and generosity of the restaurant are apparent from all who work there. You will only find sushi of this quality in a couple of places in all of san francisco. I do miss the owner's brother, who has other things to attend to these days.

It tasted OK, but I like my scallops raw. \n\nOK ending:  I had the sashimi on seaweed salad.  At $12, it includes miso soup and salad, which is nice.  The fish was fresh and the salad was nicely dressed.  Nothing that amazing to speak of.  The husband had chirashi, which is sashimi on a bed of rice.  The rice was cold and we were missing the classic bento box presentation of chirashi.  Again, nothing offensive about the fish and it did seem fresh.  We were still hungry, however, and ordered a good Rock-n-Roll (avocado + eel roll) which was pretty good.\n\nWeird Service:  While they weren't rude, they weren't necessarily the friendliest.  And our interactions were kind of awkward.  I found it weird that they didn't greet a solo guest who walked through the door for like 5 minutes.

He was already busy, and ably supported by his Latino assistant, but they did not exude much personality .  No interplay. OK... but that's part of a true sushi bar experience (and price!).\n\nOK, here's where Mr. Excitable has it right. It's not an authentic  Japanese place. It did look like a casual neighborhood joint in Tokyo, but it's an American approximation, and I'd assume that being in the neighborhood and getting cast-off's from Suppenkuche and Sebo helps to keep their seats filled. There are countless \"authentic\" Japanese places in and around San Francisco, but of course it depends on whether you want to Hang in a Hip neighborhood, and then find sustenance, or if you are in search of authentic dishes. If you are, try Eiji, or Tanuki. Japanese people can be seen frequenting these places, if you go by that old rule....\n\nI would probably go to Domo more if I lived in the neighborhood, but that is the key.

The whole meal was spent with my arms and shoulders tucked in. We rushed our meal in order to escape. When we left the 3 top was still open and there was 2 parties of 2 waiting to be seated! Our meal was extremely average. They have three rolls (yes I like rolls) on the menu with shiso in them, so possibly I would give another star because I really like shiso, however the rolls were so average and over priced I'll keep it at 2. The miso soup was gross and the seaweed salad certainly came from a bag. It was very bland and served warm, so that was fairly unpleasant. I had a glass of sauvignon blanc, 8 dollars, and not very good. The waiter got my bf's beer wrong.

It's now my de facto neighborhood sushi place to go to whenever I want decent sushi and don't want to leave the hood. \n\nThis is a tiny place (there are only about 20 seats total) and it's all bar seating. Tiny as it is, it's very comfortable and intimate. The low lighting and unobtrusive service make it a perfect place to have a great meal and catch up with a good friend. I've noticed that most of the people here are neighborhood peeps. Some come with their date or one other friend (due to the seating arrangements) and get lost in their own world and conversation. Very charming. \n\nI'm a little bit of a sushi/sashimi snob, so I'll have to say that the fish is fresh enough, though definitely not the top grade kind of fish served by the truly authentic Japanese restaurants who buy their fish from the markets in Japan. That said, it's still definitely good. Ive had their kampachi cappachio, all the crudos (salmon, spicy tuna, scallops, uni, etc), all the sashimis (standard fare of salmon, maguro, hamachi and albacore) and they are all good. I'm not a fan of the Fire Cracker Balls that most people like though. It's nothing special. Oh, and one time, they served me my miso soup with a spoon in it!!! What? Miso soup with a spoon? That's definitely NOT Japanese, and it threw me off a bit. But no worries, I just took out the spoon and proceeded to drink my soup from the bowl-the way it's supposed to!

You can get the sushi combo with the spicy tuna roll and 4 different types of nigiri for about 12$ or the Chirashi lunch special. The sashimi is fresh. I particularly enjoyed the tasmanian trout, which practically melts in your mouth. The Hamachi belly was succulent and for the price, well worth it! My friends love the firecracker balls although I still haven't tried it yet. Take out is efficient and the fish still tastes fresh. The restaurant is small but cosy.

Due to a series of circumstances, I've dove back into eating sushi about 2 months ago.  Sushi Domo is the best sushi restaurant I have been to since I re-entered the sushi fray.  Mind you, that I have been to most sushi restaurants in Japan town and Sushi Domo tops them all easily.  I have experienced nothing but fresh, ample cuts in my nigiri and rolls (I've been 4 times in two weeks).  I order sake by the glass, generally $7-$9.  And Domo's glass is more like a miniature carafe.  Not huge, but larger than \"glasses\" at many sushi joints I've visited.   \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the place is a wee on the wee side.  But I haven't waited for more than 10 minutes to sit.  Any wait is worth it for me.  At this point, I'm only interested in trying Ebisu so see if it stacks up to Domo.  Otherwise Domo is my new sushi home.", "author": "Micah T."}

My impression is possibly enhanced by the great day in GG park under the sun, but the fish was so nourishing.  Sunazuri (yellowtail belly), maguro, and albacore was great.  The crudos were well worth it, I had the monkfish liver and the salmon.  Both had great taste and were presented beautifully.  I love shiso, so the spicy tuna roll was perfect for me.  The guys behind the counter and friendly and interactive, not stand-offish like some places.  They offer you some off the menu things if you butter them up a little.  Service for water or tea refills could be hard to get.  For the price, this is a good find.  Its not a destination restaurant, but if you want a good local place, this is superior to most.

I prefer sitting in front of the chefs so I can chat with them, but nothing wrong with sitting on the other side.

NOPE! well, maybe just a tad but you mainly taste the fresh jalapeno taste without the tongue burning sensation cause the seeds don't come with it.

The service is great, but the wait can be somewhat long.  Ultimately I do recommend it highly because the sushi is absolutely delicious!!!!", "author": "Lola W."}

It actually wasn't our first choice, but a lot of other places in the neighborhood are closed Mondays apparently.  In any case, when we walked in there was only one other person there, and she was waiting for takeout.  The whole place maybe only seats about twenty.  We took a couple seats at the sushi bar and perused the menu and specials board.  For a small place, the menu did have a lot of variety.  The sushi chef was cutting up salmon and doing prep work for the evening when we came in, and everything looked very fresh.  They even have real crab California Rolls.  Kampachi Carpaccio was delicious, as was my Negi Hamachi Handroll.  I can't remember everything else we had, but I had a fun little conversation with him about Uni, which is a recent development for me.  A friend convinced me to try it in Los Angeles and now I love it.  The chef's comment: \"Welcome to the other side.\"", "author": "Lindsay B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-07", "description": "The sushi here is strictly \"typical\" sushi, which is to say your usual array of rolls and nigiri.  The atmosphere is decent, but almost strictly counter based seating, so it's not great for groups.  The fish isn't as good as Sebo, nor is the vibe, but if you're looking for a cozy, reasonably priced, tasty neighborhood sushi spot, this one is certainly decent.", "author": "Patrick P."}

Flavor, texture, temperature variations and subtlety with each dish.    Fresh and delicious.   Friendly and efficient staff.     Highly recommended by a couple of sushi snobs.", "author": "Sean V."}

The sushi is really creative and really good and not super expensive. The place is spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. And the guys behind the bar are super cool, you feel really welcome when you step inside their little sushi sanctuary. Doesn't get much better than Domo.", "author": "Troy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-07", "description": "mixed on this place.  it just opened up so i assume some kinks are being worked out.\n\ni started with the edamame, and honestly it was prob the worst i have ever had in my life (and i have had a lot of edamame).   very cold, not salted, and slimy a bit with the inner casing falling apart.\n\nasparagus and cucumber rolls were v. good.  the yellowtail with jalapeno was very good, but i am not sure if that day they made a pepper mistake or what.  i LOVE spicy food, but whatever pepper they put in was wayyyy too spicy for the fish.  \n\nan issue that cannot be fixed is the size and layout of the place.  i am not a big person, and my food and myself took up two places (i came at lunch).  on a crowded night, dining with another person in the space of only two would be a v. tight squeeze.  it is all bar seating, only one table.  \n\nlast small thing....$20 credit card min.  i have no prob with a min, but the lunch specials advertised are way under $20, or if you are having lunch alone the bill would likely be under $20.  i asked, and no budging on this one, so i had to run to the atm before eating (since my bill was under $20).", "author": "n. h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-18", "description": "Domo is good, but not great. The price isn't exactly cheap and the menu isn't big. I mainly went because my friend is a sushi fan and after looking around online, Domo was one of the better rated ones. I don't eat raw fish so I was looking around to see what was available and it seemed like that only the California Rolls, Ebi (shrimp) Tempura, and Ebi Nagiri is cooked, everything else was raw that I could tell. The place is also very small, just to give you an idea how small, the picture that was taken with people sitting at the counter looking out the window, there's about an opposite side to it where the bar is at and 3 tables, one on the inside and two outside and that's it. By the time me and my friend left, there were two big parties waiting which I can't say that was a good idea since seating is limited already as is. Also, sitting at the counter is with stools, which isn't too bad except that it's so crowded that it's difficult to get your stool closer to the counter. I would recommend this place if you're a sushi fan and looking for some place new to try for yourself, otherwise, I might avoid it, even more so if it's out of your way.", "author": "Richard C."}
