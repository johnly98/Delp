And by they, I mean the many, many peeps who crown the Marlowe Burger as THE burger of SF. While I can't verify the validity of that bold statement (I need to eat at least 50 more burgers across the city before doing so) I will say it was f-ing fantastic. Melted, gooey cheese; bacon that added a nice salty crisp w/out overpowering any other flavors; a perfectly seasoned medium rare patty; caramelized onions, providing a touch of sweetness; & horseradish aioli to wake them nostrils up. All between the perfect bun that somehow soaked up the juices but never got too soggy. Burger is served with fries or a tossed salad--ask for half and half, and you'll still get a pile of both. \n\nK, we addressed the burger sitch but there are plenty more standouts here. The wife and I stopped by for a lunch date before I had to leave for work for a few days, so we went all out. We also ordered...\n\n++Steak Tartare, with a poached quail egg on top. 4/5\n++DiStefano Burrata, with roasted butternut squash and smoked honey. 6/5, it was THAT good. \n++Gin w/Thyme Cocktail, a really easy refreshing sipper \n\nEverything was legit.

We made reservations in the morning for lunch at 12:30PM. When we arrived, there were a few tables available. It's a good thing we made reservation anyways, you'll never know when there's a line!\n\nWe ordered toasted levain and half dozen oysters for our starters. The bread case with cultured butter, and together they tasted sooooooo good. I wish butter isn't bad for you cause I'd slather on a crap ton of butter on my toast. | The oysters were pretty good, especially for a restaurant not known to be an oyster bar. They were fresh and briny! So delicious. They were small breed oysters, so I'm guessing probably kumamotos or shigokus. $30 for market price. \n\nFor entrees we got the Guittard chocolate toast and cod & shrimp Benedict. I never really order sweet toasts cause I never thought they were worth the calories or effort. But I was craving for something sweet today and I went ahead with the chocolate toast. It had olive oil, sea salt and chili flakes on it. Man, it was the best chocolate toast I've ever had. The combination of sweet and a tiny hint of savory made it so wholesome. I wish they were bigger and came with more than 3 slices. \n\nThe Benedict was just ok. Not the best I've ever had but it was pretty good. It came with two poached eggs and one big cod/shrimp cake. Kinda funny, the best part about the benedict to me were the greens. Nothing much to say about this dish, it's kinda what you'd expect. \n\nWe ordered two drinks: \nMorning Glory (tequila and coffee with lavender buds) - it was uh...interesting. I'm not a huge fan of tequila so I thought the combination was disgusting. I don't think my brain could comprehend tequila and coffee in one. The boyfriend got a second glass though. \nThe Baker's Wife (vodka with grapefruit and lemon peel) - I prefer vodka over tequila. I also like cocktails that are more citrusy. This was perfect. Got me slightly buzzed during my meal, but I'm not complaining. \n\nOverall, the service was good, food is good. The only thing that bothered me was how close all the tables are, that we had very little room to move. When new patrons arrive and got seated next to us, we had to adjust the table a little to the left or right to give them room to sit. When I'm trying to enjoy my meal, that's not something I wanna be cautious about the entire time. At the same time, I also can't blame anyone cause that's just how it is.", "author": "Elle T."}

Marlowe was not too far with enough good reviews to try out.  \n\nWhen we got there, it was still happy hour so the menu was slightly limited especially in terms of their entrees. From it, we chose the crispy brussel sprouts and the baked oyster, both of which were major disappointments.  The brussel sprouts were more oily versus crispy with small portions.  Definitely nothing to justify the $9.50 price tag.... Then the baked oyster was also another major letdown.  More like a clam chowder placed in an oyster that was not really satisfying.\n\nWith a little protestation from the wait staff, they allowed us to stay for dinner service.  Thank goodness! If my experience at the restaurant were solely based on the appetizers/starters that I tried, the rating would have been much lower.  Here is what we ordered:\n\nPork chop: The pork chop was definitely a highlight!  It had nice fatty pieces in the meat giving it a nice juicy bite.  The slivered almonds on top provided a nice contrast along with the slightly salty sweet sauce.  The only thing that I did not enjoy was the cheese dumplings.  While there was nothing wrong with the taste, it did not seem to mesh well with the pork.\n\nScallop: Although I am not a scallop fan, I definitely liked this dish mainly for the different flavor combinations and textures going on with each bite.  The slightly salty scallops grilled to a nice firm consistency paired well with the sweet crunchy corn salad accompaniment.  With the grilled leeks, it all worked well together.\n\nThe service was okay.  As mentioned earlier, the vibe from the staff when we asked to extend our stay into dinner service was not super welcome.  Some street parking available in front or in the neighboring streets.\n\nOverall, Marlowe was far from perfect but only saved with the quality of its entrees (skip the starters...)!", "author": "Patrick S."}

No complaints about the food whatsoever and definitely deserves the spot on the top 100 list. \n\nThe service was a bit spotty and the restaurant gets loud and busy.

Brussel Sprouts appetizer was good but was something I could have made at home with a lot of butter. My friend also order the Little Gem salad....ugh.

My Polenta was also just okay. Super rich, no meat, overpowering truffle cheese and had a hint of sour, and thick polenta at the bottom. Lastly, the Deviled Eggs ($1.50 per half piece) was just okay. The bacon was super salty and the egg wasn't all that. \n\nI think I totally ordered the wrong items, I so wanted the scallops but went with the polenta.

We started with restaurant created drinks first, I had the Pimms Cup and my friend had the Baker's Wife. Mine was very refreshing and crisp tasting.

Yeah, just a few bites...my god we were ravenous wild animals! The eggs! The oysters! The tartare! Omg that soup is wildly shroomy and flipping amazing! One of the best I've ever had, so much so that I really wasn't even acknowledging my friend while I was eating it. She kept saying, are you listening?! Ha!! No. \n\nThe entrees we chose were the angus rib eye and wild mushroom polenta accompanied by a side of healthy, baked cauliflower! The rib eye was a perfect medium and juicy AF, presented sliced in half then stacked! The shroom polenta is a must! MF'er is creamy and heartier than the heartiest with baby criminis strew about in the mix! The cauliflower is such a nice side and super farm-fresh veggie-tasting and cooked perfect with a bit of crunch. \n\nWe finished with the chocolate peanut butter bites, yeah just those...what?! They're made with local Guittard chocolate, crispy corn flakes and peanuts. They spread that mixture out onto a baking sheet then chill to harden then cut up into cubes for service, presented cubed in a small mason jar on a small plate! We loved this dessert!

Highly recommend the Deviled Eggs (surprisingly) and the Octopus Salad for starters. Baked Oysters were a no go for me though. The clam chowder made it too rich for my taste. The Marlowe burger was cooked perfectly and the fries that came with it were awesome. Plus, I mentioned that my friend and I would be sharing everything so they even took the time to split the burger for us without being asked to... which is super nice and convenient :') Servers were very attentive and constantly checking up on us. \n\nSolid dinner spot in SoMa!!", "author": "Caroline K."}

I went there for dinner with my mom and it exceeded all our expectations in terms of food, service, and ambiance.  It is a small but popular place, therefore, I recommend making a reservation before going.\n\nWhen we sat down the waiter came promptly to our table. We started with the crispy brussel sprout chips.  They were eaten quite quickly.  It brussel sprout skins doused in olive oil and crisped to perfection.  A great light start to the meal.  My mom got the polenta, which as Marlowe describes it, is as good as crack.  And that polenta was amazing.  It was  the consistency of a porridge, easy to eat, with a poached egg sitting perfectly on top. I got the Pan Seared Scallops, which was also a phenomenal dish. The scallops were complimented nicely by this sweet sauce on the dish. \n\nWe were so full which meant no room for dessert, but that also means I'll be back soon to get some :)", "author": "Christina T."}

The interior is very nice: white, light and airy with great decor. I had a late brunch reservation for saturday brunch at 1:30 and it was still super packed. The place and food were amazing though!\nI ordered the west bay sparrow which is one of their non-alcoholic cocktails with pineapple juice, lemonade and hibiscus - it was super refreshing and the pineapple taste was quite strong, but I didn't mind. Our server was such a sweetheart, very attentive and helpful! I ordered the smoked salmon bagel and for $16 i think it was a little expensive but the flavors were incredible and it tasted fantastic I would highly recommend this! My brother ordered the Marlowe burger w/ fingerling potatoes and a side of eggs over easy and he also really enjoyed his whole meal. \nThis place is a must for brunch and parking is pretty simple, there's usually a lot of street parking around!", "author": "Noor H."}

Yes, I can see how it would be a sexy and sleek place in the evening but in the daytime it's just a fresh and bright place to go with colleagues or clients. \n\nBrussell Sprout chips were fantastic -- I would definitely recommend for a couple of folks to nosh on while waiting for your food. Coffee was good, thick and caffeinated :) Lunch was delish -- my boss and client got the same thing: a fried chicken sando. I got the steak salad.

First taste of the menu was a gin cocktail with Serrano and lime. Sounded amazing, but it was so incredibly spicy that it blew my palate and made my stomach almost instantly burn. Although I liked the general flavor, I had to send back. I like all the spice usually, but this was far too much. I tried another with whiskey and it was ok. The last drink I tried had gin and lavender, and was served up. This was the only drink I would have ordered again. \n\nFood wise, everything was mediocre and lacking great flavor and that \"it factor\". Ordered the burrata with toast, octopus salad, pork chop, fries, and Brussels sprouts. The pork chop was dry, the fries were average, the sprouts were soggy and tasted strongly of lime, and the salad was bitter. \n\nLastly, ambiance was not overly welcoming or comfortable. It's a small restaurant, tables are very packed together so you're basically fully overhearing the conversations next to you, and the door was open allowing a cold SF breeze to take over our table. \n\nReally glad I went because I've been meaning to see what Park Tavern's sister restaurant was all about, but have no need to return. If you know and love Park Tavern, think of Marlow as Park Tavern's ugly step sister.", "author": "Lauren N."}

Our service started out really horrible but eventually the food and the change in waitresses saved the night. It is an easy 4-5 stars if not for our experience \n\nWe had a surprise bday with 8 people at the table. 4 of us got there early and wanted to wait for the rest before we ordered. Our original waitress asked if we are gonna wait or not. We said yes. \n\n5 min later she asked the thing and we said yes we are waiting\n\nShe came again all within the 15 minutes, and when we said yes she rolled her eyes and sped off, seeing how upset she was she should have realized it's her fault. She could have just waited for our party to get there - and if that is a problem do not seat us next time until we are all there. You can't have both. \n\nEventually she talked to the hostess and we suddenly had a way nicer waitress. She made up in niceness and was great with us. Our original waiter kept working with the new one and not until we mentioned something to someone working there until she starting trying to be nice. \n\nNow for the food:\nHighlights : Poulet vert (very tasty), their burgers , crispy kale chips and duck liver mouse \nThe burratta was good too \nSalad designs are good but nothing too spectacular with the ingredients \n\nAmbiance and decor are great too", "author": "Jad A."}

The dessert menu did not have much to choose from other than the different flavors of ice cream. I chose the Olive Oil Cake, hoping it would be something surprising.

Food, and especially cocktails, were great.\n\nRESERVATIONS: Made online a week in advance (dinner for 2 on a Saturday at 7pm). Plenty of openings still at that point. \n\nTHE COST: $163 total for a very filling dinner for two (2 drinks, 2 starters, 1 side, 1 huge entree, 1 dessert). A small splurge, but it was worth it for my birthday dinner. \n\nSERVICE: Heather was super enthusiastic and had this amazing laugh.

Not to mention, the meat was fantastic! Very tender, cooked perfectly.\n\nSIDES\n* Brown Butter Brussels Sprouts ($9) - 3 stars\nSo much butter. SO much butter. Also, I prefer more crispy brussels sprouts, and these were very soft & soggy.\n\nDESSERT\n* Apple Crisp ($10) - 4 stars\nWe were stuffed but this was still great. Not too heavy, but still a great crisp mixed in with apple slices. The apple could have been a little more cooked through. \n\nCOCKTAILS\n* The Florist ($15) - 4.5 stars\nFanstastic, well-balanced, just the froth could have been thicker and more homogeneous. \n\n* The Baker ($14) - 4 stars\nNot my usual type of drink, but I tried a sip and this wasn't overly strong, had great flavor.\n\nNON-ALCOHOLIC COCKTAILS\n* West Bay Sparrow ($7) - 4 stars\nVery tasty, refreshing, loved the herby flavors!", "author": "Ziyan C."}

This yummy place sits right at the corner, super easy to find IF the large crowds and herd of ppl don't already get your attention. I've heard of this place for a while and know DINNER gets packed, with reservations usually put out weeks in advance. So we were hoping we'd luck out with happy hour vs. dinner...AND we did! Service was amazing and luckily the beau/I stumbled in around the perfect off-time...therefore had NO wait AND also got to hit multiple items on their happy hour menu!! \n\n\nFood talk:\n\n(1) Deviled eggs - one of the best freakn deviled eggs I've ever had. And yes, I maybe be biased - bc I love EGGS, buttttt they were really soooo good!! Nice and warm, perfectly creamy then topped with aged provolone + pickled Jalape\u00f1o for a little kick + crispy fatty bacon bits for some meaty flavahhhh!\n\n(2) Brussel sprout chips - crispy, tasty, & so easy to eat!! Lightly salted and seasoned, also somehow perfectly crispy yet not super oily at all! Comes out in a cute little container & pretty much taste just as good as it looks!\n\n(3) Baked oysters - comes out piping hot on a bed of sea salt, 2 tiny oysters but with such big flavor! There was a tad bit too much sauce and seasoning to oyster ratio, but it was still good and not overwhelming. \n\n(4) Jumbo prawns - BOMB!!! & freakn huge!!! They were not joking about the JUMBO part yooooo...and it comes with 5 juicy pieces, lightly charred to perfection, PLUS a yummy tangy house sauce.\n\n(5) Steak tartare - this was simple and yet also very tasty from all the different components. The steak tartare itself was lightly seasoned and nice tender pieces. The tiny quail egg on top was perfectly poached + arugula for a nice bitterness + tasty olive oil toasty mini baguettes as the perfect eatable spoon. \n\n(6) Burger - a solid Burger, done clean and simple yet so beautiful. No excessive layers of other meats or fancy traits, just simple quality beef cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy, minced lettuce/caramelized onions/bacon bits + cheese + unique horseradish aioli = a solid banging Burger.\n\nLiabations:\n\n(1) The Baker's wife - super refreshing and def. not light in alchy - just the way I like it!!

There was nothing particularly interesting or high quality about this rejoined spot. From the menu options to the flavors to the interior design to the service, everything was very mediocre. \n\nWhat we ordered: \nThe Omelette : while large, it was at best decent. Very standard in terms of the egg base and all the filling were in giant hunks just lazily plopped in between the fold of eggs. \nGrapefruit juice : decent but it didn't taste very fresh. \nFried egg sandwich : again, solid but nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall pretty disappointed.

I was able to make a reservation a week before through OpenTable. I've been to Marlowe one other time for brunch and thought it was pretty good. The restaurant itself was very small, so the tables were super close to each other. However, their candlelight setting did help make the experience a little more intimate. Service was just okay, nothing to complain or praise about. \n\nWe ordered half a dozen oysters to share, and for $3 a piece (market price), these were sad, little oysters. For a fraction of the price, I've had better quality, in terms of size and freshness, elsewhere. The brussel sprout chips (with lemon juice & sea salt) was also a miss; the chips were burnt and bitter. It was also not mixed well enough, some parts were too salty, while others were to sour. The steak tartare was really good. The arugula added a nice kick. I got the pan roasted cod for my main entree, and felt like it was nothing special. It was a little dry in my opinion. My friends got the burger and angus ribeye. The burger was just ok. The ribeye was AMAZING. It was juicy and flavorful; I stole a few pieces off my friend's plate and regret not ordering it myself. \n\nAlso, my friend ordered their Juicer cocktail, without knowing Serrano is a pepper. Boyyyy were we in for surprise. That drink is SPICY. I preferred the Baker's Wife, a more refreshing cocktail with a hint of citrus. \n\nAfter factoring in their mediocre, overpriced dishes and average service.. I don't think I'll be back for dinner.

The food is good, I love the decor, and because they take reservations, I tend to bring friends who are visiting to avoid long waits. I've been here for brunch and dinner, and both have been good. \nFor brunch, the French toast soldiers are a must. The sauces go well with the French toast, although it can get a bit too sweet so be careful to not dip too much. The doughnuts were delicious and had a good balance of flavors. I love bread so I also ordered the toasted levain, but it was pretty average and wasn't very warm and toasty. For my main I got the Anson Mills Polenta. It was very good for the first half, but then it started to get too heavy with the mushrooms and truffle so I wasn't able to finish it. I also didn't know it would be covered with arugula, which I don't like. \nFor dinner, I love the crispy brussels sprout chips and the roasted bone marrow. The chips are addictive and I love the crispiness on the edges of the leaves while still a bit soft in the middle. The bone marrow was so flavorful and delicious paired with the bread. The ribeye was pretty good, but nothing too memorable. \nAlthough there are some dishes I didn't like or could've been been better, I can't wait to try the other dishes they have to offer.

Thinking you may need some more crostini? Before even asking, it's on the table. Food and drinks come out almost too fast, which is about the only negative I can think of. It makes the experience feel a little rushed. \n\nFood is delicious. My friend and I shared the Crispy Brussels Sprouts Chips, Steak Tartare, Warm Deviled Egg, Mushroom Soup, and Duck Liver Mousse, so got a nice sampling of their menu along with some very good Sangiovese. It's hard to decide what I liked best although I'm already craving those Brussels Sprouts Chips. Taking the time to separate all those Brussels Sprouts leaves makes all the difference in the world, but the process of doing so probably contributes to the heftier prices. I already have cravings for the Warm Deviled Egg as well, which cost $3 for a single half. I probably would have eaten a dozen otherwise!\n\nAlthough on the pricy side, Marlowe is worth it for the quality of food and service they provide, along with a comfortable and casual decor.

The tables were small but intimate so we didn't have to shout to talk to each other. Our server was nice the general service was very good. \n\nWe ordered 4 orders of bone marrow and two orders of brussel sprout chips. I've got to say they were both very good but expensive because the portions were small. Most of our party got the burger and some of us got the pork chop, polenta and chicken. I had the polenta and it was delicious. It was topped with tons of mushroom, arugula and parm. They do not have a large selection on their menu so it was a bit difficult to pick what to eat. I guess its a good thing because a smaller menu means they can do really well on those dishes! They have a bigger selection of drinks than food!\n\nOverall, I'm glad I came to try our their food.

We were lucky to get in without a wait and to sit at the bar at 11AM on Sunday. This restaurant is very cute and minimalist with every aesthetic detail thought out. While I was waiting for my friend, I ordered a cup of coffee (which is steep at $5) which came in a Le Cruset mug that I didn't even know existed.\n\nWhen my friend finally arrived, we ordered the following off of their Brunch menu:\n\n-Housemade Doughnuts ($10): These came in a huge portion and were REALLY good, even after they had cooled a bit. They came with this delicious house made jam (perhaps raspberry?) that complimented the cinnamon sugar really well. This was definitely the favorite item of Brunch though I am not sure how hard this is to actually prepare...\n\n-Pork Shank and Potato Hash ($15): This was mine and it was pretty good. The portion was also substantial but the flavors felt very boring. I have had better but overall, solid.\n\n-Marlowe Burger ($18): This is what my friend got and she subbed the fries for a salad. I tried the burger and it was good. My friend seemed happy with the salad however she wasn't thrilled that the burger had Horseradish on it (she missed it on the menu). Portion was also large.\n\nIn addition to this, we each had a Mimosa ($13) which was good but again, I think the price is steep considering some of their \"speciality\" brunch cocktails are that much or a dollar more. \n\nAll in all, Marlowe was good but didn't blow my mind. When all was said and done, we ended up sending $40pp on Brunch which is somewhat steep but not unheard of. The portions were large and the food was well-prepared. Sitting at the bar, I can't really comment on service. I think Marlowe is a great option if you need to be near Caltrain for some reason but I am not running back.

I came about 15 minutes early than my reservation, but once I checked in they seated me right away and brought me menus/water to look over while I was waiting for my friend. \n\nI like how their menu is simple and limited to one page. It's always tough for me when there's too many options haha. But even though the menu is simple everything looks so tasty that it's still hard to decide!\n\n| AMBIANCE | \n\nIt was my first time here and I thought it did get a little loud, but wasn't too loud to the point where I couldn't have a conversation with the person across from me. This place gets packed on the weekend but as you wait you can hit up the bar for some drinks to pass the time and grab a seat at one of their benches outside. \n\n| WE GOT | \n\n- Pimms Cup - SO REFRESHING. I've been a fan of Pimms since I studied abroad and I will always get Pimms if it's on the menu. For $13 it does seem a little steep, but the cup is huge and the one drink lasted the entire brunch. It pairs so well with the ginger beer, cucumber, and lemon that it doesn't even taste like alcohol. Dangerous? Probably. \n\n- Doughnuts - Lemon/ricotta over everything. There's something about this combo that is soo good to me that I try anything that has the two paired together. Lucky for me it seems like many people do the same because these doughnuts were brought to almost every table that was around me which was a good sign. The doughnuts were denser than what you would expect out of one, but it wasn't too heavy or oily either. It had a nice balance and paired great with the tartness of the jam. They come 5 to an order and were perfect to share between 2 people. \n\n- Potato Hash - My friend really enjoyed this dish because the meat was so tender and potatoes crispy. I'm not sure if this is something that i'd order for myself because i'm not a huge fan of the greens on the side but it's a good option to try. \n\n- Marlowe Burger - Def try this! The burger was cooked medium and the onions caramelized to perfection. They had a ton of bacon but my only peeve was that it was overcooked and tasted a little dry. Other than that the fries were crispy and paired well with the burger. \n\n***The doughnuts came out within 10 minutes, but the food took a while longer to get to the table so if you order them I would say to tell them to bring it to the table as it's ready vs when everything else is cooked. \n\n| SERVICE | \n\nThe staff here is so friendly! Throughout our entire meal they always made sure we had what we needed and made sure our waters were filled. It was easy to get their attention and the check so no complaints here.

We were glad we did because the restaurant was pretty packed at 12:30pm on a Monday.\n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was super friendly. She was quick to take our order and to bring out the food. Top-notch service!\n\nFOOD:\n*Brussel sprout chips: These were crispy and flavorful - the perfect starter to get our taste buds going! The chips maintained their crispiness without tasting like they were soaking in oil (soggy Brussel sprouts are no bueno).\n*Di Stefano burrata: The burrata was served with grilled radicchio on top of sliced country bread, and drizzled with aged balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar was SO good. I'd totally purchase this on its own if they sold it by the bottle!\n*Marlowe burger and fries: We ordered the burger medium rare, and it came out perfect and juicy. The caramelized onions and horseradish aioli both complemented the burger very well.\n\nOverall, I'm giving this restaurant 3.5 stars (minus half a star for the relatively pricey menu). It's not a restaurant I'd consistently go back to, given the plethora of food choices popping up in the city. But I'll be back to try the bone marrow and the deviled eggs!", "author": "Diana Y."}

Made a reservation beforehand, but the place wasn't too crowded either for 11:30am on a Saturday. The restaurant decor had a combination of a rustic and modern aesthetic. It's a bit out of the way of where I usually go for brunch (near AT&T park), but it was a nice place to discover. The table we were seated at was in the corner. It was bit of a snug fit, but not too bad. \n\nThe waitress came by to take our order for drinks. I was feeling a bit adventurous, asked what she recommended for people who love fruity drinks. She recommended The Baker's Wife, so that's what I got. It was delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol. I'm also a huge sucker for grapefruit, so that definitely played a part. \n\nI ended up ordering the cast iron frittata. The frittata had your average ingredients: potato, egg, spinach. It was a good, but I've made my fair share of frittatas. It seemed more like a scramble than a frittata. I typically prefer it if the potatoes were sliced, since they'll cook faster that way and soak up more of whatever seasoning you use. Couldn't really taste the cheese throughout the frittata; it was mostly concentrated at the top of the dish rather than incorporated throughout. I also typically like more of a sear on my frittata to add another texture to the dish. \n\nMy friend ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict. They had run our of their ham for the benedict that day, so they replaced it prosciutto. I really liked the creativity and execution of my friend's benedict. Instead of an English muffin, the prosciutto and the poached egg sat on a savory fried potato cake, like a latka. I hadn't seen anything like before eating at Marlowe. Definitely a good brunch pick for anyone who loves eggs benedicts in general. \n\nOverall, I liked the ambience and service was good. It's definitely a place I would go back to, to try some of their other food!", "author": "Christine L."}

Since I had seen so many rave reviews about the bone marrow and the burger, I knew I had to try both. I have never had bone marrow before so I was quite startled to see just a thin layer atop a hefty hunk of bone, but it seems like this is just a natural limitation of how much bone marrow is in a bone. What the bone marrow lacked in portion size, it more than made up in flavor. The salsa verde and herbs really kick the flavor up a notch, and the result is just exquisite. Definitely a must order at least once. For the burger, a lot of hamburgers can be rather unwieldy to eat, but this wasn't the case at all. The soft patty and bun make it super easy to scarf down! I found the flavor to be a bit bland, until I hit the slightly spicy horseradish aioli which was a game-changer, and the fries are generous and crispy.

(Plus I haven't had good bistro-style food in a while.) While I truly wanted to like their food, it seems I just wasn't served the same good quality food as other Yelpers. \n\nMarlowe is located on Brannan Street in the SOMA area of San Francisco. There was a lot of construction going around the restaurant so it wasn't as easy driving around the area, but we managed to find a metered parking space across the street. It's situated on the corner and right across from a Wells Fargo and Starbucks.\n\nThis review is purely for their dinner service. I haven't been there for their lunch/brunch yet so I can't comment on that. \n\nI did really like the overall look of the restaurant. The upscale bistro feel was there. The interior isn't that big (maximum capacity at 88.) but you can tell they tried to fit in as much tables as they could. For that reason privacy is nonexistent, but if you like listening on to other people's conversations, you're golden! There's a smallish 6 seater bar area, a large communal table, and a couple of small individual tables. \n\nThis place gets very noisy during peak times and we felt like we couldn't even hold a decent conversation after a while. Our server was really nice and came by to check on us twice. I will have to agree with Vincent L with the saltiness of our food. With each bite, they got even saltier. I expected better quality from a restaurant with 4 stars and over 2000 reviews, but sometimes there are exceptions. I would go again to try their brunch fares, but probably not order their popular Burger or Brussels Sprouts again. \n\nBrown Butter Brussels Sprouts : Very salty. Wasn't the kind with a crispy exterior. They were boiled and just over-salted. \n\nRoasted Bone Marrow : The only dish I would order again. There was a good amount of marrow inside the two sides. They had really good flavors too. \n\nSpiced Jumbo Gulf Shrimp : The shrimps were pretty big. Some areas weren't completed cooked and still of transparent color. \n\nMarlowe Burger : Very salty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "I like to read the SF Chronicle Top 100 Restaurants book. Comes out once a year and is full of great restaurants. Marlowe is in the book. \n\nWell, my anniversary was coming up, so I went to the book and tried to find one with reservations available. It's tough to find one that has openings in the same month, most are fully booked. Anyhow, after looking through I found Marlowe. I noted it is well thought of for the most. I made a reservation for a Monday night at 630. \n\nWe arrived early, and found seats at the bar. We were barely seated and the hostess had found us a table. There were a few empty tables. In spite of that, the place was hopping and after 15 mins there was quite a few people waiting. \n\nThe tables here are very close together. Inches. I sat across from my wife but was actually closer to the people at the tables next to us. That can be nice, when the person next to you is chatty and friendly. And not so good if not. At least the positive is it's easier to hear your conversation in here. And it's a loud place, not ear splitting but loud. \n\nWe were greeted by the water boy promptly. Our waiter showed up quick, but was really unpleasant. And, once he said hello, I did not see him again for 15 minutes. The table next to us had a like response. They were friendly. And they eat here often. \n\nSo we had plenty of time to review the menu. We decided on cocktails, appetizers and entrees before the waiter returned. The waiter returned, mood the same, and helped us in his way to place our orders.  The waiter did his job but I have a much better time when the waiter is engaged in his job. \n\nWe placed our orders. I got a cocktail off their signature menu called the Baker wife ordered an old fashioned. The apps, deviled eggs (a specialty, and some saut\u00e9ed pistachios. Emily ordered the burger and fries (said to be best in SF) and I got the polenta. \n\nDrinks and appetizers arrived quickly. I have to say, my cocktail, The Baker, was absolutely superb. Fantastic.  Flavorful. I was only able to have one, I'm driving, but I wanted another at double volume. Yummy. Wife's cocktail was no better than average and probably a little worse. She ordered what I had ordered the first time. Like I said, yummy. \n\nOur appetizers were much the same. The deviled eggs were good, but not great, and I expect a lot out of top 100 status. Btw, I love deviled eggs and had read quite a bit about these ones. I can only assume those who bragged about them online are people who don't make them. Or eat them very often.  The pistachios were excellent. Better even than the ones my wife makes. Sweet, savory and crunchy and a very good pair with cocktails or beer. \n\nEntrees next. Burger and fries? I'm coming back and ordering my own. (With the great cocktail).  Starting with the fries, se bed with ketchup and awesome horseradish aioli. They are absolutely to die for. And, I hate fries. They are worth a trip. The burger was fabulous, and could be the best in SF. It is that good. I know, I did not order the burger, I just helped Emily eat hers and he fries too. I did order the polenta. Saying that is not enough. The polenta is mixed with mushrooms, covered with greens and shaved Parmesan, and has a poached egg in the middle. The dish may not have been best in city but I loved it. Crunchy, creamy, savory, just beautiful. Loved this part of the meal. \n\nWith all this food we had to have dessert too. My stomach had not exploded yet. I ordered the apple crisp with ice cream and Emily ordered the Vacherin which is coffee ice cream cover with chocolate and a meringue with shaved almonds. Again, my wife ordered well. The coffee ice cram dish was excellent for texture and flavor and satisfaction. Sorry I did not order it. The apple crisp was just not good enough. And there was no crisp. I think it was cobbler. It was ok but really had nothing to recommend it. And, again, not top 100. Sorry. I make apple crisp and it's far better than theirs. I expect better.   We also had coffee which was very good.\n\nI will mention, service was very good, except for surly waiter, the ambiance was active and friendly and I loved that. The interior seems cozy, I like the noise and activity. \n\nI can recommend this place and I want to return. I will certainly get more familiar with the menu and that can only help.", "author": "Bill V."}

The service was terrible and we ended up walking out after being lead to, and left alone at, our table for 15 minutes. We decided we'd see if Marlowe could seat us and, in spite of being completely booked, they found us a table. My husband and I were celebrating our 4 year anniversary and Marlowe went out of their way to accommodate us and make our night special. They immediately decanted our wine and brought us complimentary champagne. We had a great dinner followed by complimentary dessert. The staff at Marlowe was so kind to us, I'm almost tearing up as I write this. The food was solid and we enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the rib eye, which was cooked to perfection. 5 stars for both the food and the service.

We ordered the polenta and the pork chops, to share. \n\nThe pork chops were a huge serving, very juicy, with an even pink all the way through. Loved the collard greens and beans that came with it. \n\nThe polenta was a perfect complementary item as it's not as heavy. The polenta was extremely creamy and rich with the truffle oil and the Parmesan cheese. The arugula is a genius addition as it cuts through the richness to keep the dish from being too cloying and flat. I don't really know if the egg really adds anything to the dish, but I love a poached egg on anything so I'm all for it.\n\nWe came during the heat wave in SF. Remember those two days when it was over 100? We were recommended to sit in the patio because it was much cooler than the inside, which is true. However, me and the couple at the table next to us were eaten alive by mosquitoes? I came home with 4 bites on my arm and another 4 on my foot.

We've been hearing about this burger for ages and needed to go for ourselves. We walk in and was greeted by the hostess and seated immediately (make sure you make reservations). We looked through the menu and decided to get 3 things to share. The baked oysters, bone marrow, and the burger. \nThe baked oysters were good. It tastes like a baked potato but in oyster form. \nThe bone marrow was probably the highlight of the meal for me. It was so rich and delicious. I could not get enough of it. And the salsa that comes with it is the perfect compliment. \nLastly, the burger. They kindly cut it in half for us and put it on two plates. My friend and I both agreed that we enjoyed the fries more than the burger. The burger itself seemed very salty and then the horseradish aioli seems to just overpower the taste of the whole burger. \nI was pretty excited about this restaurant but left a bit disappointed.

Plenty of metered parking on the street.  The space is small, but it was pretty empty when we got there. Definitely did not need a reservation this weekend but not sure how much busier it would be normally. I ordered a gin cocktail, The Juicer, and the husband ordered The Butcher, their version of a Bloody Mary. That gin cocktail is spot on! The spice is fantastic ... perfect way to start a long day of drinking.  The Butcher is a bit smoky for my taste (almost a hint of bbq sauce flavor) but right up the husband's alley. The husband was waffling between the Ruben and the burger, and the waiter said he absolutely had to get the burger, which he claimed they are famous for. I ordered the Anson Mills polenta with mushrooms. As soon as the food came to the table I could smell the truffle in my polenta dish ... so luxurious. The fries came out smoking hot and ultra crispy ... perfect fries. He asked for the burger medium rare, and it came out on the verge of extremely rare but was crazy delicious. The polenta was reminiscent of a few polenta dishes I had in the Italian alps ... very solid dish. I think if the mushrooms were braised a bit longer, their flavor could be richer. The polenta could have been a tiiiiiny but looser, but the dish was still excellent. The parmesan added the perfect salty note. After we finished eating, we ordered one more round of drinks to get our Saturday off to a good start. Would definitely go back and try the Ruben and the thick bacon. $117 out the door for a nice tipsy breakfast for 2.", "author": "Kristen B."}

Lemon, ricotta & house made jam.  I think this ended up being one of my favorite dishes.  That jam!\n\n2) Di Stefano Burrata (to share): one of my friends didn't like it, but she wasn't expecting the fig preserve (bad taste on her).  I thought it was very tasty.  They don't skimp on the burrata.\n\n3) Smoked Dungeness Crab and Rock Shrimp Benedict: was very fresh.  Probably the best of the main courses ordered.  However, there was only ONE benedict.  So little.  What a shame.  Especially at $18.\n\n4) Pork Shank & Potato Hash: This was my dish and I felt it was unmemorable.  I always get so let down by pork hashes I guess. Looked better than it tasted.  Which was a bit heavy.\n\n5) Marlowe Burger: fries were very good and that horseradish aioli was on point.  But the burger itself was whatever.  Truly not the best burger around.\n\nI had their coffee which was not burnt. \n\nService was good.  Vibe was nice for brunch.

We came after a morning of hiking up in Marin County, and we were almost deliriously hungry. Thankfully, I had the foresight to make a reservation, and we were seated promptly. The OJ they had was freshly squeezed, so we all went for some, and didn't look back. I appreciated the bistro-like vibe, and it was very easy to relax after a very active morning.\n\nOur favorites:\n- Burrata on grilled levain with prosciutto, fig preserves: Probably my favorite dish, the bread was grilled perfectly, and each bit had a little bit of sweetness from the honey\n- Pork shank and potato hash: Collard greens were perfectly cooked, and the pork was super tender\n- Marlowe Burger: Solid burger, but not sure why people would call it the best ever. Horseradish aioli was decent\n- Candied bacon: Kinda like what you get at a steakhouse, the bacon was very thick-cut, and perfectly cooked\n- Crab & Rock shrimp benedict: It comes with a lot of greens to make it look like a lot of food. Regardless, it was very filling, and the crab/shrimp both had really great flavors.\n\nService was pretty attentive throughout the meal, except at the very end when it took us about 15 minutes to get our check after asking for it a couple times. Prices are very reasonable for brunch, with the main dishes ranging from $14-18. \n\nEasily one of my new go-tos for brunch in SF. Most everything we had was excellent, and despite the burger not being the world-beater that people said it was, there are plenty of dishes worth coming back for again and again. Plus, you gotta get an extra side of that candied bacon, because it's totally worth it.", "author": "Eric J."}

It's extremely small, quant and pack all the time. \n\nFried Okra: OMG, the seasoning was perfect on the breading for the fried okra.  However, I wish the breading did not be falling out of the okra when you pick it up.  The flavor of the fried okra tasted a little like fried chicken, but when you bite into it, it's a soft and tender okra.  If you love okra, this is the dish you must order.\n\nSmoke Salmon and English Cucumber: Nice refreshing dish that can accompany other heavier appetizers.  The smoke salmon was so fresh that it has no fishy taste at all.  The creme fresh was light and lemony, which went well as a second appetizer to our fried okra.  Unless you're a super fan of smoke salmon, you can skip this dish.\n\nAngus Ribeye: The best ribeye I've ever had!  The aged ribeye was so tender, so well good, so well seasoned!  I got the meat medium and it just melts in my mouth.  The scallop potato on the side was creamy, soft, tender and the best scallop potato ever.  The salad has a lemony dressing that cuts the fattiness of the meat and potato.  If you're up for someone else besides the burger, this is your dish!\n\nDessert: Loretta's Vacherin.

The tables are an elegant solid wood, there's kitchen accouterments hanging from an elegant pot chandelier close to the entryway. \n\nWe started our meal with a delicious sparkling rose and enjoyed the kind patience of our waiter while we debated foods. I was very impressed by the flavor packed selections, though a bit remised that nothing was very veggie heavy. I selected the dungeness crab and rock shrimp benedict, intrigued by how the combination would be presented. I was pleasantly surprised with a seafood filled patty, crusted with cornmeal and lightly pan fried. I was looking for something that wasn't heavily breaded and I think this was a gem- I could distinguish between the rockfish and crab, the textures played very well together and the light dish was overall a total delight. I would definitely try this again. \n\nMy girlfriends tried the truffle polenta which was completely divine and a repeat dish for her. I stole a bite and can vouch that the flavor is elegant, full, and smooth.

We came at noon and luckily had a reservation. If we hadn't, it looked like there would have been a bit of a wait. The service was great but Marlowe seemed to be a bit slower than an in-and-out workday lunch spot. \n\nI'll definitely be back for dinner!", "author": "Katie R."}

It can get a bit cramped since tables are placed near each other.  As expected with a brunch spot, it. \n Service was friendly and not too slow, given how busy it got during brunchtime.  \n\nFood: great American comfort food!  The dishes we got were very rich, and portions tended to be on the bigger side.\n-- Half Dozen Oysters (smoked mignonette and scallion)(MP) - the oysters were a bit small (but maybe because I'm used to large ones on the east coast) but tasty, especially with the mignonette.  The ones we had were a little on the sweeter side and not too briny.  Don't remember the price for these guys, but was probably around $20?\n-- Anson Mills Polenta (wild mushrooms, parmesan, truffle salsa verde & poached farm egg)($16) - super tasty!  I liked how the polenta wasn't super creamy (being lactose intolerant) but still had enough cheese to give it a mild parmesan flavor.  The poached egg worked well in adding more richness to the dish and the mushrooms a great unami/ earthy tone.  This dish was also piled high with arugula to refreshingly contrast with the otherwise heavy meal (and to make me feel less guilty since I'm technically still eating veggies).  Out of necessity to carb load for a half marathon, I managed to finished 3/4th of the plate.  \n-- Marlowe Burger (caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon & horseradish aioli with fries)($17) - my date ordered this one and was nice enough to give me a taste.  Now I understand why this burger is highly recommended by peers!  Super juicy without being too oily and just enough freshness from the horseradish aioli and lettuce to make you temporarily forget how rich this dish is.  Personally not sure if I would have been able to eat one whole burger on my own, but if I did, I'd be one very happy camper.  Fries were nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nEverything came out to around $25-30 per person at most (depends on price for oyster and whether or not you order a drink).  \n\nOverall, very happy with the dishes we ordered and service so that I didn't mind the tight space.  I probably wouldn't come here every single weekend, but when I was a super satisfying brunch, yeah I'd come back and perhaps next time order my own burger.", "author": "Audrey H."}

No other accoutrements and just some super tiny oysters. They were tasty, I admit, but for how much I paid, they shoulda been twice as big (or there should have been twice as many on the plate).\n\nI also ordered the steak tartare which was also fairly pricey for a tiny blob of tartare that was a bit salty, a bit slimey, and without any other flavor or character.\n\nDefinitely not worth going unless you just want a nice cocktail and the Marlowe Burger (which is great and can also be had at their sister restaurant: The Cavalier -- see my review of that place...much better!).", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Came with a group of friends and we all got different dishes, pretty much everything on their lunch/brunch menu. Personally, I tried the burger and the chicken sandwich. The burger was OK, I thought the meat was well cooked and it was average overall. The chicken sandwich was a huge disappointment - the meat was COLD and stale. When I have fried chicken in a sandwich I expect it to be hot and crispy, there was also no flavor whatsover to the dish - it was bread and stale chicken pretty much. Fries were delicious, I believe they use kennebec potatoes - only thing that was redeeming, which is really sad. \n\nService was pretty spotty, the servers were very pushy to get us to order when we got to the table and after taking our orders was never to be seen again.

I came here with a group of four on Sunday evening after watching a show at AT&T park, and we were seated right away with our reservation. The menu is relatively small, but there were so many enticing food and drink options! The d\u00e9cor is pretty as well, though the restaurant is relatively small and can get crowded.\n\nWe started off our meal by sharing a few appetizers. First, we had the burrata, which came on toast with prosciutto and greens. The toast was perfectly warm, crispy, yet thick, and provided the perfect contrast to the cool, soft cheese. Delicious! We also had the steak tartare with a poached quail egg--this dish had a very strong flavor of Worcestershire sauce and had just the right amount of spice/kick! Finally, we had the bone marrow, which came with grilled baguettes, salsa verde, and cilantro. While I'm not the hugest bone marrow fan, I did appreciate this dish for its decadent, silky texture and deep flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the famous Marlowe burger, and it was definitely my favorite dish of the night! The burger came on a soft bun and had the perfect amount of crispy bacon and creamy aioli on the inside; this was perhaps one of the best gourmet burgers I've had, and the fries that came on the side were also unbelievably crispy and flavorful (though make sure to eat them when they're still warm!). We told the waiter that three of us were splitting the burger, and it was even cut up for us before it was brought to our table! Such a nice touch. In addition to the burger, I also had the black cod entr\u00e9e--the fish was nice and flaky, and the accompanying vegetables and potatoes were delicious as well, but the real kicker was the coconut broth the dish came with, which had great flavor and was perfect for dipping with bread.\n\nNothing on the dessert menu jumped out at me, so I skipped, but overall, Marlowe was a fantastic restaurant with well-prepared, well-executed dishes. The service was quick, but my only complaint was that our waiter didn't seem to know the menu particularly well.

However, it turned out it wasn't served straight up like one with think of a traditional burrata but instead it was spread on f.o.u.r. slices of thick bread. This made the portion massive and for my friend who never had burrata before there was no chance he got to experience how the inside would run down on the plate when making a cut on the soft cheese...\n\nAs a main, we went with black cod. Chef had prepared it with plenty of cream in the sauce and that was also where all the flavors were. It was alright. We had it with a serving of brussels crisps which again was tasty but way too greasy.\n\nIn summary, this is not a good place for food. If you're after a cocktail and some people watching, I'd consider.

Also, get some extra bread to enjoy the oil that drips down from the marrow. Dip it and enjoy..\nMarlowe Burger: their namesake burger is very tasty and well made. Both of us were sharing the burger so they actually cut the burger into halves as they brought it to us. As others have mentioned, it was slightly on the saltier side for me also. But, if you like it slightly salty then this is definitely for you. The fries with the burger were very good, thin cut and crispy. \nBeer Battered Asparagus: deep fried asparagus with spicy aioli. You can't go wrong with it. I would recommend having this before the dishes with so much flavor as it is more basic in taste.

Service was super friendly! We didn't get our waitress's name but she was SO lovely and attentive and definitely contributed to a great dinner experience.\n\nI came with a friend and we got the steak tartare and burrata to start, and shared the eponymous Marlowe burger. \n\nThe steak tartare had a nice texture and had a subtle kick to it. It was topped with a poached egg, which was fine, but it was difficult to mix together since the whites were cooked. Still tasty all around but not exceptional compared to other places.\n\nWe loved the burrata and burger! Firstly, the burrata was BEAUTIFUL. It was more like a tartine than a ball of burrata that most restaurants serve. The crusty wheat bread that was surprisingly savory, topped with really creamy and fresh burrata, beautiful heirloom tomatoes, a balsamic reduction, some microgreens, and sea beans. The seabeans seemed a bit disjointed from the dish but it was still SO GOOD.\n\nThe burger was phenomenal--the bun looked a bit weirdly like Safeway bakery bread but it worked well with the burger. Didn't notice too much of the cheese and onions (definitely saw they were there) but maybe the flavors just paired well together? Fries were delicious (but I mean, all fries are), and the garlic aoli was really addictive.\n\nWe split the blueberry trifle for dessert. The cream element was subtly moscato flavored but was a bit runny for my liking. Flavors were good but I wish the consistency was less liquidly. There was some nice crunch from the cookie crumble topping and I just wish there was more of it.\n\nFor drinks, they had a nice sweeter white option (the chenin blanc) which was fruity and floral. The cocktails looked beautiful too, especially the lavender one!", "author": "Tina X."}

From start to finish, I have nothing but great things to say about this gem of a place. Having been bookmarked for ages, I FINALLY got a chance to come thru w/my bf for dinner for our 3.5 year anni! Initially nervous that I needed reservations, I was surprised that we got seated right away. It was a bustling weeknight for a restaurant that's hidden in a corner of a rather silent neighborhood. (That's how you know it must be good!) \n\nAtmosphere - Intimate, the type of place to have a niiiice dinner with a friend or a date (a little on the loud side, but not ridiculous) The bar area was beautifully lit and I love the decor. The lights may be leftover from Christmas but it's still very pretty. I love the imprint of the cows w/the type of cuts in the bathroom haha.\n\nService - Incomparable! Our server (and the servers in general) are all so attentive and great. Between each meal, they change the plates and utensils and give the table a wipe down. Water is always filled. You'll never be thirsty and you'll never have to flag someone down. Such service, much happy.\n\nFo0o0od! - Reasonable and Delicious! We ordered Steak Tartare, Bone Marrow, Ribeye steaks, and Vanterin (?) Are the starters worth it? Absolutely! You can tell they put a lot of thought in their food. Passionate chefs make amazing food. Steak Tartare is served with a poached quail egg on top a bed of arugula and crisp crostini. You get 2 bone marrows with a side of seasoned cilantro, capers, and fresh, warm crostini. Bone marrow, melt in your mouth buttery. Most of it has dripped onto the little cast iron bowl, but just soak it up with the bread. Ribeye, Holy Proportion! Huge, tender, moist piece of perfect medium rare steak atop a bed of greens and porcini mushrooms and 2 small truffled baked potatoettes. You can immediately smell the umami from the dish and everything complemented each other well. Whatever dessert was, was also muy bueno. Originally wanting the apple crisp, (they ran out), I was not disappointed w/this choice. Coffee ice cream on top of a light meringue crisp drowned in chocolate and almonds. My stomach thanks me.\n\nTL; DR why are you still reading? GO! :)", "author": "Emily M."}

We ordered the cripsy brussel sprouts since everyone recommended it on Yelp. It had a nice crispy texture but the bitter aftertaste was not my favorite. The baked oysters were also highly recommended but was on the saltier side. I did not particularly enjoy it even though I normally love any kind of of oyster dish.

The Benny was totally disappointing, with the shrimp and smoked cod totally lost in breading and a fully cooked egg. The chicken sandwich was alright. The veg omelette look curiously deep fried.

Served warm, the cheese, bacon and filling complimented each other well. Neither of us had ever had bone marrow, and we weren't disappointed. It was a rich flavor and paired perfectly with the salsa verde and herbs. My husband had the Blacksmith and it was a very good mixture of flavors. You could taste the sweet and the pepper.

They were nice enough to get us drinks and an appetizer while we waited to be seated. My kids shared the cheeseburger and I had the appetizer salad. It sounded light and had avocado on it so I thought it would be lovely. When it came out I mentioned that it was not to my liking and I asked if I could please get some cheese to add to it. The woman helping up behind the bar was DEFINITELY OFFENDED. She scoffed and let me know SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCRAMBLE TOGETHER SOME GOAT CHEESE. She went straight back to the kitchen, which was in my direct line of sight, and bickered with the kitchen staff about how absurd I was within earshot of myself, my kids and everyone at the bar. \nMind you this seems to be a cute, upscale, hipster place that by all other accounts I loved. Between the three of us we had 7 drinks, 1 app, 1 app salad and 1 meal. Overall it was a 3-4 out of 5. But the way the bartender had such an attitude when I said I didn't care for the salad was surprising. I was in the business for 15 yrs. The first thing you do is say no problem. Let me take care of that for you. Can I get you something else?? I was so hungry. I would have tried another salad or a steak. She could have upsold me anything!!!!! I could have stayed and spent another $200. Instead, I tipped 35% told her I didn't care for it at all and I left. I had tried to rectify the salad with some simple parmesan cheese slices and that sent her into offended red rashes all over. It was as if how dare I question the menu?!?!?! Newsflash dolls I think you can be fabulous but never underestimate your client. It's not hard to make someone happy. Most of the time they don't care what it costs. 100% lifetime customers 100% perfect reviews", "author": "Heidi P."}

The brunch cocktails were excellent, especially their take on a spicy bloody.\n\nThe sides were delicious, both the Brussels sprouts chips and the Nueske bacon. The best thing though, by far, was the grilled asparagus. The chorizo, the poached egg, the texture of the asparagus - great combination.\n\nThe big fail though, and the reason this isn't five stars, was the polenta. If you read the Yelp reviews or listen to the servers, the polenta is the thing to get. In reality, it was a plate of bland polenta with over-truffled toppings. Seriously, so much truffle. It's the risk with truffles these days - everyone does it, and often way too heavily.\n\nAll in all though, an excellent brunch spot. The cocktails and food were delicious, just skip the polenta unless you're looking for a (heavy) truffle fix.", "author": "Mike M."}

The bacon was super crispy and the fried chicken coating had so much crispy snap to them. The horseradish aioli complimented the fries perfectly! Go ahead and spread it on the buns as well! This goes for $15\n\nI also suggest ordering the French toast soldiers which are simple bars of rectangle shaped French toast with two dipping sauces; maple syrup and Mexican chocolate. This is for $9\n\nFor a cocktail, I recommend the Baker or Baker's wife. Both have grapefruit juice but have different sugars and bitters.

The dim lighting at night complement well with the bar lighting and countertops. Decided to come here on a saturday night. The wait was not long at all as I was expecting something much longer. Got seated in about 15 minutes at the bar. Not sure whether the tables require reservations or not, but the host said that only bar seating was available although I saw many tables open. \n\nThe bartender was extremely friendly and professional. Generally, I expect less service when sitting at the bar due to the sheer volume of duties bar tenders are required to complete, however, our bar tender was extremely attentive. \n\nFood however, has room for improvement. The burger was decent, but portion sizes are a bit small. The pork chop size was decent, but was on the dry side. \n\nMarlowe is a nice joint if you just want to get some drinks and socialize in a place with pretty decor, but I probably wouldn't recommend getting the food here as it's pretty overpriced and small portioned.", "author": "Scott K."}

My driver was new in town in the hunt for the best burgers in the Bay. Another passenger without hesitation said, \"Marlowe, hands down.\" \n\nSo when my friend recommended eating dinner at Marlowe a few weeks later, I did not hesitate. I ordered The Gardener--a nice cocktail that pairs well with meat, a perfect compliment. \n\nI ordered my burger ($16) medium rare. When it arrived it had it all--perfectly cooked bacon, toasted bun, melted cheese, a bit of shredded lettuce, and aioli. I prefer mayo on burgers instead of ketchup, so it was quickly winning me over. I took one bite and the burger melted in my mouth. Best life decision I've ever made. \n\nThe meal is on the high end, especially for a burger, but it was delicious! My friend was in a rush to go home, so I took half of the burger to go. It heated up well in the microwave (25 second). \n\nI highly recommend Marlowe. It's in a rougher part of Brannan St., so just be aware when traveling there. Great place to go with a friend or date. Mains are in the $16-$35 range.", "author": "Joanna S."}

Not sure it was worth the price.  I originally wanted to get the burger,  since i\"d heard so much about it, but they only serve it with one kind of aioli, and it's a HORSERADISH aioli, which is not a flavor I like whatsoever.  No option for plain mayo (what they hell do they make their aioli with then??)\n\n2) Noise -- Because it's so crowded it's also really really noisy. You basically have to yell to be heard.\n\n3) Space -- they pack you in, so i hope you don't mind being knocked by people packing big purses as they pass by.  Also, the staff puts your wine bottle on the edge of the table which made me nervous it'd be knocked off he entire time.\n\nAll in all, can't say i'd rush back for a sit down meal, but I'd go back for a drink at the bar.", "author": "Tobin S."}

Otherwise, it wasn't super crowded but the restaurant is small so you might have to eat at the bar if you don't want to wait for a table.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It's fairly narrow, when you walk in there's a few communal high tables on the right hand side and then the bar area.  There are regular tables for 2 or 4 people that either have marble tops or regular tops.  There must be a room in the back because we saw people going back there, they probably have a private room available.  The tables are fairly close together so be prepared for that.  The inside reminds me of something you would see in Boston or somewhere in New England.  It definitely has a trendy vibe, bright, casual but still able to be fancy if you want to dress up.  \n\nFOOD: Got the deviled egg appetizer and the brussels sprout chips. \n\nDEVILED EGG - pretty good, I'm not the hugest fan of deviled eggs but it had a nice taste to it. It was a little salty though.\n\nBRUSSEL SPROUT CHIPS - you know when you get brussel sprouts and they have the really good oily pieces that are super tasty? Those are pretty much the brussell sprout chips.  If you don't like greasy veggies then you won't like it.  But for me it was really tasty, they aren't as crispy as chips but do have a crisp texture to them.  \n\nPORK CHOP - I'm beginning to realize that I'm not a fan of pork chop.  First of all this dish was HUGE, they pretty much give you 2 large pieces of pork chop plus the mashed potatoes underneath and the veggies.  The veggies were these sprouts almost like a salad.  The other good thing was the avocado sauce/blend that they put on top to help cut through the heaviness of the pork chop.\n\nMy sister got the steak, which was really good and she said it was one of the better steaks she's had in a while.\n\nIf I didn't get the pork chop I would've tried the burger - it was simple, a classic with basic toppings but very tasty.  The fries were also on the skinnier side and very very good.  Slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  \n\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion.", "author": "Brittany T."}

Someone had fun with the mandolin- everything was ribbons! Very crunchy. The burrata was like bruschetta and a heavy appetizer, not what I imagined. The gratin was cheesy deliciousness. But one bite had crystals of salt. Otherwise perfect. I would get this again for sure.\nFor the main course, we all got burgers. They were good but not the best I've ever had.

So my bf and I had tried making reservations online for Friday night but according to OpenTable, they were all booked out. This was for Friday evening, btw. However, my bf tried calling them the day of and it turns out they still had tables available in their outdoor patio area. So always try calling even if you have no luck with the online reservations! We actually really enjoyed the patio area. It's a small patio in the back of the restaurant, away from the noisiness of the main dining area. We got there at 6:15pm, and we had the whole place to ourselves until 7pm when other parties started rolling in. It's pretty quiet back there (only 4 tables or so), and the whole area has a garden-like vibe. Super cute!\n\nOur waitress did a great job walking us through the menu. They had a special cocktail in honor of SF Pride, so I went with that, and it was delicious! Can't remember the name, but it was very citrus-y, light, and refreshing. \n\nAs for food:\n\n- Deviled Eggs: These come at $3 a pop, but it's so worth it, trust me! The egg yolk is seasoned perfectly, and combined with that bacon wrap, mmm mmm, so good! Eat it all in one bite so you really get a taste of all the flavors combined. Great appetizer to start off your meal.\n\n- Bone Marrow: This was another appetizer dish, and omg I loved it!! The bone marrow had so much flavor, and went perfectly with the bread/sauce/greens that came with the dish. Highly recommend this dish as well.\n\n- Salted pistachios: So we didn't actually order these. It was a gift on the house because they had forgotten to put in our order. Wait time wasn't too bad, but we appreciated the thought! These were....salty, lol. My bf really liked them. Said they had good flavor but he agreed that they were on the salty side. I'd pass on these...\n\n- Burger: So our waitress told us that this burger is the best in the city...Not sure if I agree with that, but it's definitely up there. The meat was perfectly medium rare and had a ton of flavor. Really liked the sauce they used on the burger as well. The fries were great--they had just the right texture. Solid dish overall. Not my favorite, but it was good.\n\n- Polenta: My bf decided to go with this vegetarian entr\u00e9e. It was surprisingly filling! A very hearty dish. There's no meat, but the mushrooms that they use in this dish are quite...meaty, haha. The poached egg on top of the dish adds the perfect touch--be sure to break it right away so that the yolk can blend in with the rest of the dish. So good! I'd choose this over the burger any day. \n\nOur final bill came out to be around $85 or so, which really isn't bad considering all the food that we ordered. The service here is great and the food is fantastic. Will definitely be returning.", "author": "Ashley Y."}

Furthermore, new developments surrounding the venue indicates that the area isn't a \"bad place\" per se, and it is highly likely that it was a fluke incident and that with due time the area will be a thriving high-maintenance location just blocks away from Caltrain. Either way, thank you @ Marlowe staff.", "author": "Khaled H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-03", "description": "My first experience dining at Marlowe was a few years back, which I barely remember now so I'm unable to share the details of my dinner experience. Luckily, my mission to find the best burger in the bay has offered a new opportunity to review Marlowe's raved about sandwich and weekend brunch experience!\n\nFor context, my BF and I have two burger joints that we love: Hopdoddy Burger Bar (Austin) and Shake Shack (NY). So, we're basing our ratings off those flavor experiences and we're starting from scratch (as some of our favorites have changed over the years). If you're not a fan of either of those, you should probably stop reading this review as I don't want to waste your time.\n\nWe ordered:\nTWO Marlowe burgers\nAnchor for me\nSculpin IPA for him\n\nWe're rating the following 5 criteria on a scale of 1 to 5 (low to high) and only including the cheeseburger.\n\nOverall consistency: 5\nThe biggest challenge of a big, juicy cheeseburger is holding everything together bite after bite. The bread that Marlowe uses for their burger is surprisingly able to accomplish this (see photo of my last bite... hehe) The bread is soft and the burger is easy to hold. It's not so huge that I can't take a solid bite from top to bottom but it's a mouthful (that's what she said... beat you to it) Every bite is perfect because it's able to maintain its structure and hold all the ingredients in.\n\nBurger meat: 5\nMedium rare and cooked to perfection. Thick but manageable meat patty that's juicy and flavorful without too much of a mess. The flavor of the meat is dang delicious.\n\nOverall flavor: 5\nWe think having bacon in anything is a major hack but in this case, it wasn't too overpowering. It added a nice crunchy yet chewy texture that complimented the squishiness of the bread and meat. The caramelized onions were a perfect flavor addition as was the side of horseradish aioli (which it didn't need but it sure as hell was a party in my mouth with it)\n\nPrice: 4\nI get that it's a gourmet burger in an ever-increasingly expensive town. In comparison to places like Hopdoddy's or even Godfather's where their huge portions help justify the price, it's about $2-$3 more expensive. Take the deviled eggs for instance. They are DANG GOOD but it's $3 for half an egg. Just some context of price to portion at this joint. It's more upscale, for sure.\n\nPresentation: 5\nClassic. A perfectly put-together burger with a side of french fries and ketchup. There's nothing intimidating about it and it's very easy to manage. The sad part is... the final bite. All good things must come to an end.\n\nWe're still early on our burger hunt but we can say with confidence that the Marlowe burger is our winner thus far.\n\nNOTE: On the weekends, they stop serving brunch at 2:30. Their bar menu goes from 2:30-5:30 and then dinner goes from then until closing. If you're coming for the burger, you have nothing to worry about. It's on every menu! We were getting rushed to order before brunch ended but later realized that it didn't matter. :-)", "author": "Kat C."}

I decided to walk bc it was day time. I'm not from San Francisco so I didn't realize that here was a huge homeless population here. I experienced that walking to Marlowe for lunch on Sunday. Homeless people were everywhere, even in tents along the side walks getting to Marlowe. So my first impression was that this restaurant was really small but cozy. I would estimate that they can handle about 40-60 customers at a time. It seems as though this was one of those places that your would need reservations ahead of time due to he limited seating. We just walked in and asked for a table for 4, hostess told us that we could either sit at the bar (which only had 3 seats open at that time and they weren't all together...) or wait. Then she said all of their tables have reservations and that it was booked :/ that time. Well I guess they had an opening or something bc we ended up getting a table for 4. And we are sooooo thankful. The food here is awesome. I loved everything that I had. The fries were all seasoned perfectly and crunchy. I would def order the poached egg with crab salad again.", "author": "Ciara N."}

The table was set and ready upon our arrival (Open Table reservation), and the server staff was incredibly attentive, passionate and knowledgeable throughout the evening.\n\nWe chose the fried okra for our appetizer. Being a southerner, I loved it. The brussel sprout chips also were addicting. Being a burger connoisseur, I had to have the famous burger. It perhaps was my favorite burger of 2016. It was the perfect blend of meats, charcoal grilled goodness and simple condiments. \n\nMy only gripe -- and please just go ahead and call me unclassy or a fatty -- is that I love mayo with my burgers, and they would not accommodate my request. It was their homemade aioli or nothing (one of my huge pet peeves because it feels snobby to me, and not customer-centric). \n\nThe cocktails and the wine were excellent too -- I particularly loved the Hot Toddy, but of course, my name is Todd. The bill was reasonable for our group, and we all went away happy.", "author": "Todd B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "description": "3.5 star rating.\n\nMarlowe has been on my radar for a long time, so I was super excited to drop by today (4/27) for lunch. I was able to get 12:30 p.m. reservations via their site on Monday, which was great because the place was packed when we arrived. It was also Giants game day, so that probably boosted business just a tad.\n\nI arrived a couple minutes early, but they seated me even though my friend was still finding parking. Very nice; although I understand the idea of having the whole party there before seating, it's also annoying. So props to Marlowe!\n\nThe restaurant is so bright and welcoming thanks to all the huge windows, love it! The decor is nice and clean, too. As soon as I sat down, someone came around to offer me water. It's also superrrrrrr loud inside since everyone's all into their conversations. The tables are pretty close to one another, which means you will hear your neighbors and they will hear you. \n\nService was average, but it could've been because they were so busy. The server came by to see if I wanted to get anything to drink when I sat down, but my friend wasn't there yet so I said I'd wait. When my friend arrived, it took 10+ minutes for someone to come by and get him some water. (After that though, they were very attentive with water.) Then it was a couple more minutes before the server came by to take our order. I understand that it was partially our fault since not everyone was there, but still. =/\n\nSo the food. Food food food. We shared the crispy Brussels sprout chips, which came out super quick. I'm not sure if the chips are supposed to be so bitter, but they were. The lemon and sea salt was a great combo, but the bitterness was a bit too much. It might've been that they were ordered over-fried =/ I had the Marlowe Burger, medium, with fries. Oh man, that horseradish aioli! So good! Fries were also good. As for the burger, it was good -- nothing super special in my opinion. The patty was good perfectly medium, so it was good. There's so much hype around the burger, but I felt like it was just a burger. Yes, other restaurants have shittier burgers, but I'm not sure what warrants a $16 price tag on the Marlowe one. \n\nMy friend has the Open Faced Deviled Egg Sandwich, and he had such a hard time eating it haha The provolone on top was so hard from being toasted that he couldn't cut it. He tried eating it as is rather than cutting into it, and the egg salad was falling out all over the place. I personally thought it was a very small portion -- you get one slice of bread that's maybe 3x3 inches topped with what's essentially egg salad. I don't know about you, but that's very meh to me. \n\nI'm not down on Marlowe, but I was expecting something more wow? Maybe a dinner experience will be different.", "author": "Doris K."}

I've seen Marlowe on so many lists of places to eat in San Francisco and yelpers raving about this place.\n\nThe verdict? I can honestly say the Marlowe burger is one of the best things I have eaten in San Francisco so far.\n\nWith a party of four, the hostess said there was a 2 hour wait for regular seating, but she let us know that there was no wait at outdoor patio seating. It was cold outside so we were a little hesitant. We thought we would check it out anyway because of the...No wait? Dope. She led us to the back to a cozy little room. It was more illuminated than the main seating and with more elbow room. The whole restaurant was quite dim. I like the ambience in this back room as it was very earthy and comfortable. They had space heaters so the temperature was fine.\n\nService was great, the waiter was very informed about the menu. He gave his suggestions and let us know what were the most popular items. A plus is the observant water service. Again, I'm so glad I got the famous Marlowe burger with fries and that amazing horseradish-aioli dip. We also ordered the bone marrow with baguette, duck liver mousse, deviled eggs, and pork chop. There is no other word to describe the bone marrow than exquisite (that's as classy as it gets). It was my first time eating bone marrow and it has a a delicious and rich flavor on the saltier side. The mousse had interesting texture (also my first time trying this) but it was good. I couldn't eat too much of it though. Deviled eggs were excellent. The pork chops were a huge portion and came with collard greens and grits-- all the flavors married. We split everything in fours so we could try everything. Great idea to make the most of this dining experience. \n\nI will definitely come back some time for the lunch menu. I highly recommended Marlowe. (Try the burger!)", "author": "Jaime F."}

We had 5:45pm reservations but the traffic from Apple's WDC getting out around the same time was insane. We called to let them know we would be about 5-10 minutes late and when we go there our table was ready and being held.\n\nThe wait staff was great and our drink orders were taken immediately after we sat down. Everyone had beer as well as the Brussel Sprout chips (addicting!), the liver mouse, the burrata and the deviled eggs. The eggs were fantastic with a nice jalape\u00f1o on top some thick cut bacon (just an awesome combination with a deviled egg).\n\nFor the main courses (see photos) we had the ribeye steak which was very flavorful and cooked medium rare per our order, and the pork chop.  Both were very good.  The place was completely full by 6:30pm.\n\nWe decided to go for the peanut butter bites for dessert which were little frozen squares of peanut butter and chocolate goodness (almost like a Reese's peanut butter cup flavor.  Since I love Reese's and anything chocolate with peanut butter, this was a good score for dessert.\n\nThe espresso was good, served very hot like it should be.  If you want to eat at a place with a good vibe, good food with unique starters (next time I am getting the bone marrow!), then this is a place to definitely put on the list to check out.\n\n4 stars.", "author": "Jay G."}

Bar menu vs full menu\nYelp only tells us they are open for service. We arrived there at 3 pm. It was bad because we didn't know they'd only serve the bar menu, which is limited in choice until 5.30. We ate nick nacks and waited for whopping 2.5 hours to eat what we came for, which was the bone marrow. \n\n2. Food was not good\nI think this restaurant is doing some sort of social experiment. They charge high prices for not really edible food just to see whether you'd pretend to like it because you wanna look hip or cultured.\nLet me explain this using 1 dish they have. During that long 2.5 hours, we tried literally everything they offered on their bar menu, so I feel\nQualified to draw conclusions since I at least tried everything they offered. \n\n- crispy Brussels sprout chips \nI like Roasted Brussels sprouts in general and I wasn't sure what to expect of the chips though. \nThey serve it with the little dessert fork. Good luck picking those chips with that!\nEven your fingers can hardly pick it. This dish is salty as hell, burnt as hell and can only be eaten if you literally let the \"chips\" stick to your tongue,'yes I mean you need to lick it off of your plate or let it stick.\n\n- oysters: okay this dish was good unlike the burnt aka crispy Brussels sprouts. \n\n- warm deviled egg: we ordered two and guess what we got? 1 egg!!! They cut it in half and call it two and charge like $3 per half an egg! \nTold you they were doing a social experiment, really trying to see how you'd react! \n\n- jumbo shrimp: it was just meh, I tried better ones and this place really like to burn things. Won't recommend.\n\n- burger: for $16 is it wrong of me to expect to get a decent burger, at least not half of a burger? Who ate the other half of my burger? \n\n3. Actual food from the real menu\n\nBone marrow: this was the very item we came for and after waiting for long we finally got it.\nIt's served with as much as 6 pieces of bread. Guess what? You won't need 5 of those. \nYou just buy one giant bone! Where the hell\nIs the bone marrow? Not the bone?! \n\nA good chef can choose it right so that it'll have enough bone marrow to eat. What a disappointment?! \n\n4. Cocktails: was okay though. \n\n5. Service: for whatever reason, our table had 3 different servers. Servers change suddenly.", "author": "Bella J."}

Please be aware that the soda drink  ($5) is charged individually, which means it has no refill. I was charged $15 for just regular soda. I know it was part of my fault for not checking if it was refillable, but the way that the staff asked was easily interpreted as the soda refill was free. In addition, the staff forgot about my third refill. By the time they remembered, we were ready to leave. However, the waiter insisted on getting us the refill. It turned out that I ended up paying for all the refill. It just left us with a bitter taste in the end.", "author": "Maple C."}

They just taste like crispy  brussel sprouts.\n\nNext I had the ciopinno, but it was short of fish. The ciopinno dish had small shreds of crab, plenty  of clams and two quarters of a scallop. For this to be a ciopinno dish, it was quite lacking. However, the sauce was delicious and quite flavorful. \n\nThe burger was something people were raving about so we also got that, but the patty wasn't good. It had a gamey taste and it was overly salted. I was pretty disappointed with the burger, but the fries were delicious. \n\nOverall, I think that this place definitely has potential and I would come back here to try it again. The flavors are there, but it is missing a bit of the execution.", "author": "Linette F."}

Come with a group so you can get dishes to share!\n\nWe started with the warm kale salad, which in my opinion is a must! Warm, garlicky, and with a perfectly runny poached egg on top. Enough to split! \n\nI would probably pass on the French toast soldiers a second time around. It was still good and comes with two dipping sauces - coffee and chocolate. There was something off about the consistency of the chocolate sauce...it was a little bit thicker than desired, almost as if they had added marshmallow or too much corn starch. Still yummy, but a little bit odd. We were debating between the doughnuts and the French toast - there was a little bit regret after we saw doughnuts arrive at the table next door. \n\nThe mushroom polenta was a little bit out of my comfort zone but I've been a sucker for poached eggs lately - it was fantastic! The mushrooms were delicious and I always love a good serving of shaved parmesan. I got a side of bacon for a little serving of meat and a side of maple syrup - which was a great call! Disclaimer, if you are into thick cut chewy bacon, this will not be for you. Lucky for me I dig crunchy bacon, so this was perfect.\n\nAlso heard great things about burger!

It's my husband's birthday, and he was craving for a good burger. Verdict is that the marlowe burger didn't disappoint, but he said it's not the best burger he ever had. I am in love with their devil eggs, and baked oysters. Husband killed my polenta when it was served. We both love it. Flavorful and full of texture. A tad salty, but I love it. The service is top notch.  The hostess sat us down immediately though we were 15 mins early. The servers kept checking on us even though they were pretty busy.  They served us with a surprise dessert with a birthday candle on the side when I simply asked for a birthday note on the table when I made the reservation. \nOn a separate note, their dinner menu starts at 530pm. Some of the mains are not available before that, but you can still order the Marlowe burger. :)", "author": "Jasmine H."}

Luckily there was some open seats at the bar so we didn't have to wait.\n\nWe ordered a half dozen oysters (it's never too early for oysters, right?), deviled eggs, and crab toast with poached egg to share. Everything was delicious! For my entree I ordered the burratta tartine. It had candied bacon, which makes anything extra tasty! Then for dessert (because who can go without dessert? Not me, that's for sure!) we got the french toast soldiers which came with two different sauces. I'm all about the coffee creme because I'm the hugest fan of anything coffee flavored, but the Mexican hot chocolate was delicious as well.\n\nAfter such a delicious brunch experience, we're very excited to make a reservation for dinner some time.

Seating is pretty limited for how popular it is, so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation. Service is so friendly and polite yet the ambience definitely creates a yuppy vibe. \n\nHaving heard so much of the Marlowe burger, my dad and I decided to order that along with the warm kale and Brussels sprouts salad. The salad comes with three crisps of crouton bread and slices of Parmesan cheese. I wish I knew the dressing the salad was in but it's creamy and not too overwhelming. The portion is small,  but like I said earlier, I would take the time to indulge in every bite! The Marlowe burger comes with a choice of fries or salad, but I'd recommend getting the fries.

We made a reservation and showed up about 30 minutes earlier. The restaurant itself is pretty small and in a squat building that you could totally overlook. It was mostly full, but we got seated immediately at a booth. It's noisy in there, and the tables are very crowded together, so careful where you go in case you knock down some unaware diner's food. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the oysters, bone marrow, brussels sprouts chips, Marlowe burger, and pork chops. I love bone marrow, but I should probably stop ordering it at every restaurant that serves it... Either way, the bone marrow here was delicious. Our waiter recommended scraping our bread along the bottom of the pan to catch the oil that had leaked out, which sounds really gross and unhealthy but is totally worth it. The oysters were yum. They tasted of the sea. Super fresh, so it was okay that market price that day was $18. The brussels sprouts chips were... interesting. They were really heavily salted, and even that wasn't enough to hide the bitterness of the brussels sprouts. The texture was good, but I can confidently say I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts. \n\nThe Marlowe burger was just a burger. If you've read my reviews, you know my opinion towards overpriced burgers and fast food, but I thought we'd give it a try considering the hype. The waiter was nice enough to split it in half for my friend and me without asking. What really stole the show were the pork chops. O M G. Get the pork chops. I've never had pork chops this tender in my life. Seriously. At one point, I was just gnawing meat off the bone. Yes, I'm a savage. Check came out to be around $100.", "author": "Sophie W."}

Obviously, being the food freak that I am I decided to check it out on yelp first, duh! Everything checked out, solid 4 stars, 2000 reviews, beautiful food pics, etc. So at that point I was already sold and excited to head there.\n\nIt was a Friday night around 7 so of course we called first to see if we needed to reserve a spot and they told us we could try our luck in the next couple minutes for a seat at the bar (all tables were booked). So we rushed there and the bar was actually full but we did get this really cute seat at a sort of window counter near the entrance which I honestly loved, it was really private and we love people watching so it was perfect for us.\n\nWe finally got to ordering our wine, apps and mains and as everything came I just kept getting more and more impressed!! I got the Brut Ros\u00e9 and he got the Syrah and both were amazingly fresh. For appetizers we got the smoked crab and rock shrimp poppers with a spicy hollandaise sauce and it had the nicest crunchiest texture and nicely put together flavours. It IS somewhat filling so if you don't have a huge appetite I'd probably skip it. We also got some baked oysters and seriously they were a delicacy. For our mains, I went with the Anson Mills Polenta and he got the Marlowe Burger cooked medium well. The polenta knocked my socks off, truly. Could not ask for a better blend of flavours and textures. Now I didn't try the burger because I don't eat meat but apparently the patty was real nice and cooked to perfection. However, my man felt like the horseradish sauce was sort of overpowering! He said something that really made me laugh, he has really bad seasonal allergies and he told me \"It's great though it's like my nose keeps getting cleared over and over with every single bite!!\". Which was funny but let's face it, it can get tiring after a while but I'm glad he kept the humour angle going. \n\nI was really impressed with our waitress when she provided us with full table service, which I haven't seen often in SF. She did all the Do's and none of the Don't's which I'm very familiar with, as I've worked in 5 star restaurants myself. The only thing that kind of bothered me was that, because we are really young, higher quality restaurants tend to take us less seriously and demonstrate subtle condescending undertones when they speak to us, which I'm really sensitive to and our waitress went there once or twice. I was able to overlook it but I really hope she brings the judgment level down a little notch, as she doesn't know our walk of life... \n\nSadly, we couldn't get dessert as we were utterly stuffed! But overall this is a 5 star quality restaurant with 5 star quality service, food, ambiance and cleanliness.\n\nNo doubt in my mind we'll be back sooner than later! \n\nPS: Sorry for the novel :)", "author": "Emilie P."}

It was good. Nothing too fancy. A flavorful, medium-rare, ground beef burger with a little bit of grease with a simple layer of cheddar cheese, a couple of slices of bacon, some fresh lettuce, and a nice bun that holds it all together. By itself, a good classic burger, but this is different because of its horseradish aioli. It gives you a strong kick, right in the mayonnaise and works very well with the classics. It also works very well with their fries (which are also quite good). My dilemma was actually finding enough of this aioli to fit on each bite of my burger AND my fries. The whole thing is greasy, but not too greasy (I like greasy) with a flavor new to the burger game.\n\nThe decor is clean and has its own style. Servers and friendly and attentive. Other parts of the menu also intrigued me like their open faced deviled egg sandwich. I'll come back to try it out at some point. And as long as close to $20 a burger is acceptable to you, then I suggest you try it too.", "author": "Bryant C."}

I don't work too far from Marlowe, but had never been there till recently because it always seemed pretty crowded. Recently I was able to grab a seat at the bar though, and had a fairly nice experience though nothing spectacular. \n\nThe menu isn't too big, with a few appetizers, some smaller plates (\"bites\"), and then a few entrees and sides. A lot of the starters and bites sounded good (the duck liver mousse, warm Caesar toast, steak tartare, roasted bone marrow are all things I definitely considered ordering) but since their burger seems to be pretty popular, I went with that. I did start with the deviled eggs which were okay but not what I consider to be deviled eggs since they were more like just hard boiled eggs with bacon and cheese. \n\nThe burger was good, but not amazing. I did appreciate that they cooked it exactly medium as I asked- a lot of places around San Francisco have seemed incapable of cooking my burger to my preferred temperature so this was a big plus. I love bacon on my burger usually but here I actually found it to take away from the burger a little, especially because the bacon was just a tad overcooked. The horseradish aioli did add a nice tang but it seemed to not be consistently spread and so parts of my burger had more (those parts were definitely better) while other parts had almost none. The burger was definitely on the salty side as well. The fries it came with were really good- crispy and perfectly seasoned. \n\nI also had a couple cocktails. The cocktails on their menu were not super interesting to me, and I ordered one but was not a big fan of it (they did have a couple of special cocktails of the day which sounded better but I didn't try those). Since nothing on the menu sounded interesting, I also ordered an old fashioned. This was well made and I would definitely order it again. I normally like to try things from a restaurant's cocktail menu, but here, I would probably stick to my usual choices (unless they change the menu in the future, which I have a feeling they do). \n\nOverall, Marlowe is not a bad option for either just appetizers and drinks or a full meal. I would potentially come back in the future to try more of their menu, especially some of the small plates and starters.", "author": "Seema U."}

Its food is usually interesting and well prepared and the service tends to be spot on.  On this visit, while service was as good as always, there were glitches with the food.\n\nMy meal started with burrata that came atop grilled levain on top of which was heirloom tomatoes and a hefty dose of balsamic.  My quibble with this plate, and it is only a quibble as the food tasted wonderful, was how to eat what was served.  Lifting the bread/burrata/tomatoes/balsamic from the plate to my mouth led to my pants getting a good taste of my meal.  But the levain was thickly sliced making it difficult to cut through the crust with a knife.  Sometimes a chef should consider how a patron will deconstruct what is served in order to consume it. \n\nOn the basis of so many positive reviews I tried the polenta with wild mushrooms, a poached egg, parmesan cheese, arugula, and a salsa verde. I'm an outlier, but this was so carbohydrate-rich that I might have been loading for a marathon.   And the plate didn't come together as food for me as the salsa verde gave a bitter taste to the polenta.   I started to think that it would have been better had the bottom of the polenta been crisped to give more texture to what was served; and rather than salsa verde I would have preferred some slices of apple or another fruit to provide sweetness to this earthy dish.\n\nNever mind.  Next time I visit you can be sure that the Marlowe burger will be on my radar.", "author": "David D."}

I called on Friday evening and was able to make a reservation for 4 people at noon on Saturday the next day. I definitely recommend making reservations to avoid waiting for a table. \n\nThis is not your typical brunch place, so don't expect things like eggs benedict and omelettes. It's a little bit more of an elevated menu. \n\nFor starters we had the French toast soldiers, which were really good! They are basically French toast sticks served with 2 different sauces. One is coffee flavored and one is a Mexican chocolate sauce. Personally I like the coffee flavor more. It was delicious! \n\nAll the reviews talked about the Marlow burger, so I couldn't leave without trying it. I thought it was a really good burger. It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and was very juicy and flavorful. The carmelized onions added to the flavor as well. The fries were also good, but the best part was the horseradish aioli! I usually don't like horseradish, but this one was sooooo good!  \n\nMy boyfriend had the Dungeness crab and rock shrimp crepe. It had a generous amount of Dungeness crab in it and was decently good, but the portion was kind of small. I definitely thought the burger was better, but it was still a good dish. Loved the citrus hollandaise sauce that was on the crepe!\n\nThe drinks here are also really good! I had the special of the day, which had peach and grapefruit flavors. I don't remember what it was called, but it was very refreshing. My boyfriend had The Baker and my friends had the Calf which were also really good. I would definitely come here for the drinks! \n\nOur bill came out to almost $140 for 4 people so it's a bit pricey for brunch but I think it's worth it! \n\nSide note: it was pretty easy to find street parking.", "author": "Mai Y."}

This used to be my favorite restaurant at the old location, but can't say my experience was as amazing this time. I'll be back to update my review once more.\n\nThe restaurant has no AC. None. I have never sweat so much during a dinner and it was hard to focus on the conversation. The coolest thing in the restaurant was the bathroom sink water. Yeah...\n\nWent with a group of 6 girls, we split several appetizers and two burgers. One burger was to be split 3 ways, but it was awkwardly split and unproportional. I might've preferred to split it on my own. They did split the other burger in half and put it on two plates with an equal amt of fries. Kudos to Marlowe for that!\n\nAlso -- kudos to the server and chef because our bone marrow was shallow, so they fired off a new one for us AND still delivered the other one. Price increase from my last review at the old location $13 to $17.\n\nAlso, this is not the best place for birthdays. We tried to do something for a friend, but found that we'd have to pay for the dessert and they'd put a candle in, but that also meant we had to pick the dessert. We didn't have enough time when my friend was gone from the table and this place didn't take initiative to give us a menu. Nothing happened.\n\nI think my first two times at Marlowe were so amazing that now, with increased prices, I expect even more.", "author": "Christina L."}

I flagged down server and explained I need to move. They found a nice corner table inside with some space around it; and a family with two little boys at next table. Little boys don't wear scented hair glop. Thanks for that.\n\nSo, since I was now able to taste food, ordered the non-alcoholic raspberry cocktail (sparkler, I think it's called). They had a special, grilled bread with olive oil & chocolate. I'd heard of this but never ate it. It was fabulous, I'm going to try and construct it at home. They don't, at least at brunch, have any kind of appetizer salad. Got the citrus brulee as a kind of fruit salad, it was very good. I am not a huge burger fan but everyone says the Marlowe burger & fries are so great. Otherwise I'd order huevos rancheros, but also doing brunch Sunday when I knew I'd be eating eggs, so got the burger. Server annoyed when I called their aioli \"mayonnaise\" (as in, burger without mayonnaise). Burger no more than fair. I asked medium and it was a little more done than that and also a little dry. Moreover the bun (after already having bread) made me feel over-full. Also ordered tea. They brought a cup of water and a tea bag to dunk in it. Lose points over that. Making tea is not rocket science but too many restaurants don't know how! \n\nServer then asked if I wanted check, um, how about dessert? Check, she repeated. OK, it was noisy, maybe she did not hear me? How about dessert? They really lose points over trying to hustle me out. Yes, it was getting crowded, yes, people were waiting, but I made a reservation, if they offer cocktails and appetizers they need to give people a reasonable amount of time to consume them and I was not dawdling. I got the vacherin. It said meringue, I pictured something liked Baked Alaska, which it was not but it was really good. Simple, but good. A meringue cookie topped with coffee ice cream, pool of chocolate sauce and toasted sliced almonds.\n\nFrankly, though, probably won't return. A long walk from BART, the burger nothing special, I like huevos rancheros but I can get them many other places, mostly, the server asking to bring me check before I'd had a chance to order dessert was very off-putting. As in, get out of here fast so we can seat someone more desirable (not a single lady, in other words).", "author": "Carol S."}

I say bustling because when I went it was right after the Giants' home opener, but don't get me wrong - I thought the noise level and causality made it that much more charming. Be prepared for EXCELLENT service and perfectly prepared American food. \n\nWe ordered a good amount and found that everything was pretty reasonably priced. We ordered the deviled eggs, fried asparagus, little gem salad, crab poppers, duck liver mousse, and the Marlowe Burger. Our server, Johnny (?), offered to bring out certain plates in stages. It was like he was making a playlist of our order and it was AWESOME. I love a man with a plan. Not only was it helpful, but it worked. Let me just say that the fried asparagus was the best asparagus that I've ever had. It was truly cooked PERFECTLY. They are blanched and then fried in an amazing beer batter. You could hear actual crunches when biting into this asparagus, and there was no bitterness. The deviled eggs were a little spicy, which I thought was pretty unique. I regret splitting the burger because it was truly delicious, but I didn't have enough to really say if it was THE BEST in SF, but it was damn good. It came with a horseradish aioli that went well with simple, sweet ketchup. Their fries were perfect (not too thin, but nowhere near the thickness of steak fries). The bitter liver taste in the mousse was way too strong for me, and the marmalade that was put on top did not quite cut it. But my meal partner loved it so... to each their own! \n\nOne thing that I also noticed was that the drinks took a very long time to get to us. The beautiful full bar was in our sight line, and it was not for lack of effort by the bartender that they took a long time. He was simply SLAMMED. But when they arrived they were delicious... almost dangerous. The pimm's cup was the perfect balance between sweet and spicy (from the ginger). \n\nGet dessert. Just do it. We got a little wild. We used the German chocolate pudding as a spread on the warm cookies. It was a beautiful moment. \n\nI definitely want to come back, eat an entire Marlowe burger, have Johnny as my server, and take in this lively atmosphere.", "author": "Isabella G."}

Too bad it was so little for 2 people. They should add more quantity for the price you're paying.\n\nWarm Deviled Eggs- We ordered 4 eggs. This was super good! In it includes bacon bits, melted cheese, and I forgot the other ingredients. So small though but it was heaven! \n\nBaked Oysters- This was one of my favorite. I love oysters and having to eat it with some of my favorite ingredients, bacon bits, potato pur\u00e9e, and crumbs on top. It was made into perfection! \n\nRoasted Bone Marrow- Super yummy! ! My boyfriend loved his bone marrow here at Marlowe's! I highly recommend this item, enough said :p\n\nMarlowe's Burger- I have ate a lot of burgers and this was just okay. I was expecting it to be explosive based on yelp reviews but it was just, again, okay. \n\nNiman Pork Chop-  This was my boyfriend's favorite dish. It was a long wait but for him it was sooo worth it. I, on the other hand, didn't like the way it tasted. It wasn't my type of dish. The reason why he loved it because it tasted so organic, fresh, farm to table kinda thing. \n\nService- Top notch! We ate at Gary Danko last weekend and experienced good service and shockingly enough the servers at Marlowe's can definitely compete. I actually prefer their type of service because the lady who served us was so upbeat and was comfortable to talk with.

I'm usually not a huge fan of brussel sprouts, but these were full doused in oil and salt so they were super tasty.  The okra was also really good and juicy.  I had ordered the shrimp roll for my main course and words cannot describe how mouthwatering the sauce is.  I think this is the best sandwich I've ever had.  The sauce was so full of cream and flavor while the shrimp was very firm and juicy.  I was very satisfied with my lunch.

We (group of 2) were seated immediately at a table! I would've been okay with waiting or being rejected altogether but I was pleasantly surprised and grateful. \n\n2. Restaurant was ampley staffed. Water was refilled timely and food came quickly. \n\n3. Turnover is great. The busboy removed my empty plates and changed all my plate settings with each course. When we were done, the busboy had our table cleaned and ready for the next group. It was very efficient, I like it. But despite all this, I never felt rushed to leave. \n\n4. Food: ordered steak tartare, bone marrow, Marlowe Burger, pork chops. Pork chops were my favorite. Pork chops are normally dry but this was juicy. Second favorite was fries that came with burger. It's crisp cut (like in n out) but obviously flavored 100x better. There's little bacon bits in the fries, therefore, fries were bathed in yummy bacon fat. Bone marrow- buttery, yum. Always wish there was more. Tartare- first dish. Hard to comment if I enjoyed it because of flavor or because I was hungry.", "author": "Lilliam F."}

I came here with a friend after making a reservation earlier in the week. Reservations are definitely a MUST, although we still had to wait for a table by the time our reservation came around. The restaurant has a surprising amount of seating for its square footage, but everything is so cramped. People walking by my chair kept hitting me and knocking my coat to the floor. \n\nThe cocktails were quite tasty, which was probably the best part of the whole experience. My friend got the Pim's Cup, and I got The Calf. Would recommend both. Strong and refreshing. \n\nThe food was good but not great. We started with the Brussel Sprout Chips, which were very tasty but nothing special. I've made better at home. Next I was eyeing the Deviled Eggs so we tried those. The flavors just blended together. The last appetizer we ordered was the Di Stefano Burrata Toast. I liked the curry flavors but the whole dish was unbearably greasy. \n\nMy friend said that their Marlowe Burger was supposed to be good so we ordered that. I'm not sure if the other entrees are any better, but I was super disappointed by the burger. There was too much bread compared to the amount of meat, and the whole thing was dry. The fries came with a horseradish dipping sauce, and I had to keep using that for my burger instead. The fries were also tasteless. \n\nOur meal concluded with the Rum Soaked Nectarine Split which has vanilla ice cream, blueberries, ginger caramel sauce, and coconut. The dessert looked amazing but did not taste that way. There were only three slivers of nectarines, and it just looked like the whole plate was dreched in the sauce. I could not taste anything except the coconut.\n\nIn terms of the service, our waitress was super friendly and professional but each time she came to our table, she dashed off a split second after she thought we were done ordering. This slowed down the process of our whole meal because we had to keep waiting for her to come around. They were good about clearing our dishes though. \n\nBeautifully plated dishes and decent service. Cute but loud date place for future reference. I would recommend Marlowe as a place to check off your list but not rave about it. I'll also probably not be visiting again.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I don't think OpenTable communicates well with their vendors because they didn't see my note about my sisters birthday, so I had to ask for a candle for her dessert. Got seated when we arrived 15 minutes early, but the spacing is really small because tables barely had space for people to come in and out of a table. It took a long time before someone came to take our orders, so we had to ask. Our food also took a really long time to come out. We started with three bites and starters. My mom tried their deviled egg for $3 which came with half a piece, which I felt was overpriced but we tried it anyways. It had a strong jalape\u00f1o taste with back on top, Mom thought it was tasty, but not enough to order again. We then had the corn soup (hint of spice, but very deliciously flavored with cheese and a rich corn flavor; recommend ordering), steak tartare (cute quail egg on top, but the portions are a lot smaller than in the pictures on yelp for sure. Decent, but not good enough to reorder again), and the little gem salad (very strong in lemon flavor and the veggies almost tasted pickled. Decent, but also not something I'd order again). For the main entrees, we had pork chops (great in flavor, a little on the dry side, but one of I enjoyed a lot more than the burger), Marlowe burger (everyone suggests this, so I was super excited to try. The fries and burger were overly salty, so I assumed they were having an off day with it, however the beef patty was still juicy), and the steak ribeye (my favorite entree; juicy and flavorful, lots of mushrooms which I tasted in flavoring of the beef so a win for mushroom lovers). We also had two sides: Brussels sprouts (didn't come out as we would hope because it was on the bitter end) and the fried green beans were a hit with that aioli sauce. As for the desserts, we finalized with the nectarine and raspberry crisp (my family all agreed this was the tastier dessert with the fattened from the nectarine and sweet crispy taste from the crisp; temperature of warmth with the ice cream was perfect) and the strawberry shortcake (tasted like a biscuit with strawberries and cream, but I enjoyed the taste of it too; however a little bit on the drier side after having the crisp). I probably wouldn't return because many of the dishes didn't wow me and or meet my expectations. However, I give them 3.5 stars for customer service because they accidentally gave our leftovers to another party upon leaving so they had us sit a little longer to remake all three of the dishes we were bringing home - now that's good service! The bill came out to be around $276 including tips and tax for three people - which was pretty pricey for the quality. Worth a try still if you're interested in giving it a go.", "author": "Amanda C."}

It's highly recommended to make reservations. Do note on the weekend there are several menus (11-2:30 brunch, 2:30-5:30 afternoon, and 5:30 til closing dinner). Scheduled reservations at 2, get a bit of the brunch and afternoon menu. Again, not a burger person but if a burger can wow me and wow the hardcore burger person I'm out with that should speak volumes. Upon entry you will see almost every table eating burgers.. You should know not to come here without trying one.\n\nMARLOW BURGER - it was smaller than expected when arrived at the table (we shouldn't have split the burger and order our own). I was expecting a giant gourmet burger but the size was decent. it was extremely juicy. For the simple looking burger i can see why the talk of the town is talking. The Patty had a good seer and flavor. Couldn't tell much about the bun as it soaked up the flavor a from the Patty. Highly Recommended.\n\nJUMBO GULF PRAWNS - wow. Don't expect this to be your typical shrimp cocktail. The shrimp (with heads attached) threw my palette into a spin. The cocktail sauce had a twist of heat, the shrimp was grilled and had a good smoked flavor, the shrimps were heavenly.... And I sucked the head because that's where the best juice is. Sounds ridiculous but I'm Asian it's normal. Highly Recommended.\n\nDEVILED EGGS - probably one of the best deviled eggs over ever had. The appearance doesn't look catchy but do not shy away from ordering it. It was a very very very delicate and well prepared devil egg. The yolk was so silky, the egg white was really tender, and the minute you pop it in your mouth it's so soft it feels like it's melting. Highly Recommend.\n\nBRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS - I love Brussels sprouts and I loved them charred and crispy. There version of it had a nice light lemon coat. Kind of oily at the bottom but still was very delicious. Highly Recommend.\n\nGREEK YOGURT PANNA COTTA - uhm. Unfortunately I was NOT a fan. This was on their brunch item grouped with other brunch items like granola. I was wondering why is panna cotta in that section, it's usually dessert and with the sweets. NOW I KNOW WHY! It was not your typical panna cotta, didn't really taste like panna cotta, and wasn't as good as real panna cotta. The cotta was so bland, it tastes like nothing. The plate was served with reserved jam and nuts - even mixing everything together it wasn't too thrilling. It was really for breakfast and not dessert. after combining everything together of reminded me of a breakfast yogurt parfait with no excitement in flavor. Don't recommend if you are expecting regular panna cotta.\n\nWill I be back? Oh yes! I will definitely be back!\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

Good thing we had a reservation (which is recommended).\n\nThe cool thing is there is no minimum on how many small appetizers you can order so I got 1 deviled egg, 1 grilled oyster and the burger as my main meal. The deviled egg was really good - soft boiled and had really good flavor. I probably could have eaten a few more. The oyster was really good as well - fresh, plump, juicy and had a good crisp for texture on top. And to finish it off, the burger was really good as well. I got mine medium rare and was cooked perfectly. It was juicy, tender and flavorful even without extra sauce. Sometimes, simplicity is key.\n\nOverall, it was a really good meal. and the atmosphere is upscale, but casual. I wish I had the stomach to eat more.", "author": "Sophia Y."}

Finally got seated, this place is on the smaller side so tables are very close to each other, so close to a point that you feel like you know your table neighbors. \n\nI have a somewhat stressful job and when I have a nice dinner out with friends I want a drink to go with it all. I saw a drink that sounded pretty good on their specials board, so I went with that. The drink that was delivered to the table was NOT the correct drink, and far from it. I let the waiter know and he went to get me the correct drink. The \"wrong\" drink stayed at the table and I ended up getting charged for the drink in the end even though it remained full on the table the entire night. I wrote to management and they apologized but I'm still pretty p/o by it so I needed to include it in my review. It's just common sense on the waiters part.. obviously he's not aware of it and I hope that he was informed of the situation and won't put any other customers in such an awkward and embarrassing situation again.\n\nThe food at marlowe isn't even impressive. I did give it an extra star because the bone marrow was delicious and it was my favorite dish of the night. I even told my friends that I would go back JUST for the bone marrow. So yes, get that. For my main entree I had the smoked cod and it wasn't impressive. Lacked flavor and was a little fishy for my taste. We also had the baked oysters and it was just okay, definitely could have done without.\n\nOverall, like I said I would go back for the bone marrow but that's about it.

Now we are older, responsible adults who discuss children (not babies), work, friends from the past, and the looming middle age over a glass of bubbly, shoving $45 a pop for a leisurely Sunday brunch in a fanciful French country style decor restaurant in South Market. SoMa as a term did not take back in our days. It was South Market, SoMa was so very SoHo wanted to be, if you ask that 20 year old version of me. \n\nWe realized Anna used to live down here, when she moved from her beautiful Pac Height apartment to SoMa in the 90s, we were horrified. Then she met a man down the street at a bar and they got married and bought a fix-upper in Inner Sunset and promptly dropped three babies. Now the babies are school age children.\n\nThis is the world we live in, there are always some exciting young people finding this neighborhood, and this restaurant enticing as a gathering spot, but we middle age women like to come here because there are still free parking nearby and it's convenient to drive by here and leaving our children, spouses (assume that's the M.O.) behind for a few hours and pretend that we were still young and hip.\n\nBecause Marlowe is hip and cool, we were infected by the charming energy for a few hours on a Sunday morning. Park Tavern is a good spot too but you see that involves brain surgery parking. Mama's Cafe was once our favorites, but that was so very many years ago.\n\nMarlowe has a nicely organized menu to choose from. Get the French toast and enjoy the mole like dipping sauce. Sablefish toast reminds me something I'd get in Zabar's, my one and only Jewish girlfriend at the table winced her nose as she does not do seafood. I joked, \"I'm more Jew than you.\" She agreesd with me. I do make a killer matzo ball soup. Bubblies are aplenty. You can't do wrong with their cocktails. Drink off those tall goblets makes one of the girls, who's very French to begin with, looking even more so French. One girlfriend shows up hastily late from Stanford Hospital, she's among those many professional women in their early to mid 40s attempting to go through the inevitable process for conception. We were reminded how quickly youth passes us by and all of sudden our struggles are no longer the same.\n\nBy the time the topic switched to those old boyfriends of ours, the entries arrived. Marlowe burger was stellar. Polenta and mushroom was what I had opted for and it was creamy and vegetarian friendly. Calamari flatbread was very innovative. Stop taking photos and take a look at the pots and pans hanging on the wall, you'd be amazed how much all of sudden you crave for that carara marble for your own kitchen. Oh yes, I do have mine just so for my Victorian home. Thank heavens.  We take our time catching up. Moving topic to topic, ending with schools and upcoming kids birthdays.\n\nMarlowe is a great place to celebrate those rare friendship with your die hard girlfriends on a Sunday morning. Their service was spotless. Their food very tasty. Their space perfectly charming. Load up on coffee please. It's strong and pure, like our friendship.", "author": "Victoria E."}

To try and cover as much of the menu of possible, we decided to split everything.  Here's what went down:\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips: A must-get item, all three of us agreed that this definitely ranks amongst the best brussels sprout chips we've had.\nWarm Deviled Eggs: Eggs are priced per egg, and I'm so glad that we decided to get this.  I loved the little piece of jalape\u00f1o that came on top, and the little piece of bacon was absolutely delicious.\nEnglish Pea Pancakes: Mentioned on this year's 7x7 The Big Eat list, I wasn't sure if I would love this, but I think this was my favorite item we had.  The smoked salmon on this is absolutely delicious!\nSteak Tartare: This was probably my least favorite item, but I think that's because I've had fabulous steak tartare here in the city and everything else before this was insanely delicious.\nBurrata: I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't just cheese on a plate, but rather served with prosciutto and a delicious fig and onion compote! \nMarlowe Burger: Splitting this three ways was perfect for all of us since we were close to being pretty stuffed by this point.  The french fries were absolutely perfect, and the bacon on the burger was ON POINT. Definitely something I'd considering getting on my own!\n\nService wise, our server was absolutely fabulous.

This is what we ordered:\n\nBrussels Sprouts Chips: I was actually very disappointed with these. It's my favorite vegetable and I love them fried. That said, these were fried a bit too long and had the acrid taste of being burnt. Not just charred, but burnt. Either they were fried or finished in olive oil, and while that was a great flavor choice, the chips were very greasy with it. Since olive oil has a higher smoke point than other oils, it's possible it just wasn't hot enough.\n\nOpen-faced Devil's Egg Sandwich: I'm not normally a big deviled egg fan, but this was great! A heap of fluffy eggs mixed with your typical deliver egg seasoning/flavor was heaped onto a piece of delicious toast, topped with Gruyere, and broiled. We were trying to figure out how on earth they got the eggs so fluffy, and our hypothesis is that they separated the raw yolks and whites, whipped the whites, folded the yolks back in with the mustard and seasoning, and then \"scrambled\" them French-style to get soft, small-curd cooked eggs. It was quite delicious. The side salad of bitter greens was dressed with a delicious vinaigrette and was a great component of the plate.\n\nPoulet Vert: yes! Get this. The chicken thigh was very moist with perfectly crisped skin, and the runny herbal pistou was absolutely wonderful, with notes of what I believe was nasturtium. The chicken came on a small bed of perfectly-cooked farro and broccoli spigarello. Roasted slices of golden turnip were surprisingly delicious side-bites.\n\nOur meal was very enjoyable and the staff was very attentive.

They rushed this couple next to me only to hear from the couple that were staying longer. \nWe arrived shortly before dinner time so we were left ordering from the cocktail hour menu. FYI - they don't have a standing bar so only ppl who are seated can order food.

The gem salad was very fresh in flavors but the citrus vinaigrette was so over powering that I was unable to finish it due to its tartness.

The dinner is good but the brunch is solid.  The food is awesome and my only issue is with their service. I like the food so much so that I've come back several times...even after a waiter spilled all his drinks on me and the manager did not even comp my meal! Gave me a card to help pay for my dry-cleaning....which is dumb because they are across town and how was I going to send them the receipt...run around for a $20 meal?  Anyways, I digress...\n\nSo, when my sister came to visit, I was excited to take her to brunch. We made reservations for 1:45 pm and we ran late because her newborn was fussing and I called the restaurant to let them know we were running late. We got there at 1:55 pm and the waitress told us we had to rush and order before 2 pm since the kitchen was only going to serve the bar menu if we did not. Needless to say, we quickly told her what we wanted...we both have dietary restrictions so it was a mad glance and the ingredients and the waitress hovering over us! Also, many of the gluten free/vegetarian options we could have were \"out.\" It was a disaster and I was embarrassed to have praised the restaurant.  I feel like we were not treated nicely and there didn't seem to be any understanding on the staff's part. I don't know if I can go back for a while.", "author": "Maliha Z."}

Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience considering how much we paid.\n\nI think that Marlowe's burger game is kinda weak. I don't understand why it's so highly revered. Made with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli, it sounded like a solid choice. However, it ended up being second-rate: dry bun and flat flavors. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n+ Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips (lemon, sea salt): Don't order these; they're difficult to eat and they taste burnt \n+ Stuffed Petrale Sole (spinach, butternut squash risotto, lollipop kale): This dish was tolerable, but flavors were run-of-the-mill\n+ Warm Deviled Egg (aged provolone, pickled jalape\u00f1o, bacon): These were okay, flavors weren't groundbreaking--it's impossible to unintentionally sabotage a deviled egg\n\nSpotty service--for some reason they kept filling only two out of the four water glasses at our table.

With their new location and continued popularity, it seems like Marlowe's has let it go to their head. \n\nTo say my experience at their new location was disappointing is an understatement. The food that I once raved about to everyone is now nothing more than mediocrity drenched in salt with shrunk down portions served snail pacingly s-l-o-w by cocky, arrogant staff. And, I'm not alone here as other Yelpers seem to share the same sentiments.\n \nMarlowe used to serve the best burger in SF at their old location but not anymore. Now, it's a $16 slider masquerading as a \"burger\". Look at that monstrous upper bun: http://bit.ly/16aQxwJ! It reminds me of former MTV's Teen Mom turned porn star, Farrah Abraham's botched upper lip job: http://dailym.ai/1CqwOao. See the resemblance? I give Farrah props for finding humor in her mishap though.\n\nAside from a downturn of their food, service was worse. \n \nMy yelp check-ins don't account for all the times I've been to Marlowe's old location (7 times in 3 years) and service has always, always been stellar. The staff there was warm, friendly, attentive, and efficient. This time our waiter bro was \"too cool for school\" as my friend had stated. He was MIA the entire night and never once bothered to check in on us but surely had time to chop it up with the older group of gentlemen sitting one table over. \n\nFood service was painfully slow (made worse by the excruciatingly bad acoustics)...we had reservations at 8:30 pm (arrived on time) and didn't leave until 11:15 pm! It shouldn't take nearly 3 hours for 3 courses! I made notes in the reservation that it was my friend's birthday and when confirming the reservations, I was assured that a candle will be placed on the dessert. That NEVER happened. \n\nMy gf, Heather C. and I were really pissed off and intended to email management about service (her review: http://bit.ly/1zPz3nx). After signing the bill, I was looking at our receipt for our server's name when he rudely swiped away the receipt. WTF! That was the fastest thing he did all night.\n\nSorry, Marlowe...you're now a has-been in my book.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Deviled Egg (topped with bacon) was to die for, and both the Di Stefano Burrata starter and the crab/seafood crepe melted in my mouth as if farm-to-table does exist.\n\nAs for entree, went with the burger, medium, extra toasted bun.

Marlowe's theme is  \"butcher chic\" which sounds odd, but has a very cool look and ambience. We got to sit in the fully enclosed patio that has succulent gardens on the walls and lights strung across the ceiling...relaxed, but very nice. Our server, Akeisha, was WONDERFUL! Truly. She was so obviously passionate about making sure her customers had a great experience from the time we walked in to the memories that will last until the next time. She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and super cool about my annoying gluten allergy. She had excellent recommendations on food and drink which basically had me planning Marlowe and their perfectly heavenly polenta (with mushrooms, lots of parmesan, arugala, salsa verde truffle oil and a poached egg on top) as my final meal on earth. \n\nWe ordered the brussel sprout chips, the deviled eggs (FYI, they are ordered individually), and the English pea pancakes for appetizers with the Corpse Reviver 2, the Verdejo, chardonney, syrah, and then a bottle of one of the whites which was pricey but well worth it. I couldn't eat either but the pancakes and brussel sprout chips were raved about repeatedly by my friends. For our main course two of us ordered the fabulous polenta and the others ordered the bone marrow and burratta with fava bean toast and the grilled Niman pork chop. All of it was fabulous and as we ate every bite, didn't have room for dessert that I'm certain would have been amazing as well.\n\nI truly CANNOT (and don't want to) wait to go back!!

We arrived at 10 pm, and surprisingly, this place was still packed. I was afraid that the restaurant wouldn't be able to accommodate our group of six without a reservation. Luckily, the hostess informed us that the wait would only be about 15 minutes, and a group of very hungry people released a collective sigh of relief.\n\nWhile waiting, we perused the food menu, where everything looked delicious, and we ordered drinks. They have a healthy selection of wine, beer and cocktail options available. Everyone opted for cocktails -- with all the guys in the group going for The Donkey (aka an Irish Mule) -- and everyone was very pleased with their drink choices. I ordered The Baker later in the evening and I can recommend it as well for your drinking enjoyment. (All the cocktails were $12 or $13.)\n\nIn terms of food, we let Yelp reviews direct us to the Deviled Eggs, Spiced Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, Marlowe Burger (with included Marlowe Fries), and Grilled Niman Pork Chop. The Deviled Eggs, Grilled Niman Pork Chop and Marlow Fries (with its addictive horseradish aioli) were all amazing and lived up to expectations. The only disappointment was the famous Marlowe Burger: while definitely a good burger, it was not especially exceptional.\n\nIn terms of service, Marlowe also excelled. The entire staff was extremely friendly and seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that we had a great dining experience. While waiting for our table we promptly had our drink orders taken and served. Our server for the evening regularly checked in with our table to make sure we had everything we needed. And, without asking, she already had two billing options prepared for whether we wanted a single bill or multiple bills split among couples. Simply put, the staff here rocks! \n\nAlthough this place is currently listed as $$ for price, it really is a $$$ restaurant.\n\nOne last interesting observation: note that while dining, you're actually sitting on dozens of bottles of wine. In a nice use of space, the restaurant stores its wine under the seats in the dining area.", "author": "Rodney G."}

Last year, it was Park Tavern and this year it was Marlowe, but I'm guessing you already ascertained that from the fact that I'm doing this review.\n\nI was a little intimidated coming into this place, because I heard they had signs that joked that vegans weren't allowed.

Nothing is particularly innovative or surprising.  The seating is very cramped, service is lackluster, and the restaurant is too loud to justify its pricing pricing.  \n\nIf truly priced at $$, Marlowe would be a solid 4.5 stars.  At $$$, it's hard to see it above 3.5 stars.\n\nCheck out the menu at http://marlowesf.com/menus/.  As you can see, the cheapest main on the menu is the $16 burger (formerly $13).  Second cheapest thing is the vegetarian dish (currently polenta, $22), and the third cheapest main is the chicken (poulet vert) at $28.  Starters are priced at entree pricing - $12 to $17 for starters ranging from broccolini to burrata.   \"Bites,\" which are finger food snacks like a bowl of toasted pistachios or brussel sprout chips, range from $7 to $12.  A conservative meal here will end around $50, and if you add drinks or an extra starter, plan to be near $100.

The jalape\u00f1os gave it a sweet after taste, loved it!\nDuck Liver Mousse: This is not your regular duck liver, they complimented with a citrus sauce, basil and chives. Great taste! Comes with beard.\nCrab & Shrimp Crepes: Delicious and creamy with your hollandaise sauce topped with fine herbs!\nRoasted Bone Marrow: MUST ORDER. Comes with salsa verde and fine herbs and beard. The bone is big, but not much marrow as expected\nSteak Tartare: Comes with a poached egg on top, mix it together and has a kick of pepper to it. Recommend for you, comes with beard.\nFries: I wanted to try the fries with their famous horseradish sauce. It was ok, I have had better. Wasn't too crazy about the sauce, maybe better with the burger.\nGrilled Niman Pork Chop: This was my least favorite, portion was great. My boyfriend and I shared it and they were super nice and split it in two plates. Pork chop was kind of rough for my taste and not much flavor. Do not recommend. \n\nOverall, I give this place 5 stars. The service is great, our server had great recommendations and they gave us extra beard when we were running out. Must try place.", "author": "Natalie L."}

This year, we volunteered with the Salvation Army in the morning and made reservations for lunch at Marlowe.  We were starving by the time we arrived for lunch.  The place was super packed for lunch but we were given a table big enough for all of 7 of us. \n\nOur waitress was super moody that day because I think they were so busy with people and orders.  We ordered so many things off the menu and shared them amongst the table.\n\nWe ordering the following items: \n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips - this could have been good but it had way too much salt. I was tempted to ask to send it back so we can have less salt on it but didn't want my food spit on so we just ate what we had. \n\nLittle Gem Salad - good but the title is true to form.  It's a \"little\" as in very small portion of a gem salad but tasty. \n\nDi Stefano Burrata - this was decent but nothing special about it. \n\nWarm Open Faced Deviled Egg Sandwich - also decent but again nothing about it stood out. \n\nCrispy Fried Chicken Sandwich - this was delicious; we ended up ordering another one because we devoured the first one. \n\nMarlowe Burger\n(Caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon & horseradish aoli) - Marlowe is well known for their burger and I thought they definitely delivered.  It's good but it's still not my all time fave burger but it's definitely good and worth a try. \n\nWarm Open Faced Deviled Egg Sandwich \nPickled jalapeno, bacon & aged provolone - this was just fine.  \n\nHonestly, the food was ok.  A few of the items were overloaded with salt.  The desserts were not good at all so I decided not to even include them in the review.  The service was so so and our waitress was super moody that day.  I won't be back since we had such a mediocre experience.", "author": "Christine P."}

Love.\n\nI was supposed to go here with friends during the week of Christmas, but ended up going the following Monday...thank goodness for no traffic that evening! \n\nThe streets weren't all that busy, plus we were able to find parking easily...I think we paid $3 more or less for parking...and it was close to the restaurant too!\n\nIt's a pretty small restaurant...we arrived around 5:45ish (reservations were for 6:30)...the hostess was nice enough to have us seated early...in less than an hour, the restaurant filled up...man, was that quick...so you're bets are off trying to come in and dine as a walk-in...you could always try your luck at the bar, but even that was filled up end-to-end with a quickness.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is really nice, but if you ask me, my first thought just by looking at all the decor made me think of \"this is more fitting for a steakhouse.\"\n\nAnyway, everything we tried here was excellent from the cocktail drinks to the desserts.  Oh yeah, customer service is amazing here..can't forget to mention that!\n\nOur orders: \n\nCocktails:\nThe Baker- This must be one of their more popular drinks or something, cuz my friend ordered it, the couple to the left and right of us ordered multiple of these...I tried a sip, but I honestly thought it was just okay...it was fruity and sweet, but I felt the ETOH was on the stronger end for me.\n\nThe Pimm's Cup-Ok, I thought it was going to be served in a copper mug or something just cuz the name of this drink had \"cup\" at the end of it haha.  It's a very refreshing drink, and I liked this drink very much....maybe because it has ginger beer in it haha...i love ginger beer.\n\nThe Barnog- In the spirit of the holidays, why the heck not...well actually, we just saw one of the servers handing it to the customer and it just looked interesting...so yeah, basically it's boozy eggnog and then some...this too was very good...\n\nStarters: Half-dozen fresh oysters...I squirted hella lemon on those suckers haha...it's hard for me to get over the taste of \"ocean\" in my mouth without gagging if you must know lol...the little sauce that goes with it made it taste even better. $18\n\nSmall Plates/ Entrees:\n\n-Bone Marrow-Get it and do what some of our fellow Yelpers (including myself) did...just when you thought you were done eating all the marrow off the bone, think again.  In the midst of scraping that yummy, chewy baguette against the marrow, you've let a lot of the flavor and oil drip into the pan...so yes...I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU TAKE THAT BREAD AND SCRAPE THE OIL FROM THAT PAN!  You know you've fallen in love with the restaurant when you ask the server, \"May I have some more bread please?\", and then they immediately complete your sentence with, \"Some more bread to dip in the oil...you got it.\"  That was a beautiful moment I tell you.\n\n-The Marlowe Burger-Not the best burger I've ever had, but it's one of the best...doesn't seem like much when you're just reading this off the menu, but once you taste it, I'm almost sure you'll be glad you ordered it...The Marlowe Fries are simple and perfect, the burger itself is simple, but that horseradish aioli  though...that was tasty. I'm not a medium-rare on my meat type of gal, but I'll make it an exception for this burger.\n\n-My entree, the \"Poulet Vert\"-  Before ordering this, I was already set on the polenta, but when I asked the server what the heck a Poulet Vert was, she said it was a roasted chicken dish...I straight up ditched the polenta and went for the Poulet Vert like a boss haha...roasted chicken always gets me haha...so flavorful, tender, and juicy.  Everything went well together on that dish, especially the grapes.\n\nDessert:\n-I don't even remember the name of the dessert we ordered, but per the server, it was the most popular choice on the menu.  I just remember it starts with a V.  it's coffee-flavored ice cream sitting on a meringue cookie drenched in fudge chocolate and almonds...I'm not really into anything coffee, but damn this was good...down to the very last spoonful.\n\nLast but not least, what totally made my night was this: Because I was enjoying that dessert a little too much, my clumsy butt ended up spilling some of the chocolate onto my top.  I tried patting it down with my napkin and water, but it was hardly working.  I wasn't even paying attention to the staff cleaning up our table up until I heard the magic words, \"Would you like some club soda to help remove the stain?\" Omg, yes! Omg, how much better can customer service be! I was very thankful, and so was my top...the club soda removed the stain with ease haha.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant...it's a good place to be if you want to satisfy your inner foodie.", "author": "Zerrilyn P."}

With stellar reviews, great location in SOMA, always busy and never any available reservations unless it's way pass normal dinner hours, this place has all of the signs of a poppin' restaurant.  So after months and a chance of a life time, we were able to score a reservation for a double date with friends on a Friday night at 8pm!  We were situated in the back room where it's much quieter and intimate rather than the main floor where you wouldn't be able to hear your date.\n\nSince it was an 8pm dinner and we all saved our stomachs for this, we definitely didn't hold back.  Below is a list of items we shared family style:\n* Crispy Brussels Chips\n* Crab Crepes\n* Steak Tartare\n* Tomato Soup\n* Little Gem Salad\n* Steak\n* Grilled Niman Pork Chop\n* Loretta's Vacherin\n\nOf the ones listed above, I felt the appetizer items were the best.  The crispy brussel chips and the steak tartare were great starters to complement our wines.  I usually fancy a nice European red wine so the steak tartare definitely hyped me up for more.  The brussel chips were just awesome.  We could have easily ordered more but decided not to since we had entrees to try.\n\nFor entrees, either we were overhyped for months or we enjoyed the appetizers and wine so much the entrees just didn't live up to the hype.  The pork chop was cooked well and was tender but we all felt there wasn't any taste or spunk to make it memorable.  The steak was filling with the potatoes and even though it was cooked medium rare (the way I prefer), again it didn't have the flavor or spark that makes me want to come back for more.\n\nOverall, a decent place to try out.

Not sure I like all of the white tile.\n\nI'm in the minority, but the Warm Deviled Egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=EwKn3TfLpGpm97sSAiTQsw#x6e10CnPnPtSQy7Bif9gWg) here is not a favorite. Something with the texture w/ the bacon & melted cheese on top (It's not you, it's me). Good, but not craveable.\n\nBaked Oyster was a similar story. The \"New England clam chowder in a shell\" is served on a bed of rock salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=EwKn3TfLpGpm97sSAiTQsw#06-s5iNy9uLDXVxjY-D4rA).

I've passed by this restaurant several times but never knew that it was Marlowe (but then again they just recently moved to this location and idk what it was before) \n\nWe came here on Saturday evening, and found parking very easily (street/metered parking). The restaurant is small and has an intimate setting (dimly lit), but a very nice vibe. Our table was ready when we walked in. Once we sat down and took a look at the menu I saw that there were so many delicious looking items to choose from! Boyfriend and I decided to just order a whole bunch of items to share (very smart choice).\n\nWe ordered:\nBITES - \nCrispy Brussels SPROUT Chips ($9): I'm not a HUGE fan of brussel sprouts but these were seasoned deliciously! They also were broken down so I wasn't eating an entire brussel sprout, but picking from the crisps that were made. We ate them all, down to the very last bite!\nBaked Oyster ($3/1) : These looked so good when they came out! On the menu it says that it is baked with new england clam chowder. I am always immediately drawn to anything with clam chowder in it. It was nice and warm and the oyster was a good size. \nWarm Devlied Egg ($2.5/1): These deviled eggs were really good. Definitely leaves you wanting more\n\nSTARTERS - \nLittle Gem Salad ($12): Out of everything we ordered, this would have to be the least favorite. It wasn't bad, but compared to our other options, we could do without.\nRoasted Bone Marrow ($14): LOVED it! This is only the second time I've had bone marrow, but i'm a big fan now. It came out with four little pieces of bread, which we used to spread the bone marrow on. My only complaint is that 4 pieces of bread is not enough! So we asked for more and got more :).\n\nMAINS - \nMarlowe Burger ($16): The Marlowe Burger comes with fries and horseradish sauce (on the side - not a fan). Boyfriend and I shared half a burger each. With the amount of food we ordered this was a good choice on our part. Boyfriend likes it medium rare, but I'm always scared to eat my meat pink so when it came out and I saw it I was worried.

The bone marrow was very seasoned and flavorful, but the portions were tiny and watery (I've had more substantial bone marrow at Chapeau!). The gingerbread cake and ice cream was very delicious and rich. The meat of the burger, in medium rare, was pretty amazing and the pork chop wasn't as dry as other places.\n-The atmosphere. Dark setting. Real lighted candles in the middle of the table. Servers wore unique blue aprons.\n-Great for birthdays. Let them know, and they'll bring out a birthday candle with your desert.\n\nCons:\n-Not the best selection for people who don't eat meat.

They do have a lot of non-meat sides/starters/appetizers though. \n-Apparently from the other reviews, the service has been decreasing. I didn't see any problems with the service, but I have had more upbeat servers at the Olive Garden.\n-Tables are very close to each other and it is very loud inside.\n-Hard to get a good time for a reservation, so make sure to call early!", "author": "Vicki L."}

I luckily work only a few blocks away so I decided to take my co-workers for one of their birthday lunches...best decision ever! We made resis through open table because when I've gone to the old location before they'd always be packed around lunch hours to the point we had to order for takeout. The new location now is a bit more spacious but still the same modern/rustic d\u00e9cor and surprisingly there was no wait with multiple tables vacant.\n\nWe started off with the crispy brussel sprout chips, which all of us loved. The serving size is kinda small for $9 and the recipe isn't all that complicated either, but for whatever reason the few times I've attempted baking brussel sprout chips in the oven, they've never turned out as tasty as these! I literally could've had a serving to myself.\n\nOne of my co-workers went with the Marlowe burger cooked medium rare while the other got the open faced devil egg sandwich. I got the crispy fried chicken sandwich with Caesar aioli and bacon , which is the only thing I've had off the lunch menu cuz it's too good not to get! All these meals came with a side of fries. It has a nice crispy crunch on the outside, but the meat is so juicy and flavorful and the bacon adds that extra flavor. The serving size doesn't look like too much, but it is super filling. My co-workers loved their orders as well, we damn near cleared our plates completely.\n\nWe didn't have room or time for dessert, but everything on their menu sounds so yummy! The service was so-so, our waiter was friendly but it was a tad slow considering the place was close to empty. It's on the pricier side but it's nice to come once in awhile to treat ourselves to a quality and tasty lunch.

This dish was so perfect for me because it had all of my favorite ingredients in it. It comes with mushrooms, arugula, Parmesan, truffle salsa verde and a poached egg. This is like a vegetarians dream dish, at least it was mine.

The bad items included the okra (did not seem to be fried properly), the bread pudding (I've seen MUCH better), and even the burger was a little overrated and I have heard a lot of good things about it.\n\nThe same could be said about the drinks as well. I thought the cocktails were great, but given that I heard some good things, I expected the wine list to be equally as good, if not better.

However, a burger is a burger, and I don't need a bun (or cheese) to tell me if a burger is amazing. Do they make burgers better? In some cases. But if the beef used is high-quality and properly seasoned, an unadorned burger should be able to stand on its own.\n\nAnd this one did. While it was topped a few nights later by a newcomer on the burger scene up in the Marina, it was definitely one of the top 3 burgers I've had in my 11 months in SF. The flavor was great, the temperature was right and everything worked. I thought they might be able to accommodate my request for no bun with a lettuce wrap, but it seems the burger lettuce is pre-shredded, so it wasn't something I could pick up with my hands. Still yummy.\n\nThe brussels sprout chips were a yummy starter that vanished quickly, and the side salad that I had with my burger was very nice too. My major issue with this burger is probably the price point. Even for such high quality, I think $19 is steep.", "author": "David B."}

Loved them all, especially the deviled eggs which came with aged provolone, pickled jalapeno and bacon. They were exceptional.  We all followed with the Marlowe burger and you can believe the hype. Came out a perfect medium rare as suggested by our server and was delicious. Came with carmelized onions, cheddar, bacon horseradish aoili and fries. Very tasty and a good size burger.\nI had a craft beer which hit the spot (long drive ahead) and others had the cocktails which were excellent.

That sounds silly but for me the food was almost a religious experience. The menu is succinct, the decor dark and a little rustic, but it all comes together creating a church or temple of nose to tail tastiness! \n\nWe were a big group so we ordered a serious selection of appetizers to start. I fell head over heels for the big bad ass BBQ shrimp. Head on grilled gulf prawns, charred to perfection and infused with a light smoke, served with a craveable cocktail sauce. These are definitely the kind of skrimps you wanna peel the tail and suck the head! I could eat a mountain of these and never get tired of the taste. My second love had to be the duck liver toast that night. Crispy grilled bread with a delicate duck liver pate, set off by a tiny bit of whole grain mustard. My mouth is watering as I type this! \n\nJust as I thought it couldn't get any better, the main course arrived, and that was my moment of religious epiphany. A large plate landed in front of, at the center of which rested a perfectly cooked Niman Ranch pork chop. The chop sat on top of some braised greens, and scattered around the plate were chunks of deep fried morcilla (Spanish Blood Sausage). This combination was a beautiful masterpiece that left me craving bite after bite. \n\nJust recapping this visit has me wanting to return for a do-over. Not that I'd change anything about the evening, just wanting to do it again and bring more people to try it with me!", "author": "Michael T."}

My big sis took me here for a birthday treat and we both thoroughly enjoyed everything. \n\nWe started with the dungeness crab and poached egg appetizer. It's SO good. The egg is poached perfectly and the crab tasted buttery yet light. My only wish is that there was more texture to the crab... and had more crab chunks. \n\nFor our entrees, I had the chicken sandwich while big had the smoked salmon with bagel. Initially, she requested toast instead of bagel because \"bagels are too thick\" (ugh, we are the freaking worst). The waitress humored us and even though it was impossible due to the integration of the dish, it was nice of her to try. \n\nWhile the chicken sandwich was delicious, the smoked salmon stole the show. The acidity of the citrus went perfectly with creaminess of the salmon and avocado. It was refreshing and vibrant and I can't wait to come back just for this!", "author": "Xinxin W."}

The lines are insane and you can never make a reservation ahead of time. Marlowe, though, allowed us to make a reservation, even for such a busy brunch time. \n\nWe tried the Deviled Eggs, the Marlowe burger, the Crab & Rock Shrimp Crepe and the French Toast Soldiers. \n\nThe French Toast Soldiers were amazing. By frying them in strips, there was a crunchiness to every bite and it almost resembled steak fries.\n\nThe deviled eggs, were interesting, with jalape\u00f1o and bacon on the eggs, but it was a dish that I would try once, but maybe not twice. I'm not sure if jalape\u00f1o, bacon and provolone cheese are necessarily the best combo with an egg....maybe not all at once? Such contrasting textures, so much flavour, my tastebuds were a bit overwhelmed. \n\nThe crab and rock shrimp crepe was a bit disappointing. There was not a lot of seafood but too much crepe and the taste of the crab and shrimp were overpowered by the crepe skin. Although the waiters suggest this as a dish to try, it is not a dish I would personally recommend.\n\nThe Marlowe burger, on the other hand, is worth the hype. It was tender, flavourful, and everything you ever wanted in a burger. This was easily my favourite dish in the restaurant. \n\nI've also tried Marlowe for dinner. I found their dinner dishes to be good, but disappointing compared to their brunch dishes. Nothing particularly stood out, with the exception of the burger. I had the pork chop, and it was nice and tender but there was nothing special that differentiated it from other restaurants that served pork chop. It was...nice, but not a stand out. The bone marrow was also quite lovely, but again, it encountered the problem in which it tasted quite similar to those of other establishments. \n\nOverall, a restaurant I highly recommend for brunch (but do your research on what's good to order as not all food is made the same, although the fried chicken sandwich is supposed to be amazing), but skip the dinner, unless you're just looking for a dinner restaurant with a nice ambiance.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

Luckily, the host was kind enough to slide me in a the community table so I didn't have to wait forever. \n\nI've had the Marlowe Burger once before at Bartlett Hall (current chef used to be the former chef at Marlowe) but left feeling disappointed. However, I didn't give up hope for I knew the birth place would redeem itself.\n\nSuffice to say, the burger was quite good. The meat was well seasoned, had a great meaty texture and still juicy. If i had one call out it would be the horseradish could at times overpower the dish. \n \nTo accompany my meal I ordered the More Cowbell-such a delightfully refreshing drink. The sharpness of the gin cuts through but balanced well with the citrus sweet notes. \n\nFor the burger ($16) + Drink $10 + tip/tax I walked out spending $36 on lunch so keep that in mind. Marlowe is definitely not a budget friendly lunch spot but well worth the trip.\n\nSide note, can't wait for the burger window to be open!

Even though we had it on our phone which clearly stated we had a reservation.\nThen we placed our order the waitress didn't write anything down, since she was trying to memorize everything. Which would have been great if she actually remembered. \n\nWe had to repeat our order twice.\n\nThen she forgot the brussel sprouts, and asked me what was missing? Third time repeating our order.\n\nThe oyster was very salty due to the bread thing on it, and the duck liver toast was very bland. It tasted like pate out of a can (the one with the Devil one it). When I asked my friend about her burger, she said the bun tasted \"stale.\" Then she just ate the meat. I felt really bad because we were debating between Marlowe and La Fusion, and I told her that this had great ratings. Now, I looked like a fool because the service and the food were a major disappointment.\n\nThe brussel sprouts arrived way after dinner was over, and we ordered desserts, mine for here, her's to-go.\n\nThe waitress, again did not writing anything down, but this time it should be easy right? She forgets once again!\n\nShe comes back and asks if we're having all our desserts here. Ugh....so sad.\n\nAnd the worse part is every time we had a meal change and they took away our silverware, they never replaced it, so we had to ask and wait. Same with the water which took forever to flag someone down.\n\nAnd when I asked the waitress for water, she gave me a little attitude, then waited for the busboy to get the water.\n\nEven the bone marrow that I was looking forward to was a let down. Small, overly salted, and just not really flavorful.\n\nJust a note to Marlowe: If you're going to remember orders (I was a waiter in college so I should know), it's best to remember it off the bat and not ask customers to repeat their order. Glasses should always be refilled without having to ask, same with replacing the silverware.\n\nThe worse part was that OpenTable then sent us an e-mail saying we were no shows, and we had to contest it. Wow Marlowe, really? You lose our reservation. Make us wait for a table. Give us poor service, and mediocre food. Then we have to dispute our visit with Open Table too? \n\nWow, how crazy is that?", "author": "Jack R."}

I don't wait in lines, I'm not about that foodie life. So here I stroll right on in with our table ready for us! Another plus, you don't have to wait until your whole party is here to be seated which is always great. There were a bunch of people seated and waiting for their friends to arrive. I had the doughnuts and the bacon and 1 deviled eggs and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict over a crab cake I believe and two deviled eggs. Deviled eggs came at $3 a pop which is pricey and it's good but I can't justify spending another $3 on just good. The bacon was a thick cut of meat! Oh man, it was juicy with all the fats seeping from it, yum yum yum! The doughnuts didn't have filling which I thought it did but it was still delicious with the jam they provided! My friend thoroughly enjoyed the benedict. I then ordered another benedict to go for my bf that was home sleeping and for the check as well. We get the check with a paper bag with 1 deviled egg inside and I thought oh man that's so nice of them to give us a free deviled egg! We sit and wait for the check and my benedict to go and when we get the check my friend said, hey they didn't charge your benedict to go on this receipt. I take a look and realized they charged us for the deviled egg and then I realized that the waitress must of heard deviled egg instead of eggs benedict lol I waved down another waitress (I love that this establishment lets all waitresses serve each other's tables, makes things so easy). She apologized and said we can keep the deviled egg and she will remove it from the bill and bring us one with eggs benedict. When she came back with the benedict she also included a little box of the peanut butter chocolate crunchies or whatever which was awesome because I wanted to try them anyways! Such great service and the staff we all very friendly and ON TOP OF IT! Will definitely be back as it was such a great experience and delicious bites!", "author": "Yvonne L."}

He even split up items like the soup so we could both gluttonously dive in without worrying about our dining partner's share.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered: Warm Deviled Eggs, Baked Oysters, Roasted Bone Marrow, and the Marlowe Burger. The Marlowe Burger deserves a special shout-out for being one of the most amazing burgers I've ever had. And it was also cooked exactly as I requested.

The hostesses handled the situation with friendliness and efficiency. (I was a bit worried about being able to get out of my seat and then past the seats at the bar, because it was so tight and I ate so, so much.)\n\nThe brussel sprout chips, little gem salad, ribeye, burger,  and baked cauliflower were too much for the two of us to share (no surprise there....a ton of food), so we didn't really end up eating the cauliflower, which was more of an au gratin. We loved all but the little gem salad, which was one of the prettiest salads I have ever seen...but the dressing had a flavor neither of us enjoyed...less citrus and more of a non-specific seafood taste. Not sure what that was about. I finished mine. My dining companion passed on hers after a few bites.\n\nThe issue the evening we were there: our server. He finally approached our table after at least a ten minute wait to be even acknowledged --as he dealt with tables within 18 inches of us on the right and left. And when he finally decided he would come to serve us, he approached the table and said, \"Are you ready?\" without a smile,questioning whether we'd like a cocktail, etc. I just stared at him, I was so taken aback. I let him know we'd like to order drinks, he took our orders and left. 10-15 minutes went by and we finally got them. He then took our dinner order. And we waited. And waited. And waited....while the couple who came in 20 minutes after we did were served all of their courses. He nonchalantly came over and we had to ask about our dishes. He was unapologetic, never smiled...just unbelievable. Said he'd check on them and seemed perturbed with us. It has been a very long time since I had such lackluster attention or such a bad attitude. I said to my guest that maybe he was just having a bad day, and gave him 20% anyway, but I definitely got the feeling that Ernesto had sized us up and thought two women were not going to order much....or tip much. This is a feeling I have not had in years, dining all over the world. It's the only way I can sum up how we were treated. \nI know Marlowe is not suffering from a lack of business, but I also know you don't want customers leaving with the feeling that they are a bother, rather than appreciated diners who order cocktails, 5 dishes and tip 20%. We are friendly people. It was not a pleasant experience. And I am hoping it was just a bad day. We all have them. I'll leave it at that.", "author": "Maribeth S."}

If you're not looking for the noise and cramped spaces, opt to sit in the back room/patio. They have a little garden in the back and it's much quieter. \n\nFor food, I had the baked oyster from the \"Bites\" section, and Roasted Bone Marrow from the \"Starters\" section.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "Talk about long overdue.  \n\nThe months it took me to finally finish/post this review was bad enough, but they pale in comparison to the number of years it took me to finally experience the awesomeness that is Marlowe.  What's even worse is that I have no one else to blame but me!  Man, I'm such a jerk to myself sometimes.  Especially considering how Marlowe is now one of my favorite restaurants in SF!\n\nBetween the friendly workers and fantastic vibe (love the look/d\u00e9cor), there was plenty to like even before our meal started.  Going through the menu though, there was even more.  Everything sounded fantastic!  And as what usually happens when Jenny K. and I have our reunion dinners, we (happily) ordered a ton.\n\n-- WARM DEVILED EGG with Aged Provolone, Pickled Jalapeno, and Bacon...$2 each\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#CRd9s-LD9bOvKeWRDdVSLg)\nI've had some great Deviled Eggs, but Marlowe's is the best thus far.  The cheese, the jalapeno, the bacon...it was so delicious, we got a second order as soon as we finished our first.  That should be reason enough for you to try.\n\n-- CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS with Lemon and Sea Salt...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#owr-IPwg81PzOVuWs8BiKw)\nThis wasn't one of my must tries, but I'm glad Jenny got it.  Each leaf was perfectly crisped and tasted amazing!  A close second for \"favorite of the night\" and a must get!\n\n-- STEAK TARTARE with Poached Egg, Arugula, and Crostini...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#ftHd39p3fR6OpPPxedkE_g)\nSteak tartare has never appealed to me (it's raw beef and I worry about food safety) and I'm not sure if I'll ever be a fan, but this one wasn't bad.  Especially with the arugula.  I let Jenny have most of it, but I would trust getting Marlowe's again.\n\n-- DI STEFANO BURRATA with Spicy Broccoli Rabe Pesto, Marinated Artichoke Puree, Wild Arugula, and Grilled Levain...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#tfMNo_wnyApuAD4BVnwq6Q)\nI worried the burrata was over seasoned, but it was terrific!  Then again, how could it not be?  The burrata alone made the dish a success, so the broccoli rabe and artichoke puree were like a bonus.\n\n-- ROASTED BONE MARROW with Salsa Verde and Fine Herbs...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#0rp4kmUa0BAP8kI83vWSug)\nSo, so good!  The serving size was pretty solid, with both bones had plenty of yield.  Even though it was a little heavy on herbs, the marrow's luscious, buttery flavor still shined through.\n\n-- MARLOWE BURGER with Caramelized Onions, Cheddar, Bacon, Horseradish Aioli, and Fries...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#XLnQsvgQjigk6c6vSO632g)\nIronically, the dish I was most excited for was also the least impressive (though still pretty decent).  The biggest culprit for me was how thick and bready the bun was, but the fact the patty was a little overcooked didn't help.  However, the taste still wasn't bad (the condiments meshed really well) and the fries were great.\n\n-- VANILLA BEAN PANNA COTTA AFFOGATO with Amaretto and Lemon Biscotti...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=RW0Vyzd4hcwgBYuNrgbEMA#JTN4LwVMMPydomCpFj5wCw)\nI really liked how balanced it was.  Each bite starts a little bitter and finishes a little sweet without going too far in either direction.  The biscotti cookies were a great complement as well, though they took it away before I could finish mine.\n\nWith a location right across from the CalTrain station (and mere blocks from AT&T), Marlowe is super convenient to get to.  Parking is pretty ample as well, but make sure to check the parking signs.  Parking limitations/hours run longer in the area and meter rates are more expensive on game days.\n\nAlso, since it's somewhat small, reservations are recommended.  However, unlike State Bird (my other favorite SF restaurant), you won't have to plot out months in advance on when to come.  Though it still might be worth it even if you did.", "author": "Mike L."}

Service was outstanding for us. \n\nMy favorite thing on the menu was the Brussel sprouts chips and the coffee ice cream. The chips is definitely something you can make with a baking pan, salt+pepper & lemon twists but it wasn't outrageously priced. They were crispy but not burnt. The coffee ice cream was just Amazing with a marzipan(??) cookie at the bottom. Portion was perfect for two. \n\nThe waited bone marrow was interesting, but mostly just fatty tasting. They had tiny crackers and a interesting tangy sauce. It was novel, but I suppose it wasn't something my taste buds loved. \n\nThe entrees on the other hand were a little disappointing. The steak was in soy sauce and the steak wasn't dry and cooked just right but didn't have any flavor. The green beans were drenched in the soy sauce making it on the salty side.

Though they had a full bar and specialty cocktails for the day or night.\nFood: The eggs were done perfectly and to my asking and I shared the Toy Soldier French Toast. You must get the French toast and even have it for yourself as a main dish if you wish. I would recommend sharing it with the table so you could all enjoy a piece. Most things brought out of the kitchen looked good and were eaten quickly across all of the tables. \nOverall: For brunch/lunch this is a great spot and a pretty good value.

I wanted to try this place on NYE, but they only had a prixe fix menu that night and they were out of reservations anyway. My boyfriend made reservations for Valentines Day weekend about a month in advance (although I'm sure you don't need to make them THAT early! We made sure not to book it on V-day so we didn't have to do a prixe fix. But I see why you need reservations...the restaurant is TINY! It gets kind of packed, but the dim-lit ambiance is pretty nice. I didn't actually see a restaurant sign outside but it's right across the Caltrain station and you can see all the quotes decorating the window panes outside.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nWarm Deviled Eggs (with aged provolone, jalapeno, bacon) --these were quite delicious, but at $2.50 for a small half of an egg, I may not order too much of these.\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprout Chips( ($9)--so. bomb. I need to make these somehow. Seasoned with lemon, olive oil, and sea salt. WANT. MORE.\n\nENTREES:\nGrilled Niman Pork Chops ($27) --wow, I never knew pork chops could be so succulent and juicy and savory. Loved the grilled taste and sauces coating the pork chops, and the portion of this was actually HUGE. Over a bed of sauteed spinach and several pieces of maple roasted apples on the side, along with Morcilla sausage (spanish blood sausage). The sausage was interesting...I didnt know what it was when I first saw it but you could def taste the fatty savory meat flavors and it just crumbled in your mouth. There was also a square slice of \"pumpkin pudding\"...more like an eggy pumpkin bread. The whole dish was great...good pairing of flavors, nicely done and so worth it.\n\nSeared Cod ($26)--cod was cooked nicely with crisp top but soft inside in a lentil/white wine sauce with grilled leeks and calamari on the side. This dish was a lot smaller than the pork chops though and I would definitely order the pork chops over this again. My bf quickly realized I wasn't going to finish my pork chop dish and was relieved because the cod dish was so much smaller in portion size for him...haha =P\n\nDESSERT\nUpside Down Strawberry Crisp ($8) --what a simple yet heavenly combination of crumbly brown sugar/oatmeal/graham cracker cookie over bourbon ice cream drizzled with brown butter caramel sauce and topped with fresh diced strawberries. SO. GOOD. Perfect way to end the meal!\n\nNot a huge menu but the food is all cooked wonderfully and I would come back even to eat the same stuff all over again! Maybe try some specials... =) Thanks for a great Valentines weekend meal, Marlowe! \n\nP.S. Parking is validated at Safeway for 90 min if you buy something.

Probably closer to a 3.5 but should seriously be $$$ rather than $$.\n\n-----\n\nEnglish Pea Pancakes ($12): One of my favorite dishes from tonight. The pea flavor was a bit drowned out amongst the other flavors going on, but the spices and smoked salmon worked well together. Overall very tasty. \n\nBrussel Sprout Chips ($9): Definitely lived up to expectations. Light, crispy, and just right amount of salt and lemon. \n\nSteak Tartare ($16): Not bad but the seasoning was definitely on the heavy side. It tasted a bit vinegar-y and spicy like Tabasco sauce mixed with mustard, which should be delicious, but not when the food is completely doused with it. Also the poached quail egg on the top is too tiny to taste among the flavors. \n\nMarlowe Burger ($16): It was good but really, just good. Like the meal, it left me underwhelmed. A bit on the greasy side with the bacon and none of the flavors particularly stood out. \n\nRum Soaked Nectarine Split ($10): I honestly could not believe that this is the most expensive dessert. It was literally one modest-sized scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in caramel sauce, a handful of blueberries, and three slices of nectarines. The nectarines weren't even ripe and were instead hard and tasted very sour compared to the sweet ice cream and caramel.\n\n------\n\nThe service was very good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-28", "description": "I had a Christmas Eve brunch here and had very high expectations after great experiences at sister restaurants Park Tavern and Cavalier.  This was the single worst service experience I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life.  First, and certainly most forgivable, the metered parking out front had so many warnings and times you could and could not park there I couldn't figure out for the life of me if I could park there on a Sunday morning or not.  I ask the hostess as we walked in if I was good where I parked and she had no idea.  A little odd not to know if your customers can park in the spots right in front of your restaurant, but okay, I moved my car to be safe.  With all the construction around there it took me 10 minutes to get around the block, almost got dropped on the Bay Bridge, it was great.  \n\nWhen the hostess goes to seat us there's about 3 groups of people for 25 tables and she plops us right next to this couple in a weird corner table where my wife and I literally could not fit both of our legs without resting them against eachother and my wife is 5\"1.  And the couple next to us was totally oblivious and the woman had her huge purse right where my wife was supposed to sit and didn't do anything to move it.  Hostess really should have noticed that, but didn't catch it at all.  I stood up and was just like, we need a new spot, that's not working for us.  She moved us to a much better location, great.\n\nThen we get the waitress helping us out who I would best describe as completely hostile.  At one point my wife turned to me and said, I think she wants to tackle me and I have no idea why!  She came up to me about 15 seconds after I sat down from moving my car and asked if I was ready to order my meal, and I said I needed a few more minutes and she was NOT pleased with that response clearly.  So that was also lovely.  \n\nThen we order our food, and in spite of the fact she was clearly taking her life into her own hands by doing so with the aforementioned waitress, my wife asks if she can (gasp!) get no truffled salsa verde on the polenta.  Because honestly why any decent restaurant would taint their food in 2017 with truffle oil, I can't imagine, but okay.  The waitress surprisingly says that will be fine, great!\n\nFood comes out and it just reeks of truffle oil and you can literally see it dripping off the polenta (which by the way was about 3/4 greens which wasn't even in the description, so I would not recommend that dish, egg was cooked perfectly however).  My wife says, ummm, I ordered no truffle oil.  The server, different guy from our beloved waitress, says yeah, there's not truffle oil on there.  My wife points to a dripping piece of spinach and says, I can see it right there dude!  He says, oh, I'll take care of that.  Takes it back, and brings the plate back 3 minutes later like he just completed the Sistine Chapel with his correction to this dish, and it literally still reeks of truffle oil, though to his credit it is no longer dripping off the spinach.  My wife sucks it up and just eats it, fine.  Only later am I haunted by the vision of Horatio Sanz in the 90's comedy Road Trip licking off the unwanted condiments (among other things) and just sending it back out.\n\nAgain this is a 16 dollar breakfast dish, they should have re-fired it for sure considering they clearly messed up the order or if you can't do substitutions just say it.  \n\nAll is not lost however, the huevos rancheros that I had were incredibly creative and delicious and whoever was cooking the eggs that day was on fire because they were perfectly runny without appearing undercooked.  The bloody mary (they call it something else) was also fantastic, nice and spicy.  And again, this may have been a Christmas Eve debacle on their part, but it was a debacle of epic proportions i must say.  I have not left a really crappy tip in at least 10 years out of spite, but I recalled tipping the cleaning ladies in the hotel $5 and I was like there's no way i'm going higher than that for this level of service.\n\nI will certainly return to the sister restaurants in the near future (I would tolerate just about any form of treatment for a Marlowe Burger), but it just won't ever be at this location again that's for sure.", "author": "Joshua D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-23", "description": "Dine About Town 2014 review!\n\nI had bookmarked Marlowe back in 2012, so when I saw it listed for DAT, I knew I had to go.\n\nOriginally, when I looked at their menu, I didn't think their DAT offerings were that good of a deal. The maximum value of the items was $11 (soup) + $14 (burger or sandwich) = $25, which is pretty darn close to the $19 DAT price. I considered just ordering their famous Marlowe burger on its own because I rarely order soups (can't justify the price for something that I normally consume from a can...). But, I was dining with a friend and didn't want our food to be out of synchronization, so I took a leap of faith that the soup could possibly justify $5.\n\nCleared the jump, phew!\n\nThe DAT 2014 appetizer we opted for was their $11 CAULIFLOWER SOUP with pork lardons, raw oysters, and chives (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=_Q3wfnELKrxcwEifOJc5GA#_Q3wfnELKrxcwEifOJc5GA). According to Wiki, a lardon is a small strip or cube of pork fat used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads. AKA cured ham AKA bacon lol. The raw oysters were majorly fresh and tasted very strongly of the sea (The Little Mermaid, anyone?). The soup itself was smooth, creamy, and rich like a chowder. And the dash of paprika was a nice touch.\n\nWe both chose the same entree: the famous MARLOWE BURGER with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, and horseradish aioli. Normally $14, the burger comes with a side of salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=_Q3wfnELKrxcwEifOJc5GA#zpro8C2zB50VIlBEnVXYtA) or a side of Marlowe fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=_Q3wfnELKrxcwEifOJc5GA#HTIzNI2Uvk6yiFrxlEUGgg). The Marlowe fries are delightfully crispy but were way too salty. The side salad was very arugula-y, meaning I basically had to force myself to finish it (I have this thing with leafy greens...don't ask about it). At least the bitter salad made the burger that much more delicious.\n\nAnd delicious the burger was. At first, the bitterness from the horseradish aioli caught me off-guard because I ABHOR horseradish--it's so bitter and overpowering. Fortunately, a good amount of the aioli got squeezed out with my burger drippings, so it wasn't too detrimental to my burger experience.\n\nThe ciabatta bun they use is wonderful. It's lightly toasted to a nice crunch, and it's dense enough that it manages to hold the insides together without getting too soggy. Another subtle highlight was the caramelized onions that lent a slightly sweet undertone. I initially didn't even taste the onions until my friend pointed it out to me, probably because my tastebuds were way too fixated on the danged horseradish. The bacon, with its salty crispiness, was awesome as always, and the melted cheddar cheese was so perfect that I can't even put into words how perfectly they melted that cheese onto the patty. And they attempted to squeeze in some veggies by adding a few shreds of lettuce.\n\nHowever, amidst all these glowing pluses, the rarity of the meat could use some work. As usual, we requested medium-rare, and we just got...medium (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=_Q3wfnELKrxcwEifOJc5GA#VFd79UVW93Kn9Rf1nVqCuA). Hrrrrnnnhhh okay fine. At least it was juicy. So, creds there. Even then, there were 2 charcoal-burnt patty pieces that stood out to me... :(\n\nSince Marlowe is located in east SF, there's some legitly good sunlight pouring through the windows. It has a mix of small tables and communal benches. Service isn't the warmest (though the actual restaurant is warm, temperature-wise; you'll be taking off some layers), but their water refills are prompt. Really prompt.\n\nThe portions looked small, but both of us were full and satiated after the meal. We ended up paying $24 each after tax and tip. In my mind, that means that the value of the DAT menu is not having to pay tax and tip. Not bad, but I wouldn't come here exclusively for the DAT offering. The burger itself is worth the visit.\n\nGawd but srsly, I hate horseradish. Next time I eat here, I'm ordering the burger sans the aioli. Gawd.", "author": "Adele F."}

The restaurant has a nice date vibe and was packed, even at 10 pm. Break down of our food:\n\nFrench Fries w/ Aoli: Please please please do not get this. Wow, I was SO disappointed. It tasted like stale McDonalds fries with flavoring. The portion was tiny AND it was $7. \n\nDeviled Eggs: Due to all the raving reviews, I wanted to try this. Albeit pricey, we figured it was worth it and ordered 2 to split 4 ways. Basically it was a bite each and I expected my bite to be heavenly. Unfortunately it fell totally flat. Basically it's a normal boiled egg with cheese and bacon on top. If the cheese was still hot and melted, it might have tasted better....but by the time it got to the table it was kind of hardened and easily fell off the egg. I was disappointed.\n\nScallops: My sister and I shared this for our main entree. This is where the redemption started.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and flavors were good. There were only 5 pieces though, so it's not a ton...but then again seafood is just expensive in general. \n\nPork Chop: My sister's bf ordered this and he really liked it. I had a piece and the meat was tender and juicy. It was also cooked very well.\n\nNew York Strip Steak: My bf ordered this and he really liked. The sauce was good and it came with some delicious green beans and snow peas.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake: Basically a scone with whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Just ok. I don't think I'd order it again.\n\nOverall the main entrees redeemed this place for me, but I would never order the appetizers again.

He kept coming over to see if my wife was done with her plate of appetizers and when he would find that she was not - he would walk away dissatisfied. We ordered the bone marrow, burgers, salmon with cucumber, roasted cauliflower and a couple more appetizers. Let me start with the bone marrow - it was not cooked through and was just roasted on top, so the texture was completely off. On top of that it was extremely salty  and served with a salty souse and salted greens. Actually that was the theme of the evening - everything was extremely salty. My buddy ordered a well done burger, which was extremely salty by the way, and when he bit in to it he realized the meat was rare. The burger was served with fries and salty horseradish.\nI could not stop drinking water for hours after the meal. I have to add that i usually love salty food and add more salt to all of my dishes, but this was just extreme - like they let a child play with the salt shaker.\nOh - and lastly - the prices.

I was in the mood for something light but filling. I opted for the gem lettuce salad ($14). PRETTY damn expensive for a salad if you ask me. I asked if I could get meat added.. like shrimp since that was offered on another dish. The bartender turns to the manager and asks if he can add meat to my salad, and she says no... I'm sorry, what? You can't add meat to a salad? I've never heard of that before... She said I could order the shrimp as a side but they couldn't put the shrimp on the salad... That sealed the whole experience for me.\n\nI was pretty disappointed and wasn't impressed by the portion or the quality of the salad. Maybe next time I'll opt for a burger.", "author": "Norah C."}

I like that they offer a bunch of small plates, that range from veggie-centric to seafood-heavy, in addition to the bigger entr\u00e9e portions.  And because first impressions are important, I was impressed right off the bat when they gave us complimentary champagne for our anniversary.  That's too cute.\n\nWe started with the fried okra and warm deviled egg and whoa, both were so good!  I'm a sucker for anything involving okra and these managed to be breaded and fried without losing any of that good okra slime that I love.  We were hesitant about the egg but it ended up being the best we'd ever tasted.\n\nFor dinner, we split the pork chop.  I'm usually opposed to splitting meals, but the table next to us had already gotten their entr\u00e9es and they looked HUGE.  The split portion ended up being the perfect size for both of us.  My only criticism was all the smoky flavors.  My drink was so smoky and something on the pork chop plate was as well.  Maybe I'm just not a fan, but that was not pleasant.", "author": "Lauren D."}

FYI, the 'bites' section of the menu should be called 'bite', because they are literally one bite. I would have thought a deviled egg would include both halves, but no, it's a deviled half-egg. Next I had the Pan Roasted Sea Bass. It was fine, but not very flavorful. \n\nMy husband had the Roasted Bone Marrow to start. He seemed pleased with the flavor, but, again, a small portion compared to other restaurants where he's ordered bone marrow. He had the grilled pork chop as a main dish. It was good (not great).\n\nFor foodies, I would recommend ordering a few appetizers in lieu of an appetizer and entree.

It's good, but not worth the $16 price tag in my opinion.\n\nI actually had the Marlowe Burger burger before I had the one from the original Marlowe.  I thought the Marlowe Burger one was decent but not amazing, and thought that perhaps they had tweaked the recipe a little for the casual joint.  But nope, it's the exact same burger, except for a couple bucks more, my patty at Marlowe was actually smaller than the one I received at Marlowe Burger!  I mean, it still tasted good - juicy medium rare, the excellent horseradish aioli, a small portion of iceberg and tomato.  I just don't understand how this burger got such a good reputation.  But the fries... now that's something to rave about!  Just like at Marlowe Burger, the Marlowe fries are perfection. Especially with the horseradish aioli.  \n\nGiven what I know now, I really wouldn't bother going to Marlowe for their burger+fries when I can get the exact same thing a block away for $2 less without the crowds.  Unless I want better alcohol options.  Since it was Negroni week, I ordered a Negroni, and while it was very well balanced and not too heavy handed on the Campari, I don't think it justified the $14 price tag.  My friend was in the mood for something refreshing and ordered The Bull (lemongrass-infused gin, blanco vermouth, and tonic) and I couldn't discern any lemongrass and found it pretty underwhelming.  \n\nObviously I only sampled a fraction of their menu and the other food looked and smelled good...

Birthdays, anniversaries, \"out of town family\" go to spot, or just cause I'm hungry for good food. Not sure if they changed chefs but it's definitely not as good as it used to be. They used to have an awesome kale Cesar salad on baguette but took it off the menu. The gulf shrimp used to have more flavor, but this time around they were unflavorful and yet Spicey. Brussels sprouts chips were left in the deep fryer a little too long. Bone marrow is my favorite.That was still delicious but then again you can't mess that up. The chicken was smothered in gravy and again unflavorful and unappealing.  My all time favorite spot was a huge disappointment.", "author": "Shana W."}

We quickly grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited, and our group was impressed by the bartenders and cocktails. This initial feeling soon wore off as we ended up waiting 45+ minutes to be seated after our reservation time and that part of our group placed the same drink order 3 times to the same server and not once was brought their drinks. \n \nOnce seated, our server made a point to apologize in the form of a round of appetizers and comped the drink orders that were never brought to our friends. While we were still a little annoyed and frustrated with the service from the host staff team, I appreciated that time was taken to address the issue immediately and was happy by the offering.\n\nWe ordered our own round of appetizers, more cocktails, and shared some plates for dinner, and some of the highlights were The Baker cocktail, the bone marrow appetizer, and the cod. \n\nAll in all, very happy from a food/drink perspective but service left a lot to be desired. In the future I would probably just come for drinks at the bar.", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "***Marlowe is a popular restaurant and it is easy to see why with their delicious, nicely prepared food at reasonable prices***\n\nMarlowe is located in a slightly industrial part of SoMa near AT&T Park that is very crowded.  This area does not necessarily seem like a touristy part of the city, but the streets are busy and it is hard to find parking.\n\nMarlowe serves casual food, but everything here is well prepared and well presented.  The kitchen utilizes high quality ingredients and there seems to be a lot of care that goes into each plate of food.  For lunch, Marlowe features a few small upscale snack-like bites (sweet and savory pistachios and baked oysters), some starters (from light salads to richer items like steak tartare), several upscale but hearty and approachable sandwiches, and a few entrees.\n\nI started with one of their bites.  I had their baked oyster selection, which was described as New England chowder in a shell.  It sounded very inviting.  Unfortunately, I think it was really hard to experience how great this baked oyster could be.  It was supposed to be eaten in one bite, but the oyster was so hot (I did not want to risk burning my lips).\n\nThe oyster was good and maintained its plumpness and juiciness despite being cooked.  The oyster had a good crunchy top and you get a creamy chowder part, but there was just not enough of it.  You do not really get that chowder in a bite experience.  Instead, it ends up being a hot oyster with a slight flavoring of cream and chowder.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=bOx79queF48DDtN_RlE4dg#pLilrzM3i-VmeR--SCKoJw\n\nFor my entree, I had their Poulet Vert and it was exceptional.  It was a very hearty lunch entree that utilized a simple protein (chicken breast), but there were enough nice touches to really elevate this entree above most chicken courses.  The chicken breast sat on creamy mashed potatoes.  Circling the mashed potatoes were several pieces of chicken fried okra.  The chicken fried okra delivered the crispiness, crunchiness and saltiness of fried chicken, which was nice to have given that the chicken breast was roasted and not fried.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=bOx79queF48DDtN_RlE4dg#EJ9eFf2AAR-R2bkCtdZW6g\n\nThe chicken was tender and featured moist meat.  I also enjoyed the herb paste that they used between the meat and the skin.  It created a fragrance that really added needed flavor to a typically bland protein.  The chicken was topped with fresh and leafy arugula.\n\nDessert was a slight letdown.  It was a banana coconut walnut cake.  While all the flavors came across well, the cake was too dense.  The cake was topped with good vanilla ice cream and a sticky and sweet but not too sweet caramel.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marlowe-san-francisco-2?select=bOx79queF48DDtN_RlE4dg#FqJmdB3QoThoMHUjgfGKDw\n\nService was very good--quick and personable.\n\nPrices were reasonable.  Most of the sandwiches were $15 and below.\n\nMarlowe has a nice look.  With the white tile and small, packed dining room, it has the feel of a downtown hot spot or breakfast spot.  With the tables and dark brown bar, you get an upscale and contemporary but also still very classic bar feel.  With the animal drawings to the chalkboard specials on the wall, Marlowe also reflects a gastropub feel.\n\nWhile I did not love all of the food I had at Marlowe (the chicken was excellent while the rest of the food was slightly disappointing), almost all of the food served here looked very appetizing (the appearance of the prawn cocktail really stood out).  The menu sounded very good and I think there are probably several great dishes here.  The dinner menu is more ambitious and features more exciting proteins.  If you can only make it to Marlowe for a weekday lunch though, I think you are likely to leave very satisfied.\n\nStreet parking is very hard to find.  There is a nearby pay parking lot, but it is expensive at $15-$20 per vehicle.", "author": "Anthony N."}

We also enjoyed cocktails (a Bloody Mary variant for me and a mimosa for him) and coffee. Everything was delicious, and we left feeling sated and satisfied. Service was friendly and professional.

Fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection, and complemented by a bun that's soft, yet sturdy. \n- Smoked black cod - solid fish dish. Tasty and surprisingly filling.\n\nOn our first date night, we had some dishes that are no longer on their menu, but were delicious from what I can remember...

Me either. Does it inspire confidence? \"You betcha!\" As Marge in Fargo would say. So we did.\n\nThe food and service were both inspired at their soft brunch opening. We began with Marlowe's version of a blood mary, harmonious tang and spicy accented with a green olive, pickled onion and lemon wedge on a spike for $11. Next up the seasonal eclairs, 3 mini versions piped with lemon curd and coconut shavings napped in white chocolate. Alongside were 3 chocolate chip minis with chocolate icing. The choux pastry was light and fluffy, the fillings divine but served a bit too chilled. That was our first criticism.\n\nRound 2 featured two warm deviled eggs hinting of pickled jalapeno nd topped with crisp bacon and melted provolone. I could have eaten a plate of these beauties.\n\nThree buttery crepes enfolded fresh dungeness crab and plump rock shrimp, a teriffic brunch entree enlivened by a light and lemony hollandaise. Really scrumptious, rich and satisfying without being gloppy or pasty as some brunch hollandaise treatments are. A salad served alongside was clearly just picked out of the garden and punctuated with herbs.\n\nHubby had the famous fried chicken sandwich and french fries. No doubt the fries served with a horseradish aioli were the best i have ever eaten.\n\nAt this point a waiter other than our own noticed my empty drink glass and asked \"If I wanted another of whatever it was I was drinking?\" Nice intention but a bit clodly, criticism 2.\n\nOur waitress was finesse itself, even shadowed as she was by a trainee. Plates were removed and the table wiped between courses. Very refined!\n\nI enjoyed the fort bragg coffee and the cream served in tiny milk bottles. The interior had sound baffling so conversation was easy, thank goodness!

But, this time I was in for a much different experience. \n\nS T A R T E R S\nBrussel Sprout Chips- Yes, these were just as good as I remembered them to be. The only difference is that it is now served in a much smaller bowl.\n\nBone Marrow- My favorite appetizer. Still the best bone marrow I've had at any restaurant. \n\nDeviled Eggs- They were okay. Nothing to write home about. \n\nT H E  F A M O U S\nOf course I ordered the burger that everyone raves so much about, the Marlowe Burger. I've had this burger twice before, but this time I noticed a difference in taste. I couldn't quite put my finger on the reason why, but maybe what I have to say next will shed some light.\n\nW H A T  S E R V I C E ? ? ?\nAh yes, service. One of the important keys to running a successful business! Well luckily for my friends and I, we got stuck with the \"ghost waiter.\" He makes an appearance when he pleases, or when he gets \"caught.\" Okay, so he took our order, brought us dessert menus, brought our bill, and took our money. Do you notice anything missing here?\n\nHe did not once come to our table to simply ask us, \"How's everything?\" Normally at restaurants, the waiter or waitress comes out after you've gotten your food, to check on you. RIGHT, or am I just crazy? Well, we did not get that here. I also noticed he was paying more attention to a table full of older people. He even thanked that same table for dining at Marlowe, as he dropped off the bill. Well, when he dropped our bill off to us- he didn't say one word. Not even a thank you. Then as we left in front of him, he still didn't say anything!! No, \"Have a good night.\" or a \"Thank you.\" He had that DISGUSTING attitude of someone who doesn't give an f, extremely cocky and very UNPLEASANT. \n\nWHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! Needless to say, I left the restaurant extremely upset, and told myself that I will NEVER set foot in their establishment ever again.\n\nC O N C L U S I O N\nThe interior was unappealing to me; it felt as if I was eating in someone's old kitchen. I much rather prefer the darker interior, and ambiance at the old location. Also, the tables at their new location are fairly tightly packed. So be prepared to slide your bottom across your neighbor's table. \n\nMarlowe used to be one of my top recommendations, well not anymore! Treating your customers poorly will result in poor reviews.

Yes, I had to ask her to return. \n\nWe started off with the deviled eggs which was fantastic with perfectly salty crispy bacon. It's half an egg per order. My husband had been a fan of their burgers and ordered it frequently for lunch when we lived steps away from their Townsend location. I'd noticed he'd left a portion of it untouched and it was apparent he wasn't intending to finish it. He mentioned he was underwhelmed and it was not the same burger he used to love. \n\nI had the burrata toast with the honey glazed bacon. The bacon was extremely fatty and too sweet and did not go very well with the burrata, I thought. Salty bacon, yes but not the sweet bacon, no. \n\nI liked the new space.

I opted for the 20min wait since it was a casual catch up with a friend. While you wait, you're able to sit outside by the trees and get your drinks brought to you, which was nice!\n\nFood: Expensive (like $13 an appetizer and $30 for an entree) but delicious! My friend and I got 4 appetizers and a dessert to share. My favorite was easily the shrimp crepe. The sauce was so on point! We also got an asparagus dish ($13 ish for 5 asparagus and some pancetta lol), jumbo shrimp cocktail (great spice on the shrimp), and brussel sprout chips (crispy yumminess).

Seems like it's everyone's favorite lunch spot! Luckily there was a table open for us and we got seated right away.\n\nI ordered the chicken sandwich and the boyfriend ordered the shrimp roll. The fried chicken sandwich didn't look as big but once I was halfway, I knew I couldn't finish the second half but forced myself too because I was starving and because it was good. The shrimp roll was also really delicious. And it wasn't small so it's well worth the money. \n\nBoth our orders came with fries and a horesradish aioli. The aioli was really good. It wasn't too strong in flavor but good enough to spread in my fried chicken sandwich without overbearing the already tasteful sandwich.\n\nIt's kind of loud so it's hard to have an intimate conversation here, but not loud where you have to yell at each other just to be heard. I, however, had a hard time hearing my server but that's also because he was pretty tall and didn't have much space to lean in towards us. He also probably had a hard time hearing us because he didn't put in our order of brussel sprout chips, so I guess I have to come back just to try it.\n\nAlso, the food takes awhile to come out.

It was very busy at noon, pretty much fully seated, but I had a reservation. We ordered and received in order:\n\n\n--- baked oyster: good\n--- gem salad: TOO SALTY\n--- steak tartare: TOO SALTY\n--- burrata: good (becuz I told them to take the salt off)\n--- fries: good (becuz I told them to take the salt off)\n\nThe gem salad is just a plain salad. A few crispy leaves of lettuce sprinkled with so much salt and dressing that I couldn't taste anything but the salt. I was very looking forward to the steak tartare (being an omnivore), but it was again, so salty that I almost cried. After these two dishes, I intercepted the waitress to ask her to cut the salt out of the remaining two dishes. The burrata and fries were, now with the salt taken off, tasting like actual food. But were they really good? I mean, how do you screw up burrata and fries? You can't, unless you had salted them, but I prevented them from doing that, so it was edible, and that's about as much as I can say about their food: it's edible.\n\nThere's some similarity in their dishes to say, what Beretta in the Mission provides. But Beretta is 100 times better. Their menu is more interesting, their drinks more fancy, their decor just as hip, and I never had to ask them to cut the salt.\n\nSo there, sorry, Marlowe.

We ordered a diet coke, bloody mary, 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, brussel sprout chips, broccolini, and a marlowe burger (medium rare). It took about 15 minutes for a bloody mary and diet coke to come out. When the food came out, the marlowe burger was well done. We would have told someone had someone came to check on us, but nope. One thing that can be said is the brussel sprout chips were delicious. So was the broccolini. This is probably the saving grace, and the only reasons I gave 2 stars. \n\nThe service, terrible. We noticed they put us in this nook/cranny area in the front where the big bay windows were. No biggie. The issue began to arise when it took forever to get our initial order in. As I mentioned earlier, it took about 15 minutes to get our drink order. Mind you, it was a diet coke and bloody mary. How long does a diet coke take to pour? 15 minutes apparently. I noticed the food took a little longer. Especially because a table of 4 who sat down approximately 20 minutes after us received their food before we did. (Yaaayyyyyy... -_-) \n\nLet's proceed to the check. Remember how we were sitting near the bay window? Yes... We watched our server walk out the door. Yep. Right out the door. Didn't even bother to tell us she was leaving. No check. Maybe someone else was taking over? After waiting for 15 minutes, we finally asked the hostess what was going on. She then proceeded to tell us that we had no specific waiter, and it was pooled. I don't really care. Just give me my tab and let me get out of this place.\n\nTipped the bare minimum since I used to work in the service industry. Maybe that's why I was so aware of how ridiculous the service was. It wasn't even busy, which makes it even more ridiculous. I've never left less than 15%. Today was the day. Food was lacking. I spent over $80 total, just to get annoyed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-04", "description": "I did some Googling on my drive into San Francisco and it seemed clear to me that my first meal should be Marlowe. I like burgers, I like horseradish. What else could be done?\n\nI hadn't eaten anything substantial for about 8 hours by the time I got to Marlowe, so I went all out: I ordered myself the roasted bone marrow, and the Marlowe burger.\n\nHaving never had bone marrow before, I can compare it to anything. But it was so delicious. I'm not sure if it was because of how ravenously hungry I was, but that bone marrow tasted much like what I would imagine God's semen would taste like. Salty, but so deeply umami. I wanted to bathe myself in it, just so that I could lick my arms throughout the remaining day and still taste it.\n\nI ordered the Marlowe burger cooked medium, and what I got was decidedly rare, but it, too, was absolutely delicious. There was not a bad thing about it, really. The fries were perfectly seasoned, the horseradish aioli was perfection. It didn't seem like the horseradish aioli was on the burger, just some mayo I think, as I didn't taste any horseradish on the burger itself.\n\nI ate every single bite of everything. They delivered a free (\"a gift for you!\") deviled egg before my meal, even. My first deviled egg ever. It was, you know, an egg...\n\nThe place itself, the waitresses and all, is very typical \"nice-ish bar/restaurant\". Nothing interesting or unique about it. This was the first restaurant I've been to (disclaimer: I am low class) where after you move your silverware and napkin yourself, the waitresses move them back into position before serving your food. Both me and the other solo guy sitting across from me got complimentary silverware re-placements twice I think. So fancy!...? \n\nAfter my meal I walked the 30 minutes to Union Square, saw a play (surprisingly about digital pedophiles?!) and went back to my hotel room to go to sleep. Right as I was trying to fall asleep, maybe 4 hours after eating at Marlowe, I started to feel extremely nauseated and couldn't sleep. Short story even shorter, I had to run to the bathroom where I emptied my stomach into the toilet. Probably the most uncomfortable instance of throwing up I've ever suffered through. But after I felt just fine, fell asleep with no problem (aside from that I felt like I had chunks of puke in my throat that no amount of water would wash away), and the next day I felt 100% all better.\n\nMy suspicion is that my \"not medium\" burger was just a little too rare. I really don't know. It's been a long time since any kind of food made me do that. The main thing is that the food was totally delicious and I am willing to accept the fact that I puked my guts out as a outlier that isn't at all representative of the place. That said... probably won't be eating there again when I visit SF. Too many other choices!", "author": "Brad R."}

A deep shelled oyster cup held a barely roasted oyster as well as a spoonful of a flavorful chowder. They were served on a bed of rock salt, a beautiful presentation. The chowder underscored the freshness of the oyster and provided some substantiality to the appetizer bite.\n\nI also ordered the shrimp cocktail. Five prawns, delicately peeled but with the heads still attached for sucking, came accompanied with a spicy cocktail sauce that the waitress recommended squeezing lemon into. They were luscious, barely cooked, flavorful, and the roe from the head heightened the luxury of the bites.\n\nCocktails were perfectly executed, and the wine selection isn't bad either.

She explained the chef on a daily basis rations their mushrooms for their polenta. I understand and respect policy, however it was 10 minutes before the kitchen was closing and more importantly, it was just poor customer service to at least not talk to the kitchen staff(even it was just for show). Further, the hostess came over to explain the same policy with even more of a staunch attitude. Our waitress had to repeat our order several times, was a bit too eager to repeatedly remind us that the kitchen was closing soon, and in general was twitchy with a subtle \"let me out of here\" attitude. As my buddy was openly trying to rationalize to our table their #MushroomPolicy we caught her rolling her eyes as she was walking by. In her defense, she did keep checking in on us and refilled our water glasses several times.\n\nThe Steamed Clams were decent(if not a bit bland), the Brussels Sprouts side was pedestrian, the Steak Tartare was again bland. In general, none of the dishes we shared were spectacular. I will say, the Chocolate Cream Pie and the Strawberry and Rhubarb Crisp desserts were solid. \n\nThe space is quaint, small, intimate, and there were several long communal tables.

Love it! Great service makes Joyce happy always.  Food, I don't know how to describe it because seeing the great reviews here kinda makes me think maybe I just unfortunately ordered wrong food last time LMAO.  I know the chef tried very hard, but I found interesting (let's say, interesting) the taste he/she was determined to go with. The salad was unbelievably sour. Understanding it was supposed to be a little sour my friend and I were still shocked how sour it was. We couldn't finish it.  Sad. The burger and shrimp roll were fairly good but there was no surprise, and thinking the price we both agreed it was not worth it.  Oh their French Fries was awesome.

Street parking was available within a block.  Glad we had an Open Table reservation, it was fairly crowded.  Nice and bright inside because of the big windows, vibrant young crowd there.\n\nThere's a solid menu with lots of interesting choices.  We started a half-dozen oysters (versus the bruleed winter citrus), and they were very good, fresh miyagis with a good mignonette and scallions to go with.  We had heard the burgers were good, but went with the crispy chicken sandwich and the polenta instead.  The chicken sandwich was really good with bacon and aioli.  You can get it with a green salad if you want to pass on the french fries.  The polenta came with a perfect poached egg on top and was very good and gluten-free friendly.\n\nThey did a great job on a coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce on a crispy meringue dessert (another gluten-free item!).  The only slightly disappointing thing was the coffee, I ordered an Americano, but it seemed a bit lukewarm and tasted like brewed coffee.\n\nThe server Akeisha was really friendly and helpful and well-supported by the rest of the crew.   I would definitely come back for brunch again and perhaps dinner, too.", "author": "Dan L."}

We didn't mind, we just got drinks and appetizers first somewhere else. Even at 8:45, we had to waiting 20 minutes or so for your table, though. \n\nBest things on the menu include the bone marrow (to die for!) and the steak dish. The steak comes with these mushrooms that I would definitely go back for. The pork chop was okay, but I've had better.

And I was not disappointed. \n\nThe restaurant is located directly across from the Cal Trans station, with a relatively small dining room. I was there on the early side (1145am) and sat & was served quickly.  The sandwich was a gem of a fried chicken- more refined than gluttonous, and very flavorful with a nice mix of greens to compliment the chicken.  The fries were a bit lackluster but did the job just fine.  But the sandwich will entice me to eventually return for another someday soon, and I would also like to give the dinner menu a try as well.

I'm in love.\n\nIt's really hard to land a spot at Marlowe for lunch without a reservation, but when you do it's pure gold. From the chic atmosphere, super friendly and personable service, the small (easy to manage) menu, to delicious food, I have not had this awesome of an experience in SoMa for lunch in awhile. \n\nOrdered:\nDi Stefano Burrata: Funky pickled? fruit on top of some sort of indian spice inspired topping over soft bread and vinaigrette. I don't even know how to describe it but it was unexpected and absolutely amazing. Highly recommend. \n\nSteak Tartare: Really easy to share and perfectly seasoned. It had a bite at the end that was not exactly spicy, but left you satisfied after every bite and going back for more. \n\nSpice Jumbo Gulf Shrimp: So here's the thing. I'm SUPER freaked out by heads and eyeballs on my food. After being thoroughly freaked out, my friend kindly took it apart for me so I could try them. Safely separated and peeled, the shrimp was juicy, sweet, cleaned (some places really do forget to clean their shellfish..ehk, but not Marlowe) and really good.\n\nMarlowe Burger: It came recommended and I didn't have any regrets ordering it.

I have been trying to come here and have their bone marrow for months and I finally got a chance to dine here. Street parking right outside but I'm not sure how it usually is, we just got lucky maybe. \n\nWe have heard that you come here, grab drinks and mostly eat appetizers. That is what they do well here. They have entrees but it's not really their pride and joy. We came a bit early so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I got a beer and my girl got the wine mixed drink of the day which she seemed to enjoy. Shortly after receiving our drinks we were ushered to our seats. \n\nMost of the small restaurant is communal seating so you might be sitting on a picnic table next to complete strangers. They do have normal restaurant seating but it just depends on how big your group is. We were only two so we got a two person table. We ordered the bone marrow, steak tartare, brussel sprout chips and the burger to share.\n\nThe sprout chips were very tasty with a lemon zing but after a while it got heavy because the oil starts to collect at the bottom. Can't eat too many on your own or it leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. It is meant to share for sure. The steak tartare was good and came with crostinis. It was good but it lacked seasoning. The bone marrow was so bomb. It comes with two bone halves and crostinis as well as capers to spread together and the whole thing was buttery, fatty, delciousness. I love bone marrow. The burger came and they were nice enough to split it into halves and put the different halves on different plates for us to enjoy. I really liked that. The burger itself was dry but the fries were good and came with a horseradish aioli.\n\nThe service was nice, attentive and the appetizers came out quickly. Other than an underachieving steak tartare and burger, everything else was great and the dimly lit atmosphere was perfect for a casual date out with my lady. I would like to come back again to try the baked oysters and get more bone marrow. Maybe order two orders!", "author": "Jeromy G."}

The entire experience was wonderful and I highly recommend it!\n\nWe had an 8:30 reservation. We arrived a few minuets early and the hostess was warm and welcoming; our table was not yet free, but it opened up around 8:35p. I was impressed that those waiting for tables could order drinks without even needing to go to the bar.\n\nThe vibe was great--it's a relatively small place, with the tables pretty close together, and that creates a really nice buzz. The noise level was energetic but not so loud that we could not enjoy each other's company and conversation. The decor was nice--rustic modern. There was enough lighting to see the menus. It just felt like the perfect energy and space for a special dinner out with friends.\n\nService was top-notch throughout the whole meal: our server was knowledgeable and friendly but not intrusive. She answered questions about the cocktails and menu with complete ease. Our water glasses never went unfilled. Pacing was spot-on and dishes were cleared quickly. A totally seamless evening, just like you want at a nice restaurant.\n\nThe cocktails were gorgeous. The Boulevardier was perfectly mixed and served at exactly the right temperature. A negroni used Aperol and this lightened the bitterness a bit for a really smooth drink. The Pimm's Cup was refreshing and well-made. The wine list was also appealing--nice selections and of manageable size. When we ordered a bottle for our main courses, they timed the pouring perfectly.\n\nThe food was great--everything was well-executed. The crispy Brussels sprouts chips were a salty, crunchy way to whet the appetite. The burrata, served on tasty bread with fresh figs on top, had wonderful flavor. An squash soup was a perfect way to begin autumn, and the summer squash caesar, perfectly dressed, was a nice take on the kale caesar phenomenon.\n\nMains impressed, too. The chicken was perfect--moist and juicy, and the sweet potato puree and pancetta/Brussels sprouts hash was a great accompaniment. The pork chop was perfectly cooked--it retained its moisture despite the thickness. The polenta with mushrooms and parmesan, topped with some fresh arugula, was rich and earthy; it was great to have a vegetarian dish of this quality.\n\nTruly perfect execution of every element--service, drinks, atmosphere, food.", "author": "Craig P."}

She was doing her job by stopping by once in a while but let's just say she was a bummer every time she came to the table.\n\nI ended up ordering the steak with fries and it was ok. A bit pricey for the quality and quantity. The lady's veggie dish was a lot better and the deviled eggs with bacon were pretty solid.\n\nAnd the other bummer is they don't serve cocktails. Really?! I wasn't in the mood for wine so I had to settle for beer.

It's creamy without being mushy. The mushrooms are al dente and incredibly flavorful. I don't normally like arugula, but it's perfect in this dish. OH MAN I REALLY WANT THE POLENTA RIGHT NOW.\n+ The cocktails: Hand-crafted with art. My favorite -- and I've had plenty -- is the Baker. It's sweet but has a bite, and the fresh orange peel makes it pretty. I'm a sucker for a single giant, solid ice cube in a cocktail, too. \n+ The other food: I love the chicken fried okra, though I admit it's a bit saltier than it needs to be. The burger can be satisfying, and the crispy brussels sprout chips are always great. Even the pork chop (which is never my favorite item on a menu) is good. \n\nThe only time I've ever had a bit of a complaint: the bone marrow. It's tasty, but the first time I ordered it, the marrow was burnt on one end and I couldn't even break it out of the bone. When you're paying $17 for a single bone's worth, you want the whole thing. Thankfully the staff brought out another one gratis, but it was the same way! I guess two halves make a whole.\n\nI'm nervous posting this review because I don't want it to be harder to get into Marlowe than it already is -- but it's a necessary post of praise.", "author": "Amanda D."}

The addition of the course salt as a nice little extra crunch with each bite. The portion is decent and easily feeds 2 to 3 people. We enjoyed them all the way to the bottom of the porcelain white bowl.\n\nSteamed Manila Clams: Oh my, Oh my. These were my FAVORITE part of the meal. Tender, salty gems steamed with a white wine reduction and mirepoix. The garlic flavored broth was a magnificent liquid to slurp (quietly) along with the Clams as well as to dunk the the toast covered in a garlic aioli in. \n\nCertified Angus 8oz New York Steak w/ Fries: A sometimes tough cut of meat cooked to a near perfect Medium Rare served with very crunchy and garlic-y Frites. My steak was tender and mildly salty, the splash of Red Wine sauce supported the meat while enhancing the smoky undertones. Typically, I am not an eater of fries/ frites, however these were actually pretty tasty, loved the crunch factor, they seemed more light and air-y and the average frie.\n\nGrilled Niman Pork Chop w/ Stinging Nettle Risotto, Figs and Spinach: Pork Chops grilled to a charred perfection. The sweetness of the Figs added a great balance to the salty meat, brining with it an earth flavor. Stinging Nettle Risotto was decent, cooker perfectly, but lacked any big PUNCH, I think a touch of lemon juice or lemon zest would have made the Risotto pop.\n\nUpon completion of a wonderful meal we were given dessert menus, but did not see anything that caught our attention. Our check was given to us promptly and after handing over my debt card, we chatted and finished the last sips of our wine.\n\nWhen getting ready to leave we noticed many more coats had joined the hooks and asked where our jacket was placed, however no one seemed to know. The servers were very helpful while trying to assist us in finding the jacket, hobbling around in an Air Cast/ Boot in such a tiny space was not easy, but I was thankful for their kindness in helping us locate it. \n\nIn closing, we really enjoyed our meal here and are glad we had an opportunity to try the fares at Marlowe.", "author": "Meghan L."}

My husband picked me up from the Airport after a VERY LONG flight with a promise of a nice lunch.  \n\nWe decided to stop somewhere in San Francisco for a quick bite.  Not having any idea where to go, we were driving, went to Yelp and found Marlowe.\n\nFrom THE moment we stepped in the door we knew this was exactly what we wanted.  We were ushered to the bar where two seats awaited us.  The ambiance is wonderful.\n\nThe bartender helped us navigate the cocktail menu to find just the right mix of yum.  Mine was a twist on a Margarita (big yum) and Hubby had The Butcher.  Perfect balance of sweet/savory.   The wine choices for lunch were also quite nice.  Again, the bartender was ready and willing to help and gave us tastes to make sure we loved them.  We did.\n\nWe sampled the OH SO AWESOME deviled eggs with just the right hint of bacon.  Truth be told, we could have eaten 12 more.  We dined on the Shrimp (heads on) with a spicy, tangy sauce and the Burrata.  It was creamy with the right amount of crunch coming from the bread.  Heaven.  \n\nFor our entrees we split the risotto (cooked perfectly) and washed it down with another glass of white.  Dessert was the real surprise.  We ordered the Coffee Ice Cream and Meringue cookie dessert.  It was a wonderful combination.  Cool, sweet, Coffee ice cream, a little bit of chocolate syrup and a chewie cookie.  Could not have asked for more. \n\nThe staff was friendly and warm, the food was carefully prepared and overall, it really felt like this place was created just for us, out of a dream. \n\nHats off to Marlowe...we'll be back!", "author": "Stephanie D."}

I asked Cherylynn what she thought and she said it's still good, but everything's better your first time!  And I'm like, not everything, especially for a girl/woman...hehe...Oh c'mon ladies, you know what I'm talking about!\n\nAnywho, I was able to snag a reservation for 4 on a Saturday night for a double date with Cherylynn and her bf.  I like the decor, but upon arrival I noticed that it was smaller than I thought it would be.  The four of us shared for an appetizer the Brussel Sprout chips ($9).  Each couple shared their own order of bone marrow ($13) & since he & I weren't that hungry we shared their famous burger ($14), which they were so kind to split it for us at no additional cost.  Brussel sprout chips were a nice starter.  They were seasoned well, but lacked oomph.  I feel like this was the weakest dish of the three that we sampled.  I think Vault 164's brussel sprout chips are better.  Next came the marrow.  I've been craving bone marrow after not having it so long.  This is where the \"it's always better your first time\" line applies!  I had it in October for the first time and I must say that restaurant's marrow was better.  This one was still probably the star of the dinner, but it looked to be a good hefty portion, but wasn't too much.  It was also a lot oilier than the other one I had.  But I liked the heat from the salsa verde.  The crostinis the marrow was served with was a little burnt.  Finally our split burger came out, Cherylynn did warn us though that it's a little smaller than other similar gourmet burgers you get at restaurants though.  And it was indeed!  There weren't as many fries as I thought there would be either.  The burger was cooked perfect and was super juicy.  And you gotta love how it comes already with caramelized onions, cheese and bacon.  What makes their burger different is the horseradish aioli.  We both love our aioli but I'm not really a horseradish fan, but this one was faint enough where it was offensive.  However, I feel like I could really only taste the horseradish and a little bit of the beef in the burger, not so much the onions or cheese or bacon.  Cherylynn's polenta looked good with the poached egg and wild mushrooms.  Eric's grilled pork chop looked hearty, but the sausage it was served with was burnt looking (though the waitress said it was supposed to be).  \n\nService was slow and not so attentive, except for when the busboy kept wanting to clear the table of plates.  Parking is fairly easy on the weekend (& cheap) when there's no game or event going on.  Make reservations as Marlowe gets packed (more so on the weekdays though).  Marlowe is a solid 3 - 3.5ish stars in my book.  I'm glad I checked it off my list, but don't see all the hype necessarily in it.  I think for the price too I was expecting a little more. I'm not sure if I'd come back to Marlowe, but I'm curious about the owners' Park Tavern restaurant.", "author": "Cat C."}

The staff was very accommodating and even though we arrived about thirty minutes early for our reservation, they still managed to find a space for us relatively quickly. \n\nThe food was good but in my opinion a little overpriced for what it was. I got the steak and although it was a well cooked New York steak, I'd say the portion size was not as large as I had expected. \n\nMy brother got the chicken and his girlfriend got the pork. I'd say the chickens is probably the best dish out of the three that we tried. \n\nLoved the atmosphere though.

They were very accommodating, easy to make a reservation, and their service was awesome. I know large groups are always more difficult but they were understanding and patient with us. \n\nI got to try:\n*pimms cup: very refreshing for a hot day! I could barely taste the alcohol which is a plus for me personally. The ginger ale and cucumber definitely made it much better.  I wish I had gotten the ginger beer instead though. \n*deviled egg: i am dumb and I thought one order of deviled egg would be one whole egg aka two halves of the egg but one order meant just half the egg and I had to share this with a friend which made us look very sad and pitiful BUT it was still delicious regardless. (Don't judge we were very distracted when we were ordering)\n*fried chicken sandwich: OMG SO CRISPY. It was like McChicken on steroids. And dude, McDonald's is awesome. \n*crab crepe: I wish the plating was prettier. It kinda looked like a salad with weird brown stuff on the bottom. But it was actually really delicious plus I appreciated the greens too. The salad was tangy which balanced out the crepe that was smothered in this aioli type of sauce. I would definitely get this again next time. It was a bit on the salty side but it's okay. \n\nOverall, the decor, ambience, service, and food--basically everything had nothing to complain about!

Its just a different way of serving it, and it was really good. Served with a fig sauce to make it even yummier. \n\nBurrata - mostly salad with hazelnuts, but very good. I might have licked the plate had I been at home. Lol!\n\nBone marrow - bone marrow is always good in my book. This was good but didn't stick out. A little too garlicky. The first plate they gave us was a little rare inside. We weren't sure if it was okay to eat, so they took it back and gave us another. We night have eaten it anyway, but twice was definitely a plus! I would still get this again. \n\nEntree was the Steak. It was good enough. We shared it between 3 of us. Typical steak, spinach, shallots. \n\nDessert: the chocolate coke was way too rich.

Expensive for a deviled egg though. \n-Di Stefano Burrata Toast: I am in love with burrata, but this was not my preferred method of eating burrata. The curry flavor makes it interesting; however, not great. \n-Burger: The Marlowe burger is pretty well known - based on 7x7 magazine. Decided since my friend and I were here together, we'd try it. There was a bit too much bread for the burger itself. Not too bad, but not amazing either.  Needed more sauce. \n-Rum soaked nectarine split: first off we tried to tell the waitress we had to get somewhere and to make the dessert on the fly.

Marlowe had been in my bookmarks since forever, so we finally ventured out to Marlowe on a Friday night. I had read a few reviews about how the restaurant is pretty small and reservations are definitely recommended. So, I made reservations about a week in advance just in case it got pretty packed. And when we arrived, the whole restaurant was packed and there were even people waiting! Lucky us! :) Anyways, the two of us shared the following:\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips: I really really really like brussels sprouts so when I heard they were made like chips, I knew I was going to like them! AND I did like them! :) The brussels sprout were seasoned in lemon and sea salt. They were so addicting! I ate them like it was nothing! They were very crispy and had that hint of lemon. It wasn't too overly salty. I would definitely order this again!\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow: I think Marlowe's bone marrow might just be my favorite! I have tried bone marrow at a couple other restaurants and nothing compares to Marlowe's. It was flavorful, rich, and buttery. There were very thick chunks, a perfect portion size to put on top of the crostini. I felt like I didn't even really need to put the salsa verde sauce with it. It was good enough on its own.\n\nMarlowe Burger: The kitchen was very nice enough to split the burger and fries in half for us! :) The burger came with caramelized onions, cheddar, and bacon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I really really really liked the burger. It was delicious and one of the better burgers I have had. Each bite melted in my mouth. The burger was very juicy, yet it didn't leak anything onto the plate. I really liked the fries that came along with it. It was very crispy. Mmm.. Everything about this dish was just delicious!\n\nVanilla Bean Panna Cotta Affogato: The dessert came with amaretto, lemon biscotti. It was a bit bitter when we took our first bite. However, we mixed the espresso that was poured on top of the panna cotta and it made it less bitter. With the mixture, it was light and delicious. It didn't make you feel too heavy after eating it. The biscotti complemented very well with the panna cotta. I only wished there were more than two pieces though. Overall, a really great dessert to end the meal. \n\nI think I would definitely be back for the exact dish items we ordered that night. Everything was just delicious and prices were very reasonable. It was not expensive at all! Service was great too. Our plates were changed frequently and our water cups were never empty. As for parking, we found meter parking right across the street. Since we came after 6pm, it's only 25 cents per hour! What a deal!! Just make sure in advance that you book reservations to save time from waiting! :)", "author": "Philana C."}

They would have been exceptional however all of us agreed that our main dishes were just a little on the salty side. Not horribly but enough that we all commented that they would have been better had the salt been held back a bit. The one other thing that brought my star rating for Marlow was that after making a reservation more than a week in advance the table they had set aside for us a party of 3 was the worst table in the house. Next to the bathroom and waiters hallway. I could have said something but resisted as we had a guest with us from Europe and I didn't wish to make a fuss. We gave him the seat which I thought he wouldn't notice our location however after dinner he mentioned how awful he thought it was they gave us that table. For that I am giving one less star. Our cocktails were exceptional! The service was great too.", "author": "Steven B."}

We got seating at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. But that was just fine, I especially like to see bartenders at work. The bartender at Marlowe was especially good at service. She made suggestions when we asked, offered extra bread, and importantly, made great drinks. Other than the burger we also ordered the bone marrow and Brussel sprout chips (appetizer). Both were great, but the bone marrow, in all its fatty goodness, was absolutely drool inducing.", "author": "Seema K."}

I don't. My mind makes them out to be boring and tough. Not Marlowe though, they work their magic on this under rated slab of pig meat, load it up with blood sausage, pumpkin pudding and maple apples and turn it into something exciting and review worthy!\n\nHow many times did granny have to yell at you to eat your brussels sprouts?

Greeted by the warmest of humans, Georgia, she graciously told us that there would be a bit of a wait (understandably, as the place was adorable and completely packed). My companion and I sighed inwardly, ready to eat our own limbs to stave off the hunger. I don't know if Georgia has a sixth sense about hungry humans, or if she is just naturally that beautiful (inside and out), but she slyly figured out a way to stow our bags, whisk us to a table, and smile as if it wasn't any big deal in the whole 5 minutes of our interaction.\n\nVictory has never been sweeter. \n\nThe drinks were divine.

Good overall but every good point seemed to have a balancing counterpoint.\n\nThe interior is airy and bright and I like the decor.  So it should've been relaxing except that the tables are too close together.  There were only about six inches  between ours and the next.  I imagine it'd be especially awkward if you were there on a dinner date.  Having just one less table in each long row would give everyone a little more breathing room without sacrificing too much business.\n\nThe food was good.  The shrimp roll was tasty and the shrimp itself was just firm enough.  I also liked the horseradish aioli that came with my fries.  I stole a brussels sprout chip from my lunch buddy and even though I don't like brussels sprouts, I could see myself eating more of these.  I didn't feel like we got our money's worth, though.  I've either had better or cheaper elsewhere in the City.\n\nI didn't order the burger since I'm saving that for a visit to nearby Marlowe Burger.  I saw a lot of burgers ordered by other customers.  That's a good sign.  I can't yet bring myself to pay $16 for a burger, though.  It just feels wrong.\n\nService was speedy and friendly: seated right away, got drinks and ordered within minutes.  Our server was really helpful and responsive to our questions.  The food came out surprisingly fast.  The flipside was that my plate was almost taken away with half my fries.

I wanted to come back as soon as I left, and needless to say I will be back.\n\nWe arrived about 45 minutes early for our reservation.  We were greeted by the hostess who informed us that all tables were currently spoken for...she was apologetic and invited us to have a drink at the bar.  No problem at all - we knew we were way early and half expected to have to wait.  We ordered our drinks at the bar, and even before getting the drinks the hostess let us know one of her tables opened up and that we could be seated right away - great news because we were starving!\n\nWe ordered: brussels sprout chips, baked oysters, bone marrow, and black cod for her entree and polenta for mine.  I'm fairly certain you can see all of these in the pictures here - all were delicious and were healthy in portion size.  I could say a lot more in detail, but frankly, I think it suffices to say that everything was amazing and I couldn't find fault with any of the food.\n\nService was very prompt, attentive, and friendly.  The venue was about the only thing I might complain about, and it's a minor complaint at that.  This place is very small - probably only seats 30-40 people for dining with a handful of bar stools at the bar.  The fact that there isn't much space means that you are often very cozy with your neighbors whether you want to be or not.  Such is life in SF restaurants, I guess.  Again - no big deal, it's just the only bad thing I could think of.\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience.  We got 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 3 drinks for $118 before tip.  Decide not to have drinks and we paid $80 for the food.  Not bad at all when you consider both the portions and the quality of the food/ingredients.  Service was top notch.  Love this place.

The place itself is cozy and the service is good. I wasn't overwhelmed by a unique ambiance or stellar service, but, like I said, it was good. Five of us went here for my best friend's bach party and personally I was a little disappointed they didn't give her a complimentary drink or small dessert. They knew why we were there, but I guess they have a lot of special occasions; however, when you have a $400 bill, it's nice to get some special attention for the guest of honor.\n \nNow, on to the food. For the appetizers: portions small, taste BIG (hence, the 4 stars). Amazing decadent, rich flavors abounded. The five of us shared 4 appetizers- a salad, the (small) crap crepes, burrata toast, and Brussel crisps (just the outside leaves flash fried). The flavors of all of them, even the simple salad, were extraordinary. However, everyone's favorite seemed to be the burrata toast. The portion was slightly larger than other starters, which was nice for sharing, but the dish itself was just exquisite and flavorful. I would also get the crab crepes again (they were small, but special). I'd skip the Brussels and salad- you can get great Brussels sprouts and quality salads a lot of places.\n \nFor an entr\u00e9e I ordered the scallops with white beans. They were good, but slightly overcooked, and I wasn't wowed by the overall flavor pairing with the white beans (a bit bland). Both of the people who had the steak entr\u00e9e had small issues too- the medium was undercooked (pink meat) and the medium rare was overcooked (no pink meat). Most likely, they got switched. I wouldn't get the scallops again, but I was happy to try them once.\n \nThe cuchilla tequila cocktail was lovely. Great drink for tequila lovers!\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our time here; however, I would try some place else before coming back. I REALLY wanted to love it, but the hands-off service approach coupled with the high price tag and non-stellar entrees made it a pre-dinner appetizers/cocktails place to me.

After reading about Marlowe having one of the top burgers in the City, well, I had a hour and some change to order my dinner and literally take ten steps to my train.  \n\nIt was a Monday night after 7:30pm and the place was absolutely rammed and packed.  You know the scene of nice restaurants that are usually less than packed on weeknights when it's \"slower\"?  Not at Marlowe.  This place was operating at full capacity with a hectic and frenzied dining room environment.  \n\nI had to wait even for a single stool to be open at the bar area.  Once I sat there, the main order expeditor guy was busily doing this thing in front of the food delivery area while he also tried to take orders for us at the bar.  While I had his brief attention, I asked him for a burger and a bottled beer.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't been here, the place is pretty dark inside.  It's so dark that you can't even see your food clearly that sits right in front of you.  When I got my burger, I could not even fully see all the ingredients in my burger.  I'm not saying that this was like \"dining in the dark\" restaurants but it certainly felt a little bit like that.\n\nMy burger and beer were great!  I can't complain about tasty food and it is a $16 burger and fries but it was definitely delicious and worth trying.  I'm not sure if my experience at the bar is different from those parties seated at the tables but I just didn't get any sort of welcome from this place.  Yes they have a lot of tasty delicious things on their menu but sitting at the bar, there's really nobody who talks to you to check on you unless you grab their attention because you need something.  \n\nI sincerely wish and hope for the best for Marlowe as they move from their Townsend location to 4th and Brannan.

It's filled with so many people to make it lively, yet you can still hear your friends when speaking to each other across the table! Their drink menu isn't very comprehensive IMO, and they aren't stocked up with various types of liquor to make you others. I think the waitresses are amazing! Ours checked up on us multiple times, and always made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nThe food is somewhere in between \"Ehh I can get this elsewhere..\" and \"OMG I NEED MORE OF YOU IN MY BELLY!\" depending on what you get. My favorite thing from the entire night was the bone marrow. Not many places serve this, because it's a little hard to come by, and not all the places that do serve it do it right. I'm glad to say that Marlowe does Bone Marrow perfectly, and I'd happily come back for more. That being said, their burger was okay; it wasn't amazing and i definitely felt like I could buy it anywhere. \n\nThe main thing that makes this a 3-star experience was the wait for our table. We came 15 minutes early for our reservation at 9:30. We were told that we should be seated early. Our table was ready to go at about 9:25 or so, but when it came time to seat us, our hostess was busy chatting it up with co workers...and the table was literally right in front of her. We weren't seated for 15 minutes, and we were ravenous. \n\nI'd still come back though (hopefully I'll be seated at the right time) and get my fill of bone marrow :D", "author": "Thuy T."}

Enjoyed this dish.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow: flavorful, rich, maybe a little too much to go with the duck. I would get one or the other.\n\nMarlowe Burger: Definitely a fan of this one. The meat is super juicy and flavorful. The cheddar went perfectly with the caramelized onions. Wished the fries were a little more crispy than soft.\n\nPork Chop: this one was definitely my favorite. The pork was so soft and tender and practically melted in your mouth. I was impressed by the side veggies as well. The flavors of the pork were definitely infused into the veggies.

For dinner, I ordered the Poulet Vert with pancetta, Brussels sprouts hash and sweet potato puree. Absolutely delicious.

Everything was good though not great, and consistently too salty.  The sprout chips, polenta, and steak were especially salty, so if you want any of these then it's advisable to tell them you have hypertension and have them put half the normal amount of salt.\n\nI found the service here just ok.  They're not especially friendly or descriptive, but it's not terrible either.\n\nI felt the prices here were on the high side for what you get.  The beets especially were kind of ridiculous at $12 for the small amount you get.  Last time there I shared the beets, had two glasses of wine, the steak and a dessert and it came to $90 after tax and tip -- too pricey and not a good value.

Easily found street parking close by (the surrounding area is well lit) and were greeted by 2 courteous hostesses. Because we were really early for our time slot, we waited in this little standing area and an upbeat server took our drink orders and within minutes we had the drinks in our hands.\n\nWe were seated 15 minutes before our reservation in a little corner by their kitchen. The smells, draft, and harsh white lighting from the kitchen took away from the cozy ambience that the rest of the restaurant was experiencing. It was a full house and a late reservation, so by the kitchen is where we stayed. \n\nWe had two solid servers but both seemed very tired and looked a bit disheveled. Because this was a late reservation I don't expect my servers to maintain high levels of energy this late into the evening, but the exhausted feels they were giving out took away from my experience here. \n\nNow the food: first we had the deviled eggs and bone marrow.  I'm actually mad at myself for paying $5 for 1 whole egg. It was good but I wouldn't tell my family and friends to order it. I spread the bone marrow on the toast it came with and could only taste the toast. I couldn't get any flavors from the marrow. (But this is my first time eating bone marrow this way so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but I just don't see the hype that surrounds this dish.)\n\nBut our main dishes?!?! I was literally clapping my hands in enjoyment. He ordered the steak and I ordered the polenta. The steak was cooked perfectly, had salty and sweet flavors throughout the dish and was very filling. The polenta had everything I loved in 1 bowl: arugula, tons of mushroom, Parmesan cheese and egg. Don't let this dish fool you into thinking it's a lighter main course option...oh no. This dish is hearty. \n\nThe tawny port and Loretta's Vacherin (pronounced vash/ra) ended the meal nicely. \n\nOverall, this place is ok depending on where you sit-don't sit by the kitchen (also not a big fan of the communal tables there) and stick to their main courses and make sure to get the Loretta's Vacherin.", "author": "Mae D."}

After my friend told me to pick out a place, I looked through my bookmark list and picked out a couple restaurants. Marlowe was ultimately chosen because it was open until 11pm on a Thursday.  \n\nRESERVATION:\nWe did a walk in, but definitely make reservations!  We walked in close to 9:30pm and the place was still crowded.  Although we only waited about 10 minutes, there were parties still walking in after us.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n*Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips - Delicious!  I'm not a Brussels sprouts type of person, I actually despise them, however the chips were crispy and lightly coated with salt.  Simply delicious!\n *Roasted Bone Marrow - GOOOOD!!  The bone marrow was extremely tasty and was served with a salsa verde sauce which had a tiny kick to it.\n*Steak Tartare - The tartare was good and tender.  It was served with an egg on top, just the way I like it.\n\nMAIN:\n*Marlowe Burger - YUM!!  I knew Marlowe was known for their burger, so that was a must order for me.  In fact, all five in our party ordered the burger.  My burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare and contained caramelized onions, cheddar, and bacon.  Also spread on the bun was a yummy horseradish aioli sauce (an additional dish is served on the side so you could dip your fries).  But note, don't think you can add additional things in the burger, the waitress told us the chef doesn't like people altering her burger.\n\nSERVICE:\nGreat.  We were immediately greeted by the hostess upon walking in.  She mentioned there would be a 10 minute wait but we were welcome to grab a drink and wait at the bar.  Our waitress was friendly.  She was on top of her game and came over immediately when we had an additional friend come by for dinner.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nMarlowe is dimly lit and definitely had a romantic vibe to it.  The noise level was decent in the way where you could hear other parties talking, but it wasn't hard to hear the person you're having a conversation with.\n\nPARKING:\nStreet metered parking, free after 6pm.

Mussels;\n(2) Anson Mills Polenta; and\n(3) Brown Butter Brussels Sprouts.\n\nMy friend had been raving about the brussels sprouts for weeks. Maybe that's why the initial bite was a letdown: my expectations had been built up too high. The first sprout was too salty, though it had a nice char to it. But maybe you shouldn't judge a dish by the first bite because the sprouts really grew on me. Maybe that first sprout was just over salted; maybe I just got used to the salt. Who knows?\n\nThe mussels were flavorful. Correction: the mussels DISH was flavorful, and that was all thanks to the chorizo. I have never seen this combination before. I like the idea in theory, but the chorizo overpowers the mussels. You don't even realize you're eating seafood. You just think you're eating a lot of spicy sausage. Don't get me wrong: the dish is tasty, but if you're expecting to taste mussels, this isn't the dish to order.\n\nThe polenta was nice and creamy with wonderfully sauteed mushrooms and a poached egg (again, I love eggs with most dishes). The arugula was a nice addition because it prevented the polenta from being too monotonous in its texture and buttery taste.\n\nMy problem with the mussels and the polenta, however, was that they were cold when we got it, and I really hate cold food. So while everything was good, they didn't blow me out of the water.\n\nBut then!!! my friend's fiance showed up and ordered the Grilled Niman Pork Chop. It was my favorite dish of the night. Wonderfully seared, juicy, and the apples/spinach/pudding/sausage added great textures and sweetness to the pork chop without masking its flavors. It's hearty and a big portion.\n\nFor dessert (we really indulged tonight), we had the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta Affogato. It was a high note to end on. \n\nFor the pork chop and panna cotta, I give it 4 stars; but if it were just the first 3 dishes we ordered, it would be closer to 3-3.5.", "author": "J J."}

I did happen to be very sick and nothing was very appetizing but I am a burger fan and this didn't hit the spot whatsoever.  I think my biggest issue was the cheddar cheese on it.  I hate cheddar on my burgers and I shouldn't have ordered it bc of that.   It wasn't awful, just not as awesome as I expected after reading all the other reviews.  We also had the warm deviled eggs, which I felt were really over priced for the size of them.  I swear they seemed like mini eggs, lol.  They were tasty though.  \n\nThe place is also very tiny and we were in a corner seat.  In order for the table of 2 next to us to leave their table after eating, we had to get up and move our table into the corner completely and then put it back after they left.

She kept us in mind as our long table was vacated, cleared and then set up for our group.  In particular, she dealt firmly with some diners from a neighboring table who attempted to acquire more real estate for themselves while our table was being prepared.  Our server, a woman from New Zealand, was helpful and efficient as well.  Oh, I should add that I had a very informative conversation about parking with a staff member from the office who phoned the day before to confirm our reservation.  (As long as there's no game at AT&T Park, street parking is plentiful and perfectly cheap.  I paid $0.75 to park while we were at dinner.)\n\nI'm a big fan of trains, by the way, even Caltrain.

At the bar, we tried the New Zealand sauvignon blanc and liked it well enough.  We also tasted a South African chenin blanc that didn't appeal to anyone in our group who interacted with it.  I ordered a glass of Gr\u00fcner Veltliner after rejecting the chenin blanc.  That wine was OK, but it didn't excite me.  The best wine that I had during our visit was the Bonny Doon Clos de Gilroy -- we got a carafe of it.  That wine is really pretty good; I'd forgotten how much I like Randall Grahm.  But there was no \"This is wonderful, thanks for introducing me to this\" moment while we were having dinner.\n\nAs for the food -- YUM!!  I decided before arriving that I'd get a hamburger, and I agree with Michael Bauer and just about everyone else in San Francisco that it's a standout.  I suspect that the only better burger I've had in the City is the one that I ordered at Zuni about twenty years ago late into the night.  But memories can be tricky and there's every rational reason to believe that the Zuni version would go down to defeat in a head-to-head competition.\n\nWhat else did I eat?  I had plenty of the chip-ified Brussels sprouts and tasted the little gem salad, the polenta and the Tcho chocolate cream pie.  They were all plenty good.  I normally don't even like dessert, but I could have had an entire chocolate cream pie on my own.  (We got one to share.)\n\nI except to return and even have fantasies of becoming a regular.  I'll just have to check the baseball schedule to make sure that parking won't be an issue.  In fact, you might enjoy this tidbit: I've been checking the SF Giants schedule off and on just to make sure that I don't get stuck in game traffic when I drive near the City.

Thick rich soup with a hint of truffle oil.\n\nOur dinner took really long to come out; about 30 minutes after we finished our appetizers.

I ordered their famous Marlowe burger which came with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, bacon and fries.  I couldn't resist after other tables around me were eating it.

Perfectly balanced is how I'd describe the burger. Sweetness from the caramelized onions, brightness from the horseradish aoli, the smoky, sweet, and slightly salty bacon, great meat to acme roll ratio. Order it medium rare and the  red meat juice just runs down your hands. Vegetarians just don't understand!

I had a \"country lawyer\" which is Marlowe's take on an old fashioned (I mentioned I was looking for something classic and strong with a base of bourbon )The food menu itself doesn't offer much for choice but you can't really go wrong with the poulet vert or the Marlowe burger (which was about standard as a burger can get, my medium rare was more of a full rare and it was also quite greasy in a good way). \nThe appetizers are pretty scrumptious - half a dozen oysters is certainly the way to go !\nThe only problem I had was the wait time which was really unreasonable. Close to an hour and a half on a Thursday night for our food despite the fact that we had reservations, what really put me off was that other groups that came after us and ordered the same dishes were served in a third of the time. \nI hope to come here again and have a more favorable experience !", "author": "Manish R."}

But it was our server and the manager who made the entire experience at Marlowe terrible. \n\nNot only did we have to wait over an hour to get our entrees, but both server and manager were defensive and were very unapologetic about the situation. Working in the restaurant industry in the past, I totally understand that mistakes happen or the kitchen is backed up. But the problem is that our server did not even follow up on our order until we had to flag a different server. The party of 5 that sat next to us that we're seated 15 minutes after us received and finished their entrees before we even received our entrees. We brought the attention to the manager and he was being very defensive and did not apologize. Our server apologized but it was a half ass apology. \"I'm sorry that you feel that way\" is NOT the correct way to apologize. After we received our entrees, our server pretty much avoided us all night. \n\nHalfway into our meal, the manager comes to us again and finally apologizes and decides to give us dessert on the house.

I arrived a few minutes early for my reservation and was seated promptly, even before my friend arrived. I'm glad they didn't keep me lurking in the doorway. \n\nMy friend and I ordered:\n\n1) BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS: Delicious and so simple. Must have been sprinkled with lemon zest and a bit of salt. A bit oily, but a perfect compliment to any beer. I was so excited to dig in that I forgot to take a photo at first, then I couldn't stop eating them.\n\n2) POLENTA: What a decadent dish - smooth, creamy polenta, thinly sliced mushrooms, a perfectly poached egg, truffle oil, and a pleasant bite from the arugula. The first few bites were to die for. However, the dish got heavy pretty quickly. I would have preferred this dish as an appetizer, or with something to break up the richness. More arugula? Pickled veggies? Fresh fruit?   \n\n3) BURGER: My friend swears by the burger and devoured it before I had even fully stirred in the poached egg for my polenta. Enough said. \n\n4) BAKED CAULIFLOWER: I liked this as an alternate to the potatoes gratin that restaurants often offer as a side. However, it was rather rich, being coated with melted cheese. If I had ordered any entree other than the polenta, I would have appreciated the cauliflower more.\n\nAll in all, the service was excellent and I loved the vibe of the restaurant. The woodsy d\u00e9cor and cozy space makes it a perfect date spot (I'd recommend coming early, as the noise level definitely increased as it got later).

Then we had was the pan seared scallops. It's really tasty with the sauce and at the same time, it still has its seafood taste (nicely cooked). Last but not least, we had the NY steak on top of long peas and spinach with house made fries on the side. We asked for medium rear but it turned out to be medium so it's slightly on the dry side.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-15", "description": "I'll skip the foreplay and get right down to the point...yes, yes, yes, the Marlowe Burger lives up to the hype.  I won't argue with folks like Michael Bauer and yelp reviewers who rave about the Marlowe Burger as the best in San Francisco.  More on the burger after these messages...\n\nBefore I continue, I can't overlook the fries.  I don't recall having better  fries elsewhere.  The thin cut fries were perfectly fried and stayed warm and crispy throughout the entire meal, plus they were flavorful, with a hint of garlic flavor and just enough salt to make the taste alive.  My only qualm is that they don't give you nearly enough fries with the burger.  Mine had less than a handful.  Puh-leaze folks, it's a $13 burger, you can't add a few more fries? \n\nBy the way, I hate brussel sprouts with a passion - hated em since I was a kid.  So a restaurant that successfully feeds me these bastardly little critters deserves seriously big ups in my book.  Granted, they did it by stripping the brussel sprouts of all nutritional value and by deep frying them to a crisp, and squeezing lemon and adding sea salt.  In other words, Marlowe made brussel sprouts edible.  I highly recommend this appetizer.\n\nThe only dish that fell short for me was the roasted bone marrow.  I know, I know...sacrilegious to say that since the bone marrow seems universally loved.  I just thought it was 99% bone, 1% marrow, and 100% eleven dollars.  What little I got was delicious, but the flavor comes more from the salsa verde on the side.  \n\nOkay, back to the Marlowe burger (sorry, no pics, my camera ran out of batteries).  It's the kind of burger that will make you close your eyes at the first bite.  The grilled burger patty is infused with lamb meat for the earthy and bold taste, and with that, you can hardly go wrong with horseradish aioli, bacon, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions.  To wit, Marlowe first masters the basics with ground beef packed perfectly, grilled to perfection, and tender, juicy, moist, then they innovate things.  Best in SF in my book?  I don't know yet, but I seem to leaning that way.\n\nMy criticisms about Marlowe, save a few, have nothing to do with the food.  It's a small and very popular place, which means you're eating in close proximity to others, plus it can get pretty loud.  The lady next to me kept looking at us and made me feel like she was listening in on our conversation (can't blame her since our conversation was more interesting than hers)...plus she had this judgmental look because I was taking pictures of my food.  Lucky for us, I couldn't care less.  Also, what's with the \"bread served upon request\" as a fine print on the corner of the menu?   Can you just serve the bread without having to be asked?\n\nThese are qualms that do not warrant a downgrade in my rating, but factors to consider nonetheless.  Other than that, service was nothing short of excellent.  Our server was attentive but not intrusive.  I can see why Christine C. has about two million check ins here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "Marlowe sounds like the name of a retro-40's era fern bar with Bogie flipping a coin waiting for his baby to whistle. OK, I mixed up my Warner Bros classics, but it doesn't matter since it turns out to be the name of owner Anna Weinberg's great-grandfather's butcher shop in Boston. The decor is classic SoMa - dark lighting amid industrial chic touches and uncommonly small for its across-the-tracks warehouse office building setting. It's a loudish, California-style bistro with one long communal table and a few smaller ones surrounding it. Space is definitely at a premium here. \n\nI was immediately drawn to the 3 B's on the menu - the burger, the bone marrow and the Brussels sprout chips. Yes, the $6 Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips are an intriguing starter doused with Meyer lemon and sea salt (see photo). Even if the flavor was somewhat negligible, I liked the lightly crisp texture even if the oil residue on the butcher paper was rather concerning. Next up was the $11 Roasted Bone Marrow with Salsa Verde and Fine Herbs, an acquired taste I agree, but that's what I always try to suck up when I get a good lamb shank.\n\nTwo big bone cavities filled with greasy goodness were served in a scorching hot cast-iron tray and accompanied with toasted, buttered wedges and a minced salsa (see photo). Liked it even if it did taste like I was eating gristle. The $13 Marlowe Burger was the clincher though. It's a well-executed burger with a taste of lamb on a toasted Acme bun slathered with a horseradish aioli. Melted cheddar, shredded lettuce and a couple of thick-cut bacon strips complete the mix (see photo).\n\nThe bun was a little burnt on the edges, but the quality of the meat definitely puts this one a cut above similarly priced burgers. It came with steaming hot fries with more aioli for dipping. We were bummed that they were out of the Upside Down Pear Crisp, so we decided to end the meal with the TCHO Chocolate Cream Pie in a Jar, a sweet-mousse concoction sprinkled with cocoa nibs (see photo). The place was crowding up as we ate, but it never got too overwhelming. Now that I've done the burger, I can graduate to the adult food next time.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good urban burger worth a bite and some interesting appetizers to start\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...dark and compact but space is well thought out considering \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...officious \nTOTAL - 4 stars...will need to try something beyond the burger to get my Marlowe mojo up a notch", "author": "Ed U."}

That's normal right?? We had the brussels sprouts chips and the chocolate pie dessert in the mason jar. Both were good. I'm not dying to go back but they had other appealing things on the menu so I may go back.\n\nThe brussels were flaky and crispy.  The tcho chocolate pie was so so so so sweeeeet!!!

(sorry, I just had to do it!)\n\nMarlowe has that great neighborhood restaurant feel and almost has the right ambiance for a date place. Except it gets too loud in here. \n\nDon't miss the daily specials written on a long butcher paper hanging on the wall. We tried the their bite-sized duck liver crostini with grapes and it was fabulous!\n\nSince everyone and their mama has been talking about the burger, ordering was an easy choice for me.  I requested mine sans bacon (I know, who does that?!?) I wanted to be able to fully taste the flavor of the beef/lamp patty without the enhancement of the bacon. Also, you'll probably kill me for this but knowing that this wasn't grass fed beef I'm eating, I ordered my burger medium well. It was cooked as I requested and even at this state my burger wasn't dry. The Acme bun however was too soft for me because I'm used to the toasted bun version. But the horseradish aioli and caramelized onion combination works. While I thought this was a good burger, my praise goes to the french fries. It was perfection. Thin, crispy and well salted with just the right sprinkling of herbs, it's definitely on my top ten list.\n\nOther fantastic dishes include the wild mushroom polenta, roasted bone marrow and ribeye. The TCHO chocolate pot de creme should be your only choice for dessert, especially if you're into the chocolate/sea salt combination.\n\nService was middle of the road but the kitchen did a great job of pacing the dishes.

I also got the burger, which was very good, but nothing super special.  Maybe a little salty?  The truffle fries were very good.  Oh, and we split the 3 desserts.  The chocolate, vanilla, and apple crisp pots were all very good.  Out of the three, I surprisingly liked the apple crisp the best, which is strange for me since I always gravitate towards chocolate or vanilla desserts.\n\nAll in all, a very good place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "REAL RATING: 3.5 stars\n\nMy girlfriend and I went to Marlowe for the first time this past Saturday for our anniversary. No, we never dined at their old location. Yes, I was a little skeptical seeing the dip in approval after Marlowe relocated. However, we still had to go. \n\nSERVICE: Excellent. No complaints at all. A+ in this department. \n\nCRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS ~ 3 stars: Yeah, these were good. But there's no way to justify a $9-bowl of brussels sprout leaves. And I'm talking about a small bowl. Maybe the size of a medium coffee cup. I wouldn't get these again. \n\nMUSHROOM SOUP ~ 5 stars: This might have been the best thing we had all night. Seasoning was on-point. The texture was creamy but not too heavy, it did a great job coating your tongue and giving you a cozy feeling. This soup was excellent all the way around. I can't think of one thing that could have made it better... maybe a little bit of bacon. ;) \n\nSTEAK TARTARE ~ 4 stars: Often times places will either over or under season their tartare. But not Marlowe. Just enough mustardy flavor mixed with a little bit of zest. The quail egg really mellows everything out and gives it a velvety texture. \n\nMARLOWE BURGER ~ 3 stars: A bit disappointing. So many people crowned this the best burger in SF. However, I didn't think it was anything special. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was good. The burger held up well. But it doesn't deserve the title as the best. Honestly, the burger I had at The Corner Store for brunch the next day was light years better than Marlowe's. \n\nGRILLED NIMAN PORK CHOP ~ 4 stars: No joke, this was probably the most perfectly cooked pork chop I've ever had. It was moist, tender, melted in our mouths. However, it was pretty under seasoned. Shame on Marlowe for allowing this to happen. It was just a couple pinches of salt away from being complete nirvana. But I'll still give it 4 stars for the masterful job they did on grilling and cooking it. \n\nMEYER LEMON CREME BRULEE ~ 3.5 stars: It totally tastes like meyer lemons. The curd is creamy and silky. I'm not a fan of desserts so don't take my 3.5-star rating too seriously. I could have done without it. Oh! I have to give mad props to Marlowe for comping us dessert. They knew it was our anniversary so it was their gift to us. Nice little touch! \n\nOne thing that really struck me about Marlowe was how inexpensive their menu items are. I was a bit shocked that we only ran up a $105 tab. Ok fine, make it like $113 if you count the comped dessert. However, for two apps, one soup, two entrees and one dessert, $113 pre-tip isn't bad at all. That made me feel a little better about the somewhat disappointing meal. I'm not saying Marlowe is cheap by any standards and I don't want to sound like I wipe my @ss with $100 bills but for what Marlowe is, their prices are very reasonable.", "author": "Bruce C."}

She even went the extra mile when she didn't mind taking all the pictures we wanted of our group of six and brought out the cupcakes for dessert, brought by the maid of honor. I must mention that she packed the leftover cupcakes with great care, which I really appreciate. \n\nMy only qualm was that seating is terribly limited. Luckily, all of us girls didn't mind being pretty close to each other, but the same couldn't be said of everyone else. Other groups were elbowing our faces, and it felt really cramped. We also had a hard time hearing each other, as the restaurant is very loud. \n\nThe verdict: Good to try at least once, good for groups, but the space issue should be addressed.

It had been raining all day, so the restaurant was still buzzing but relatively quiet, and it was especially surprising that the  servers would be so sloppy in their service.  Unfortunately, this dinner was a disappointment at every turn.  \n\nWe started with a round of drinks and appetizers, but had to wait until well past 9 pm for our entrees to arrive.  By this point, we had already finished a second round of drinks and were starving and eager to be fed.  We were seated at the end of a long table by the bar.  To our immediate left, the couple working on dessert when we first sat down had already left and their seats were quickly replaced by a second couple who were already digging into their entrees.  Further down the table, a group of young women celebrating a birthday had arrived some time between our two rounds of drinks, and they were already done taking pictures of their food and were finishing up their entrees.  \n\nOur confused server finally ran over close to 9:20 pm to announce that the kitchen had not forgotten about us and that the entrees should be out shortly but he \"could not promise\".  When the food finally came, we were already too tired and hungry to appreciate the entrees or to carry on with our conversations.  We didn't even have energy to eat because it was already close to 10 pm by the time the food arrived.   \n\nThe ma\u00eetre d'or lady who looked like an owner stopped by to tell us that dessert would be on the house, so we mustered our energy to order a few cakes and cookies with our server.  Thankfully the desserts arrived without too long of a wait.  Nevertheless, to make matters worse, instead of seizing this opportunity to make up for his poor service, our server completely forgot to hand us the pork chops we had asked to be packed.  \n\nAll in all, Marlowe was a huge disappointment.  We could have probably felt better had the service improved after the initial lapses, but the service only got worse as our sloppy server became increasingly absent minded.

They are all above average, and the mood of the place is dreamy and nice. Sometime's I get great waiters, but I've also had the worst waiters here. It's a high-end place I'd imagine is good for dates but honestly we were eager to find another place to go regularly.

I was sure that I heard about this place many times on Yelp but never knew anything about the food they had to offer.  Simplistic short menu with lots of seemingly local ingredients.  \n\nThe interior vibe of this place screams casual and warm.  Brown and dark wood with lots of space in between tables from what I remember.  We chose to sit more immediately at the bar where we could see the kitchen and converse with the bartender about what to order.  I ate lightly and got a sweet corn soup and my friend had ordered a classic burger which really looked quite delicious.  I believe I ordered something else but can't quite remember what it was now, haha.  Should have taken a photo of it.  \n\nAnyways, I really would come back to this place because I believe I could quite possibly give this place 5 stars.

This was my third visit, and my first at their new 4th & Brannan location. Marlowe combines a beautifully cozy atmosphere with earnest, tasteful New American food. The ingredients are fresh, the preparation is neat and consistent, and the service is absolutely spectacular.\n\n- I love love love the Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips ($9) here. Many places serve up roasted brussels sprouts, but the Marlowe chip-style preparation has a perfect punch of sour-and-sweet flavor, crisped but not burnt. \n\n- Roasted Bone Marrow ($14) is fatty and succulent, although the portion size is a bit smaller than most restaurants. \n\n- I wasn't too hungry this time around, so I got the Steak Tartare ($16) as my entree. The seasoning is on point and keeps the raw meat tasting fresh. I'm not sure if this is normal, but I feel like most other steak tartare is too heavy in a caper/acidic flavor, and I lose the subtle meat flavor.\n\nI've had the famous Marlowe burger ($16), which is indeed one of my favorites in SF. My friend ordered the Poulet Vert ($26), which is chicken marinated for 24 hours on a bed of mashed potatoes. The chicken is herby and the tender texture blends well with the potatoes.\n\nThe new location is bright and the design alludes to a home kitchen. You should make a reservation unless you plan to come right when it opens, as it does fill up quite quickly. Marlowe can be a bit pricey for dinner, but it is absolutely worth it.

So, I was excited when Marlowe expanded to a bigger location. I'm disappointed that owners decided to pack the tables at this new place to the gill. Packed like sardines... just like in the old location... except the food was not as good.\n\nEverything was way too salty. I mean, you could see the salt snow on top of some of the dishes. A lot of the dishes were also way too vinegary. I just feel like the chef got way too heavy handed with everything. Too spicy, too salty and too vinegary. I'm Korean. I like strong/bold flavors, but there was no balance in the flavors of numerous dishes we tried.\n\nOh, and the interior designer who remodeled this place should be fired. White tile floor and white tile wall? Seriously? I felt like I was in an insane asylum. Oh, it's also a bit dangerous. I stepped on a fried brussels sprout leaf on the floor and slipped a bit. If I had high heels on, I might have fallen. \n\nWe arrived at 5:45 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Why did they seat us at the back corner table that was right next to the kitchen so that we were forced to stare at the blank white tile wall, stainless steel door to the kitchen and constant traffic of wait staff going in and out? When we asked to change the table, the server's answer was \"I am not sure if you can do that. Let me check.\" I saw at least 10 other empty tables. Is it because we look young that they decided to shove us in the worst table? \n\nIt's not just the decor that was unpleasant but the harsh tile surface and marble table made the restaurant incredibly noisy. With the terrible acoustics, sitting elbow to elbow with fellow diners and the food tasting mediocre at best, I will not be returning to this restaurant. So long Marlowe... I used to be a fan but I am ready to move on.\n\nCocktail was yummy.... so I may consider stopping in for a drink, if my friends insisted on this place.

You must order the tomato salad -- it was as if the tomatoes had been picked at the prime of Summer -- here we are in October -- the juices of the tomatoes, mixed with the garlicky croutons and the creamy unctuous burratta was quite an experience.  Kudos to the server for her recommendations and the excellent pacing.  We had asked her to pace our starters; and they arrived in perfect order. \n\nThe main courses of the black cod and always perfect pork chop were greatly enjoyed as well.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the pumpkin squash accompaniment to the pork chop :o)  -- a very minor quibble as all were cooked perfectly and all plates were perfectly polished off!\n\nThe desserts and the cocktails are where the new Marlowe truly shines -- for desserts, the chocolate cake with coconut frosting, the vacherin (meringue with coffee ice cream, chocolate sauce and almonds) and the lemon creme brulee with toasty pistachio biscotti were perfect!!  Creamy, homey, yummy-ness that is an upgrade from the previous desserts in a jar concept -- you will love them!!!   Additionally, the cocktails were a perfect complement to the entire meal -- as it felt too hot to have red wine.  We chose a couple rounds of the refreshing Pimm's Cup and the Calf -- and they worked for the entire meal.\n\nOverall, an amazing experience.

I assume the waiter heard us incorrectly because it was soooooo loud in there. They accommodated us by giving us free chips. When that finally came out and I tried it, IT WAS SO SALTY. Literally, it was like biting into a block of salt. Oh, the burger was good. But, thats all it was. It was just good. Would I consider it the \"best burger in SF\"? Probably not. \n\nIt wasn't best experience, but it also wasn't the worst. Would I wait over an hour for their burger again? No. Maybe if I had reservations. But, the restaurant is still out of the way for me, so I don't see myself going back soon. It is worth trying though. Maybe the kitchen was backed up on the day I went.", "author": "Jennalyn L."}

Ten minutes isn't a very big deal to us, so we were super surprised when they gave us complimentary brussel sprout chips for making us wait! We both thought that was super nice of them. Our waitress was also helpful when we were trying to figure out what wine to order. She suggested two red wines and let us sample both before choosing! We hadn't even gotten to the food yet and were loving this place so far. And now onto the food!\n\nBrussel Sprout Chips - I HATE brussel sprouts and try to avoid eating them, but these were actually bearable! The flavors, salty and citrusy, and the crispy texture made these edible and addicting. Although it was cool to try these, I probably wouldn't get them again just because I still don't like brussel sprouts. \n\nBone Marrow - This was my first time eating bone marrow so I didn't know what to expect. It was very tasty! There isn't a lot of meat though so I'm not sure I would order it again since it was $12. The bread and the salsa verde on the side were also yummy!\n\nBaked Oysters - OMG YUM. This was SO GOOD. We each had one of these and they were sooo tasty! They had so much flavor from the creamy, new england chowder sauce and the oysters had the perfect texture. I highly recommend ordering these! \n\nScallops - BOOO only four scallops and cost $27?! No thanks. Definitely don't know what made us order these... the scallops were cooked perfectly but the overall dish was too small and the flavors didn't make up for that. \n\nMarlowe Burger - DELISH. How did they make a burger that sounded so normal, SO GOOD?! It was seriously heavenly and I even closed my eyes as I took my bites. The patty was juicy and cooked perfectly. The flavors of the cheese, onions, and bacon went so well together with the burger and the bun was soft and toasty! Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. I totally wished I ordered one instead of the scallops. Luckily my bf was willing to share his burger :D\n\nThe restaurant's small size and dim lighting makes it a bit more intimate, definitely better for smaller groups. Marlowe is a great place to take a date out for dinner or to celebrate with a small group of friends :)", "author": "Sandra N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-05", "description": "The Good:\n-Went in on a Friday night that was pretty busy, did not have a reservation, the host managed to get us a table very quickly. He was awesome.\n-The deviled egg from the \"bite\" menu was a nice mini appetizer (it's literally one bite). Lots of flavor and something I had not tried before elsewhere. I would recommend it if I were to suggest you go there... but I don't.\n\nThe Bad:\n-I saw an article listing the burger as one of the best in SF, so I had to give it a shot. Irrespective of price, I'd give it a 5/10 (my only modification was asking for no lettuce). As far as I could tell, toppings included a bit of hard (not crispy, actually hard) bacon, cheddar cheese, and a good amount of mayo or aioli. The bun was good, the beef itself was cooked appropriately, but overall the taste was on the bland side--far from what a best burger in SF should be. The fries that came with it were skinny, too salty, and reminded me of a slightly thicker version of In n Out's. Take price into consideration ($16) and the burger drops to a 2/10 at best. Almost feels as if the price justification is only due to it being the cheapest main dish option on the menu.\n\nThe Worst:\nMy friends all got cocktails. I wasn't drinking that night, so I ordered a coke. I can only assume  my glass was filled with a coke tap from the bar, because it tasted like generic brand or a watered down version. I wouldn't have thought much about it... but then the bill came: $4 for this. Never was even offered a refill. I was shocked. Even nicer places that bring you a glass of ice and a tall glass coke bottle charge at most $3 for this. Even the Deviled Egg was priced lower than that. This just pushed me over the edge; I went from being \"meh\" about this place to deciding to never go back.\n\n\nI'm willing to pay SF prices for an overall good experience--high quality food and service. I'm not willing to accept insane prices for mediocre food (at best) just because SF is expensive. If you want a $15+ burger that's worth it... go to Nob Hill Grille and get the Old McDonald.", "author": "Max Z."}

Just the right balance of flavor. \n\nBanana walnut cake with ice cream - This was so so so so good, I can die and go to heaven now. The cake was super duper moist and with the ice cream... I can say no more. Just a head's up, the cake is huge. We were thinking it was going to be a smaller portion, so we ordered another dessert.

We were very confused and had no idea that they had moved so we actually walked to their original location first but thankfully there was a sign posted there directing us to their new location, which was just a short walk away. \n\nImmediately, you notice a different feel to the new location. The walls are tiled and white, allowing all the sound in the room to bounce off from all sides. The noise levels were VERY high... I don't recall them having this issue at their other spot. I didn't mind the new set up but it is quite a tight fit, especially where we were sat at the tables that lined behind the bar. You literally have to be a size 2 to squeeze between the marble tables that they have jammed together. I do miss the slit they had previously that allowed you to see in to the kitchen. I love an open kitchen.. \n\nAnyway, on to the food! I wasn't starving but I did want to try a little bit of this and that. We ordered the brussel sprout chips, the roasted bone marrow, and the chicken fried okra. My sister and boyfriend both got an order of the Marlowe Burger. First of all, they are FAMOUS for their brussel sprout chips and you clearly see why. They are ridiculously addicting, and a really great alternative to a typical potato chip! I can't name the zest they put on the chips, but OH MY GOD. Mind blowing! The bone marrow is an absolute favorite of mine, and it is in fact the sole reason why I return to this restaurant. I timidly asked the waitress to make sure the kitchen didn't overcook the marrow because embarrassingly enough last time I was there I ordered it TWICE (not joking) and the second time it was cooked so thoroughly that there was barely any marrow left. Cue the tears.. This time however it was perfection. It is the definition of mother's milk to me! Served with light greens and crustini. The chicken fried okra was good, but I think I may have actually preferred it straight grilled (maybe wrapped in bacon?) rather than deep fried and battered as it was. \n\nWould I come back? Yes... maybe on a less busy night, so the noise levels will lessen. Perhaps some sound reducers may help but I don't know. It's a great establishment and the bone marrow will always keep me coming back.\n\nWhat I recommend: Brussel sprout chips and bone marrow FTW!", "author": "Mariko M."}

This was my first lunch at Marlowe, and the first time I've been back since my initial dinner there two years ago. I made reservations a couple weeks out for a Monday, and thank goodness I did because the restaurant was packed at noon, and there would've been a long wait. We ordered:\n\n-Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips (Lemon & Sea Salt, $7, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ#afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ): Most inventive and delicious dish in a long time! I remember the first time I had these at Marlowe, and was blown away by how crispy and crunchy each brussel sprout leaf was, and how they added the perfect amount of salt and lemon. A must order!\n-Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich (Caesar Aioli, Bacon, Field Greens, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ#8rPGdkGThFcjjNFnCrdrZA): Although this is on the 2012 7x7 Big Eat list, the sandwich was really disappointing! The chicken piece was moist, but the dish overall was very dry. They needed more aioli, or a slaw for the sandwich. I wouldn't order this dish again.\n-Marlowe Burger (Caramelized Onions, Cheddar, Bacon, Horseradish Aioli, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ#wyO-MFmJZbHzcx-jAX1Ksg): I've had this burger before, and didn't remember it, so I decided to re-order since this is one of the dishes they're known for. It was a solid burger, but I wasn't amazed.  It was on the small side, and although the beef flavor was good, it again wasn't memorable.\n-Sauteed Blue Sole Po' Boy (Spicy Remoulade, Shredded Lettuce, Heirloom Tomato, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ#ZWkWu4k9icoE5m1xyQVK8Q): Skip! I didn't like this sandwich at all. It also needed more remoulade since it was dry, and the overall flavors were boring. \n-Upside Down Strawberry Crisp (Bourbon Ice Cream, Brown Butter Caramel Sauce, $7, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=afE-TQOh-LCH1rXK7oboQQ#jgIcBV_49Q8SEPByU7T6HA): Pretty good! The bourbon ice cream was really good, and I liked the strawberry crisp. However, I wasn't a fan of the glass they serve it in- although it looks cute, it gets hard to eat, especially when you're sharing and get towards the bottom.\n\nOverall, there were some successful and not so successful dishes at Marlowe. Our server was attentive at first, but got busy later on and didn't check back at our table much. We had to flag her down to order dessert and grab the check. Also, since there was a large party that day, the kitchen was slow to come out with our dishes and it took an hour and a half to finish lunch.

We work nearby so stopped by about 12:30 yesterday but wait was a while so we made reservation for today - recommended for lunch visits from opening until about 1:30 when some tables were open. Otherwise seems quite busy with the suit crowd - or what passes for a suit nowadays !  We started with Brussel sprout chips with lemon and sea salt. They were light and airy despite leaving oil on our fingers, but not really something to fill you up. At just under $10 a nice try, but would skip them next time. Entrees were a cheeseburger and the open faced egg salad sandwich with pickled jalape\u00f1o and provolone cheese (also comes with two strips of bacon but I went vegetarian ...). Side of fries with garlic aioli dip rather than salad (salads I saw coming in were just green piles of - well, salad!)  was perfect! Shared (but could've eaten all by myself!) a cauliflower and cheese casserole. The sandwich was very good, on a light bread with mildly warm jalape\u00f1os - not too hot. The deviled egg was deliciously seasoned. The provolone was also a good pairing. The cheeseburger was on a nice bun (looked like an egg glaze?) with lots of condiments and was cooked perfectly to medium rare. Cauliflower is not a favorite of mine, but I'll eat this dish anytime. Well seasoned cauliflower with cheeses melted on top - the cheese was darkened (not my style) but didn't detract from overall taste in this dish. Both white and orange cauliflower was used for a nice visual variety. The drinks (water and iced tea) were kept filled by attentive staff, dishes cleared promptly. Noise level was very loud - not sure why, but it is a smaller dining area with tables close to each other (and some searing at the counter as well). Overall a great meal and nice experience. Would bring someone here as a guest to make a nice impression if business related - I think that's what many were there for judging by the conversations I heard around me, but a family with very young children (8 and under) also sat next to us at one point and the kids enjoyed their meals as well, so it seems a nice family option, too.", "author": "Mark K."}

Glass of water and the brussell sprout chips.\n\nFOOD: \nI devoured the burger with its sexy caramilized onions, cheddar cheese, and bacon.  I mildly enjoyed the crispy fried chicken sandwhich and poulet vert.  Why mildy? The chicken was crispy, but something was off on the flavor. The Poulet was better, but fattier.  Keep in mind the poulet takes 20 minutes from oven to table-not listed on the menu. \n\nThe beauty of the small menu is having the option to try everything once.  I read the descriptions and want this, that, and the other...\n\nOn my most recent visist, I ordered the TCHO chocolate cream pie. \nMy goodness was that delicious.  So delicious, I kept licking my fingers to reach the left over graham cracker crust.\n\nIf you are on a diet, you may want to search for alternates. The food doesn't skimp on the richness or the taste. I suggest you share dishes and pair them with glasses of wine.\n\nProps for being close to the ballpark, but that means parking can get tricky on day games. Reservations are a must, even for lunch. If you are loading coins in to the parking meter, expect a 2 hour visit at this establishment. Good food is slow food when the living's easy....", "author": "Flor D."}

I had just moved to SF and a few of my neighbors raved about this being their favorite spot in all of SF.\n\nI should note that I moved here from South Carolina. We do happen to have FANTASTIC food but I was expecting Marlowe to wow my taste buds with the way everyone was bragging on it. \n\nThankfully I didn't get the hamburger because I probably would have given it 1 Star knowing how amazing my hamburger eating life has been.\n\nI got the Poulet Vert which was pretty good. The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly and matched nicely with the veggies included. I felt like even though I'm not a master chef, that I could make something just as good at home. I'm a pretty good cook but I go out to eat in hopes of having BETTER than what I can do on my own. I'd say it's a safe choice if some of the other options on the menu are a little out of your comfort zone. It's pretty much like getting a Rotisserie Chicken at Whole Foods- it's just harder to cut and doesn't fall off the bone as easily. \n\nAll of the desserts the table got were terrible. I don't even remember what exactly they were intended to be. They ranged from cobblers, to pies, to mini cake like things all in short mason jars. It was basically like eating ice cream with crumbles and fruit topping. Go to Humphrey Slocombe if you want something that looks \"meh\" but tastes out of this world. These desserts just looked \"meh\" and tasted like super sweet ice cream with random crunchy textures. \n\nWhenever my boyfriend and I leave a restaurant we say: would we go there again? This was a unanimous vote in that we wouldn't. It wasn't a gross or bad meal. It just not worth the time to make another reservation when we've had better.", "author": "Karen A."}

There were 3 of us, and we had to share a table with another party of 3, which was a little awkward because we could hear their entire conversation.\n\nI felt like the atmosphere was a little too fancy for me. It's the kind of place where hip professionals or hipster artists would come to be fancy. Our server looked like hipster barrister. The prices were also pretty fancy, averaging $18 per plate, I'd say.\n\nWe shared everything we ordered. We got the brussel sprout chips, which were really yummy initially, but felt too salty and oily after a while. We then shared the Tuna Conserva & Prosciutto di Parma, Anson Mills Polenta, and Marlowe Burger. It all filled us up quite well, but I think some of dishes were more filling than others. The polenta was very tasty initially, but then started to feel really heavy. I really enjoyed the tuna salad, but it was kind of tough to eat all together. I felt like I had to eat each piece of the salad one at a time. Also, they sprinkled red pepper flakes over it, so I got one bite that was extremely spicy, but the dish overall was not spicy at all. The burger was yummy, but also pretty standard. \n\nOverall, I don't think I'd come back again.", "author": "Jamie C."}

To our surprise, the party of the same size originally behind us in line had already been seated while we were told our table was still not ready. After waiting another 20 minutes (35 in total), we were finally seated and given the Deviled Egg appetizer as a thank you/apology for waiting. \n\nThe eggs were definitely savory and filling, but a bit too small to command their price if I were to order them again next time. The Marlowe burger dripped with juice and comes out cooked exactly to your liking, but it's pretty standard for what you would expect from any premium burger joint. The fries and horseradish aioli -- these alone made our party forget about the wait. Fries were fried to the perfect amount of crispy, aioli had just enough horseradish to get the taste without the sting. Definitely worth ordering again.\n\nService: 3.5/5\nFood: 4.5/5", "author": "Cliff H."}

The flavor combination of the pickled jalape\u00f1os, bacon, and egg is just the right amount of spicy and salty. \n\nBone marrow: I think this might have been my favorite part of the meal. It had the best flavor of any marrow I've ever had.\n\nPoulet vert: I got the chicken and it was a fantastic decision. The flavor went all the way through the meat and the outside edges were crisp. The parsnips served with it were almost glazed on the outside and complimented the taste of the chicken wonderfully \n\nPork chop: my boyfriend got this and I was amazed not only by the taste but by the size of the meal itself.

But no, that wouldn't be right... right? I took a spoonful onto my plate and passed it on. Good thing I didn't taste it before passing it on because I would have stabbed someone in the neck if they had tried to take it away from me after that first blessed taste. \n\nNo worries, there were more Brussels sprouts to come, this version had them sliced in half and sauteed in brown butter. I normally don't like veggies made in butter because believe it or not, it gives me a stomach ache, but these were tasty. That could be because I only ate a couple. They are good, but I'd order doubles of the chips. Trust me on that one as regular sauteed Brussels sprouts are not that hard to make (not dissing Marlowe's, because I sure as hell could *not* approximate anything the geniuses in the kitchen make here). Any restaurant that has not one but two dishes featuring these little spheres of delight is AOK in my book.\n\nMore on the preamble front: \n-the Burrata is bliss on the lips\n-fries with aioli -- when can you ever go wrong with fries? Still, if you're deciding on just a couple apps, go for the rock stars on the menu as mentioned above, instead. \n\nAnd then the main course: polenta. See, I've been a grits addict since I was a child. Grits, polenta, however it's called. While my boyfriend makes the best grits/polenta on the planet, Marlowe's is a *very* close second. It's the only straight up vegetarian entree on the menu (you can get it made vegan. I, for one, left the egg off). Do not skip this dish, even if the meaty stuff is catching your eye, trust me. I say this because the meat eaters at the table were all over it when sampled. Creamy polenta, greens, mushrooms, shaved parm... seriously, I die just thinking about it. I'm about to whip up a bowl of grits and then cry into them because they will never be as good as Marlowe's. \n\nSo, Chef Jennifer Puccio, I *kiss your grits*! (those born after 1983 will probably not get this reference). \n\nIf this review were just about the food, it would be 5 stars without hesitation. My \"issue\" if there is one, is with the atmosphere. I don't mean aesthetically, as it gives off a dark and inviting kind of vibe... if it were empty. Despite the fact that it's a small room, it's not an intimate space. It's incredibly loud, and you will shout at the person sitting next to you. Add to that occasional beams that may crisscross part of the longer tables, blocking off all communication with the person across from you. \n\nAnd ladies, don't wear skirts here unless you wish to give your dining companions a crotch shot (curses to that picnic bench seating).\n\nHowever, that food... it's just that incredible.

Although I had expected Sunday to be on the slow side, the restaurant was brimming with people and vibrant with conversation.\n\nDelicious is the easiest way to describe each and every element of our dinner experience from the first sip of my \"Baker\" cocktail to the last decadent bite of our Gingerbread Cake dessert.  In between, our meal consisted of...\n\n- Brussels sprouts chips: wonderful flavor, but a little clunky to eat, \n- Warm deviled eggs: a near perfect bite!,\n- Di Stefano burata: more salad and less cheese than expected, but it all worked together amazingly well,\n- Grilled calamari and chorizo tartine: also unexpected as it was a bit like an open-faced sandwich.  Not much to look at, but again all came together harmouiously,\n- Marlowe burger: burger itself was quite good, not anything that blew me away, but good. The fries and horseradish aolii are a match made in heaven\n\nI would add that the Baker cocktail ( I had 2!) was easily one of the best drinks I have had in a while - smooth and just the right level of sweetness. I will be trying to replicate this one for a while!\n\nThe only drawback, which others have mentioned is how close the tables are together.

As Zak R wrote -- it's definitely cozy. Rustic feeling. Comfortable, not snobby.\n\nIntriguing wine list, with several available by the glass... I love to try out new things, and Marlowe's list does not disappoint. I enjoyed a glass of a Cab Sauv blend from Bonny Doon (one of my favorite wineries!) as well as a new-to-me grape... or so I thought! Wait, it's a Mourv\u00e8dre in Spanish guise! In any event, it was tasty.\n\nStarted with the brussels sprouts chips, which were -- as basically everyone else has said -- excellent, as in \"waitress-please-don't-take-that-bowl-until-we-are-DONE-WITH-EVERY-CRUMB\" excellent.  \n\nAlso had the deviled egg, which was super good too. A nice little kick to it. I could've eaten several more... \n\nBut then, I wouldn't have had dinner! I had the polenta, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was sated, not stuffed. My friend enjoyed her meal as well. \n\nDO NOT MISS DESSERT. I had the TCHO chocolate \"pie,\" which actually comes in a little Mason jar. It's not terribly huge, but it's a decent portion, enough to leave you wanting more. My friend had the crisp, and she thought it was awesome.\n\nThe one thing I found odd? In this city -- nay, this region -- of awesome coffee purveyors, they serve Stumptown, from Oregon. Don't get me wrong; I LOVE Stumptown (the Hair Blender blend is awesome), and Marlowe made me a really nice macchiato. But when you have so many roasters to choose from in the surrounding area... why go with Stumptown? A fairly minor quibble in an overall fantastic experience. \n\nThe tea comes from local favorites, Republic of Tea.\n\nAnother great thing about Marlowe: It is very close to Caltrain, which is awesome if you're commuting, but not-so-awesome on Giants game days, because it's super busy. \n\nMake reservations.", "author": "Tami S."}

My fiance originally booked a large party of 8 for a Saturday night for my bachelorette. Unfortunately, one of my friends was unable to drive up from the peninsula because she was ill. Due to this, the 4 girls she was car pooling with lost their ride when she wasn't able to make it. Thus, our party dwindled from 8 people to 3 people. We felt really bad about this, and called Marlowe as soon as we found out. They informed us that if we were to cancel, we would be charged 20$ a person, leaving me to need to pay $160 because we couldn't all make it. They were nice and said if we 3 came, they would wave the charge. Reluctantly, after already eating dinner, we went to Marlowe to avoid the $150 charge.\n\nWe got there and were sat within a few minutes. Again,we apologized for the change of plans. One of my friends is a waitress, and understood that they probably were frustrated. Anyway, we order our food, and because we are already full from dinner #1, we ordered an appetizer, and 2 entrees to split between 3 girls. The waitress was noticeably irritated when one of my friends passed on ordering an entree. I understand her frustration, but as any good customer service job, you need to learn to hide it. My friend really awkward after this interaction, but she just couldn't eat anymore.\n\n20 minutes pass....30 minutes.....40 minutes....no one has come to our table at all, or apologize for the wait....50 minutes, and we count 15 other people who sat after us were all served......55 minutes later and finally, after flagging down the waiter our food arrives! Really?? 55 minutes to cook 3 scallops and a medium rare steak. Those in fact should take minutes to cook.\n\nThe two stars is for the food, which was quite good. Even after eating dinner #1 and being stuffed, we managed to eat all of our entrees. However, the frustration of the events had put a bad taste in our mouth.\n\nMy waitress friend was pretty pissed at this point, because she knows that 55 minutes is pretty unacceptable (especially without a single update). She also saw the waiter talking to one of the managers and pointing at us. She was thinking that as a courtesy, something would be taken care of, or offered to us....but no such thing. Not even an apology. I get it--we were a party of 8 that went to 3, its pretty crappy for them to lose (sort of) that business. This was unforeseeable and not any ones fault, but it was hard for us not to feel that the 55 minute wait was done to punish us. \n\nWe missed our train, thus our plans had to change.

It's my 2nd time at Marlowe and heard they relocated so I wanted to check it out. I definitely miss the smaller intimate feel of the prior location. They also took off clams from the menu :(.\nWe ordered the Brussel sprout chips, chicken fried okra, Marlowe burger, and smoked black cod. The appetizers are great but the portions are tiny. I think the chips came in an even smaller bowl than my 1st visit. The okra was battered and fried...you can't go wrong there but it was a little on the heavy side. The burger was mehhh...but fries were yummy! It came with a lemon aioli which gave it a little twist. Black cod was pretty good. All the fixings that it came with just married together. \nIt's a nice date night spot. Made for parties of 2-4. Food is decent. Overall 3.5 stars.", "author": "Linda P."}

(Giants won 5-3)\n\nStarted with the brussels sprout chips and bone marrow. Loved the bone marrow, but the brussels sprout chips had a little too much lemon zest IMO. The first few chips were good, but the flavors got too strong after that.  Would definitely order the bone marrow again. \n\nI ordered the Marlowe burger, thinking that my 2 year old daughter would have some, but who am I kidding. She's a rice bucket. She loves carbs. And she has never asked for a burger. Plus, as soon as my plate comes, she's going for the fries...forget about feeding her a nutritious meal. \n\n5 minutes before my burger comes out, the waiter brings me ketchup. \n\nMy daughter: What's dat!? Dat ketchup!? Dat for me!? \n\nYup, she had fries for dinner that night.  While she enjoyed my fries, I enjoyed my burger - flavorful and juicy. \n\nMy husband ordered the pork chop. It's actually a pretty big portion and can get heavy, especially with the risotto. He enjoyed it. \n\nOverall a good meal. Nice way to end a awesome day out on the other side of town.

We never told her that we were going to share but some how she knew and when the plates came, everything was cut in half and on separate plates. It was really nice.\n\nThe thoughtfulness even comes thru in the burger. The bacon was cut into pieces so it's easier to eat. The burger was the highlight of the evening.

No one \"pissed me off,\" my reservation was not screwed up, I did not have to wait and my waiter was not unfriendly. Now that this is out of the way, either I do not know good food or a lot of reviewers of this restaurant are delusional.\n\nI had the Marlowe burger, fried okra and Brussels sprout chips. Let us take them in order: (1) Folks, you can get better superior hamburger at In-N-Out Burger or Shake Shack for one-third the price; (2) the fried okra was good but not spectacular and lacked seasoning; and (3) the crispy Brussels sprout chips were like separating a Brussels sprout, dipping each portion in olive oil and seasoning and then placing it on a George Foreman Grill for about three minutes.  \n\nThis is a nice bright restaurant with friendly service and slightly above average food. I am sorry but there is simply nothing spectacular about the hamburger and the idea that this place is being compared to Four-star restaurants in San Francisco is just plain silly.", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

I was a tiny bit disappointed with the burger because I was expecting the best burger in SF, but nonetheless I was satisfied. The fries that came with the burger were also VERY salty. \n\n- Pork chops: probably the BEST pork chops I've ever had. The server pretty much swore by it so we thought we'd give it a try & we were definitely happy. The pork was tender & juicy, not dry at all. The only bad thing was that it was ALSO kinda salty. I love salt & sometimes probably over salt the food I cook, but Marlowe just seems to go on a salt overload! \n\nDessert \n\n- Panna cotta: nothing special, a little bit too tarty. \n\nOverall, had a great experience. \nHopefully, they'll ease up on that salt shaker next time I come.", "author": "Sylvia N."}

Well our friend's friend's friend took us here.  My first impression of the place was...\n\nWhoah this is pretty fancy and I'm wearing my Nike Women's marathon hoodie, leggings, and rainbow slippers...oh boy!  \n\nOur party of 6 waited a few minutes for our table to open up and by the looks of this place you could tell that good food awaited our tummies.  It's was almost as though this is where the cool kids go for lunch!   The menu was small but to the point, from my experience working in the restaurant industry that either means the chef puts well thought out food on a plate where presentation AND taste are one in the same.  OR they just want to make it easier on you to decide what you want.  To me, this place is definitely the first one. Just by reading the descriptions of the dishes I could tell we were in store for something good, no matter what we ordered.  I wanted to be modest and taste their less expensive dishes....to see if they put just as much care in them as they do in their $26 meals.\n\nI ordered the citrus gem salad (i think that's what it's called) to get my daily dose of veggie on and paired it with french fries.  Oxymoran?  of course, but it was a french fry day too.  Our dishes took awhile to come out, but our attentive waitress filled our waters promptly any time they needed it.  \n\nWhen my salad and fries came out I was eager to eat.  The salad looked small and if I wasn't in a nice restaurant I'd probably chow it down fast, but I'm glad i didn't.  There were so many flavors and textures going on it was a piece of ART! Just how I like my food :)  The freshness was undeniable, the presentation was a beauty, and the taste was citrus-ey but not tart.  LOVE!  The fries were memorable but the pork that our friend had was so moist and delicious I highly recommend it!

He was friendly, made recommendations, and we never had to wait for them to refill our water glasses and they were never overbearing or pretentious.\n\nFood...\n\nWe thought their appetizers, classics & sides on the menu looked much better than their mains.  There was so much stuff on the menu that we wanted to try. We wanted to try Honey Glazed Pork belly from the appetizer section but then the only main that really grabbed us was Grilled Niman Pork chop and while we love pork, we thought, even for us pork lovers, it was a bit much.\n\nSo we settled with our other alternative - twice baked dungeness crab souffle (every single word here was perfectly chosen to get your taste buds up.  twice. baked. dungeness. crab. souffle.)\n\nWaiter recommended that we try their \"must try\" deviled eggs so we got those too.\n\nI love brussels sprouts and they had two options to choose from - TWO brussels sprout dishes!!!  Crispy brussels sprout chips and brown butter brussels sprouts.  We thought the former (crispy version) maybe less healthy (?) for us so chose brown butter brussels sprouts (because brown butter is healthy...not...)\n\nOh and how can we skip steak tartare.  \n\nSo after ordering 5 dishes (crab souffle, brussels sprouts, deviled eggs, steak tartare & niman pork chops) we continued to chit chat away.  \n\nFood came surprisingly quickly.  Restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 6:00 (a whole hour earlier than our original reservation) but before you know it the whole place was packed!  I would never come here without a reservation as they are usually fully booked.  \n\nBy the time our main pork dish came we were pretty much stuffed.  That may have also been the reason why we thought the pork dish was not as good as the other dishes we had.  \n\nAlthough full their dessert menu was too good to pass up. We decided to try \nStrawberry & Rhubarb Crisp.  It was served interestingly in a jar.  It wasn't overly sweet and was a nice finish to our meal.\n\nWould I come back?

We both had THE same conversation with our respective bfs/gfs on THE same night (seriously).\n\nThus, it's no surprise that we're compatible food-wise.  When we decided to meet up and catch up (dating drama again, obv), we mutually decided on Marlowe.  After reading Yelp reviews about their burger, he knew he had to get that.

If you're a fan of these delicious little nuggets of orgasm, you'll love the ones they have at Marlowe.\nSteak tartare: 3 stars.  Not sure what it was about theirs, but I've had much better steak tartare at Cafe Claude.\n\nThe best part about my meal was that it was just enough to leave room for dessert, so of course we had to have some.  Our waitress was kind enough to tell us that the desserts were actually pretty small and served in cute little jars, so I went for the Upside-Down Apple Crisp.  And damn, it's small.  With the unique bourbon ice cream and the brown butter caramel sauce, I could've just eaten a huge pot of this for my meal and called it a day.  Seriously.\n\nOverall a good dining experience.

I made reservations a week prior.  It was a good thing I did because it was so crowded.  \n\nUpon entering this establishment, the hostess asked us if we had reservations.  I told her yes, although we were about thirty minutes early.  We were seated in this snug little area.

The food came out in a good amount of time.  The bone marrow and oysters came out first.  The oysters and bone marrow looked very appetizing.  The bone marrow was quite oily and fatty.  I did not care for it that much, but I am sure the GF loved it.  The oysters had a type of filling which was really good.  It resembled mac and cheese.  \n\nAfter we were done with those, they brought out the polenta and and fries.  The fries were extremely good.  They had a light scent of garlic to them, and they were very crispy.  As for the polenta...wow!  It was absolutely delicious.  The egg yolk gushed out as I slashed it in half.  Yum!  Exactly what you expect from a poached egg.  The plating on the dish was great, and the actual texture of the dish was rich and creamy.  \n\nI definitely loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.

The place has a great vibe, while it's in SOMA it's actually intimate and fun with a warm and neighborhoody feel like it's been there for a while.  The service was friendly and attentive.\n\nWe started with the artichoke chips and crab souffle.  The chips were greasy, salty and not very crispy, so we had a few and pushed the dish away.  A bummer but we were looking forward to the next dish.  When it arrived we were both disappointed that the crab was just sitting on the plate, around the small souffle, it looked dry and just scattered there, I expected that it would be worked into the dish.  The actual souffle was just OK but not great, it tasted more like an omelette, not fluffy and light.\n\nFor the entrees we had the burger, pork belly and little gem salad.  The pork belly was nice, well prepared, lean, great flavor and the salad was a perfect pairing, it cut the richness and gave a nice acidic balance to the dish.  The burger was just OK, it was a bit thin and while my husband asked for it to be medium, it was well done when it arrived, the fries were good.\n\nTo finish off our meal, I hand an espresso and we ordered the strawberry and rhubarb crisp, which when arrived was basically ice cream with some fruit crisp that in the dark honestly looked like granola.  \n\nI'm not sure what happened here, we tried a lot of dishes and were not impressed, half of them just weren't great at all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-28", "description": "After reading all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this place... however, I was kind of disappointed. Place is located near the caltrain station... plenty of street parking... mostly metered. However, it was 25 cents an hour... so it wasn't too bad. Made reservations for 2 around 7pm. Pretty cool date place, but it can get pretty loud and it's pretty dim inside.\n\nSo onto the food... ordered the crispy brussels sprout chips... and wish we ordered another order. It was really good. Had a nice crisp and the lemon juice complimented the chips really well. Got the roasted bone marrow, it was my first time eating bone marrow... so I didn't know what to really expect. I was kind of sad since I'm not sure if it wasn't heated enough but my bone marrow only melted half way... so the other half was still solid and I didn't have enough spread. I was tempted to steal some of my friends spread... but that would be cruel. Oh well! Got the Marlowe Burger and was expecting to be blown away... but I was kind of disappointed because there was a lingering burnt aftertaste. First I thought it was because my bun was over toasted but I looked and it looked fine to me. I looked through each ingredient and couldn't figure out where the burnt taste was... which was driving me crazy. It may have been the caramelized onions... I'm not sure... but it wasn't a pleasant taste... it basically ruined my burger. I had to throw a lot of the aioli sauce to cover the burnt taste... but then my burger just tasted like horseradish aioli. The fries were really good though... had a nice crunch. Extremely good while hot, but it still tasted good and was crunchy even at the end of the meal when it was cold. For dessert, the upside down strawberry crisp looked really good so we shared that. I really liked the ice cream but then I was haunted by the damn burnt taste again... so I'm assuming it was because of the caramel sauce.  Luckily there were some fresh berries that I could eat with it to hide the taste... but then I ran out of berries so I had to stop eating it :(.\n\nOverall, the meal was alright. Service was great and our waitress checked on us multiple times to make sure everything was alright. Maybe next time I'll ask for the caramelized stuff to be excluded or whatever was causing that burnt taste. Not sure if it was an off night or not but the brussel sprout chips are definitely worth coming out for!", "author": "Johnson S."}

Starving.  This place is pretty cool... it's very small and dimly lit... intimate... would be a great date place I think.  We got some BBQ oysters and brussel sprout chips and some cauliflower gratin and a bottle of wine... I don't remember much of everything except that they were all tasty.  I got the burger medium rare.  I liked it a lot.  Very simple and tasty.  Here's what I remember about it and what I can tell from looking at the picture I snapped of it.  \n1. It was more bun than patty.  Patty was small (not just thin, but small).\n2. But it was juicy and flavorful.\n3. No tomato or pickle.  Onions were caramalized.  Just some chopped lettuce.\n4. Melted cheddar cheese.\n5. Bun was slightly toasted.\n6. Two crisp slices of bacon\n7. Had both some kind of aoli and I think mayo?\n\nThe burger was good.  It was a little small.  I'd rather have a bigger patty than bacon strips.  Having both aoli and mayo definitely makes it tasty.  While it was good it's not the reason I'd come back here... I'd probably order something else...  we also got dessert, but by that time I was too far gone to have any idea what it was...\n\nBut overall this place is cool.. hip... trendy...cozy... good service...everything is just done well... a little pricey for what comes down to some pretty simple foods.. but that's to be expected.", "author": "Easter E."}

The way the crunchiness of the chicken crust and bacon complement each other, coupled with the savoriness of the aioli sauce make the ingredients of this chicken sandwich such a perfect combination, it's like discovering proof that the world is round or that the sky is blue.  It's eye-opening.  It's awe-inspiring.  And I can truly say, this is the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.\n\nI know, comparing a chicken sandwich to a burger is like comparing apples and oranges.  But that's just what I did.  I had half a Marlowe burger and half the chicken sandwich, side-by-side.  I ate the burger half first.  And while I stll hold the Marlowe burger as one of the best burgers out there, my mouth was really waiting to get ahold of that chicken sandwich.  And when it did....ahhhhhhhh.  Lunchtime bliss.\n\nFinally...I'm so relieved to get that off my chest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-16", "description": "I was more than intrigued when a little brasserie across from the Caltrain depot caused a stir when it opened in 2010 (top 10 best new restaurant in 2010 and top 100 restaurants in the bay area for 2011). I was even more intrigued when I read the rave reviews about its burger and GASP, bone marrow? \n\nSoft, fatty tissue in the hollow center of an animal leg bone?! \n\nI'M SO THERE.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see that the wine list included carafes.  For the price of 2 glasses, we were able to enjoy about 2.5-3 glasses from a carafe. \n\nWe started off the meal with the brussel sprout chips. I don't know where brussel sprouts got their bad rap. They seem to be universally hated, but here, at Marlowe, they are transformed from bitter mini-cabbages to well, bitter mini-cabbage leaves deep fried and sprinkled with lemon and sea salt.  It's cheating, but I guess anything tastes good deep fried and sprinkled with salt.  My bf couldn't get over the slightly bitter aftertaste of the chips, but I thought they were delicious: salty and citrusy.\n\nNext, the bone marrow. MMMMMM. The soft, rich bone marrow melted easily and tasted almost like butter, with a sweet, nutty flavor and a lighter, more delicate texture. Served on a grilled piece of bread and topped with a tangy, herby salsa verde mixture, it was heart attack heaven. \n\nAt this point, I wasn't sure if I was carafe-wasted or bone marrow-wasted. I also had some of my bf's little gem salad, but I couldn't taste it. It was merely absorbed into my bone marrow-drunken stupor. I was lightheaded and giddy and ready for the main event.\n\nFinally, the infamous Marlowe burger with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli and french fries. HOLY, this was one good burger. Most burgers fall into one big greasy mess where I can't differentiate any of the components. What impressed me the most about the Marlowe burger was its ability to stay perfectly composed and how each of its components were distinctly unique.  The meat patty was juicy, tender, and perfectly medium rare. The caramelized onions were sweet and slightly gooey mixed with the melted cheese. And the bacon was smoky, salty, and a great contrast to the sharpness of the horseradish aioli. \n\nAnd when I thought I had reached the pinnacle of my meal at Marlowe, I had a french fry. Then, all hell broke loose. Seriously, the BEST fries I have had in a very, very long time. Easily, the best fries I have ever had in SF. Double, maybe triple fried, the fries were the perfect crispness on the outside and impossibly soft and airy in the middle.  When I heated up my leftover fries in the toaster oven the next day, they were still impossibly good. I'd venture to say that next-day Marlowe fries were even better than most fresh french fries I've had at restaurants! \n\nMarlowe is doing alot of things right...

The polenta, something I've become a big fan of in recent months, while lacking in meat, was still delicious, albeit a bit salty when not eaten with the polenta itself. The pork chop was also tasty, with a tender interior and a nicely seared and crispy exterior. Likewise, the cauliflower gratin, almost like a mac & cheese, was good as well, tasting mostly of cheese and prosciutto - certainly not a bad thing.\n\nThe only thing that was a bit lacking was the peach crisp - served in a mason jar, it was by no means bad, or even mediocre, but the ice cream lacked bourbon flavor, and the caramel sauce easily overwhelmed the rest of the dessert.

Marlowe advertises them as \"New England chowder in a shell\", although traditional chowder usually consists of clam. They're very creamy and garnished with bacon bits and green onion. Don't let the fact that they're $3 a piece steer you away from giving at least one a try.\n\nThe spiced jumbo gulf shrimp, served with a hot & boozy cocktail sauce, is very flavorful. The shrimp are huge and perfectly seasoned. The heads are included, if you like those (not me though). Again, relatively expensive at $13 for about five shrimps per order.\n\nThe burgers/sandwiches are very delicious as well. They're tall, so if you have a small mouth, you might need to squish them before taking a bite. You get to choose between side fries or side salad. Their fries are very fresh, crispy, and addicting (any type of fries is addicting, but Marlowe's is addicting). If you opt for a side salad instead, note that it's only greens, ie: no tomatoes or anything else, served with a light but tasty dressing.\n\nI had the crispy fried chicken sandwich, which was surprisingly very juicy for white meat.

He asked me if I wanted to join, so I did, and this experience was much better, although it could always be because they knew we were Yelpers(?) \n\nAnyway, we were seated right away. I got the rock shrimp roll, he got the burger, and we also got the cauliflower dish. Cauliflower was really good, like mac'n'cheese but cauliflower. Super yummy. The rock shrimp roll was good, I'd rate it a 4/5. And he said the burger was delicious. (Maybe I just have to give the burger another shot). We also ended with the strawberry crisp which was delicious. \n\nThe food did still take a long time to come out after we placed our order, but maybe that's just a Marlowe thing, I'm guessing everything is made to order. \n\nWow, long review. Would I come back? Yes. I live right around the corner, they do have good food overall, and I do really like the atmosphere. Next things to try: the slow braised bbq lamb sandwich, the mushroom side dish, and I'd take another shot at the burger too.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

The only downfall throughout my experience was the slowness of food delivery. We felt like we were there forever. \n\nEven though the courses came slowly, they were spectacular. We had the brussel sprout chips and they were tasty, but not worth the price. We also ordered the deviled egg and that was simply delicious! It had everything, salt, tart, spice and everything nice.\n\nThen we ordered their bone marrow, we always order the bone marrow, and they were good. They place on the top three of all the ones we've ever tasted. The chile verde-ish topping completely balances the salty, fatty, umami flavor of the marrow. We loved it.\n\nI ordered the sweet corn soup. It was delicious and tasted liked butter popcorn. I could have used a bit more chili oil but it was good as is. \n\nI tasted my boyfriend's dish, I cannot recall what it was, but the meat was super tender and the flavor was divine. I stole a few bites to his dismay. \n\nFinally, we had the dessert. GET THEM!!! We ordered the strawberry one and the chocolate salted one with bourbon ice cream, both were simply amazing. The strawberry one was the best!!! We were licking the bottom of the jars for the morsel! Also, the flavor of the bourbon was pronounced in a good way! \n\nI cannot wait to come back.

The porcini crusting was a delight.\n\nI didn't have the dessert, I prefer to get my calories from protein, fat, and liquor over carbs.

So I asked simply for a side of avocado to place it on the burger myself, that request was also also refused despite stating they had avocado in the kitchen, it's not like they were out.

Had reservation at 9:15. Got sat around 9:30. Food came out quick. It was good. Maybe because we were starving already. The restaurant doesn't close until 11 so we were enjoying our drinks and picking at the food. Our waiter Ernesto decides to come by and pretty much wanted to take everything away... even tho there was a fair amount left.... okay rude. We were just unfortunate to have such a mean waiter that night that completely ruined our meal because he couldn't smile one bit. Obviously he thought oh yeah girls aren't gonna tip well. (I read other reviews about him giving shitty service to certain parties). On top of everything, I asked him nicely if they do anything special for birthdays and he rudely replies we put a candle on any dessert you decide to order. Sure so we ordered. Good thing the nice hostess lady came by told us it was on the house. When we asked for the bill we told him cash and the rest on the card. And he had the nerve to ask \"is the cash including the tip...??\" I've never had anyone ask me that question. I am a server myself. And if the customer wishes to pay cash first and the rest on the card then just settle the amount that way. I honestly did not believe he deserved a single tip with his attitude and service. There is no excuse whether it was the end of the night vs the beginning of the shift. We are paying customers and would like decent service esp since we are celebrating a birthday.

It comes with a side of either fries or a salad, and I typically go with the salad to get my greens in for the day, but the fries are always tasty as well.

I am a chocolate lover so I was suprised when I actually preferred the syrup over the Mexican chocolate. The chocolate cream \"pie\" is a somewhat deconstructed loose interpretation of a pie- it's the filling in a glass jar on top of a sandy crumble (not a true crust), but the guittard chocolate was delicious as was the cream on top with the cocoa nibs and sea salt.

It was full when we got there and I heard the people in front of us get told that they would have to wait 40 minutes, so not question that we needed one.\n\nMy wife and I started out splitting the buttered brussels sprouts as an appetizer, which was really terrific.  They were piping hot, with a combination of butter and lemon that really worked.  That plus some bread (have to ask for it), made a great start to the meal.  For the main course, I had the grilled Niman pork chop, which came with some spicy sauted spinach plus a tomato+vegetable ragout.  The pork chop had a lot of meat, so a very filling entry.  My wife had steak frites, which was a generous helping of meat as well.  We both really liked our entries.  Topped it off with a carafe of wine and had a great meal.\n\nGood ambiance (though the tables are a bit tightly packed) and great service.  Definitely worth the wait!", "author": "Richard M."}

The burrata on endive was playful but mysterious, with an interesting concerto of flavors and textures. The steak tartare was solid, well balanced with seasoning, with a pleasant twist of the poached egg on top rather than simply an egg yolk. The mussels themselves were very tasty but the broth was overly salted. The cauliflower side dish was cheesy goodness. The burger was very good, but unfortunately it seems a little over hyped at this point. The fries were most excellent.\n\nThe service was absent.

I thought the brown butter brussel sprouts were a bit soggy. You get a stronger flavor with the brussel sprout chips plus more texture.\n\nBaked Oysters: While well flavored, I thought these were heavy on the cream and light on the oyster. They are supposed to be \"New England clam chowder in a shell\", but I guess I was expecting more oyster here.\n\nMarlowe Burger: I thoroughly enjoyed the burger, it was juicy and well-seasoned. Well-priced and if you split this with a friend, they will serve the burger on two separate dishes and split the fries as well. Makes for a good appetizer or side dish if you want to order something else.\n\nGrilled Niman Pork Chop: Not only does this dish look epic, it tastes epic as well. Good proportions and very tasty.

Even so it took a long time to get our drink order to our table - like over 10 minutes. Given there was 1 customer at the bar I found it strange that a bottle of sparkling water took that long for the bartender to prepare - for the server to bring.  Secondly why are they not making their own bubbly water in house like everywhere else does? \nAll staff were super friendly.\n\nOrder:\nBrussel chips - tasty but meh - really hard to eat to be satisfying- not really a finger food and yet I think I would need a spoon? \nSpicy Shrimp - these guys came all adorable with their eyeballs in tact in a tiny skillet (my daughter was over the moon) but the flavor was horrendous. I think the kitchen messed these up. They tasted like steamed dirty socks, no amount of lemon could help them.  $16 gets you 4.\nBurger - I like my burger med-rare - both came pretty raw (no biggy)but as I don't eat any sauces I am really picky about the flavoring and quality of the meat. Yes it was high quality but it was pretty boring. Cook that baby in some Wagyu oil and add some salt and pepper and we might be in business. For $16 I'd rather make this at home with my butcher's ground meat.\nFries - delicious, perfect in fact.

If I had to describe the flavor of Marlowe I would say \"truffley.\" The physicality of the space is intimate but not claustrophobic.  The aesthetic is very rustic chic. We ordered the brown butter brussels sprouts- AMAZING. Perfectly soft texture with a decadent flavor unlike any other brussels I've ever had. The portion is also very generous as far as sides go, and they are quite filling. So filling, that when our polenta and cod arrived, I wasn't sure how I'd get it all down! The cod, in a coconut broth with mushrooms, peppers, and fingerlings potatoes had subtle Asian fusion flavors which I loved. The polenta was other worldly. It had mushrooms, parmesan, arugula, truffle salsa verde, and a poached farm egg on top!!! The chef recommends poking the egg and letting it ooze out so that the flavor of the yolk seeps into the other flavors. We did. It turned polenta- a simple food- into the most exquisite thing I've ever tasted. We sat at the bar, where we had amazing and attentive service, and couldn't have been happier.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-07", "description": "OVERRATED.\n\nWe came here from multiple recommendations about their burger--most notably from Thrillist. Our party had reservations at 10PM on a Friday night. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. WE DID NOT RECEIVE OUR FOOD UNTIL 11PM. ONE HOUR DOOR TO DOOR. Perhaps for some of you, that is acceptable. Personally, that is not. Not only did our server take a while to take our orders, the food took longer! Two tables to our right, they were seated AFTER us and received their food BEFORE us. What gives? I questioned our server and she got very snappy and defensive claiming they had appetizers and were seated before us. No, B. I SAW THEM GET SEATED WHILE I WAS ALREADY IN MY CHAIR! Then she proceeds to try and play it off by saying she wanted us to finish our appetizers first then have the cook \"fire up our entrees.\" WHAT IS THAT ABOUT!?? Perhaps I am naive but aren't both dishes either cooked concurrently or at least staggered?? You do not wait until the party is completely done with the appetizer THEN start cooking the entree. One of our friends ordered the poulet vert; our server gave ZERO heads up that it would take 30 minutes to prepare during the order. She drops that bombshell on us when I questioned her. A heads-up would've been somewhat helpful. After that, she served the food and did not bother to check up on us until we asked for the check. Even when paying, we had to wait to get her attention. Eye contact was avoided essentially from the beginning. She may have been the only waiter but that is still no excuse for an establishment like Marlowe. \n\nAs for the burger: OVERRATED. Don't get me wrong, it's decent but for something so highly touted, it was definitely not all that it was cracked up to be. Super Duper is a much better burger for less than half the price. The horseradish aioli takes away from the burger because I am not a big fan of horseradish. Even without it, it wasn't as juicy or tasty as Garaje (right around the block). That burger is 10x better. The fries that came with it were fairly good, however, but on the saltier side. We also ordered flat bread w/ 3 different dipping sauces (the best was the anchovies with cheese). \n\nNext time, there is no next time. One. And. Done.", "author": "Jimmy D."}

Light and not too sweet\n- Wine list: unique offerings like a German langrien and African options\n- Quotes on the window: loved all of the fun food quotes like never trust a girl who doesn't eat her meal, etc\n- Location: super easy to get to via train\n\nMidlights:\n- Steak: nice medium rare but lacked seasoning to enhance the flavor of the cut of meat \n\nLowlights:\n- Only beer and wine\n\nLiked our experience here and I'd come back.", "author": "Eve K."}

Unfortunately, every single time I tried, they were closed. Finally, I decided to call them on Tuesday afternoon and made reservations for two. Garland and I arrived a couple minutes after 8:30pm and stood in line with the patrons in front of us. The hostess greeted us and seated us promptly. \n\nOur waitress, Nico, came over, handed us our menus and briefly went over the special cocktails of the night. We told her we were set on getting a bottle of wine and she recommended to us her favorite on the list: \"Quinary\" Raka, a Bordeaux blend. Great choice! And being such a \"small menu\" they have, we were able to try a decent amount of dishes. \n\nFor starters: \n-Baked oysters \n-Crispy Brussels sprout chips \n-Roasted bone marrow \n-Classic steak tartare \n\nWe really enjoyed the baked oysters and the roasted bone marrow. I'm not a big fan of cooked oysters but their dish was delicious! It had a lightly crispy coating with flavors of cheese and pepperoni. Oyster pizza? Interesting but it was a success! The bone marrow was simply a rich and fatty treat that went perfectly with the lightly toasted bread. I was bummed that the steak tartare didn't taste as well as I thought it because I was told great compliments about it. \n\nFor entrees: \n-Marlowe burger \n-Creekstone Ribeye \n\nFantastic burger! Juicy and meaty. Loved the fact that Nico split our entree in half so that Garland and I didn't have to go through the trouble of splitting our own entrees. Superb service, Nico!\n\nFor desserts: \n-TCHO chocolate cream pie in a jar \n-Upside down pear crisp\n\nUpside down pear crisp brought home the crown. We finished that jar to the pit! Imagine crunch caramel bites, sugared pear and bourbon ice cream all in one bite. Yes, sounds like a little piece of heaven. Chocolate cream pie, however, was a bit too salty for our taste.\n\nMarlowe, you're a great addition to San Francisco!", "author": "Jenny K."}

I had food here I never had before. \n\nThey started us off with these Brussel Sprout chips. I have never heard of that before, but it was really delicious. Me and my workplace killed two bowls of those easily. They were super flavorful, oily, and had my taste buds really going. I don't remember what the other appetizer dish was, but it was some sort of flavored pistachios. A lot of my co-workers said it tasted like bacon. I couldn't wrap my head on what it reminded me of, but they were just as delicious as the chips.\n\nMy main dish was the BBQ lamb sandwich. The sandwich was really easy to eat, I could hold it without difficulty(perfect size) and the chewing of the lamb was very easy. The sandwich wasn't too greasy, or oily either. I really enjoyed it, especially with a side of garlic fries which was both filling and it really hit the spot. \n\nWhen I hear American food I think of McDonalds, Burgers, Steak, and giant greasy unhealthy food. I don't know how healthy Marlowe's is, but I know that I will look at American food in a whole new light now. It was burgers and steaks here, but they were damn good burgers and steaks with fancy names and fancy presentation! \n\nThe atmosphere here is also really nice. They have soothing music playing and the place is nice and small so it gives a real home feeling. It's dimly lit, or it felt that way, makes me really wonder about the experience dining at night. \n\nP.S: I did not have it, but the creative naming of this particular dish had me interested to come back and try it.

Needless to say, I had really really high expectations...and therefore, I came out of my lunch experience thinking it wasn't worth the hype.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I was getting together with some friends for dinner and one of them suggested Marlowe. So here I was ready to give it a second chance - and I'm so glad I did!!!\n\nBelow is what we had:\n- Crispy Brussels Sprout Chips: DEEEE-LICIOUS! I also had this when I came for lunch and I do remember it being yummy. But I honestly can't remember what I had for lunch as my main course...Each chip is light and flaky with just the right amount of salt. It almost tastes like dried seaweed if you've ever had that.\n- Smokey Baked Cauliflower: *Homer Simpson drool sound* Omg...soooo soooo good. It tasted just like mac-and-cheese but even more delicious. And I didn't have to feel guilty eating it because it was...all veggies right? LOL. You must get this in addition to the brussels sprout chips!!\n- Pan Seared Arctic Char: Ok this is embarassing to admit, but I had no idea that an arctic char was salmon. Anyway, I make salmon a lot and so I was a bit disappointed when I saw that I had gotten a salmon dish. However, that disappointment went away as soon as I took a bite. Wow...the sauce...wow. So good. Must get. \n\nI was also lucky enough to get a taste of the Certified Angus New York Steak Frites and \"Poulet Vert\" (aka chicken).

I went here on a semi last-minute whim with two of my buddies before bar hopping in SoMa. It was a packed house when we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night, but the hostess was very accommodating, only having us wait for about 15 minutes before we got bar seating. During that wait, she kindly offerred us a drink menu and served us some ice-cold brews that we enjoyed out on the patio/waiting area.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the bar seating at first, as there were clearly some open tables the remainder of the night. But had we not sat at the bar, we probably wouldn't have gotten the great service and rapport with staff as we did. Some of the biggest highlights include:\n\n1) They ran out of Bone Marrow. However, they kindly offerred to serve what they could, at no cost to us. We agreed and each of us still had a nice sample of that mouth-watering goodness.\n2) We ordered one deviled egg each, but it was so tasty that some of us wanted more. \"another round of deviled eggs?\" says the hostess. \"Sure, why not.\" She clearly coerced us into ordering more, and even though they were not too expensive, this round was also on the house. Very nice of them!\n3)This entire time the bartender (I think his name was Mikey?)  was discussing many of the different bottled beers they had, which we found very informative, but more importantly, delicious! Baba Black Lager, Session Lager, and Trumer Pils...all highly recommended.\n\nWe also ordered the steak tartare (uber tasty) and brussel sprout chips (delicious) for our starters that we demolished. My entree was the PORK CHOP which I found to be one of the most succulent pieces of pork I've ever had. Combine that with the spinach and scalloped sweet potatoes and my stomach was clearly satisfied.\n\nOverall this was a solid eatery, and if I sat anywhere else, I probably would have just given it 4 stars.

Yes, not very classy, but we all wanted to try a little bit of everything.\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprout Chips - These were very light and airy. It reminded me of dried salted seaweed and tasted nothing like brussel sprouts. A little bit too salty for my taste. (3/5)\n\nBaked Oysters - We each got one oyster. It was filled with creamy New England chowder sprinkled with some bacon bits. It was a little hard to see the actual oyster, which is quite small, but overall, the flavors were excellent together. (5/5)\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow - We were sort of hesitant to order bone marrow, but since it was highly recommended on Yelp, we decided to beast it and try it. The marrow itself is quite slimy, but tastes quite delicious paired on top of a toasted bread. Use the salsa verde sauce generously! (4/5)\n\nMarlowe Burger (2) - We ordered 2 burgers. I thought they were just okay? Nothing too special in my opinion. The fries were nice and crispy though. (3/5)\n\nPoulet Vert - Chicken dish. It was nicely seasoned and the meat fell right off the bone. However, be a little careful. This dish came with 3 pieces of chicken and one of ours was quite pink. (3/5)\n\nAs a lover of sweets, it is hard to pass on dessert especially if we come to a fancier restaurant. I was looking forward to trying the TCHO Chocolate Cream Pie, but unfortunately they were out! :( but we did try the other 2 options they had.\n\nUpside Down Strawberry Crisp - Nothing too special.

Curiosity drove my boyfriend to order the roasted bone marrow, which was too much \"weird meat jelly\" for me, but he enjoyed the hearty flavor. \n\nFor my main course, I had the sole stuffed with crab, which was DIVINE if you are half the seafood lover I am.

We ordered the following:\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips with lemon and seasalt ($7): This was ok.  Crispy, tangy and salty... issue was, it was a bit TOO salty. \n\nSpiced Jumbo Gulf Shrimp with hot and boozy cocktail sauce ($13): The spicy sauce tasted really good with the jumbo gulf shrimp. Grilled to perfection. Meat was very juicy. \n\nMarlowe Burger ($13): I ordered it medium rare and it that is how I got my burger. It was really juicy but lacked flavor to make it worth the price. I want to say the burger was salty, but I wasn't sure if it is the fries that made it taste salty. The downside of the whole thing was that the fries was just too salty. At first I thought it was just me, but my co-worker looks at me and asks me if it was salty and I said yes. I had to use my steak knife to scrape off all the excess salt in order to eat the fries. I was just very disappointed. \n\nService was good. We requested a lot of things from the servers and they were very accommodating.  Just sad that most of the things I ate was way too salty!!", "author": "Erica T."}

There's a few small tables for 2 or 4 around and one huge communal table.  They can accommodate big groups, but you'd be spread out down this long cafeteria-type table and it's hard to talk to everyone in the group since the restaurant tends to be very crowded and loud.  \n\nThe food here is ahhhh-mazing.  \nLOVED the apps. We had: \n- the brussel sprout chips - crisp and delish\n- burrata - sooo good. Creamy, fresh, and delicious.  My dad (who isn't a huge fan of cheese loved it)\n- Bone marrow - who doesn't love beefy meat fat? (lol)\n- Deviled eggs - tasty (mine are better, but best ones I've had in a restaurant)\n\nBetween us we had the pork chop, 2 burgers and a little gems salad.\n\nThe pork chop was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.  It was super tasty and weirdly tasted like steak sometimes. The burgers were good, the meat was definitely quality beef.  My only complaint was that there was too much bread in the bun. It felt like bread with some meat on the side.

Because when I order a burger rare, it ALWAYS comes out medium rare.  Whenever I used to order a medium rare burger at other restaurants, they always came out medium well, which does NOT fly with me.  Call me a savage, but I like to see a little [or a lot of] blood in my meat.  This is a tried and true technique for me. \n\nNot with Marlowe!  My burger came out seared, perfectly red and juicy in the middle.  Cradled in a soft bun with caramelized onions, melted cheddar, shredded lettuce, bacon, and horseradish aioli, the Marlowe burger was a tantalizing dream come true!  Every bite was flavorful and delicious!  I`m drooling on my computer just thinking about it LoLx\n\nThe Brussels Sprout chips are so ADDiCTiNG!  Crispy fried and flavored with lemon and sea salt, you can't have just one.  The Roasted Bone Marrow with salsa verde is decadent and sinfully delicious.  The Baked Oysters are creamy, smokey, and oh so good!  The Deviled Eggs are small bites of pure heaven.  \n\nSome of the servers are a bit standoffish, but the food more than makes up for it.  The restaurant is small, so it's not a good place to go with a big party.  Also, they do table sharing, so this probably wouldn't be a good place to bring someone on an intimate date.  Since it's a small place, it also gets LOUD when the place fills up.  All in all, I'd definitely recommend this place to all my friends.  Writing about the food here is making me hungry.

Although we had reservations for 9PM, we still had to wait about 10 minutes before our table was ready. I would've been fine with that but there is absolutely no room to wait inside the restaurant and it was extremely cold outside. \n\nWe ordered a carafe of red wine, 2 Warm Deviled Eggs, and a medium rare burger each. Our food came out extremely fast but our wine did not. The eggs were surprisingly good, but expensive at $1.50 for 1/2 an egg, not \"a\" egg like the menu states. The burgers were cooked perfectly but the patties were a bit thin for my taste and the bun also three times as thick. The fries were DELICIOUS though. Fried perfectly and the horseradish aoili that accompanied it was delicious. We ordered the Chocolate Creme Pot for dessert and I was bit disappointd. The sea salt definitely overpowered the chocolate in the dessert. \n\nAnother negative, in my mind, is that there is only one bathroom in the whole restaurant. I just wanted to wash my hands but standing around, waiting for the bathroom to become available was a bit awkward because, as stated before, there is no standing room. \n\nOverall, after a second try, I am sad to say it wasn't the \"BEST\" burger I've ever had. It is one of BETTER ones I've had though.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Had a reservation here for my family of 10. Like the previous big party review listed here, we were given a limited/smaller menu. We were not told of this which is kind of a bummer. We did not see the bone marrow nor the scallops on the menu, which happened to be the two things we wanted. As the previous post stated, \"What's the difference between 5 tables of 2 coming in ordering bone marrow and scallops and our table of ten?\" Well, the difference is that in situation 1, there would never be a moment where ALL 5 tables would be sat at the same time. Front of house will stagger those tables out so that the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed with the orders. I'm guessing the scallops and bone marrow are very long and task heavy dishes that would halt the kitchen. I just wish they would've told us.\n\nThe food overall was pretty good. For starters, we had the ahi tuna, steak tartare, brussel sprout chips, and baked oysters. The ahi tuna was OK. The tuna salad thing that came with ahi was mediocre. The brussel sprout chips were tasty. Baked oysters... well didn't really taste the oyster. It was just all cheese and bread crumbs. For entree, I got the pork chop. It was delicious. Props to the chef. I got some steak from my mom's dish and that was also incredibly tasty as well.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back here but I wouldn't say that every item on this menu is worth getting.", "author": "edward k."}

Well, comparatively so compared to the LA foodies who have 10+ gourmet burger places to choose from. What I look for in a burger:\n\n- A good toasted bun which can retain its form even when the juices from the beef patty leak out. Usually I find that it helps to burn the inner end of each side of the bun a little because this forms a shield of sorts which is not easily permeable by liquid. Additionally, a good burger bun should never be chewy. That's what the bun is there for.\n- As far as the beef patty goes, the typical rules for good beef apply. On top of that all you want is a good crispy sear on the edges of the patty after a medium rare grilling.\n- A nice slice of cheese that stays gooey and melty while you eat the burger.\n\nI would say that Marlowe's burger gets the patty and cheese close to right but I wasn't totally sold on the bun. While it was easy to bite through, there wasn't much else to it.\n\nAnd have some perspective, it's $12 or more to have it. There's something not right about a beef patty, buns, cheese and fries breaking the double-digit barrier. (Though moving to NYC I am sure I will have to change my thinking on this or go hungry.)\n\nMarlowe's burger was good, just not poetry in motion.

The hostess (possibly owner/manager) is from New Zealand and tries her best to get everyone drinks while they wait.\n\nWe were finally seated at a communal table (almost picnic style) but there was a huge beam in between my friends and I. A little strange seating seat up.\n\nWe ordered a variety of items. I had the burger (great), the hubs had the roasted chicken (very flavorful, better than NOPA, also yummy), and we shared the brussell chips (not a fan-too bitter and too salty).  We also ordered a dessert, some kind of fruit crisp and were disappointed with the flavors in that.", "author": "Betty C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-29", "description": "I ate at Marlowe with my aunt and my brother on Dec11. The menu online seemed promising (ie they got me with the usage of a good few \"key words\"). I called on Dec10 to make a reservation for 7PM on Dec11. The person who answered the phone was quite nice... but there was nothing available that evening unless I wanted to go in at 630PM or 1030PM.\n\nI said I would take the 630PM... but I might need to cancel it later if I could find another place that had 7PM open. She was kind and said that would not be a problem. The same lady called to confirm my reservation sometime in the afternoon and I confirmed since other places in the area were also booked.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Marlowe, I could see why reservations filled up so quickly. The place is very small, but it has an intimate feeling to it. Cute! Our party was actually a bit late to the restaurant... but we called them and asked if it was ok or not. They said it was fine since they had budgeted a certain amount of time for us to eat and the next reservation for our table was at 8PM. Very good for them (a little bad on us...).\n\nWe ordered...\n\nBrussel sprout chips : Hmm. I think these are a little overhyped on yelp for me. Yes, they are good. They were also on the oily side (yes I know they're fried... but still!). I liked the citrus they used to season the chips... but the salt was unevenly distributed. Some chips were fine and some were unbearably salty.\n\nBaked oysters: I was amazed at the bed of sea salt these were served on. It looked cool... kinda like how raw oysters are served on ice. I was also amazed that they were so so so salty! The reason they were so salty was because of the bacon bits and additional sea salt on top of the oysters. Salt does bring out the flavor of certain foods... but one must be careful with sea salt. Its huge chunks can lead to overseasoning. The oyster however was fresh and nice... I just think the preparation and flavor profile of this dish was too heavy handed.\n\nBaked bone marrow: It was good.... but again, very very salty. I don't know how people can enjoy this dish when all I tasted was salt and fat. I also could've used a few more slices of bread to eat it with. I'm glad this appetizer was shared... there's no way I could have eaten this salty dish all on my own. Though a chick at a table to my right had no problem doing so. Hmm...\n\nWith these salty appetizers, I made a request to one of the servers.... our entrees HAD to be cooked with less salt!\n\nAnd they delivered... sort of.\n\nMy aunt ordered the stuffed sole with dungeness crab. It was cooked well... the flavor was light. Just the sort of thing my aunt likes... except she eats blander than bland food and she still thought the dish was salty. I thought it was fine though?\n\nMy brother ordered their famous burger with bacon, carmelized onions, and fries. The fries were good... but the aioli was just so-so. The aioli didn't have enough punch (or in this case... wasabi flavor). I didn't try the burger, though my brother said the bacon was pretty salty. But it's bacon... it's supposed to be salty... but I can't say since I didn't try it.\n\nI ordered the pork chop... which was just okay. I liked the sauce they used... it was a bit sweet and mustardy... yum! The pork chop I got was just OK... some parts were very fatty. Some parts were cooked all right... some parts seemed over cooked. The sides were excellent, the potato things they had on the side were very good and rich. I believe they are called \"parmesean dumplings\" on the menu. The applies also went well with the sweet taste of the pork chop.\n\n should also add that their portions are quite generous. After eating my entree I was REALLY stuffed. But yes... there was a bit of room for dessert. ;) For dessert, we ordered the pear crisp with bourbon ice cream. It was good, though the sauce they used in it was a little too sweet for my tastes. I'm sure most people will like it though. I didn't like the presentation of the dessert in the jar though... for $8 the jar just kind of screams \"cheap.\" Part of why I like dessert is the nice plating. However I noticed this places likes \"jars\" since the deviled ham special was also in a jar... Maybe it's just their thing.\n\nOverall rating is a solid 3. It's ok... there are better places out there. However their service is quite good as I mentioned. Our beverages were also constantly refilled without asking, excellent. One piece of advice: their kitchen is kind of slow... so keep that in mind. If you're looking for a \"quick dinner\"... Marlowe isn't it. But if you have some time to spare... it might be worth a try if you have a higher salt tolerance than I do. ;)\n\nWill I return? Maybe to try the burger... but there are so many other places to check out that this will need to wait.", "author": "michelle l."}

I walked in with my friend and put on a little charm and luckily they were able to seat us pretty quick knowing that we just came for the burger and would be out in 40mins or so.\n\nWe started off with the Steak Tartar even though we were about to get our week's worth of beef for the evening - great start.  Then the burger came and we got a side of Brussel Sprouts.   Not the best sprouts I've ever had but I do have to say that the burger was one of the best in the city, and I've had quite a few.

Not needed but that was very nice of them. They put a candle in her desert towards the end of the night as well.

So what I got,\nBone Marrow, Brussel Sprout Chips\nPorkchop,\nStrawberry Crisp.\n\nBone Marrow was actually ok, not the best. But not bad. A little lacking on the flavor and the texture was a little off (not very smooth, actually kind of gummy). Sort of pricey for what you got. I mean I was expecting super buttery bone marrow that would just spread on all the toasts, with a bunch of herbs and spices on it, but it seemed meh for some reason. Came with a sauce that tasted good, but I mean yeah I could have just put the sauce on the bread then.\n\nBrussel Sprout chips were amazingly tasty. I was not expecting that. Shared a bunch with a group of 3. I wouldn't call it a meal but it was a solid appetizer. \n\nNext was the pork chop, I was really really hoping for the same quality pork chop that you get at Nopa. It was a pretty big portion. The seasoning on the outside of the pork chop was pretty good. But the inside was really dry imo. I know it's pork but she said they would cook it medium.

Their burger is so great I'm not sure that I'll ever order anything different as my main course, no matter how good everything else looked!\n\nWe started with the brussel sprout chips and burrata from the snack menu. If they sold these chips at movie theaters I might have to give up my popcorn addiction. As for the burrata, it was ooey, gooey greatness. A smaller portion, the perfect way to kick off the meal.\n\nAs much as I like bacon, I don't usually order it on my burger. But since Marlowe's burger came with bacon (and I'm one to always follow chef's orders!) I went with it. I find it hard to put into words how good this burger was. The meat was a perfect medium rare, perfectly seasoned and (following our theme) the fries were perfectly hot and crispy.\n\nWines are available by the glass, carafe and bottle. Service was great from beginning to end. But what stuck with us was how great the burger was. Wow. In a town full of fancy pants burgers, Marlowe's version deserves all the acclaim its been receiving and is firmly at the top of my SF burger list.", "author": "phil h."}

We made a reservation here because it was close to where I was staying for work (near Caltrain at 4th/King). I had the polenta which was creamy and delicious. He had the burger which was about as amazing as a burger is capable of being. \n\nThe real stars of the meal though were the appetizers. We got 2 deviled eggs to start and immediately had to order 2 more because of how delicious they were. The combination of herbs and the perfect crispy bacon was out of this world. The brussels sprout chips were also pretty incredible.\n\nI'll be dreaming of those deviled eggs for a long time.", "author": "Carson S."}

For a few days all of our meals were associated with reservations made ahead of time. Funny enough, this unplanned visit to Marlowes was the best of our trip to SF. \n\nWe sat at the communal table--and liked it. We enjoyed baked pistachios and brussel sprout chips. For our main, one got the pork chop and two had the NY Strip. Each dish was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, they were presented in mini mason jars. The chocolate cake with sea salt was the perfect compliment to the dish before it. I recommend this place for a small group to grab a delicious and non-high maintenance meal. The only negative was the one stall bathroom. But all of the pros outweigh the cons, so get on it and get to Marlowes.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Nice wine selection with a couple pricier wines.   I know this.   Short story, had a blind date here that proceeded to tell me he didn't feel a connection but wanted to get my opinion on a girl that cheated on him and should he take her back.   I told him we needed more wine, ordered the good stuff and gave him the worst advice ever.   If you're not going to give your best effort on a date, I'm certainly not and it will cost you.   \n\nThe burger is everything it gets credit for and more.   You should get the Marlowe burger at least once.  My hands down favorite is their marrow.  Mainly because not many places offer it and Marlowe does it best.   If you've never tried it, this is the place to go for your first time.

On its own, each ingredient is tasty enough -- Acme roll, Niman Ranch beef (plus a little lamb), horseradish a\u00efoli, caramelized onions, shredded lettuce, and crisp bacon -- but in combination, they form a delicious Voltron for your mouth. The next time you're in search of grub near the CalTrain station, grab a drink at Marlowe's bar, order a bowl of crunchy/salty Brussels sprout chips, and tear into a burger. (It's better and cheaper than getting a beer, bratwurst and garlic fries at the ballpark, if that's where you're headed.)\n\nBut Marlowe's other food deserves high praise, too. The little gem salad and Berkeley burrata appetizer (with peach and chili) are nice, light starters, and the spiced prawns are terrific, too. I'm a big fan of the roasted bone marrow with salsa verde and herbs; I don't even bother spreading the oozy, fatty marrow on bread; after a dip in the salsa, it goes right into my mouth. And even my wife, who is unequivocally anti-scallop, doesn't mind the dayboat scallops with eggplant, cherry tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins. \n\nThe only dish I've not absolutely loved is the seared halibut with spinach, glazed vegetables and bagna cauda butter. I'm sure an objective diner would find it delicious, but the subtlety of this plate was overpowered by the strong flavors of the other dishes I ate. \n\nOverall, I really dig this place.

It came in a good size toasted bun with cheddar and bacon and an aioli sauce.  I think what really makes their burger is the sauce since the meat patty, bacon and cheddar were standard issue.  The funny thing I noticed that everyone of the male patron of this place ordered the burger.   \n\nOverall, I was pretty impress with the good service and friendliness of the staff.  I don't think their burger was the best I ever had, however I could definitely see their appeal.  This is a good place that I would come back.", "author": "Jim J."}

Just saying.  \n\nSmall and intimate, tough to get a table, but a great vibe.

The decor, well there is not much space and some exposed brick, so i guess they were trying to look like a NY chic place.  It falls far short of that.\n\nAs for the food, I actually had to send one of the dishes back it was so bad.  I almost never send stuff back to the kitchen, but it the brussel sprouts were so salty, they were inedible.  The pork chop was good, but the parmesan dumpling was this over salted gross wad of cheese.  My friend had the risotto and again a bit over seasoned.  Everything was such a disappointment.

It was a perfect introduction to savory crepes!  However, with that said, I would have to knock down a star for finding hair on my food and another for service.  Restaurants are usually good at prioritizing the correction of sanitation faults but it took so long to get the replacement of my entre that by the time it came, my husband already finished his burger and fries.  I also ordered the Meyer Lemon Cr\u00e8me Brulee for dessert which I regretted, having to wait awhile for something mediocre.  If you have to finally ask your server when you think your food is coming, twice - you've waited for a long time.\nSomething also didn't add up when we first walked up and gave the hostess our reservation time.  First, she couldn't find our name and flat out said that we didn't have a reservation until my husband pointed the name out from her list.  Next, she indicated that the we made the reservation for the wrong time (3:15pm instead of 2pm).  Absolutely untrue as the reservation was made on Open Table and didn't have that 15minute option.  Luckily, they did have tables available and was able to sit us down right away.  So we definitely, got off on the wrong foot.

They were hot and crispy.  Second time, the chips were a little cold so I blame it on it being busy.\n\nBaked Oysters - new england clam chowder in a shell.  Definitely doesn't taste like New England Clam Chowder but still pretty darn tasty, not sure if it's worth $3 dollars though...you should try it and see for yourself.\n\nThe steak tartar was served with a quail egg and a crostini, pretty good in my book but again $12 is a little pricey.  It's almost the same price as the burger...\n\nMarlowe burger is a lamb and beef burger topped with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli & fries.  The first time I had the burger, it was quite juicy and the bread was nice and soft.  The second time I had the burger, it was less juicy and it was more charred so that charred taste over powered all the other flavors going on in the burger - again I blame the consistency on it being more crowded.  The fries however were definitely on target, nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  \n\nThe office burger down in LA wins my vote.  The onions are carmelized with a balsamic vinaigrette and adds a nice sweetness to the burger.  The burger is topped with blue cheese and arugula which adds a nice bite...and the Patty, the patty is always medium rare and super super juicy.  Marlowe's burger was juicy the first time but not the second time.  This restaurant would get a 5 in my book if it could keep up with their consistency even when they're busy.\n\nI like the decor of this place; there is a slanted beam in the middle of the restaurant that runs through the table and I also like the service here.  The staff is really friendly and they do take reservations unlike Father's office where you have to hoover over people while they eat and chat and jump on their table once they leave.  \n\nParking may be a little tough, although the parking lot at Bank of America has opened up at night for $5 a spot.  My BF lives on Bryant so it's just a short walk for us which is a plus.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend people to go to this place early for a good burger.

This kind of stuff doesn't bother me.\n\nConveniently located, Marlowe is a hop and a skip away from Caltrain. I did not make a reservation, but remembered walking by this cozy-looking joint before and decided I would finally succumb to its dimly lit interior. \n\nIt was another crowded evening filled with chatter. My walk-in status earned me a seat at the bar, or I could've opted for a table and test my hunger's patience. I chose the former, which ended up working out. My champagne glass was refilled quickly, which I'm sure would've taken more time had I been at a table. And I was able to enjoy some friendly conversation with the guy working the bar. The burger and fries I indulged in were worthy of savoring every bite, down to the last crumb. I look forward to returning to try some of the other tasty items I saw on the menu. Although it may be a challenge since I've kind of been on a burger binge lately. Guilty!", "author": "Jaime L."}

After hearing great things about this place, we had high expectations.. and I think my dining experience at Marlowe definitely met my expectations. \n\nWe ordered and shared crispy brussel sprout chips, which was lightly seasoned with sea salt and lemon. Who knew that Marlowe could make me eat brussel sprouts? (well, the only other way to eat brussel sprouts is if it's cooked with bacon, in my opinion) And who knew you could turn a somewhat bitter vegetable into chips? What a brilliant idea! So, I highly recommend this app. We liked it so much that we ordered another one after finishing the first one within like 10 minutes max. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the grilled niman pork chop, which was cooked perfectly.. juicy, not dry! It came with a side of garlic-creamed spinach and beans. The portion was huge and more than enough for me, but as a dedicated foodie, I ate it all. \n\nFor dessert, my friends and I shared the vanilla bean panna cotta affogato. I have to say this was probably the highlight of the meal and a great way to end it. The combination of vanilla, strong coffee syrup, and lemon biscotti was foodgasmic. I loved it and wanted to have more even though I was stuffed. It's a must-try for dessert. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for a \"I want to impress the girl- first date\" location or a girl's night out with the besties.", "author": "Cassy H."}

Bone marrow was a half order because they ran out - we came at 9:30PM on a Saturday - and was given to us for free. Deviled eggs were out of this freaking world.

The place is pretty small so I suggest making reservations ahead of time. Everyone in our group ordered the burger and it was good. The meat was juicy and flavored well. The only flaw from my meal was that the inside of my bun was burnt so I it felt like I was licking a BBQ grill. At that point I was super hungry and just kept eating. They also add shredded lettuce rather than the usual peel from the lettuce bunch which I felt made it less messy and easier to consume. The fries were also good and crispy. Prior to our meal we ordered the crispy Brussels chips as appetizers. They're good IF you already like brussel sprouts. For dessert I had the chocolate cookie pie. It was a cute little dessert inside of a jar with crumbles on the bottom and chocolate mousses top. It's super sweet tho but I liked it. The strawberry crisp dessert wasn't available unfortunately which was kind of a bummer since I was looking forward to having it. Don't know how that happened since we arrived an hour after opening on a Sunday. Also, bone marrow isn't available to large groups. Our server was nice and checked up on us frequently however, they forgot to put a candle on the dessert for my cousins birthday and we really wanted him to be surprised so it was kinda lame having to send the dessert back and get it back with the candle.

It came with a side of french fries and horseradish aioli.  The burger was good, quite good.  Juicy and flavorful without a hint of greasiness or heaviness.  The fries were amazing.  They were really, really good - crisp, well seasoned, airy on the inside.  The aioli was a nice condiment, but for my taste I wished it had more horseradish in it as I found it rather bland and did not do much to complement the burger or fries.\n\nI had noticed that a lot of people were ordering the poulet vert, which was my second choice for an entree.  One friend seemed to really enjoy his stuffed blue sole dish.  Entree portions are generous, but not ginormous.  Cocktails certainly play a role in the dining experience.

That was my original thought upon pulling up to this somewhat dubious looking exterior, but that is just the way of the world now - it's cool to be under the radar and somewhat 'edgy' Especially in one of the coolest cities of the world where you really have to up your 'cool game.' Another misconception that the exterior can provide is size. The dining area is surprisingly smaller than what it would seem. It's in a huge, industrial structure for darn sake. However, the size definitely doesn't discourage one from noticing the somewhat sever, yet elegant design of the restaurant. Large steel beams are serving as actual support, but provide an interesting aesthetic appeal while also dividing the open room. \n\nAfter all 9 of squeezed into the end of a long, family style table - we couldn't help but notice just how close we were to our stranger neighbors. Not a bother to me, but I can see how the close proximity while your eating could be a buzz kill. Nevertheless, we were instantly greeted and offered wine, to which we all happily obliged. We sipped on some delicious vino while we complimented the clever idea to showcase the specials on a large piece of butcher paper nailed to the wall and took in the delicately constructed entrees consisting of strong and poignant ingredients: mushroom soup with truffle oil, seared ahi tuna over a bed of Israli Cous Cous, haricot vert (whatever that is), and candied olives. From the fun chatter at the table, the burger seemed to be hit. As well as the brussels sprout chips. I, of course, went straight for the tuna and couldn't be more happy with my choice. Unlike other ahi tuna plates, this had an shockingly wonderful spice to it. The flavors were distinct and the tuna was perfectly prepared.", "author": "Frances H."}

We made reservations on OpenTable and were seating immediately.\n\nThe ambience is nice, kind of rustic, Western, American. It's a big open room yet the tables are proportioned properly so conversation was intimate.\n\nWe were craving brussel sprouts so we started with the bussel sprout crisps (appetizer) and whole bussel sprouts (side dish). The crisps were better. Sweet Meyer Lemon coupled with delicious savory, salty, oily goodness. Like potatoes, brussel sprouts are perfect vessels for oily goodness. \n\nFor my main I got the burger medium. It was tasty, but by the end it was a little overwhelming with so much flavor -- bacon, white sauce, and grilled onions. It would have benefited from more lettuce/tomato/avocado to balance out the heaviness.\n\nMy friend ordered the pork chops. We agreed the pork was good but a bit too fatty for our taste.\n\nThe best main was probably the poulet vert, which my other friend ordered.

The steak, served medium rare, arrived as a hearty cut and by the time we left I'd had plenty to balance out the duration of my evening.

Space is super cozy, there's a communal table in the middle but we got a nice solo table on the edge of the restaurant.  \n\nRight off, started with a glass of wine (pretty good list,  nice mix of domestics and international wines), and we shared a ton of food.  They were out of eggs (we were there for a late dinner) so we didn't get to try them.  But we did have the crispy brussel sprouts, the pork belly and mushroom soup.  Everything was really good.  Crispy brussel sprouts were more like flaked chips (not whole or halves) - but lemon zesty with a perfect amount of salt and savory - an indulgence but worth it.  Pork belly was good (I've had better, but at the same time, I would order this again) and mushroom soup was warm, hearty and creamy.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the polenta - has a lot of truffle flavor (even though not described as such on the menu).  It was creamy and rich, but mine had a few smallish lumps in there (not a huge deal to me), mushrooms were a nice change of texture from the polenta itself.  Ad there was also some arugula served with this - nice spicy change of flavor and texture.  For me, having this dish once will be enough - it was satisfying and good, but super filling - I'm usually a really big eater but couldn't finish my plate.  And I always feel like certain dishes (risotto, polenta) tend to have the same flavor through the whole plate so I get tired of eating it eventually. \n\nBut of course, even though I was stuffed, we needed to order dessert!  We ordered the chocolate cream pie - served in a cute little mason jar, it was a nice spin on real chocolate creme pie - topped with cocoa nibs which added a nice bitterness and crunch, and sea salt!  Wow!  That absolutely made it for me - just the right amount of salt where the dessert wasn't overkill on the sweet factor.  A perfect ending to the meal.  \n\nMarlowe is a little out of the way, and an itty bitty space.  If i was in the mood for a nice splurge, I would return here.", "author": "Stephanie P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-15", "description": "The food was 5 stars.  Great meal.  The stuffed sole, the fries and the cauliflower gratin were great.  This was one of the best meals I've had in SF since I moved here about 7 months ago.\n\nIf I'm raving about the food, why only 2 stars you ask?  The service.  Plain and simple.\n\nSo I had a 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday night.  I got there a bit early and wanted to see if I could move up the reservation.  The hostess explained to me that they were quite busy and probably wouldn't be able to seat me any earlier than the reservation time.  She invited me to wait at the bar and have a drink while I waited.  I understood that I was early and had no problem sitting at the bar.\n\nHalf way though my beer, I see one of the staff members walk over, look at me and then walk away.  Not sure what that was about, I went along with my business and sipped my beer.  A few minutes later, the hostess came back and asked me if I wouldn't mind giving up my seat at the bar and waiting \"over there.\"  I thought this was a bit weird, since I was invited to sit at the bar and I had a drink, but whatever.  I'll go with the flow.  \n\n\"Over there\" turned out to be the small area around the hostess stand where there were already 2 women standing.  I asked the hostess, \"did you mean here?\"  She said \"There's a bench outside...\"  and out I went.  Now, I've spent my entire life on the east coast and in the midwest and know what cold is, and SF in December is not what I call cold.  But it's not what I call warm or inviting, either.  My choices were either stand there in the way or sit out in the \"cold.\"  \n\nAs I sat outside, I started to think about the events.  I understand that they were busy and probably overbooked.  I also understand that they were doing their best to accommodate their guests.  But, how do you invite someone to sit at the bar, which as far as I could tell was a first come first serve bar, and then ask them to sit outside so you can seat other guests.  \n\nThe same hostess also asked a party of four to leave the bar area and join me in the evening air so she could seat other guests for dinner.\n\nI eventually go back in around the time of my reservation.  And wait.  And wait.  The hostess was apologetic and explained that people were lingering.  We waited for about 30 minutes past our reservation time.  \n\nDuring this time, the hostess received a phone call and booked a reservation for 8:45.  The hostess seemed like a nice woman and she seemed to be aware of her surroundings, so I'm not sure what possessed her to book the 8:45 reservations.  When you have a few people with 7:30 reservations who have been waiting for more than 20 minutes and haven't been seated yet and more reservations walking in the door with no one leaving, does it make sense to make a reservation at 8:45?  \n\nMaybe the computer told her there was a reservation available at this time, but her eyes, ears and common sense probably should have said otherwise.  To be fair, I've never worked as a hostess and I imagine there is some skill or sense that comes with it after awhile, so maybe she had some special knowledge that I did not have, but it didn't seem like a reasonable thing to do.  This is supported by the fact another hostess came over to the couple seated next to me around 9 or 9:10 and asked them to take their conversation to the bar so they could seat another couple.  \n\nTo the hostess's credit, she seemed sincerely apologetic about my wait and brought us a complimentary order of the brussel sprout chips after our reservation came and went.  However, inviting your guests to wait at the bar and then inviting them to wait outside so you can seat other guests really is the opposite of hospitality.  It's a shame, because the food was great", "author": "Larry L."}

I really want to give a 3-star rating BUT fortunately, the wait staff, whose name I did not get, was the saving grace and what gives Marlowe the extra star. She was super sweet and friendly. She was also knowledgeable to the wines which my date ordered. The young lady was also training a gentleman which I am sure will narrow this down. Both were fun and made us laugh as we did them. I will definitely go back and do recommend this restaurant as I am a concierge. I will however, advise that the diner tell the wait staff to remind the kitchen to go easy on the salt if you don't like salty appetizers.", "author": "Anthony R."}

A couple of cocktails and the burger later (along with a side of roasted cauliflower with cheese), I have to wonder what all the hype is about.  The burger was good (once I took off half of the giant bun), but the actual patty couldn't have been more than a 1/4 lb (tiny).  Good fries, but I wouldn't go out of my way for either.

We started with the brussel sprout chips that I swear they make them out of crack.  Well, not crack, but maybe something really addicting and delicious, like Shamrock Shakes.  But not Shamrock Shakes, cause god knows this place isn't McDonalds, so maybe the best way to analogize those brussel sprout chips is to liken them to pure happiness.  There, that's about right.\n\nI then followed up my pure-happiness-in-a-bowl-brussel-sprouts with the Savory Bread Pudding that was oh so yummy I can still taste it if I close my eyes shut and put on the slightest hint of a smile.

I've lowered my rating from 5 to 4 stars because the hostess/owner and server didn't come through as promised while we waited. Given the success of both Marlowe and Park Tavern, my experience is probably rare.\n\nI recommended Marlowe to a friend from Seattle who was interviewing since I'd heard great things about their burger and wanted to try it. Despite this being a weekday, Marlowe was crowded, even early, like a Friday night. \n\nThe hostess, who identified herself as the owner, offered us a free glass of wine because our table wasn't ready. Then she promised one at the end of our meal if we could leave the table...my friend's verbosity was stretching out our meal and he wasn't picking up  my hints to leave. Before you rise to his defense, we'd passed the 1.5-hour mark and 10-15 people were waiting inside and outside the restaurant. \n\nUnfortunately though, we paid for both rounds, as well as the third round (second at the time) of wine ordered at the table. Oh well, stuff happens. I haven't been back but obviously plenty of other people have.\n\nThe bacon cheeseburger itself was very good, though not the transcendental experience I'd expected based on friends who knew about my burger list and claimed it was the best burger in SF. If you're a burger lover, don't be afraid to eat it. If I'm wrong, please let me know why I need to go back and try again. \n\nRegardless, the quality of every dish is obvious.

I found Marlowe through Yelp, and made reservations.  Here's how the night went down:\n\nParking: if you take the Cal train into the city this place is super easy to get to.  We had to drive and opted for the valet because I was stupid enough to make reservations the same night the Giants were playing a home game (only $12 for valet 2 blocks away from the restaurant).  \n\nAmbiance:  there's a yippie type of vibe in the place (similar to what you'd find at restaurants in the surrounding area).  Family style seating and there really isn't that much room in the whole place, so I would highly recommend reservations. MIT is pretty dark in the place and I could have used a little more light to read my menu.   It is also pretty loud and was hard for all members in our party of 5 to have one conversation going on.\n\nFood:  it was all pretty darn good.  Fairly simplistic and \"California\".  Salads were dressed with simple dressings.  The deviled eggs were really tasty.  I had the polenta.  It was a really hearty meal.  Other members of my party got the Marlowe burger.  They all said it was delicious as the juices were running down their arms.  I personally loved the fries that came with the burger.\n\nStaff:  all staff members were friendly and gave us attention, nothing to complain about.\n\nIt didn't get 5 stars from me because it was a little cramped and noisy for our group.

It's impossible to head down any street or alleyway and not trip over a bushel of small, innovative (fairly) reasonably priced restaurants that would be the talk of the town anywhere else.  While Marlowe certainly isn't hidden (across from Caltrain) or obscure (on literally every best new restaurant list in 2010), it still makes you glad you live in a place that loves food so much.\n\nIn terms of food, it's hard to argue with items like deviled eggs with bacon, brussel sprout chips, poulet vert, or the almighty Marlowe burger.  The burger in particular stood out with its nice bun and generous toppings (horseradish aoili!).  Beer and wine selection was focused and pretty reasonably priced.\n\nThe space is comfortable and cozy, if a little odd.  We were seated at the communal table, which happens to have a big steel beam angling from its center up to the ceiling.  Not a big deal, but it would kind of suck to get seated directly in front of it.  The place was busy, and crowded, but service was prompt due to how small the place is.\n\nAs a side note, I have a theory that the only way to truly enjoy brussel sprouts is to treat them purely as a vehicle for delivering delicious salt and fat.  Anyone who says they love the taste of them plain and/or steamed is a liar or an incurable health nut.  Either way, you probably don't want them giving you food advice.  They probably don't even like bacon.", "author": "Ted B."}

I literally had no idea this was here until I was searching for sweet new dinner spots in my hood, and alas, I found Marlowe. \n\nI came here with a girlfriend, and we cozied up at the bar, which was perfect. The restaurant is pretty small, and it's got this really cool ambiance that seems fairly dark since the colors are dark walls, tables and chairs, with white floors and dim lighting, which makes it feel small, and not like you're in a massive bustling restaurant. It's a pretty quiet and laid back atmosphere - yet intimate and cozy.\n\nThe first starter we got here was the crispy brussels sprout chips served with lemon and sea salt ($6) These are the most awesome concept of brussels sprouts that I've ever seen on a menu.  They are crispy and salty like a chip or a potato crisp, and at the same time it has this citrusy flavor with it that makes it perfect. I could easily eat brussels sprouts like this every day, but they are a bit greasy since they are obviously cooked in olive oil.  Regardless, they are awesome and you must try them if you come.\n\nThe other starter we got were the deviled eggs. These come with aged provolone, a pickled jalapeno on top and bacon ($1.5 each). MMMMMM! These might be the BEST deviled eggs that I've had in the city.  The pickled jalapeno on top is an awesome touch because its bitter and distinguished, and almost *anything* is good with bacon - let's be honest here.\n\nWe were also served a complimentary baked oyster, which is served hot with oyster in the shell.  How nice of them to give us a little something extra on the side!\n\nFor the main dish, I got the Anson Mills polenta, which is served with wild mushrooms, truffled pecorino and a poached farm egg ($18).  This polenta was awesome! The poached egg is a nice touch too, because you get the runny yolk to mix into all of the mushroom and polenta goodness :)  I really didn't want anything too heavy for a main course, and even though I couldn't finish the dish because it was big, it was really awesome!\n\nOverall, Marlowe gets a solid 4 stars in my book.

Nice! Between the two of us, we ordered the two deviled eggs, roasted lemon brussel sprouts, pork chop, and the supposedly famous burger. I'm not usually a fan of deviled eggs because I dislike the oily taste of mayo, but the deviled eggs are so good here I would have no problem eating at least half a dozen of them. Warmed up with a generous slice of bacon is probably the best way to serve a deviled egg. The brussel sprouts were also very tasty. In many ways, the seasoning reminded me of what you would toss fried calamari with. I would recommend this whether or not you're a fan of brussel sprouts. The only real disappointment I had from Marlowe was the pork chop. At $27, the second most expensive item on the entree menu next to the steak, I thought the pork chops would be a good bet, as it was also recommended by many Yelpers. Unfortunately, the pork chop did not deliver. The pork chop didn't even look like your traditional pork chop, rather, it looked like a cross between pulled pork and ribs. While I was certain that I was eating pork, the pork lacked any flavor and was very forgetful. I wouldn't recommend getting it. The burger on the other hand, tasted delicious, especially with the mayo aioli and bacon that the burger is topped with. While Marlowe is a good date place, I wouldn't actually come here again because it seems like the menu hasn't been changed in a very long time, and the selection itself is fairly limited.", "author": "Austin W."}

I think we might have thrown some elbows when the burrata came out--stupid good.  The dining room is much smaller than I expected, making for a super cozy and family-style environment.  \n\nMy favorite things: the deviled eggs (we ordered 2 or 3 ROUNDS), the burrata, the shrimp (good heavens--the sauce it comes with! spicy deliciousness), the polenta (there are no words, it has truffle...), poulet vert & the strawberry dessert.\n\nSame owner and executive chef as Park Tavern, another favorite.  I will return many times and hopefully soon..", "author": "Lola C."}

Inside was stark, but inviting, and sat at the bar. Drinks and bartender were good, but the \"burger\" which I heard so much about was overseasoned and very salty. As if kitchen didn't trust the meat. It also came out cooked differently than I would have classified what I ordered. However it was far from the best burger in SF, let alone anywhere. Definitely not a $200 lunch for 2 when you factor in drinks, app & tip. If you are going to be so highly regarded concerning a specific item, and that your server steers you to it, you better deliver. Disappointing and not in a way I'd want to give it another try.", "author": "Joseph S."}

They have a short, but decent, selection of wines and beers to delight in before the main event. Noise levels were lively, but still allowed for good conversation, as we sat at a long communal table next to other diners.\n\nWe started with the signature brussel sprout chips, bone marrow, and steak tartare. The tartare was my favorite of the three, having a delicious mixture of herbs and spices. Even members of our group who were not sure of eating raw meat enjoyed it. The bone marrow was left to us more adventurous folks as it was served in the bone, but was quite good. The brussel sprouts were an indicator of how the rest of the food would go: salty.\n\nSalt is a great ingredient when used in moderation. Unfortunately the cook at Marlowe this evening had a salt-heavy hand. It did not seem to matter what anyone at our table ordered, it was all overly salted. Pork chops, steak, \"poulet vert\", all just very salty. It is quite odd to me why you'd bother getting high grade meats only to douse them in so much salt the flavor of the meat was hidden. Even the desserts, both the chocolate pudding and strawberry ice cream were covered in salt.\n\nI'm giving three stars because I really liked the vibe and the options on the menu, but I cannot get past the salt. Maybe if I visit again I can get a chance to change my mind, but that's where it stands for now.", "author": "Graham O."}

Not sure why...was the burger smaller, did they change the recipe, or has my palate changed that much?\n\nAnyways, I do like the new location, because it is roomier.  Service is solid.

Anna Weinberg and Jennifer Puccio give us a warm and comforting restaurant that also has style and most importantly, delicious food. What goes in your mouth is what this restaurant all about.  Customers are treated like they are guests at someone's home being welcomed to a good meal, not food groupies needing to be impressed. You get courtesy, comfort and respect here. The location is also great for a pre-Giants game bite or post happy hour dinner.\n\nI'm a big fan of beets and their beets and burratta dish is something i'd probably never get tired of eating.  The dill, basil, mint and Aleppo chili oil provide layers of flavor that allow you to experience the dish in a number of different delicious combinations.  The crispy brussels sprout chips are not just hype.  They are seasoned perfectly and fun to munch on while enjoying a cocktail.  The red wine porcini jus on the steak frites is a great alternative to a more common sauce b\u00e9arnaise. I only had one bite of the Marlowe Burger, but it was enough to know that it will be my next order when I return here.  Finishing off my meal with the upside down peach crisp with bourbon ice cream and brown butter caramel sauce was wonderful.\n\nSimply delicious food, as all restaurants should strive for.", "author": "Luis M."}

Between Michael Bauer and every food blogger who has visited SF in the past six months, the hamburger at Marlowe has achieved quite a deal of attention.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself: first of all, we were running late and they graciously held our table for an extra ten minutes.  Quite a feat given the size of the restaurant.\n\nI started with the brussels sprout chips and my wife had the sweet corn soup.  The soup was better than the chips by a smidge, but both were outstanding starters.  My only complaint with the b sprout chips was that I reached my saturation point with those salty, lemony, savory little buggers about halfway through the portion.\n\nOn to the mains.  My wife ordered the lamb, which was cooked perfectly.  The only complaint from her was that the ricotta & parmesan dumplings were not all that great.\n\nThen...the burger.  Yes, I ordered the burger medium rare.  it arrived perfectly stacked: no bacon drooping over one side, no messy lettuce mound, no cheese squirting out the side.  Almost picture perfect.  And the flavor was astounding.  The horseradish aioli complemented the beef and bacon, the cheese had flavor, and the shredded lettuce- at first thought, a stumble step- actually ends up being a benefit.  From my perspective, a big leaf of lettuce simply provides a slippery surface that can send your burger squishing out the back when you take a bite.  Shredded lettuce solves this.  Yay, I say, for shredded lettuce.  I'm a convert now.  I \"get it\".\n\nThe burger was perfectly cooked, with just enough juice dripping out the back of the contraption as I ate.\n\nAnd the fries?  Well, they are too often an afterthought when presenting an excellent burger, but they are fantastic at Marlowe- not greasy, just enough salt...top notch.\n\nFor dessert: pot de creme.  Very, very excellent.\n\nAnother bonus was the availability of carafes on the wine menu, so those of us who normally blast through more than a glass of wine can be set up in an affordable way.\n\nThe only real bummer (which, along with the parmesan dumplings) was that we arrived just as a \"best of\" Billy Joel CD was beginning...and continued to play...for the entire...meal.  Now, I'm ok with SOME Billy Joel, and my wife pretty much hates him.  So a complete mix CD of all Billy's hits put a bit of a crimp in the vibe of Marlowe until the CD changed.  C'mon, folks...mix it up a little.  I'm pretty sure 45 minutes of Billy Joel is more than enough for just about anybody.\n\nBut those two issues are minor, and certainly not enough to keep us from returning from Marlowe for the burger alone.\n\nThe service, by the way, was excellent, friendly, and efficient.  Absolutely no complaints.", "author": "Ben G."}

It's not that great of a burger--a little underseasoned and lacking in any punch or \"wow factor.\"  \n\nSo why the 4-star review?  First, the service was excellent.  The hostess was very apologetic for making us wait and hooked us up with some champagne, gratis.  Second, the appetizers (brussel sprout chips, bone marrow) and fries were also really good.  This is a tough call, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt--that they had an off night or that I'm just a total burger snob--and would definitely come back.

I made a reservation on Open Table for a Monday early evening dinner. Got there at 6 pm and my reservation was not listed. Turns out I had made it for the wrong week, but luckily it was still early and the hostess provided me with a table for our group. The place was smaller than I expected so be sure to make reservations.\n\nHad the deviled eggs and fried brussel sprout chips to start. Very good eggs, especially with the slice of bacon on top. The \"chips\" were unique and surprisingly quite addictive. Two of us got the burger and the other two got the grilled niman pork chop. The burger was actually pretty good. No ketchup necessary. Soft bun. Fries were only ok. Was it the best burger? Eh, not on my list, but it's definitely in my top ten. Nevertheless, I will have to come back and give the chop a try since my friends described the pork chop as \"ridiculous.\" I wonder how it matches up to Nopa's pork chop. My meal ended well as I had the strawberry and rhubarb crisp for dessert. It was served in a jar and covered with a brown butter caramel sauce.

After our drinks finally arrived, our waitress came back over and we placed our order and she proceeded to ask if we wanted anything to snack on in the meantime.  At that time I reminded her we had placed an order for brussel sprout chips.  \n\nOur food then came out about 15 minutes later and we had not received the brussel sprout chips.  We told the food runner to please cancel the order, which he said he would take care of.

I was pretty pumped to check out this eatery especially after looking at the menu and reading the Yelp reviews, but I am going to have to disagree with the majority of people here.\n\nThe place itself was cozy and had a cool vibe, the only downside was the massive bar angling through the middle of our table which made it hard to see or converse with the person across from you (this would only be a problem with a large group seated in our location, don't worry).\n\nThe wine list looked decent and we got a couple of bottles of wine.  Service was attentive but not overbearing until the end of the meal.  I will get to that later.\n\nWe started out with some appetizers; the brussel sprout chips were good but a little too greasy for my liking.  The fries were good but nothing special.  What really had me salivating though was the pork chop that people had been raving about.\n\nWhen it arrived I was disappointed.  They had cooked it all the way through when I had specified medium.  I alerted them to this and they quickly took it back and cooked another one for me while assuring me they would not charge me for my meal.  It was returned a little less well done but still definitely far from medium, I decided to not press the issue and started thinking about the quality of their meat and the fact that they might be scared to cook it medium.  Now I enjoy a well done pork chop as well but this one just did not wow me. Maybe NOPA spoils me.\n\nTo wrap the meal up the bill comes and they charged me for 2 pork chops!

When I went, my husband and I shared 3 apps: the roasted bone marrow which was rich and flavorful, the deviled eggs which had a great creamy texture paired with delicious melted cheese and bacon on top, and the baked oysters which were unique with a layer of clam chowder and breadcrumbs on top. For my main I ordered the burger. I was really excited because I heard from multiple people that it's one of their favorite burgers in SF. Beside the fact that they use a horseradish aioli, I found the burger to be quite ordinary. The bread was toasted but kinda dry and flavorless, the meat was cooked well and juicy but that shouldn't be praised, and they used common toppings like lettuce, onions, etc. I had a bite of my husband's salmon and again, just okay.\n\nI was sad to have started my dinner with such high hopes to be disappointed at the end. I wouldn't get the burger again, but I would like to go back to try more apps and maybe one of their desserts; which are served in these adorable jars.

We arrived on time and were promptly seated. What I immediately noticed and liked about Marlowe was how low-key it looked. It was in a very quiet part of SOMA and I felt like I was going to a secret location for dinner. Another observation I had made, was that the restaurant was really small. The mirror on the back wall really gave me the illusion that the restaurant was much larger. Even though our table was sandwiched between two other tables, with about two inches of space in between, we still felt cozy and at ease. Lights were dimmed, giving it a very warm and intimate ambiance. Wooden chairs and tables gave it a very rustic feel. I really have no complaints about the overall environment and decor--it was nice!\n\nWell anyway, let's get onto the food. We ordered the brussels sprout chips, Marlowe burger, and grilled Niman pork chops. I really liked that our waitress gave us the option to share our food. Our burger came, cut in half, and on two separate plates! The pork chop also came out, cut in half. They were so accommodating and thoughtful! \n\nWe ate the brussels sprout chips with our hands. I've never had anything like it. The chips were a little on the salty side, but tasted great. There was a hint of broccoli aftertaste, so I assume they fried the brussels sprout with broccoli or broccoli oil. The hint of lemon was a refreshing addition to the very salty sea salt! It was definitely a fun snack. \n\nThe pork chop was just okay. It just wasn't as succulent and tender as other chops that I have tasted. I did love the ricotta bread pudding though, it was so comforting and delicious.\n\nThe best part of the meal, however, was the Marlowe burger! It was the most amazing and most well prepared burger that I have ever tasted! No joke, no sensationalism going on here! The combination of cheddar, bacon, caramelized onions, and perfectly medium rare beef melted in my mouth with every bite. The horseradish aioli added a great kick and the fries were amazing! I really wish I had the burger to myself. Why did I have to share?! \n\nPrices are fair, granted the location, and customer service was excellent. The Marlowe burger was a whopping $13, but it was so worth it! I will have to find some time to come back!", "author": "Lien T."}

However, I'd advise against large parties over 6 since the venue is quite small and intimate(not a bad thing, but don't roll through with 10+ heads expecting a good time).  They also do make good use of the space and I think with people seated, its rather comfortable with good lighting and great industrial feel decor.\n\nWhile I was waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, I got to try some of the beers they had, which were a good selection.  Unfortunately, nothing on tap, and its all bottled.  No hard liquor either, just beer and wine.\n\nI ended up having a San Diego IPA (I think I've had before, but its your typical California IPA with a good hop) and something out of the norm, a Czech Republic dark lager which tasted like there was a choclatey aftertaste.  Definitely liked!\n\nAt the demand of the birthday girl, we had somewhat of a family style on the appetizers, and doubled up on the deviled eggs.....excellent call.\n\n-Brussel Sprout Chips - amazing.  Well worth the hype.  Crispy yet light salt and buttery coat\n-Deviled Eggs - these were divine.  Great flavor, and spices to make it stand out from your typical deviled eggs.\n-Mussels and Calamari Spread - interesting and tasted good\n-Crab Louie Spread over lettuce - delicious\n-Steak - cooked in buttery goodness.\n-THE Burger - this was fairly good.  With the aoili sauce it was a nice touch and the fries were amazing.  I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't put it up to the hype and with the joints like Roam or the burger at other places like NOPA, it doesn't get too far ahead of these.

Anyhow...back to the food.\n\nI have yet to try the burger even though everyone raves about it and a friend of ours swears their polenta is the best polenta EVER.  The reason I have yet to try these two other highly recommended dishes is because I\"m absolutely in love with their Stuffed Sole - stuffed with blue crab, baby turnips and a bit of heaven. The dish is surprisingly light. You feel completely satisfied but not heavy after the meal.\n\nTheir service is so awesome - we ordered the roasted bone marrow as an appetizer, we hadn't been waiting long for it but the hostess lady came to our table and apologized for the delay.

We came with a party of 11 with reservations on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. We checked out some other yelp reviews and wanted to get the bone marrow and our party noticed that other people were ordering it so it probably wasn't on the menu. We requested the bone marrow and the waitress told us that since we're in a large party, we get a limited menu which excluded all of the best stuff - the bone marrow, scallops, duck liver, cod, and probably more. I found it really frustrating. So if 5 parties of 2 showed up, they would get a regular menu but in a party of 11, we don't? That's totally not okay. \nAside from that I had the burger, super tasty and the fries reminded me of the old burger king fries which I really liked. It is really rich and fattening but it was enjoyable. I would also recommend the baked cauliflower, it was deliciously cheesy!\nThen the bill comes along with a mandatory 20% gratuity and on top of that there is a required sales tax on gratuity. Basically we had a bill of like $360, add the sales tax, then add gratuity, then add sales tax again and the total was about $470. What???\n\nTo top it off, where you sign off on your credit card, there was a little spot for \"additional gratuity\".

I had made the reservations 4 days before and all I found was a 9:45pm. I was a bit unhappy with the time, but a colleague of mine said to just take it and that it's worth it. So I took it and learned that you SHOULD get a reservation before coming here to avoid the long wait. \n\nThe reservationist called the day of and confirmed my reservation. I asked for an earlier time and they said they'll call me back if something earlier cancels. Fifteen minutes later, I get a call for a 7:45pm! I was so happy so that's one star for them!\n\nWhen we got there, the seating hostess greeted us and showed us to our table. One downside to Marlowe is that it's a small restaurant so the tables are all close to each other, enough where you can listen to their conversation. We started with some wine that I brought and some brussel sprout chips. It was nice that corkage was only $20, and they waive the fee if you buy from their list (FYI).\n\nSo let me talk about the food:\n\nBrussel Sprout Chips: delicious! Great snack if you're health conscious. But then again, its coated with sea salt, oil (might be olive, not sture), and a hint of lemon zest. Ask the server how they make it and they'll be more than happy to tell you!\n\nMussels and Calamari w/ toasts: it was a bit salty, but then again it was completely different from what I expected. The calamari was not your typical breaded calamari. But overall it was a great starter.\n\nDungeness Crab Souffle: yummy! It was nice and fluffy, almost quiche like. I could probably eat this every day.\n\nMarlowe Burger: everyone on Yelp raved about the burger so I had to try it. It was definitely a great burger, but there wasn't anything about it that is like OMG I HAVE TO HAVE THIS DROOOOOL type of thing. I got mine medium rare, but personally it was a little too rare. I really liked the fries. It was the right crunch and the right amount of potatoes inside. Don't get me wrong, the burger was great, just not OMG great. \n\nWe also had two desserts, but I forgot what they  were called. One was with panna cotta and coffee and one was the chocolate creme pot. Both were great, I personally liked the chocolate one just cause I love chocolate and I like the texture of the cocoa nibs contrasting the smooth, velvety feel of the chocolate creme. I also enjoyed the panna cotta, but I'm a chocolate girl ya know?\n\nI would have given Marlowe 5 stars, but one thing that kind of bugged me was our server. The service was great and everyone was more than willing to help you but our main server was kind of rude. When he gave us the menu, five minutes later he came back and asked if we had any questions. I felt he didn't take the time to engage with us and make us feel welcome. Another thing was when I asked if he can take a picture of my friends and I. He took one with my camera and then my friend asked if he can take one with his iPhone. The server sighed and said \"Really? You already have one on her camera.\"  I know he was probably trying to be funny, but it just seemed kind of rude. \n\nAnyway, I'll definitely try Marlowe again especially that their chicken burger is one of 100 things on 7x7's Big Eats 2012.", "author": "Danna D."}

A meal at previous restaurant in this space, South Food and Wine Bar, would have been the perfect opportunity to finally break that spell.  Unfortunately it shut before I had a chance to (I blame the gazillion other awesome restaurants in SF), and along came Marlowe.\n\nIt still took me almost a year before I finally set foot there.  \n\nNot only that - I've also had enough of hearing friends raving about the infamous brussel sprouts chips.  Seriously? My memories of brussel sprouts is one of mild repulsion - it's only served once a year during the fam's christmas lunch for a good reason: neither my brother nor I would touch them (and oh, it's also not fun eating such a heavy christmas meal with turkey, gravy, ham and mashed potatoes when it's 90 degrees and sunny outside).  \n\nBut I had to make an exception on this one - sure, it still tastes very brussel-sprout-y (i.e., mildly bitter), but it was super crunchy with random burnt bits, and the salt and lemon did make all the difference.  So I found myself ordering a second helping of these surprisingly tasty nibblies.\n\nNext, the Marlowe Burger.  On top of friends' major raves, I've also seen it featured in any articles that talk about SF's best burgers.  Again, collective intelligence works wonder.  It definitely is one of the best burgers I've had: plump juicy patty, awesome fries (try putting a few just under the crown and eat them together with the burger), caramelized onions and horseradish aioli.  I ate all the  900+ calories of it. \n\nAnd as if the caloric holocaust caused by the burger wasn't enough, I had to also have the TCHO chocolate cream pie - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0WpyZFR3EoEBKcoY2LZ3Q?select=YP4vpJZlwS0L18WWLVhuCg - having sea salt as one of the ingredients, as I learned from a recent visit to the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena, is a brilliant idea as it opens up the taste buds so the sweet from the chocolate becomes more intense.   \n\nFrom now on Marlowe will be my Soma's dining destination of choice.

First impression was the great service since I had a 10pm reservation online through open table but decided it was way too late, so I called in to see if there was an earlier time and managed to get one at 8:30pm which is perfect. \n\nFood-wise, we had to go with the brussel sprout chips for appetizer. Honestly, it does live up to its craze. The brussel sprout were peeled leaf by leaf and fried till crispy perfection, seasoned with sea salt and lemon zest. I really wished I had these in abundance at home so I can munch on them all the time without feeling guilty. We also had the bone marrow with salsa verde served with grilled baguettes. It was spectacular, in a sense, much better than the bone marrow appetizer I had at Morimoto. Bone marrow gets really rich after some bites but the salsa verde cuts through the fattiness really well and balances out the flavors. \n\nMain courses: I had the dungeness crab stuffed sole that was served with a shaved fennel salad. My friend had the special which was a crab and shrimp louie served with lettuce wrap, sea salt and hot sauce. The sole was really filling, wished it had a bit more acidity to it. The louie was a fun, hands-on dish as you get to wrap the mixture in the lettuce wrap yourself and add in salt/hot sauce. We also had our dinner with their cocktail specials which all had very interesting names but were also very very thirst-quenching. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my dinner. Great, casual atmosphere. The menu selection was limited so it's not somewhere I would want to go to once a month, but definitely from time to time with friends.", "author": "Kelly C."}

All the rage about crispy brussels sprout chips here reeled in my adventurous self and the boyfriend. Wouldn't it be fabulous to live in this area and be walking distance to all kinds of culinary jewels such as Marlowe AND AT&T park? Yes, yes it would be. We came here for a dinner date before the game and ordered the aforementioned brussels sprouts, roasted bone marrow, pork chops and an upside-down strawberry crisp for dessert. You'll find pictures of each dish that I posted. This was truly a 4-star experience considering the quality of food, service and overall atmosphere. The bone marrow was the best. Whoever came up with the idea of serving a $2 wholesale price bone marrow at an upscale place for $15 must be a millionaire. It's so simple and yet tastes so good. Here, they fleur de sel-ed it beautifully and added a nice salsa verde topping on the side. You really can't mess up bone marrow, but it's challenging to bring it above par, which Marlowe undoubtedly had done. The brussels sprouts were very addicting, aside from olive oil and sea salt, I wouldn't be surprised if they added crack in there. Although it had a bitter after-taste, the initial bite itself was amazing. This is the first place I have ever been to that cooks pork somewhat rare. First of all, more places should do this. Second of all, maybe not because it implies that the pork has to be of first grade quality, which is not available to all restaurants. It was tender, juicy, flavorful and slightly gamey, but delicious! Finally, dessert. Holy crap. Homemade gelato with caramel and strawberry crisp. What a great way to end the meal.

They called me back today at 9:30 am to confirm the reservation.  Wow, that is customer service, which is rare these days.  We arrived a bit early, and they noted that our table would be set up soon.  We were promptly seated at 1 pm. \n\nIn my quest to settle the debate, where could you get the best fried chicken sandwich (Bakesale Betty's or Marlowe), I came here just to try the sandwich.  I also got to eat half of the deviled egg sandwich, which by the way is a genius idea for a sandwich.  The fried chicken sandwich definitely delivered with the buttery bun, bacon, and quality, crispy fried chicken.  Eaten alone, the fried chicken was just heavenly.  However, I unfortunately haven't settled the debate even after eating the sandwich...The sandwich here is your \"classy chicken sandwich, and it is $13.\"  The other is a $9 chicken sandwich with cole slaw instead of bacon.  However, you have to cross the bridge to get it...So the jury is still out.  \n\nA small tip would be to order the french fries instead of the salad (it comes with the sandwich).  The salad seemed like the same greens from the Costco mix with some like olive oil based salad dressing (seemed more like a filler to me).  Beware, they ask if you want something (e.g., brussel sprout chips) making it sound complimentary, but really it costs.  **I learned that from some Chinese restaurants that ask you if you want tea, and you see the charge on the bill.  Also, they try to up-sell beverages here.  These are just minor observations so that you could be an informed consumer.  It doesn't take away from the delicious sandwiches.

However, the service was great, decor is lovely and the burgers really are amazing! It's not a cheap burger joint though. The burgers were the perfect size for us but for the price may be a bit small. We enjoyed it though and it was the perfect amount of food; we cleaned our plates. We also got the spiced prawns - delicious! I will say that the beer is over priced! $6 for a 12oz beer (Session Lager). Yikes! I would say they should at least have a happy hour on drinks - it was expensive for a burger and beer 5:00 dinner!\n\n\nWe love the concept though and have been to Park Tavern - also good.

Tried the burger which seemed to be a popular choice; however, it was quite disappointing as it failed to measure up to the hype. Bread was dry and too flaky, and burger itself was too greasy. This was not a good burger, at least not one to rave about. \nOh, did I mention that I found a hair in my burger after the second bite?! I would have been more disappointed had the burger been delicious but given it was barely mediocre, didn't care to get the same thing again. I informed our waitress who immediately agreed to swap my dish, and which to my understanding, would be compensated by the restaurant. Wasn't seeking a free dinner (just a yummy one) but after recalling the grossness, I thought it was suitable. Returned the burger and ordered the scallop dish - wish was quite delicious. It almost made me forget about the prior-disappointing and gross burger encounter. \nFinally time to leave; we get the check and the replacement was not compensated. I was surprised but enjoyed the new dish so made no big deal. Although...I did wonder why it wouldn't be important enough to satisfy a customer after what occurred.", "author": "Lu L."}

We figured that must be a pretty good sign that Marlowe is well-enjoyed. The atmosphere is very dim and romantic, with both bar seating, communal tables, and tables for two. \n\nWe split orders of the Marlowe signature burger and the Chiogga beets salad. The beets salad was great! It was definitely on the skimpy side, with just a few pieces of mustard greens, beets, watermelon bites, and candied walnuts + blue cheese bits. However, the quality/combination of flavors compensated for the quantity. I definitely would recommend this salad, but NOT as a main solo entree. The Marlowe burger was on-point. Although it was ALSO on the smaller side (looked like a burger on a diet, hah), it was cooked to our liking - medium rare- and still very juicy! The fries were just okay, nothing to write home about.\n\nWe saved our bellies for dessert, too! We ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta Affogato, which was the true winner of the night.

Our wine was delivered, along with menus and we read them ravenously while sipping our wine.\n\nMy dining partner settled on a medium rare burger and a side of brussels in butter, while I, who grew up in the midwest, where pork RULES, decided on the pork chop. For a teaser we ordered the duck pate (yes, I know, not at all PC) but SO DELICIOUS!\n\nIn fact, everything we ordered was out of this world. the pate, served with mustard seed and cherries was delicate and smooth and melt-in-your-mouth delicious atop the cruncy crostini.\n\nTHEN our main courses arrived. The burger, which was perfectly cooked with a generous portion of blue cheese atop, was accompanied by the perfectly seasoned and proportioned fries (oh, you know the type...when they're thin and crunchy outside with just a bit of soft potato-goodness inside...delish!)\n\nMy pork, however, stole the show! Accompanied by a spinach BREAD PUDDING, the tender, crusty, blackened-on-the-outside pork fell off the bone and melted deliciuosly into the tangy arugula and prosciutto bed that accompanied it.\n\nThat is until we ordered dessert - upside down peaches with bourbon ice cream covered in salted caramel sauce, at which point my eyes rolled into the back of my head and I had to be escorted away from the table to my car, lest I die right there from too much perfection.\n\nA++", "author": "sara jane m."}

I used to go to Marlowe when it was the old space, smaller, cosier, attentive. I was just there for lunch with a client in the new location, bigger, more wait staff etc, and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. It was a busy lunchtime and our waiter seemed more concerned with his other tables than with us for some reason...maybe we are not blond enough? Not sure. We asked for our wine no fewer than three times and only saw him go and check on the order after our third request. The burger was more bread than beef and unappealing, and I could have done better at in/out burger. This is my fourth time even at this new space, and I have to say I have two words-downward trend. As a business owner I know complacency is the kiss of death. You are suddenly trendy and bustling, but dont forget what made you good. Great food and attentive service. I live in the neighborhood, but unfortunately will not be coming back. Rule #1, customers will eventually vote with their feet and dollars. The Aussie girl hostess is awesome, but I find some of new wait staff have that attitude you will recognize in the city these days, the \"you are lucky to be eating here and I am serving you\" attitude, more east coast than SF, that is taking over the city.\n\nPlenty of friendly, very good and warm choices in SF.

Hillstones on the Embarcadero is shockingly good and hearty, with top quality ingredients; an oldie but goodie- waiters actually anticipate you- imagine that? I keep going back because I KNOW its going to be good.  Reservations easy at both places. I would give Marlowe a miss- no value, food meh..", "author": "Mischa M."}

My party and I arrived at 9:30 but were told that our table wasn't ready.  We order a carafe of wine while we waited.  It was probably a 15 minute wait until we got our table.  The hostess was so apologetic for the wait and gave us the table of our choice.  When we were seated a complimentary appetizer, crispy brussel sprouts, was sent to our table.  I love great customer service!\n\nOur waiter told us about the specials and we ordered two of the appetizer specials, one was a spin on a crab louie and the other a mussel and squid mixture served with a garlic aioli  sauce.  Both were served in tiny mason jars and fantastic, althought the mussel and squid dish was probably one of the best things I've put in my mouth this year.\n\nMy bff and I split the Marlowe burger. The burger was juicy on a nice soft brioche ( i think) bun... my kind of burger- simple.\n\nI had an amazing experience at Marlowe, great food and service. My only thing was they only have a wine and beer license and I really was craving a cocktail but the waiter suggested some pretty tasty red wines.\n\nI can't wait to come back and I just figured out I can take the 45 bus here!

Maybe it was because I went in not knowing what to expect (besides a good burger), but this place really knocked my socks off.\n\nAfter a dayhike to Wildcat beach near Pt Reyes, my friend and I decided to reward ourselves with a burger and fries.  After tossing around Burgermeister and Burger Bar ideas, we settled on Marlowe, as I'd heard raves about it during my Umami Burger research.\n\nI didn't have a change of clothes, so I rocked my cargo pants into Marlowe, and I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb, but no one really cared (I hope).  Luckily there was no wait (I've heard the line can get quite long), and we sauntered right up to the bar. \n\nI didn't realize this was such a nice place, as I just figured it was a burger joint (given that I'd heard about it spec. for the burger).  If I wasn't deadset on a patty btw two pieces of bread I would have branched out and ordered something more fitting...the chicken is supposed to be amazing, and all the descriptions made me salivate.\n\nIt was tough to decide, but we finally got the dungeness crab souffle and brussel sprout chips for an appetizer.  The former was incredible, more quiche-y than souffle-y in my opinion, but the crab flavor was hearty and rich.  The latter was equally impressive, lightly crisped and flavored with a salty/sweetish flavoring, and absolutely delectable.\n\nWe ordered two burgers (much to the chagrin of our server, haha) and MAN OH MAN, arguably the BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE.  If you haven't tried a burger medium-rare before, I highly recommend it, as it is a life-changing experience.  The beef that they use is high quality, and this patty was perfectly medium-rare, not a hair more, like you get at a lot of other places.  All the ingredients were immaculate, and blended together into a perfect bite...as soon as I sank my teeth into this sucker I was in heaven.  And how can you beat a side of fresh horseradish?\n\nFries deserve a shout out too, as they were perfectly fried, but the real star of the show was the burger.  Possibly better than Umami (although I'd have to do a side-by-side comparison).  Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive, and knew his shit.  I will absolutely be back, over and over and over again.", "author": "Michael C."}

I got the open-faced deviled egg sandwich rather than a safer/more boring choice like the burger, which I'm sure would have been good too.

Half of our party arrived a bit too early for our reservations and found that there isn't really much of a bar/waiting area for patrons.  We worked our way up to the bar which was fully seated with diners and managed to put in a drink order.  Only then did we realize there was a crazy homeless lady sitting at the bar.  She harassed and annoyed the guy next to him so much that he wofled his his dinner and asked for his check.   With her main target gone, she started to make small talk with us and then one of my friends felt her hand stroking his back.  After that, we pretty much bolted to the small area by the host stand once we got our drinks.  Props to the hostess who realized what was happening and kicked out the crazy lady a short time later.\n\nWhile the menu is simple, it has enough selections to satisfy most people.  We started off with a few appetizers including: oysters, steak tartare, and bone marrow.  The baked oysters were a little salty for my tastes, but the steak tartare and bone marrow were great renditions of the classic dishes.  For mains, the Marlow buger, steak and pork chop entrees were ordered.  The buger was good but not amazing as reviewed by Michael Bauer.  The steak and pork chop were both cooked just right and were both very enjoyable.  They comped us two desserts (carrot cake and some chocolate dessert in a jar)  since we had to wait a long time past our reservation to be seated, neither of which impressed me.  Both had a rather salty taste to it and I could not eat more than a small bite.   \n\nIf you are in a group of four or fewer you should have no problems being seated.  Any larger, you will have to wait for the communal table to open up or sit awkwardly at the over sized table by the door that needs bar stools for you to be at an adequate height.

A carafe is the perfect quantity and it comes in a visually forgiving open glass bottle.

Even though we had a corner table she never neglected to check on us, and was friendly without being overly so. The kitchen portioned our burger entree into 2 perfect halves when I informed our server that we'd be sharing it.\n- bone marrow appetizer. It's basically a bone cut in half from probably what used to be a huge animal, and the marrow inside is melt-in-your-mouth, fatty goodness. Spread it on your bread. It spreads easier than butter.\n- location is right across from the Caltrain. It's very easy to get to.\n\nBrutal honesty:\n- the burger was ok. If you like horseradish then get this burger, or ask for horseradish on the side if you don't. I wasn't blown away by it. The bun was boring.

Unfortunately, waiting until the last minute to make reservations meant that I could not get a table for 8 at my usual go-to fancy joints.  So I looked on SFGate's Top 100 list and started perusing the menus.  Marlowe's menu jumped out to me.  I could not find a single item I did not want to eat.  Even better, they were very accomodating about making last minute reservations on a Thursday night.\nSo, we showed up.  The room was dark, not too loud but not too quiet and the decor was industrial.

It's quite loud and there's not really any place to wait inside without being in the way.  I checked in with the hostess for our reservation and then stood waiting for quite a while.  I was a little irritated that she didn't communicate why we were just standing around, but eventually she explained that the patrons at our table had finished eating and had paid, but just wouldn't leave.  She offered that we could take a seat at the end of the communal table or wait for our table.

Marlowe was the choice this year.\n\nThe menu is fairly focused, with a few options in various menu categories: appetizers, \"pots,\" snacks, soups/salads, mains and sides. We ordered a variety of appetizers/small plates as well as an entree each.\n\nWarm Deviled Egg aged provolone, pickled jalape\u00f1o & bacon - Served warm, the eggs were complemented primarily by smoky, crispy bacon and a mild provolone. I didn't really pick up any of the pickled jalapeno, but this was still a good bite or two.\n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips lemon & sea salt - Lightly crispy with smoky charred ends, these were quite tasty...though some pieces were a little oily. Because they were so thin, the leaves/chips quickly became soggy in any residual oil. Some lemon provided a nice touch of both citrus and acid.\n\nWe also ordered a few \"pots\" served with crostini/lettuce.\n\nWarm Marinated Mussels & Monterey Calamari grilled country bread & green garlic aioli\nDuck Liver Mousse roasted Medjool dates, pickled mustard seeds & crostini\nDungeness Crab & Rock Shrimp Louie gem lettuce, eggs mimosa & tabasco\n\nOf these three, I liked the crab and rock shrimp Louie best. The seafood and lettuce cups  felt light while having quite a bit of flavor, particularly with a splash of lemon or tabasco. I thought the mussels and calamari pot was difficult to eat on the crostini, with the small pieces continually falling off the toasted bread. The duck liver mousse was a good one, with the rich minerality playing well with the sweetness of the dates.\n\nGrilled Niman Ranch Pork Chop spinach & ricotta bread pudding, prosciutto & parmesan cream - My grandmother got this entree. Very juicy and quite flavorful, this was an excellent chop. A little bit of a smoky flavor was present too, adding an extra flavor profile to the pork.\n\nMarlowe Burger caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli & fries - Ah, the much anticipated burger. The meat was cooked a nice medium-rare, though it wasn't quite as thick as I anticipated. The meaty flavor was there, with a really good smoky char on both the meat and toasted bun. However, I thought there was too much bread (the bread:meat ratio was high) on an otherwise good burger. Overall, disappointing given expectations.\n\nCertified Angus New York Steak Frites red wine- porcini jus - A good steak, tender and flavorful. It was cooked right on point, and the red wine-porcini jus was quite delicious as well. The fries were the same ones that came with the burger - crispy yet fluffy, pretty good fries. Perfect for dipping in the jus. A simple dish; this was very satisfying.\n\nTCHO Chocolate Cream Pie Graham cracker & chocolate cookie crust, cocoa nib, sea salt\nVanilla Bean Panna Cotta Affogato Amaretto & lemon biscotti\n\nWe were trying to save room for later, but a meal is not complete without dessert, right? We opted for these two choices, one was fine and one was very good. The chocolate cream pie had the expected chocolate flavor with some nice crumble textures. Nothing special. I thought the affogato panna cotta was more exciting, with the creamy panna cotta doused in a shot of espresso. The bitterness of the espresso countered the sweet vanilla panna cotta quite nicely - addicting!\n\nMarlowe was good. I can't say anything was special enough for me to return though. Of all of the dishes we ordered, the burger had the highest expectations and fell short. However, the other plates were executed fairly well with the pork chop being the standout entree.

I'm giving Marlowe four stars because 1) the lighting was a bit dark for my tastes and we struggled a bit to read the menus, 2) I was disappointed with the crisp, 3) a full bar (beer and wine only) would be a nice enhancement, and 4) the pescatarian selections were limited.\n\nLove those brussel sprout chips!", "author": "Jay C."}

The food was not a great value for the price, and the wine certainly wasnt. \n\nEdited to add: The service was excellent, and I suspect they would have taken back the glasses if I had asked, but I think while Marlowe is ok, they miss the mark to be someplace where a table of four should be dropping over 200$ for dinner. \n\nProbably wont be going back.", "author": "Gayathri K."}

But this time I was already a little bored with the menu to help the memory of the long wait stick with me till the end. And I wasn't the only one to feel this way... My companions came from the south bay to have dinner and the wait was almost as long as their drive! \n\nSo the chicken was, as always, very good.

We opted for a later 1:30pm reservation so that we could catch up and boy, did we ever!!  We shared the brussel sprout chips (delish and low carb, yay!) and we each got the Marlowe burger (yummy and only $12!) and finished with the chocolate cream pie in a jar for dessert.     The dessert was the only thing I wasn't entirely impressed with.  I love the jar concept but it was just a little too salty for my sweet loving tooth.   \n\nThe second time was part of our SF Food Tour, stop #3.   The three of us shared a plethora of menu items.   The brussel sprout chips,  Jerusalem Artichoke soup, Spiced Prawns, Classic Steak Tartare, Baked Oysters, and the Marlowe burger again.   I prefer raw oysters but if you like them baked and cheesy, these will fit the bill.  Our table attendant was awesome!

Day 2 of this raw food diet is making me crave their burger BIG TIME!!!!\n\nI loved their elderberry prosecco drink, perfect mix of tastiness. The brussel sprouts chips are an absolute must have as are their warm deviled eggs. The bacon in those deviled eggs are calling my name!  Alas, as soon as the star of the show arrived - the brussel sprouts were pushed off to a dark corner of the table and sadly forgotten. This burger is definitely something to write home about...juicy, tender, perfectly cooked...crispy in the right places and amazing.

And you can go for a walk after dinner in the park behind the station before the scheduled Caltrain arrives! \n\nI wanted to try the Marlowe burger, so of course I ordered this.  The Deviled eggs and Crab louis were good but not the highlight for my evening.  The burger certainly was solid - pretty scrumptious patty on a toasted bun.

Loved it.\n\nFirst, when my fiance and I came in for my reservation, the hostess was busy and these rude people walked right in front of us, trying to play it like they came first.  When she finally had a moment, the hostess graciously asked them to move aside because we came in first. They, of course looked put out seeing that their plan was foiled. I have no idea how she knew, since it seemed like she was elsewhere, but I took that as a sign that this was to be a memorable meal.\n\nThe food and service were standouts.  Our waitress Sarah was extremely helpful with opinions, yet not overbearing.  She checked in often, in spite of the full restaurant.  We got the brussels sprout chips, baked oysters, little gems, greens gratin, and brown butter sprouts.   If you're going to get ALL of those, I'd cut back, probably on the chips (if you're getting the burger, because the chips are essentially like fries), but THAT'S IT.  Everything else is buttery delicious, especially the gratin.\n\nFor entrees, we had, of course, the burger like every other freaking person, and I got the polenta.  THE POLENTA IS GORGEOUS, SUBTLE, YET EXPLOSIVE all at the same time.  At first you may think, \"wait, this is bland . . . but then the mushrooms and truffled pecorino come in and you're like \"WHOA\" from  Bill & Ted's excellent adventure.  I know the whole soft poached farm egg is getting played, but this was  still a treat.  I feel like Marlowe is known for meat and people should know veggie is just as tasty.\n\nFor dessert we got the carrot cake and choco pie.  My fiance thought the pie bordered on salty, I thought it was PERFECT.  So beware, know you're chocolate +salt level.\n\nI got pretty drunk because we had 2 carafts of wine (the sauv was my favorite) and a cocktail. The cocktail was probably unnecessary, but solid nonetheless.\n\nAll in in, a great restaurant.  I don't think I have to say anything about the burger because it's all been said.  It CAN be expensive, but also be cheaper if you'd like (I saw a lot of people order half burgers).  \n\nThey do food that's comforting, yet feels new and exciting.

But then I heard about the brussels sprout chips and had to try them. \n\nWe showed up when they opened at 5:30 and got a spot at the bar. The restaurant was fully booked. Service was friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant. \n\nFirst up were those brussels sprout chips. They have a flavor of lemon zest, are not over salted, and were fairly crisp. They were really good, but they would have been perfect if they'd been a bit crisper and a little less oily.\n\nSecond was Little Gem Salad with avocado, market vegetables and citrus vinaigrette. I liked all the different vegetables, which were sliced into thin strips, and everything tasted fresh, but the vinaigrette wasn't particularly delicious. The avocado had been mashed or pureed, and also was oddly flavorless. \n\nFinally, we had the much-vaunted burger. It comes with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese melted on top, and a disc of bacon. On the plate there is also a side of fries and some horseradish dipping sauce. \n\nThe burger is fine, but didn't wow me. I found it a bit too thin to be really juicy. We both agreed that the bacon was superfluous and just made the burger too salty. It may be that they've salted the burger and should just cut that out so that the bacon doesn't overpower everything, but as it stood, I thought the bacon was detracting. And it's not as if I don't like bacon. The burger at Chop Bar in Oakland comes with bacon, and it is fantastic (still my top-rated burger in the bay area). \n\nThe fries are excellent: crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I prefer my fries to be made from peeled potatoes because usually the peel doesn't get as crisp as the rest of the potato and ruins the feel, but in this case everything worked fine. \n\nThe horseradish aoli was not strong enough on horseradish, I thought. \n\nAll in all, Marlowe seems like a very good restaurant, and I would give it 3 1/2 stars if that were possible, but it just isn't quite delicious enough to get 4 or 5.", "author": "Jacob L."}

Beforehand, I tried to make a reservation for 6 and Open Table just wouldn't allow it. I called and learned that I could get a reservation for 6 people, but we would be seated at a high pub-like table with bar stools. No problem. \n\nWhen we arrived, I realized why obtaining a reservation was so difficult. This restaurant is small. The footprint accommodates 8 individual tables plus one long bench style table with seating for about 6 on each side plus the high bar table I mentioned previously. I don't consider this restaurant a good option as a spur of the moment choice. \n\nOn to the food. We started by ordering cocktails and a couple of glasses of white wine. Each one of the white wines was equally disappointing. They both lacked body and tasted as if the bottles had been open for several days. For dinner we learned our lesson and ordered a New Zealand Pinot Noir. I highly recommend this wine. It was the perfect compliment to the wide array of different dishes that the group selected. For the most part everyone was satisfied with their entree choice. The folks who ordered the poulet vert were rewarded with an overly generous portion size. No one finished it. I wouldn't recommend the sole entree, even with the crab Louie stuffing, it still tasted bland and unimaginative. In retrospect, I should have ordered the rib eye.

It is close to my office and the food is pretty good but the service always drives me away and I am not high maintenance.

Today our waiter was in such a hurry, no idea why, they were not crowded. He spewed through the specials like it was an auction, so okay we will order off the menu. Then when we both ordered a glass of wine that was the same kind he said, \"Will you be getting a second? I can get you a bottle\". We said no, there is no discount on a bottle so we will just decide if we want a second glass. After that he sped away from the table like a rocket saying he was getting us a bottle. We had to call after him to repeat, no bottle. Then there was the clencher, I saw him at the bar pouring the wine and then pouring from one glass to the other if a millimeter went over the logo they put on their glasses to decide what a pour should be, how tacky is that?

It was ok that the reservations were for 11:45 since I had class at 1:20 (for which I ended up being late, and then, as punishment, my prof made me sing in front of the class).  It was a lovely walk from the Hall, and we were able to chat.\n\nOnce we got there, we strolled past some very well respected suits with the phrase, \"we have reservations.\"  We were sat by the window.  It was cramped in that oh-so-hip manner.  Luckily there was no one at the table adjacent because I would have had to flash my bottom at them as I got in.  \n\nUnbeknownst to me, there was the dine about town menu in full force.  Cleverly, Marlowe had the insight to put their burger on it.  Because everyone loves the burger to begin with, and if it was not on the DAT menu, there would have been a raised eyebrow.  \n\nAnd for the appetizer, there were two choices: artichoke soup with creme fraiche or little gem salad.  I got the soup, Liz got the salad.  Both were delicious.  The salad came on a large plate where 4 small romaine leaves were lovingly coated in deliciously tart dressing.  Something about smashed avocados.  But it had carrots.  The soup was velvety and smooth as bisque.  It was topped with a beautiful dollop of creme fraiche and some slivers of fried something tasty.  \n\nI got the burger and Liz got the shrimp sandwich.  Her sandwich looked lovely!  The shrimps were braised and peeled.  They were huge and pink and firm.  There were many of them.  It was not a skimpy \"lunch\" serving, it was a fully stuffed, non-fried shrimp melange of tasty, colorful ingredients.  \n\nThe burger was....eh.  It looked beautiful.  I asked for it rare and it was delivered rare.  The center was just the way I liked it.  But the accutrements were distracting.  The shredded lettuce did nothing to add to the texture.  If anything, it made the burger feel more like a piroshiki than a gourmet burger.  The sauce, mayo, gooey, moist stuff was overwhelmed by the burger juices.  As someone mentioned, the meat was not allowed to rest so everything was presented like a pregnant sow.  \n\nThe fries were beautiful.  Gorgeous.  Effing Fantastic!  This was the highlight of the meal.  BUT.  Would it cost that much more to make the serving just a little bit BIGGER???  Is the whole of the budget going towards the burger that some fries must be sacrificed for the cause?  Puh-leeze.  I hope the side of fries was bigger for the price they were asking.  \n\nFunny story: when I asked about the salad and whether the carrots can be removed, the waitress said that the chef was very picky or particular about the way the ingredients were put together and they would be unable to accommodate a request for no-carrots.  As a result, I think I was afraid to ask for the burger to be de-constructed with out mayo or other greasy secret ingredients.  She made it sound like the chef would come out and personally yell at me for my boldness.  \n\nI'm sure this place deserves a higher rating.  But I was unimpressed with the burger.  It might have been the DAT, it might have been something else.  I will give this place another try and thusly adjust the rating.

Granted, I haven't eaten much outside of fast food meals lately, but this place reminds me of what makes a dining establishment truly great through the basics of service, food, and ambiance. \n\nFood:\n\nAppetizers\n-My girlfriend and I ordered a total of 4 plates (2 apps, 2 entrees). We started with the famous bone marrow and baked oysters. While I've heard much about the bone marrow, the oysters were quite the surprise. Never have I experienced such purity in oyster flavor, letting on to the freshness of ingredients (a recurring theme of the night) and the skill of the chef preparing them. The fact it tasted like oyster chowder on the half-shell didn't leave much more to be desired from the dish. \n\n-In between stuffing our faces with the delectable little mollusks, we were also thoroughly enjoying the little bites of creamy bone marrow over the wonderfully smokey slices of toasted bread. The only gripe I had with this was the size expectation of the dish. It looked a lot bigger on yelp =\\ \n\nMains\n-I was stuck between a rock and a hard place when deciding between the pork chop and the scallops, but my logical side told me to balance out our meal with a bit more seafood, so I opted for scallops and....well, sometimes logic sucks. I was actually satisfied with my scallops; juicy, tender, succulent, more or less cooked to perfection with no hint of fishiness, the ingredients were fresh and masterfully prepared. However, I'm not particularly a fan of capers...in the last bit, so despite how wonderful the scallops were, I wasn't too fond of the capers accompanying them. Adding insult to injury, the gentleman a table away from us received 3 orders of the pork chop, so when the smell wafted over, I grew jealous....oh well, there's always next time.\n\n-Hands down the highlight of the night, ironically enough (because my gf jokingly suggested we go to a fast food burger place for my birthday instead), was the hamburger - medium rare, of course. It looked deceivingly simple. A no-frills bun. No-frills lettuce, no frills cheese with an unassuming set of fries to accompany the almost generic-looking burger. After cutting it in half and handing me one of the two pieces, spreading some horseradish on the bun and taking a bite, I was hooked. Suddenly, the loud chatter of background noise turned into trumpets and angels sang. Then I quickly took another bite and it was even better as I got more of the medium rare patty. This burger is almost life-altering, made even more impressive by how unassuming it looks.  Honestly, I could live an abandon warehouse ridden with trash and stained by bodily fluids, but I would not give two shits if this burger was in my grasp. It's that good. 5 stars just for this!\n\nService:\n-The already delicious food was certainly enhanced by our server that night. I don't recall her name but her wine recommendation in regard to the foods we ate that night was accurate to what she claimed and I thoroughly enjoyed my Gruner white wine. I guess the only downside, err moment of comic relief was when she first showed up and spilled water on me as she explained the beverages of the night, but I lived so no biggie. \n\nOverall:\n-Great middle to upscale casual atmosphere\n-Good, simple food.\n-Friendly and helpful service people\n\nHopefully next time i remember to get the pork chop as well as a burger entirely for myself...possibly as the appetizer.", "author": "Nick C."}

I've tried to find the recipe online, I've watched Jennifer Puccio's video where she makes it multiple times, etc... I think I'm close, but what I want to know is how the herbs stay so vibrant and how do they continue to cling to the chicken so well?

I like these better than hog island cooked oysters. \n\nBurrata salad with peaches (in the summer)/ Little gem salad- The salads are sparse, but so pristine and fresh. Recommended. \n\nBrussel Sprouts- Addictive. Definitely not healthy, but you can order them and pretend to be a little virtuous. \n\nBurger- Oh no. This is the one dish that I don't think I love as much as everyone else does. I've had it twice, I want to love it, but there's just not enough contrast in flavors and textures to me. If I'm going to eat something fatty and soft, I want something sharp, crisp and maybe a little sweet. The fries that come with it are amazing though, as is the aioli, and the restaurant cooks the burger to order perfectly. However, when I want a burger, I'm not coming here. Maybe I just have bad taste in burgers (I don't like Zuni's either).\n\nDesserts are uniformly amazing. The little chocolate pot is my dessert splurge when I have one.", "author": "Julia K."}

We had the brussel sprout chips, deviled egg, and gem salad for starters and split the poulet vert for our main. The brussel sprout chips were as commonly yelped very delicious. Strong lemon flavor, reminded me of potato chips after a while. The deviled egg had an interesting combo of flavors with the jalapeno but pretty pricey at $2 per egg I believe. The gem salad was a medley of root veggies tossed in a light citrus vinaigrette, pretty refreshing. The main course was delicious with tender chicken falling off the bone and a simply divine sauce. It got quite salty by the end of the meal hence the 4 stars. Overall a really convenient location near the caltrain, not TOO expensive ($60 for the two of us splitting one entree and a few apps). Would love to try the burger next time.", "author": "Joyce H."}

The roasted bone marrow was truly a heavenly experience and is a must-have.\n\nI loved this place and will definitely check it out again.

Ordered the chicken sandwich, which was good. Didn't really stand out, but it was a solid (if overpriced) sandwich and probably not super representative of their entire menu. The service was good and the space is pleasant, so there is not a whole lot to criticize. But, there are probably 20 brunch places in the city that I would find basically interchangeable (the decor, the menu, the crowd, the price) so I wasn't blown away. Still, it may be one of a kind in the not-yet-entirely-gentrified area and will very likely satisfy those who are excited to discover a new place to \"brunch\".", "author": "Oliver M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-07", "description": "OVERALL: Get the brussel sprout chips and burger!  Skip the TCHO chocolate dessert. \n\nAMBIANCE: Inviting, intimate, dim lighting, a bit on the loud side (I had to speak in louder than normal volume but not shouting), reasonably priced. Two tops, a communal table, small bar.\n\nFOOD:\n-Brussel Sprout Chips: I thought these would be round fried brussel sprouts.  But they are brussel sprout leaves (?), individually fried.  You don't taste brussel sprout flavor, just sea salt, meyer lemon. Texture is crisp w/slight chew.  Greasy, oh yes!, but that didn't stop me from devouring the basekt.\n\n-Baked Oysters: $3/each.  Delicious.  Would have ordered more but wanted to save room for the mains.\n\n-Burger.  Tasty, comes fully assembled.  In my opinion not nearly as good as the juicy pefection at Spruce. Fries w/aioli were good. I don't recall there being bacon in the burger, although the menu says there is.\n\n-Pork Chop. This thing was huge.  Came with these \"crispy parmesan dumplings\" which I thought were similar in texture to chickpea fries that One Market.  In any case, they were delicious. The pork chop I had seemed to have a ton of fat on it. Maybe that's the way it always is. (I don't eat pork chops that often).\n\n-Dessert: some chocolate thing in a glass jar.  It was ok, I would skip this next time. TCHO chocolate something other (pot de creme?) with cacao nibs, but tasted just ok to me.  I wished there was something more cakey on the menu.\n\nTHAT CORNER TABLE:\nLike a couple other yelpers mentioned, there is a 2-top in the corner.  Debateable whether this is a good table (can peoplewatch the entire resto) or bad (you are staring directly at the table in front of you, so when you talk, you're essentially talking to that other table.).  Can be a bit awkard.  Your call.", "author": "Caroline I."}

We had to wait for a table, and were served wine as we sat outside on a bench near the entrance.  We took a corner table and ordered a feast! Our eyes were clearly bigger than our stomachs.  Of the many items I tried, the steak tartare and the bone marrow were my favorites.  Also part of the fun was getting to know our waiter and the people around us. The restaurant has a friendly, kind of New York-ish atmosphere. \n\nHowever, right before dinner, a friend told me she had recently been there and found the food to be salty. This stuck in my head, and I found it to be true, but I still very much enjoyed my meal there. \n\nFull disclosure - I selected Marlowe over other options because I liked the font on their menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-30", "description": "Man, I love this place.  Yes, the food is delicious, market-driven, and unfussy but the real reason Marlowe holds a special place in my heart is my two year old willingly ate his first bite of Brussels sprouts here.  My tiny, carb-loving, self-imposed vegetarian (who hates vegetables) wolfed down a plate of Brussels sprout chips faster than Joey Chestnut gulps down a barrel of hotdogs.  I have to wipe away a tear as I type this...\n\nSince it's located right behind the Caltrain station, I've always wanted to come here with my rugrats for our bi-monthly family dinner in the city.  I was hesitant to do so since it didn't seem particularly kid-friendly when I dined here a couple months ago.   However, I was determined to make a go of it with the kids last Tuesday.  Don't worry all you kid-haters, I made sure our reservation was early and I was armed with snacks, iPad, and bribes.  Who knew that it would be the hottest fricking day in history and Marlowe doesn't have A/C?  Despite the heat, no melt-downs from anybody (me included).\n\nEven though the menu is small, everything I've ordered has been really yummy.  This time, the four of us split the Brussels sprout chips, burrata and peaches, little gem salad, roasted bone marrow, Marlowe burger, spiced prawns, and seared halibut.  My favorite was the little gem salad - perfect, crisp greens with paper-thin shaved roots, al-dente baby veggies, dollops of creamy smashed avocado, all of which was lightly dressed with a balanced vinaigrette.   The Marlowe burger is delicious and my 5 year old proclaimed it the best burger and fries he's ever eaten.   On a previous visit, I also really liked the steak and poulet vert.  Damn it, I guess every thing I've had is tasty!\n\nIf you are bringing kids, please note that there are no high chairs (there are boosters) and the tables are really close together.  Plus, you will most likely be seated next to a young hipster couple who will be shooting dirty looks at you for bringing your kids.

Maybe another veg to cut it? Something. Food like polenta, in my book, should be a staple and should be easy to eat in large quantities!

Parts of it definitely stick to the bone\n\nSole Stuffed w/Crab: Delicious! It's light but oh so good!\n\nGrilled Porkchop w/ Parmesan Dumplings: Loved it. And I especially love the smokiness from the grill. Definitely had a strong scent to it since I think there was some type of vinegar w/ the apples, but still really good. Loved the dumplings too!\n\nUpside Down Pear Crisp: originally I wanted the lemon souffle, but the table next to us thought it was a bit to tangy, so then I wanted the TCHO chocolate cream pie, but they had JUST ran out. sadface. So we ordered the pear crisp and it did not disappoint! I love that they come in little jars so it's more like a broken down version of whats listed on the menu.

I knew from the minute I arrived that this was the restaurant for me. Right outside on the window are quotations from chefs and the best one was \"VEGANS NOT WELCOME HERE.\" At last I am at home.\n\nMy homegirl and I took a look at the menu and we were immediately excited and ordered up a storm: bone marrow, brussels sprouts chips, and the pat\u00e9 (special) just to start. And we ate it all. (Especially because I just came off the plane from LA and purposely starved myself for dinner.)\n\nI know that I'm going against the grain, but I wasn't really into the brussels spouts chips. If anything, it reminded me of fried seaweed sheets (the ones you can purchase from the Korean market). :\\ But the bone marrow and the pat\u00e9? DAMN GOOD. The pat\u00e9 really made my night; it was served with two condiment/sauces: a mustard seed sweet-n-sour and a cherry chutney 'dressings'. \n\nNow for the best part - my entree: polenta with mushrooms and arugula. ALSO DAMN GOOD. Rich and flavorful. Hmmm. \n\nMy homegirl got the burger and it looked just as delicious my meal. The burger reminded me of something from Father's Office (for any LA-ites out there).

I didn't book well in advance, but I got a 9pm reservation for Thursday Jan 20th. When we showed up to this tiny place, it was still packed. Unfortunately, the bar was full. so there was nowhere really to get a drink. This was my biggest minus for Marlowe. Inside the interior was very well done, butcher shop meats renovated factory.\n\nNow onto the food. We started with the brussel sprout chips, which were really interestingly done, not at all what I had expected. I think that these must be fairly difficult to make. Portion size could have been a bit larger, but good for 2 people.\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Steak Tartare, which was excellent. The poached egg was fresh and I was asked to crack it to prevent further cooking. The overall dish had a bit of a kick to it, so I was pleasantly surprised by the spice, but I wouldn't label it CLASSIC. I paired this with a GSM blend from Unti in Sonoma, CA. One of my favorite value wineries and was very happy to see it by the glass on this list.\n\nOnto the main course, I decided to go with the Stuffed Blue Sole after having red meat for my starter. The sole was cooked to perfection, I hate when places over cook fish, I realize this becomes more complex when you stuff it. The combination of flavors was excellent, salty and sour. The texture from the sole, crab, celery root, and fennel were wonderful and well integrated. I paired this with a glass of Pinot Noir from Corkscrew in Sonoma, CA. This was recommended by the waiter, he said that this was essentially declassified wine from another good vineyard and that this 2007 vintage was a great value. I happen to agree on the Price:Quality ratio. No room for dessert, the sign of a great meal, but I was tempted with a glass of Monbazillac, the poor man's Sauternes, as I like to call it. \n\nOverall Marlowe was a great experience and I will be going back there on my next trip to SF. It's casual, a good small menu that is very well executed. The wine list was better in terms of bottle selection, but they had a few interesting by the glass wines to let people experiment.", "author": "Robert V."}

I had the steak frites, which was cooked to a perfect pink medium.  Both came with crispy fries.  We also ordered a side of the smoky cauliflower gratin.  Now THAT was delicious.  The cauliflower was not cooked to the point of mush.  It was still a little crunchy, and covered with provolon and cheddar cheese.  Hot, melting, gooey goodness.\n\nAs someone mentioned, the food here is on the salty side.  We ended up refilling on water several times through the meal.

The plate comes out with two gigantic bones cleaved in half, and a little spoon to scoop out the marrow onto toasted bread with a little salsa verde. I was a tad disappointed - the salsa overpowered the marrow, so it tasted like oily salsa verde on crunchy toast.

The staff were extremely courteous (and might I add CUTE), and they had a decent wine/cocktail program happening. \n\nThey also let you offset corkage fees if you buy a bottle in-house off their list, so that's a nice little bonus if you're like me and my friends and like to bring in bottles of nice wine to a meal.\n\nA simple and minimal menu really lets you focus on your meal, rather than plying you with so many options that you have a hard time making choices. \n\nOh, and the desserts were nicely portioned, and very yummy - again, the dessert menu wasn't overburdened with options, which made picking one easy, and which seemingly allows their staff to focus on quality.\n\nSince I work down the block from them, I think I'll be trying their lunch menu as well - Marlowe definitely warrants a second shot.", "author": "Marco M."}

We were lucky since we arrived just around 7p. While there were no tables just yet, we only had to wait about 20 minutes before getting a spot at one of the 2 long communal tables. So we were a little close to our neighbors and eavesdropping is certainly possible, but who cares right?\n\nWe started with beverages - I was lured by the Australian Ginger Beer ($4). Very nice, not overly strong ginger taste. Not sure why it needs to come from Australia though.\n\nAppetizer: Brussel Sprout Chips ($6) seasoned with hints of Meyer Lemon and sea salt. Each baby leaf was fried up crisp (no batter) and seasoned. They were a little oily to the touch but great flavor.\n\nMain: We both had our own Marlowe Burger ($13) topped with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, bacon, and aioli with some sprinkling of fries. Mine was cooked perfectly to medium rare with the pink center. This is one of those burgers where you shouldn't deconstruct it, meaning if you're a girl like me, and sometimes I like to take the top bun off since it's too much carb to consume, well, it messes with the balance of salt to bread ratio. You definitely need all of the bun to cut through the savoriness of the cheddar and the bacon. It was good but a bit much for me. \n\nThe fries were fantastic though. Firm and crisp on the outside, with some skin left. Love it.\n\nSide: We actually opted for a side of Creamed Seasonal Greens ($8). It was more like a veggie gratin - baked with parmesan, garlic and bread crumbs. It was not creamy dairy as you may imagine but more dry but still mushy but in a good way.

The atmosphere is intimate, the service is very attentive. But really, let's get down to the important stuff, what I ate. My favorite thing to eat at Marlowe is the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, it is a gem and the best chicken sandwich I have ever had! The breading is salty, crispy and amazing, the chicken is juicy and the whole thing is topped with greens tossed in a lemony Caesar dressing, delicious crispy bacon, and a garlicky mayo spread on a fluffy light bun, YUM-myyy for reals! Seriously best chicken sandwich ever, sorry chick-fil-a! Then on the side are some salty crispy fries and I like to accompany this meal with their bottled lemonade. It's a really satisfying lunch.  So much so I have never been able to order anything else off the menu!\n\nThe burger at Marlowe is pretty famous and I had a bite of my boyfriends, and it was very very good as well.

But it fell short.  \n\nThe good: both appetizers were great.  Both desserts were good.  My boyfriend's entree, the Marlowe Burger, was excellent.  The restaurant is well decorated and organized.  The price was as expected: $88 for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 1 beer, 1 coffee.\n\nThe bad: First, our waitress (20-something Caucasian w/ dark hair and tattoos), while attentive, was not friendly.  The waitress next to our table chatted and joked with her customers.  Ours did her job, but was cold.  Second, I ordered \"poulet vert\" as an entree because the waitress recommended it.  The menu neglected to mention that the main seasoning for the sauce was olives.  I HATE olives.  So I only ate the inside where there was no sauce.  \n\nThe vibe of the place is good, so if the waitress just stepped it up and the chef added \"olives\" to the menu description, Marlowe would be awesome.", "author": "Melissa A."}

Yes, the burger is delicious and deserved of all the \"best burger in SF\" accolades. Fries and aioli that are served with the burger are awesome too.\n\n2. The other food is quite delicious as well, including the gem salad, soups (usually cream of something), spiced shrimp, bone marrow app, veggie au gratin (varies depending on season) and pork chop.\n\n3. It's small with minimal decor; in other words, it's not \"nice trendy\" like a Perbacco or a Prospect or a Town Hall, but more \"neighborhood trendy\". \n\n4. It gets hot inside, so it's perfect during the winter but very, very stuffy on nice days. I understand they are working to fix this.\n\n5. It's very loud inside.\n\n6. They only serve beer and wine (they always have fun Prosecco special \"cocktails\" that are quite tasty), and there is usually only one person working the bar, which is why bar service may be a little slow at times.\n\n7. The owners and most of the staff are SUPER nice and will go out of their way to accommodate you, with or without a reservation. I think this is why you may have to wait sometimes even if you have one, because they're trying to figure out the optimal seating situation for everyone (they get a ton of walk-ins from neighbors like me). \n\n8. It's probably not great for a big group dinner. I said this about the restaurant even when it was it's former reincarnate South, and has more to do with the space than anything else. \n\nHope this helps. I personally adore Marlowe and I think that a lot of the gripes have more to do with expectations than anything else.", "author": "Veronica S."}

Everything was good, or very good, nothing was extraordinarily good.  The famous burger was fine, about as good as any, but as long as the meat is rare and the bun is not stale, I'm happy.  The tartare was a treat-just the right amount with the right add-ins.  \n \nBy the time we wobbled out (we ordered many glasses of wine) the chilly black-and-gray room was abuzz with hungry hipsters, and the crowd of desperately texting couples spilled out into the street.  \n\nIf Marlow were in my neighborhood and not riding the \"restaurant of the moment\" trend, and was a bit less hectic in the evening, and the ambiance was relaxed and casual like the menu, I'd give it 4 stars, but there is a schism between the experience, the menu, and the prices that just don't add up somehow.\n\nOK...the lemon souffle cake in a jar was TDF.

Luckily it was not a game night and we were able to find parking right on Townsend. \n\nWe ordered the brussels sprouts chips and bone marrow for appetizers, and the burger and scallops for dinner. The BF does not llike brussels sprouts at all, so i was shocked when he started gobbling all the chips down! The lemon gives it a great tang and it was totally delicious. I loved mopping up the bone marrow with the bread, but I did wish I had more bread though. The BF and I shared the burger and scallops, and they had split the burger (and fries) onto two plates for us. I actually didn't mention that when I ordered so it was a really pleasant surprise. The BF have been hearing/reading about the hype on this burger for a while, so he was really excited to try it. Unfortunately it did not live up to it's hype. The burger was actually lukewarm when we got it, probably because they were waiting for the scallops. The scallops, on the other hand, was amazing! The scallops were tender and sweet, and the bacon wrapped asparagus, mushrooms and peas, and wine sauce was perfect with the scallops. \n\nFor dessert the BF had the chocolate cream pie and I had the upside down strawberry crisp. they were served in little mason jars which were the perfect size for them. I really enjoyed the strawberry crisp, which was basically just the bourbon ice cream topped with strawberries and crisp. The only downside for me is that they didn't have coffee, only espresso, and their espressos were incredibly strong. \n\nI'll come back again, just not for the burger.", "author": "Janny N."}

Or for an adorable orange clown fish.. like Nemo's little sister.\n\nThe tiny space that used to be South is now transformed into the new Marlowe restaurant. And by \"transformed\" I mean they changed the wall art and added some cheeky but cute quotation appliques to the outside glass pane.\n\nBut the cuisine... oh my. Definitely some thumbs-up transformations there. The boy and I were so addicted to the crispy brussel sprout chips with meyer lemon + sea salt that it felt like we were in a Hidden Valley commercial where everything was replaced by veggies- in this case, buttered popcorn became salted brussel sprout leaf chippies. Just marvelous.\n\nThe roasted bone marrow, although not an entirely new concept in many of SF's fine American New establishments, was well prepared and satisfying all the same. I had the Marlowe burger with carmelized onions, cheddar, and bacon- with a side of horseradish aioli + fries. The boy ordered the seared black cod with bagna c\u00e0uda butter (see below), spring veggies, and a side of spinach.\n\nA brief history on bagna c\u00e0uda butter, kids:\nIn the Piedmont region of Italy, eating bagna-cauda butter is a favorite ritual. The diners gather around an earthenware pot filled with hot olive oil, anchovies and garlic, and they dip raw vegetables or bread into the \"hot bath\"- a kind of Italian fondue.\n\nA hot bath of oil and garlic. Yes, please. \nPer usual, my writing is riddled with run-on sentences and digressions. Where was I?\n\nOoh, Marlowe. From our extremely attentive server to the sunny and friendly hostess, the staff at Marlowe was top notch. The ambiance felt casual and easy, but the noise level was rather high. When we went in for an 8:30pm Friday night dinner, the buzz level was just one notch below that of a typical bar/lounge. I was practically yelling across the table. Not terribly lady-like on my part.\n\nBut, other than the unusually high uproar due to Marlowe's small space and low ceilings causing the sound to have no place to escape, the food is well worth the visit.", "author": "Elaine T."}

There was a giants game and the place is close to the stadium so the crowds may have been related to the 7:15 game.\n\nAtmosphere: small room with seating for about 40 including a communal table. White and black tile floors, lots of mirrors, windows, a small bar and black ceiling make for a lively, convivial and somewhat light atmosphere. Place is close and crowded where you've got to move the table to get out of your seat.\n\nService: we were greeted promptly at the door and seated in a nice corner table. The place was pretty empty and they let us chose our seats. Service was very competent and efficient with regular water filling and quick clearing of the table so you do get the feeling you are getting moved right along. Service stayed good despite increasing crowds.\n\nFood: at 5, they are still serving their midday, very limited menu so we got Brussels sprout chips with lemon and salt, a glass of white and a black lager. The chips are the individual leaves of Brussels sprouts peeled and fried tossed with salt and lemon. They are very good, but also pretty greasy. You can really taste the lemon and we wolfed them down in seconds.\nOnce it was 5:30, we ordered our dinner. Starting with a beet salad with s smoked rogue creamery blue cheese and arugula; two deviled eggs and for mains hamburger and crab cake. Everything was good, but nothing was great. The burger is cooked as ordered and comes with a bit of heavy bun, slow cooked onions that were undetectable, lots of bacon and lettuce. The burger was good but it needed to be more burger and less bun.  It comes with a very small serving of parsley tossed fries that seemed to be double fried. They were good but fries are not where you should skimp, given how cheap potatoes are. The crab cake was very greasy but heavy with crab served with an unusual shaved celery salad and a creamy dressing, both of which were refreshing and quite good.  The beet salad comes with cubed, roasted beets and shaved uncooked beets, heavy dressing, a nice size serving of candied pecans and a very, very slim covering of blue cheese, which was a disappointment.  The deviled eggs were tasty with bacon and melted cheese they seemed to be broiled or something because they were warm. It's $2 per half egg, so they come steep.\nWe also ordered dessert, a chocolate pie, but its really chocolate pudding in a jar with a bit of Oreo cookie crust. Too sweet, to small and not flavorful enough. \n\nDrinks: we had a glass of wine and black lager. Both were good and when I described the type of wine I wanted the staff knew exactly what I should order.\n\nOverall thoughts: if you are trying to get in and out quick, this place works. It is not a relaxed dinner option, at least not on game nights. Portions seem small but the food is good.", "author": "Vivek V."}

But they do have valet parking if you do decide to take that chance, with 25 Lusk. \n\nCrispy Brussels Sprout Chips. With Meyer Lemon and Sea Salt. This was alright, though unique, it was slightly overrated. They had the natural bitterness of brussels sprouts, tanginess of the lemon and savoryness of the sea salt. I do wish it was less greasy, they made my finger so shiny and looking at the paper on the basket after we finished was scary.\n\nBaked Oysters. New England Chowder in a shell. Presentation was great, very clever to put it on top of a bed of sea salt. Taste-wise, it was okay. It was a little on the salty side so I couldn't really even taste the oyster at all, remind me, why did I order a baked oyster again if I can't taste it? \n\nMarlowe Burger (Half). With Caramelized Onions, Cheddar, Bacon, Horseradish Aioli, and Fries. Our server was kind enough to split it in the kitchen for us. The burger was alright though, got the patty cooked medium so it was more juicy, but I've definitely had better. Their patties don't have the fresh taste of nommy Niman Ranch Beef Patties. But still alright in my book. The horseradish aioli was pretty good, my friend who doesn't even like horseradish liked it a lot. The fries were really good too, even plain, the seasonings on it was noms.\n\nGrilled Pork Chop. With Crispy Parmesan Dumplings, Apples and Pickled Mustard Seeds. The pork chop was well cooked, but I was really full by that point so it could have been better than I remember. The parmesan dumplings were not my thing, I'm usually not a fan of parmesan and especially not fried, so I didn't really like this. It was way too rich for me. The apples were really good though, the sweet yet tangy flavor helped combat the richness of the cheese. \n\nLemon Souffle Cake. With Raspberry Curd, Whipped Cream and Lemon Zest. This was pretty good too. I liked the tangy-lightness of the cake, helped me feel a little less full than I was. I think it was the only dessert that could have fit into my stomach at that point. Though I must admit, Sutro's at the Cliff House would be a better choice for a lemon souffle, theirs is BOMB.\n\nTheir service is great and that is what bumped them up to 4 stars since their food itself is only worth 3.

The amount of tapanade and greens on the plate cannot be way more than the actual amount of marrow and what is the point of giving 4 pieces of bread when there is really only enough marrow for 2.  It was actually a plus and minus, but splitting the bone marrow in half is great for easy access but it also highlights the fact that there wasn't much marrow.  \n\nJust for reference:  For $11, you can get boneS at Bar Tartine served on their awesome bread.

For dessert (which really gives my rating a full 5 stars), we devoured the TCHO chocolate pot de creme with creme fraiche and meyer lemon curd cake with whipped cream. They were so good that we scraped both glass jars clean.\n\nThe timing of the food was perfect - a slow pace so that you could savor it to the last bite, but never a long pause in between so that out table with never without food. \n\nBe sure to check the butcher paper hanging on the wall for daily cocktail and wine specials. I tried both offerings - a blood orange champagne cocktail and a red wine - which I really enjoyed.\n\nI like that they kept the black ostrich banquettes that I clearly remembered from South, as well as the long communal table in the center, but still changed the look and feel. Try reading the quotes stenciled onto the exterior windows backwards - it makes for an even more entertaining dining experience.", "author": "Connie C."}

They were a bit busy, so they just had us sit on a shared bench and join with another party - totally fine, but some diners might not be keen on that.\n\nWe had several diners in our party, and we had the fried chicken sandwich, the signature Marlowe burger with fries, some had the burger with the mixed greens salad, and we also had an accompanying side of brussels chips.\n\nThe burger was very good - however, the portion size is large, and I wish that they had sliders. That would have been a perfect offering to enhance their appetizer menu, or for those of us who weren't so hungry. Brussel sprouts aren't hard to prepare, but to prepare them well is difficult. I felt the top part of the bunch was well seasoned (it comes with lemon juice, salt and olive oil) but the bottom was way too salty, and there were garlic clumps making for really potent flavors. Some of them were really burnt too, making for a very mixed batch. Also, at most restaurants, I feel an aioli or a dip of some sort is good to offset the saltiness of the brussels. \n\nThe server was not very proactive in attending to our table. However, the bussers were very overworked, but still managed to cater to our needs, and refill our waters constantly. She didn't tell us about the specials (which were listed on the wall) but we didn't notice until halfway through our meal, and we would have appreciated knowing about them. Wish they had more offerings on their menu.\n\nDown to come back and give them a second chance, but wasn't too impressed.", "author": "Tammy H."}

Perfect, fresh, tasty little leaves, pickled shallots, lemon vinaigrette, tossed just enough to coat every leaf, and a perfect dusting of smoked medium crystal sea salt.

We had their spicy jumbo prawns which were tasty, but the cocktail sauce tasted just like slightly more spicy cocktail sauce.  The eggs with tomato and chickpeas was not my favorite.  I thought it was too watery, and it was hard to take a \"bite\" of the dish when the sauce didn't stick to the chickpeas or the eggs.  We had the ricotta toast with kumquat, which probably ended up being one of the better dishes, but the crust was fairly hard making it difficult to eat without making a huge mess.

Both experiences were fantastic, from an ambience, food, and service perspective.\n\nThe atmosphere at this place is lovely.  It's like a cozy, modern brasserie with warm lighting. It was a fun place to go with colleagues for an after-work dinner yet it was also right for an intimate 3-hour dinner with a friend.\n\nAlso, I've fallen in love with brussel sprout chips.  I think I dreamed about them the other night.  I crave them.  \n\nI really must give a shout out to the baked oysters too, which have a beautiful combination of flavors.  I rarely taste baked oysters that don't taste more baked than oyster.\n\nSo far, I've had the burger (which I think rivaled my other favorite burger in the city @ Zuni) and the lamb. The lamb was perfectly cooked and just simply delicious.  It is so refreshing to go to a restaurant and have a dish that is done just right.  Not overdone or underdone.  And lamb is one of my favorite things to order.\n\nThe wine list is smart and well-studied by the servers.  I had a beautiful crisp South African brut to start and a perfectly paired red with lamb.\n\nThe service was attentive without being intrusive.  For a new restaurant, I was impressed with the pace and timing of dinner.\n\nI will definitely be back...need to try the cod next time.", "author": "Sean L."}

Headed there in the early evening, made a reservation on open table. Seating in close proximity but all in the spirit of trendy bistro style dining. The fried brussel sprouts were fantastic, as everyone has raved. They were on the oily side, however. I also enjoyed the baked oysters and loved the roasted bone marrow. The latter is difficult to present well - it is, after all, a single bone that's been stuck in the oven and roasted...there's nothing elegant or elaborate about it. It's the accompaniments that characterize a good roasted bone marrow, and Marlowe's was pretty good (if you are a big marrow fan and ever in Toronto, check out The Black Hoof). The bread wasn't as generous as it could've been, and no one wants to sit staring into a soupy pile of oil and fat waiting for another round of carbs for very long.

We tried that and apparently presented a bit of a problem for the staff.

Turns out our table was ready, so the hostess sweetly seated us right away. \n\nWe each had two glasses of wine, the brussel sprouts, burrata with radish, the polenta, and the burger. All the food was good, but my favorites were the appetizers. Bill plus tip came out to a bit over $100. A little pricey but not unexpected.\n\nWe were still talking, lingering over our drinks, about 2 hours later. Them giving us the bill was a strong hint they wanted us to leave, but we weren't ready. After more time passed, the hostess came and said she had people waiting for our table and, that if we moved to the bar, she would buy us a drink. It was a little awkward to grab our stuff and move because my sister was still drinking her coffee, but we felt bad for taking long so we moved. There wasn't space at the bar, so we sat at a long table near the bar. No drink ever materialized, and the hostess didn't approach us again. \n\nI understand it was Friday and that we were taking a long time. But don't promise a drink and not deliver!

Each is good in it's own right but bite for bite, I left Marlowe feeling most satisfied.  Here's the skinny (or fatty if you prefer) on what we ordered:\n\n- Started with the Classic Steak Tartare ($11) with poached quail egg and crostini.  It was perfectly done.\n\n- Ordered the Brussel Sprout chips ($6) to snack on while we waited.  These are a must have!  Light, crispy, tasty, and much healthier than fries!\n\n- I had the Marlowe burger ($12).  While it was slightly smaller than burgers found elsewhere, it made up for it in taste.  The patty was perfectly seasoned and juicy and the horseradish aioli added a nice spicy touch.  I had the seasonal greens which were fresh and lightly dusted with a delicious dressing.\n\n- She had the Warm open faceed deviled egg sandwich with pickled chili, bacon, and aged provolone ($9).  It was by far the best egg sandwich I've ever tasted.  The fries were the perfect crispy texture and came with the same horseradish aioli that was on the burger.  I don't normally eat fries but I couldn't stop stealing them from her plate!\n\n- The special drink of the day was a blood orange iced tea with mint ($5 for a caraffe) and it was just the right amount of sweet and minty to cut the meal.  Again, a must have.\n\nWe didn't have room for the deserts but saw some on the tables next to us.  They looked good!  We also didn't order any wine but I did peek at the list - great selections from all over the world as well as local wineries.  \n\nThe place is small (same space as predecessor South Food and Wine) but modern with clean lines and exposed steel beams, and somehow cozy at the same time with comfy booth seats around the perimeter and rustic wood tables to balance.

I honestly felt that there was nothing special about this drink, and a bit steep in price for just mixing two liquids together (way more of the juice than Prosecco). I wish I had just gotten a beer.\n\nFor date #2: I ordered a deviled egg, the little gem salad and green garlic soup. All were fantastic, and very well seasoned. The deviled egg had a small slice of bacon on it and was definitely one of the richest deviled eggs I've ever eaten - a great way to start a meal. The little gem salad was no wimpy salad. There was avocado in it, shavings of radish and lots of parsley. The dressing was a bit acidic, but overall a good new take on the little gem salad, which is on a lot of menus these days. The green garlic soup was also very good and well seasoned. It came with what I think was a mussel tapenade, which was definitely too salty, and I left most of it alone.

It is a meat place after all. I've had amazing polenta at Bottega in Napa and this just doesn't compare. At all.\n\nService: Not perfect, but good.

When my friend showed up, \"Carla\" said \"she's here!\" in the happiest of tones I've ever heard.\n\nOn to the food.  Whenever I see bone marrow on a menu, I must have it.  This one did not disappoint.  I really enjoyed the salsa verde and little herb salad.  It really did a good job of cutting the fat.  The wine \"Carla\" recommended also went very well with it.  I also very much appreciate it when the bone is cut in half, versus the traditional way.  It makes it much easier to get every little morsel of goodness out.  My friend had the steak tartare and it too was very tasty.

I really liked that the pork came with a piece of the rib.  It was all very tasty.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts, which I found to be funny.  They have their famed brussel sprout chips, and the hearts of those brussels are what's used for the side dish.  So it looked like brussel hearts.

Just about every street parking within the area is metered parking so keep a note of that and will gouge you if there's a game going on.\n\nThe hostess was very nice and accommodating, we waited roughly 15 minutes and sat at the bar/counter. We started with deviled eggs which were pretty good but I felt like that the bacon was overpowering so I didn't get much of anything else other than bacon and creaminess from the yolk.\n\nWe also got the crab cake which was excellent, the only thing I could ask for is perhaps a bit of sauce and even though the crab cake itself wasn't dry, it felt like that it could have used some sauce for a bit more moisture. It also came with a small citrus salad which was surprisingly good.\n\nWe both got the burger and it's probably by far one of the best burgers I've had. It was cooked perfectly with great buns to accompany it by absorbing some of the juices. The fries were also very good; crispy on the outside, a bit mushy on the inside. It also comes with additional aioli should you wish to put more on your burger or use it as a condiment for your fries.\n\nOver all, I had a great experience here. Service was great, food was great, the only gripe I have about this place is the parking but it is of no fault of theirs. Definitely see myself coming back here again.", "author": "Richard C."}

Once you get to charging THIRTEEN DOLLARS for a burger, you have to wonder whether it is, as Un-named Chronicle Food Critic feels it is, in the running for being the best burger in town. Unfortunately, the Marlowe burger has a problem of grease overload, especially when you add in the fries that come with the burger. Each fry feels supersaturated with fat, like it's made out of foie gras or something. Foie gras is delicious, but one can only eat so much of before feeling funny!

She lives a couple of blocks away, and had wanted me to try it.  We went to brunch the first time, and we shared the burger and the chicken sandwich.  The burger was amazing, one of the best I have had.  Not too big, great smokey grilled flavor.  If I lived nearby, wouldn't be a good thing :).  The chicken sandwich would have been almost as good, but I really think they needed to change their fryer oil.  I had a weird fishy taste to it.  It was crispy and moist, just shouldn't have tasted like fish.\nThe second time we went, we went late on a Sunday night.  We weren't looking for a big meal, so we shared the burger again, and tried the chicken fried okra and browned butter brussels sprouts.  Being Southern, I was excited to see fried okra.  It was good, and had an almost creamy texture to it on the inside.  I would fry it a little more crispy and brown than they do, but I still liked it.  Brussels sprouts were great, small, tender and nicely browned and crispy.  We also just ordered a couple of beers. And I think maybe that was a little bit of our waiters issue.  We didn't order a $50 bottle of wine, or a large meal.  I think it irked her a little.  \nMy reason for taking off a star is the waitstaff. While they have all be nice, the tend to hover too much.  I don't know if they are really trying to turn tables that fast, and really want to get you out of there. But on our last visit, I really didn't appreciate our plates being ripped off the table while we were still eating. We had to ask for our fork back so we could finish.  A simple \"are you finished?\" would have been nice.  Since it was late, and empty tables nearby, the only thing I can think is that she was in a hurry to get out of there.\nWill definitely be back, but I hope not to feel liked I'm being rushed out again.\nOh, and the place is really loud.

We walked right in-our reservation was at 9pm and were seated promptly. The owner (can't remember her name) was so gracious, through out the entire meal and was so accommodating. \n\nWe started off by ordering the Spicy Prawns in Hot & Boozy Cocktail Sauce and the Little Gem Salad. And out came the Crisp Brussel Sprout Chips and the Baked Oysters! The oysters were the best baked ones I've ever had, with it seemed like a gratin. All the Yelpers have been saying to get the Brussel Sprout Chips and they were great, but about half-way through they were just too salty. I love how with the Little Gem Salad, there is almost a guacamole in the middle-you could almost eat the leaves like chips, if you were feeling particularly daring. Equally daring, is the Spicy Prawns with the heads. It certainly does keep the flavor in-the dipping sauce was completely not needed-but you won't find me suckin' on brain just yet.\n\nI guess our waiter put in \"Polenta\" instead of the \"Poulet Vert\" that I ordered, still workin' out the kinks.

This place packs them in, so you'd be best to reserve a spot, if you come anytime like happy-hour time.You can always take a chance or just settle up to the bar and dine there. But when we were there we got lucky (not _that_ lucky) because a reservation had just been cancelled. Boo yah!\n\nThe bartenders and wait-staff were totally awesome hooking us up with seating --- especially for the late-comers and then hooking me up to some pretty tasty non-alcoholic beverages. That was a special touch rarely seen I have to admit. And the burger that I had ordered medium-rare arrived juicy, succulent, perfect. I can't say much more than that. Except that whoever was dj'ing the music was also doing a stupendous job with the old school R&B. Sweet.\n\nAnd no I haven't tried the brussel sprout chips, in my zest to try the burger, I didn't really pore over the menu. I just found out about the chips thing like two days ago. So I've got to go back for that and to get another perfectly-made burger.", "author": "Jen A."}

The Spiced prawns and Steak tartare starters were both delicious.  The tartare was probably the best version of it I have ever had.\n\nAnd then the main dishes came.\n\nThe seared black cod was perfectly prepared but was dwarfed by the polenta.  I am not usually a big polenta fan, but for Marlowe's version, I would do cartwheels down the street.  The combination of greens, truffled cheese and egg with the smooth and creamy polenta was divine.  Yes--divine!!\n\nService was very good--attentive, friendly and prompt.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?  The place is loud.  The house was full, and it was necessary to shout in order to have a conversation with someone who was seated right next to me.

The restaurant was new-ish in the neighborhood, and we had been on the lookout for a quiet place with great food.  I had the parsnip soup.  Now, a huge pet peeve of mine is when restaurants fail to describe everything that will be on a dish.  A good example, would be sour cream on Mexican food.  I believe that if you are going to put something on a plate that can change the flavor of the entire dish, it should be stated.  Thus was the case here.  I don't like creme fraiche, and there was a big dollup of it in the soup.  When i brought this to my waitress's attention, she immediately brought me another bowl of soup, sans the creme fraiche.  She also said that they would start including that on the menu going forward [and it appears they have! :)  ]  The soup was delicious! The texture was smoother and consistent throughout.  My dining partners thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well, which included a shrimp salad that was beautifully presented with heads on, accompanied by a brightly colored endive and cabbage salad.\n\nI would definitely come here again if I'm ever in the area.", "author": "Lacey H."}

They served us complimentary champagne for our patience. Which was great. :D\n\nWe had the sweet corn soup, baked oysters and roasted bone marrow for starters. The soup was delicious, creamy, soothing, mild but tasty. The bone marrow was good but it really isn't something we would order again. The consistency was kind of off - jelly like not creamy. The taste was decent.\n\nI had the Poulet Vert. Delicious. The portions are very generous for this plate. I got a thigh, wing, and breast - generously served over tasty vegetables. I was almost full by the time I cleared half of my plate. When I finished the meal I was very satisfied.\n\nMy boyfriend had the Grilled Lamb. The portions were a bit smaller than the Poulet Vert but still moderately generous. The meat was perfectly cooked. Very tender, juicy and flavourful. \n\nThe atmosphere, yet again, was very loud.

Then approximately 5 minutes prior, I was still at home waiting for a cab with my friend, when we learned that our third party member had forgotten the reservation entirely - awkward.\n\nI called the restaurant yet again and explained our plight. Melanie, the hostess, asked when we could all reasonably be there, and I told her 8:30 (1/2 hour after the reservation's originally scheduled time). She graciously offered to hold our table.\n\nWhen we got there (around 8:25), our table was nearly ready. Melanie was so sweet and shook my hand upon arriving, realizing I was just a wee bit frazzled. From the moment we sat down, the service was outstanding. Our waitress (who seemed more like the manager, honestly), was so knowledgeable, guiding us through every course of the meal. After fun champagne cocktails (they do not appear to have a liquor license), we started with the salted lemon brussel sprout chips...as good as rumored, and deviled eggs (never my thing, but these were great with a spicy little kick). I added the cream of mushroom truffle soup...delicious. And the other two split a burrata appetizer that looked sinful. We all moved on to the incredible burgers for entrees. AMAZING. These rival the Spruce burger, which I at one point believed to be the best in the city. Marlowe's edge is that the tasty bun does not get soggy from all the juiciness of the meat and fixin's. \n\nFinishing with the chocolate cream pie in with a salted graham cracker crust was a must. \n\nI cannot WAIT to go back!!", "author": "Kiesha R."}

We were able to sit right away at the bar when two women left. I really loved the energy there.\n\nSitting at the bar was a bonus because our server, who maybe was named Trey, was attentive without being obtrusive, which is a difficult thing for servers to master these days. \n\nFood: Burratta cheese with some fancy salts. Not as good as the Uva burrata, but delicious, and served with nice bread. The salt was awesome I promise. Also a gem salad which was super refreshing and tasty. For dinner we split the bacon burger/frites and the poulet verte, a strangely herbed chicken that was fantastic. It came with vegetables that I ignored. Except for the fingerlings.\n\nWine: They have a really nice wine by the glass list. Every recommendation from Trey hit the spot exactly. \n\nDessert: Hello - some sort of jar of chocolate.\n\nAs I said, ambiance and service was great. We left really satisfied and happy.

Not only is the burger perfectly cooked, but you can really tell that thought and care has been put into the making of this burger.  The balance of ingredients is wonderful with the bacon adding a savory smokiness, and the caramelized onions providing a delicious sweetness.  The Acme bun holds in everything  and the shredded lettuce helps the burger stay in place (rather than the whole leaves getting soggy and then sliding off the patty).  \n\nNow to the fries - they are perfectly crisp with a delightfully pillowy center.  I don't know what kind of oil they are fried in, but they are easily the best fries in the city.  Make sure to order the famed Brussels sprout chips - they are nutty and salty with just a hint of lemon.  I have also ordered the chicken and it is covered in herbs and is super moist.  Desserts are perfectly portioned, but the upside down apple crisp is really an ice cream sundae.  The lemon cake is great and tastes like a lemon bar.

The host ignored us and sat with people who looked like friends that were eating dinner. It was very odd! She never came to check on us, nor speak with us again. There were many tables open, though no one was sitting at them. Finally at 9:30 we were approached by the bar tender stating he was sorry for the delay and would like to offer us a glass of wine.

My first impression was that I loved the ambiance - cozy but elegant and hip.  A nice selection of wines by the glass to choose from, and I selected a temperanillo that was very good.  We started with the crispy brussels sprout leaves - so good. I am trying to figure out how to make them at home. Next, was the pork belly appetizer, also quite good, maybe a tad on the dry side as compared to other times I have enjoyed that dish.  At this point I should say that while the dining room is very loud, it still seems intimate and I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place and the service is excellent.  For my main dish I ordered the cod. It was tasty, but while the portion was not huge, a little bit went a long way.  Cooked perfectly, however, I do think that dish can be a little more oily than my palate is comfortable with, but I honestly think that is just me, not the preparation.  My friend had the polenta with egg, and she loved it, couldn't finish it it was so rich. For dessert, we shared the dark chocolate mousse type thing, cannot remember what they call it, but it comes in a mason jar with graham cracker crust on the bottom and sea salt crust on the top - OMG!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "I want to like Marlowe more.  Consider my rating the veiled 3.5 stars although after tonight's meal, maybe 3.14 ... but I am adjusting upwards out of a spirit of forgiveness and rooting for the underdog.\n\nThe first time I went was for lunch, and I had the famed hamburger.  It really is great.  The meat is moist, the condiments are perfectly arranged and seasoned.  The fries are as good as at the previous concept, South, and that's no small feat.\n\nThe second time, also lunch.  I had the poulet vert.  First off, I think poulet vert is just a very sensible preparation.  SF has lots of perfectly-roasted chicken; it's like some kind of litmus test for every place that opens.  But it's usually ye olde meat, crispy skin, veggies on the side  (or underneath) format.  The fine line to walk, of course, is that with poulet vert you can cover up badly executed chicken with \"green stuff.\"  Marlowe doesn't do that; it's perfectly tender chicken with, uh, very delicious green stuff.\n\nTonight I had dinner.  We had the bone marrow to start.  It really is great.  It seems like lots of restaurants in SF offering bone marrow seem to forget the, uh, bone marrow.  I typically get lots of bone, not much marrow.  Not here.  It's a big serving, well presented, with nice garnishes (some caper-heavy thing ...).\n\nThe main courses were somewhere between mediocre and bad.  I had the halibut.  The menu says it's seared, with glazed baby vegetables, and spinach with a butter sauce.\n\nFirst of all, if you say a piece of meat is seared, it has to be BROWNED and have a crust on top.  Not lightly browned.  SEARED.  The fish was thinly cut so presumably they cut off the sear to avoid overcooking it.  That's no good excuse.  Go to Boulevard, guys, order the Halibut there.  It's a thick cut with an amazing brown crust.   The spinach was undersalted and slimy.  The glazed baby vegetables weren't really glazed, just buttered.  \n\nFortunately the sauce and the quality of the ingredients made the halibut pretty palatable overall.  I don't think a kitchen like Marlowe should put a dish like that out.  But it kinda hits the \"OK, maybe they just hit a foul ball\" note.  I'm not so fussy I'll cry over a not-perfect piece of good halibut.  \n\nLamb, on the other hand ... \n\nMy partner's lamb ... ummm ... was a total mess.  Apparently all the sear I didn't get, he got in spades on the lamb.  The outside had grill marks, and it had that super-bitter, over-charred taste.  The inside is cooked to the right temperature, but it's dry ... definitely way under-rested.  The side is parmesan and ricotta dumplings ... suupppperrr dense, like eating heavy rocks.  The vegetables were fine but kinda just there for kicks.  Way oversalted, too.\n\nDessert ... pot de creme.  I ordered it because it's made with TCHO chocolate.  I'd eat TCHO sprinkled on broken glass.  It was fine.  Overcooked by pot de creme standards, very dense, but still ... lots of TCHO goodness.  Hard to beat.\n\nI don't want to knock Marlowe down because of one bad night.  I love, say, COCO500 but they've had bad nights, and I still love and support them.  The unfortunate fact though is that, although I'm forgiving, I doubt I can convince my boyfriend to make this place a \"destination spot\" now.  It's a shame.  One bad night can really throw a place off, and any night is your potential first impression. \n\nMy advice to Marlowe:  make all the food as good as the burger, keep up the attention to detail, do it every night, and don't stop.", "author": "J W."}

But, you know, I think those brussel sprout chips might be worth $4 a gallon for a road trip south.  Wondering what exactly a brussel sprout chip is? Well, here is what I could gather from the bowl that I inhaled. Stripped of each tiny leaf, the chips were flash fried and doused with salt, pepper, lemon zest, and juice...maybe, this is my best guess as to what is involved in my new favorite beer snack. I also kept imagining them as a topping on some kind of creamy soup. They were crunchy, acidic, and salty and extremely addictive. What else was on our menu? We had a great carmelized pork belly with some amazing roasted beets. Steak tartare that had a surprising touch of chili pepper heat to set off the cold-silky bite spooned on top of crostini. And, baked oysters. Oh the baked oysters. That one you just need to taste for yourself. But, let's just say I could easily hop in my car and make the drive down from Portland just for a table full of those oysters.\n\nThe space of the restaurant was tiny, but intimate and romantic.

But I would have also liked to have tried their Brussels Sprout Chips and Sweet Corn soup too...I guess next time!\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I ordered the only vegetarian one on their menu: Anson Mills polenta wild mushrooms, truffled pecorino & poached farm egg. It was REALLY good...I could get a whiff of the truffled pecorino in every bite, and the shaved parmesan on top mixed with the wild mushrooms went very well with the polenta. My only complaint would be that it got a little too salty towards the last few bites, but hey, that's because I left nothing on the plate!\n\nI'd love to try their summer squash gratin and brown butter brussels sprouts some time as well!

I wouldn't say it's the best burger in San Francisco (that honor goes to the animal-style In-N-Out cheeseburger hands friggin down), but Marlowe's is pretty good.  The french fries...now they're amazing.  I don't know if it's because I asked for them extra crispy, but they were damn good especially dipped in the mayonnaise they were served with.  \n\nAs for the service, I think Marlowe recruited from the school of the deaf.  Several times, we called out above the din, \"Excuse me.\"  And then again at screaming level, \"EXCUSE ME.\"  Customers in the middle of the restaurant had to stop two different waiters twice, \"That table has been calling for you.\"  Ironically, the restaurant space is rather small, too.\n\nAfter a while, I think the place will go south like its predecessor, but for now, Marlowe owes its business to Mr. Bauer.

Or hit anywhere close to expectations.\n\nThe restaurant is smaller than inside than it appears from the outside. The bar seats six across and I became well acquainted with it while my party of 4 waited 30 minutes to be seated. The decor is well done, and I probably would have enjoyed the \"cozy\" feel of Marlowe if I didn't experienced feeling cramped into the bar then being seated at the communal table (leather topped oak park benches are still park benches). The small tables look like they could be the charming backdrop for an intimate date. The lighting is low as are the ceilings, making the place feel more claustrophobic than quaint when you're squished onto the communal table.\n\nThe food didn't really make up for the wait. Starting with the Brussels sprout chips we ordered at the bar, the food just didn't meet expectations given how much they charged. As a huge Brussels sprout fan, I was excited to try the interesting sounding dish. Unfortunately when the mostly soggy, oily dish arrived and I got a mouth full of lemon zest, I wasn't impressed. The few crispy \"chip\" like pieces I managed to find were delicious, but they were few and far between -- the majority were soggy and another portion had gotten all of the lemon flavoring. They were otherwise bland.\n\nAmong the 4 of us we had 2 orders of polenta, a burger and the lamb dish. The only one who was entirely impressed with his dinner was my friend who had ordered the lamb. Having not tried the burger, I can only note that there was apparently nothing outstanding about it. The polenta was bland, well cooked with a nice texture but entirely lacking in flavor. The mushrooms it was topped with felt nicely decorative on top of the oily arugula but didn't really add much to the polenta. The pecorino cheese and truffle weren't really present in the flavor, leaving me to wonder why I had paid $18 for what tasted like a half-hearted attempt at polenta. To round out the food review, I should mention that they have a decent wine list.\n\nAll that being said, the reason I have hope for Marlowe is that the owners seem involved, from what I can see on their website they were pulling both serving and hosting duties. I think they'll learn to work with the space, lowering how many people they attempt to accommodate, and just generally setting in.

The burger was extra juicy, so my bread got soggy pretty quickly. I think if the fries hadn't sit so long, it would've been great. It seemed like they fried the fries a little longer which makes it crispier, but when it sits longer it actually just becomes hard. We sat at the bar and got a lot of attention from the waitress. We also fried the pomegranate ice tea. My boyfriend insists on trying everything that is pomegranate, it could be socks, he won't care and still eat it. The ice tea was not so great. You had the lipton tea taste with a tartness.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Fortunately, Marlowe continues the tradition, including some familiar faces. And I like the new interior.\n\nWe went there for dinner. The Baked Oysters were very good (thank you, guys!), and the Spiced Prawns were better than the somewhat similar dish at South (which was good). Some people here loved the Lamb Mixed Grill, but I actually preferred the lamb at South. But just like the Cod it was good. The Upside Down Apple Crisp was very good.\n\nI still hope somebody would open an Aussie place in SF - but Marlowe is definitely a good American Bistro-kind of place.

Our reservations were at 9:30 for a group that had dwindled to three at the last minute. The hostess never missed a beat, and seated us promptly. Our host was friendly and helpful, charting us through the menu and offering suggestions. We went with the crab and shrimp louie with tabasco to start, and it was fantastic. \nIf you've heard rave reviews for the Marlowe burger, it lives up to the hype. My friend, the burger connoisseur, gave it a two thumbs up, and thats an accomplishment, considering her hands were busy with the burger! Main courses were flavorful and well portioned, and the chocolate creme pot for dessert is chocolate-y with crunchy bits of...something, and ever so slightly salty as well. It was definitely the most mature chocolate creme pot I've ever encountered. \nI could sum up this experience as being: Grown up. And that's a good thing. It's a great neighborhood addition, a step away from Caltrain and MUNI, and upscale enough to bring co workers or out of town guests without the pretentiousness. Classy and casual.

We loved burgers to begin with, but the hunger associated with pregnancy may have amplified E's appetite for them even more than usual.  We also are concerned that our ability to eat at restaurants outside of our immediate neighborhood may be severely curtailed soon.  These two factors motivated us to try out Marlowe up in the city, which has a reputation for serving a great burger.\n\nI came in from work on the Caltrain - Marlowe is conveniently situated across the street from the 4th and King station on Townsend, and walked right in to a seat at the bar.  I ordered some of the fried brussels sprout chips to munch while I waited for E.  They were pleasantly bitter and crispy, maybe a tad on the oily side.  E arrived shortly and we both ordered a burger done medium.  The burgers are moderate in size, but very well executed.  Both our patties were done to what we consider medium (still pink inside).  The buns were ever so slightly burnt on the outsides, which gives a satisfying charred taste to the sandwich.  The bacon and cheddar toppings come standard and were tasty.  The fries were also perfectly executed - crispy outside and moist inside with a generous side of horseradish sauce.  We agreed it's tied for our favorite burger with the Refuge down in San Carlos.  Of course it's pricey compared to a fast food burger, but the craftmanship and quality ingredients are in ample evidence here and I felt like it was worth very penny.  \n\nFinally, no Coke served here, only Cane Cola, which while maybe more environmentally responsible, does not refresh me as well as a real Coke.  \n\nOn the way out the hostess congratulated us and told us that some families do manage to come with their little ones.  We hope to be able to do the same.", "author": "Don L."}

Ordered the spiced jumbo shrimp, dungeness crab louie, baby beats and burrata and the crispy brussell sprouts.  Each and all were amazing.  \n\nWe did also order the deviled eggs (good, not great) but there's a story with this.  We were told when we were seated that they only have 3-4 deviled eggs left for the evening and that we should rush order them now (as soon as we sat down) so that we can grab them.  So in a panic, we ordered 4 (one for each of us).  She came back and said she only had 3 left for the night.  We took them.  When we got them, they were good, not great....but what was annoying was around the time we received our entrees, the table next to us ordered 6 deviled eggs and got them promptly.  Hmmm...did they just go out and get more eggs?  I thought they ran out?  Was it a tactic used to get us to order them?  Were they trying to get rid of them?  Who knows.  But the place came off as dishonest.\n\nThe entrees themselves were a bit underwhelming.  We ordered the marlowe burger (definitely NOT something to get) and the Poulet Vert, which was overly salty.\n\nWe passed on dessert after much debate once we noticed that all of them are prepared in a jar.

I'd have sent it back if I hadn't been starving....\n\nTo top off the experience, there were little bugs flying around that seemed attracted to a decorative piece on the wall of the bar filled with fresh limes and lemons.

The burger and fries were good, but I would rather graze on the other things.  We also got the corn soup and pea soup/ricotta toast which were good, but not like the other things.

I think marlowe has potential - the dishes are pretty good, I have loved the space (slightly industrial, very SOMA) since it was South Food and Bar, and the service was very friendly and helpful (if a bit slow because they're packed), but the food was honestly a bit too salty for me.  My bf started with the little gem salad which he enjoyed (avocado, market veggies, citrus vinaigrette) and then had the poulet vert, which was good. But I started with the roasted bone marrow which turned up swimming in oil (I give them kudos for giving me an extra portion because the first bone was too small,  except I couldn't really enjoy either because of the oil).  And then I had the stuffed sole (stuffed with dungeness crab, glazed celery root, baby fennel, meyer lemon and capers) which definitely had potential but was too salty.

We had no reservation but were seated within 15 minutes which was very nice.  The place is small but it is very nicely decorated. It was cozy and modern yet warm.  We parked on Townsend which was free after 6pm so that was nice.  The hostess was very friendly and tried to seat us as soon as she could (5 stars to her).  She told us when we first got there that we were going to sit at the bar but then a spot on the communal table opened up and she put us there.  We ordered the brussel sprout chips, two baked oysters, the pork chop, and the burger.  I was debating whether to get the burger or the steak.  My sister debated over the pork chop or the scallops and went with the pork chop since the scallops don't come without the mushrooms (which she hates).  \n\nBrussel Sprout Chips - 5  stars - Amazingly delicious!\nBaked Oysters - 4 stars - Tasty, full of stuff on top which supplemented the small oyster.  \nPork Chop - 5 stars  - My sister said it was the best pork chop she has had.  I thought it was very good but not the best ever.  The seasonings reminded me of thanksgiving, probably because of the sage that was used.\nBurger - 3 stars - This was recommended over the steak since they said they sell more of it.  I didn't really think it was as good as everyone makes it out to be.  My bun had the chargrill marks and tasted pretty burnt.  The meat was nice and juicy but the accompaniments weren't as flavorful as I thought they should be to add to the flavor.  My sister thought it was just okay also.  The fries that came with it were good\nStrawberry Upside Down Dessert - (5 stars) - So yummy! It was vanilla ice cream with a gooey caramel crunch on top with diced up strawberries.  \n\nThe waitress was very nice (5 stars).  The lemonade is sparkling lemonade, not flat.  My sister sent hers back after she took a sip not knowing it would be sparkling.  The waitress kindly took it back.\n\nI will definitely be back and will order the steak the next time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-23", "description": "Came here a few months ago to see what all the fuss was over this burger. We arrived right on time for our reservation (a Saturday evening) and the hostess let us know that the couple at our table was just finishing dessert and it would be a few minutes. No problem. Fast forward 30 minutes and the couple at our table has ordered a second round of coffee and apparently has nowhere to go all night. Moments before I was about to go check with the hostess again about our table, she comes to find us with complimentary glasses of champagne in hand and apologizing profusely that our table is still occupied. This woman is a class act. Totally not her fault that this couple had a 45 minute dessert course and she couldn't exactly kick them out. She did exactly what every other host or hostess should do when a guest is left waiting well beyond the reservation time. She acknowledged us and was totally empathetic. The free champagne certainly didn't hurt either. How can you be annoyed when a lovely Australian (or New Zealand?) woman gives you free bubbly and is so nice? 5 stars for her alone. Then there is the food.\n\nWe had the brussel sprout chips which are totally genius. Salty and lemony and crunchy and divine.  We also had the shrimp cocktail which is not your average right-from-the-jar cocktail sauce. Spicy and boozy sauce served with perfectly roasted shrimp that have some kind of seasoning that makes you not even need the sauce.\n\nFor the main course, we shared the burger and the sole. The sole was great but the burger really stood out. I didn't really believe the hype but it was seriously the best burger I have ever had. So juicy and delicious and just right. It is perfect. Wouldn't change a thing.\n\nAs if we weren't full enough, I couldn't resist getting dessert in a jar. The lemon souffle cake was dynamite. Light and fluffy and lemony and a great way to end a fabulous meal. Highly recommend this place (and the rockstar hostess).", "author": "Carrie L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-13", "description": "The food here is definitely 5 star quality, but the service could use a little bit of work.  Arrived a little bit earlier than our reservation time, but the hostess was super friendly and constantly checking in with us, which I thought was pretty cool for a place as casual as this one.  We only waited about 5-10 minutes, but she must have talked to us about 3 or 4 different times.  haha\n\nBut before I get to the good, let me explain the missing star.  Service at Marlowe is just so-so.  I am not sure if it is the system they use or because they use those long picnic tables and it is hard to really keep track of things.  To gauge service, I use my water test.  Simply put, if my water cup remains empty for long periods of time during the night, it means that the waiters were not attentive enough.  Pretty fair, IMO.  Needless to say, my cup was empty a few times during the night, and it didn't help that the cups were quite small.  Also, bread is available upon request, but when we finished ours, it was not refilled, and there was a nice 15 min window between our starters and entrees.  Lastly, we did not order any special drinks for the night and I got this resentful vibe from one of the waitresses like \"oh great, these are some cheap a** people,\" and after saying we just wanted water, no waitress was to be seen or heard from for about 10-15 minutes.  So after being checked in on 4 times in less than 10 minutes while waiting outside, we got checked on about 1 time in 20 minutes while sitting down inside.  \n\nNow ,the good.  The food!\n\nBrussel Sprout Chips - read almost every review from this place and this is a must order...I've been eating brussel sprouts for years and this is by far the best way to eat them...these are on limited quantity (probably because it is a pain to separate the leaves) so make sure you order these asap\n\nCrab and Rock Shrimp Louie - these are served more like lettuce wraps, and they are excellent...served along side sea salt and some tabasco...nice and refreshing\n\nPork Chop (friend's order) - cooked about medium, but very tasty...extremely tender\n\nChicken (friend's order) - I believe this chicken is slow roasted, as the waitress told us it takes about 30 min to prepare (which it did) and it was definitely worth the wait...I don't know if I've ever had roast chicken be so moist before...the sauce on top of it is really good too..savory with a little bit of sweetness\n\nStuffed Sole (my order!) - this pretty much tasted like the louie I mentioned above, stuffed in a filet of sole...very tasty..a little on the salty side, but not enough to prevent me from licking my plate clean\n\nUpside Down Pear Crisp - not really a pear crisp, but more like a pear sundae...ice cream served in a jar with a bourbon caramel sauce, diced pears, and some \"crisp\" (granola?)...the combination was really godo but not quite what we really expected...when we read crisp, we all imagined something more traditional...but it was very good anyway\n\nThey have valet parking here, but if you have legs and don't mind using them, street parking is not so bad.  The venue itself is really, really small so I highly recommend reservations, on any night.  We went on a Thursday night and it was packed with people waiting.  Like I mentioned above, the service was the only sketchy part, but the food was so good that it overshadows that.  The portions aren't that big, so I recommend not arriving here starving to death.", "author": "JP T."}

We're talking the kind of quality you expect for a nice date night out on reservations, and yet we managed to get in on a whim (our original plans for the evening fell through) and the appetizers and burgers were very doable price wise.  \n\nThe #1 thing that comes to mind, oddly enough, are the deviled eggs we had for an appetizer.  If you are at all a fan, their version with jalapenos and bacon and whatnot is fabulous and I can totally see stopping in for just those and a couple glasses of wine and some other appetizers if I was in the mood for a light bite.  We also had steak tartare which was likewise delicious and there were a few other apps on the menu that sounded tasty and seem well-reviewed enough to try next time.\n\nWe went the burger route like many and were not disappointed.  Theirs is not my absolute favorite but it's solidly in the running for a top spot, and their preparation (bacon, horseradish aioli, and a few other things) is unusual and tasty, so it's definitely worth trying just as something out of the ordinary.\n\nI enjoyed a Butcher's Mistress cocktail and liked it so much I ended up drinking three.  \"Nuff said.\n\nNow for the drawbacks, with a couple caveats.  We showed up asking for a table for four sans reservations since that's just how the evening worked out, and between that and the size of the place (cute decor and all, but really tiny), it was kind of a wait and a pain.  The server did her best to make sure we had drinks but theirs is really a place you don't want to wait in at all because there's hardly any room to stand, let alone sit down while waiting.  So avoid all this and call in beforehand, OK?\n\nOn another note, I was peeved I had to figure out which of our four burgers was mine, as I was not initially given the rare burger I ordered (it went instead to my best friend, and I got someone else's medium done one).  We sorted it out amongst ourselves, but it did not help that when I asked the server about it, he snapped that he'd brought me the \"right one\" because he \"made sure to keep them in order.\"  I wouldn't even mention this normally (hey, it happens)  but I almost felt like I shouldn't even have asked based on the snarky response, and that rubs me the wrong way on the \"service\" category.", "author": "Carolyn M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-17", "description": "After having a drink at Bar Basic tonight , my BF, another friend and I went to Marlowe in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood. Housed in the space formerly occupied by South, Marlowe offers an intimate dining experience in a rustic and cozy environment. The space is pretty small, but it didn't feel cramped. I really enjoyed the service in the restaurant. Our waitress was just cheeky enough and seemed to be having a good time. And, of course, an accent always wins over the American diner. Just think of Marlowe as your neighborhood bistro with a Australian flair.\n\nWe began with a drink at the small community table. I had a Czech dark lager that I enjoyed, but it didn't blow my mind. I'm amazed how my beer expectations have grown over the past couple of years. After drinks, Lee (the friend) abandoned us and we were seated at our table.\n\nBased on Lee's earlier suggestion, we started with the brussel sprout chips: crispy, oily, salty. If you like brussel sprouts, you will undoubtedly like these light crunchy leaves of salty goodness. For dinner, we ordered the black cod with fennel and spinach, the burger with bacon and horseradish aioli and a side of cauliflower gratin. The cod was subtle but good. The broth was definitely dunk-worthy (which reminds me that the bread was nice and soft). I think the spinach could have been a little richer or spicier, but it was a solid dish. The burger was good (ordered medium rare) and the bacon added the touch of umami that I expect. I definitely missed the pickled onions that I can get at other places (shout out to NOPA), but the horseradish aioli was a good compromise. The cauliflower was a dish of smoky cheesy veggie goodness--I recommend it. I would like to try the brown butter brussel sprouts next time, too.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Tcho Dark Chocolate Bar Pudding with creme fraiche and maple pistachios. Much like a pot de creme, it was thick and rich and chocogasmic. All the other desserts looked quite good, too. I would have been happy with any of them, but chocolate is always hard to pass up.\n\nFor dinner, I chose the Husch Pinot Noir. After it breathed a bit, it really opened up and tasted quite good. At $13 a glass, it lived up to my expectations.\n\nAll in all, Marlowe is a great addition to the neighborhood, and it really appeals to me more than South ever did. I'm looking forward to trying out several of their other dishes and stopping by for a drink (or two) after work. Here's to the beginning of a beautiful friendship.", "author": "Todd X."}

It was cozy and the server was good.  The food turned out to be delicious. However, I saw the next day that my credit card had been charged twice- once for correct amount, and an additional $140 charge! I called and talked to a manager who said she would look into it. Two days later, the charge was still there and I had received no call from Marlowe. I called again. And then again every day after that for three days, as well as numerous calls to my bank. \n\nMarlowe claimed they could not find the wrong charge in their records, and didn't offer to talk to my bank or do anything to help. Finally, a full six days after the charge occured, I got my bank to pull it off my statement. I called Marlowe to tell them that my BANK had taken care of it, and they offered to send me a gift certificate in the hope that I would actually return for a meal. I got it in the mail several days later and it was for... $25!! \n\nUnbelievable.

After grabbing a glass of vino (helpful&friendly hostess) and waiting ~15min, she called us to our seats at the bar.\n\nGood food, but enjoyed some more than others:\n- crispy brussels sprouts chips -- just had to try after reading all the raves, but a bit disappointed by these airy fried and crispy brussel chips.  Not bad, but now that I know, I'd rather spend money on something else.\n- steak tartare -- comes in a mound with quail egg on top served over a bed of greens with crostinis.  Good flavor; the egg is a nice touch.\n- stuffed blue sole -- white fish stuffed with blue crab.  Very good!  I had a bite and regretted not going with that dish.\n- polenta -- polenta topped with a poached egg and mushroom and truffled pecorino accompanied by greens.  Although generally not a huge fan of polenta, but wanted to try it that night.  The polenta wasn't too buttery (good) yet had bits of gritty texture (also good).  It was too rich as an entire dish for me, but one of the better polenta I've had.  Amazing flavor!\n- upside down pear crisp -- with bourbon ice cream and brown butter caramel sauce.  Meh.  It was not what we expected and I wasn't a fan so stopped after a bite.  It's mostly ice cream with diced pieces of pears.  NOTE: apparently, all their desserts are served in a jar.\n\nSmaller space (small tables as well as communal tables) with gastropub feel that makes it good for after-work casual eats.

I was ready to be wowed, but was completely underwhelmed.\n     The brussel sprout chips were not what I expected. They were flavorful and well seasoned. However, they reminded me of the scrapings on a pan after making roasted brussel sprouts.\n     The spicy prawns were also ok. They were well seasoned, and cooked well, but there was nothing spectacular about them.\n     The famous bone marrow ended up being....eh. There was a lot of beef flavor, but the richness was just too much for me. I think I prefer foie over marrow for a fatty spread and I don't particularly like foie.\n     On the other hand, the chicken was really good. The meat was extremely moist, and it was perfectly seasoned. The chicken flavor was brought out by the perfect amount of salt.\n     The marlowe burger ended up being ok as well. The meat was fresh, the bun was perfectly toasted, the cheese was melted, and the bacon was perfectly crisp. However, the burger flavor itself was masked by a little too much char. It was a good burger, but for 12 dollars, there is a list of much better burgers out there.\n     The carrot cake trifle was terrible. Any of the sweetness it had was completely drowned away by an orange peel taste. The waitress said that it was persimmon, but I tasted orange peel. She was nice enough to take it off the bill.\n     Overall, this place is good. But for the prices, I will be trying other places before I return.", "author": "Siao W."}

I was so much of a fan of this place that I returned with my hubby.   I like that this restaurant is not pretentious like other American/Traditional restaurants.  The service is great.  The dungeness crab and shrimp louie is a great appetizer to start off with.  Their burger is very good.  I did not enjoy their chocolate dessert.  I am quite the chocoholic and I think they missed the mark with trying to serve dark chocolate salty.  I think if they focused on making their chocolate option more like a divine vulcan chocolate cake with ice cream then that would be a hit.  Even the waitress admitted that most people don't like the chocolate dessert.  I think this is a hint for them to reconsider their recipe.  I really liked the upside down pecan crisp with bourbon ice cream.  So for now, that's my dessert of choice until they offer a delicious chocolate option.  \n\nI did not like that unlike most restaurants they allow people with reservations to book the entire restaurant.  As a walk-in, we had the option to wait an hour and half since there were no reservations made at 10 pm.  I think they should advertise this on their website as there were walk-ins who walked away unhappily from the restaurant.  They also only have a single bathroom where my husband had to wait 20 minutes to use.  I awkwardly ordered for the both of us since he was still in line when the waitress was ready for our order.    \n\nApart from this, I like Marlowe because it is a solid restaurant that I look forward to revisiting in the future, as long as I remember to make a reservation ahead of time and avoid using the bathroom.", "author": "C L."}

Mushrooms with truffle flavoring, toasted bread, other tasty things I forget now.\nBrussels sprout chips: tasty as hell, but much greasier than they were on my first visit.\nButternut Squash soup: Very nice, but there's a lot of good soup in this town.\n\nMains: we ordered burgers with fries. That's what they're famous for, right?\n\nFirst problem - they basically forgot our order. We watched the bartender actually key in the order in the computer, so it wasn't his fault. But we were waiting and waiting and waiting...  We had to ask WTF and then he looked into it, and then they brought the wrong orders, and then finally they showed up. Like 45 minutes of waiting, seriously. And the kitchen was 5 feet away.\n\nProblem 1: not hot. They were obviously sitting around with nobody picking them up. If I weren't in such a hurry (due to the lateness) I'd have definitely sent my meal back and gotten a fresh one.\n\nProblem 2: Not cooked right. I asked for Medium and I got medium rare/rare. Maybe they gave me someone else's plate since mine had gotten lost?\n\nProblem 3: Fries were way too salty. Yes, I'm being nitpicky, but these guys are reputed to have the city's best fries, so I'm allowed to be critical here. \n\nSo that's about the size of it.

He wanted to know if there was anywhere in my neighborhood I wanted to try. Well, I'd heard many good things about this place and it's amazing burger so I suggested Marlowe. Two ingredients for a potentially lovely night: cute boy and amazing burger. \n\nMuch has been said about the link between food and sensuality, and I must admit that I have never fully understood the relationship. Who knew that baked oysters, a phenomenal burger, chocolate bar pudding and an apple crisp would be a minor epiphany for me? \n\nI was the second to arrive and my date was standing nervously in front waiting for me. Naturally, I gave him a hug. He looked so cute and he was wearing a Barbour jacket! I have a soft spot for men in finely tailored clothes. We definitely had the second date jitters, you know, where you like each other but don't know each other well so the conversation is still filled with awkward smiles and pauses. \n\nWe went inside- I never went to South, but I really like the space. It is small, intimate, and dimly lit. Very romantic. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, but the hostess politely showed us to the bar where we perused the wine list. Marlowe has a great selection of beer and wine. Alcohol is a great catalyst for familiarity so I was thankful we headed to the bar first. After a brief wait, our waitress arrived and showed us to our table. She took our wine glasses (perhaps she didn't want me to eat it in my heels and ruin my chances) to the table which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nWe ordered the baked oysters and burgers for dinner. The baked oysters, covered in bacon pieces, are everything that I look for in an oyster: slippery, crunchy, salty, sweet and smoky. Heaven. Then we had the burger, which I will say, is a bit over the top covered in caramelized onions, cheddar and bacon. However, as my date and I agreed, if you are going to have a burger you might as well go big or go home. The patty, which we both ordered medium rare is full and flavorful with irony goodness and the meat melts in your mouth. Plus, who can complain when such tastiness is accompanied with cheddar and bacon? Score, right? Also, the fries were wonderful, with their bright crispy exterior and light fluffy centers. \n\nNow, I am a dessert fiend. I will have a conniption fit if I don't get it. My date ordered the chocolate bar pudding and I ordered the apple crisp. The desserts arrived in adorable mason jars. I couldn't help myself and I reached over to have some of his pudding. Amazing: cool, creamy, not two sweet and slightly bitter. My dessert was heavenly, but I've never met an apple dessert that I didn't like. Diced apples, covered in a brown sugar sauce, were hot, crisp and tart and contrasted nicely with the cool richness of the ice cream and the buttery crunchiness of the topping. Needless to say, we finished our desserts in no time. \n\nAnyhow, I really enjoyed my experience at Marlowe. I thought our waitress was attentive and our hostess was very friendly. The food speaks for itself and the space was very nice. Also, I like the quirkiness of the restaurant: they played Johnny Cash during dinner, which my date greatly appreciated. All told, we didn't try much of the menu, but what we had was great and what is better than eating excellent food with an adorable boy you like smiling back at you? Not much, in my opinion. \n\nAfter dinner, my date walked me to my car, and underneath the night sky and city lights...he kissed me!

I made a large lunch reservation with them, and had to cancel the Monday prior to the reservation.  When I called to cancel, I was told that my reservation had been made for Tuesday, not Wednesday, and so I was not canceling within the 48 hour time frame necessary for cancellations, and would be charged $15 per person, a total of $400.  After argueing for some time with the hostess about the reservation date, I was told I would be called the following day by the event coordinator to work something out, and if they decided to charge me, would be sent a $400 gift card to the restaurant.  As I have been a loyal customer of the establishment, and was calling in a good-faith effort to respect their 48 hour notice policy, I assumed we could reach some sort of agreement to waive the $400 fee, which seems not only tremedously unfair, but also incredibly excessive, as we hadn't booked the restaurant out, and were ordering from the regular menu (nothing had been pre-determined).  I never received a call back from the event coordinator, and assumed that she was waiving the fee.  Fast forward three weeks, and there is a $400 charge on my credit card from them, and they have never attempted to contact me to resolve this issue.  I also have not received the $400 gift card.  \n\nPrior to this issue, I had never received bad service from the restaurant and had taken many clients there for lunch, as well as recommended it to friends.  Needless to say, I will not be going back.   It's a shame that they didn't feel it worthwhile to try to work something out with me.", "author": "Very D."}

Long story short, while the meal was DELICIOUS, we both got violently ill from food poisoning.  That is not the reason why I'm only giving 2 stars because I know things like this can happen to any restaurants.  I'm giving a low rating because my friend wrote rather a polite and articulate email to them about our experience.  Not complaining, not demanding for anything.  Just a simple note informing them of what happened, just in case others may have gotten sick, too.  All we got was \"We'll take it into consideration\".  What?!  Take into consideration to do what?  I was dumb founded.  No apology (not for the poisoned food but for the bad experience). Nothing.  I've been around the food circuit for a long time in SF, Chicago, NYC and London.

I'm sitting on a caned, rough hewn wood chair at a small two top looking at the kinda bleak Caltrain Station across the street, the bicycle hut directly in my line of site waiting for my medium Marlowe burger with determined anticipation of that peculiar sensual satisfaction your burger guru finds when consuming a good burger.\n\nJohnny Cash is crooning on the sound system adding to the atmosphere mellowness and memories and out of nowhere a white rectangular sunken plate is put down in from of me and it a pretty picture indeed.   A generous portion of heavenly fries occupy about 1/3 of the plattered presentation with two ramekins between said fries and the perfectly toasted, still warm lightly seeded bun, the charred Niman beef patty with a thick slice of tasty cheddar melted just right, and nice tomato, grilled onions, crisp bacon and shredded greens atop the meat and cheese.  The bun is a perfect fit to the burger and trimmings and the lightly spread special sauce complements the whole experience kisses with love.  Every bite of this superb burger was crisp, crunchy and filled with sensory delights from the well  thought out balance of components and the masterful cooking and presentation.  Mixing bites of the burger with the addictive lush fries, washing it down with a great cane diet cola is the stuff of opium dreams for me, sensory exhilaration.\n\nThe sauces in the ramekins were a good catchup and an interesting horseradish sauce that seemed like it would be overbearing, but turns out to be a great spiked complement to both the burger and fries, again well thought out and executed.   The lunch and dinner menu's both offer the burger, about a buck more at dinner, and well worth it.  Another lunch offering that caught my eye is an open face deviled egg sandwich with bacon and provolone, yum.   Pulled pork and as did a warm Caribbean Shrimp Roll and adding to the attractions on their menu are a sweet corn soup, a little gem salad, summer squash gratin and intriguing Brussels sprout chips.  All in all, a fun, compelling and interesting menu, one that invites me back to try more.   Desserts consist of a trio of offerings including a ToHo dark chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me, raspberry and lemon pudding cake and a summer berry parfait.\n\nMarlowe is up near the top of my burger bible ratings and I hope you find it so yourself.", "author": "Stu S."}

All of them are really fantastic and all of them are usually quite consistent. I rate at this level rarely and I rate at this level after several consistent experiences. Protip: this is a restaurant, not your kitchen. Don't come here regularly expecting low calorie, low sodium crap. Do come here once in a while with expectations of a real treat (you may need to work it off at the gym!). \n\nThe decor and layout of the space is also greatly improved since the reopening. The additional high table where previously a desk stood works well to fill the room with more life, and benefits the restaurant with a few more seats to turn.

I feel like when a restaurant only has 6 entrees all 6 of them better kick a whole lotta butt, unfortunately I did not think the burger was all that butt kicking. The description sounded sooo good; bacon, cheese, carmelized onions, aioli sauce....what not to like? My burger was just okay. It wasn't bad, I'm not complaining or sending anything back but it wasn't an item on a 6 item menu that was anything special and I don't even remember tasting the onions and that is so key!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-24", "description": "I see some other folks who wrote on the fence reviews as well. \nI had been looking forward to trying Marlow since I saw the picture of the prawns in the SF gate. \n\nI'll start by saying that most of the reviews are for the burger. I didn't try it but if you can't get that right then you should not be in business. It isn't hard to grind your beef and have good toasted buns piled with all sorts of goodness. Heck, in and out does a fine job. \n\nMy dinning companion and I sat at the bar and tried 4 dishes to share.\n\n\"Baked Oysters-New England chowder in a shell\"... I'm reluctant to say it was ok. It read fun but the oysters tasted pre-shucked and I imagined more of a creamy soup texture. There was some indication of a soup and a random bite of potato, but that was all. The oysters were too milky, mushy and old tasting. No redeeming sweetness or brine. I had some baked Pt. Reyes oysters last week that were phenomenal!. large yet sweet, tender not mushy. Fresh and briny like the ocean. \n\n\"Artichoke soup\"... a bit watery, and lackluster. The flavor was Ok but the cream fraiche didn't add enough fat or substance to the soup. Kind of like how the foam in your latte only adds surface fat. It quickly dissipates not really adding richness or substantive dairy notes leaving behind a cup of  lonely bitter coffee screaming for help.\n The soup had Morel mushrooms as well but they tasted  rehydrate and rubbery. At first I thought that the soup way too salty but my companion pointed out that it must be finishing salt on the surface. We didn't mix the soup, as some might, because we wanted to eat it bite for bite. A little cream fraiche in each spoon full.. overall the soup base was good enough. maybe just maybe if the chef had taken a shallow bowl, placed a saute of spring vegetables (favas, mushrooms, peas, and artichokes) in the the center and ladled a small potion of soup base around it might have given it more credibility and substance. \n\n\"Steak Tartare\" ... probably the best dish we had. Nice tender beef, well seasoned, sauced and plated. I actually would have preferred a raw quail egg but at least there was some yolk to mix into the beef. The crostini they served along side the meat was ok but grilled bread or something more tender would have been better. Crostini is too predictable \"a pre-service dreaded prep item\".. fresh grilled smoky bread is always preferred AND a better companion to any dish that calls for bread.. it's the small things that do the trick. \n\n\"Spicy Shrimp\"... are you nuts! it blew my head off. Yes it did say spicy in the menu description but if I had had this prior to my main then I would have been very upset. After my first prawn I spent the rest of the time trying to wipe off the heat so that I could finish them. It was kind of like putting too  much wasabi on your sushi. Aside from trying to be manly, whats the point; all heat and nothing else, certainly no sweet seafood flavors. If I was hung over, a plate  with a pint would be prefect! \n\nsome of you might say \"how can you review a place based solely on their apps?\".. well, for me it indicates how they kitchen approaches food. It's the first impression, first sensation that a dinner experiences. It should blow the dinner out of the water in anticipation of whats to follow. Not the reverse. \n\nOverall everything seemed too random. The chefs vision is a little muddled. You can see that there is experience but not depth. Excitement but no restraint. I'll go back  to check out the mains.. who knows..", "author": "Stephen G."}

On my recent visit to the bay area, I wanted to find a place close to SF MoMA for dinner so I made reservations for Marlowe. The small, intimate space was cozy and inviting and the service was friendly and attentive. The food was spectacular-- comforting and familiar without being boring in the least bit. We started off with the roasted bone marrow, which was decadently tasty and served with a salsa verde and bread. If I could eat this every day, I would..although my cholesterol levels would probably rise. For entrees I ordered the Poulet Vert and the boy got their grass-fed burger. He loved his burger, which was a very tasty lesson in the basics and my chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy, and incredibly flavorful! The poulet is marinated in olive oil and herbs for 24 hours and so it turns a little green on the outside. Everything about it was well-balanced and delightful. It was served with pee-wee potatoes (Peruvian blue and Dutch yellow) roasted perfectly whole, as well as some sauteed broccolini which was tossed with some lemon and chili flake. I loved the sides, but found some of the broccoli too spicy from the chili flake. Other than that, perfection. It was exactly what I wanted and it truly delivered.

The food varies from ok to excellent. The excellent includes the brussel sprout chips, the good includes the burger, and the ok includes, unfortunately, the Creekstone Farms steak. I was particularly disappointed by the steak, as I count the Creekstone Farms ribeye at nearby Fringale as one of my favorite steaks anywhere. The steak at Marlowe was a bit dry and not very flavorful, despite being faithfully cooked to medium rare.\n\nUltimately, the biggest downside to my experiences at Marlowe has been the service. Yes, I get it, you've got a very small space with relatively few tables. Turning those tables, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, is critical for the restaurant. That said, towards the end of a two-hour dinner with a friend, I do not appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant by a staff trying to take away my friend's clearly-not-finished plate every three or four minutes, being asked if we had decided on dessert two minutes after receiving the menu, and having our check plopped down on our table when we weren't even a quarter of the way through our dessert. I'm sorry if we exceeded your standard, expected time for dinner guests taking up valuable table space (90 minutes?), but two hours does not seem terribly excessive to me, and certainly does not seem worthy of such brusque, almost rude, service. \n\nThanks, but no thanks.

Convenience is great too - for someone who doesn't live in San Francisco - Marlowe is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away from the 4th & King Caltrain station.  Convenience is key, especially if I'm hungry.  The restaurant itself is rather small, and the bar was rather crowded when I went for dinner.  I had the risotto - the flavors were incredibly rich.  A friend of mine had the burger with garlic fries - perfectly crisp with fresh aioli.  The wine list is quite good, and for anyone that likes sweet wine I would highly recommended trying one of their dessert wines.  The service was great - our waiter was quite attentive.  As a tip, I would highly recommend a reservation here!", "author": "Jessica T."}

When my husband showed me the menu for our date night, I had already planned in my head what I wanted. When we finally got there tonight, I executed that very plan - baked oysters, duck liver mousse, roasted bone marrow. Yes cholesterol!!! My arteries sing in delight. We got the pork chops for main course. Oh my everything was delightful. Usually I am not too fond of baked oysters cos sometimes it tends to be overlooked but this was just amazing. The duck liver was in a generous pot and if u run out of crostini, they are generous about replenishing. The duck liver came with a side of figs and some mustard dressing. Loved it but the highlight of the evening was the roasted bone marrow. Wonderful presentation and the bone marrow was like butter when u spread it on the crostini. And the tapenade on the side with its acidity helped to cut the fat. Grilled pork chops were sooo yummy with that brioche bread pudding. Totally unique pairing unlike the usual potatoes. Dessert was Amazing just a great way to end the evening and date night sans baby! We had the TCHO choc cake and the upside down apple crisp. I loved that both presentations were served in jars. The desserts werent too sweet which I loved and was balanced nicely with a savory touch. Ooooo!!! Service was soooo amazing and attentive. They are always checking to see how we are doin and they do so at appropriate timings. So we had requested for our pork chops to be cooked medium. They apologized telling us our pork chop was overdone so we had to wait a lil longer and they followed up another time afterward. I was really impressed at their quality control and attentiveness. I'd rather they be honest with me than me having to follow up with them. All in all, 5 stars, I'll be back for sure! Another plus is that they are rather kid-friendly it seems as we saw two families with kids there. Toddler age is best, it doesnt seem like they have high chairs. Reservations definitely recommended as they get crowded pretty fast.", "author": "Topazskye L."}

We were promptly seated and it was pretty busy and loud there at 1 pm. Our server was friendly and attentive even though she was juggling a whole bunch of tables. We shared the brussels sprout chips and the fries, which were both really good but of course greasy. The chips were really unique and you could definitely taste the lemon juice. The fries came with the horseradish aioli, but the fries really were well seasoned. They were medium sized with the skin left on. I also got a baked oyster to try since other Yelpers had amazing pictures of them. On the menu, they're described as chowder in the shell which I would definitely agree with. The delicious oysters were covered with cream, chives, and bacon. On my first bite, I tasted super chopped up potatoes and onions, along with a small oyster. The oyster was definitely very rich, so good thing I only ordered 1. \nL and I then shared a Little Gems Salad and the much raved Marlowe Burger. The Little Gems Salad consisted of shaved root vegetables like radishs and carrots in a mini butter lettuce bowl. Avocados were underneath the vegetables and the entire salad was covered in a citrus vinaigrette. Personally, I thought the salad had too much dressing, which was kind of salty. I liked the vegetables because they were really fresh and crisp. On the other hand, L didn't like the salad because of the dressing. \nThen we had the Marlowe Burger which came with a side of Cauliflower Gratin. The burger, made out of beef and a bit of lamb, was on a nice toasted bun with cheddar cheese, crisp bacon, horseradish aioli, and caramelized onions. I definitely tasted the lamb, which gave the meat a nice kick. Normally, I don't like cheese on my burger but it really worked well with the burger. Overall, I liked the burger but I wouldn't say it was the best. The cauliflower gratin was really rich, cheesy, and creamy. I would have preferred bigger chunks of cauliflower.\nThis was a pretty decent place for lunch and I would come back again, maybe before a game next year.", "author": "Fiona N."}

The chicken was so tender, the green sauce perfect and the brussel sprouts out of this world.  He doesn't even like brussel sprouts!

The only thing ive had here that is worth commenting on is the burger. I had high expectations going in and was not disappointed. So delicious and fresh! I will say that it's not your huge juicy hamburger that you might be used to, more of a smaller gourmet type burger. It actually left me wanting another one!! The brussel sprouts that we heard so much about were a let down. Fried and dripping with ridiculous amounts of butter and oil. Of course anything will taste good if you cook it like that but I would think a restaurant like Marlowe could do better. Service was excellent, atmosphere was fun and energetic before the baseball game.   I will say the only time I'll ever come here is before a giants game or if I'm randomly in the area. The meal was good but location is not. Also a side note, the rest od the menu looked reasonably priced but not much selection at all. If you come here get a burger!", "author": "Kate N."}

Luckily my party of two was able to get seats at the bar and get served right away. We started by sharing the Brussels sprout chips, which were crispy, lemony, and salty, and left me wanting more. I also had one of the deviled eggs, which, though I thought it was good, was pretty forgettable (as in, while writing this review, I almost forgot I had it). For entrees, my dining companion got the scallops and I got the Niman Ranch pork chop. First, let me say the portions at this place are super generous, then I will proceed to sing the praises of the pork chop. My pork chop, cooked medium per the chef's recommendation, was probably one of the best pork chops I've ever had. Every slice I cut was juicy, flavorful, and beautifully cooked. Yum. And I had just come back from Vegas and gorging myself on buffets and fine dining. It was mouthgasmically better than any cut of meat I had there. The sides were also delicious and my date kept stealing bites of my corn pudding. And since I returned the favor by stealing her scallops, I can attest that the pan-seared scallops were also quite delicious. Service at the bar was very friendly and attentive, and the food came out quickly.

The place was not too busy. The food was excellent. We had the eggs, the sprout chips, the baked oysters, the polenta and the NY steak. The steak was alright but everything else was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the upside down peach crisp for desert and ended up sending it back because all we got was ice cream in a jar. They modified it by adding some crumbs but it was nothing like what we expected. Service at the bar was so-so. The lady was not friendly, not very attentive, and had greasy hair. We sat there with empty plates and empty glasses right in front of her nose for at least 10 mins and then finally had to ask her to take stuff away and get us the check. \n\nDuring my second attempt the service was much better but the food was so-so. When I saw the same lady serving the bar area (hair even greasier than the first time!), we opted for seats at the community table. The place was insanely busy - every seat in the house was taken. We ordered some of my prior favorites (eggs, polenta) and a few new things like steak tar tar, and a side of Brussels sprouts (not to be confused with Brussels sprout chips). The eggs were a little dry and one of them was simply broken apart. They were nothing like what I had the first time. The polenta was also a little dryer and the poached egg on top of the dish was clearly overdone. The Brussels sprouts were burned and we had to send them back. I don't know who allowed this dish to leave the kitchen because they were completely black. They had them redone for us though and took the dish off the bill (without us complaining or asking them to do so). The steak tar tar was pretty good.\n\nMy absolute favorite is still the polenta. My least favorite is the lady manning the bar area. I will definitely be back for more food.", "author": "Alina B."}

I had read about the roast chicken on some SF food blog and that enticed my desire to dine here.  We started with the toasted pistachios.  Personally, I could have done without these, but my partner wanted them.  Next we had the roasted bone marrow: absolutely delicious and set the stage for the rest of the meal.  For entr\u00e9es, my partner ordered the roast chicken, and I ordered the Marlowe burger.  We did this with the expectation or sharing, but it was nearly impossible to get any of the chicken from him.  The burger was good, but I wanted chicken too!  From the chicken that I did manage to snag, it was moist, had a pesto-y marinade/coating (my understanding is that the \"flavor\" changes often and I see that it is different on the menu online).  The burger was cooked to my liking and I enjoyed it; I don't have a ton to say about it--I wish I would have tried one of the other menu options because I feel like burgers are everywhere.\n\nFor me, what really set Marlowe above the rest was the service.  We had reservations and arrived about 10 minutes early thinking we'd grab a drink at the bar.  The bar was full of people eating, but the host cleared a spot for us at a table that was waiting for the reservation to come in.  The host was pleasant and accommodating without us requesting any \"special\" treatment--I would have been perfectly happen standing.  Without much waiting, our table became available.  The waitress was prompt, politely, and appropriately disappeared and appeared when needed.\n\nAll in all, I would go back to Marlowe.

Usually, medium rare patties come either mushy and wet or charbroiled dry. The pattie was perfectly crispy on the outside but super moist and delicious on the inside (perfectly grilled the way I like it). And you can really taste the char-grilled taste of the burger meat without it being dry. How do they do that? I initially thought they must've used wood grill chips and asked the waiter, but he said that they didn't. Anyway, it was amazing. It came with thinly cut fries (similiar to pomme frittes) but a tad thicker. They were perfectly fried and came with a horseradish aioli sauce. Mmmmm, that sauce was absolutely delicious!

But if you want a fabulous hamburger served with more than just 10 excellent french fries in a beautiful atmosphere where you can easily be heard, with piano music playing in the background and very friendly service, go to the bar at Seasons (in the Four Seasons).

Maybe that's why I have to give them only three stars. When a restaurant in SF comes so highly recommended, you expect nothing but the best. Marlowe had some aspects of this. The waitstaff, for example, was a flawless example of what a waitstaff should be. I called in around 8 last Friday night and was told by a friendly British accented voice we could not get a table until 9:30 but the walk-in time for a seat at the bar or a community table was only 25 minutes. The hostess recognized me when we came in and said the wait was now only 15 and could she get us drinks while we waited. She was just the nicest person and seemed genuinely interested in helping have a nice experience. We were seated at the bar in only about 5 minutes! Score. The bartender, again, was a fantastic person to be helped by. He knew the menu well and was very friendly and accommodating to all our requests. He kept by water glass filled all night. The ambiance was small and nice. Dim lighting, a good date setting. The food runners were very nice too. So why the three stars (i'm even beginning to ask myself this question!)? I think it was just the food. My friend and I got the Burrata, the brown butter brussel sprouts and the burger. The buratta was yummy but just not as fantastic as at other places. They serve it with tomato marmalade, crispy capers and smoked chili. The flavors overwhelmed the buratta for me. The brussel sprouts (which I generally go nuts for at places like Frances and Flour + Water) were just mediocre. The burger, again, was fine, but nothing I'd go back for. The bun was a bit too big for the meat and there were no special flavors. Basically, this restaurant impressed me to death until I ate the food and then i was just a bit underwhelmed for all the word on the street around this place. It's worth a shot to try, but I don't think i'll be back with all the other great dining options around.", "author": "theresa v."}

Sinfully good corn soup; great burgers & fries; and friends' lamb & steak were cooked well and were flavorful. Limited but well chosen wine list. And the service was really, really great -- although our reservation had been misplaced, they made room for us, and our server was skilled and had a great sense of humor. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I had the Brussel Sprout chips and have to say its the best way to eat that vegetable. The polenta was delicious and the desserts were served in jars that not only made the presentation but delivered delicious bites of sweet treats.  will definitely go there when i'm in san francisco next.", "author": "vanessa h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-26", "description": "I liked it as South and I like it as Marlowe. The wine list had plenty of fine wines that we enjoyed tremendously. The brussel sprout chips and pistachios were AWESOME.  The Little Gem Salad was beautifully presented and was outstanding.  Others had the parsnip soup and spicy prawns. - both were tasty and the prawns were presented whole! All mains were delish! 2 x Steak Frites, 1 x Lamb and 1 x Burger. The cauliflower gratin was scrumptious.  The healthy mash - it is good. - nothing spectacular.   We had all 3 desserts and shared them - the Chocolate pot de creme was decadent. The service was great - cutlery was down when it needed to be, plates and glasses cleared appropriately.  It was crowed and lively but not loud.  The ambiance and decor was superb - rustic even. There were a few servers that had more than their fare share of oopsie daisy drops during the evening...I hope they have a great vendor for glasses and plates.", "author": "Christopher A."}

So like a dutiful lemming I showed up there at 5 this evening to check it out.  I liked the casual, modern atmosphere, the friendly staff (especially our server who was thin with curly hair), and the ability to watch hot people coming in and out.  Most superlative was the wine selection; I tried the Malbec and the Sangiovese, both of which were excellent.  The hamburger, I'll have to admit, was definitely not the best in SF, although I couldn't tell you what is (my current favorite is Trueburger but its in Oakland).  The fries however were the best in SF.  The lamb sounded good so I ordered that and it might just have been the best lamb chops I've ever had: two very thinly sliced chops, barely cooked, served with a merguez sausage, beans and spinach.  I also enjoyed the prawns, served whimsically with the cocktail sauce in a glass with celery stalks, as if it was a bloody martini (wish it was).  So MB might have been a bit off base but I'm sure glad I came anyway.", "author": "David T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-02", "description": "We decided to try out Marlowe since it is just around the corner from us but were also very sad to hear that South had gone under (no pun intended!) I think they did a great job with the small space and the vibe of the restaurant was very inviting and relaxing. I was excited to try the brussel spout chips based on other reviews and they were mighty tasty. They are definitely not healthy by any means since they are fried and tossed with lots of salt but that is part of the reason they are so good! The mains were ok. My friend ordered the Poulet vert (herb roasted chicken) which was good but nothing special. I ordered the lamb mixed grill which was good, but for $24 I really did expect something better. We decided to try dessert since they had a Meyer lemon curd cake which sounded delicious. Sadly it wasn't. It had reasonably good flavor but the texture of it was almost like pudding and a bit mushy. The server we had was very good and was also very pleasant which is a plus in my book. I would give Marlowe 3.5 stars if I could give half stars. One of the downsides I think is the menu price point. Marlowe isn't overly pricey by any means, but I think it may be a bit high for their food.", "author": "M S."}
