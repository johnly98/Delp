My husband and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary last Friday. Upon checking in with the host, I was concerned. The restaurant was pretty loud and lively. Not what I expected. However, we were seated In the front room with three other tables. A card wishing us a happy anniversary was on the table. The ambiance in that room was perfect. \n\nAndrew was our server. He was absolutely perfect.  He made thoughtful suggestions on the menu, drinks and was attentive but never intrusive. \n\nThe food was pretty good. I liked my heirloom tomato salad.

I am more into... using best ingredients and simplifying a dish to perfect...Minimalist...Not into the idea of adding things to a recipe to make it better (i.e. American omelet) kind of person. I have high respect for traditional cooking skills as a chef. Did Spruce omelet meet my expectations? YES! I wold say it was one of the best omelet I had in San Francisco. Loved the delicate velvety texture with the brie on top adding great aroma and mouth feel. Only one complaint, they could plate it better. I wiped off some splash of egg on the plate before taking the picture.\n\nFreshly baked bread choices were interesting and were delicious compliment to the omelet. I was not so into their Salads though. The French Fries were perfect. They had extensive domestic and French wine list. I had Pascal Cl\u00e9ment Puligny-Montrachet 2016 with the Omelet \n\nThe upscale but comfortable decor and the traditional white linen service added to the experience.      \n\nNeed to go back for their caviar soon!

That burger is not an appetizer despite being on the appetizer menu. When you share food, they also take the time to split the portion onto 2 beautifully-plated plates.

That said, after all these years Spruce still might have the best burger in San Francisco. \n\nI had a lunch meeting with a couple of peeps this past week and decided that the bar at spruce would be a good option. Naturally we all ordered the burger and I selected blue cheese to sit atop the glorious patty of beef. The bun on this burger is a house made English muffin and holds up incredibly well. It's not a messy burger, in fact it's pretty much like the restaurant itself: clean, polished and upscale. \n\nMy only complaint was the exorbitant fee for corkage...especially at lunch. They charged us $50 dollars to open up an outside bottle of wine!!! That's insane and almost criminal. I get that this is a nice restaurant but, even some 2 star Michelin places aren't anywhere near that...insane. \n\nService was fantastic, I'll definitely be back but, not with a bottle of my own.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

It's one of the few high end restaurants that serves lunch and this review is specific to their lunch experience.\n\nI dined here with my coworkers and ordered everything on their lunch menu. Every item had bold flavors and careful presentation worthy of their 1-Michelin star but their lunch menu isn't as unique as their dinner menu so I would expect your experience to be even better than mine if you came for dinner (with an appropriate increase in cost).\n\nThe establishment is well lit, very spacious, and fairly quiet for lunch. Large tables make this a great restaurant for big groups. \n\nI loved everything about Spruce and while their lunch selections are fairly \"normal,\" I still consider Spruce to be one of the best lunch spots in the city.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Waiters and Servers were amazing but the food was just above average but not on par with other Michelin Star's in my opinion. And the Spruce menu was quite sparse.\n\nPresentation 3/5:\nQuite an interesting layout for a restaurant. Upon entering, there is a bar/lounge area to the right and numerous main tables to the left. It has the normal 'warm' lighting so it was quite dark. We had reservations for a Tuesday night, not busy at all, and were placed in an outside room. Although a part of the main restaurant, it was completely detached and had to leave out the front to enter the room through another door. This room had a fireplace with a painting/picture of a dog on top ('Spruce the Dog'?) and the doors didn't complete shut so there was a cold draft that came in despite us sitting close to the fire.\n\nCustomer Service 4/5:\nAs I mentioned, I don't understand why they put us in a separate room. There were numerous empty small tables inside the restaurant. We requested inside but the tables were reserved? We also had reservations so I don't understand what went on there.\n\nBesides that, the waiter was phenomenal and so were the servers. We didn't know that they gave complimentary bread and butter until halfway through out experience and after that, the gentleman came quite frequently.\n\nFood 3/5:\n\nComplimentary Bread - the cranberry loaf was the best, I don't know if one is supposed to put butter on that kind of 'sweet bread' but I did anyway\n\nCauliflower Veloute - this was quite tasty but the confit egg yolk didn't do much for me, the shrimp is DICED \n\nChantenay Carrot Soup - this was interesting, the turmeric was very prominent so it did have a strong curry taste\n\n(Both soups went great with the bread)\n\nHoney-Glazed 38 North Duck Breast - now this was the best thing on the menu. I wouldn't say that I have the qualifications to say, 'Duck was cooked to perfection' but I am going to say it anyway, the duck was cooked to perfection and the sauce pairing was exquisite.\n\nThey even brought me chocolate dessert for my birthday and a nice card. Thank you Spruce.\n\nOverall, customer service from waiter and servers were amazing, food was slight above average. I want to give this place another shot and hopefully next time, they won't sit us outside.", "author": "Tom P."}

From being greeted by the valet (even though I Uber'd), to the hostess, to our wonderful server and the dining room staff, service was spot on! The hostess took our coats and led us through a classy dining room to an intimate table for 5. Our server, Andrew, was great! He made recommendations, answered all of our many questions, was funny and personable! (And from SC like one of my colleagues, so they had a good talk!) The attention to detail from him and everyone else there is unsurpassed. When walking though the dining room with wine bottles, every server holds them facing out, label forward. Also, the MINUTE the last person at your table finishes a plate, 2-3 people swing by and clear all plates simultaneously!! Same with delivery, all meals presented at the same time. \n\nWe had Caesar salads to start. Very fresh and crisp. The Tuile on top (think of a thin wafer like crouton) was made of anchovy, and an innovative way to work in additional anchovy flavor. One person from our group didn't get a salad, and Andrew brought her the daintiest little cup of a squash soup to tide her over.\n\nWe were also given complimentary Gougeres (think cheese puff) made with gruyere. They were warm and practically melt in your mouth. We also had a choice of rolls or bread, served with butter with nice chunks of salt on top. Yumm!\n\nSeveral of us at the table had the Duck Breast. For one of my friends, it was her first time having duck. And, based on her reaction to this dish, she's hooked! It was a large portion, perfectly rare and juicy. Served with a fennel marmalade and pears and beets, it was sweet and juicy and crispy on top and honestly, perfect!!\n\n2 others had the Chicken Cordon Bleu that they shared was amazingly juicy wrapped in prosciutto! Another at our table opted for the Burger on a homemade English muffin with a fried egg on top. It was cooked to order, juicy, and overall, scrumptious! The fries were plump.\n\nWe got a few desserts. The Walnut Cheesecake and Chocolate cake were both good. Ever so slightly small, but the flavors made up for this. The real show stopper were the Beignets! They were perfectly golden brown, well sugared, and so dough-y yet bouncy on the inside at the same time. I would travel from FL to CA again just for these!\n\nFollowing our dessert, we were again brought a few complimentary plates ... Chilled Coconut Puffs and homemade marshmallows and then a little bit after, Pistachio Macaroons. Wow. A lot of flavor packed in a mini macaroon.\n\nHonestly, once of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. Stellar, actually. I highly recommend Spruce!", "author": "Rachel B."}

For how nice it looks inside, it isn't a huge space which adds to the overall appeal of eating here. You know that you are at a fine dining establishment, however, it doesn't feel as if you and every other person in the city are trying to get reservations adding to the unappealing tourist aspect of some high-end restaurants. But make note, this place is absolutely high-end. You can tell by the time and effort put into making each dish that is apparent from the first bite. \n\nWe started with a radish dish, probably my least favorite of the night, which really doesn't say much, only that everything else was amazing. Then I ordered the carrot soup. It was bold with flavor while spiced from a complex assortment of ingredients. I would absolutely order again. We were lucky enough to get a taste of the cauliflower soup as well. Now this soup was to die for. Probably my favorite bite of the night. \n\nMy entree was the chicken dish. It was cooked fabulously and the farro that accompanied it was firm yet flavorful. I am usually not a huge fan of the ancient grain, but they unlocked whatever secret it is to get it right.\n\nDessert was their beignets. If you eat only one thing at Spruce, make sure it is the beignets.

My only suggestion is that I wish they would have rendered the fat a touch more. The cheese cake was truly creative.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-30", "description": "I had the biggest smile on my face throughout my 3+ hour dining experience at Spruce last weekend. I was truly blown away because I've never experienced such attentive service at a restaurant before, and everyone we interacted with was so incredibly kind and genuine. They truly made us feel like royalty; there's no other way to put it.\n\nSpruce has an impressive and extensive drink menu and the food is top notch. Each dish is a carefully crafted work of art! Our server, Andrew, was extremely knowledgeable and provided great recommendations catered to our tastes and dietary restrictions. He also suggested the best drink pairings for each dish throughout the night, which made the overall dining experience that much better. The number of people who were standing around waiting on us, checking in with us, and always making sure the table was clean was remarkable. At a restaurant like this, you don't just come for the food; you come for the impeccable service.\n\nBut I don't mean to undermine the food--it was incredible. We started with the Golden Osetra Caviar with creme fraiche, potato blini, scrambled eggs, and brioche, paired with a nice glass of Pierre Paillard champagne. This was my first time trying caviar and I wasn't sure if I'd like it but WOW. It was so buttery and divine, and I really enjoyed it with the brioche and creme fraiche! They had three different types of caviar but Andrew recommended this one when I told him I hadn't tried it before, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Next, we had foie gras with poached rhubarb and hibiscus gelee, paired with a 2006 Chateau Climens Sauternes. The foie gras was so rich that it literally melted in your mouth, and I loved how the rhubarb and hibiscus gelee elevated the flavor compared to foie gras I've had in the past. The Sauternes was also one of my favorite drinks of the night! Very sweet but VERY delicious with the foie gras. For entrees, we shared the risotto verde with sherry-braised black trumpet mushrooms and fava beans paired with a ros\u00e9, poached Alaskan halibut with artichokes barigoule and pioppini mushrooms, and butter poached Maine lobster with brassicas, gnocchi, and sauce americaine paired with Chardonnay. All the entrees were well-balanced and satisfying but the risotto was outstanding, with so many complex layers of flavor and texture. We finished off the meal with some dessert to satisfy our sweet tooth: rhubarb tart with Sicilian pistachio gelato and chantilly cream and pear and huckleberries with cinnamon cremeux, vanilla shortbread, and pear sorbet. The desserts were delectable but light enough to where you could finish the entire thing without being overwhelmed. I had a macchiato with my dessert and my sister had fresh jasmine tea, which was a tea lover's dream! I'm still in awe that I somehow made room for all of this food and drink but I guess it's hard not to when everything is THAT good, right? \n\nThe restaurant's ambiance is elegant, with a classic yet modern feel: marble bar, high ceilings, glass wall, studded leather chairs, and natural skylight. There is also a cafe with limited seating out front, which serves their famous, larger-than-life cookies and drinks. Spruce is located in a quiet residential area and there's street or valet parking available. \n\nFrom start to finish, the service was unparalleled, and not once did we feel rushed while we were taking our sweet time enjoying each course. This was hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had, and it really set the bar high for future fine dining adventures! I'm so glad I ventured outside of my comfort zone to try something new because I wouldn't have known what I'd been missing out on. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for an upscale, pampering dining experience. I can't thank the Spruce team enough for an unforgettable evening.

Only $3 dollars, you can eat the most delicious beignet in the world. Here was $13.)Had a 12yrs steak and  burger. The steak was kind of disappointing. It was around $53.

I was really excited to try out a Michelin star restaurant. However, I can see why they don't have it anymore. \nParking is either street parking or valet. We were lucky enough to find street parking with no meter half a block away.\nThe restaurant itself is very grand and spacious. Lots of velvet seats and a see through glass in the middle to look at the bar.\nService is friendly but got less attentive as the night went on... I understand it's busy but we shouldn't be waiting to get water or to get your attention.\n\nCharcuterie selection was okay for me, but that's because I'm not really into meats and cheeses. \nI ordered the sauteed scallops and those were the best! \nFoie gras, prepared two ways, was okay as well. I did not like the gel very much. \nMy boss ordered the maine lobster, as it was the special of the day. When it came out, we were very surprised. $60+ for a little ball of lobster?! Ridiculous... Server raved about how spectacular it was but we were very disappointed. \n\nFor dessert, the soleil d'or mousse was amazing! Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate with kahlua ice cream!

Located in an area surrounded by cute little boutiques and shops, we really enjoyed the mini walk from the car to the restaurant. With a reservation at 8:00pm, some of us arrived early and was taken into the dining area to this circular table right in front of this extensive wine wall stocked with bottles and bottles of wine. From the looks of it, those working the wine wall gets to taste a shit ton of wine! The ambiance was dark and quite romantic yet sophisticated. \n\nAs we waited for the rest of the party to arrive, our server, Daniel, chit chatted with us about the drinks menu. After browsing through their menu, we decided on:\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Steak Tartare ($17): not bad but not great.. came with a raw egg yolk in the middle that we mix in with the steak tartare and dip the bread in. The steak tartare was just ok; loved the texture but it was flavorless. The bread was super soft tho. \n- Turnip Soup ($18): bland \n- Fisherman's Mussels ($18): good amount of mussels and flavorful.\u00a0\n- French Fries ($6): can't say much but that it was just plain ol' salty fries...\n- Asparagus ($17): meh.... nothing great. 4 pieces of cold asparagus with not much taste....def not worth $17, imo. :\\\n\nENTREES:\n- Lobster ($65): WOW ... my cousin really anticipated this entree and she was taken by surprised by the whole thing... the entree was like a soup and had a lobster that was literally the size of a scoop of ice-cream. She said it smelled better than it tasted. \n- New York Steak ($55): two ladies got this and they said it was ok. Although the steak did come out in the right temp as requested, the taste and overall flavors weren't jaw dropping good especially for the price... and portion \n- Duck Breast ($43): I, along with 5 others, got this dish and I for one, was pretty content with it. The duck breast was delicious and flavorsome. The meat was cooked just right and tender. They also incorporated some veggies to the dish which helped balanced out the flavors.\n\nDESSERT:\nHonestly, after our not so satisfying and average yet expensive meal, we were gonna pass on the dessert. Then Daniel brought out a lot of goodies and I can pretty much say this was the part where we can all agree on enjoying.\u00a0\n\nSERVICE:\nDaniel is an exceptional and fantastic server. Throughout our meal, he would pop in every so often to refill empty wine glasses and to ask if we needed anything. He was super thorough when explaining the dishes on the menus and he gave us some good cocktail suggestions. We were definitely taken by surprised when he brought out those desserts even when we passed on it. My cousin even got a birthday dessert! So sweet of him! The other waiters that helped cleared our table and refilled our water were all really polite and professional as well.\u00a0\n\nIn total, our bill was ~$845 plus tip and a $38 SFEME surcharge. Probably not gonna come back anytime soon.. but maybe one day.\n\nP.S. The complimentary bread and butter were so yummy. I especially loved the cranberry bread.", "author": "Anissa D."}

Lovely and quiet. \n\nBar menu was different from the main dining hall, so I opted for the latter, just to enjoy a full experience. Spruce does not serve tasting menu, so I paid extra attention when my waiter explained the courses. Seared scallop and the duck breast were the top two choices, so I opted for the duo. \n\nScallop - this is flawless. It was marinated so well that definitely preserved the full of taste. Mushroom only made the flavor more complex. The subtle smoke taste had marked a perfect finish. It was the queen of my heart. \n\nDuck breast - this is impressive. Every bite, I felt like it was dancing on my tongue. Reminded me the super delicious duck at EMP. Well, this one was larger in size, so clearly a winner from this aspect.\n\nWhen I was trying to order dessert, my waiter was very considerate and mentioned that the portion might be too large for me and suggested a half order. Yes, I did not even finish my half order, very much appreciate the heads-up. \n\nThis is truly my best experience so far. Felt love from each single dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-15", "description": "I am not even sure where to begin when reviewing this wonderful restaurant. I spent a good amount of time researching dinner places for my mom and myself in San Francisco. Spruce appealed to me because of the small but versatile menu, as well as the neighborhood feel. It also has one of the best wine lists in the country. So, I felt it was a promising choice for our dinner. And let me tell you, it was truly an exceptional dining experience.\n\nFirstly, Spruce is nestled in quaint neighborhood about 3 miles from the Financial District. From the outside, it seemed quiet and small. However, the restaurant is quite large on the inside and was very lively at 8:30pm on a Thursday. It is definitely an upscale atmosphere, but also cozy and inviting. \n\nThe service at Spruce is impeccable. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the extensive wine list and explained each item on the menu in detail. He even offered suggestions on what to pair together and his wine choices were perfect. \n\nWe began with the Japanese kanpachi and ricotta starter. The kanpachi was truly phenomenal. It was served with raspberries, figs, avocado and peanuts and had the most fresh flavor. The ricotta starter was probably my favorite. It was filled inside of a dough and topped with pesto. It was light and refreshing with fantastic flavor.\n\nFor our entrees, I chose the steak and my mom chose the lobster. The steak was cooked perfectly and was served with lightly fried potatoes and topped with mushrooms. I really enjoyed this dish, as it was not too heavy but had great flavor. My mom truly enjoyed her lobster dish! She said it was quite rich, but very enjoyable.\n\nI did not think I was hungry for dessert, but I had to try the peach cobbler. I am so happy with that decision. The peaches were very fresh and served with a sweet corn ice cream. It was the perfect pairing and was served with a sweet corn muffin. \n\nOverall, Spruce is an amazing restaurant that is worth its Michelin star and steep prices. The presentation of the meal was outstanding, as well as the flavor. I was beyond pleased with my choice to dine here and I would love to return soon. Thank you for a wonderful night!", "author": "Colleen B."}

I've had their incredible burger (my favorite in the city), but I also had the chance to try some of the other brunch offerings:\n\n-Buttermilk Pancakes: these are not ordinary pancakes...they're thick, rich and perfectly buttery. They arrive with sliced almonds and honey butter. If you want a decadent take on a traditional breakfast favorite, this is it. 25 Lusk used to have a similar pancake when they offered brunch and this is a good replacement.\n\n-Pastrami Hash: an extremely flavorful take on an American classic, this has kimchi and purple potatoes with flavorful pieces of pastrami...very good.\n\n-Beignets: probably the softest, lightest and perfectly cooked beignets I've ever had. They arrive with a fruit compote and rich cr\u00e8me anglaise...a great way to start of finish a meal.\n\n-Cinnamon Rolls: These were tasty treats with the perfect amount of sweetness...the cream cheese frosting perfectly balanced the entire dish.

I went for their Restaurant Week menu and would recommend the cauliflower veloute as an appetizer, which had an amalgamation of complimentary flavors of shrimp, garlic, egg yolk, cauliflower and parsley. I found the kale to be only modestly dressed with dressing and croutons. \n\nAlthough I'm not a huge fan of burgers, I can say that I have never seen an English muffin bun on a burger. For those skeptical and wary, let me tell you that this is no ordinary English muffin your mom used to make you for breakfast. Honestly, i didn't even know English muffins could be artisanal, fluffy and thick the one that sandwiched Spruce's burger patty (which btw was comparable in size to one of the buns). The patty was oozing with juice, lightly seared on all surfaced and cooked medium to perfection. \n\nThe duck was on the small side and 70% crispy, 30% not crispy (seriously, not your average Asian deli roasted duck). My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed how the oil oozed out of the skin as we crunched through every bite. The ricotta ravioli could have been left out of this dish, as it added no complementary flavors nor was it dressed in any of the existing or new sauces. \n\nThe best was definitely saved for last. The chocolate mousse with coffee ice cream, cocoa nibs and Macallan was a dessert made in heaven. The dish showcased many textures but maintained a very rich experience throughout. Heaven in your mouth. I'm coming back just for this one.", "author": "Alexis Y."}

Overall I liked Spruce but I think for what we paid (~$450 ish for two) there are more delicious meals to be had in the city. I can only really remember how beautiful the plating was, but the taste of the food is forgettable and all I can remember is that the (beautiful!) corn soup was hard for me to finish because of the sweetness, and that they sometimes employ the same plates as Le Bernardin haha! \n\nThings I really liked:\n- Huge wine list.

The cheddar cheese was fine and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. The pickles and red onion were also crunchy with the right balance of sweet and acidic flavor. \n\nThe bun and bacon were disappointments.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-30", "description": "Came here for RW after hearing that their burger is a must-eat in SF. It was quite a magnificent burger and hard to wrap your mouth around (quite literally) and very filling. Meat was cooked well though it was underseasoned. It comes with a side of duck fat fries that compliments the burger very well. I liked the peach sorbet for dessert but I would have preferred something alongside it that didn't remind me of a brownie bite. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't say it would be worth its usual price tag of $19. Also, be wary of the add-ons as some toppings can add up to nearly $9 (like the talleggio cheese and grilled onions!).\n\nThe clientele is on the older side. Everyone seemed to be dressed up for a noon lunch (except me who came unashamedly lugging in two TJ bags). Service was spot on -- not too overbearing and very professional. A+. Best service I've ever experienced in SF.\n\nI wouldn't come if it wasn't for RW since I feel like I did get a very good deal (appetizer, burger, dessert == $25! which is less than their usual price for one entree).", "author": "Cindy W."}

Outstanding service but food didn't consistently impress\n\nMy friend and I made reservations for Sunday brunch for SF Restaurant week. Honestly, without the $25 menu, I don't think I would have been willing to make it out to Spruce with its $$$$ prices.\n\nThe ambiance and service definitely match that price tag. Incredibly friendly, knowledgeable waiters who were so attentive, they could even sense when my friend and I wanted a photo together. It's definitely on the nicer, classier side (think table cloths being ironed on the table) but still not necessarily super fancy (clientele were still casually dressed). The space has tall ceilings and some natural lighting, and while the tables weren't very far apart, the general spaciousness gave it a quiet, elegant atmosphere. Great for a special occasion.\n\nThere were 2 options for the starter and main course on the SFRW menu, plus dessert, so we ordered one of each and shared between the two of us. I was honestly a little disappointed by the food. The Heirloom Pumpkin Soup was a winner and sort of set a high bar for the rest of the meal, which sadly fell short, especially the much raved about Spruce Burger. \n\nFor $25 though, I was satisfied, especially given the quality of service and overall experience. If I were ever looking for a nice, upscale dining experience, I'd come back and try some of their other food.\n\n* HEIRLOOM PUMPKIN SOUP (normally $16) - 5/5\n[ginger creme fraiche ice cream, brown butter, pumpkin seeds]\nThis soup was easily the highlight of our meal. The pumpkin soup itself had a natural sweetness to it that was complemented with the tangy ginger creme fraiche. Soo creamy and rich yet somehow still delicate and light. I liked the added texture and crunch from the pumpkin seeds too. I'd come back just for a giant bowl of this soup.\n\n* GEM LETTUCE SALAD (normally $14) - 3.5/5\n[gorgonzola dolce, apple, walnuts]\nNot much to write about. Simple salad, familiar tastes, but the walnut puree was a nice touch and the gorgonzola/blue cheese wasn't too strong or rotten-tasting\n\n* SPRUCE BURGER (normally $19) - 3/5\n[english muffin, french fries]\nHonestly just okay. The burger patty was a nice medium rare but I was expecting a juicier burger. The fixings were standard: lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard. I liked the crisp fries more than the burger\n\n* SPRUCE EGGS BENEDICT (normally $24) - 4.5/5\n[poached jidori eggs, beech mushrooms, 'nduja]\nMy friend wasn't too fond of this because she found the dish to be too salty, but I enjoyed it and thought it was a more unique benedict. The 'nduja (some sort of soft, spicy pork paste) was definitely heavy on the salt but I loved the spiciness so much, it balanced out the salt for me. The eggs were beautifully poached and the runny yolk also helped tame the saltiness.\n\n* CHOCOLATE BOUCHON - 4.5/5\n[white chocolate cremeux, pear sorbet, vanilla sable]\nI was a little skeptical of the chocolate brownie because it looked too much like the petite brownie bites from Costco and was pretty hard on the outside, but once broken, the inside was soft and gooey, decadent and sweet. The pear sorbet was divine, like someone had taken a scoop out of a pear and just frozen it to iciness without adding anything to it.", "author": "Jessie L."}

I made a note on the reservation with my boyfriend's name and mentioned that it was his birthday, and we were seated at a table with a Happy Birthday card. Nice touch! Service throughout the meal was super helpful and attentive, which is exactly what I'd expect from a white linen Michelin star restaurant.\n\nNow allow me ramble about the food:\n\n- Complimentary bread & butter: That night they had a selection including baguettes, wheat bread, and cranberry bread. They weren't warm, but they still tasted fresh. Cranberry bread was our favorite! \n\n- Complimentary nori popcorn: An unexpected small surprise. We finished this really quickly because they were pretty addicting\n\n- Steak tartare with gruyere puffs: As a self-professed egg yolk lover, the first thing I noticed was that the jidori egg yolk on top had an amazing dark, rich color. Definitely not any old egg from the grocery store. I wish I had gotten a photo, but the server mixed it as soon as it was brought to our table. The tartare was well-seasoned, with the capers not overpowering the flavors, and it was absolutely amazing with the light cheesy puffs of goodness as opposed to the typical crostini.\n\n- Foie gras on pumpkin waffle: The dish originally comes with two waffles, but they split it on two plates for us. There was sweetness from the pumpkin waffle, candied pecan, and persimmon, but somehow, it all worked together with the rich, savory foie gras. Is foie gras ever anything short of amazing though? This was no exception.\n\n- Ricotta dumplings: A lot cheesier than I expected, but in a good way. Cheese lovers, I highly recommend this. It was rich without being too heavy, and that cauliflower polenta was the most delicious form of cauliflower I've ever had.\n\n- Mediterranean branzino: Really liked the presentation. What appeared to be scales on the skin of the fish was actually thinly sliced, cooked celery root that were layered to look this way on top of a skinless fillet. Taste wise, this was good, but I didn't think the actual fish was as good as the accompanying lobster butter sauce.\n\n- Crispy duck breast: Definitely the most tender duck I've ever had, and the skin was nice and crispy just as they describe the dish on the menu. The beans and celery root that it came with on the side sounds boring, but it was super flavorful. I wish everyone knew how to cook vegetables like that.\n\n- Complimentary currant cake: This was another touch that they included because it was my boyfriend's birthday. It's something they give out for free, but I'm sure they could easily put it on the menu and charge for it because it was great.\n\n- Fall spice cake: Included seasonal persimmons also, which went great with the cake, speculoos crisps, and pumpkin ice cream. A satisfying dessert that wasn't too sweet!\n\nOverall, absolutely would recommend Spruce for special occasions!", "author": "Sara L."}

Pacing was atrocious and simple things were missed.  VERY disjointed experience from the staff.\n\nFood:\n\nWife and I began with a scallop starter and smoked burata starter.\n\nScallop came perfectly cooked on a bed of mushroom ragout and \"corn fondue\".  The ragout and sauce was interesting but the flavors didn't pair well with the scallops and shouldn't have been in the same bowl.\n\nThe \"Ignalat Smoked Burratina\" was too firm (old?) and lacked any taste.  The yuzu marinated stone fruit was pleasant but the flavors didn't match up and the textures were wrong.\n\nFor dinner my wife ordered the \"14 day aged Flannery New York\" which she enjoyed.  The steak was cut into chunks and the pieces varied in temperature but the flavor was good especially with the sauce perigueux.  The pommes paillasson tasted EXACTLY like formed potato cakes (which they are) but were too thick as they were soggy.\n\nI wasn't excited about any of the offerings so I took a left turn and went with the caviar selection at $200.  The caviar itself was nice but the presentation was very weak.  Provided along with the caviar was blini, soft scrambled egg, brioche, cr\u00e8me fraiche, butter, and a tiny touch of chives.  Food on a white plate can be stylish or just food on a white plate.\n\nUnfortunately the blini were wet in the center as they were undercooked and when I asked for more they were wet as well. The brioche was fine but I had to request another piece as the portion was small and the blini were not to par.  And by \"request\" I mean I has to wait quite a while to get someone's attention.\n\nHad coffee and dessert.  Coffee did not come with cream or sugar but the dessert was a pleasant mille-feuille that I would have again.\n\nThis was a nice restaurant but it should not have a Michelin star.  Pricing is reasonable for San Francisco but there are so many other places in S.F. that I would not make a special trip.  Without the Michelin star I would have rated this restaurant a 3. Good and okay food, nothing impressive or really even interesting.", "author": "Josh D."}

NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\nWe've been very fortunate to dine at some nice restaurants in the USA as well as Europe and Asia. Spruce holds itself out as this class of restaurant.  I recommend you skip it. \n\nFirst, apparently Spruce enjoyed a Michelin Star rating until 2015. With the level of unprofessional service both from the management as well as the Sommelier---it's not surprising they don't enjoy a Michelin rating.\n\nFor those of you visiting the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time--there is a financial boom occurring primarily due to the tech industry.  This results in pretentious restaurants like Spruce surviving and enjoying a false sense of arrogance without merit. I don't mind it in Paris--yet, they back it up with the food, wine and service. I suspect once the tech boom is over--Spruce will be kaput.\n\nWe dined with another couple in late December 2017. The next night we dined at a similar quality restaurant Gary Danko. Night and day difference--I strongly recommend you visit Gary Danko. They understand the importance of food, wine and service.  Spruce is a pretender. \n\nSpruce has a very extensive wine list. Probably 20 pages plus. Full of wines from all over the World. The dinner menu is minimal in comparison.  The food was very good, not great; yet, the lack of food selection is a real drawback. \n\nNow, back to the wine list---massive. This is the focus of the restaurant. Very high priced; yet, marginal quality for some varietals/vintage. Despite the extensive list--the sommelier seems moderately uninterested and somewhat uninformed. I wouldn't care if they didn't have this extensive wine list. Odd for a restaurant with such an extensive wine list. \n\nDo yourself a big favor--skip Spruce--a Falling Star...

After a 24 hour food-nomming rampage, I'm up on Yelp writing down all my delicious memories.\n\nOccasion: We came here for my company's holiday party last night. First up were drinks and passed hors d'ouevres at the restaurant's \"library,\" a little private space in the front of the restaurant. Ever since I started my current job, I've learned a lot of fancy (read: wealthy people) terms such as passed hors d'ouevres, barrel tasting, confit, magnum, etc...but that's a different story. The Moroccan lamb meatballs (super lamby in a comforting way! all the flavors blended nicely together)and Gougeres (mmm cheesy) were delicious. Definitely would eat again, 5/5. House cured bacon Gougeres and Harissa prawns were also pretty good (lots of different flavors, but again blended together well). They had a cute little fireplace as well.\n\nDInner was a fancy affair, and we had wine from the year before I was born...and I'm a couple years past the legal drinking age. Whoa. Sommelier came in to explain the wines we were having.\n\nHad a warm burratta cheese with onion naan bread as an appetizer-- kind of reminded me of a more rich mozzarella cheese stick (which I suppose it is). The naan bread outer layer was a bit thick for me and didn't taste too much like onion. I guess the autumn fruits were made into a sauce under the naan bread, wasn't sure where this was supposed to go and didn't really complement the bread in my opinion. Chicory salad was a good contrast from the creaminess of the rest of the dish. Had a spoonful of the heirloom pumpkin soup from a friend and the flavors were very nice and complex-- again, they all went well together.\n\nGrilled ribeye as my main-- I like my red meat to taste meaty, and while this was very tender and perfectly medium rare, it didn't taste meaty. Kale was very flavorful / buttery, but heavily drenched in oil. Mushrooms were SUPER buttery, which I love. I thought the word \"foraged\" before the word \"mushrooms\" was entertaining. I guess it's a distinction from farmed mushrooms?\n\nVanilla panna cotta with citrus spicy granola and a peach sorbet-- definitely a very vanilla-y panna cotta, but I wasn't blown away by it. Peach sorbet was enjoyable and refreshing. I got a taste of my friend's chocolate mousse and it was also tasty.\n\nAmbiance was quite enjoyable-- reminded me of a very understated but fancy, dimly lit living room. I enjoyed being able to look at the various wines they have in storage since they have the storage with glass windows so you can see the wines. Servers were super conscious about letting you pass first-- kind of reminded me of the time I was at Minnesota's St. Paul airport and a guy who anticipated our paths cross seven feet later stopped and motioned for me to pass him. I thought it was interesting watching the servers try to present dishes to everyone at the table at the same time...though they didn't quite make it. Our private room in the backup also had a festive Christmas tree and lights set up. A bit loud in the main dining room area. I also liked the little area in the hallway where you could watch the chefs prepare and cook the food.\n\nThe only somewhat odd thing was that instead of getting a number for coat check, the woman asked me to describe my coat when picking it up. \n\nAs others have said, food is simple but tasty, which I definitely echo. What was surprising to me is that the food was actually human-sized as opposed to other expensive restaurants wiith food for mini-people, basically. Food is a 3.5 for me, but the way that the various flavors that they have all blend well in the dish is something that seems to be sort of rare in SF. Setting and service definitely bumps it up to a 4.\n\nNow that I think about it, I think this might be my fist Michelin star restaurant! Gonna come back with family at some point to try things others recommend-- beignets with creme anglaise, crispy duck, veal sweetbreads, etc. Can't wait!", "author": "Nicole H."}

It can even be $$ if you only go for their famous cookies, featured on 7x7's things to eat in SF before you die.\n\nThe Harvest Lunch consists of a 3-course set which changes weekly. The selections are surprisingly good value; I was quite satisfied with the caviar and crab when I went. $38 for food, +$15 for wine pairing is reasonable given fancy places of SF charge around the same price or more (and that several Restaurant Week menus rack up prices for a salad, a burger, and a brownie). However, they do charge a hefty 6% extra for the health tax, while other places tend to charge 4% or just include it as employee benefits as they should. Anyways, the noms:\n\nTo start, there was complimentary sourdough and/or cranberry BREAD and salted butter; of course I opted for both. Fresh artisan bread with a pillowy degree of softness never disappoints, though the butter was extremely hard and difficult to spread (even with the fancy spreading knife silverware).\n\nThe Smip Ranch green garlic VELOUT\u00c9 with white pepper cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche was luscious and velvety. The earthiness and subtle spiciness contrasted the heavy seafood flavors of the paddle fish caviar, and the crumbled brioche added yet another complexity. I don't even like caviar, and I really admired how meticulous and sophisticated the composition was. \n\nAt first glance the dungeness crab RISOTTO appeared somewhat small, but it's the richest rendition of the risotto I've ever had. The creaminess \u00e0 la mac n cheese gives it the familiarity of comfort food, and the shredded crab paired well with the lemony notes, complemented by the salsa verde and a layer of olive oil. Although it seems a little too wet, causing the risotto to lose some of the graininess, overall the risotto was exquisite and memorable. The baby kale chips added a crispy flair, reminding of the paper-thin fried basil of Chinese dishes.\n\nTo finish, the CARROT TRIO was a satisfying dessert. I don't know whether it was my fault for taking so long to photograph my food or that physics mandate alcohol elevate freezing points, but my bourbon glac\u00e9 was much more melted than I would have liked. On the plus side, it was deliciously alcoholic, even more so than Ice Cream Bar's alcoholic sundaes. I didn't find the carrot cake to be too special, but the walnut profiterole was sublime: the walnut-infused creamy interior coated by a delicately crisp exterior was like an ultra high-end cream puff.\n\nYes, it feels like a bouge clubhouse, with the dark brown accents, elegant architecture, lush seating, and dressed-up servers--for a classy place like its $$$$ designation and consistent Michelin star status, you're not going to be basking in mason jars, exposed unfinished wooden beams, naked edison bulbs, and hipster servers in plaid shirts. \n\nBut contrary to some Yelpers' complaints about stuffiness, I found Spruce to be exceptionally inviting, as the servers were very warm and also professional in keeping me updated on as the dishes were being prepared.\n\nThe side cafe features lunch fare, as well as Spruce's signature COOKIES. They are huge! And serious. The texture is absolutely outstanding, consisting of a crunchy edge with a gradient to a soft cakey center. \n- My favorite was the decadent chocolate chip, which features interestingly thin pieces of chocolate though the spacing is quite heterogeneous (there are large pieces of cookie without chocolate). \n- The snickerdoodle best exemplifies the amazing texture, but could use more cinnamon.\n- Unexpectedly, my least favorite was the oatmeal raisin which is usually my preferred cookie. Although I appreciated the creative incorporation of golden raisins, cranberries, and dried apricots, there is an insane amount of sugar and it tastes obscenely caramelized. Also, the oatmeal takes away from the perfected texture of the other cookies.\n- The cookies total to $4.60 each, which is pricey but expected for the size (and the ritzy location)\n\nThe verdict? Despite the elitist posh ambiance so characteristic of Pac Heights, Spruce was cordial and an overall excellent dining experience. The food lives up to the reputation.", "author": "Edna C."}

He told me that the waitress wasn't very experienced. He offered nothing to make up for it, not even a cookie.\n\nI expect restaurants to train their staff adequately. I expect restaurants like Spruce to train their staff superbly. If a restaurant wants my help training its staff it can invite me to a soft opening. I left the restaurant frustrated and annoyed. It was not a good experience.\n\nSome examples:\n1. One of my guests ordered iced tea. There were no spoons on the table. The waitress failed to bring a spoon with the tea. She disappeared. My guest ended up using her butter knife to stir the sugar in her tea.\n2. A couple of times I needed something for the table. I looked around for the waitress. She was nowhere to be found. I sat there, my neck craned for somewhere between five and ten minutes waiting for her to appear so that I could catch her eye and call her over.\n3. We had a toddler with us. He became restless and it became clear that we needed to wrap things up. His father took him out of the restaurant to wait outside while I waited with his mother to pay the check. I turned around in my chair to look for the waitress and ask for the check. It was a good ten minutes before she appeared. \n4. Shortly after this whole process began, my friend got up to go to the ladies' room. I finally got the check to sign at about the time she returned - easily ten minutes later.\n5. When the waitress finally appeared I asked her to bring the check. She started to clear the table. I asked her to bring the check immediately, not after she'd cleared the table. \n6. When the waitress brought the check I had my credit card out. I asked her to wait while I reviewed the bill. She left the check and disappeared. I had to wait again for her to come back and take the card and get the payment processed. \n7. As we were finishing our main course the waitress appeared to ask when we'd like dessert. She asked if we'd like it \"in about ten minutes\". I've gone to a lot of restaurants in my time, from Le Pavillon and Chez Panisse on one end to A&W Root Beer on the other and I've never been asked that question. It should be obvious: watch the table and when we're done, clear the table and bring dessert.\n8. When we were shown to our table I had my hands full with several packages.

We were welcomed as soon as we climbed out of the cab and the coat was taken. We were promptly seated in a comfortable setting. The server was very friendly, efficient and attentive without hovering. The atmosphere is comfortable. The menu selection was extremely limited. The wine list was very extensive, it included anything anybody would ever want.\nWhen they came with the bread selection I felt I was transferred to a diner with the soggy rolls and some fruit breads, and such, awful, a harbinger of things to come. Appetizer, my wife chose cauliflower soup, which was good, myself Hudson valley goose liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, which was very salty as it was placed on top of some salty sauce. \nThe main course, my wife had chicken cordon bleu, which was nothing anybody who ever had a traditional one, could imagine, but it was edible. I had a steak which reportedly had been aged 14 days and was from an award winning butcher shop. It was cooked medium rare as I ordered it, but it must be one of the worst steaks I ever had, Texas Roadhouse would have to close if they served this meat. The dessert menu had no appealing choices since I'm not into beignets. I finished the meal with 7$ coffee from Honduras, which had no flavor or taste, there was also a 9$ variety from Ethiopia available. A word about the wine list, by the glass wine, was in the 17 to 25$ range, the rest of the list was difficult to use for someone who does not want to spend 2-300$ for a bottle, because they have not organized the wines by price for each region from cheap to pricy, they are scattered within the region.\nConclusion: At any price the meal would have been a disappointment at these prices it was one of the worst experiences as far as food goes, the stars are for the service and decoration.

Had a taste of the nicely seared tuna. Perfectly rare.\n\nRoasted Sonoma Chicken with roulade farci, bluefoot mushrooms, corn fritters. The chicken was beautifully presented. The breast was slight pink and so moist. The roulade made from the dark meat was stuffed with a mushroom filling. I don't normally order chicken, but was glad I ordered this.\n\nBirthday mousse cake - a complementary mousse cake with fresh fruit was presented to the celebrant.  The mousse was firm, which I thought made it more like a cake.  It was delicious. \n\nBeignets with seasonal preserves and cr\u00e8me anglaise. These were not the traditional New Orleans beignets. They were soft fluffy balls and I love the cr\u00e8me anglaise that was full of vanilla.\n\nLichee marshmallows and fruit jellies. Nice complementary after dinner sweets.\n\nComplementary chocolates. Who doesn't like homemade chocolates. \n\nAlso, a giant chocolate chip cookie was provided as a departing gift to our birthday celebrant.\nIt was a great birthday celebration. Our server, Justin provided impeccable service. The serving crew were friendly and the overall service was not overbearing. They have a bar menu and they allow patrons to order from it from the main dining room.  That is a nice option for patrons.  Now I have dined at Spruce and I wasn't disappointed.", "author": "Al L."}

The spaghetti was really a fabulous dish with amazing complexity but not over the top. Also, their house made pasta is always the best. Beautiful presentation on the fish. Also, a must have, were the beignets for dessert. Those were worth the trip alone.

When it comes to brunch, you don't want to go to places that are popular, you want to go to places that are known quantity. My girlfriend of 17 years just returned home. She wants food that she can't get running the orphanage in India, and I know Spruce will remind her those glory days of working in Wall Street as an investment banker. So.. this was exactly what the doctor ordered. The old school glam meets Californian sunshine. Perfect for Sunday brunch. We take our time catching up on life, like those carefree days of hanging out in the Haight, endless brunches at Mama's by North Beach, and that one annoying boyfriend whom we both dated (mind you, not the same time). We laugh, we giggle, and we mock. And there is no better place to do such reminiscing than Spruce. \n\nIt's not a place to rush you out. It's like Jean-George by Central Park (Yes, I know it's inside the Trump Hotel), they will take care of you, despite the price point being way more reasonable than you'd expect for a Michelin star place, the service does not fall short. Spruce is experienced. They don't have to prove anything to anyone. They don't have \"off\" days than some of the lesser known restaurant. The brunch menu is not overly complicated, and they offer solid choices. Great selection of wine and cocktails, and some of those guilty pleasure treats that make you want to throw your diet out of the window. Cinnamon rolls. Yes please. Beignets, so what it's not Cafe Du Mond, hit me. And never mind the pork, may I please have a burger on English muffin buns? Salades, though not exactly an item I'd ordinarily order for a brunch, became a hit actually, and it's quite substantial. She missed her clean American salad and we always try to make a point to get fresh salads when she's back in the U.S. They also split the salad for you so that don't have to try to cut the fried egg down the middle. You each get a fried egg. \n\nI read in the New York Magazine article on how to dine in Michelin restaurants without breaking the bank, one should try brunches instead of dinners. Granted, this is San Francisco, and few Michelins do brunches here. Still, I think it's a clever idea and certainly applies in this case. \n\nEveryone knows Spruce is a great restaurant, but few know that Sunday brunch is actually the sweet spot. Not too crowded, not a show boat place. Just a great place for friends to gather for an excellent meal without needing to be rushed out so the next group can get seated. And unlike Al's Place, you don't actually need to make a reservation a month out to get a seating.\n\nBonus point. Parking was very easy on Sunday. That brand new porsche SUV found a comfortable space 100 feet away, which made this lady on crutches, fresh out of knee surgery (I did say I'm middle aged), very happy. \n\nDouble bonus point. It's my birthday month. Another girlfriend just suggested to come here for my birthday Sunday brunch. I see a very happy belly in not too distant future.", "author": "Victoria E."}

The restaurant week lunch deal was super worth it - 3 courses for $25. \n\nFor the starter my friend decided on the gem salad (2/5) with apples, blue cheese, and walnuts, while I got the butternut squash soup (5/5). The salad wasn't very special in my opinion. The dressing that they paired with it tasted like blue cheese. Considering the salad itself also had blue cheese in it, the overall blue cheese flavor of the dish was way too overpowering. The soup on the other hand was amazing. Every element in the bowl belonged. I loved their little dollop of ginger sorbet that added the slight hint of brightness that soup needed. \n\nAs for the entree, my friend got the burger (4/5) with gruyere cheese. I went with the octopus (5/5). The burger was not your average burger, but what really stood out to us was the garlic aioli. It was creamy and full of garlic flavor, which worked well with the burger. And I never thought I'd say this, but their ketchup was pretty good too. It tasted fresh and tangy, not cloyingly sweet like bottled ketchup normally is. What really impressed me though, was the octopus dish. The octopus was cooked to absolute perfection. It was crispy on the outside and super delicate and tender on the inside. The beans were a nice meaty/filling accompaniment. What really surprised me was how well the fennel worked with the octopus and beans. Together they made the perfect bite of food. \n\nThe dessert (5/5) was a set dessert. When it came, my friend and I laughed a bit because the chocolate cake looked like the brownie bites from Costco. Luckily, it tasted nothing like the brownie bites. The cake itself was rich and chocolatey. On the side was a creamy white chocolate mousse that was decadent, but not too sweet. What really got me though, was the little scoop of pear sorbet sitting on top of a pile of shortbread cookie crumbs. The pear sorbet was so delicate, but bursting with pear flavor. Normally, pear sorbets are just sugary with no hint of pear at all. This pear sorbet tasted like they smashed a whole asian pear into a tiny golf ball sized scoop. All in all, this dessert was the perfect ending to an phenomenal meal.\n\nCons: \n- usually booked, so make a reservation if you plan to go \n- can be a bit tricky to find parking, but wasn't too bad when we went\n\nPros: \n- amazing food - everything on every plate just worked well together for the most part \n- service was top notch \n- great deal if you go during restaurant week (we were stuffed after 3 courses and couldn't even finish our entrees)", "author": "Diana C."}

Even per others who are New Orleans natives.  But warning: after you have the beignets from here, you will never want to get them anywhere else.  And if you're like me, you will crave them.   You can get these magnificent beignets any time of day too, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\nWhile the food is very good, the best aspect of this restaurant is truly the pastry chef. You can watch him and his team in action during dinner, from the outside window.  His desserts and baked goods are amazing--from the beignets (best I've ever had), to the banana bread, the 1 lb coffee cake and cookies, lemon raspberry cake, the free peanut butter chocolate bites after dinner, and the buttermilk biscuits.  Try everything.\n\n(EDIT: the pastry chef with the great stuff left in ~Feb 2018, so I can't vouch for anything after that!  Just that the new banana bread and cinnamon roll are nowhere near as good as pre-Feb'18.)\n\nVery dimly lit, so good date spot.  Service is also stellar, they don't rush you through the courses, and they're quick to accommodate your requests (\"more delicious bread please!\").\n\nDINNER:\nDuck Charcuterie ($22) - excellent and less fatty than your typical charcuterie plate.  Great pairings of sweets with the meat, this is a meal for two in and of itself.\n\nDry-aged filet mignon ($52) - comes with \"fois gras royale\" which is a small cup of custardy goodness--very flavorful.  Very good, but also comes with horseradish kale which hubby said is good (I don't like horseradish).\n\nRoasted branzino ($31) - beautiful presentation and well cooked fish, but not as flavorful as our meat dishes--this seemed to be more on the healthy side, and I was already full from the charcuterie.\n\nBRUNCH (Saturday/Sunday only):\nA big PRO for brunch is that they take reservations, unlike practically every other brunch spot in the city (except for Magic Flute across the street).  It's also not super packed, which I appreciate.  While this place is fantastic, I selfishly hope that it stays this way, so I can easily go all the time.  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city.\n\nPastrami Benedict ($24) - with crispy pastrami (really good, and I don't even like pastrami), runny poached egg, roasted red peppers, hollandaise, and a lot of kale (which makes it seem healthy ).  Beautiful presentation, good portion, and very tasty.\n\nBanana bread ($8) - comes with two slices.  Relatively dense, but very moist, with a slightly crispy outside, topped with a slab of butter, salted with fleur de sel salt.  More delicious, and better pricing than you will find at any bakery.\n\nButtermilk biscuits - Comes with certain entrees, SO good.  Buttermilk wash on top gives them a slight outer crisp--so good, especially with some extra honey. \n\nBloody Mary with bacon ($13 + $2) - hubby said it was decent, but bacon needs to be cooked down longer.\n\nFantastic restaurant.

I had made reservations almost a month before, and we were seated almost immediately upon arrival. I didn't think the staff at the door was the nicest, friendliest, or happiest when we walked in, which made me feel worried and out of place. This is why this isn't a 5 star review. As someone who had worked in customer service for years, I was deeply disappointed by the women at the front. Not a smile on either of their faces, very unwelcoming, and I had to prompt the conversation by saying that I had a reservation. \n\nHowever, we had the BEST waiter, Vince, who made the rest of the evening as smooth as the delicious butter we ate with the three types of bread that was offered to us. Vince gave us great recommendations for the menu, and was very accommodating throughout the evening. He's honestly one of the main reasons I would go back (he and the kanpachi, more on that later).\n\nThe menu is not huge, which I actually prefer. The wine list is, but the by-the-glass menu is at the front, and much smaller. My boyfriend ordered an old fashioned and I ordered a cabernet blend. For appetizers, we ordered the Burrata, which was very good. The show stopper of the night was the Japanese kanpachi, which was incredible. Please order this dish when you visit Spruce and you won't be let down. For our mains, we ordered the halibut and the duck breast. Both delicious, lots of flavor, quite different dishes, and good size servings.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the apricot mascarpone tart and the soleil d'or mousse. These had such different flavors going on, and were both heavenly. I liked the mousse more, but it is hard to be sure. My boyfriend ordered the Vienese coffee, which was served with truffles (there was a lot of dessert, thank goodness).\n\nFor the birthday portion of the evening, Spruce had written a cute birthday card, and Vince brought out a candle in another dessert dish that was goat cheesecake with raspberries and rhubarb. That was really a unique dessert, and the dish said \"happy birthday.\"\n\nI am happy that we tried this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-06", "description": "Ok, so I will say that I love Spruce for two things: the burger and the creme fraiche cheesecake.  Luckily the first is not seasonal however the second is.\n\nBURGER ($19): it's not on the dinner menu (it's on the lunch and the bar menu) so if they give you the fancy dinner menu, you can also ask for the bar menu.  They always have the burger (along with the pastrami sandwich, which is super good, but can get a little one-note).  I get the burger medium because their version of medium is juicy and pink in the middle.  I got it medium rare before and it seemed on the verge of tartare in the middle.  I also add a fried egg ($3) and gruyere (no extra charge).  The only options on the menu to do add-ons are foie and the fancy cheese but if you ask for it they'll do the burger my way! Woohoo.  It comes with a bucket of fries, aioli and ketchup and mustard.  If you want plain mayo, it kind of depends on if the chef made some.  Yes, I said that right. They don't have jars of mayo.  I also discovered later on that I love the pickled onions on the burger.  I eat the lettuce and tomato more as a salad since I don't want to ruin my burger eating experience with that. Oh so good.\n\nCREME FRAICHE CHEESECAKE: this is the best cheesecake I've ever had.  It is not too heavy and not too much of that sour cream taste.  A perfect crumbly crust too.  They serve it with odd fruit gels and weird ice cream but I usually ask for it with none of the frilly stuff and just vanilla ice cream or one of their fresh sorbets.  BUT they don't have this all the time.  Sigh.\n\nI must admit I don't eat their entrees that often and they are quite a bit more expensive but they are good.  Portions aren't huge but the food is high quality and tasty.  Their foie dish is usually really good but sometimes a little too rich since they pair the foie with something really rich.  But I stick with the burger...\n\nOh and their homemade fruit sorbets are quite a nice way to end the night.  Not as good as the cheesecake, but a heck of a lot lighter and more refreshing.  Super fruity tasting and amazing fresh taste.  I still prefer the cheesecake, but since it's seasonal, the sorbet is a nice way to close out the night.\n\nHOW TO GET SEATED...(or better yet, make a reservation in advance so you don't have to bother with trying to figure out how to get a seat)\n- Check in for the dining rom is at the host stand in the front.\n- Wait list for the lounge table is at the host stand in the front.\n- Wait list for seating at the bar in the lounge is with the bartender.\n- Seating in lounge couch area is just first come/first served; if you grab the couch, it's yours.\n\nI'm amazed that this place gets so crowded on weeknights but you see a lot of fancy looking dates.  What is that anyway? \n\nYou can order the entire menu in ANY of those locations or in the dining room.\n\nValet parking for $12, but honestly it's really easy to park in that neighborhood for dinner and it's free.  But if it's raining or cold, they do have a valet.", "author": "Traci H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "We had such an excellent time here at Spruce. Seriously happy with our choice and surprised it wasn't that tough to get a reservation. We took my lil bro here to celebrate his graduation from MBA school. If it's good enough for Barack and Elon, then it's good enough for my bro!\n\nWe were seated in a private room near the entrance. There were 4 tables and a fireplace. So nice, it felt like being in someone's fancy living room! We started off with a cocktail: La Fresa Fresca (Olmeca altos blanco, strawberry, basil, lemon, lime, black pepper) which was fruity and well blended ($15). In case you haven't heard, their wine list is extensive. I told my lil bro that I was glad his new GF wasn't such a lush and that he didn't order the $1600 bottle of wine. ;)\n\nWhile we waited for our appetizers, the bread guy came around. All of the bread choices were super fresh and delicious. There was a cranberry bread, a wheat bread, and a French bread roll, served with good butter and sea salt.\n\nWe ate family style, which I highly recommend. It was strange at first (we were dressed to the nines), however, the benefits were quickly apparent! We were able to sample a wide variety of courses. Our helpful waiter, Rahman, suggested dishes that were great for sharing & had them brought out in sets of 2, so we had room on the table.\n\nThe charcuterie selection ($23) is highly recommended. Plated on a large tree cross-section, it had house-made salami, \"fancy spam\", proscuitto, cornichons, smoked salmon, guinea hen, preserved fruit, mustard, and what we called \"liquid foie\". We've eaten at a lot of fancy restaurants, but DH and lil bro just went nuts over it. I think it was like a liquefied foie gras sauce covered with duck fat. Never seen them so happy, spreading the stuff over the toast and just eating it straight with a mini spoon. The Hudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine ($28) is another must-order. So delicious, especially paired with a rhubarb gelatin and creme fraiche layer (?), strawberries and pistachios. The warm burrata cheese ($17) baked inside a delicate piece of naan and served with curry sauce and peaches was just genius. Interesting, but tasty. The only \"miss\" was the beet salad ($15). This portion was so tiny, probably only about 4 tablespoons of food, and the buckwheat were like hard raspberry seeds. Flavor was good, but texture left much to be desired.\n\nOf the main dishes, the best one was probably the Crispy Duck Confit ($33). A bit of a misnomer, since the skin wasn't very crispy. I asked the waiter about it. He said there are some crispy parts, but it's not supposed to be overtly crunchy. Flavor was awesome though! The Housemade Spaghetti ($28) with Manila Clams, Spanish Chorizo, and sweet corn was a hit. Bro's GF said it was \"total comfort food\". You couldn't taste the clams that well, but the spicy, savory, sweet combo was awesome. Lil bro saw all the good reviews for the Foie Gras Burger ($40), so he had to order it. It was okay, but not a must-order, in my opinion. Quite greasy, in fact, it left a greasy puddle on the plate. Steak-cut fries were crisp and delicious. The steak bavette ($55) with smoked potatoes, heirloom carrots, pickled mushrooms was good, but not distinctive. Our waiter was correct that it's better cooked medium. The rarer pieces were very chewy, but the more cooked pieces were tender.\n\nLil bro got a special dessert, a mini cake slice with fruit & whipped cream, since it was his celebration. It was classy and beautiful. We split an order of beignets ($12) which were hot and fluffy. It came with a side of creme anglais and fruit preserves. A must-order, IMO. There were no bites before our meal, but we had some sweet treats afterward. The peanut butter squares with chocolate and sea salt - so simple, but effective, like a fancy peanut butter cup. Fruit petit fours and marshmallows followed that. Can't remember exactly, but I think they were cranberry.\n\nOverall, a super nice place to celebrate a special occasion. The side room wasn't as loud as the main room. We were quite pleased and it was not too expensive, considering the quality and quantity of the food. Service was fantastic. Street parking was pretty easy for 6:15 PM Saturday reservation. It's a slow meal - just relax and enjoy your time there. We would be delighted to return again!", "author": "Kari C."}

THE RESTAURANT CHARGED THE 15%. THE BANK NEVER DOES THAT.\n\nObviously angry from the lie they told, I called back and requested to speak to the GM. The host, John, forwarded the call the Riley who claimed to be the manager, but per our receipt was actually our waitress. I told Riley, that per Spruce's website, the GM is listed as Chris Tang and that was who I requested to speak to. She explained he had just left the building when I called.... ok... why not say that in the first place instead of lying and claiming to be the GM?!!!!\n\nI spoke to the GM the next day who also said that it was not them, but the bank who added the 20% (note first person told us it was 15%) additional charge. He explains that this is what the bank does when you don't leave tip on the card. My bf has worked in the restaurant industry and we both know that tip is added on to the charge AFTER the initial charge. Obviously nothing is going to be done to satisfy us on their end, so I told him I just wanted someone higher above to be aware of this and thanked him for his time.\n\nIt's been about 2 weeks since we dined here and we've dined from higher end restaurants (Gary Danko) to lower end places (i.e. Pho) and purposely tipped in cash FOR 2 WEEKS to see if this happened anywhere else and OBVIOUSLY it did not.", "author": "Annie N."}

What stood out was not only the carefully crated menu, but the SERVICE.  Obviously they have a high bar for hiring their most important representatives, the servers.  Today, with a dear friend in from London, an acclaimed European cultural critic/author, we wanted a great long lunch - with French champagne.  Here's the long and short of this Spruce review.  The food is excellent, more than being delicious and well presented, it's a well-curated menu.  The decor is soothing, comfortable, chic in a way that doesn't try to be.... yet once again - THE SERVICE.  Today, Cassandra Lynch was our server and the reason I'm writing this damn review.   Brava to management at Spruce for very clearly and consistently setting a high bar with great talent.  Anyone operating a high-end restaurant like Spruce already understands that the servers, the bartenders, the staff -- ultimately deliver the restaurant's reputation.  Well done, Spruce. Well done, Cassandra.", "author": "Robin R."}

We had the prix fixe and the charcuterie platter to start with, and it was all truly delicious. \n\nBut the service. Service can make or break a meal. It didn't quite break ours, but it wasn't great. \n\nOur waiter was a sweet guy, but he really was pushing this Rose wine on us which one of us reluctantly agreed to try. However, he then proceeded to take our food order without asking us if we wanted any cocktails. I eventually caught him as he was leaving our table and told him I wanted one. My mother in law chimed in and ordered one, and he said \"very good\" and turned to leave. Didn't acknowledge my husband at all, so my husband called him back and ordered his cocktail. This is all after the food order had been taken. \n\nI really don't think this kind of service is acceptable in a Michelin star restaurant. \n\nOh, and there was a giant piece of PAPER sticking out of my ice cream on the dessert plate. Not his fault, and he offered to correct it immediately but I was so full that I declined an alternate dessert. He poured me another Rose which was very sweet of him, but I would rather the restaurant just PAY ATTENTION to the quality of service. \n\nBullet points:\n\nPlease have your waiters take cocktail orders first.\nPlease check the food before it leaves the kitchen. \n\nWe won't be back.

NOM NOM\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for our 1 year anniversary. When we checked in, they asked if we were celebrating anything and gave us a card to put on the table that said \"happy anniversary from spruce\". Throughout the night, every employee of Spruce who came by our table made a point to say Happy anniversary. It was very nice.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine to start with. When we had questions, the waiter went into the back to ask the sommelier to make sure he gave us the correct information. I forgot what wine we got, but it was $56 for the bottle which was one of the cheaper ones. Before our food came, a server brought us popcorn for the table which seems random, but it was deliciously flavored. We also got a couple pieces of  bread.\n\nWe started with the yellow corn soup which was AMAZING. One of the best soups I've ever had. They also divided it up for us in two bowls which was very nice. Then we got the burrata wrapped in naan with peaches, which was also incredible. I'm really glad my boyfriend liked it because he's not a huge buratta fan from the few times he's had it, so I'm glad I was able to convince him that it's delicious.\n\nFor our main dishes, my boyfriend got the tuna which I tried and it was perfect. So soft and tender and flavorful. I got the homemade spaghetti which I actually didn't like. It came with chorizo, clams, and sweet corn. Wayyyy too much chorizo. I asked for a new one without chorizo, and they were very kind and accomodating. The new one came and I still didn't like, but I assured the waiter it was fine because I was already full and everything else was amazing. He told me I could pick anything else from the menu but I didn't want to be a hassle. The clam flavor was a tad weird, and the pasta did not taste homemade at all (I'm kind of a pasta snob). However, everyone was really nice about it (and they didn't end up charing us for it) and all the other food was amazing, so it I'm not letting it affect my review.\n\nFor dessert, they brought us out a flan that said happy anniversary on the plate in chocolate drizzle. It was vanilla bean or cookies and cream or something, but it was amazing.\n\nIt was such a romantic, fancy dinner and the food was incredible. Definitely pricey, but worth it.

This is a high end brunch, make no mistake.  The food is very good with a small but finely tuned menu of different traditional brunch options done with their own style.  I had the eggs benedict and my wife had the French toast.  We enjoyed them both.  But it's service is where they stand out.  You pay a premium for it, make no mistake, but rather than being expensive for the sake of being expensive, here you feel you get a quality experience for your money.  Small touches like the food being served all at once or having an attentive wait staff.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the waiter extends the option of sparkling or still water, not telling you that both are bottled.  We ended up spending quite a bit just on water - more, in fact, than any one dish - which was a disappointing realization.\n\nGo in prepared and this is a great option for treating yourself.", "author": "Seth E."}

Plus, it was very weird, we were seated next to two customers, I am assuming regulars because multiple staff members came to say hi to them, who brought a bunch of their own food (avocados, radishes, bananas, other fruits) and had the restaurant cut it up for them and serve it alongside their meal. They were comparing the size of each other's avocado pits and how clean they were after eating the avocado.

Only a select few are deserving of the magical fifth star.\n\nOur evening began with a cab ride from the Mark Hopkins with a super friendly taxi driver, who in fact was trained on driving in the City back on the 60's while on LSD. I kid you not!\n\nIn any case, he was awesome and got us to our destination on time and in one piece.\n\nWe arrived a little early for our 6:45 reservation, yet the hostess worked her magic and found us a nice table near the middle of the dining room. We were immediately greeted by our server David. He made sure we knew all the in's and outs and came back a few minutes to take our drink orders.\n\nMy wife started with a glass of Billecart-Salmon Brut Ros\u00e9. It's one of her favorite sparkling wines, so to find it on the menu is always a nice surprise. Me? I'm in the mood for a cocktail, and went for the gin based Pendinnis. Without saying the sparkling was festive and was the perfect way to start the evening. But you cocktail lovers, the Pendennis belongs in the cocktail hall of fame. Rich in top shelf gin flavor and finished with citrus. This drink was amazing, and will forever seek it out on my next trip to Spruce. Oh yes, there will be a next time.\n\nWhile sipping on our drinks, we browsed the menu and made our selections. My wife was a green mood and went with the goat cheese green salad. Perfectly dressed and balanced, if you are a salad fan you will not be disappointed. Me? it's January and it's soup season. Cauliflower soup! I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this complex, yet comfort driven soup was. The spices and base (including a farm fresh egg) serve as the base while the liquid portion is served over the top. I am still dreaming of this soup.\n\nOur wine for evening? Now this can be a stressful situation for anyone. Especially with a wine list that's over 80 pages (single spaced) long. Enter Lauren (our sommelier) , she made what is potentially a \"wtf, I can't even pronounce half the labels on the menu\" into a \"OMG, this is the best bottle ever!\". My eye caught glimpse on several French variatels  that (in my opinion) were aggressively priced. $150 for a 1986? Yes, it sounds expensive, but did you hear what I said? 1-9-8-8-6? You tell me, where in the Hell are going to find an amazing bottle with this kind of age for $150?? And what blew my mind, there were several bottles priced on the list around this price (and below)! Lauren's description of our wine for the night was spot on! In all my years on Earth, never have I encountered a more knowledge Sommelier than Lauren. \n\nOur main selections? My wife went with the pork tenderloin, me the ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection and hardly a bite left on each of our plates. Of course, we had to share a side of French fries. The fries are what legends are made.\n\nDavid to Lauren, the entire staff, thank you for helping make our night a memorable one.

Clean solid salad dish.\n\nSecond Course - Cauliflower soup with hickory smoked levain, manchego cheese, and jidori egg.  This was by far my favorite dish of the night.  It was richly flavored and the runny jidori egg (which apparently comes from extremely pampered chickens in Japan) inside the soup gave it extra flavor.  The hickory smoked levain breadcrumbs took the soup to a different level by providing a contrasting texture to the mostly liquid dish. Yum!!\n\nThird Course - Pan roasted sturgeon cherry clam chowder with dungenous crab. The dish was well executed but I don't think I'm a huge fan of the firm texture of the cooked sturgeon.\n\nFourth Course - Liberty Farms Duck Breast, Boudin Noir (blood sausage), with beets, hazelnuts, and pears.  I really enjoyed the salty crispy skin on the duck and the boudin noir.  Most people at our table had never tried blood sausage, but ended up loving it! The sweet taste of the pears and beets provided a sweet contrast to the salty flavors.\n\nFifth Course- Vanilla panna cotta, granola, and passion fruit sorbet.  The panna cotta was delicious with the spiced granola.  The fruit sorbet was a great way to finish the meal after eating all night!\n\nAll courses had different wine pairings and the server introduced each course with the wine before serving the dishes.  A fantastic food experience that lasted over three hours!", "author": "Helen T."}

Here's the long, sad story.\nSaturday evening we were told we had to put our name on a list to sit at the bar. Okay. We did that but we were never told there was space. Eventually we figured it out on our own. \nTwo out of the four drinks we first ordered were wrong. When it was brought to a servers attention the mistake was rectified but not recognized. He even told me that a normal Gin Fizz is actually not a Gin Fizz unless you call it a Ramos Gin Fizz. No apology. \nMuch later my Sweetheart ordered a beer and asked for it periodically for at least 30 minutes. Enough time passed that we ordered and received our dessert. Eventually he said, \"I would like my beer NOW.\" but apparently the millennial waitress heard, \"You are a *@#\" which NONE of us heard. The millennial with us said, \"millennials hear what they feel.\" I guess so.

One of my good friends is leaving for Brazil so we are going to eat at a ton of the restaurants in the city so she could get her fix before she leaves.  I made reservations for Spruce on the suggestion of another good friend.  We settled on brunch for a 10:30 AM reservation and were one of the first ones to show up.   We arrived a little early and had to wait until they actually open their doors at 10:30.   We were seated right away and were greeted by our amazing waiter, Carl.  He provided us with top notch service.  We were asked if we wanted regular water or sparkling.  I settled for just regular flat water and ordered a pamarosa (their version of mimosa) along with my friends. \n\nWe ordered banana bread and beignets to start and I could have ended my meal right there very satisfied.  The banana bread was amazing and the spread that went along with it was just downright sinful.  I was in heaven.  The beignets were wonderful and so light and refreshing. I told my friends I could sit in the corner with several orders of these and just be happy!  You know you're having a good meal when you are smiling from ear to ear.  \n\nWe ordered the chicken hash, waffles, hamburger, lobster benedict, ansol mills white.  The food was amazing.  My friends and I shared everything and we were all so stuffed and loved every single bite of all the dishes.

Service was good! \n\nSecond time, was seated at the tables behind the bars. Tried to order the same burger as last time- but was told by the waiter hey didn't make it like that (huh? No cheddar cheese? Was that too bizarre of a request?). Instead, I was coerced into a realllly heavy cheese and even my sides were different (soggy lettuce, tomato that'd already spewed out onto the plate- making the burger bun soggy). I asked for medium rare, received burnt and charred. Even the bun was burnt. Was looking to alert a waiter to tell them, but was NEVER checked on! Super weird, as this is a pretty standard courtesy even at not-so-nice places. Couldn't even order a second round of drinks before the check was discreetly slid onto our table! A lot for 2 burgers and a coke, coming in at $80...wouldn't have minded if the burger was actually what Id ordered the first time. \n\nVery mixed feelings about this place!...", "author": "Natalie B."}

I am SO, SO, SO glad I did. I will be back, but I can really already tell that Spruce will be one of my go to SF spots for any special occasion. \n\nThe restaurant and vibe is amazing. Natural light, amazing high ceilings, and wonderfully appointed furniture and spacing to make the restaurant just blow smoke of class. On top of that the bar is absolutely stunning with 4 rows of drinks embedded within framing that makes it look like a beautiful piece of art. Some of the bottles of the top are indeed one off varieties and clearer the top, top shelf as it should be. As you walk into the main entrance you are also flanked by what seems to be a private dining area with its own entrance as well as a beautiful cafe.\n\nAhh the food, I cannot wait. I had an amazing simple anchovy salad, a burger to die for, and an amazing chocolate mousse cake. It was basic, but that along with a great pork loin. The Spruce burger with thick cut bacon added and french fries is a solid burger. The pork loin came with amazing fried jidori eggs, potato hash, and a whole grain mustard bearnaise that went amazing on my fries and burger as well. The menu for dinner that I saw and the various reviews make me want to come back here soon!\n\nAs for the service, it was impeccable (as it should be at this price point, but you would be surprised) and like I've said already I can't wait to come back for more reviews.

The bartenders were friendly and welcoming.\n\nWhen the time arrived, the front of the house led us to our tables. The menu was delicious. We had a glass of light sparkling wine to start with to help cleanse our palettes before the meals started. They offered bread with 2 different kinds of butter: regular and cinnamon butter. The waiter came around and checked on us as every course came out. The sommelier also came and poured the glasses of wine for that pairing. \n\n2015 New Year Prix fix Menu\n1. Cauliflower soup with caviar and bone marrow-soup was complicated tasting. It had so many flavors. It was awesome! The wine pairing was light and bought the flavors.\n2.

Wagu beef on top of seaweed, with kale and potato gratin-I never knew that beef could pair up with seaweed. Who would have thought? I had to examine it and to make sure if it was actually seaweed. It was so good with it. The potato gratin was with kale....not the usual vegetable in a gratin.\n4. Brie cheese with bread, nuts and pears-Loved the cheese and bread especially with the wine. \n5. Sea bass with lobster ravioli-perfect crips on sea bass skin\n6. Sorbet-perfect and light for the end of night\n7. Chocolate truffles sprinkled with sea salt-absolutly divine.\n\nI also had the wine pairing with the menu. The sommelier was excellent in describing the wine and region. It was definitely well-paired with the dishes. It complimented the each dish perfectly.

He was very informative (he definitely knew his menu and answered all questions perfectly), attentive, and prompt. I wish I could recall his name, so I could give him the props he so deserved. Spruce has a very, very extensive wine list. So, much so, that my husband and I got overwhelmed and stuck with cocktails. He had Cuba Libre's and I had Spruce's Pimms Cup 2. Very good Pimms Cup. For appetizers, we had the Scarlet Turnip soup, the Japanese Kanpachi, and the Charcuterie Selection. All were very, very well presented and plated. And all were delicious. I would absolutely recommend that you get the Kanpachi. So, so good. For our entrees, I had the Alaskan Halibut, and my husband, the Duck Breast. Excellent. The peas and the halibut were great together. And my husband really enjoyed his duck. And lastly, we had the beignets for dessert. The vanilla glaze sauce and warm beignets?

And food was very good and simple.\n\nHad a very good hen here, and my friend had a pretty amazing duck.  Someone else had scallops on the table, but I have to say that they do their birds well here, as the sauce for both the hen and duck were both excellent.  And even the hen was not overcooked - with a perfect amount of pink inside and crisp on the outside.  Really just excellent food.\n\nThe dessert was arguably even better.  I am not a big dessert person, but the beignets here were really good, especially with the creme anglais.  And they give out cookies - really fantastic chocolate chip cookies.\n\nOverall, the food looked fancy, but the dishes were pretty simple.  When you stopped looking at all the frills and fancy stuff, it was just good and simple food, well served.\n\nSuper knowledgable staff, especially when it came to wine.  Expensive but probably worth every penny.\n\nBy the way, is the owner or head chef Asian?  You get these young well dressed servers and then every now and then you get like that older guy from the Mandarin Hotel.  Felt like an out of body experience.  Then you see the bak choy in a dish here or there, and you are like ok...someone in the kitchen or the office is definitely Asian.

The atmosphere is very intimate and chic - perfect for a date!\n\nThe food:\n\nScallop appetizer - Probably the best scallops I've ever had! Plump and cooked perfectly. I can tell the quality is good when it cuts like butter. I'd say the best course we had. \n\nBurger - My boyfriend is a burger aficionado and he says its one of the best burgers he's had in terms of quality and taste. its also listed in several best of SF burger lists.  I have to agree. Its a very simple burger but very well thought out and well executed.\n\nDuck - It was small but packed with flavor. The outside of the duck was crisp and spiced very well, inside was a medium to medium rare and juicy. I recommend it but if you're hungry i'd go for a different entree.\n\nPanna Cotta - yummy! Get this if you want a light dessert. Comes with blood orange gelato.

Chunks of lobster in this delectable sauce. Perfection.

Waiter was fun, friendly, and best of all knowledgeable. He helped me make choices based on what I have least often and created our own wine pairings.  The crown jewel was he overheard I love peanut butter and chocolate bars and gave me extra to take home \"since they're your weakness.\" Eat your heart out Aquerello and Gary Danko--service here tops you.\n- Butternut squash soup:  velvety creamy but not overdone and a deep yet subtle flavor. Soft egg and croutons push to the side provided a nice presentation. 4.5 stars\n- Duck breast and lasagna: huge pile of duck medallions and a creative \"lasagna\" creation. 4 stars\n- Gougers: not your standard bread course. These are one of my favorite carbs: fluffy and light yet still cheesy. 4 stars\n- Beignets: these sugar covered donuts paired with chocolate and vanilla sauces are always a solid choice. 4 stars\n- Atmosphere: was worried it'd be too fancy/stuffy. It has dim lighting and was nice and but was comfortable and enjoyable.\n- Cocktails: between us we had a boulavardier and whiskey smash and they were solid\n\nLowlights:\n- Location isn't bartable and not much around to grab a drink after.\n\nThis dining experience was worth the wait.

This review is based on a lunch visit, sitting at the bar, with the charming Larissa as our bartender...\n\nIn advance, we called asking if it was appropriate to sit at the bar if we were wearing shorts? The ma\u00eetre d's response: \"Of course. This is San Francisco.\" She gave a friendly chuckle when we came in half an hour later. (Spruce is a fancy-schmancy, snooty-pooty restarant in Laurel Heights. You fully expect to see Diane Feinstein and other blue hairs sitting behind you, but the service and staff are perfectly relaxed and welcoming. Two fellas in shorts fit in just fine.)\n\nWould this be a 5-Star dinner experience? I do not know. But this was definitely a 5-star lunch.\n\nThe real star of the menu is the $35 prix fix (3 course) lunch with $15 wine pairings. Truly *insane* for this caliber of food. I enjoyed a beautiful early girl tomato soup (+cucumber +eggplant), fried sweetbreads (+grilled cabbage +cauliflower pur\u00e9e) and a lovely basil ice cream -- all the wine pairings were perfect. My friend, Mike, enjoyed an incredibly fresh heirloom tomato salad -- likely the source of my wonderful tomato soup -- and the most perfect salade ni\u00e7oise I've ever seen. Throw in a couple vodka martinis between us, and we could not have been happier. \n\nLarissa, our bartender, was the other star of the show. Super friendly, and shared with us her interest in mezcal and tequilas (and she shared a tasting or two as well!).\n\nAgain, this was my lunch experience. Highly recommended.", "author": "Corey M."}

If your goal is to have a delightful experience with top notch service and amazing food, go across the street to Sociele.\n\nI was really excited to try out Spruce and immediately loved the decor of the restaurant.  My friend, who goes often, suggested we get there early so we could grab a bar table, which we did.  (First come, first serve.) When I sat down, I noticed the couple next to me were unhappy because they ordered a hamburger medium-well, and it came very rare.  They sent it back.  We ordered hamburger and when it came, our medium burger looked completely raw.  I asked that they cook it some more and mentioned that the couple next to us had a similar issue.  As we were finishing, my friend's husband and daughter called to say they wanted to join so we asked if we could pull the table next to us together (it was empty).  Zach, the manager, said it was reserved and we couldn't, so I said, no biggie, we'd give her husband and daughter our table since we were finishing up and try to fit in on the side.  He told us that wouldn't work ergonomically, so we said we'd give them our table and go elsewhere.  He then came back and said we had to leave because the next group needed a table for 4!  I said, what if we simply decided to stay longer?  Then he said \"well, then, I guess you could stay,\" and that he was \"more than accommodating for the burger.\"  Wow.  I have to say, for a restaurant that charges $40+ per  entree, I really didn't expect the manager Zach to treat clients that way.\n\nOne more thing - it was obvious that they were trying to turn the table by the number of people and times they came by to try to take our dishes away before we were finished.  Seriously bad experience.\n\nFinally, we left and her husband and daughter ate across the street at Sociele, which had fantastic service and made us actually feel welcome and appreciated as customers.

I loved the lighting and the seats were SOO comfortable. The nice thing about going on a weekday, late especially late at night there was A LOT of parking which can always be a little challenging in the city.\n\nNow onto the food we started with the foie gras and the beef tartare. This last time we had foie gras was when we were in Seattle since they banned in in the bay area and I'd come back just for that. The beef tartare was refreshing and I typically do not like capers but it complimented the dish well. I had heard great reviews for the burger and yes, I got the burger and I am so glad I did. From the burger to the fries everything was just on point. The burger was full of flavor and so juicy! Although I typically like thin fries, the fries was just as good as the burger. \n\nNow onto dessert, we had a chance to try the beignets which were so light and fluffy and although it was great by itself, the chocolate sauce and creme anglaise were just the right touch.

Leather, paneling, white linens, a whole team of waiters taking care of you.  It's not an experience I necessarily want all the time, but I enjoyed the nostalgia of that.  \n\nHowever, I will say that this place skews a little older and more reserved as a result.  That was OK for brunch with a girlfriend, but I'm not sure I'd want to come with a group or on a date.\n\nThe food was excellent though very rich.  Again, OK sometimes but not something I'm dying to have again quite so soon.  We shared the friend confit duck over biscuits and gravy (with the added poached egg), the ham and kale eggs benedict, and the chocolate bourbon crepes.  We also had a mimosa and a Bloody Mary.\n\nThe drinks were good - obviously better quality that a lot of brunches around the city, though I would have loved some alternative juice options for the mimosa.  The crepes came WELL before the rest of our food - probably half an hour - and though they were good, we (a) wanted them as dessert and (b) were surprised when they were served cold.  For me, the coldness was off-putting.  Again, they were good in the way that chocolate and whipped cream is always good, but when you serve a delicate crepe cold, it gets a bit gummy and heavy.  The entrees were excellent and very, very filling.  I preferred the duck dish, and I'm very happy that we added the egg, as it toned down the saltiness of the dish a bit.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the service was very friendly and very attentive.  The restaurant comped us some banana bread for the lengthy wait for our entrees, even though we hadn't complained.\n\nI'd definitely come back here for a special occasion or with my family.  It's a nice experience to have in San Francisco.", "author": "Tay H."}

Expensive; excellent food quality and attentive service.  \n\nBut, that excellent service comes at the \"price\" of being obsequious until the waiter recognizes that he is not going to be able to up sell one on the wine list or menu.\n\nWe wanted the Burger and Burgundy on a Sunday night.  We ended up getting a duck confit, spaghetti and a salad with the burgundy flight.  As our waiter looked down his nose at my wife and I we were delivered our meal.

Both my bf and I have multiple dietary restrictions and inquired on the phone prior to making the reservation whether Spruce could accommodate us, which the hostess said would not be a problem. \n\nWow! Spruce really went above and beyond to accommodate us! Thank you, Spruce!! They even made me a special kale and Jidori egg dish that wasn't on the prix fixe because I couldn't eat the offered dish or the alternative. We could NOT get over how the eggs tasted so incredibly ambrosially amazingly awesome. Our waiter, Steve, was efficient, accommodating, attentive, friendly, and informed.\n\nThe salad of cauliflower and little gem lettuce was, as my bf said more than once, the best salad he has ever had in his life. Yum! We both had the duck breast, with blood sausage, which was also delicious. My bf collects Italian wines and was really happy with the wine selection. He had the Nebbiolo, Nino Negri, Inferno 2010 and the Nebbiolo, G.D. Vajra, Albe Barolo 2011 - I'd totally recommend both!\n\nSpruce really did an amazing job last night! I think they said that Blaine was working in the kitchen last night (that Chef Sullivan had gone for the evening already by that time) - thanks, Blaine! \n\nI've been to Spruce a few times and one time for Dine About Town, I was pretty unimpressed with my meal, but it deserves a 10-stars review for last night.

And the moment I stepped in, I just fell in love with their bright and semi-casual deco! \n\nWe tried the prix fixe menu with wine pairing and also ordered from the a la carte menu of foie gras torreine and grilled halibut.  The foie gras torreine came out in generous portions, very silky and smooth, delicious! I think that's the highlight of the meal.  The halibut was OK but I wish it was a bit softer.  The prix fixe menu came with lettuce and duck confit, fresh lettuce but not so much duck confit, the entree veal tasted strong but good, crispy skin but soft meat inside, just like pork belly.

Well made and thoughtful.\n\nWe went directly into our meal. We ordered and started with some soups - crab bisque and veloute. The veloute was pretty salty and heavy but both soups were chock full of flavor which I liked. As for the meal, the duck was phenomenal.

On a whim, I visited Spruce on a late Sunday evening and sat at the bar.  Damn.  Dinner service had ended not more than a minute prior to our arrival.  I thought I would've had to leave, but the bartender asked me and my group to wait for a few minutes.  Lo and behold, the kitchen stayed open, just for us, to cook the last order of the night.  Really impressive.  My girlfriend tried their seared foie gras and nearly had an epiphany on life, religion, and the universe upon her first taste.  \n\nClearly mesmerized, I came back the next day with a friend to try their best selling item, the Spruce Burger- customizable every which way from here to east of the Mississippi. Make note my friends - it is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  The bun is made in-house.  Toasted to perfection.  The meat patty was honest to goodness medium rare.  I added bacon and gruyere cheese. You can also add an egg, onions, mushrooms, and even foie gras.  A picture is worth a thousand words, so take a look at my burger.  Order it with an Old-Fashioned - freshly peeled skin off an orange curled up next to a freshly shaven block of ice.  \n\nSpruce is worth your time and hard earned money.  Whether you're just stopping in here for a quick bite at the bar or if you're the President of the free world dining with titans of industry (President Obama ate with Elon Musk two days before I did), Spruce leaves you feeling like it's time and money well spent.  Exquisite service, food, and experience from start to finish, all five of your senses will be tingling.  I didn't know it at the time, but Spruce has a Michelin star.  Should've figured as much.  \n\nLast tip: Spruce has its own cafe in the front.  Try the cookies.", "author": "Huy D."}

We had wanted to try Spruce for a while and knew they had a large bar area. So off we went on foot for the few blocks separating our place and this culinary mecca, only to have our hopes crushed when we were faced with a jam packed bar and a few people on their \"bar wait list\" (gotta give them props though, at least you can wait in a civilized manner for your turn to get a barstool instead of having to gawk around and pry on paying patrons like vultures in order to secure a spot). I already had my phone in hand and searched the Yelp app for close-by alternatives when on of the hostesses approached us to let us know that they had a last minute dinner cancellation and we could have a table if we were interested. Yes of course we were interested!\n\nWe started the whole dining experience with a round of cocktails. Smoke & Fire (Akashi Whisky, Smoked Tea Liquor, Drambuie, Birds-Eye Chili, Lemon, Vanilla-Honey) for the gent and the Linnaeus Theory (Bacchus Winter Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, Botanical Vodka, Mint Tea, Grapefruit Bitters) for myself. Both were presented beautifully and tasted equally as good.\n\nOverwhelmed by the amazing menu options, we finally settled on the following:\n\nCharcuterie Selection ($23) - the best meat plate I have ever had, hands down! P\u00e2t\u00e9s, rillettes, dry cured thinly sliced meats from various animals and the most amazing garlic infused toasted bread slices were presented to us on a massive platter. This will be our go-to appetizer to share when we do snag two of those barstools during a future visit. \n\nCharred Spanish Octopus ($23) - .heirloom beans, romesco, and hazelnut. The octopus was tender with a perfect grill char to it and the accompanying ingredients worked flawlessly together for a great dish. \n\nPancione Ravioli ($19) - fava leaf, pistachio gremolata, ricotta whey. Even though this was the least memorable dish of the evening, the pasta was toothsome and the filling delicious. Everything else we ate that night was simply a good notch better. \n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($28) - boudin noir, onion brioche, apple butter. The sweet brioche bread worked really well with the richness of the liver and apple has always been my favorite fruit to pair with foie gras, so needless to say this was a winner of a dish.\n\nWe had different wines with each dish and the by the glass selection that Spruce has is top notch. The Willakenzie Estate Pinot ($17) and the Ch\u00e2teau Ro\u00fbmieu-Lacoste Sauternes ($16) were my two favorite wines we drank that evening. \n\nService was impeccable throughout our dinner and I loved that they took our coats at the beginning and had them ready for us when we got up to the front desk upon leaving. Our plan for a quick bite turned into one of the best dining experiences I have had in the Bay Area. We will be back soon for that Charcuterie Selection and more cocktails (and/or Pinot) in the bar area.", "author": "Anna R."}

We enjoyed our dinner very much. I didn't care for my appetizer pasta with truffles that much certainly wasn't worth $60 to me. It came with white truffle shavings on top. Maybe my palette is not refined enough I kept trying to taste the truffle but I could not. My husband enjoyed his tomato soup. They bring out the soup in a steel jug separately from the bowl and pour it in front of you. It was quite fun to watch, maybe to keep the soup warm. The rest of dinner got progressively better. The entrees were phenomenal. We got the duck and the scallops. Both were cooked perfectly, accompanying sides and sauce were delightful. The portions were good, was stuffed at the end. I almost didn't get dessert but so glad I did. We ordered the mousse because it sounded interesting: mousse with devil's food cake, chicory ice cream and popcorn. Very rich but good. Spruce also gave us another treat for our anniversary. It was a lighter cake with strawberries, whipped cream and white chocolate. Both desserts were amazing and very creative. Loved both.

No matter, at least it didn't taste like one (IMO, English muffins are only good when you put pizza sauce, cheese, and pepperonis on it before sticking it into the toaster oven).  They gave me one piece of tomato and one limp piece of some kind of lettuce (wasn't romaine or iceberg), and although the sparse toppings made the good-quality hamburger patty (cooked medium) stand out, I wish I'd gotten another piece of lettuce, or at least one that wasn't so floppy and thin.

It really doesn't get better than this.\n\nA friend and I made a last minute impromptu decision to go fine dining in SF last night. Spruce was the only place that had a reservation available so we came here on a whim, unsure of what to expect from the world of SF fine dining. \n\nTo say that my expectations were met would be an understatement. From the dining experience to the food to the service, I really couldn't have asked for a better dining experience.\n\nLet's start with the food. We ordered the Roasted Diver Scallops, the Liberty Farms Duck Breast, Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin, and beignet (which I eloquently mispronounced as beg-net) for dessert.\n\nRoasted Diver Scallops--thankful that they divided the order into two for us--we each received 1 1/2 scallops and oh my. I died. The brassica was seared to perfection as were the scallops. The shellfish broth was so unique and really complemented the flavor of the scallops mmmm.\n\nDuck Breast--too good. I honestly was not really quite sure what I was eating half the time, but regardless of what it was, it was phenomenal. I think I got around 7 or so juicy slices of delicious duck.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pork Tenderloin, which can often easily be overcooked and easily messed up, but Spruce does it perfectly. It was extremely delicious and juicy!\n\nWe ordered the beignet at the recommendations of fellow Yelpers and weren't disappointed. Dipping it in the vanilla flavored sauce was mind blowing and added a whole new level of flavor to the otherwise plain, but very chewy beignet.\n\nI think good food can make a restaurant amazing, but the ambience and the quality of service that Spruce offers is what allows it to really differentiate itself from other restaurants that I've been to. The waiters were extremely attentive to our needs. We never needed to ask for anything and the seemed to know whenever we were ready for the next part of the meal. It's the little things like holding a napkin in front of the cup when someone is pouring water that really showed me how much attention and detail Spruce pays to creating the most divine, perfect dining experience.\n\nAlso, as poor college students, despite the four dollar signs, entrees were very reasonably priced and it was certainly cheaper than eating at a restaurant with a set course meal.\n\n\ntldr; I honestly can't tell you of a better dining experience.

I would've been happy with just this. It was the most delicious soup I've ever had. I thought I love butternut squash soup - you know the 'organic' kind you splurge for at wholefoods. No way. This was flat out godly in comparison. What tasted like tiny ginger bread croutons made it over the top.\n\nEntree: Duck cassoulet. Honestly, I used to laugh at those who considered fine dining an art form, but calling this food seems like an insult. It was beyond delicious, but the flavors were almost too much for me- too rich, I wasn't used to it. I found myself stuffed not even half way finished. I know french food is typically small portions and maybe this is why. The food is so flavorful you don't need much. I certainly felt I could've shared my portion with a friend with some bread to compliment the intensity and would've been beyond content. Either way. Bravo. It was on a complete different level of delicacy. Sadly I couldn't finish it. I was so full!\n\nThe dessert was a chocolate mouse cake with passion fruit tangy garnish toped with banana ice cream. \nI needed to sit with myself for almost 15 minutes before ordering it from the waiter. And I barely touched it but it was also incredibly delicious.\n\nAll in all, events like SF restaurant week remind me to take care of myself, celebrate myself, and invite treats I typically overlook while consumed with rent, savings, rent, rent, etc., rent (haa!) and the tolls that are so real amoung the working class. I'm happy I was able to remind myself of what not only a good meal but a godly meal tastes like! \n\nI'll take it. I deserve it :)", "author": "Diana M."}

The servers were quick to refill everything!\n\nThe wine selection was quite expansive. I believe it was 96 pages or so; the largest I have ever seen at any restaurant. I ordered the spruce wedge salad and scallops as part of the preset menu. The salad was an excellent mix of crunchiness, texture and sweet/savory flavors. The pan-roasted Diver Scallops were a bit on the saltier side. Initially, the portions did not seem as large but by meal's end, I was definitely full. The cookie dessert at the end was SUPERB. It came with whip cream; the cookie was warm and chewy with the chocolate melted to the perfect level. Great ender!\n\nThere is also a full service bar with a tremendous selection of alcohol. I did not get the opportunity to order from there but I am sure they can make almost any cocktail.\n\nIt was my first time but I would definitely come back here for dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-31", "description": "Finally getting around to this...\n\nLast week 6 of us made our way out to Spruce after booking the reservation months in advance.  I hadn't heard much about Spruce, with the exception of hearing how amazing their burger was.  The menu seemed pretty standard, but not having known anyone that had been there before, I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nWe brought in two bottles of wine for dinner, and were shown to the back of the restaurant in one of their rooms that seemed to be reserved for larger groups.  Once we sat down, got comfortable and started to peruse the menu, we realized it had been about 20 minutes since our waiter had been back to our table.  It seemed like our waiter was a little overbooked, so we started to get a little antsy.\n\nWhen our waiter came back, we discussed our wine selection, and Greg and I decided to split the Charcuterie Plate, and we both selected the Pork Tenderloin.  Other things that were ordered at the table: Seared Scallops, the Duck Breast, Grilled Bavette Steak, and Braised Short Ribs.\n\nHere's where it gets good.  The head sommelier Chris Gaither showed up to our table, imparted some knowledge about what we had brought in, and put out some recommendations for the table and how it pairs with our food.  Both Greg and I have been to enough fancy pants places where the sommeliers can been stuffy, stuck up, or try and upsell on on a mediocre bottle of red.  Chris, however, was not one of those guys.  He was open to all of our questions, stayed around to hang out and talk about his experiences with various vintages, types, and his own personal favorites.  If you're at Spruce, definitely trust what this guy has to say.  Thanks Chris!\n\nOur Charcuterie selection showed up, and the first thing both Greg and I thought was that the plate itself was small.  The charcuterie was presented on a plate that wasn't bigger than one of our dinner plates we have here at home.  Presented on the plate was some duck pate, three various forms of prosciutto, and a duck prosciutto (my personal favorite).  I suppose the reason why I don't remember this that well was because it was mostly a forgettable dish.  It was good, but nothing special.  \n\nOn to the mains!  The Pork Tenderloin arrives and it looks absolutely beautiful. The small medallions of loin were glazed with pork jus and some veggies.  I was completely blown away with the first bite.  It was tender, juicy, and was packed with flavor in each bite.  I ate through the vegetables and the rest of the medallions before getting to the last element on the plate: CRISPY PORK BELLY. ZOMG.  I love pork belly, and if I wasn't sold on the dish already, this put me over the edge.  This was seriously so amazing. I don't how else to put it, this was so great.  Greg said that it was the best pork tenderloin dish he's ever had.  Enough said, this was worth it.  Other people loved their dishes, although I wasn't sure if anyone enjoyed their dish as much as we did.\n\nNaturally, what's a beautiful meal without a beautiful dessert?  The girls ordered cappucinos, and Greg and I split the Beignets.  It came accompanied with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise, with 6 in one order.  I love cappucinos with my dessert and was blown away with how great Spruce's cappucino was.  It went perfectly with the light, sugary, and fluffy beignets.  The chocolate and creme sauces were messy, but if you love sweets, then you'd be tempted to lick the chocolate sauce dish after licking your fingers.  Absolutely delish.\n\nAfter the long wait for the waiter at the beginning of the meal, the service at Spruce was incredible.  I've already mentioned the sommelier, and our waiter was so sweet.  We were the last ones to leave our dining room area, and through the end, our waiter was patient and very nice.\n\nWhile the Charcuterie Plate was forgettable, everything else was amazing.  I was impressed with the service, the restaurant decor (have you seen their bar? talk about super trendy!), and of course, the food.  If you're ever in Presidio Heights and want a pleasant dining experience, please look up Spruce.  Like I said in my review, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was impressed with everything there.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Interestingly on the right side outside of the front door has like 11 foot tall dark brown curtains that you barely notice. Inside is a separate room for dining that we sat in. I liked that it was a bit more brighter inside and much cozier. It has a fireplace with a huge charcoal drawing of a cute little bulldog. It felt super romanticals. The only thing was when you had to go to the restroom you had to step out in the cold to get to the front door and in the main dining hall. \n\nTo the food! Steak tartar, on point! Never had steak tartar before but it was incredible. I liked that it tasted so different than tuna tartar. I thought it would taste similar to tuna tartar just with the taste of beef but it was much more than that. The baby gem lettuce was good but not amazing, although the chili verde sauce it came with was delicious. \n\n14 day aged strip was delicious. It didn't taste like steak. It had a very different flavor, I guess it's from the aging. It was superb. \n\nThe pork loin was okay. I'm not a fan of the sweet apple sauce or cranberry flavored that is paired with pork chops but if that's your thing then you will like it. \n\nFor dessert I got an affagato and my husband got the cheesecake. Both very good! And on top of that they gave me a free little lemon raspberry cake to say happy birthday and it was hella bomb. Very sweet. On top of that I got a birthday card from Spruce with the pic of the dog hanging in the room. So cute! \n\nIn addition we got two giant cookies on the house.

Disgusting!! It was $38 which is a lot for pasta without protein.\n\nOur wine arrived at the end of the pasta which was not good as we wanted it to start. The waiters were chugging white wine at the wine station as we waited for ours!! So unprofessional. \n\nWe then had the porc for two which was literally half fat and the fat was raw near the meat which was also undercooked and raw. The fat was not rendered at all it was nasty!!! We actually had to send the porc back as it was so raw it was unsafe to eat. After we carved the meat away from the fat to be recooked it was returned over cooked. They didn't remove the existing fat from our plates and there was so much fat left over that the bus boy actually asked us if we wanted take it home. \n\nWe won't be back.

They had just the right size room for us in their Library which even with our larger contingent of nearly 30 guests worked out quite comfortably.  Throughout our ceremony the restaurant staff was quite responsive in making certain we had our privacy, but at the same time they made sure we were well accommodated for by having one member of their staff dedicated in helping us with whatever was necessary.\n\nOnce our ceremony drew to a close the restaurant wowed us with a delicious assortment of charcuterie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#2SL--bEPHESDaXFrN-jT9Q), cheeses (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#4sWRDn97l8--XW7c4jcJuA) and breads.\n\nThe private dinner that night was held in Spruce's Laurel Room.  Its seating capacity of 40 guests seemed quite perfect for our then-expanded group of over 30 guests.  Once again the service was amazing.  Members of their wait staff were always nearby to help out even on a very busy Friday night.\n\nAfter allowing our hosts to make a small presentation drink orders were taken and promptly filled and the salad entr\u00e9e (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#UQmTUxnc3xmwFFSqIziJPA) was brought out immediately.  Having consumed endives on previous occasions I was expecting the Escarole Salad to be bitter, but it was not.  In fact I thought the crispy Black Pepper Biscotti worked quite well in uniting the profound flavor of the endive with the subtle sweetness of the grapes.\n\nOnce all the salad plates were cleared and used utensils were swapped out with clean utensils our seafood entr\u00e9e (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#J40gJIiatNToHKyS50J-oA) arrived.  The Sablefish was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy top layer and moist, succulent filets.  The funny green cream and wafer were a hit as the family couldn't stop talking about the fabulous flavor found in the Parsley Caper Pudding and the Brioche Panade.\n\nNext up was our meat entr\u00e9e (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#PTfbcWREiJzcyM34DV89ZA) which combined a tender, flavorful Pork Tenderloin with Crispy Pork Belly.  The pig parts lover in me was truly satisfied by the perfect execution of this dish.\n\nBy the time our poultry entr\u00e9e (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#lh2LTXr0U-oVzfufd8AN9Q) arrived several members of the extended family had already thrown in the towel stuffed to the gills, but sometimes they do save the best for last as was quite evident with the Pan-Roasted Duck finished off in a sauce of rich foie gras and smoked honey.  The duck was perfectly cooked, its meat a perfect medium tender and juicy.  Not being a big fan of foie I appreciated that the ingredient was transformed into a sauce featuring more smoked honey than foie.\n\nOrders for hot coffee and additional drinks were taken as most of the attendees sat quietly satisfied by the huge food coma that had taken hold of them.  We were given just a bit of time before the dessert trio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ#ziwSbBsQQYEZmh56ABVD8w) was brought out.  On this night the three components of dessert consisted of a Warm Apple Tart which sat on top of a smooth caramel sauce, a very lemony Lemon Cake surrounded by delightful fruit gellees, and a decadent Dark Chocolate Cake topped off by a Toffee Crisp.\n\nAs stuffed as we were it seems we all found extra space in putting away that amazing trio of desserts capping off a splendid evening made possible by the fabulous accommodations, dedicated staff and delicious food from Spruce.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

That's a comfortable outfit and definitely has a place, but I do like the excuse to dress up a bit every now and then.\n\nThe scallops are delicious each and every time.

Both were fin, quite sweet. \n\nFor apps, I had the cauliflower soup- which was tasty, very rich. He had the scallops, which were lovely and sweet and very well cooked. We both had the rib eye that was on the menu- nicely cooked, greens were tasty, but the duck fat potatoes were disappointing. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of red wine- which took several reminders to bring out, and was cold when it was served. I only drink red wine cold when it's a cheap bottle and I'm with my girlfriends, pretending it's sangria without the effort of fruit! I told the waiter it was too cold and he said that was how it was meant to be, and that was the temperature of the cellar.

In fact, as soon as we stepped into the restaurant, we could hardly find a suitable place to stand because the place was packed! The expansive bar flanking the right side of the darkly lit restaurant boasted crowds of people socializing and imbibing on various cocktails and drinks. The dining room was completely full and I became increasingly concerned that our wait was going to be a lengthy one!  \n\nLuckily, there was additional seating in the back of the restaurant in a more stately, albeit quiet and more brightly lit private room.\n\nAfter being seated by the host, we were kindly greeted by our server. We were all feeling a bit peckish at the time, which resulted in us taking little to no time to make our subsequent orders . Considering we were sort of tucked away from the rest of the dining crowd, our server made his rounds and ensured that our waters were always filled. Food also arrived at a comfortable pace with appetizers naturally arriving first.\n\nGruyere Cheese Puffs - These light and airy puffs of cheesy goodness were absolutely divine and an excellent start to our sumptuous meal.\n\nDiver Scallops - Seared beautifully, these thick and fleshy medallions were plump and absolutely mouthwatering. The crunchy crab cake and pistachio added a nice contrast of texture and flavor, as well! \n\nFoie Gras - Served two ways, torchon and in a spreadable form. It was buttery soft and perfectly fatty. The addition of the crisp pear slices were refreshing and the accompanying pear jelly was delicately sweet. I enjoyed the whimsical addition of the waffle which added a pleasant twist to the standard cracker or bread that typically comes with foie gras.\n\nSweetbreads - Plump, juicy, and flavorful! The added caramelized cippolini onions and fresh figs imparted a naturally sweet and rustic flavor and the accompanying bacon lardon vinaigrette added a nice zing and pleasant crunch as well.\n\nEntrees arrived soon after and to be perfectly frank, they looked incredible!\n\nButter Poached Lobster - This plate would have been perfect if the portion of lobster was just a tad bit more generous. Each bite of luscious lobster with the pillowy soft gnocci was decadently sublime but within moments I felt like my dish all but disappeared! Two words: \"more please!\"\n\nLiberty Farms Duck - Served with freshly shaved foie gras, and drizzled with an irresistible smoked honey jus, this perfectly seared duck was succulent and tasted almost like tender filet.  \n\nSlow Roasted Beef Short Rib - Served atop perfectly cooked red wine farotto and accompanied with an erbette chard, horseradish velout\u00e9 and soft young carrots. This dish was phenomenal! The meat was beyond tender and virtually broke apart with the slightest nudge of a fork. The aroma was intoxicating and the flavor profiles were explosive. In short, i loved this dish!\n\nDessert\n\nCaramel Corn Panna Cotta - Texture, flavor and consistency were similar to flan but much lighter and smoother! The glazed blueberries were plump and mildly tart and the popcorn brittle was fantastic with a buttery crunch!\n\nBasque Cake - Dense and buttery with a nice contrast from the concord grape sorbet.\n\nBlueberry Jellies and Lemon Verbena Caramels - These delicious bite size treats arrived with our check and i must say it was a fantastic conclusion to our sublime dining experience! \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with Spruce. The food & service were fantastic and the ambiance was sleek, contemporary and cool. \n\nBased upon my experience alone, It's pretty clear to me why they received a Michelin Star in 2011. I'm likely to return to try their famous burger which recently made the coveted 7x7 dining list!\n\nHappy Eats!", "author": "Kent D."}

Wait for a special occasion and go.\n\nMathematical version: If Johnny and Debbie want a magnificent meal, but they want the deliciousness, freshness, and artistry of the food (ie its qualitative worth) versus its price (ie quantitative worth) to be no more than a 2:3 ratio, where the difference is made up by an atmosphere and level of service that is, ideally, a 1:3 ratio, does the sum total of the Spruce  experience versus its menu result in the ideal quotient of 1?\n\nEnglish version: Yes, the prices are steep--and yes, they are indeed worth it. Each plate, whether appetizer or entree, is perfectly crafted and balanced. The flavors are impeccable but not overwhelming, and there is just enough creativity paired with nods to straightforward comfort. For example, the fois gras terrine is a silken delight, creatively enhanced with rhubarb and strawberry preserves and crumbled pistachios, and served on crispy brioche; it's almost more a dessert than an appetizer. On the other hand, the chicken and mushroom entree is pure simplicity: excellent, moist, perfectly roasted chicken doesn't really need any other fancy additions besides flavorful, meaty mushrooms, a bit of rainbow chard for the balance of greens, and the nutty bite of thinly sliced grana padano cheese. The menu is a blend of international cuisines with a California twist and an especial dash of French. The wine list is perfect: treat the exceptional sommeliers like captains steering your wine-watered way through the menu and you won't be disappointed. For that matter, take a photograph of the wine list when no one is looking--you'll probably want to find those choices for your own collection. The atmosphere is simple and chic, dark wood and low lighting, romantic in a way that works for couples, families, or friends. Take your time there: no one is rushing you, and the food begs to be slowly savored. The portions look tiny but are so rich you'll find it somewhat difficult to contemplate dessert--but do yourself a favor and get the beignets. Every meal should end with warm, sugary, melt-in-the-mouth pillows of delight.", "author": "Ali M."}

We must have hit an off day because I was disappointed in many ways.  Both tables on either side of us were empty at one point and the bus staff must have replaced the linens on each 4 times.  Someone would come over, put linen on the table, iron the linen but didn't finish setting the place.  Then someone else would remove the linen, bring another one and not finish, etc...  The first time, I figured there was a spot but to do that over and over?  So distracting!  I spilled my glass of water and it hit the bowl of raw sugar.  I think it took 10 minutes for anyone to come over.  The waitress finally cleaned it up so I asked for another glass of water.  She tried to refill the existing glass that was covered in sugar.  Even if she didn't see the sugar, you would think she would replace the glass anyhow.  Service was also very slow. We weren't in a hurry but it took a long time for everything.  The two tables on either side of us got the wrong checks showing how disorganized it all was.\n\nSome of this would be forgiven if the food was fab.  I had the eggs benedict and my eggs were underdone.  My husband had the french toast and said it was average.  Coffee cake was good but we should have ordered it after our main courses because it was so sweet (no surprise so that was our fault!).   \n\nWe had to wonder - was there no manager the day we went??

We had perused the menu in advance and with decadent items like beignets and fresh ricotta blintzes headlining the menu, you have two options: either go big or stay home. \n\nClearly, we decided to go big. We started with mimosas made with freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice and a plate of the banana bread, which I believe is first (under) baked and then pan fried to accentuate the gooey inside and crispy perimeter. The sinful cherry on top was the extra-large pat of butter lazily melting into every square centimeter of the banana bread. So good, that my friend placed an additional to-go order just before leaving the restaurant.\n\nFor our mains, I tried the steak and eggs special and Christy had the lobster Benedict. Everything was prepared perfectly - this is California-inspired American food at its best!\n\nThe dining room is very handsome in a masculine way with its hues of rich espresso, making it more fancy and less casual yet there's nothing pretentious about it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-13", "description": "***Spruce is considered one of San Francisco's best restaurants and you can see glimpses of their potential in a lot of the food here, but I just find it a notch below similarly priced or even lower priced restaurants like Farmhouse Inn & Restaurant, Beast, Frasca, and Tar & Roses***\n\nSpruce occupies a tough area of upscale dinning.  It is definitely less expensive than ambitious and dainty fine dining spots like Quince, Saison and Benu (Spruce is understandably not as impressive as those places too). Spruce is also more expensive than upscale rustic restaurants like Frances in San Francisco or Tar & Roses in Los Angeles (two restaurants Spruce feels similar to in terms of menu and plating).  It is not fair to compare Spruce to the likes of Quince, Saison and Benu even if it is considered one of the best restaurants in the city.  The food at Spruce is not as creative and lacks the molecular gastronomy theatrics or art-on-a-plate presentations.  Still, Spruce serves the type of food that can be equally satisfying as long as high quality ingredients, skill in cooking the proteins and satisfying flavor combinations all come together.\n\nSpruce can put out great good.  The gnocchi I had a few years ago was exceptional and the scallops this time around were very good.  The scallops featured a crisp, flavorful sear to go with a moist and soft center and the garnishes were great--sweetness and tartness from the cranberry sauce, a creamy sunchoke puree, nicely blistered Brussels sprouts, and perfectly roasted salsify.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the meal was in the good but not great range. The duck breast entree featured a great crispy skin even if the skin was too salty.  The meat though on the other hand could have used more seasoning.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Garnishes included very good boudin noir and also wheatberries with huckleberries.  The dish itself was fine, but it suffered from being too big.  It was kind of a lot to eat and the flavors did not build so I got a little tired of eating it.\n\nThe tagliatelle with white truffle was too big as well.  The tagliatelle was great--good flavor and a good texture.  The butter sauce had a good flavor while also not being too heavy.  Unfortunately, there was too much pasta, which resulted in the small portion of white truffle losing its impact.  The white truffle on the plate did have a great aroma.\n\nThe banana split was also too large considering most of the components were just okay.  The caramelized banana had a great creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e candied top, but a lot of restaurants are doing this with bananas these days so it did not feel that special.  There was also too much whipped cream.  Three ice cream flavors were featured--vanilla bean, salted caramel and a very rich and indulgent dark chocolate (the best thing on the plate).\n\nThe banana split also featured chocolate and caramel sauces, nuts and chocolate cookie crumble.  It was a satisfying enough dessert but for a restaurant of Spruce's quality, it was disappointing.  Their beignets are a much better dessert here.\n\nService was okay.  The staff was friendly enough, but I felt it did take a little bit of time to be seated and to order.  The food came out a quick and even pace though.\n\nPrices are high for entrees.  Their entrees are in the high $30s and the entrees are not significantly better than similar restaurants like Frances and Tar & Roses that feature entrees in the $25-$32 range.\n\nSpruce has a nice dining room, but it is a little dark, which does not allow the food presentations or the great looking brown wood throughout the restaurant to pop.\n\nI wish what I had ordered at Spruce was more enjoyable.  Spruce is the type of restaurant where if you order right (and fitting with your personal tastes), you are likely to have an excellent meal.  It is hard for these types of upscale restaurants to consistently take straightforward cuisine and turn it into something remarkable, but I've had noticeably better upscale rustic dinner experiences at Farmhouse Inn & Restaurant in Forestville, Beast in Portland and Mark Sullivan's other restaurant The Village Pub in Woodside.  Because of that, I would say Spruce is a good to maybe very good restaurant but just not an exceptional one.\n\nThere is free street parking in the nearby residential area, but open spaces are hard to find.", "author": "Anthony N."}

My entree should have been more appropriately called \"chicken with side salad\" not a chicken salad.

Overall, the level of service (particularly how they exceeded our expectations), attention to detail with the food, and the overall \"sensory experience\" of our food makes this place one of my favorite burger spots in San Francisco. The burger gets a high 4 out of 5 stars, but the level of service and the atmosphere of the restaurant, including the decor, makes this a five star experience that I would be happy to go back toand spend $24 on a burger anytime.\n\nMy friend Andrew and I came here for our monthly burger tour of San Francisco, and it was my turn to choose the place. I had read and heard about the burger here but thought that it would probably be over rated since it's about 20 dollars... For a burger.   But there have been enough positive reviews from friends, that I decided it was time to give it a try.\n\nAnd you and I sat in the bar area, and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The decor is sophisticated and classy, and there's a good energy yet peacefulness. It's a really nice, comfortable balance.  We were offered complimentary gougeres, which was a nice unexpected touch, and they were delicious and light.\n\nThen we ordered our burgers, and I got mine medium rare with a unique French cheese, replacing the fries with mixed greens, dressing on the side. That's my typical order.  And it was executed so well. \n\nThe bun, which gets a lot of attention for being an English muffin, didn't seem like an ordinary English muffin and was a good textural compliment to the well cooked meat that had lots of flavor. The cheese that was a really pleasant addition to the burger (maybe it was l'poise?).  I did add the toppings they offer with the burger after eating half of it just the meat and cheese, to see what the toppings would add.  The toppings gave a real nice balance of acidity and a tiny bit of sweetness that made the burger really stand out as one of the best burgers I've had in San Francisco.\nHalfway through the meal, the waitress checked in to see if our burgers were cooked to an appropriate level. We both really appreciated this, because we've both had overcooked burgers before.  It's such a simple question but it made it clear that they take pride in the food and experience they offer.\n\nAnd to finish our meal, we were given a plate of too small squares of peanut butter fudge that were amazing! \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  I know how many people decide to write Yelp reviews before sharing their experience with the business either in person or in a conversation, but it helps them (and other sustomers) for them to know about that your experience first hand. I found it really helpful in the past to share my experiences, as it either reinforces really good service and experiences, or help change bad experiences in the good ones.\n\nFor example, I took the time to share my Spruce experience with the general manager the next day over the phone (yes, that's how good it was), and he really appreciated it and made sure to share it with the staff.  He said that's why he does what he does, to make sure folks have a good, memorable experience, and that me calling him made his dat. I heard him smiling over the phone.  Yelp! reviews are helpful to share with other folks, but try going one step further and share your good experiences and bad experiences with the staff and managers at a place of service before deciding to write a yelp review: you can have a really positive impact on a business.", "author": "Andrew D."}

I haven't been to such an upscale place in a longggg time.. most of the restaurants in SF, although brilliant food-wise, are still pretty casual. Glad I wore a dress. People were in straight-up ball gowns. Also I was almost definitely the youngest person in the place.\n\nHad been meaning to check the place out for more than a year and then YAY Novartis wants to fly in a super awesome MD at the top of field from NYP and have him teach us about CML while Spruce wines and dines us? Was not about to say no to that.\n\nSo we had a set menu: salad, rib eye (no one ordered the sonoma chicken option), and a chocolatey cake. Everything was on point, and that may be the best rib eye I have ever had. It wasn't super fatty but it was incredibly juicy, with that crust on the edges. Whatever house red they chose to keep flowing was amazing too.. I could have drank way too much of that but I did manage to keep my composure and limit myself to 2 glasses. OH only weird thing is that my entree didn't come with its side of potatoes.. which is especially odd given that there were like a dozen of the same dish being served at the same time at our table. How did they miss that? One of these is not like the other...? My peers took pity on me and donated potatoes though, so don't worry. PS they were delicious.\n\nWe were so taken by the place that we stayed after the lecture to sip on some cocktails at the bar. Super sweet bartender, happy to make whatever your heart desires and make recommendations, etc. Drinks were exceptional. We also got to spend a little time in the little bar/bakery area near the front, smelling the beignets.

Food was alright, service was ...awkward, and my slice of birthday cake at the end was SO TINY.\n\nI'm a huge fan of places that serve food before your food. You know, like you get that little basket of bread and all that good stuff? Call me Miss Piggy but that shit is really exciting. Not only did Spruce have bread, it had these wonderful cheese balls (how sad, I wish I knew a fancier name for them) that was probably the best part of my meal. I ordered the Liberty Farms Duck Breast because I was feelin' adventurous. It was pretty good, but there were some things on my plate that I couldn't tell what they were/if they were edible - one thing I do not enjoy about fancy restaurants. My friend had raved about the Sweet White Corn Soup, which was our starter, and when it came out I almost screamed because it looked like the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. It wasn't all that tasty, but it wasn't bad either. Don't recommend it, although my friend probably would.\n\nThe servers there are extremely awkward. Every time they would arrive in the middle of our conversations, they would just awkwardly wait there for several seconds instead of just stepping in. I understand not wanting to interrupt but the way it was all carried out was making me so uncomfortable. People are going to be talking in restaurants, and you have to know how to get their food to them rather than just standing their and waiting for minutes.\n\nAs for dessert, I really wish I hadn't told them it was my birthday so I could have gotten a decent size dessert. They brought out a plate that said Happy Birthday in melted chocolate, with a candle and slice of cake which was all really sweet and I appreciated it, but the cake was literally two bites, one for me and one for my friend. It was a really good (bite of) cake too, which kind of made me sad because WHY WAS IT SO SMALL LIKE WHO DOES THAT. The dessert menu looked pretty good and I thought it would be rude to ask for more food (dessert) after such an already-expensive dinner so I just settled on that tiny sliver of cake. Bad job Spruce, minus one star just for the small cake. Yes, it's a big deal.\n\nThis is definitely a nice place for a fancy date, if you're into all that, but I can guarantee there are nicer places. For the price that was paid, I could have probably gotten 3 meals I was more satisfied with, and not have dealt with awkward service.

I was in Sausalito for the weekend with my wife for our anniversary and decided to pick a nice spot that wasn't too long of a drive for dinner that night. I found Spruce on the Michelin Star Guide, so figured it must be good with all of these reviews as well. \n\nSeating/Ambiance:\nThey sat us to the right in a private room which only has about 5 tables or so. I really enjoyed the seating as it was quiet and more romantic, but there was a smell that was bothering my wife, so we moved to the main dining room. The main dining room is really loud and not romantic at all. It's just your basic restaurant. \n\nService:\nService was horrible. I've been to a lot of nice restaurants around the world and this was by far one of the worst I've experienced. Why? For starts the waiters kind of have a chip on their shoulder like they know their food is good and just assume you like it. Well, guess what? The food isn't that great and I didn't like it. My wife really hated her duck, because it was pretty much mostly fat, the skin wasn't crunchy, and the mille-feuille was soft and not tasty. When the waiter asked if my wife liked her food, she explained that she didn't like it and the mille-feuille was soft. The waiter was shocked that she didn't like the food and just assumed that my wife does not understand good food. Either way, whether my wife understand good food or not, the customer should always be right, right? He took the food and didn't even ask if she would like something else or take it off the bill or anything. Another situation was when they brought us some gruyere cheese puffs like the ones that you would get at a Churrascaria (Brazilian steakhouse) and brought it to the table. I wanted to know what it was to ensure there was not pork inside, since I don't eat pork. The lady kept saying it has gruyere, but was pronouncing very weird. She was really trying to fluff up the pronunciation of the cheese and spoke in a very condescending manner as if I don't know what gruyere cheese is. Come on now. Btw, the cheese puffs were no good anyways. Lastly, I read online about the chocolate chip cookies and wanted to order some. I asked the waiter and he was like. Well, I don't know, let me see what I can do. Trying to act like he was doing us a favor. On our way out I dropped the cookie on the floor in front of the bar at the entrance and someone came real quick to grab me another one from the bar. They had tons of cookies at the bar, btw. \n\nFood:\nThe food is average to below average. We got some soup that was nothing special. We got some sweetbreads for an appetizer and it was horrible. I really like sweetbread and was disappointed to see that they made theirs with kale and it was extra salty. We ordered a salad, which was good, but who doesn't make a good salad. My wife ordered the duck, which I have already described above how horrible that was. I ordered the steak. The steak was good. It wasn't amazing though and nothing special at all. Dessert, we got this apple tart. It was also just average. Overall, the worst Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to. How does Gary Danko and this place both have 1 star? I don't understand that. Maybe they provide different service for different people? Maybe they keep changing up the menu and we went on a horrible night where the chef was experimenting? I really don't know and don't care. There are so many restaurants that are really superb in the city and this is just not one of them and I'll never be back. I went back to read most of the good reviews and most of them are for the burger. So, maybe it's just a good brunch/lunch/burger type of spot, but there are so many good brunch/burger spots in the city that it's not even worth giving this place another try. My 2 cents.\n\nBtw, management contacting via yelp to discuss my experience after leaving this 2 star review. I left my phone number, but they never called back.

I think it's mostly an excuse to eat nice dinners. \n\nFood here is pretty decent, service is pretty awesome too. Things I expect from Michelin starred restaurants so it was great. \n\nWe started with a bread and amuse. The bread I chose was the cranberry bread (suggested by fellow Yelpers) and the cinnamon butter. The butter provided a great sweet note to the already sweet cranberry bread. Definitely enjoyed it. The amuse was this gruyere puff which was like a cheese puff...or a more fancy version of the biscuits you get at Red Lobster (which btw are delicious). \n\nI started with the scallops because well I love scallops. I was expecting diver scallops seared nicely with the food, but we got small bay scallops. What made me sad was that the dish wasn't that hot. It was lukewarm at best. Because of that, I didn't enjoy the dish as much as I should have. Still a good dish, just not that amazing. Then I got the duck breast and foie gras. There was a few raw endives which made the whole eating process weird and not that good. The duck was great - wonderfully cooked, but the foie was delicious. I really would have preferred a good mashed potato instead of then endive. We finished with the beignets (which you can totally share). So delicious and the two sauces that came with it (chocolate sauce and creme anglaise) were good too. The creme anglaise was definitely the most delicious. I also got to try a bit of the warm apple tart that one of my coworkers go. The ice cream and the apples were delicious!\n\nOverall, a great experience, but it wasn't amazing.

After awhile, a guy came around with bread (3 options: cranberry - awesome, whole wheat and a sourdough roll). This came with 2 types of butter, whipped with salt and a cinnamon sugar. So far, so good.\n\nWe ordered our meals and a bottle of wine from the most extensive wine list I think I've ever seen. The appetizers were just alright - the Caesar wasn't noteworthy - came with croutons smeared with anchovies, the mussels (which I got) were the best of the 3 by far (1/2 lb. is MORE than enough for 1-2 people), and the steak tartar was fine, but was described as spicy, which it was not.\n\nThen they brought a couple dishes from the chef (a Gruyere-filled puff pastry, which was more like a puff pastry ball lined with a hint of cheese and a small scallop dish with dashi  - 3 tiny scallops per plate). The scallops may have been the best thing of the night (that, or the mussels).\n\nThe entrees are where we ran into trouble. All three of us got the highly-recommended sturgeon (big mistake). As we dove into our entrees, all three of us looked up at each other in disgust. We all though the fish had gone bad. We continued on, determined to think that a $39 entree couldn't have tasted this bad. Although certain bites were better than others (with our own addition of salt and peppre), overall, we were all extremely disappointed with the dish and all left a big piece of fish on our plates. The crab meat and croquettes on the side, as well as the potato hash (they called chowder) were the best part of the dish. \n\nIn order to wash the terrible taste out of our mouth (AFTER putting mints in our mouths to try to eradicate the aftertaste), we ordered coffee (which tasted burnt) and the trio of ice creams (house made: vanilla, cinnamon and coffee - GREAT). They also brought out a citrus cake (was this supposed to be frozen?) on the house for the birthday girl, as well as chocolate peanut butter petit fours with the bill - which, as expected, was really high. We paid and left, decisively as a group to never return for anything more than a cocktail.", "author": "Lauren C."}

Very cozy, from the nice decor, tables perfectly spaced apart, and down-to-earth and very attentive service. \n\nI've been hearing/reading rave reviews about Spruce since it opened and, yep, I've heard about one of the leading candidates for the best burger in SF.\n\nThe burger was very good indeed.  I can't help but think that it was my fault it fell short of spectacular.  I added way too much bells and whistles that it made my burger slightly too salty.  Word to the wise (which is not me, apparently) stick to the basics.  \"Kiss\" as people say...\"Keep It Simple, Stupid.\"  Certainly, Spruce's burger had enough good things going that you don't need bacon, egg, etc. etc. to add to the experience.\n\nThe meat was nicely seasoned and the beefy aroma was really apparent, a feature I've always found lacking in grass fed beef.  But the star of the show was the house-made English muffin bun.  Fan-tas-tic.  I know what you're thinking, I'm raving about a burger and saying the best part was the bun?  Whaa?  Who does that?  That's like raving about the 96 Bulls and saying Steve Kerr carried the team.  Anyway, trust me.  The bun was good, and the bread-to-meat ratio was spot on.\n\nOh, one more thing, the best fries in SF is not in Cafe Claude (although Claude's is very good), Spruce takes the cake...perfectly crispy and hot...very very good (fried in duck fat, what do you expect?).\n\nAnyway, though I didn't find the best burger in SF here, it's a burger well worth the $14 price tag, but you absolutely have to get the fries.", "author": "Angel S."}

Since we came for the DAT menu, my friend and I (also his birthday the day we came) did not expect that it would be the best they had to offer and certainly we were right so let me just go straight to reviewing the food. \n\nFirst of all the appetizer was supposedly a chilled gazpacho (in simple terms: a cold tomato based soup). From what I observed from other people's soups, they give you a bowl with some ingredients and toppings and they pour the soup Into this bowl. We saw another group get a bowl with potatoes, spices, and thyme so I got pretty excited on what my friend and I would receive. The waiter delivers our bowl and it was straight up fruit in our bowl. I thought maybe it would give a more fragrant and diverse flavor palette to the meal especially after the waiter poured our soup. After the soup was poured, my friend and I tried it and gave each other that (insert cover over mouth emoji face) and were completely grossed out. It tasted like watermelon more than tomato. You can probably make something that tastes similar by cutting watermelon into a zip lop bag and pouring the leftover juices in a bowl and adding some salt. That's what it tasted like! \n\nSecond course: the entree (fish with Gorgonzola beans) was not bad. The fish was properly seasoned and the sauce for the fish was pretty good. The beans were unevenly cooked (some were hard and some were really soft). But overall this was the best course.\n\nThird course: dessert (cookies, beignets, and a strawberry shortcake like dessert). The DAT menu only offered a cookie which was a mixture of chocolate and marshmallow. In addition to this we got a birthday dessert for my friend which reminded me of a strawberry shortcake and melted in my mouth. Lastly we ordered the beignets which came with different sauces to dip in. They were just the right temperature and were just perfect with the caramel like sauce. I would go again just for these. \n\nIn general, spruce gives that fancy casual feel and attracts many business people. Practically everyone had a button up or nice shirt or blouse. In my one hour and a half there I did not see anyone under 30 besides an elementary school girl and her mom who spoiled her daughter with the most expensive course from each part of the menu (so I wouldn't count her as part of the typical crowd haha) \n\nThe service was really good and they also had the waiter iron our table before we got on. Some personal notes: they sang a really sad and unenthusiastic birthday song to my friend. The waiters gave our entree to someone else then after the people told them it wasn't there's, the waiter brought it to our table 5 min later (which is a complete no no to me) \n\nI know that dine about town should not really reflect this place but from the atmosphere and service I would say it fits a particular business oriented/upper class population and just wasn't my taste. To pay 45 dollars per person for a so so meal was not the best thing but it was a nice experience to try Spruce, a restaurant that I have always dreamed to go to after I would go to the doctors.\n\nSome cool things to note: the butter for the bread is tasty, parking is really hard to find, you might want to make a reservation because there is a good amount of people during lunch time (and it wasn't because of dine about town because many people were regulars from what our waiter told us) and the bathrooms are really nice :) \n\nWould I go here again for DAT? No. Would I go here once I make more money? Maybe.", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

Although we were probably the youngest people there (I'm 29 and he's 33) and we kinda stuck out with our heavily tattooed selves, the crowd was pleasant. \n\nThe only reason I withheld a star is because our waitress had quite obviously done one too many lines of coke...

If you know me by reading some of my reviews, I'm always on the search for the best burger in town. Originally we were suppose to kill two birds with one stone and hit up Marlowes and Spruce, since they are highly known to have the best burgers in SF. FAILED....... Sad face when I arrived to Marlowes the restaurant was closed. While looking inside, the owner saw us and said \"sorry\" I have to close the restaurant at least one day a week or my wife will kill me. LOL!! I told him no worries were coming back... \n\nMoving forward, while finding parking in this little neighborhood (laurel heights) I would of never expected to find Spruce hidden in between Victorian homes and little boutiques. Upon arrival there was a host standing at the podium asking us if we would like to sit at the bar or dining area, of course we choose the dining area. The restaurant was very elegant and fancy... Service was great, felt like a princess as everyone that helped served us from our drinks to our appetizers, or even \nthe guy who whisked our table, ask us each time is there anything else I can get for you?? Very pleasant. (SMILING) \n\nI took the liberty of ordering a glass of Riesling, Kabinett and my friend ordered some kind of Mojito type of drink. Results? We both loved it! Not to sweet but refreshing. Our first entr\u00e9e was the Cara Cara orange and brassica salad . Results? Picture oil cured black olives, pistachios, on a bed of fresh spring lettuce with citrus dressing. Need I say more? \n\nOnto the main reason why I came here, Yes our burgers came out. My burger consisted of Niman Ranch ground chuck beef with Gruy\u00e8re cheese melted on their house made version of an English muffin. My burger was topped with pickled red onions and zucchini. My first bite reaction? OMG SO EFFIN GOOD... It was like fireworks bursting inside my mouth. That bad boy was soo JUICY it was dripping on the side of my cheek LOL. The zucchini also gave it a kick to its flavor, due to it was marinated in some sort of spice. \n\nDid I mention about their french fries? WOWZERS they were on hit!! French fries cooked in Duck fat~ another plus!! Had the perfect crunch & crisp. Not a soggy fry in sight!! I didn't even get to finish my burger because I was so full.

As a SF native, I was shocked at how long this place has been around and I had not yet experienced it. Perhaps, it is the location, which is not bad , just, a bit strange. The edge of Presidio Heights, kinda just planted in a row of houses... but, once inside, the place is beautiful. Modern, classic, stylish and inviting. The bar service was rapid and impressive and once seated I did notice that the tables were perhaps a bit too close, but with SF rents what they are, I guess you must deal with it.\n\nThe food was impressive. From the salad course you immediately knew you were in for a treat, really light balanced flavorful dressing, farm fresh ingredients and creative combinations. My wife and I shared two different salads , both delicious in their own. I had a halibut in broth that was so perfectly cooked, so flavorful, that I even went for the bread (my sworn enemy in life ..) to dip in the broth. My wife had a filet and raved about it for days. The portion size was adequate, the food was hot and courses were timed perfectly. Food was also beautifully presented.\n\nOur server was a trooper as he tried to stay focused on our needs while being completely ran around by the couple of idiots at the next table who changed all the ingredients in dishes and then sent them back because they were \"not as expected\" (once again, the tables are too close!)\n\nThe only improvement comment I would make is that Spruce has opted for this new trend of having a wine list composed of \"wines we think are exceptional, but, you have never heard of, nor tried\" sort of the hipster music view applied to wine. Look, I am as open minded as the next guy when it come to being exposed to new wines, especially if work has gone into curating the list. But, please give me few \"soft landing\" choices for the nights when I want a trusted favorite. Is it too much to ask for some Cakebread, Jordan, DuMol or Silver Oak?

Chef Mark Sullivan is exceptionally talented; each dish was exquistely presented and tasted every bit as good as it looked. So why not 5 Stars? A restaurant with a 5 Star rating should have food equally as excellent as the service and unfortunately, Spruce was lacking in the latter.\n\nLast night, 4.5.11, my friends and I arrived promptly for our 6 PM reservations and were seated immediately.\n\nW I N E:\nSpruce has an extensive 77-page wine list. Bottles range from $28 to a $8,200 Magnum so there's something for everyone.  \n\nChris, our sommelier was friendly, knowledgeable and well-versed. After telling him what kind of flavors I like, he suggested the 2008 Pinot Noir WillaKenzie ($14/glass) which was excellent.

Each bite of the foie gras melted like a triple cream butter on my palate. The preserved foie gras was like a fine pate, velvety smooth and rich with a slight gaminess. The buttery brioche was the perfect canvas and texture contrast to the preserved foie gras. The pineapple, however, did not complement either of the foie gras because it had an overpowering sweetness similar to syrup.\n\n*CHARRED BERKSHIRE PORK TENDERLOIN w/ Crispy Pork Belly & Shelling Beans ($29):  The BEST Pork Dish I've ever had!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=82FX8gETInO5LNNFPFaNsw\n\nThere were 3 different cuts: center loin, loin end and the pork belly, each with its own distinctive flavor and texture. Like a fine filet mignon, the center loin melted like butter. The loin end had a rosemary herb crust; it was tender and had a powerful herbaceous flavor but didn't overpower the natural pork flavor. The pork belly had a crackling crisp skin that was rich, yet lean. The neutral flavor of the tender shelling beans and the slight bitterness of the chard perfectly balanced the richness from the pork. Each flavorful bite sent me to FoodGASM ecstasy!\n\n*BEIGNETS w/ Chocolate Sauce & Cr\u00e8me Anglaise ($10): HEAVENLY!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=Fc5CSNmGESXke3Tf4u4gaw\n\nLike a slightly denser donut hole that's fresh out-of-the-fryer, the beignets were little balls of heaven. The cr\u00e8me angalise was the perfect dipping sauce adding a layer of sweet decadence with the floral aroma of vanilla. The chocolate sauce, on the other hand, was too sweet and rich for my liking.\n\n*COFFEE HAZELNUT MOUSSE CAKE w/ Hazelnut Praline ($10): SINFULLY GOOD!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=T9QheJnU8POlg4LShoyCRA\n\nLike a Ferrero Rocher in a cake form, the mousse was rich, yet light. Its sweet nuttiness was offset by the slight bitterness of the coffee.

Chris, our sommelier was awesome, however, Kevin, our waiter was not. Although cordial, Kevin was MIA the entire night; other than taking our order, bringing our food, and giving us our bill, he was nowhere to be found.

The evening started off a bit rough as no server was there for about 10 minutes after we were seated for our 6:45pm reservation. Then I realized our server Nick was held up by the party of 10 decisive about their order. But the evening only got better after this point.\n\nSpruce is all about attentiveness to details and ceremony. From the modern loungy decor down to details of the sugar jar and flatware. Bus-person ironed the table cloth to ready for the table next to us. Sommelier busied with pouring bottles and tasting them at the designated wine station. \n\n*Briochie cheese puffs on the house to begin. Savory and addictive.\n\n*Selection of bread from passing basket. Salted butter and cinnamon butter.\n\n*Cocktails: we both have cosmopolitans but with different vodkas. The well ($10) and Ketel One ($13) are both good. Pink and limey. I was a bit shocked they don't stock my #1 and #2 vodka choices: Goose and Belvedere. Cocktails served table-side and poured from shakers.\n\n*Caesar salad ($11): just what it's supposed to be, dressing light but flavored. \n\n*Harvest salad ($12): a most interesting mixture of beets, pears, chicories and pine nut. Something is bitter but canceled off by the beets and pears. I hardly noticed any pine nut. Presentation is excellent: looks like a flower.\n\nThe \"plat du jour\" is a 6 oz filet mignon with duck-fat potatoes and bordelaise for $50 but we decided to have fish.\n\n*Pan roasted black cod ($34): cooked just perfectly to preserve the moist and texture of the fish. It's peeled off with a gentle prod. Ham hock consumme a tasty base.\n\n*Roasted halibut ($36): slightly crispy on the outside, also cooked perfectly to preserve the moist. It's obvious Spruce masters their seafood preparation. Crispy brandade an interesting side.\n\nAs dinner progresses, Nick has been very attentive, checking on us frequently. We were tempted with dessert long before we finished our dinner. To end the meal we decided on beignets (8 for $10) with chocolate sauce and cr\u00e8me Anglaise. They are of the size of Arancini rice balls. Puffy and warm. Decadent and heavenly. Wash them down with Viennese coffee ($5). \n\nOverall the meal will go down as one of the most memorable this year. Service is a beautiful choreography. Food is impeccable. My only complaint is the lack of my preferred vodka choices and the noisy din of the space. This is the place for special occasion. Be aware of the dress code--dressy.", "author": "Matt Y."}

Half the party arrived at 8 and were told that our table was being prepared. At 8:10 the rest of our party arrived and were told there were still people at our table that hasn't left yet.. What surprised me is that they weren't truthful about the customers still there. We weren't seated until 8:30pm - 15 minutes past our reservations.\n\nLuckily, they made a comeback with their complimentary one pound mussels, which is originally $18 and a dish on the menu. The sauce was superb!! Best I've ever tasted to pair with mussels! The waiter we had was also a super super friendly and happy guy. He made our experience much better. We then got our two choices of butter: cinnamon and regular for our four different choices of bread. I chose the cranberry bread with bits of cranberry in it and liked the cinnamon butter with it best! We then got another complimentary cheese ball bread dish - which was still toasty with cheese flavor in it - yum! We also had the grand selection of the charcuterie, which I don't think I liked very much. Nothing tasted wow to me. The fried were overhyped by my friends because the ones we ordered came out a bit soggy :/ but they still tasted good - but I expected better. For the entree, I order the Local Sturgeon since the clam chowder and crab description caught my eye. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The fish was overcooked, hard, and wasn't the taste I expected :( which is why I give this place a 4 star (along with our seating issues). My friend's steak was not bad, but a bit overcooked as well. The pork loin would be my favorite dish out of all entree dishes. We then ordered beignets for dessert which paired well with the vanilla dip since I'm not a fan of dark chocolate. Delicious little donut balls that were still warm and soft. My friend also got a complimentary birthday dessert of some sort of strawberry cheesecake which was cute and delicious. My favorite dish of the whole night are the mussels! Get those for sure if you come :) the service was impeccable other than the seating thing, definitely worth a visit!", "author": "Amanda C."}

Was here for brunch at the bar on a Sunday and really loved the burger, a normal go-to for me at the bar. The burger was perfectly done, with great cheese and an awesome English muffin for the bun. Super tasty. They used to have a pastrami or corned beef sandwich (can't remember which one) and I miss that. I will say the drinks, while great, are way too small for the price...in fact, the smallest drinks (the tulip cocktail glass is ridiculously small) that I can think of across any restaurant I've been to. $15 for a cocktail isn't crazy, it's SF after all, but when the cocktail comes, it's a two sipper if you aren't careful. They use fresh ingredients, which is great...but it's just smaller glasses than anywhere else. The menu itself is pricy and I tend to enjoy the bar menu over the main restaurant, but all in all I do love the place. The space has held up well and is very pretty; nice and warm, leathers, great lighting and nicely done.", "author": "Michael C."}

I really loved the ambience of this place and its formal setting. In a town where most people can dress in free t-shirts and go to nice restaurants, it was refreshing to see a place with so many people dressed so nicely and formally. It's a rare sight in SF... It's a good place for business dinners as well. Service was pretty good as well. We ordered the antipasto platter and I enjoyed the variety of salumi and other items they had. However, I was really disappointed by their burger, which I ordered with foie gras. I'm not sure if I just made the wrong choice on the menu. The burger was on the dry side and the foie gras was super greasy. I felt like I just chewing on a piece of fat soaked bread (no actually, it literally was a piece of fat soaked bread). Because it was so fatty and dry at the same time, I couldn't eat fast enough and soon the burger got cold and became impossible to eat with hardened fat. The fries were only OK, my favorite thing was the ketchup. I feel I wasted money ordering a nice piece of foie gras only to have it added to a poorly made burger.", "author": "Sam C."}

The surprises did not end there:\nThe waiter was erratic in his attention-- initially very friendly and attentive; but towards the end of the meal he was no where to be found.\nI started with the beets and my friend with the soup.  Both were tasty; not noteworthy, but pleasant enough.  Next, I had the ahi and my friend the gnocchi.  The ahi STUNK--that rancid, fishy smell--but the waiter was no where to be found for the next 30-minutes, so I picked at the lettuce on my plate.  My friend said her gnocchi tasted like something from a can--I tasted it and agreed.  We both pushed the food on our plates until the server came to remove them.  As he picked up the dishes, there was no comment asking why the food was still there, uneaten and as I said previously, the waiter was completely absent.\nWhen the waiter did finally return he never asked about our meal, just started pushing dessert options and coffee.  He was so distracted and uninterested, I decided not to take the time to complain.\nThe heart seems to have gone from Spruce which is too bad. I won't go back.  \nAnother friend recently mentioned she had planned a lunch at Spruce.  After I described my experience, she told me she was going to cancel the reservation and book at another restaurant.", "author": "Kevin W."}

Is that a fancy restaurant?\"  That was then, this is now.  I am a foodie now.\n\nMy friend Taylor and I decided at the last minute to take our friend Alyse out for a nice goodbye dinner.  It was Sunday and we needed reservations for Wednesday night; Spruce had a few tables open (Gary Danko staff kindly scoffed when Taylor called for a table).\n\nThe three of us arrived early and we were seated not long after.  We shared the charcuterie and duck fat fries for starters.  The charcuterie was excellent for sharing and everything was delicious.  The winner was the beef tongue and the loser was the rabbit.\n\nAlyse and I had the lobster and Taylor had the duck.  The lobster was good, but the duck was amazing!  The different textures worked well together (foie gras, crispy skin, tender meat) and my favorite part was the crispy skin.  The butter sauce that came with the lobster was so good that I ate it all up with bread.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and the gnocchi was good but I wasn't really into the braised lettuce.\n\nFor dessert we had the beignets.  This was also good for sharing -- eight beignets were plenty for us.  They were good but were covered in too much sugar, especially since they are to be dipped in chocolate or custard sauce.\n\nCocktails were also delicious and service was excellent.

As you enter, you get a sense of its class/traditional flair with the dim lights and dark wood finished tables, and white table linens (that are pressed with a cordless iron upon table set up). However, I was unimpressed by the modern art work didn't quite seem to match (sorry no pics to prove my point). \n\nUpon arriving with Mom to celebrate my actual birthday (10/7), there was a little mishap as one of the hosts could not find our reservation in their system. I made it via Opentable, and later confirmed with a phone call, so it was most definitely there. The host had the nerve to suggest sitting at the bar when there were plenty of 2-4 top tables available. After what seemed like forever, another host was able to find our reservation and sat us in the back corner table. Perfect, and I was hungry and ready to put that mini drama aside. \n\nService was great. Our lead server (name escapes me but she's a lovely gal from SJ) was friendly and attentive. The bussers were efficient and refilled waters, cleared plates, etc., Let's get down to main event, the food! \n\n1) Watermelon and feta salad - Excellent and refreshing combination with the juicy watermelon and the saltiness of the feta. Tasty! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=I5Wwfn2eB_-ZzIQAppernA \n\n2) Heirloom tomato with burrata cheese - Special salad, and the ginormous tomatoes were sweet and that cheesy goodness that is burrata was amazing. Can you say 'Oh Mylanta!' \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=NsyXlAQkTxisLYpr3Ndinw \n\n3) Butter poached lobster with potato gnocchi - Of course, I had to get my lobbie, which was the most expensive thing on the menu, but who cares as it's my birthday. This sauce was mouth watering and savory, and the gnocchi was the perfect accompaniment to the lobbie. Wished the lobbie portion was bigger.. sigh.. Anywho, I literally wiped the plate clean with dipping the bread in that absolutely delish sauce. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=-RkE_zIbrjGaRDtFXcRoQg \n\n4) Pork Tenderloin with crisp pork belly - Mom ordered this, while the pork was tender and flavorful, it was disappointing because the pork belly wasn't exactly crisp, but not soggy either. Just don't call it crisp if it's not going to be, you know? \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=_Zo5O-uNZgwGF4bSKGlOGw \n\n5) Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding (with chocolate molten core) with strawberries and olive oil ice cream - One of the best desserts I've ever had. The chocolate molten core was a pleasant surprise in my mouth, and the olive oil ice cream was a nice compliment, as were the strawberries (one of my fav fruits). \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=9I54qy_cd5tJ_1iTJOZq7A \n\n6) Cocktails - I thoroughly enjoyed my Pamarosa - light, refreshing with a pomegranate flavor bursting through. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=FRSoGLPQI16pus03avyaSA&select=qCz6DWesIRJt-62-2wdR8Q \n\nSpruce is on the expensive side, but worth it.

Definitely was not worth the $65 we paid per person.\n\n* Service - 5 stars\n\n* Amuse-bouche - 3 stars\n(Gruyere ball)\nNice crisp, chewy & soft on the inside. A little salty.\n\n* Oxtail Ravioli - 4 stars\n(w/ foie gras, corn fondue, smip ranch harvest greens)\nVery very nice. Delicious tender meat, savory, balanced well by the wonderfully sweet corn fondue. My boyfriend doesn't eat beef and got a prosciutto version that was almost as good - 3.5 stars.\n\n* Sunchoke Soup - 4 stars\n(w/ granhy smith apple brioche)\nVery unique - smells like apple, tastes more on the savory side. It separates a little so you sip the sweeter, more watery soup first and then comes the more viscous, textured portion of the soup. A nice way to divide out the different parts. Only complaint - the brioche crumbles had already melted very quickly so it didn't add any crunch to the soup for me.\n\n* Tuna - 2 stars\n(w/ bulgar, heirloom tomatoes, cucumber, bottarga)\nThe only redeeming factor were the heirloom tomatoes, which are in season now and delicious no matter how you serve it. The tuna was overcooked on the outside and completely raw inside - I don't have an issue with raw fish, but the contrast was just to stark there. As for the other components of this dish, they really did not add any value nor flavor.\n\n*Strawberry pavlova - 1 star\n(w/ lemon curd, tarragon syrup, pistachios)\nThis was beyond horrible. I have a major sweet tooth and didn't even finish it. The pavlova had an incredibly hard shell, and if you pressed down on a piece with your fork it congealed together and became difficult to break apart. The lemon curd was too viscous and overly sweet. The strawberries, while I could tell were not frozen, definitely were not fresh. Too bad because this dessert looked awesome.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

That being said I've never actually been for brunch and have always come for dinner. So came the day that I'd try it out for brunch. \n\nLike always, service was impeccable, and the ambiance was perfect to have a nice conversation and enjoy a relaxing meal. Where Spruce loses a star for me is the food. Don't get me wrong, dinner here is absolutely superb, but their brunch needs a little work. We started with the beignets which were light, warm and fluffy. An absolute fantastic start to the meal. I also had a cup of coffee which was so so for me. It would have been nice having a French press especially when you are paying $5. Next, I had the chicken hash and added a Jidori poached egg. It was flavorful, but the helping was meager and the side biscuit was a bit too starchy and not the fluffy southern taste I was hoping for. While Spruce is known for its dinner, their brunch service could use a little work. Hopefully they can elevate their brunch service to the same caliber as its dinner.", "author": "Alex L."}

The food presentation is something to admire, the staff knowledge on food and wine are to brag about but the food is a hit or miss.

The restaurant was maybe 1/5th full. Once seated, an extremely snooty older waiter came to give us our menus and asked for our drink orders. Since we hadn't had a chance to peruse the menus, we obviously didn't know what we were going to order for drinks. He promised he would return in a few minutes.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, he came to us again. A few of us ordered tea and a few ordered various non-alcoholic beverages. He promised he would return with our drinks in just a few minutes.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nWe watched as he obsequiously seated, served and fawned over a well-dressed yuppie couple who'd arrived at least 15 min after us. We watched as he took their orders and served them their drinks without once checking in on us (mind you, this couple was seated a couple of feet diagonally across from us and there were no other occupied tables between us). We watched as he repeatedly rushed back and forth between them and a table on our other side--but never stopped to serve us.\n\nWhen he finally arrived with our drinks, my tea was lukewarm. But at that point, we were so fed up and hungry, we just wanted to place our orders and be done with it. I should note too that we were hardly under-dressed, esp for lunch. Only one of us was in jeans and a t-shirt--everyone else had on nice tops and slacks. \n\nThe food took a good 20 minutes to arrive (I repeat, the restaurant was only 1/5th full). I wish I could say it was worth the wait.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nThe much-acclaimed burger was a well-cooked slab of beef contained within a well-buttered bun. Any burger additions were $2 each. I've had a million \"gourmet\" burgers like this and there is nothing remarkable about Spruce's. The crispy duck confit salad was awful. The duck was burnt to a crisp (guys, that's not what \"crispy\" is supposed to mean), dry and impossible to cut. There was hardly any meat. The surrounding salad was fine, with a nice mix of flavors and textures, but I could pay half that price to get the exact same salad. The potato gnocchi was definitely the best dish on the table. The extra star is for that. It was soft and tasty and flavorful. Too bad the portion was so small.\n\nIt took another 15-20 min of waiting for them to clear our plates. Our waiter, who had never stopped by once to ask if we wanted refills of our beverages, came to ask us this. My friend and I both requested some more hot water for our tea. He promised us we'd get it right away and then asked us if we wanted dessert. We looked at each other and telepathically communicated \"NO\", with the mutual understanding that if we did, we'd be here another hour. So we declined and asked for the bill. Which took another 10 min.\n\nOh, and that second round of hot water didn't arrive until halfway through paying our bill. Because everyone needs to sip tea while working out the tab, not while eating their meals or something preposterous like that. Seriously, was the kitchen run by a posse of one-armed sloths or something?", "author": "Josephine L."}

The casual yet elegantly decorated interior immediately stands out and makes you feel comfortable in a place that is fine dining at it's best. The small curtains between every other table along the walls offers a feeling of seclusion that, along with the dimly lit dining room, make this a perfect place for a romantic night out or to celebrate a special occasion.\n\nThe service you will receive at Spruce is second to none. Our waiter was not only extremely knowledgeable about the menus but was very personable and friendly. He really stood out and contributed greatly to my wife's and my celebration of our second anniversary. When we arrived there was even a \"Happy Anniversary\" card sitting on the table for us.\n\nThe food......the food was fantastic! The veal sweetbreads were absolutely amazing and was the perfect savory compliment to our cocktails - truly a memorable dish. For the middle course we had the vegetarian risotto special for the evening and it was not only presented wonderfully but tasted great, and I am usually not a huge fan of risotto. For the main course I had the suckling pig and would recommend this to anyone. They utilized three separate parts of the pig to create a dish that was well put together, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. My wife had the black cod, which I tasted and liked, but it could not draw me away from my meal. She really enjoyed it.\n\nFor dessert they brought out a complimentary plate of home-made marshmallows with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. I would highly recommend Spruce as a place to celebrate a special occasion, or if you just want a fantastic meal and don't mind spending the money for it. They really go above and beyond.\n\nNext time I come in I plan to sit at the bar and try the burger that so many have raved about.", "author": "Frank J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-02", "description": "Dine About Town review!\n\nAt this moment, Spruce is the fanciest restaurant I have ever eaten in. To quote my friends, \"This feels like New York.\" Coat check, fancy plush arm chairs, and the longest waits for anything in my life.\n\nSpruce has a set DAT menu (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uXq_AWdwUIbzZlb6Z5iBvQ/l.jpg), which made our choice fairly painless. Our lunch was slightly delayed since we were waiting for our last dining partner to join us, but when she did arrive, there was still lag time for them to come take our order. I think time runs more slowly here.\n\nThe complimentary bread wasn't anything fancy. It came with both regular and honey maple butter, which weren't as whipped as Ruth Chris' butter but were still super fluffy and better in flavor. Strangely, the honey maple only tasted a tad bit sweeter than the regular. Sadly, the bread only came out once :(\n\nThe WINTER SALAD appetizer was refreshing, with beautifully stewed baby beets, slices of grapefruit, and pieces of escarole, all lightly sauced with a berry vinaigrette and laid on top of some type of raspberry reduction (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XflusFmdSg50FM8QPaxbeg/l.jpg). The light and dark beets were fantastic and paired perfectly with the grapefruit. Despite the naturally bitter characteristics of the grapefruit and the escarole, the harmonious pairing with citrus sauces worked very well.\n\nThe entree was CHICKEN CONFIT \"PICCATA\" with housemade pappardelle, lemon, and capers (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XAtiCEsjuZ7Tp0qLEK9BYQ/l.jpg). Although it's called a confit \"piccata,\" I would term it more colloquially as \"pulled chicken,\" kind of like pulled pork. The shredded chicken was well seasoned and ridiculously tender. The homemade broad flat noodles were al dente so that they did not absorb too much of the lemony soup base and held their own egg-y flavor. Aside from the chicken, the capers were my favorite component as they were stewed to reduce their sharpness yet maintain that nice crunchy spice.\n\nWith the DAT lunch, chocolate chip cookies could be added as dessert for $6. However, I take pleasure in choosing my desserts. We were brought the dessert menu (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3Ulh5Y7-3OEORdqh_95iXQ/l.jpg), and my eyes immediately zoned in on the $9 BEIGNETS with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. I have only had beignets once at a casual brunch place, and back then they were reminiscent of chewy powdered donuts. However, the beignets here are light, fluffy, and devilishly doughy with a crispy exterior covered in sugar (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4kp00jIhKP50pdQr3yU9Hw/l.jpg). This mind-blowing texture from the beignets is the perfect backdrop for the two sauces: a velvety dark chocolate and a voluptuously vanilla custard sauce. My gosh, just look at how soft and doughy they are! (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mVdbs28bnNtN8fVkOp9QQQ/l.jpg) Heavenly.\n\nFunnily, the more low-key Sociale is right across the street. Versus the uppity, high-class feel here, Sociale is more down-to-earth and intimate in setting. Yet I appreciate Spruce for the freshness of its ingredients, the well-matched flavor and texture combinations, and the perfection of food presentation.

Everyone was dressed in suits and high heels. My group of 4 came in after work with our backpacks and at first glance around, expected to be scoffed at, but to the restaurant staff's credit, were welcomed warmly. If I was to visit again, I would definitely show up with nicer attire. \n\nWe came for the burger, which is supposed to be one of the best in town. Upon sitting down, we were greeted by our waitress, Rebecca - very friendly, very warm, and very knowledgable about the restaurant's selections. \n\nWe ordered caesar salad (excellent), deviled eggs (excellent), burgers and oysters for the table. We had the option to have caviar or bacon on the deviled eggs - we opted for the bacon topping. They came out with caviar by mistake, which Rebecca quickly promised to rectify. Assuming we were getting another plate of eggs, we tried the caviar eggs anyway. Minutes later comes out a little bowl of bacon bits... were we supposed to scrape the caviar off and put the bacon bits on? Rebecca didn't seem confused by the miscommunication... we clearly were.\n\nThe Burger: Phenomenal. House-made English Muffin-esque bun, which is crunchy, fluffy, and flavorful. Cooked to perfection. I normally order medium-rare because restaurants tend to overcook. Rebecca recommended medium which came with a pink, juicy center. I ordered grilled onions on top, which were also forgotten, but quickly brought out later.

We also got the \"special\" which was the grilled rib eye steak with the bone for two.  The meat was perfectly cooked.  It was the fall-off the bone-style, best cut meat that I've had in a long time.  The only problem with ordering this rib eye steak for two is the wait.

If there were capers, they must have rinsed them in distilled water...\n\nWe should have known when the bread and butter came out.  Very little flavor and there were two butters: one normal and one of \"maple\" (beyond crazy).  Luckily they had a small cup of salt on the table (we used all of it).\n\nThe burrata with carrots was definitely the best dish, but even that lacked punch.\n\nThe tagliatelle was awful.  There's no other way to say it.  The raisin and cloves with some citrus made for a painful sweet and acidic dish.  At this point though, we just couldn't tell our nice waiter that we wouldn't be eating it (instead she picked at the rabbit and drank her wine).  The pasta itself was made in house, but both too thick and super chewy (presumably they kept cooking it hoping something would improve).\n\nI'd say the Kurobata pork was passable but overcooked.  Sadly, the sweet plus savory combo struck again (I deftly removed the berries from atop the pork loin).  The celery pur\u00e9e was reasonably tasty, so if you're okay with slightly tough pork this was a fine dish.\n\nFinally, our waiter really was quite nice and attentive.

We walked in and lemme tell you never judge a book by it's cover (just because we are minorities in the 25-30 age group doesn't mean you can look down on us). I guess Spruce is not used to this, since it is predominately white here, Alexander's is more of our scene anyways. -- Back to the hostess service, there were exactly two or three Male hostesses looking down at their little book of nonsense, not even acknowledging us at all, mostly (the guy with the slick back hair, yes, you know who you are). Finally, a female hostess came over and asked if we've been help after 10 mins of awkward staring. She sat us down next to the kitchen corner tucked away and in the walkway of the waiters so it was definitely distracting. (didn't want to say it but I'm pretty sure it was because we're minorities -- yep, throwing in the race card). \n\nAnyways, besides the terrible first impression, fortunately our waiter was sooo incredibly friendly (kudos to him!)

Ever since the first time my girlfriend took me here (which was our 2nd date together) I have fallen in love with this establishment, its environment, service, and of course the food.\n\nThe burger, charcuterie selection, and seafood entrees are always well balanced and never disappointing.\n\nTonight, I had a dinner here celebrating Mother's Day.  Surprisingly, Spruce was not packed at all.  We started off with the amazing charcuterie selection which still to this day has the best duck liver mousse I have had.  The order only is worth it even if you just eat this.\n\nThe rest of evening was filled with a 28oz bone-in ribeye, new york strip steak with bacon hushpuppies, and one of the best duck breasts I have ever had.\n\nSo why the 4 stars and not 5?  I've dined with Spruce at least 8 times but I am afraid with the service experienced in this dinner it will be the last time I dine with them.  The waiter constantly forgot items we asked for but the real finisher was when the bill came.  Now, Spruce is always fair priced for the quality of food and service they offer - mostly maxing out at $50 per an entree.  However, our server did not make us aware that the bone-in ribeye he was heavily advertising was $138.  That's right, $138 and nobody thought twice to mention that it was nearly 3x the most expensive item on the menu.  My girlfriend had also left her credit card with the staff in advance so that there would be not battling with who pays the bill at the end of the meal - but the waiter forgot and came with the bill and placed it right in front of my girlfriend's father.  Lastly, having a 28oz steak....it leaves for a lot of leftovers.  We had them pack for us our leftovers.  We got home and realized half of our leftovers were missing.  \n\nHowever, this is how awesome Spruce is.  We reached out to the general manager (Chris Tang) and he immediately wanted to give us a call.  Within 12 hours of the meal, the charge for the steak was refunded and Chris sent us a gift card to retry the experience we had last night.  I know no establishment is perfect, but Spruce time after time does not cease to impress with its pursuit to perfection.  The management here is relentless in assuring every wrong is corrected and I cannot think of another establishment that would go through the troubles of assuring their clients have a flawless experience.  One additional small detail - Chris contacted me at 9am the next morning (on Mother's Day) and even took time out during the brunch rush to have the phone call with me; it says a lot about an individual to choose to address this issue with such urgency on what probably is one of their most busiest times. \n\nThank you Spruce for the memories in the past and for the memories that are to come.", "author": "Christopher L."}

Started with some of the best scallops I've ever had (still thinking about the flavor & texture the next day), then the rib eye.  Wifer had the pork loin.

Overall, the dishes are complex, but well executed and worth the price.\n\nService/waitstaff is top-notch and professional- they don't cut corners and are very serious about the food. When they served us they treated us to full explanations of all components of our dishes and how it was prepared. \n\nThe place is big and dramatically well-lit.  Actually maybe a little too dark (a lot of older folks using their phone's glow to read menus.  \n\nFunniest/oddest part of this place: they played oldies (50s-60s) music throughout the dining room- a little out of place for what seems like an elegant atmosphere.\n\nWill return next time we're celebrating something.", "author": "John B."}

My dinner party was a bit loud and an occasional F bomb was dropped here and there. But two tables from us, a lady brought a dog INTO the restaurant - no indication that it was a service dog mind you, it was a poodle for gods sakes.\n\nMy dinner party's dining experience quickly devolved when one of the maitre d approached our table and asked us to be silent because the group two tables from us were concerned about our language. We quickly responded to maitre d, \"how about their dog in the restaurant? we are deathly allergic\" and sent him on his way.\n\nThe point of the review is this - the restaurant had a choice to handle it the right way and the wrong way. The right way was to inform the table that complained about us that my dinner party was wrapping up shortly, here's a free drink/apps on the house.  The wrong way was to determine that the group complaining (the one with the dog mind you) was deemed \"better\" than my dinner party.\n\nObviously, I won't return to this establishment.", "author": "John M."}

Spruce is a very classy, nice restaurant, one where everyone dresses up a little enjoying a lovely meal and drink.  \n\nWe started off with non-alcohol spritzer with fruit and min - very refreshing!  We also ordered the scallops with potato puree - I enjoyed this.  The Spruce hamburger definitely lived up to expectation - there must be some kind of secret to preparing it because the flavor of the meat, sauce and toppings - it's just top notch and it must be HAD!  It comes with their wonderful fries and dips.  Mmmm!  Most memorable!!  \n\nWe also topped off our meal with an order of beignets and two sauces.  We couldn't take our time to enjoy it though because I needed to catch a cab to Japantown for the SF Asian American Film Festival.  If you need a cab at Spruce, make sure you tell your server ahead of time because cabs in this area of the City are sparse. \n\nService was wonderful, attentive and personable.  I would've given Spruce 5 stars if attentiveness to getting a cab for me in time for my show was a managed a little better.  Other than that, I highly recommend Spruce for a wonderful dining experience, and the hamburger is definitely something you should not miss ordering!", "author": "Maile N."}

I came to Spruce last night to celebrate my lovely wife's birthday and suffice to say we were both really excited about eating here. I have heard so many positive things about the place that I arrived with some pretty high expectations and would have been crushed if they didn't fulfill them. But luckily for both us, our experience here was stellar, and worthy of their Michelin rating. \n\nThe ambiance here is a mix of swanky old school San Francisco with a contemporary twist. Oversized leather seats, mahogany walls, high ceilings, and dim lighting. This place exudes classiness. \n\nWe were greeted promptly and seated in an alcove in the corner of the restaurant that was just perfect for my wife and I. We felt like we were still able to enjoy the intimacy of our small table and at the same time still overlook the entire dining room. Our server, Melissa, was gracious and very personable. This being my wife's birthday, I decided to splurge and got a bottle of the Palazzo Cabernet Franc (2007) for us to share. We started with the charcuterie platter, which had a delectable assortment of cured meats and pates. It married well with the accompanying toast which was very delicious on its own. \n\nFor entrees, I got the Liberty Farms duck with shaved foie gras and my wife chose the Moraccan chicken. One bite of my duck dish and I was sent spiraling into a hallucinogenic state of euphoria and nirvana. IT WAS THAT GOOD! My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken plate as well. Moreover, the wine we chose ended up being the perfect pairing for the food, complementing each other nicely. We finished the evening of with a complementary birthday dessert for my wife and the beignets. Melissa boldly claimed that these beignets were better than the ones you can find in New Orleans. Bold, yet oh so true. They were so light and airy, I felt like I was eating little sweet, sugary clouds. And coupled with the two dipping sauces, creme anglaise or dark chocolate, this dessert was catapulted from stratosphere to out of this world!!!\n\nIn summation, our experience at Spruce was impeccable from start to finish. From the wait staff, to the food, to the small things like having a birthday card waiting for my wife and our intimate alcove table, Spruce surely did not disappoint!", "author": "Derrek O."}

The service we received while simply having drinks was so friendly and amazing (they sent us on our way with free cookies) that I only assumed a full meal would be more of the same.  Sadly, our experience was lacking.   \n\nIt was nothing major - just little things missing that I would expect from a restaurant with such a legendary reputation for great service.  For example, awkwardly standing around the hostess when she said our table would only be a moment - but then disappearing and that moment turning into 10 minutes.  Or our waiter bringing drinks, us indicating we're ready to order, but the waiter telling us he'll be right back...and then not reappearing until a short time later.  Or at the end of our experience, where the hostess was again no where to be found and we fished our coats of the coat closet ourselves.  Not hard to do...again, just awkward for a restaurant that wishes to give the impression that they are high end and ultra catering to your needs.    \n\nI will say our food was a bit amazing, a bit mediocre, depending on the dish.

There was clearly either a back up in the kitchen or something of that nature as it seemed like it took for ever for anything to get out of the kitchen.\n\nWe got out appetizers and my husband ordered the special which was a gnocchi with shaved white truffle.  The rest of us has soup or salad.  They bring out everything and he is sitting there waiting for a good 10 minutes for them to come over with the truffle.  He finally gets it and eats his 5 gnocchis.  Our plates are cleared and then over 40 minutes later we get our entrees.  We asked the server who said that they \"[were] being plated right away\" and then 15 minutes later ask again and are told another 30 seconds.  About 5 minutes after that everything arrived.  Most of my family loved their food but my pasta tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.\n\nThe true kicker was that my parents had brought a cake for our table in advance (We were celebrating that me and my husband had just gotten married) and after their cleared our entree plates it took about 20 minutes to bring the cake, then they took it and about 15 minutes to cut it.  10 minutes after we got the cake we got the coffee.\n\nThis was not just our table as it seemed like there was very little food coming from the kitchen that night and there were a lot of servers going back an forth with nothing in their hands.

We had a reservation and were seated immediately at a table near the middle of the restaurant, with a view of the bar on the other side. The ambiance in the restaurant was classy, but not too pretentious. I liked that every table had their own little candle.\n\nThe meal started out great with our waiter bringing us a generous helping of wine for each of us, and then bringing us a choice of breads (we picked all of them, but the French baguette was the best) and some cheese puffs that were delicious. I really liked the presentation -- they provided a lot of cutlery (more than was necessary really, but hey I'm not complaining).\n\nAs for the food, we got the grilled octopus as the appetizer, and then the filet mignon and the cod as our mains. All 3 were amazing, but I'd call out the octopus as being the best octopus I'd ever had -- truly delicious seasoning on it. The medium rare steak I got was also very tasty, but what really took the cake was the cheesy \"bread pudding\" that came with it (don't be fooled by the name, it was savory) -- so good. It came with a foie-gras sauce that added a buttery taste to each part of my meal, which was a great addition. My girlfriend's cod was pan-fried very nicely and I enjoyed the few bites she shared with me.\n\nAfter our meal, our waiter recommended the chocolate mousse cake so we ordered that along with some coffee. The coffee was surprisingly delicious given it was decaf, and the cake was very flavorful and came with a fruity sauce and banana ice cream. Great combination overall.\n\nThe service was impeccable -- the wait staff was always there when we needed them, but never bothered us unnecessarily. They also had a good sense of humor, something I appreciate at \"fancy\" places like this.\n\nOverall I had a great time here and would love to come back for dinner or to check out the attached bar since I'm sure their bar fare would be pretty delicious too.", "author": "Alexander P."}

After going back and forth, we decided on Spruce, a fantastic decision on our part.  \n\nWe arrived and were seated after the hostess took our coats.  Our server, Simone, came by soon to greet us.  The bread came and I loved it.  I chose the cranberry bread while my friend had the brioche.  Also loved the butters with their individual covers.  Later I stole a piece of the brioche just to try the olive butter.  Yum.\n\nFor starters, we had the fries with remoulade and the beef tongue.  The beef tongue came with mustard, chutney, cornichons, a bit of greens and lots of toast.  I find it rare to get enough toast/bread when ordering pates or charcuterie so this was a welcome surprise.  Both dishes were delicious. \n\nFor the meal, I chose the Dine About Town menu with the wine pairing.  The first course was a parsnip and pear veloute.  Very refreshing especially with the reisling it was paired with.  I'm not usually a white wine fan but it was crisp, cold, and utterly delicious.\n\nMy second course was a braised oxtail with herb spatzle and market vegetables.  It was heaven on a plate.  The flavors worked wonderfully together and it paired beautifully with a bordeaux.  My friend decided to order off the regular menu and had the short rib sugo with red wine farotto, brussels sprouts and carrots. I had a bite and it was another winner.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the beignets with cr\u00e8me anglaise and chocolate sauce.  There is nothing like warm fried goodness dipped in a custard.  The only problem I had was with the coffee.  There were too many choices and I chose wrong.  Oh well.\n\nAnd I can't say enough about the excellent service.   When I accidentally used the wrong knife for butter, Simone quickly and discreetly replaced it.  Everything was  beautifully presented.  The restaurant is classy and elegant with modern touches.  My seat faced the bar and I couldn't believe the amazing selection on the shelves. \n\nThis lunch was definitely a treat that I hope can happen again....soon.", "author": "J. P."}

The meal I had here last night was stellar, amazing, remarkable in every possible way.  \n\nThe space itself is sexy. Dark lighting and attention to detail had me admiring features like the ski light, that allowed for just the right amount of natural light in the room, and the thin glass pane separating the bar and main dining room, which was not only beautiful to look at but a nice sound barrier as well. I was obsessed with the chairs. Not only comfortable, they look like ostrich (don't worry they are just leather) and are studded with beautiful handles. I want these in my home. Seriously I do. \n\nSo onto the food. I have to say that reading other reviews gave me very little insight into what I would be getting here. All people talk about is the foie gras and the burger, both which I am sure are excellent, but neither of which I tried. We decided to do a tasting of sorts and ordered several different things off the menu, as so many of the dishes sounded too good to pass up. \n\nI am not usually one to list every dish I had, but in this case, I feel I should as they were all SO incredible. We started with the fisherman's mussels wither pernod and crostini. A classic Spruce dish, I couldn't help but eat the broth with my spoon, and the mussels themselves were at the peak of freshness. Market cherries with burrata, pine nuts and pine nut biscotti was another winner. I want to try to make this at home. Perfect ingredients that worked magic together. \n\nOur next course was the sheepsmilk ricotta ravioli.  Ohh if I could bathe in this pasta I think I just might... Topped with sweet peas, pancetta, some sort of brothy foam and freshly shaved parmesan, this is one of those dishes that I could not stop eating. Another one that I want to try to recreate at home. \n\nFor the entree I had the wild king salmon sherry braised morels. It was excellently cooked - medium rare, but warm throughout with a heavenly, creamy sweet corn fondue. The fondue was so rich and amazing I had to ask for an extra side of it. They brought a huge side out within moments and I ate it all! \n\nI Love Love dessert. We had the warm bing cherries, as we were still reminiscing over the cherries with burrata, and also tried the almond financier and two scoops of ice cream: sour cream strawberry and chocolate malt. The stars of the dessert were the ice creams. I kind of wanted to lick the bowl, but I'm no longer a toddler and people don't seem to think a woman of my age should be licking plates in public. The cherries were great too, but I didn't for the financier. It was a little dense and a little bland.  \n\nI must comment on the exquisite service we received. Chris (one of the som's) was so brilliant and knowledgeable. It was as if we were receiving a lesson on all the wines we tried! Our glasses were never empty and there was never too much time in between courses. \n\nI would consider myself lucky to be able to dine at Spruce again.", "author": "Brittany F."}

Yes I've given it 5 stars for quality of everything.  \n\nBut this needs to be said, if a date brought me here... I'd have second thoughts about the guy. The way this restaurant was dimly lit to start and how they dim it more throughout the night, hints to the fact that this is the kind of place a man brings his mistress. \n\nFor a brief minute I wanted to give the cliental the benefit of the doubt, but when I go to the bathroom I see two couples where the man is over 50 making out in the corners. Gross nasty, I probably didn't need to squint my way through the darkness to see that.\n\nFor food we all ended up ordering different dishes and sharing bits and pieces:\n\nFor apps\n- The corn soup was amaze balls\n- Never can go wrong with a meat platter\n- You can choose from wheat, white or cranberry bread - I chose cranberry and was very happy with the texture and taste. It almost had the consistency of cake and had this wonderful sweetness that meant I could eat it without butter. \n\nFor dins\n- The duck was not bad\n- The pork tenderloin served with duck fat had me regretting that I ordered the lobster. \n- Maine lobster was spectacular\n- Steak was noms medium rare perfection\n\nFor dessert\n- Banana split was ridiculously generous in portion, flavors were really good in it\n- The turnip cake dish was just so so, while the cake itself was great the other flavors on the plate didn't homogenize so well together. \n\nNice touches\n- On entry they gave the bday girl a birthday card\n- Happy birthday dessert\n- Sommelier suggested reasonable wine and champers that were delish. Loved how he asked price range by either mortgage payment pricing or rent payment, and Nick replied mortgage in Michigan prices would work.\n\nOverall this place was great, I am still have indecent thoughts about the pork loin dish and how well it was prepared.

In short, we were totally underwhelmed.  Maybe it's because there are way better options in the city for a fraction of the price?  \n\nWe started with drinks from the bar; a Remember the Maine for my husband and Smoke and Fire for me.  They were both good drinks, although the chili garnish sitting on the rim of my drink made my mouth burn for the duration of my meal and I hadn't even touched it.\n\nFor appetizers we tried the Gazpacho and the Chino Valley Egg Ravioli.  The Gazpacho was pretty blah--something I feel like I could have whipped up in my food processor, but the ravioli was good.  The egg was our favorite part.\n\nWe ordered wine--Pinot from the Willamette Valley and the Seghesio Zin. Both were good and probably the highlight of the meal.  \n\nFor our main course, my husband had the duck and I had the sea bass.  The duck was chewy, and not as melt-in-your-mouth as we had expected (since we've had some pretty good duck in the city).  The sea bass had a good crust, but was tough and I had to continuously douse it in the brown butter to get any flavor.  \n\nWhen we received the check, there was a $17 charge for still water.  This is not France, Spruce, sorry.  \n\nI'm guessing I've become a bit of a SF snob when it comes to food and certainly living in the Mission has completely spoiled me, but it just seems that when you're paying that sort of money to go out to eat, you expect some really great food.

I could eat these nonstop. \n\nI couldn't help myself and I had to order an additional item from their menu. I saw foie gras and my eyes lit up. It was hands down the BEST FOIE GRAS preparation I've ever had! It was seared foie gras with waffles, pistachio and pear jelly. Awesome waffle. Different from your typical breakfast waffle. Everything together was perfect. \n\nThe next best thing I had there was the oxtail ravioli with foie gras shavings. I just wish there was more on the plate! I practically licked up the whole plate. The cold shavings of foie gras gave the ravioli a buttery texture and taste. Yummy!\n\nThe disappointment of the night was the seared yellowtail with bottarga couscous. The yellowtail wasn't as buttery as I'm used to. The bottarga couscous just wasn't my thing. It was too salty and had this odd taste. \n\nThe dessert consisted of something like a hard meringue with strawberries. The flavor was nice, but the texture was crumbly yet chewy at the same time. The texture made it hard to eat. \n\nDespite the disappointment, this place gets five stars because the amazing foie gras and ravioli! I have to come back here before the foie gras ban! I also noticed that many people came in to eat their burger. I'll definitely try that next time I'm in. Maybe I'll add some foie gras to it to take it to the next level. =P", "author": "Daisy T."}

It was a smooth, creamy cold soup with a pear base. Tiny microgreens floating on top for a beautiful start to a wonderful meal.\n\nBraised Oxtail with Spatzle - normally I'm not a fan of spatzle but the Oxtail more than made up for it. Incredibly tender, the shredded oxtail was piping hot, savory and just the right portion.\n\nSpruce Burger - $16\nThe hype around this burger is sadly it's downfall. The buns are too buttery (tastes like a borderline Cinnabon). Pickles and pickled red onions are \"too gourmet\" for me, if that even makes sense.

Cooked medium rare, it was a very solid meal dish. \n-The pecan tart was a surprise hit for me. The chicory icecream and the pecan tart itself was amazing. I'm not even a pecan tart fan but I'd come back just to order this dessert dish again.\n\nAll in all, very solid meal and it met my expectations (which were high). I wouldn't say that it was mind blowing or anything but it definitely didn't disappoint.\n\nLogistics:\n-They offer $12 valet parking but there's plenty of street parking, if you can find it.

Finally I get to knock this one off and get to say, \"I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE!!\" \n\nI'm starting to feel a sense of accomplishment when finding these neighborhood restaurants, it gets better and better each and every time. =) Let me start off by saying that I love restaurants that have a lounge/bar waiting area (they have a FULL BAR), beats standing by and being hit by the front door. Came on a Tuesday evening and to my surprise, there was actually a good amount of people inside (weekday evenings at most restaurants= ghost town). The wait wasn't bad at all, 5 minutes give or take. \n\nOur waiter was super friendly: he greeted us after we were seated, helped us with choosing wine (because the Lord knows that I am wine retarded and I'm always impressed when I get good wine recommendations) and attentive. =) \n\nOkay, hungers time! Before our entree there were little dishes that came out, if I remember correctly there were 3. One was the Amuse Bouche Cheese Puffs: really good, slightly crisp on the outside and soft and cheesy on the inside. The other: head cheese, a slice of what I believe is a toasted baguette. Unfortunately I cannot remember what was on top of that baguette *KICKS SELF IN SHIN*!! Last one came out right before my entree *KICKS SELF IN OTHER SHIN* was a cup of soup and if you haven't guessed by now, I forgot what kind of soup it was!! \n\nOkay, now with two bruised shins...it's entree time (I promise, I remember what was on my plate)! I had the Honey Lacquered Duck Breast w/ foie gras & rhubarb, SO good. The duck breast was very tender and the SKIN was crispy (I love anything with crispy skin-- don't turn that into something sick!!!). The foie gras was crispy on the outside (AGAIN, SO good), love foie gras with a little crunch to it. \n\nOMG HOW DID I FORGET? The fries served w/ remoulade (a side that can be ordered during lunch and dinner). Is a must order type dish, you CAN'T go wrong with crunchy fries that have been fried in duck fat! \n\n\"There's ALWAYS room for dessert,\" a motto I live by. For dessert: beignets service w/ dark chocolate and vanilla sauce, sugar infested and ever so decadent. Secondly, sorbet: beet and blood orange, passion fruit and guava w/ a small cone sitting on top. The beet and blood orange was interesting, wasn't sure what to make of it but the other flavors were really good and can't go wrong with. Lastly: Passion Fruit gelees and marshmallows garnished with shredded coconut, at this point my stomach had reached it's limit and I could only shove marshmallow down the hatch. -_-\"\n\nOverall the food was probably the best I've have in a long while and the service, A+++++.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-06-15", "description": "I was really excited to give Spruce 5 stars but unfortunately I don't think I'm going to be able to. In fact, I was so excited, I came alone on a Friday night so I'd be seated quicker at the bar. In short, I ended up waiting 45 minutes for my bar slot but once I sat down the bartender said, \"You have arrived...\". I thought this was cute, a bit creepy, but cute none the less.\n\nI glanced over the menu briefly but already knew what I wanted: the Spruce burger. Everyone on Yelp raves about the delicious mouth watering patty so I knew I had no choice but to try it myself. I also ordered the \"Pharaoh's Gold\" drink, too (because it was Friday night and why not?).\n\nFirst, the drink. I must say, Spruce knows how to craft a drink. Apparently the concoction I was drinking was an ode to the ancient Egypt exhibit at one of the museums in the city. I thought it was a stretch but it still tasted good. I also got a scoop of honeycomb in my drink; how cool is that?!\n\nWhen my burger arrived I was impressed with the portion but was incredibly apprehensive. Even in the dim lighting of Spruce I could see the grease glisten and twinkle on my plate. I knew this was going to be a messy meal but still I continued onward. \n\nI'm not sure I like having an english muffin as the buns for the burger; I can't say that added anything extra to the burger except more density and thickness. Every bite I took of the burger more and more grease slipped from the bun and at one point I actually dropped the burger on my plate. The taste of grease was evident but not overpowering.\n\nHowever, the major downfall of the meal came with the french fries. I understand french fries need to be deep fried but this was an abomination. The fries were deep coated in soy bean oil and could literally be rung out. I had to squeeze each fry before I could put the potato lump in my mouth as oil literally oozed out of each pore. To prove my point, I dumped out the container that held my fries and watched the landslide of oil pour all over my plate. I could not finish my small portion of fries (and believe me, that says something!). \n\nThe bartender gave me my check, two tiny pieces of chocolate (for free!), and I was on my way. I promptly went to bed when I got home (as it was late) but was awoken at 3am with terrible stomach pains. I thought I would have to call my doctor because the pains were incredibly unbearable. My discomfort prevented me from sleeping the rest of the night thru. I have not a single doubt in my mind the over use of oil and grease served at Spruce threw me for a loop.\n\nI would give Spruce 1 star (for being increibly inflated and overrated) but the drinks are always fantastic and the waitstaff are exceptionally professional; I just wish the burger and fries didn't take a bath in oil before being served.", "author": "Tommy C."}

Atmosphere was fine - but at the end of the day you are there for the food.    The mushroom soup was very good - but not original in anyway.   The burrata was fine but again lacking in interest and seasoning.   The spaghetti Con Le Noci was bland - we had much better pasta at Barzotta.

But this trip, I was very disappointed in the service.  First, the server brought me the wrong appetizer, not what I ordered.  I thought maybe I had made the mistake, so didn't say anything.  But while enjoying the admittedly very good soup, my dining partner said to me, \"wait, didn't you order the salad?\".   So my memory was not so shaky after all.  It was their mistake, not mine.\n\nSecond, the entire point of the lunch there was to take a friend out for his birthday.  I wrote the restaurant a note on OpenTable in advance when I made the reservation to let them know of the birthday, and asked if they could do something special.  I never heard back from them.  So when the restaurant phoned me the day before to confirm the reservation, I also explained to the person to whom I spoke that I was there to celebrate a birthday, and asked if they could arrange something special.  She told me that on our dessert, the kitchen would write \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate, and I thought she said would bring it out along with a candle.  So I asked her to make a note to be sure they did so.  Greeted at the door, I was sure to give the host my name so they could see the instructions with my reservation.  But still, they did nothing when the dessert plate came out.  Apparently writing a note as well as phoning them in advance did no good.  Management needs to work on this to be sure it doesn't happen to others.\n\nThird, we arrived well ahead of our reservation time.  So we sat at the bar and had a drink.  When it was time to move to our table the bartender said he would move the tab for our drinks over to the bill for our table.  I gave him my name so he could match it with the reservation.  When the bill finally came, the drinks were not on the tab.  I tried to flag our server to let her know, but she was no where to be found ... for quite a long time.  At this point, perturbed about the flub with the dessert, and the lack of attention, I could have said nothing.  But wanting to be honest about my bill, I brought it to the attention of one of the other servers who happened to walk by our table.  There were very thankful that I brought it up.  But really, given the prior errors, one wonders what is going on, why management is not doing a better job to be sure mistakes like this do not happen.", "author": "Chris A."}

It was one of the various 'best' decisions I made for our wedding event and it will forever be a wonderful memory for us.\n\nLet me start by saying that Spruce would have had a 5 star rating from me, had it not been the first impression I had from the host who answered the reservation line. It stuck with me Spruce, and he acted like I was born yesterday for asking if I could come in and taste the foods I was considering for my wedding. Megan did do her best in making up for this, and we very much appreciated it.\n\nThere isn't really anything I can add that hasn't said before: the restaurant is beautiful, the food is incredible, and service was A+++ So, I'll focus more on our private dining experience in the hopes of it helping other large parties looking for something special. \n\nWe decided on the 'laurel' room, which seats approximate 50 (maybe less) people. The one disappointing factor of having up to 50 people in this room is that you don't get the gorgeous Ostrich leather chairs the main dining rooms boasts. Was disappointed but should note that Megan did explain this to me, I just glossed over it. Oh well.\n\nThe other fabulous part about Spruce is that they let you decorate the room exactly as you please, and Megan and her team will set it up FOR YOU. This includes tables, floral arrangements, wedding favors (we had two), and our cake was at no extra charge because we had a croquembouche (see photos), so no slicing needed. I think it was a hefty $5/slice charge otherwise. They added candles everywhere, had awesome tunes going all night in our room, and the service treated me like it was my night and I was princess of SF. Did I mention the food was incredible?\n\nTo say that my in-laws (from France) were impressed is a gross understatement. They are still telling the rest of the extended family about the wine (we chose mainly French), food, and ambiance. It was unlike anything they had every experienced back at home.\n\nFor us, it was the most appropriate place to celebrate our love for each other and our love for food.

Sitting in the library w/ fireplace was living-room-comfy.  And though i cant break the bank to eat here often, i will make it a point to come back very soon.", "author": "Juv C."}

After a bit of confusion with the waitress asking us what kind of water we wanted (the way she asked it dumbfounded us), we settled into the groove of the place.  The waitstaff was great and well-organized so we had everything we needed when we needed it.  \n\nWe started with the corn soup and scallops.  As we wanted to share, they coursed it for us, which was nice.  The corn soup was fantastic - my wife wouldn't let me lick the bowl, though i tried.  The scallops were different than i expected, but great.  The surprise on those was the pureed eggplant, which gave the dish a deep smoky flavor.\n\nFor the mains, my wife had the wild salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but the stars of the dish were the broccoli and mushrooms.  They were a perfect addition.  I had the pork tenderloin with wheatberries and fresh peaches and squash.  It was amazing (apparently that's a popular dish there).\n\nThe favorite dish of the night (and that's saying something) was the peach cobbler, which came with sweet corn ice cream and a basil cream.  Absolutely amazing - my wife called it \"a work of art\" and she was right.\n\nHaving grown up in the Bay Area, but not spent time in the Pacific Heights area, I was surprised by how calm and nice that section of the city was.

They were offering a 4 course prix fixe menu... Oyster on the half shell and Snapper were the first two starters, both delicious! Next was a smoked turnip soup with some sort of amazing cream and caviar on top. For the main course, I chose the butter poached Maine lobster which came served over a bed of white beans. The lobster was wonder, although the bean medley I wasn't crazy about. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib which came with a foie  gras tart. This was the best cut of prime rib I've ever seen, and it melted in your mouth! It was a first time trying foie gras, and it was pretty tasty, although I probably wouldn't order it again simply based of the fact that our server told us HOW it was made (poor ducks )   Dessert was an amazing chocolate and caramel mouse. It came with banana ice cream which was an interesting change. All in all, this place was excellent. Our server, Chris, was attentive, friendly, and super knowledgable about all the food.

With a caliber of 4 stars, I had high expectations but I was soon let down by the poor service.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant was the espresso colored wooden walls and the low lighting.  Normally I would favor the contemporary dark d\u00e9cor, but the excessive darkness did not elicit a romantic feel in me.  \n\nWe were put in a cramped corner table where the servers would walk in and out to get to the dessert prep area. The table was super cramped.  Anyone who has met me knows that my 95lb frame doesn't take up a lot of space. So imagine how tight the space was when we had to push the table away so I can sit comfortably.  \n\nFurthermore, we found out the light bulb on the ceiling directly above our table was burned out.  It was so dark we couldn't even read the menu.  And you know what their solution was, 2 tea light candles and a itty-bitty key chain flashlight.  Yeah!\n\nWhat a joke!!!!  I have never been to an upscale restaurant where I needed a flashlight to view the menu.  \n\nLet me tell you I wasn't as irked at this point.  I actually tried using the itty-bitty flashlight that the waiter gave me but the darn thing was casting a shadow ring on the menu. No matter how we tilted the flashlight, I still couldn't see the menu with my 20/20 vision.  \n\nKnowing that we had trouble with the flashlight, you would think the host/hostess would move us to another table.  OH NO!!!  He gave me another key chain flashlight, only this one has Spruce written on it.  Now why would they have these mini flashlights handy in their pockets??? My thought is that we were not the first people that they've shoved to the same dark & cramped corner table.\n\nWhat really ticked me off was the fact that not a single staff, who was aware of the lighting fiasco, bothered to apologize to us.\n\nDid they think we were going to eat our dinner in darkness?  So I asked for 6 more candles to lighten up our table.  After 30 minutes of frustration, the waiter finally moved us to another table with a working light bulb.\n\nNow let's talk about the food:\n*Cheese Puff - tasty & it was on the house (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Charcuterie selection - a mouth-watering surprise (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Grilled Bavette Steak with duck fat fries - steak was well seasoned and cooked to a medium rare perfection but the fries were greasy (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Seared Dayboat Scallops - good but nothing memorable.  \n*Banana Mousse Cake with Lime Sorbet - super rich, the sorbet cut down the richness.  (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n* Preserved & Seared Foie Gras - preserved foie gras is like pate with a buttery texture (http://www.yelp.com/bi...)\n*Seared Foie Gras - the biggest disappointment.  The pineapple juice did not compliment the 2 oz of delicacy.  I've had much better Foie Gras at Gary Danko and La Folie.\n\nThe food wasn't bad but that's no excuse for poor service.  \n\nMy advice to Spruce:  get rid of your corner table. The cramped space is not fit for any normal human being to dine in.  And please provide more lighting or candles.  I'm sure people want to see what they put in their mouth.  \n\nMy suggestion to anyone who wants to dine here: Don't do it.  Take your hard earned money and spend it elsewhere.  There are plenty of other restaurants in SF that have the same caliber but will provide you with a well deserving meal.  \n\nAnd if you insisted on coming here with just the 2 of you, be warned - there's a great chance you'll be seated at the same dark cramped corner table like me.", "author": "Hannah C."}

Said friend is also a foodie so we always pick a really nice place to go for dinner when he's in town. Spruce didn't disappoint!\n\nDrinks to start: I had a Smoke & Fire (Yamazaki whisky with smoked tea liqueur and birds-eye chili) which was fantastic. I want to learn how to make it. Smoky and smooth with just the right balance of sweet and spicy. My partner had something with vanilla bourbon and pear, and our friend had the Pamarosa (rose, pomegranate, champagne). The bartender's skills certainly stand up to those in the kitchen.\n\nOn to appetizers. We shared. Winter harvest salad, which came with a romesco sauce, hazelnuts, and pecorino, was fresh and flavorful. Foie gras (served two ways: seared and as small spheres of p\u00e2t\u00e9) with a vadouvan waffle, pear jelly, and pistachio: OMG. I want this all the time. The spiced waffle was crispy and paired so well with the pear and the foie, and the foie gras itself was so unbelievably rich. I am so sad that California has banned this treat and it will be gone in a few short months. Crispy sweetbreads with coddled egg, quince, fris\u00e9e, and bacon lardons: amazingly, better than the foie gras, which I'd had my eye set on since I checked the menu before making the reservation last month. The combination of rich meat and egg yolk (oh, and with black truffle) was phenomenal.\n\nMains:\n\nI had the slow-roasted beef short rib with red wine sauce, farotto, chard, carrots, and a horseradish velout\u00e9. The meat fell apart with just the fork, and the sauce and accompaniments were packed with flavor. Fantastic. Probably one of the best dishes on the menu. I wanted to lick the plate. My fianc\u00e9 had the grilled steak with duck fat potatoes and mushrooms. Cooked just right, and who can argue with duck fat potatoes? We were already stuffed, but went on to dessert anyway, because who could resist?\n\nDessert:\n\nMeyer lemon curd cake was tangy and creamy and so delicious. Coconut rice pudding with passionfruit sorbet and basil oil(!) was unexpected and delightful. But the star of this course was the warm apple pie with stout caramel sauce and _white cheddar_ ice cream. I've become more open to savory ice creams and this one was stellar. Great combination with the apples.\n\nComplimentary macarons (green tea, hazelnut, and chocolate) were tiny delights.\n\nWine:\n\nThe sommelier was friendly and helpful and helped pick out a great Napa red to go with our meal. No complaints.\n\nService:\n\nAgain, no complaints. It's understood that at this sort of establishment the service is impeccable, and Spruce delivered.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with Spruce. I like in particular that they're quite easygoing about ordering, so you can share appetizers and do things that would be unconventional at more old-world-style establishments. Saves a bit on the budget and saves a lot on the waistline, while still letting you and your companions try lots of different flavors. If you have a special night coming up, give Spruce a try.", "author": "Sam K."}

I ordered it medium rare and the beef patty was so delicious and full of juices. The carnivore inside me was chuckling with glee. They leave all the other ingredients on the side so you can choose what to include in your burger as you please--lettuce, tomato, choice of cheese, onion. I put everything on mine.\nThe fries that come on the side are unimpressive. For a top quality place like Spruce I would have expected even the fries to be impeccable.\n\nService was really good until the end, when we had to wait for a long time to get our dessert and bill. They did get very busy so that probably explains it, but my sister and I were in a rush to get back to the office seeing as we had taken 2 hour lunches...shh. Still, our waiter was very nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-09", "description": "With the caveat in mind that a michellin star restaurant sometimes has unreasonable expectations to live up to and likely very overworked chefs , I have to say that there were unfotunately a few things to be disappointed about at that price point. I went there with my parents and wife for a little family fine dining, and we were very pleased with the setting, music, fairly attentive staff, and special attention to dietary needs. However,  when it came to the most important detail, the food, that's where there were some issues. \n\nFirstly, the tomato soup had a tomato chunk in it that was flooded in vinegar, and gave an already overly acidic soup a pungent and overwhelming sting to it that made the rest of the soup less pleasureful.  The quality of the tomatoes that went into the soup were however notably more delicious than you might even find at one of the better SF farmers markets.  \n\nBut what really cost the restaurant two stars in my opinion was their chicken entree.  Both my mother and I had cut into chicken that was uncooked in some parts, and having to est around pieces of food on your plate is always something I found ruins the appetite.  The rest of our party also tasted the chicken and felt it's consistency was gooey, rubbery at best.  With another caveat that often fine dining establishments try hard not to overcook items, I would have been much happier with my wife's baked chicken that comes out much more flavorful and well cooked (even beautifully crispy skin instead of that slimey nonesense).\n\nI did have the opportunity to taste some of the other items at the table and the steak was marvelous as well as all of the deserts.  The only other point of advice I would add is to for gluten free patrons to provide more options for appetizer, breads and deserts.", "author": "Andrei G."}

So we had to try it out ourselves.\n\nThe decor?\nTo the left of the restaurant is an actual sit down, classy dining area with waiter service.  This part, from what I hear, is booked for weeks.  In the middle of the restaurant is a glass wall/divider to divide the sit down from the bar side.  To the right of the restaurant is the bar.  The entire wall is stocked full of wines and liquor.  The restaurant itself is a little on the dim side but still ok.  On the bar side of the restaurant, there's obviously bar seating as well as about 4 sit down tables for diners.  If you want to order the burger, sit at the bar because it is on the bar menu and not on the regular menu.\n\nParking?\nThere is ample parking in the neighborhood.  It is in pac heights so there should be plenty of street parking.\n\nThe wait?\nWe got there around 5:30ish since it's about 2 blocks from my work and there was no wait.  I hear the bar does get packed after 6ish, when people slowly start getting off work, so I recommend coming here early for no wait.  \n\nThe service?  \nThe bartenders were very attentive.  These guys actually take a muddler and smash ice cubes in the cup to crush it.  They are very knowledgeable about their alcohol.  After you order your food, they place a black table napkin on the bar as your place mat.  They then give you your utensils, water, and actual napkin.  \n\nThe food?\nFor starters, we ordered 2 cocktails.  Rob got the Whiskey mashup which is basically like a mint julep with whiskey.  I decided to test out their whiskey sour.  The bartender warned me that their whiskey sour was more on the sour side.  I thought, \"i like sour, what the hell.\"  Well he wasn't lying.  It was basically lemon juice with whiskey and a teaspoon of sugar.  They should've used simple syrup and a whole lotta it.  Props that they do use fresh squeezed lemon juice though.  If you're a wine lover, come here.  They have an entire leather menu/binder, that's about an inch thick, filled with wine choices.  It's like a scrapbook of wine!\n\nThen came the amuse bouche.  It was a very warm cheese puff that tasted JUST LIKE A CHEEZIT.  But the texture was something else.  Bite into it for a very little crackle crunch, then you feel the airiness of the inside.  It was amazing.  I could pop about 10 of those if they let me.  \n\nNow the burger, oh the burger is just amazing!  I love the fact that the bread is a large English Muffin bun made in house.  They serve the burger with a side of herbed aioli sauce, 2 pieces of romaine lettuce, very very thinly sliced pickled cucumber (almost like ribbon), pickled onions and 2 slices of Roma tomato.  The meat was cooked PERFECTLY.  We asked for medium rare and I believe that's the first time I've ever had a true medium rare burger.  Every bite I took, I'd have a bit of meat juice running down my fingers.  Also served with the burger is twice fried fries cooked in duck fat.  Bomb.  All that for $14.  I'd say that's a great deal for a perfectly cooked gourmet burger and fries fried in duck fat.  I only wish that my tummy was bigger so I could actually finish my entire burger and fries.  I surrendered a quarter of the burger to the BF.  Next time =).  \n\nI highly recommend this place.

Also split the Caesar salad, which was properly crunchy (although a tad soggy by the time I got some, but that might have been because I changed my mind on splitting the dish). We were not brought additional plates and used the bread plates for the appetizers.\n\nFood came out in decent time: a couple of French omletes, the burger, the rib eye steak, and the salmon benedict. Everybody seemed mostly happy with their dishes: my omlete seemed good without being overwhelmed by the broth or cheese. The greens seemed rather chewy though. One person complained that the burger (medium) was perhaps a little too well-done. But most of the dishes were completely finished or only had a little to take home (but we were all hungry).\n\nCoffees and teas were ordered. Coffees came out first, both the decaf and regular were praised as great. Teas took forever: according to our server the person had some sort of accident. All of the drinks (coffee and tea) are apparently brewed one at at time, which is why it took so long (Do they only have like one pot per drink or something??). I enjoyed the chamomile, but the oolong and green (forgot what was ordered) got so-so reviews.\n\nWe got our check, our server thanked us for coming. I don't know his name, but he seemed quite knowledgeable about the foods and drinks. He apologized for the wait (either he has GREAT hearing or the other staff do a really good job on keeping on top of things) for our drinks and made sure one of our party knew of some particular perks since she had been there before. \n\nBathroom was clean and had plenty of toilet seat covers, toilet paper, towels, etc. Kinda small though so if you're in a private event or it's a crowded night be aware of that.\n\nWhy the one star? Honestly, this place strikes me as a date or business lunch/dinner. I enjoyed the food (probably because I didn't pay) but can't see myself really ever coming here unless someone really wants something on the menu: there's nothing that screams \"I MUST COME BACK!\" The food isn't particularly spectacular.\n\nWhat really seals the one star: a few hours after returning, my stomach made it clear it didn't like what it ate. As I did not touch any food items with my hands, managed to get to dishes before others double dipped, etc., something was undercooked, not totally washed, not good. A fluke? Maybe. Maybe I chose the wrong item. But this was a bad first impression and I wouldn't recommend it.", "author": "AccioSoyMilk .."}

It's the type of place that's fancy enough, pricey, and out of the way that you don't just drop in on a whim. I needed the right occasion, the right mood, and the right person to go with.\n\nAs luck would have it, a recent trip to Nopa rekindled my interest in burgers and Spruce is supposed to have a pretty good one. That's how I found myself in front of this beautiful restaurant on Saturday night.\n\nWhen you walk in, the first impression is wow. From the neighborhood surrounding it, you would never think a place like Spruce would exist. But the high arching doorway, the dark wood panel walls that stretch upwards, the gorgeous bar... this place was quite the sophisticated hidden gem.\n\nWe were given a table tucked away in a dark corner. The seats were perpendicular to each other. This could be good or bad depending on your company. Luckily for me, this was perfect.\n\nBefore I dive into the food, I want to say the Old Fashioned I ordered was fantastic. Quite possibly one of the best I've had. Props to you bartender.\n\nThe scallops we started with were cooked to perfection. Not much else to say there. Sometimes the best chefs just let their ingredients do the talking.\n\nThe duck was also good, but lacked a bit in that something special. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious but I suppose the reviews let me to think it would be magic in my mouth. I suppose I could also say that about the burger. Pretty good, very juicy, way too medium when I ordered it med rare, but still a solid offering. At this point, it doesn't make my top 3 in SF, but I'm fair and I'll have to give it another go.\n\nThe service was spectacular. Our server recognized that we'd be share the dishes without me having to say a thing and went ahead to split everything for us. Service and ambiance 5, food 4.

I had been wanting to go to Spruce for a long time, since i heard so many good things about it. It was kind of hard to make reservation for a good dinner time on weekends. \n\nWe managed to make a reservation for an early dinner on a Saturday. I was excited. \n\nThe waitress helped us pick out some really good wine. We were happy with the choices. \n\nThey were giving us some complimentary cheese bread before the appetizer. They were fluffy, light, and rich in cheese flavor. They were delicious. I wish I could have more. :)\n\nEach one of us order an appetizer. We were especially thrilled about the carrot soup and the scallop dish. Saying yummy is an understatement for how I felt when I savored the flavor of those dishes. \n\nAnd that was just the beginning. When it came to the entrees, we were completely blown away. We ordered the cod, bass, and the lobster. I would have to say they were all excellent, but the lobster dish was the star! I was in food heavy. \n\nWe felt really satisfied and semi-full, but we still decided to try out their dessert. We had the their home-made ice cream, some berry tart, and the beignets. They were all insanely good! That was pushing the evening to an unforgettable finale. \n\nI will go back to Spruce for sure, absolutely love it. Even though it's pricey, I think it's well worth it.

How did this happen? My good friend whom we call the 'Wangster' was the guest at our table to order an appetizer, and so the kitchen offered us a sampling of Carrot, Ginger Soup on the house! I like carrots, but usually they aren't my veggie of choice in soups as they usually make the soups rather chunky, but this soup was blended to perfection (SO creamy). \n\nEven the breads possessed the marks of care and thoughtfulness. Among the variety of breads available, I tried the wheat bread and the cranberry bread, both wonderful with the maple cinnamon butter provided. \n\nThe Maine Lobster contained an assortment of veggies, including tomatoes and onions, as well as chunks of what looked and tasted like candied cocoa. They certainly went out on a limb with the cocoa powder, but maybe I'm just not used to marrying chocolate with seafood. Nevertheless, the lobster wasn't anywhere close to tough, and the mix of veggies was fantastic.  \n\nService Review: The service at Spruce was superb. We had a reservation originally for a party of 4, but the restaurant was very helpful about expanding it to 6 for us on late notice, even on a busy Saturday evening. Our waiter and all of our servers were very cordial and professional: \n\n- Our waiter found out that we were on a tight schedule to make the showtime and gave extra attention to ensuring that our dishes came one after the other\n- Our waiter also gave us excellent recommendations from the truly extensive wine list at Spruce, providing an appropriate red and white wine selection for the table (Arneis and Frappato, both Italian wines if you'd like to try them!) \n- As unfortunately we weren't able to stay for dessert, our waiter brought us yet another item on the house: gourmet smores! \n\nVenue Review: There was plenty of street parking available at the time we arrived (3 hour max after 6pm, I believe), but the restaurant also offers a valet service. The restaurant itself was adorned with tasteful holiday decorations, with dim lighting and comfortable seating. \n\nOverall Impression: The food was fabulous and the venue was to be expected for a restaurant such as Spruce, but these combined with the truly top notch service we received is what makes this restaurant a 5-star in my mind. This is now one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Bay.", "author": "Rachael K."}

It was like being \"home for the holidays.\"\n\nThe Holiday streets and lighting surrounding the city of San Francisco made it even more pleasing to visit not only the restaurant but also the city itself! The ambience was very welcoming and comforting. The lighting and temperature of the restaurant was perfect. The environment of the restaurant was accommodating to all groups - families, friends, couples, and colleagues. \n\nWe started off with drinks.  They definitely weren't shy on the liquor.\n\nThey are known for their enormous wine bar! What a beautiful display :-)\n\nBefore ordering the salad, we were introduced to these small little smoked cheese puffs which were very delicious!!!  They were more like a tease...because anyone in their right state of mind would have screamed for more, pleaseeee!  \n\nMy salad was \"ok\".  I ordered the 'Young Lettuce' which consisted of goat cheese, fine herbs and seeds.  It was really bland and I didn't notice the seeds (not mixed) on the bottom of the lettuce till I finished the salad.  It may have made a difference in flavor.\n\nI ordered the 'Grilled Bavette Steak' for my main dish which consisted of duck fat potatoe fries (fries fried in duck fat), braised greens, and bordelaise.  The medium-well steak was cooked to perfection. The bordelaise sauce was perfect! They were a bit shy on the duck fries, however. I only got 4 small round fries. The braised greens were also good, but maybe a dash of salt too much (?).\n\nFinally, the best part. Dessert. I always look forward to my dessert, only because I have a sweet tooth after ALL my meals!  Also because the dessert shows the quality and the uniqueness of the restaurants, from preperation to the quality of the ingredients that bring out the flavor.  I ordered the 'Caramelia Mousse and Devil's Food Cake'.  I must say, this WAS good. The rich chocolate flavor of the Devil's Food Cake meshed well with the Caramelia Mousse.  This topped off the comfort of my evening. It was so soothing that I was ready to go to bed right then and there. \n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful experience at Spruce.

Let's call it my belated promotion + early birthday celebration!\n\nWe each ordered a round (and some) of cocktails.  Their wine list is 102 pages.  Not for the faint of heart.

It all worked perfectly together in harmony.  I can actually salivate thinking about the bass right now...\n\nThe others were smart enough to save room for dessert while I sat and looked on with a full tummy.

Spruce offers Contemporary American cuisine while producing fresh, local organic produce, line caught fish, perfectly aged cheese and naturally raised meats. \n\nI started my night off with the Cinderella Pumpkin Soup. (Maple Ice Cream, Walnuts, Pickled Pumpkin). I had to ask my server if I read the menu correct for I have never had Ice Cream in my soup.  He said \"Yes, that was the chef's intent\". OK, Nice!. After my first mouthful of Maple Ice Cream Pumpkin soup I said \"OK, I definitely see where the chef was going with this dish\". The hot and cold combination was genius. Very tasteful and unique in my opinion. Loved it.\n\nMy entree was just as good if not more memorable. I ordered the Stone Valley Farms Pork. (Arrowhead Cabbage,Anson Mills Grits,Pork Jus). One of the most succulent, well seasoned, tasty, tenderized pork dishes I have ever eaten. While every bite of pork  just melts in your mouth the texture and aftertaste were just incredible. While the Pork dish was out of this world the Pork Belly that accommodated the entree had a slight crunchiness via sautee process made the meal that more fantastic. Perfect compliment.  Kudos to the chef.\n\nFor dessert I selected the Trio of House made Sorbets. (Flavors were Pear, Passion Fruit and Chocolate). The Pear and Passion Fruit Sorbets were delicious. The chocolate on the other hand was very rich. Almost like 85% Dark Cocoa which is relatively rich in flavor. I understand what that Pastry Chef was trying to do but in my opinion I thought the Chocolate clashed with the  Pear and Passion Fruit Sorbet. Maybe a softer Sorbet flavor like Mango, Banana, Pineapple, or Dulce De Leche would have been a great. \n\nIn conclusion, My dining experience at Spruce was very pleasant and accommodating. From delicious starters to amazing entrees Spruce has really captured the essence of fine dining.  From start to finish everything seemed to flow very well. \n\nP.S.- Probably need to trim the trees out front for they are blocking the Spruce front entrance sign.

Had an early Valentine's Day dinner last weekend and figured any place you have too book three weeks in advance has to be good!  \n\nFirst off, the loved the decor / ambiance.  Vaulted ceilings, dark woods, and tables packed with people dressed to their nines - I guess this is how the the other half (by half I mean rich people in bowties) lives!  I will say that the place is super loud for a fine dining experience, it seems more suited for after-work drinks - having said that, I will definitely have to come by for some happy hour in the future.  \n\nFood-wise we thought it was pretty hit-or-miss.  We started with the Cinderella Pumpkin Soup and Seared Scallops, both of which were nice.  Soup-wise, the maple ice cream and pickled pumpkin combined to make an interesting tangy flavor - good, not great.  The seared scallops were cooked perfectly, resulting in a slightly crispy outside and tender on the inside.  After that, things started going downhill - for mains we tried the mussels and tombo tuna fish.  The mussels were pretty good but nothing too special - there's a number of places in SF that would be a better bet.  The tombo tuna was pretty much a bust - the fish felt dry and overcooked and the sauce was rich but bland.  \n\nAll in all not a bad restaurant but a bit underwhelming after reading and hearing all the praise about Spruce - I'd say 1 star for the decor / ambiance and another two for the food.

If you are not happy about your cocktail or feel the flavor needs to be modified, they will do it for of no charge. \n\nFood: I was really disappointed that they didn't update the menu on Yelp. Some items are seasonal so please keep that in mind. The portions were small, but somehow it was fulfilling. My sister got the Grilled Bavette Steak and I got the Butter Poached Lobster. Flavor and freshness was up to par and we cleaned those plates off.  \n\nCrowd/Atmosphere: I don't like the lighting of Spruce. Dimmed lighting is supposed to create an intimate atmosphere, but it was hard to see and it took a while for our eyes to adjust.

Reality came and brought me back when I bit into that perfect piece of arctic char.\n\nDark as it was, the restaurant was nicely furnished and we had no problems navigating about.  Even after some adjustment, we ended up barely being able to see the others at the table throughout the entire night, but somehow still able to see everything that was on the various plates.  Not a big deal to me, but some folks would probably freak out if they weren't able to see every dust speck on their plate.  \n\nEveryone that we dealt with the entire night were consummate professionals.  They took our coats upon coming in, knew their stuff, and made some great recommendations.  Hats off to great all around service.  They staggered all of the seatings and just about everyone in the building looked pleased the entire night with this well-oiled example of a fine dining machine.\n\nWe ordered quite a bit of stuff, so let me lay it out in list fashion:\n\"Introduction\" caviar platter with toasted potato and creme fraiche (good, and cheap)\nBeet and pear salad with goat milk cheese (delicious)\nRed pumpkin soup (good)\nHarvest squash ravioli (delicious)\nCabbage soup (good)\nSeared sweetbreads (good)\nArtic char with horseradish beet vinaigrette (delicious)\nBavette steak with duck fat potatoes (good* the chard was a bit tough)\nRabbit in three preparations (good, tastes like chicken nuggets lmao!)\ntheir take on vanilla cheesecake (good)\nViennese blend coffee (amazing)\nmint tisane (good)\nwines (good selection)\nAs you can see, everything was either good or delicious.  They didn't mess up anything, nor did they have any mediocre recipes, quite impressive.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed and that coffee at the end was the best brewed coffee I've had since I can remember.  They definitely pride themselves in their coffee selection and with its taste.  I've really never had restaurant coffee so good.\n\nAt the end of the night, it was still an extravagant and expensive meal, but considering the good portions and how full we were by the end, it was well worth it.  It is also a knock out win when compared to some other Michelin-starred restaurants in the same or higher price bracket.", "author": "Al C."}

The service was great.  It's the kind of restaurant that neatly folds your napkin if you step away from the table for a moment.  I did request that they fold the napkin in the shape of a turtle next time but didn't dock them when they didn't; perhaps I should have asked for a swan shape.\n\nWe found the waitstaff to be knowledgeable and very engaging.  The suggested wine pairings were spot on.   My husband and I shared the Heirloom Tomato appetizer and the Sweetbread appetizer.  Excellent presentation and execution for both.  The tomatoes were flavorful and the sweetbreads with the accompanying sauce were among the best I've had.\n\nWe splurged on the entree.  One of the specials was a bone-in ribeye steak.  Lovingly aged for 21 days, etc., etc.  The cuts were HUUUUGE.  They brought out the available cuts on a huge platter and we chose the smallest one to share.  The *smallest* one was 39 ounces.  It was so comically large, I wanted to ask if we were to receive a free t-shirt or our name on a plaque if we finished the entire steak in 45 minutes or less.\n\nMy husband and I split this beautiful piece of meat; his portion was medium, mine was medium rare.  And let me tell you, it was actually spot on with the temp.  Some restaurants veer towards medium when you ask for medium rare but luckily that was not the case at Spruce since this was steak was gorgeous.\n\nMy husband spent most of his time making googly eyes at his entree and ignoring me - did I mention this was our anniversary dinner? - but I didn't care since I was softly cooing to my portion and the wine reduction sauce they served with it.\n\nDessert was beignets - not much to say there.  Fried dough is generally delicious.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience from ambiance, to food, to service to the fancy napkin folding.", "author": "Monica C."}

They have a dinner menu and a bar menu and you can order from either or both.  I knew I wanted to burger again, but I also wanted to try something new.\n\nHad the charcuterie platter and the spread was pretty good.\n\nThe waiter told us about an item that was not on the menu that night.  Risotto with truffles.  Let me rephrase that.  Creamy, rich risotto with FRESHLY SHAVED TRUFFLES sprinkled on top.  Let me rephrase that.  Risotto with white truffle shavings (where they come out with the truffle in its delicate glass container and shave slivers of this treasure into your rich, creamy, delicious risotto.)  I could smell the aroma of the truffles as he was shaving it in.

We ordered a sampling of appetizers and found the highlight to be the roasted diver scallops. The beet salad and gem lettuce salad rounded out the course. Entrees arrived to include the New Zealand Bass, the ravioli and the Spruce burger. The bass came with mini dumplings which were delicious - if only there were more of them!

That's why we had a holiday dinner party at Park Tavern last month, and today a holiday lunch at Spruce.  \n\nI think our dinner at Park Tavern was a little more successful.  Spruce, while lovely, is more of the Pacific Heights ladies who lunch hangout than the places we usually frequent.  I think the majority of the clients were wearing Chanel, St. John or maybe Prada for the \"edgy\" dressers.  But they were eating - and drinking!\n\nNo booze for us, but we put a dent in the menu.  After starting with some warmed olives and amazing french fries, we were served our soups and salads.  I had the celeriac soup with chestnut creme.  It was delightful, but a little too sweet from the creme.  Another table mate had the same thought about his pumpkin soup, which had maple ice cream in it.  More desserty than appetizer course.\n\nI chose the duck confit for my entree, as did several others.  It was served with Parmesan foam, which was just so delicious!  I didn't care for the shreds of lettuce that lined the bowl, but there of the dish was marvelous and very rich.  Unfortunately, my colleague's dish contained a live worm, so that spoiled the meal for him.\n\nThe service was perfect - very attentive without hovering, which drives me crazy.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was impeccable. I would highly recommend this spot for dinner if you're looking for a splurge night.\n\nBut yesterday I went there for brunch, and it was a complete cluster. Not on Spruce's part, mind you, but mine, and they were so gracious and accommodating and I am seriously so in love with them.\n\nSo I was trying to surprise my mama for her birthday (since we had such a great time here last year, I thought it would be a perfect spot) by getting the whole fam together for brunch at Spruce. It was also my step brother's birthday, so we decided to make it a dual party. Let's just say the surprise didn't go as smooth as planned, so they were about 30 minutes late, and the waiter and hostess were just dolls about it. They didn't rush us, they didn't pressure us to order anything or hang over our table, and they were just gracious hosts! 15 stars for bubbly hostess and patient waiter. \n\nSo finally everyone was there, and our waiter had to put up with the whole group of six of us, which is definitely a lot to handle! The waiter was so funny, and just rolled with the punches and put up with our ridiculous jokes and multiple requests and orders and millions of questions. Then the pastry chef himself came out and brought us some banana bread and coffee cake in the middle of our \"gift giving\" (this consisted of passing around ridiculous Christmas hats with bells and lights and sequins, etc etc etc), and just had a great time joking with us about it while he told us about our delicious bread appetizers.  35 stars for awesome funny waiter and pastry chef. \n\nThen we got our brunch, and everything was cooked to perfection. I had the salmon, and it was insanely beautiful, not to mention literally the best salmon I've ever had. Half the table got the lobster eggs benedict (do I really have to even mention that this was also perfection? Seriously. Amazing), and the other half got the duck, which was served in a quiche. It was beautiful, and it was actually good! I didn't think it would be any good served that way, but Spruce, of course, did it right. 100 stars. \n\nI also had a cake delivered, and they brought it with candles and the whole nine yards. The pastry chef came out again and offered to cut the cake, and asked us if we would like some of his home made vanilla ice cream with it... and the answer was... wait for it... YES. Duh. It was a custom cake with my step-brothers face on it, so I asked them if they could give him the piece with just his face, kinda joking, kinda not (I wanted to see if they would!!). So guess what they did? YEP! Huge face cake right on his plate with a hunk of vanilla ice cream.  OK FINE ONE MILLION STARS. \n\nI've been to quite a few 5-star restaurants in this city, and rare is the occasion where you can get half the wait staff to join in the hijinks and interact with you on such a great level - usually they are so busy being polite that it's hard for their personality to join in on the fun. \n\nThey just made the day so wonderful and so perfect - I just love them. I don't think we would have had such a great time anywhere else, which makes me want to hug them all! \n\nSeriously. Love this place.", "author": "E. B."}

Though it's a nicer restaurant with impeccable service, the room is pretty lively, so you're free to have whatever conversations without feeling like you're being loud.\n\nThey have valet, but parking in this area isn't bad, especially at night.  Getting to Pacific Heights around dinner time can be a pain, though.\n\nThey have a nice wine list, but if you're in the mood for cocktails, they do both classic and more unique house cocktails.  For me, Pomerosa was a nice starter - bubbly and sweet, but it was the East side that was more refreshing and strong (think cucumber, lime, etc).\n\nHouse bread included wheat, a cranberry bread, and a brioche-like roll.  House made butter included plain and a rosemary butter.  We were then greeted with an amuse of a gougere - one of my all time favorite things, which I could have eaten a whole plate of.\n\nWe kind of created our own tasting between the four of us.  \n\nFor appetizers, we got:\n1. Carrot Veloute - smooth, blended orange puree that was velvety, poured over this crunchy date streusel with a slight flowering hint from crysanthemum.\n2. Sweetbreads - classic (veal).\n3. Buratta - house made with vegetables, better paired with the heirloom tomatoes (with cornbread croutons!), which they brought us by accident on the house.  I think I would have preferred a little more salt for this.\n4. Spruce burger - medium rare with gruyere - split into 4 pieces, it was just the right amount, with a ton of flavor and a buttery roll that soaked up all the burger juices.  Fries on the side were well seasoned, too. \n\nOnto entrees:\n1. Seared Scallops - scallops were on the smaller side (maybe U-15 at most), loved the aliums, which had a sweet garlicky flavor.  I could have done without the roasted garlic veloute, as the dish itself was well flavored.  The okra surprisingly worked very well with it.\n2. Cod - seared just right, flaky, tender, smoky, with a clean mushroom dashi broth.\n3. Suckling pig - it came with various parts of the pig tonight, including the belly.  It's a rich dish but had lots of flavor.\n4. Grilled Bavette Steak - medium rare for sure, tender in the middle, loved the red wine bordelaise.\n\nTo finish (I couldn't resist, since my friend's wife is the pastry chef..)\n1. Beignets - loved the vanilla sauce, but the chocolate sauce was amazing, and beignets were warm, light, and airy\n2. Plum Tart - buttery walnut tart, topped with honey, with a really nice thyme sorbet\n3. Cherry Bombe - coated with a semifreddo, lots of dark cherry flavor\n\nEven though I got decaf, it was brewed very well, and I liked it black - the beans aren't ground until you order it, and they have special beans roasted specifically for them in Emeryville.\n\nWe ended with a final treat of lemon financiers with a fig jam in the center. \n\nThe meal was well paced, and our server was very charming.  It's very cozy, and I like that they offer lunch options at dinner, so you have the option of something more casual.  They did have a melon \"tasting,\" which was 4 courses, but I have a melon intolerance, so that was out.  Nonetheless, we really liked our self created tasting shared among the four of us.\n\nIn total, it came out to be less than $100 per person, all inclusive (tax, tip, healthy SF fee, cocktail), which was very reasonable.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

We were seated in the side room, separate from the main restaurant, which was a very charming den with a live fireplace where you could actually hear each other talk. (The main dining room is very dark, very loud, and not particularly intimate.) Our main complaint was that the chairs were terribly uncomfortable for a meal of over an hour.\n\nWe were started with these tasty gruyere puffs as an amuse, tangy and a little salty with just a touch of gooey goodness on the inside. Of the appetizers, the seared scallops with black garlic and sherry gastrique was probably the best of the ones I tried, with one huge problem: the scallops were merely warm, not hot, as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time before reaching our table. I had ordered the sweetbreads with farro and english peas, which were fried perfectly but under-seasoned to the point where I had to add salt to the dish (which I NEVER do). Otherwise, it tasted just like Taiwanese popcorn chicken minus the Chinese five spice, something that I love but did not expect to receive 3 pieces of at a high end restaurant for $10.\n\nOf the entrees, I ordered the black cod with \"crisp\" kale, butterbeans, and a ham hock consomme. Unfortunately, there was absolutely no texture to the dish, as the fish was skinless and poached (I believe), and the kale was certainly not crisp as it sat in the consomme. Otherwise, the duck breast was ok, while the accompanying cassoulet sausage provided all the actual flavor of the dish beyond simply duck. The best dish was surprisingly the pork tenderloin, which is actually more appropriately a pork 3-way between juicy tenderloin cubes with great depth of flavor thanks to the pork jus, a superb of smoky crispy pork belly, and pork shoulder cooked into a rich dollop of hearty grits.\n\nOf the desserts, we tried the beignets, which were fluffy, airy and warm; I think the vanilla creme anglaise was actually superior to the dark chocolate sauce as it was a little richer (I do love dark chocolate). I ordered the parsnip cake for kicks, and it turned out to be pieces of a cake not that far off from coffee cake but significantly less sweet; the pear gelee was ok, while the white coffee ice cream was fantastic and deserved to have been served with larger serving spoons. We were capped off with little brownie bites with cocoa nuggets, tasty but not anything truly noteworthy.\n\nService here is very good, as our server was generally there when we needed him and was a very warm and congenial fellow. Overall, I felt that the techniques behind the dishes were sound but the overall flavoring was lacking, with a few bright exceptions. I generally do not have such bad \"luck\" when ordering dishes, and I feel this place deserves as least 1 more chance before writing it off entirely.", "author": "Gene C."}

We walked over there and the valet guys saw us walking up and one guy walked towards the door to, what it seemed liked, open it for us, then he turned around and walked the other direction because a car had pulled up to valet. That's nice.....\n\nWe had reservations at 7:30pm and when we arrived our table wasn't ready.  We chose to sit at the bar and have a cocktail. They have a full bar, 200 page wine list, and some creative cocktails. I had the East West cocktail, which was like a mojito w/o the annoying mint. Yum. 30 minutes later, our table was ready, ONLY because my date got up and asked where the hell it was. That seemed a little annoying to me that they forgot about us. \n\nWe were seated in the middle. Beautiful table. The service was impeccable. The wine sommelier was my favorite person of the night. She listened to what we liked, what we were going to eat, and offered us a great choice. I like whites, my date likes reds. She was nice enough to bring out a glass of red just for him. \n\nDinner was amazing. They served the meal as if it were a fine dining style. You get little nibbles in between. I'd say, it was like the finer dining style like Michael Minna, but less uptight then French Laundry. Something we definately need, and in between style where you feel like a star but not shell out $500 for it. I had the lobster, which was ORGASMIC. Buttery, savory, tasteful, and the portion was just right. My date had the halibut, which he said was \"okay\". We chose the beignets for dessert. I could have skipped the dips, because the beignets themselves were amazing. \n\nDinner ended around 11pm. We closed the place down. We were the last set out. I must have gone to the bathroom 5 times during the 4 hours of bliss. We walked to the front to grab our coats. I got mine okay, but then there was some drama for my date. They could not locate his coat. There were 2 coats left in the closet, one was mine, the other was NOT his. They gave it away to some other fool, and that fool wasn't smart enough to realize it wasn't his coat! Needless to say, I was too tired to let my temper out. The manager gave us her card, and told us that maybe the fool with the jacket that wasn't his will bring it back. FAT CHANCE. She then offered to compensate us some way if it doesn't turn up. We left the restaurant confused and he was shivering. Poor guy. \n\nFollow up: My date called a week later to follow up. He had not heard from them and they said that they would send him a check. We're still waiting for it.\n\nI suggest you not come in your nicest jacket in your closet. Be prepared...people do loose things.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

They were offering a black truffle menu (which I would have done in an instant) but no one else was ordering it so I ordered a la carte to keep the pace nice for the other guests.\n\nStarters:\nPumpkin soup with maple ice cream (delicious)\nBurrata with veggies (unremarkable - the vegetables didn't complement the cheese)\nScallops (tasty but they were quite small)\n\nA man runs around with a bread basket offering three types of bread. I told him, \"No thank you unless you have something gluten free\" and apparently he either didn't hear me, ignored me, or didn't speak English....but he departed and I was left breadless. Our server was fabulous with respect to ensuring that the rest of my meal was safe from the dreaded gluten though.\n\nMains:\n- Black truffle risotto (delicious but tiny portion of rissoto)\n- Lobster (small portion of lobster and barely any vegetables to accompany. Came with gobs of foam which I dislike - I don't recall seeing the foam in the menu description so perhaps this was my bad. In all, this was my least favorite lobster dish I've had.  It was swimming in a dark sauce (think another poster mentioned it being chocolate) with foam, vegetables didn't complement the lobster. I couldn't taste the lobster for the sauce...it was too overpowering some something as delicate as lobster.\n- Duck (decent sized portion but I didn't get to taste this - it did look good though!)\n- Ahi  (looked OK, unremarkable. I think that the person who ordered it ordered it cooked \"well\", which I would not have done as I like it more \"Sashimi Style\")\n\nWine list:\nReally nice - massive list. They have a couple pages of bottles under $80 which makes things easy. \n\nDessert:\nTrio of ice cream (as I'm gluten free). Lemon verbena, vanilla, and a tropical sorbet (mango? I forget). The lemon verbena was really nice.\n\nPortions were tiny and despite having TWO of my own starters, a main, and a shared single dessert, I left hungry and not really \"wowed\" by the food. I'm sort of amazed that they don't list extra vegetables that you can order for the table since the portions are so small.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that there weren't any entrees for vegetarians - however they do let you order a pasta side (double up?) which works. Also, the risotto was also vegetarian. But in all, not a lot of choices. Even less options for vegans.\n\nFor what it is aspiring to be, I would give this 3.5 stars. If given another night of carte blanche eating I would save my budget for a different restaurant. Sorry. I truly wanted to love this place as the reviews and menu looked unreal, but I was so hungry by the time I got back home that I had a piece of gluten free apple pie and went to bed.\n\nWhat saves this place is the amazing service and swanky decor.", "author": "Linda C."}

I can't remember what it was, but remembered it was delicious, so I choose Spruce for a special night out for our \"baby-moon\".\n\nService was great at first, but then felt like our server took a break or something.  People around us arrived after and left before, while we just sat there waiting for the check.  \n\nBefore the meal, we received a choice of fresh breads and flavored butter--both were great.\n\nFor starters we shared the Burrata, and the Celeriac soup. \n\nThe burrata was okay, but I typically LOVE burrata.  I don't think this one compares to Perbacco's at all.  \n\nThe soup was the highlight of the meal, and I would definitely order that again and again.\n\nI had the halibut--It was okay, but I would not order it again. \n\nMy husband had the short ribs, which were good.  I might order it again. \n\nThe beignets were just okay.  The dipping sauces were just okay.  I have to say, I think krispy kreme is about 100% better than these.\n\nI expected a lot more, and it was just normal.  Not worth the $230 bill, with only 1 person drinking.

Let me tell you that Chris was spot on with the pairings. Both wines were wonderful. We shared the beignets for dessert and had coffee and tea with it.

This goes along with their 90 page wine list which is phenomenal. I started with a nocino cocktail (first time I've had that in a cocktail and it was awesome), then we moved on to the culinary delights:\n\n1. House-made Charcuterie. Duck pate, duck rillette, veal tongue, braesola, pork shoulder, and a salami. Nice selections even if you have some non-pork eaters.\n\n2. Cherries, house-made burrata (mozzarella and cream), greens, and pine nuts.\n\n3. Seared sweetbreads with mushrooms and served over tagliarini cooked in a butter sauce.\n\n4.  Honey lacquered duck breast with cinnamon spiced four gras and glazed rhubard.\n\n5. Slow-roasted beef short rib with red wine farotto. \n\n6. Beignets with chocolate sauce and frenetic anglaise. Wow! And yes, these were actually better than Cafe du Monde, even though I know that is heresy.\n\n7. Dark chocolate fudge with butterscotch, malted chocolate ice cream, and smoked almond tuile.\n\n8. Strawberry Gary with fromage blanc custard and strawberry creme fraiche sorbet.\n\nAnd now, for the other side of the critique. The food here was really great but not amazing. Also, our 3-course dinner took 4 hours, so you should definitely only come if you're ok with what we called \"very relaxed service\".

How do you pick a place that your mom will a) like the food, b) won't criticize about the service, and c) will cater to her scheduling and convenience needs.  In preparation for the big weekend, I made these reservations one month ahead.  Here's what we ate:\nShared appetizers\n1) Roasted Mussels - Served in a silver skillet, the mussels were roasted in a creamy, garlic sauce.  The flavor was nice and all of the mussels were open, indicative of their freshness.  The broth was great for bread dipping and my dad even saved the remaining broth as a soup.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=WnJJpKDK-Z7h3gTjn6B5Kw)\n2) Pomme Frites (2 orders) - Served is an aioli dipping sauce, they were warm, though not as crispy and thin as I like.  Still, a nice accompaniment to the mussels.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=dNOH5gh56iTJ7xfAl_fDgA)\n3) Seared Scallops (2 orders) -  Each order consisted of three perfectly seared scallops with a light sauce.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=PCpmLz8nknIiojdj4N9Qvg)\n4) English Pea Ravioli (2 orders) - Soft pillows filled with mashed peas, sweet and consistent.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=UFFseNfqKx1MWuZ8u5wNaw)\n5) Foie Gras -  My sister wanted to try this as I am more of a fan of seared foie gras.  Served with crustless bread wedges, everyone tried a bite.  Tasty, but nothing spectacular to me.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=b0Mk9k6SEV-IXotxSa7Ppg)\nEntree\n6) Berkshire Pork Tenderloin and Pork Belly - Served with rustic butter beans and some greens, this is my favorite item on the menu... no matter what else is on the menu (steak? duck? lobster?), after a short pause, my mouth automatically utters \"Pork\".  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=DzXgDVK5kh7nK362VD6K1g)\n7) Poached Lobster - My dad gave me a bite which was good.  Hard to fail on lobster unless it's not fresh or overcooked. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=1jn4yITidsXdV-5J4exS9A)\n8) Filet Mignon special - Not listed on the regular menu, the waiter offered this as an alternative to their Bavette Steak.  My brother ordered and enjoyed this, but can't comment since he didn't share. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=tOn7zOASk1a5dOa-NKmW9A)\nDesserts\n9) Chocolate Peanut Brownie - Think of a thick, dense dark Chocolate cake topped with some honey clustered peanuts and served with a small scoop of chocolate gelato and small scoop of sorbet.\n10) Beignets (2 orders) - Comprising of six per order and served with two dipping sauces (vanilla and chocolate), these warm, buttery, sugary puffs disappeared in the blink of an eye.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=Ye2OjqH_yw3dWd1UQ_tRKw)\n\n** Amuse Bouche - served before dinner, the restaurant served a warm mini cheese scone.\nAfter the meal, I wandered into the store portion of the restaurant, also where they prepare their salumi plates.  I purchased three giant cookies (two were giant, like half of a Nerf basketball (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=FycCS2srYhli7NxteDXE8A), and the other was about 2/3rd as large - fudge cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZfMLpV7p3EvRv3Idpx89sQ?select=FZGj7YR0eDtgdNLJJaYD0A)).  At $4.00 per cookie, it is a bit pricey, but the size justified the pricing.

After having some drinks and appetizers in the bar area, we got lucky and were able to be seated at a real table, (although still in the bar area.) \n\nWe shared a few items: pastrami sandwich, (which should be described as a reuben), and scallops. \nThe pastrami was good, but i pulled all the sauerkraut off, and there was a lot of it. \nThe scallops were cooked perfectly, and I really enjoyed the slight curry flavor. It was different, and interesting. \n\nOnce we were seated we also had: the sweet corn ravioli, and one of the specials, heirloom tomatoes with burrata. The ravioli were absolute perfection. I would highly recommend this dish. It might have been the best thing I tasted that night. \nThe tomato salad was...a tomato salad. I can make this at home, so I wasn't that impressed, and i thought the price for it was a bit steep. \n\nFor entrees our table had: bavette steak, pork tenderloin, duck, and a fish dish, ( i think it was bass.) \nThe fish was cooked perfectly, and might be the lightest dish I have ever had in a restaurant. It was served with tabbouleh, (which tasted more like cous cous) taziki, and cucumbers and tomatoes. It was good, but not that memorable. \nThe steak was seasoned really well, and seemed to be the favorite of the table. \nThe pork was good, but nothing impressive. My guy grills pork tenderloin at home all the time, and his is just as good. \n\nSince it was my friend's birthday, we got two desserts and shared. \nOne was the peach cobbler, and the other was a special that day, tiramisu. \nWhile both were tasty, and the tiramisu was different than the usual version, neither was mind blowing. \n\nService was good, and I appreciated they put a candle in my friend's dessert.

It's obvious a lot of thought and care is put into the food here. \n\nThis is a definitely more of a special occasion place,it's a little pricey for a random dinner out.

Unfortunately, he wasn't blown out of the water but I totally was!!! I mean...it's not Hob Knob truffle fries, but these thick cut fries are seriously good eats and, like truffle fries, adds a whole new dimension to the french fry art: super crisp fried savory coating surrounding a subtly sweet, earthy \"juicy\" flavor.

Order a side of this for $10. \n\nNext up: My Halibut dish: grilled and layered over a puree of peas + mint over sauteed scallion-esque veggies + tender mushrooms. Hands down the BEST halibut I've ever had. Perfection on a plate. ($30)\n\nNext next: My friend's Lobster + Golden Potato Gnocchi Dish. HUGE piece of lobster; very tender served over very delicate gnocchi in a creamy sauce. Personally...I thought this dish was a bit under-seasoned, friend thought it was \"The BEST lobster\" he's ever had. He even went as far to write it down on the receipt as a note to the waiter.

($10)\n\nAnd in addition to all of the above...COMPLIMENTARY: bread, mini appetizers (take-my-breath-away delicate cheese puffs), and mini desserts (home made coconut marshmallows and cherry aguar candy). This is what certainly takes the place up a whole level. \n\nThe service was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive (not the most personable, imo, but not pretentious at all).

And the ambiance uber romantic and sophisticated: simple, yet classy. \n\nFinal Notes:\n- DO make reservations at least a few days in advance\n- DO order duck fat fries\n- DO be prepared to spend $50 minimum per person (splurge worthy!)\n- DO dress up a bit more than usual (I felt very under dressed wearing jeans and a nice cardigan...)\n- DO spoil your loved ones here :)", "author": "Gail N."}

If you're looking for the right restaurant for a special occasion - look no further than Spruce. The sophisticated ambiance and impeccable service makes it the perfect setting for an intimate dinner. If you want to pull out all of the stops, make reservations for the main dining room (well in advance). \n\nBut honestly, what I really enjoy at Spruce is the bar. Their inventive cocktails taste dangerously delicious, their extensive wine list impresses, and I completely love that you can order food. In fact, they have a special bar menu that includes their famous burger. It's a total steal at $14 and positively scrumptious.

I have no complaints, none whatsoever. \n\nWe sat at the bar first and had their Pinot Gris (delicious) and the charcuterie selection, which is all house made. I would recommend getting the a la carte option because there's too much in the complete order, and some of the things I didn't care for, so make your own with what you like. For dinner I ordered the Young Lettuces with the goat cheese tart, it was delicious and the lettuce very fresh, you could tell it was local and organic. I also had a bite of my husband's Purple Top Turnip Soup with the caviar, and it was also excellent. For the main course I had the Rib-Eye Steak, which was grilled to perfection and the bordelaise sauce and pur\u00e9ed potato was sooo good. My husband had the duck with the foie gras and it was the best duck I have ever tasted, very very tender. For our wine, we described our taste to our server and his suggestion was perfect, I can't believe he knew what bottle to suggest out of the thousand wines they have, so props to our server for that!  For dessert we shared the cheesecake and the apple tart. The cheesecake was 10 times better, I would definitely recommend that over the apple tart.\n\nThe whole experience was exquisite.

Living in SF, these ingredients are not as exclusive as the server would have liked us to think. I know where to get \"sought after\" Dirty Girl strawberries. It felt REALLY patronizing and hard sell-y. The check backs on the food came before I could even take my first bite. This happened with both my app and entree. Gee, thanks.\n\nThe \"something from the kitchen\" was shockingly banal, some cold bread cheese bite, was such an odd choice since the only thing we'd had up until that point was bread. Gee, thanks for the bread after my bread. Thoughtless, token and boring. \n\nThe sommelier only addressed my husband, and only asked what he was having to eat. Didn't consider my food choices when recommending a bottle of wine. Gee, thanks.\n\nI hate to refer to myself as a \"foodie\", but if you are a foodie I really say don't bother. This restaurant panders to the wealthy neighborhood and I don't feel that it's a destination. There are many, many other restaurants that have much better food and service.

Personally, I am past the point in life where I enjoy this sort of pretension.  This turned me off before I even sat down.\n\nThe food is pretty good, and the place is, if you really like brown, reasonably aesthetic.  (I'm an architect and mark my words, this will look terribly dated in five years)  Also, unlike many high-end San Francisco restaurants, even when its packed, its never really loud in there.  Sorry to say, this is the quality about Spruce I most liked.\n\nThe giant proviso is that, the quality of the food does not come close to justifying the prices.  The wine list is pretty impressive, but the prices are simply astronomical.\n\nOne of the things I love to do at high end restaurants is to scour the wine list for bargains.  Often, if you know a little about what you're looking for, such places, because they contract for wine in large volume, months ahead of time, you can find stellar, sublime wines, for less than what you'd pay at retail.  I found no such bargains at Spruce, perhaps after its been open for a few years.\n\nFor half the kind of money you'll spend on a meal at Spruce, better food can be had at lots(!) of places in San Francisco.\n\nI live less than a block away and if you want to come to my neighborhood for a memorable San Francisco dining experience, go to Cafe Sociale directly across the street and down the alley at 3665 Sacramento.  We love Sociale, it is also, not, cheap.  But the food is better, the air does not drip with pretense, and,  smaller and more intimate, and, it isn't half populated with puffed up posers and aspiring beautiful people.  Nor at Sociale will they look at you askance because host/hostess doesn't approve of the suit your wearing.\n\nI really despise that sort of crap. Its one of the things about my native New York that I don't like.  This is why I personally loath Gary Danko's eponymous local restaurant, its full of largely the same sort of people.\n\nIts possible we caught them on a couple of off nights, but that said, this is not a place I would seek out in San Francisco.

The preparation is overly precious, the menu options narrow, and the food rather sterile tasting. It's like the food at your typical Ritz Carlton, impressive looking but dead.  \nIf you have rich relatives from out of town who enjoy food by virtue of it's being being pricey and well-presented, or you're meeting a first date at the bar, you could do worse than bringing them here. The setting is lovely and the service gracious and very well executed.  \nBut if you're hungry, eat something before you get there. The portions are the insufferably small ones emblematic of today's elite dining experience and the media depictions mocking same.

And they do offer the entire menu at the bar.  We even found a couple of very comfortable seats right in the middle of the counter.\n\nThe meal began, even at the bar, with an amuse - in this case the exceedingly common yet still delicious gruyere gougeres.\n\nThough it took a while to tease all of the many options out of them, the staff was accommodating, pleasant and well-informed.  They offer, every Sunday this summer, a pairing of three glasses of burgundy - some relatively high end - and their burger.  Among the many options for the burger - at least until the end of June - is a topping of a smallish chunk of seared foie gras.  It may be a $16 burger ( $29 with foie ), but it just might be worth it.  The couple seated next to us ordered two burgers with different toppings split, so they each got to try both options.\n\nWe also ordered the foie dish from the main menu - a pretty straight forward and fairly small seared preparation.  We were disappointed to see that they did not have any of the more creative options on the menu that evening.\n\nThe burger came with fries - medium cut and perfectly, perfectly cooked.  Some of the best we've had recently.  In keeping with a theme of providing well-thought-out value in your $16 hamburger, the fries were served in warm, thick metal containers which kept them deliciously hot and crisp for quite some time.\n\nThe hamburger itself - a quality product ordered medium-rare - was extremely juicy with a good sear and excellent meaty taste.  Condiments including thinly sliced and slightly spicy pickles, romaine lettuce, and sliced tomato were offered on the side.  The only complaint I might offer is that when sliced in half at least, the burger was difficult to eat as a sandwich - drippy and not particularly cohesive.  Still, it was an excellent burger by any measure.\n\nWe finished with the highly recommended beignets - eight light and airy donut holes served with both Guittard chocolate sauce and creme Anglaise.

I took my husband there last night for his 40th birthday. It was not the experience I was hoping for. I had requested on my open-table to please make it special for his 40th and that I would bring candles. \n\nThe appetizer of veal breads was OK,  not to die for but good. The service on a Monday night was super slow took forever to get our cocktails and wine. \nMy husband ordered the bavette steak which the server did not tell us that it is a chewy cut of meat until after my husband took a bite and thought it was super gross and way too chewy. He ended up getting the burger which is awesome and I think that's what people should get if they go. Of course then we had to share my meal because I didn't want him to have to wait to eat since they then had to go and cook the burger. I ordered their infamous duck. It was OK, good flavors but not crispy on the outside and sorta tender on the inside. I have had way better. \n\nThen we were super full and the server was pushing dessert on us even though we didn't want it. She said \"cmon its your birthday and you know what comes next so just order something\". That made me think she was going to comp the dessert and needed a place for the candles I brought. Nope, instead she brought out a tiny complimentary dessert with the candles (that was not very good) and then brought out the dessert that we ordered but didn't really even want and were too full to have it. Of course we were charged for that too.  They wrote \"happy birthday\" on the plate but not his name and didn't do anything to make it special for him. The service overall was super slow (our server was super nice though and had great selections of wine). The wines we chose were great but the by the glass list is very average. \n\nI would actually probably give it 2.5 stars but yelp doesn't allow you. The ambiance is nice, love the bar.

We just wanted something casual, beer/cocktail and a burger.\n\nWe were seated at their impressive marble bar and were greeted by, quite possibly, the most awesome bartender in SF.  He was knowledgeable about all the items listed on the regular menu as well as the drink menu.  He took our drink orders: first up for me was a Blood & Sand and for him a Guiness.  The cocktail was well made and the orange was fresh.

The beans were a tease: perfect in every way and such a miniscule portion as to be embarrassing even to my server.

In fact, it's my new favorite burger in SF when you include the fries. And how can you not?! They're fried twice, in duck fat! So yes, it is worth the price.\n\nWe followed up that ridiculous starter with a more traditional starter, the veal sweetbreads with a poached egg. Served along with a Lyonnaise salad, the dish was very enjoyable and even better than expected. My girlfriend had never eaten sweetbreads, and this proved why my eyes lit up after seeing it on the menu. \n\nFinally, we ate the roasted dorade. The white fish was served with cheese and prosciutto in 3-inch cubes that were as easy to love as they were to cut through their layers into incredible bites, one after another.\n\nThe house and classic cocktails offer a fair amount of variety. Bourbon always calls out to me, and the Whiskey Smash with Buffalo Trace was no different. The wine list is impressive also. We generally get a few glasses to share because our courses can, and did on this night, run the gamut. \n\nI recognized our server from Cafe Des Amis, which is a sister restaurant. He treated us well, then and now, and shared additional info about Spruce and its food. After the meal, another server stopped by our table to inquire about our meal as well.

Dude, foie butter covered in pistachios with seared foie on the side with really delicious pear and pear jelly with WAFFLES? I just have one thing to say: Damn you hippies for banning foie gras. Ban the practice of stuffing ducks not the ability for restaurants to serve foie gras. You buffoons. This is the dish that I will miss the most.

It comes on an English muffin style bun that's crisp but almost a bit too crisped for my tastes.  However the meat was very juicy so there was slightly a dichotomy between the bun and burger going on.  The accouterments included pickled onions and pickles, tomatoes and lettuce, and I got mine with cheddar and bacon.  The bacon wasn't as tasty at the bacon at Mission Beach Cafe but nonetheless it's bacon so it's good right?\n\nSince I was dining with my burger compatriots Andrei Z and Melanie N, we all ordered ours medium rare, but all of ours came out more medium instead.  A little bit of a disappointment but the burger was still so juicy so I could overlook that a bit.\n\nI have to say though that the overall experience is great at Spruce and they definitely get ups on that.  Presentation and service is excellent and you definitely get a good amount of food.", "author": "Gene X."}

Winter salad? Just OK. Charcuterie plate, lardo tasted rancid and rest was not bad but not great. Scallops decent but not super memorable. Lobster? Weird cocoa flavor just didn't work for me (or my fellow diners). The standouts were the fries (ordered twice) from the bar menu, crispy, salty and fluffy texture inside. And the sturgeon. I've never had sturgeon before and it was just delicious with a seared crispy outside and yummy artichoke/sunchoke sides, we all fought for the last bites of what was the best dish of the night.\n\nDesserts were decent except, for me, the apple tart with salted caramel ice cream was way too salty - that is, the tart itself tasted super salty so there wasn't much contrast with the salted caramel ice cream. The chocolate mousse cake thing was chocolatey and yummy.\n\nBar-wise,these are super small pours. I had two martinis which were prepared tableside and each time the glass filled before the shaker emptied. At least leave me the shaker to replenish my too-small glass, I died a little inside when I thought of the last drops of that top shelf martini going to waste.  Crazy, extensive wine list which was way overwhelming for my ADD self so I skipped to the short by-the-glass selection and scored with a tasty Vouvray Sec.\n\nThe best part of all this was the $200 giftcard that I used to pay for our meal.

I wanted to try their burger, which I've heard great things about (and I am on my quest for the perfect hamburger).\n\nWe get there on a wed night without a reservation, to grab a seat at the bar.  We walk in the door, and I am whelmed (not over, not under) by how old-school swank it was.  Dark lighting, lots of soft fabric textures, leather, stained wood, the whole place screamed old-school class.\n\nWe wanted to sit at the bar, which was near completely empty, and they seated us promptly.  The bartender was impeccably friendly, polite, and made me a spot-on Manhattan, which I asked for with a flamed orange peel, as usual.  He was definitely respectful of his craft, and knew what he was talking about.\n\nThe service, in general, was great, but I was surprised to have my food served to me on the left at the bar, while there was plenty of space to my right.\n\nWe shared a huge day-boat scallop to start, seared well, and perfectly flavored, but it was still a little cold inside.  I definitely prefer fresh seafood undercooked to overcooked, but as far as the culinary experience, the temperature was just not right. \n\nWe both got the burger.  They said they could do a lot of things with my burger, so I tried to get it \"aussie style\" with grilled beets, onions, and a fried egg.  My awesome friend got her burger straight up, I think without cheese even, so she could get the burger flavors unadulterated.  My burger came out not quite what I wanted--aussie style has a single solid beet disk, a single disk of onion (both grilled), with a fried egg.  Meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the brioche bun... was disappointingly cold and dry.  And the meat itself was not very well seasoned (ie, no salt, needed some pepper or other flavoring).  \nOverall the burger was good, but it wasn't the simple perfection of Nopa.  \n\nFor dessert we shared their watermelon granita... which blew my mind in its awesomeness.  slightly fizzy, with a layer of sweetened creme fraiche between two layers of fresh watermelon-ice puree, this was the perfect end to the meal.  Refreshing, and satisfying that sweet tooth with the creaminess.\n\nI'd go back, but they definitely have room to improve.", "author": "Fong L."}

Since it's on the thin side, the overall effect is not overly bready. The meat is from Niman Ranch and is ground on site.

I like that they offer a reasonably affordable brunch menu so we could eat here before committing to a pricey dinner.  Based on our brunch, I wouldn't go back for dinner.   We started with an order of 8 beignets ($10).  These were fabulous, and I really liked the vanilla creme anglaise sauce that came with them (it had a very strong vanilla flavor).  There was also a blackberry jam that my husband liked.  I would have liked a chocolate sauce too but I suppose that would make it more of a dessert and less of a brunch item.   Our entrees were a disappointment, however.  My husband had the lobster benedict ($22).  He said it was ok but not great.  My french toast ($14) was not good at all.  It was very burned around the sides and bottom to the point that it was actually charred black in some places.  It also had a strong citrus (maybe orange?) flavor that was not identified on the menu.  I really hate citrus, so that pretty much made it impossible for me to enjoy the french toast.  Those issue aside, I didn't think the bread used to make the toast & the batter it was dipped in were anything to write home about.  The service was ok, but not as attentive as I expected.  I was particularly surprised that they didn't say anything about the barely half-eaten French toast on my plate - that was unusual for a restaurant of this caliber.

After that gesture, they could have served me charcoal bricks for my entr\u00e9e and I would have rated them 5 stars! Well, maybe not, but you get the point. Luckily for Spruce, my entr\u00e9e needed no artificial points booster, because it was delicious and perfectly cooked to my specifications (I ordered it medium). The steak had some herb rub on top that was just so flavorful, and the accompanying mushrooms and potatoes were perfect for soaking up the extra sauce and juices. I didn't try my husband's baby back ribs, but he said it was also delicious, and since he cleaned his plate, I'm inclined to believe him. I will say, though, that if you order the baby back ribs and are expecting the half-rack or full-rack monstrosity you get at TGIF, you'll be sorely disappointed. Their ribs entr\u00e9e size is more like half of the half-rack. So I guess that would be a quarter-rack.\n\nFor dessert, if you're like me and you love chocolate, you must, MUST, try their dark chocolate cremeux. It's hard to describe, but believe you me, you won't regret it.\n\nSo, awesome job, Spruce, and if I had any say in it, you would get 3 Michelin stars, pronto!", "author": "Meg P."}

The food was good, but not great, especially in a city like SF where great food is offered for much lower prices nearly everywhere in the city. I ordered the lobster, which had good flavor (again good, not great) but came out cold and my husband had the steak which was decent. Although the dinner was enjoyable enough, I wouldn't say it was worth the amount of money we paid, again bc it was not even in the top 10 meals I've had in the city. They also had a credit card machine issue (not their fault, obviously) that ended up double charging us so what was supposed to be a $350 for two turned into a $700 dinner for two. We're working on disputing the charge with the bank now.", "author": "Rebecca P."}

Spruce achieves what few other restaurants have been able to do in my experience:  Rather than the focus on any one thing in particular, the restuarant has a seamless quality that lends itself well to great conversation and a memorable evening.  \n\nWe were seated in the Library - a cozy glassed-in room off the foyer that features walls and ceilings of hand-applied plaster waxed to a creamy hue. I momentarily missed the dynamic atmosphere at the bar, but another time.\n\nWe started out with an amuse bouche of sweet corn and salt chowder with turmeric dates which was quite lovely; and throughout the meal, our servers appeared at just the right intervals to serve us other inspired amuse-guele from Chef  Mark Sullivan.  Delightful, but again so very complementary to the mood.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered the Sonoma Chicken and the Liberty Farms Duck. The food is simple, organic and sourced from local suppliers. The presentation of the chicken with the confit roulade, salad lyonnaise and chanterelle mushrooms was very elegant. The honey-lacquered duck was cooked to tender perfection with a crisped skin. Just gamey enough with a spicy fattiness.\n\nThe wine list is impressive and so we ordered a couple of different glasses to share and experience, and a bottle of Sol Rouge Zinfandel. Not as unctuous or \"jammy\" as this varietal can be.  You can often \"smell\" the heat.  Sol Rouge expresses nice earth, well integrated, ripe tannins and balanced acidity.", "author": "Brenda M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-02", "description": "A defense of Spruce in the light of some recent reviews:\n\n1) Spruce offers superbly luxurious seating. The tables are huge, the seats are made of proper leather and the whole interior was obviously designed. You can stretch your elbows here. Expect to pay for it.\n\n2) Waiters who work here are real people. They are actually capable of holding a conversation beyond what you're drinking and eating. Spruce is not some cheap Burmese of Thai \"bib gourmand\" where robotic waiters get less than the minimum wage. At Spruce, you are being served by a person whose professional education might well exceed yours. Expect to pay for it.\n\n3) Spruce is an extremely popular place. It has lots of people coming to the bar, large parties ordering at the same time, group bookings, etc. It's difficult and expensive to always have enough fresh ingredients for so many people. This place does not buy its noodles over the internet. It uses fresh pasta. Expect to pay for it.\n\n4) It's a 1-star Michelin restaurant. Lots of people come here under-dressed and then feel bad about it. Or they are overwhelmed by the silverware or the prices. I like In'n'Out burger too, but you can't go to Spruce before doing your homework. First eat at one or two elegant restaurants before coming here. Elegant = has a black tie dress code.\n\n5) The portions are actually large, not small. Remeber that you don't come here to have 2 courses - you come here for 5. You will pay a lot, but you'll also get a rich and long dinner.\n \nWe had a very pleasant dinner at Spruce this Friday. In fact, we were able to get a huge table just for the two of us, which made our time even more romantic.\n\nThe caviar was well chosen, as were the condiments. Our waiter Dylan had a sharing menu prepared for us and the restaurant remebered to order a bouquet of flowers for my beautiful wife.\n\nThere were also some changes I noticed since our last visit:\n- the host was not pleasant (tall male, dark hair & eyes)\n- the wine list was heavy on big brands and various vintages, instead of small producers and great vintages. \n- the couches next to the walls are still made of synthetic material, causing me to sweat all dinner.

Martinis were prepared well, but we ordered the pork and should have listened to previous reviewers who also said the meat was half fat. The waiter did warn us that this dish takes an additional 60 minutes to prepare, which we accepted in anticipation that it would be the best pork ever. However, for $80 (for 2), and we all know pork typically runs cheap, we were more than disappointed. Our waiter waits until we are finished to ask how everything was, and did not anticipate any needs during our dining experience. Overall, a huge disappointment, with long lag times between finishing our apps to clearing dishes, that we grew so impatient through the whole experience we did not even stay for dessert.

Whether it's at a bbq or fancy pants white tablecloth restaurant, if I see a burger I'm most likely going to give it a shot. I had heard many good things about the Spruce Burger so our little Sunday evening dinner club decided to stop by yesterday for burgers at the bar.\n\nFirst off, Spruce is a beautiful restaurant. Seriously, I want to move in. We arrived early and grabbed some seats in the bar area - good thing because within an hour it was pretty packed. Service was friendly and at times over the top but painfully slow. We were there well over 2 hours for burgers and a couple of drinks.\n\nNow, on to the famous Spruce Burger. I have no problem paying top dollar for a good burger (hello, Zuni!) so the $14 price tag wasn't an issue. I ordered my burger MR and it came out closer to M but I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat. I also loved the homemade pickles and pickled onions. What I didn't enjoy was the bun. It was too big, too dense, almost oily and borderline stale. That made me sad.\n\nA friend (hi Jenny!) suggested swapping out the regular fries for the duck fat fries and while decadent, they were pretty great. And this is coming from a shoestring guy who usually doesn't enjoy a thick fry.\n\nI'm glad that I checked the Spruce Burger off my list but after my burger yesterday I can honestly say that I won't be rushing back, unless they change the bun, that is!", "author": "phil h."}

And if I were a rich girl it would be my go-to spot, period.\n\nIt's my birthday . . . oh where to go?\n\nMy friend is a gluten free vegan.\nI am a gluten free Paleo\n\nThus, we are a bit tricky to cook for, or at least that's how 90% of all other restaurants in town treat us.  \n\nI let Spruce know in advance what we can/can't eat and that's when they began to roll out the red carpet.  The chef was consulted days before we even arrived and was ready for us when we did arrive.\n\nWhen we were seated at our there was a birthday card on the table for me!\n\nFirst up a gracious hello from Megan the manager.  \n\nNext up the wonderful sommelier who totally got what we both like in wine.  The wine was perfection.\n\nBecause of our dietary restrictions we told Spruce to let the chef fix us whatever.  Have fun, be creative, we're game for anything!  \n\nWe both started with the same salad.  Seasoning with salt is an art form, an art form most chefs fail at.  But not at Spruce.  You couldn't taste salt on the greens and other components in the salad, we both just knew that what ever kind of salt was used with used with a graceful hand.  It enhanced the food, it brought out the salad's lovely flavors, and not once did we actually taste salt.  Major accomplishment.  Every bit of the salad was delicious.\n\nFor entrees she had a medley of every seasonal vegetable in the house.\n\nI had duck breast with yummy roasted vegetables.  With my duck, which was juicy, not oily, and cooked to perfection, was a miniature gravy boat filled with a sauce that was almost gravy like, but nothing like Thanksgiving gravy.  I dipped each morsel of duck in it. It was so good . . .I wanted to ask for more to go!  \n\nNormally my duck dish would come with foie gras on top but I'd starve before I'd ever eat foie gras.  So they cleverly put squash blossoms on top.  A delightful surprise !  The blossoms worked perfectly well with the juices of the duck, and of course that delightful sauce/gravy.  Honestly that sauce was so good it would even make an old shoe taste good.\n\nThe service is dandy.  They don't bother you, but are attentive.  A lot of serving people scurry around very busy doing what they do so if you need something, someone is there.   It feels like the focus is on you the patron and the food, but the server.  \n\nI think the sexiest most beautiful bar in town is in Gitane - Spruce is number 2.  Their bar is chic, sexy, sophisticated and with a quiet scene.\n\nIn fact . . .quiet . .  .ah . . . no screaming kids, no loud people.  \n\nAs far as the cost we surely ate like royalty and had much wine (especially me, I'm no cheap date!) and the tab was $155.

If that is true, San Francisco's burger restaurants are severely lacking.\n\nSpruce's hamburger was good but it wasn't great.  At $16 it is pricey for a burger but not out-of-line for a high end establishment like Spruce.  My burger was seasoned well and was cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  The bun was perfectly toasted  . . . though it was a tad salty which I found strange.  The house made pickle, the pickled onion, and the slice of heirloom tomato accompanying the burger was delectable (the romaine lettuce was good but nothing special).  In all, the burger was good but it doesn't leave you saying \"wow.\"  If you order the burger expecting one of the best you've ever had in your life you'll be disappointed.  You shouldn't, however, feel ripped off.\n\nIf you're looking to be wowed, and have the spare cash in your sock, order a bottle of the Latour '82 with your burger.

The food was spectacular, but the best part about the experience was the service. We went for my birthday and were seated in the front private dining area. It was quiet and intimate with a large fireplace. The staff adjusted the temperature of the room to meet our needs, which was great. The staff was so friendly and accommodating during our entire meal. One member in our party ordered a root beer float (sort of a strange request for an upscale restaurant). We were told they couldn't do it because they don't have root beer, but ten minutes later they came back with the float and said they'd sent someone to the store. Talk about impressed! The food was spectacular. The beet salad was light and refreshing. I had the Sonoma chicken (great flavors and beautiful presentation, a little salty for my taste) and the pork loin (juicy, cooked just the right amount). Definitely save room for dessert. Their sorbets and ice creams were out of this world. You can mix and match any flavors you want and all four that we had were amazing. The beignets were fantastic as well. I'll definitely be back here!", "author": "Victoria W."}

You need be careful, if you don't pay attention the bill can add up super quickly!  First time there, we had the full on sit down wine and dinner.  Waiters are very friendly and are exceptionally knowledgeable when it comes to wine.\n\nMeal started with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef which was a tasty little delicate gruyere puff.  We wanted a bottle of Riesling but don't know too much about wines, so our wonderful waiter guided us through all the choices.  I was really impressed that the bottle he recommended for us was not only not the most expensive one, but almost the cheapest wine on the menu!  We decided on a German Riesling 2005 von Hovel.  It was fantastic, and I'd highly recommend that wine.\n\nFor our appetizers, we went with corn soup and cheese ravioli.  The soup was very creamy and delicious, as were the ravioli.  The presentation of the dishes was great too; I didn't want to touch them because I didn't want to ruin anything.  We continued with the special of the day which was a braised short rib with seared pears.  I went with the buttered Maine lobster with potato gnocchi.  Once again, both fantastic in taste and presentation.\n\nWe topped off the dinner with Coffee cake and ice cream and the strawberry short cake.  These both were probably the best desserts I've had in a long time.\n\nIn short, everything was great.  From the service to the food, presentation of the dishes to the atmosphere, we had an amazing night.  Do yourself a favor and go to Spruce, I promise you'll love it!", "author": "Timothy C."}

California cuisine is often played out in San Francisco but the innovative flavor combinations and forward thinking dishes have always hit home. \n\nThe stars are for the more recent service we received on my last two visits. On both occasions including tonight's visit the host at the restaurant was incredibly rude and borderline offensive. I dined with 4 of my friends today and although we're younger for the restaurant (late 20's early 30's) we did not expect to have our table at the first come first serve bar given away to a party that arrived AFTER us. When I questioned the host who had already promised us the table he mentioned the other group had arrived before us. When I mentioned I saw them arrive after us he said there was nothing he could do. I then saw the gentleman in the other party slip the host a bill.\n\nF*cking ridiculous for a high end restaurant to do that. I was infuriated. I stayed and ate though because the food is always great. \n\nTo management - please talk to the hosts here. They really ruin an otherwise wonderful dining experience. The service at the bar and in the dining room were and have always been excellent.\n\nIn terms of the culinary experience I rate Spruce on the same level of Danko, Frances, Aquarello, etc. In terms of front of house (hosts) it's a Hooters. A huge beat it to tonight's host. I will make sure to mention the service to anybody who ever asks about Spruce again. Wednesday, 7/13/2011.", "author": "John S."}

We have eaten at a variety of Michelin starred and un-starred restaurants in France including one that was rated the best of the year by Gault et Millau and we have never seen such mediocre service in a premium restaurant.  Spruce used to deserve its exalted status but it has deteriorated in recent years.  The food at Spruce remains excellent but the service this year was mediocre.  For example, soon after we were seated someone brought by a bread basket but no one ever returned to offer more bread and there was only one small butter tub for a table of four.  Similarly, we ordered glasses of wine while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive but surprisingly no one asked us if we wanted wine with our dinner.  And the list of service failures goes on.  At least they didn't uncork the wine in the kitchen as we experienced at Spruce a few years ago.

At first, I was more than slightly annoyed that one of my friends suggested that we hike two miles from J-town to Laurel Heights, or what I like to call the pretty part of the city that no one under 30 ventures out to.\n\nHowever, after passively crying that I had to make the journey in my cute Tory Burch flats, I was blown away by the decor of the restaurant as soon as I walked in. Tall, gorgeous, dark-wooden doors with a bar right in the middle of the room (you know that a restaurant has its priorities straight when the bar is so prominently displayed like that).\n\nThe only spiff I had with Spruce was that there were no options for their dine about town menu. Yeah, I know it's sometimes hard for restaurants to give beggers lots of options, but hey, I went to One Market for dine about town the week before and was given choices. Next year, I'm leading the revolution for choice, starting with Spruce.\n\nThe food was really phenomenal, especially their salad of \"grilled baby hearts of romaine\" with shaved parmesan. I swear, I'm not a big salads person (weighing in at about 110 pounds, I love my meat and carbs more than any other LA girl you will ever meet) . . . but this salad in particular is quite possibly the best salad I've ever had. In fact, after my meal, I wish I just had another salad. In fact, right now, I would give $20 for that salad. How you get baby hearts of romaine to be delectably charred on the outside and yet still crispy and fresh on the inside is some genius engineering. Okay, so enough raving about this amazing salad. The entree which was a veal and swiss chard caneloni was tasty . . . it just wasn't amazing. \n\nThe service here is also really good. Included in our dining experience were shots of soup and some interesting sugar-things (yes, that is a technical foodie term) for dessert.\n\nI honestly can't wait to come back here, maybe when I pass the bar or bring my car up here because no joke, this place is SO far from what you know as San Francisco.", "author": "Linna L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-18", "description": "Came here for dinner with a group of 6 people.  From the outside, it looks quaint and cottage-like.  However, the interior is spaced out nicely in a large room divided into smaller sections, the lighting is dark in a romantic/mysterious way, the bar is lit up to show off the amazing liquor selection that has a wow factor, and there are dark wood walls that are so wide and tall that you will find yourself looking at them in awe almost as if you were in Yosemite looking at a huge redwood tree.  There is also a large piece of glass that divides the bar section from the dining section.  Very classy combined with the dark lighting and dark wood.  \n\nSomething important to note from the start is that the burger can be ordered for dinner, but it is NOT ON THE MENU.  This is a hush-hush fact about Spruce.  It's sort of like being able to order animal style at In-n-Out.  It's not on the menu, but everyone knows you can.  The burger is sensational.  To give you an example of how sensational it is, out of my group of 6 people, 50% got the burger.  100% of that 50% said it was the \"best burger I have ever had.\"  And my group is a well cultured and traveled group.  We are not hermits.  \n\nStarting off the meal, we ordered 2 each of the following appetizers:  \n\n1. Lettuces and Herbs with Banyuls vinegar and green olive crostone \n2. Foraged nettle and green garlic agnolotti with walnuts and mint nage\n3. Seared dayboat scallops with endive and citrus and fennel nage \n\nAll 3 were extremely delicious and omg the scallops were grilled to perfection.  The detail that went into each of these dishes was noticed and appreciated, and you could taste every flavor of every ingredient.  I mean, we didn't even know what half of the ingredients were, but we didn't care.  It tasted GOOD.  \n\nAs I stated above, entrees consisted of 3 burgers.  As for the other 3, we ordered 2 of the Ras El Hanout Crusted Tuna with umbrian lentils, artichokes, and preserved lemon, and then 1 of the Alaskan Cod Persillade with caramelized cauliflower, black trumpet mushrooms, and red win gastrique.  The tuna was a bit too crusted with spice and salt for my liking, but it was cooked to perfection.  \n\nThe burgers come with fries that are fried in duck oil.  They were good, but not as good as I had expected them to be.  Call me a cheap date, but I still like the fries at McDonalds.  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered:\n\n1. Beignets with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise (essentially mini donuts that you can dip in sauce....I still prefer Bob's donuts)\n2. Dark chocolate fude with butterscotch, malted chocolate ice cream, and smoke almond tuile (super rich and super yummy)\n3. Coffee hazelnut mousse cake with maple cinnamon gastrique and hazelnut praline (light and fluffy....delicious but didn't steal my heart away).  \n\nOverall, a really nice dining experience with lovely ambiance, excellent service, and classy decor.  I highly recommend this as a date spot, place to celebrate someone's birthday, etc.  The crowd here is refined and older.  Definitely not the place to bring your children or wear your jeans.

Left me very full but not overwhelming. For dessert, you must get the beignet, the chocolate peanut butter bar (omg anything with chocolate and peanut butter would taste good!), and the strawberry tart.

It was quiet, but the server was very attentive.\n\nFood:\n- Complimentary bread: Comes with butter and honey butter. \n- White Corn Soup: I love corn creamy soup. This tasted like what I expected, but there were some crunchy (grain?) bits in one region of the soup that were surprisingly good.\n- Goat Cheese and Lettuce: Good, but it tasted like a standard salad. The goat cheese tasted very nice, but I say that about every goat cheese I've ever tried.\n- Duck: Really tender and tasted a bit like steak (according to my boyfriend). We got melted foie gras on it.\n- Bavare Steak: I had anticipated more like a large rib-eye steak (not familiar with Bavare), but it came out with 5 chunks and a more modest portion. That being said, I was completely stuffed after the meal and the meat was very juicy.\n- Beignets: So good.

We ended up at Spruce, because they have the \"best\" burger in town.  My cousin said it was great.\n\nThe fries were AMAZING.  I could have just gone here and had a beer and fries and been happy.  But really...\n\nHusband failed to tell me just how FANCY this place was.  And I was wearing jeans, and feeling wholly uncomfortable with that fact.  I was sitting next to women in (hopefully faux) fur, and diamonds.  There I am in scuffed boots and jeans.  Ugh!  Not Spruces fault (mind you).  My cousin was just wearing a tee-shirt because we took him straight to dinner after he landed.  Oh well, I couldn't help but feel that the waiters were laughing at us.  What do I care?  I'm moving next month anyways.  But it did dampen a rather some great fries.\n\nThe sommelier brought out our beer and served it just like it was wine.  I'm sorry, I have had my share of top restaurants, Alex in Vegas comes to mind, but I have never felt as pretentious as I did at Spruce.  Really?  Put our beer on ice?  Like it's champagne?

I've heard a lot about the burger, but never been able to try it.\n\nThe burger, at its simplest, includes a bun, patty, choice of cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato and side of fries. A variety of add-ons are available including bacon, a fried egg, mushrooms, caramelized onions and even foie gras.\n\nI first noticed the bun. It was relatively thinner and denser than what's normally seen, with a well-toasted texture...I think it was pretty much like an English Muffin. The meat (Niman Ranch chuck) was cooked a nice medium rare and oozed fat and juices when squeezed. The meat was tasty and the bun did a good job of soaking up the juices. I opted to add on bacon and caramelized onions; I'd have to say both of these were very good and added a lot of flavor. It all came together really nicely; easily one of the better burgers I've had in some time. At $16, it's not the cheapest of burgers, but the quality is apparent. It's a relatively simple burger, but the execution is key. I think each of the components were tasty on their own, but really came together to pack a load of flavor.\n\nThe fries (which came with the burger) were quite good as well, with a delightful crunch on the outside and fluffy potato on the inside.\n\nThere's a whole rest of the menu that I haven't tried yet, but if this burger is any indication, I expect it to be well-executed, carefully crafted and probably pretty tasty. The burger alone, though, is enough reason for a return visit.", "author": "Darin L."}

Solid food in an impressive ambiance with a mind boggling wine list.  Innovation on the menu in the form of unique cuts and preparation.  Though was a little disappointed that my ice wine was warm instead of chilled.\n\nGoug\u00e8res: A strange choice for a complimentary amuse bouche since large baskets of these can sometimes be found as brunch accompaniments elsewhere.  Tasty nonetheless, cheesy/chewy/airy.  \n\nPig Ear Terrine: Now I know why the dogs love pig ear!  Thin like a prosciutto slice, but with much more texture complexity.  Meaty in parts, fatty in other parts of course and a very cool gelatinous marbleized texture throughout.  The taste was like typical unspiced charcuterie, so texture exploration is the main reason to try this. \n\nPastrami Sandwich: Since we were at the bar, figured we'd actually get an exclusive bar item.  They make this in house and it's better than 95% of the pastrami out there!  Tender and spicy.  Have had better at Tommy's Joynt, but that's about it on this coast.  The Russian dressing it was served with wasn't that exciting though.\n\nBavette: Thin slices of medium rare chewy meaty beefy goodness.  Great marinade/sauce going on, completely savory.  Great example of an inexpensive cut dressed up fancy (though not so inexpensive here).\n\nDuck Fat Potatoes: These really are all that.  Slow cooked in duck fat for hours before being cooled then deep fried.  I could definitely taste the yummy fat of those spiteful fowls throughout.  More like large, extremely tasty fries than any other form of tater.\n\nFrench Fries: Sadly not as exciting as the duck fat potatoes.  Tasted like the fries absorbed too much oil (in a bad way, since it's not duck fat), probably not cooked fast enough.\n\nBeignets: Broiche based, so extremely airy and light.  The grainy sugar was a bit too much for me as I would have preferred the subtler powdered sugar.  The dark chocolate sauce with lemon and orange citrus peel was nice, but the cr\u00e8me anglaise was better because it added a sweet creamy contrast that worked perfectly.", "author": "Adam B."}

Between two, we ordered the Foie Gras Hot & Cold, the Duck, the Bavette Steak, the Beignettes, some alcohol, and we loved every bite from every dish. \n\nThe Foie Gras appetizer came two ways. One piece was seared to buttery perfection and the other was creamed into a savory spread. It came with a yummy waffle and various mild acids like reductions and berries, and I felt seriously guilty for enjoying it so much. \n\nThe duck was one of the best I've ever had, cooked to tender perfection with an exquisitely crunchy outer layer of skin. The Bavette steak was also tender, juicy, with great meaty flavors. Both came with very nicely paired sides that improve your palate with each bite. \n\nThe beignettes were also delicious. Think huge, fancy donut holes fried to a perfect fluff, with two decadent sauces; chocolate and creme anglaise. My date preferred the chocolate and I liked the creme anglaise, so we each commandeered our favorite and savored every last drop as we wrapped up a very satisfying meal.\n\nOur waiter and servers were also great, not very chatty and available to help when you need them. \n\nMy only complaints are that 1) it seems reservations on opentable.com are restricted to before 6 and after 9 and 2) a hostess who checked us in on one occasion wasn't very nice.", "author": "Sherry L."}

A bottle of merlot (VERY extensive wine selection, the wine list was like reading a novel), burrata appetizer, harvest salad (beets and chicories - light, refreshing), fries, monkfish entree (the broth and the peas were delicious), pork entree (pork in 3 ways - belly, cheek, and tenderloin), and chocolate cake dessert with banana ice cream came out to about $200.  We also had a cheesy bread ball in the beginning, delicious cauliflower soup served in a mini cup while we waited for our entrees, and mini chocolate \"brownie\" bites at the end.

It's not that it was bland, but it had NO flavor at all.\" We put salt & pepper on it, and even that only brought it to a \"bland\" level.

A couple of days later, an 8pm reservation popped up, and we quickly snatched it. Fate? I think so.\n\nFirst off, I love the location of the restaurant. It's hidden by trees and nestled in between homes and tiny boutiques in Laurel Heights, but once you find it, you're welcomed in by huge gates and double doors into a restaurant that makes you do a double take as to where you just were. Kind of like Narnia. I wouldn't call it a 'neighborhood gem' as the place is extremely popular, but the location of it makes it feel like you're getting away for a nice meal.\n\nThe restaurant itself is well designed, the seats and booths are extremely comfortable (I could fall asleep there), and the lighting was dim, but not so dim that you couldn't see your food. And I love seeing my food.\n\nEveryone here says it but it's worth repeating: Service is great. The waiters are fantastic (he even gave us some free treats when we passed up on dessert and gave me another drink on the house when I managed to clumsily tip mine over) and quick to clean your table without being incessant.\n\nNow, let's get to the food. We started off with the young lettuce salad with goat cheese. The cheese was nice and warm and paired well with the salad. Next, we had the foie gras torchon. I cherished every bite I had as I'll have to say goodbye to this dear friend come July. One of the best foie gras I've had at any restaurant. For our main course, I got the duck breast, and my girlfriend got the suckling pig. The duck was cooked very well and tasted amazing. The pig dish was essentially pork belly, porchetta, and another piece that I forget but might have been the tastiest one. And the portions are generous.\n\nThe wine list is massive and they make their cocktails very well. I would trust them to make my old fashioned, and I don't say that about a lot of restaurants.

From the front entrance to the dimly-lit ambiance inside, everything is beautiful and breathtaking in a very sophisticated but quaint way. While one reviewer felt the tables were awkwardly oversized, I loved how they were large enough to fit our food and drinks without anything hanging halfway off the table. The service was warm, efficient and perfectly executed from beginning to end. And the food! I had to constrain myself from doing a little orgasmic dance in my chair because it was THAT good. \n\nUnlike most restaurants that give you a bread basket upon being seated, Spruce has a guy walking around placing single pieces of bread on people's bread plates. At first I thought, how stingy! But upon finishing my slice, he magically appeared again offering more. We also received two small complimentary balls of warm gruyere-infused bread. Yum!\n\nBeing foie gras freaks, we had to order the hot and cold foie gras plate, which made us realize we don't like cold foie gras very much. Needless to say, both of us were fighting for the delicious seared piece. We also chose the \"Taste of Each American\" cheese sampler, which comes with five different varieties complemented by quince butter, honey and something else that I can't recall and plenty of bread. My favorites were the cow and goat (grayson and midnight moon?), and filled up on the stuff before our entrees even arrived.\n\nTo continue the foie gras theme, I ordered the Honey Lacquered Duck Breast with foie gras for my main course while my friend chose the Buttered Maine Lobster. He was enjoying his juicy de-shelled lobster chunks and perfectly cooked giant gnocchi pieces until he tasted my entree. The duck had the most amazing flavor combination - citrusy-sweet honey and orange sauce combined with savory duck topped off with a generous piece of seared foie gras. Just by looking at the duck, you would probably never be able to guess the skin is slightly crispy when you chew it. Paired with the lean duck meat and cinnamon spiced fatty foie gras, my taste buds climaxed uncontrollably with every bite. \"More! More!\" they screamed. \"Don't stop! MORE!\"\n\nTo finish off the meal, we decided on the beignets, which are like fancy donut holes. While tasty, they did not have the WOW factor like the other dishes we tried. The creme anglaise was delicious for dipping and complemented the beignets perfectly, while the preserves were mouth-puckering sour. Overall unexciting. We were also given complimentary petite fours, which came with this little tasty dome-shaped confection and again, an overly sour fruity strip, but it was free so I'm not going to complain.\n\nThe reason why Spruce is perfect for special occasions and curing dry spells is because of the staff's meticulous attention to details. Armed with the knowledge that I was treating my friend to an early birthday dinner, the restaurant had a birthday card with a picture of a doggy waiting for us at our table. The prices are also reasonable - around $145 pre-tip for our two appetizers, two entrees and dessert.\n\nBecause parking is such a huge source of frustration in this city, it's helpful to know Spruce has valet. However, street parking in this area is so plentiful that I suggest you save yourself $12 and park your own car.\n\nLet Spruce help you get laid...NOW!", "author": "Suany W."}

I just couldn't get over the texture on my lips every time I took a bite.  Overall, I'd say this is a damn fine burger, but not quite as good as the one at Nopa or would you get at Umami.\n\nMy wine was a pinot noir from the Willamette Valley, which was way overpriced and not very good, especially for the Willamette Valley.  The wine list is vast, but the prices will make the difference between a moderately expensive meal and a very expensive one.  Choose wisely.", "author": "Lester B."}

The menu is simple but classy. You don't get the expected bread basket-- instead a server comes and serves it to you! Honey with butter is a win! Also, thanks to fellow yelpers, I ordered the duck.

Some were certainly better than others, but overall I think the quality was great. The pork 3 ways was great, duck with shaved/melted foie (no more) very tasty, and of course the Spruce burger and short rib were good options. The lobster was surprisingly just OK, the accompaniments were somewhat odd - a bed of chopped lettuce, celery, other veggies. \n\nService: 5/5 - Even though we were a group of 5, and well under the average age of other diners, we were treated very well. The wait staff was surprisingly casual and down to earth, even though it looks and feels super upscale. They even seemed to know when we wanted more bread, which they brought without them/us asking us if we wanted more!\n\nAmbiance: 5/5 - Very chic, upscale, and absolutely a date worthy spot. Dim and not noisy at all, but it was still ok for a group of us 5 to be lively without getting dirty looks. \n\nValue: 3/5 - If I had to compare the food to other top notch SF spots, I'd say that the food was certainly one of the better spots, but given that entrees are well into the ~$30s-40, and small plates easily into the ~$20s, this isn't exactly a high value spot.", "author": "Kevin T."}

In November of last year, we dined at Spruce and were awed by \"the Spruce experience.\"   Tonight did not disappoint.\n\nWe occupied a four-top.  Before we even ordered our salads, a teaser of carrot soup and mini goug\u00e8res stuffed with Gruy\u00e8re cheese unexpectedly arrived.  Wow!  The carrot soup deserves some other name, like a French name -- it was so somptueux!!!\n\nThree at the table ordered the salad with the Banyuls vinegar and green olive crostone.  I ordered the beet and tangerine salad with cheese and crostone, sprinkled with hazelnuts.  Everyone was jealous of my salad.  The razor thin slices of beet were perfectly pickled, the tangerines euphoric!\n\nFor our entrees, the orders were as unique as the dialects spoken in the United Nations.  Our orders included:  Grilled Yellowtail with artichoke hearts and harvest greens in a sauce vierge.  Charred berkshire pork tenderloin with crispy pork belly and shelling beans.  Flank steak, medium rare, mounded atop chard with duck fat fried polenta.  Rabbit in three preparations, chantenay carrots (a sweet carrot mousse) served over umbrian lentils.\n\nSo varied were our orders, that we asked Rachel, the sommelier, to recommend a wine in the \"Under $60\" category.  She recommended a 2006 French Bourgogne (French White Burgundy)  under the  Domaine Fourrier label.  Her words used to describe the wine, I believe, were \"a curvaceous woman with full-body accents and a delicate hint of spice,\" or something like that.  It definitely hit the spot!\n\nI had the rabbit.  As a child, I remember hunting rabbit on Thanksgiving morning and then eating it served in a heavy gravy.  This was anything but ... the rabbit had a slight \"wild\" tinge, but was delicate, firm and sweet.  The best rabbit I've had!\n\nDuring dinner, complimentary servings of french fries, fried in duck-fat arrived with a divine dipping sauce.  Crunchy on the outside, hot and firm on the inside -- you have to experience it to understand it!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered de-caf coffee.  Our friends couldn't believe it wasn't regular.  The coffee is full-bodied, with the perfect balance of taste.  Wonderful!\n\nWe had the honey olive oil cake with caramalized apples and chestnut ice cream, freshly made double chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal and apricot cookies and peanut butter cookies, as well as beignets with araguani chocolate sauce and creme anglaise dipping sauces.\n\nI don't think I'll be able to eat until Wednesday!", "author": "David C."}

This is the first time I've written a restaurant review and feel I have to because there was such a huge gap between the hype and expectation of excellence and the reality we experienced. Everyone kept telling us how lucky we were to get a reservation on a Saturday night, so we went here instead of our other favorite restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. When we were seated it took the wait staff 10 minutes to simply bring us menus, wine list and water. Once they did, there was no apology or acknowledgement. In fact we had to ask again for a wine and cocktail menu because it wasn't brought out. There was a spotlight shining directly in our eyes and we had to ask two people to turn it down. When my husband's martini was delivered it was shaken with the most ostentatious display of wrist swirling that we had to refrain from laughing out loud. The server then spilled the martini in the process, dripping it down his wrist and all over the table. It was like a parody of a snooty restaurant on SNL!  The grilled jewel vegetable salad had a delicious avocado dressing (the best part of the entire meal), but grilled romain lettuce? It was just plain soggy. I had to look at it closely to make sure it was actually lettuce. It made no sense and was underwhelming for $16. I ordered the $42 mushroom carbonara which arrived cooler than Luke warm. I took one bite and had to send it back. I was given a free second glass of wine while waiting which was a nice gesture. In the end the dish was just okay, but way too heavily salted, and I like salt, but it was almost too salty to eat. I ate a few bites at best and took the rest home. The waiter was pleasant, but so soft spoken we had such a hard time hearing him all night and had to keep saying, \"Pardon me?\", awkwardly all evening.  He never asked if we enjoyed the meal or if we were celebrating something special. We felt like an afterthought on what was in fact a very special night for us. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I think their best feature may be the bar. If you go, just sit in the bar and order a burger from the bar menu. My husband ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was great, priced reasonably and on our way out the people in the bar area were having much more fun than those of us in the stuffy restaurant! So disappointed.\n\nUpdate to previous review:  I must add that I received a truly sincere phone call from Spruce today in response to my review. Their customer service manager went out of her way to offer us an apology and compensation for our experience. It was a truly gracious gesture and confirmed my hunch that Spruce may have just been having an off night. The way Spruce handled this situation definitely indicates that they care deeply about their clients' dining experience. Their graciousness is greatly appreciated.", "author": "K T."}

The dark brown wooden walls and dimmed lights were creating a super sexy scene. This place makes for a great dating atmosphere.\n\nFor appetizers, we had Seared Foie Gras, Seared Sweetbreads, and Charcuterie Selection. Seared Foie Gras was superb. It was moist, rich, and absolutely delicious. Seared sweetbreads got mixed reviews. Personally, I liked it but didn't think it was outstanding (it is definitely worth trying). Others found sweetbreads to be blend and tough to chew. Charcuterie Selection was good but also not outstanding. It had a good variety of meats but that was about it. It definitely helped that we were having wine.\n\nAs for main course, most of us had Grilled Bavette Steak. Here, we found inconsistencies. Personally, my steak came out perfectly. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. When I tasted my friends', one was too salty, one was overcooked, and another had a bitter aftertaste. But since my steak came out perfectly, I will give this place 4 stars.\n\nFor the price they charge, we were disappointed and I do not know if I will be back.

Ambiance is really great, nice decor as well.  Only complaint is that it might be a tad too dark.  Started with a few appetizers from the lounge menu:  Caesar Salad was great, dressing had a great lemony flavor.  Mussels were so good I was literally eating the broth with the spoon.  Charcuterie was pretty good as well.  I wish they provided a little more bread with both of the appetizers as it got a little hunger-games over who was going to take the last piece with both.  For the entrees, two of us ordered the burger, one had the pork tenderloin and the last ordered the steak.  The burger was delicious, the bun was really great and the beef was cooked perfectly.  Fries were crispy and hot.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes cooked in duck fat were amazing.  My friend said the pork was nothing to write home about.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-06", "description": "Spruce is hands down the best contemporary American restaurant in San Francisco right now. My aunt took me there last March for my going-away dinner, and being that we're foodies and Spruce is from the same gastro-geniuses who created Pizza Antica (our favorite restaurant in Marin), our expectations were high. \n\nBuilt in a historic 1930s auto barn, this well-thought-out space exemplifies dark, contemporary sophistication. The dining room is separated from the sleek bar area by a wall of glass panels and has an industrial feel with cathedral-high ceilings, steel trusses and track lighting. In the late afternoon, light streams into the dining room through the skylights and illuminates the tan faux-ostrich leather chairs and the Kazuo Shiraga paintings mounted on the chocolate brown mohair walls.\n\nOne of the selling points of this restaurant is the dishes are prepared with organic produce from local, sustainable farms. My aunt and I shared all of our dishes - the golden potato gnocchi with asparagus and black trumpet mushrooms, the seared veal sweetbreads with farm egg raviolono, the grilled bavette steak with bordelaise sauce and duck-fat potatoes, the honey lacquered duck breast with foie gras, and the warm semolina cake with raspberries, honey, mint and Straus frozen cream. Every dish was impressive, expertly prepared and presented, and extremely satisfying to the palate and the stomach.  \n\nAs for drinks, their specialty cocktails are outstanding and inventive. I had the Bitterberry Bramble (with vodka, lemon, raspberry and bitterlemon soda) and the Honey Elderflower Daquiri (with rum, St. Germain, honeywater and lime). Spruce's wine list is epic, covering over 1,200 labels. My aunt and I shared a half carafe of Pinot Noir (forgot the label), which my aunt said is one of the best pinots she's had in her lifetime and this lady has been around for 75 years!\n\nAs for service, our waitress was approachable, attentive and well acquainted with the menu and made great recommendations for food and drinks.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is there is a month-long wait for prime-time reservations at Spruce. We were able to make a reservation a week prior to our visit, however, we had to dine there on a Monday night at 5pm.   \n\nSpruce exceeded our expectations in food, service and decor, and my aunt and I left the restaurant feeling like we had a great night out. At the end of the evening, you really can't ask for much more from a restaurant.", "author": "Lara H."}

I've gotten lazy with the reviews, but I visited this fine establishment this evening with a wonderful friend to catch up over dinner and right when I walk into this beautiful restaurant I was taken back by the simple yet sensual decor and relaxed ambiance. There an amazing openess and cozy feeling to this hidden treasure, the large sky light brought in a natural element of lighting while down below in the restaurant was a quaint and very chic dinning area, spacious so that one may dine with their company comfortably. We were warmly greeted by all the host & hostess as well as staff as we were taken to our comfy seats in the bar area. \n\nOur server was absolutely gorgeous and so very sweet, accommodating and made many suggestions for our drink and dining experience. We started with a round of drinks and my friend ordered the VIOLET BEAUREGARDE which was so elegantly made and real beauty to look at, the aesthetics and taste combined to create a wonderful drink. I had the Pharaoh's Gold and it was so refreshingly delicious! \n\nWe started dinner with a light and beautiful medley which was the MARKET CHERRIES AND BURRATA this was to die for and really opened one's taste buds to a new experience. \n\nFollowing our Market Cherries & Burrata was the POINT REYES CLAM BOUILLON, again beautifully prepared and the Bouillon was so aromatic, the clams were sweet and chorizo was cooked to perfection. We were given a special treat of Cheesy Puffy along with a Lardo Fig, the fig and lardo complemented one another with a sweet and salty combination which melted in one's mouth. \n\nEverything was wonderfully synced and there was proper time to enjoy each dish. As our main course arrived, both my friend and I stared in awe at the deliciousness that bestowed us. We ordered the Coriander Roasted Chicken and the Grilled Bavette Steak, the chicken was cooked to perfection and so full of flavor and tenderly moist. The steak was amazing so juicy and tender, it literally melted in your mouth- paired with freshly made duck fat potatoes and a bordelaise drizzle. Both dishes picked were beyond description in taste, all the ingredients were so very fresh and one can tell a lot of love and attention was put into making each individual dish. \n\nSaving room for dessert we ordered the decadent DARK CHOCOLATE FUDGE & APRICOT ALMOND FINANCIER.  THE DESSERTS WERE EXTRAVAGANT and perfect to end the evening. The honey ice cream that accompanied the Apricot Almond Financier was superb and the fudge was the perfect amount of chocolatey goodness. To finish the wonderful evening a in house made candy treat of green apple sour gummy and butterscotch caramel accompanied our bill. \n\nThe dining experience was beyond my expectations. The restaurant is gorgeous and the staff are so welcoming and filled with warm smiles. Definitely will be returning and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an out of this world experience in dining.", "author": "Shirley M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-09", "description": "Strictly for the Bar Menu:\n\nEveryone has their own personal search for \"the best\"... On my current list, it happens to be the best Burger.  Although Spruce is more on the fancier side, you wouldn't think that their burger would be that unbelievable for a reasonable $14 with fries.  \n\nI don't know where to begin, is it the near perfect seasoning of the medium rare meat, or the what seems to be the deep fried bun that retains its softness while being crunchy on the outside, or is it the condiments of pickles, pickled onions and aioli?  Most burgers lose their juiciness or tend to dry out after a few bites as the juices pour out, but not this one!\n\nFrom the first bite, you get suck into a meat lovers trance and you start to think, \"Where have you been my whole life?\"  As you slowing continue on eating the burger, its like a fun roller coaster ride nearing it's last loop- you'll hate the fact that the party is almost over.  \n\nAccompanying the burger, Spruce might also have one of the best fries in San Francisco.  To have the fries as moist as they are, Spruce must have soaked their potatoes for a day or two before tossing them into the fryer for a combination of moist and crunchy goodness.  You can't go wrong with any of their desserts, especially the gianormous chocolate chip cookies.  \n\nOn a nice warm day, go to the bar, order yourself a burger(remeber it comes with fries) and get yourself a cipriani (a brazilian mojito/margarita) then you'll realize, \"Life is Good!\"", "author": "Jason A."}

I read a small summary and then a few blogger posts and realized that place had actually yet to open. So I made my reservations for Spruce's third day being open.\n\nThe space itself is gorgeous, dark wood interior, modern charcoal art, sleek bar, wine racks and of course well dressed servers, who are uniformed in white shirts/black vests with the floor managers\nsporting full suits. There's a small lounge area with a fireplace up front, while across the hall is the \"cafe\" that you can stop in for a quick bite or more casual experience. We were seated fairly deep into the\nrestaurant where we have a view of the whole dining room, a small semi private large party table,  and part of the bar which was separated by a high wall. \n\nSince we were looking to catch a show that night, we were there earlier than our usual dining time, and only a few parties were in the main dining room. Surely enough as the night went on the room filled up completely.\n\nWe we started off with an amouse bouche of pureed white beans on a crostini topped with a cherry tomato, and of course a wonderful roll of bread and softened butter. They have a separate menu for their charcuterie and cheese,  so chose appetizers off that consisting of the coppa and smoked chorizo, accompanied by figs, sweet onion/peppers and toast. These were more like small samplings than a huge charcuterie plate, so you can choose many without getting too full for your main entrees. \n\nFor our main courses we went for the Mint-Harvest Greens Ravioli (entree size) and Maine Lobster with Yukon Potato Gnocchi. Both were excellent, especially the sauces they came in. I could have had just the bread with the butter sauce the lobster came with and made a meal out of that. For desserts we went for the Chocolate Fondant and the Semolina Cake. The fondant came with bits of chocolate cookie embedded in it and was accompanied by a white chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream. The Semolina Cake came in little squares with very plump blackberries, mint, and cubes of frozen Strauss cream. I liked the fact that neither dessert was too sweet and were fairly well balanced.\n\nSpruce has an extensive wine list but we leaned towards cocktails from the bar menu instead. We had two rounds of the Sidecar and \"Between the Sheets\".  With your cocktails, they are shaken at your table so you get a bit of performance with each drink. I think when I return next the wine list will definitely get the thorough look over.\n\nThe service was fairly impeccable as you'd expect for an establishment such as this. We felt our waiter might have been a bit nervous and since we were there early, a sense of being watched never left our minds. Since it was their weekend Grand Opening you could feel everyone was on edge to make sure everything was going to turn out right. Hopefully after a month or so, they'll ease into it and get the more comfortable service of a Gray Danko.\n\nSpeaking of Gary Danko, it's definitely in that price range. The menu is more focused but you can expect the entree sizes and the pricing to be comparable. They're off to a good start and I expect this place to be a hit as long as they can maintain and refine their opening weekend status quo.", "author": "Kim N."}

It's good, but not anything special for a sweeter champagne drink. Liked my Remember the Maine, very Sazerac-like.\n\nBest drink we had was the Serrated Edge, which was pretty fantastic, full of rich character and well balanced. I could drink those all night.\n\nWine list is fantastic, but very pricey. They do have a section of \"Under $80\" but even with the $35 corkage, I'd advise bringing a bottle if you have something nice. Also, they let me open bottles that were not exactly those on the wine list but were very similar without any fuss (i.e. a different year). That's nice.\n\nFood:  the food was very good -- perfectly cooked, well crafted, well balanced. For example, my short rib was perfectly balanced and not so rich that I couldn't eat it all like many short ribs (where many chefs seem to view it as a contest to see who can make it richest).\n\nI had the scallops as well -- and the same thing. Wonderfully complementary flavors that showcase the actual food. \n\nOther folks had the salmon and the corn ravioli, and the feedback was the same:  fresh, showcase the food. But I'd say it was lacking something -- none of us raved the way we normally do at Chez Panisse or Gary Danko. It's the only thing that kept it from a five star for me. I kinda wish I had gotten a burger.\n\nService:  Impeccable. We arrived early and waited at the bar. it got a bit crowded so we migrated to the back and a waiter found us, took drink orders and the host found us for our table easily, etc., Just everything was accounted for.\n\nAdded bonus:  the walls had fabric on them -- what could have been annoying loud wasn't, but you still didn't hear the nearby tables.", "author": "Alan G."}

It has a monumental entry, two-story high ceilings, expensive-looking comfortable chairs, waiters in suits and white tablecloths. \n\nUnfortunately, the food and service don't live up to appearances. \n\nWe went there for lunch, my dining companion and I, expecting if not excellence, at least something very nice. \n\nThe waiter was immediately a problem. \"Still or sparkling water?\" he asked. Since a number of places around town make their own sparkling water from filtered tap water (Starbelly, for instance) I asked if the sparkling water was house-made. \"Sparkling!\" he said, walking away. Wait, I asked, is it made here or bottled? \"Oh it's bottled from Italy\". Still, please. I also ordered an iced tea, and had to ask for it three times before it was brought. \n\nWhile we waited to place our food orders, we were brought a couple of really excellent rolls. They were warm, chewy, tasty and came with a good little pot of butter. Then it was time to order,. \n\nI was interested in the bavette steak, but I prefer grass-fed beef. I asked what the source of the meat was. The waiter said, I kid you not, \"From a cow\". No, I mean is it grass-fed, grain-fed, organic or conventional? \"Grass\" he said curtly. I ordered it Medium: pink, not red. My dining partner ordered the Waldorf chicken salad. \n\nWhen the steak came, it was bloody. And this was obvious because it arrived sliced. Had it been in one piece, the rawness could have been due to lack of skill, but since it was sliced, serving it to me that way when I'd asked for Medium was just negligence. I sent it back for a re-fire. Rather than give me a new correctly-fired steak, they put the slices in a frying pan and cooked them a bit. They were tough and chewy. Not what I had hoped for. The garnish - vegetables and potatoes dauphin - were quite tasty though. \n\nThe Waldorf salad wasn't. Waldorf salads are dressed either with mayonnaise or flavored mayonnaise, or yogurt. Not a vinegary, poorly mixed blue cheese dressing. The chicken was served on the side, and was a bland, poached breast. \n\nWe skipped dessert and left, over an hour later, unsatisfied. At Spruce we experienced a sloppy kitchen and slow, unhelpful service. \n\nIt seems they are trading on their location, setting and furniture, not on the quality of their food or service.", "author": "Jacob L."}

No big deal, I s'pose. \n\nBut then our lunches - we both had albacore nicoise - were meh. Two big slabs of barely seared, almost completely raw tuna on a plate full of traditional nicoise ingredients. I don't want to do that much heavy lifting, i.e. knife and fork work, when I order a salad. Many (most?) restaurants prepare the tuna in slender slices. Makes the raw factor far more palatable.

My co-workers and I  had been seriously looking forward to the day we'd be able to dine at this highly recommended place. We were quite lucky to seat 8 of us on a Thursday night, but I can definitely see how it can be tricky otherwise. \n\nMy first impression was that the ambiance was a tad bit stuffy. I didn't realize it was definitely a white-table cloth, formal, large space type of establishment. The service was great however, and took quite a bit attention to detail as we were being served. \n\nRegardless, our team had one thing in mind: to try their infamous beignets, but we'll get back to that. \n\nAnyway, here's the breakdown: \n\nThe wine list was fantastic, so if you're a vino-lover, this is definitely your place.\n\nThe complimentary bread choices and butter were DELICIOUS. They served either a fresh dinner roll or a cranberry bread, along with homemade salted butter and butter with persimmon. Creative and tastey.\n\nYoung Escarole Salad: Very tastey! The escarole is a winter green, so it had a uniquely bitter taste. However, against the buttermilk sauce the flavors were brought out even more. The black pepper biscotti was my favorite - so flakey and delicate with hints of black pepper. The grapes were a little random for me. . . \n\nPan Roasted Dorade: Mediterranean white fish, flakey like sea bass, but so much meat. The oven roasted tomatoes and kale were delicious! the Tagliarini pasta was deliciously buttery and moist, tasted pretty good when mixed with the kale. \n\nBeignets: Hmm, definitely had better. Pretty standard. However, the white creme was delicious when dipped in the chocolate sauce. But really nothing too special. More like a donut hole. 8 in one plate made it easy to share\n\nSnickerdoodle cookie: Very tastey! Unfortunately they ran out of chocolate chip cookies (which is what they are famous for), but snickerdoodle was aweeesome. Esp dipped in the whip cream :) \n\nHere's what the co-workers enjoyed: Autumn harvest vegetables with shaved pecarino, bay scallops, grilled yellowtail (quite interesting, was rare in the middle and grilled on the outside\n\nSecret off the menu delicacy: Spruce Burger.

Had a reservation but since our party didn't arrive yet we had a couple drinks at the bar. Table was ready once the party arrived so that was great. \n\nOrdered the scallops as an appetizer, the portion was incredibly small considering it was $18. Shared a plate of Charcuterie Selection which was pretty good since I've never had it before. It went very well with wine. \n\nMy main course was the steak. I liked how it was cooked just the way i like it. Medium-Rare with a little bit of blood. mmm.. The duck fat potatoes were good as well. I had to save my fries as the juice from the steak started creeping over to my fries. I do NOT like soggy fries.\n\nAfter that had the Beignets, which tasted pretty soft and was warm so that made it so much better dipping it in the chocolate.\n\nThis place is definitely good, but I don't think it's worth the price.

We were escorted to a very nice table against the wall.  A waiter promptly arrived and told us of the special offerings, off menu, for the night.  He kindly indicated the cost of each item, often neglected in restaurants and a cause for surprise when the bill arrives.  We had very acceptable cocktails and placed our orders for starters and main dishes.  The appetizers included \"Watsonville heirloom tomatoes\", warm burrata cheese and salad.  All were tasty, though not exceptional in any regard.  The grilled \"local albacore tuna was a rather meager offering in size, but was reportedly very tasty.  The roasted Sonoma chicken was half of a small chicken, nicely presented but largely bereft of any distinct taste, though moist in side.  My wife made a main dish of the \"Hudson Valley foie gras\", which she felt was tasty but not up to recent offerings of the like dish in some other restaurants.  However, it was a pleasure to have this on the menu following the ban on foie gras in California that was fortunately lifted recently.  As for the choice of wines, this is where Spruce decidedly fails to offer value alternatives.  One must search for a decent bottle of pinot noir.  We asked for the sommelier, but were told he was \"very busy\" and never materialized.  We settled for a somewhat pedestrian Willamette Valley pinot for $110, one of the least expensive pinots on the list.  The best dish of the night was the steelhead trout which was greatly appreciated.  It did compete mightily for that award with the delicious beignets that were shared for desert.  Service was impeccable, save the wine selection difficulty.  I will agree with friends who rate Spruce as a very good, \"special occasion\" restaurant, though overpriced relative to the quality of the food, not the service.", "author": "Robert P."}

The fiance and I ordered the sweetbread and foie gras appetizer to share. They automatically split the sweetbread for us so we could have our own plate. That was nice of them. The sweetbread came on a bed of fresh noodles. But to me, it was more like noodles in butter soup. The noodle had the potential to be really good but it was soaked in so much butter that I couldn't even tell. And the sweetbread was bland. Nothing exciting about it.\n\nThe seared foie gras was delicious but they paired it with sour preserved strawberries. It didn't compliment the foie gras at all. \n\nMy fiance ordered the Pork Belly and I ordered the steak. His Pork Belly was good. But my steak was way too salty. I ate one piece and couldn't even eat anymore. Don't get me wrong, I love salt. I eat a ton of it. But this steak was covered in it. My fiance ate a few pieces and said one piece was too salty, and the other was okay. I must have taken a bite into the really salty portion. The server came over to check on us and asked why i didn't finish my steak. So I told him and he said he would tell the chef. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the recommended beignets with two sauces. It was fluffy like the server had said.The creme anglaise sauce was goodbut I didn't care for the orange chocolate sauce. \n\nWhen we got the bill, the steak was on there.

We started with sparkling wine and passed hors d' oeuvres in the library, which was sparse, standing room only, and a bit cold but nice and a good space for mingling. The shrimp was spectacular. \n\nFinally (I was starved), we moved into the beautiful but frigid back room/wine cellar? to sit down for our dinner. Yikes! Lackluster, stale rolls were delivered. A pleasant sommelier led us through wine pairings for every course (sadly I was not drinking on this particular night so I can't comment on the wine itself). \n\nNext, the new chef came out to introduce himself and the first course - peas and carrots unlike any I've experienced. Pureed but firm peas with carrot foam. Looked fancy but tasted surprisingly just like peas and carrots. \n\nThe spring harvest vegetables salad was simply but one of the best courses all night. Champagne vinaigrette, romaine, toasted hazelnuts...mmm.\n\nI wish I had good things to say about the main course but it was really disappointing. I ordered the salmon (as opposed to the duck or short rib option) and it was prepared 2 ways, grilled and rillette, which I can only begin to describe as minced and wrapped in a thin slice of squash. Inventive, I'll give them credit for creativity but it was room temperature to cold and just not enjoyable. There was a an oddly out-of-place sweet sauce (looking back at the menu, I guess that's the corn fondue) under everything (morels, roe, and squash) on the plate but i couldn't quite figure out what it was supposed to go with. I tried the short rib on the plate next to me - AMAZING. I can definitely recommend this. \n\nThe trio of desserts hit the spot. Tiny tastes of chocolate layer cake (of course, predictable but delish), coffee ice cream thing with a pecan, and strawberry shortcake. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience with a great group of people but I'm happy I didn't spend the $38 on that salmon.", "author": "Angela N."}

(http://www.7x7.com/eat-drink/2010-big-eat-sf-100-things-try-you-die) Arrived at 7:30 for an 8:00 res and happily camped out in the back bar area until our table was prepped. They have a rectangular window at eye-level that affords viewers a great perspective on the entree and dessert prep stations, with a view of the other kitchen lines as well. A great way to see whats on the menu for that evening -- our entree selections were largely decided based on those viewings. For anyone that likes the newish fad of behind-the-scenes kitchen viewing, this is the way to get up close and personal. You can see the different meat options going from cuts, to salting, to oven, to plate, to check, to table. From saucing to plate arrangement, you'll get a firsthand look at the ingredient selection (and rejection) that goes into a single entree. \n\nOur host was delightful, from helping us find a spot at the bar to seeing us out with a few jokes at the end of the meal. Our server started out strong but got grumpy mid-way through the meal. He lost interest in answering our questions and offered up very perfunctory communications. After dessert he vanished completely. Table was immaculate as they literally iron the tables a few moments before you are seated) and decor is muted grays/browns. Its a vast space, much larger than it would appear off the street, and each table is pocketed away in the dim light. \n\nWe started with the charcuterie, fois gras w/pink peppercorns and strawberries, corn soup with sorrel garnish, and green goddess salad. Charcuterie is perfect for splitting  and offers up eight tastes ranging from a hard, spicy soprasetta to a tender pate. If you're with a smaller group, I'd suggest that you veer towards some of their more unique appetizer offerings. The corn soup with sorrel reduction was a perfect summer offering and topped my list of choices. Served warm, but not piping hot, it offered up the sweetness of late season corn with the crisp accentuation of sorrel reduction and a light chiffonade. Their seasonal harvest salad was also a delight, with small lettuce bundles topped with paper-thin radish, squash, fennel, and zucchini slices, drizzles of avocado green goddess dressing, and an aged riccotta. I was savouring the tang of that cheese against the juicy veggies. Their seasonal salad, a special offering, was quartered heirloom tomatos with a light ice wine vinaigrette and burratta cheese. Nice but also something you could make at home with quality ingredients. I liked the fois gras but wouldn't recommend it for the $21 price tag. A tiny amount of seared fois gras with cooked strawberries and a teensy pot of cold fois gras with a cube of strawberry gelee. While delicious and capitalizing on summer strawberry flavors, it didn't jump out at me. \n\nEntrees were weighted towards the fish options but the burger and the duck were the winners. Their burger, which is available at the bar or in the main restaurant, was actually the reason I first happened upon Spruce. Its listed in the 100 Things to Eat and Drink Before You Die 2010 SF List, which is my new bible for visiting San Fran. The burger was substantial and delicious. They dropped the stupid trend of brioche buns, which can't hold up to a really juicy burger, in favor of a toothier, more substantial burger that could absorb the juices. If your bun is too soggy for you to palm your burger, thats a loss in my opinion. So this one was great -- especially with the layering of blue cheese. They offer up house-pickled cucumber slices, red onion, and heirloom tomato garnish. And they serve it with some of the best frites, piping hot with an herbed aoli for dipping. (We also ordered a second round of fries for the table.)\n\nThe branzino was too crisp for my liking but some of my dinner companions rated it # one. It was served on a mound of tabbouli with chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and a vaguely greek saucing. Halibut was cooked just-crisp on the exterior and sauced with a tomato vinaigrette. Good fish cuts with fresh flavors but the duck was the winner. Their duck was the leanest, truest duck that I've ever tasted. Although it was topped with cinnamon spiced fois gras, it stood out on its own for the texture and flavor.\n\nDesserts were a cheese plate, which wasn't even a contender for my taste buds at this point in the meal. We really dove into the peach cobbler, chocolate bread pudding, and apricot clafoutis. Cobbler won, due to fresh peach and maple ice cream pairing with a light biscuit topping. Sophisticated comfort food. Chocolate bread pudding came with a small scoop of strawberry, basil olive oil ice cream and diced strawberries. The ice cream didn't match the puddingy. Clafoutis' texture required that you eat each bit with a smidge of the ice cream topping.", "author": "Mairead R."}

My husband and I chose the restaurant last May after dining at several well-known restaurants in the city. In advance of our wedding reception we dined at Spruce about 4 times and were consistently impressed with the level of the service; from the moment you walk in and are greeted to the end of the evening, the staff at Spruce truly delivers. The atmosphere is chic and elegant and even if you aren't dressed to the nines, you will be greeted warmly and welcomed. \n\nIf you are considering Spruce for a group dining event I highly recommend the restaurant. They have several different options for groups. We booked the Laurel Room for a group of 22 and it was perfect. We had so many great servers that night and our guests were never unattended. (David in particular is fantastic and waited on us previously so we were so pleased to have him as our sever on our big night.) Megan, the events director is awesome!  She is incredibly helpful, responsive and will truly partner with you to create a magical evening. I also worked with Chris the Sommelier and he chose some incredible wines for our cocktail hour and dinner. We choose the charred Berkshire pork tenderloin and the roasted halibut for our entrees and so glad we did -- many of our guests had never had pork belly and were talking about it for days. The kitchen and chefs were super cool too. My cousin is a young chef and they gave him a tour and spent time talking to and inspiring him -- even instructing him how to prepare the pork belly! The bartenders created some delicious cocktails - including a special smokey handcrafted whiskey drink for the groom. \n\nNeedless to say, I cannot sing their praises enough. The entire evening was a dream!", "author": "Noel A."}

This is by far the BEST place I've eaten. \n\nI decided to take my boyfriend here to celebrate his new job. \n\nI don't like the taste of alcohol, so the waiter offered me to try a virgin drink, it was very refreshing (can't remember the name, sorry =T).  \n\nFor our starter, we ordered foie gras, instead of having both torchon and seared (since we don't like it cold) we asked for seared only please. It was yummy, but they gave too much. Hahaha I know... who complains about having too much, right?!? \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Butter poached lobster with gnocchi and the boyfriend ordered Sea Bass with dungeness crab.  The lobster wasn't heavy like you think it would be since it's poached in butter, but it was moist and tender. BOY, was it tasty, so good I wanted more when I was done!  Sea bass with crab together in a dish... GENIUS!  Both my bf's favorite!  It would have been better if it was Chilean sea bass, but he was satisfied.\n\nFor the best part of the meal... Dessert! =) Fresh warm beignets were brought to the table with a cute \"Congratulations\" sign in front.

From what I had heard, this had been the #1 burger on many people's lists and so I was intrigued to see how it compared to some of the great ones we've had over the past few months.\n\nOur reservation was pretty early which allowed us to be some of the first diners of the day!  The decor is modern but also comfortable, which I liked.  The service was excellent and I appreciated the tasty bread that is offered throughout the meal. \n\nNo on to the burger.  The first thing I noticed was the bun itself.  It was small and rather hard.  After all these burgers the one thing I never thought mattered but does is the bun.  It shouldn't be so soft that it falls apart with the juices, but should be edible.  While it was edible, it seemed like it was over-toasted.  Also, the meat was very juicy so the bottom got a bit soaked through although held together.  I had my burger with bacon and the bacon was very tasty as well as the pickled onions and pickles they provide.  I was surprised that the burger (for all of us) came out more medium than the medium rare we requested....I know that can be a challenge but c'mon Spruce!  You're a fine dining establishment!  The presentation was very good though, with the fries being served in a cute little bucket and dipping sauce on the side.\n\nOverall I was underwhelmed by Spruce's burger.  It was good but considering it's been ranked as one of the best, I expected more.   However the restaurant, service and other bites we tasted were very good so I'm giving them 4 stars...although the burger is more like a 3 star burger.", "author": "Melanie N."}

The service was excellent, and the food was very good, though not spectacular.  I would like to give more than 3 stars, but since the prices are so high, I just didn't think this place delivered value.  For the cost, I would expect the food to blow me away for a 5 star rating.  \n\nA few of us had the bavette steak with duck fat potatoes and swiss chard.  There is absolutely nothing to complain about regarding this dish--steak was perfect, potatoes & chard were delicious, portion size was pretty good.  My husband had the lobster and gnocchi, which he felt was lacking.  Someone else had the roasted chicken, which they said was good.  I didn't get comments on the other items.  I also had a salad of heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzerella, which was good despite being under-seasoned (mozzerella was to die for; tomatoes fine, but unremarkable).  They did include little extras like cheese puffs as an appetizer and bon-bons at dessert, which is a nice touch.  Again, the service was exemplary--best I've experienced in a very long time.\n\nI think Spruce is a good restaurant, but I'm probably not going to go back on my own dime.  If I want a special night out, there are plenty of places that deliver great food and service at more reasonable prices.

I've been wanting to try it almost since it opened.  It's so hard to park around there, you really have to be in the right mood, but she was driving, so lucky me.  I guess I didn't realize it was such a see and be seen place.  As G said, looking at the tables around us she felt as though we would need a Brazilian blow dry to fit in.  Anyway on to the food, which frankly is all I really care much about (although service can be a factor; more on that later)\nI'm going to sound a bit picky, but I had very high expectations with all I'd heard about it.  I started with a glass of pinot noir and had the autumn vegetable salad with green goddess dressing.   I've loved green goddess dressing since the first time it was popular in the 60's this was tasty, but they usde the artful paint a swoosh on the plate approach and frankly there just wasn't enough of it for me.  Then I had the fois gras appetizer as my second.  It was served two ways - one cold and confited and one seared.  It was very tasty, but very small, even for an appetizer.  G. started with the tomato soup with burrata.  Lovely color nice presentation, but the burrata had to actually be cut with a knife.  Then she had the pastrami and cheese sandwich, which she didn't say much about, except that it was kind of salty.  The beet salad on the side looked good.  We shared the gingerbread for dessert and it was yummy - expecially loved the lime cream on it.\nNow the comment about service: the busboy was terrible!  Flung our rolls down like he couldn't wait to get rid of them, dripped water all over while refilling water glass.  Again I know this sounds like I'm making a big deal about nothing, but at a place like this their staff should be better coached.  \nSo after all that, I go back to my new mantra for the aging me:  The key to happiness is lower expectations, or perhaps no expectations at all.  We had a good conversation and fun, and, much out of character for me, I have to say, it's not always all about the food.", "author": "Diane B."}

Their country pate was similar to The Village Pub (the sister restaurant, well they are owned by the same people).  I also had the nettle soup, with soft cooked egg, and \"house made crouton\".  I thought the textures of the crouton were nice in the perfectly viscous soup, but the soup itself lacked seasoning and again was good, but not amazing.

If I could compose a sonnet on my love for the perfect french fry, I would!  It was that blend of perfect crispness with salt and love, I could eat a 20lb bag.

In other words, I was *slightly* under-dressed, even for a wanna-be hipster reject.\n\nSo, quite predictably I get the condescending \"Mmm-hmmm\" look from the front of house people, as I meekly asked, \"Do you have any tables open?\" The natural response was, a curt \"Um, sorry no.\"\n\nOf course, there were tables open in the main dining room.\n\nUndeterred, I asked about tables at the bar area, and they murmured, \"It's first-come-first served.\"\n\nSo I make my way to the bar and find an open seat between a couple on a date and a MFF trio.\n\nStill feeling like a fish out of water, I decide to order a $12 pour of Balvenie 15 year as I waited for my buddy to show up. You know, in a vain attempt to look somewhat sophisticated...\n\nBTW, their wine/spirits list is pretty good.\n\nMy buddy shows up soon after and we listen to the chatter of the beautiful peeps for a while, and manage to spot and snag one of the bar tables.\n\nWe order up the burgers. Mine, rare with Gruyere cheese and bacon.\n\nOur waiter, an older gentleman, was awesome. Knew his shit, and was attentive without being obtrusive. Did not judge me at all based on my disheveled appearance.\n\nMy burger arrives. The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked. It's juicy and rare. It requires no seasoning.

The ostrich-skin leather chairs stand out brilliantly and entice you into the dimly lit room.\n\n***\n\nWord has traveled fast and far for the Spruce Burger, so my dad and I opted to split the burger to begin the meal while my mom chose the country potato & cabbage soup.\n\nThe burger is remarkable. Grilled medium rare, the tender meat melts into the soft bun, and each drop of flavor is only heightened by the home made sides and topped off with the most decadent herb aioli spread. \n\nPartnered with a side of duck fat fries, this is by far one of the best burgers in SF. \n\n***\n\nI moved onto the bacon wrapped venison loin which was cooked medium, and sliced into a perfect trio of cutlets. Resting on a soothing preserved plum sauce, the gaminess of the meat was tempered well. \n\nVegetables grand mere added a great element of texture to the dish. \n\n***\n\nFinished the meal with their new addition to the menu, the pineapple cake. Light, with a deep secret of sweet, the dessert was a grand touch to a phenomenal meal.\n\nOur server was warm, outgoing and guided us through the meal with true class.\n***\n\nI can say with assertion, that Spruce, while still at its infancy as a San Francisco landmark, will be rooted deep in our city's history, and as all loves, mine will only grow deeper for Spruce through time as my days in SF trek on.\n\nhttp://mikekimsf.com/", "author": "Mike K."}

I got treated borderline like a princess here. They sure know how to make a girl feel special! My cousin dined here a couple weeks earlier and insisted I tried the fois gras. Fois gras was incredible, there isn't anything else like it then how Spruce prepares it. The combination of waffle, pistachio, and pear with duck liver seems odd but paired perfectly. Even my dad who has tried the fois gras at a different location was surprised by how much he enjoyed it (he initially didn't like it where he originally tried it). For entrees I ordered the lamb and my dad ordered rib eye. I loved both dishes which came with saut\u00e9ed kale (yum!). After dinner I was stuffed and just when I thought it was over the pastry chef sent out desserts which was equally delicious. My dad and I left extremely satisfied with both the food and the service.

Their \"Country Cobbler\" with bourbon and walnut liqueur did not last long in our glasses!  We enjoyed the modernist decor, which is quite nicely done, until the rest of our party of 6 showed up.  Dress ranged from business casual to hipster and evening wear; no one felt out of place.\n\nThe Sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable.  We ordered a bottle of wine and 4 appetizers  for the table.  Most were excellent, though I wish our waitress had informed us that a single scallop appetizer would be a poor choice for a table that is sharing.  Everyone got their choice of breads which was a nice touch.  The amuse bouche was an otherwise unremarkable cheese puff.\n\nAll enjoyed their entrees, which were freshly prepared and brought hot from the kitchen.  All were well prepared though not as creatively conceived as I might have expected from a restaurant of this stature.  Desserts were creative and tasted excellent, particularly the \"caramel corn\" panna cotta.\n\nThe real trouble came when we received another table's bill.  A waiter came by and said \"I will take care of this!\", but then brought a still not quite right bill back to the table and abruptly turned around and disappeared before anyone could say anything.  Not a huge deal, but it kind of soured the mood right at the end.  As the last mistake was charging our $12 valet fee to another table I thought they just should have removed it from the bill after providing two incorrect receipts in a row.\n\nOverall the service was attentive, but at times seemed on auto pilot.", "author": "Seth G."}

And so I was absolutely tickled when my roommate and I scored a reservation to celebrate the one year anniversary of our monthly girl date.\n\nI ordered the appetizer special of the night - Nantucket scallops. I was promised something special, and the sauce served with them was to die for. The scallops themselves? About a centimeter in diameter each. Now even if they were delicious, that's pretty sad. I get the idea of small plates, but when it comes to scallops, dainty =/= better.  (My roommate loved her beet and tangerine salad, so this may have just been poor menu selection on my part.)\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the pork tenderloin with pork belly and shelling beans. The tenderloin? On the rare side, very tender, and all-around fantastic. The pork belly? Total let down. Stringy and overcooked. I love pork belly; it's pretty much a given that if it's on the menu, I'll order it. But Spruce's pork belly was not good. Not even a little bit. Very very disappointing. (My roommate also loved her order of the lobster special. So again, maybe poor menu selection.)\n\nThe ambiance and service were impeccable, and the dishes and/or parts of dishes that were good, were very good. But miniature scallops and overcooked pork belly do not a five star review make. When I shell out $75+ for a nice dinner, I expect something jaw-dropping and it wasn't. It wasn't bad, either. It was just another decent dinner.", "author": "Devon S."}

We got there early, and they weren't ready to seat us, so we hung out at the bar a bit. But our reservation time came and went, and nobody came to seat us. So the hubby went to check if our table was ready, and they finally took us to our table. Definitely felt like they had forgotten us. \n\nBut....waiter was friendly, and they were good about giving us bread, refilling our water, and refolding our napkins when we went to the restrooms. Overall, service was good.\n\nNow the food....Appetizers: Complimentary cheese puffs were good. We ordered 2 different salads. Unfortunately, I don't know the names of the salads, since I didn't order them. One looked like a pile of red cabbage. The other was prettier with green beans, cheese, etc. Both were not bad, but nothing special as far as tastes goes.  We also ordered the charcuterie. While I enjoyed it enough, my husband, who loves prosciutto, said the duck prosciutto was the best prosciutto he's ever had. Our friend also ordered the sweet corn soup, which again was nothing special.\n\nMain entrees: The guys had the Bavette Steak, since the waiter told us that's what they're known for. Our friend didn't like the sauce that came with it. The hubby thought the steak was good, but not so good that he'd come back here for it. The duck fat potatoes that some reviewers rave about....we also felt was just a potato. My friend ordered the pork tenderloin. It was again good, just not exceptional. And I had the black cod. The fish was cooked well, but I was not a fan of the beans that came with it. And the broth that the fish was sitting in was really salty, which I guess is better than being under-seasoned. But the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of red wine, and the bill came out to be $300+ for 4 people.\n\nOverall: A-Ok.

Most recently - this week- and yet again they delivered!  \n\nSpruce was able to fit us in earlier in the week for a larger group (10 people0 in one of their private dining rooms - w/out any special charges, bar/food min's or anything - and they allowed us to choose from the full menu.  Very cool and unusual for a restaurant of this caliber! \n\nFood has always been absolutely delicatble. For Apps - the scallops, and the fig salad and peach salad were all super good and very different.  The scallops app comes with 1 scallop- so if you are trying to share w/ a large group -order more then 1.  Main course - I did halves (halibut and salmon) - both great.  The halibut - just practically melts in your mouth.  The salmon was grilled - and tasted very fresh - the mushrooms that came w/ salmon, I enjoyed - but they were definitely a wood-fired flavored.  There are a few veggie items - and the servers were kind enough to also point out others that they could do - the veggie eaters in the group really enjoyed the raviolli characterized as  tasty and \"not heavy.\"  \n\nDesserts we tried practically all of them - the big hits were the strawberry concotion and the peanut butter choc cake - both definitely worth trying. I was not a big fan of the peach choice, beignets (which were very donut like) and cherry creation.  \n\nService was good - because we were a large party and not in the main dining room - we were a bit loud and enjoyed our entire experience as being in our own space.  \n\nDefinitely worth eating at - only suggestion that I would give to Spruce - for some reason - some of the staff tends to be a bit snootty - fortunately we did not have to deal with too many of them our server was great, Sean the maitre-d also an asset! \n\nThe hostess unfortunately had a lot of attitude that takes away from the experience.

Nothing I was amazed by, but solid, though certainly overpriced. Our server was fine; no complaints there. What really got me was the front-of-house service that completely ruined the night. We showed up punctually for our 8pm Thursday reservation. The place was quite crowded. We approached the host/hostess desk and the man there said it would be a moment for our table to be ready. No problem. There were no available seats and we got crunched over by the door, but that's no big deal. Then an older, very done-up couple, bedecked in sequins, entered and was seated immediately; no waiting. Several minutes later, the host walked over to us and said, \"it will just be a few more minutes for your table.\" I replied, \"you know, that couple over there came in quite a bit after we did and got seated before us, which is really frustrating to me.\" He said, \"I am terribly sorry,\" not in a sarcastic voice, but in a tone that did strike me as disingenuous, and walked away. We then proceded to wait more. Did anyone offer us a drink? No. (On-the-house would've been appropriate, but I even would've paid for one just to have something started while I was waiting.) Eventually, two women at the host desk told us we could have a seat in the lounge (which was not what we'd reserved), but that a table in the main dining room wouldn't be available for about 15 minutes, putting us roughly 30 minutes past our reservation time. I was hungry and had to get up early, so we opted for the lounge, but found the weird seats there sort of uncomfortable, and we did feel slighted. I understand that it's not the restaurant's fault if some diners don't vacate their tables as early as planned, and even that it is in some restaurants' business model to have \"VIP\" guests who are clearly given preference over other guests, but I think a restaurant at this price-point should make an effort to make those \"inferior\" guests still feel that their business is appreciated. We were never offered any complimentary drinks or a dessert, no manager came to apologize, nothing. The best we got was that when we were seated, the hostess said, \"I like the lounge seats better, anyway.\" That was it. Such disappointing service. I've been fortunate enough to go to lots of fine dining establishments in San Francisco, as well as many in New York for the 6 years I lived there, and have definitely found the norm to be that quality restaurants act more professionally. In fact, just the day after, I headed to dinner at NOPA, where I overhead a situation where a woman at the bar requested a seat at the other end of the bar, for comfort, and the bartender noticed that one was opening up and told her she could go take it, but then someone had snagged it by the time she made her way down there. Not really the restaurant's fault, but the bartender then asked the woman's name and gave her his, then called her by name throughout the night and offered her wine on the house. Redeemed. See? Why can't Spruce act like that? I'll stick to NOPA from now on. It's cheaper, too, and doesn't seem like its popularity has gone to its head.", "author": "Lynn M."}

About the food - I was expecting more and did not feel that it lived up to my expectations.  The food was very good - don't get me wrong but it wasn't fabulous.  There was nothing different/unique about my bavette steak. It was kind of funny - when they gave us our entrees, they tried to do it at the same time twice and both times it was a fail.  And also they got our dishes switched around - another fail.  But we didn't really mind it.  GD does the same thing.  \n\nThe BEST thing about this restaurant is the beignets!!!!!!!!  We didn't know how many was in an order so we got 2 orders - there was about 6-7 in each order but we didn't care because they were so delicious.

The ladies sitting next to us (nicely dressed, pbb in their 40's) were all having the spruce burger, so our expectations were high. You don't see classy middle-age ladies, dressed in brand name clothes, eating burgers very often... So our burger came, and honestly, I was not impressed. The patty was dry and a bit too beefy, maybe we should've gotten it with the gueyere cheese. My bf's in a mission to search for a burger that tops off NYC Minetta Tavern's black label burger ever since we came back from NYC, but the spruce burger did not do it, not even close.\n\nDuck confit was pretty decent. Meat fell right off the bones and the skin had a little crunch left to it. The tanginess of the rubarband the bitterness of the greens really balanced off all the fat of the duck.\n\nAtmosphere was a bit stuffy, mostly well-dressed middle age men and women. Although the service was good, for 60+ dollars lunch for two with 2 mains and 1 soup, I'expected better.", "author": "tiannaaah J."}

Was disappointed with what the offering was for lunch.  Spruce gave you no choices on the DAT menu, and it was two courses.  On the day I was there, it was Carrot Soup as the appetizer, and the lunch entree was Mushroom Risotto.  I was underwhelmed by both so decided to order off of the regular menu.\n\nStarted out with French Fries with Remoulade.  Hands down - top notch french fried - and I would know, because I order then at almost every restaurant I can find them.  And there was definitely a consistent theme with other diners there, as at least 4 other tables ordered fries as an appetizer.\n\nFor lunch I had the Saffron Fazzoletti, which was Braised Lamb, Peas and Carrots.  The lamb was shredded and wrapped in pasta, and set on a carrot puree.  A bit different than what the menu stated, but that was okay.  I absolutely loved it.  Flavors accompanied each other very well, and the serving was plenty for lunch.\nDining companion had the Pastrami and Cypress Grove Gouda sandwich with Beet Vinaigrette.  The sandwich was fantastic.  The Patstrami was fresh, moist, and enough on the sandwich to fill anyone up.  And, you can eat it with your hands if you want - as that is what a sandwich is.  It wasn't served in such a fashion that you would have to use a knife and fork to devour.\n\nWine List was overwhelming, as it is literally a book in thickness with so many options.  Service was top notch.  Wine glasses were always filled.  We did have a bottle of white wine with lunch, and the wine was put on top of our table as opposed to a wine bucket to keep it chilled like another couple had a few tables over.\n\nDecor is beautiful I must say.  Dark woods and colors mixed with tan.  Chairs at the table were large and very comfortable.\n\nI made a reservation before leaving that day, for dinner, to bring someone for a nice evening for two - which I am confident Spruce will deliver.", "author": "Jason I."}

The first choice wine is from an excellent winery in Willamette Valley, Oregon, it had nothing to do with \"budget,\" but rather preference.

Spruce was nice to have been to but I doubt we will return. Ultimately it was the inconsistency and price that brought it down to 2 stars. \n\nWe at there late in the late evening on mothers day, it was busy but not crowded. Decor was nice and the ostrich skin chairs were very comfortable. \n\nService was excellent, not complaints there. \n\nWe ordered cocktails and received complementary cheese puffs which were delicious. However the cocktails were only OK given the price (probably didn't help that we had been to Bourbon & Branch the night before)\n\nTo start I had the sweet breads, they were tasty though slightly on the salty side. They came with a decent amount tagliatelle pasta, which in my opinion, visually dominated the dish.\n\nFor mains my date had the braised short rib which was very good.\n\nI had ordered the halibut with asparagus and fiddlehead greens, which, sadly was the low point of the evening. The fish was small and bland, the greens were overcooked and had been sitting in the sauce long enough to begin to brown. For $37, this is unacceptable. \n\nI had a glass of chardonnay with the fish which was decent enough, though not on par with other $14 glasses of wine I've had (also it was on the med-low end price wise of the \"per glass\" list)\n\nFor dessert we shared the Chocolate fudge which was the highlight of the evening. The ice cream and caramelized cookie served with it could easily been their own dish. \n\nAll in all it the atmosphere and service were excellent, but the food was not up to par and priced 20% higher then it should have been given the portion size and quality.

The food is excellent!  \n\nWe kicked things off with the scallops (tasty and fresh) and the rocket + cherry goat cheese salad; an unintuitive combination to say the least, but a surprise hit.\n\nThe real highlight of the meal was the main course, a quasi-secret menu item called the Tomahawk Steak: 2 pounds of 28 day dry-aged bone-in ribeye cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The waiters present the steak to you before slicing it neatly and serving two perfect plates.  It comes with excellent fries and decent swiss chard.  This steak was worthy of poetry, and there were enough left-overs for steak + eggs this morning.  However, at $120 it's incredibly expensive... even for serving 2 (thank you gift card!)\n\nFor dessert the strawberry shortcake (good but not as memorable as the other items), and the beignets (read: mini sugar donuts with dipping sauce).  The accompanying Cr\u00e8me anglaise was delightful but the dark chocolate was, unexpectedly, flavored with orange.  I'm sure it would be good if you liked that sort of thing but it's not for me and, as the menu didn't state such I was disappointed to have orange-flavored chocolate... just call me a purist I suppose.\n\nNothing at this restaurant was bad... or even mediocre, so I'll just say the following items were not up to par with the food:\n\nTable - we made a reservation over 6 weeks in advance and it felt like we were shoved into the corner at an undesirable table near the curtains and main walkway.  Not a disaster by any stretch but a disappointing first impression of the restaurant.\n\nService - the service is precise and very professional.

First, the space is beautiful.  They have high ceilings with exposed beams, which make the space so open.  The vibe is very much Laurel Heights, and what I mean by that is it is a much older crowd in the dining room, while the bar is full of your 20-30 somethings.  While the service was spot on, it was a bit stuffy, but I was expecting that, so I wasn't too bothered by it.  \n\nAs far as food is concerned, we started with the pumpkin soup, which was phenomenal!  It was smooth, creamy, light, and the portion was huge...enough for the 3 of us to have more than just a taste.  We also had the beet and pear salad, which was not much of a salad, but great nonetheless.  It had thinly sliced golden beets on a bed of pears, with a small bunch of arugula and a dollop of goat cheese sitting on a small toast.  I believe there was also toasted hazelnut, which added to the texture of the \"salad\"  This was a great, refreshing starter that had me looking forward to our entrees.  Our last starter was the sweet corn ravioli, with summer squash.  This dish was awesome!  The homemade pasta, with sweet corn, and the drizzle of olive oil was great.  I wanted a few more taste, but my sister managed to gobble it up before I could.  \n\nMoving on to entrees, we were all a bit underwhelmed.  While they were all executed perfectly, they weren't as memorable as the starters. Our expectation had been elevated to a whole new level.  We ordered the pork tenderloin/belly, which was good, but not great (try the same combo at Gary Danko, it will change your life!)  We also had the steak with duck fat fries, and the halibut.  All in all, they were tasty, but didnt compare to the starters that we had.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice dinner spot, and you're in the neighborhood, stop at Spruce, grad a drink from the bar, and stick with a few starters.

No doubt the dining room is a bit stuffy, but the food is to die for and the extensive wine list is worth it for any special occasion.

First of all, it's really tough to get a reservation, particularly for a weekend.  The first time we were going to try the bar, but decided to meet some friends somewhere else.  The second time, I was actually able to get a reservation (called almost 2 months ahead), but then we had to cancel since we had a guest come in from out of town unexpectedly.  The third time, we got another reservation but cancelled again since it was right before we had to leave for a vacation.  When we had plans to go into the city to go to the opera, we finally decided to take our chances, coming in at shortly after 5pm on a Sunday.  All their tables were taken, but there was plenty of room at the bar, since they reserve it for walk-ins.  If you're unable to score a reservation, the bar is the way to go!  Just make sure you get there early.\n\nWe started off with the veal sweetbreads and their \"grand selection\" of charcuterie.  The veal sweetbreads were awesome (and with a decent-sized portion), but I gotta say, this place has one of the best charcuterie plates in the city!  Their duck liver mousse was to-die-for, reminded me a lot of Village Pub in Woodside (probably because they are owned/run by the same folks).  For $18, you definitely get your money's worth in meats.\n\nMy hubby got the spruce burger for his entree, since we heard you can only get it at the bar.  It was a really great burger, but I dunno whether it lived up to the hype.  It would definitely hit the spot if you're in the mood for burgers, but I wouldn't make a special trip here just for that (for the charcuterie, however...)  For my entree, I got the pork tenderloin, which was ok...it was probably the least impressive of the dishes we ordered, the pork belly was the best part.  I wish I should have gone with the duck instead, but I got tempted by the pork belly!\n\nWe didn't have time to get dessert, since we had to leave for the show, but man was I tempted by their very impressive cheese menu.

I hardly come to this neighborhood, so it was a bit of a surprising to find a restaurant such as this.\n\nThe interior is handsome. But not like the handsomeness of Harrison Ford, probably more like the handsome of an Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in Godfather. Yes, attractive and well meaning yet domineering with an undertone of scariness. The walls are pretty much black, the art is imposing, and the lighting is dark. It dictates a lot of authority with its minimal decor but its not very romantic or inviting. If you have a power business meeting or you're getting a divorce, this would be the perfect spot.  It really felt like a restaurant that would be in Gotham City.\n\nBecause we were at the tail end of reservations we got the \"back room\" that holds only four tables. But surprisingly the \"back room\" is in the front. Right before the main doors is a room to the right concealed by 'Beauty and the Beast' like curtains. I liked the vibe in this room a lot more than the main dining room. The lit fireplace and intimacy of this room is great; however, the intimacy is somewhat broken by the huge zoo-like window that's open to public viewing.

Maybe I'm over high-end food or I ate too fast, but it wasn't as \"holy-sh*t!\" as I expected from a splurging tab. Sure you do have to factor in the atmosphere, service, and presentation but to me it's all about the food. For the price it really wasn't worth it. I'd rather eat a rack of messy ribs with a milkshake for dessert any day of the week. But if you want to impress your coworkers or have 1300 options of wine, this will do.\n\nThe service was good all around. They gave us two different options of bread, folded our napkins, and was generally nice. The desserts came late so they gave us a free extra plate of beignets; however, they accidentally gave us another dessert that we didn't order (the candy bar). We still ate and paid for it.\n\n___\n\nI just ate at RN74 and I'd say this place is better overall yet pricier. When it comes down to just the food it's a bit of a tie. RN74 is more filling and casual while Spruce is more elegant and high-end. Not sure if I'd come back. As I said, a rack of ribs would be better and more fun to eat. If I don't feel entirely comfortable laughing hard in a restaurant then I don't really feel like being there.", "author": "Michael H."}

I wanted to go to a place that has class and taste and Spruce did it for me. \n\nIf I describe it in one simple word....'awesome'. The attire is classy, so casual is definitely a no-no. The ambience is pretty good, giving you the privacy that you want but not letting you feel alone or left out. The service is pretty swift, so you order and it is on your table. Now comes the best part...food. Spruce has a great selection of Wine, that you must try out. Since both of us are seafood fans, we mainly ordered from that range. But I must say,  Osetra Caviar is a must have starter. A bit towards the expensive side, but worth every penny. We then moved on to butter poached lobster, that was made to absolute perfection. Dessert was like the biggest temptation of all. We ordered Beignets with chocolate sauce and cr\u00e8me Anglaise. You have to try to believe how divine they are. They completely melt in your mouth. \n\nSpruce made my special occasion, even more special. Anyone who wants to live those moments in a special way...go to Spruce!", "author": "Kimberly F."}

I could just be a teensy weensy bias since it was a company event and a free dinner....but the food was absolutely amazing.\n\nBefore I start talking food I must say the service is excellent. The Sommelier was very knowledgeable and recommended 2 of the very best wine I have ever had.  They don't have a wine list, it's a wine book.  \n\nFor our private party they brought out several appetizers such as tuna tartare, saffron rice croquettes, and goat cheese/smoked salmon Amuse-bouche (fancy name for bite size h'doeuvre).\n\nI ordered the seared preserved foie gras for appetizer. AMAZING.  You know how sometimes when you order seared foie gras it comes almost completely cooked? well this was actually seared. Slighly crispy top and soft/squishy center. Perfection. The preserved foie gras is more of a mousse and it came with brioche toast. I can't rave enough. This dish should definitely be shared because it is a lot of foie gras for 1 person (my mistake).\n\nMy main course was the Grilled Bavette steak.  Portion was on the smaller side (probably around 6 oz, sliced into about 5-6 pieces).  They actually got my order wrong.  I ordered medium rare but they served it to me medium. Usually I would send it back but after 1 bite I was decently satisfied and just kept my dish.  Their \"medium\" was more on the rare side. The duck fat potatoes are just really fat french fries.\n\nHad  a bite of my colleagues lobster and it was the most buttery lobster I have ever had. YUM-MY.\n\nFor dessert i had their warm chocolate cake. It was pretty good. Not to die for. The beignets were pretty good too. I would also order their decaf coffee. It doesn't taste watery and was actually pretty good.\n\nNow I just need to save up so i can come back here!", "author": "Terry D."}

I thought I was about to crack open a dictionary. I am no wine connoisseur, but they have a wide range to please any palette.  \n* The servers and bartenders are very knowledgeable. They all took some time to thoroughly answer questions (one went so far as to describe the life cycle of a truffle). \n* The food: we ordered all veg items, which I don't believe is their forte. Ordered: beet salad, squash ravioli, a couscous with vegetables that was off the menu (delicious, but also had beets which I found strange), and tagliarini with butter sauce and shaved truffles. Everything was split so portions seemed small, but the food carried a heavy punch! Completed the meal with beignets with dark chocolate and vanilla dipping sauces, which were delightful, though I couldn't handle eating more than two.\n\nWould dock a star because our server at one point did go MIA  for about 15 minutes before we ordered, so that was a bit weird, we were starving and didn't have bread to nibble on.

I have been to Spruce three times trying to use a $200 gift card and each time something has gone awry, leading us to have to go back three separate times to spend our cash.\n\nThe first time I went, a black slug crawled out from under my scallops and made its way across my meal.  There is something to be said for fresh greens, but i would expect for my meal to be inspected before being served.  My mother-in-law noted that something on my plate was moving.  You never want to hear that... I have to say that the restaurant more than made up for it by comping our entire meal including our wine and even gave us some of their delicious cookies to go.  Very classy and certainly made me want to go back again to try to use our gift card again.\n\nThe second time, my husband and I sat at the bar.  Definitely a great ambiance there and I did love my Martini and my burger.  Unfortunately, my husband who asked for his burger medium rare got one that was very well done.  Rookie move... Again, Spruce made good and brought him a new burger and comped one of our burgers which was really nice, but we were still left $50 on our gift card.  My burger and fries were delicious by the way, so I did want to go back for more...\n\nThe third time, I made reservations using Open Table.  What really annoyed me is that Spruce called me to confirm my reservation, which is fine, but they left me a voicemail and asked that I re-confirm by calling them back.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I don't understand why restaurants can't just call you and say if you have any changes to your reservation to please call back.  Of course I did not call back as I find it ridiculous to confirm a reservation three separate ways and I think I was punished as we were seated in some back room that looks like it is more suited for private parties.  We spent over $200 for two of us to not even get to experience the restaurant as it is meant to be enjoyed.  Spruce... if you are reading this, that back room makes you feel like you are a second class citizen.  Use it for large parties or private parties, not for a table for four!\n\nWill I go back?

Beautifully presented, large portion, and nice shavings of black truffle on top.\n\nEndive Salad: One of the reasons this place is getting 4 instead of 5 stars- the salad was just ok, really simple and not really alot of flavor.\n\nButtered Lobster w/Big Fried Gnocchi, greens and mushrooms: This was the star of the meal! Sometimes lobster can be boring or not substantial enough, but this lobster was full of flavor, super tender, and the accompaniments made the dish substantial. A good sized portion of lobster with a delicious butter sauce, set atop a huge crunchy potato cake (they called it a big gnocchi), and sauteed greens and wild mushrooms surrounding. The sauce was bursting with complex flavors (not your ordinary drowned in butter lobster), and the crunchiness of the potato cake really balanced the soft lobster. Mushrooms and greens were full of flavor. Everything about this dish was perfect- the presentation, the large portion of lobster, and most importantly the seasoning was perfect.\n\nPetit Filet with Oxtail Ravioli and Vegetables: This was another reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The meat was flavorful but not very tender, and the outside crust looked seared but tasted kind of tough. The petit carrots and other veggies were delicately cooked and flavorful. The oxtail ravioli was very good.\n\nCowgirl Creamery triple creme cheese, almonds: The cheese was fairly good, marcona almonds toasty, and bread was warm and rustic.\n\nChocolate Trio Dessert: Three chocolate creations: double chocolate cake, white chocolate mousse on butter cookie, passionfruit mousse. Chocolate cake was yummy, rich and creamy. White chocolate mousse was pretty good but I'm not a big fan of white chocolate. The passionfruit mousse was a little too tangy, not my favorite.\n\nSERVICE: Service here is impeccable, friendly and very attentive. We were seated immediately upon arriving even though we were about 15 minutes early, and the waitress offered us two options of seating- we chose the front room with fireplace, which was quieter and more private. We never had to wait for our water to be poured, our wine/ food to arrive. And it was so sweet how they gave us a cute valentines take home bag of heart shaped message cookies and a single long stemmed rose.\n\nAMBIANCE: Beautiful, elegant, modern with some traditional elements that make it warm and inviting.

The end of our journey was in sight and we were excited to check out Spruce after hearing good things about it.\n\nOur reservation was fairly early, so when we arrived the dining area was almost empty. We got seated in a booth with three place settings arranged there (nice touch, because sometimes restaurants have 4 settings even when 3 reserve). The seating was very comfortable and the table was at the right height for eating -- another nice touch. While waiting for the server we checked out the enormous wine list. I kid you not, it was the size of a big book or small Encyclopedia Britannica. The server took our drink orders and came back with complimentary amuse bouches -- goug\u00e8res with gruy\u00e8re cheese. They were quite tasty. \n\nIt should be mentioned that Spruce's burger is served at dinner time as well, despite what 7x7 says in the review, but it is hidden in a separate menu, so just ask for it. Now Spruce is quite a fancy place, so we were wondering how the server would react to us ordering just the burgers, bar food basically, but she didn't even bat an eye and was very pleasant and cheerful. We also got a charcuterie plate to share.\n  \nThe appetizer arrived shortly and it was quite a cornucopia of meats, from p\u00e2t\u00e9 to rillettes to salumi and coppa, accompanied by delicious pieces of toasted bread and mustard. We enjoyed every piece. Then the burgers showed up and it was time to see how good they were. I'm happy to report that mine was well executed, albeit with the now common tendency of places to overdo them a bit, since mine was medium rather than medium-rare. However, it was still very juicy and tasty. I liked that the burger came with two pickled toppings: red onions and thin slices of lightly pickled cucumbers. The bad part was the bun: quite hard and probably difficult to cut in half. Despite being hard the bottom part became a mush with all the juices of the burger soaking into it. The fries were pretty good and I liked that they were served with a house-made remoulade.\n\nThroughout our dining the service was great. Our water was replenished without having to ask, the server was never too far away, and we were offered bread a few times. I also enjoyed the atmosphere in the restaurant and would definitely like to come back there. I would rate the burger 3 stars and Spruce itself 5, so averaging out it gets 4.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

I love lamb and I love duck, especially if it's not Chinese style on the bone and then hacked with a cleaver.  Duck won the day because it was served with foie gras.

They welcomed us with a signed birthday card on our table. They started us off with 3 different options of bread w/either regular butter or honey cinnamon butter. Our server was the best. After ordering our wine, she brought out our picks as well as another option to just taste and offered to give us half glasses of both wine options if we liked both. She recommended the scallop and corn soup appetizers which we decided to go with and offered to split the two dishes so that we can both have our own plates. They also brought out another complimentary bread that I forgot the name of but it tastes similar to the cheese bread that you get at Brazilian BBQ places. The scallops and the corn soup were both amazing. Our server also recommended the duck entree and the pork loin entree. Both dishes were delicious! The duck was perfectly cooked, the skin was crispy while the inside was still juicy. I only had one bite of the pork dish but it was a delicious bite. At the end, they brought out a mini birthday cake for my boyfriend with a candle and it had \"happy birthday\" written on the plate. The cake was pretty good. We also ordered the beignets and the olive oil cake as well. The beignets were so good! They were light and airy on the inside and crispy and sugary on the outside and the two sauces (chocolate and vanilla) were a perfect combo. The olive oil cake was also very good. The cake itself was really light and the side of ice cream that it came with tasted like there was a ginger spice incorporated in it.

And was also served with two waffles with a scoop of foie gras terchon as a spread.  I was cherishing every bite.  I'm salivating as I think about it.  The seared one was perfect - excellent in flavor however a bit on the small side.  The cold foie gras was rich and paired well with the fresh organic pears.  My entree was the duck breast with honey jus, huckleberries, and shavings of foie gras.  It was delectable.  Tender, robust in flavor; the honey jus added just the right amount of sweetness while huckleberries provided the little spurts of tart flavor.  I had a bite of the spruce burger; not really impressed.  It tasted like a normal burger to me but then again, I've never really been a burger kind of gal.

I don't think anyone can be disappointed with the mini beignets we ordered for dessert, (served with a vanilla and chocolate dipping sauce on the side).\n\nThe service was great. The waiter was super knowledgeable and was thrilled to answer all of our questions.\n\nThere is a serious serious wine list at this restaurant. Literally hundreds upon hundreds of options. The cheapest bottle I remember seeing on the list was $38 dollars, and it goes WAY up from there to $5000 +. None the less, the sommelier was extremely friendly, patient and helpful.\n\nLastly, throughout our meal, we were given complimentary amuse-bouche (bite size appetizers) which added serious awesomeness to the meal. The crowd is a bit older, very suit and tie Pac-Heights esque, and though that's not quite us, it is by no means a deterrent for me to go back there. Truth is, if I was able to afford to be a regular at Spruce, I would and how.", "author": "Benny C."}

The company that organized this event, Liquor.com, really did an exceptional job.\n\nThere's an exceptionally romantic ambiance that you will notice right when you walk into Spruce. There are two darkly lit, adjacent seating areas on either sides of the hostess table and a beautiful bar against the wall on the right.\n\nThe night started off sort of awkwardly in the bakery section of the restaurant. They had converted this space into a meet and greet area and I assume its purposed was to just get us checked in for the dinner. The first cocktail they served was delicious. There was bourbon, angostura bitters, maple syrup and a lemon twist involved but I don't remember the specific name of this drink. After about 30 minutes, once most everybody had arrived, we were all ushered into a private dining area in the back of the restaurant. \n\nThe room consisted of two tables with about 20 chairs each.There were 3 bourbon tasting set in front of each place so we all found seats awaiting further instruction. The menu for the night was also placed in front of each setting, and I really could not have been happier. My two hopes were foie gras on the menu and no chicken. Both of my wishes came true. \n\nThe first cocktail pairing was a persimmon punch with the seared foie gras. A delicious accompaniment to the velvety foie gras and poached persimmon that came with it. \n\nThe second cocktail paired was made with Elijah Craig 18 yr bourbon. I think maple syrup and spiced apple were involved here. There was also a sliced apple garnish to finish it off. This drink came with three preparations of rabbit . The rabbit was very tender and the lentils and carrot puree it came with were also very delicious.\n\nThe third cocktail was made with Rittenhouse Rye 100. I believe there were equal parts bourbon, sweet vermouth, and maraschino liqueur with burnt lemon peel and a dash of Benedictine. I forget the name of this drink, but the bartender said it was a classic southern cocktail. this drink was noticeably stronger than the previous, and I could tell that was to balance the rich third course. The third course consisted of slow-cooked beef short ribs with a horseradish sauce that tasted exceptional. Even considering my love for foie, this was my favorite course. \n\nLast up we had dessert. this consisted of a cider braised apple and toasted oat strudel with whiskey sabayon. Very delicious indeed and a nice way to finish up the meal. The cocktail pairing here was Parker's Heritage Bourbon, neat. This 27 year old bourbon was older than me, and I really enjoyed it. \n\nAfter the meal they gave us bottles of Evan William bourbon and honey liqueur as parting gifts. \n\nAgain this was a fantastic meal, it literally made me feel like I was celebrating my birthday or something.", "author": "Egan B."}

The decor is beautiful, it's truly a superb place for a nice dinner, and I agree with so many descriptions of feeling like you're in NY.  The library section is great for hanging out with friends and relaxing.  We sat at the bar and ordered wine and....me getting a sweet tooth, I had to get dessert.  As always I went for chocolate, but it wasn't to die for as the bartender told us, it was simply OK.  A bit rich but not much taste or distinction.    \n\nWhen we got the check, he charged me for the wrong wine, and actually poured the wrong one as well, I noticed the taste but I was in a really relaxed mood and didn't care to make a point of it.

Duck Breast, Foie Gras, Rhubarb over spinach- Great duck, each with just a thin sliver of perfectly crisped skin. Two healthy lumps of burst on the tongue Foie Gras.\n2. Seared Hamachi- Well done variant on the classic Seared Ahi Tuna. Light on the seasoning to allow to your tastes.\n\nAnd on the way out, the valet thanked me for my patronage.

As such, I won't comment on that further. \n\nI have to say that the service is beyond exceptional at this SF location. I have never been to a restaurant where the staff is this attentive and kind. When we got there, the hostess escorted me and my friend to the restroom. The restroom isn't that impressive but they have chairs for you to wait if the stalls are occupied and the hand towels are so thick and plus. \nIn the restaurant, we were seated in really really comfortable chairs and drank fresh water (that never passed beyond half empty). I ordered a soda which came in a glass bottle and the waiter filled my glass and poured it whenever it needed refreshing (*note..no refills). I really honestly think that the only other thing that the wait staff could do is feed you the food. It was a little much at times and I can see how it could get annoying, but I really liked the very hands on service. \n\nWe ordered the scallions as the appetizer and they were really good. Nice and buttery and soft... yum.\n\nI came here for the burger upon the reviews that it's the best in the bay.. it really is amazing because it is suuuper juicy and thick and juicy and juicy. I think one thing that was lacking was that they didn't explain that we could have had the option to add things or caramelize onions or whatever else you can do... As this was my first time, I didn't know! So, I guess ask your waiter questions if you have them... The onions and pickles are pickled in something else yielding a sweeter taste. I haven't tried many other burgers in the bay so i won't judge YET but i'll get back to this review. The fries were crispy and had that ... burnt taste i like. The fries weren't burnt, but there's just that attractive flavor that I don't know how to describe....\n\nIn addition to all this yumminess and service, they also bring out a few complimentary little tidbits which I guess are supposed to be like little appetizers or something like that. Something with gruyere cheese and upon dessert, these little marshmallow with coconut things. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and it was a great burger.

I do not suggest ordering one if you are in a hurry, but instead if you are looking for a lovely little creation to savor. \n\nOur server was amazing and very helpful with the menu. He made a few great suggestions and helped us pair wines with our meals. \n\nOverall the food was very good but did not really knock my socks off.

The beignets are a must have dessert!!! Be sure to order the creme anglaise and chocolate sauces with them!! \n\nMy favorite thing about Spruce is that is a high end restaurant with zero attitude.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-26", "description": "I had dinner at Spruce two nights ago. The service, including the wait staff, host and wine steward, were excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly and the fresh, house made fresh mozzarella was delicious. I reduced the score only because of the green salad. In truth, just a half-star reduction would be appropriate, but that is not a choice on yelp. The green salad looked like it would if i took a handful of mixed greens and just tossed it on a plate. The dressing was ok, but the dish was no better than a starter salad I have received at local pizza parlors (albeit nice ones). For all the effort Spruce put into presentation and taste for the entree, appetizer and dessert, the salad was a glaring disconnect. \n\n         The wine list and the wine stewards were exceptional. Before I continue my review I will say that I do not know anyone who works at Spruce, or for that matter anyone in the restaurant business period.\n       \n            I note that another reviewer complained about the $60 corkage fee after they first drank TWO bottles of wine which they brought with them.Not sure when they were there, but on the night I was there, I watched a table of seven show up with FOUR bottles of their own wine, and then heard one of the diners express his displeasure with being charged corkage. Bringing your own wine, while allowed, is like showing up with a loaf of french bread and some cheese, and asking the kitchen to serve it up. Regardless of how much you might spend on the rest of the meal, BYOB is seldom appropriate. A very special bottle, a single bottle, most restaurants understandably allow without any, or a nominal charge.  But 4 bottles, obviously brought to save some money, come on. However, Spruce, to their credit, decanted each of the  4 bottles and each of the seven diners was given four separate glasses, and had their wine poured by the wine steward throughout the evening. Four decanters, 28 nice bordeaux glasses, the full attention of the wine steward and  these diners thought this should be for free? It is also worth noting that the Spruce wine list has a special listing of red wines for under $80, some under $40 and many $60 or less. So it is not as if you have to spend $200 on a bottle. \n\n             Finally, the internet is not a free ride. An opinion regarding something subjective like taste or appearance is one thing. However,  stating that a restaurant gave you food poisoning is obviously damaging to their business and could and should result in a reviewer being held monetarily responsible for the resulting loss of business if such a statement is not accurate. \n\n            I forgot to mention, my table found the scallops quite delicious the other night, and we felt fine.", "author": "b g."}

IQ's pork tenderloin and pork belly were the standouts but I loved my striped bass.   My starter of red pumpkin soup was also a standout selection.\n\nI fell in love with the wine list as well, and the sommelier manages to steer this lone drinker in our party to some really beautiful selections by the glass both for a starter and with the main course.  \n\nThe dining room itself does the nearly impossible--it feels both grand and intimate all at the same time.  Yes, it's dark, but somehow you don't mind.

The carmelized dayboat scallops were very good but didn't have me jumping out of my seat. \n\nAt our table we ordered the butter poached lobster, the Moroccan spiced goat, the honey lacquered duck breast with foie gras, and the pork tenderloin and crispy pork belly. The butter poached lobster was my entree and I liked it a lot. The lobster was tender, the butter sauce very decadent, and it was served with pillowy gnocchi. I had a taste of my husbands spiced goat. It tasted a little like lamb to me. I'm not a big fan of lamb but my husband enjoyed it. I wasn't impressed with the crispy pork belly and pork tenderlon. It was a little too fatty for me. The duck with foie gras was out of this world. The foie gras really enhanced the taste of the meat. \n\nWe also had the beignets with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. They were perfect. At the suggestion of the waitress I broke them in half and put sauce in each half. The strawberry shortcake was good but I probably would just order the beignets next time. \n\nSo the price is a little steep. We spent over $400 for 4 people.

I had the duck while the hubby had the steak. His steak was way too salty and when we alerted the server they said they used minimal amounts of salt. he did bring us out a new one but they said this time they didnt even bother to salt it because of our initially complaint. Which is unacceptable. ANY chef can over or under salt but to bring back a completely UNSALTED plate of food is ridiculous and shows a lack of professionalism.

We had a nice, pleasant experience here for a friend's birthday dinner.   There were 9 of us and we had a nice round table that helped us converse with all.  The food was yummy and since there were some good eaters at the table there were even a few other dishes available to sample.\n\nMy only complaint about the place is since they serve meals at the bar for walk ins there is really no area to meet before dinner and enjoy a cocktail without feeling like you are hovering over people.

Good bun but not great which is why it's 3rd in my book. The burger itself is about as good as it gets though. Spruce is a fancy place and like NOPA its hard to park in the area and the restaurant is often very busy. We sat in the bar and ate the burger at the bar and the atmosphere was still a little pretentious. This is a rich guy establishment but their burger was top notch.", "author": "Jamie C."}

The honey lacquered duck breast w/ cinnamon spiced foie gras was amazing. The duck is served atop a bed of watercress and normally I'm not a huge fan of the cress, but the brothy sauce that it is served in is so flavorful that I truly enjoyed it. The foie gras was the perfect accompaniment to the Liberty duck breast.\n\nB, on the other hand, was disappointed in the veal chop he ordered. It was the night's special and while it wasn't bad, the chop got to be a bit boring - it was a sizeable piece of meat. Also, the greens served with the veal had way too much pepper in it and the duck fat fries were bland.\n\nThat being said, my overall review is now 5 stars because each time I've been here, be it for a private event or for dinner or even at the bar, we've received excellent service and had wonderful experiences. I find the food to be delicious - the Spruce burger is one of my favorite burgers and is my go-to when I don't feel like having B spend a fortune on me ;).", "author": "Lisa C."}

And starting a yelp review with Whoo Hoo will make you think of a couple things.  1)  Bub Rub from Oakland and the whistle tips.  2)  another garrish, sophomoric, attention starved teeny bopper on yelp about to destroy the credibility of a fine restaurant with mindless blather about a bad blind date or 3)  Fishbits is excited for Spruce and his birthday.\n\nIf you thought 3, clap your hands to celebrate.  And truthfully, even if I was paying it would be 5 stars.\n\nLauren had called ahead on advice of a friend and secured the best four top in the restaurant.  Not sure what number it is, but it is the one to the left as you walk in, against the wall.  It gives you a view of the entire restaurant & bar.... which was great for people watching.  Of course, we sat together in the banquette seating all lovey dovey rather than sitting across from one another.  Those people that chose to sit that way looked boring and .... lifeless.\n\nA sommelier friend told us that we had to sample their Reislings, whether we wanted to or not.  It was perfect for our first course of a charcuterie plate with cornichons, stone ground mustard... w/ a duck pate, coppa, 2 types of salami, and \"fromage de tete\" (which always makes it sound better, eh?)  I might be forgetting something... whatever the case we got a half bottle of 2006 Emrich-Schonleber Monzinger Halenberg Reisling Spatlese.  It was perfect... not to sweet, but long on the palette.  \n\nIt held it tight as we sampled the meats, and made way for our \"Rocket\" and Watermelon Salad with Feta Cheese and Ice Wine Vinaigrette.  It was crisp, light, and perfect for this heavy meat dinner we took on... \n\nBecause at the same time we had the Hot and Cold Foie Gras, both which were an amazing treat, and created a complexity on the pallette moving from the hot and cold.  I really enjoyed the poached pluot, as well as the jelly cubed preserved pluot..... it was an incredible combination seeing the two identical things at odds, battling for my attention.  \n\nWe started our main courses with a half bottle of 2006 Domaine Louis Boillot Volnay Lew Grand Poisots.  We love old world, and wanted something a bit bigger than a cab... so a Burgundy it was, and it was fantastic, if not a teeny bit subdued.  \n\nLauren had the Duck.. which brought out more foie gras (and this is precisely when she went into a rich food coma for about 20 minutes).  Cinammon spiced Foie Gras and Poached Rhubarb with a honey laquered duck breast.  I think duck is a bit gamey, and too fatty... I don't like it, but the combination of flavours here definitely made it among the best I have ever tasted. \n\nIt is particularly pleasant not chewing down on buckshot when you take a bite. =)\n\nI had the special, which was a Veal T-Bone with greens.  I have never seen a piece of meat like this... it was at least 3 inches thick, and cooked perfectly... almost white as pork.  It was fantastic, and took 2 days to finish.  Nothing over the top or fancy with garnish here... it was a piece of perfectly cooked meat, no more no less.\n\nWe had a lot of fun with our server, Alvin (as he says the only Asian guy there) and Haley the sommelier.... it was obvious we were enjoying ourselves and doing what we came to do there.... eat well and live life, so it seems they wanted to celebrate with us...\n\nthey trumped our dessert prospects with an INCREDIBLE European cheese plate - \n1) European Cow - Sola Cal Casotto Cal Casotto, Piemonte, Italy\n2) European Sheep - Cana De Oveja, Murcia, Spain\n3) European Goat - Camilla, Piemonte, Italy\n4) European Blue - Valdeon, Leon, Spain\n5) European Cheedar - Montgomery's Cheddar, Neal's Yard, \n     Sommerset, England\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Haley brought out a 1961 Barbeito Malmsey Madiera.... something I never thought I would enjoy.  Madiera's are too sweet at times, or maybe I just use them for cooking... but she opened up my palette like I neve rexpected.  This was a huge, refined taste... with sweetness huddling towards oak... and a more smoky cognac flavour than syrupy coat that stays with your tongue.  It washed off fairly quickly, and the pairing with the cheeses just solidified how wonderful this place is.  \n\nNot to be outdone, of course, the server brought a petit fours with a candle, suggesting I must blow something out.\n\nOne of the best meals I have had in years, I have nothing but great things to say about the atmosphere, the food, and the people.  Well done all!", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

Ordered a delightful drink from the special cocktail menu that consisted of rose and pomegranate flavored liqueur mixed with sparkling wine. It was absolutely yummy to the maximum.  I wish I would've had four more :) \n\nWe were then seated in the fancy main dining room. The back wall is velvet and the bench we were sitting on was velvet. I, being extremely touchy feely, couldn't stop touching/rubbing the velvet bench throughout the entire meal.  Go figure.\n\nBack to the food...I have only heard amazing things about the Spruce burger, so after discussing with my family, we decided on that as one of our appetizers.  We asked the server if the chef would cut the burger 5 ways and he sure did!  It was so cute.  Cooked medium rare, the burger was awesome and served with duck fat French fries. Mmmmmm!!!! So good. I can't even describe how heavy the fries were, but I ate them anyways. Also started off with the goat cheese and cherry salad and gazpacho.  \n\nAmong the entrees were the Moroccan chicken, the ribeye special, 2 of the veal specials, and the halibut.  My favorite by far was the veal. So tender, minimum fat, and amazing flavors. \n\nService and ambiance were impeccable.

Just to sit in an ostrich-skin chair and look at the mohair-covered walls (you can actually hear the others at your table! shock!).\n\nEllen had an arugula salad with cherries and goat cheese which was delicious. Max didn't have an appetizer, so he got a demitasse of chilled asparagus and pea (we think) soup which was really great. I had nettle and garlic soup with a perfect poached egg. They set the bowl, with tiny garnishes of 1/4\" croutons, watercress leaves, etc. and then poured the hot bright green soup from a silver pitcher around the egg. Incredible. Incredible. Incredible. The flavor was so intense - it just tasted green. I'm not sure how to describe nettles - they just taste like green. And the contrast with the egg yolk and the vegetable flavor was velvety.\n \nMax had local swordfish and I can't remember what it was served with, but it was great. My poached sea bass was served with a sauce that had pureed artichokes and the water from cooking them - or something like that - and the fish was poached in the liquid as well. It had tiny artichoke hearts and perfect al dente garbanzo beans as garnish and the sauce was remarkable. \n \nNothing touched Ellen's amazing duck breast - HUGE slices of breast with a slab of seared foie gras on top with a rhubarb sauce. It was so delicious. She was happy to share it - it was enormous - and I wished I had ordered it.\n\nThe portions were large so no dessert, aside from the little marshmallows and cherry jellies that came with the check.

I must say, Spruce made my big birthday a happy one.  First off, I'd like to note how accommodating they were.  Were were running about 15 minutes late, yet they treated us in a very hospitable manner and promptly seated us.  The ambiance was lovely; clean, modern decor and low, warm light gave the space a classy, upscale feel.\n\nThe wait staff was the best!  Cheerful, patient, knowledgeable, and informative.  Our awesome waitress gave us wonderful recommendations as far as drinks. (the Pim's Cup is especially light and refreshing)  What I liked best was that my friend and I wanted to do starter, entree and dessert.  I especially liked that she gave us the option of having our meal served in courses like a tasting menu, which made for convenience and very pretty presentation.\n\nWe had the foie gras appetizer, the honey-lacquered duck breast, the filet of beef w/ duck fat fries, and the dark chocolate bread pudding with basil-olive oil ice cream.\n\nThe foie gras was served 2 ways, seared and torchon.  Both were perfect, although my only gripe would be that the portion was tiny for the price.  The honey-lacquered duck breast had amazing flavor, the meat was very moist and juicy.  The filet of beef had to be the best cut of filet I've ever had...and I've had good beef.  You could cut it with a butter knife using very little effort.  It had to be the tenderest, most velvety filet that ever melted in my mouth.  The bread pudding dessert is a chocolate lover's heaven.  Paired with the unique basil-olive oil ice cream, it made for a distinctively delicious tasting experience.

It's rare that a restaurant is both style forward and classic, but that's exactly how I would describe Spruce. The ambiance is dim and elegant - with a very attractive bar, interesting modern art, and a vaulted ceiling that makes the restaurant seem bigger than it is. \n\nI went to Spruce for a late dinner with my girlfriend 2 weeks ago and we both had an amazing time. Firstly, the food was as good as it gets - we shared the Lobster Ravioli and Foie Gras to start, both were extremely flavorful and the textures were amazing. The mains were equally spectacular - I had the Lobster and Alexa had the Duck Breast.\n\nA few other notes that enhanced the experienced:\n- We brought a good bottle of wine and the corkage was waived. This is very much appreciated - it's rare that restaurants will do this, but if you bring an unusually good bottle it's nice when the restaurant follows suit and doesn't hit you up for the extra 20.\n-We had 930 reservations, which is late, but there was absolutely zero pressure from the staff to speed up the pace.

We were treated to a wonderful ceremony of exchanging the wine glasses on the table for red wine glasses. Huh?\nThere is an  extensive wine list. It is very difficult to find decent wine under $80. As far as I could tell there was only one wine that was under $50. Is there still such a thing as an expense account where people will pay more than $400 for a bottle of wine when the world is awash great red wine under $40? \nThe food: My wife's food was excellent, green gazpacho which was delicious as well as a perfectly cooked duck also excellent. Mine was mediocre. A endive and carrot salad with some quinone for some reason was pushed to the side of a small bowl. A boring dressing did not help.\nThen we waited at least 45 minutes for our main course to come. No one offered us more bread. The server said that our entr\u00e9es would be up in a moment which stretched into another eight minutes because at this point we were keeping time. You would think at a restaurant of this caliber if your entr\u00e9es were delayed that someone would offer you a drink, a free dessert, or some kind of an apology. Nothing. My skate wing floating in some broth was simply undistinguished and not worth the $36. As we had now been there for two hours we decided to pass on dessert. It really was an unpleasant experience.

Not a loud, trendy hot spot; most of the diners appeared to be well over 40 and the atmosphere was quieter. Each dish we had was made with high quality ingredients, beautifully presented, and delicious. \n\nMy main complaint? Over-priced. \n\nI loved the amuse bouche we were served; I would describe it as a bite-sized cheesy biscuit puff. Scrumptious. I had the special salad of the evening - an amazing heirloom tomato salad with olive oil, basil leaves and burrata cheese. The flavors were vibrant, fresh and incredible. However, the $20 price tag nearly knocked me out of my chair as I did not know that was the cost until the check arrived.\n\nThe selections from the bar menu, which can be ordered in the dining room, were much more reasonably priced and really delicious. My $14 burger with gruyere cheese, sliced avocado, and homemade pickled vegetables was very juicy and tasty. The bun was soft and yummy. The french fries were crispy and nicely seasoned. My husband ordered the caesar salad for his appetizer and it was damn good and not overdressed. \n\nMy husband's butter poached lobster with gnocchi was very pretty, slightly under-seasoned and almost over-cooked. The portion size was rather small. Not really worth $40.\n\nWe shared the beignets for dessert and they were basically delicious donut holes with a chocolate citrus dipping sauce (only okay for us, probably because we are not crazy about chocolate and citrus together) and vanilla dipping sauce (scrumptious). \n\nThe service was polite and present but not over-bearing. Our water glasses were always full and they were generous with the dinner rolls. \n\nGood food but in general very expensive for what you get.", "author": "Jenny K."}

The interior decor was dark, intimate and on the posh side (reminded me of a fancy NYC restaurant or high-end steak house).  The gougeres they offered were light and delicious.  The duck pate appetizer was delicious and I had a lobster special that was extremely savory with a wonderful recommended wine pairing - the lobster was nicely presented and the taste was definitely worthy of a Michelin star.  We had a slight snafu with our dessert wine, so on top of our shared dessert they sent us home with some fresh-baked cookies and extra treats - excellent customer service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-29", "description": "I am utterly shocked by the high praise heaped upon this restaurant. My first time there was about three years ago and I was underwhelmed by the food, but thought the problem was the dish I ordered. I went again last night with a friend visiting from out of town, figuring this dinner would be the culmination of a weekend of fabulous food: dinners at Chiaroscuro and Piperade and brunch on Saturday at Nopa. We ate lightly on Sunday in anticipation of our meal at Spruce.\n\nFirst, the interior \"ain't all that.\" I know art is in the eye of the beholder, but I wondered WTF a picture of an Adidas t-shirt was doing on the wall. The leather on the backs of the dining room chairs was sagging, as if the chairs weren't all that well made and weren't holding up. The solid cocoa brown interior with dark wood furniture made the restaurant feel somber. Cool chandelier made from wine bottles, though. A beautiful flower arrangement in the dining room could have livened things up.\n\nI wanted a glass of red wine with an earthy undertone. The waitperson brought me a taste of a wine she recommended, and although it wasn't what I had in mind, I liked it and ordered a glass. My friend wasn't so fortunate. She asked our waitperson for a cocktail recommendation: she wanted \"something made with brown alcohol but not too sweet.\" The \"Whiskey Smash\" was suggested. My friend didn't particularly like it after her first sip and put it aside. During the entire meal, the waitperson, her \"assistant\" (that's the word she used to describe him), a guy I assumed was a manager and the sommelier all visited our table, but no one ever asked her if there was an issue with her barely-touched cocktail.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the rolls were nicely warmed, but the quality was slightly better than supermarket Parker rolls. The interior was dry and made me wonder if perhaps they don't get a fresh bread delivery on Sundays.\n\nWe ordered an off-menu appetizer special: baby mustard greens with blue cheese, speck (Prosciutto-like ham), figs and what was described as \"lavosh-type\" crackers. The greens were interesting in that they had a frisee-like texture and a little bite. I think they would have been terrific, finely chopped and sprinkled over a butter lettuce salad or as garnish on a soup. The blue cheese was described as originating in Wisconsin and aged in a California cave (huh?!). It tasted like a blue cheese you could pick up at Trader Joe's (no disrespect to TJ's intended!). The figs were grilled Mission figs, nothing to write home about. The \"lavosh\" was sweet and looked and tasted like a cookie. No two ingredients in this dish tasted good together.  The manager (again, I'm not completely sure that was his role) came over to ask if we liked the salad, and since he asked, I told him what we didn't like about it (pretty much everything) and provided suggestions as to how it might be improved. We never saw that guy again, although to be fair, the appetizer was removed from our bill.\n\nWe also shared another appetizer, a summer vegetable salad, made with Little Gem romaine, hazelnuts, Pecorino and a Romesco sauce. Another case of the elements of the dish not really complementing one another, although each item was tasty.\n\nWhile we were sharing our appetizers, the sommelier stopped by to ask if I wanted a refill on my wine. I thought I'd give it another shot and again requested an earthy red. He brought me two tastes, neither of which was particularly earthy, but again, nothing wrong with them so I selected one to have with dinner.\n \nFor our main courses, I ordered the pork tenderloin with pork belly and my friend ordered the short ribs. The pork belly was excellent! It was crispy on top with a firm interior and amazing flavor. The pork tenderloin, although tender and perfectly cooked, wasn't particularly exciting (I kept thinking about a pork chop I had for dinner at Nopa a couple of months ago that has set a new pork dish standard). The pork medallions were served on a bed of shelling beans which were a little firm for my taste. I would have liked the bean interiors to be a bit creamier. I'd ordered the short ribs my other time at Spruce and was unimpressed, but I didn't say anything to my friend, since I honestly figured they'd be great this time. She had the same complaint I had three years ago: although served in a tasty sauce, the meat itself was stringy and dry. She actually said they were the worst short ribs she'd ever had.\n\nAfter such a mediocre meal, we didn't bother with desert. Our tab came to $134 before the tip and after the special blue cheese & speck appetizer had been removed. If you're in that neighborhood, I'd recommend Garibaldi's instead, or leave Presidio Heights behind and head over to Nopa. Either way, you'll get superior food and ambiance and spend a heck of a lot less money. Oh, and my dog loved the left over ($31!!!!!) short ribs.", "author": "Veronika P."}

No complaints- cooked perfectly, excellent flavor, etc.  When it was time for dessert, I wanted another foie gras but my friend was too embarrassed to let me order it so we went with the pineapple upside-down cake (YUM- carmelized pineapple on top) and the beignets served with chocolate and vanilla dipping sauces.

There is a bit of a theme and creativity with their dishes, but the drawback of this place was that I really felt the food was good but overpriced for its execution.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the dinner rolls. Yes, that's right the dinner rolls were in my opinion...horrible. The complimentary puffs they served were bland and unappealing. However our Morrocan goat dish, sweet corn ravioli appetizer, and foie gras appetizer, as well as the steak with duck fries were superb. Disappointing was the fact that my fries were cold. The flavors I can tell are creative and potentially mouth watering, the problem stems from the timing of execution and delivery. \n\nI left food on the table and was resolved for heading back to my hotel early. I might try again, for I can see the intent and somewhat taste what should have been absolutely exquisite.\n\nNevertheless it fell short. I recently ate at Elements Kitchen in Pasadena and felt like I had a better over all experience. Spruce would have blown them a way had a few things gone a bit smoother. \n\nThe \"fun\" and \"creativity\" of preparing an element three ways is lost in translation...because of the execution at the tail end. A wide selection of drinks and wine perhaps make up for this short coming in the palettes of others, but not for me. If I am to shell out good money then I expect great food. XIV serves great food, Marche Mardon served great food, Orsay and Sublime were exquisite. Perhaps they can learn from Yank Sing in their execution of the dining experience.", "author": "Jeffrey W."}

From ambiance, to clientele, to service, Spruce is a step-up from the rest, and I can't help but elaborate about every dish consumed.\n\n* Bay Scallops - orgasmic combination of flavors. As a scallop lover, this is on my top 2 SF scallop dishes (L'ardois is divine as well). Appetizer portion w/ a caviar & cream base, that was so decadent and delicious I was tempted to lick the plate right up.\n* Roasted Butternut Squash Soup - whipped froth above a creamy, flavorful squash puree. (a favorite)\n* Panna Cotta (amuse bouche) - creamy, salty, with a hint of herb - this was a top 3 starter we had.\n* Winter Harvest Salad - nice sharp crunch, refreshing vinaigrette, hazelnuts added interesting flavor\n* Crispy Sweetbreads - Unlike my expectation, evidently a \"sweetbread\" is a mini chicken nugget like dish. Similar in flavor to an asian chicken, it is rich, dense, and comes with a an over easy hen egg - definitely an item that's meant to be shared. \n* Pacific Sablefish (w/o skin) - Can fish be creamy? Because this fillet definitely was. Melt in your mouth goodness, and all the accoutrements really complemented the dish. I have to note, the bright green caper \"pudding\" (similar to an aioli) really made the dish shine. Perfect meld of savory, tangy goodness - YUM i would eat this daily if I could. \n* Grilled Bavette Steak -  Just had a small bite of the steak but heard it was rich, full of flavor, perfectly moist (at medium) and would order again. \n\n* Irish Root Beer Float - Desert? I was so stuffed at this point that i could've just passed. But as a lover of all things sweet, had to give it a try.  The desert was more bitter than I was expecting, but the crunchy toffee was great & we happily slurped this right up.  (Next time I'll try the beignets).\n\nIn Summary - Spruce is an excellent place to take a hot date, impress clients, or just have some really good food.  You're guaranteed great service, and an overall experience that leaves little to be desired. Although pricey, you won't be disappointed. Spruce provided the complete 360 experience and I hope to be back soon.", "author": "Renae K."}

But anyway -\n\nThe restaurant itself is dimly lit & cozy, done in dark polished wood & fancy-looking furniture.  We're definitely talking white table cloths, full place settings, & a candle on every table.  Our reservation was at 8:15, & though the seven of us started trickling in around 8ish, we were still seated right away & started salivating over the cocktail, wine, & food menus.  (I pretty much wanted everything.)  Sadly, we ended up sitting for a while before anyone came over to take our drink orders (though we all got water right away, so props to those guys).\n\nAll of us ordered cocktails, which took some time to make, but that should be expected anywhere where you're paying $10-12 per (not to mention that there were seven of us).  Super sexy!!  And we are all pretty much cocktail snobs.  The Elderflower Daquiri, La Fresa Fresca, and Pharao's Gold are all particularly recommended.  They even did the whole fancy cocktail service thing where the mixed drinks are shaken and poured at your table.\n\nI'm pretty sure I could have ordered anything on the menu & been enormously happy with it - everything I tasted was amazing.  Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the food & answered a ton of questions about what was in different dishes & how they were prepared (not to mention super friendly and clearly enjoying his job).\n\nAppetizers:\n\nWe started with a delicious charcuterie plate of 7 different meats, which came with stone-ground mustard and a basket of fancy toast.  Win!\n\nNettles & garlic soup - in the words of one of my dining companions who also ordered it, \"quite possibly the greenest thing I've ever eaten.\"  I was a little afraid it would be super-garlicky, but it was actually pretty light and mild.  Really good, though, and poured at the table into a bowl of delicious stuffs.\n\nCarrot soup - much thicker and richer, and with an excellent carrot flavor.  I'm not a huge carrot fan, but it was still pretty tasty.\n\nOther things that I didn't get to sample but were reportedly amazing include the carmelized dayboat scallops and the French omelette.\n\nDinner:\n\nGrilled yellowtail with blood oranges - perfectly grilled, quite tasty & tender.  The blood oranges were delicious and went really well with the fish.\n\nPork tenderloin with pork belly - that was some AMAZING pork.  Goddam.  Didn't taste the beans but they were reportedly excellent as well.\n\nYoung spring lamb 3 ways w/ vegetables - I tasted the rack and another medium-rare cut (there was also belly); oh man.  Wow.  Perfectly cooked.  Flavorful, tender, lamb-y, and with some reportedly amazing jus & new potatoes.\n\nPresentation was excellent; they even did the thing were multiple servers come out at once and set all your meals down at the same time, which was awesome.\n\nWine:\n\nThey have a ton.  Seriously.  A metric fuck-ton, in all probability.  I mean it's just kind of absurd.   The nice thing is that there is a pretty wide range in terms of price, from the reasonably-priced bottles on the \"Reds Under $60\" and \"Whites Under $60\" pages, to truly ridiculous ones going for 4 figures.  Fortunately, their sommelier was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and just as happy to recommend a modestly-priced bottle as something more fancy.  We ended up getting a very nice Riesling to go with soups & appetizers for about $72 (I think) and were extremely happy with it, and a very dry, very earthy, very French Cotes-du-Rhone from the \"$60 and under\" page for dinner (mostly to go with the birthday boy's lamb, which it did, extraordinarily well).\n\nDesserts:\n\nChocolate brownie w/ hazelnuts (I think) - wow.  I am not normally a chocolate fan, and this was fantastic, especially with the hazelnuts.\n\nBanana cake w/ chocolate mousse & lime sorbet - really nice!  Went exceptionally well with both of the rums that were ordered, and the lime sorbet (extremely limey) was a nice contrast to the sweet/chocolate of the cake (which wasn't really cake).\n\nI also had a glass of dessert muscat that was good, but not the best I had (less apricot & more floral).\n\nAlas, the bill-paying process ended up taking a long time; our server disappeared right when we were ready to pay, so we ended up waiting 10-15 minutes for him to come get it.  Like the waiting for drinks at the beginning of the meal, not a huge deal, but if we went again, I'd hope this isn't the norm.\n\nAll told, it ended up being about $120 a head for cocktails, wine, appetizers, dinner, dessert, tax, & tip.  Not bad AT ALL!!  So, 5 stars for food, drink, atmosphere, & value, but service could be improved.  If I could give it 4.5, I would.

We ended up dining in the main dining area (rather than at the bar) and having a full meal with wine/cocktails.  We split the burger and the pasta dish.  The burger was not particularly good, and came on a dry crumbly bun.  The pasta seems like it could have been better, but instead of letting the flavors shine, the chef just phoned it in and drowned everything in butter.  The service was almost non-existent at a couple crucial  times as well (eventually had to get a busboy to find the waiter to be able to get another glass of wine).   We've been to a lot of the best restaurants in the city - some fancy, some not, and we both agreed that Spruce wasn't worth coming too.  With the high pricing and the nice dining room, they are positioning themselves as a high end restaurant, but it seems like it's all flash and they aren't backing it up with particularly good food. In our case we also got sub-par service, but I\"m guessing that was unusual. I feel bad giving 1-star, because no one was mean or anything like that, but it was a disappointing dining experience that was a waste of money that could have been spent at so many more deserving restaurants, so I thought I'd do my yelpy duty and throw my 2-cents in, even if it gets lost in the other ratings.", "author": "L C."}

I remember the good old days in college when I worked District 1 for Gavvy's mayoral campaign and I'd spend hours camped in front of the Books Inc. or the Calmart trying to get people (mostly young, blonde mothers with strollers) to give us their personal information so we could later call them and ask for donations. 'Twas not easy. \n\nSo I was tickled to discover that Spruce is only one block from familiar territory. I picked the place for my BFF's birthday- mostly because the Chronicle's Top 100 review described the decor as \"masculine\" and I felt he needed more masculine influence in his life. Spruce did not dissapoint. I believe the walls were all leather, furniture all dark wood. \n\nWe didn't have reservations on a Saturday night, but we were seated pretty promptly (although we had another friend stop in to put our names down) in the bar area. The three of us were seated in a space probably intended for two people, so be prepared to get cozy. However, service was still great. We were brought plenty of bread, given good wine recommendations, and checked in with frequently. \n\nNow, the food: 1) Charcuterie platter ($18) - so-so, about 3-4 pieces of each selection (a rabbit rillete, assorted smoked meat, pate and gele, pickles, mustard, with grilled bread), 2) Sweet Corn Ravioli ($15) - this is a small plate, a starter, and came with about 5-6 ravioli. Corn is in season, you can't do this dish wrong, 3) Duck breast topped with grilled duck liver ($38) - what is this, the Chez Pannisse cafe? How can you charge $38 for duck in this economy?! This duck was well-cooked and the liver was a very, very nice touch on top, but I think I'm tired of the sweet sauces often used with duck. I had a glass of Pinot ($11) and the BFF, the rose ($9?). The Pinot went great with the meal. \n\nOverall, Spruce is solid, manly fine-dining. It's fine-dining your UFC watching boyfriend can handle. But if I had to do it all over again, I'd sit at the bar and take advantage of the bar menu instead of splurging on the relatively unremarkable entrees.", "author": "Lydia C."}

The housemade croutons were delicious, and the dressing was creamy and tasty.  A good portion size as well.\n\nI ordered the Braised Short Ribs and my boyfriend ordered the Bavette Steak.  The short ribs were like butter--so tasty and tender!  \n\nAfter all of this, I ordered a pot of coffee and we shared the trio of ice creams.

I had heard so much about their burger (one of my companions is a burger nut), that I called ahead to make sure that the burger could be ordered in the dining room and not just the lounge.  \n\nThe space itself is really impressive and is so spacious that it is hard to believe that Spruce is in SF and not in sprawling LA.  My friends joked that Spruce is perfect for special occasions because the chairs are humongous and look more like thrones - obviously this was perfect for my birthday!  Our reservation was super early on a Friday, so the place was fairly empty, and filled with an older crowd.  I ordered the butter poached lobster and the dish did not disappoint!  Of course it is pretty hard to not love lobster poached in butter - come on!  But I was happy that the portion was pretty generous, no one wants to order lobster and get stuck with 4-5 tasty bites wishing for more.  As expected, my friend had the burger and enjoyed it, however he did not think that it was the best burger in the city (that distinction goes to Marlowe and Nopa).

Every time I walk in the door, I get the same kind of jitters that I get when talking to a very beautiful person. I can't remember what I'm saying, and I tend to look at the floor. Looking at the floor does not help in this situation, as it is also impeccable.\n\nI've had a previous bar visit with terrific service, and a dinner visit with less that excellent service. Service on our latest visit was extremely attentive and informed. \n\nSo what's with the three star review? My husband and I live close by, and want so badly to love this restaurant. The service is great, and it has been so fussed over. It's just not for us. \n\nWe ate: Seared Dayboat Scallops, followed by Sweetbreads Lyonnaise, followed by entrees - Buttered Maine Lobster for me and Red Snapper for husband. \n\nWe drank - 2 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine. We are not heavy drinkers. I had a Honey Elderflower Daquiri and my husband drank a Sazarac. We both drank glasses of the Roland Schmitt Alsace. \n\nI loved my cocktail and would have been happy to have several more. That would have been a terrible decision, but it was absolutely a perfect drink: not sweet, but delicate. I loved our wine with the lobster. I picked it, and I don't know that it was actually a good choice, but I very much enjoyed it.\n\nAs for the food, I should say that none of this was actually bad. I just did not like it. I think our scallops were meant to be served cold, but I did not find it pleasing. I have not had sweetbreads before this occasion, but was hoping for something more flavorful, with more texture. I found these a little lifeless. Lobster, is, of course, lobster - and therefore excellent by nature. I did not find that much else to recommend the dish. My husband seemed to like his snapper, but was not terrifically excited about it. \n\nI think Spruce is a wonderful place to take a date. The romance is palpable. If I wasn't already married, I'm sure I would have been swept away. The food would not have mattered at all. They would have had me at the hobnailed chairs. As it is, however, I am married, and I'm kind of particular about what I put in my mouth.", "author": "H G."}

The graduate hosting this cocktail party said this was her absolute favorite restaurant in SF - and I can definitely see why!\n\nPROS:\n-AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE! The place is very upscale looking, with modern decor, dimly lit, valet parking and a door attendent....but not pretentious. Very intimate. Don't even think of wearing your sneakers and hoodie here - you better be dressed to impress! This is definitely a place to come to celebrate or to go to for a special occasion.\n-FOOD: Ohmygoodness! It was amazing, really! The fries and special dipping sauce (perhaps chipotle?) were simply addicting...I ate way too many. I wish I could remember the names of all the hors d'oeurves that were served. Either way, doesn't matter, they were savory and simply mouth watering. I was very impressed. Since I do not drink alcohol, they suggested I try a \"spritzer\" which is basically a virgin berry mojito... it is SO GOOD! If you go here, order it! I also was particularly fond of their warm beignets with a vanilla and chocolate dipping sauce, they were heavenly....my mouth is watering right now just thinking of them.\n-SERVICE: The service was excellent, perhaps that was because the servers (who were walking around the cocktail reception) quickly learned that I was eager to try almost anything they offered me. What can I say? I love food! Drinks took a little bit of time to get, but it was graduation weekend and a Saturday evening...they were packed, I understand.\n\nCONS:\n-PRICEY if you are on a budget. But if you are on a budget like we are (student family), then it's worth saving up to go here for a special occasion. If you have the money, then go.\n-Not very convenient to get to by public transit from East Bay, but definitely worth it. If you are travelling with a group, you could BART to SF and taxi from the BART to the restaurant if you don't feel like taking the bus.\n\nOVERALL: If I had to sum up this place in one word, that word would be.... FOODGASM. All 5 of my senses (taste, smell, touch, sight - and even sound) were completely overstimulated (but in a good way) at Spruce. I look forward to saving my pennies to come back here for a proper sit down meal...and when I do, you'll be the first to hear about it!", "author": "Janaia R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-24", "description": "My desire to try Spruce was sparked by a recent ROTD.  Odd I know, from Suan's sensual review, that I would want my parents to take me here, but I only know a few gents that would take me here without expectations!  \n\nFrom the moment I walked in I knew it was going to be a very pleasant experience.  My father on the other hand, probably was thinking \"how much is this going to cost me?!\" A common gripe of his, but as soon as he gets a beer or scotch he forgets about cost, thank goodness.\n\nCalling the space aesthetically pleasing would be an understatement to me.  I loved the aesthetics!  If was to hire a decorator for my place I would say, \"Please be inspired by the d\u00e9cor of Spruce\".  The masculinity of the dining room with its classic leather chairs with nail head trim, crystal candle holders and expressive art was *definitely* sexy.  I digress...\n\nWe arrived late, around 6:20pm, for our 5:45pm reservation (which I made over a month ago and was the only option) and the hostess, a fellow So Cal native, was super friendly and not at all perturbed by our late arrival.  \n\nWe took our time settling in and perused the drink list, and at 65+ pages, it took some time.  We paused at the Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e from Montrachet, and were tempted, but at $4950 a bottle we decide to keep our selection in the more economic price range.  \n\nI started off the evening with a glass of Delamotte Champagne ($15), my mother enjoyed a glass of Heron Merlot ($9), and my father enjoyed a foreign draft beer selection, his selection escapees me, but he said it was similar to Shimay.  He was happy, so all was right in the world.\n\nBread circled, I passed, then an expeditor delivered Gruyere puffs, and I couldn't say no.  A few minutes after enjoying those, our appetizer, Dayboat Scallops with braised artichokes, arrived.  They were perfectly split in three separate bowls and were amazing!  With in minutes of finishing our scallops the consomm\u00e9 arrived, fantastic!  \n\nFor dinner we ordered a bottle of Provenance Merlot from Napa ($42).  I really had my eye on the Caymus Special Selection, but my mom has never been one to really sip wine so, I let it go.  It was a good thing because we ended up having more than just a bottle.  \n\nFor our entrees I talked my mom into sharing the Tomahawk bone-in Rib eye and I was a bit disappointed.  I was expecting more flavor from a bone-in steak and I felt this one was a bit under par.  We decided on the smaller portion ($75) which was sized perfectly for the two of us.  The accompaniments were delicious, fingerling potatoes lightly salted and saut\u00e9ed chard.  My father enjoyed the Charred Berkshire Pork Tenderloin ($28).  It was fantastic!  I also really enjoyed the crispy pork belly; there is a first time for everything.   \n\nAfter dinner I enjoyed a glass of Fonseca's 20 year Tawny ($16) and an espresso with my birthday dessert, the Piedmont Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse with Manjari ice cream ($10).  I was a decent dessert but I really had my heart set on something tart.  I should have gone with my gut and ordered the Meyer Lemon Tart, next time.\n\nOver all, it was a fabulous experience from beginning to end.  I love multiple course meals that take hours upon hours to complete.  I've dined at many high-end restaurants around the world and Spruce is definitely in my top five.  The service was impeccable without being overbearing!  Something I do not find too often. \n\nWith that being said...visiting again is a non negotiable...I *will* be back, it's just a matter of when!", "author": "Sofia H."}

Have to say the smaller plates can outshine the entrees in terms of interest and innovative flavors.\n\nIf you come for dinner be prepared for $30+ entrees and pricey (though amazing) wine selection in a 50 page leather BINDER of wine and spirits.  Service is very proper (verging on stuffy) but fitting for a place with high-end decor and style.  Extremely knowledgeable staff that enjoys the finer points of dining and service.\n\nBEST burger in the bay area. Sure its $14 but you also get the BEST fries in the bay area! be sure to ask about the options which they may not mention: foie gras(!), mushrooms, caramelized onions... pretty much anything you can come up with.\n\nThe charcuterie platter is something special and priced very reasonably, though gets 2nd place to Perbacco's in SF.  \n\nDrinks are smaller than average for the price but they do have an unbelievable liquor selection and some of the most practiced and professional bartenders. \n\nCan be difficult to get a reservation but try showing up at 5:30pm or 9:30pm and sitting at the bar--perhaps more comfortable than the dining room and features the same menu and pristine service.", "author": "Matt S."}

Felt more festive in there compared to the main room. All this and complimented by a very friendly & professional staff. \n\nThe highlight for me was the foie gras presented seared and poached. The strawberry compote was a brilliant choice. It was so good and found it very hard to share this dish.

Now this is what steak is supposed to look and taste like. It was juicy and truly memorable. Served with sauteed Swiss chard and crispy  fingerling potatoes.  Also had a taste of the charred pork tenderloin which was amazing. Definitely getting that on the next visit. \n\nTheir beignets w/ semisweet chocolate sauce was not only the best ones out there, but they were also very generous with their serving.

I called semi-last minute and got a table (score). We were seated in the \"library\" but I happen to love that room (in the front, more intimate, and accented by a large roaring fire). You can actually hear yourself talk in that room and it feels more special to me than the larger, darker room that adjoins the bar. \n\nThe service is really quite good. There is little lag time between getting seated and having fresh warm bread and tall glasses of water placed in front of you. The menu is always changing and offers a really nice selection of seasonal favorites. I also like the wine list and find the prices are very reasonable - especially on the half bottles (my bf doesn't drink). \n\nThe bar can get a bit hectic but if you're willing to sidle up to strangers and worm your way into the front of the queue to get the bartender's attention, you'll really enjoy your drink, guaranteed. \n\nWorth checking out if you haven't already.", "author": "Carrie S."}

So we finally got an updated reservation in January we were elated. I'd many times passed by the outside of the restaurant wistfully looking in due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews from yelpers and friends. \n\nOne disappointment which didn't influence my rating but made me sad was to see a dude waltzing up to the door in sneakers and another male patron inside with a hockey jersey on. With all the information available nowadays, do your research! It's a nice restaurant - at least wear dress shoes and a button down shirt dudes!\n\nOk back to the review - I'll start with why I gave it 5 stars even though I contemplated giving it 4. It's gets 5 stars for the good food complimented by the good service, the latter matters A LOT to me. We were seated around 6p on a Saturday and yes the restaurant was quiet so there was no excuse for poor service. But even throughout the night (and we were there for about 2.5 hours) while the restaurant became packed, we never felt neglected or had to wait very long for our orders. The staff was extremely helpful in providing information on wine suggestions and pairings that I was very impressed. Perhaps the only thing about the service that was overwhelming is that at times there were servers walking up and down past the tables checking to clear them. It made the aisles too packed and crowded. \n\nNow on to the food. (New) American food is not my favourite. I think the menu in general wasn't new and exciting on paper - a lot of items felt \"been there and ate that\". But I did not let that deter me from enjoying the meal. After all, the descriptions don't reflect how the food will taste. The breads that they started us with - dinner rool and cranberry loaf were fresh and well made. The butters (yes there was more than one) made me want to stay there forever. I don't like very sweet items but the cinnamon butter should be at every breakfast place is America. For starters, the charcuterie plate was divine and I will guiltily admit that we also had the fois gras plate too (I know I lost 5 years) paired with one of the most delicious Rieslings I've ever had. Off to a great start! The main courses were ok - my bf's duck was cooked perfectly but he actually didn't like the huckleberries with it. My pork tenderloin and belly were good but I have had better so it was satisfying but disappointing compared to the starters. The dessert menu was also ok but I love sorbets and usually fancy pancy restaurants will have some interesting flavours. And they did not disappoint on that - I really loved the concord grape sorbet :) And after such a heavy meal, the sorbet really was refreshing.\n\nI loved the ambiance - the lighting is dim but has a cozy feel. The ceiling is high despite having a lot of staff on the floor, the tables are arranged apart enough to have privacy. \n\nAfter dinner we decided to walk home on the beautiful night and start to work off the calories :)", "author": "Janelle C."}

Seriously, someone needs to roll out an explanation for what they are trying to do in this place.  Have now been there 2 times...about a year apart...and the first trip was great.  The second trip...last night...not good.  Here are the details:\n\nFirst of all, the place always looks great.  No issue there.  But when it came to the menu...underwhelming across the board.  To really get to the core of it, it boiled right down to prep first and taste shortly thereafter.  To be clear, nothing was awful, but nothing was worth the prices paid at Spruce.  To be completely clear...this isn't about Spruce being an expensive restaurant.  This is about getting what you are GOING THERE FOR.  Which, if you are spending $200+, you should be getting both an experience and a meal.\n\nFirst problem was with my pork tenderloin/pork belly (reportedly a Specialty of the House).  It was dry.  Flat out no other way to describe it but dry.  It had all the potential in the world and you could see it could be a very tasty an flavorful dish, but it was dry enough to just be less than OK.  The nettles with green garlic soup and poached egg was fairly bland and came off as just a bit boring.  The halibut was pretty good...no real complaints there.\n\nThe dessert menu was bizarre.  Literally no other way to describe it.  Just flat out bizarre.  I believe there are 7 items on the dessert menu with one of them being the cheese selection (probably the right way to go given the selections).  An example of what we thought were truly bizarre pairings: banana cake/mousse with lime sorbet?  We tried it...not great in our opinion.\n\nOne thing I do like, and is probably apparent in some of my other reviews, is when people/businesses do the right thing.  No question our waiter did the right thing as when we inquired about the desserts, he brought us the one he was recommending (even though we had just ordered ice cream) since he had known the pork was a little dry.  So in that respect, one of two things deserves praise: the waiter making his own call and doing the right thing, or management being smart enough to empower their employees on the floor to make these types of decisions.\n\nI will definitely go back to Spruce, but come on guys...this was a pretty poor effort last night in terms of prep, ingredient pairings, and dessert selection.", "author": "Matt B."}

Best food I've had in San Francisco\n\nMy friend took me for a birthday dinner on a Saturday evening -- we arrived late for an SF dinner, around 9:30pm.  We actually wanted to sit at the bar, and fortunately two ladies let us take their seats.\n\nMy first drink was the Pharoah's Gold, a brandy base with interesting spices, chamomile, honey, and lemon (I think) -- very well done and surprisingly delicious.  My friend went off-menu (though apparently it used to be on it) with the Bee's Knees (and I have no idea what it was except it's tart and yummy)\n\nI can't comment enough about the bartenders, who certainly were our entertainment of the night.  One was outregeous and flamboyant, borderline certifiable but harmless and very fun.  Other two were courteous and helpful, but friendly and personable.  Would caveat that my friend certainly fanned the fire with the first one, and not everyone would have had this service experience or loved it.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but we had great help when we provided general direction on what we wanted.  We were also happy to taste a few, and frankly with the prices, doing a flight of mix and match is not unreasonable here.\n\nFor starters, we went with the more adventurous of our selections at the goading of our bartender, pig ear terrine.  There is a bit of texture that comes with eating cartiledge but yummy saltiness and good with spread.  My friend had a good Caesar salad, while my red pumpkin soup was delectable -- it had an airy-ness that I have never tasted before, and with a soup that seems so thick from appearances.  Golden with dollop of cream and chestnuts, but almost mousse-like in texture.  Amazing.\n\nI had the pork tenderloin with pork belly and beans, which was perfectly done and rich and wonderful.  My friend's steak, just over rare, was delicious as well.\n\nWe had dessert, which was completely unnecessary though highly enjoyable -- beignets that came in a basket (6 or 8 I think) with chocolate sauce and creme anglais.  Also had some sweet Madeira that was a great cap to the meal.\n\nAbout the scene -- not sure what happens in the dining room, but some fascinating people at the bar.  It's a classy bar, people are not standing around, but friendly with some great banter on all sides.  We chat with a psychotherapist about work crises, a lovely couple returning from a benefit, and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a hipster NYer who was contemplating a return West.

Hostess was very friendly.  Waiter was quite professional.  Incredible layers of flavors.  They knew we were sharing everything, and they split everything for us, including the soup and the salad, both of which together looked like more than the sum of the single portions we saw at other tables.  A nice touch.  \n\nNettle soup with green garlic:  bright and dark green colored, could have used more garlic flavor but delicious nonetheless.  Side of fries:  delicious without being overly greasy. Harvest vegetable salad with thinly shaved ribbons of fennel, carrots, peas, on some delightful light avocado puree: tasted like we were eating out of someone's bestest freshest garden.  Braised lamb wrapped in homemade pasta sheet: a bit on the overly sweet side for my dining partner, but perfect for me, so rich and buttery with each bite.  Excellent selection of coffees and teas.

The menu could do with a few more options at this price point, but I also understand food cost controls in this economy.  I brought some wine so I did not review the wine list. \n\nIf you're looking for a special night out with a big overstuffed chair clubby feel without being overwhelmed by a huge noisy dining room, then Spruce is a great choice.\n\nOn the downside I would be remiss if I didn't share that I felt $30 corkage is a bit steep. $20 and perhaps limiting the number of bottles based on the size of your party should be the max. Anything more is just robbery.

There was also an epic screw up with a birthday surprise that was terrible. I was taking my boyfriend for his birthday and he kept joking that he was turning 25. So I got two candles to put into our desert (the cheese) but they were put backwards (52)!!! He does have mostly grey hair but is no where near 52 years old! He thought it was funny but I was so bummed that my fun candles had become a potential insult towards him. Hopefully Spruce will do better next time.", "author": "Sharon C."}

There was a lapse in the quality of service during the most recent visit to Spruce and they made up for it in a professional way that reflects well upon their consistency of service.  At the beginning the most recent lunch, I informed the hostess, Amber, that I had a reservation for lunch.  I had shown up 15 minutes early.   There was no queue or waiting around of many people around the host's desk.  Amber said that the dining room was full, but that I could be seated immediately in the lounge. I isaid that I would be willing to wait for a table in the dining room.  25 minutes pass by and I am still waiting to be seated.   When I approach Amber, she apologized and said she had completely forgotten about seating me.   I was irritated when I was finally seated and saw at least 5 empty tables  - the restaurant cleared very rapidly over the 25 minutes I was waiting needlessly.  I complained to the general manager immediately and asked for a complimentary glass of wine for the lapse in quality  of service.  The general manager acknowledged the oversight, apologized, then comped me for the cheapest glass of wine by the glass and a cookie.  Those little extensions of courtesy were appreciated and I will continue my personal ritual at Spruce since they made up for the lapse in quality of service.", "author": "Lark A."}

The service is absolutely amazing. The restaurant has very interesting pieces of art and one that stood out was a photograph (very large on the wall behind me) of a person wearing an Adidas shirt. I'm not sure why it was placed there. Anyways, we started with the gnocchi in a ragu bolognese sauce. This was a pretty average dish, in my opinion. The bolognese wasn't really to my liking, but I'm a huge gnocchi fan, so I ate it all. Next, we had the chicken waldorf salad and the crispy duck confit with huckleberries and honey jus. Both were outstanding. The chicken that came with the salad was enormous and juicy. The duck confit was beautifully crisp and the huckleberries really added a lot of flavor to each bite. I ordered a Dunn 03 cab with my dish...it might have been one of the best wines ever. (it better have been for $30 a glass). Then we had the beignets with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. This was to die for!. I have had different kinds of beignets, and this was definitely one of my faves. They were so warm and soft in the middle with the perfect slight crunch and the right amount of sugar on the outside. The chocolate sauce was very rich and thick, and the creme anglaise...well..I'm going to salivate over the thought of the creme anglaise..yummm.

I was wearing my newest Tory Burch tunic and I ran into ALL of my bestest Pac/Laurel/Presidio Heights socialite friends, and there was table-hopping and air-kissing, and we were drinking Romanee-Conti, and it was SO expensive, but it didn't matter cause these REALLY cute i-bankers were treating, and we ordered this AMAZING duck that the chef probably caught himself, no, he probably RAISED it himself too, and it's probably an organic and sustainable and biodynamic duck, cause that's ALL the rage right now, never mind that I don't even EAT duck cause it's SO fattening, but anyway, on the way out I saw Gavin Newsom and he totally winked at me! \n \nOK.  So my Spruce experience wasn't exactly like that.  But that's the Spruce experience 7x7 et al. seem to purport.  That's fine.  Buzz is fun.  But it also makes for this: \n \nMe, to reservationist: \"Hi, I'd like a table for a party of four next Wednesday.  Any time is fine.\"\n \nReservationist: \"I'm sorry, we're fully committed.  But I'd be happy to add you to our waiting list.  You're number 43.\"\n \nMe (silently): @%@&*#!*&#%$& Are you @%#$^&@ crazy???\n \nWell.  There must have been 42 declines, because we were ultimately offered an eleventh-hour, but very fashionable, 5:30pm time slot.  Lucky us!  \n\nGoing to dinner at 5:30 is strange.  It's like being backstage or something.  There were backpack-wearing busboys waltzing through the front door to their shifts, and I swear the burger-munching guy at the bar ended up being our sommelier.   \n\nBut we got a taste of swank once we opened the wine list.  Fabulous!  Long and filled with those pricey bottlings only the aforementioned socialites can really afford, but there was a lot of well-priced, interesting stuff too.  And the champagne selection!  Heaven.\n\nI ordered a glass of rose champagne, and wow, was it good.  And the stemware was good, and the generous pour was really good.  I think it was the best thing I had all night. Ouch.\n\nSo.  How could the restaurant of the moment with a pedigreed chef and pedigreed suppliers and surely pedigreed investors not stand up to a simple glass of bubbly?  Hmm.  How about by...\n \na) starting out with stale(!), doughy rolls that were basically oversized beige cotton puffs with no flavor to speak of?  Who bakes this bread, and why?  \n \nb) following up with blah, blah, and blah ravioli filled with stewy greens and icky mint that did not even come CLOSE to Quince's ethereal pastas to which I had heard this dish favorably compared.\n \nc) continuing with a duck breast that was equally blah and, the clincher, overcooked!  Am I really eating duck breast that is both overcooked AND underseasoned?  And the accompanying quince gastrique and seared foie gras didn't help: they weren't seasoned either.   Underseasoning seems to be a pattern: everything tasted like some variation of nothing.  And where were the fabulous vegetables allegedly grown by the restaurant group?  All I got were a few scraggly pieces of radicchio.  \n \nd) concluding with an embarrassingly large trio of palmiers, which so awkwardly outsized the other desserts at the table, and were so conspicuously messy, breaking into buttery shards everywhere... not that I minded, but what a strange thing to have on a fancy dessert menu.  At least the flavor was good. \n \nOK, I know I just blasted the food.  But it wasn't a bad time.  In fact, it was a great time.  Because I was with great people and we were drinking pretty good (not for the price, but pretty good nonetheless) French wines, and the decor wasn't terribly off-putting, though the hideous faux-ostrich dining chairs have GOT to go and the incongruously low budget artwork sticks out like a sore thumb, but at least the lighting was good and energy was good and the service was good and we were all made to feel very welcome. \n \nSo I'd like to come back.  But not for formal table service.  I'd like to come in late and sit at the bar and try the more casual bar menu and investigate the non expense-account side of the wine list, and not scan the room for who I know and who should come say hi to me and who I should go greet... but wait, I can't possibly ignore those Junior Leaguers over there or they'll totally snub me at the next fundraiser, and shoot, there's my boyfriend's boss, I've got to say hi to him, and oh my god I am turning into one of THOSE people!", "author": "Melissa B."}

Don't be so classless as to complain about the price.  There's definitely bang for the buck!  Dinner for four (round of cocktails, appetizer, soups, entrees, two bottles of wine and aperitifs) was $380, which was actually quite reasonable.  \n\nDo dress up.  This is one of the few San Francisco establishments where jeans are really inappropriate.  \n\nDo give yourself time to enjoy the meal. This isn't a quick dinner.  The courses are drawn out and relaxed.   Make an evening of it.\n\nDo ask for the sommelier. It's a treat to have a trained sommelier help you choose your wine. She spent time helping us pick each bottle and chatting about the nuances between them.   Take advantage of the opportunity.  It's part of what you are paying for.\n\nHere are my complaints -not enough to dock a star for --maybe half a star.  It took 20 minutes to get our first round of cocktails.

Anyway, we all tromped in in our Sunday best and it was great, everyone in the restaurant seemed to be out for a nice occasion. \n\nWe started with the caviar platter and some lovely mulit-vintage champagne.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-26", "description": "Special occasions call for special restaurants, and Spruce fit the bill on all counts.  For my friend's significant birthday, we dined at Spruce, which offered an elegant, yet cozy environment, excellent food, and an abundant wine list.  \n\nI've had a lot of fine dining \"misses\" in San Francisco - stuffy interiors, overpriced and over-designed food, service that was bordering on theatrical.  Spruce, thankfully, has none of these things.  I think that the location, tucked into a neighborhood rather than in a business or tourist district, makes a lot of difference (think of places like \"Quince\", or even \"Chapeau\").  The interior is gorgeous, starting with the entrance, and on to the rich colors, soft lighting, high ceilings, and really comfortable seating.  The art is a little edgy, which keeps it from feeling pretentious.\n\nThe bar is packed with diners and drinkers alike, however we managed to squeeze in and enjoy a round of well-made libations, including a tasty Whiskey Smash.  I would definitely enjoy drinks and apps at the bar on a more casual night.\n\nOnce seated, we started with 4 appetizers:  the Charcuterie, Hot & Cold Foie Gras, Sweetbreads Lyonnaise, and Osetra Caviar.  Right away, we were impressed, as each dish was thoughtfully prepared and bursting with interesting flavors.  The Charcuterie plate was a generous combination of cured meats, each one different and delicious.  The foie gras was perfect, seared on one side of the plate, cold on the other with a  sprinkling of salt for additional bite.  The sweetbreads were tender and rich, with the poached egg to spread over the greens and sweetbreads to create a lovely, silky, hearty dish.  And the caviar - well, you can't go wrong with that.  They brought homemade brioche and blinis in abundance so that we never had to ration our caviar to the amount of bread given, and they were always warm.  Mmmm!\n\nFor dinner, we had 3 dishes:  the Harissa Chicken, the Charred Pork Tenderloin (2 of us had this), and the Buttered Maine Lobster.  I had the pork, and it was so perfectly cooked - I have never had pork that tender.  It came with a piece of pork belly that was a morsel of fatty decadence.  The chicken was well-spiced and very tasty, and the lobster was cooked perfectly, much to the delight of our birthday girl, who hails from the East Coast and had not had a proper cooked lobster in San Francisco until that night.  \n\nWe checked out the very impressive wine list (it's HUGE, I think around 1,300 bottles), and I would definitely choose a bottle from there next time.  However, since we had brought some Cristal and a very special & rare bottle of wine, we indulged in the corkage fee ($30/each, unlimited bottles) instead.  They were very gracious and kept our glasses full.\n\nDessert was not as outstanding - with the beignets being the best choice.  The Madeline and Orange Blossom ice cream was too perfumed for my taste...however, this does not have to be a miss.  After dinner, we were beckoned into the cheese/pastry room at the front, and given a sample of a fabulous Italian cheese and shared an eclair from the case.  This is the way to go, in my opinion - it's fun to talk to the staff and get to see a little bit of the inner workings of the restaurant.\n\nAll-in-all, a great experience, one worth saving your pennies for.  Perfect for when you want to impress someone, celebrate a special occasion, go out for a romantic dinner, or just treat yourself.", "author": "Liz S."}

Being five lovely women, we thought we could flirt our way into some hot seats at the bar.  But no!  Others with similar tactics twisted our game.  \n\nOne hour and two drinks later, we were seated in the front room next to the blazing fireplace, and things started looking up.  Our waiter spoke with ease about the menu as if he had curated it himself, and servers appeared from every direction to present each new temptation with relish.  \n\nThe mussels were succulent, the friench fries fantastic and the burger lived up to its hype.

We walked in around 6 to a very full bar and opted to put our name on the list for a bar table (a nice touch for the spontaneous no reservations crowd). We figured it would be about 20 minutes and were prepared to wait.\n\nThen Megan, the sommlier? manager? girl wonder? walks up and says that she remembers us. (you *motions to BF* had the moscato d'asti, you *points to me* had the zinfandel)  After a quick reminisce, she proceeds to scout out spots for us in the bar area. Thanks to our wonderful hostess, in less than 10 minutes we were cozied up to the very crowded, fully seated bar with gorgeous bubbly in hand.\n\nThere is nothing that pleases me more than to have fine, personal service accompany me, my BF & a glass of something gorgeous on date night. \n\nAlong with the bubbly we opted for the charcuterie plate (just as delicious as the last time -- hello duck liver mousse!!), which was followed by the vegetable salad with green goddess and a side of perfectly fried French fries. The salad was comprised of the smallest of baby romaines, fava beans, giant spring peas, paper-thin carrots & asparagus, and a slightly aged ricotta cheese. The green goddess was fresh and bright. It was a perfectly satisfying meal, and at no time did we feel rushed throughout the duration of our 2 courses. It was a relaxing small meal, and I was in good company. Definitely no need to hurry.\n\nOnce I'd eaten all of the abandoned fava beans off my BF's plate, we opted out on dessert list, settled our check and made our way out into the breezy, now darkening evening.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, for as we gave up our ring side bar seats, packs of women who were crowding the bar sipping cocktails started to bring the noise level up to a respectable cackle. \n((the following is not a refection on Spruce, just my experience))...\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with getting your girls night cocktail on. Been there, done that!  It's just that there is nothing that *dis*pleases me more than to have boozy women hangin' on my chair & cackling in my ear as I'm sipping champs and savoring pate.

My socks are still on and maybe a little tight.\n\nFOOD\nThe good: Trout that wasn't trout (it was pink, I swear it was probably salmon) with a buttery foam, saffron risotto, and fava beans. I kinda hate risotto. I think it has an identity crisis and can't decide whether it's a liquid or a solid. They pan-fried both sides, so I actually liked it here. Cheese selection was tasty. The sweet corn and sorrel soup was the best thing I had here. Smooth flavor and comforting on a cool day. \n\nThe OK: Charcuterie. I say OK because, while varied I only thought some of the items were really good. The rabbit mouse was good, as was the duck liver, but most of the salty sliced meats were just \"eh\". The bread that came with the cheese was somewhat burnt.\n\nThe \"I should've ordered something else\":\nArtichoke soup was bland. Sorbets were coconut, lemon, and mango. They tasted like store bought, except the coconut, which tasted like dried coconut and I would never buy this (the waitress told me it was going to be blood orange!). As nice-restaurant-sorbet goes, Spruce ranks low on the totem pole.\n\nDrinks: They've got a humongous cabinet and the most extensive wine list I've ever seen. Their drink menu is an inch thick. Only one non-alcoholic drink (berry spritzer with mint) which was good, but I don't like swallowing mint leaves. Cocktails are tasty for the most part, but the honey elderflower was more honey than elderflower.\n\nService: We couldn't figure out if they were rushing us or wanted us to linger. Drinks took a while to arrive, but our waitress started clearing our plates when there were still appetizers. Eh?\n\nAmbience: It's definitely a nice restaurant. The clientele is on the older, moneyed side. The staff is very serious and polished. I asked where the washroom was and was actually shown there (nice). They do the thing where they set your food down at the same time and servers kind of swarm your table, also nice but not a lot of smiles. In a word: stuffy.\n\nI would maybe take a colleague here for a business meal, but I wouldn't bring friends. I prefer places that are more relaxed and fun since eating out at nice places is a treat, and the food just didn't wow me. Like I said, socks not knocked off.", "author": "Amy N."}

The people were attentive without being overbearing.  Finally, the chairs and tables were large so even though the restaurant could be loud, you still feel some isolation because the other customers are not too close to you.

The Ritz Carlton concierge recommended Spruce and it happened to be one of the best meals I've had in the bay area. \n\nThe ambiance is great with a dark romantic interior with crisp white table tops. Spruce is a wonderful place to go solo (you can sit at the bar), with a significant other, or with your family, or with a large group of friends. Spruce has a private dinning room for bigger parties.\n\nThe staff and the service was on par. Wow! Our every need was taking care of and they pay close attention of the progression of the meal. In the sense that they are there when the dishes need to go, making sure the proper silverware are set for each course, consistently filling water and wine glasses. Basically the staff was impeccable and made the meal that much better\n\nFor dinner my mother and I split the mussels, which were amazing. The mussels were swimming in this white wine sauce and crispy spread was spread on top. My main course was the beef entree, which was cooked perfectly and accompanied by a sauce that brought out the taste of the meat. Dessert, we were talked into trying the beignets and they were very good, but its hard to mess up dried sugar bread; however, it was an excellent and fun way to end the evening. \nGo to Spruce.....", "author": "Leslie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-04", "description": "Spruce turned out to be all that I wanted and expected- a great restaurant serving delicious foods in a classy, cozy space.  I was fully satisfied with everything I ordered food-wise- the only issue that I had with Spruce was that the service seemed a little below par for the prices we were paying.\n\nWe were seated at the banquette right behind the hostess stand- I would have much preferred to sit somewhere further inside the dining room, especially since you could feel a bit of a breeze every time the front door opened.  However, it seemed that the tables are situated in such a way that small groups were preferred- tables were pretty much set for just 2-4 diners.  In any case, the space is rather tight once you actually look over how many tables there are, but because of the high ceilings and the natural light coming in from the skylight, you think you're in a much larger space.  \n\nNow onwards to the food- starting with the warm, crusty rolls, which tasted quite fresh.  The gougeres were wonderfully cheesy and salty- a perfect start to a great meal.  I decided to go for the charcuterie plate for my appetizer- I'm warning you right now that you will absolutely eat everything off that plate, love it, and just about ruin your appetite for your entree.  Highlights off that plate include the wonderfully rich and fatty duck liver mousse, as well as the pork rilette.  The salamis are great as well, but definitely order the plate to try the duck liver mousse.\n\nThough I was stuffed from the charcuterie, my entree of lobster was up next and it blew me away.  There were probably a good eight chunks of lobster meat in a buttery sauce with peas and potato gnocchi.  I wasn't thrilled with the gnocchi, which were a bit hard, but the lobster was tender and luscious.  Definitely worth the $40 price tag.\n\nI couldn't leave without having dessert and coffee (even though I was fuller than I had any right to be) so it was time to order the beignets and a decaf coffee.  The decaf is as great as everyone has mentioned, but I was a little underwhelmed by the beignets, which were more like very good sugared donut holes.  By the way, they are best plain, or with the creme anglaise, but skip the raspberry compote.\n\nOverall, a delicious meal that rates 5 stars.  I'm subtracting a half star because service wasn't quite up to par- plates took a long time to be cleared from the table and honestly, what everyone has said about the sommelier is true- he had this strange forced friendliness that rang false and he seemed bored to be there.  \n\nI'd definitely be back because the food is awesome and the wine list (especially the German Rieslings) is extensive.  Don't forget to drop by the bakery by the side of the restaurant- you can purchase the palmiers you had for dessert, as well as cookies and a limited selection of baked goods.  I also met the charcutier, who told me that he does sell the excellent duck liver mousse to go- you can get the individual serving or get it in a larger amount for parties.", "author": "Angela H."}

All the foodie blogs, Bauer worshippers, and SF mags are hyping up this big cash cow that is Spruce. \n\nWell, I'm here to add fuel to the fiiii--ya!!!  \n\nSo all you Chris T fans or relatives please take my recommondation and try this place at least once.  It's not a regular dinner spot since it's hard to get a reservation right now and it seems to be a destination restaurant for certain occassions.  But it's perfect for dates, and unfortunately good for business dinners.  Lots n lots of suits seem to be the usual clientele.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a casual place, since they insisted on taking my coat to their closet.  Then I noticed not one chair was covered by someone's coat.  Maybe they wanted to show off their fine camel leather chairs, which was great sitting for my butt.  Comfy!\n\nI knew service was going to be top notch and we hadn't even ordered a beverage yet!  Host took my coat, switched us to a table further from the drafty entrance, escorted us until we were finally seated.  She tagged our waitor and he offered us our menus.  Along the way he must have tagged another waitor because we were given comped cheesy butter bread.  Which was good, but definitely something I've tried before.  Was this their amuse bouche?  Didn't really amuse me.  She scurried off and tagged a busboy, who gave us bigger dinner breads.  Crusty nice... wish they were warm.\n\nI had the Foie Gras w/ Huckleberry ($18) appetizer.  I've had samplings of foie before, but I think this was when I truly tasted it in its entirity.  Previous attempts had it rolled with other messes, or on top of vegies n sauce.  But Spruce prepares it as a chilled medallion with a plop of huckleberry jam, which was a lil off putting for me but helped cut down that creaminess.  This is not an appetizer you should eat by yourself by the way.  It became way too rich after eating just 1/3 of the medallion.  And it was only perhaps 2 inches in diameter.  I must have only had $5 worth... plus, I ran out of toast to spread on.  \n\nEvery single entree sounded fabulous and they're written in a way where you can already visualize the dish.  The waitor basically made my decision after he raved about the halibut.  I wish I had an online menu to remember all the ingredients.  I do recall the fish was poached, which just made it extremely tender and moist.  The flakes just fell to large chunks.  So great!  It sat on a bed of spinach, grilled chantrelles, and fennel.  And it was topped off tableside with what looked to be cream, but was in fact halibut broth, pureed fennel, and etc etc.  I should have asked them to leave that gravy boat on the table so I could just drink it as if it were my glass of wine.  \n\nFor dessert, it was a simple dish of poundcake-like cake and chilled cream with raspberries.  Not exceptional, but light enough where my meal was complete and satisfying as opposed to bloated and jean button unbuckling.\n\nI went with a friend who would never choose Spruce as a dinner choice.  I'll try to recreate his review as if he were on Yelp.  \n\n:::not from around here friend::: App was Lamb Sweetbread appetizer.  Sweetbread?  Chris said it was some thyroid gland so I'll still consider that meat.  I just ordered it cuz I like meat and everything else had cheese in it.  I don't like cheese. It was good seeing as how I ate it in 4 minutes and didn't bother to share with Chris.  Her foie was good... I have these kind of dishes back home too, but it's really chicken liver or gizzards.  Not prepared all rich like that pasty stuff.  I say innards are innards.\n\nThen I ordered the lobster... I just saw lobster on the menu and just ordered it.  All this other weird fish thing and pork stomach thing I am just not familiar with.  I ate it in 5 min... again I didn't think Chris would have wanted to try some so I just hoovered it.  Didn't savor anything... I am a hungry man.  I was already staring at my empty dish when Chris had finally picked up her fork. \n\nDessert, I just went for the rice pudding because I like rice where I come from and I know what pudding is.  I had 2 bites and wasn't too fond of it already.  The rice was a bit undercooked and the medjool figs kinda looked like pork skin. :::/not from around here friend:::\n\nI desperately want to come back with someone who would appreciate fine food and wine (he ordered 2 cokes!) and also share a bite from their dishes.", "author": "Chris T."}

I've come here maybe 7 times, ordered at least 3 things each time, and have loved every single dish.  They have an off-menu burger.  I think HuffPo recently had a list of Top 5 Burgers in SF, and I didn't see Spruce on the list and consequently, I have stopped reading HuffPo.\n\nThe staff is super friendly.  This is by far the thing that stands out the most.  This distinction from even other high quality restaurants in San Francisco can not be overemphasized.  The waiters, bartenders, and especially the sommelier are extremely knowledgeable and helpful about every aspect of what they do.  I don't know enough to choose my own wine, and I've always loved the suggested pairing.  If you want, they will tell you about the million different places their ingredients come from.  While it is impossible to make a reservation here close enough in the future that you would otherwise actually care to think that far ahead, the restaurant is  always ready for you at the reservation time.\n\nThe decor of this restaurant is remarkable.  I would estimate each chair in here is probably worth more than all the chairs I own, combined.  Their taste in art is just edgy enough to retain an independent SF feel and still manages to complement the overall high class environment.  I'm generally not a high class restaurant type of guy, but I guess they feel their food is best served in a room out of Buckingham Palace, and it works well.\n\nThe beneighs are crazy.

The duck and halibut were excellent and done to perfection but I must say that the burger and fries were really good.

Every detail was taken care of.\n\n2.  Appetizer was cauliflower ravioli in brown butter sauce.  Excellent, sensual, flavorful.  A really great dish.\n\n3.  Main entree was a large grass fed beef bone OUT t-bone for two.  I was with a group and two of us were going to order the steak so this seemed like a good idea.  It was a special for the evening.  The meat itself was excellent but, in my opinion, the kitchen was really sloppy in what they sent out.  At least 4 of the pieces were inedible because they were virtually all bone and they should have been kept in the kitchen and not presented to the table.  It made for some unpleasant experiences when eating our main course.  Accompaniments of chard and confit cooked potatoes were good.\n\n4.  Dessert of Meyer Lemon Tart was very ordinary, ok but nothing particularly elegant or special.\n\n5.  Our sommelier was great, helpful, easy going, enthusiastic about wines to offer based on our entree selections.  The wine he suggested was excellent.\n\nSo here's the conundrum.  So many things were great, top notch.  But the execution on the main course was sloppy to say the least.  So I guess that is where I would remove a star.  These folks are really doing a good job in so many areas.  I just think the chef has to step up and get all the details in line.  Other members of the group were not very enthralled with their entrees either.  Comments were good, not great.  At these prices, the food coming out should be great!!

Maybe I did not look like someone who would spend any money to him? \n\n- Starts off with me having to ask for everything, including a menu. The parts that are missing in between are, could I answer any questions, offer you a glass of water, or even how are you? Just a few sentences of conversation, I don't ask for much. With spending over $ 70 by myself, it sounds more economical if I go to a In-and-Out burger and find a friendlier order taker. Is this too much to ask? Again, nothing against the restaurant, maybe I just have the bad apple, or the worst one. \n\n- Each coarse came, good food over all, sweet bread was a little scarce on the plate.

All of the above was there. From the front of the house (the lovely Regina greeting us) to the bartenders, waiters and the sommelier the mood was up and friendly, the service impeccable, helpful and never intrusive. The food...well the food.\n\nI started with the Corn and Salt Cod chowder. Beautiful blend of a very sweet corn and the salty cod resulted in a creamy, beautifully balanced dish. I had a glass of Fleury champagne leading into it. Finishing both I moved to the Albacore tuna. I ordered a bottle of Priorat to go with it (with the help of the sommelier). The red was big but not so big as to overwhelm the fish. The earthiness worked to support the saltiness of the preparation of the tuna. Lovely pairing.\n\nFinishing our wine we passed on dessert but it wasn't easy. The menu looked great. I took a stroll to the back of the restaurant to see the wine storage. Great glass doors fronted large shelves of a rainbow of labels. Curiously, the wine was stored standing upright. I image there is little tradeoff. The ability to see the wine quickly and the fact that few stay on the shelf for long works is the thinking I imagine.\n\nDinner for two with a bottle of wine, a couple of glasses of wine earllier and cocktails before that came to about $275.

Our dinner guests enjoyed the wine selection alot, but to be honest  nothing makes me happier than a little glass of something on the rocks with a flirty garnish of some sort :o) They've got plenty to offer in that department too. The Honeydew(Honey Berry?) martini will have your tastebuds dancing and put a little blush in your cheeks all at once.\n\nYou know, it's a good thing we live in the suburbs or I might be at Spruce all the time, eating us out of house and home! ;)", "author": "Kaye M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-19", "description": "From time to time, I've made the trip from San Francisco to Woodside to enjoy everything from dinner to drinks to hot chocolate at The Village Pub, an upscale eatery whose menu has always impressed me. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the owners of The Village Pub had opened a new restaurant in Laurel Heights in a similar vein: Spruce\n\nThe fact that my first visit to Spruce coincided with my having to catch a red-eye flight to Hong Kong only added to the experience. \n\nHoused in a former 1930's era car garage, the brick fronted exterior gives way to an interior that is both inviting and glamorous. A loft-like cathedral ceiling of skylights crossed with black metal trusses shelters the chocolate brown mohair banquettes, oversize faux ostrich-skin leather chairs, and dark paneling of the main dining room. Large paintings add interest to the space; both black-and-white figural works, and more colorful abstract pieces.\n \nThe Village Pub in Woodside is known for its house-made charcuterie, and being a fan of cured meats my dining companions and I decided this was a required plate with which to start. The charcuterie included a decadent duck liver mousse, spicy coppa, an excellent soppressata, and cured beef tongue, all of which was pleasing to the carnivores in attendance. If you appreciate the art of charcuterie, this is a \"must have\" plate with which to begin your meal. The gang leader of this particular culinary outing ordered up a glass of Geverztraminer for each of us to enjoy with plate, a pairing which I was at first skeptical of, but found to be enlightening with the selection of meats and their preparation.\n\nFor my entree, I asked the bartender what she most enjoyed on the menu. Her response was to try the charred Berkshire pork tenderloin with crisp pork belly and shelling beans, a recommendation that was well received. Berkshire pork is famous for its combination of juiciness, marbling, depth of flavor, and tenderness, and the Spruce pork tenderloin lived up to the breeds reputation. Better still the pork belly melted into the tenderloin, adding the right combination of salty, fatted goodness.\n\nI paired the pork with a recommended glass of Barolo (whose vintner I've shamefully forgotten) that was absolutely out of this world, both on its own, and paired with the tender pork flesh... but it was also a stiff drink at--I believe--$30 a glass (I'll verify this on my next visit, but I do believe it was a $30 a glass wine).\n\nFor desert, I enjoyed a glass of Chartreuse VEP (Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolong), which is aged for a longer period of time in oak casks until reaches an exceptional quality. While the common distillations of green and yellow Chartreuse  can be found at many better bars and restaurants, Chartreuse VEP is a more difficult elixir to track down, and i was thrilled to see that Spruce had a bottle on hand.\n\n\n\nFast forward four weeks:\n\nI've returned from the other side of the world, and while enjoying a Death in the Afternoon (a mixture of champagne and Pernod) at my favorite bar, my girlfriend and I start feeling a touch peckish. We could have just as easily ordered up something at our current location, but then I mentioned Spruce, and how--even though I've been sampling the best that South East Asia has to offer--the meal we shared with her brother the night of my departure is still on my mind. And as quick as that we settled our bill and were off to Laurel Heights for a seat at the bar.\n\nI ordered the hamburger from the bar menu as a compliment to my Manhattan. The salty, lightly charred meat arrived on a crisp bun, and paired up with crisp skinned French fries that will make devotes of the deep fried sliver of potato nod their approval (Spruce's regular French fires have me planning a return visit to sample the French fries cooked in duck fat that accompany the Bavette steak).\n\nMy dining companion ordered the mussels, whose rich broth I found myself dipping my fries into more often then is perhaps polite.\n\n \nOf special interest:\n\n \nAccording to Michael Bauer's review in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\":\n \n\"Much of the produce comes from SMIP Ranch, the Bacchus (Restaurant Group: ed) farm in the Santa Cruz Mountains; most other products come from local, sustainable farms. In addition, the farm's delivery truck is fueled by the restaurant's recycled cooking oil.\"\n \n \nThe Library\n \nYou enter Spruce through an open courtyard, to the right of which is a small room fitted out like a decadent den or study, with a fireplace and dark leather furniture that you can sink into with a drink in hand. Called \"The Library,\" this to me seems like the perfect place to enjoy an aperitif, or an after dinner glass of Chartreuse.", "author": "Chris B."}

My first time at Spruce was a TOTAL disappointment starting with the bread and extending through dessert.  The one highlight was the glass of wine -- a tasting of two whites followed by a generous pour.\n\n1.  The bread was a dinner roll -- like the cheap kind in a six pack at SAFEWAY.  The crust was soft like the inside.  It had been warmed but was cold in the middle.  I was told it was from Acme (yeah, right -- unless it was really old, stale Acme?) -- GRADE:  F\n\n2.  I requested a mild fish, and the waiter highly recommended the cod served over vegetables.  Seriously, I should have left after the bread . . . huge clue.  The cod was fishy (maybe not fresh?).  The vegetables were average and excessively seasoned with parsley.  I thought about sending the dish back but decided to cut my loss and go for the dessert recommendation.  No one screws up dessert!  -- GRADE:  D\n\n3.  The waiter had recommended his favorite - the caramel apple over shortbread topped with Calvados cream sauce, and vanilla ice cream on the side.  The vanilla ice cream had ice crystals in it (old ice cream or melted and re-frozen?).  The cream sauce was too thick to pour (since it was served too cold).  The shortbread was a 1/2 inch thick and \"rock\" hard - impossible to eat with a fork (a machete would suffice). -- Overall GRADE:  C; ice cream GRADE:  F.\n\nI paid the bill and decided I would \"vote with my pocketbook\" (not return or recommend).  Upon leaving, I had a very surreal experience.  A patron standing outside waiting for his car asked how the food was.  I told him that I would give it a \"C-.\"  A car valet overheard and ran in to get the manager.  The manager immediately came outside and gave me his card (William R.).  He then asked about my experience.  I told him about each course as described previously (sans machete).  He told me there had been \"problems\" with the bread, etc.  I thought that he might try to \"right\" my less than stellar experience.  Instead, following a very pregnant pause, I excused myself to go home (Ummm, why did he give me his card???).

My husband and I happened to be driving through the city the other night, which really never happens, and we were on the north side, so we thought we'd pop in.  I called about 10 minutes in advance of 6 pm and they were willing to set me up in their private dining room so long as I skeedadled by 8, which would've been fine, but when we got there they gave us the choice of the room or the bar, and the room was dead quiet and lonely, so we chose the bar.  \n\nThe endive pear pistachio salad was heavenly, and we both enjoyed our cocktails.  For dinner, honey-lacquered duck w/cinnamon dusted foie gras was absolutely delicious, although very, very rich, and my hubby thorougly enjoyed his pork tenderloin. \n\nThe highlight for me was the dessert--brandied cherry soda float w/vanilla and pistachio icecream.

Maybe its the places I frequent, but I have not seen so many groups of 30-something moderately attractive but slightly boring looking single women sitting at a bar anyplace else.  Now, I am not the kind of guy who might take advantage of this situation, personally, but I know some of you guys are into this sort of thing, so take note.  Its also worthy of note that they have an excellent, albeit expensive liquor selection.\n\nIn general, I have to say Spruce was a slight disappointment.  The food is good, and the service is excellent, but they are really just trying a little too hard.  The place looks brand new but trying to look not so brand new.  The wine list is huge, but so expensive they actually offer a $50 and under page to simplify things for us non-millionaires.\n\nSo, go to Spruce:\n1.  You really want to impress someone\n2.

For me, Spruce was that friend.  We're not friends anymore.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  This review has nothing to do with food and everything to do with service, so stop reading if you are comfortable playing $100+ a head in order to put up with self-important, obnoxious staff.  Your life.\n\nBack to the story.  My lady friend and I meet some people for drinks in the bar at Spruce (~6pm) before we were to head over to another restaurant across town for an 8pm reservation.  After being served our $28 glasses of wine in the loud Spruce bar by a hurried and pretentious waiter, my girlfriend decides to check and see if there were any cancellations for dinner because we heard it was great.  What luck, they had a cancellation at 7:45 and could give us that table.  But before I go to cancel our 8pm reservation, I go up to confirm.  \"We're on for 7:45, right?,\" says me.  \"Yep, we'll find you in the bar when the table's ready,\" says hostess lady.  So as a courtesy to the across town restaurant, I go cancel because I respect the concept of a reservation.  You can probably guess how this turns out...\n\nRadio silence from hostess lady until a little before 8pm when I go ask for a status update.  She tells me that they had to bump us because it got too busy.  Love that she decided not to inform me of this fact until I inquired.  \"We have to give priority to people who had reservations,\" says her.  To which I replied, \"what were you going to do if the original 7:45 table showed up?  ...you know we cancelled another reservation after you assured us we had a table reserved.\"  After a few apathetic hems and haws and an uncomfortable silence, I got what was effectively a shoulder shrug from hostess lady.  \n\nI've never had a restaurant so calmly acknowledge a mistake with such little remorse then offer no restitution.  In this economy, they should be grateful that anyone is still willing and able to pay that much to eat there.  Service should be a given.  I'm all about principles.

Although it was a pleasant dining experience, I'm not itching to go back. The crowd was hip but older ... read: your grandmother who wears leather pants and thinks botox is for sissies.  Service was good, although perhaps a bit TOO familial. Sommelier was anxious to make recommendations and had an encyclopedic knowledge of the wines, but led one of my co-diners to confess, \"After listening to all that, I need a drink.\"  \n\nFood is expertly executed but just not particularly \"interesting\".  Potato soup was surprisingly tasty.  Potato/salmon appetizer was fresh and clean.  The fish (sole?) was also a hit!  My pork loin was tender and perfectly cooked but just seemed a bit dull on top of beans.  Hazelnut cake dessert was spot-on!  And the selection of coffees and teas was impressive!

Dressed to a tee like I had an invitation on the Spruce Goose I entered this bastion of the hip and sophisticated.  Put on your sexiest outfit to go here ladies because the atmosphere is very sexy. \n \nThere are several small dining spaces, a main dining area, a bar area, and some private mingling areas.  I like the private living room off the side of the entrance, a great place for cocktails.  The wine fridge is floor to ceiling.  The atmosphere here is old and classy, but delicately modern.  Many restaurants in San Francisco emphasize the modern, but I like the classic boys' club feel that this place brings, which is strangely refreshing around here.  You don't have to be a banker or the wife of a banker to like the atmosphere.  It is tasteful.  Very fabulous.  \n\nThere are three leatherbound menus.  A bar menu, a dining room menu, and a wine list.  The wine list is extensive, like a book.  We chose several by the glass selections, which were good but limited.  I definitely want to order a bottle next time.\n\nThe menu was original Californian fare.  Steak, fish, burger, soup,  We started with a beet potato chip amuse bouche which was good.  An interesting choice of palate pleaser.  The chef also complimented us with a creme soup with a nice oyster.  I liked the taste of the oyster.  Very fresh.\n\nFor dinner we had the heirloom tomato gazpacho, which was a refreshing cold soup, tasted a bit of salsa.  The monkfish with mussels as well as the albacore tuna also made an appearance.  The albacore was prepared with mushroom and corn.  I love corn.  The monkfish, which is cheap lobster, was prepared with eggplant and a hint of olives and a ragout of other vegetables.  Neither dish was mind blowing, but in this setting who really cares.  The place oozes sex appeal.  Who cares if your date has no personality when you are staring into piercing eyes and a fabulous smile.\n\nFor dessert we had the stone fruit bruschetta, which is a cake with peaches and other fruites.  In case you don't know what a stone fruit is, it is a pretentious name for fruit with a pit.  Keep that in mind next time you are trying to impress someone or sound snobbish.  Very nice and sweet, not too filling.  It had meyer lemon ice cream which was good.  Apple likes ice cream.\n\nIn summary the atmosphere was a total five and the food maybe a three.  The preparations were original and unique, but the taste wasn't orgasmic.  Definitely worth another visit if only to soak in the fabulous atmosphere.\n\nUpdate.  Second visit.\nA second date can make or break a potential relationship.  Perhaps your date be uncharacteristicly witty that night, spurring a long period of seduction.  Or maybe you will encounter your date on an off night, prompting a lackluster impression, leaving you to dust your true soul mate on the side of the road.  Oh Spruce, you are somewhere in between, as any reasonable girl would allow.\n\nSeating.\nTrying to get a seat at the bar reminded me of lining up for coach class on Southwest.  As you are not assigned seats, you are forced to stalk the other patrons at the bar, breathing down their necks until they are finally sick of you and decide to take leave of the place.  As this is a 'finer' restaurant, i might suggest taking down names or a waitlist for the bar area to avoid this tasteless way of self seating.  It is never effective and there really isn't any benefit in having free for all seating.  If someone can lend some insight into this, I welcome you to weigh in.  Do we really want a Mike Tyson style brawl while we await our high soc dining?\n\nAs for the short corridor where we stand stalking our predecessors, this is a narrow hallway of a space with wait staff shuffling through.  Would it not be more appropriate to have a lounge area to congregate as we wait for our three hundred dollar dinners?  The last thing I want to do is contend with the plebs while I am hungry.\n\nService.\nBar staff is a slightly inexperienced for an expensive restaurant.  After requesting two drink refills, I was asked what wine we were drinking.  Ok people, you are charging ninety dollars for an appetizer.  You should be able to work out a system where I do not need to recite my drink to you.  A bartender is an expert.  A diner is not.\n\nFood.\nFood was good.  A lovely duck breast prepared with foie gras was the highlight of the meal.  There's nothing like a rich foie gras to seduce an unrefined palate like mine.  We shared a nice salad with citrus that was refreshing and a fish dish that was immemorable.  My date refused to finish a bite of the amuse bouche which he conjectured was prepared in the morning or the day before.\n\nOverall, a nice experience, however, it is the sexy atmosphere that will keep me coming back, rather than the food or service.  Spruce, you are like that gorgeous date with no personality.  You will amuse me for a while, but eventually I will tire of you and return to pizza and beer.", "author": "apple r."}

We were seated at the very back of the main room in a small room (w/ a table for two and two tables for four) that still overlooks the main room but is quieter and offers a bit more privacy.   \n\nThere were quite a few enticing choices on the menu and I finally decided on the red pumpkin soup to start which was so delicious.  Rich and flavorful with a slight sweetness.  My bass came next and was seared to a perfect light crispiness on one side.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were the marinated leeks (too tart!).  My b/f's short ribs were great.  Some might think it bland but to us it highlighted the wonderful natural taste of the beef....mmmmm.\n\nFinished off with the chocolate and caramel fondant.

The bartender took his sweet time in getting to me but, once he did, he provided great service. That being said, the restaurant side of things was great.  Our waiter, Kelly, was attentive, prompt, considerate and a great guide to our dining experience.  The sommelier was invaluable in choosing some great wines and she took into account my preferences-I would love to try one of the $200 bottles but that will have to wait.  Food was delicious-we tried a number of cheeses, a few appetizers(the corn chowder and the zucchini) and a few different mains. Although there a few vegetable options on the menu, this place wouldn't be your first choice to take a vegetarian to.\nWe sat in the back room, which is the spot to be if you are looking to escape the noise and the scene out front.  I am looking forward to going back soon.", "author": "David G."}

The decor reminded me a lot of Bix.\n\nI ordered a margarita with $14 tequila, it was not good which is unfortunate. Several of the reviews here have bad things to say about the bar, we were seated quickly and so never approached it, but if you're gonna charge $14 bucks for a cocktail it should taste good, right ? However, it should be noted that didn't stop me from drinking it.\n\nThe wine list for me was over the top, 100's of wines from all over the world priced on the low end to start around 80 - 90 bucks and going straight up from there.\n\nThe menu has things like \"Braised beef bravette with a cream of horseradish remolade and braised new baby vegetables.\"\n\nI'm sorry but I don't know what shit like that means ?\n\nBut I narrowed it down to red meat with a horseradish sauce, OK, fine, that sounds good, put it up.\n\nBut when it comes like I said, it's artisan so the plate is about the colors and the presentation so the horseradish is a swipe of green on the plate, when for me I'd have taken a bowl of it on the side. \n\nAlso, I know it's hip to do small tastes of things with nuanced flavors and combinations but I wouldn't have minded bigger portions.\n\nWe also got the charcuterie plate, again tiny tastes of things, one of which was pigs ear ? I mean basically flavorless, I'd have preferred a piece of bacon.\n\nSo for me it's probably a case of casting pearls before swine, any shortcomings are most likely due to my inability to appreciate food like this and that should be noted. \n\nHowever, if you're one of those rare people who can appreciate this type of cuisine, if you're someone can tell a good Chateau Nuf de Pape from bad, if $6 dollars for a cup of Peaberry coffee sounds OK, if you subscribe to, read, and understand what's written in magazines like Gourmet then you will very likely enjoy Spruce.\n\nParty of 4 with wine and tip was out the door for $415 bucks.\n\nOverall, it was nice, I liked it, glad I went, but I wouldn't rush back.", "author": "red c."}

I would have bumped this review up by a star, but we had arguably the worst table in the place -- stuck all the way in the back, in a corner -- so we couldn't assess the room and/or service. \n\nSpeaking of, the service was OK -- not bad, not great -- but the sommelier was totally non-personable and, although he did recommend a great madeira at the end of the meal, we figure he either didn't feel confident for his role there and/or he didn't know what he was doing. \n\nRegardless, the food was really great. We started with the charcuterie plate and a fresh zucchini with ricotta salad ... a good combination of delicious meats and pates, accompanied by a vegetable. \n\nFor entrees, we each ordered something different so we could try a bit of everything ... I had the pork and it was a delicious and perfectly cooked tenderloin on a bean salad along with pork belly. We also ordered the steak with frites on what we think was kale (good, not earth-shattering), and the halibut on chanterelle mushrooms (although cold on arrival, it was cooked really well and was delicious; great sauce). \n\nWe finished with the European cheese sampler (6 kinds) and a white creme on hazelnut cake with coffee ice cream to share -- along with a few glasses of Madeira. \n\nThe wine list was really extensive with lots of reasonable bottles ... although, I did see a vintage Champagne for over $1000 which would have been fun!

First off, the food I had was excellent...the Day Boat Scallops were top notch, and the Honey Glazed Duck was superb.  Only one of us didn't care for their dish (the Ocean Trout, which seemed previously frozen and smelled/tasted off).  If I was going to rate the food alone, it would get 5 stars from me.  However, this review is based on the overall experience.\n\nThe positives:\n\nThe restaurant is nicely appointed....attractive....worthy of our expectations in appearance.\n\nThe food was all brought out at the same time.  I always appreciate this touch, and I hate to sit and let my food get cold while we wait for one persons food to show up.\n\nThe waiter knew the menu very well, and could explain how things were prepared when asked.\n\nThey didn't turn up their nose when I brought in my wine.  They checked my wine bag and made sure I didn't forget it upon departure.\n\nThey bring out new stemware for each wine.  I find that unnecessary if we are going from one white to another, and then one Pinot to another Pinot, but it's a nice touch.  Their stemware is exceptional.\n\nThe negatives were as follows:\n\nCorkage policy is $30/bottle, $60/bottle after the first two bottles.  Our group of 6 brought 3 bottles, but they were nice enough to keep the corkage at $30/bottle for all 3.  Still, $30 corkage is extreme to me, and had me wondering if we should even come here in the first place.  It would have been better if they waived a corkage for every bottle purchased off the list.  We ended up purchasing 2 bottles to complement our personal wine.\n\nTheir wine list is extensive and impressive.  The mark-ups on the list were not.  I've only seen a handful of wine lists with mark-ups this extreme (ranging from 3 to 4 times the retail cost!)\n\nThe bar is right next to the restaurant with a partial wall separating them.  The bar was VERY loud....this is not the restaurant to go to for an intimate dinner or a gathering of friends where you actually want to talk to each other.  This is the primary reason we won't return....I go to restaurants to enjoy the company as well as the food.\n\nThe wait staff, while knowledgeable of the food, was a tad on the snobby side.  When one of the ladies at our table was trying to decide between two choices on the menu, the waiter got upset and said \"I'll come back when you're ready\", and marched away before anybody could say anything.  WTF?\n\nThe wine list and menu have the smallest text possible.  These aren't state secrets or anything....and the crowd for much of the night looked older than me.  Definitely bring your reading glasses and a flashlight.\n\nIn conclusion, go to enjoy the food...but be prepared for the noise.  I'd suggest no more than 4 people in your group if you really want to talk to each other without having to yell.", "author": "Chris P."}

A friend of mine just said, \"let's go to dinner; I heard about this place.\" I looked at the address and sighed, but that was my last negative thought that evening.\n\nSpruce is a fairly large restaurant or at least, it feels large. It is decorated in a lot of rich chocolate tones in a soft modern style. The atmosphere struck me as business casual though I noticed there were several areas of the restaurant with warmer artwork that felt more romantic than where I was sitting.\n\nThe restaurant has its own private farm in Woodside where its produce comes from. Does it make a difference? I don't know, but I do know the quality was outstanding.\n\nMy meal started with sweetbreads and chantrelles on a bed of mustard greens. If you enjoy sweetbreads (typically the thyroid gland of a lamb), I recommend trying them at Spruce. They had a velvety texture and a mild flavor that was perfectly accented by the pancetta vinaigrette.\n\nMy main course was a grilled bavette steak with duck fat potatoes and a bordelaise sauce. Bavette is a french cut of steak that is highly underrated in the United States with a strong meaty flavor and a wonderfully soft texture. It isn't melt in your mouth soft like a tenderloin, but the flavor more than makes up for it.\n\nFor dessert I had the beignets. This was probably the only thing that threw me. They looked like doughnut holes! I guess I'm used to the rectangular versions. Ignoring the shape, they were wonderfully light and airy and the creme anglaise they came with was the perfect accent.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to point out is the wines. While I am no wine expert, my friend noted later that the wines were marked up well most places.\n\nIf you've got some money burning a hole in your pocket or just want some fine dining, I highly recommend the place.", "author": "Jordan M."}

From the moment you approach this classy restaurant, you are swept up in the grandiose factor. Large glass doors are held open for you as you approach the hostess. We were ushered back within seconds to our spacious table and throne-like chairs; our backdrop - a beautiful bar with strategically placed art that got my analytical juices flowing.\n\nThe food was pretty near perfect. We started with the corn ravioli (this had a much fancier name) and it did not disappoint. It was tender and flavorful - we had to ask the waiter to give us more bread so we could sop up all the sauce! We might as well have licked the plate clean. I had the short ribs for my main course which was even more impressive. I couldn't believe how tender it was. It was garnished with sweet onions and when eaten together it was the perfect blend of sweet and salt. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nFor the quality of food, service and space at Spruce, I was shocked that we didn't spend more than we did. Don't get me wrong, this isn't for those on a tight budget, but all things considered, it didn't put too much of a dent in my bank account!

I brought a 1985 Montelena that I wanted to try for the special occasion and it definitely was good. We arrived at 8 and ordered promptly at 8:15. we ordered the steak tartare and the caesar salad. the tartar was good, meat was fresh and seasoned well.  caesar salad was very good, crisp, light clean flavor, just the right amount of dressing. from that point we realized it was already almost 2 hrs into the dinner and the steak had not come out. because we had a dead time we finished off the Montelena, and they brought out some turnip soup. the soup was the highlight of the evening, it was seasoned well and the texture was perfect. the steak eventually came out later but it was cooked medium to medium well. we had asked the manager how they would've ordered a premium dry aged bone in tomahawk, and she said she did not eat meat so she could not respond to that question, which I could understand. But anyhow they had no more tomahawk cuts and the dinner was going pretty long so we decided to just have a few bites and decide to leave disappointed. at the end of the dinner the manager had come over and notified us that the complete dinner was comped.

Poor C arrived well ahead of me (per the plan) and had to battle a cougar or two to hold onto my seat, but she handled the situation with her typical aplomb and emerged victorious.\n\nWe started with the to-die-for charcuterie. (If, as F+W claims, sashimi is this year's omnipresent menu item, then salumi is its 2008 successor, but I for one, don't want to see either trend disappear anytime soon.) The foie gras was grab-the-edge-of-the-(Carrera marble) bar-good and the sea bass with pomelo was accompanied by the lightest, yet somehow buttery, leek and crab fondue. The petrale sole didn't thrill us and C was more impressed with the chai ice cream than the pumpkin chiboust it accompanied, but the five star ambiance made up for anything lacking in the food (and that wasn't much).

Everyone and everything from the valet to the bus service was sharp and professional. \n\nThe grilled yellowtail, with meager accompaniment, was certainly well prepared, but with little imagination and the overall experience of the plate was flat. The tomato soup was robust, but the pumpkin, which was promised to be more savory than sweet, delivered a little more sweet than advertised by the server. The sweetbreads were good, while the braised lettuce served with them was excellent. Portions were adequate at best. I would consider the plates slightly overpriced, but not exceedingly so. \n\nFor those of us who work for a living, however, it is the wine prices that will provide the sticker shock. I believe the corkage at Spruce is a seemingly high $30, but given the mark up of near 3x retail on several bottles I was quite familiar with (and I have had the same vintages elsewhere for significantly less), in hindsight, suffering the corkage fee would have been an incredible bargain. \n\nIn all, it was an excellent experience.

The service was impressive and the menu was delightful.  We started off with the celeriac bisque and chopped arugula salad.  Both were delicious and a good start to our meal.  My friend and I wanted to take full advantage of tasting as many things as possible, so we agreed to share each others entrees (only way to do it!)\n\nI ordered the sole and dungeness crab with a saffron sauce that was to DIE for!  The second entree was the lobster with creamy gnocchi.

I planned a work event here, and we started out with cocktail hour in the front library suite.  Plush, leather couches, cozy fireplace, and delightful hors d'oeuvres set the mood just right.  We then made our way through the breathtaking dining room (which was packed on a Monday night), past the wine cellar (er, walls filled with wines) and snapshot of the kitchen where all the cooks are surprisingly relaxed for a full house.  \n\nWe dined in the Laurel suite in the back, which could fit up to about 35 people.  The mahogany colored walls and subdued lighting invited a relaxed atmosphere.  For appetizer, we ate the homemade ravioli and had a choice of seared albacore or sage roasted chicken for entree.  I got the tuna and it was cooked perfectly.  The dessert was amazing too: chocolate fondant goodness with chocolate sorbet and caramel. Deliciosity!  \n\nLaurel Heights was definitely in need of a fine dining restaurant and Spruce does not disappoint.  I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Michelle L."}

Service was very attentive & professional.  As for food, it was good but not great.  Very short menu to choose from.  We started with mussels in a butter wine sauce, it was tasty but nothing special.  Then green & black olives in olive oil (way too salty), followed by tomato soup which I didn't love like the waiter described it.  As for dinner, my friend had lobster dish which was tiny size with small potion of veggies like turnip ($42), and I had  rib eye steak which was 8 -10 bites (approx $36 I think - I didn't pay too much attention to cost).  Since portions were not big, we had room for dessert.  We shared the beignet (warm donut) with vanilla & chocolate sauce to dip in, they were delish and big portion!   I'm glad ending was nice :). I'm sure the whole idea for small portion is so you can have 4-5 course meal.  Thus, overall, I give 3 stars.", "author": "K L."}

A preeminent ownership group, a star chef, and a ton of money, all  in a city that adores both dining and novelty!  It was sort of like the Simpsons movie - no matter how good it was, it would nevertheless disappoint.  And when judged within this context, it did.  Much less so than the Simpsons movie, but still.\n\nBut, if judged in a vacuum of sorts, Spruce is a damn good restaurant and one that will only get better once the kitchen gels.  The no-nonsense cuisine is spot-on - preparations and platings are simple and straightforward and the ingredients are pristine.  Perfectly fresh and lightly grilled mushrooms are simply adorned with a bit of pecorino in a light dressing.  The foie gras torchon has the consistency of dense butter and an incredibly pure flavor - on par with any place in the city.  And the pork...ooh, the pork.  A loin grilled medium and sliced diagonally in two is paired with a generous square of slow cooked belly that just melts in your mouth.  \n\nHowever,  there are some conceptual oddities.  The aforementioned pork was paired with chewy beans that, while good by themselves, added nothing to the dish.  They tasted like they would be welcome in a salad and not as an accompaniment to a main dish.  Likewise, the tuna was sliced rather thinly and pan fried only one one side, where it was crispy and overdone.\n\nThe wine and spirit list is masterfully chosen and, thank Jesus, is replete with myriad California growers, bucking a recent trend of serving mostly European offerings.  Markups are on the high side but whose aren't these days?  The decor is simply stunning and incredibly chic, as is the crowd.  This place has become a playground for the well-heeled.  I am told that weekend tables are booked six weeks in advance.  \n\nSpruce is already a very good restaurant and once it ditches the (mostly self-created) hype and continues to refine its food, it may enter the upper echelon of the bay area dining scene.", "author": "Yan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-05-29", "description": "If I could rate Spruce on the merits of their food and their food alone, they'd easily be 4 stars.  Unfortunately for them, so much goes into a dining experience above and beyond the food itself.  My experience here was one of those situations where everything else about the restaurant easily outweighed the food that was served us.\n\nHad late reservations for a Sunday night, spent 30 minutes at the bar having cocktails (quite good too actually, albeit pricey even by SF standards).  Got seated in a corner and started with appetizers.  Charcuterie for the wife and I got the carrot and cardamom soup.  She loved her platter and devoured it (particularly raved about the duck liver mousse) and my soup was quite tasty although I did end up having to season it a little further.  We also ordered the fries.... amazing.  Probably our favorite thing of the night surprisingly.\n\nAll was good at this point, but then the troubles started to occur.  We'd been seated and had our orders taken by the hostess.. odd, but we didn't think much of it.  But soon it dawned on us that we hadn't really seen our waitress at all.  Even our appetizers were brought by someone who wasn't our waitress.  Our dishes, now empty, sat there.  And sat.  And sat.  Until nearly 20 minutes of idle time finally passed and our waitress finally appeared to remove the plates.\n\nEntrees soon arrive.  Pork tenderloin and pork belly for the wife, steak and \"duck fat fries\" for me.  The tenderloin was a generous portion and tasty.  The pork belly, while extremely tender, was relatively flavor less.  My steak was wonderfully prepared and tasted amazing.  The duck fat fries sadly turned out to be over cooked potatoes with crispy (but tasty) skins, but ultra bland inside.  Throughout the course, I was hoping to place an order for another cocktail or at least get my glass of water refilled, but alas, no waitress.  Again.\n\nAnd then once again we played the empty dish table sitting game.  This time nearly 30 minutes pass before dishes were cleared and dessert menus brought out.  By now, we'd been seated for nearly 2 and a half hours on simply appetizers and entrees.  While some of the choices on the dessert menu sounded interesting (particularly the beignets), we weren't willing to risk having to sit for ANOTHER hour just for that.  And thus, we called it a nightl, paid our bill and walked off.\n\nThe restaurant is gorgeous with tall ceilings, exposed duct work, and white marble throughout.  The hostesses and bartenders were friendly and accommodating.  Food was a bit uneven, but had several high points for us.  The wait staff however just ruined the experience and that alone is what crushes their score.\n\nI'd consider coming back if I ever heard that they addressed wait staff issues, but monitoring other reviews, it certainly doesn't look like I'm alone in having these types of problems with the front of house.", "author": "James N."}

We arrived early and was able to sit down. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who was very quiet. Ordered some drinks and some apps. That was pretty much the last time we saw our waiter.

Great choices. \n\nFor dinner we decided on the Duck and the Steak. Last minute we asked for an order of french fries as well. Well the duck was delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. As for the steak, well that is a different story. Though the flavors of the dish complimented each other, the piece of meat in itself was horrible. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it to be, but it was extremely tough and chewy. I really should have taken it back. The steak was accompanied by some duck fat potatoes, but those lacked in taste overall. All together was not happy with my meal. On top of that we never received our french fries. He actually completely forgot about them. \n\nBeing annoyed with my meal I thought I would try a dessert. I will say that the Beignets were hot and delicious, and were paired with yummy sauces. \n\nI will have to say that I was extremely disappointed in my experience here. I would have hoped that the service would be impeccable, but that was not the case. In addition, I really expected the food to be out of this world.

The tables are large and can accomodate large parties. The bar is very pretty looking. The wine list is very very long but there is a great selection of half bottles, wines by the glass and bottles under $50 in red or white. \n\nThey have a few different menus.

Short ribs, halibut, sea bass, lobster, pork tenderloin, steak, caviar, etc. You name it, they had it. \n\nA very expensive place but well worth it. Dinner for two, about $150-200.

A wonderful combination and degustation of all of their \"cold cuts, cured meats, patees and mousse\" along with warm, and toasty buttered bread.\nThe caviar/croquettes ($15) was a melt-in-your-mouth experience... very small portion, like a palate teaser.\n\nThe entrees:\n1. Steak bavette (French word for \"Flank Steak\", always sounds better in French) with fries and bordelaise sauce: classic combo meal - not outstanding though for $29, and the meat was bit too chewy to my taste.  \n2. Bass with dungeness crab in butter champagne sauce: heavenly!  Light, fragrant, succulent... just succulent.  Good thing I still had some bread left, otherwise I would have licked the plate clean with the sauce that was left.\n\nThe desserts: \n1. Warm apple sundae with rum raisin ice cream\n2. Beignets with chocolate sauce and creme anglaise\nA+ on the desserts!  Flawless!\n\nWhy the minus one star? \nMy husband's seat got bumped 7 times from the staff's traffic, going back and forth from the dining room towards the \"cafe\" room separated by the curtain.

Went opening night on August 3rd for my girl, J's birthday and it was truly a fine dining experience.  And that's pretty amazing for an opening night.  \nI mean, sure they need to work out some new restaurant kinks, but believe you me, these kinks were minute.\nVery Impressive.\n\nWe walked into this extraordinary, warm and beautifully defined space and were greeted warmly by the staff.  We had to wait about 30 minutes until we were sat, but the Restaurant Manager and the Hostess checked in with us periodically to let us know how much time it would be.   Until then, we enjoyed our Cocktails and were appeased.\n\nOnce we sat down, we found the Wine List to be extensive and a bit overwhelming, so we summoned for the Sommelier to help us choose a Bottle of Wine and ended up with a nice Viognier.  Big Fan of Viogners lately.  Light & Refreshing.\nOne odd thing about the experience was that the Sommelier asked if I wanted to go back with him to the Wine Cellar to choose a bottle of Vino.  It wasn't in a downstairs dungeon or anything, but in the back of the restaurant in these beautiful glass-doored rooms.  It was Huge! \nIn retrospect, I would have gone, it was just unexpected as I've never been asked to do that before.  I mean, is this something that I just am not aware of?  Ah well...\n\nFor our Appetizers, we shared a Salad of Heirloom Watermelon & Sardines.  I know, it sounds like a strange combination, but I am seeing this in many other restaurants of this calibre/genre.  It was not a fave of the Ladies, but I liked it ok.  We also had a Crudo of Arctic Char, which we all liked a lot.\n\nFor Our Mains, I had the the Pan-Roasted Duck Breast topped with Buttery Foie Gras.  Loved it...  Duck + Duck = How can you go wrong?\nJZ had the Short Ribs which were fantastic, although I like the one from Range a little bit more.  J had the Ribeye, which was good, but she's a 'No Blood' kinda gal, so I can't really give it my true opinion as I like my Meat medium rare...\nUnfortunately, I cannot remember what Mills had.  I think she had a Chicken Dish...\n\nFor Dessert, we had the Semolina Cake which was a hit with the Girls and no not 'my Girls', I meant My Ladies.  I think I am learning that I am of the Light & Refreshing Dessert category.\n\nI thought Service was pretty good for Opening Night.\n\nI am sure that I will be back to do it again...", "author": "Rose C R."}

It's got massively high ceilings, a bar straight out of a science fiction movie, and even a corner reserved for the charcutier.\n\nOur server was friendly and had some nice recommendations.  I was feeling adventurous the evening wifey and I went and decided to go for the cardiac arrest special... every course designed to clog an important coronary artery.  Started with a fatty (and flavorful) charcuterie plate.  Looked around the vast expanse of a room and  saw the \"butcher\" in his own little section of the restaurant preparing the protein and fat-laden goodies for me... nice.\n\n**Service complaint**  \nWhen my charcuterie hit the table, no one bothered to explain what the hell was on my plate.  There were about five delicious looking selections which were nicely presented, but our server disappeared soon after delivery.  So other than the house-made bologna, I have no idea what I ate.  Guess I could've flagged down someone, but I was in a thrill-seeking mood at the time.\n\nFatty goodness though.\n\nMoved on to a juicy duck entree.  Generous portions, but presented with fairly mundane sides.\n\nEnded with an artery-clogging cheese plate consisting of some great European selections.  Spruce breaks down their cheeses into American vs. European - probably to stir up some cross-atlantic rivalry, huh?  Bonus points for including plenty of bread, fruit, and standard condiments for my cheese.\n\nIn the end, four stars for slightly off-kilter service and unremarkable accompaniments to highlight our entrees.\n\nAfter dinner, wifey and I headed straight to the nearest ER to peruse the latest cardiac catheterization specials.", "author": "Gracie-C Y."}

Quite popular right now, we wanted to check out the place before committing to a full meal. This is a gorgeous restaurant in a quiet residential neighborhood. Very unassuming and inconspicuous which is a kind of sexy in a secretive way. Prior to entering the restaurant, you can see on the left side a large storefront window. At the counter, you'll see a selection of cheeses being cut up to be served to the hungry patrons. Ok, you haven't gone in yet...on the right side is a \"garden room\", this room reminds me of the lounge at Le Colonial. Great place to have a drink while waiting for your table, or just have drinks.\n\nThen you go inside...it's dark and beautiful with high ceilings. The space is split into two parts, with a long bar on the right side of the room.  If you head toward the back, you'll see the collection of wines in a temperature-controlled \"glass closet\".  They also have a private room in the back, which looks like it could sit about 50?  I am not sure, just a quick look.\n\nWe got lucky and took 4 seats at the bar. The seats were made of ostrich leather. So comfortable and wide - just like I was sitting at a table. I had a glass of champagne. The girls had between them a glass of wine and two cocktails. I had a sip of each cocktail - something with freshly muddled berries, and the other was a type of tart lemon martini. We were a little hungry so we ordered a pound of mussels and two orders of fries to share between the four of us. The mussels were $16 a pound and worth every cent.  Looking around us, and at the bar, people were having cheese, the charcuterie and the mussels.  They had a sampler platter for their charcuterie, and also one for their cheeses.  I think they also may have a tasting menu for dinner.  Dan the bartender was very nice to us and has a rich baritone voice.  Suzanne is a dear.\n\nOk, here's the part that Spruce may need a little brushing up on. Breaking dishes. Ok, dishes and glasses break.  But if you're obviously piling on the dishes too high for you to carry back to the kitchen, someone should help the poor man or he should come back for them.  We heard the breaking of dishes twice. We observed that there was a broken cup or bowl filled with liquid. While it didn't seem to splatter on the patrons sitting right next to the table being cleared, the noise was distracting, and I wouldn't want to be the guy in his nice slacks getting potentially souped on.\n\nOtherwise, all went well, and I think I will come back for a fancy dinner.", "author": "Betty L."}

Food is exceptional - charcuterie was amazing with some of the best cured meats around, plus whatever was in that ramekin made my palate melt; halibut and pork belly dishes were very tasty - perfectly crispy pork belly. The veal sweetbreads were well balanced and delicious. \n\nMoreover, my husband and I loved that they had Domaine Weinbach on their wine menu - a L'lnedit no less.

The place is absolutely gorgeous.  Since our reservations were at 6:00, our tables were ready when we arrived, but we felt like sitting at the bar and having a cocktail first before venturing in the dining room.  The cocktails were nice, a little weak on the alcohol if you ask me, but then again, I like my drinks super strong.\n\nAfter our cocktail, we were seated at our table.  My friend had requested one of the middle tables, so we were slightly disappointed when we didn't get a table in the middle, but decided not to bring it up...  No big deal.\n\nWe started with the European Cheese plate.  It was pretty good, even though the waiter forgot to substitute the blue cheese with something else...  Then we shared the Caesar Salad, which ended up being the highlight of my dinner.  Seriously, I am not joking, and I am not trying to be funny.  The Caesar Salad was just the most fantastic Caesar Salad I had ever had.  The grated cheese was so fine that it basically melted in your mouth.  For our entrees, my friend had the lobster, and I had the steak.  I was really looking forward to getting the Short Ribs, which I had heard was amazing, but unfortunately, the waiter told us that they had taken it off the menu a week earlier...  Boo.

The steak was okay, and the lobster was really good.\n\nOverall, I think the ambiance is classy, the decor/restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and I would totally be back for the Caesar Salad!

We also really enjoyed the watermelon soda float dessert -- it was very refreshing.  For entrees, we ordered the panini and the burger.

(So is a Pimm's cup the new \"in\" drink? Everybody's got one these days...) \n\nWe experienced two \"new restaurant just opening up\" glitches. On the one hand, we waited about 30 minutes past our initial reservation time before we got a table (luckily, we found a way to pass the time -- see the above note on cocktails). On the other hand, they accidentally gave us two amuse bouches. So I guess those even out.\n\nAppetizers were great. The cod-and-corn chowder was excellent, and they serve it by giving you a bowl full of dry ingredients first, then pouring in the liquid at the table, so that your ingredients don't get a chance to go soggy. I love when restaurants do that. The spearmint-and-harvest-greens ravioli was fantastic. I know it doesn't sound like much, but it was definitely worth ordering.\n\nEntrees were also excellent. My wife got the albacore, which was very good. I got the short ribs, which had a perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. And it tasted great, too.\n\nDesserts were also good. My wife was a huge fan of the semolina cake (served with Strauss cream sorbet and berries). I got the chocolate fondant, which was merely good -- nothing wrong with it, but there's I guess only so much you can do with chocolate ganache. I think next time, I'd try something a little more unique in the dessert category.\n\nA very large wine selection full of wines that I've never seen before. Our wine was good, but I don't remember what I ordered. (See the above note on cocktails.)\n\nService was polite and prompt. The dinner was not cheap, but neither was it outrageous for the quality of the food.

The food, atmosphere and service is always of the highest caliber and there is never, ever room for error.  As an example of the service and staff, just the other day while dining at Spruce for lunch, my sister started pulling change out to go feed her meter.  One of the management staff, Megan (sp?) happened to be walking by the table and offered to feed the meter for my sister, and this was unsolicited.  The feeling at this restaurant is that each and every one of their guests really is important to them; and and as a guest, you feel it.  \n\nThe food is always amazing.  I would be remiss in not mentioning the wine list, or the drink list.  \n\nSpruce is an exceptional restaurant offering an exceptional experience.  Bon apetit!\n\nMy original review:\nOne super-hot sexy interior with a sizzling bar and lounge area;  chocolate brown mohair, chocolate brown woods mixed with honey colored ostrich skin......Ooh la la.  Upon entry is the library on the right with a cozy fireplace.  Nice place to hang out and converse.  To the left is the cafe where you can purchase food on the fly, or a coffee, espresso or tea - they have an great list of coffee's and teas, custom blended.  \n\nOpening night did not disappoint.  The menu is  full without being too much; there is something for everyone.  So.  To start, we ordered the entire appetizer menu, to share, for four.  The chef sent each appetizer out as it complimented and supported the next.  It was an experience I will not soon forget.  The entrees were phenomenal.  All four that we had ordered were exceptional.  Another facet is the wine list.  It is extensive.  The sommeliers are genius and we were comfortable talking with them. Nothing stand-off-ish.  No snobbery.  For those cocktailing, full club service is offered and it comes off seamlessly.   \n\nSo, the rest of the 'experience?\" Desserts?  Well.  How do you say \"brilliant,\" without sounding trite?  Exceptional?  Amazing?  Okay, I'll just say \"OFF THE HOOK!!!!!\"  The pastry chef obviously understands that dessert is the final course and he accords each the highest esteem and regard: his love of the craft and the delight it creates.  Bon appetit.  This is what dessert is ALL about.  Try it.  You'll like it.  And, you will be very well surprised. \n\nService? Impeccable. \n\nMy impression: this was the finest, and most approachable gastronomic experience that I have had in many years.  I will be back, oh, I will be back.\n\nAND I have been. AND.

However, the man on the phone invited us to come down and sit at the bar where full dinner is served. We were on the scene about 5 minutes later, where we proceeded to stand, unwelcomed I should add, at the maitre' d stand for at least 5 minutes. There was a man (I'm assuming the person I talked to on the phone) and a woman who both seemed awfully busy moving menus from one side of the stand to the other and both did a few trips around the restaurant before finally one of them said hello. We were actually about to leave - this is how rude they were.\n\nFinally, someone figured out that we were standing in front of them breathing and looking hungry and the rest of the evening proceeded swimmingly.\n\nThe wine list is seriously about 100 pages long. We were almost overwhelmed, so we each had one of their signature Gin Drinks.  \"Bees Knees\" for me and \"Between the Sheets\" for him.Wow. I haven't had a gin cocktail since college and I'm pretty sure I've been missing out. These were spectacular.\n\nWe then moved on to the Charcuterie - opting for the Grand Selection. The chorizo, foie gras and pate were our favorites. The bologna was really bland and the cured pig ears was just too soft and salty for my taste. Overall, the selection was excellent however. (pig ears, really??)\n\nFor entrees we had the short ribs (slow braised with grilled peaches - absolute perfection) and the lobster. Both were rich and satisfying and really flavorful. I would recommend them both highly.\n\nWe rounded dinner out with several glasses of wine. If I hadn't just finished drinking them, I might be un-tipsy enough to tell you what we had. The Melville Chardonnay was the standout, but all were very good.\n\nDespite the rocky start with the rude dis-service, the rest of the evening was wonderful Our waiter, Kelly, was truly fantastic. Helpful, informative and funny - he gets 5 stars from me even though his co-workers prevented a 5 star rating for the restaurant overall. The timing and service is perfect once you sit down.\n\nThe decor is rich and inviting and surprisingly warm for a huge space with high ceilings. The lush fireplace lit library would be a great place to gather for an intimate birthday gathering or Saturday night triple-date.\n\nHighly recommended - just remember to be a bit assertive when you arrive otherwise you may be overlooked.", "author": "Megan L."}

It shouldn't be impossible or anything to get a reservation at a decent restaurant in SF on a Saturday night last minute. No problem, I'll take care of it. I went on Open Table (all the while thinking my bf is crazy) and what do I find-a reservation for Spruce. So I snatch it up and off we go, and boy am I glad we did. \n\nWhen we got there it was crazy busy and there where 2-3 different private parties going on. I was a little concerned about being seated on time (because I hadn't eaten since breakfast and couldn't wait to get my hands on some food) but despite the craziness we were seated right on time (1 star.) The service was a little less attentive then I would have liked in the beginning, but I sensed that our waiter was a little in the weeds, so I gave it time. As the night wore on the service became better as he slowed down and also what he lacked in attentiveness in the beginning of the night he made up for in personality and knowledge, as did the rest of the wait staff. (The sommelier seemed to be a little bit of a pretentious bitch, but we didn't really deal with him so still 1 star.) Now; on to the food.\n\nThe food was amazing from start to finish. We started by splitting the beet salad; then I had the sweetbreads, and the bf had the pumpkin soup. For entrees he had the short ribs and I had the steak with the potatoes cooked in duck confit (I can't resist something cooked in duck fat,;it is just too good.

Additionally, they have 3 wine cellars!\n\nThe service is awesome; so nice, knowledgeable and comfortable not snooty. \n\nGood tip: If you don't feel like paying for an expensive meal they also have seating at the bar and at a few tables around the bar.

As we were walking out the door to dinner we found the newest edition of SF magazine in the mailbox and lo and behold--a two page spread on Spruce inside.  This only feuled the fire to come and eat some charcuterie and yummy yummy duck fat potatoes.  Mmmm.  \n\nI started off with the Honeymoon cocktail--it was fabulous.  I think another benefit of shaking the cocktail table-side is that they don't spill half of it transporting it to your table.  I had a hefty beverage and didn't get sticky fingers from spillage on the glass.  \n\nMy fiance had the charcuterie, and it was a well rounded selection.  Another serious plus was that they gave us loads of bread to accompany the meats--some places just give you a slice or two and then you run out and feel sad.  Spruce included a generous basket of toasty bread slices.  They also sent out a cup of cauliflower soup, and some beet chips with sauce to get us started.  They grow all their produce themselves and the farmer brings it up daily.  The waiter told us that most things are picked that day for our meal.  \n\nI had the steak with potatoes and it was good.  It met my expectations.  My fiance had the lobster fricasee and that exceeded my expectations.  The sauce was so rich and buttery!  It was expensive and a relatively small portion, but very tasty.  We shared a half bottle of Robert Sinsky cab and that was a good fit for my steak.  \n\nWe ended with the beignets and they were heavenly.  Fluffy morsels of fried goodness.  They paired well with the coffee--they give you a pitcher of your coffee selection, so there's plenty to go around.  \n\nIt was a good time, in a lovely atmosphere, and cost about $180 (tip included) for two people.", "author": "Eleanor E."}

They really did not cut any corners.\n\nWe shared all of our dishes: 3 app's, and three mains. They were all excellent, especially the glazed duck breast. It is the best duck breast that I remember having ever. Perfectly cooked, really tender and succulent. Delicious.\n\nI can not fault the service in any way. It was efficient and unobtrusive, almost invisible. The mechanics of it were spot on, everything was where it should have been when it should have been there.\n\nWe passed on dessert so I can't comment on that.\n\nWe had two bottles of wine, both of which were under $50 and they were both excellent. They have an encyclopedic wine list, too big for me, it would require a weeks study. Though they do have a really cool section of good wines under $50, this is where both of our wines came from.\n\nOur bill was almost $300 plus tip, all 3 of us felt it was worth every penny. We all dine out a lot, usually at more casual restaurants.\n\nThe crowd is a bit stuffy and older (very conservative white money) though it did not permeate the atmosphere for us.\n\nAll in all the experience was superb. \n\nThere are many fancy expensive restaurants in the city living on old hype that do not deliver any value for money. \nThis is not one of those restaurants!\n\nIt exudes elegance and quality and is a breath of fresh air amongst its would-be peers.", "author": "Lucius A."}

We ordered the lobster and steak for dinner but I wish I Would have ordered the ahi or the pork instead, ugh. I was pressured by the waiter and my BF to get the lobster and it was just o much butter sauce for me personally. Maybe if it had come on the side I would have enjoyed it. And I dont think that I enjoy gnocchi either becuase I couldn't eat more then two of them, they just tasted way to heavy for me. Any how, the steak was amazing, cooked just perfectly to our liking and served with a great sauce and these tasty duck fat potatoes. \n  dessert was the best, we ordered the chocalate peanut butter bar which the server described with a fruit jelly, which I actually thought sounded weird but it was actually the best part of it. They wrote happy 1 year to us on the plate and I thought that was cute. Our server, who was amazing, dont remember his name but he let us split a glass of champagne to toast.

A very nice selection of red Burgundy.  One Malbec and one that is well distributed.\n\nMy food selection began with the seared dayboat scallops with caramelized cauliflower; quite memorable.  For my second, I had the grilled Bavette steak with duck fat potatoes--they got my request for preparing my steak as I had requested (this is a hard one wherever I go--seems to be a no-brainer) so I appreciate when I get what I ask for--the duck fat potatoes were moist, gorgeous, delightful--I could eat these every day.\n \nI closed with the Chocolate Terrine which was rich and a perfect portion--not too large, not too small; just right after all that I consumed.\n\nI would go back to try more of their offering and look forward to enjoying their environs, food and wine.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

We made reservations for a Wednesday night on OpenTable several months ago and were greatly excited when the day finally arrived.  The space is amazing - I almost gasped when I walked in because it's so beautiful.  The private dining room at the front- precious - and something I'd like to think about doing in the future.\n\nWe got there a little early and waited a few minutes for a spot at the bar.  Had two of their specialty cocktails - both very yummy and a fun way to start the night.\n\nThe tables are massive - with enough room to put all your food and drink in the beautiful dining room.\n\nIn the end bf and I ordered:\n- mussels off the bar menu (it's so great they let you order off both the regular and bar menus in either place - great thinking!) and they were SO fresh and delicious.  They come out in an all clad skillet and were delicious.\n- duck fat fries to go w/ the mussles.  hands down the best fries I have ever had. ever.\n- steak w/ duck fat potatoes (I had) - delicious and HUGE portions.  I couldn't finish my plate though I wanted to.\n- bf had the sea bass - which was perfectly cooked and impeccable.  mashed potatoes were creamy delicious.\n\nfinished w/ a chocolate hazelnut dessert that was beautifully presented, but actually didn't dazzle. no matter, this is still a five star restaurant for me!\n\nonly have one little complaint, asked about champagne and the girl recommended me a $25 glass w/out telling me the price.  I'm not cheap, but I think $25 for one single glass of champagne is a bit pricey and should be disclosed.\n\nOh and thanks for the tasting of the cauliflower soup - I wanted more!", "author": "Jen L."}

We walked in at 9:30 assuming we could get atleast a seat at the bar and the hostess looked at us like it might be difficult.  We waited it out, and they came through and sat us at 10pm on the dot.  I really appreciated them taking the extra effort.\n\n1 star for a great Sommelier.  The wine list is a bit daunting and extensive, we gave some suggestions of types of wines we were looking for an he came up with an excellent suggestion.  The wine list has everything from very expensive to pretty reasonable, so I appreciated the fact that he picked one based on what we said we wanted.\n\nThe food, the cheese plate was great.  I thought my friends carrot soup was not.  The soup was tasty, however, its came with this almond creme on top which completely overpowered the carrot.  \nFor entrees, a friend got the steak that looked fabulous.  My husband got the duck, if nothing else, GO THERE FOR THIS DUCK.  It is very rich but oh so delicious.  The flavors all meshed together wonderfully.  As for me, I got the lobster with gnocchi.  DO NOT GET THIS.  Completely under seasoned dish of food.  The gnocchi was nothing more than soft potatoes and added nothing to the dish.  I found that for the most expensive item on the menu they really should have been able to atleast season this dish properly.  \n\nLastly, we finished with dessert, and ofcourse the beignets.  They were great.  Their entire dessert menu looked fantastic.  \n\nAll and all a great dinining experience.  Quite a sophisticated scene.", "author": "Jaime C."}

We had a reservation, but arrived early to sit at the bar, catch up and have a few drinks. While we were chatting, we discussed many things, some of them cocktail related. I said something about how my husband stood in line for 4 hours at St George Spirits for absinthe, and the bartender piped up, \"we have St George's absinthe\" and I said \"oh so do i, my husband stood in the crazy line, we didn't realize how long it would be\" to which he said \"he probably stood in line for the iPhone too. He should have just bought some Chartreuse and called it a day.\" \n\nUm, yes, we have fancy phones- of course we do, look at where we are eating. And FYI, Chartreuse and absinthe are not the same, AND I already have Chartreuse at home- both kinds, thank you very much. \nI love snark, please dish it out, but at least know what you are talking about and use some humor. \n\nDinner was good- charcuterie plate was interesting- could have done without the head cheese (really, why do they call that cheese? I guess it's better than calling congealed grossness). The European cheese plate was also interesting. I had the sea bass, all the other ladies had the sole. It was all delicious. Our servers were fantastic, they overhead a few choice conversations, and handled them with grace and humor. And they were especially accommodating to myself and my girlfriend who are gluten free (they brought fruit for the cheese platter). \n\nOverall for food I would give this place a 4+ but the sour taste in my mouth from the judgmental bartender knocks them down. The space is beautiful, but I don't know if the cost is worth it. Also, update your website already- it isn't that hard.", "author": "Karen P."}

I love the swanky feel of Spruce, it reminds me a little of Bix, I love the older moneyed crowd, what can I say, it makes me feel like someday I might be rich and alcoholic too.\nWhat I really love though is the food. I love old school American fare done well, their burger and fries are amazing, especially the fries. I'm a sucker for duck fat fries, these are amazing, super crispy on the outside and fluffy soft on the inside. The burger comes on a sweet brioche bun with pickled red onions, a sweet pickle, a tomato and a piece of romaine lettuce. The burger was divine, the patty was juicy and meaty and I love a sweet bun with a burger, I feel like it really enhances the taste of the beef. We also shared an English pea ravioli in a lovely decadent but light butter sauce and the french omelet which was fluffy and filled with brie. Decadent but amazing. I am going to add Spruce to my steady rotation of restaurants.", "author": "Cathy T."}

It was disapointing to see small, appetizer size orders for the full meal prices we paid.  It was very expensive for the amount of food we were given.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-28", "description": "The short:\nFabulous food, fabulous drink, sexy environment, slightly-off service.\n\nThe long:\nSpruce is a dark, elegant, swanky space with a high, exposed-beam ceiling.  It's moderately noisy, but plenty easy to talk to your dining companions unless they're whispering across the table at you.\nWe walked in a few minutes early, and our table was already ready.  Nice!  Unfortunately, after sitting down we had 20 minutes to peruse the menus before anyone arrived to take our drink orders.  Water arrived almost instantaneously after each of us sat down (our group of 7 trickled in over the course of about 5 minutes), so the bus crew was clearly on top of things.\nOnce he arrived, our waiter was very friendly, enthusiastic, and quite knowledgeable about the menu, and our round of cocktails was truly excellent.\n\nThe menu is so chock-full of amazing entrees that we all had real trouble deciding what to order.  Judging from what came out, I doubt a poor decision was possible.\n\nWe started with the charcuterie plate, which was wonderful.  It takes a bit of time to prepare - each plate is put together individually - and ours had I believe 7 (incredibly) different tasty meats.  It includes a bit of bitter greens, stone-ground mustard, and a napkin-encased collection of toasted bread slices.  Worth every penny.\n\nOur appetizers were equally good -\nChantenay Carrot Soup with Sultanas & Almonds was impressively rich and creamy.\nForaged nettle and green garlic soup with soft poached egg was UNBELIEVABLY green, incredibly fresh (and green) tasting, and much lighter than the carrot soup.  Plus, they pour the soup into the bowl, which arrives with the egg and a few other things in it, at table, which is cool.\nCaramelized Dayboat scallops with fava beans looked fantastic (3 scallops), and disappeared before I got a chance to sample it.\nFinally, the French Omelette (which is on a separate small menu of other items) was just absurdly good.  My friend commented after ordering it that an omelette is classically considered The Measure of how good a chef is.  By this measure, Spruce's chef is indeed a Master.  Such fluffiness, richness, and astounding depth of cheesiness!  I was blown away.  By an omelette.  Yeah.\n\nWe paired these with a crisp, slightly off-dry Riesling recommended by the sommelier, which I quite enjoyed.  The wine list is ridiculous: 1300+ wines.  It's utterly overwhelming, even if you are very knowledgeable about wine.  There are 2 things to know: First, the list has one page each of \"white wines up to $60\" and \"red wines up to $60.\"  This is a brilliant and helpful concept.  Second, ask the sommelier for a recommendation.  She knows the list and food intimately, and is the best way to get a wine you'll like.\n\nMain courses!\nThe Roasted Ocean Trout had the color of salmon, incredibly, and looked quite good.\nThe Grilled Yellowtail was flaky and tender (I only got a wee taste).\nThe Charred Berkshire Pork Tenderloin with crispy pork belly and shelling beans was incredible.  Deeply pink inside, but with unbelievable depth of flavor, and the belly was all the rich indulgence you could ever wish, without being so fatty as to be a turn off.  The giant white beans were marvels of intensity unto themselves.  Possibly the best giant beans I've ever had, and I've had a lot of amazing beans.\nYoung Spring Lamb, with vegetables Grand-Mere and citrus & star anise jus.  Yowza.  Lamb 3 ways - rack of lamb, crisped on the outside to the point of being almost as if it were surrounded in a magical lamb bacon of salty, smoky absurdity, moist and tender richness inside which ended up more medium than medium-rare, but I couldn't really complain.  Slices of a flawlessly medium-rare lamb (loin?  I forgot what the cut was, sadly) for mild, meaty goodness, and then... lamb belly.  WHA?!  Yeah.  Just like the pork belly, except lamb.  Holy shit.  It was as if a whole new world of wonder meat had opened before me.  All the rich, melty, crispy incredibleness of the pork belly, but with an intense, wonderful lamb flavor.  Wow.  The vegetables (especially the tiny potatoes) were fantastic, and the jus was beyond rich and meaty.\n\nWith these, we had a Cotes-du-Rhone, bone dry and very leathery & earthy; very French.  It paired fabulously with the lamb.\n\nDesserts:\nThe chocolate brownies, which looked incredible, and all of which disappeared before I had a chance to try them.  Hmph.\nBanana cake, enveloped in a chocolate banana mousse, over a chocolate sauce, with a lime sorbet.   This was fascinating, and the very sour sorbet balanced the very sweet cake intensely.  We also had some excellent rums and a delicious and somewhat unusual muscat dessert wine.\n\nWhat a meal!  Then we endured our 2nd long wait of the night for our server to collect the check.  Hopefully he just had an off night, and this is atypical.  But at Spruce's price point, service should be more attentive.  So only 4 stars for now, but the food was fully worth the cost.  I'll try it again!", "author": "Don H."}

At this point, I haven't eaten at Spruce for a few months so I won't go into what I loved/liked (it's probably changed).

If you just want to go to get a few drinks and an inexpensive bite try the burger its great, or just go for desert which almost everything on the menu is fantastic! .\n\nThe restaurant also has a bakery, which has great cookies and desert to go..

There are lots of restaurants within an eight-block or so radius. I suggested a few, and just for fun included Spruce. Lo and behold, she had always wanted to go there too. So, it was a date. \n\nThe best way to kick off any meal is with a cocktail. I went with a classic, the Aviation, which is Martin Miller's Gin, lemon, Maraschino Liqueur and Cr\u00e8me de Violette.  My friend also went the cocktail route, but chose to go with the Honey Elderflower Daiquiri which is Mount Gay Rum, St. Germain Liqueur, honey and lime. \n\nI went in with my heart set on the lobster. I was almost tempted to try the special (filet mignon with duck comfit roasted potatoes), but I decided to go with something the restaurant is particularly are known for. It was absolutely delicious. The butter sauce that accompanied the lobster had a touch of saffron and fresh herbs and the golden potato gnocchi melted in your mouth. I also love the braised greens. My friend's Moroccan-spiced chicken was perfectly seasoned and equally delicious. I particularly like the tiny onions and honeyed dates that accompanied it.  There was the option to have truffle shavings on your dish. I was really, really tempted, but passed, both to keep cost down abut also because I believe in trying a dish as its supposed to be, especially if I've never had it before. I doubt I will go again during truffle season, but it would definitely be something I would want to do in the future if the option arose again.  \n\nEverything on the dessert menu looked scrumptious. We ended up choosing a hazelnut/chocolate dessert with chocolate ice cream (it had a fancier name, which I forgot to write down). The ice cream was silky smooth and the torte was positively wonderful. The Indian spice in the ice cream gave it a unique flavor that balanced really well with the toasted nuts that were part of the garnish. I would definitely have it again. Although, I would want to try the apple dessert with cinnamon ice cream (again it had a fancier name) or possibly completely skip the sweets and head directly to the cheese.\n\nDuring the course of our meal, we had not one, not two, but three amuse bouche courses. Two were starters, and the third ended our meal. The first little taste was a wonderful cheese puff that was light and very cheesy. The second, which closely followed the first, was a demitasse cup of onion soup that tasted like it had been spike with maple syrup or something equally sweet. It was silky on the tongue and had a nice flavor. At the end of the meal, we were serve passion fruit pate de fruits and a pistachio confection. Both were quite delightful. The passion fruit candy was absolutely bursting with flavor. It was a great way to end a really good meal. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is lovely. Muted lighting, leather chairs, all sepia and earth tones with modern flourishes. We had a great table in the back that allowed us to look out at the other diners, but still feel like were in an intimate setting. In fact, I think this would be exactly the kind of place people go to get engaged or to celebrate something big. Apart from the staff, Wendy and I were two of the youngest people there, although I would say it leans towards a hip older crowd versus a stodgy one. In more practical terms, the service is good. The restaurant also offers valet parking out front. All of which add up to a genuinely nice experience.", "author": "Nicole M."}

FYI - it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a normal dinner hour reservation on a Fri or Sat night. I went on a Tues night, so it wasn't too busy but all the tables were full. \n\nMy friend and I get there about 40 min early, so we start off at the bar. I order a Spruce Goose - a delicious cocktail that involved lighting the drink on fire, and my friend inquires about the beer list. We thought the bartender would recommend a couple of his favorites, but instead we get a 20-min description of every beer available. He even brings out one of the bottles to show us how we can identify it if we ever see it in a grocery store. It's nice to know that the people who work at Spruce are knowledgeable and friendly, but I think that might've been a little too much. Still, the guy was nice, so oh well.\n\nNext, to the table. My friend and I are seated in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by lots of Old, White, and Rich (OWR). Oh, and throw in a couple Fancy Rich White Gays across the room. You know, just a typical Tuesday night dinner. Nothing special. \n\nWe were presented with the menu at the bar, so both of us had an idea of what we wanted. For appetizers, we ordered the Foie Gras and Sweetbreads. For the main dish, we decided to share the special - a 4 lb Tomahawk grass-fed ribeye steak - $150. Yes, it was as amazing as it sounds. If you decide to come to Spruce with a decent sized group, I would recommend that as a plate to share because it was AMAZING, but a little too much for two people who had just consumed two appetizers and too much to drink. \n\nOverall... I would say Spruce definitely lives up to the hype. But if you're going to come here, don't skimp out on any aspect of the menu - you know it's going to make a dent in your wallet, so at least make the experience memorable and go all out.", "author": "Leily P."}

To start we ordered the burger, fisherman mussels garlic crostone,(savor the broth with the crostone)  ricotta ravioli,  and carrot soup.

I had just had coffee (Blue Bottle from Pizzetta 211), but cookies had me!  We got the chocolate chip cookies and the oatmeal with dried apricots and cherries.  WOW.  If any of you have read the New York Times article on the perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie then this is the place in SF to find it!  These cookies are massive, giving them the three distinct textures; soft, chewy, and crunchy rings.  They also must be using thin wafers of chocolate chips since dough can be seen to surround the chips.  Finally, there is some \"aging\" of the dough going on also since there is the deep carmalization that occurs only when the sugars have fully combined with the \"wet\" ingredients. \n\nThe oatmeal with dried apricots and cherries was also delicious.  This is similar to a oatmeal raisin cookie, but so much more decedent with the chunks of apricots.  It's just as massive as the chocolate chip cookie, so there was also a soft, chewy, and crunchy portion of the cookie.  \n\nAt $2.50 per cookie Spruce offers an awesome deal for any cookie monster.

I got to go because a friend had the opportunity to expense the meal and told me to choose a place that I haven't been to and probably would not ever go (as a first choice). And that was pretty much Spruce in a nutshell. \n\nThe service was excellent, although the waitress did correct our pronunciation on a few foodie words like \"Gris\" and  \"Nicoise.\" We went for lunch so I guess it's not a complete dining experience. The crowd was a bit older. I would classify as old money opera crowd. Plus, a few of those couples that you wonder what the circumstances were that brought them together (old man and young woman combo). Not that there's anything wrong with either. \n\nThe environment was very tasteful and chic. The couch (or perhaps the waitress would call it something else, like chaise) was deliciously comfortable. The resturant had a nice white/deep burgandy color choice, pleasant natural lighting all very calming. \n\nFood was pretty good. Although if you are not a diehard foodie, you would be tempted to stop by KFC on your way home.  I had the Nicoise salad and my friend had the gnoochi. We both had pumpkin soup, which, if we were not sitting with the well-dressed opera crowd and Woody Allen couple, we probably would have easily licked the bowls clean. \n\nSpruce is cool.

It was prepared medium rare, which I had never seen before, which was fine by me because it had been brined.  It literally tasted like a steak - and had the consistency of a filet.  \n\nEven better though was the assistant GM, Megan.  She came over to make sure our dinner was going well.  When I told her how amazing I thought the pork was, she told me how to prepare it.  Then, this morning, she emailed me over the recipe, in full detail.  What restaurant does that?

I doubled parked the car on Sacramento St, ran inside and asked the hostess if there were two seats available now!  I smiled widely and exhaled with a rush of relief when she said she had a table in the bar for two!  Really late seating (9:45PM)  Woo hoo!  We had reservations at a Richmond district neighborhood restaurant that night, but didn't work out...so we rushed over to SPRUCE.  Valet parking was ($12) and it was added to the bill instead of forking out the cash right then.\n\nSo, the hostess handed my wife, who was still grouchy, a red long stemmed rose; and walked us to the table.  Now my wife had a little smile now.  She took our coats and handed us a number to retrieve our coats after dinner.\n\nA nicely decorated restaurant, it sets a nice romantic ambiance- rich browns cloth and  dark woods, especially with the candle motif.  The table was covered in white linen tablecloth.  Our napkin fold test passed.  (My wife and my game when either one of us leaves the table with an unfolded napkin; and when the linen napkin is folded by the time we get back, it passes the test).\n\nThe wine list was extensive; and we ended up asking Michael, the sommelier, what he would recommend in the Cabernet sauvignon family.  He was really friendly and new his stuff without being stuffy, overbearing, or stuck up.  We ended up with a half bottle of Robert Kinsky Reserve 2000  ($72) (mainly cab 80%, some merlot 10%, cab franc, etc)-- full bouquet, dark Burgundy color and smooth to the pallet...cherry, cassis, and chocolate flavors.\n\nThe dinner offering was either the Valentine's Day full menu ($125) or a la carte (parts of the full menu, we had three of six dishes).  We ended up going a la carte (about @ $85 total).  I had the garden mixed salad (vinegarette not drowning the greens), fillet Mignon (medium rare and perfectly pink and tender) with a surprise of seared foie gras (not over seared), and passion fruit cake dessert.  My wife had the creamy soup, seared sea bass and the same dessert.  Fantastic all the way around- artistically done and a little larger than a traditional French tasting serving.  The bread had a crunchy crust and airy, light inside and butter creamy.\n\nWe were really happy and I was very thankful that they were able to accommodate the both of us without making reservations that night.  Beside the rose, we got a sweet amuse bouche in a box that matched the taste of our passion fruit dessert.\n\nThe rose lasted about a month in our house before we had to toss it.  Like the beauty and the beast, I got a kiss before the last rose petal fell to the table top; and I was saved from the doghouse.\n\nWe'll be back to this Laurel Heights restaruant.", "author": "JOHN J."}

Modern yet elegant and dare I say cozy. The back lit bar is the image of perfection; it looks like a postcard.  The tables are very spacious but I did not  feel isolated from the person sitting across from me at all, more like I had room for the various dishes, glasses and cutlery. It was also not annoyingly noisy like most dining hot spots and my party was able to enjoy quiet conversation. Although we were dressed up, it was not stuffy and I saw people dressed casually and even two lovely laurel heights \"yoga moms\" with their stroller leaving as we arrived around 8. \n\nTheir menu was one gem after another and I can't wait to go back to try more delicacies (I have my eye on the lobster). I tried the dishes of my dinner party companions (scallops, pork tenderloin and yellow tail) and although each was made to perfection the pork tenderloin with pork belly was the clear winner. I started with the lettuce and herb salad followed by the steak bavette. The steak was so crunchy and charred on the outside it was inexplicable how tender, juicy and red it was on the inside. This is my favorite way steak is prepared and I didn't even have to ask, the chef knew exactly what to do to bring the delicious beefy flavors out of this beautiful cut. The duck fat fried potatoes we presented beautifully and everyone at my table thought they were very crispy and flavorful. The presentation of my dish was so well executed and I really enjoyed when the waiter embellished my plate with the red wine sauce at the table. For dessert we shared the beignets with chocolate sauce (tasted orange-y) and creme anglaise (I was tempted to drink it). I also really wanted to try their coffee because they are their own roaster, but I will have to come back another time. \n\nThe service couldn't have been better. Everyone we came in contact with was polite with out being cloying and also they were very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  I wish I could have had a better look at/sample of the wine and cocktail list, but we had brought a lovely bottle of our own, so I only got to sample a french white from Alsace and their Avation. Both were a great recommendation and my Avation was shaken at the table and poured in front of me. \n\nSpruce is my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco and I hope to return again and again to shape many more happy memories.

Everything was utterly fabulous, but SWEET MOTHER that was a lot of animal fat. In retrospect, the pumpkin soup or beet salad would have been better warm-ups for the orgy of fatty meat that was to come. I also wish they'd had a hot foie gras appetizer option, but the quince jelly that came with the cold foie gras was pretty great, so I can't really complain. \n\nI dug the dark wood and low lighting (although I don't know about those hippie crystal candle-holders), and our server was lovely. The cocktails were great - I had a Kentucky Sidecar and the boyfriend had some kind of eggnog-inspired martini - and we had an excellent Cab Franc that was able to stand up to all that rich food.

Big leather chairs with metal handles attached to their backs. Cool art; my favorites were the two paintings near the bar were made a Japanese artist whose name I can't recall using his feet while swinging from a rope. Neat.\n\nService was generally good, too, although there were a few small missteps. We were seated promptly, even though our entire party hadn't yet arrived -- an unusual yet welcome gesture. Our waiter seemed overly solicitous at times, strangely inattentive at others. No major complaints, though.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered the same entree, the bavette steak, done the same way, medium rare. This disappointed me, as I like to be able to try different things, but hey, people want what they want. I found my meat a little too bloody but definitely tasty. And I was able to substitute the uber-fried fries for the potatoes, yum. The swiss chard underneath the meat was tasty, too. And, going in reverse order, two of us also enjoyed the Caesar salad from the bar menu, and the other person liked their beet salad. No dessert -- too full. My cocktail, a honey elderflower daquiri or some such concoction, was tasty enough, but there wasn't enough of it for the price.\n\nPrices are high, it must be noted, with entrees in the $20 range at least. Is it worth it? I'm not sure -- I'd need to try other dishes to get a better grasp of Spruce's full range. We did like our meals on this first visit, though, and I'd certainly be up for another go 'round (particularly if money is no object, hah).", "author": "Tara M."}

However, I think it takes like 8 weeks to make a decent dinner reservation on Friday/Sat night... so we went for dinner at 10pm on Sat. LoL. So? It was still good. \n\nThe restaurant  is decorated impeccably. Nothing too out of the box creative but very classy, dark, and posh. I think it was an old boxcar garage (?) so talk about spacious. Great bar with a large selection (try the bitter berry cocktail!) . Filled with a clientle whose got bags of money... or credit card debt. I remember it being mostly business casual attire even though it was a Sat. night. Maybe the investment bankers just got off work? Customer service was excellent. Your waiter even places the first serving onto your plate for you. \n\nOk, now for the food. My boyfriend and I had the T-bone steak that had been seasoned for 28 days. That was soooo freakin, mouth-watering fantastic. It came with mushroom, greens, and potatoes sides. Sounds like a plain American meal but Spruce really put their twist on it. We also had the sundae and french donut desserts (ok, they're not called that but that's what it is basically) and that was so-so. Lastly, they have a great cheese list which we didn't try. \n\nThe bill came out to $200ish. Hefty but it was my birthday so I didn't pay!", "author": "Emily F."}

The cod was just OK, the beat salad was very good and i highly recommend it. We shared four deserts and i was not very impressed. Many of the deserts feature VERY contrasting flavors which most of us did not enjoy. The best part of a desert was the blood orange sorbet which was just a side show on a chocolate desert. The sorbet was awesome, the rest was ehh. The place is very nice and \"shmansy\". It is very dimly lit, you can't see anything. The patrons are mostly older, dressed in business attire.

But in my mind, the restaurant looses points if the bread is cold -- as it was at Spruce.\n3) My partner chose the wine pairing. Only one of the wines was good and many of them were either served way before the food arrived (so that the small glass was almost finished by the time it arrived) or too late.\n4) The endive salad was VERY mediocre -- we rated this a 5\n5) The Bosch soup was excellent -- this was probably an 8.5\n6) The Fillet Minion was very tender, but not especially flavorful.

Last Sunday for my friend Shauna's birthday - Spruce reminded me what that was like. I've certainly eaten at 5-Star restaurants in the last few months. But it takes a lot for me to give the deserved review. (Tip to good looking waiters - DON'T HIT ON MY DATE! That costs you a star in my book.) \n\nWe had the front room with the fireplace (it was a private party). Yeah - it kinda felt like we were on display. It's a quiet enough neighborhood that it didn't bother me though (or anyone in our party - I think some people really liked that feeling too). The Sommelier came out and poured our first glass of wine. A light - sweet Gewurztraminer or something. After that I think I had no less than 2 glasses of wine in front of me the entire night. I saw their wine list - very impressive and a well balanced selection. The hosts were incredibly polite and accommodating. Not over bearing at all. The Amuse Bouches came and were perfect for the evening. Shots of butternut squash soup. A little smoked salmon with dill and creme fresh. Fried risotto balls and a shrimp dish. \n\nThe music they had playing was the perfect volume for light conversation - and the selection was surprising pleaseant for a restaurant of this caliber. Normally you'd expect to hear some jazz or other type of stereotypical dinner music. Not at Spruce! (I've heard this mentioned before) I recall The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Keane, Travis and a few others along those lines. PERFECT! \n\nWe were there for a private party - the birthday girl chose a couple prix fixe meals for us. They even made custom menu's for the occasion! A refreshing dinner salad with some fancy cheese (not goat - I hate goat cheese - I woulda remembered that) with beets and candied pecans in a light vinaigrette. I had the steak (cooked medium) with potato's. Everything - perfect. The desert? A trio of sorts. Chocolate, Dulce de leche, and something else (I should have written this review the day after - but the fact that I even remember this much almost a week later has gotta account for something).\n\nThe entire experience probably couldn't have been any better (hence the 5 Stars).

With a one year-old at home it was our first night out in the city in quite some time so there was a lot riding on Spruce to deliver a great experience...and Spruce came up big!\n\nThe service is phenomenal. We ordered three courses but were served five due to some complimentary \"bites\" from the chef before our appetizer and entree courses. It was a very nice touch. The sweet corn ravioli appetizer is worth going for. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. \n\nI had the lobster entree and, while it was delectable, the pseudo-New Englander in me (went to college there) would question the \"pound and a quarter\" size. It seemed to be a little smaller than that but I am used to the Lobster feasts at Cook's Lobster house in Maine. Nonetheless, it came in a bath of butter with delicious gnocchi and some garnish. I would definitely order it again. My wife had the short ribs which were \"fall off the bone\" tender. \n\nPerhaps the best part of Spruce is the atmosphere. It's a cross between Aqua (open, high ceilings) and Boulevard (dark, intimate lighting). Very comfortable and inviting. \n\nWe will definitely go back.", "author": "Dylan S."}

We had dinner on Friday, August 1, 2008 and it was SPECTACULAR!  We started with some shared snacks (charcuterie plate, cheese plate) and martinis.  A perfect start.\n\nI had sweetbreads as a second course which was a good choice, but I wish I'd had the foie gras. Hell, if you're going for the most cholesterol and fat in any one item I think the foie gras would have been a better heartbreaker (aka heart attack)!!  HA!\n\nThe Bavette steak was outstanding, duck-fat potatoes (another absolutely delicious heartbreaker) and a glass of Emeritus and I was done.  All of that didn't stop me from having the Nicaraguan Segovia coffee and some bites off my friend's desserts.  The coffee was amazing and I'm not a coffee snob, but the double cup pot was worth the $6 moreso than any Starbucks would every be.\n\nGo to Spruce.  Don't look at the bill.  Just add 20% and leave.  It's worth it!", "author": "Sean M."}

I heard so many good things about this place and it also has amazing yelp reviews, so I decided to try it out this past Saturday night just for dessert.  I was looking forward to visiting this establishment frequently since it is so close to my house.  I can't judge based on the food, although the honey butter and the bread they accidentally brought us and almost took away was really good. It is really beautiful inside. My review is strictly based on the service I received this evening.  My friend ordered the Beignets which he really liked, but I decided to only get a glass of wine because I was craving a dessert they didn't have.  Michelle was our server.  The first thing that came was my glass for my wine, then the dessert.  Thirty minutes later, I'm still sitting there with my empty glass and no wine.  Dessert has been consumed and I'm ready to go.  I tell her not to bring the wine at this point,  that we are finished and ask for the check.  She clearly forgot and didn't have the decency to apologize for the mistake.   Then she didn't come back with the check for at least another 20 minutes.  I had to walk up to the bartender and ask for it.  It was later in the evening and not at all busy, so can't really blame her lack of service on that.  Last I checked,  drinks are usually served first.  The best part is that she came to refill the water glasses after dropping the check off,  refilled my friends glass and didn't mine. Michelle gives this place a bad name.", "author": "Coraly S."}

The atmosphere is very dark and sleek, yet has a cozy feel to it.  So we get settled in and order some drinkies (for her:  elderflower liqueur and vodka with a splash of lemon and for me:  the Macintosh).\n\nMy friend already had her heart set on the burger and I ended up ordering the Moroccan spiced chicken which was very succulent and tasty.  But when my friend cut her burger in half she discovered it was way too rare and NOT cooked the way she ordered it.  Needless to say, she was quite disappointed and hesitated on sending it back but I told her considering the cash we're dropping on this meal, that burger should be cooked exactly the way she ordered it!\n\nOur server, who was quite knowledgeable and attentive, graciously apologized and took the burger.  Kinda ruins things when you have to send something back but it happens sometimes.  So then our discussion turned to the question of:  (1) would she get a brand new burger or (2) would she just get the same twice-cooked burger?\n\nWell, the answer was behind Door Number 2 because the same cut-in-half burger reappeared and she was famished, so she ate it anyway.  But in hindsight, at an establishment of this caliber she deserved to get a fresh new burger!\n\nSo the overall experience was nice and I would give it 3.8 stars (my friend might give it less) but it didn't totally rock our worlds.  We decided rather than going through the rigamarole of trying to get a res, we would just pop in and sit at the bar for drinks 'n apps next time!", "author": "Michelle E."}

It's in a tony neighborhood that is fun to visit.  We first had cocktails in the front room by the fireplace.  Very elegant.  Then we were ushered past the floor to ceiling wine racks to the back room used for special events.  The service was impeccable.  Timing was superb.  Every instruction was carried out to the T. The food was 5 star qualilty - the celeriac soup was a great starter.  Guests could choose from two entrees (pork and sole, in our case) or a vegetarian dish, such as cauliflower ravioli or gnocchi.  Everyone raved about their dishes.  And the vegetarian dishes came out at the same time as the meat and fish!  (Something many other restaurants can't seem to figure out how to do for larger parties.)\n\nThe wine list reads like an encyclopedia.  The sommelier, Andrew, is very knowledgeable (and was recently written up in Food and Wine).  Andrew was very helpful in the selection process - giving helpful suggestions without totally dissing our dumber ideas.  Donna Nicolletti is the events manager, and she really knows her stuff.  She gave us many great ideas for adding special touches to a party.\n\nA week before the event, my husband and two friends did a \"dry run\" of Spruce to sample the food and some wines.  Donna alerted the staff that we were coming and we were very well taken care of.\n\nI highly recommend Spruce for anyone planning a party for up to 40 people.  Spruce is a class act and knows how to throw a good party with fantastic food and wine.", "author": "Blue L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "I was at Spruce last week for a casual business lunch and was once again reminded of why I love this restaurant.  Could it be the cozy yet stylish d\u00e9cor (I seriously considered asking for a banquette to replace my office chair) or the delicious food that's comforting but vibrant? The reason for the lunch was simple: hamburger and fries to be enjoyed while discussing work; easy enough. The burger was, as usual, perfect.  It came with cheddar and didn't require anything more than a quick swipe of the knife to top it with the delicious remoulade that accompanies it.  I use this on the burger as well as with the fries and both ways are entirely fitting. The sauce is creamy yet pungent and pairs nicely with the crispy fries (I think they use duck fat) and the meaty taste of the burger.  I also cannot get enough of the pickles and pickled onions which I tend to eat by themselves and could make a meal out of if given the opportunity. The Spruce burger is a favorite but I have to give credit to this restaurant for a personal culinary revolution that took place in the winter of 2008.\nWhile I don't remember everything I ate that night (which was an annual holiday dinner with some dear friends) I will always remember that my loathing for caviar was transformed into a love affair and that is nothing if not miraculous (French Laundry couldn't even pull that off).  The beautiful little jewels of salty deliciousness were served with soft butter, potato blinis and brioche toasts which came to the table warm.  The '99 Dom Perignon we brought was opened with a flourish only reserved for such occasions and with that our meal began.  Everyone was \"oohing and aahing\" over the caviar and I had to be talked into taking a bite and did so only hesitantly.  After spreading the toast with butter, I topped it with a dollop of the little pearls.  I cautiously put the end in my mouth and was instantly taken by the taste of the sea which was amplified as the caviar \"burst\" and mingled with the creamy butter and crunchy toast.  My heart sang and my taste buds danced (could this be any more dramatic)!  My husband and friends could tell I was having a near religious experience and let me be and it was then that I opened my eyes and considered myself a fan from that point forward.\nNext I had the butter poached lobster and truth be told I consider anything poached in butter to be utterly sublime (which must have been the case because I'm not typically a fan of lobster by itself).  The dish was fabulous and the gnocchi that came with it were perfection personified.  Light, airy potato-y pillows in a light broth which paired beautifully with chunks of the delicate shellfish.  The cheese course was next on my list and all was right with my world.  \nMy experience with Spruce has always been solid; the service is exemplary yet not uptight.  And even better - it always feels like a celebration; from burgers and pinot at the bar to caviar and champagne with friends in a banquette, I have never once had a bad meal or experience there and have come to realize the only problem is that I don't get there often enough.", "author": "Erin H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-15", "description": "\"After all the hype and long wait to get a reservation I was excited but we ended up being very underwhelmed and mostly disappointed. Very average food with a pretentious presentation that was overpriced and uninspired. Leaving hungry after paying over $500 for dinner is unacceptable. I think the biggest hype is from people who are embarrassed to say they spent $200 per person and were not wowed. From the start the martinis were skimpy at best and robotically shaken at the table by 2 different waitstaff. Yes, the service was good but stiff. The wine by the glass was $25 for an ungenerous 3 to 4 ounce pour for something just OK- mine was an enthusiastically recommended mediocre Pinot from Oregon. There were very few wines by the bottle for under $300. I like a good Chateau Margaux but $1600 for a 1998- seriously? There are plenty of good wines that could have been available on the encyclopedic and unreadable wine menu. The charcuterie selection left us wondering what happened to the meat. I had a minuscule piece of black cod that lacked flavor for $36. Maybe I am spoiled but I expect more from a great seafood city like San Francisco. The duck great was unimaginative and the tiny rib eye steak fell flat. The banana split and the beignets were very good. I say walk across the street to Sociale and get much more creative food in an intimate atmosphere with a wine selection that is realistic.\"", "author": "Michael M."}

That being said, it has still been good and I'd like to return for normal dining but this is a great place to have a work function if you are thinking about one. They cater well to large crowds and have several areas to seat you as well as an area for a cocktail hour. Good location for a closing dinner or celebratory dinner for 15 people or so. They also have rooms that seat up to 40 which is what we've used historically. Slightly older crowd, might be a function of the area it is in but not stuffy. Private menu changes based on the regular menu but we've typically always had a summer harvest vegetable or lettuce and herbs salad. Mains are always a choice of fish and steak, i remember a very nicely prepared halibut. Pre-set menus are always safe because they are meant to please everyone so nothing exciting to report but food was good enough that i'm sure if i were to order of the main menu, i'd be happy.", "author": "sasha h."}

We were greeted by a friendly hostess, a very nice waitress and an attentive sommelier.  Our table was nice, with crisp white linen.  The hostess went so far as to place a card at our table that wished us a happy anniversary... a very nice touch.\n\nWe each ordered a salad, and we ordered the night's special, a 28 oz T-Bone for 2 which had been dry-aged for 28 days.  It came with potato puree, greens, and mushrooms.  We then had 2 desserts, which we ate 1/2 then rotated.  We ordered the Caramel Roasted Apple, and the order of Beignet.\n\nThe bread which arrived was tasty, just a bit crunchy -- and the attentive waitstaff refilled our drinks before it was needed.  The salads were crisp, tasty, if a tad bit over-dressed.  I had a beet salad, which had chunks of beet, some very tasty and fresh greens which I don't know the variety -- and slices of tangerine.  I enjoyed it immensely.  My wife had a caesar salad -- it was really too big to be one salad, unless it was a meal... just be warned you could split this thing.\n\nThe T-Bone was brought to our table for inspection before plating, and it looked immense -- and it looked great!  The waitstaff then arrived with the T-Bone plated and sliced, along with the plates of sides -- 3 staff serving in unison.  A beautiful presentation.  All the food was good; the steak was juicy (despite my wife's insistence on no pink meat) and was tasty with just a bit of black pepper taste on the crust.  I have to say though... I've had better steak, and it was cheaper than this one.  There wasn't anything wrong with the steak.  We both enjoyed it.  But there was nothing really special about it either.  The sides were great, my wife specifically enjoyed the potato puree.\n\nThe desserts were fancy -- well plated, and the pastry chef had scribed  each plate with \"happy anniversary\" which was another very thoughtful touch.  The Beignet was not a New Orleans beignet; but it was very tasty, fresh, light.  I expected a New Orleans beignet but was not disappointed with what I received.\n\nOverall we were very pleased with our choice for our anniversary dinner.  There were 2 marks which kept Spruce from receiving a 5-star rating from me: \n1) The food was good, some was great, but nothing really stood out as being fantastic.  At this level of dining, I do expect to be wowed a bit. \n2) The men's room was dirty.  Now ordinarily I would not return to a restaurant that had a dirty restroom; but it wasn't gross... just not very well attended.  Dining rooms really need to step up their bathroom maintenance overall... and Spruce fits into this category.  I would return to Spruce however... \n\nOne other note; they have an incredible selection of liquors.  Mind you- the prices match the carpet, but it is impressive to see the breadth of the choices.  I was surprised to find my favorite Irish whiskey, my favorite Scotch, and my favorite Bourbon -- I've never seen them all at one place before.  They also have a very large wine list; and a small but good selection of beers.", "author": "Bruce W."}

It tastes nice, but nothing special.  We also had the duck fat fries.  Those were nice too, but were expecting a bit more duck flavor.  Probably with the rave reveiws, I just had a certain taste in my imagination.\n\nMain Course:  We had the Albacore, Duck with Fois Gras and Lobster.  All three dishes we delicious.  The texture of the gnocci was perfect.  The lobster was perfectly cooked.  The sauce on the duck with fois gras was pure \"wow\".

The Beignets were good.  Expected them to be more square shape, but it came as rounds like donut holes.  It came with 2 dipping sauces: Chocolate and Vanilla.  Chocolate was a bit sweet, so I mainly used the vanilla sauce or mix the too.  It came in generous portions too -- total of 8 pieces.  \n\nDecor for the place was very nice.

The appetizers our party had were perfectly cooked scallops, sweetbreads with a poached egg and burratta with fruit which were all outstanding. The celery soup was pedestrian. The main courses were a mixed bag. The pork was cooked perfectly, the dorade and short ribs had great flavor but were over done just a touch. The strange part came with the bavette steak. One came out perfectly cooked, medium rare and was delicious. Another that was supposed to be medium rare was more medium. I guess it's a coin flip. The highlight of our meal was he dessert! We ordered one of everything for the table to share and they did not disappoint. Some that stood out were a chocolate cake with a roasted banana ice cream, an apple tart with salted caramel ice cream, a parsnip cake with white coffee ice cream and an amazing set of beignets. \n\nWhat sets Spruce apart from other restaurants is the level of service. It seemed as if they had a server for each diner in the restaurant. The level of service was prompt without seeming rushed. The only reason Spruce didn't get 5 stars was its drink selections.

Here are some things we found to be \"hidden\" from us, but we noticed it.\n\n4 stars for the maitre d (nothing special, but even though we didn't have a reservation, he sat us at a table instead of the bar, which was nice)\n\n4 stars for the decor and space.  Our table was away from the others and it was busy, but not super noisy busy.\n\n1 star for our waitress.  Greedy Greedy Liar Liar is all I can say.  I forget her name, but her face kind of reminded me of Blake Lively (who I have nothing againt).  She was horrible and all she wanted was for us to keep ordering the higher priced items.  It was VERY annoying since we went in for a casual bite after 8pm with no reservations.  It seemed like half the orders coming out of the kitchen were bugers, but she made my friend feel bad for not ordering anything fancy.  After she left, I asked him why he did that and he said she \"tricked\" him.  So, we immediately called her back to change it back to our original order, and she got annoyed and said she had to tell the kitchen to stop, blah blah, to make my friend feel bad again.  She kept lingering around to have my friend change his mind and then she kept emphasizing how good the Yellowtail was.  We asked how much it was and she said $28 (the bill ended up charging us for $32 and the Yellowtail was not good).  So, after waivering a bit, then my friend agreed to the yellowtail, and she left our table, lickity split.  I am actually shocked at her service compared to Quince- a total 180.  Also, for my burger, she said it comes with options (onions, mushrooms, avacado, etc) but I had to be the one to ask about price and I asked her where the price list was for the extras and she said there wasn't any price list, and they ranged from $1 to $2.  (The avocado ended up costing an extra $4 on the bill).  She pretty much set the tone for our dinner and my friend and I would just complain and talk abour restaurant service.  I didn't want to be at Spruce anymore, but we already drove there and ordered.  What a great dinner topic, right?\n\n1 star for the Mexican (?) bread service guy.  How cheap can Spruce be to tense up for a 50 cent piece of bread??  He had two kinds of bread, a sliced one and a roll one.  We wanted to try both.  He misunderstood me, and gave each of us a roll, and then I asked for the sliced on, and he looked at me in horror until I said he could take the roll back.  Then, he was relieved.\n\n5 stars for the Asian bread service guy.  I was looking over at the Asian guy at the other table and discussing his bread service with my friend, and all of a sudden another Asian noticed us discussing the bread, and they both immediately asked us if we wanted bread.  Talk about 5+ service.  We didn't want any, but that was service.\n\n3 stars for the food.\n   Spruce Burger with Gruyere and Avocado and fries.  The fries were normal but cooked perfectly.  The burger was good with lots of toppings.  $18 isn't too bad.  $14 would have been better if the waitress didn't lie about the avocado pricing\n\n   Yellowtail.  The fish was mediocre.  I don't cook much, but could have cooked a better yellowtail.  The pairing with the pasta and vegetables and garnishes were good.\n\n   Bread.  Unlike the other reviews, our roll was not warm.  It's not a big deal, but I did wonder why the bread guy was so stingy with a roll when it wasn't even a heated roll.\n\n   Coffee.  A little burnt, but I liked it.  We were served the cup a good 5 or 10 minutes before the coffee came.  That was a little weird.\n\n   Beer.  They took an old filled up glass of beer from the fridge, topped it off a little bit to make it look foamy and served it.  That was kind of weird, but it wasn't our beer, so maybe it was free, but it was weird.\n\n   $32 for a double shot drink.  $16 a shot for a small drink and the guys in the bathroom couldn't stop complaining about how costly it was.\n\nUnforuntately, service was so bad, I didn't want to order dessert!", "author": "Cathy U."}

We did get a little abandoned towards the end, but it wasn't offensive. \n\nFood was good - the fresh bread was very tasty, but the \"butter\" they served tasted like a heart healthy \"spread\" - not butter.  The amuse bouche was/were gougres - tasty, but too similar to the bread they had just put on the table. The pate was good, pork was good and the little donuts we ordered for dessert were... good. \n\nThere is a very cool looking indoor/outdoor room that i think is considered a private dining area - looked cozy and inviting.   \n\nId go back... if the boss were paying.

This one has an older, better dressed set of customers, which also goes hand in hand with pretty good service, but the food was nothing special among all the many trendy restaurants in town.\n\nPork tenderloin with pork belly was decent, but largely uninspired compared to Myth's version.  Roast chicken was explicitly promised to be moist by the server, but the breast meat of both servings ordered were dry.  At least we got comp'd for one of them after complaining.\n\nFoie gras two ways was good, but no better than other restaurants' foie offerings.\n\nEntrees were all served at temps less than hot.\n\nAs mentioned by others, prices were high.\n\nWine list was lengthy - we enjoyed two bottles of New Zealand pinot noirs.\n\nSorry, we don't plan to revisit.", "author": "Mason W."}

Our ribeyes were tough, and pretty tasteless on top a blob of swiss chard and 6 duck fat fries that were not crispy just big and grainy.  The lamb was very chewy and lacked flavor. Scallops were ok and that is the point, nothing stood out  as great and imaginative and gave me the fine dining, expensive, wow this is it feeling.

The waiter knew the menu and talked about it well.  The sommelier knew how to handle wines and had the correct glasses.  Now the negatives.  Some of the food was badly done.  A VERY expensive gnocchi with white truffles was amateur hour.  The gnocchi were leaden and gooey.  If you don't know how to make proper ethereal tender gnocchi don't offer them on the menu and certainly not with an expensive ingredient like white alba truffles.  A seared scallop dish was adequate.  No more than that.  Liberty farm duck breast was also just adequate.  Dozens of places in town do it better.  And it was overcooked.  Asked that it be cooked rare.  It came out medium.  And the amount of sauce served with it was pathetically small.  One positive:  when I asked for more sauce they complied.  A chocolate cake dessert was overly fussy and failed to deliver that hit of chocolate flavor that one seeks.  Then a huge service faux pas.  As we were finishing desert, out comes a waiter with an iron and begins ironing the table cloth next to us to get the table ready for the next day!  Huh!  What's next, start up the vacuum cleaners?  Prices are high.  To be honest, it looks as if the burgers and fries on the bar menu better fit the meager talents of the kitchen.", "author": "Jeff K."}

My family and I enjoyed a very special lunch here after my husband and I were married at the Swedenborgian Church.  The neighborhood is one of my favorites and, given the proximity to the church, choosing Spruce for our celebration was a 'no brainer'.  There were 26 of us.  We had champagne and hors d'oeuvres (potato blinis with smoked salmon, harissa prawns with tzatziki, white bean crostini with olive tapenade, and boudin blanc) in the Library and a 3-course lunch (pumpkin soup, choice of chicken waldrof salad or bavette steak, and wedding cake) in the Laurel Room.  Megan was incredibly helpful - and her enthusiasm was contagious - in helping us choose our menu and wines.  Our family traveled from New York and Los Angeles to be here, and everything knocked their socks off.  The service was impeccable, everything was taken care of so beautifully!

We started with the Foie Gras and the Spruce Burger w/ Duck Fries. Foie Gras was cooked two ways. It just melted in your mouth. Spruce Burger was so juicy and came with some pickled vegetables. Wonderful. The boyfriend ordered the Grilled Steak for his entree. He enjoyed it very much as there wasn't a piece left on his plate. I ordered the Duck Confit. The best duck I have had in the city. Love that the skin was crispy with hints of cinnamon. Delicious! We ended the meal with strawberry shortcake. \n\nThe only negative thing I have to say, is that my boyfriend told the hostess and waiter that it was my birthday and to do something special with the dessert.

Attentive service started as soon as we entered, with complementary coat check. We brought in a bottle of Dom Perignon and the wait staff was on hand to get it onto ice immediately.\n\nWe had celebration cake a few hours before coming in and were not too hungry, so we went straight to entrees. I ordered a crispy duck confit with plums and small spring onions, which came out fantastic. Others in the group ordered gnocci (interesting to us because of a recent disastrous failure to make our own), boudin blanc, and a saffron fazzoletti. Everyone was pleased with their order. We also had a complementary tasting of the corn soup with sorrel infusion that was very good. We ended off lunch with the chocolate bread pudding and basil ice cream (ice cream was the highlight)  and a order of the cherry/apricot clafoutis. The house also brought out a complementary double chocolate cookies hot from the oven.\n\nI thought overall the portion sizes were just right, and the service was quite attentive but unobtrusive.\n\nMy only regret was not having a greater alcohol tolerance; if I could, I would have indulged in a house cocktail as well.\n\nI love this place, and every time I have a mediocre meal at another froufrou place, I mentally kick myself for not going back to Spruce!", "author": "Gina C."}

I made a reservation weeks in advanced so I know we weren't stealing anyone's table.  The server asked us twice if we were ready to have our entrees during appetizers.  She tried taking food away but I am fat and I am here to enjoy the dining experience.  I don't think this was a Michelin Star worthy move.  Usually at a \"fine dining\" 4 to 5 dollar sign restaurant they normally serve you the bill after you finish dessert.  The server gave us the bill in the middle of dessert.  Small things like this should be evaluated in the Michelin rating.

Sure, the restaurant's staff is mostly responsible for your experience, but if you ever want to make the leap from just a good meal to a great one...it's going to take more than your credit card and \"impress me\" attitude.\n\nYes, there are plenty of businesses out there that genuinely suck, and no amount of effort on your part will ever fix that.  However, at many places --and certainly at the best places-- it's often your choice as to whether you get a great meal, or just an okay one.  Think of it this way...say you're throwing a couple of dinner parties at your house; one night it's a group of your closest friends, family, and maybe a couple of hot nekkid supermodels with mouths agape.  The next night, it's your bitchy in-laws (and their close family friend Hitler)--a group who you have to serve because you love your schnookie wookie poo, but who will mos def get the shank if they open their gdamn mouths one more time about how they wish you were a Doctor/CEO/Ricardo Montalban etc..  So... which group would you rather serve your orgasmic best?  Okay, it's a pretty bad example, but you get the point.\n\nBack to reality for a moment.... Getting the most out of your night out is a pretty simple thing.  Show a genuine interest in the people who serve you and you might be surprised at the difference.  Sometimes, all it takes is an introduction and a smile.  Feel free to ask questions about the menu, talk to them about what you like and don't like...and when you find something exciting, let them know what you liked about it.  You don't have to make a new BFF, but a good attitude and a genuine interest can open a world of great meals to you.\n\nAnd so it was at Spruce...when I first walked in I thought...uh oh...over-capitalized Williams-Sonoma home that happens to serve food.  See, I'm not saying that I'm immune to false expectations...but I don't judge a place solely by those expectations.  Over the course of that meal...I discovered that beneath all the pomp and circumstance, beneath the formality, beneath all pressure that investors assert in order to make a place profitable...there are people passionate about food and service.  From our servers K and K, to our sommeliers Andrew & Sarah...each had a certain pride about their roles and were more than happy to talk about the food and wine.  I even happened to share a nice convo about the place with our bus person N....when was the last time you knew the name of the person sent solely to take away your plates?  At the end of our meal, Mark came out of the kitchen to ask about our dinner and we had a chance to thank him for the surprises he sent out in addition to discussing our favorite dishes...his passion for the food itself was quite clear.\n\nBut it was on my second visit that Spruce earned its fifth star.  I'd enjoyed the house cured charcuterie plate the first time around, so the second time I dropped in, I ordered it all by itself.  This time though, a gentleman passed by our table and said \"Hi, I'm Peter and I'm the charcuterie guy.  I hope you're enjoying your plate!\"  We talked about what our favorites were, his love for charcuterie, and the fun stuff that he hopes to break out in the coming months.  He was even kind enough to take a break from the busy dinner service and gave me and my dining companion a little tour of his workspace.  Beautiful air cured sausages hanging at the front of the restaurant, rather than just hidden away in some back room...He even gave us a little gift to take home.  That, my friends, is real food passion.\n\nIn the end, it's not about the money, it's not about clout, it's not even about your encyclopedic knowledge of food....it's all about taking a moment to realize that there are real people behind those plates and glasses.", "author": "A J."}

What does a CTM do, exactly?  Fuck if I know, all I know is that I got to travel to Prague, fly on the Concorde, be one of the first people to stay at the new Four Seasons New York when it opened, die of embarrassment as my butler at the Lanesborough in London unpacked my chonies and fly Virgin Atlantic Upper Class enough to know the flight attendants by name.  The best part in the whole wide world??  I got to eat at some of the finest dining establishments in the country.  It was pretty much the dream job of a lifetime. . .but you best believe that if my chairman called me at three a.m. (and he did) and he needed a passport for one of the IPO CFOs by 2pm that very day (he did) I got it done. . .I mean, wouldn't you in order to justify the very existence of your sweet, sweet mostly boondoggle job?  \n\nThe other strange element of my job was that I was, um, hmm, let's see. . how do I put this. . not the corporate type.  Suits?  Um, no thanks.  Sensible pumps worn with pantyhose. .. hell nah.   Stud earrings of sensible size and shape.  Why?  But I did what I had to do in order to fit in.  I never, ever felt like I truly belonged. . .sure I could strong arm any hotel or airline into a contract that saved or rebated us hundreds of thousand of dollars, but I always felt like an impostor. .. like one of my colleagues who really did like lady suits, pantyhose and sensible earrings was going to point at me and make that horrible sound that Donald Sutherland made at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  *shudder*\n\nAnyway, that's exactly how I felt when I walked into Spruce.  It's verrry fancy.  It's a place for Ladies Who Lunch.  It's a place where the air is filled with the smell of satisfaction, a hint of overwhelming wealth and the slightest whiff of botox.   The real me didn't belong here but I had dressed the part.  Hair pulled back in a sleek chignon tied back with a black silk scarf, a sensible skirt, a simple black tunic, and PANTYHOSE!  I didn't feel like me but at least I fit in.  \n\nOf course, the minute I got the menu in my hand, I started to feel like myself again.  I know and love food so I was in my comfort zone once again.   The lunch menu is compact and at first glance I was underwhelmed - they were definitely catering to the area with lots of entree salads and light dishes.  Nonetheless, I was able to cull quite a wonderful meal  - from the insanely delicious french fries to the charcuterie plate to the Pimm's Cup for me and the perfect dirty martini shaken and poured table-side for my seester,  every element made me feel special and happy.  The service is impeccable - everyone here takes great pride in being there and it shows.    If God is in the details then Spruce is a cathedral of perfect service and attention to the smallest element in the food.  I had a simple soup with cabbage, potato, and parsley pistou.  The soup had these tiny, perfectly cut little croutons in it that had been tossed in butter and toasted slowly until they were perfectly crunchy - they retained their texture in the soup and made something so simple extraordinary.  The charcuterie is some of the best I've had this year. . .a year in which everyone and their sous chef is trying their hand at chacuterie, Spruce is actually raising the bar.  The selection is stunning. . a country style pate, a soppresetta, a duck pate, testa, bologna, and the piece de resistance - duck liver mousse served in a tiny crock, glazed with a perfect madeira gelee and a restrained sprinkling of fleur de sel.   That duck liver mousse spread on their toasted bread was the best bite of the year for me.  The rest of the meal is a blur of deliciousness and warm, inviting service.  The wine list is insanity. . it's a BOOK, people, and they aren't kidding around - markup is high - duh.  Coffee service is interesting - they have several different selections of coffee beans which they grind and serve to order.  At first I put off by that. . . it seemed pretentious until I took my first sip. .then I understood.  Desserts are good. . .the clear winner of the popularity contest are the beignets - really extremely wonderful donut holes served with creme anglaise and fruit sauce for dipping. . .sounds simple but they are hot little rounds of deliciousness.\n\nSpruce is hot right now.  It's nearly impossible to get a dinner reservation so I suggest trying it out for lunch - it's a lovely experience whether you're seated in the dining room or take a place at the bar, I have no doubt you will enjoy your experience.\n\nAs we wound down our meal (we had a leisurely almost three hour lunch), I got up to use the restroom and peeked into the kitchen - staff was gathering for family meal and I longed to join them, because in the end, that's where I really, finally, belong.", "author": "Lainie L."}

(AND may I add the B-sauce was a \"haute\" surprise- it was freshly made oozing with flavors of fresh eggs, tarragon and buttah)\n\nMussels were fresh as a daisy- plump, fresh and au jus in classic Mariniere to die for!!\n\nCorn Soup- light , sweet , velvety smooth- perfect end for summer soup!!!\n\nPS- My friend and I were looking for parking and asked a lady getting out of her car where we could park.  She told us to head for the neighborhood behind the restaurant- and she was right!  We were seated to our table- and there she was- our waitress :-) Pleasant from beginning to end!  Thanks for the champagne recommendation too :-)\n\nUPDATE: 10/27/07\n\nTHE DINNER EXPERIENCE\n\nThe menu  choices were superb- ranging from classic salads to foie gras (priced at $10-20 plates).  The main entree plates were as impressive catering to a predominantly meaty palate ($20-30).  My impression from this menu was that it incorporated something so simple and tasty and elevated it to another standard that can only be described as a 'Ratatouille Experience.\"  It seemed that every dish reminded me of an overwhelmingly pleasant and comforting experience and by the sheer taste alone reminded me of time,place and people.  This was my experience at Spruce.  Fasten your seat belt because its going to be a happy ride!\n\nTo start off- I had the charcuterie plate- it arrived with the pleasant and demonstrative explanation of the server- whose job it was to engage me with the different pieces and their accompanying sauce.  It ranged from the obscure (beef tongue- peppery and tangy with a tepanade sauce) to the ubiquitous  rillette du porc (with whole mustard and petit cournichon).  One ofther choice worth mentioning was the chicken terrine and ham which came with a plum sauce reduction.  This starter plate was prepared and put together in a well thought out manner and certainly took me back in a town outside Avignon where  this charcuterie plate,  in its simplest robust  presentation (thick slices without sauces) enamored 8 hungry  students.  It was one of the best 'meals' I have ever experienced- this 'easy' presentation was no exception.  The beet salad- which arrived with fresh , crisp greens and dotted with diced sweet grilled beets.  The dressing was light with simple nuances of olive oil and sherry vinegar.\n\nFor the main course dish- I had the pork loin and pork belly with beans, carrots and chards.  The meat was tender and flavorful basting in the roasting au jus reduction sauce that hightened the sweetness of the accompanying veggies.  The pork belly was splendidly crispy but had a transient oily taste as expected from such a rich dish-- it transported be back to my grandmother's suckling lechon: dark amber crispy skin on the outside with succulent and juicy meat in the inside.  It was  seasoned by simple condiments but endowed with attention and care- this dish, again was no exception.  The other course my  friend ordered was the Duck with Foie Gras.  I have to say given the richness of both these choices- it was just right for this plate.  By cutting out the extra fat, the lean duck lacked the fatty exponent so that the foie gras entirely complimented this entree.  I love this attention to detail and the cook simply used the reduction sauce to lightly pan sear it onto the meat.  This was probably one  of the most enjoyable duck dishes I've tasted in SF without the often rich and heavy taste of meat and sauce.\n\nSo the review was originally for 4 stars- the gain of another 1 star is for the effortless compliment.  Their exceptional service and friendly staff makes this establishment a 5 star quality in itself.  \n\nPS- The hosts were attentive and accomodating. Sommelier was pleasant and informative, busers ensured our table was clean and filled our glasses AND the server who stopped by to say hi and remember my last meal~ simply AMAZING!  Oh speaking of amazing- the beignets were Cafe du Monde quality-except maybe the next time I order it request powdered sugar ;-)", "author": "Arissa C."}

Celebrated a birthday in our group so a trip to Spruce was in order.  It's Presidio Heights so parking is a bit of a challenge during the day but it opened later in the evening.  We got to sit in the Library Room which made for a very romantic and intimate time for our group.  Sweetbread starter and Kurubota pork loin for me.  Dining mates had steak tartare & lamb special; bay scallops & lobster ravioli; and green garlic veloute & the rib eye steak.  The lamb special was amazing, truly better than all the regular menu items.  Our dates, though, had a little bit of an issue with the green garlic veloute and the lobster ravioli.  A little bit on the salty side.  It's presented so well and the wine pairing suggested by our server made it much better though.  Dessert was pretty darn good.  My favorite was the pecan tart and chicory ice cream.  Didn't make it into the main dining room but because of the crowd and the noise they brought with them, I'm glad we got to sit where we were.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-03", "description": "5 stars (5/22/08)\n\n4.5 stars (4/3/08)\n\nMerriam-Webster defines 'spruce' as neat or smart in appearance (when used as an adj). That is just what Spruce delivers, when dining here.  The staff and service were well polished.  The surroundings were decorated impeccably in dark tones, velvet, and ostrich leather.  The meals were presented wonderfully.  How can one not have a good experience here?\n\nOur visit began, arriving early.  We made our way to the bar to wait to be seated.  We perused the extensive wine list and decided on a couple of glasses of sparkling wines to start off.  As soon as we had given our order to our waitress, we were whisked away to our dinner table.  The menu at Spruce was fairly simple, yet eloquent.  It did not take long to decide.  With our orders in, we were presented with complimentary gruyere puffs.  They were a nice start for the presentation that was to unfold.  A nice spring salad was served up next, split onto 2 plates for us, and each served with a green olive crostone.  My gf chose to have the sweet garlic and nettles soup with shrimp.  While the color may fool you into thinking you're drinking wheatgrass, it tasted nothing like that.  It was a nice green, creamy, puree of garlic, nettles, broth, and cream.  It reminded me of a 'clam chowdah' but without the use of clams that I'm used to.  It was very tasty,   \n\nFor my appetizer, I opted to try the charcuterie plate, instead of the hot/cold foie gras.  While I've been game to order foie gras wherever I can, I couldn't have been more pleased with my selection.  The charcuterie plate was a display of love.  Someone took great care in preparing the cured meats, hoping to pass the love on.  It was accepted, wide-eyed, and with open arms.  Plated was a wonderful variety (7 count them!!!) of cured meats to satisfy the palate.  A dish of duck liver mousse, thick sliced garlic sausage (pepperoni/salumi), country pork pate, a slice of duck rillette, slices of pigs ear terrine, thinly sliced coppa, and a slice of pork rillette...rounded out the sampling plate.  Looking at previous reviews, the selection does seem to change frequently, so don't be surprised if you don't get the same.  The standouts were the duck liver mousse and the thinly sliced Coppa, which all went well with the generous helping of crostinis.  Not to mention that our sommelier brought us a  couple of glasses of Riesling to go with the charcuterie.  If the meal had stopped right here, I would've been more than satisfied and full, and Spruce would've earned a solid 5-stars.    \n\nHowever, we pressed on, for our main courses had yet to be sampled.  I had wavered between choosing the Bavette steak and potatoes cooked in duck fat or the braised beef short ribs.  My gf simplified the process by choosing the steak, while I decided on the short ribs.  While both sounded good on the menu, they were a little less than stellar in reality.  My gf's steak came sliced, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  The steak, which seemed to be of the flank variety, was tender and sweet.  The fingerling potatoes were good, but didn't provide the crispness that I had hoped for when cooked in duck fat.  \n\nAs for my short ribs, much to my surprise, there were no ribs involved...only a piece of beef which resembled brisket that had been slow cooked to tenderness.  The beef was tender and somewhat moist, but it lacked depth and flavor.  The piece of beef was lean, so no fat to flavor it.  Nor did it appear that any salts or marinades were utilized, as it tasted plain.  They relied on the sauces to provide the flavor.  It was very much like pot roast, but without the flavor.  After reading the reviews now, I think I should've opted for the pork tenderloin.\n\nAlthough we barely finished half of our entrees before calling it quits, the meal was enjoyable.  I suppose our expectations had been raised a little after the appetizers, as well as hearing Spruce won the best newcomer award from 7x7 Magazine.  The entrees were good, but could stand to use a little tweaking.  At that point, I had decided on rating it 4-stars, but Spruce pulled a rabbit out of the hat at the last minute.  Having deciding on passing up on dessert due to stomach overload, we were presented with a giant chocolate chip cookie as their birthday wish to me...all without the \"happy, happy birthday chant.\"  Classy.  They earned back a +0.5 star.\n\nThe staff at Spruce was very attentive.  From the valets that rushed to open the front door for you, to the pleasant hostesses that knew where to find us when our table was ready, to the knowledgeable sommeliers and wait-staff, everyone at Spruce made our 1st (and not last) visit very enjoyable.  Happy Birthday to me!\n\nUpdate 5/22/08\n\nStopped in to sit at the bar and Meagan, our sommelier from our 1st visit, remembered us and made every effort to get us a good seat, but we were content at the corner of the bar.

Turns out getting a reservation at Spruce s next to impossible . Four weeks in advance and only a 6pm dinner reservation available. We decided to brave the non-sexy dinner time and go for it. And it was  worth it. Almost.\n\nThe interior is modern and elegant  yet cozy for such a big space. Dim in a sexy kind of way - you're not going to need a flashlight to see your food (and yes, I was once at a restaurant where a man pulled out a flashlight to read his menu. A full size one). The cocktail I had was amazing - Gin, Cucumber, Mint - I'm sold. \n\nAnd of course there is the food. Beet Salad - beautifully presented and actually tasty (for beets, that is). I had the celeriac soup, which was amazing. The bavette steak was delicious, but the duck-fat potatoes were maybe more amazing. As my boyfriend said \"How did they get so much flavor into a ...potato?\" I had the pork tenderloin with pork belly - the most amazing pork tenderloin I've ever had. Very moist and I will be unable to replicate that in my kitchen, which will inevitably bug the crap out of me.  The dessert was so-so. The Black Magic Devil's Food cake was not what I expected, so the coffee ice cream that accompanied it definitely stole the show.\n\nThe service the entire time we were there was impeccable. Almost.  Food came at the right time, silverware replaced, plates taken away without me even noticing, napkins folded when I got up from the table (love that!).

Then I remembered that it's been about three weeks since my husband and I got all dressed up, left the kids with a babysitter and went to Spruce for dinner to celebrate our 13th anniversary.  I wish I could eat like this every night.\n\nWe were greeted at the door like they had been waiting for us.  Honestly, it was like being welcomed into a friend's house for dinner.  We let them know in our reservation notes on opentable.com that it was our anniversary, so they had a very nice table for us and a little card waiting.  \n\nAs everyone has written, the room is gorgeous.  I'm anxious to return to Spruce now that I've had plenty of time to digest the room, so that I can focus more closely on the company I'm with next time.  This sexy room turned our anniversary celebration into a menage a trois.\n\nThe food, ahhhh... the food.  We started with soup.  I had the heirloom tomato gazpacho.  I love tomatoes and knew I'd love it, but it still had so much unexpected goodness.  How do you get so many levels of flavor in one bowl?  My husband had the corn and salt cod chowder with dates.  Delish.  For our mains, I had the seabass with tabouleh, tomato and cucumber and some kind of lemon sauce and fresh dill.  It was the perfect summer entree.  He had the steak with the potatoes fried in duck fat and some kind of yummy dollop of fat on top of it all.  (This is why I should have written the review the next day - then I could tell you exactly what that dollop was.)  Next we savored a cheese plate with madeira.  For dessert we ordered the semolina cake served with frozen cream and berries and you never would have guessed that it was our fourth course by how quickly we devoured it.  We couldn't help it - it was so damn good.  We also had some specially chosen coffee (brewed to order!) and tea.\n\nThe service was seamless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-09", "description": "I give Spruce a reluctant three stars, reluctant because three stars is a bit high.  It's not that the food was bad.  It wasn't.  In fact, it had some interesting twists (evocative of Asian influences, the kind of food -- like Vietamese food -- that goes well with champagne and rieslings).  I applaud that inventiveness.  There was an interesting ravioli with spearmint, for example, and the combinations were good (albacore with corn __ and chanterelles).  \n\nBut the food  was heavy.  For example, I bet there was duck fat in the albacore over corn something something with braised chanterelles.  (Read:  the something something was duck fat.)  No hiding the duck fat with the roasted potatos because the menu trumpeted the duck fat element.   And by the time we got to the steak with roasted duck fat potatos, well, I was about dead with fat oversaturation.\n\nThe fat factor is so typical of fine dining experiences these days, but it does not have to be that way.  Sure, I read the Kitchen Confidential articles in the New Yorker, and I'm convinced that not only is duck fat everywhere, but also fat (probably) (okay, more than probably) makes food tastes good.  (In Portland recently at Noble Rot,  I was treated to the horrifying sight of duck fat being scooped out the night before to make duck confit.)  But still.  Consider Bar Crudo (oh-so-inventive, amazing food that tastes like the sea) or transcedent Vietnamese food.  Not  fine dining, you say?  What about Chez Panisse Cafe?  Tastes good and not over fatted.  Same with Gary Danko, though that trends a bit fattier.  Chez Papa does some amazing dishes that are practically light.  \n\nSo it was too much for me, even though -- as I said -- I recognize that the chef was pushing for something more creative and succeeding to some measure.  I bet there's some secret school somewhere, though, that tells them to shovel in duck fat, and I'm telling you, that's a bad school.\n\nOn to the wine list.  Unlike the almost spare menu (a concept I like), the wine list was a book.  It's a Silicon Valley book, or an LA book, not a San Francisco book.  Now, in fairness, apparently some of the listings are two or three bottle holdings, but still.  It was huge.  And hugely expensive.  With what looked like a high markup.  Not a domestic sparkling wine on the list, which I resent because the French champagnes were so high-priced as to be an extravagance.  I thought this already and am not stealing it from yesterday's New York Times, but I drink a lot of champagne, and I don't think it should be a special occasion drink.  It's an affordable everyday pleasure.  Sure, I appreciate the wine guy's point last night, which is that French champagnes are drier, and domestic sparkling wines can be sweeter.  But that's a generalization, and there are increasingly great well-priced domestic sparkling wines that should have been on the list.  (They farm their vegetables and source locally, yet drink only globally?)  Plus I find it ironic that they dismissed domestic sparkling wines as being sweet when (a) I noticed they were pouring domestic Roederer for their French 75's and (b) they serve so many syrupy (yes, syrupy) sweet Rieslings because \"they go so well with the food.\"  I think they could have added a value bottle or four of domestic sparkling wine to the list for those of us who don't want a times three or four markup for an only okay French bottle (with good stuff being astronomically priced).\n\n(We did try an interesting Riesling and a good domestic French-style Syrah with the steak so that part was good.  It looks like they prepare cocktails expertly.)\n\nAs for the space, well, it was interesting.  Some parts are good, some not so.  The dark walls were OK, the over-high ceiling didn't add as much as I would have thought (contrast Foreign Cinema), and the library/host stand were good.   They overlit the art on the side walls, which made the side wall tables too bright.  The stuffed side couches tried too hard to suggest opulent (didn't love the upholstry tacks).  The regular chairs were faux ostrich, and the color was good, but they had odd handles on top.  I bet it makes it easier to move them, but it seemed too calculated.  But these are nit comments, easily remediable or overlooked.  I will say that the faux paintings (not the charcoal but the \"classic\" reproductions) were too much, and I'd change them.  The crystal-like candles were nice:  like flower bouquets.\n\nAs for the crowd, well, the restaurant looks so different than Sacramento street, but given the location, the crowd had that Pac Heights feel.  I saw some social register types there.  There was some slight hipster element, but mostly it was a conventional crowd.  I prefer a funkier vibe.\n\nAm I finished?  The service was great (though the wine guy condescended a bit).   I wouldn't go back.  I did notice a $12 burger.  That and a cocktail or vin rouge?  And fromage.  Maybe.  But you can get that at the Slow Club.", "author": "Laurel B."}

I know for a fact that they contact Yelpers who give them less than stellar reviews and try to influence their reviews.  A manager from Spruce contacted me feigning concern--I took the time and effort to write some candid, specific feedback, and never got a response.  I keep hearing directly from other Yelpers that that their management contacts Yelpers who give less than stellar reviews to try and \"game\" the results.   This kind of lack of  \"professional integrity\" in restaurant reviews leaves me scratching my chin.  Are Spruces ratings and comments \"real\"? I'll let you decide for yourself...  (BTW, while I love red meat, I can't see how any restaurant in San Francisco that claims to be 5 star could not have a single vegetarian entree!!  Needless to say, my vegetarian friend was apalled, and everyone at our table felt bad for him).  Note to Tim S. from Spruce: Please don't contact me again after this update, buddy.\n\n****\nI was really disappointed with my experience at Spruce, especially since I went  there only a couple of weeks after having been to the Ritz Carlton Dining Room.  Spruce is a total wannabe compared to the Ritz.\n\nOur server was horrible.  All style, no substance.  He took our dinner order a full 30 minutes after taking our appetizer order.  He oozed of fakeness and insincerity while talking a big talk about how wonderful everything was.\n\nThe food was pretty good, but I was expecting great--which nothing was.   They forgot one of our dishes until we were ready for dessert, and the dessert took FOREVER to come out.  I understand and appreciate the concept of having a multi-course meal, but the lateness of the food was inexplicable. Definitely not going back.

Spruce has uniqueness all over the place.  \n\nswankiness/uniqueness factor: \n- The bar is spectacular.  if you go straight from the door to your table, you're missing out.  have a drink at the bar.  it's amazing.\n- the art by the bar.  go check it out.  apparently, the artist paints with his feet. very interesting.\n- the art in the dining room.  looks like b/w photographs but i'm 90% certain it's oils.  hint: i think the pic on the left is david beckham.  any other ideas, email me!?\n- the waiting room / cocktail room with the fireplace looks very sophisticated although i usually hang out by the bar. \n- the staff (with the exception of the occasional wait-time) is very well trained on the food and wine. \n\nbad points: \n- i had the steak and duck fat fries and one point and was disappointed.  the steak was a bit tough which seemed unforgivable for a restaurant of this caliber.  and the fries which sounded unique were actually quite ordinary. \n- two times (out of ten) that i've been there, the service has been much slower than i would have liked.  they diddn't come by to ask if the \"food is to your liking\" fast enough after giving you the food - should be a couple minutes, i think.  and getting the bill was a chore twice. \n- everything i've had besides the steak has been awesome. \n\ntips: \n- don't bother with reservations.  come with just a party of 2 and have a seat at one of the tables in the bar.  they are incredibly comfortable and the wait is usually 15 minutes - just enough time to figure out if the art in the dining room are photographs and to figure out if the guy really painted that stuff with his feet.\n- byob.  the corkage is $30 but geez, the wine list is just outta control.  i don't need to pay $100 for a bottle.  i can get a fab wine for 30 + 30 corkage and be very happy.", "author": "dan h."}

For the evening we had the Boudin Blanc which worked really well paired with the saurkraut on the dish.

Overall, the ambiance and the service was exceptional as well. We were dressed quite ghetto not knowing that were were going to eat out that night, but the wait staff was very professional and made us feel at home.

This is the place where all eyes check you up and down upon entry. its quite the scene.\n\nAs for the food-- not exactly the best fine dining in the City, but definitely passable with a few stand out dishes. I loved my sweet shrimp and nettle soup starter. Very rich, satisfying and unique. My lobster entree with gnocchi (most expensive dish at $40) was delicious as well. Again, the food didn't blow me away. I felt like everything was a little over seasoned with butter. This place isn't Quince or Gary Danko's, but more like Myth when it was relevant. I actually prefer Conduit, another new restaurant with a great bar scene, but slightly better food.\n\nOne note of caution, they charge $8 per bottle of water! Insane!", "author": "Mama L."}

Spruce was having a Burgers and Burgundy promo so a few of my friends and I went to go check it out.  This was my second time to Spruce and an even better experience than the first.  First experience was in a private room for a work event and I had the most delicious braised short ribs.  I also had the same server this time, Crystal.  Just like last time, she was so helpful and pleasant and made the whole experience just perfect.\n\nUpon perusing the menu, we all found it difficult to want to order the burger, but since that's what we came for I stuck with the plan.  This burger was definitely just as juicy and tasty as the one at NOPA but yet completely different and hard to compare.  I don't think you can EVER go wrong with a medium-rare burger topped with fois gras, pancetta and gruyere.  I would have gone even more overboard and topped it with chantrelles had they not ran out.  Well technically they had chantrelles for everything on the menu except they \"ran out\" for the burgers..whatevs.  The only thing I could possibly find wrong was that the burger was a little too greasy for me but it's a burger, what do you expect right?  All in all a delicious $30 burger, the most expensive burger I've ever had but well worth every penny.  Also, Mina and I could not decide between a couple different wines so we ordered 2 different ones and had agreed to share, Crystal split the glasses up for us and somehow it seemed like we ended up with four full glasses of wine!\n\nI walked out of that place so full and oh so happy!  I also had a bite of the albacore and pork tenderloin w/ pork belly, also both so delicious!  Of course I will be back to try everything else on that menu!", "author": "Susan P."}

I just made a reservation for a dinner in the private room next month and cannot wait. The decor is phenomenal. They pulled off simple and classy with so many stylish accents. The lighting, the Ostrich skin chairs, the placement of the tables and bars... all perfect. The food was even better. Can't remember the last time I was so impressed with a chicken salad and a hamburger with Blue Cheese. Since I was here for lunch, I HAVE to recommend to anyone who eats meat to get the hamburger with blue cheese. Spruce also has an amazing wine selection.

I had a lobster dish that had no flavor to it.  It was on top of some flavorless gnocci as well.  I guess after eating gnocci at March de Fleurs, this really didn't live up.  Over all, it just felt like they were trying too hard.  At one point, the waitress walked away without pouring the wine for my friend.  And the bread guy doesn't really come around as much as you'd like.  The dessert was fine, but nothing I'd come back for.  It was beignets with a dipping sauce.

Spruce has one of the more elegant atmospheres in town -- dark and romantic but works well for a business lunch or dinner too.  Crowd seems mainly from the neighborhood.  Most patrons dress up but jeans won't get you thrown out. Lunch is more 'ladies who lunch.' VALET PARKING ONLY FOR DINNER  -- which makes lunch there very difficult.

I had been told that they had an amazing burger (it was even compared to Martini House, my favorite) so,that is what I ordered.\nThey also have a pretty interesting cocktail list, so my friend and I decided to start off with a fun drink.\nI can't say I was too surprised, but my drink was tiny! It looked more like a shot, then a martini, but it was good. The waiter was a bit stand-offish. Perhaps it was close to the end of his shift, but he really had no personality? Anyway, we decided to order a bottle of wine and asked to speak to the sommelier. She was helpful and we told her we wanted a big red to go with the burgers. They do have a cool list of 50 wines under $50, so we asked her to pick one. She abliged and we were happy with her pick. \nWhen our burgers arrived, it looked good, but was over cooked. I had ordered  mine medium rare and it was well done. I really did not want to wait and get a new one, so I went ahead and ate it. Perhaps that was the problem, but it had no flavor! I was not impressed at all in the quality or the size. \nWhen the bill came, the waiter informed us that the wine was $56 not under $50 like we had asked. He informed us that we would receive a free dessert to make up for it. Problem was, after a cocktail, a bottle of wine, burger and fries, we really did not want a dessert.  \nBottom line, lunch with tip was $120! Service was not great and neither was the food.

A rep kindly offered to buy me lunch after a large order was made, and I never decline a free meal or drink (which is to say I am available for both if anyone wants to treat a starving post-art student who is still trying to get a hold of this whole adulthood lifestyle). The rep kindly let me know that we had reservations for lunch at Spruce... Spruce? Spruce! Spruce... I've never heard of it, but as mentioned, I do not turn down a free meal. \n\nAs I walk in, I immediately realize that I have been to Spruce a few years ago when it used to be a cluster of retail shops, and at first I was upset that the little antique shop that I bought some kick ass candle sticks no longer existed. That faded as soon as I walked through the doors. Spruce is simply a beautiful space. It's clean, simple, with great lines, and all without being cold. There is a small sun room area for what seems like more private dining, as well as a to-go cafe that serves the same sandwiches and salads served inside the resto, which reminded me of Myth. For all the good design that was in there (the ostrich leather seats were really classy) the bathrooms seemed like a bit of an after thought, but I wasn't too concerned with this. What mattered most was the food. \n\nThe food surly delivered. We had the french fries remoulade, seriously... the best french fires I have had in a long long while. I can only guess that they double fry them in olive oil blessed by the Pope, and then in butter made by the Pope's cow. Next we had a cheese plate which had grayson (AMR), goat(AMR), and a gorgonzola piquant(ITL); with sides of almonds, honey with cardamom, and cranberries. These cheese was... mmm...ugh.... superb... I want a better word, but I can't think of one... oh I know... tastebudnutbusting... a little crass sure, but it gets the point across. Finally I had the crispy duck confit on a water crest salad with caramelized chalets and rhubarb. Awwhwhw... I like duck more than most other adorable things to devour. There was rabbit on the menu, and believe me... I always want to consume the cutest things that used to be alive on the menu, but duck is my go to meat, and this duck was amazing. Perfectly crispy, not greasy, perfect amount of fat. It made me cry a little inside. At this point I kind of stopped paying attention to my surroundings, sorry, and just immersed my self in the pillow of flavors that were enveloping me... oh how I like you Spruce, I hope you like me.\n\nThe best part of this... it was all free! Thank you Dave, your invite for a meal made my day!", "author": "danny e."}

Everyone in our party LOVED our experience here!\n\nEverything worked like clockwork.  Great recommendations from the waitstaff.  On-time seating.  Awesome cocktails.  Sommelier service was outstanding (we brought some nice older (1985) bottles of red from our collection and the sommelier shared with us a taste and her tasting notes which were highly insightful)\n\nOn to the food:  6 people in our party.\nFaves:  Steaks 2 different ways (Bavette on the standard menu and an awesome black truffle garnished Filet Mignon from a nightly special).  Both superb.  The other 4 people in our party all had lobster.  Very positive experience by all lobster eaters although one thought it was only so so.  In hindsight we maybe should have ordered 1 or 2 more different items and mix and match a bit more.  Don't know...just an idea.  The veal special sounded particularly interesting and maybe we'll return at a time when that is featured again and we'll pull the trigger on getting that.\n\nWe split the hamburger 4 ways at the table (thank you yelp for the great heads up here) as a shared appetizer in addition to some outstanding salads (Beet salad in particular was quite good).  Burger was uniquely good although recommend that it get dressed prior to splitting 4 ways (very hard to dress a quarter slice of a burger with the awesome onions and pickles and sauce they provided).\n\nIt was a birthday celebration and we had a surprise order of beignets with dipping sauces.  If you don't know what beignets are think high quality warm donut hole.  Pounce on 'em while they are hot...you'll thank me later.  Makes me long to live close to New Orleans again.  If you are ever there  in \"Nawlins\" check out Cafe Du Mond...the beignet standard. The ones at Spruce are very good.\n\nIntangibles:  Outstanding service, we were not rushed.  Sufficient breaks in between courses.\n\nSetting:  Swanky but not stuffy.  Roomy enough but crowded enough to have good energy.\n\nUpshot:  We will definitely be back.  This is what non-stuffy FINE dining should be.  Well thought out menu.  Great textures and flavors in all dishes.  Carefully chosen and high quality \"sides\" with the main dishes.  We hope to return VERY soon!!  This restaurant nails it on service, food, and atmosphere.  The only minor negative was they forgot to bring us an extra order of beignets.  I did not see the bill so was unsure if we were charged for it or not.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended.\n\nPS:  The specialized coffee menu was quite interesting although we did not partake.", "author": "Sharks F."}

The place looks amazing, dark chocolate brown colors for the floors and the walls and a grand entrance. We were taken to our table where they had put a card that said \"Happy 30th anniversary from everyone at Spruce\" on the table - a great touch that we all appreciated. We had Kelly as our waiter and he was wonderful, but the staff in general is pretty great, we loved Charles too. My water glass was never empty, something that is so often missing in restaurants. I had the seared foie gras (comes with the duck as a main, but they said I could do it as a starter - yay!) which was delicious! Then I had the butter poached lobster with gnocchi and braised greens. Okay, this was amazing. The one comment I would make is that the gnocchi weren't hot enough. Not a big deal, it was FAB. Then for dessert, the chocolate caramel fondant YUM and the semolina cake with blackberries and frozen strauss family cream squares, okay that could have been served hotter and I would have been happier, but it was still delicious. My parents also had the lobster but my mom started with the corn and salt cod chowder which was fantastic, my dad had the sweetbreads....I didn't try them :) My sister had the watermelon and rucola salad to start which was gorgeous and then the albacore tuna. She loved it all. The presentation at this restaurant is wonderful, they really take the time to make everything look great.\nLook, they have just opened, they are teething as my dad likes to say. There are a couple kinks that need to get worked out, but I have no doubt they will.\nOh, and they have an extremely extensive wine list, the only problem you will have is choosing which of the thousands of options to choose!\nI will definitely be back, even if it's just for a burger (they looked so DELISH) and a caesar (which everyone was ordering...they must know something I don't!) in the bar.", "author": "Shelley M."}

The food was incredible, and the wine list was amazing.  Even better, the sommelier (a woman at that, I love it) was really knowledgeable and helped us pick some amazing wines to go with our meal.  I am a dedicated red wine drinker, but she assured me that this Gewurztraminer  would be perfect.  Not only do I hate wine, but I hate sweet wine.  Well, let me tell you - I let her convince me, and I am so glad I did!  Sooo yummy!  She may have turned me, if not into a white wine convert, at least someone who can enjoy it every once in a while. \nHowever, I have to say, its REALLY noisy in there.  Try to get a table in the corner - there is an alcove with two tables sort of back from the main dining room - you still get to people watch all the action, but you are removed enough to have an intimate dinner.

From the black walls, the prominent wine cases, and the ostrich stretch leather chairs. I dare call the amazing man that waited us a waiter- but more like a personal guide into Spruce's culinary delights. The sommelier is genius. I can't say enough wonderful things about him, his choices of wines were as inviting as his personality. Every choice was a perfect pairing. The charcuterie plate had interested meshes, but dazzled my tongue and made me believe in bologna again! The only issue I had was the duck. This might be because I was spoiled in Beijing and I like my duck skin to be crispy. Aside from the chewy skin- the meat was cook well, tasted great. Pumpkin is a must there while in season, the (pumpkin) soup and (pumpkin) dessert was my highlight. Afterward, we met the charcutier, who turned out to be the fromager as well. I didn't get to go through all the cheeses. Nothing delights me more than a place that sneaks French raw cheeses into the country (i am not going to name names!) and I was hoping Spruce did the same. The cheeses we got to sample were delish- love Neal's Yard and the wine we had to wash it down was divine! \nHipster foodies, don't be shy to go there!

It's New York cool while still managing to make you feel instantly comfortable.  We often go to Spruce without reservations and eat at the bar (a strategy that works better earlier in the evening than it does later, as the bar is quite crowded by 8:00).  \n\nWe had dinner in the dining room on Friday, and it did not disappoint.  The fois gras appetizer was excellent and went well with our Henriot champagne. I had the butternut squash soup that was topped with a puree that took it from good to spectacular. (Yes, I know that it's hard to make soup \"spectacular\", but I stand by my description).  I had the pork terderloin for an entree and it was so good that I urged Georgi to try a bite before she had started on her own.  \n\nSpruce's wine list is extensive covering the extremes of both price and quality.  We decided to go middle of the road and had the Red Car Trolly Pinot which went great with our entrees.\n\nGeorgi: I love dark restaurants.  There is something so cozy and sexy about a dimly lit restaurant that it makes me feel like doing something naughty.  If sex could manifest itself into a restaurant that restaurant would be Spruce.   I love the foie gras, the sweetbreads, the short ribs, the burger with duck fat fries and most recenlty my favorite would have to be David's pork on Friday night.  I had the Kona Kanpachi which was not fantastic.  But in all fairness the waiter's description of it was very accurate.  In other words I think I received fair warning of what I was getting.  The mistake was more on my end in that I tried to go with something I would not usually pick.  If I had picked the short ribs or the Butter Poached Lobster (which I was leaning toward) I would not have been disappointed.  The wine was fantastic and the Sommelier was charming and very knowledgeable.  We go to Spruce a lot and have no intention on changing that.

First, the good stuff--there's no denying that Spruce is one of the most beautifully designed restaurants on the west coast.  You step inside, and you're in a place unlike anything in SF, where most places want go for the \"sure, we'll serve you a 5-course meal for $500, but we don't want you to think you're somewhere fancy\" vibe.  Spruce is a restaurant for adults--young, rich adults, for better or for worse--and feels more like something you'd find in New York or Chicago.  Got to give them credit for doing something different there with great results.  Another plus is the pricing--Spruce is one of those places where my wife and I have had a few nice meals with good bottles of wine, and every time the check has come, I've been pleasantly surprised with the damage.  You can't say that about many places in SF.  The food is exactly what you'd expect--inventive California cuisuine prepared well.  The wine list is somewhere between medium-sized and an encyclopedia, and has good options at all price points.\n\nAs far as the drawbacks, I've never thought the service was that great--initially, when Spruce opened and was booked for months in advance, there was a bit of an attitude like you were lucky to be there.  (And frankly, I suppose I was, having gotten tables before they opened)  I think that's gone away, thankfully, but many of their peers are better in that department.

Restaurant has a nice cozy and modern ambiance with dark wood and candlelit tables. It was a wet rainy night when we arrived and we gave our coats to the coat check hostess. When I asked for a coat check ticket, she replied it wasn't necessary. While waiting for our table, my husband ordered a cocktail at the bar and asked that the drink be added to our meal tab. We were seated and ordered. \n\nFood was wonderful. We shared a scallop appetizer and beet & pear salad, which came separately plated. For our entrees, we ordered the poached salmon with gnocchi and the bass with crab. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake, and the (recommended) beignets. The food was delicious and the service was fine--until we were leaving the restaurant. \n\nDownhill from here for me: Our waitress chased us out by lobby/coatcheck area telling us bartender told her that the $12 cocktail never made it onto our food tab (and was awkwardly trying to ask us to settle that tab).  Though it wasn't our fault, it was embarrassing when my husband had to pull out his wallet again (in the crowded restaurant lobby) so she could run back to the bar to get us change. We spent quite a bit of money there already and after a nice dinner, we were not impressed with the service/treatment as we were leaving . \n\nThe unattended coat check area, nothing but a mere closet (with 2 doors that opened outwards), was also very poorly managed. Though I had asked earlier, we were told a coat check ticket wasn't necessary. With no hostess in sight, we attempt to find our coats in the sea of black coats. A hostess suddenly appears and tells us that she can help us--but is of no help. Because we have no coat check ticket/number, she asks us which table we sat at --which doesn't help in the least.

And, well, the service is better than many places, but it still has not reached the \"great\" service level yet. So what makes a restaurant receive high rankings? Can't just be the decor and the service, right? I'd have to think the food would play a part, wouldn't you? \nI started out with an endive and pear salad topped with pistachios--liked the pears, but didn't think much of the endive or the dressing. Endive has never tasted so bitter! Maybe it was the dressing?\nI had the grilled bavette steak, cooked medium rare. They did a good job on this dish, as they flavored it with bordelaise sauce. I liked the light sweetness the sauce brought to the dish. I'm glad I ordered this dish as opposed to the roasted halibut my two friends ordered--which I tried a bit of. I love fish, but I always fear restaurants overcooking it, as this had. Once a fish is overcooked, the succulence of it is lost. All we had to say about it was, \"tastes like chicken.\"\nOk, perhaps I shouldn't be so critical--it's only my first time there. Shall I give it another chance? Well, they had dessert to redeem themselves. Can somebody really go wrong with dessert? Well...\nChocolate and caramel fondant, which was good for chocolate lovers.

We went to Spruce with friends of ours for dinner and from the beginning of our dinning our server totally ignored us and didnt come over for like 15mins.  It seemed lack of staff that night.  We felt that they needed more workers.  Packed but yet only a few servers.  All of us didn't come to a nice restaurant to be treated we weren't that important you know.  When we ordered our food, I asked a question about how they prepared the dish and his attitude was very rude and he acted like it was annoying that I didnt know what it was.  He was like 'Im sorry I dont understand what you are asking'. So I asked him again how it was prepared and he told me he didnt know what I was asking about and treated me like I didnt understand English on the menu.  Very an unpleasant situation. I was very shocked and unhappy the way he treated me and then my husband got into the situation and asked him what's going on and he started explaining what he tried to say and how it got prepared and on and on.  Very rude and unsual to see that kind of service in a nice restaurant as Spruce.  It started off and ruined our night with our friends who we haven't seen for a long time.  I wasn't happy about it as well as Spruce and would I go back?  Well I don't want to get ruined my night again.  Probably not because there are so many better and nicer restaurants in San Francisco.  Why would I go back after treated like that?  I didn't even want to pay the waiter any tip but you know that was not nice to do. Anyway that's how bad it was.

Anyway, back to Spruce, the service is very good and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, albeit with some interesting art selections. The downfall of the meal came early on, the amuse bouche was sort of bland and I can't even remember exactly what it was to be honest, I think it was some puffy bread with a fishy taste, but it was free, so no harm no foul in my book. The appetizers is where Spruce lost me a bit, our salad was too bitter and I couldn't taste any flavors outside of, well, bitter. We had two other appetizers, the scallops, which were OK, but nothing special and again had a bitter sauce which I tried to avoid, but the other was a squash stuffed ravioli which was quite good... the pasta was clearly homemade.The entrees were great and a huge step-up from the appetizers. We had the pork tenderloin and the arctic char and I am not sure which I enjoyed more, but both were outstanding. Dessert was also great, and our waiter brought us an additional dessert (on him) that was a chocolate decadence. The wine list is very good and the after dinner cocktail selection is beyond formidable, especially their single malt scotches.  Overall, Spruce is a good place and I'd look at this 3 star rating more like a 3.95. If they just fixed up the acidity levels in their opening courses this would easily be a 4.5 start place.

After waiting for about 20 min, the hostess came up and said \n\n\"So i know this may seem weird, but it can tough to get cabs out here, especially with Bay to Breakers in town, so I just gave the valet my car keys and he will drive you back to your hotel.\"\n\nI have never in my life, had someone do something like that.  It was amazing.  Prior to this I was going to give it 5 stars just for the food and the service (which was amazing) but with this, it put me over the top.  Everyone should eat here.

Wifey and i did a little bit of trading - her menu selection was a bit  healthier - celeriac (type of celery) soup, seared petrale sole, and hazelnut chocolate mousse & ice cream.  the sole was definitely a highlight.  also a few extrras from the kitchen to top it off.\n\nservice was good.  everybody was friendly and seemed unassuming.  our server had answers to all our legitimate and stupid questions.  she had good suggestions, and even put up with my request (facetious) to take the candleholder home. the piece looked like Superman's Fortress of Solitude - apparently it's like $400.  only thing she did wrong was to pour the first glass of wine with an unopened bottle, but it was amusing.  \n\nwe were full, and got out for under $200 plus tip.  not sure if i'll go back, but maybe schedule a b-day party here sometime.", "author": "Jimmy F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-19", "description": "Before I start the actual review, I think that I should qualify the weight of the opinions of party I was with when we ate at Spruce. I worked for over 10 years in the restaurant industry in both the front and the back of the house, from cafes and bistros to full service fine dining. I went to Spruce at lunch on a Friday with my brother and his fiance, both graduates of Hyde Park, NY's CIA. My brother has also spent many years in restaurants and currently is a wine buyer for a large, upscale market in Seattle. His fiance grew up on her family winery and her father was also a fishmonger and a CIA grad. \nNow, my bro and his girl flew down here for two days just to eat. They basically ate 5 times a day. By the time we went at 1:30, they had already had Bob's Donuts and Swan Oyster Depot. (After lunch we had Bi Rite ice cream... they still had dinner and post dinner snacks to go.)\nOK... enough already... here it is in a nutshell: Food pretty good, service pretty bad. Here's the run down:\nSo, our initial impression is, hey, nice looking joint. Very dark and sophisticated. Lots of leather, brown velvet, beautiful bar, but was still comfortable. Kudos to the designer... but that doesn't make good food or good service. We were optimistic at first: the staff was very attentive when we arrived, nearly to a fault. When you hand someone a wine and liquor list that is over SIXTY FIVE PAGES LONG, you should give them more than a minute or two to think about what they might want to drink. Then, if the customer is undecided, give them more than another minute to figure it out. I'm really not exaggerating here. SO, I order a glass of Moscato d'Asti because I'm driving, and my bro and his girl order a split of a Riesling and the \"Grand Selection\" of charcuterie. When we get the wine, we order our entrees, at which point my brother tells the server that they would like to hold onto the wine list so that they can order another bottle. After that, we see no one at all until a busser drops off some catsup and mustard for my burger (I heard that it was very good here.) We start to think that maybe they forgot the charcuterie... we were right. Our entrees were delivered and then we were truly on our own. Not a single soul came to check on us until we were nearly finished when the busser came to fill our almost empty water glasses. Our server eventually returned to see if we wanted dessert, but we just couldn't bring ourselves to get $7.00 cups of coffee and $9.00 beignets after all that mess. We politely declined, paid our bill, and left. I left a generous tip, but I wish that I hadn't. I was just too lazy to break a $20.\nWhen all was said and done, the restaurant missed out on $18 for the charcuterie, $35 on another split of wine, and another $35 or $40 on coffee and dessert. Gee... that's another $100, easily, and all they had to do was have ANYONE walk over to our table to see how we were. Now, it WAS late on a Friday lunch, so maybe everyone was doing their shift work to get out of there, but that's no excuse.\nOh and the food? Well, my burger was decent.... the meat was ground too coarse and the french fries were so over salted that I could feel my blood pressure rising. If you want a good restaurant burger like this one, go to Zuni Cafe instead. My bro had the steak and his fiancee had duck confit... they enjoyed the food enough, I guess, but they weren't raving about it. \nFor a restaurant as overpriced as this one, I would expect stellar service. I've had better service at Denny's. Reading the other reviews, I can see that others have had poor service, but there are also people who thought that the service was excellent. Still, for these prices, it should be good 100% of the time. Period.", "author": "Zoe K."}

My husband had the artichoke/vegetable soup and lobster.  The soup was on the greasy and salty side.  Presentation was not appealing for a high-end restaurant.  The lobster was tasty though.  \n\nService was excellent after the waiter knew that he was responsible for our table.  The matre d' sat us down with the menus but we were not greeted by our waiter or at least offered water for at least 10 minutes or so.  After seeing tables around us were served and we were \"ignored,\" we waved to the matre d' to request some service and water, the waiter prompty came and apologized saying that he did not know our table was his.  Anyway after this, the service was great.\n\nThe dessert menu was quite limited though.  As a concluding remark, the manager actually came to our table and talked to us about our dining experience.  Then the waiter took the soup off our check due to our comment and gave us two giant chocolate chip cookies to take home.  This was unexpected and a nice surprise on his part.\n\nWe will probably go back as there is no restaurant of this caliber on this side of town (Presidio Heights).", "author": "Lily L."}

I took some clients there last night and had such fun.  The company was great, but it was highlighted by great service, good food and fun surroundings.  The stand out for me was our waiter--we had a 7 o clock reservation and were never rushed (i saw people waiting for our table when we left, but would never have known that was the case.)  Our waiter encouraged us to enjoy our dining experience by letting us a taste a couple of different wines by the glass, bringing us a side of mashed potatoes when we told him how great they were and suggesting a delicious dessert that had a fancy name, but were really just warm sugar donut holes--DELICIOUS.  My sole was really good, with Dungeness crab and buttery spinach underneath.\nIt is so rare in restaurants like Spruce to NOT feel rushed so we all really appreciated it.  Having been the one treating for 4 people, it seemed pricy, but its a write off so hey--I will hope to go back again soon", "author": "Honey N."}

From the moment you walk in, you're greeted at the door, you take in the warm atmosphere and the beautiful art, and you're thinking, this is going to be a good night.\nLast night we celebrated our 2-year wedding anniversary. Our generous and considerate friends had called ahead and purchased a bottle of fabulous champagne on our behalf which really kicked off the evening. We were tempted by most items on the menu so we decided to share. Our server was really great as he offered to have it split up into a 4-course meal, also splitting glasses of wine to go with each item so that we could perfectly match wine to our food (since our choices were a bit all over the map) without getting too toasted, it being a Tuesday night.\nWe started off with a little amuse bouche, a gruyere gougere. We enjoyed the sweetbreads, a salad that was a special starter which consisted of burrata, three types of basil and assorted heirloom tomatoes, the poached lobster and the steak. All were absolutely fantastic, seriously. My husband was sopping up the lobster sauce with his bread. The wines paired perfectly, with a white burgundy to go with the lobster, and a really fantastic cabernet franc to pair with the steak.\nWe were too full to order dessert (and it was nearly 11pm on a Thursday night, as we were leisurely wrapping up our champagne bottle to finish off the night!), but they brought out some little treats that were that perfect ending of sweet.\nFor the prices you're really getting a lot of bang for the buck - entrees range from I think $26-36 but you're getting Fleur de Lys, Gary Danko kind of service and quality, so we saw it as a huge value. Plus, although the wine list is over the top extensive - it's like a Bacar kind of book - they've got lists of wine under $50, which we thought was pretty great.\nThey have a pretty enticing bar area with a bar menu featuring burgers, Caesars, etc., so we're eager to come by just for a casual bite and a glass of wine some night.\nWe'll be back, and I highly recommend it! With the Pac Heights clientelle, this is a perfect spot for your boss, your parents, etc. Definitely not a place you want to go out with a loud group and get crazy - I think we were the youngest people in there and with the tables relatively close together (think Aqua) you want to keep things muted and reserved.

We were elegantly casual as if we wear nice clothes all the time and just happened to stop in. We started at the bar for cocktails. I got the Brittle Berry Bramble which lloke exciting and pink and girly but was quite manly and strong. She got the elderflower liquer and vodka. They were both excellent drinks and we love being fancy together. While we were seated I noticed the crowd had changed a bit from the bar. There were very rich looking people at the bar well dressed in 100 dollar hoodies and 200 dollar jeans with 500 dollar sunglasses perched on their 250 dollar haircuts. They were all daintily eating the hamburger.  But inside the restaurant the ladies were in dresses and the gentlemen in very similar style to myself well fitting khakis, navyblue suit jackets, and  pastel button ups. Our waiters were very nice and offered a nice cheap wine selection for our budget. The European Cheese Platter and the English Pea Ravioli were our appetizers. They were both very delightful and now I am going to attempt to make pea ravioli in my own kitchen. Our main course was very tasty, succulent, desirable, orgasmic, blah blah blah. I had the Sole and she had the lobster. The achieved the right amount of tenderness and chewiness and crispiness ratio. I also enjoyed my wine (its was 10 dollars a glass but I have no clue what it was but pear-y and light)  We then got the dessert with the bananas simply because we did not know what \"milk jam\" was but found that it was a fancy banana cream pie. I liked it. I also got a cup of 7 dollar tea because \"I have never had a cup of 7 dollar tea before and wanted to know what 7 dollar tea tasted like.\" and my date agreed. The earl grey, and orange roobios were delivered to our table. They both were quite good and now I know what a 7 dollar cup of tea tastes like.  Good. Well anyway with our check came these chewy passion fruit melt in your mouth delights and these cherry something or others that were not very flavorful. I was hoping I wasnt allergic to passion fruit like I thought I might be but could not remember the exact fruits that harmed me. I found out that passion fruit is one of the fruits I am allergic to (along with guava and papaya) because as soon as i got home i developed a rash  and tingly lips.

With 5 people we had quite the assortment of dishes from the menu which were lobster, chicken, the burger, halbut and pork tenderloin. Everyone loved their dish! I had the halibut and it literally melted in my mouth. And to end our meal, we had the beignets which we were craving through the rest of the weekend!\nHere's where they diappoint. At their calibur, I expected them to hit the high notes when it comes to customer service, especially considering reviews from others, and this is where they actually fell flat entirely. As mentioned, we were celebrating a special occasion that I noted in my Open Table reservation and with the hostess 2 times upon arrival. First, our table was not ready for half hour and they did nothing to comp for our time. At least get our first round of drinks for us!

The uncomfortable seats were exacerbated by the extremely slow service - think an hour between courses.  Several people left early, unable to sit for so long on hard chairs. It was especially uncomfortable for taller people.  Although in a private room in the back, it was not quiet due to loud, unsuitable music.  Conversation was only possible with a person sitting next to you and for people with normal hearing. \nIt was only at the end that we learned how to control the volume, and there was not possible to change the style of music.

The lobser was kind of small fingerlings of lobster in a butter sauce with just a few tasteless gnocchi (This is not Quince!) . My dining partner had the sweatbreads which where excellant and next time if I go if someone else is paying, I will have the salad and sweat breads. Desert was supposed to be a Creme brulee cake, it was about the size of 3 dice and a tiny scoop of what was supposed to be blackbery ice cream it was hard to tase the blackberries.  Personaly if you are going to spend this kind of money I would go to a lot of other different places, Gary Danko, Quince, La Fringale etc.  I'll go again but only if the person paying insists. I hear thier hamburger is terrific..maybe I should order that.", "author": "rassors T."}

The foie gras appetizer, the charcuterie tour de force, and the sweetbreads.  I sit at home and watch bourdain and others go on and on about the joys of offal, and i'd yet to take the plunge.  When I read the description of the sweetbreads offered at Spruce, I thought, now's the time.  I can't stop thinking about it... it was truly an inspired dish.  i am so glad I tried it.  It's an earthy, deep, and harmonious flavor/ texture combination... a slight crisp seared quality in the meat plays well with the tagliatelle and the mushrooms.  It is the type of plate that you wipe clean with bread.  The only thing that I can say as a criticism is that the first course out-shined the main course.  I tried 3 of the entrees at the table... the lobster, tuna (i had that), and the special veal t-bone.  though good, none of them seemed to sing quite like the sweetbreads.  overall our meal at Spruce was a great one... pricey but worth experiencing.  thanks also to Megan for sending over salads and cookies.", "author": "ari b."}

Pieces of lobster looked torn apart and the gnocchi was very heavy and dense.  I wasn't impressed at all. The pork was however good and the pork belly probably the best part of the meal, it was done very nicely.

Look at how many different ways it is served. That goes for a lot of the dishes. I think it adds a lot to the dish when it is placed in front if you.

Had a cocktail at the bar and have to say that the bar was very impressive, very well stocked, intriguing cocktails yet all the staples.  \n\nLunch was moderately priced and delicious.  Beet salad (quite on the small side in comparison to the other salads), Steak, the burger,  and duck confit, and braised shortribs were our choices, shared between three people.  All were very tasty though the sauce on the steak was a bit too tart.  To be honest, while pricing seems appropriate, we did order up and with no regrets in the end as one salad and an entree to share as starters was a perfect addition to an entree each.\n\nWine list was very expansive and reasonably priced as well.  Service was timely and somewhat friendly though our server could have been more personable and attentive.  There were a few times when it was a challenge to get someone's attention either for a condiment, more water, or the check... my only real gripe.  \n\nThe crowd was definitely older, mostly 50's+, which was too bad.  I'd love to come back more often, but maybe sans the snobby baby boomers.

If only I could save room to sample a portion of the delectible dessert menu.\n\nWhat ruins this experience is that you walk into the open air entry and expect a magical evening. The first impression is a fantasy - charcuterie room to your left. Library to your right. Just enough backlighting to show your date your best features. Exquisite cuisine right through the doors.\n\nIt's unfortunate that as soon as you enter this wonderland of culinary ecstasy, the first thing you notice is the cheap catalog furniture juxtapoxed with the fine detail of new-york style restaurant. Did the owners run out of money? Are they so inexperienced they did not know how to budget for furnishings? What about the lucious brown walls, the soaring ceiling, and seeimingly translucent glass curtain between the bar and dining area? Don't these spaces deserve seating of the same caliber? This inattention to this detail is reemphasized once you walk into the restrooms only to have the home depot faucets staring back at you.\n\nThank god for the food. I guess this is the reason you eat out, yes? If you close your eyes and savor the cuisine paired with the correct wine that our sommelier always seemed to have his pulse on, you can almost forget that you're sitting in the same chair my admin assistant has in the dining nook of her 3-room apartment.\n\nI think 3 visits have been enough to see this succulent menu through.

We enjoyed our last meal of 2007 there and it could very well have been our best, most memorable meal of the year. The NYE prix fix menu was wonderfully delicious...and combined with the wine pairings, wonderfully pricey. Hand picked baby greens from Marin, filet with foie gras (and ox tail trimmings), seabass adorned by succulent pieces of lobster, mmm, mmm and mmm. Everything seemed fresh, delicate and perfectly prepared. The service, too, was quite lovely. Aside from forgeting one of our wine pairings (which I reminded them of..;) ), the service was A+. Even the directions to the ladies room was accompanied by a \"welcome\" hand gesture that you'd expect only at the entrance of a royal palace. Oh...and the decor. The decor and overall ambiance was cool and comfortable. Everything from the fedora wearing men, cherry wood beams, high ceiling , big a**wine cellar and modern art make Spruce quite a scene. I'd definitely like to return to Spruce. Maybe a special occasion or another time when a little splurging is in need. Not sure what the regular menu looks like but a very nice dinner for two on NYE set us (ok, not me) a good chunk of moolah. To more fine dining in 2008!", "author": "Deann M."}

The location in Laurel Heights is charmingly quiet at night and soothingly cool on this often foggy hilltop.  They offer quite a few small tables beside the bar which are surprisingly semi private and good for conversation.  I wasn't able to make a reservation and felt lucky to be shown to one of these bar tables very quickly.  Spruce is definitely a \"reservations recommended\" place so visit opentable.com or call ahead if you can.  They have a fairly long bar where I'll surely come to dine solo some night again soon.  The staff here was all wonderfully accommodating, all seemed to be experienced hires so they know how to treat their patrons well even though this is a new establishment.  I ate a wonderful cut of halibut for my main course which had a perfectly complimentary sauce with yummy mushrooms and amazing flavor balance.  This is a great place to relax and converse with a friend over an amazing choice of American foods prepared with California flair.", "author": "P H I L H."}

For the hype Yelp has given Spruce and the price point per entree...we had high expectations.   Unfortunately...it was not  all that. It seems that Spruce is still working out the \"rough edges\" of being new. I will say the food was delicious. We ordered the poached halibut which was good...but a bit bland. My favorite was the ahi tuna...incredibly delicious. My issues were more with the lack of \"flow\" with staff.  We had too many staff members coming up to us at different times of the night. The WORST by far was the Sommelier who wanted to complain to us about the his 24/7 job and being deprived of enjoying SF's sunshine days. He did not help us choose a nice bottle of wine...infact we had to tell him what we wanted. Our waiter was attentive and  made a great effort attending to our needs and providing pleasant recommendations. The three of us that had dinner  last night are foodies, have frequented many fine dining establishments in San Francisco and feel that Spruce is not up to par. Overall staff seems out of flow, hurried and not very knowledgable at all. Spruce needs to work on changing some of their staff and creating a better flow in general.

I came for our anniversary and must have mentioned it on the phone a month ago because there was a happy anniversary card at our table when we sat down from the Spruce gang which I thought was a nice touch. We started with the red endive, pear, and blue cheese salad which was very good along with the date, salt cod chowder. Then moved onto the lobster and also steak bavette entrees. The lobster was gorgeous looking on the plate, It was very colorful looking as well as flavorful. I'm not too sure about the lettuce in there though, it reminded me of something in a wonton soup from Chinatown. The steak with the duck butter I think, was very good. Our server, Charity, was excellent. She opened our bottle of wine effortlessly, was very helpful in suggesting some courses to try, and was a really friendly person. She added to the greatness of our meal there. For dessert, we shared the white chocolate creme dish which came very well presented and we polished it off. I think for someone who wants to go out for a night, dress up, see and be seen by lots of hip SF elite, this is the place to go. As for just the food, it was alright. There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't anything special to the taste buds. Kind of how I felt about Gary Danko. But go try it for yourself.", "author": "Vivian L."}

The crowd is in their late 30's and upwards. The decore is modern and lofty. There is valet parking for dinner and then street parking for lunch. They boast great cheeses, great wines and filling desserts. The atmosphere is quiet enough to talk and the bar scene is not really a pick-up spot.

We went as a group of 6 for lunch. First off i was dissapointed with the service, i dont think it was the servers fault per say.. but rather the managers, or lack there of as i never saw one. The server was obviously new and needed some guidance or a little more server training. Service was slow and and clumsy. In a restaurant that is fine dining, spends tons of money on building a restaurant i expected higher quality service. Now for the food: since we were a large group we got to try quite a bit of the menu. For starters we had the Charcuterie plate, a mache salad with beets and also the frites. All were very good. For entrees we had the duck, the albacore, the mussels, the  lamb and the sausage dish (cant remember the name of it exactly). the duck way, i mean way too salty!! ans the lentils it was served with didnt have any seasoning. Very dissapointing. The mussels were good, the lamb tasty but the creamy polenta, was without a doubt runny and more like soup. The albacore supposed to be seared rare, came with two pieces and one of them not cooked at all maybe just dropped in the pan for a second and put on the plate. The other piece was overcooked. Not impressed and had to send back for further cooking of the raw piece. Our favorite dish was the sausage, great flavor. Overall the experience was uneventful other than good company.

The hyped up french fries appetizer arrived lukewarm, my panini sandwich was not grilled together as one as other panini sandwiches I've had.  The waiter described it as a Tuscan Chicken panini, it was totally not what I expected.  It was a mayo chicken filling (maybe 1/2 cup of filling), no lettuce--just a chicken salad sandwich on a roll that was grilled with butter on inside of the roll.  The outside of the bread was not grilled at all and the sandwich was really a cold sandwich.  The accompanying house made chips were ok, but cold-- some that were so cold/sitting around that the crunch was not there.  Too expensive for what  was served.

Started with cocktails at the bar, which were excellent.  The bar, however, is a madhouse.  I felt like I was jockeying for position at a Who concert or something.  Must have heard \"excuse me\" about 300 times in less than 30 mins from the hordes trying to muscle in to get a drink.  A little annoying, but also a reflection of my advancing years and intolerance.\n\nWhen we were seated - which was right on time - we were both very impressed with the dining room.  Very cool, open space.  The waiter was a very affable guy, but a little too much so.  The kind of super friendly guy that makes you sincerely doubt his sincerity.  In any event, I was on the fence between two appetizers and two main courses and asked his advice.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, he sent me in the wrong direction on both, and did so without hesitiation or equivocation.  When I asked him his opinion between two dishes, he blurted out his advice so quickly and with such confidence that I felt I would be a complete moron to not heed it.  The first recommendation he made was a potato and leek soup that, quite frankly, was unbelievably bland.  I mean, flat out flavorless in a way that no amount of salting can cure.  There really weren't any potatoes to speak of in the soup, which made it really just a leek broth.  My wife and I both felt we could make something tastier at home with a can of Campbell's.  When our waiter asked what I thought of the soup, I told him it was really bland with hardly any potatoes.  He just said, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that, I'll let the chef know.\"  Yeah, right.  Didn't ask me if I'd like something else, and certainly didn't take it off the check.  I left at least half of it in the bowl.  Whatever.  My main course was the duck, which was a bit undercooked, but not bad.  It was pretty tasty, but the foie gras on top was the best part.  My wife was happy with both of her dishes, and the wine they recommended was fantastic and went perfectly with everything.\n\nOverall, I'd say there's tons of potential here, but they still need to work out a few kinks.", "author": "Mike L."}

This is the kind of place that strikes a balance of being a guy place, a chick place and a date place. My boyfriend and I were originally waitlisted for the main room but, upon turning up (on a Saturday night!) magically whisked into the lounge to a nice two-topper in the back and then lucked out again with a larger table after having friends come meet us post-dinner. The meal was good. I'd assign it words like 'fresh' and 'inventive' , but that's like everywhere in SF, so count the 5 stars more for the overall experience, charm and service. I'd had a glazed duck roasted with raddichio and quince and topped with a very buttery foie gras. Need a red wine with those clogged arteries, right? So I did get a pinot, but then the straight-talkin sommelier hooked me up with this amazing spritzy, peach-infused ale and I was even more charmed by the place.

We had 8 o'clock resos and arrived at about 7:45.  We quickly found a parking spot on the street and skipped the $10 valet.  Upon arrival, we stepped up to the entrance, and to the right was this cute, sexy, lounge fully equipped with fireplace, cozy leather lounge chairs and beautiful candles.  It was already occupied by one couple, so we opted to check it out after dinner.  We were greeted by the host staff with a smile and they showed us to the bar lounge which was cozy and inviting.  We opted to start with champagne.  It was quickly delivered and we were shown to our table promptly at 8pm.  We were greeted by our server Ena (sp?) who was nice and always quick and effecient.  She told us about the special- Prime filet mignon, oxtail and golden potatoes with swiss chard. Mmmm.  If you are going to a restaurant like this, you are already going to spend money, however I still don't like when they don't mention the price.  We started with the caviar selection, very tasty, but the presentation was boring.  A heap of caviar, and two quenelles, one sour cream, the other butter?  Another thing that bothered me, was that not one person described any of the food that was set down in front of us..grrrr! ;(  We then decided to share an order of the scallops, which they split for us..nice touch.  They were delicious and seared perfectly, paired with cauliflower.  Next we shared the lobster entree.  Served with potato gnocci, it was cooked perfectly.  On to the entrees..  My hubby went for the berkshire pork tenderloin with the crispy pork belly.  OMG!!!  The best damn thing you could put in your mouth..TRY IT!!  I had the special..It was great, but nothing really stood out to be different than anywhere else serving filet.  Dessert..We shared the hazelnut cake with coffee ice cream, and the roasted caramel apple with vanilla ice cream. That was topped off with a medeira sabayon..mmm mmm good.  The hazelnut cake was by far the best..seems light like tiramisu, but richer and tastier, with the espresso ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-07", "description": "This four-star review is an average of five stars and three stars, based on a recent Friday evening dinner visit: \nFive stars for the gorgeous decor and ambiance, the excellent service, and the delicious food. It's always a treat to visit a real, grownup, \"adult\" restaurant, as opposed to the SPQRs and Delfinas and other noisy, cramped little boites. \nThree stars for not being able to honour an 8:00 reservation until 8:40. The host staff was extremely apologetic and provided us with snacks in the lounge until the table was ready, but it seems to me a restaurant of this calibre should be able to manage their reservations better. And, although our dinner was delicious, I was rather disappointed with some of the menu choices. There was a nice selection of mains, but I would have like more varied salad and dessert offerings. \nNevertheless, I'll be back. I'd like to just go in sometime for a burger at the bar and see how that goes.", "author": "Tom R."}

Every time I've been here (3) I've been impressed and left happy.  The first two times my husband and I went we sat at the bar and ordered burgers.  Delicious!  This time, my dad was in town, and we debated long and hard where to take him for his first night in town.  Spruce was an excellent choice, and will be my usual go to place for a multiple course meal that is sure to impress.  We had a more formal evening in the dining room and all of our expectations were exceeded.  We had the mussels and foie gras to start (the foie gras is the best I've had in town - although 5th floor comes in at a close second).  The mussels were delicious too.  My husband had the steak which he liked and my dad and I had the lobster with gnocchi.  It was perfect.  The service is really outstanding and their wine list is impressive.  Try to the banana bread dessert, it's awesome.  We will definitely be back as this place is a San Francisco favorite.", "author": "Courtney W."}

It was a fantastic experience with great service (very similar to Aqua) mainly due to our very friendly server.  The foie gras, seared and preserved, was the high point of my meal.  The only reason I'm giving a four star review is that our entrees were over salted.  I had the rabbit three ways; bacon wrapped tenderloin, a small rack, and a confit leg and thigh.  My wife had an off menu 1lb veal porterhouse.  When it came to the table my first thought was I had ordered the wrong dish for my self.  Luckily it was way too big for her to finish.

First off the staff/service was completely off. I had to ask for water and than when they finally poured me a glass, they spilled the whole tray on my dress, jacket, and bag. I was left freezing cold for the remainder of the 3 hour meal without any consolation besides a measley, \"would you like us to dry-clean your jacket?\".  The sweet corn ravioli was served cold, very unappetizing, the scallops were better but nothing special. The shortribs were dry and boring and the apricot crisp dessert was unflavorful and had a gummy texture.

Spruce is a five star restaurant, from the valet and hostess to the waiter and bus boy, I had a flawless dinner that showed me the staff here care about the bigger picture of serving really great food really well. There are few restaurants in San Francisco of this caliber, clearly its amongst the elite with their extremely extensive wine list and phenomenal entrees, its just that good. I start with the cheese plate, a taste of European Cheese is excellent. With a cheese plate you really dont need an appetizer so go ahead and order your main course and save yourself some money on another course you simply dont need.. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and my fiance ordered the Lobster, we shared both and it was just an unforgettable culanary experience. Everything was cooked to perfection and our attentive staff simply made for a perfect evening. We topped our meal off with the espresso cake which was delicious and left perfectly satisfied.

We headed there on a Monday, after work, and the place was packed. The hostess informed us that we would be first on the waiting list for bar tables (more like comfy, bar booths), there were 4 tables, 2 were finishing. As we ordered wine (there's an excellent selection & great bartender rec's) an obvious employee on her day off came in with a friend. What proceeded was for me a first- as we saw a table vacate, the hostess seated her coworker friend at the table rather than us. Now, I'm all for giving service industry perks, it's a small consolation for being generally overworked and underpaid, but I don't need this obvious favoritism  thrown in my face after being told \"the next table is yours.\" Normally I would have said something, but we were relaxing from the wine and could tell the hostesses knew what they had done and especially that we had noticed. \n\nAfter finally being seated at the next table which came available we had an excellent meal. Great people watching, very comfortable and stylish decor and (aside from hostess snafu) great service. I'm even tempted to give it 5 stars overall, but with this caliber of restaurant, at this price point (and from the Village Pub restaurant group) I would not have expected this negative hostess experience.

Our reservations were for 5:15 on a Saturday night and the place was pretty quiet but quickly filled up by 6:30. It is very, very dark inside! So much so that I had to squint to read the extensive wine \"book\" in the lounge. The decor, although dark, is very luxurious and makes you feel like you're somewhere special. The main dining room, luckily, had some lighting up above so I was able to read the menu and see my food while I ate. I tried the tomato soup with burrata, and I guess I expected more, since so many reviewers raved about it. I found it too tangy for my taste, but that's just me. I preferred my friend's pumpkin soup which was sweet, so maybe I like sweet soups. The beet salad was also delish as were the day boat scallop appetizers. For entree, I ordered the arctic char served with leeks and onions(?). It was prepared nicely, but nothing special in my book. The monkfish was meaty but also nice. My favorite was the rabbit served three ways - very flavorful. Hubby  ordered the pork tenderloin which was great, but it  was seasoned with all-spice, which none of us were crazy about. Overall, it was an elegant dining experience. Our server, Alvin, was helpful about making recommendations and attentive to our needs.

Our table of 8 waited one half hour for bread which was finally brought after we asked for it.  After looking at the menu, which had poor choices for a lunch selection, we ordered.  Two of us ordered the special which the waiter raved about.  The extolled special entree was a joke.  It was the size of a credit card if not smaller and lost on a huge white plate.  It reminded me of the Emperor and His New Clothes children's story where everyone is told something is great but in reality it is a sham. When those and the other orders were brought after a good forty minute wait, and the restaurant was not busy, the fish entree was stone cold.  It was sent back and eventually returned luke-warm.  The lunch was a huge disappointment.  I  know I will never go back and my 7 friends never will either.  That makes 8 people telling all their friends what a unsatisfactory lunch experience we had.

Both times the bar service was just mediocre. The last time while waiting for dinner my friend wasn't sure what she wanted to drink. She asked the bartender for suggestions and he gave her a look like she was speaking in tongues. She gave him license to be creative and asked for something sweet - he mixed her a lemon drop, and didn't sugar the glass. This did not equate to \"something sweet\", in fact it was the opposite. At a restaurant like Spruce, with a price list like Spruce serves, the bartenders should be old-school professionals who know what they're doing - and that includes being able to offer suggestions and helping a customer discover something new if that's the experience they want to have. Being professional also includes keeping the discussion about how you hope people hurry up so you can go home to a minimum, or maybe don't have that discussion at all where the customers you are supposed to be serving can hear you. Maybe it was just a bad night, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt because it's a lovely place. Just know what you want to drink before you get there.", "author": "Kate M."}

It was probably the best move. The bartender's (Evans & Scott) were entertaining, informative and helpful. They really made the evening fun. Only complaint is, it's a pain in the you know what to get in those chairs and pull them up so your not eating a foot away from the table. We had the pumpkin soup and Endive salad for starters. Buttered Maine lobster, golden potato gnocchi with braised lettuces and Charred Berkshire pork tenderloin, crispy pork belly with shelling beans for mains. For dessert, the Piedmont (hazelnut chocolate mousse, manjari ice cream). The lobster was nice and they remove it from the shell so it's easy to eat, but if I get to go back I'm having the pork tenderloin. It was tender and charred just right. So full of flavor. The mousse was rich but a nice serving so you weren't regretting it later.", "author": "Suzanne S."}

They had left him a birthday card on the table (a very nice touch) before we arrived. The wine selection is amazing they bottles from $100 all the way to $20,000/bottle!! It's a wine lovers haven. The staff is very attentive and thinks about every little detail to make your dining experience a wonderful one. The decor is very romantic with dim lights and brown walls. The food is fantastic. We had the foie gras (preserved and seared) and sweetbreads for appetizers and they were both amazing but the foie gras was too tiny. I had the duck confit with foie gras and as entree and my husband had the lobster, they were both delicious. The lobster was very light and refreshing and the duck was rich and complex. The foie gras on top of the duck was bigger than the one I got as an appetizer. Our wine was excellent also.For desert I had the beignets and my husband had the chocolate cake w/ hazelnut ice cream. The beignets were so soft and warm and perfect w/ the sauce, I was in heaven. His cake was good too but I like the beignets better. I would go back to Spruce but it has to be a special occasion because it's a very expensive restaurant we coughed up $350 for dinner that night but it was worth it.", "author": "mojgan v."}

This restaurant lacks the attention to detail necessary for ultimate success.  I think water should be served with ice.   And when it takes 10 minutes to get your water glass refilled, especially after calling it to the attention of the waiter, that's unacceptable.  Ditto for parsing out the bread one hard-to-get slice at a time.  When I finished my main course, the dirty dish stayed in front of me for 15 minutes.  And through it all, the waiter was officious.  Food was okay or better (the Caesar salad was completely mundane; the short ribs were tasty but a bit dry) but at these prices the food should be inspired.  Like many reading this review, I dine at upscale establishments all over the country.  The menu and wine list prices here are stunningly high, likely among the highest in San Francisco.  C'mon, Gordon Ramsay doesn't own the place.  Bottom line:  if this restaurant is going to play in the big leagues (as its prices indicate it intends to do) it really needs to get the whole package right.  Period.", "author": "Rick D."}

Went on a Tuesday night and put our name on a waitlist for a party of 4.  We were never sat in the dining room so we ate at the bar.   I noticed throughout the evening, 5 empty tables, and 4 had a window view!  I was told by the hostess that they were short on staff and that room was for private dining...what?  Our waitress was doing double time running between the bar, cocktailing, and the dining room.  That's why she forgot to order our appetizer, which ended up coming out with our dinners.   As we were drinking our wine, the waitress asked if we wanted coffee, we said no, so she brought the check.  We were going to have another glass, instead, we went to another place.  I will take friends there again, as long as I get a table, and the usual service that follows-not a waiter who just wants us to eat it and beat it.  Eating at the bar was a wasted experience.", "author": "Joe K."}
