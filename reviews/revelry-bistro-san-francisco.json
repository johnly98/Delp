Revelry Bistro delivered everything I needed and hoped for which leads me to say if you're looking for a great place for brunch with a large group of friends (or even a small group), Revelry should be high on your list.  \n\nThe round table reserved for my party of six was perfect: not too close to the front or the back, out of any draft, and both cosy and warm.  It provided the intimacy needed for a good session of catching up.\n\nOur server offered drinks (Bellinis, Mimosas, and Bubbles) with no pressure to order and even once our whole party was seated, there was no urgency to move us along.  Can I tell you how much we appreciated this?  Excellent service is always welcome.  \n\nOur food, when we finally did order, hit the spot perfectly.  We had begun with fabulous a la carte biscuits, raved over by all, then moved onto a Bananas Foster French Toast to be shared by the 6 of us.  As entrees, we sampled Eggs Benedict (Classic Benedict,  Salmon Benedict), Croque Monsieur, and Duck Confit Salad.  Brunch dishes average about $15 apiece and all were tasty and satisfying.\n\nRevelry's owner worked for many years at Bistro Central Parc, and just like there, a quality product is delivered.  If we as a group had a single niggle with the menu it was only that it featured no omelets, focusing almost exclusively on Benedicts as the eggy brunch fare.  Still, we weren't complaining.  The food was good. \n\nRevelry Bistro is located in Hayes Valley, close to the uber-popular restaurants lining Hayes Street, but far enough from those that you would have to know of it to run across it.  Now that you do, you should make brunch plans.\n\nAt the risk of arriving next holiday season only to find the place packed and turning tables at a fast clip, I offer up this recommendation.  It's a very sweet place, with delicious food and a relaxed - dare I say European - attitude that's easy to enjoy.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Next we had mimosas which were perfectly balanced with fresh orange juice and crisp champagne. For my meal I modified the beet salad to include goat cheese and a poached egg. Something in the dish tasted like truffle though I'm not sure what. There was a healthy portion of beets, delicious pistachios and tender gem lettuce. \n\nI expect a vegan would struggle with the menu but can definitely modify to discover a delightful, delicious meal.

So pleased that I promised my husband that I would take him there on our next trip into the City.  At that first visit, our group of 4 ladies seriously enjoyed everything we ordered.  So, as promised, I made reservations for hubby and I to dine there before a music event close by at SF Jazz Center.  \n\nWe had a very pleasant greeting by the restaurant staff and were seated right away.  We sat upstairs at a long farm table, sort of reminiscent of a country French restaurant.  Service was quick, and after letting our server know that we had limited time, service was even that much more efficient.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of French Burgogne (aka Pinot Noir) at $45.00 a bottle.  That was the first disappointment.  Not a great choice for the wine list, sour cherries and absolutely tart with no taste of fruit at all.  Tasted nothing like the bargain Burgogne wines I had throughout France.  Next came the salmon terrine.  This was a nice presentation of a good size piece of terrine.  Definitely enough for 3 people as an appetizer.  It came with pickled onions and capers and toast points.  \n\nI ordered the Saut\u00e9ed Striped Bass, which came with some roasted veggies and a very light and mild sauce.  Most of the fish was cooked through, except one corner was completely raw and I couldn't eat all of it plus the skin was not crispy at all.  Kind of soggy skin. The real disaster of the evening was the so called \"Coq au Vin\".  Now most everyone knows this is a very classic French stew, that consists of chicken well seasoned and marinated overnight in red wine, then saut\u00e9ed for a nice crust and then stewed with mushrooms and pearl onions.  I have made this dish several times over the years and if prepared correctly is simply divine.  What was served to my husband and our other dining companion was a tragedy!  Very bland stewed chicken, slightly overcooked, served on a bed of linguini noodles that had something like chicken broth on the bottom of the bowl.  The chicken was so bland and it was almost like it was steamed.  The skin was rubbery as well.  This entr\u00e9e was not Coq au Vin!!!  It was really a horribly prepared entr\u00e9e.  \n\nI can only assume that something was way off in the kitchen.  Maybe the head chef had the night off?   So for $183 with tip for 3 people, this was such a disappointing meal and experience.  And so embarrassing for me after I had just raved about this cute bistro.  I will not embarrass myself again.  That's it, I won't be back.", "author": "Barbara S."}

First and foremost, as it appears to be a hot topic... I ordered the Coq Au Vin, and thought it was delicious. The only thing left on my plate was a bone or two. It is a fairly simple dish, but quite flavorful!\n\nWe started with baked brie and salad. The baked brie appetizer was so fantastic. It comes with roasted garlic which pretty much melts onto the crostini. Just delectable! \n\nThe only hiccup of the night occurred with the delivery of my salad. I was curious about the \"apple gastrique\" on the Endive Salad, and our server (who is slightly reminiscent of chef Robert Irvine) gave a description that ultimately led to me ordering this dish. \n\nWhen the food runner arrived with the Duck Confit salad, I let him know that this was not what I ordered. Moments later our server came over, with the sent-back salad and menu in hand. He handed me the menu, and pointed to the salad section, \"remember when we talked about the apple gastrique...\" He was actually trying to show me that I was wrong, with the plate in hand!  Fortunately, the menu did not lie, and he quickly realized and fixed his mistake. The salad was great, but I have literally never had a server bring a over menu and the incorrect plate to try to prove that I am wrong. Unreal.\n\nWhile the rest of the group enjoyed some fine wines, I was pleased to discover a delicious IPA on tap from 101 North Brewing. It was fantastic! \n\nLastly, I just wanted to give a shoutout to a member of the team named Chris. While he was not our primary server, he was extremely helpful and professional and added to our memorable experience. We'll definitely be back!", "author": "Alex E."}

It came with side salad, potatoes, and Dungeness crab meat, but overall I found it to be just ok, not very memorable in my opinion. Maybe we should have gotten the Banana Foster French Toast or some other plates to share but we were too full to do so.

Tried making a reservation through OpenTable and Yelp but they were completely booked for Friday night on April 21. So I privately messaged the establishment and within an half an hour, owner Brad responded and helped us secure a reservation for 8! Woo hoo! \n\nAt first glance, I mistaken Revelry for a tiny corner coffee shop but after we entered, we were led to the back room with this beautifully set-up table spaciously fit for our party of 8. Vibe was very welcoming and friendly. Decor was pretty with the lights semi dimmed and real fresh flowers as their center piece. Pretty romantic and cute !\n\nOur waitress was Silvana and from the get go, she had on friendly smile. She gave us plenty of time to settle in as the rest of our party arrived then she explained to us the specials. \n\nSMALL BITES:\n- Escargots ($12): six pieces of escargots in shells stuffed with parsley, garlic, and oil. (3/5)\n\nSPECIALS: \n- Scallop Sashimi ($16.50): scallops were pretty fresh topped with cucumbers and black tobiko. This dish impressed the bf and I. Definitely didn't expect the taste. (4.5/5)\n- Alaskan Halibut Ceviche ($16): small portioned for the price. The Ceviche consisted of cubed-sized halibut, avocados, onions, tomato, cilantro, etc. Paired with some chips. It was pretty average... (3/5)\n\nFROM THE OVEN: \n- Bone Marrow ($14): one of my most favorite dishes of the night! The marrow was hot with drippings. Texture was fatty and literally disintegrated in my mouth! Spread on these crispy bread chips with the complementary tomato jam was delicious!! Definitely a must get (4.5/5)\n\nENTREES:\n- King Salmon ($28): New Zealand king salmon on top of wasabi mash potatoes with some asparagus. Salmon was cooked perfectly: soft, moist, and juicy on the inside and crusty on the outside. Paired with the wasabi mash was VERY appetizing... the mash was simply something I've never tried before! very unique in taste. Asparagus were a bit too mush and I couldn't bite them apart. (4.5/5).\n- Mushroom Risotto ($24): well.... this entree was a bit disappointing. The shiitake and oyster mushrooms were super tasty and flavorful but the risotto was like a glob of tasteless mushy rice. (3/5)\n- Filet Mignon ($34): majority of everyone in our table got this. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare as requested. Paired with these potatoes and green beans gave a healthy finishing touch. Some even added the Seared Fois Gras for an additional $25 (4/5) \n\nOur overall experience was very pleasurable and satisfying. Service was very attentive. Silvana checked in with us frequently and came to us in a timely matter such as when we finished our bottle of wine or for water refills. She was nice and polite as was the other staff. I loved how they cleared our table often and gave us new utensils!! The staff were also very spirited and cheerful when they brought in our cake to sing happy birthday to my friend. There was a cakecage fee of $24 ($3pp). \n\nIn total, our bill was ~$736 for 8 people with 20% gratuity. Bout $92 pp. We all left stuffed, satisfied, and still complimenting about the food!!

I was racking my brain trying to remember where I know him from. And, then a light bulb went off: OH, HIM. \n\nSorry to disappoint you but it's not a walk of shame story...\n\nYears ago, we had gone on a first date at a very casual chain restaurant and when the bill came (counter service), he just stood there and didn't even offer to pay for his half. \n\nMind you, it was at was at Fuddruckers. What are we - 12?! At the time, we were both in our mid-20s and employed. Then, he was texting throughout dinner. \n\nNo surprise, we never spoke to each again. \n\nNow, if the date was at Revelry Bistro, then it would make for a juicy walk of shame story (Hi, dad....just kidding!). \n\nIf you're looking to really impress a date, then look no further than Revelry Bistro. It's a charming French Bistro that's warm and cozy but casual enough so you don't look like you're trying too hard (to get laid).  \n\nJerome who runs the FOH is an absolute charmer and can totally be your wingman...because that French accent. You may remember him from Bistro Central Parc and he never forgets a face. It's been years since I've seen him and he welcomed my friend and I with open arms. \n\nFor dinner, they have a standing menu with fresh oysters, crudos, cheese boards, charcuterie, and salads. Their entr\u00e9e menu changes daily but if you've been to Bistro Central Parc, then you know that the Tournedos Rossini: Filet Mignon topped w/ seared foie gras is the dish to order. They have it here too! Beer and wine only. \n\n(Please excuse the bad food pics, it was dark.)\n\nWe started with Roasted Bone Marrow ($14): http://bit.ly/2oJlCmo which was rich, unctuous, and sinfully delicious. You can rarely go wrong with beef butter and there was no shortage of marrow in the bones. The accompanying tomato jam added just the right amount of acidity to balance the richness. \n\nFor one of our shared mains, we ordered the Slow Roasted Porchetta w/ brown butter flageolet beans, broccolini, arugula pesto ($28): http://bit.ly/2py1eom. The porchetta's skin was perfectly crispy with a good crackling crunch. The meat in the center was really dry though. The flageolet beans were hearty and comforting, and reminded me of a cassoulet.\n\nThe Filet Mignon w/ seared foie gras, black truffle butter, haricot vert, roasted marble potatoes, port reduction ($59): http://bit.ly/2okkWml didn't disappoint one bit. The filet mignon was cooked medium rare as requested. The crown of foie gras added a luxurious richness to the tender filet mignon. The black truffle butter and port reduction provided a good balance of rich earthiness and tang. Both the marble potatoes and haricot verts were perfectly cooked and had a good bite to them. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Cr\u00e8me Brulee ($9): http://bit.ly/2pdUxec and the Profiteroles w/ vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, almonds ($9): http://bit.ly/2ok4kv8 which were a bit underwhelming. The cr\u00e8me brulee wasn't fully set in the middle (runny) and the ice cream in the profiteroles was icy. \n\nService was friendly and polite, and our server made a great beer recommendation (Scrimshaw Plisner). Food service was leisurely but without long lags. Tiny gripe, my water glass was left empty for a while and several people had passed by without noticing. \n\nRevelry Bistro is a great date place and they have one large table in the back for a large party (~10 people). Weather permitting, they also have outdoor seating so you can dine with your furbaby. \n\nParking is easy (no meters) if you have earlier dinner reservations, otherwise, allot 10-15 minutes to look for parking. There's no nearby parking lots. \n\nCan't wait to return to Revelry Bistro with my date...the four legged one that doesn't talk back and likes to sniff butts.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We got a drink.\n\nTable still not ready at time of reservation. GM asked us to sit at a table by the door that was already occupied by a party. We look at him strangely. He explained we can have the whole table once they leave. We explained this is for my birthday dinner and he tells us not to worry because the food will taste the same and that he will make me me feel special. \n\nMy friends arrive and they have to sit awkwardly because there is a giant table leg that one decided to straddle while the other side saddles. I ask if we can put two two-tops together but the GM says he wants to save those for the couples. He explained that we were supposed to have a table in the back but the other table back there was a reservation for 14 that arrived with 22 people. So I guess if you roll with two dozen, they will bend over backwards to accommodate your party. We pray for our table mates to leave. After we order they do and we scoot over. \n\nThe food was good except for: 1) the beef bourguignon, which was overcooked (the reduction was reduced too much, making it salty and intense and the meat wasn't melt in your mouth but on the dry side), 2) dinner bread, which was stale and dry, 3) profiteroles, which had good flavor but was also on the stale side.\n\nWhen the dessert was brought out, they turned off the lights and sang happy birthday, which was the fourth time that happened that night. Afterwards the GM asked if I felt special. His smug condescension was so infuriating. \n\nThe bill came and nothing was comped. I wish I picked a different place for my birthday dinner.", "author": "Leah F."}

It was hard picking only three each, but I was happy with our choices. I especially loved the bay blue cheese. So creamy and such great flavor. The bone marrow was a generous serving. Four beefy bones?! Yes please! I was the fat a$$ that ate two of them. The foie torchon had good flavor and was a decent size. I actually really wanted to have the seared foie you can add to their steak, but unfortunately, they were not serving it that day, so I was disappointed. I prefer seared foie over a torchon. The rest of the dishes were good as well. The escargot comforting with it's garlic parsley butter. Good for dipping with the complimentary bread and butter. The tomato salad was refreshing. The oysters had a nice sweetness to them. The mignonette was very tasty. The creme brulee was okay. I like my brulees firmer and this was a little too runny for me. Our red wine paired well with everything and my dad seemed to enjoy his coffee.\n\nRevelry is a small restaurant, so I'd recommend making reservations. Our waiter was sweet and attentive given he seemed to be the only one on the floor. I'm bummed I missed out on their seared foie. I may come back just for that!

That's like telling someone that they have to fly to San Francisco then rent a car to drive down to L.A., what's the point of going to Hollywood when you spend all your time just to get there? Must she land in Paris first? Isn't there a direct flight that can take her to Toulouse? He tries to explain to her it's because they'd will first spend a week in Manhattan, in a hotel by Central Park west, with a possible meal at Blue Barn, only the best restaurant in America right now and that changed the flight itinerary. She finally turned her attention back to this little neighborhood bistro, let out a sigh, \"Well, at least you don't have to go to France to have a decent French meal around here.\"\n\nRevelry showed up on the San Francisco eating map not too long ago. It's a slice of France in this ever-increasingly French neighborhood of Hayes Valley. It's French inspired, according to the web page, or sometimes called New American. But it felt French at the core. If this restaurant was in France, it'll be called French and Modern European. \n\nWhat will surprise most people, however, would be the large size it tends to serve. A starter sweet bread is entirely big enough to serve as an entree or shared among two people. The salad size is big enough to serve two. Definitely go for the duck confit as it's quite similar to what you'd expect in France. Steak frites could easily be twice as large as what you'd see in France, or any number of French restaurants around the neighborhood. The owner, who hails from the Alsace region, says that this being America, one must serve American sized meal. All entirely reasonable, and makes this place stand out even more as it can easily become a repeat indulgence for it has quality food, good ambience, and a serving portion size that you rarely see these days in the city. \n\nYou really don't need to go elsewhere if you wish to get a modern European with French twist meal without breaking the bank. And if this is not all.. the owner is about to open another French place with a strong focus on Alsatian food in Mission Bay. It would not surprise anyone if you have not heard about Alsatian food. Up until now, there has not been any Alsatian restaurants in San Francisco, not even in the entire West Coast. Alsace is a region that changed hands between the French and Germans over the centuries. It combines the best elements of two cuisines and forms it's very own style over time. It's really the best of both worlds. Now San Francisco will finally get to see more of it.\n\nThe order of the universe was finally restored after this scrumptious meal.", "author": "Victoria E."}

We wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on baked Camembert and oysters to start, and for our meal I got gnocchi and the husband got a filet.  Everything was just so perfect.  I never thought I would taste gnocchi that amazing in a French restaurant.  For dessert we had some cookies and profiteroles.

Our group got there in bits and pieces, but we were starving so they let us order a bottle of champagne and appetizers and seated us before everyone got there, which I appreciate!  We got a bottle of sparkling ros\u00e9, and a board of three cheeses and three charcuterie plus some ceviche to start.  Our server was very helpful and friendly and clearly did not mind out group coming in parts and ordering haphazardly.   The ros\u00e9 was good, although one of the group said it was too sweet...however we ordered a second bottle and she had another glass, so there.  The cheese and charcuterie was awesome!  It's such a standard usually, but this came with two kinds of warm toasted bread, nuts, dried fruit, mustards, chocolate and honey!  And the cheese and charcuterie was delicious, and at first glance tiny, but it was all so rich and filling.  The ceviche also bright and limey, if also very tiny.  We split a beet salad, the mushroom risotto and the salmon with pea pur\u00e9e and asparagus.  It was all very good, though the risotto was a bit thick and set by the time it got down the table to me.  Six people, four appetizers, two entree and two bottles of champagne ended up being about $55/each w tax and tip.  We weren't stuffed, but comfortably full of delicious tidbits.  I'd like to come back and bring just the boyfriend and have a long romantic dinner here.", "author": "Nicole B."}

We felt like personal guests of the host but of course we had just met! \n\nThe food: Fantastic! One of the best Filet Mignon's I've ever had - perfectly seasoned and prepared. Their main course menu changes every week but I was told this is so popular it is always offered. One of our party was a wine aficionado and was also very happy with the great selection of French, Spanish and local wines. \n\nCrabcake appetizer - amazing! \n\nDessert: Pecan tart - it reminded me of the cakes and tarts my wife and I had at an incredible patisserie we visited in Lyon, France.

Yey!\nWe wanted to order several bistro-sized items. Oysters are both baked & raw & you can order them individually which is great & true French style. Unfortunately the baked oysters, although done in Rockefeller-style our favorite, tasted too fishy. The fresh ones were better.\nIf they offered a smaller pasta portion as an option,  Revelry would earn 5+++ stars. They could take a lesson from Anchor Oyster Bar which allows a smaller portion for pasta even though it's not on the menu. We noticed the server allowed the person next to us to order fries--also not on the menu--so if the staff here were smarter,  the server + chef would have allowed my friend to order a small pasta & made more $. \nGreat wine selection, great homemade pate, cool space.

Its location in the former Samovar Tea Lounge on a route I generally associate with getting on Hwy 101 is fairly random - and that's a good thing! Because otherwise, this place would be overrun.\n\nIf you like a low-key and comfortable atmosphere focused on great food and unpretentious presentation, Revelry Cafe may just be your dream come true. The first time I came here, I had dinner with girlfriends in the most comfortable corner booth in the restaurant's front dining room. Everything was insanely delicious - and the trio of cookies was so good that I begged the waiter (whom I'm pretty sure holds some other noteworthy position at the restaurant) to bring another order that consisted solely of the most amazing chocolate chip cookies, which he did. Bless him.\n\nThe second time I dined here, my husband and I went with another couple. We sat in the elevated dining room in a cozy space I didn't enjoy as much as the booth, but the food was no less worthy. Again, the service was outstanding: warm and friendly without being overindulgent.\n\nNext time you're looking for a great place for dinner, and you're tired of trying to score a reservation at one of the usual overplayed spots in the city, give Revelry Cafe a try.

The portion was immense, the gnocchi chewy, the peas and mushrooms tasty, and the sauce verged on overpowering the mushrooms but managed not to.

When the group arrived, we were seated in our own room upstairs. Here were the highlights: \n\nAPPETIZERS: Had the oysters, bone marrow, cheese & charcuterie board and two different salads. Everybody loved the oysters, which were small but really rich and the salads, especially the special heirloom tomato with mozzarella\n\nENTREES: There were 4 entrees to choose from -- filet mignon, trout, braised beef cheeks and vegetarian risotto. All of the dishes were beautifully plated and cooked to perfection. \n\nDESSERTS: Incredible end to an already great dinner.... We had the profiteroles, clafoutine and creme brulee. \n\nWINE: Loved the sparkling rose \"cremant d'alsace\" and the Cotes du Rhone Jerome recommended was a hit...

We were disappointed the risotto wasn't on the menu and none of the entrees look particularly tempting, so we opted for a bunch of bites and starters. \n- Tuna ceviche: Very tasty, I loved the bits of chili that really brought on the heat. We didn't actually order this, we ordered the poke and apparently the chef made the ceviche by mistake so he gave it to us anyway! We were confused at first but of course it was welcomed.\n- Albacore tuna poke: There wasn't a whole lot of flavour, the quail egg was an interesting touch and the avocado was pretty hard/unripe. It was more like a tuna tartare.\n- 3-cheese board: Beautiful presentation and gorgeous bread. Can't complain with good portions of quality cheese.\n- Roasted bone marrow: Probably overcooked as it was dried out and there was very little actual bone marrow. There was barely enough for one piece of bread.\n- Crispy sweetbreads: One of the better sweetbread dishes I've had in SF. Large pieces in a lovely sauce with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n- Potato au gratin: Extremely cheesy and creamy, too bad the bigger potato slices were slightly underdone and were a bit crunchy in the center. Since we were getting pretty full (thanks to the extra ceviche and generous amounts of bread) we didn't bother sending it back, but they compted it for us anyway.\nWine selection was good too with a bit of something for everyone.

Not only did Jerome, the owner, help me plan this down to the wire, but the food was outstanding. My group of 18 guests, who are foodie professionals and quite picky, all enjoyed the exquisite French fare. This is an authentic farm-to-fork restaurant where the executive chefs lovingly curate the superb ingredients at local farmers' markets. We ordered a variety of duplicates: one of each salad (endive, duck confit, beets, Brussels sprouts), steak and eggs: medium rare, croque-monsieur, eggs Benedict, smoked salmon Benedict, the garden Benedict, Banana Fosters French Toasts, and sets of the 3-choice charcuterie (we selected salami, prosciutto, and speck). Our faves? Hands-down, the steak was divinely cooked and seasoned to perfection. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict were soft, palatable, and creamy. The Bananas Fosters French Toast had this delectable caramel sauce that was pure addiction. The Brussels spouts Cesar salad was gone by the time I turned around, and after we ordered another, poof! Clearly, a hit. Claudia and Chris served us with warm hospitality. We even had 4 kids in the group, and they had the high chairs and well thought-out seating arrangement all ready when our guests arrived.

They have a great table/area for bigger groups. \n\nPros\nLocation, accommodating, atmosphere (at least at the group table) and food. \n\nThe food was good but not amazing. I'd certainly eat there again after they've had time to fix the cons below.\n\nCons\nMy party arrived within 5 minutes of our reservation time and though we were immediately seated it was over 40 minutes (I checked) before we could even put a drink order in. They need additional wait staff badly. We kept asking the water guy to get the waitress for us but he just helplessly shrugged and continued to fill our water several times before she came over. We even had to ask for menus twice. Not the best vibe for starting a birthday celebration at all. \n\nThe food came our pretty slowly as well. I would have given this place 3 stars if they weren't new. I think they'll work out their wait staff issues and end up being a solid neighborhood spot. I recommend going with just a couple of people rather than a large group - at least for the next couple of months while they work out the kinks.", "author": "Amber F."}

For example the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was not only broken, the ramekin was too shallow which made the creme very warm. We didn't even finish it which is unheard of. The naked oysters were also too soggy. No Crispy crust. Which might be due to the fact  Two courses were certainly sitting and waiting to long because the food was luke warm or weepy. And the lobster bisque, aka lobster water was below warm, almost cold, not creamy at all and was flavorless. The worst part was our waiters attitude. He talked down to us several times and through out the whole meal giving people the wrong dish. He spent more time chatting to friends at the bar than serving. \n\nThe image of their food is greatly misleading on their website. Named the size of their portions or dishes. Plan to leave hungry. We ordered the steak dish and I only got 4 asparagus stems and I think 5-6 potatoes. Hidden under a small cut of meat. Meat was cooked perfectly but when you run out of side before your meat. Then something is wrong. Also the little gem salad is grilled. Or at least mine was which was not mentioned on the menu. The heat from the lettuce was cooking the salad dressing which I think was Caesar. Don't know never mentioned in menu and even when I asked the waiter he ignored my question and walked away. \n\nA friend recommended the radishes and don't get me wrong I love fresh veggies. But cleaned radishes sprinkled with sea salt does not make a dish. Oh and the asparagus was so over cooked the tips were shriveled up shrubs. I recommend walking down the street to Absinthe or Frances for a more dependable meal. And nicer service.", "author": "brian k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-15", "description": "I fell in love with this space when it was a tea house, and, though we were a little put off by the look of the new sign out front, my tea friend and I finally decided to try Revelry Bistro for dinner.  We were both blown away by the delectable, but not fussy, food and still-wonderful vibe. On that basis, I chose Revelry as the venue for a brunch I hosted last weekend to celebrate my City Hall wedding a few days before.  I reserved the entire upper space, toward the back of the restaurant, for our party of 18. (I was rightly admonished that it gets pretty crowded at 22.) The Revelry folks were absolutely wonderful from start to finish: really nice and easygoing, but utterly professional. After a few email exchanges about basic parameters with Brad, the chef, and Jerome, the maitre d', I decided to have parts of the meal served family style.  At that point, Jerome asked me to come down so we could discuss menu and logistics. He spent a good hour with me one afternoon about five days before the party, liberally popping the corks on expensive champagne bottles for me to sample so I could choose what to pour for my guests.  Then we chose a menu: a few appetizers (cheeses, olives, radishes); three different salads; and five different entree options. I also wanted my guests to be able to order any kind of coffee drinks they wanted, and wine, beer, and other non-champagne drinks, and that I would bring cake for dessert. My favorite moment of the meeting was when Jerome looked at me soberly and said, \"This is going to be your day, and I want you to have a wonderful party, but we will need the space back to prepare for other guests.  So you have to make sure everyone is out of there by . . . 4 pm.\"  (The brunch was starting at 11!) I told him that would not be a problem. He took copious notes, and emailed me later that evening to confirm everything we had decided, including the title of the event, to appear at the top of the little menu cards he would have printed specifically for the brunch. The party itself was just plain glorious. I showed up early to bring the cakes and lay down name cards.  The lovely wooden table was set beautifully, bistro style, little jars of fresh flowers down the middle, no table cloth.  Champagne was chilling in buckets of ice, flutes beautifully set out waiting to be filled. I'd asked for food to be served about 45 minutes after everyone arrived to allow time for our guests to mingle and nibble and sip.  We had a dedicated server, the wonderful Kat, who took care of every little thing, pouring champagne, bringing coffee, whisking away empty glasses. The food (brussels sprouts, duck confit, a few kinds of eggs benedict, steak and frites, a tuna sandwich) was delicious. Damn, I'm wishing I were back there right now. One of my guests, a real foodie, noted how Brad brought out super flavors without leaning on the butter and salt, like many French-style chefs do. And the service was fabulous--very warm and light-hearted, attentive, but not intrusive, not fussy.  This was truly one of the nicest parties I've ever thrown. And I was amazed to find when we  finally left, that it WAS after 3. If I could give six stars I would. I can't wait to go back to Revelry.", "author": "Nancy T."}

We ordered a lot of specials because they all sounded delicious and these are the ones I personally tasted:\n\nFrench onion soup - Standard but tasty.

I really liked the tomato jam that it came with because it helped to cut the rich fattiness.\nDuck confit salad - I had a few bites and it was very flavorful yet clean.\nPotato gnocchi - If it's on the specials, YOU MUST ORDER! The dish was filled with mushrooms, truffle flavors, and spinach.  It's a little rich but if you can't handle the entire dish, order it for the table.\nFilet mignon with foie gras - Rich, decadent and memorable. And the foie gras portion was pretty generous. There was a flavor of star anise that lent an Asian flavor.\nTrio of epic cookies - While I liked the rich peanut butter cookie, my friend declared the chocolate one the best she's ever had (and she's not a chocolate person).\nSorbet - We had pomegranate, coconut and raspberry.

Both the Brussels sprouts Caesar salad and the duck confit salad were pretty well balanced and the risotto with mushrooms, though a tad on the salty side, was excellent. Wines are reasonably priced and well curated. Atmosphere is delightful: like a dressed up bistro with a homey but slightly elegant vibe. Service was leisurely paced but they never brought us a couple more toast points to go with our baked Camembert.", "author": "Helen T."}

The amount of choice on the menu was a pleasant surprise considering it is a small place.  Great selection of wine and beer as well!  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  It is on our list of places we would visit again.", "author": "Dave B."}

Our date couple was already seated and enjoying a decanter of wine and some olives. It was sometime before 5 but that still impressed me that they seated them with out the full party. We had the big wood table in the front of the restaurant. The table sucks! I would highly recommend they replace it with something more practical. It seems large but the way the legal are situated it definitely felt cramped with 5 people. The food is absolutely amazing. We ordered almost everything on the menu. The snails were perfectly cooked. Usually they are chewy and just a vehicle for garlic and butter. These could have been plain and they would have still been perfect! The sweat breads are ridiculous! Even the mushrooms the thymus gland sat atop were good. Our couple contains a Brazilian who was very happy with their salt cod. He kept saying this takes 3 days to make. I find French food to be very simple. It doesn't typically have strong flavors that can overshadow poor technique. This restaurant could easily be in France. Well, except the service is also great! Everything from the beet salad to the desert was truly spectacular. This is easily on of the best French restaurants in the city.", "author": "Corey Jace W."}

We had the radishes, foie gras torchon, pork belly and filet mignon. Everything was tasty and seasoned well. The foie with shaved truffle was divine with a perfect portion size for 2 (or 4 for a taste). My rare filet was perfectly cooked and paired with simple but classic potatoes and green beans. My boyfriend's pork belly was wow. The meat was tender, and the skin was shatteringly crisp. It came with these warm apricots that were surprising and addictive. Lovely meal overall. A tad pricy to be called an everyday bistro option (like say, Chez Maman), but certainly not breaking the bank for the quality of food. Service was attentive, warm and friendly. Wine and beer list extensive and nicely-curated. Atmosphere inviting and spacious with plenty of tables to accommodate both large and small groups.", "author": "Michelle F."}

It was extremely busy but even so the owner took the time to have a chat with us . He and his fianc\u00e9 are so sweet and passionate about Revelry! \n\nWe shared a cheese and charcuterie board that was a perfect way to start. We also had the braised short rib which was amazing!! Food was gorgeously presented and delicious! \n\nWe are so happy for this couple starting a new business and wish them much luck! We will be back for sure!", "author": "J R."}

Wife and I came here on a Saturday evening at about 5 PM, earlier than our reserved time of 5:30 PM.  We were cordially greeted and seated immediately upstairs, which has about 4 intimate tables and a large central table for about ten persons.  This room was much more esthetically pleasing than downstairs which was more like a bar.  We ordered a dozen assorted oysters and the beef marrow for appetizers.  The oysters were super fresh and delicious as others' reviews indicate.  They somehow forgot that we also ordered the marrow, so we wound up eating them (four yummy pieces) after the main courses.  Wife had the fish (some sort of white fish), which was OK but rather dry.  I had the tournedos Rossini topped with seared foie gras, which was perfectly cooked (medium rare on the rarer side), and, with the foie gras,, it was absolutely delicious. After the marrow dessert (!), we were quite full and skipped the dessert.  The service was solicitous, friendly, and prompt except for the faux pas concerning bone marrow.  We also enjoyed the background music of French chansons and Nora Jones.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here and will be back for the oysters and tournedos.", "author": "Hoyle L."}

The menu is interesting, the served portions are ample, the owners are charming, and the wait staff pleasant and helpful. We ordered Osso Buco, mushroom risotto, and grilled salmon for main courses. For starters we had ahi poke, bone marrow, and chicken liver pate. We all loved our own food and everyone else's as well. I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Terry H."}

In fact, my girlfriend and I ended up closing the restaurant down and had the opportunity to meet the owner, who is super passionate about his craft and excited to mingle with his patrons to come up with his next great offering. I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for a humming SF eatery in a tucked away historic neighborhood.And with a killer brunch set to launch in a few weeks, this place will definitely be a summer go to", "author": "Kiki N."}

I knew it was the new venture of an excellent local chef, Brad Roth, who has never failed to deliver in the past. I was not disappointed! The crudo was superb, and the filet melted in my mouth! Not to mention the truffle butter on top! AND the bacon brittle on the salad was delicious! The presentation was beautiful and generous as well. Oh did I mention the bone marrow seasoned to perfection? An excellent way to feed the soul on a Saturday night!", "author": "Angelina K."}
