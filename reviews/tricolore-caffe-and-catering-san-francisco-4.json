Arriving at 12:00, the line was still short and tables available. By 12:15, the line was to the door. So my advice is to try to go early.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. We all ordered something different. I think the best looking dish was the pasta with chicken and mushrooms and a cream sauce. The Vegetarian Lasagna was approved by the vegetarian in the group! I had the Penne Bolognese. The sauce was not as flavorful as I expected and I needed to add some pepper flakes to spice it up. The portions were a good size. A couple of people in our group couldn't finish their plates.\n\nOverall rating 4 stars. 3 1/2 for the food and 4 1/2 for the ambience. The d\u00e9cor, music, and friendly staff make this someplace I would return to. I will try the pizza next time.", "author": "Marvin M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-03", "description": "I've been to Tricolore Caffe & Catering a couple of times while visiting a customer nearby. Tricolore is your standard Italian restaurant with pizza, panini and a couple of pasta entrees. It has an online ordering link on their website that is a convenient option for ordering. During my first visit I got a slice of pizza and half panini combo ($8.95) to-go and went for the chicken pizza and salmon panini.\n\nThis is another restaurant in FiDi that has not signs for picking up online orders. Anyway the line starts from the left for ordering with the pay station to the right. For on-line orders you can directly head to the pay station which makes others waiting in line feel that you are cutting in line. A little more organization is warranted. During the first visit they were very busy so I had to wait another 10 minute to get my order.\n\nThe short review would be that the pizza and panini are both average at best. The pizza has a little too much oil which literally drips out of the foil and on to the paper bag. It is like a regular chain store bought pizza with a thick crust. The panini on the other hand was not heated (or toasted) even though I had asked for it to be while ordering. I was also not a very big fan of the bread that was used. It was tough and crumbly.\n\nI decided to give them one more try. This time I got the Pesto pizza slice and chicken panini. This time they were not very busy and my order was ready when I reached about 20 minutes after ordering. Again the experience was the same. Oily pizza, dry bread for the panini. Pricewise this is about 30% cheaper than other lunch places in FiDi, but the quality shows in the food. If I'm around I'll stop by but Tricolore is not a candidate for my lunch rotation.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Everyone who works here is super nice, and they actually take the time and effort to get to know their customers. I met up for lunch with my friend, and he suggested this place since it's right across the street from his office. I got here a little early to answer emails, so I got a small cup of black coffee to keep me company.\n\nThere are so many delicious-sounding options on the menu to choose from. Perhaps next time I'll have to try a hot entree, but this time I settled with the sandwich and salad combo. My sandwich contained mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. On the side, I got the Tricolore pasta salad. To be honest, both were kinda tasteless and not very filling. I couldn't finish my food, so I ended up giving it to a homeless person. At least it didn't go to waste! Supposedly.\n\nAnyways, it's clear that the food here is made with the freshest homemade ingredients. It's relatively inexpensive. The service is fantastic. They even do catering! There's so much to love about Tricolore Caffe, including their good intentions, so I would be willing to give this place another try in the future.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I had been searching for an in between type of catering -- not full-service, but also not just drop off.  We needed warmers and someone to set up the food but not the full service.  I struggled to find a middle ground and Tricolore was just right. \n\nWe went in to sample the food and Michael was very gracious and we set up a menu right there for the following Sunday -- lasagna, ravioli, salad, antipasto, tortellini.  It was all solid, good food.  My mom wanted a cuisine that would appeal to everyone and this was just right --\n not super strong flavors, filing, solid. I got nervous as Sunday approached and tried to assuage my irrational fear that we would run out of food by asking Michael to add more food onto the menu.  With a lot of honesty and candor, he assured me that he didn't want to charge me more money unnecessarily and that we would have more than enough.  Even so, a day before, I panicked and added two more dishes.  Michael was right of course and we had so much left over but we were able to take it home so it's ok.  \n\nHe was very prompt in dropping off the food and setting it up at the venue and even picked it up the same day (a huge relief).

Their panini sandwiches are made with focaccia bread and it's not oily nor dry. I liked it a lot. On the second day, I had a slice of Chicken Pizza with Caesar Salad and I added a small Turkey Pasta Salad. The pizza was tasty. Just a single slice is only $3.95. Since I got the salads, my total was about $15. Three salads of your choice is $8.95. Their prices are fairly low and especially for the Financial District. They're really nice at this cafe.

They deliver the pizzas right to our office exactly at the scheduled time, and it's perfectly hot and fresh tasting every time.\n\nWe originally used to order from the Pizza Orgasmica at Embarcadero, but after one bad customer service experience there we decided to check out Tricolore instead. It was a great move! The pizzas taste much more authentic. Simple, quality ingredients and not too overloaded or crazy. My favorites that we've ordered are the Tricolore (low fat ricotta, mozzarella, tomatoes and basil), rustica (saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, prosciutto, garlic and oregano) and the al pesto (low-fat ricotta and mozzarella, pesto and sun dried tomatoes).\n\nIf you're having an office party or just want a pizza fix in the FiDi, i would def recommend Tricolore!", "author": "Evelyn S."}

First of all when I went to order I noticed that one of the cooks behind the counter was staring at me and smiling at me in an unsettling manner. I tried to ignore it hoping it would stop, but as I stood waiting for my order it continued. I then noticed that the two other cooks present had congregated and began speaking to each other in Spanish. I could make out only a few words since I was standing so far away. What I did hear was not at all what any young woman would want to hear. When my food was finally done the same cook who was initially staring at me called out my name to announce that my order was ready. When I picked my food up I tried to  avoided any and all eye contact out of pure discomfort. I left feeling uneasy and when I arrived at my office to eat my panini I noticed that they had gotten my order wrong.

They apologized profusely for the poor customer service and meal I was served and they offered to make it up to me. I was very touched since I've left several negative reviews for other businesses before and this was the first time that one of them has ever cared enough to contact me about it. I really like business owners who prove that they actually care about their customers. \n\nSo I went in today and requested something low-carb since I was recently diagnosed as a diabetic. They offered me the minestrone soup and a grilled chicken sandwich, which I devoured in one sitting. The entire meal was DELICIOUS! I wasn't able to eat my soup for 30 minutes and to my pleasant surprise, it was still pretty warm when I finally got to eat it. Not only that, it was very tasty and fresh so I'm thinking I just found a new favorite soup. Lol. The salad was also very fresh and well-made with good quality ingredients. Yep, I'd definitely go back and eat there now!\n\nSo now I have to give Tricolore 5 stars, both for their yummy food and awesome customer service. :-)", "author": "Jessica C."}

Their salads were especially delicious -  the fusilli salad was gobbled up before I even had a chance to taste it.  I did manage to grab some marinated vegetables, which included zucchini, peppers and mushrooms - and they were garlicky and oily, just what I wanted.\n\nI will make a slight criticism of the pannini.  They were pretty skimpy on the fillings (except the grilled veggie) and there was no spreads on the sandwiches - no mustard, mayo or anything, which made them a little dry.  Fortunately we keep a fridge well stocked with condiments so we customized the pannini the way we liked them.\n\nWe will definitely use Tricolore again!", "author": ".Hon H."}

I am in love with their split pea and their butternut squash soups. \n\nPlus, the guys here are nice, remember your face, and go the extra mile. Once when their credit card swiping machine was broken and I didn't have cash, they wrote my first name on my receipt and taped it to the wall and just told me to come back some time and pay it when I had cash or the machine was fixed- which I did the next week just because they were so great about it. They could have lost that seven bucks and I could have walked away with a free meal, but finding that kind of hometown friendliness in the middle of the financial district made my day. \n\nYou can tell the food is homemade. Just like your momma's cooking- not always five stars, but always authentic and made by a real person, with fresh ingridients. A step up from a hole in the wall, but small enough to feel like you've escaped the chain sandwich stores, TriColore rocks- especially early or later than the typical lunch crowd, when the place is all yours.

The pasta here is always great but i found the pizza to be too hard and salty for my taste. \n\nOverall a nice, inexpensive place to get lunch that is on the healthy and fresh side.", "author": "Nerd A."}

Whether it is to go or to stay, I found them to be quick and efficient. Their house salad has a decent amount of goat cheese and cherry tomatoes. I have also had their turkey focaccia and it was big enough for 2 lunches. Also had their lentil soup and was good too. \nIt usually never fails. One item on the menu/display that was unusual was swiss bichermuesli which is not something you see everyday. Yet to try it but kudos for selling it.", "author": "Florencia P."}

Fair point, but the way I see it is...it's because people are used to what I call the American-style of Italian food. So - I reiterate...order from here if you like light (more) authentic Italian quick cuisine/good catering. \n\nI would still order from Tricolore for an office event becauce frankly, it's a lot cleaner (because there isn't crazy greasy sauce spilling everywhere), works better with our budget, it's healthy and people loved the salad.", "author": "Cat T."}

I've probably eaten just about everything on the menu several times over.  Two observations stand out from the countless meals eaten at my desk:\n\nOne, I love their soups (for a take out lunch place).  Tomato white bean and pure of butternut squash are both healthy and veg/vegan friendly (not that I'd ever say no to a cheese or dairy).  They have a weekly rotation of soups and there is always something good and healthy.\n\nTwo, this is the only Italian restaurant in which I've been served bad focaccia.  I just hate their homemade bread, which is saying a lot as I'm a total bread / carb whore.  Seriously, I could live off of a bizzaro-Atkins diet should on be invented (patent pending).  Yet I won't eat the bread at Tricolore because it is bland, sort of woody, and lacking in the classic focaccia flavor or texture.  This is important to know because all sandwiches are made with it too, so I avoid them like cold brussel sprouts served in the morning by Grandma because you refused to eat them the night before.... Um, ignore that last bit, I think I'm over sharing.\n\nLong story short: Solid lunch place, just stick to the soup and pizza.  Other non-sandwich options are nice too.  Very solid place.", "author": "Aaron M."}

My friend took me here while searching for lunch and I instantly found a lot of options. Prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I love the atmosphere too, it's homey and comfortable. \n\nThere's a big menu for the little restaurant - pizza, pasta entrees, panini, calzone, soup and a variety of salads. I also like how they list prices for combinations so you don't have to wonder if it's going to cost you a fortune. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try the paninis and pizzas - the ingredients all look very tasty and I can't get enough of prosciutto! They also have breakfast and a full coffee bar with espresso drinks made from organic coffee beans. \n\nI went with the pasta bolognese and a cup of vegan minestrone soup. The portions were generous and elegant presentation for a to-go order. It was so good and I love how it wasn't too greasy or salty. I'm definitely coming back for more!

They put it in the oven so that the cheese melts into perfect yumminess.  I also get a small mediterranean salad which has thick slices of cucumber, tomato, olives and cheese.  Oh it's so tasty!\n\nThe staff is so friendly and always smiling.  They will not only remember the faces of their regulars, but also their names.
