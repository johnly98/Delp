What I appreciate about this location is that it faces a fairly large plaza with a water fountain, a few dozen tables, and pillars around the water fountain where you can sit. \n\nThe location itself is pretty small - don't expect to sit inside to eat your meal, unless you want to deal with dozens of customers standing around waiting for their order. The line itself goes pretty fast, but expect to wait around 15-30 minutes if you go anytime between 12-1pm (aka rush hour for lunch). The servers are friendly, and do their best to get your order across, and yell out order numbers despite the place getting super crowded.\n\nThe menu is simple - choose between skin or skinless chicken, breast or thigh (or some combination), and white rice, brown rice or just broccoli. You can even opt to get half/half (i usually go for half brown rice, half broccoli). \n\nThe chicken itself is actually very tasty, considering they simply boil it. I highly recommend sipping the chicken broth that comes with it, as it starts to get dry. They also offer sriracha and spicy sauce to change up the flavor, although it does come with this soy sauce. \n\nWith tax, your meal usually comes out to around $15. As expected, eating in the city, but admittedly a bit steeper than I would want in a simple and healthy meal.", "author": "Michael H."}

The rice is gorgeously seasoned - not sure how they've done it, but it's incredible. The chicken is flavourful enough to stand on its own, but not so much so that it's out of balance. There's a delicious soy/ginger sauce that you can use either for dipping, or pour all over your dish (I opted for the latter). And to top it off, they have a house habanero sauce - like Sriracha but better - a drizzle goes a long way, so beware!\n\nThere's lots of seating inside and outside, although much of the outside seats are ledges, so if it's busy you'll probably be holding your meal in your lap.\n\nI'd definitely go back, and would strongly recommend it if you're looking for a simple, delicious Thai meal at a reasonable price.", "author": "Sebastian M."}

Not in the sense that I never pay $15 for lunch, but moreso in that I don't think $15 for chicken & vegetables (the PALEO) is justified.\n\nNevertheless, I find myself eating here because I'm addicted to the sauce(s). The sauce they serve with their khao mun gai is some sort of mix between two popular Thai street sauces, nam jim tao jiew & nam jim hai lam. You can find recipes for one or the other on the interwebs, but R&R's particular concoction boggles my mind with it's bewildering proportion of chili, ginger, garlic and fermented soybean. Sometimes I want to pay the extra $1 and take sauce for home. But not only that! The SRIRACHA here is the best I've ever had, and I'm not as obsessed with sriracha as everyone else seems to be. I've scoured Asian markets, even Thai markets, for this particular brand. No such luck so I can only get my fix here :( The habanero sauce is also pretty damn delicious, and I find myself dipping amongst the three in more rotation than I would salsas at a taqueria. Seriously so addicting.\n\nI almost strayed from trying this place because I have a Thai friend who did not give her stamp of approval. I guess it was inevitable that I'd one day walk into this newer SoMa location because it's walkable from me and I'm lazy af. Glad I did because now Rooster & Rice is one of my usual lunch options.\n\nI really just wish they'd lower their prices. To put it into perspective, for a few more dollars you can get khao mun gai for lunch at the Michelin-starred Kin Khao. Rooster & Rice is even counter service, and you can definitely find cheaper, more complex uses of organic Mary's chicken at plenty of other fast casual restaurants. It's not even like they put any effort into their decor/ambience, and they literally have a max of 2 people working at a time. I REALLY JUST DON'T GET THEIR PRICE POINT. I'm willing to bet their business would do so much better if the owners would just get off their high horse.

After all, I can never get enough steamed chicken, or in this case, poached Thai-style. There's only four items on the menu. The $11.95 Original is their most popular item and the classic version of Khao Mun Gai, a breast and a thigh, both sliced boneless with their skin left intact, accompanied by some jasmine white rice that got intimate with the cup of chicken broth that comes with the dish. The $12.95 Marina is aptly named because it's a skinless breast with brown rice.\n\nThat sounds so Marina. You can bypass the cluck entirely by ordering the $9.95 Vegetarian with tofu, brown rice and seasonal vegetables, or you can split the difference like what me and Jamie W. did and order the $12.95 Paleo which allows you the choice between a breast or a thigh and accompanied just by the seasonal vegetables with no rice. While we love broth-drenched rice, we didn't need the extra calories or barbs, and the chicken was nicely succulent (photo: http://bit.ly/2eMp3Yg). I barely used the spicy soy sauce preferring instead the chili-infused hot sauce they provide in squeeze bottles. It has a real kick which goes well with the broccoli.\n\nBy the way, broccoli is the only \"seasonal vegetable\" I've ever seen them serve so keep that in mind. There's more seating here than in the Marina, about a dozen seats inside, several patio tables on the immediate terrace and lots of open seating in the 303 2nd Street plaza, an inviting spot on a warm day akin to the wooden lounges on The High Line (photo: http://bit.ly/2eMabt0).

I added on a side of veggies (broccoli) for an extra $2. OH EM GEE, I would come back time an time again for that ginger dipping sauce. It was one of the best sauces I've had in a while. The chicken was good, the rice was heaven and add in that dipping sauce to elevate the entire dish from level 4 to 36, and you've got a HUGE flavor dish. \n\nI now know the reason for the hype.

Friendly and approachable. No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered \"The Marina\" chicken plate which it includes skinless, poached organic Mary's chicken breast with organic brown rice and slices of fresh cucumbers. It also includes fresh chili ginger garlic with soybeans sauce and a small cup size of fresh chicken broth. As a result, that meal tasted flawless and outstanding! It compared and tasted like eating a Chinese styled chicken breast right directly from an Asian supermarket because of a distinct broth taste! Very clean and eatable to bite without any leftover bones around! The brown rice also cooked perfectly without being too harden and dry especially the sliced cucumbers. The sauce, da bomb goodness! I really tasted the ginger into my mouth along with a spicier taste of chili and garlic combined! Awesome sauce! Finally, the chicken broth tasted superior and naturally delicious just like slurping Sawnson's Chicken Broth. Not a bad meal for lunch!\n\nParking at Rooster & Rice can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Rooster & Rice is the finest and most remarkable chicken food shop that I've ever visited for the very first time right here in San Francisco!

The original comes with a nice amount of chicken, rice, some cucumbers, a cup of soup, and a small container of soybean sauce. \n\nWhile I didn't end up eating my food here, I will begin by looking at the ambience of the location. The ambience seems pretty modern. Your experience begins when you enter the front doors and you see a pretty minimal menu, which in my books is an A+, since minimal menus allow for less \"decision fatigue\". I also liked the interior design, since the colors weren't very distracting from the whole experience (yes, my whole experience of waiting for my food to-go haha). There is also a courtyard outside of this restaurant, giving you another option if you think the indoor seating is too claustrophobic. \n\nOn to the food! I think what stood out the most to me was the soup; there was just so much flavor, that I probably would have been happy if I had just drunk that (well flavor-wise). The soybean sauce (from which I tasted garlic and ginger, as some of the more prominent flavors) was also something worth mentioning, as it gave an interesting kick to the chicken. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back here again, and probably more often too, if it weren't a 15 minute walk away from my workplace.\n\n\nPhoto I took (Instagram):\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYytElLBObT (Original)\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BasPORrBBej/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BcGFCpFB48E/", "author": "Ed W."}

After all, which millennial wouldn't be able to resist an expensive but photogenic lunch with a clever fitting Instagram caption! (Yes I am aware that I am making fun of myself)\n\nR&R illustrates my love-hate relationship with the SF food scene--it's delicious, wholesome, high-quality, global-inspired, but borders on downright unaffordable. My counter-service lunch of chicken over rice with sauce, cucumbers, and broccoli (an extra $2) totaled to $15.18! In Asia, you could probably serve the same dish to a small family at the same cost. \n\nPrice rants aside, R&R creates an excellent rendition of Hainan chicken rice. My SF cynicism expected a gentrified version that would lose the original flavors and toss in random avocados and stuff (I do laugh at their poached egg option), but the complex flavors and superb quality exceeded my expectations. My favorite turned out to be the rice: the robust, fragrant chicken flavoring was memorable, and the unconventional amount of al dente-ness was a pleasant surprise. The sauce brought everything together in layers of sweet soy sauce blended with ginger, scallions, beans, and chili. I also opted for some habanero sauce (mainly to make my picture look more colorful), which added a mild creaminess.\n\nBecause of the distractingly good sauces, I found it difficult to evaluate the chicken itself. The chicken in this dish is always intentionally plain so you can fully appreciate the chicken essence. I think the use of Mary's chicken inherently has a different chicken-ness compared to the \"yellow-haired chicken\" (\u9ec3\u6bdb\u96de) traditionally used, so it's difficult to evaluate the poaching technique. The chicken broth was richly flavored and steamy, the perfect heart-warming addition to any lunch in chilly SF days.\n\nNote that although it ins't your typical greasy food, the liberal use of chicken fat and various sauces make it a more filling lunch than you'd expect from a chicken meal. For me, it also left a bit of a salty aftertaste.\n\nThe space is hipster--upbeat almost-rap-like music, impressive arrangements of succulents, communal tables of course. Outside there's a beautiful public open space courtyard. \n\nThe verdict? Yummy food, quite authentic, with a Californian flair, but at Marina prices.", "author": "Edna C."}

A bit on the pricey side for each dish ($11-$13, not including add ons like egg), but it's healthy and again, they deliver to the office.", "author": "Alison A."}

You are also able to purchase sauce at the counter, but why would you if it is free here?  They also have really good quality napkins here too!  I guess you could say that is why a rice box costs so much here?  \n\nAfter grabbing a seat, I decided to try the chicken without any sauce first.  I took a bite, and the meat was ultra soft-- melt in your mouth type quality.  However, there was no seasoning whatsoever.  It tasted so boring and plain.  I decided to try the next bite with the spicy sauce and the ginger garlic sauce. The flavors were a fusion of multiple parties in my mouth.  Needless to say, it was delicious.  The brown rice was cooked well.  The egg was a little under for my liking.  The chicken broth that comes with the meal was amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed how flavorful it was.  \n\nIn conclusion, this place is good.  However, this is something I would not get every day.  For $16, I could get three rice boxes in Chinatown.

Honestly, I think Rooster & Rice does khao man gai much better than Kin Khao, which has a Michelin star. At least, I would hope so, since that's all they serve.\n\nMy recommendation is to eat the dish by dipping the chicken into the soy sauce. If you pour it all over, I think it'd be too salty. The portion is huge, even if it is a little expensive - I can definitely split it into two meals. They also have Thai sriracha and habanero sauce available for you to take as you please (I prefer the habanero). They have a vegetarian version, which has tofu instead of chicken and seasonal vegetables. \n\nOverall wait is very short and the inside of the restaurant is cute too!\n\nI think my only complaint with Rooster & Rice is that I wish they gave more cucumbers in their original khao man gai, but I just really love cucumbers, so I finished them all before I even ate half of the chicken.\n\nAnyways, I definitely recommend checking Rooster & Rice out for lunch!

Are these tears tears of joy or tears of sadness, or am I just crying because my sneaky ninja coworkers are cutting onions again? Is this how Anton Ego felt when he took his first bite of that ratatouille? Well, in Whoville they say that the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day.\n\nRooster & Rice, located as part of the nice plaza at 303 2nd Street, is a small little restaurant that specializes in Khao Mun Gai which is also known as Hainanese Chicken. If you love Hainanese chicken, you'll for sure love the chicken here. If you're not sure if you love Hainanese chicken, then this might just be the place you fall in love with it.\n\nI've passed by this place a couple times with an intention of trying it out, but I typically find a long line here around noon so I end up opting for something else. However, on this Friday afternoon, I noticed there wasn't a line so I rushed in and quickly ordered The Original to go. I was a bit skeptical of the chicken here once I found out it was boneless, since I love dark meat and find the meat around the bone to be the most juicy and flavorful. Also, when my meal came out to be $13 flat after tax without adding any extras such as veggies or egg, I thought to myself, \"This better be good.\"\n\nThe Original comes with a bed of fragrant jasmine chicken rice, pieces of cucumber, some broth, and a soy based sauce with soybeans, ginger, garlic, and chili. They provide a good amount of meat which consists of both white breast meat and dark thigh meat. The meat is boneless, but has skin on it. The chicken turned out to be some of the most juicy chicken meat I've ever had. There was not a single piece of dry chicken to be found and each bite was a succulent artistic work that artists like Van Gogh and Ringo Starr could only dream of. It's just so wonderful to have such delicious boneless chicken meat since it isn't messy to eat and is also easy to eat which is great for a quick workday lunch. The rice is filled with the savory umami flavor from the chicken to make it the idea carb to complement the meat. The cucumber adds a contrast to all the umami flavor by adding a bit of sweetness to the meal\\. The refreshing nature of it pairs very well with the chicken especially when the chicken is dipped in their habanero or thai sriracha sauce for a spicy kick. Their soy based sauce adds so many wonderful flavors with the chicken. The fragrance of the ginger with the saltiness of the soy sauce help to accentuate the natural flavors of the chicken rather than detract from it. If all this wasn't good enough, the chicken broth on the side provides an aspect of warmth to the meal, reminding me of homemade chicken soup that could heat up a home on a cold winter day and help heal the sick.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm a huge fan of Rooster & Chicken and if you're in the area looking for lunch, this restaurant is surely a solid choice!", "author": "Joshua M."}

The broth was good too. Full of flavor, and not heavy or oily.\n\nThe jasmine rice was like the rice that's usually included in Hainan chicken dishes, in that it was very flavorful on its own. For that reason, don't dump the whole sauce container over the rice! The sauce is SUPER delicious, but if you put too much into the bowl, it can overpower the flavors of the chicken and the rice. Same goes for the optional Thai sriracha and the habanero sauce that they offer. SO good, but be careful how much you use because the bowl is far from bland even without them. \n\nWould this be 5 stars if this was cheaper? Definitely. In fact, I have no doubt that the same dish could be as little as half the price in Thai restaurants located elsewhere, like LA or Thailand itself. But let's be real: This is San Francisco. This is where many people don't think twice about dropping $15 for a simple salad. So Rooster & Rice isn't cheap, but I wouldn't say it's overpriced.\n\nWith that said, I really enjoyed the food here, and I'm happy that they opened this SoMa location.", "author": "Sara L."}

The soy-based sauce with ginger, garlic and chili added a ton of personality to the chicken and really was a treat if you dip the chicken in the broth first.  The cucumbers and cilantro help add a nice vegetal kick to cut through the richness of everything else.  The chicken though just wasn't my thing.  The limp boiled skin had such a weird slimy mouthfeel.  The chicken meat itself isn't that warm so it had the cooled off chicken taste.  And there were pieces of bone and cartilage in the mix.

Something that reminds me that life is worth living. \n\nI hopped on Yelp and saw that the Urban Picnic was replaced by Rooster & Rice, a place I had seen opened in the Marina, and now here it is - 2 blocks away from my work. Yay!\n\nUpon arriving at Rooster & Rice, i see the line. I expected this as San Franciscans are crazy. I don't usually like lines. Some people go just for the line, it seems, but I stay away. This is the first time, I actually stood in the line. I dunno... maybe it's because today the world is ending. I mean if the US is going to try something new - like elect a fascist, xenophobic, racist, sexist imbecile, then I can also try something new. Like stand in a line.\n\nUpon entry into the actual restaurant, I noticed that it was all asians and their more experimental non-asian friends. I don't know if I had ever seen so many asians in any other SOMA restaurant before. If Trump wanted to put all asians in an internment camp, they can make Rooster & Rice it's capital. He can just fence us all in like chickens.\n\nAnyhow, I got the original. DUH. the OG of course. Jesus - the marina? Really? I'm not judging. I'm just saying... I'm judging.\n\nEverything was pretty good and satisfying. As expected. The best thing was the broth which was super flavorful. Rice had a light flavor, which is fine. (Not as good as Hainanese chinese chicken, but it's fine.) Khao Mun Gai chicken is poached, where as Hainanese chicken is steamed - but end result is similar. Basically a very clean, chickeny flavor. \n\nThis is why only the most experimental of non-asians would ever come here - that poached chicken. I think it's something you grow up with. To the non-asians, it's just rubbery and too chickeny. There's a reason why chicken is battered and fried. Or smothered with bbq sauce. I actually don't love chicken ...but there is something nostalgic about eating poached / steamed chicken. Very comforting. \n\nThe ginger-soy sauce was of course delicious. You gotta have that right. I could talk about hainanese chicken sauce (which is a ginger scallion sauce), but I might have a gang of thai techies come beat me with a coconut hammer. \n\n(Aww.... don't get mad my Thai cousins... If it's any consolation, the Chinese don't do any noodle dishes as close to delicious as Tom Yum Noodle Soup.... mmmmm... Tom Yum Noodle Soup.)\n\nAnyhow... seriously I'd say the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not Hainanese Chicken Rice. And I know that's not fair. But you know what...

I always order the Original. The chicken feels fresh, tender, and juicy. The rice is super flavorful and most importantly... the sauce is just perfect. The chicken broth is also good.  The reason I'm dropping a star is because I don't think this meal is worth $13. Lunch is consistently less than $10 in the area so it's difficult to justify putting in the weekly lunch rotation.
