My small square container cost me around $4.  \n\nMy splurge lemon bar was heavy on the crust and the lemon was heavy on the sugar, but hey it satisfied my lemontastic craving for $2.\n\nI guess while I think this place is good and a bit original, I can not see going back unless I am in the area and it is convenient, since I don't eat sandwiches and the salad bar is my draw.", "author": "Susan C."}

A couple of years ago they kept messing up my sandwich order. I spoke with the owner a few times, even suggesting they use order forms so they get orders right. He made no changes. I kept going there until the fifth time they messed up my sandwich. They kept putting on onions and peppers when I very specifically asked them not to. I stopped going there for more than a year. There are plenty of other places nearby. So today I decided to give them another chance. I ordered a hot pastrami with lettuce , pickles and tomatoes. I get back to my desk and find there are peppers on my sandwich! They are absolutely terrible at getting a sandwich order right and have made no attempt to recognize the problem or fix it", "author": "Steve P."}

It wasn't the best meat, but everything else in there was pretty good.  They seem pretty busy so my guess is that most things on the menu are a step above the pastrami.

Now I had a chance to try Sweet Joanna's during the lunch hour.  The place was crowded, despite the rain.  At least down here customers formed lines, and the lines were moving.  \n\nIt was a little chaotic behind the counter, but to their credit two clerks were preparing four sandwiches at a time.  I ordered a \"club sandwich,\" which was more like a hoagie or a sub, Doritos and a Diet Pepsi for about $8.50.  \"For here or to go\" turned out to be a meaningless question.  \n\nSix B&W photos by the front door entertained me with a record of the construction of the warehouse in 1904.  It's nice to know some 8-story brick structures withstand earthquakes.  \n\nThe upgrade to three stars is only in relation to the company cafeteria.  In dry air I would go elsewhere.  \n\n---------------\nOriginal review 3/1/07: \n\nA very tasty sandwich came my way a while back, courtesy of a colleague who didn't need a whole American-style lunch.  Research (on Yelp!) recently told me it was the turkey BAT sandwich from Sweet Joanna.  \n\nSo, today I watched a very interesting market close.  After 4:20pm EST I began to think about lunch.  Figure the market closes at 4:00, and with a 20-minute delay a lot of people are getting the closing price for free at 4:20, and then they have time to unwind and wrap their lips around a long-neck Corona or something.  So where do YOU think the term 420 comes from?  \n\nBut I digress.  At 2:15pm I walked into Sweet Joanna's, and looked over the menu.  They had an open salad bar.  They also had a beautiful, bright sandwich zone, with all kinds of fresh vegetables and tasty-looking meats.  I found the turkey BAT as the \"California special\" or something like that, and decided to order it.  \n\nAnd they ignored me.  Like I was invisible or something.  Now, I could have spoken up and demanded some attention, but I had been standing there a few minutes, and three employees ignored me completely.  One was restocking.  One was talking on the telephone.  One was sort of wandering around aimlessly.  Hey, if a merchant doesn't want my money, who am I to force it on him?  \n\nOn to the next sandwich shop!  I'll get that tasty sandwich during a regular lunch hour when they're paying attention.", "author": "David D."}

The Sandwich tasted bland even the bacon had no flavor.  I got a bowl of french oino soup and the did not offer chreese or crutons to go with it.  That tasted good because it was canned soup.\n\nWith all the options down here I will save my money and go some else place.", "author": "Matthew K."}

I wanted to eat a little salad before my sandwich was ready, but it turned into a BIG salad. LOL! There were too many options to choose from and everything I tried was oh so yummy! The California Chicken Club that I  ordered was scrumptious! The ingredients were so fresh! My hubby ordered a sandwich with pesto in it and two seconds later he swallowed it whole because it was so good! Before we left I made sure to cheat on my zone diet and eat my weakness... a rice krispi treat. I had to get a cookie for the road too. BOTH homemade and so delightful!!

Its not sliced turkey like some places, but actually stripes of fresh baked turkey. I always get mixed meat, but i think you can't go wrong with all white. Even though white meat is usually dry, the turkey is so fresh and moist it doesn't matter. Plus when the cheese melts into the nooks and crannies of the turkey its like heaven. \n\nYou can't go wrong with a california club, but some of their other sandwiches are good. I had their BBQ sub, it was delicious and filled with BBQ sauce. It was really messy and it kinda felt greasy, but i think thats the kind of thing you expect when you get a BBQ sub. Chicken, onions, jalepenos, mushrooms, it all makes the perfect combo.\n\nFor their salad bar, its not exactly the best. Nothing really sticks out. I tried a little bit of everything, but i only really liked their pasta salads and their mushrooms. I tried that chicken under the hot plate, the flavor was good, but a little dry.\n\nIf you're craving a sandwich for about 6 bucks this is the place to go.
