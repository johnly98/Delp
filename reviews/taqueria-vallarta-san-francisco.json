First of all, the restaurant is quite spacious, which I can imagine it being filled up during the drunk and hangry hours. Since we came in at 2pm on a Sunday, it was not very busy. We went for the street tacos, which they serve in a cart on the side. You can see all the various meats cooking up on their grill. I went for two tacos: carne asada and tripitas ($3 each). Per recommendation, the tripitas was delicious! It was my first time having beef tripe in a taco and the crispy texture gave it such great flavor. As for the carne asada, it was pretty standard as a taco.\n\nEven though this spot is pretty authentic, I think I am too spoiled by the best and cheap Mexican food from LA. To add, it's quite pricey for a taco.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

We ordered a regular burrito but our total came out to $11 something... \"Weirdly expensive\", we thought, but had never come here and paid without question.

My boyfriend took only 2 bites when he notices some white sauce... \"Is this sour cream? That's what tasted so weird!\". \n\nMy boyfriend, who hates dairy, goes up to the same cashier to fix the issue. When he first describes the situation to her, she goes, \"So? You got sour cream and guac, why are you complaining?\" \"Well, I wanted a regular burrito, you even charged me for a super burrito when I didn't want it.\" Granted, the burrito was half-eaten, but that was me! It wasn't until halfway that we noticed a whole dollop of sour cream, and we were so focused on eating that we hadn't noticed its contents. \n\nLong story short, the lady refused to refund or remake our burrito, and when my boyfriend gave her back the burrito, she freaking THREW IT at the cooks!!!

Not greeted and no eye contact from the lady behind the cash register.I asked for a chicken quesadilla and that order went to the kitchen. I also asked for a chicken tamale. She said, \"I'll see if we have any.\" She went into somewhere & came back out,  then put a cold tamale in their microwave. I asked for nacho chips & salsa. She got out a paper plate and put some nacho chips on the plate and pointed to where I could get the salsas. There was a dip station! Unfortunately, the dip station was not very appealing... Spoons and different types of salsas were spilled into each other, on the counter & floors. I chose pico de gallo and sat down.\n\nChips weren't special & little salt. Salsa had good flavor but watery. My quesadilla came out and it was your basic quesadilla, not much to go wrong here. And it was OK. The tamale on the other hand, tasted old, bland and with small portion of chicken. Wasn't worth it - wasn't eaten.\n\nI know every restaurant can have a bad night. No way of knowing! I don't enjoy my visit on a bad night. I was just gonna leave it at that; not a great visit. Too bad.

My favorite things to get here are the carne asada and pollo asodo tacos, which are made right in front of you. The meat is tender and the tortillas taste very fresh. Make sure to ask for grilled onions, as they don't add it by default. Also make sure to add the garnishes/salsa lined along the taco bar (there's also a separate salsa bar towards the back of the restaurant). The camarones and carne asada plates are also delicious and come with tortillas, rice, beans, salad, etc. The camarones a la diabla in particular is incredible and one of our favorites!!!! The sauce is made with chipotle peppers and has a fiery, roasted kick with lots and lots of heat. We've tried to find somewhere in South Bay that does this dish as well as Taqueria Vallarta but no luck yet.  \n\nThe salsa bar is great and has lots of options, including pico de gallo, tomatillo, habanero, etc. I believe they're all made in house. The pico de gallo tastes especially great with the tacos. The tortilla chips (75 cents) are a worthy addition to any meal, mainly because you get to try more of the salsas. Warning, a couple of the salsas are very spicy and will likely cause your stomach to hurt. \n\nPersonally, I love the vibe of the restaurant. Makes me feel like I'm in Mexico. Not fancy by any means, but who cares? It's a taqueria. It's clean enough. And it's delicious. Plus, it's in the nicer part of the Mission, so at least it's a little less sketchy outside. \n\nBonus points for accepting credit/debit cards and having a cold water dispenser.", "author": "Tahmina N."}

The rest of the plane was packed with silent, exhausted youth streaming back from Coachella but this guy, Gen-X not Millennial, had missed it due to family obligations.  A Quincea\u00f1era held priority.\n\nWhen someone of Mexican origin has just attended a Quincea\u00f1era and they proceed to tell you \"the best, most authentic Mexican tacos I've found in SF are at Taco Vallarta\" you listen.  Or rather, I listen.  I headed to Taqueria Vallarta (this location has the best reviews and is open until 1 a.m.) as soon as my plane landed.  \n\nTaqueria Vallarta is exactly why, on a short flight, you should strike up a conversation with the person beside you.  You never know when you'll hit gold.\n\nAt Taqueria Vallarta you're two steps through the door before you can order your tacos.  Walk a bit further - or don't, really - and you can order off the larger menu.  Why you would want to, I don't know.\n\nThese 2-corn tortilla + protein masterpieces are ready in a nano-second.  Once in hand, a lineup of radishes, onions, cilantro, and salsa confronts you.  Say yes to all then find a table.\n\nWe sampled carne asada tacos, pork tacos, and goat tacos which we liked pretty much in that order with that carne asada being a thing of glory.  The tacos are $2.50 nowadays and many people order many.  Four between two people proved filling and ample even if we appeared to be outliers.  \n\nThe authentic Mexican street tacos at Taqueria Vallarta are glorious.  The ambiance, not so much.  This is not a place to linger but it's a fabulous place to refuel.  With those tacos being made in the entryway I'm pretty certain I'll never make it to the larger menu and I have no  problem with that.  \n\nThe best Mexican street tacos in SF?

But I was more excited about the taco bar (with exotic meats :P). The two of us ordered: \n\nTaco Bar - $2.50 each. We ordered 3. I've had pretty darn kick-ass tacos from taco trucks in LA, so I couldn't help but compare the tacos here to street tacos in LA. I would say that the texture of beef tongue, and regular beef tacos that we ordered from Taqueria Vallarta were good, but a bit on the dry and bland side - make sure you ask for the grilled onions! Because the tacos were pretty bland, we had to put A LOT of salsa on the tacos for some flavor. If I were to give LA taco truck tacos an 8, I'd give the tacos here a 5. \n\nSeafood platter - $22. Not that great imo. They made it with all frozen seafood. The platter came with rice and beans. The frozen seafood just didn't have a good texture. I think our platter went straight from frozen to cooked, there wasn't even a thawing process. So the seafood tasted like firewood, too chewy/dry, just not right. I wouldn't order this again. \n\nThe place isn't super clean, but the ambiance felt authentic.

Per usual, I yelped a place to get elote, and found Taqueria Vallarta. They also have tamales (PLUS!). Went kinda late, so found parking right in the front, but I can see how that could be a problem using busy hrs. As you walk thru the door, immediate to the right is the taco bar. You can order straight thru there if you have cash, or wait in line to pay with credit card. Then you'll find the tamale and elote station on the left, again, order directly from the lady if you have cash. Finally, all the way in the back is the register in which you order burritos. \nThe super burrito was great! I loved the carne asada, which was super flavorful! I also got a pork (or chicken, I forget) tamale. Yummms!\nThe elote on the other hand was a little disappointing. They use boiled corn instead of grilled corn, so it was very soggy. I also asked for extra chili, which made it a little too salty (well that's my fault).\nAdditionally, they had some amazing salsa.\nAs I mentioned earlier, you can order everything at the register if you are paying with a credit card. however, they don't give you a receipt or any kind of paper stating that you paid for everything, so when I went to the two stations to get my food, they looked at me weird, questioning if I have already paid. The lady at the elote station even asked someone to go to the register to double check that I paid...Well, let's say I wasn't very happy about that. Maybe they should change their system a little bit so they don't think I'm taking their food without paying.", "author": "Anna Y."}

That is an icredibly problematic sign for a gender-neutral bathroom, and when I sought out a management level person and told them my concern their response was since this wasn't their business there wasn't anything they could do.

I'm not sure if you can order without and get more of something else if you don't want beans/cheese but I didn't try asking.  That's my b on my part, but the rest of the plate wasn't very impressive anyways.  The carne asada was very thinly sliced and quite dry.  I think the only decent tasting items on the plate were the grilled green onions, shrimp, and mushrooms.  Everything else was just meh.\n\nIt seems to be a pretty popular place in the Mission... hyped if you ask me. I'll stick to the South Bay's Mexican, I've had better there.", "author": "Carena N."}

It's funny because they saw that their burritos were ready and waiting on the back counter but the cashier was shucking corn instead of bagging them up or calling them over. It was also excessively hot and smoky in the restaurant. Anyway, we got our food and went home to start the food / OITNB marathon. \n\nAs soon as I took my first bite, I got a distinct sensation of chewing on tin foil or plastic because of how rubbery the jalape\u00f1os were and much of the carne asada was bone dry. I actually spit it out to make sure I didn't accidentally bite some tin foil off. The girls' burritos were majorly lacking meat, though they had a fair amount of shrimp. One roommate is susceptible to spicy foods and rarely adds hot sauce to anything, was overwhelmed by how hot her burrito was and mostly suffered through it, though neither me or our other roommate had that issue. \n\nJust a bad day at Vallarta all around, which is sad because I usually get good food there.", "author": "Crystal C."}

There taco bar is also a fantastic way of bringing a traditional Mexican meal with a twist to people with a fun twist. \n\nThe food is prepared right in front of you (which is always good) and the freshness of the tomatoes, onions and salsa is refreshing for the palate. I've noticed all the different flavors of meat are juicy and the quality has always been top notch.

Check out the vegetarian selection! A bewildering variety of mariscos and plate offerings. \n\nAlthough we typically don't do burritos anymore, we couldn't resist the veggie burritos. Mainly because you may get one veggie burrito on a taqueria menu. If you're lucky. And that vegetarian selection may or may not throw in a few measly pieces of grilled or sauteed vegetables into their beans, rice, and cheese. (if you are vegan, the choices are even more meager). \n\nThis place had no less than six or seven veggie burrito choices. I went with a regular nopales burrito. No sour cream or cheese. My husband went with a super eggplant. Also no sour cream or cheese. We also ordered two super carne asada burritos, a side of rice, and a regular bean and cheese for the family. \n\nThe bag must have weighed 15 pounds. No joke. We debated while we walked all the way back to my sister's apartment exactly how much it must weigh. Greater than 12? (certainly felt like it), but definitely less than 20. My husband got an arm workout that day!  When we returned we pulled out the burritos. The super burritos each felt like they weighed at least 2 pounds. Even the regular were stuffed and were probably a good pound of food each. The side of rice wasn't a side. It was a full heaping box full. \n\nBut how was the taste? We had been so seriously disappointed in veggie burritos lately (a major reason why we have given up on burritos), these were delicious. A great balance of beans, rice, and veggies. Not just beans and rice. I had a taste of my sister's carne asada burrito and it was wickedly good (too rich for me). Meat was fantastic. Burritos were all rolled perfectly and toasted on the outside. We tried some of their hot sauces and they were excellent. Very spicy.

Wolfing down is not an inaccurate term, since your mouth is on fire in between bites and you have to keep eating until you're full.  Assuming you can eat it, I'd say the burrito was pretty solid.  There's Mexican food and good Mexican food, and Taqueria Vallarta belongs to the latter--Mexican food that makes you wonder why you once thought Chipotle was the best thing in the world.\n\nThe next day however, one of my other friends who also ate the spicy burrito ended up getting food poisoning... sigh, the dilemma that good Mexican places often seem to entail a health risk.

Whatever method you choose to do, definitely keep Taqueria Vallarta in mind as a choice.\n\nI've been to the Mission more than a couple times but I've never seen this place. My friend took me here because he says their quesadillas are delicious. He has good taste in food so I trusted him.\n\nI walked in and my first thought was, damn this place is huge. It has 10+ tables that looked like the wooden picnic tables in neighborhood parks. We walked to the front counter and placed an order for one Quesadilla De Castillito, which consists of your choice of meat, cheese, sour cream, avocado, tomatoes, and jalape\u00f1os (~$8). I also grabbed a few containers of sauces at the sauce bar: tomatillo, habanero, and chunky salsa. My favorite was the tomatillo sauce! Spicy and slightly sweet. The salsa had an odd (almost bitter) taste so I stopped eating it after one bite. And the habanero sauce fared the worst.... it was watery and had no flavor.\n\nI pretty much ate my share of the quesadilla with tomatillo sauce and it was heavenly. A side of fried tortilla chips would've been nice but alas, it's an additional 75 cents. Oh well, I saved money and calories!", "author": "Annie S."}

Yes, you read that right - there's a taco stand INSIDE the restaurant that functions almost independently from the rest of the joint. For just a couple bucks per taco, this place is a real bargain. \n\nThey offer up a ton of different meats but I stuck to three of my favorites - suedero, carne asada and al pastor. \n\nSUEDERO TACO ~ 3.5 stars: Suedero is typically fried thinly cut brisket. I've had it many times and a lot of places have screwed up on their take of suedero, however, I was very pleased with how TV's version turned out. Not my favorite but it was tender and pretty flavorful. \n\nCARNE ASADA TACO ~ 4 stars: Not kidding, TV's carne asada tacos are probably the best carne asada tacos I've had in the Bay Area. If I wasn't comparing them to some of the best ones I've had in SoCal, I'd automatically give this 5 stars. It's THAT good. \n\nAL PASTOR TACO ~ 4 stars: Almost the same story as the carne asada tacos except for the fact that I've had al pastor tacos just as good in the Bay. Check out Tacos Negris in Fremont - SO bomb! However, these are delicious. If you like al pastor, you won't go wrong with this.

Upon entering, you will find a taco stand with a sizzling meat wheel that you will make you want to faceplant into it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y00vIJzvt1Fveq_Um_9egw?select=D42OzAJCp8b898bYb_PU5w\n\nFor a mere $1.75, take your pick from over 8 kinds of meats. You can order the *yawn* standard carnitas or carne asada or be adventurous and order pancita (sheep stomach), tripas (beef stomach lining) or buche (pig's esophagus). RAWR!\n\nTell the taco man, your choice of meat(s) and watch him go into taco ninja action. He dips the tiny corn tortilla disks in water and warms it in the center of the meat wheel. When the slightly wet corn tortilla hits the sizzling meat wheel, it creates a steaming sensation making it soft and pliable. Topped with your choice of meat(s) and then a generous sprinkle of sweet caramelized onions, you are now ready to top your tacos to your liking. Cilantro, diced raw onions, radishes, lime wedges and three salsas; free feel to make it rain to your liking. \n\nMy two go-tos meats: \n\n*LENGUA TACO\n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y00vIJzvt1Fveq_Um_9egw?select=lGw1yDWttaliFJl9WC2FTw\nThe small chunks of lengua was boiled to a perfect soft tenderness with just enough seasoning to bring out all the beefy goodness. Very solid though my favorite is from La Taqueria and Mexico Tipico. \n\n*CABEZA TACO\n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y00vIJzvt1Fveq_Um_9egw?select=Zaos-rvxBHZiNKc8eClCJQ\nDon't let the word \"head\" deter you from trying one of the richest beefy meats out there.

The ordering process is a little inconvenient because if get tacos from the guy at the front, you have to take them to the counter inside to pay, and so you could find yourself standing in two long lines.  The breaded shrimp was decent, and the fried fish was surprisingly good - no overbearing fishy flavor or aroma, and no oily taste.  The shrimp and steak combination was a little disappointing, in that the meat was fairly tough though the flavor was pleasing.

That was in a past life, but they've cleaned up their act. They got shut down by the health dept for having a pigeon infestation, pigeons flying here and there, pigeons hovering and lusting over your al pastor, pigeons living in the grafts. But, really, who could blame em?? Those pigeons knew whats up. And, that's the tacos. No one really cared. We just gobbled the delicious meat, while shoo'ing the pigeons away. Go away, bird! Git away from my meat! GIT!! You wanna fight??!! I'll do it!! It's just THAT good. \n\nAll of these meats sit happy and sizzling around a circular grill and just merry their gluttonous goodness together. Tortillas get warmed with a quick sizzle in the middle of the grill, getting a taste of the meat's savory juices. Pick your meats, as they get topped with onion and cilantro, and ladle the salsa of your choice. \n\nSo, with all the mouth-watering, satiating meats, why the 3 stars you ask??\n\nIt's due to the GROUPON DEBACLE. \n\nOn a routine trip to get our taco fix, I recalled seeing a Groupon for Taqueria Vallarta. Heck yea, can't pass this deal up! Sitting in my car, parked right outside the restaurant, I hurriedly purchased the deal, like it was going out of style, thinking, oh, man, these tacos are going to taste all the better as I get $25 worth for only $12. Oh, the possibilities! SCORE!!!\n\nI walked in, ordered my tacos, and got in line to pay. In front of the register, was a sign that said Taqueria Vallarta was no longer accepting Groupons as of \"whatever date a week ago from that date.\" I thought, no way, I JUST purchased this. Literally, 5 minutes ago. We told the cashier, 6 tacos, and we have a Groupon. They pointed to the sign, \"Duh\", and said they were no longer honoring it. UGHH, what the heck!!!?? I JUST purchased it!! Why would Groupon have it up if they weren't going to honor it? They referred me to go back to Groupon for a refund. So, we tried calling AND emailing Groupon and, of course, got a response, saying, no, Vallarta is accepting it. Go back. They'll take it. They just started offering this as of 'whatever date Vallarta said they weren't accepting it\". Several weeks later, we go back to get our fix. And, guess what, no, they're not taking it. Read the sign. %&*#!!! \n\nSTUPID GROUPON and STUPID VALLARTA! Why would you sign up to offer it if you were no longer going to accept them?! $12 down the drain, which is not that big of a deal, but it's the principle. \n\nThus, concludes, why I went on strike and have not been to Vallarta since.

Their tacos are actually cheaper than El Farlito's and taste 10x better, which should give you every reason to come here! \n\nThis place has their own taco bar which is separate from the counter that makes the burritos. The taco bar also has your condiments ready right in front if the grill. Most taqueria places in the city put all the ingredients on your taco for you, with this place, you can put however much condiments you want, which is really nice because you can either be greedy with the salsa or really generous with it. \n\nTry this place!", "author": "Jason D."}

Like many simple dishes of humble origins, it is theoretically easy to execute but in practice it is usually not done well.  Taqueria Vallarta meets all the checklist items for a taco place\n\n  Small corn tortillas.  The need to be small so the resulting taco is not unwieldy and so that you can eat many tacos with a variety of fillings. \n  Many meat choices.\n  Fresh condiments: Lime, onion, cilantro, multiple salsas. The only thing it lacks is pickled carrots/onion\n\nThe only thing missing from an otherwise perfect place is the charcoal vertical rotisserie for al pastor.  But hard to imagine in SF.  It would also be great if they had Topo Chico. \n\nThere is more than just a taco bar so anyone that wants good mex can find something they like. I think they have some vegetarian items too.

Anyway, this place is the aces.  It passed multiple litmus tests on my end - tests so personal and subjective as to be ultimately meaningless to anyone that's not me, but you should really just take my word for it.  The horchata here is rich and creamy, and aptly accented in all of the right places.  The glorious taco stand posted out front, with numerous meat offerings and accoutrements for days, offers up some of the most delicious and authentic-tasting tacos I've ever had for just $2/pop.  The cabeza (beef head) and lengua (beef tongue) both make my spirit sing!  \n\n The pozole is also another shining star here.  The slow braised pork shoulder is melty, fall-off-the-bone, and gnarly fatty perfection - the way that pork is intended to be consumed.  Back when I had little reason to live and got blackout drunk every other day - this was truly one of my favorite hangover cures.\n\nHowever, I think one of my favorite things here (and really, not just from here - but like, of all time) is the \"San Francisco Plate.\"  It is a real monstrosity, like a 10-pound plate of grilled white fish and prawns and football-sized oysters, all seasoned with the most delicious red chili sauce and littered with fresh orange and avocado slices.  It is absurdly priced at $12.50, and probably one of the best deals in the city should you be craving some crayzay delicious seafood.

Also bought a queso tamale and ate it for breakfast the next day at work, it was really good with a  big slice of poblano tucked inside. With the meal I got the pina aguas fresca which was also housemade and really great. \n\nAlso, they had cool  SF/Jalisco themed murals and wide open seating area which was nice.

Somehow, they have found the right combo in everything they make for me. I had the super burrito w/ carne the first two times, and quesadilla deluxe (forgot the proper name, the one with tons of meat/shrimp in it) the third. The food is rich but not greasy, filling but not too heavy. Somehow...it got the balance of different ingredients, just right. Not too much of anything, but everything you want is there.\n\nAnd the spicy sauce. OMG THE ORANGE SPICY SAUCE!!!!! It is spicy. Like, real spicy. Like, super addictively good spicy. It makes everything 10X more tasty. The first time I was here they ran out of the sauce, and I still liked the food enough to come back.

First and foremost, the service I received was horrible. I am a very openminded person and don't get easily offended at restaurants. I felt the cashier person, who took my order, was rude and unprofessional. I felt like they didn't really want my business. FYI, this was before I said I had the groupon, so had nothing to do with groupon. \n\nThen ordered a carnitas taco. It came with literally just carnitas in a (soft) taco shell, even though it was supposed to come with all the other fixings. I never said \"no\" on the other fixings. The carnitas itself tasted decent, hence the \"two stars\" instead of just one star.\n\nThe super burrito was boring. The carne asada chewy. Couldn't find any guac/avocado even though it says it comes with it. I asked for black beans and got pinto. Don't even know if they offer black beans but they didn't say no when I ordered them and didn't get them.\n\nThe bathroom smelt semi decent, which I wasn't expecting given my overall experience. So this helped the 2 star rating. On the other hand, a drunkard walked in and left the door open while he urinated while I awaited my food. Not really complaining about this, since it can be expected given the positioning of this place where it is on Mission.\n\nI don't really want to come back for my other two 5 for $10 coupons. If I'm in the area I'll perhaps use it. Maybe. Only if I'm there, close, and really hungry.\n\nAgain, 2 stars for the carnitas being OK and not a nasty bathroom - and one more thing, I appreciate they have a salsa bar and gave me chips without extra cost.", "author": "Bret G."}

Stopped in during my trip to Humphry Slocombe around the corner, and the first thing that jumps out about the place is their taco bar...mainly because the line of people getting tacos blocks the door.  Since the taco bar sits literally next to the front door, you have to pass up the smell of grilled meats to get inside, and obviously the people in front of us just couldn't do it.  And neither did I.\n\nAt $1.50 a pop for \"street tacos\", these babies are definitely some budget friendly bites.  They have about a half dozen meats to choose from, and I went with a carne asada (a true test of tacos for me) and a chorizo taco to mix it up a bit.  The meat is flavorful and seasoned well, so you're not going to have to worry about some bland meat.  I was more impressed by the chorizo than the carne asada though - the beef was tasty but didn't stand out as much as the chorizo did compared to what I've had in the past.  Being street tacos, you literally get just the meat and the tortilla taco skins, but they have an assortment of sauces to drizzle on the meat as well as some other condiments.\n\nNow, I have no idea how any of their other items are (I saw a couple of families chowing down on some burritos), but it may not even matter for the future for me...I'll just stick with the tacos.", "author": "Mike L."}

And that's all you need to know.\n\nThey got a little taco stand right in front ready to slang out tacos in a hurry. My usual order(s) are suadero, carnitas, pollo asada, barbacoa. I tend to stay away from chicken (at least when I'm trying to enjoy my food) because it can be less tasty as... I don't know... some braised pork butt! but the pollo asada is exceptional here.

I've had their tacos particularly: carne asada, al pastor, and buche. The buche was good, although it could be seasoned a little more. The pastor wasn't like the pastor I've had at other places. The meat was extremely tender. Many other places I've been to had chunks of meat. ..But the clear winner was the carne asada. It is seasoned perfectly. It's the best I've had yet--both in NorCal and SoCal. I SO appreciate good, seasoned carne asada. Thank you Taqueria Vallarta for doin it right! When you've gotten your plate of tacos, the garnishes and such are right in front for you to pile on: limes, slice radish, onions (LOTS!), cilantro and three types of salsa. The only downside is that the tacos are $2. Pretty steep to me just because I'm used to paying for REALLY good tacos for 85 cents, but I don't mind the price enough to avoid eating here.\n\nI also tried their chicken tamale. That was good, not the best, but good. The masa is moist and blended together perfect so that you don't get the grainy aftertaste. The chicken could've been seasoned more, but that's nothing a little salsa couldn't fix. I want to go back and try their pork tamale though. I'm salivating just thinking about it.\n\nThe horchata was perfect blend of creaminess and cinnamon--a definite must-have.\n\nIf you have card, you have to pay at the back counter. ...And how awesome is it that they take card!?\n\nWhat I didn't like is that tortilla chips are a hit or miss. Some days with some ladies you'll get it for free.. Other days you'll get charged $1.

Having bought a 10 dollar Groupon to Taqueria Vallarta I found myself ordering a taco, and a burrito, and a horchata, because if I'm using a Groupon, I want to get my money's worth...Goddamnit!\n\nThe taco ($2) was outstanding. Being the sort of man who enjoys exotic meats, I ordered the cabeza (although I was disapointed to see that they didn't offer sesos, its been on my list of things to try for a couple of years now),  which was simply seasoned (pretty much only salt, as far as I could tell), warm off the grill and superbly tender, although a little on the fatty side. I now completely understand why cheeks are one of the most desirable cuts of meat for cannibals. Despite my newfound love of cabeza the highlight of this course was grilled onions that came as a side, vaguely translucent, they had a well carmalized, almost beefy flavor (no doubt from being on the same grill as some carne asada) while still having a snap that complimented the superbly grilled corn tortillas. Salsas were tasty, and the freeform style of the whole operation allowed for a ton of personalization. I'll definitely be coming back for more at some point in the near future.\n\nMy Zapata burrito ($7.25), on the other hand was unremarkable. Despite that the well sauced and tangy al Pastor (including tiny chunks of pineapple which added a welcome sweetness and balance to an otherwise salty meal) , other elements lagged hard. Sour cream was applied liberally (bringing slabwide temperatures down), avocado was minimal, and an otherwise outstanding vegetable compliment, anchored by some mighty fine marinated onions, was sabotaged by the inclusion of iceberg lettuce, the scourge of any decent slab. Cheese was well melted, and the whole pinto beans and rice were both good,although they never appeared in the same bite together. The tortilla was politely grilled, but not to the point where it could withstand a second half saucy onslaught leading me to use a few more napkins then I would have liked.  While the burritomaker in back didn't heed my request for extra-spicy with jalapenos, a liberal slathering of habenero mango salsa brought things up to speed, although I'd watch out for an overly liberal application, lest your forced to check your pallate into the burn ward at General. \n\nAmbiance includes a disturbingly charming mural of members of the 49ers frolicking in the waves, yellow and blue tables, a jukebox that apparently only plays Banda, and a bowling-alley-style claw machine filled with lonely and abused stuffed animals. You may end up sharing your meal with pigeons if you aren't careful.\n\nOverall: Go for the superb meats and outstanding tacos. While my burrito was certainly tasty, there were simply too many flaws for me to order another. 3.5 stars (rounded down to three because of the boneheaded inclusion of lettuce in my burrito [don't hate, I'm just a curmudgeon]) although subsequent visits may find me upgrading the rating to four solid stars as I work my way through their selection of dead animals wrapped in corn tortillas.\n\nP.S. Humphery Slocumbs is right around the corner. I definitely got a double scoop afterwards, although at the moment I sort of wish I hadn't (time to hit the gym!).", "author": "Casey U."}

I used to tailor make my quesadilla castillito to make it a bit more diet friendly, but take my advice and let this be your indulgence for the week. In any form the quesadilla still rocks, but the mastery of these flavor combinations should be respected and enjoyed as they were intended.\n\nThey've toned down the juke box decibal which used to be unbearable, so eating in is much more likeable than in the past; however, cleanliness could be better.

After the guy serves em up, add cilantro, onions, lime and salsa to taste. The green salsa's the best of the three. Also, sometimes the guy gives you grilled onions which are a nice bonus.\n\nIn the evenings, a lady sells tamales and corn in the other corner of the store. I tried her corn-on-the-cob last night, and it wasn't bad. She slathers mayo (I think) on it and then sprinkles on queso and paprika. It looked kinda nasty and unhealthy when she was prepping it, but it actually tasted alright.

One night, I decided to switch it up a little from El Metate and try something new. Something drew me to Taqueria Vallarta and I ordered a super shrimp burrito.

I ordered a Shrimp burrito and sat patiently to wait. A good 20 minutes had gone by, and I noticed that people behind  me, were getting their food before me. I asked the woman at the counter about my burrito. She just nodded, so I sat back down. It was getting late and I wanted to get home to avoid walking around too late at night, so after about 30 minutes of waiting for a simple burrito - I asked them again. I felt stupid just waiting for nearly a good half hour for a burrito. This would  never have happened at El-Metate. I mean I can eat a whole burrito in 5 minutes!\r\n\r\n One of the cooks chuckled in the background, and I knew they'd forgotten my order. They didn't even apologize, but just hurriedly said it was coming.  So I finally got my burrito 40 minutes later after I had ordered it. No apology - no nothing, and I'd even tipped pretty  well beforehand.  It was a horrible night altogether: so stressed, tired and hungry - I took my burrito home - only to take one big bite of my burrito and spit it out. It was shrimp (fishy tasting at that) mixed with beef, and other random things that had been on the grill, when they were cooking my food. I threw it away quickly.

However, this place as a whole leaves a lot to be desired, especially insofar as customer service.  While I've experienced worse treatment by food servers before, the people who work at Vallarta are definitely in need of some training on how to better treat their customers.  When my friend asked for a carnitas burrito one time, the woman at the register brusquely told him they were out of carnitas and then attempted to forcibly ring him up for a carne asada burrito without even asking him if that's what he wanted instead! Then there's the tamale vendor out front who, while has treated me decently, I have observed being pretty rude to other customers. \n\nAs far as the food itself; while the tacos are good for the most part, their al pastor meat isn't the best quality. Most of the pork in the tacos al pastor that I ordered consisted of blubbery fat, not appetizing at all.  When I made the mistake of ordering chicken enchiladas one time, even worse: instead of filling the enchiladas with actual chicken meat, they had used the worst chicken parts imaginable.  My enchiladas literally had such disgusting parts as pieces of skin and cartilage-looking things that seemed to be leg joints!  And don't even get me started on the pozole; it consisted of mostly bones, a couple of large chunks of cartilage or something, and a few pieces of actual pork meat.  Without a doubt, the worst pozole I've ever had bar none! \n\nIf you decide to eat at Vallarta, stick to the carne asada tacos, which is one of the few good entrees at this place.  Another redeeming quality here is that the green salsa that's kept in the stone molcajete is without a doubt the best salsa in the Mission. The horchata is good, but then again the horchata is good at most Mexican restaurants.  All in all, Vallarta is a pretty unsatisfactory taqueria.", "author": "Tito The Incognito .."}

You just need the discipline to split it into 2 meals.  \n\nI've been there over a dozen times for lunch, and a handful for dinner, and only once have i had a noticeably substandard burrito.  The salsa bar is minimal, but the 3 types offer a decent range, and the chips are fresh and warm every time I'm there.  \n\nAnd this review doesn't even address the taco stand, which most agree is better than the burritos.  \n\nOne other point; they make seafood items, if you are brave, and the payoff is pretty good.  The tostada de ceviche is good for a modest charge, and they offer more authentic dishes like soups and full dinner plates.", "author": "Christian W."}

It's straight to the point, quick and soooooo awesome-sauce good. You can swing up to the counter to get a 50cent bag of fresh tortilla chips and (I would stick to a small, diabetes ain't cute) cup of overly sweet  fresh cantaloupe juice. \n\nI had the al pastor and barbacoa taco. Just lovely. I should have ordered 6, instead I stuck to two and ate them waaaay too fast. I don't remember if I got salsa....I think I did. But salsas don't make the taco.

Or a tamale by its husk?\n\nI walk by Vallarta almost every day and almost invariably every day am dissuaded by the state of the storefront and even more so by the dimly lit interior and barren interior. Let's be honest: Vallarta looks like a dump.\n\nBut, after reading rave reviews about their tacos, I bucked up and dropped in for a feast. By hell, high water, or food poisoning, I would have a verdict on this place. I ordered the chicken enchilada and shrimp plate with a side order of two tacos. I chose chicken and shrimp because those are real gauges of a cook's abilities: cooked too long and both are stringy and tough, cooked too short and both are down right inedible. When the plate arrived with all of its goodness, the shrimp looked slightly burnt and the chicken enchilada looked stale. I was disappointed. That is, until my first bite. Damn my expectations and my prejudices, because the food was amazing. I was blown back at how supple and succulent everything tasted. The shrimp was just right so that it had a nice bite and was seasoned just well enough to keep the flavors together. The chicken enchilada was superb as well; the chicken was moist and the sauce was just balanced between the sweetness and bitterness that you should be getting. My only complaint was the fatty vein through the chicken, but I had no problem picking it out. Anyways, props to you, Vallarta, for converting me and making me a believer. I will definitely be back for more.\n\nAs for the tacos, well, all of us Yelpers can't be wrong, right? Vallarta has perfected the street taco so no need to sing more praise.

I get the tacos when I go here, they are $1.75 each and are really good and quick. You get 2 mini tortillas and a pile of meat then you can put onions, cilantro, salsa or radishes on top. The grilled chicken is my fav. the carne asada is a little hit and miss, one time it was under seasoned and another time it was over seasoned. The carnitas is standard, the barbacoa is really tender and pulled which is yummy but it gets stuck in your teeth. My husband liked the lengua. They have several other meats to choose too. My complaint is there is only one guy doing tacos with a really small surface to warm tortillas so it can take a little longer than necessary esp if there is a line. During certain times, there is a lady on the other side of the restaurant selling Mexican style corn on the cob with cotija and chile. I have yet to try that but I really want to. I think she might sell Atol de elote too over there. So when Casa Sanchez is really busy or you don't feel like spending much, grab a few tacos here. Oh, one other downside is they charge $.50 for chips and they are usually too done (a little burnt and bitter) and the salsa is just ok.

After searching high and low for authentic tacos in Australia, I really came to miss the Mission taquer\u00edas I love so much. . . Now having said that, one night recently I could not decide which of my tried and true to hit up.  My lil bro's girlfriend just came in from work and I asked her opinion.  She directed me to Taquer\u00eda Vallarta, making mention of some special contraption and taco man serving to you en vivo.  I was pleased to arrive minutes later and discover that the prices weren't bad either.\n\nThe line of 5-6 people out the door may have been enough to scare off the less hungry skeptics. It was refreshing to see so many Latinos at one time and ordering their food in Spanish (give me a break I still can't get the Aussie accent outta my head). I settled for four tacos al pastor (pork) and felt my mouth prepare itself as I slathered them with salsa, onions and cilantro.  My friends those four tacos were GONE in four minutes! I had to leap out of my chair to get a good spot back in line for four more! Yes, I have been gone too long.\n\nWhat I can tell you about the flavor is that the meat was spiced gorgeously, the tortillas sufficiently warmed and salsa recipe was incredible. It melted in my mouth and I did not care that it warmed my belly a bit too. I had an horchata, as you do, to assist in the cooling of this symptom.

These little gems are to die for they are cooked with the oils from the meats. All tacos are made to order, the barboca dude dips about a third the corn tortillas in oil, and then toasts them on the giant donut pan.

Most of them are positive.  Kind of like the feelings one harbors about a retarded puppy.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when walking in, besides the line around the corner during the evenings, was that pigeons were expediently cleaning anything that fell on the floor.  They were being polite and human-like!  I'm not sure how I feel about a place that is comfortable with the perpetual and ominous presence of pigeons within the establishment.  Its actually kind of awesome.  My friends and I affectionately call this place \"The Pigeon Palace\" as a result.\n\nNext up, the food and pricing are ridiculous.  Great food.  $1.50 tacos.  I mean, c'mon.  A man who will make little to no eye contact with you will season and prepare tacos for you all night for less than what you can purchase at fast food joints.  I tried the carne asada, carnitas, beef tips, and my favorite - el pollo asado, and it was all amazing.  Greasy, sure.  But awesome.  There's a giant menu in the back of the store with all kinds of stuff and a soup lady, but why even bother?  The tacos are amazing enough.  Still, a filling meal requires about 3-4 tacos.  When you do the math it works out, but grease-per-value-per-inch you can probably eat better at Metate or Farolito.  \n\nPro tip:  Ask for a Mexican Coca Cola with your meal.  They bottle it without High Fructose Corn Syrup -- it tastes completely different.  Drink it under the virgin mary statue in the center of the restaurant then lean back and stuff your face while reading the wall-to-ceiling murals about the history of San Francisco as it pertains to the Mexican people.", "author": "niero g."}

There is a guacamole-like sauce in the back past the register.\n- Very authentic and plenty of meats to choose from (lots of Mexican families eat tacos here so that is a good sign).\n- My favs are the buche (pork stomach) and the al pastor but everything is pretty good (even the cabeza). The meats are full of flavor here.\n\nBAD:\n- Like most taquerias, this place is a divey hole in the wall so don't take your first date here unless she is totally chill with the zero ambiance.\n- The taco stand can get overrun sometimes so sometimes there is a good 15-20 minute wait.\n- Parking can be a pain in the butt around here after 6PM but there are plenty of metered spots during the day.\n- The tacos are super greasy because they grill the meats in their own juices. Many other places just stew/boil their meats, which is less greasy but also less flavorful. A small price to pay for the best tacos around.\n- No fish taco option (not that I remember anyway).\n\nCONCLUSION: One of the best taquerias in SF, and the best one I have found thus far.

I went for the super burrito al pastor (marinated pork), which comes with avocado, cheese, hot salsa (mild is not an option), and onions.  It's not as large as other super burritos I've seen, but the right size for all you body-conscious people out there.  The flavors were good, but I wish the avocado and cheese were more evenly distributed throughout the whole burrito.  Came here on another visit to try the taco bar.  At $1.50 a taco, it's a pretty good deal.  It's essentially your choice of meat on two corn tortillas with a couple of grilled onions on the side.  You can also add your own amount of cilantro, diced onions, and salsa.  I also tried an horchata and loved it.\n\nService:  3 stars.  I stood at the counter for about five minutes before someone came over to take my order.  At least they were quick with the food preparation and tolerated my valiant but sad attempt to order in Spanish.  \n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.

Even more delicious, the ginormous cobs of corn they serve with chile and salt. If you're thirsty grab a splash of beer or a glass bottle of coke.\r\n\r\nOnce, a friend and I were walking up 24th St., having just left a vegan BBQ. She gasped as she saw the impressive Vallarta grill out on the sidewalk across the street. \"What?\", I asked her. \"Do you want to get some tacos to counteract all the tofu we just ate?\", said she.

Trying to get out of the area before the mad rush of hungry drunks, we hurriedly hailed a cab and got dropped off right before the Taqueria Vallarta.  \n\nThe restaurant features an interesting set up where it's like a taco truck, but you know, without the truck.  There's a guy behind a plastic sneeze guard manning a grill, which features a full view of a bunch of different meats and tortillas cooking away.  I ultimately decided on one carne asada and one lengua taco.  While the asada was alright, the lengua was fantastic.  Tender, succulent, and plentiful, the lengua was probably the best I've had yet.  So if you're into that kind of stuff, DO indulge.  And at 1.50 a taco, talk about a deal.  \n\nAnother honorable mention goes to the selection of beverages.  The horchata was on point, not gritty or too sweet.  Also, it was served to me in a red plastic Solo cup, which allowed me to keep the party going.  J got an apple soda in a glass bottle, and that was extra fizzy and  delightfully refreshing.\n\nI finished off my two tacos quickly and swiftly, and was already pretty full.  Yet, I longed for another lengua anyway.  Being the awesome friend that she is, J encouraged me to have another and eventually got up to get one for me.  I disappointed myself by not being able to finish the whole thing, leaving a single bite left, but I still made Mama J proud.  She won't touch that shit even though she's a brown sister herself.", "author": "Karen T."}

It was indeed the case before, but never again...at least not at Taqueria Vallarta!\n\nSo far removed from the chain restaurant Mexican that I grew up eating (and hating), the tacos here are flavorful, fresh, and memorable. And this is before you even get to the salsa, which are good enough to pack up and bring home for later. $1.50 per taco makes a very happy wallet. For the price of my morning coffee, I could enjoy an entire meal here.\n\nThe burritos are superb as well...and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like massive amounts of rice or cheese. One of my biggest complaints about burritos previously was that they cannot be eaten the next day since the tortilla turns rock hard. But again, most of my burrito-eating experiences came from places called Moe's or Willy's, chains that did not an ounce of justice to their fellow amigos. The texture of the burritos here is just right, and yes, they are still good for reheating later (just be sure to remove the aluminum foil before microwaving).\n\nIn terms of decor, I like the wall murals quite a lot--especially since it tells a meaningful story. For a place to have their entire set of walls and ceilings painted this way, it shows that they put some serious thought into this. Also well-lit and spacious, which removes some level of suspicion about restaurants who turn down the light to mask the grime. I'm not saying it's completely pest-free. I'm just saying it makes me wonder a bit less.\n\nI can't take a Mexico vacation on a whim, but I can get a taste of it at 24th and Treat any day of the week. Now that's a trip I can afford to take time off for.", "author": "Rona J."}

They are fantastic: full-flavored, fresh, and affordable ($1.50). They dip about a third of the corn tortillas in oil, and then toast them on the giant barbacoa pan. The result is an piping hot tortilla. Meanwhile, the meats simmering around the edge of the pan --carnitas, beef, chicken, and chorizo-- are soaking in their own (and probably each others) juices, making them wonderfully oily and flavorful. Sweet roasted onions are also provided along with each taco. The server will combine these ingredients for you on a plate. On top of this tremendous combination you get to pile on fresh onion, cilantro, and salsa to your heart's content.... Fantastic. Don't forget the radish to clear your pallette, or just for something to crunch on.\n\nAs already mentioned, this place is open pretty late, so bring your friends on the weekend during a night out.

The place was packed with everyone from bums to urban pioneering yuppies to the latino regulars to self conscious hipsters, all drinking beer and enjoying the game together. Tell me that that would ever happen at Cancun, and I'll agree that it's the best taqueria in the city. The experience was emblematic of why I like living in this neighborhood.

I can't say we have tried much beyond the tacos - but they are as good as they get. There is literally a taco cart with a comal (the funny upside down wok thingy for cooking the meat/keeping it hot) at the front door. Tacos are a buck fifty, and loaded with meat. And, they have 6 different kinds of fresh salsa and all the other goodies. We drive accross town for these tacos. Very rewarding.", "author": "Katie K."}

Somehow, this place is moving from a FULL FIVE STARS to ONE (I wish I could give them NONE, at this point) over the course of a few months.\n\nThe service here SUCKS. When I first started coming here, the lady that worked was awesome. Since then, a dumber-than-bricks girl with heavy, dark, unmatching lip-liner has taken control....and she ALWAYS GETS IT WRONG.\n\nMy first run-in with her: \"Can I have vegetarians super nachos, without cheese?\"\n\n\"Uh, *something to the back*, uh, yeah.\"\n\nThen nothing. She doesn't ring them up; just stares blankly. I watch her write the ticket to go (even though I asked to dine-in). The nachos come with cheese; luckily, I'm okay with that.\n\nSecond time: I go in, ask for my usual (yes, I went here a lot): a veggie taco with no cheese. It's ALWAYS $1.90, and somehow she manages to make the total $2.14. I tell her that's wrong as I'm a regular here. She tells me that \"no, that's right.\" All I brought was $2 with me because I've been here THAT MUCH. After I tell her (again) she's wrong, she checked with someone and they okay it. She rings it up and walks away. No chips! She omitted my chips! I always get chips. So, I wait, ask for chips, and she practically throws them at me. She brings out my taco, and the avocado and sour cream that I come for are completely gone from the taco. In fact, it's just beans and lettuce...not even any rice....and it sucked. There was no flavor. UGH, what happened to the tacos I loved!?!?\n\nLast night: I decided to give them one last shot. I come in wanting a burrito, so I decided to try the BURRITO GRILL they have advertised on a hand-written sign above the register. It says it's $4.25 for a regular and $5.50 for a super. I ask for the regular with no cheese and black beans. She rings up $4.30 for the burrito (ugh, that thick?) and the total comes to $4.87. I have my debit card, and she says, \"Do you want anything to drink?\" and I say, \"no\" and she says it has to be a $5 minimum. I ask if I can just tip her, and she says, \"$5 minimum.\" Okay, fine...I made it a SUPER burrito. I watch her change the ticket. She rings it up, the total becoming $5.97. I tip three cents on the card and throw some change into the tip jar. She smiles and thanks me. My burrito is done in less than 5 minutes and I take it home. !&@%^#*@^#&*@&# It's a REGULAR burrito. There is NO sour cream or avocado to be found in this thing. OH, and to top it off: I checked my bank statement later on, and they charge me $7.68 for the thing. ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL!??! \n\nI will NEVER go back. It's a shame, because I really was the definition of a regular. My first review for them on here was beautiful. Five stars. Then, the service went to hell. \n\nDon't go.\n\nThey don't care about customers at all. And let it stay that way...their food's crappy anyway.", "author": "Danyell K."}

So many delicious kinds of meat, tortillas grilled to order on a rounded comal (the sexiest of cooking implements for sure), as much onion/cilantro/salsa, among other fixins, as you want or can stand, mmmmm. My go-to order: two carnitas (soooo juicy and good!) and one lengua, all smothered in raw onions and absolutely dripping in lime juice. Always always always excellent.\nAaaand they're open late! The best tacos in SF, a city which rolls up its sidewalks depressingly early at 10pm, are available until at least one in the morning. I have no idea what Vallarta's hours actually are, since whenever I need my taco fix, they seem to be open and waiting for me! I don't think they're 24/7, but it seems to be pretty close. Did I mention the awesome price? $1.75 per delicious taco. As your typical broke college student, this place is right up my alley. (By the way, take a stroll down Balmy Alley, the mini-street on the east side of Vallarta, and check out the awesome murals.)\nI've never even gotten to their menu, the taco bar always derails me, but having stolen bites of friends' burritos... go for the seafood! The shrimp in a creamy, mildly spicy (but oh how it builds over time) sauce with all your usual Mission burrito goodness has almost drawn me away from my taco bar-loving ways.\nOh, and I know this isn't Vallarta-specific, but if you're not grabbing a beer from the cold case, shove a lime wedge in a bottle of Sangria Senorial, a carbonated, non-alcoholic sangria, for the perfect accompaniment to your meal. It's such an overlooked drink in the face of Jarritos and it deserves a lot more love.\nYeah, this has turned into a total rave, and I know every San Franciscan has their favorite taqueria, but if Vallarta's tacos don't steal your heart, then I'm afraid you might not have one.", "author": "Juliette J."}

I'm a fan.", "author": "Brooks R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-02", "description": "Dude, where's my taco?\nTaqueria Vallarta!\nMmm biddy biddy num nums!\n\nThe above is an almost perfect taku* for an almost perfect taco. I really, really, REALLY wanted to give Taqueria Vallarta a rating of \u00a1Oh Dios Mios! ^_^, but I couldn't... I just couldn't.\n\nIt makes me wonder: can a taco so close to perfection, so damn delicious, really be topped? Is there even such a thing as a perfect taco? I don't know. I just... don't... know!!!#@%@#$^\n\nOkay--so what exactly is it that makes Taqueria Vallarta's tacos so tasty? Is it the pool of greasy goodness that the carne asada swim in? Or is it the taco man's mad taco skillz? Perhaps it's both. But I've done some extensive specimen analysis and self-observational studies and have come to the conclusion that Taqueria Vallarta tacos contain traceable amounts of methylbenzoylecgonine, otherwise known as crack. One should proceed with extreme caution when consuming these tacos, because along with being highly addictive, these tacos are cheap--only $1.50 a hit! The tacos also come from a taco stand placed near the front of the taqueria, thus allowing you to quickly and conveniently pay the dealer then proceed to your fix.\n\nOkay--but seriously--these tacos are legit. Firstly, the meat is quality--just take a couple bites and you'll taste the difference. Along with great quality comes great flavor, and Vallarta fully fills their carne asada with TONS of it. The crack marinade coupled with the grease bath creates a taste to the tongue unparalleled to any taco I've come upon in The Mission thus far. You could almost eat the taco sans salsa roja--but I wouldn't recommend it, for the salsa roja here in unreal.\n\nThere's something very unique with what they do to the red sauce. It has this kind of smokey flavor that goes really well with the meat. Try it with just a chip and you'll see what I'm talking about. Please note that on the taco stand, there are three kinds of salsas: the orange one blows; the dark red one should go on the carne asada taco (obvi!); and if you are in the mood to try a pollo asada taco, the green one goes well with it. Also, you can top your taco with as much onion and cilantro as you want. Can't go wrong with that. And don't forget to grab some of the grilled onions. When the tacoman asks, \"\u00bfSea-boy-ah?\", you say \"Sea!\" The grilled onions, along with the radishes, are a damn good addition to the taco. Just try it: take a bite of taco, then immediately take a bite of radish wrapped with the grilled onion--it's biddy biddy num nums!\n\nSo if the meat and the salsa roja are so super sabrosa, why did this taco not receive an \u00a1Oh Dios Mios! ^_^? They FUCKED up the tortillas! God dammit! Vallarta excels in all the difficult areas of taco construction, but they eff up on what I think is the easiest part to master: corn tortillas! It really is a bummer, because like I said, the tacos are almost perfect. Basically, the corn tortillas lack that burst of corn flavor, and the tortillas weren't grilled long enough. The result was that the juice from the carne asada dampens the tortilla and makes for a kind of soft texture. This is a no-no.\n\nBut, despite the corn tortilla mishap, the tacos still tasted amazing. Taqueria Vallarta tacos are \u00a1Que Bueno! :P -- I would come back here in a heartbeat. In fact ::itches tongue erratically:: I needz meh some tacos orita, way!!!\n\n-The Taco Guru\n\n\n\n*a taku, pronounced \\t\u00e4-()k\u00fc\\, is a haiku tailored towards tacos.\n\nPlease note that my rating for Taqueria Vallarta is solely based on the tacos--it is in no way a reflection of the atmosphere or other food that it has to offer. My mission is to review every taqueria based in The Mission. See chapter 1 and 2 of my blog (url located in my profile) for more information about my rating system and the kind of taco I review.", "author": "Taco G."}

They have different varieties of meat and I like the self-serve containers of limes, radishes, onion, cilantro and sauces so you can customize your taco condiments too.

I wondered why this place had a line all the way outside the door and onto the sidewalk. So I stood in line and ordered some Carne Asada tacos ... they were soooo good. Loved the salsa selections.  Only bad part was that a few pigeons had wandered into the seating area of the restaurant. I guess they heard about the great food too!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-14", "description": "Yes, this place is a bit of a \"dive\" if you're unaccustomed to rustic taquerias or prefer antiseptic dining environments, but if what you want is authentic Mexican flavor, this is the spot in The Mission. I started out here with carne asada burritos. I was instantly convinced that they were the best I'd had in the Mission yet ... the meat was even more flavorful than at La Taqueria on Mission, which is famously good as well. As other reviewers have indicated, though, the real star of this restaurant is the barbacoa, which you'll find on the street if the weather is good, or inside if not. I love the lengua y asada tacos from the barbacoa. Amazingly intense flavor, enhanced by the condiments and great salsas provided. As a lifelong San Franciscan, I'm very fond of many of our excellent Mission taquerias. As an ardent Mexiphile, I love this restaurant for its true *Mexicanidad.* Vallarta is one of 24th Street's Latin treasures.", "author": "Dean E."}

Didnt heat up my carnitas it was sitting in the serving vat probably all day then threw it in my burrito.  Plus serving size was misleading.  Didnt throw in much meat it was all filler rice and beans.  Salsas werent very good.  I have been to alot of mexican restaurants in san francisco and this was my least favorite.  That is saying alot because I love mexican food and this was even worse than papalote which doesnt even serve carnitas which is pathetic.  I mean I have probably been to at least 20 different mexican restaurants and taquerias in San Francisco and this one was the worst.", "author": "christian l."}
