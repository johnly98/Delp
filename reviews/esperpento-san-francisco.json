I came at night on a weekend, and boy was this place rowdy (perhaps too much so). It honestly felt like bar vibes--it was hard to hold a conversation with my friends over the consistently loud chatter of other tables. There was also live music, with two musicians rotating around the tables playing songs, which contributed to the noisy sounds. \n\nOn the bright side, the food was fairly good and super cheap. I opted for a meat platter along with several tapas, including fried cod, asparagus, cabbage, and calamari. The meat from the meat platter (chicken, carne asada, etc) was unfortunately very dry and hard to chew. The potatoes that formed the base of the dish, however, were delicious and well flavored. The tapas were all very good, with the fried cod especially standing out, as it pairs deliciously with the spinach sauce it comes from. \n\nThe sangria is a must order drink! Delicious and lightly fruity. Definitely explains why the atmosphere here is so lively. Grab a single drinkf or $5 or a pitcher for $19--the prices are even more reasonable during happy hour.", "author": "Karen Y."}

We didn't even check reviews before walking in, but no regrets. We had their lobster paella and some sangrias. Lobster tasted fresh and sweet, paella was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Portion was more than enough for 2 people (we had leftovers), but were also tiny people who don't eat much, haha. The lobster portion was also very generous for the price I'd say. \n\nIt would be a nice place for a date, but it does get very loud in there.

It's one of the few places that I never get tired of and am happy to keep coming back to. \n\nThe place is compact but they're able to accommodate parties of up to 20 people in their private room or upper level. \nThe place is tastefully decorated in a Flamenco theme and a large poster of none other than Penelope Cruz in Volver by Almodovar. The best of modern Spanish cinema. \n\nYou always get a basket of bread and butter to start with. That alone is so comforting and good. I usually go through about 2 baskets per meal. \n\nDuring happy hour, you get a great deal on their awesome pitchers of Sangria. Tastes like juice but you get a nice buzz after one glass. \n\nThere are so many great appetizers (tapas) to choose from. I usually get the grilled asparagus w lemon cream, grilled garlic mushrooms, garlic prawns, little Spanish chorizos, crunchy cabbage, and the creamy spicy potatoes (patatas bravas). \n\nIf you've got time and an appetite, order a Paella. It's a saffron rice casserole topped with different meats or vegetables enough for 2-8 people depending on the size. It takes about 30 minutes to make. \n\nMy favorite one is the Matanzas which has chicken, pork, and sausage. Served with a lemon wedge- squeeze it over the paella for an extra kick.\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can have the seafood paella with shrimp, calamari, mussels, and even lobster tails for an extra charge. \nIt's so good, you'll want to scrape off the last bit of rice stuck to the pan. \n\nTry the traditional Spanish dessert- Crema Catalana. It's similar to a Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  \n\nAfter ordering all that food and drink, you'll be amazed at how little you'll pay per person compared to other restaurants in the area. \n\nOnce in a while, you may get treated to live music by a solo mariachi singer with a guitar and a nice pair of lungs that fills the entire restaurant with his Mexican Rancheras. Feel free to tip him as he passes by your table. \n\nCall ahead for reservations.", "author": "Mitzi G."}

Got the seafood paella.\n\nAlso got some tapas: jamon iberico + rabbit stew + garlic shrimp and sangria\n\nWill start with the tapas. The jamon iberico was very low quality (comparing to what I had in spain so I might be a bit spoiled). You get only a couple of cuts and it was just ok. It's not really fatty and much more salty than others ones I've had. The rabbit stew was pretty standard I thought, some decent homey flavor, nothing special though. The garlic shrimp was probably my favorite tapa. Considering I like both garlic and shrimp, it was expected. I liked dipping the bread into that sauce. (They give you bread with the spicy mayo sauce that is usually dripped on patatas bravas).\n\nThe paella, wow....so disappointing. There wasn't much flavor, the texture wasn't right. The seafood was small. There was no crust in the paella, normally there are some mildly burnt pieces but here it had none. The other rice just seemed to be very soggy and somehow still not full of flavor. The shrimp was also really tiny and therefore a bit more dry (didn't even finish the seafood in the paella).\n\nSangria also didn't seem like it was fruity enough so not sure how long it was marinated for.", "author": "Victor D."}

The ambiance has a southwestern vibe.  Servers have remained the same throughout the years.  They will recognize you if you frequent this place....they really will so be careful on who you come with!  Music can be heard overhead but have to decipher in between the noisy acoustic chatter.  In the evening a 2 to 3 person mariachi band comes around and you donate whatever amount you wish into a sombrero. Although one time to sing Feliz compleanos they had the audacity to ask for $10.00. Price at this place is fairly modest and actually competitive for SF dining.  Parking of course is a hit and miss - SF parking, grab it if you see it.  Happy Hour is until 7 PM every day for their killer sangria at 10 buckaroos which is the reason to come early!  Suggestions:  for seafood lovers the Seafood platter best deal and best dish.  For tapas:  patatas brava, garlic chicken, meatball abondigas, mussles, asparagus, mushrooms, tortilla de patatas.  Paellas are also very good.  Should you want your own dish you can have that too.

When we arrived, the main dining area was full, so we were asked whether we would rather sit upstairs or in the \"private dining area.\"  We chose the private dining area- hey, they made the suggestion, so why not take them up on it!\n\nAfter choosing what we wanted and waiting for about 15 minutes, we finally got up and went to the main part of the restaurant (which you  need to exit to the street to access) to remind the hostess that we were there and waiting to order.  She was very gracious, apologetic, and sent someone over right away.\n\nThroughout the rest of the night, we had to get up a couple more times to remind the hostess or our waitress that we wanted to order more, which was annoying, but understandable as it's easy to forget about tables that aren't in your line of sight.\n\nWhat make this a one star review, is \n1) the waitress was EXTREMELY HOSTILE towards us.  She started off friendly, but maybe she felt like we weren't ordering enough food, or maybe she resented that she had to come over to the private dining area, and her tone and body language got more aggressive and rude as the night went on.  This made us very uncomfortable.\n2) with all that in mind, we left a pretty bad tip- the total check came out to around $83, and we left $10 extra.  (We normally leave 20%, but the combination of the waitresses hostility and needing to track her down multiple times throughout the night made us decide to leave an amount that reflected the service.)  When I saw my bank statement today, the restaurant charged me $8 more than what the total bill came to, which was most likely added to the tip.\n\nGuests beware, and be sure to keep your receipts.", "author": "Emma A."}

The chicken melts in your mouth. Kids loved it. Of course being kids they wanted French fries, so the closest thing we could find were potatoes. They were excellent potatoes!

Since they claim they are small plates, I usually order a butt load and don't feel bad eating that much b/c they are small plates/tapas. But in reality, you really end up eating a lot, getting drunk, and not even spending that much $$$ for what you get! \n\nAll the tapas range from 5-7 dollars and can be shared between a big group. They aren't the biggest portions, but you should be good with getting 1-2 plates (per every person in your table) and a paella to share. When ordering paella, their serving can feed twice the amount of people it is designated for. For example: a serving for 2 can serve 4 people and a serving for 4 can serve 6-8 unless you are super hungry or just order the paella.\n\nHere are some dish suggestions: \nGambas al Ajilo: Very tasty garlic sauce and the shrimp is so moist and flavorful. \nPatatas Bravas: Potatoes are well cooked and seasoned. \nRopa Viejo: The sauce could use a little more chorizo flavor, but the meat is on point. \nArtichokes: Very crispy and thinly sliced artichoke dish! Nothing special, but good veggie dish.\nFor Paella, the negro is super tasty but might not be for all people as the flavor is super distinct. And the paella de mariscos (which I usually get) is packed with seafood. If you want lobster, it's a little more expensive, but heard it's worth it! It is not the best paella but it is decent! \nAND DON'T FORGET THE SANGRIA : 17 FOR A PITCHER? SOLD! small fruit is a plus :)\n\nThe Jamon Serrano isn't that great, they already serve bread with their garlic sauce in the first place. Also, Their seating process is a little disorganized and it can take them a while to seat people even if there is space. You have to be super pro active with one of the hosts to make sure you get seated at the proper time. With the occasional guitar performance and Spanish singing paired with the wonderful ambiance, this place is a great gem in the city! Great for big groups and family, and just to get drunk and full!", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

We ordered about 4 plates of tapas, quest manchego, patatas bravas which was delicious, almejas a la plancha clams that left me drooling and another meat dish I cannot remember because I unfortunately didn't get to try it.

Yummmmm\n\nI wanted to check this place out for the sole purpose of trying out the Arroz Negro, I'm a fan of squid ink dishes and this place did not disappoint. $4.50 Sangrias, $5-$10 tapas including calamari, Patatas Bravas, grilled asparagus etc.\n\nThe only downside I experienced is when the bill came. The total included a hand written gratuity on the receipt. I repeat, it was handwritten, when everything else was printed. First reaction, oh hell nah! Hahaha I don't mind paying gratuity, even if the norm is 6or more people, yet there was only 5 of us. I brought it to their attention and asked for them to either take it out or include that in my bill as a printed item on a receipt. They came back and it was removed.

However, I didn't appreciate being disrupted during my meal to pay money for the bandolero multiple times.  It's great that he plays music inside and outside of the restaurant, but to tap me on the shoulder and put your hat for donations was a little too much.  \n\nWhile the food is good, the service is on the slow side.  During my last visit with a party of 4.  We all ordered water and 1 coke.  10-15 minutes later, we all got our water and no coke.  We had to get up and ask about the coke.\n\nWe ordered the blood sausage (can't remember actual name), garlic shrimp, patatas bravas and the lobster paella.  The complimentary bread with their signature sauce is really good.  They use the same sauce with their patatas bravas and it's amazing.  The lobster paella takes a long time to prepare so be sure to wait at least 30 minutes.  Don't expect a lot of lobster.  For a party of 4, each person gets half of a tail so in total, it's 2 lobster tails cut in half for 4 people.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered their version of the creme brule.  I probably wouldn't order this again because the texture was a little weird to me and it wasn't that great.  \n\nOverall, the food is good and being with good company makes it better.  I think this restaurant would be perfect if the service was more on point and if I wasn't disrupted to pay the guitar guy.", "author": "Rachel L."}

I'm usually off on Sunday and Monday when they are closed. Today I was walking around and noticed it was open. I stopped and looked inside and noticed 3 tables were occupied. Took a look a the menu posted on the window. Items on the menu sounded nice and reasonable too.  I  walked away but decided to go back and take advantage that was open.  I went in and was greeted a nice woman that said that they were closed but she will accommodate  me. I didn't realize they close at 3 pm. (reopens at 5 pm for dinner). I got there a few minutes after three.  Talk about customer service, I was impressed.  I was given the menu along with a basket of small wedges of fresh sour dough bread. It came with small soft butter containers, not the usual cold and hard ones.  I ordered the grilled snapper with a salad and spinach b\u00e9chamel.  Nice size snapper and well seasoned. Fresh salad consisted of small chunks of romaine lettuce, red onion slivers and slice tomatoes. Not sure what kind of salad dressing it was served with. It was subtle, not overbearing .  The spinach b\u00e9chamel was a creamy and tasty sauce.  It was overall delicious.  I did not felt rush to eat my meal, despite the fact that they were closed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-18", "description": "Dining at Esperpento will assault your senses - sound, taste, smell, and sight. I guess you could feel the food too if you really wanted to, and it would probably be great x]\n\nThe service here was friendly and helpful. Whether we had questions on what to order or wanted to know more about a certain ingredient, the waiters always helped us with a smile. The atmosphere was casual, inviting, and fun without being kitschy. A big party near us was happily celebrating something while a man played guitar and sang Spanish songs. Just a very nice environment to be in.\n\nJAMON IBERICO (Iberican Ham):\nIf you've had this before, you know it needs no introduction. Well-aged, smooth, and buttery, the marbled parts of it will melt in your mouth. It's on the sweeter rather than saltier side and goes well with just a simple slice of bread.\n\nGAMBAS AL AJILLO (Garlic Shrimp):\nMaybe the only dish we tried that I'd suggest skipping. The flavor was a bit forgettable and there are many more interesting things to try.\n\nBOQUERONES EN ACEITE (White Anchovies in Olive Oil):\nIf you love anchovies or similarly strong fish as much I do, this will be a treat. The anchovies are filleted and served simply with olive oil, some salt, parsley, and lemon. That's all they need to highlight the fresh fish flavor.\n\nPATATAS BRAVAS (Spicy Potatoes):\nThis dish is a MUST here or at pretty much any tapas restaurant, but especially here. Esperpento serves them as a good-sized portion of fried, cubed potato smothered in their pimenton-based sauce. The sauce is creamy, spicy, smoky, and really damn addicting. You'll probably want to be ahead of the game and just order 2 of these to start with, since you'll end up doing it later anyway. They sell the sauce separately as well, and we ended up buying one (we use it to dip bread in and it's amazing every time).\n\nSANGRIA:\nAt $15 a pitcher, it's a good deal. Theirs is on the sweeter side but still very tasty, especially paired with the heartier tapas fare like patatas bravas.\n\nOverall: We shared a couple other dishes, but these are the ones I remember most clearly. Most things are about $5-10, so spend carefully or it could add up. Still, it's better priced than many other places. Even with the high number of tapas restaurants in SF, I'd highly recommend Esperpento and would happily return.", "author": "Ankita A."}

We were seated without being given menus for 8 minutes. I had to walk downstairs and ask the boss lady for some water, but she blatantly brushed me off by nodding her head and then looking away. The waiter never came by to check on us (refill waters, ask for further requests), except to drop off our food. Overall, the food is about a 6-7 out of 10, but if I have to deal with the same service again, I will never come back. \n\nThe Sangria was very tasty, so I would definitely recommend that. We got the fried red snapper tenders, they were a bit chewy - either overcooked or not fresh. The waiter recommended the chicken/beef combo stew and it ended up being too salty.

Albondigas (meatballs) are good. Champinones Al Ajillo (mushrooms) are good. Rabo Toro is good (oxtail stew).

But we didn't make a reservation anywhere because we just wanted to wing it. Unfortunately, our first choice, a restaurant a couple blocks away, was completely packed, and the wait was going to be 1.5 hours. So we stumbled on this place by accident. And what a wonderful accident it was! There was only a very short wait (like ten minutes) for a table of four on a busy Saturday night.\n\nTo start, I recommend the Sangria - not the glass, the pitcher. At first, I thought there was not enough fruit or alcohol. But I simply asked for more fruit, which they brought out in a bowl, and believe me, there was definitely alcohol in there, which will sneak up on you if you're not careful.\n\nFor tapas, we ordered the Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp). It was probably my favorite dish of the night! Juicy shrimp in a warm garlic sauce that is actually perfect for dipping the bread that they bring you. We also had the Croquetas de Pollo (Chicken Croquettes). Normally, I'm not a fan of croquettes, but these just melted in my mouth, and the sauce was amazing as well. Finally, we had the Patatas Aioli (Garlic Mayonnaise Potatoes), which they mistakenly thought was Patatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes), so we actually got to try both.\n\nFor our entree, we ordered the Paella de Mariscos for two. There was a bit of a wait for it, but it was well worth the wait! Seasoning was absolutely perfect, and they were very generous with the seafood. The only downside was that we couldn't finish it in one go, so we had to take it home and of course it wasn't as good the next day.\n\nAll of the food was reasonably priced. The restaurant had a very authentic feel and we even had a small band come around the tables and play at one point during the meal. Also, our server was very warm and friendly. He did mess up a couple of our orders, and it took a while for things like drink refills, but we still loved it all. I'm really glad the other place was packed and that my friends and I were able to try something more off the grid.", "author": "Eryn H."}

Where to go??\nWe were the first party of 4 on the waitlist, so ordered sangria and sat outside in the (ridiculously-cold-why-aren't-I-wearing-a-down-jacket) spring eve. We were ushered inside a mere 45 minutes later (I-own-wool-sweaters-why-are-they-in-my-closet-and-not-on-my-body) and seated at the window. We were promptly forgotten, so flagged down our waiter a mere 45 minutes later (about-to-eat-the-tablecloth). \n\nWe'd come for the paella, but since we weren't able to order until 9:30pm and it was a 60 minute wait for the paella, we decided to get a mess of tapas. We tried: morcilla (blood sausage), gambas al ajillo (shrimp in butter), judias verdes rebozadas (green beans), patatas bravas, arroz, butifara con judias blancas (catalonian sausage with white beans), and parrillada de carne (a giant platter of grilled meats - chorizo, chicken, carne asada). A major theme here is the spicy sauce that comes with just about everything on the menu - it's delicious, perfect with the crispy, fried patatas, and great for sopping up with bread. All of the food was savory, rich with flavor, and decidedly delicious. \n\nHowever, the restaurant was incredibly loud and service was incredibly slow. The mariachi guys aggressively come around to the tables demanding tips, which feels awkward during a nice dinner (we tipped 3 times but that apparently wasn't sufficient?). We got much more attention from them then we did our waiter, who forgot our water, wine and paella order. If you decide to come here, 1) make a reservation well in advance, 2) decide what you want before sitting down, 3) order your (hour-to-prepare) paella before anything else, 4) be prepared to yell at the top of your lungs in order to be heard, 5) get really drunk and REALLY enjoy your food.", "author": "Ray J."}

My friends and I got there a little after 7 p.m. on a Friday, just before the restaurant got packed. We were immediately seated at a small table, but all of the tables are kind of smushed together so it was close quarters with our neighbors. \n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, especially with its tapas selection. We ordered: morcilla (blood sausage), jamon iberico (ham imported from Spain), calamares fritos (calamari), chorizo, and patatas bravas (spicy potatoes). They all came about 20 minutes after waiting. \n\nI have to say: none of them disappointed. \n\nThe morcilla is a little less seasoned in comparison to what you'll actually find in Spain, but when you dip it in the spicy sauce, it gives a good kick of flavor. Esperpento evidently takes a lot of pride in this sauce--and for good reason--as they use it as a complement for almost every tapa. The patatas bravas are probably the best that I've ever had! \n\nMy favorite tapas of the night were the patatas bravas and the calamares fritos. \n\nWe finished off with the Paella Negro, which is known for its black color due to the squid ink. It's not the best paella that I've had, but when you squeeze the lemon on top of the black rice, it's a pleasant bite. \n\nAs for the service, I can understand why people have complained about the waiters/waitresses not being as attentive. There were a few times that we had to ask our waiter to refill our water cups. But other than that, the staff was perfectly friendly. I do have to say that being approached more than once by the live music performers was a little much, but it contributes to the lively atmosphere of the place. \n\nWhenever I'm missing Spain, I'll be sure to come back to Esperpento again!", "author": "Jane H."}

We had to ask three times for the bill in my most recent visit. \n\nI'd say the food is totally worth the slow, sometimes negligent, service. But I would love to see the service be a bit more attentive next time :) three stars for now, but I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Amy P."}

The service was very fast, but as I'll mention below that may not have been a good thing since some of the food didn't taste fresh.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 4 tapas dishes. I'll go over each of them:\n\nJamon Serrano en Pan con Tomate (ham on bread with tomatoes): this was pretty tasty. The ham seemed like it was very good quality. The bread wasn't as great as I would have liked, tasted pretty soft, not like a high quality bread with a crispy outside and soft inside.\n\nEscalivada (eggplant): I really love eggplant, but honestly this dish disappointed me. It was a bit bland and tasted like it had been heated up, not made fresh.\n\nMorcilla (blood sausage): I had been looking forward to trying this for the first time and it was really tasty! No complaints here.\n\nChampi\u00f1ones al ajillo (mushrooms with garlic): Another dish I was disappointed by. The flavor was fine, nothing to special, but it didn't taste very fresh. I would sometimes get cold pieces like the food had been heated unevenly.\n\nThe food was fine, but I've definitely had better and I probably won't return.", "author": "Lucy C."}

Phew! \n\nWe were seated immediately upstairs. Looked over the menu and knowing paella took some to cook we put that order in first. Started with a pitcher of sangria. Best sangria I've had in a while! Or was it just Friday and I needed a drink? Lol \n\nOrdered \nMejillones a la vinaigrette - steamed mussels \nCalamares a la plancha - grilled calamari\nPatatas bravas - spicy potato goodness. That sauce tho! \nRope Viejo- beef stew \nPaella de carnes - opted for the meat only as my friend is allergic to clams. Ordered the serving for 4. Could easily feed 6 or maybe it's cause we had the tapas beforehand. Still made for delicious leftovers the next day! \n\nAlmost forgot. There complimentary bread that comes with this orange sauce. So yummy! \n\nEverything was delicious!! Definitely satisfied my craving for Spanish tapas. \n\nSitting upstairs can't speak for downstairs.

It tasted... bland and maybe some chorizo would've added some extra flavor.\n\nThat crostini - yummy but eat it fast because it gets soggy!!\n\nI definitely want to come again and try out different items on the menu.

The bread basket was soo tasty but they didn't offer to refill. They didn't offer to refill water. Actually, the service overall was a bit strange. When we first entered, we stood there for a minute completely ignored. We called at a waiter, who ignored us for a sec then came to help. He said he'd have a table for us, looked around, then walked away. A woman came to help and did the same. I mean, there were at least 3 empty tables. We finally got seated, after they pulled two tables apart and added a third chair to one, where my party of 3 sat. They left us with menus, and I had no silverware or plate. I took the set from the empty table nearest, and a couple minutes later yet another random person came with another plate. Well, too little too late. The waiters were very nice, but when talked to they would ignore you then come a few moments later which was irritating. They lacked communication as well.

Along with the Sangria are quite a few tapas on the menu to choose from.  We settled on:\n\nChorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" sauteed spanish sausage $5.25 - these were little bite sized sausages that come out charred.  These were tasty and a decent appetizer.\n\nPatatas Bravas spicy potatoes ($4.50) - These potato wedges come with a mildly spicy sauce.  I really liked this tapa. Actually went well with the chorizo we ordered.\n\nMariscada seafood platter griddled seafood platter with calamari, jumbo tiger clams, mussels, scallops and snapper ($26) -  the difference between this and the paella is it doesn't have the burnt bottom like the paella, a little more variety of seafood, and about 20 less minutes to prepare.

Made reservations, but when we arrived there were quite a few empty tables. We had to wait a anyway since it seemed no one was paying attention. \n\nThe first thing that threw me off beside the dirty menu I was handed was the extremely loud Mexican band making the rounds. Having grown up listening to this type of music, I usually don't mind it, but they were pretty bad, and they felt the need to hang around the table that was right next to us all night. It made it nearly impossible to have a conversation. One of the guitar players was so close I was afraid he was going to hit me in back of the head with his guitar!  \n\nI ordered a Verdejo and my date ordered a Sangria. Not once were we asked if we would like a second glass or a refill of water. We also ordered a variety of tapas to share. Disappointed with some of them. \n\nPatatas Bravas- pretty good, but the sauce on it seemed mayo based. Perfect spice, but not what the sauce is traditionally made of. \n\nGambas al Ajillo- again not authentic in our opinion. It seemed more like a shrimp scampi dish you would find at Olive Garden or someplace else. The sauce was okay for dipping, but not what you would find in Spain\n\nRabo de toro- extremely fatty. More fat on it than meat and the broth was just swimming with it as well. It had good flavor, but it reminded me more of a Mexican soup than a Spanish one. The spices used in it seem more in tune with a posole than Rabo de toro. Disappointing. I picked some meat off, but left the rest, including the greasy broth. \n\nAlbondigas- we had heard wonders about these, but I think they were my biggest disappointment. All you could taste was oregano!  It tasted like someone has accidentally dumped a load of it into the meat and left it as is. You couldn't taste anything else. Again, reminded me of Mexican cooking and not Spanish since that spice is not widely (or heavily) used in Spanish dishes.\n\nEscalivada- eggplant with peppers and onions. Well, it was suppose to have peppers, but we didn't really see any. Extremely greasy including the dish. So greasy that when we picked up the dish to move it, it slipped out of my bf's hands and landed on the table. \n\nTwo good things- the Croquetas de bacalao and the Crema Catalana. The croquettes were delicious and served with a yummy Spinach bechamel. The Crema Catalana is suppose to be similar to a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but better in my opinion. \n\nWith all this, it was pretty affordable, but not something we would go back to. While the croquettas were good, my boyfriend makes WAY better ones at home. I'll just save my cravings for his home cooking, or our yearly trip to Spain. \n\nTwo stars for the croquettas and dessert.  If I could give one and a half I would. Everything else, including the service should get one or less.", "author": "Diana G."}

I had the culinary pleasures of Spain at my fingertips. As I awaited my Almejas a la marinera I sipped some sangria and took a moment. I looked at the classic Spanish mosaic street signs on the walls and the cured meats and aged cheeses in the deli case.  It took me right back to my time road tripping through Spain right after college.  The food came out right in time with just enough sangria left for the main course, a nice bowl of clams in a traditional red sauce, with a basket of bread.  I couldn't have been happier and by the looks of the atmosphere in the dining room, everyone seemed to agree.  Now, this is a tapas place, and for those of you with an appetite, there are loads of small plates and mains to choose from especially paella for two.

We had a reservation for six people made a few days before. The place as super crowded and loud. It happened to be an incredibly hot and humid day of San Francisco's Indian Summer.\nVentilation at this tapas bar is virtually nonexistent, and certainly not nearly enough for a place that hosts so many customers. I had a very difficult time breathing. Our table setting was incomplete, with missing knives and condiments. It took forever to get anyone to take our order. The waiters kept all passing the buck, like it's none of their business. When someone finally did take our order, he never returned to check on the status of our food, nor to see if we needed more water, sangria, or bread. It turned out he went home sick, but we were only informed of this when we ourselves were getting ready to leave. When I complained to the hostess about the poor service and lack of table settings, she acted like it was not a big deal and certainly not her problem. Our main dish, the seafood and meat paella arrived not 30 promised minutes after the order was placed but more like an hour and ten minutes! When it did finally arrive, the rice was dry and burned on the bottom. The tiny amount of seafood was sper dry and the entire dish contained no spices or salt even. I was very disappointed, since I am very familiar with what an authentic seafood paella is supposed to taste and look like, and believe me, this was not it by a long shot. However, hunger won out and our small group ate this poorly prepared dish. The tapas, which we got before were done well, I must admit, however even with this there was a gliche, as we did not get two out of the five we ordered, because they had forgotten about it , and we had to remind them, after we ate the main course.  Both the water and the Sangria were served at barely the room temperature. No one even bothered to check whether we wanted water with ice or not, and just brought us iceless lukewarm water. We had to ask for a refill. The noise level was horrendous, as the place is rather small and should not be open to so many people. In addition to the natural noise of so many customers, there was also additional noise from the two guitar players that took turns playing and singing rather loudly and off tune in an atmosphere that was already way too loud and hectic. \nIn short, I would not recommend this place to anyone, despite its popularity specifically and mainly because of very poor service and lack of empathy for such service. I believe that the food may have been lacking in quality perhaps because the kitchen staff was also understaffed that evening. I will definitely never set foot on this place again, and am looking forward to reviewing it on social media!", "author": "Elina S."}

The paella was OK too.\n\nThe service, however, is another story.  We had 8:30 reservations and weren't seated until after 9pm after checking in with the host a few times. He clearly did not have a firm grasp on the chaotic situation known as the restaurant and even as tables opened up instead of having people seated was bombarded by people trying to put their names down instead.  Many times re-set tables would be left unseated for 10+ minutes.. \n\nOn top of the incompetent host, the wait staff also left much to be desired.  They were strictly focused on their own tables.  If we asked a waiter (who wasnt our assigned guy) for a fork (which two of our settings were missing)  they would say - \"You need to ask your waiter\" instead of OK no problem. This happened many times and our waiter himself was impossible to find .. \n\nTo be fair, this place was packed to the rim - the prices are pretty good, with a pitcher of sangria + paella and about 7 tapas the bill came out to be less than $100, so especially for SF standards the price is right, which is why I think it's so packed.. but service definitely suffers..immensely.", "author": "Melody T."}

I wished the menu online stated that it would take 30 mins... unless I somehow did not see it. We ordered the meat and seafood combo paella for 4.\n\nMy whole family ordered their own lunch serving... and I was like we should just order tapas since we have paella!! But no... no one ever listens to me! And by the time the paella came they were full -_- I ordered the grilled vegetable salad which was so good. I mean it was so simple yet really flavorful, probably because of the garlic and aioli. My family shared the grilled calamari tapas, really good too. I had some of my dad's salmon which was good too but I liked the calamari better. But I hate how it's so oily :(\n\nI was so impatient for the paella to come LOL i swear every 5 minutes I kept turning around to see if our paella was coming. There was 6 of us and we ordered the paella for 4 and it was still too much that we had to take some home, but then again we were kinda full already. I don't eat meat so I was literally picking out all the seafood out of the paella haha. The seafood was good, but the paella was just okay. It was kinda soggy.

The only downside was that it was too late to order paella.\n\nWe ordered a whole bunch of tapas dishes and literally everything we ate was amazing.  Let's do a play by play so you can really understand how good it was.  First, bread and a spicy aioli sauce to dip in.  Simple but really really good, even after we got our food, we asked for more bread and dip.  The sauces in all the seafood plates are highly dippable and the spicy dip is highly spreadable on anything.\n\nNext was grilled clams in olive oil and parsley.  We couldn't decide between the clams with marinara sauce or olive oil and the waiter suggested the olive oil.  The sauce was ridiculously flavorful.  If everything else weren't so good, I would've been content to eat a whole plate of bread dipped in that sauce.\n\nJamon Serrano.  What to say here?  It's salty cured meat on a piece of toast.  What is there not to like?  We had also ordered anchovies, so slap one of those on top of the jamon and slather some of that spicy dip and it's even better.\n\nOxtail stew was savory and comforting.  The chunks of meat were so tender, they fell right off the bone.\n\nGrilled quail with rosemary potatoes.  The skin was perfectly crisp and the flavor was on point.  The potatoes were also the bomb diggity, exploding with flavor.\n\nGrilled artichoke was one of my favorites.  The pieces are sliced through the whole artichoke, not just the heart, so you can see the layers of leaves.  The grill flavor was wonderful.  I have never seen this before and will probably order this over and over again.\n\nGrilled scallops came with three large pieces on a skewer with yellow rice.  The flavor was good but the portion was a little skimpy.\n\nAll in all, we were totally stuffed.  Did we over order in a panic that the kitchen was going to close?  Maybe.  Do we regret it?  Not one bit.  The service was great and not once did we feel rushed.  The kitchen closed at their stated closing time but all the other patrons in the restaurant continued to hang out and enjoy their wine.\n\nThis is the best tapas I've had since eating in Spain and most of the dishes are very reasonable priced.

It was exactly how I thought it would taste, fishy, oily and a light hint of citrus.  Kind of meh tasting by itself but I ended up putting it on my free bread with some of the red hot sauce that the bread came with and it complimented each other very well, even though the bread was a bit tough.\n\nBrocheta De Vieiras: scallops with onions on a stick/skewer.  The scallops were on the smaller side but they were cooked perfectly.  Nice grill marks, still plump and had good flavor where most scallops I usually try are bland.\n\nAlmejas A La Plancha grilled clams with garlic. \"guindilla\" parsley and olive oil.  My first bite of the clams was extremely salty.  The so salty that it feels like it burns your tongue kind of salty.  But my friends were eating it just fine and they didn't seem to find it salty at all.  Confused, I tried another one, crazy salty again, my friends must be insane.  My friends eat the rest and leave one more for me, reluctantly I try it again, and its not salty at all and quite tasty...Why couldn't the others taste like the 3rd one?\n\nOverall for the price I think my dining experience was just A-OK.

So we drove up to SF from the South Bay to go eat here.\n\nFirst off, we had a reservation, but the table they wanted to put us at, was literally squished in between two other tables where it would not accommodate both of us to actually sit at the table, even after asking to move to another table were told that was the only one available.  Very awkward!  They moved us to another table, but only because someone else cancelled a reservation.  Seriously, not a great way to start.  \n\nOkay, so now we are at a comfortable table.  It took about 20 minutes for a server to come and get our order.  We ordered everything up front.  Then waited another 30 minutes for our drinks.\n\nI am not sure if they were understaffed, but it definitely wasn't running efficiently.  There was a large party upstairs that were very upset.  Not sure what happened, but it was looking like the customer & the manager were going to get into a fist fight!\n\nWe got our appetizers after about 40 minutes.  And they were good.  We got potatoes, calamari and asparagus.  I would have passed on the asparagus though, as its not in season so just kind of blah.  But the potatoes and calamari were very good.\n\nWe eventually got our main dinner, lobster paella.  And it really was good.  I could eat the rice alone, it had so much flavor in it.  \n\nThe food was definitely good (the three stars is completely based on the food), but the service (again, not sure what it is like normally and hoping it was just an off night), and probably won't get another drive from the South Bay out of me to come here.", "author": "Buffy M."}

I couldn't even tell you if they have clean cups and/or water, since they didn't even bother to give us that while waiting to even receive a menu. Sounds like pretty basic stuff even if a restaurant is busy doesn't it. I don't mind waiting when I notice a restaurant is busy so long as I'm at least acknowledged. After being seated we even attempted to flag two different people down to simply look over the menu as we waited to get our order taken, but got a \"I'm not a waiter\" response from both as if handing us a menu was going to cause their arm to fall off. We eventually chucked it out to being discriminated for being Latin since it seemed most of their customers were Caucasian. We got up and left, very disappointed. After all, they are located in a Latin neighborhood.", "author": "Jessica Y."}

So when my friend Daniel L. suggested that I try their popular Lobster Paella, I knew I had to check this place out before leaving SF. I love my paellas, whether it be the traditional Valenciana or the Mixta (meat & seafood, the best of both worlds!). I've been craving for a paella fix for quite some time since my last binge, the added tapas menu sealed the deal for me. \n\nWe made reservations on my last night in SF. Our reservation was for 7:45pm but we had to wait a while because our table was still occupied. No biggie, I was still stuffed from my snack a couple hours earlier at Hog Island Oyster Co. Our server was very apologetic & even gave us free Sangria for the wait, sweet!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=jZq2dxyRcUoJfO78-c4rhQ\n\nOverall, the food was okay. There were a couple items that I liked & would probably order again. But the overall experience and 30min wait for the paella left me a bit disappointed. Everyone was done with their appetizers and entrees, but I was still waiting on my paella. \n\n The restaurant is not that big, pretty crowded w/tables being closely spaced, to the point that my chair would get kicked by servers during passing (I even got an elbow to the shoulder as one server was carrying plates of food pass me). My point: There's just no room for an in-your-face Mariachi band. \n\nStreet performers needs to be just that, street performers. Yes, Esperpento lets this Mariachi band in to play music (per some of the regular patrons). Free entertainment for the restaurant. I don't mind them playing music, but when it's blaring right next to my ears and raining spit while I'm eating....that's when I get irritated. The worst part is that they rudely walked around to each of us at our table & shoved their tip bag in our faces, saying nothing more than \"tip please\"... WTF?!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=HE6VEuaHiQjV2zXNnNhBww\n\nOkay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's talk food. I'll start with the good (indicated w/ *):\n\n* MEJILLONES A LA VINAIGRETTE ($6)\nSteamed mussels in a spicy-garlicky butter sauce. The sweet shallots & chili flakes complimented the very plump, well-cooked mussels. I should've ordered 2 of these. I also wished that there were bread to sop up all of that goodness on the bottom of the bowl.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=1WsMI5GslpqXbI4oiE8_nQ\n\n* ALCACHOFAS A LA PLANCHA ($5.50): \nThinly sliced artichokes are grilled with garlic and parsley. My 2nd favorite dish of the night. The artichoke was nicely charred and crisp, the perfect salty-garlicky treat! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=I0vZXzmJZ7dIvAz-6Xy0mg\n\n* CALAMARES A LA PLANCHA ($6.50)\nTender calamari pieces were tossed in an olive oil/garlic/parsley mixture & grilled to perfection. So tender! The grilled onions & tomatoes lacked seasoning, a pinch of salt would've made it perfect.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=WqgbuGA270_uGnUJXyd5Fw\n\nCALAMARES FRITOS ($6.50)\nYou all know how much I love my fried calamari, I couldn't pass this up. Wish I did though because it was a soggy-greasy mess. I prefer my fried calamari to be crisp and not soft.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=2xCaESzL1G46CYLw79RJ2w\n \nPAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA/LOBSTER PAELLA ($28 for a portion big enough for 2, $50 for 4 people & $75 for 6):\n\nOurs had 2 small lobster tails (split into 4 halves), clams, calamari & peas.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=ruJ0AaBcoJjfsl4_PX_x0Q\n\nThis was suppose to be my entree. It was the last to arrive bc it took more than 30mins, so by then we were all done with everything else & just sat around waiting. It turned out to be a disappointing dish, not worth the wait.\n\nThe lobster tails were overcooked & dry. It was funny to see some of us fighting to get the meat out from the shell, it was pretty tough & stringy! \n\nThe calamari was thin, it's like chewing on rubber bands. In this pic, you can see how thin the calamari rings were, almost the same diameter as the peas.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=TUVOMbKAbk_dJCHvVJZsNg\n\nThe most essential part of a great paella is the rice, the protein & veggies only adds flavor to the dish. The 'socarrat' is what I look forward to in a well-made paella. It's the crusty-crunchy rice layer that forms at the bottom of the pan, where all the flavors of the ingredients are the most concentrated. This is only possible when the pan is cooked over very high heat or an open fire. Cooking in an oven will only give you soggy risotto like this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=qRbH0Pxi8M67mihOp63fjQ\n\nI didn't get a saffron kick at all. If there were any saffron in the pan, it was very weak. The paella was more like a risotto dish. Thank god for post-dinner Fernet shots at The Rockit Room!", "author": "Cin T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-19", "description": "\"Sorry, we're going to need ANOTHER table (AGAIN).\" One may think it's because we have more people, but in our case it's ALWAYS b/c my friends and I order a plethora amount of food that leaves the wait staff and other patrons (o_O).\n\nOur dinner on Monday, 2.21.11 was no exception. I realize this review is bit dated but as I was looking through my notes on my BB, I realized that I never wrote a review for Esperpento (Yes, I'm a nerd and take notes.) That night, we (party of 6) walked in w/o reservations at 6 PM and were seated upstairs w/ only a 2-3 min wait. We knew our table may not be large enough for all our food so we asked if we can add the empty table next to us to our table which our waiter was more than happy to oblige.\n\nF O O D / D R I N K S:\n*3 PITCHERS OF SANGRA ($17/ea): Smooth and full of fruity flavors and notes w/ a touch of an acidic bite. The bits of apple and oranges gave it an extra burst of sweetness. \n\n*PAELLA DE LA LANGOSTA - Lobster Paella (Serving for 4 - $50): DISAPPOINTING!!!\n\nI'm no Paella expert but I've had paella enough times and watch enough Food Network and Travel Channel to know the components that make a good paella. Other Yelpers have raved about Esperpento's paella but that night our paella was a complete fail. \n\nRICE: The rice was firm but had a creamy risotto like consistency (not dry and separate the way it should be). It was flavorful and had soaked up all the liquids and aromatics (i.e. onions, garlic, saffron and other herbs) but it also had an off putting fishiness to it.\n\nSOCARRAT: Perhaps the heating source wasn't sufficient or the incorrect pan was used, but the paella lacked the golden caramelized bottom crust which is quintessential to a good paella.  \n\nTOPPINGS: The lobster (4 lobster tails halved) was overcooked, dry, stringy and bland and the calamari had a prominent fishiness to it. We utilized all 10 lemon wedges to add some moistness and to hide the unappetizing fishy flavor. \n\nTAPAS: Serving size per a tapa was 2-3 people so we ordered 2 orders for some dishes.\n\n*2 JAMON SERRANO - Cured Ham on French Bread ($6) SIMPLY DELICIOUS! Crusty bread topped w/ a salty and fatty slice of ham w/ thick slices of tomatoes for sweetness and tang.\n\n*2 PATAS BRAVAS -Spicy Potatoes ($4.50): YUMMY! The potatoes had a super crisp exterior w/ a pillowly soft interior. The spicy aioli was rich and creamy w/ nice kick of heat.\n\n*2 CROQUETAS DE POLLA - Chicken Croquettes ($5): SAVORY & COMFORTING! The croquettes were fried to a golden brown w/ an extra crisp crust and filled w/ a savory creamed chicken mixture. The accompanying creamed spinach sauce added a tangy zip and an extra layer of richness.\n\n*CALAMARES A LA PANCHA - Grilled Calamari ($6.75): GOOD! The calamari was perfectly grilled to a sweet tenderness and was flavorful w/ a subtle smokiness.\n\n*MEJILLONES A LA PLACHA - Grilled Mussels ($7): GOOD! The sweet and tender mussels were bathing in a savory and rich broth w/ herbaceous notes brightened w/ the splash of lemons. Our complimentary crusty bread was perfect for dunking and soaking up all the brothy goodness.\n\n*GAMBAS AJILLO SHRIMP - Garlic Shrimp ($7): GARLICKY GOODNESS! The tender and sweet shrimp albeit small were bathing in garlic sauce which was buttery, robust and full of bold garlicky flavor.\n\n*RABO TORO - Oxtail Stew ($7): COMFORTING! The oxtail was fall-off-the-bone tender and was in a rich and savory broth. The broth had a depth of flavor as if the oxtails, veggies and herbs had been simmering for hours.\n\n*ROPA VIEJO - Beef, Chicken & Chorizo Stew ($5.50): OK. The beef and chicken were dry and there was a lack of chorizo to give the stew a rich and smoky flavor.\n\n*CHAMPINONES AL AJILLO - Mushroom w/ Garlic ($5.25): DELISH! The mushrooms were tender and meaty w/ a distinct garlic flavor that wasn't overwhelming and sprinkles of parsley for a pop of freshness.\n\n*ASPARAGUS A LA PLANCHA - Grilled Asparagus Ala Plancha ($5.25): PERFECTLY COOKED! The large spears were vibrant green and tender, yet had the crisp al-dente bite to it. The spicy aioli gave it a layer of creaminess w/ a slight kick and the lemons a citrus punch.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. \n\nOur food came out quickly w/ only a 5 min wait for our first dish while the others quickly followed suit.  The paella took the longest at about 30 mins.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nRustic and casual Spanish feel w/ bright yellow, red and pink hues, country wood tables and chairs, Spanish abstract art and tchotchkes. It's  very lively especially when the Mariachi Band makes its rounds so it's a fun atmosphere for groups.    \n\nP A R K I N G:\nDifficult street parking, however, there's a parking garage on 2 blocks away on 21st/Valencia. \n\nEsperpento is a good alternative to Cha Cha Cha w/ very solid dishes full of vibrant flavors. I would come back again but would skip the paella.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It was an evening filled with yummy sangria, paella and amazing company. It was truly a good meal bookended with the delicious tapas and amazing flan. :) \n\nMy friend had made a reservation at Esperpento for 7:30pm and because I had run into some traffic getting into the city, the reservation was pushed back to 8pm without any hassle it seems. We got to the restaurant by 8pm and waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated and because it was Monday night, ordered the paella special. The paella on Monday nights came with a pitcher of sangria AND a dessert flan! What a great deal! There were 5 people in the party so we ordered the paella for 6 and two tapas to share while we waited for the paella to finish cooking (it takes about 40 minutes understandably). \n\nThe sangria was good and pretty strong for my tastes; definitely not watered down though I wished it was more chilled. My friends ordered some blood sausage and fried cheese and both dishes were amazing! I LOVED the texture of the blood sausage and wished there was more! \n\nSeriously though, the start of the meal was that paella. We ordered the seafood paella and it did not disappoint. It arrived to our table, steaming hot and we dug in. There were so many plentiful pieces of seafood (clams, mussels & shrimp). I love love loved each bite and we all devoured the contents of the big skillet ravenously. It was, hands down, the best paella I've ever had and my the meal got a big thumbs up from my Columbian friend so that's saying something. \n\nBottom line: The dim lighting, close seating and light music made the restaurant very romantic and intimate.

I'm really surprised it doesn't have 4+ stars. \n\nI came here for their paella this past weekend. I walked in here at 6pm on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly empty. The place filled up pretty quickly around 7 though. \n\nMy family and I ordered the Lobster Paella for two and it was DELICIOUS. It comes straight out in the paella pan, with plenty of perfectly cooked rice, 4 (!!) lobster tails, plenty of calamari and clams. All that for only $38! I couldn't believe it. I've had one other place make it with more flavor, but the paella still tasted amazing here. It's definitely enough to split among 3 people. And the lobster was probably the JUICIEST lobster I HAVE EVER EATEN! I couldn't get enough. \n\nI also ordered a few tapas and vegetable plates. I recommend it all! I started with the garlic mushroom and grilled asparagus. Both were delicious! Didn't know such a simple vegetable could taste so spectacular. The garlic flavor in the mushrooms was simply heavenly and I loved the sauce the asparagus came with. \nThe tapas were a hit as well. We ordered a quail, which was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the ox tail stew. The stew was definitely more of a soup than a stew but tasted delicious nonetheless.

The restaurant's decor is eclectic and rustic, and definitely adds a cultural vibe to your dining experience. (I also love these things.)\n\nWhen it comes to the food, the menu can be slightly overwhelming, but they do organize all small plates according to category (meat, vegetarian, etc.). The paella is delicious, too, but seldom do I/we order it. What you MUST get: Patatas Bravas (the sauce is to die for and I still have yet to find a restaurant that tops this recipe) and Alcachofas (grilled artichokes prepared in a way you wouldn't even think, and it's garnished simply with garlic and lemon)!!

I guess that's a plus for some!\n\nOnto the juicy items (no pun intended).  My group ordered a combination of tapas and a chicken paella as the main event.  While the waiter said the chicken paella will take 30mins to cook, it came out almost 1.5 to 2 hours later.  The paella wasn't very tasty too.  I had to squeeze lots of lemon juice onto it for taste.  To add salt to the wound, the paella was burnt at the bottom of the paella pan so about 10% of it was cancerous.  I've had different paellas in Spain and none had that issue.  Paella is two thumbs down.\n\nFor all tapas we ordered, they were all ok or decent.

Called restaurant that morning to book reservations for 6 people - would they be able to accommodate this group at last minute?\n\nOh yes, give us your name and we will expect you.  \n\nWow.  Ok, let's see if they are good to their word.  Arrived at said place, a few minutes before our rsvp time.  Gave them my name, kind greeter (?) acknowledges our reservation, offers us a drink (heck yea - sangria please), and asked us to wait a few minutes while they get our table set up.  Took roughly 5 painful minutes before we were seated.  Now, other establishments would not seat us until all parties were present.  Not so with this place.  They seated us peeps that were present, while we waited for others.  In the meantime, while multitasking (read: wait and read menu) - we decided to order a few tapas to get the night started.  Man, oh man, oh man!!!  Deliciouso.  Ok, wait.  Let me start backwards.  Sangria - Yum!  Right mixture of fruits and wine, but careful..keep drinking that stuff and you'll be wobbling out of the restaurant.  It's a creeper, that one!  \n\nTapas: Pollo Al Ajillo (garlic chicken), Croquetas De Pollo (chicken croquettes), Albondigas (meat-balls stew with saffron), Rabo Toro (Ox-Tail Stew), Pollo Adobo (Spicy Exotic Chicken), Calamares Fritos (fried calamari), Almejas A La Marinera (clams in spanish \" marinara \" sauce, with sauteed onions, garlic, parsley and white wine), and Mejillones A La Vinaigrette (steamed mussels in picaro's vinaigrette) - were the picks from menu for this hungry group.  Our favorites were the Ox Tail, the Chicken Croquettes, the calamari, and the meat balls with saffron.  Now, the other selections were good as well - but these were the stand outs.  Also note that the steamed mussels and clams, although nicely presented, were not \"meat-plentiful\" - so if you order this, don't expect to get \"bite-size chunks of seafood jewels\" not so with these dishes.\n\nWe also ordered the seafood paella.  Now, I've had paella, and so the expectations were high.  With that said, although this dish was spectacular in presentation with assortment of (large) shrimps, mussels (small), clams (small) red peppers, peas etc - and the flavor was good.  The biggest question stood out.  WHERE WAS THE SOCCARAT?!  \n\nOverall - I'd rate this a 3.5 - with a creeping 4, solely because they seated us right away, the price point with the food, the tasty eats - not to mention -  a parking garage conveniently located 1 block from the restaurant (on 21st street).

There was a party of nine ahead of us and a couple as well. We were there at least 10 minutes and no one came out the restaurant to tell us that it would be a while for us to be seated. The couple ahead of us left, the party of nine were complaining because they had made reservations and they had been waiting an hour. On top of that while all of this is happening there were two table available and no one cared to seat us until I decided to ask why were there tables available and no one was sitting us down. The waiter waited 20 minutes to come get our order and brought us the wrong plate and I said it was ok since we didn't want to waste food. Awful service, the waitresses look young and lazy.

This one is a little pricey, but satisfies the craving. We always seem to find ourselves here when we're starving ( which adds to the bill.)\n\nI usually get the grilled vegetable platter which comes with lemon and aoli (which I think is really mayo..at least that's what it tastes like, so I skip it.) This is a pretty good dish overall. It comes with broccoli, cabbage, zucchini and peppers. \n\nI also get fried calamari with aoli ( again skip the 'mayoili' )... I love calamari so am generally satisfied with this. \n\nFinally,  I get a cazuela with clams and fish and a side of rice. The rice is pretty salty but I need rice so there it is. The  cazuela has good flavor, but is not a big portion.\n\nI generally end up spending a fair amount here, but could probably better satisfy my seafood/rice needs by ordering the paella, which  always looks fantastic on other peoples tables, and end up paying a lot less.  Next time I will try and plan ahead (paella takes a while) to do that. \n\nService is usually friendly and prompt. Tonight was a little strange and I think an aberration. They sat us right away, and then maybe 15 minutes later came and asked my husband to move farther away from the table next to us. Huh... So husband slid his chair in and squeezed closer to the kid, but I guess that wasn't enough. So now you are thinking husband is a big guy who needs a bunch of space...and actually no he isn't at all, and there was a ton of room....it seemed like they squished him in for no reason. Then a few minutes later they came back as it was determined that husband hadn't moved enough...so they had us move to another table altogether.\n\nStrange, right? They were not rude about moving us or anything, it was just sort of perplexing and didn't feel very welcoming.", "author": "El B."}

With such ethnic diversity, there is always an opportunity to experience many ethnic cuisines. Over the past several weeks, I have been sampling ethnic restaurants with a friend and have been trying to find hidden culinary gems in San Francisco. One of such hidden gems is the Esperpento.\n\nConcealed in the Mission District, Esperpento is Tapas Bar providing enriching Spanish food and drinks. This restaurant is located about 2 blocks from the 22nd Street Bart Station and opens 7 days a week, from 11 am (except Saturday and Sunday at midday) to 10pm (except Friday and Saturday when it closes at 11pm).\nThe restaurant has a typically Spanish ambience and has a d\u00e9cor featuring many tantalizing artifacts and posters teleporting you back to Spain. We arrived without reservation, my friend had arrived before me and managed to get a table.\n\nWe had arrived 3 hours after opening on a not-so-busy Saturday afternoon, and were very disappointed when we were told they were already out of Rabbit stew. Instead we had the Ropa Vieja Stew, featuring a tasty mix of beer, chicken, and chorizo. This was a delightful dish with a side of roasted potatoes and cabbage saut\u00e9ed with garlic and paprika.\n\nThe pitcher of Sangria was equally tasty. Mixed to a blend of orange and apple bits, the Sangria was fresh, fruity, and refreshing. An ideal choice for a sweltering Saturday extravaganza.\n\nAlthough, a little disappointed with not being able to try the Rabbit soup we left happy knowing that we would be back to try our luck again with the Rabbit and hopefully we will discover more hidden secrets of this Spanish culinary gem, Esperpento.", "author": "Sunny E."}

It was good. Nothing great. The service though... I thought the first time was bad but my experience last night was BAD. It took the server 15 minutes just to approach the table for drinks. She didn't seem too happy to be there and was giving everyone dirty looks. She also appeared to have a case of tunnel vision. When she was helping another table, she didn't for a second look around to see if any other tables needed anything before walking to the back to disappear for another 10 minutes. I spent many years as a waiter when I was in college, so I get it, and it really is a rare occasion that I leave a poor tip, but this experience definitely warranted that. But wait...I just checked my credit card statement and apparently she didn't feel the same and seemed to think she deserved more so added another $10 to the tip I wrote in. Now I'll be calling tomorrow and making sure she gets nothing.\n\n\nEdit: I've gone in 3 times and probably called a dozen times and have been unable to get ahold of a manager and have not received a call back.

You can imagine how much catching up we had to do. Decades worth of catching up! We ordered several tapas, sangria, and everything was delicious, and then.. \n\nthe FREAKEN MARIACHI band. I understand you want to set a romantic and authentic atmosphere, but it makes it extremely difficult for groups to talk to each other. In order to be heard I felt like I was shouting across our table. The place is just too small to be having a mariachi band playing the whole night.\n\nAll the tapas we ordered were excellent, but I was very disappointed with the seafood and meat paella.

You'll have to weave your way around tables and wedge yourself into your seat. Even when you get to your seat, there's not a lot of table room, so sharing plates may actually work to your advantage. On this note, it's not a great place for groups of over 6 people and even seating 6 people can be a challenge.\n\nThe food is great! Every tapas dish we got was enough for 2-3 people (our group of 5 ordered 4 tapas plates and that was plenty for us!) and the paella plate that we ordered for 4 people could have easily fed 6-7 people. The food was very flavorful (not bland or salty) and was cooked perfectly (none of the meat was over or under done and the potato dishes were perfectly soft and not under cooked). \n\nThe service was spotty and the servers seldom passed by our table which was in the corner on the top floor. As a result, it was hard to flag down any servers without physically going downstairs and confronting them. I also wondered if the servers seldom passed through the top floor in general because another group seated on the top floor complained about the water service being lacking (which was the case for our table, too) and how no one came to pick up their tab when they were ready to pay. Both that table and our table eventually had to take our tab downstairs and hand it to a server when we were ready to pay. \n\nThumbs up for the great food, but there is a lot of room for improvement on the service side.", "author": "Nirel R."}

The d\u00e9cor hasn't changed from the previous visit but the early evening sunlight filtering through the windows had kept the interior colorfully vibrant while the evening crowd was just beginning to grow. Our server, Eric, was very friendly and enthusiastic in providing a list of recommendations to consider, and we ordered six forms of tapas with a pitcher of sangria ($17) to share.\n\nThe major highlights of the meal included Patatas Bravas ($4.75) which arrived with delicious serving of potatoes with a layer of spicy sauce. We all loved this dish has it came with major wow factor which was consistent with my previous visit. The Rabo Toro ($7.50) came with tender oxtail s served in a stew and it was so tender the meat was falling off the bones. The sauces from both dishes were fantastic for bread dipping, and one can never leave here without trying their delightful sangria which was a major hit.\n\nI really wanted to try their Lobster Paella for the longest time ($50).  It came with seven half pieces of juicy lobster tails with large calamari rings, shrimps and clams to induce an aromatic lobster seafood flavor which was steeped into the rice. I really enjoyed this dish and servings were enough for everyone to get a nice portion. If there is a place to have paella in the City, Esperpento would be the restaurant to consider.\n\nThe Calamares Frito ($6.75) was decently fried but nothing special or tender like the ones at Blue. The Gamba Al Ajillo ($7) provided a sizable amount of jumbo shrimps with a hint of garlic, and Jamon Serrano ($6) served with Spanish cured ham on toasted French bread with touches of ripe tomatoes and olive oil were very good too.\n\nService was excellent!

We ordered some small plates and seafood/meat paella.  The plates came to the table quickly and were delicious.  However, we had to wait almost 1 1/2 hours for the paella to be served!  Waiter was very apologetic and gave us a small potato tapa - for that kind of wait we should have been given a carafe of sangria!  When the paella finally arrived, the 4 of us dug in and it was indeed very tasty.  However, their kitchen needs to either add more cooks or limit the amount of diners they can accommodate during busy weekend nights.  I will visit again, but this time go at 5 PM!", "author": "Debbie B."}

If you decide on this adventure, be prepared to be assaulted with collage of colors, cacophony of sounds and explosions of flavors. Not a place for a quiet meal with your new squeeze but perfect for small get together of friends looking for a fun evening of good food and good drinks.\n\nWe made reservations for seven at 6:30pm and got seated just before the crowd. By 7pm the place was hoppin', between the people seated, the people waiting, the staff and the strolling musicians the evening's festivities had begun.  We started with a carafe of Sangria which was a jammy mixture of fruit and mellow wine. Some sangrias taste like fruit juice mixed with wine, Esperpento's was luscious and  fruity and fully amalgamated into its foundation delicious full body wine. Just a taste transports you to a summer night in Madrid. The Sangria was the complement for a selection of tapas:\n\nCalamares Fritos-fried calamari $6.50\nMorcilla-sauteed spanish blood sausage $5.50\nTortilla De Patata-potato and onion omelet $6.00\n\nThe prize goes to my nephew for choosing the delicious Tortilla De Patata which was more of a potato cake than a tortilla. The fried calamari was excellent when dipped into their creamy house hot sauce. Now you know I had to try the blood sausage; it was very good but not exciting.\n\nFor the main dish we ordered the Lobster Paella for six. A Saffron-flavored Rice dish cooked with a gaggle of slipper Lobsters, Seafood and Vegetables served in a Paellera, $76. The server assured us that we had ordered enough since we had also ordered tapas and only had 6 adults in our group of 7. If you had asked my doctor he would have also told you that I had ordered more than enough but for a foodie it was only just enough. Heck, it wasn't enough - not because I was still hungry - it was so good. I didn't want to stop eating. The rice, the lobster, and vegies all came together like a Miles Davis arrangement.\n\nEsperpento is like the bull run in Pamplona but the servers were like the Catholic mass the next morning. The servers were way too somber for such a vibrant restaurant - what a drag on the festive atmosphere!\n\nNext time? I am just going to get a bunch of their tapas and have at it, okay maybe I'll finished it all off with a Crema Catalana.", "author": "Eddie C."}

I haven't had tortilla that delish since I lived in Madrid. Hard to come by GOOD spanish food in SF. I wanted to try the chicken croquetas, but am currently on a diet and tried to avoid fried things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-08", "description": "It's such an odd name for a paella place. Granted it's a pretty name like \"esperanza\" (which means \"hope\"), I think \"esperpento\" refers to stories that exaggerate reality into grotesque images to highlight society's ills. Or if you type the word into Google's translator, it comes up as \"gorgon\" - or \"terrifying female creature\". Huh? Well, I guess it sounds more mysterious than \"Carlos' Place\". \n\nI was drawn to the place on Friday because I was perusing Yelp to see what kind of culinary adventure Jamie W. and I could be up for. When I read you could have Lobster Paella for two for $26, I was hooked, and we came early enough to beat most of the crowds there. The vibe is pure Mission...a bit dark, a bit crowded, a bit loud. And all those traits intensified as the evening rolled on. The service was fast and solicitous - which I find refreshing in an otherwise indifferent neighborhood of hipsterdom. \n\nWe went for the $4.50 Patatas Bravas, which were billed as \"spicy potatoes\", and they weren't kidding. They had a nice crispiness and were definitely pan-fried hot. My one problem with them is that they ladled some kind of sauce that looked a bit like Velveeta but tasted - true to their word - kick-ass spicy with what I assume to be some jalapeno peppers mixed in (see photo). This was the preface, of course, to the Lobster Paella - which came steaming in a traditional paella pan. \n\nNow I'm no paella snob, but I have been to (ahem) Barcelona where I went to (ahem) 7 Portes Restaurant, the birthplace of paella in (gasp) 1836. But y'know what...they weren't that great at it either. I just think it's a dish best served at home one pan at a time rather than commoditizing it badly (...did you hear that, B44?). Esperpento's paella was certainly decent enough with plenty of ingredients - but no one can seem to escape the inevitable mushiness of the rice. At least they had the semi-burnt crust to chew on toward the end. There were two lobster tails to unshell, about a half-dozen clams, peas and tomatoes, and lots of big calamari rings (see photo). \n\nIt was all pretty good, certainly better than the much louder Picaro a few blocks away, and you can't beat a price like that for fresh lobster tails. But it does make me think I should wipe the dust off my old paella pan and try to make this dish this myself. Hey, I took a cooking class in Barcelona in May - but I was relegated to crema catalunya because I likes me the torch. Oh, who am I kidding? I'll probably come back here when I get the craving, but I'm open to other suggestions. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty decent paella for a fair price, especially when they offer lobster tails \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pure Mission bustle with hipsters and yupsters rubbing elbows in a cacophony of tapa-tude \nSERVICE - 4 stars...here's where they excel next to their paella brethren and sistren \nTOTAL - 3.5 stars...still looking for the ultimate paella, so the search continues...until I get off my tookis and make some myself, I guess", "author": "Ed U."}

On a Saturday night, in a hip place, its going to get busy.\n\nWe were a party of 10, so we made a reservation for 7:30 pm. After waiting 10 minutes for them to set up the table and then we were there for another 10 minutes-- they came after we had started drinking our waters and said \"There must be some mistake- did you cancel your reservation? because it is crossed out in the book.\" It turns out, they though we were a different party of 10, which had apparently arrived to be seated. They then also asked if we could sit downstairs, as for they had mistaken us for the other party.  We denied their request, it was cozier and quieter upstairs, and they were nice about it.\n\nnow, onto the food:\n\nSangria is great, not too sweet.\n1 pitcher will yield 4 large glasses, 6 small glasses. \n\npaella: soo good.

I had some roasted potatoes, which was very good. Well cooked but not as crispy on the outside as I would have liked.\n\nWe also ordered some jamon.

Loud. No parking.\n\nI called 3 days ahead for a reservation at 8 pm for 9 people.  Ideally, everybody should be there on time.  But there's always a lagger.  So we were all present 15 mins. after our reservation time. \n\nMike, the host, was professional.  Even though we kept following up (i.e. bugging him) he didn't get his feathers ruffled.  \n\nWe also didn't get seated until 45 mins. AFTER our reservation time.  Why even take reservations then?!\n\nOnce seated, we were given our water and handed menus.  Our waitress, who SHALL remain nameless, was not a happy camper.  Lady, I know it sucks working on a Friday night -- I work swing shift and there were many, many Friday nights when I'm stuck at work and all my friends were out partying.  Please.  Whatever her problem was it showed on her face and carried onto her attitude. \n\nThe menu is quite varied and for vegetarians, I'm happy to report that there are more than a few options available.\n\nA few yelpers also recommended the paella. The special for that night was lobster and calamari paella, we went with the $48 portion which serves 4 people (instead of the $68 for 6). We also wanted to try the meat paella. But got talked out of it.\n\nOur waitress puts in her \"helpful\" suggestion and says, \"well, are you sure you want ALL that pella?\"\n\n\"Well, you haven't seen my brother eat.\"  I jokingly said while pointing to my 6 foot, 200 lb. sibling. \n\nHer: \"yeah, but you'll be ordering tapas. That would be a lot of food\"\n\nMe: \"we would like to try a different paella too. Can't we just box the leftovers to go?\"\n\nHer: \"yeah. sure.\"\n\nAt this point, I felt like I was arguing with our server so I just dropped it. \n\nThe whole table shared and enjoyed every bite of these delicious tapas:\n\n3 plates of spicy patatas bravas, jamon serrano, oxtail stew, grilled asparagus, 3 plates of calamares fritos, 2 plates of gambas al ajillo, grilled salmon and our paella. \n\nEsperpento's sangria isn't as fruity or chilled like cha cha cha's.  I obviously prefer cha cha cha's version but it still gave me the wicked buzz I needed. \n\nYou should've seen my bro's face when they brought out the tapas though. \n\n\"this is it??\" he almost looked panicky.\n\nTo be fair, the portions are priced right and generous than most tapas places (ahem, Medjool) with plates ranging from $4-$10.   My bro just has a big appetite.  So that was a bad decision on my part. I should've ordered that second paella because I know my brother more than our waitress.  She did check up on us, but quite frankly, we saw the busboy more often.  BTW, we didn't even get offered dessert!  hmmph.\n\nSolid food at Esperpento.  \n\nIf you don't mind the wait, even with a reservation.\n\nAnd just hope that you end up with a better server than we did.", "author": "Janice C."}

Having traveled to Spain, I have high standards that often leave me comparing the food in the states to what I enjoyed there.\n\nI started with the Gambas Al Ajillo, based on other Yelp reviews. At $7, this dish is a hidden gem. The plate held about 10 Jumbo shrimp, swimming in a delicious pool of garlic and olive oil, seasoned perfectly and not overcooked. I decided I needed some carbs to compliment the protein, so faithful to my Yelpers, I tried the Patatas Bravas. \n\nLet me just say OH MY GOD. I was in heaven. The cubes of lightly fried potatoes was dressed with the most yummy sauce I have ever experienced. Spicy and creamy, I was double-dipping every potato in it, and then the bread too. I was trying to break  down the ingredients in my head so I could re-create it at home. Priced at $4.50, they are giving it away. It was large enough to share, considering the 'tapas' description. \n\nFinally, the Sangria was good. Not as memorable as those damn potatoes. But good enough to be a companion to one of the most amazing meals I've ever had. \n\nService was good. Waitress was nice and accommodating, but the host, not so friendly. I sat outside, cafe-style, to enjoy the people watching.. so I cant comment on the interior. But no wait and good neighborhood.", "author": "Debra C."}

Sorry!\n\nWe stayed safe and ordered basics stuff...Patatas Bravas were very unseasoned BUT they were cooked/fried very well (they came with the \"aioli\"). Fried Calamari was in thick rings with very bland batter (it also came with the \"aioli\"). The Deep Fried Snapper was...in big chunks, very bland and unseasoned, oh and it came with the \"aioli\"!! The grilled asparagus spears...surprise - came with \"aioli\"!! Oh but the sauteed mushrooms were pretty delicious. \n\nI didn't mind the lack of flavor in almost every dish because I was ravenous (also buzzed) and at least everything was cooked well and tasted how I would expect it to taste (minus being bland of course). And sometimes plain food isn't a bad thing...plain and predictable is better than fancy and nasty.\n\nI was also very satisfied after eating an entire basket of French Bread which comes with salted butter!!...which they rarely give you at restaurants.

For those of you who haven't been but have had tapas in Spain, let me first lay out some important differences in how stuff goes down:\n\n- When you order drinks, don't expect tapas to come for free along with it.  You will be greatly disappointed.\n\n- When you order your tapas, don't expect there to be one for everyone, it usually comes as a lump item that you divvy up.\n\n- Don't expect traditional tapas (for better of for worse).  They definitely make food following their own flair at this place.\n\nWe rocked up a few minutes late with a group of 6 when we went to the restaurant Friday night.  There was a birthday or 2 there, and the place was PACKED.  I'm honestly not sure how they meet fire code, but whatever.  After a semi-short wait, we got seated at an awkward round + square table, before requesting to move to a different round + square table combination that seemed to have more space.  While a little awkward for our group, we ended up making it work well enough.\n\nOur waiter was nice enough, though he seemed a little stressed; likely due to the MASSES of people in the restaurant.  We ordered 3 rounds of Sangria, which was good, in addition to the following food items:\n\n+ Garlic chicken (decent)\n+ Pollo Adobo (boring, don't get it)\n+ Both kinds of potato dishes (which were amazing)\n+ Asparagus (good)\n+ Mushrooms (good, but tasted kind of like Chinese food)\n\nand some other items I didn't try... (shrimp, other seafood, etc).  Everyone seemed pretty happy with our meal, but we definitely ordered a few rounds of potatoes as they were clearly superior to everything else on the menu.\n\nIn summary, the place was fun and interesting.  I don't know that I'd go back under my own plans, but I wouldn't argue if a friend suggested it.  \n\nThe waiter split our bill 5 ways, which was nice of him not to complain about it too much.

Our reservation was on the top floor, seating 11 people.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nTapas\n- Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" (sauteed spanish sausage)\n- Albondigas (meatballs stew with saffron)\n- Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes)\n- Calamares A La Plancha (grilled calamari)\n- Mejillones A La Plancha (grilled mussels)\n\nPaella Rice Dish\n- Paella De Carnes (meat including chicken, pork ribs, chorizo) \n- Paella De Mariscos (seafood including calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels)\n\nDrinks\n- A couple Sangria pitchers\n\nMy favorite tapas were the spicy potatoes (it comes with a killer spicy orange sauce) and the grilled mussels (comes in a buttery sauce). They bring out an endless supply of bread, so dipping it in the leftover sauces made it even more delicious.\n\nThe paella takes about 30 minutes to make (they notify you before) so ordering a bunch of tapas is like ordering appetizers before your meal. The paella is a nice way to seal off your meal and getting you really full.\n\nThe Sangria was good, although I've had better. Needed more fruit. Overall it was a good experience and I'd take a couple friends or dates here.", "author": "Andrew C."}

There was a small crowd outside, but since we were just a party of 2, we were lucky enough to snag 2 seats upstairs. Upstairs, there was just one large party celebrating a birthday and a couple small tables, but boy, was it hot up there! They had 2 or 3 fans blowing though, which helped a little.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of sangria to start, which was delicious. Then we had the popular patatas bravas, which was outstanding as well-- the potatoes were very crispy and topped with a creamy, spicy, garlicky sauce. The spinach bechamel was lacking flavor-- even after adding salt, it was pretty forgettable. \n\nWe also ordered a paella, which takes 40 minutes for them to prepare. This was the most disappointing-- when it finally came out, the entire bottom was burnt! The burnt flavor pretty much permeated the entire dish, but we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for a new paella so we didn't bother telling anyone. Well, no one came by to check on us anyway, so we weren't too pleased with the service.", "author": "Kavita S."}

It's my and my wife's go-to place on many an afternoon in the Mission.\n\nBut today we came in and were ignored. The wait staff walked past us without even a glance or word. Should we seat ourselves? Wait to be seated? We finally sat ourselves at a three-top, and it pained me to notice that three tables were vacant but unbussed. By some miracle we were given menus. After ten minutes went by, I set the timer on my smartphone for 2 minutes, swearing to walk out if no one took our order. The timer went off, I stood to leave, but my wife resisted. This drama drew a waiter to our table and so we ordered. \n\n(Of course, I still remained without placemat or silverware, which I had to beg from another waiter.)\n\nOkay, it was a holiday. Perhaps they were short staffed. But I've worked in restaurants, from dishwasher to waiter, and you always ALWAYS do your best to make the guest feel welcome. \n\n\"Sorry, we're understaffed today.

Unfortunately I can not say the same thing about Esperanto.        They have an identical menu to Picaro, except each such is at least a dollar or two cheaper. Clearly the same recipes too. The cook really makes the difference. The gambas al ajillo only tasted of cooked wine. Morcella was bright red in the center. My husband really wanted the all meat paella and it was also not good. In fairness I have never had paella with meat. It's not paella with out seafood and I'm not even a big seafood eater. The rice tasted of tomatoes and was very mushy. The liquid was really greasy too. The worst part was the meat. Pork ribs need to be cooked for a long time. You can't put a raw one in with paella and expect it to be edible. For chicken they give you a flavorless chicken wing and only one. The whole dish had no flavor and looked really gross. I know it's a thing in the States to over cook rice but this was not even close. At least the  morcella was cooked through. It still wasn't good though! We also got the potatoes aioli. They were good but could not salvage this meal. Service was nonexistent. They never cleared a plate or refilled a glass. The guy with the curly hair darts around purposely trying to avoid his customers.        Most people seemed to be ordering the lunch special so maybe those are better.

Their spicy potato, calamari and the Serrano ham over french bread are great things to try here. You can order different sized paella based on how many people are in your party. The paellas do take a while to make though but there is note already telling you that on the menu ahead of time. The seafood paella in my opinion is the best, and is definitely worth the wait. You can pass time quickly with the tapas. The squid ink paella, as enticing as it sounds, is not as flavorful as its seafood counterpart but still pretty good. \n\nWe had reservations, and did not have to wait too long to be seated.

The patatas bravas were a nice level of spicy, and the potato skins were crispy and delicious. Garlic shrimp was also delicious and the sauce was perfect for dipping complimentary bread it. \n\nSangria was also good, but then again, I've never met a Sangria I didn't like. \n\nOverall totally tasty.

It was alright, I think I liked it more than he did. He did not complain though but he pointed that it was to fruity. Anyway, we were hungry so we got several dishes. We were impressed to see how fast the food arrived to the table. We had olives, morcilla, calamari and a salad. Calamari was the finest. We had to order a second one. For main course we got a paella and it was good, the only problem it was that it was barely warm. It had Spanish rice, clams, shrimp and mussels. It was quite dry, probably because it was not warm enough.

Granted we did choose to sit upstairs where it was stuffy on a warm day but we didn't mind too much. The worst part was that it was difficult to get our server's attention from up there and it took a while for our order to get taken. I guess that was kinda our fault but at least the food was above average AND affordable. I love tapas places for the fact that I can try a bunch of different dishes and Esperpento had tons of options! Now on to what we ate:\n\nsauteed garlic mushrooms ($5.25) - Big chunks of mushroom with lots of garlic flavor. This dish was gone fast! We used the sauce for dipping our bread in too. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=Jso-rnKSMgbKkcDs_YuUTg)\n\nspicy potatoes ($4.50) - Mmm one of my favorite plates of the night! The potatoes were cooked perfectly so that they weren't mushy or too firm. The spicy sauce was awesome! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=bw42o1VjAnN-6NfzpiFeHQ)\n\nroasted eggplant, peppers, and onion ($5.75) - Nothing special about this dish and was drenched in oil.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=nsT6WbjgnYJ--m1PUBxxEg)\n\nchicken croquettes ($5) - Crispy, fried pieces of yummy mashed potato but where was the chicken? Maybe it was minced so fine that I couldn't taste it. The spinach dip on the side was good too. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=NsosRB_HEyfx8zBoVaHbiQ)\n\nfried calamari ($6.50) - This was one of the smaller portions even though the rings of calamari were bigger than normal. They weren't breaded enough and the aioli was just OK. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=tdtbnLHPpOAMJ0h9BF7kdg)\n\nseafood paella ($68 for 6 person order) - WOW...this entree was humongous and could have fed more than 6! It came with succulent pieces of lobster, shrimp, clam, and calamari. The rice was delicious and flavorful too...might have been a tad over-cooked though. Prepare to wait about 30 min if you order paella. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/b3mmxh_9aw25vkMmujG9jQ?select=AOv2DMSCLUkdy_HRDKESWQ)\n\ncreme brulee ($4) - Bleh! This was pretty horrible creme brulee. First of all, the dish wasn't even filled to the top like it usually is. The layer of torched sugar was non-existent and the cream underneath didn't taste remotely like creme brulee. Don't order this!

It should've been placed on the side of the plate.\n\nWe ordered the pork skewers which had really inconsistent cooking times - the stick my girlfriend got was basically raw...they insisted on us sending it back to grill some more and it came back over done. Kind of disappointing. \n\nThey also have the worst Spanish rice I've ever eaten. Some of the rice wasn't even cooked all the way and you can tell that they used frozen vegetables that made the dish extra bland and unappealing. The waitress was a bit deceiving when we asked her how big the rice plates were, she said it was small so we ordered two for the both of us and it turned out to be way too much. \n\nI do have good things to say though. The Almejas A La Plancha (grilled garlic clams) were phenomenal, I wish the plate didn't have to end. The grilled baby artichokes were also amazing. I just wish that the rest of the plates we ordered were consistent!\n\nI will be staying at Picaro from now on!", "author": "Rachel W."}

I recommend going on Mondays where they have discounts on the paella.  They also sell imported products from Spain.  Very good service.  Place can get crowded and you may have to wait outside.

It was a beautiful Saturday night and we were a table of 6 people. We ordered plenty of food so his behavior was not justified. Three quarters a way into our dinner, he began circling our table like a shark, waiting for our next move to see how long it would take us to get up and out. We saw him yelling at our waitress to tell her to get us to leave. We certainly did not appreciate the pressure and push to get the hell out of there so that he could seat more people and get more $200 tabs paid.

My brother-in-law had a craving for tapas and we were celebrating my new job, so we ended up here.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, the owner looked me and said \"You're with the Adrian party, no? They're upstairs!\"  I was quite impressed, as I literally did not say a word when I walked in, but perhaps because my sister and I look so alike he figured it was a right match.  Maybe he just got lucky, but in any case, it made me think he really pays attention to his customers, which is great.\n\nWe ordered Gambas al ajillo  (shrimp w/ garlic sauce), jamon serrano, patatas aioli, spinach bechamel, grilled asparagus, chorizo, white bean salad, and sauteed anchovies on bread.  They bring you a big basket of delicious bread and a ton of packets of butter to start.\n\nHonestly, I loved every bite of food I had.  The chorizo was super flavorful, the aioli on the potatoes was great, and I loved the garlic sauce for the shrimp.  The white bean salad was nice and refreshing with its slightly acidic dressing, which helped cut the richness of a few other dishes.    I could pop those chorizos in my mouth all night long.  Same with the shrimp and potatoes.  Awesome!\n\nThe most amazing part is that with those dishes plus 2 bottles of wine, the whole bill came out to less than $90.  That's right, feeding 5 people comfortably for under $90?! That's really unheard of in most places.\n\nThe service was really friendly, and I liked that the owner came by a couple times to ask us how things were going.

I kind of have mixed feelings about Esperpento.\n\n4 stars for the service, 3 stars for all around experience.\n\nWe were seated upstairs at a table that was setup for about 18 people to sit comfortably.  They had setup 14 chairs and we had to wait a while for someone to find us a few more chairs.  Upstairs felt like a sauna and everyone was feeling the heat.  Our waiter was excellent.  I had ordered the paella ahead of time as it takes about 45 minutes to make.  I put in the order for the tapas after we had got comfortable.  The waiter recommended we order three of each tapas along with the two types of paellas and one meat platter.  We ended up ordering a total of 21 orders of tapas; 7 dishes, 3 of each.  We also had a total of 5 pitchers of sangria. The amount of food was PERFECT for the 20 of us.  I think we could've eaten more, but it was way too hot.  The food came out in a timely manner, which we were happy about.\n\nTapas (I don't remember the correct names on the menu):\nSpicy potatoes: 5 stars.  This is one of their popular dishes and it was definately the most popular at the tables.  Fried small pieces of potatoes smothered in a buffalo wing type sauce.\nPotatoes with garlic mayo: 4 stars.  Prepared just like the spicy potatoes but with a garlic mayo sauce.\nOxtail:  4 stars.  It was tender and the consistency of the gravy was perfect.  \nGarlic shrimp:  5 stars.  This was another favorite.  Small shrimp cooked in a garlic butter sauce.  Spicy and salty and delicious with the house bread.\nDeep fried snapper: 3.5 stars.  Typical fried fish served with a creamy sauce\nCalamari: 4 stars.  calamari sauteed with a tasty sauce cooked to perfection\nClams in spanish sauce: 3 stars.  Small clams cooked in a orange sauce.  The sauce tasted good with the bread.\n\nPaella: \nSeafood: 3 stars.  Most of us didn't like it too much.  It was too fishy.\nMeat:  3.5 stars.  It was decent, but not the best we've had.\n\nMeat platter: 4 stars. Huge platter of meat ranging from grilled chicken to kabobs to chorizo. It was a lot better than the first time I came here.  All the meat was cooked perfectly.\n\nSangria: 4 stars.  We all thought it was a lot better than cha cha cha's sangria. Sweet and not watered down.\n\nWe brought a cake to have for the birthday boy.  I didn't know how Esperpento handles cake so I brought my own plastic forks, plates, and knife.  They charge a cake fee of $1 per person.  You'd think they would cut your cake for you right? WRONG.  Instead, they brought up the plates I had brought, kept my plastic forks and brought up their own spoons, and didn't cut the cake for us at all.  Why is a cake fee charged if there is no service for it?! Totally not cool.\n\nAnyways, our total bill including gratuity came out to be about $510.  After dinner, a couple of my gf's and I used the bathroom.  As we stood there waiting, the workers would gawk and stare as girls walked in and out to and from the bathroom.  Pretty uncomfortable.  Oh, there's also guys who come in singing and playing traditional spanish music on their guitars.  It's cool when they come in and sing and we don't mind when they ask for tip, but it gets a quite uncomfortable when they just stand there for a few minutes at your table waiting for money.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}

We were pleasantly surprised when they said they could seat us in 5 minutes!  They took us the smaller side room (you actually have to leave the restaurant and walk outside) where we sat right next to the window.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we decided to order a few different tapas to share.  This was a GREAT choice.  We ordered five different tapas, which was more than enough food.  We had (ordered most fave to least fave): patatas bravas, Catalonian sausage, garlic chicken, fried calamari and the tortilla de patata (aka spanish omelette with potato).  Now even though I list these from most favorite to least favorite, they were ALL great!  The sauce on the patatas bravas was amazing the potatoes were cooked perfectly.  The Catalonian sausage slices were served on pieces of french bread, which was a great combination.  The garlic chicken was flavorful & moist.  The calamari was fried perfectly, not too chewy and had a tasty aioli dipping sauce.  Finally, the tortilla really brought be back to visiting Spain and felt lighter than the other dishes we had.\n\nAll in all, the food and service were fantastic.  Both the hostess who seated us and our waitress were really friendly and attentive.  Our food came out amazingly fast and   was, as described, delicious.

At first I really liked it because of the atmosphere, paella and especially their sangria. But then I realized that all they serve is actually frozen food or lets say pre-prepared food and all they do is put it in the microwave. \n\nThe paella takes like 30 minutes which is ok since that is what it normally takes anywhere, the paella is not good. Compared to others that I have tried in Spain and Puerto Rico, not good. But I guess people don't really care much. I also order croquetas and all those small portions or tapas that there is which is pretty ok since they are like fried little empanadas, not bad. \n\nBut when it comes to ordering those dinner combinations in the middle of the menu you must know the following. For instance, I ordered the Garlic Shrimp with rice and salad. They DO NOT clean the shrimp, plus they are the same size than the ones you can buy in a baggy in Safeway, not even jumpo real shrimps plus dirty as hell, they don't cut them open. So I had to one by one cut them open, clean them and then eat. This was a turn off, why? because if you are offering the same shrimps that you can buy in Sakeway special baggies, at least get the ones that are clean, which by they way are the same price. \n\nThe rice, not even start with that. Completely rice from the box, Their yellow rice is totally one of those Hambuger Helper rice boxes. Not kidding! When the server comes to check on everything I kindly tell him that the shrimps were not cleaned that I wasn't just letting him know so that he can pass it to the manager, he says \"I guess the germs or dirt goes away when you cook them\"  not an excused! \n\nSangria is always really good. That is all I can say. Oh! and I don't think I am bringing anyone else to this restaurant! Too expensive for just FROZEN FOOD :(", "author": "Ibelig V."}

(even tho the b/f was a lil bitter about me choosing a SPANISH place since his Mexican pride was hurt (yea yea put history behind Spanish took over Mexico awhile ago)).  \n\nANYWHO...  onto the PROS:\n1. environment-  i liked the vibe/decor lots of ppl chatting\n2. decent prices-tapas are between $4-9\n3. satisfying tapas w. perfect, if not a lil large than expected portions\n4. decent service- attentive enough esp. since it was busy\n\nCONS:\n1. disappointed w/ portion for grilled artichokes \n($5.5 maybe 8 2cm thick slices)\n\n2. Sangria-  IMO tasted like red wine; lacked fruitiness- but really, everyone else on Yelp seemed to like it, so it could be just me.  i like mine fruity n chilled.\n\nWHAT I CONSUMED:\n1. Garlic Shrimp- so simple yet good.  the garlic & red pepper infused oil goes perfectly w/the bread that comes w/all tapas  \n\n2. Potatas Bravas- sauce reminds me of La Vics!  ya'll SJ ppl know what im talking about.  cubed fried potatoes were good, not great.\n\n3. Fried Calamari-  small portion for the price $6.5. 8 pieces at most.  glistening in grease which inevitably made them soggy in no time (and hey, i do like grease but not this)\n\n4. Grilled Salmon w. Aioli-  nice portion ~6 thin strips and i loved the grilled red onions that came with it\n\n5. Grilled Artichokes w. garlic & parsley- scrumptious yet the outer edges are rough n can't be eaten so have fun spitting them out while ur eating!  but it's worth the effort.\n\nDAMAGE:  5 tapas, 1 glass of Sangria, 1 coke= $40 + tip  ... NOT bad.\n\nOVERALL,  I would come back..  I want the paella, but for $26 for 2 ppl (plus everything else i wanna order)?  i'll have to hold off on that for a month!  In conclusion, Yes, it is loud.  Yes, service isn't the best , but WTH, it IS a low-key place, and the tapas come at great price.", "author": "Kimberly C."}

It really pains me to leave this review, but people need to know. This is NOT the Esperpento of old. I haven't been here in 3-4 years, and it's really changed.  I don't know if they've changed owners or what, but it was pretty bad.\n\nA little background: I've been coming here for years. This used to be my favorite place for reasonably-priced Spanish food. I can't say it was the best Spanish food in the Bay Area, but I always felt it was very solid for the price. And the informal, lively atmosphere really reminded me of the tapas bars of Spain. I've been to Spain numerous times, and my girlfriend's family is from Galicia. I've had amazing Spanish food, and I've been to just about every Spanish place in the Bay Area. I know it will never be the same over here in the US, but I've had solid renditions of classic dishes at other restaurants (Zarzuela, for example).\n\nUgh...so where to start with this place. The food was so sub-par, it was embarrassing. I actually picked up the tab for my party of 5, because I felt ashamed for having suggested the place. So here's my take on the dishes:\n\n--pimientos de padron: decent, but not great. I've had better in the Bay Area (let alone Spain).\n--ensalada mixta: again decent, but not great. Definitely smaller portion than before.\n--calamares a la plancha: absolutely horrible! This used to be my favorite dish there. But it was chewy and bland. The calamari were clearly frozen. Nobody at my table liked it.\n--judias verdes rebozadas: stringy and inedible. How the hell do you screw up green beans?\n--paella de mariscos: horrible. Oily and with the same, disgusting calamari as mentioned above. My girlfriend and I looked, and could not find a single strand of saffron in the dish. \n--patatas bravas that were mediocre\n--some chicken dish that was not memorable\n--some mushroom dish that was dialed-in\n\nSorry, but I just can't give a damn about this place anymore. The best part was that they had some decent Galician white wines (including a good Albarino). I was excited about the Godello, but they were out of it....at 8 pm on a Friday. Whatever.\n\nThe service was ok, but that really doesn't matter when the food is so bad. They actually took a half-finished dish away from us when the paella arrived. We felt rushed. I get that this is the Mission and you want to turn over tables quickly, but don't take our food away. That just makes me growly.\n\nGoodbye, Esperpento...never again! You make me sad with your \"Spanish\" food.", "author": "Brett L."}

We are full for the night.. and.. uh.. we are booked.\n\nMe: Looking at a few empty tables, I said.. ok.. really?\nEmployee: Yeah. It's busy.. we are totally booked for the night.\n\nI looked around the restaurant in confusion, because something didn't feel right... I felt like he was discriminating against me because I was alone, and he was thinking he could make more money if he were to sit more people at a single table, but I ruled that out, because I saw other people who had a table for one.\n\n(a couple walks in within 5-10 seconds)\n\nCouple: Hi, table for 2?\nEmployee: Oh.. do you have a reservation?\n\nCouple: No\nEmployee: well it's going to be a while, maybe 45 minutes.. is that okay?\n\nCouple: that's fine\nEmployee: okay, well let me get your name and number (he then took their name and number)\n\nSo the couple asked me how long my wait was, and I told them.. \"well he refused to sit me\".. they looked surprised, and said.. \"hey! maybe we should eat together -- table for 3! :D\". I totally wanted to, because I was so excited to try this place, but they looked like they were on a date-night thing, so as friendly and awesome as they seemed, I decided to just eat somewhere else, in fear that.. they might serve all of us some tainted food.\n\nThen, right after _that_ couple walked in.. another party came in.. i think for a party of 3.. and the dude got THEIR number and information and told them it would be about 45 minutes!!\n\nI then asked the employee:  So, are you still booked?  Because you just told that couple it would be 45 minutes.\nEmployee: Yeah, we're booked, we have another restaurant on 6 blocks from here.. i can give you their card... \n\nMe:  No. No thanks.. I think I'll just find somewhere else to eat.\n\nSo unhappy, and quite honestly, just disappointed that I had to encounter someone like that while on my vacation.

I am reviewing dishes based off of memory.\n\nSetting: My coworkers and I met up with a mutual friend in San Francisco for dinner.  We had already had 3 IPAs prior to meeting up so any where would've been fine.  As luck would have it the decided restaurant was effing amazing!\n\nGeneral Thoughts: Slight higher than average price wise but WELL WORTH IT.\n\nDetail Thoughts: 4 of had a reservation for 8:30 PM PST.  We arrived and were almost promptly seated (slightly delayed due to high demand on a Wednesday evening).  Upon sitting we ordered a few tapas to hold us over along with a bottle of Cava and I also ordered a side brew...Estrella Damm and yes it was necessary!  As far as the tapas were concerned we ordered some churizos, abondigas, shrimp and a few others that I can not remember (apologies).  In any case they were all AMAZING.  My wife and recently went to Barcelona and as such I am a bit of an expert here.  The abondigas generally my favorite tapas were fantastic.  The churizos which I rarely order might be my new favorite, well at least at Esperpento!  In any case as the night progressed so did our buzz.  What a great night so far.  To cap off the night we ordered a bottle of sangria and a huge bowl of seafood paella.  The sangria was a bit too sweet for me so I won't comment much there but it did the job.  It kept me occupied for the required 45 minutes before the paella arrived.  Boy did it arrive in style.  I'm talking a HUGE pan roughly a foot and a half in diameter which lots of fresh seafood on top.  From the clams, to the shrimp, to the scallops this thing was a marvel and guess what it was DELICIOUS TOO!  All in all, I highly recommend this place.

This restaurant is amazing!!!!\n\nIt is very easy to find and there is a parking garage across the street with plenty of parking and good prices so that's a plus for San Francisco. \n\nThe restaurant is dark and romantic with Spanish decor adorning the walls. The staff is very friendly and attentive. There was alot of other diners in the restaurant with us but the staff always made sure we had what we needed. \n\nNow for the food, it was nothing short of amazing. Just like my grandma used to make. I felt like I was in Spain not SF. We ordered the croquetas de pollo, potatas bravas, calamari, and the Paella De Mariscos. It was great. I had the flan for dessert. Not only is the food great so are the prices. You can feel free to order as much as you want without burning a hole in your pocket. The paella, which was the most expensive thing, was $26.00 for two people but it was big. My husband and I couldn't finish it so we had a great lunch the next day. \n\nIf you are looking for great food, great service, and ambiance this is a great place to try. This place is great for a large group or a romantic date. It is great to get away and have something different. I will be back.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Then we ordered everything at the same Tim ( two dishes croquet  sand pallea) and it didn't come out till 10.20!!!!!!! We asked them 5 x and still the same amount of time.

The place was packed (Saturday night) and we waited outside for about thirty minutes. It was a nice warmish night and i had great company so really did not mind. \n\nThe tables were a bit too close together and every time the couple sitting behind me shared a kiss or a hug I felt like i was part of it. and It was weird to say the least. After a couple of glasses of Sangria we all found it pretty hysterical though. \n\nOK here I go: \n- Sangria: not the best I've had. When it comes to Sangria I will stick to Dali (Boston). The sangria at Esperpento was not cold enough to my liking and did not have fruits - at least not the pitchers we got. \n\nWe went there with another couple so I got to sample a few treats: \n\n- Patatas Bravas: these were addictive. WOW the couple we went here with recommended we tried them and they did not disappoint! one of my favorite plates there. \n\n- Another favorite was the Grilled Trout. The seasoning was amazing and the fish was cooked to perfection. \n\n- Next I tried a combination plate which included Beef Cutlet Milanesa \nwith a side of rice and salad. This was also exquisite. \n\nHaving been to multiple tapas places in the Boston area, I was really impressed with Esperpento. The food tasted amazing, and the prices extremely reasonable.

It was one of the rare times we dropped off the kids at her parents' SF house to share a simple lunch for two.  So I recalled my wife's raised eyebrows while watching Esperpento featured on the above mentioned TV show.\n\nThe fact that Valencia Street was closed to vehicular traffic and paved the way for street musicians seemed to set the scene for a perfect seating of tapas and paella.  Yes, order your paella early because the prep and cook time understandably takes 30 minutes, but to us it was worth it.\n\nSo we ordered the same tapas we've ordered in Marbella, Madrid, and SF restaurants for years:  a carafe of sangria, white anchovy in garlic and olive oil, roasted artichokes, calamari, and enough bread to sop up all the tasty sauces or olive oil.  This time we we added Esperpento's well known spicy potatoes (patatas bravas).  The spice was mild to medium but has a slow warming effect causing the eventual napkin-to-brow maneuver.  Everything else was well presented, served in timely waves, and certainly brought us back to another time and Spanish or Algarve Region place.  I'm certain the third glass of Sangria helped, too.\n\nWe were so full after we polished off our tapas plates that we politely asked our table service team (primo service btw) to package our \"turist\" mixed chicken and seafood paella to take home.  So we missed out on the owner's paella pan presentation, as we witnessed at other tables, but were not disappointed when we got home.  The 10x14x5 inch foil tin was still piping hot when we got to our kids and their grandparents.  So as you can imagine, we had a quick second-wind lunch, and the kids and my in-laws were well fed!\n\nI should mention that the lady with the castanets was a charming touch in setting the atmosphere, so I'm glad I had a few bucks in my pocket.\n\nNo complaints from a very happy mom and her loving husband!", "author": "Rudy P."}

However, Esperpento sets itself apart because their tapas is pretty darn good and the prices are below average by far.\n\nThe restaurant is tucked into a small storefront on 22nd street just a couple blocks up from Mission Street.  They've packed a bunch of tables into the cozy, authentic space, but even so, you might have to wait for a bit on a weekend night before getting a table.  Calling ahead is definitely recommended.\n\nThe tapas menu is BIG compared to some of the other tapas places in the city.  There's ton's of choice.   Everything we ordered was really good:  I'd highly recommend the Patatas Bravas (can't ever go wrong), the vegetable paella, and the fried calamari.  Also, the grilled artichokes were very tasty and very original too.  I'd never had artichokes in this form and I was pleased.\n\nThe real kicker was that our group of 5 was in and out of the place with a bill well under $100 total, this after 5 or 6 tapas dishes and a couple pitchers of sangria.

After the anxiety and irritation from the noise and the loud singer started to subside, and the food started coming out, I was pleasantly surprised by the simple, yet delicious grilled asparagus and spicy potatoes dishes.  So my hopes were high for the lobster paella.  Too high?  I don't know, I think I was tricked by Danny L.  When it came out, it looked good.  The portion size was large. I was excited because I hadn't had paella since the paella lady left Oakland.  But the rice was soggy, and you couldn't taste the elements of seafood that was in there.  In fact, you couldn't taste much at all.  The the little garlic shrimp dish came out.  Hmm...garlic taste?  Where?  \n\nOnce the host passed us off to the servers, I was even more disappointed as I started intently at my empty glass of water.

We found ourselves in The Mission and hungry... at kind of an odd/late-ish lunch hour, this is where we ended up.\n\nI always try to drink the young Spanish vino here because it seems like the right place to ingest alcohol.  And then I remember that I'm (a) an Asian chick who (b) cannot metabolize alcohol and (c) weighs a buck and change - far too late and my cheeks are flushed, my head is spinning and I'm always on the cusp of doing something regrettable that might return, captured on film to haunt me.  So, this is the closest I ever feel to living my life as Darin I. for a few hours.  \n\nForgive the brusque run down; the menu is rather large and we've sampled a fair number of their staples.  Anyhoo:\n\nThe patatas alioli - wish they were crispier and the garlicky mayo served on the side... but that doesn't stop me from shoveling them into my mouth.  But it's definitely a brush-and-floss as soon as you can situation; best to pack some breath mints.\n\nManchego - served COLD in a drizzle of olive oil with a resigned marinated pepper in the middle.  Disappointing, because this cheese really is delicious - I prefer to eat it with membrillo, which they do not offer, which is a pity.\n\nAlbondigas - we like to scoop the saffron-jacked sauce up with pieces of bread; the meatballs themselves, not so much.  I think they are heavy and dense for my taste.\n\nAlcochofas (artichokes) a la plancha:  these are actually special; thin sliced baby artichokes with garlic and olive oil... we order these every time; they're lovely.\n\nCalamares fritos: this dish is delicately battered and served with a big side of alioli.  The Caveman never regrets putting tentacles in his mouth when this plate arrives at the table.  (I said tentacles, not testicles, Darin!)\n\nChorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" - ordered it once and hardly touched it; refer to my pic - they looked like smoky links and tasted very much like something my WASPy Mother would try to pass off as an actual appetizer after zapping a package in the microwave.  Icky.  \n\nGambas al Ajillo:  The shrimp was frozen and/or waaaaay overcooked, drowned in garlic and olive oil.  This is a very simple dish that can be such an epiphany with fresh ingredients; a real disappointment.  \n\nRopa Vieja... the ingredients in this stew were overcooked and their flavors muddled; the beef component was tough and made it difficult to enjoy the dish.  Ditto for the adobo stew we had a few visits back.\n\nQuail a la plancha - I was really looking forward to this tapa, but the quail was so small and... not plump; I had a difficult time attempting to cut any of the meat off the bird.  I felt almost defeated because I hardly got a taste of the actual dish; it was kind of an exercise in futility.  \n\nThe portions are generous and it's best to go with a group so that you can share.  It's emotionally difficult for me to concede that the food is pretty middle of the road because they don't feature seasonal specialties, which is what I'd rather have them do.  Smaller menu, with in-season highlights, instead of a vast selection that depends upon frozen and otherwise stabilized ingredients.  \n\nI'm skewing high in my rating of this place; I'm a bit sentimental about it.  This was the first restaurant that the Caveman and I ate up here together, before we signed the papers for our loft (and just a few weeks before we got hitched)... So... there you go.

The place is insane now however the bulk of the food is here and I concentrate on that.\n\nThe memorables:\n\nTortilla Espanola - best I've had yet of the number of times I've had this\nOxtail Stew\nRabbit Stew\nGrilled Artichokes\nAlbondigas\n\nThe decents:\n\nPaellas Mariscos\nEggplant\nGrilled Asparagus\nSpinach bechamel \n\nSo overall the veggie dishes weren't as good as the others. The old guy who was our waiter seemed a bit aloof too but the other staff were pretty friendly. The place is definitely cheaper than most places I've been so it's a good value.

The decor seemed somewhat dull, dark and dated. The servers looked like they'd rather be elsewhere. The complimentary French bread was nothing fancy, although the Salsa Brava they served it with was good. The Jamon Serrano en Pan con Tomate was more like 'Sin Tomate'. It was a slice of prosciutto laid on top of the same dull French bread with a thin, flavorless olive oil spread, no tomatoes in sight and a red bell pepper on top. When I mentioned my confusion to the server at not seeing any tomatoes (and being surprised at the strong red pepper taste instead -of which I'm not a huge fan), she mentioned that they stopped serving the tomato part of the dish over a year ago. Then, she must've chatted with her fellow server about it, because he, too, came over to try to tell me the tomatoes were in the thin, flavorless olive oil spread. \n\nThe Ropa Vieja was slightly better, but nothing to write home about. I ended up dipping all of my bread in its sauce, because I was pretty desperate for something with flavor at this point. The mushrooms were pretty good, but again, the presentation was nonexistent. Just mushrooms in a bowl. \n\nLastly, we ordered the seafood paella, which we thought might make up for the mediocrity we'd experienced so far. We had to wait 30 minutes for it, so it must be good, right? Nope. It was completely flavorless. Sticky, saffron rice with a couple of peas and some seafood that all tasted as bland as the rice. \n\nThe only good thing about our experience was that it didn't break the bank. For a tapas place, it was very reasonably priced. \n\nOur meal was topped off by us getting to watch our server drag on a cigarette on the sidewalk outside our window seat. Check Please, Bay Area let us down.", "author": "B F."}

I'd say every dish that we've gotten here was great, from vege options (like the grilled beans and potatoes), to the seafood.  The paella was really good too...I hate when a paella just sucks bad (like the paella place in Beldin Place in the city), but this one had me scraping the plate clean.  note: the paella here is hit or miss, lately mainly misses...i can't tell if its better on non busy nights.   The sangria is also one of the best I've had hands down.  The guy that works the front door is a nutjob and funny, and the staff is super nice and friendly.  \n\nThis place is a madhouse, I don't think there is an organizational chart for the tables, its loud as hell, and it feels like I'm in some alley in Spain...super crowded on weekends so be prepared to wait.  The only downside is the occasional street performer coming in...I just want to eat and talk to my friends, not have you sing above me and then ask me for money...it's already loud in there, and this leads to a screaming table convo.  But then again it adds to the crazy...hmmm now I don't know what to think.  Anyway, for a fun, cheap, and tasty place that screams SF Mission, this is a staple for our out of town guests.\n\nEdit: I come here a lot, but the quality of the paella has been inconsistent...when it comes out overcooked, colorless, and bland (you can tell simply by looking at paella how it will taste), I get really sad because it's what I look forward to the most here.  4 stars unless the paella gets fixed!", "author": "A A."}

We walked in to Esperpento, and it was surprisingly packed on the Thursday before Christmas.  We waited for about 25 minutes - unfortunately, it looked like they were pretty short staffed with one hostess (who doubled as a waitress on a occasion) and one waiter.

The waiter refused to let us since the second carafe would get warm but promised to bring out a second one as soon as we finished the first (he did).  \n\nThe menu at Esperpento is extensive - almost too many choices.  We stuck with tapas and ordered seven dishes.  Yes, I realize that was too many, but my friend insisted that we have a wide variety to taste and try.  The waiter repeatedly warned us to reduce the number of dishes we ordered - we didn't listen.  We plowed through ~2/3 of our food and were absolutely stuffed. We ordered the stewed rabbit, pollo adobo, mini sausages, patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, green beans and chicken croquettes.  Of those, I think my favorites were the pollo adobo, stewed rabbit and patatas bravas (mostly because potatoes with yummy aioli-like sauce is almost always tasty).

It could've been the food or it could've been the herbal supplements prior to our dinner.\n\nRegardless, the food was great and the place was PACKED!\n\nFirst we ordered two tapas: potato and onion omelet and chicken adobo. The omelet was lovely! Nice and fluffy served with a dollop of some sort of garlic aioli. The chicken adobo was pretty good though I wasn't thoroughly convinced.\n\nAfter our tapas, we ordered the seafood paella. It was good, but doesn't quite live up to the standard of my mother's paella. I'm going to go so far as to call it a \"suitable substitution\" for when my mommy's paella is not available.\n\nThen, for some reason, my friend decided to order another tapas: grilled salmon strips. Which I am so happy he did. I could not get over how good this dish was. I'm not a huge fan of fish (other than sushi), but I seriously loved the salmon. Despite being crazy full, I wanted more of it.\n\nAnd as a nice little end to our meal, a serving of chocolate mousse. Smooth and decadent served with fresh whipped cream.\n\nOverall, I would say that the paella is overrated and stick to the tapas, but am definitely willing to come here again. Even for just that damn salmon and chocolate mousse.", "author": "Gabbie G."}

Unfortunately we  had to stand outside the restaurant during this time as they have no waiting space. \n\nThere were eleven of us and they sat us upstairs. Unfortunately, we were sat at a table that would have been more comfortably accommodating for eight people. We were literally shoulder to shoulder in mismatched chairs and one of my friends was sat uncomfortably on the corner of the table as the ends weren't available due to the cramped nature of the upstairs area. \n\nService was decent. Our server was around to take our order, responded promptly with our first round of beverages and appetizers, but never seemed to be around when our water was depleted which was often due to the warmth of the restaurant and how cramped we were into our table.\n\nThe food was good - we had numerous tapas including the grilled artichokes (yum), garlic shrimp (tasty - dip your bread into the buttery sauce), grilled mussels and potatoes with aioli (sinful but delicious). They all arrived around the same time and were portioned well enough for many of us to share (3 people per plate). \n\nThe paella requires about a 30 minute advanced notice. We ordered  a couple of meat and seafood, an all meat and an all seafood. \n\nI only had the opportunity to try the meat and seafood but I will say, it's definitely more seafood than meat. There were (i think) four chunks of chicken and beef each  but many muscles and shrimp scattered about as well as calamari bits. The beef was quite disappointing though - seemed more bone than actual edible parts. \n\nIt might be different for a smaller group - the party of six crammed in right behind us seemed to be doing okay, and the parties of two around the restaurant seemed to be having a great time.

I felt suffocated and uncomfortable at the top. \n\nAlthough, the food was a bit pricey (total came out to $40/each), the wait was well worth it. Our party had ordered the lobster paella after our awesome waitress had suggested it over the \"Turista\". I guess, from what she had told my sister, that although the Turista *is* good, it is not as good as the Longosta. Reason being, that the Turista has different flavors mixed into it (pork, lobster, crap, chicken, etc). I suppose she was right because the lobster dish was pretty good.  \n\nWe ordered several tapas. Some we're good. Some we're great. None we're bad. They served an eggplant tapa (I forgot the name) that was my favorite of all of them. \n\nWe also ordered three pitchers of Sangria (one was just not enough).

I think the most expensive bottle of wine they had on the menu was $23. \n\nThe artichokes are to die for and also get the potasas bravas - so spicy and delish.

At 8 the owner saw the name on the birthday card on top of the gift I was holding for my friend and said that he reserved the private room next to the main restaurant dining area. I'm pretty sure that room was empty the entire time. Why did they not seat us earlier!? It was freezing outside =( \n\nThe owner was super nice and friendly. My bf and I sat and waited for everyone else to show up. There was a huge moth crawling all over the wall which was gross and later there were little flies flying around our food. \n\nOur waiter was completely, completely, completely, useless. I ordered the clams in marinara because I wanted something with marinara sauce. Obviously its different in Spain or wherever because they came in a tomatoey watery broth. The clams were pathetic by the way.  They were the tiniest things I've ever seen and every single one had sand in them. My uncle cooks really cheap clams all the time and somehow his doesn't have sand in them so it can't be that hard to remove it. I also happen to be allergic to shellfish so when I do eat it, I like it to be worth my weeks worth of suffering that will ensue. What a waste. \n\nI also ordered the garlic shrimp, something I read the chef was known for. I was halfway through eating the oily shrimp when I realized a lot of them weren't deveined. So fucking gross. Are you kidding me? I sent them back and this was mid meal and when the bill came, the waiter still said nothing. We asked him about it and all he said was that the chef doesn't like to devein them because they are so small and they will get smaller if he deveins them. Wow. Basically the chefs are conning you into thinking the shrimps are bigger by not deveining them. I can see why they would do that because the shrimp was super tiny to begin with. I can't believe he didn't say anything to begin with, didn't replace it, didn't comp it, and took my plate away even though there was still a few deveined shrimp on it. Why would he not say something?!? He was so incompetent. He is lucky it was a birthday dinner that had preadded gratuity and we didn't want to make a scene. \n\nIt doesn't help that everyone decided to split the bill 8 ways even though my bf and I ordered far less food than everyone else and I didn't drink any of the sangria they ordered.

It's the kind of place you can go to and know what you're going to get and how it will be; the type of restaurant you make your standby when you aren't in the mood to fight for a table or try something too crazy.\n\nIronically, though they can accommodate groups very easily, I wouldn't recommend it as the restaurant is so loud it's hard to hear what is being said more than 2 chairs away from you. \n\nGreat place for a first date, though! You both can find something you like and eat as little or as much as you want without being obvious about it. You can also be as fancy or as casual and you want without standing out.", "author": "Ryan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-30", "description": "This is my most frequented restaurant of all time. I really love this place and it continues to be one of my favorite places in the city. I've been coming here for about 5 years, so please trust my judgement on this. This might not be the fanciest, most delicious, best service and best decorated place in the city, but it is so well rounded in all those aspects that it makes for the ideal place to frequent. \n\nLocation: It's in a great location; walking distance from bars, shopping, a movie theater and events. Tons to do before and after dinner. Pretty easy to get to, too. Since it's right off bart, it's a good place to have dinner with non-San Franciscan Bay Area dwellers.\n\nAmbience: Such a mixed crowd, you really never know who the hell is going to be in here. From birthday parties to dates, from homos, hipsters, and annoying Marina people and everything in between, this place calls to many types.\n\nSpace: I actually really like the decor. The walls are filled with Miro, Picaso, and Dali. The tones are really warm, but at the same time, there's something grungy and authentically edgy about it, very Spain. The tables are waiting with carnations and the plates are colorful. \n\nService: You might have to get used to the service. I personally love the staff here, specially Maria Jose. They are humorous and you have to be able to keep with them. They're pretty attentive.\n\nFood/Drink: There a very wide selection of tapas. Something for everyone. You can literally bring anyone here because they will find something they like on the menu. The tapas are not artisan and they're not the best ones you'll ever have. But they're delicious, brought out pretty fast and have good servings. They are definitely worth the price. The Sangria here is some of the best I've ever had, and I'm including Spain. It's dark and sweet and gets you wasted before you know it.\n\nPrice: This is one of the main reasons I go here. It's some of the least expensive good dining experiences in the city. If you want non-diner experience at a good price and have fun, come here. Everything is priced very reasonably (if you're a San Franciscan). Brunch time is particularly affordable.\n\nOverall: Pretty good place to go, specially with a large group of friends. I really enjoy coming here every time.", "author": "SF N."}

However, from previous outings to Espy, these things are the shiznit.  Reconfirmed by the four stuffed faces who couldn't actually verbalize it.\n\nMushrooms - So yummers.  Perfect amount of doneness.  Like, between just picked at Joshua Tree and just picked up a can at Grocery Outlet, matched perfectly with a little oil and garlic.\n\nOlives stuffed with anchovies - Surprisingly little 'chovy saltiness.  Well done.\n\nGrilled Trout entree - Fish was super yummy, with a crispy skin.  You can't get all of the bones out of a trout.  It's inevitable that they pass through your lips, as those of you who are avid trout eaters like myself will understand.  There weren't that many, so it was obvious they tried.  A for effort.\n\nRioja (bottled of red wine): Very mellow and delicious.  Not overly fruity, with a hint of caramel finish, it was lovely.\n\nShoot, I forget the bottle of white that we had: At first sip, it was super cold and crisp.  As it opened, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Recommend highly, er, this whats-its-name white wine.\n\nSome tortilla thing puffed with egg:  Looked good.  Didn't eat it.\n\nMole beef something or other: Went like hotcakes.  Looked absolutely delicious in a thick and creamy sauce.\n\nAtmosphere.  If you can, sit downstairs, where at least you get cool air coming in from the numerous folks finding their way to a table and the ceiling fans.  Sitting upstairs is hot, with little air circulation.\n\nOh, and MINUS one star to the host/seater dude who had the nerve to ask us how much longer we thing we'd be, as there was another group waiting for our table.

They never had us waiting while we had our bread served and replenished as we transitioned to the patatas bravas (spicy potatoes, which I would definitely try again next time - sauce was mesmerizing for taste).  After that, choice of entree for the evening was seafood. Had the shrimp tapas (gambas al ajillo) and they were scrumptious.  You can start ignoring the butter and dip the bread into the tapas' (patatas y gambas) mouth-watering sauce.  I'm glad I saved my tummy for the next dish as we tried the lobster paella.  Palatable; shrimps, squid, oysters, green beans over lemon and good carbs?  Totally hit the spot.  They keep up to their word, the price is absolutely enough for 2 or more.  And they're one of the best deals you can try from this restaurant.  \n\nI must have had one too many sangrias, but I actually enjoyed it.  Next time when I come back I may want to try their version of calamares fritos (being a big fan of calamari) and the other paellas.  There is enough serving for every entree, and this joint would definitely be a preferable place to bring good friends to wrap the evening up (or start for some of you party peeps).

On the menu it says \"one of the most popular spanish tapas.\" It tasted HELLA good and I'll def go back to Esperpento just. for. that.\n\nMy friend and I almost ordered a whole carafe of Sangria, but didn't because we had plans to drive to get some ice cream for dessert later on. [Attn: Do not drink and drive. ;)] We both enjoyed our own glass of Sangria.  Oh and let me tell you, the Sangria at Esperpento is a winner! Very yum + plenty strong. I had a light buzz going on in the early afternoon. Win! (But it def wore off after the Paella, which was perfect so we could proceed to our dessert destination safely.) :)\n\nWe also ordered the Pollo Adobo Tapa (A-) and it paired really well w/ the Tortilla Patata. (I was thinking that the Pollo Adobo might have also tasted good w/ some rice. But... that might only be the Filipina in me thinking that. lol. We Filipinos like rice w/ almost everything, especially w/ something as saucy as the Pollo Adobo. Mmm...)\n\nOur main course was the Lobster Paella for 2.  The portion of this dish is HUGE. Definitely plenty of food for 3 or even 4 people. (Note: We were a little full from the tapas, but even if we didn't have tapas, the paella would have been plenty of food, and we still woulda had leftovers.) I give the Lobster Paella a B+. It was a bit salty for my taste, but my friend liked it a lot and didn't think it was salty. Then I realized that she had squeezed like 3 lemon wedges on her plate of paella and I on the otherhand only squeezed a little bit. The lemon definitely balances out the flavor, but I didn't think it should've been as salty as it was.\n\nService here is good. Our server/waiter was very polite.  She even exchanged my dollar bills for quarters for the parking meter. Which reminds me, parking around this area kinda sucks.  We found a meter (1 hour limit) that was about a block away.  So halfway through our meal (right before the Paella arrived) I walked to the meter to feed it more quarters for an extra hour.  A little bit of a hassle, but it was a nice day, so I didn't mind.\n\nNext time I go back, I hope I can find a good parking spot w/o a meter. Or one that is longer than 1 hour. \n\nOh ya, FYI: we went around 2pm on a Sunday and it wasn't packed at all.", "author": "Grace G."}

Of the seafood picked off and replaced with meat because I found tons of calamari in it. Again, ONE OF THE PEOPLE AT THE TABLE COULD NOT HAVE SEAFOOD, which I tried to explain to them! Find the full story below. \n\nTo start, we had a reservation and didn't get seated for an hour after our reservation time, despite the constant stream of reassurance that ours table was being cleaned and was almost ready. Once in, we ordered paella and tapas. We were brought our tapas and our drinks fairly quickly- and that was the last we saw of our waitress for the majority of the night. No, \" how's everything?\", no asking if we needed more drinks, nothing. And what about the paella, one might ask? I was wondering the same thing. An hour had passed since ordering and we had finished all our tapas, but still no paella. Our waitress made her 2nd appearance of the night to bus our plates and tell us our paella would be right out. So we waited. And waited. And waited. We waited so long part of our party had to leave. ANOTHER HOUR PASSED- FINALLY our paella was brought out. Or so we thought. In front of us she laid a giant seafood paella- NOT the one we ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention she argued that that was the one we ordered and tried to convince us to keep it, despite the fact that  one of the people at the table cannot eat seafood. The only reason I did not cancel the whole order and leave right then was because I was with a friend who had their heart sat on the paella, so when she said it would be 5 more minutes for the correct one I reluctantly agreed. Eventually the correct paella was brought out( which\nI'm pretty sure wasn't even the right one still since I later found seafood in it!), but not before the rest of our plans for the evening were ruined for having spent over three hours at this place. Since part if our party had already left and the rest of us felt so full from sitting there so long the highly anticipated paella had about two bites taken from it before we packed it up for leftovers. \n\nWhen I went to the host to voice my displeasure with the service we had received my complaints were met with nothing but arguments and defensiveness. They offered us dessert, but I explained that we had spent long enough there and wanted to leave. I asked if they could do anything else for us and was met with a b.s. story about how they didn't have the key they would need to adjust a check but we would receive a \"big gift\" the next time we were there. When I tried to explain that that would do us no good because we don't live nearby he retorted with a rude comment about how he doesn't live nearby either but he managed to be there. \n\nI've never before had such poor service, never again!", "author": "Marissa C."}

I'm not sure what the normal consistency is but I wish it was slightly creamier....Just to warn you, that dish takes 30 minutes to prepare so order that first!

It was dry and needed some kind of sauce.\n\nThe oxtail stew?  I've had better.\n\nThe beef stew?  Ehhh.\n\nThe calamari?!  Don't even get me started...that thing was NOT fried, and not seasoned at all.\n\nEven though there were a few misses, this restaurant is definitely worth visiting.  The ambiance, the people, the servers were all very pleasant to be around.

Couldn't get enough.\n\n~Not sure if there's more than one squid dish, whether I had the calamari, but it was simple sauteed squid, not breaded, and I thought they did an amazing job of bringing out the essence of the squid's flavor. Juicy!\n\n~Blech, I cannot stand those big oysters in any format! Reminds me of testicles (sorry, patooey).\n\n~Garlic shrimp is helllllla good. Must order..along with the cabbage!\n\n~I don't think the potatoes were that good. I'm pretty picky about potatoes.\n\nI'm eating there for the 2nd time in a long time tonight, and came to Yelp to see what new things I should order. Everyone has to try the cabbage next time! Thanks to everyone whose reviews are on the first page, I'm gonna try the artichokes, which I've heard are rrrreally good, the oxtail, and the spinach. I want to eat it all! Can't wait to go with two of my favorite people, my couple friend K&J :)))\n\nSERVICE: Eh, but whatev. For this decor & prices, what do u expect? The girl on the phone was really nice!\n\nDECOR: Rustic\n\nBATHROOM: n/a\n\nOVERALL: Definitely my FAVORITE tapas place in the city!!! I'd say Esperpento for a good group meal to share everything family-style, simple rustic food, clean, hearty, filing, delicious. I'd say Bocadillos for fancy, high-end tapas. & Andalu for out-of-town visitors when you don't know where else to go.", "author": "miss b."}

It's a whole day later and I have still been reminisciening over how wonderful our night was. This was an experience. It brought back so many memories from my trip to Spain. All of the food was very authentic. The patatas bravas were SO flavorful. The cabbage, didn't taste like cabbage and had the most incredible flavors. Then there was the Ox tail stew. Let me tell this was delicious!! When I was in Spain we went off the beaten path to this small village and obscure family restaurant and had oxtail stew...this one was just as good if not better! The grilled muscles were mouth watering. Then we ordered the Mixed Paella, \"Turista\" style blended with Arroz Negros. I have never seen this on a menu since I was in Barcelona. It's rice stained with squid ink. The paella was yummy! The presentation of it is just so eye-appealing. Next time I would probably to make sure to have the garlic shrimp rather than the jumbo shrimp. I really want to try the Lobster paella, I bet it is amazing! You can't beat the prices. Our waitress was right on point, really friend and perfect timing for nearly everything. The management was awesome as well; they're really doing a great job. \n\nI was glad I had read another yelp review that the mariachi band comes and asks for a tip, because if I hadn't of known that it might have irritated me a bit more. The management explained to us that because the neighborhood is highly Latino, they go into all the restaurants whether it be Italian, Mexican, etc... and all the restaurants let them. I mentioned a soft spanish guitar in the background would be nice. When I said that he sent us over to their other family owned restaurant, Picaro, for Flamenco and dessert. We headed over and although the place was packed, they made sure to get us a table.  They took great care of us. That was a lot of fun!

We kept asking to be placed on their second floor or even to split up the group, but they insisted that we would all fit. \nSecondly, with such a large group, there ended up being some billing discrepancies (one of the card users noticed an overcharge of $30) but it was corrected while we were all there. A few days later, I get a phone call from a friend saying that  the staff at Esperpento had charged an additional amount on her card. They claim to have never received the cash, that some of us gave. So, even though, she had her signed receipt for X amount, I continue to feel stumped as to why she was charged one amount at that moment and then a few days later she see's an additional charge to make up for the \"missing cash\". I work in the hospitality industry and I'd hate to say it, but it seems that the staff have pocketed the cash and are getting away with it. \nSuffice to say that neither I nor my friends will be returning. \nIn the mean time, I hope my friend is able to get this cleared up.", "author": "Evelyn B."}

I now live in Oakland and rarely make it over to the city but I did last night and stopped by my favorite tapas place to satisfy my craving for some of my old faves. We weren't that hungry so only got three dishes: spinach bechamel, potatoes aoli and clams in garlic sauce. I also had a glass of sangria, which was sweet but good.\n\nThe food was as good as I remember it - the potatoes were cooked perfectly: crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and lovely aoli sauce. The clams were kind of small but the sauce was nice. This was my husband's first visit to Esperpento and he said he would go back, which says a lot because he's very picky, especially when it comes to Western food.\n\nI think last night was the first time I did not have to wait for a table, which was great. But I have fond memories of waiting for a table on the sidewalk with friends sipping sangria from our first carafe. We also got a great parking space one block away last night which I thought was a miracle. I guess everything just went right for us and made the dining experience extremely pleasurable.\n\nI'm impressed that Esperpento has kept its quality for 14 years and I think the menu is exactly the same!

The manchego cheese was delicious, the paella with blood sausage and the paella with mariscos were both generous and delicious--and heavy, which is how it's supposed to be--and the sangria was refreshing. Our vegetarians were even happy, since the vegetable dishes--notably the spicy potatoes, spanish tortilla, sauteed mushrooms, and artichokes were quite tasty. The service was quick, and the servers were very attentive. We also got to hear a couple pretty good singer/guitarists make their way through the restaurant.

My cousins and sister arrived a little after 7pm on a Sunday night (yesterday).  A table had just left so we were seated immediately.  Everything went downhill from there.  It took our server at least 10 minutes to come and take our order.  Our drinks came out a few minutes after but then he disappeared for another ten minutes or so before finally bringing us the tapas that we ordered.  However, he never brought us any bread and butter and it wasn't until we were almost done with our tapas that we got tired of waiting and was finally able to flag him down for some.  At least another 15 minutes passed before our paella finally came out.  During that time, most of our drinks were empty or nearly empty and he could have probably sold us another glass of drink each if he bothered to pay us any attention!\n\nAnyway, the four of us shared the following:\n~ Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp): a-ok...nothing special and I can definitely make better garlic shrimp, 3/5 stars\n~ Patatas Bravas: mmM...the potatoes were cooked perfectly and crispy on the outside...loved the spicy sauce (which wasn't really spicy at all), 4/5 stars\n~ Tortilla de Patata: decent..3/5 stars\n~ Lobster Paella: I really liked how they cooked their rice and it was flavorful.  The lobster was way overcooked though...way to ruin good seafood!  Good thing there were pieces of calamari and clams in the paella or I would have been even more unhappy with that place..overall 3/5 star dish\n~ Sangria: I'm not a big fan of wine or alcohol in general but their sangria is really fruity and delish! 5/5 stars\n\nEsperpento is way understaffed and should hire a few more servers if they don't to piss off their customers and lose more business.  I'd rather go to Cha Cha Cha and wait an hour for a table.  At least then, I know I can expect good service when I am seated.\n\nOverall, 2 stars for Esperpento.

Of the many times, I' ve been here, I tried several types of dishes, always order two to three types of small tapas or small appetizers when dining with two or more. \n\nThe Croquettes are average in taste although a few drops of hot sauce will make it better, almost anything. The mushrooms were amazingly good with garlic. The potatoes are a must have, but be sure to ask for a extra side of sauce with your entree or just on the side. The zucchini would of taste better if it was lightly cook or grilled giving it an extra crunch. The salad is great although small in portion.  \n\nThe grilled trout is the best dish so far although the snapper was just in the running, be careful, (WARNING) you might find seven to ten little pieces of bone.  \n\nAlthough this place is in the mission district and parking can be hard, I suggest coming here during the week for lunch. Weekends can be a hit or miss depending on the service and wait.\n\nThe weekday lunch service is the most amazing, the menu prices are the same except the lunch entrees are about a dollar less but they include soup which is nice.

Like all places, paella takes a long time to bake in the oven--at least 45 mins.  However it's incredible here. Crispy rice at the bottom and fresh seafood/meats on the top.\n\nThe wait is long on Friday and Saturday nights, so come before 6:30 to get seated faster.  I've experienced good service here despite the crazy crowded room, so that's always a plus.\n\nThe sangria is delicious, and my fav tapas are the spicy potatoes, grilled mussels, spanish tortilla, and the grilled green beans.  Simple and so well seasoned!  The garlic shrimp is always good too, but the most recent night I went they were a bit overcooked (well, they were small lil shrimps, so I can see how they were mistakenly overcooked).\n\nSupport this place for it's great food and small town restaurant-feel.

Had I been born with metal parts and an engine, however, I might as well have had my oil check come with 'grilled' calamari and aioli at Esperpento. \n\nMy first visit to Esperpento did not result in this realization. I went with my friend from Barcelona who took charge of the ordering. She warned us that you had to get the right things at this place and got us the chicken croquettes and the Spanish omelet. I am not familiar with Spanish food, but I thought it was tasty.\n\nMy second visit was a different story. My friend and I got a table immediately and were given a warm greeting. We ordered what were some pretty cheap and decent glasses of wine ($4.50 each), and decided to get the Spanish Omelet, the garlic potatoes aioli, and the 'grilled' calamari. The Spanish omelet was not really different from last time, and the potatoes were garlicy and hearty but the 'grilled' calamari was nothing short of false advertising (-2 stars). If you say something is grilled it shouldn't be doused in oil and where was the charcoal taste? I rarely get to eat grilled calamari (It's barely served in SF which is funny considering it's one of the thinner cities in the US) so I was disappointed when the calamari came bland and floating in a pile of grease. If that was anything it was sauteed calamari, not grilled.  I might as well have gotten the fried calamari. \n\nAll and all, the food here is way way greasier than anything I've eaten in a long long time. Though the spanish omelet is pretty tasty (as were the potatoes) I would hesitate to return as I don't think my body can deal with that much oil for another three months - even automobiles have their oil limits.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

About $1 or $2 or so cheaper but a lot lower in quality. Parking is difficult, be prepared to circle for a while.

The waitress was rude from the beginning. We were not greeted, were not asked if we were doing okay. The waitress just seemed upset from the beginning.

A lady came up and said to two of us \"you have 5 minutes to leave, you have been here since 1 pm.\" It was a little after 5 pm at the time. We were a little offended and my friend approached this lady.

Service was great, food was great, prices reasonable... what more can you ask for? It's a little loud so if you want to have a romantic quiet evening, this is not the place for it. And if you don't have reservations... you will have to wait outside. And SF even in the summer, it gets pretty cold waiting outside for long period of time.\n\nOne issue we had during our last visit to Esperpento was our reservation. i knew we were going to be a big group so I sent an email to the restaurant the day before our planned dinner.  I received a reply to my inquiry a couple of hours later from the restaurant. I found out later on that the person who replied to my email was the owner. At any rate, we arrived on time, but the lady in front said we didn't have a reservation. We told her that we did, and she kept pressing - no reservation for that big a group. I had to get a copy of the email I received confirming I did contact the restaurant.  We had to show the lady in front the email and then she told us - well that's the owner that replied to you but he never told us about it.  Wow... how weird, especially after i called to change my reservation from 8 people to 10 people. Somehow, 2hrs before dinner, they had that reservation. Once we were there, they no longer had it.  Anyway, that was annoying --- but after that, everything else was fine.\n\nSo if you're making reservation via email - keep a copy of the reply.  If you're calling, make sure you have the date/time you called, and the name of the person you spoke to. Just to be safe...\n\nOH - before i forget, must try the sangria!!!

So, when the opportunity popped up last week, I was eager to revisit Esperpento.  \n\nSure enough, when we arrived (on a Thursday evening), the place was buzzing and festive-seeming, with a team of Mariachis lined up on the stairs, belting out Spanish bullfighting music. Very good start! I ordered a pitcher of red sangria to begin the evening. Excellent (not too much fruit, but definitely alcoholic...!) The waiter was friendly and there was a genuine fun, happy feeling in the place. We ordered a generous sampling of different tapas -- Potatos Bravas, salmon strips, Gambas, Jamon Serrano, Chicken Croquettes. And here, the feelgood factor broke down a bit for me -- the food was fair, not great - and certainly not the delicious, savory dishes I remember from before. Maybe my palate has developed an attitude, like the rest of me, but everything seemed just ok  to me, and everything was slightly cold. (And things seemed a bit chaotic on the floor - the waiter kept appearing at our table with the wrong dishes, then scampering off to get some more.) We didnt actually finish anything, but in truth, that didnt really dampen my enthusiasm too much -- the place really is fun. Certainly, the mediocre food was disappointing, but it was more than compensated with the buoyant, friendly vibe. (And the food *is* cheap, to be fair -- our entire bill -- including a huge pitcher of sangria -- came to ~$50.00. A very good deal for an evening out in San Francisco.)", "author": "donal c."}

This was a bit disappointing as it had no taste, pretty bland having the texture of Polenta.

Next we were onto the Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" (sauteed Spanish sausage), Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp), Gambas A La Plancha (grilled jumbo shrimp). The Chorizo was tasty but the blood sausage still had me in it's love grip.

This last time, we were given the private room next door to the main dining room. We got pretty rowdy with the help up beverages and sincere hunger and felt not a twinge of guilt from all the noise that we were making; the main restaurant gets really loud anyway.\n\nSo we started with pitchers and pitchers of sangria, copious amounts of tapas dishes and ended up paying only about 30$ per person. That was an excellent surprise to us all. \n\nSo with regard to what Esperpento has to offer... The sangria is sweet, but no one could stop drinking it. It's some of the best that I've had here and in Spain. It was so difficult making the tapas choices; there is just too much to choose from on the menu. If you are a vegetarian you can manage here but this is a meat-lover's paradise after all. I highly recommend the ox-tails, rabbit, grilled calamari and \"meat-lover's\" paella. \n\nA word of strong suggestion: if you want paella, order it the second you are seated. Do not wait. It takes about 30 minutes to make it. By the time our pan of paella had made it to the table, we were pretty much stuffed from all the other foods and drinks. But we made a valiant and greedy effort to try it out anyway. Also, I was happy to learn that Esperpento recently added black squid ink seafood paella version that I fell in love with in Barcelona. That's for the next time at the restaurant. I can't wait.\n\nThe only drawback to the private room seating is that you have to go outside and then enter the regular restaurant entrance next-door to access the restrooms. Minor issue.

I could even imagine doing it again, correctly, at a more mature age. But for me, vegetarianism was basically an excuse for eating only beer, cookies, and the occasional orange for about four years. \n\nEventually, I decided I should strive for a more balanced diet, and I don't have any serious lasting health effects from the 4 years of beer and cookies (at least that I'm aware of), but I do sometimes run into trouble when I try to eat meat.\n\nFor example, a group of my friends came to Esperpento and ordered the paella. We couldn't decide whether to get the fish paella or the meat paella so we ordered the \"every non-endangered animal in the entire world except chorizo\" paella. (We also ordered the chorizo, which was yummy.)\n\nPaella, according to the menu, is a stew served over rice in a pan. Typically, when I order something like stew, I expect to just be able to stick a spoon or fork in it and eat away until it's finished.Oh, how wrong I was.\n\nMy first spoonful of paella contained a clam in a shell. I knew better than to eat the shell of a clam, so I just kind of set it aside.\n\nThen, I encountered a shrimp. I really like shrimp, so I shoved it in my mouth without looking. Crunch! I was forced to demand that all my friends look at the mariachi band so that I could safely extract the entire tail from my mouth and hide it inside my clam.\n\nFinding a shrimp tail in my stew freaked me out so I just stuck with rice and squid (no bones!) for a while. Then I got bold and grabbed a piece of pork. It looked safe to eat, but when I took a bite a little shard of bone wedged itself between two my teeth! \n\nOwww. Try taking a pointy object and shoving it into some skin that has never been touched by anything ever. No fun.\n\nThese animals clearly weren't going down without a fight. And the only animal I hadn't eaten yet, the chicken, was absolutely littered with hard, sharp bones. The paella wasn't tasty enough to be worth all the effort and pain. It was time to walk away with the remaining shreds of my dignity.\n\nAlso, they had run out of bread. Who does that? \n\nEsperpento is a great place to go to sit outside, drink sangria, and scope out hot Spanish waiters. All the tapas I've had are tasty.

However, I found the food here to be just a little better without being more expensive.  And here, they have a trubador who bears striking resemblance to Little Richard with a spanish accent, in a metallic purple shirt, strumming and yelling incoherently a slightly familiar-sounding song.  We totally tipped him.  He was awesome.\n\nTortilla de papas - a must-order\nmanchego - pretty good (hard to f^ck up)\nartichokes - best plate by far\nwhite bean salad - so so\nsangria - another must-order\n\n*read: just the sidewalk.

This is your $5-$6 tapas place, meat/seafood dishes are more of course. Lots of veggie choices. Sangria pitcher is $16.50 and a glass is $4. We've come here with small groups and larger ones. We've come on busy nights and slow nights. The service is usually prompt (it was prompt last night when we arrived at 530pm). And the food has been consistent.\n\nHere's what we ordered last night: \n\n2 sides of rice\ngarlic chicken\npotatoes with aoli sauce\nmushrooms\npotato omelet\npitcher of sangria\n\nThe food was good, garlicky and filling! The sangria was pretty strong. But for two people, this was too much food. Our eyes were bigger than our stomaches when we ordered! I think next time, when it's just the two of us we'll order: 3 tapas, one order of rice and 2 glasses of sangria. That should do us. \n\nTotal: $54 (includs tax and tip)\nWe'll always be back!", "author": "Caroline C."}

My first visit to Esperpento, only having tried two dishes, I still had hope as I called to ask if they could seat my large party here on a Sunday evening.\n\nOn my last visit here, it was with a party of 21 people, and we had the entire second floor to ourselves.  For being able to accomodate all of us  -  A+.  For it being upstairs - - well, let's just say \"heat rises\" - and with all the patrons down below, cooking down below, it was like trying to eat in an oven at 230 degrees, but we managed.\n\nAgain, the patatas bravas was fabulous.  We also ordered fried artichokes, a couple of shrimp dishes, sauteed asparagus, bone marrow dish, rabbit, oxtail, calamari, and a few others.  Everything was excellent - -  except the rabbit.  I didn't like that one, it was dry.\n\nFinally, I had the chance to try paella here, which I always intended to come back and try.  We ordered two varieties - - the all-meat, and the all-seafood - - both for 6 people each, and  then ordered a combination for 4 people to feed our large party.  It was so good that even though most of us were stuffed from the tapas, we still chowed on it.  \nBut we had SO much leftover that several boxes were provided for some of us to take it home.  Fresh meat, seafood - - the paella was tasty.  It didn't compare to the amazing paella I had in Bilbao, Spain - - but nothing ever will, I am resigned to that fact.  It was close enough, though - and I don't need an airline ticket to order it.\n\nAll in all - I love this place... and will continue to eat here.  The sangria is not quite as good as that of Cha Cha Cha or Fresca, but everything else is just as good or better.  \n\nAtmosphere is much nicer at Fresca - Fillmore, so for dates and such, that is perhaps a classier option, but for a casual dinner with friends, it'd be hard to beat Esperpento.\n\nFurthermore - - the price was incredible.\nOf the 21 people, only 19 people were paying, and it broke down to a mere $41 per person, including 18% gratuity.  If all 21 were paying, it was going to be only $38 - - and that was after ordering perhaps one paella for six too many - -  so that breaks down to one of the best deals to be had for good food in San Francisco.\n\nTapas, to me, is not a true 5-star type of restaurant.  For the food - 4 stars, but I throw in the extra star simply because this place is in its own league when it comes to tapas in SF.  If it stands out, then it's worthy of making my list of 5 star establishments!", "author": "Grace K."}

Eventually someone else started taking care of us and things got much better.  We had a carafe of sangria and five tapas - the highlights being the snapper and patatas bravas.\n\n2nd time - a Saturday night, around 1030.  This place was pretty packed then, but I think it's because it's one of the few places still open.  Food was super quick that time around - patatas bravas were still delicious, and the creamed spinach was really tasty too.  The calamari was fine, nothing special, but the grilled artichokes had too much garlic for me to enjoy.  This time our server was right on top of things however.\n\nOne of these days I might try their paella dishes since I have a good vibe here.  Really, I think this place is a little more like 3.5, but their menu is appropriately priced and the sangria is really good (and totally worth getting a carafe), so I'm okay with rounding up this time.", "author": "Tmon B."}

There were only 3 other parties in the restaurant.  The menu said that weekend lunch prices are from 11am-5pm.  I asked the waitress if I can still order the lunch special, just to make sure, even though I've got a half hour window.  She says yes.   Decided to go for the lunch special, which included a free cup of soup of the day, plus two choices of sides, and french bread (?) with every order.  Seemed like a good deal.  Ordered garlic chicken from a smiling waitress, who never came by again - until I went to get her.  Three times.\r\n\r\nMy drink arrives, but no bread.  Then my meal arrives.  \r\n\r\n\"Where's the soup?\"  I asked the waiter who brought the food.  He looks at me funny.  \"Soup,\" I repeat.  \"  It comes with the lunch special.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's dinnertime,\" he said.  \r\n\r\n\"No, it's 4:45 and your menu says weekend lunch is through 5 pm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll check,\" he says, and wanders off.  So I start in on my meal.  THe garlic chicken tastes awful - covered in garlic in a sauce that looks like it has MSG in it - shiny but not tasty.  Just leg meat, on the bones, all dark meat.  Potatoes are OK so I eat those.  THe side salad was just a few pieces of lettuce, one slice of tomato and a piece of red onion.  No dressing.\r\n\r\nWaiter comes back with the soup.   But no bread.  I have to track down my waitress and ask for bread (she was sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant with her back to the room chatting with someone).  And then after a few minutes, I have to ask for bread again.  Now there is only one other party in the restaurant, who has just sat down. The waiter comes out with bread... walks past me ... delivers it to a couple who has just sat down.  HELLO!!!  Have to go ask AGAIN for bread.  My soup is now cold, and so is the rest of the meal.   No offer to reheat my entree while I'm eating the soup.  I ask for a refill on my drink and the waiter seems confused by this as well.\r\n\r\nAnd then I wait.  And wait.  I'm done and I want to go but no bill.  Table full of dirty plates.  I have to get up and tell the waitress I would like my check...Of course, I'm wondering if they are going to try to charge me the dinner price for the plate...  And sure enough, when  the bill finally comes it's 2 dollars more than the \"lunch special.\"  I have to go walk over to the waitress again and explain it to her.  She walks away and confers with the male waiter - for like five minutes.THe male waiter comes over (is he the manager?)  And says, \"Oh, well when we printed the check, I thought we were at dinner hour, I'm sorry.\"  \r\n\r\n\"I think we had this discussion earlier, about the soup, and the lunch special.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh. Yes.\"  \r\n\r\n\"Well, I am just going by what is printed on YOUR menu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh,\" he says.

You see, the thing is that I wasn't at all that impressed with the tapas in Spain. Maybe, it was the establishments that we went to, but I thought that couldn't have been it, because every tapas restaurant that we ate at, was super crowded  and at one place we had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table. I couldn't figure it out.\nWhy was the tapas in Spain just ok?\nNow, I'm here in the Bay Area for a few days of recovery and decompression from a 24hrs + transition from France via London.\nAnd, my friends wanted to hang out and have dinner before I head down to SoCal and get back to reality.\nJC gave us 3 places to chose from where she's eaten before and it was in the area where she lives.\nPretty convenient. Cool.\nEsperento was one of them.\nFunny thing though, we actually decided on Thai food.\nWe get to Osha and there are about 20 empty seats and about 2 tables of 4 tops paying their bills, and the hostess/waitress says that their booked for reservations. And there was only 3 of us. What-ever!\nSo we decide Indian. Dosa. Line out the door. Oh man.\nNext!\nEsperpento it is.\nCool.\nWe get there and there are only about 4 parties ( about a dozen or so peoples). I usually consider and empty restaurant  on a busy avenue a bad thing. But at this point I didn't care. I was hungry.\nWe walk in and we're promptly and politely greeted by a gorgeous Latina, and we're sat at a perfect size table, right by the window.\nNice. Thanks you.\nThe menus is quite extensive and worn out. (good sign)\nOh man. Paella extravaganza and SO many variable of tapas to pick and chose and combine to create a feast of your fancy.\nVery very nice.\nNot too many beers to chose from. Sad. They were out of Negro Modelo (one of the 3 beers they had to chose from) so i settled for and Anchor Steam. Mm. Great.\nAfter about 15 minutes and extensive item suggestions between ourselves, we finally have some idea on what we want.\nActually we didn't, but I thought we did.\nSo, on the fly this is what we got:\n\nTortilla De Patata - potato and onion omelet (basic tortilla Espagnol),\nthe potatoes were nice and soft and the eggs were velvety,moist and soft. And what ever that creme fraiche like sauce was? It made the dish even more delicious.\nChampinon Al Ajillo - mushrooms saluteed with garlic. One of my favorite types of food in the world is mushrooms (any kind, really) but it's gotta be sauteed. Mm. It's pretty basic and simple. These were very good. The mushroom were fairly large and very plump.\nGambas Al Ajillo- garlic shrimp. Lots of garlic and delicious. Although I felt that the shrimp was a bit on the small size. Hah! \nPollo Adobo - spicy exotic chicken. Huh? They serve Filipino food? Nah, this was cooked a lot differently. There was a lot of garlic in this dish as well and I think it was sauteed in red wine and maybe a little sherry. Of course there was some other spices in it. It was really good, but not what I was expecting. Hm?\nWe got a side of rice that was probably cooked with some kind of stock (chicken?) and there were some vegetables, herbs and spices. Again, simple and delicious.\nAnd for the piece de la resistance(insert trumpets here), we ordered the:\nParrillada De Carne - a montain o' grilled meats!  Chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage. hell yeah!), and some other sausage(which tasted like my most favorite of meats: spam!), grilled chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada (skirt steak?) on a bed of what might have either grilled or baked potatoes, topped with grilled red and green onions. \nFellow carnivores. This is your dish. Oh yeah! It's on.\n\nNeedless to say. Once again we ordered more food than was possible to consume. But dammit. We gave it our best shot.\n\nOk. So here's what I figured out.\nOne. Garlic and salt. That is what was laking in the foods in Barcelona. Not that it didn't have any, but that it didn't have enough. Or what I would have preferred.\nTwo. Esperpento rocks.\nNow two things I didn't like about Esperpento.\nOne. Minuscule beer list. Aw. Hey Esperpento folks. Beer is good. Lot's of beer to chose  from is better.\nTwo. Frozen steak. Yuck. Please don't freeze meat for too long.\nIt fucks up the color, taste and texture. 2-3 days at most. Or, get higher quality beef. You can up the price on the menu if you have to.\nI feel people won't mind paying a little extra if the quality is well worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, relaxed, comfortable and still a bit lively.\nThe service is great. Our server was attentive, but not intrusive.\nAnd the over all quality of the food is pretty freakin' good.\nThe bill was the most impressive part. About 20$ a person w/ tip.\nVery nice.", "author": "Kione E."}

And of course, we had the paella for 6 that included mussels, clams, shrimp, and chicken. We generally do not like tapas places because of the small portions, but here we had left overs!\n\nThere was even live music! I am so glad I have \"re-discovered\" this place.", "author": "Mary R."}

I have only been here twice and only paid once however I don't remember either bill being large.\n\nWhat is big here is the flavor. Each dish is both bold and distinct from the other dishes.

Okay, she might have been tired and had an off-day. It's not her fault someone put the salad in a bowl with a bug in it or didn't wash the lettuce.

Boy did I feel bad for them cause we were super loud. Blame the SANGRIAS. Those sangrias....looks and tastes so fruity but it'll hit ya good ;)  Food was awesome! Patatas bravas with their special sauce was my favorite tapa. Also the Torta de Patatas was yum. Calamari was good too. Queso Manchego was alright. Then came the 3 types of paellas: seafood, chorizo and the combo. I LOVED them all. My favorite was the combo paella.

It's the closest taste to what I ate over there that I have found in the city so far. Don't start: No, I haven't been to all the Spanish restaurants. But my taste-bud memory is strong, so back off.\n\nOther \"tapas\" places here are good. But they don't taste like Spain.\n\nWe got a pitcher of Sangria that, if you can avoid excessive amounts of fruit, tastes like what we had there. Not too fruity. More like wine spiked with a hint of fruit.\n\nFor tapas, we had gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), which slid right out of the shell and tasted so, so good. Patatas bravas was HEAVENLY (pardon my all-caps). Albondigas, while probably the most lackluster of our meal, didn't disappoint. Perfectly seasoned, if a little dull. Topped of with pimientos al padron, those DELICIOUS roasted green peppers we got just about everywhere we went in Madrid.\n\nSeriously, the only thing missing at Esperpento is a tostas menu (our waitress agreed).\n\nSo, if you like flavorful, exciting small-plate food, go here.

The food came out relatively quickly and almost all at the same time, which is a plus.  The spicy potatoes were tasty, albeit a little on the greasy side.  The sauteed mushrooms were only okay, too garlicky and not many other dynamic flavors.  The same could be said about the artichoke hearts....bland and chard with not much flavor going on.  The salmon also was too garlicky, and was accompanied by a mound of garlic on the plate.  The only two dishes I have little to no complaints about were the adobo chicken and the quail.  The adobo chicken was only a tad spicy, but he sauce was super flavorful and doubled as a great dipping sauce for the free bread.  The quail was well prepared, greasy and a lot of bones, but that's to be expected.\n\nOur server was energetic and was fairly attentive in the beginning of our meal.  It was later hard to track her down to ask for our bill and later to retrieve it to process our payment.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant was your typical mission tapas joint.  Not the cleanest, but it's decorated well considering.  Great that they have a few tables outside, especially since it was a nice, warm evening.

Read the fine print on the menu, it does take 30 minutes, although it felt like less time elapsed than that. The paella definitely wasn't bad, the chicken and pork were fairly tender; there maybe could have been a little more flavor from the shrimps and such, but having the variety of shrimp, etc. was a nice touch. You can order the paella for 2 ($26) for three people and be more than fine, because the pan it comes in is fairly large.

The dining room itself seems close to full, but not too busy, most people seem to be at the tail ends of their meals. Time goes by and we're motioned to our table for 4, so far things are going great for my birthday dinner... if only they stayed that way...\n\nWe sit and begin to talk amongst ourselves, all the while people are being seated, and business moves as usual. After about 20 minutes I begin noticing something... people that were seated after us are getting drinks, they've ordered, and in one particular case, one table had already started getting food. We haven't even gotten our WATER yet, let alone had a chance to order. So, doing what any normal person would do, I flagged down one of the staff and asked if we could order. He smiled, nodded, and disappeared.\n\n*Time goes by.*\n\n10 minutes later I have to ask again to order, the server I asked did his best to get away, but he knew he couldn't just walk off after smiling and saying yes. So, we ordered, finally. (For those counting, we've been sitting for at least 30 minutes.) We got some great tapas dishes, and a paella de carne. We also ordered a carafe of some of the best sangria I've had in my life.\n\nMost of the tapas and the sangria came fast... however, we never were offered water refills, or even asked if we wanted more sangria. *WE DID*\n\nWe ordered some great tasty mushrooms, masterfully crafted clams, truly flavorful and spicy patatas bravas, and a fairly well done pinchos morunos (pork kebab.), however we also ordered the morcilla sausages... after we had finished all this, we waited about 10 minutes and flagged down our server to find out where the missing morcilla sausages were... \"Oh yes, sorry.\" and then he disappears. To his credit, they came out 5 minutes later, and they are by far my favorite thing on the menu.\n\nNow during this time, we have empty drinks, empty bread, and a slew of empty plates in front of us. The plates were eventually removed, but no one came by to offer more bread, water, or sangria. On the bright side, they did take a birthday dessert to another table... (... that table got great service, all 4 of them. :) Grrr. Drinks, bread, and birthday wishes.)\n\nWhen the paella de carne came, I didn't care about them anymore, I saw this beautifully luscious rice creation in front of me, and my world went all paella crazy. The flavor was amazing, it included pork ribs, ham, sausages, morcilla sausage, pork kebab.... amazing. However, it was also the greasiest thing I've eaten in months. I missed out on a great night of drinking because it destroyed my stomach. It tasted good though.\n\nSo, at this point, we had a great tasting but mediocre meal. The tapas were great, the service was atrocious, and the paella would have been perfect, had it not made me sick.\n\nI don't know, I've loved Esperpento, but it might be a hard sell for me to go back, unless I know they've fixed these issues.", "author": "Dave M."}

I always thought these would be so much better if it with some type of sauce\nPatats bravas - really good. \nChampinones Al Ajilio (mushrooms) - the best option! very flavorful\nAsparagus ala plancha - good flavor. Tangy flavor\nAlcachofas  a la plancha (grilled artichokes) - ugh. Not my favorite. Then again i was never a fan of artichokes. Everyone elses impression was mixed. they either hated it or loved it. \nGrilled quail - didn't eat it but heard it was good. really small though. But i guess that's a quail for you.\nGarlic shrimp - didn't eat it but one of the highlights for the meat eaters. They asked for more bread just to finish the sauce off. \nVeggie Paella - I thought it was alright. Not disappointed at all, tho. It depended on what mixture of veggies ended up in my mouth.  I did not care for whatever bean was in there (i think a lima) and that tended to throw off the flavor of everything else. \nMeat and Seafood Paella - I thought this was weird - the meat eaters HATED this but they LOVED the veggie paella. Go figure. \n\nThe environment was lively.  Good mixture of characters.  It wasn't too loud that I couldn't hear people. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive. The only issue was that they came out with the mushrooms after most of the other items were finished.

Their sangria is pretty good, and they have a decent Spanish wine selection.  I agree service can sometimes be a bit slow.\n\nAll the dishes are pretty big, for tapas. This is a good place to bring a group to chow down on tapas and drink pitchers of sangria. I personally find the periodic mariachi band visit, an occupational hazard at any restaurant in that area, to be a little irritating, but it's interesting the first time.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I've now been to Spain about 10 times and had tapas in Asturias, Barcelona, Madrid, Granada, and Cordoba. Esperpento does have good sangria and it does sort of help the \"I'm dying to go to Spain but I don't have money for airfare\" pangs, but it just really isn't quite the same. \n\nEsperpento uses WAY too much garlic. They use garlic in practically everything. Garlic aioli on top of the tortilla espanola?  I know tortilla espanola is bland, but it is supposed to be! Because of Esperpento, when I finally got to Spain the first time, I expected everything to be full of garlic, but you know, the Spaniards use very little of it in most things.  And I was grateful for that, especially considering that I was single the first time I went to Spain and well, who knows who I might have met? \n\nEsperpento is a good place for large groups though, which is normally how I end up there, at a birthday party or whatever.", "author": "Syd W."}

But Esperpento is THE best!  It's authentic, tasty, good serving sizes, crowded, lively, and has sidewalk seating.  It also reminds me of my favorite tapas restaurant in London called El Molino.  The two places have almost the same exact patatas bravas and garlic shrimp recipes, which happen to be my two most favorite dishes (and the basis for this review).  The prices are pretty reasonable (between 3 people, $65 including a beer and glass of sangria).   I also appreciate how they offer a side plate of rice.  That's very convenient especially if you don't want to order paella.  \n\nIt is hard to get the waiter's attention at first, and if you come at a busy time, just expect to wait around for a while.

They slice the whole dang thing thinly and grilled it.  I never had it that way.  It tasted amazing.  We also order the stew, which was blah, but the fried snapper was great.

So I've developed a unique appreciation for Spanish food, and this cozy spot delivers every time.  At times the service can be a little slow when they're crowded, but the food comes out quickly every time and always smells mouth-watering, while always tasting fresh & delicious. It does get loud the more crowded it becomes, but this place is not built to provide a boring dining experience.  Plenty of other soulless places to go if that's what you're looking for.  The walls are ornately decorated with beautiful objects of Spanish culture, movie & bullfighting posters, etc.  For me, there's a sense of being in another place & time when I go there, which creates an incalculably better experience each time.\n\nThe food is outstanding.  Off da hinges.  Whichever superlative you wish to communicate & bestow.  I can't remember how many people I've taken there who ended up loving the place - family, ex-girlfriends, co-workers, friends, etc.  I'm exceptionally partial to las croquetas de pollo, tortilla espanola, gambas al ajillo, and jamon serrano.  Of course I've had the paella on several occasions, and that has never disappointed.  The Sangria is excellent here, I never waste time to order a carafe as soon as I sit down to order.  Sangria, as it should be.\n\nIn my humble opinion, most of the other places in the City serving Spanish food and/or tapas are still behind this place, many way behind.  I've pretty much had them all, never went back for seconds to many of those places, and am always happy to go back to Esperpento.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.

Whenever I go to San Francisco, I'm usually with my family and we have a set list of restaurants that we always hit up. So it's rare when we actually try some place new. The server was awesome and walked us through the menu and made some really spot-on recommendations. The tortilla espanola and the white bean salad were especially nice. The patatas bravas were perhaps the best I've ever tasted. I wish I had saved more room for the paella at the end, but that was moist for a change. I've had such subpar experiences with paella, so I found it refreshing to have one that was worth writing home about. Kudos again to our server. A very memorable dining experience.", "author": "Adrienne M."}

The platter contained chorizo, sausages (2 kinds), steak, grilled chicken, and beef skewers on top a bunch of sliced grilled potatoes and covered with grilled onions, green onions, and asparagus!  Some of it was a little salty for me, but my BF loved it all!  So depends on your taste preference.  \n\nWe were so stuffed we couldn't even finish it and had to bring the rest home.

He seated me at the larger table and set 4 places.\n\nAnother waiter came up and bought 4 menus so I explained it was just me which she said was ok. I asked if she would prefer me to move if they had a smaller table (such as the outdoor one) so they could use the table for 4. She thanked me and said she'd check. She came back and said they had a table upstairs and handed me off to another waiter.\n\nI followed her upstairs only to be met by the original waiter speaking Spanish at her, gesturing at me and stopping us from going on. She then told me there was no table for me. That if I wanted a table I would have to wait 10-15 mins. I pointed out I had a table and offered to move to suit them. Asked if I could have the outdoor table. No go, told it was wait or nothing. So I voted with my feet and left.\n\nI would have had no issue if they'd asked me to wait when I first arrived.

The mole sauce had no flavor other than a particular sweetness, but it lacked spices and a little kick to it.

In the South it's free, in the North, it's a mere pittance.  In Barcelona there are places that count by toothpicks on your plate or if you're bar hopping in the middle of the day in Madrid, the bartenders give you a free plate of salty tapas to go with your pint.

I'm talking to you Cesar.\n\nEsperpento has lower prices than most of what I've seen in San Francisco/Oakland, but most importantly has that vibe that I want in a tapas place.  It's loud, it's crowded, the sangria's good, the Estrella Gallicia (totally missed out on this while in Spain) is great, and street musicians come in and play-it's a good time.  \n\nService has always been good to me, I think I've waited an average of 7-10 minutes on weekend nights for a table, food comes out quickly, and I love how some dishes take longer than others, so it's like a tapas parade: grubbin' out on the patatas bravas, pollo adobo and some eggplant, then the oxtail stew and tortilla comes out, followed by the mussels...mmm mmm good.

Since we arrived just a little after 6 on a Thursday, we found parking about a 1/2 block away and the place was close to empty, so no problem getting a table.  A pitcher of water (and glasses) and bread were quickly placed in front of us, which was wonderful b/c we were thirsty and starving.  A pitcher of Sangria gave the three of us about 1.5 glasses a piece.  I prefer sangia with more fruit in it, but the wine itself tasted very good.\n\nWe decided to get three of the tapas and the \"Turista (mixed) Paella\" and everything was delicious.  Just a warning: the paellas take FOREVER to come out to your table, so definitely order some tapas or you'll get very upset wondering what's taking so long.  To me, it just makes the paella seem even more authentic since they cook it for hours in Spain, but I know it annoys some people.\n\nAnyway, for our tapas we had the Tortilla de Patata, which was surprised me at being served warm, but had a great egg-y flavor and was quite a large portion.  We also had the Grilled Artichoke, which was sliced super thin.  Pieces were a bit tough, but it did have a great flavor, especially when you squeezed the lemon over it.  Also good were the Garlic Mushrooms, which needed a little salt but were very good as well.  Don't forget to mop up the garlic/oil with your bread before they take the plate away!\n\nOur paella finally came out, we ordered the \"for 2\" size for three people and had about half of it leftover.  The Turista paella had meats and seafood, which to me is the best way to order.  They also had a veggie one if you don't eat meat or seafood.\n\nThe place was packed by the time we left, and a guitar player came in and played a couple songs, wandering around table to table.  The place gets VERY loud when it's crowded, so expect to yell to be heard across the table.\n\nDelicous meal, I can't wait to get back here!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

Its adds a cute feel to the place.\n\nThe first time there was for a bday dinner group and I wouldn't say this place is a great place for more than a group for 4.

Pitchers of sangria to share with everyone is also a great way to gulp down the meal.\n\nWe went back again recently because we were craving paella does not disappoint and it was as good as the first time. You should also order the potatos brava and the garlic mushrooms tapas. So yum!\n\nAs for the service, seems to be hit or miss. The last time we were there, the service was actually disappointing.

I have been to Spain and have had my share of tapas at some of the best tapas bars and even though this may not have held a candle to my tapas experiences in Spain it was decent. \n\nThe scene: On a busy street in the mission, small restaurant, small tables pushed pretty close together, dim lighting, crowded and loud. Definitly. a bustling restaurant on a Saturday night! We had one of the tables by the front window which was perfect. \n\nService: Surprisingly attentive given how crowded it was and our waitress was very nice. Although I do have to make a comment about making reservations. We made reservations about a week in advance for Sat at 8pm. The day of a call was made to confirm the reservation and everything seemed to be set. A call was then made on the way to the restaurant letting them know that we might be early for our reservation and was it possible to be seated a little earlier....well at this point all of a sudden they could not find our reservations....what?!?! Given the fact that a call to confirm was made the same day and all of a sudden they couldn't find it.....it was strange but we were thankfully accommodated. \n\nFood/Drink: \nThe Sangria was actually very good, nice flavor and lots of fresh fruit. \n\nWe had the following tapas: \n\nTortilla- It was good but tasted quite different from what I have had in Spain and what I have made on my own as it had chives in it which changed the flavor of a traditional tortilla. The texture was good but the potatoes were a little dry. \n\nSerrano- Unfortunately it was gone before I have some but others seemed to really enjoy it. \n\nFried Squid- It was OK, nothing out of the ordinary \n\nGrilled Squid- This was definitely the high point of the meal for me, authentic and delicious!!!! \n\nGrilled Artichoke- also wonderful and a must order if you like artichokes. \n\nPork Kebabs- Nice flavor but very dry \n\nWe also had the Lobster Paella . The flavor was decent but it was a little too salty for everyone in our party. The rice was cooked as it should be as were the vegetables, the fish in the dish (including the lobster) was not under or overcooked but it did lack a little bit of flavor. \n\nThe bread at the table was also decent. \n\nOverall: Even though it was loud and crowded with a huge line waiting to get in .....it was in no way annoying ....it made it a fun dining experience. The place had a lot of energy but yet had a coziness about it. Also, the prices here were pretty reasonable we had a pitcher of sangria, a beer, 6 tapas and paella for a little under $100 for four people....not bad. The food was OK and I wouldn't say no if someone wanted to come back here but I would make sure to either come on a different day or at a different time because parking is a nightmare in the mission.", "author": "L L."}

The escalivada was greasy, the sangria just tasted like red wine. My favorite item was the spinach bechamel. It went deliciously with the complimentary bread. Overall the food is alright, but this place is pretty vegetarian friendly and the serving size is pretty good. My vegetable platter left me stuffed but I stupidly ordered a tapa also.

CALAMARIIIIIII! Our group (for both parties) gobbled down the appetizers in less than 20 minutes. Also... Sangrias. Really good, really tasty, and really strong. I learned my lesson the hard way... just don't down a pitcher and a half of those before the main course arrives cuz in the end, well, lets just say the paella was wasted on me. Haha. We went here (twice) for the paella. Out of this world. No other place in the world that I know can serve paella as good as them. Seafood, Chicken all so good.\n\nAside from the waiting before getting in even with an reservation, I think this place is pretty good. Servers are nice and chill. The food is outstanding.

There was a group of us (8) and we got paella for all with tapas on the side.  First the fried calamari [Calamares Fritos fried calamari], it was cooked to perfection with a crispy outside and not rubbery on the inside. Then the spicy potato wedges [Patatas Bravas] which are drizzled in a creamy salsa.  They have a little heat and a wonderful flavor. I believe you can by this jarred to take home. Finally, for the tapas, a plate of mini chorizos.  Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" is what they are called and were a big hit at the table as well.  The main dish, Paella De Carnes Y Mariscos \"turista\" with chicken, pork ribs, shrimp, calamari, clams and mussels had the most marvelous flavor.  Presented at the table in a cradled paella pan and cook to order I'm told (expect extra time for this).  It is a beautiful dish guaranteed to get your mouth watering on sight.  Unfortunately, a second visit, New Years Eve, was not as impressive.  We were only two but ordered the same things as the first time.  Upon getting there sharply at 5:00p (opening), we were greeted and led to our table by a guy in a parka and Jimmy Hendrix t-shirt.  My wine glass arrived with lipstick on the glass and cork floating inside.  I returned it back to the bar myself.  The calamari came looking white and oily. I suspect the cooking oil was not up to temperature.  The other two appetizers were up to par, and the paella was excellent.\nWe thought the waiter was a little disheveled, bringing us things in a strange order, but was pleasant and efficient otherwise.   \nI'm lenient on the place because I wont judge a restaurant on a holiday as being its norm, but was hoping for a perfect start of the New Year celebration.

About halfway through, a girl who worked there but who was not our server approached our table and asked, \"Did you order this?\" We were of course like, \"Shit yeah we ordered this!\" And after a while of back and forth of this \"did you or didn't you\" business, it comes out that it actually belonged to the table next to us.

They also have a selection of paellas and dinner/lunch combinations.\n\nWe opted for the fried calamari, garlic sauteed mushrooms, asparagus, spicy potatoes, chicken adobo and rice.  All was tasty, but not star-studded--I actually prefer the potatoes at Cha Cha Chas.\n\nAnother :30 minutes and we finally get the check, even after asking for it, so I have no reservation in saying that the service was HORRIBLE.  The whole experience took so long that we opted to pay cash to avoid having to wait for the waitress to run our cards.  Total bill for 3 people came to $50 without tip.\n\nLooking around, the place was pretty full for a Thursday evening so they must be doing something to people's liking.  Probably the sangria.  Or the default of its mission-central location.", "author": "Amanda C."}

The pros are that Esperpento is in the Mission just across the street from the 21 St garage and they have a reasonably priced menu and good house red wine.  The cons are - \n* all 6 of our tapas came out at once (for a party of 2)\n* all of the tapas were very salty and oily\n* bread was nothing special and was served with butter.  When we asked for olive oil, we were brought a plate with a bit of light yellow colored oil on it (looked and tasted more like vegetable oil).\n* the croquetas were not even flavorful enough to eat and were served with a wierd cream spinach sauce.  They also only had chicken, not jamon, croquetas.\nThe Mission is so packed with good restaurants that we were disappointed to waste a night there on this one.", "author": "Leslie R."}

Afterward, we met up with friends to go out for dinner. We wandered to various restaurants to check on the varied dietary needs, and I suggested that we go to Esperpento.  We had eaten there several times over the years with a few friends, and with crowds.  Even though it was not a comfortable environment and very crowded, the food always made up for that. We were told by the server to wait for a table.  Ten minutes passed and the server decided that we were not going to be seated after all, and rudely told us so (even though there was space for us).  We hadn't done a thing to deserve such treatment!   Among our party was a project manager, teacher, three book publishing company executives, and other professionals. Yet we were treated as if we were street urchins.  For some reason the server must have had a very bad day to make the decision to refuse to seat us.   However, we soldiered on to another restaurant that was gracious to their customers, had delectable cuisine, and was spacious! Thank you Esperpento,  by denying us service in such a rude manner, it lead us to find a wonderful new regular city hang out!   I intend never to go back again. Nope! No \"esperanza\" for you!", "author": "Spring S."}

I went to Esperpento with two friends who were more experienced with Tapas, than I - being a Tapas virgin. First came the Sangria... which was very good. Then came the food... first up were Gambas A La Plancha, Calamares Fritos, Mejillones A La Vinaigrette, Patatas Aioli. The Gambas - shrimp- were great, but you had to work them out of their shells, worth the effort! Fried Calamari, pretty self explanatory, but the garlic aioli is REALLY good. The mussels were good but a little to brusque and fishy for me. I can't enough about the potatoes. They were in a word phenomenal. We were still hungry after that (there were three of us) so, some anchovies in oil with lemon - not a fan of anchovies but I did try them (they weren't as fishy as they usually are), some Ropa Viejo, and some Champinones Al Ajillo found their way to our table. The Ropa Viejo was pretty tasty but the mushrooms were on the same level as the potatoes! \n\nSome Jamon Serrano was involved too, and it was very good as well... \n\nAll in all, definitely worth any wait or travel!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

It is called Esperpento, and attempts to be a legitimate tapas/paella joint on the Valencia strip.  Beware, however -- just because the cheese shop sketch is funny on your TV, does not mean it's particularly pleasant when actually experienced.\n\nI came here with a couple of friends one night, looking for a good couple of tapas.  They had a nice, if not particularly inspired set of menu choices, but did have one fantastic special that involved fresh anchovies!  Music to my ears!  To boot, I found a unique and delicious white wine on their list that they were offering both by the glass and by the bottle.  Fantastic!  My friends ordered their tapas, and we added a paella for all of us to share.  The waitress disappeared with our orders, and we sat in eager anticipation.\n\nFrom there, it was all downhill.  After a few minutes, our server came back and informed me that they do not offer my wine by the glass.  I told her it was on the menu by the glass, SHOWED her it was on the menu by the glass, but was forced into ordering a rioja that I really did not want.  Five-to-ten minutes later, she reappeared to tell me that they were out of anchovies for the evening.  My god, is there anything this place DOES have?  Look, if you're worth your pay as a server, you will know immediately if the kitchen is out of something, or if you do not offer a wine by the glass, and you will tell your guest so at their table, before they've ordered.  To boot, you will suggest another item or drink, instead of leaving your guest to come up with another order on the fly.  I ordered some tapa that was so generic that I've forgotten it by now.  At this point, I was just praying that the paella would save my night.  Ah, how dreams are dashed, because the paella was average at best.  The shrimp and shellfish were fresh-tasting, but the rice was sloppy and THERE WAS NO CRISPY LAYER FROM THE BOTTOM!  What's the point of eating paella if the crisp from the bottom of the pan isn't part of the meal?\n\nI might try this place again.  If I want to live in a state of disappointment.  If I'm a self-hating masochist.  If I think the Valencia strip isn't upsetting enough.", "author": "Nick B."}

I have worked as a server before so understand the pressure and difficulty working around tight spaces on busy nights. However, at one point they were shifting chairs around and at one point HIT ME IN THE HEAD with the corner of one chair. They non-chalantly apologized but did not seem to really care.  \n\nAs for dessert, we were planning on getting some but the a bill was set on our table feeling like we were being kicked out. Guess no dessert! Water was never filled, we were never asked if we wanted more wine. Pretty much ignored the whole time until the bill came.\n\nI could say if we were pushy assholes than that sort of behavior would be acceptable. No server should deal with a pretentious a-hole. But I know my friends and I always do our best to be respectful and patient. But at some point I give up and lose patience. This was the night.  \n\nI'd go there on a quieter night because for the price the food is pretty good.

We decided to use Bart instead of driving around looking for parking space.  We got there at 7 PM and found that the place was crowded. Earlier in the day we tried numerous times to make reservations, but to no avail the phone was never pickup.  We later found out that the place has been so busy that they don't have time to pick the phone, and so if you have party of 8 or more, I would suggest to keep trying otherwise, you just have to show up a bit early and wait.  We were told that it would take 15-30 minutes for a table for two and waited outside.  We asked if we can order something to drink while we were waiting and they brought us sangria which was fabulous.  The sangria had cubes of oranges with its rind and apples.  Very enjoyable and wanted to order another glass. We were careful enough not to drink the sangria too fast so that we can enjoy our tapas.  \n\nWe were finally seated indoors and so excited to try so many dishes but unfortunately on that night the lights went out and had to use candles in which you could not see what was on the menu.  We decided to have the house red wine, to our surprise the wine was really good and good paring with the food we ordered.  We ordered the following: Chorizo Salteado \"Cantimpalitos\" sauteed Spanish sausage, Queso Manchego Spanish ewe's milk cheese, Patatas Aioli homemade garlic mayonnaise, Rabo Toro, Oxtail Stew , Gambas Al Ajillo garlic shrimp, and Ropa Viejo beef, chicken, and chorizo stew.  The food we selected were all good, but I wish we had better lighting so that we can see the rest of the menu. The Rabo Toro, Oxtail stew was okay, nothing to brag about, the meat was tender but it was lacking something.  I really thought I would taste the richness of the of the meat in the broth but it was just ordinary.  The Queso Manchego Spanish cheese was good, but too plain.  I thought they would add something to the cheese to elevate the flavor more.  But now I know not to order these two items in my next visit.  For sure I would go back to try the seafood and of course the Paella.  \n\nWhen we got our bill, we noticed that they did not charge us for the sangria and for the amount of food we ate, it did not break the bank. So inexpensive and you get to try different dishes.\n\nThis is a fun place to go especially if you are with a large group.

Standouts were the white bean and salami dish, the pallella, the patatas bravas, the serrano ham, and the chorizo dish.

Just read the following and you will understand...\n\nUpon seeing Esperpento featured on Check Please Bay Area with Leslie Sbrocco, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty packed but we were seated right away.  The menu was easy to read.  We ordered five tapas plates and were excited to try something new.  Little did we know it would be an unpleasant experience.  The waitress gave us some bread and it was stale!  My poor husband (who loves bread!) had to chuck it on the ground in hopes of getting a new basket of fresh bread.  It did not happen.  The second basket that finally came (I had to get up to ask the waitress) was a step up.  Anyway, the food came out rather quickly but we never saw our waitress again.  I wanted more hot water for my tea and it took several failed attempts to get the teapot filled.  No one checked up on us.  It was horrible service!  Whenever I asked the  waiter for something, he gave only a passive aggressive response.  He  nodded but never did anything about my request.  The waiter did this twice.  We had never had such an awful dining experience.  After we gave each other the 'we are never coming back here' look, we politely asked for our check.  Since it was only about 7ish, we figured by the time the check finally did arrive we could get home in time to watch \"Dancing with the Stars\".  We waited and waited and no one came to give us our bill.  I had to get up again to hunt down any employee and ask for the bill.  When the bill finally did arrive, my husband did not give them a tip.  In fact, he wrote a big fat goose egg with a line across it on the section for tip.  We thought the food was mediocre at best and service was atrocious.  Who has to get up several times for a server in a sit down restaurant?  If anything, they should be giving me a tip for all the running around I had to do.  Anyway, so we left on our merry way all the while complaining about the deplorable service.  It gets even better....two days later as my husband was looking at his statement online he sees that Esperpento so graciously charged us a tip we NEVER authorized!  A 15% tip which they did not deserve since they did not do anything that would constitute to any tip let alone a 15% tip.  What audacity and brazen entitlement!  We could not believe that they would do something like that.  We had no choice but stop by to talk to the owner and even called Mr. Muela so we can rectify the matter.  They always say he is not here and there is no manager. How convenient.  This is outright stealing and forgery.  So the saga continues.  The owner is suppose to call us back but I have a feeling that the tip money is as gone as our future patronage.  We will keep you posted on our struggle to get back our rightful money....keep up the good fight...don't give undeserving cretins tips they have not earned!", "author": "Mr. and Mrs. L."}

FINALLY he comes back, tells us we can come in.\n\nwe get seated, have to ask for bread 3 times before it's brought to us, order some food to hold us over, food comes, realize some of us are missing forks. \n\nus: \"can we get some forks?\" \nthem: \"okay... we'll see if we can get some from the dishwasher.\"\nummm okay...was that really necessary to tell me? so weird.\n\nfood was okay but definitely not as exciting as other tapas i've had. mushrooms are boring, might as well make them at home. i liked the grilled artichoke dish, we all enjoyed the seafood paella, people were unimpressed by the calimari, and the sangria was great (especially with the extra kick).  we clearly had a lot to drink, so we did enjoy ourselves, but the whole set-up just seemed unnecessary; i mean, they could've said \"no, we won't be able to seat you for an hour\" when we called. right? right. sooooo weird.", "author": "lauren a."}

My first experience in '97 was the jam.  Maybe, cuz dotcom frenzy was in its ascendency, it's the painkillers talking, but People, I've been to Spain and this is pretty authentic.  This is not to say it's excellent cuisine-- this is not Zarzuela or Bocadillos or Bar Cerveceria!  This is olive oil and garlic laden (don't come if you no like), cheap Spanish (&Filipino) beer, yummy, homey Spanish food.  This is not microgreens or organic poultry or artisinal anything so get over yourself. (I recommend Bar Cesar in Berkeley for that genre of tapas.)\r\nTonight's meal:\r\n- Pollo Adobo (not my father's, but he's Illocano); chix was slightly arid, but the sauce is tasty-- not too spicy\r\n- Gambas Ajillo (not Mexican though the chef probably is); the shrimp are too small to carry off the strong flavor of this dish, but they've made the right choice with peeling the body and leaving the tail on--  \r\n- Patatas Bravas (not as good as ChaChaCha); they're not crispy enough.  I suspect in 1997 they were being deep friend and now they resemble Squat and Gobble homefries, but this is a standby tapa to help counteract the grease of...\r\n- Chorizo (weird little sausages); I like Mexican Chorizo and this amazing Chorizo Bilbao sold at Bi-Rite and Lucca, but I don't know what the hell this is.  It tastes like chorizo though, and part of the appeal is the little sausages-- it's like that feeling you get when you see a dachsund. (I want to eat it?!)\r\n- Tonight's best for last...\r\n-CALAMARI A LA PLANCHA:  OK, do not confuse this with Calamari Fritti, I repeat, no talking about Calamari Fritti.  I had the Calamari Fritti once, and I was embarassed for the chef.  Can you do more than dredge sub-par calamari in flour and panfry (I'm not 100% sure this was the method but it sure tasted like it)??  But CALAMARI A LA PLANCHA-- this is a totally different story-- like carmelization, juicy tomato bits studded with crispy garlic- another bread dipping frenzy.\r\n\r\nMore dubious items:  anything with tuna (atun); grilled artichokes, bechamel with anything, albondigas missing something... Oh, yeah, prices have gone up, too about $1-2 since 2003.

No one's reviewed this place?? \n\nMy parents told  me they saw this place on KQED and took me here which is kind of weird because I didn't think my parents could know more about the city than me, but boy am I glad they did.\n\nI never understood why people said Cha Cha Cha's is overated until I came here. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* Sangria: Definately beat Cha Cha Cha's! It's cheaper, sweeter (a plus for people with sweetoothitis like me), and they give you more! We got a pitcher which is more than 4 glasses for about $10. I was surprised that my super Korean super conservative super Christian parents let me have a glass. Sucked I couldn't let myself get a buzz going because I had to pretend I don't drink hahaha. It was funny seeing my mom gettin her Asian glow on though.\n\n*Food: We got their sauteed mushrooms, spicy potatoes, spicy chicken, clams, a seafood dish that starts with a \"Mar\" (I forgot what it was called), and flan. All of it was very fresh but I didn't like the sauce that was on the potatoes, it was less creamy and thick than the one they have for the potatoes at Cha's (which i LOVE) and I think the potatoes could have been crispier but it was still good. The seafood dish was awesome. It had generous portions of fish, calamari, giant shrimp, shellfish, rice, peas, carrots, tomatoes, the whole shabang! It cost $24 but I definately reccomend it! The spicy Chicken was so tender, juicey, and hot, but definately not spicy which is fine with me. The flan was OK, I liked it better at Cha's b/c Cha's flan is more creamy and pudding like, and theirs was more jello like. It was all really great though because the tapas are 5-8 bucks and the portions are generous.\n\n*Service: Their food came out fast but it might have been because we came pretty early (around 5pm on a Saturday) and right after we came the place got packed and had a line out the door. The waiters were kind enough to help my parents figure out which dish they saw on TV. I really don't like waiters that are too attentive (fill your glass after every sip, ask you how your meals going amidst a convo, basically you can feel their eyes on you every minute while your trying to enjoy your meal) but their service was perfect. \n\n* The place: Nothing fancy. Not really coordinated. Our table wasn't level which really bugs me but owell. Their bathroom wasn't Bloomingdales but owell. The parking was a BITCH but owell.\n\n*Cute waiter: Resembled Olivier Martinez. I was mentally kicking myself in the head because I was there with my parents. Even my mom said he was cute. In front of my dad.  Had to pretend that I disagree so they don't realize I've gone through puberty already. GAH! GOD HATES ME.\n\nI called all my girlfriends telling them we must go back. For their food, their sangria (I WILL GET DRUNK NEXT TIME), and that waiter. \n\nTO BE CONTINUED...", "author": "Lillian P."}

It was a horrible experience.  Disclaimer, some of the party was late in arriving.\n\nThe room wasn't big enough to seat us all, and it took them over 30 minutes to bring an extra table.  So for a half hour, 4-5 people just stood, waiting.  During this, we repeatedly asked to at least get a drink order in, and they couldn't even do that.\n\nLong story short, i had to speak w/ the manger 3 different times to make things happen.  While they did finally start serving us in a somewhat normal manner, the whole experience was just nasty. \n\nTo their credit they did give us 2 free pitchers of sangria, but then they continued to screw up and we had to wait 30 minutes between our 2 orders of paella (which were ordered at the same time).  After 30 minutes, nobody was even hungry anymore (and waiters were nowhere to be seen) so i had to track down the manager, again, and tell him to just forget everything, cut us a check, and let us get out.\n\nI pretty much think this place has no right to do continue doing business.

Also, near the door while we were trying to wait was some guy singing and playing the guitar, who immediately tried to get us to give him money after we sat down. Um, no--it was unpleasant and annoying.\n\nThings got better after the waitress apparently read our minds and returned with a pitcher of sangria that we hadn't even ordered.

It was cool that we werent sitting directly next to anybody or have anybody bumping into us.\n\nOur server comes pretty fast (another plus) and she recommends that we should put in the order now if we wanted the paella because it takes about 30min to prepare.  So we look at the menu and ask if we should get the seafood/meat one but says that the flavors get mixed up and recommends either one or the other.  We settle on the seafood and she recommends the garlic shrimp and potatoes.  GF only has water and I try the Sangria.  \n\nThe two dishes, shrimp and the potatoes, (I forgot what they were called) came out pretty fast and they were really good, even the sauce was so good that I asked for some bread to soak it all up.  \n\nThe Paella came out in about 35min but the shrimp and potatoes kept us busy while waiting.  So they serve the Paella portion for the amount of people eating it, we ordered the 2 person pan but it could've really served 3-4 people.  \n\nAfter splashing it with lemon and taking the first bite, you can just taste the ocean but not in a bad way, every bite was good and washing it down with the sangria made it better.\n\nThey kept the water coming and our sever kept checking on us which was very good for a busy day.  They had these two guys singing with  guitars which was nice.  The overall atmospere was good, it was loud but a good loud and the place was pretty clean.\n\nThe only negative was the amount of time to get the check and get everything settled (which wasn't too pricey) but it really didn't detract from the dinner.  We would definitely go back and try the other tapas and the meat Paella.  Pluses for the time to get a table, amount the server came, the food wait , the server being friendly and of course the food.  The only other bad thing (which wasn't their fault) was walking up the hill and being too stuffed to get Mitchell's Ice Cream on the way home.", "author": "Chris G."}

The food itself is pretty mediocre, at best. The potatoes bravas where uncooked, not crispy at all, in fact very oily. The sauce was overly vinegary. And unfortunately that was the standout tapas of the meal. But on the plus side the server (forgive I forget her name) was extremely nice and accommodating as was the host who called me when our table was ready which allowed us to jump across the street for a drink. Also the prices were quite reasonable. We were a group of 7 and with a bottle of wines and several beers the total was about $140 including tip. Not bad.

I see they get some mixed reviews, and I sincerely want to help them be the SF insitution that they should be, having weathered a lot of ups and downs in our economy and all.  This place has been here since as long as I can remember.  And it's a bright and cheery spot on the block, which I enjoy walking by often.  So all arrows point to 4 estrellas.\n\nUNTIL...\n\nat the end of our meal the manager dude came over to turn our table.  He was all \"I'm sorry guys...\" in that mincing not-very-sorry tone that managerial people like to use.  \n\nNote that we were still picking at our desserts and had just barely paid the bill.  I found this especially bad timing considering that we had ordered the paella, in advance mind you, which took about 45 minutes to arrive, and which I found totally acceptable, time-wise. Everyone knows paella takes longer to prepare.  Is it our fault then that we had a lengthier than usual dinner?  Surely our $everal hundred dollar tab was enough to compensate for us lingering at the table a mite longer...?  I understand that at some point every table must be turned, but he'd already stuck us way up on the 2nd level like refugees, and come on, things could have been handled with a little more finesse.  He knew very well it was my birthday, too, because someone in my party had blurted it out when we first came in.  Didn't matter though.  Manager was clearly on a mission to let us know that this was no Chili's/Cheesecake Factory/Applebee's.  No special leeway for birthday parties, no senor!\n\nI was able to beg another 5 minutes off him, but he kept hovering around... making us all feel really uncomfortable and shit.  Ok, so maybe there was a little bit of a line outside.  But why such a rush?  Lines out front are good for business, they make you look HAWT.  Lines are the must-have accessory for Fall, especially on the Valencia Corridor. \n\nAnyway, shame on you manager dude.  You know you could never get away with that in Spain.  That's ok though, because I still went out and got a good birthday drunk on nonetheless.", "author": "Molasses C."}

Lots of onions.\n2) Fried Calamari: Not bad, the dipping sauce was very plain though\n3) Asparagus: Good, but nothing spectacular, a little salty\n4) Artichoke: Very good, probably one of my favorite dishes, but some pieces seemed inedible, very tough skin.  Just make the decision to swallow it down or spit it out, don't let it linger in the in between state for too long.\n5) Potatoes with red sauce: Good, probably my second favorite thing, although fatty and not exotic it tasted good\n6) Potatoes with white sauce:  Was this just sour cream on top?  \n7) Whole Prawns with shell: I didn't try this one because I don't like to be bothered with peeling shrimp, call it lazyness, call it clenlyness, no matter I'm not going to bother expending the energy when there are other easily digestible eats nearby\n8) Garlic Shrimp with tail: I can deal with these, just bite off to the tail and it isn't too fussy, the sauce was good, but how can you screw up butter and garlic?\n9) Clams: Didn't try, not a big clam fan but they looked good as far as clams go\n10) Chicken Croquette: These were pretty good, they were what you would expect, deep fried potato filling with chicken inside.\n\nDessert\n1) Chocolate moose: The flavor wasn't consistent, did they forget to stir this thing all the way?  Some bites were sugary sweet others were dark chocolate tart.  \n2) Creme Brulee: One of the worst I've had, not sure why this was the case, maybe it was more custard than creme, the consistency wasn't smooth enough for my taste.  I didn't think a restaurant could mess this up until yesterday.\n3) Rice Pudding: Really soupy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-09-20", "description": "Let me preface this by saying that as a yelp user and member for over a year, I've oft been inspired to write reviews about food due to a phenomenal or regrettable experience. However, I'll be frank and admit that I am a lazy person, and I usually just bitch about a bad restaurant to my friends, while never fully documenting the extent of my displeasure. \n\nToday is different. \n\nThe horrible service and mediocre food I received at this restaurant compelled me to write this review. I've been to Esperpento before, probably about a year and half ago, and I remembered it to be good (not write-home-able, but good) tapas. However, tonight's experience proved vastly different, and has rendered Esperpento as null in my array of viable restaurant options in the Mission, my 'hood.\n\nMy partner and I decided to pop over to Esperpento to get some dinner, after eschewing two other eateries due to their double dolla sign status.  We'd been to Esperpento before, and thought it would be a safe, easy bet. We were wrong.\n\nFirst off, we were seated within a few minutes, which was great. We sat down and surveyed the menu, figuring out what we wanted. We closed our menus and sat patiently and watched the symphony of bad service, which was to be the story of our evening, play out. \n\nJust before we were seated and given menus, another couple walked into the restaurant that clearly knew the waitress. Not only did they walk in 10 minutes after us, but they were seated and served FOOD nearly 10 minutes before we were even asked for our drink orders. Oh wait, and actually, we WEREN'T asked for our drink orders. After getting so hungry waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (generally not a big deal), and 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a waiter or offered drinks or bread, I had to physically get up and ask the bus person if we could please have some bread. She offered to take our order and we quickly listed off our tapas choices.  We were brought our wine in a fairly reasonable time (Rioja something or other. It was no better than the 4 buck Bear's Lair Trader Joe's Cab).\nOur bread arrived shortly after, and was stale (\"authentic Spanish stale bread\" my boyfriend, who lived in Barcelona for 2 years, retorted). We nibbled on the stale bread and the dishes that followed, however, the quality was far under par. \n\nThe Jamon Serrano en Pan con Tomate was delicious (it's hard to mess up cured ham). That was were the flavor ended. The eggplant dish was mediocre, the Tortilla de Patatas was bland and flavorless, and as I write this review now, my boyfriend is lying on the couch clutching his stomach from the rancid boccarones (I didn't eat them, but he insisted).  Seriously, he is ill. What's more, we had to rally in order to get ourselves out of the place. Not once, twice, but three times did we verbally discuss a viable dine 'n ditch scenario! After our plates were cleared and we waited the usually 10 minutes, again I had to get up to ask the server for our check!\n\nOne pepto bismal tablet for my man and a beer at the phoenix to calm my  nerves, and I'm finally able to express myself about the horrible time we had at esperpento. \n\nSUMMARY (I know I can blab so here's the meaty bit)...\nGreat jamon serrano en pan con tomate, but that's where it ends.\n\nUsually, great food can erase the pain that bad service leaves, but not this time. This caliber of bad service incites a special kind of frustration, especially when guests who arrive AFTER you receive service first, and basic attention has to be requested of the wait staff by getting up out of your seat. Additionally, when the food you receive is mediocre at best and incites stomach cramping, it leaves you feeling like you've been taken advantage of. \n\nI like the idea of Esperpento: Love the ambiance, love the decorations. And I know people have bad days. However, when the waitress who was supposed to be attending our table brought our check, and innocently asked, \"How was everything?\" I quickly gave her my honest feedback. She was not phased by my complaints of unsatisfactory service and food, and replied, \"Oh.\" \n\n\"Oh\" is right.\n\nOn second thought, make that a \"NOh!\"", "author": "kristi c."}

I tasted a variety of tapas dishes such as the spicy potatoes, garlic shrimp and mushrooms, A beef stew dish that overall left a very pleasant feeling of satisfaction in the quality of food served. The ambiance of the spot was touching too...I always love the tapas spot that has multiple portraits of matadors framed and on the walls it always reminds me of Ernest Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\" which is never a bad thing to think of when you remember how good the food tastes here.", "author": "Laura G."}

We had the last table, after we were seated the wait started outside.  ;-)  The food was good, nothing spectacular, just good.  We ordered several plates to try as much as possible, and nothing was bad, but nothing stood out.  Except for the sangria, which was very good!

A million times yes!\n\nI went here last week for my birthday, and felt totally blessed things worked out the way they did. Last Saturday I was totally frustrated and still kicking myself in the ass for not planning my dinner more than 4 hours before dinner was scheduled. I called Esperpento earlier to see if they had anything open, to which they replied it would be infinitely impossible to acquiesce my request. Well, they actually said it was \"too late for reservations\" but I had to throw some big word usage on ya ass! Ya know you need it.\n\nYet right before leaving for a delectable dining experience at Friday's (yes, I was that desperate), a voice in my head told me to call Esperpento one last time. Don't worry, it wasn't the scurry *kill your Mother* type voice - more like an intuitive, calling from God, conscience type. So I called to see if they had any tables open for a party of ten. The owner's son, who's totally cool, said he would hold the table for us until we got there. He didn't even ask us how long we'd be, he just said he'd hold it. SCORE! About an hour later we all arrived, the table still held for us even though there were others waiting to be seated.\n\nRight away we ordered the seafood paella (takes 30 minutes), sangria, and the fried calamari (the best ever!). Yup, we knew our stuff. Of all the patatas, the patatas bravas were the BEST. The grilled/fried calamari dishes were both perfectly seasoned, the Champinones Al Ajillo were delicious, and the HUGE grilled veggie salad was the perfect way to add more veggies to the two GIGANTIC meat platters  (carnes de pajarillas?). Just like NKOTB, we had all the Right Stuff - Three-Points!\n\nAnother SCORE, you ask? Being seated upstairs. This was perfect for us, since there wasn't as much room downstairs for my man to stumble around half-drunk, handing out extra birthday cake to lucky patrons. It felt like I had the best of everything that night - food, companionship, laughter, and love.\n\nThe only complaint? I went here two months ago for Valentine's and noticed they jacked all tapas prices up by a dollar/two.\n\ne.g. Patatas bravas/alioli $4.50 then, $5.75 now\n       Calamares fritos $6 then, 7.75 now\n\nStill, I would definitely return to Esperpento any time!  If only to hear the owner apologize to my Filipino boyfriend for Spain's colonization of the Philippines one last time.", "author": "Charrylenne S."}

I have loved every dish that we have ordered and being that we always go in a group of at least 4 and order a lot of food, I've tried quite a bit of their dishes. The mariscada, which is a grilled seafood dish, different than paella although that is also good, is excellent as well as the potato appetizer, patatas ali-oli, which has a delicious garlic mayo sauce. The sangria and flan are delicious as well. The service is wonderful! The only thing that I don't like about this place which has nothing to do with the food is that annoying creepy tone deaf guy that goes around the place with his guitar \"singing\". Seriously, he just doesn't stop and then when he is finally done he goes from table to table staring you down for a tip. If everyone at the table doesn't give him something, he starts giving you dirty looks. How much do you expect people to tip you especially when your performance was unsolicited. They need to get rid of this guy. Minus one star for this creepy guy.\n\nTip: Try to make reservations or else you will be waiting forever! Also, parking is virtually impossible do be prepared for that.", "author": "Diane M."}

Table not ready.  Had to wait 10 minutes while they prepared an unworkable table next to the window.  Waiter arranged 5 chairs in a cramped semi-circle as half the table was up against the window....no way we could all fit in there without being jammed shoulder to shoulder.  One of the chairs was already in contact with another patron's chair at an a adjacent table.  We kindly refused the table, but the waiter said they had \"no other table to give us,\" and simply walked away and went about his business.  We were subsequently ignored, so we left.\n\nPhoned owner/manager the next day about the problem - he was not sympathetic.  I explained to him that the restaurant clearly failed our reservation.  He said a reservation is more like \"notice that you are coming\" - not really a reservation.  He defended the table by the window saying it was big enough for five - when I disputed this, he did not argue.  When I identified the waiter to him, he said that this particular waiter \"really doesn't know how to deal with customers\"......  In the end, all I got from the apathetic manager was a half-hearted - \"sorry it happened...what can I say?\"  When I stated that it was obvious he didn't care and that we would not be back, he calmly replied \"OK, thats' fine.\"\n\nMust be high times at Esperpento, where customers are clearly expendable.", "author": "Pietro S."}

When we finally got an extra plate, we kept cleaning it off and hanging on to it for dear life b/c we weren't sure if we'd get another one.  And eventhough our party was squished into a hot teeny corner in a room upstairs the size of my bedroom, at least we weren't being moved around like other parties were mid-meal.  Although many people seemed to work there with aprons on and everything, most were just ornamental by serving bread every once in awhile, without BUTTER!  The food, on the other hand, wasn't half bad.  The tortillas de patata were excellent and others raved about the other plates.

The leche flan was firm and semi-sweet which is exactly how I liked it.  They also sell authentic chorizo (not cured) from Spain & I bought the one with garlic for only $9.

I asked the owner (I assume she was the owner) if the paella for 2 would be enough for 3 if we got tapas and she said no. That didn't make sense and I didn't want to spend $46 for paella for 4 so I said we'll just take the 2 serving paella and ordered other things. My daughter and her friend were going to share it. We got 3 tapas (they were excellent) and  the meat and veggie platter, shared by the 3 adults.The meat was dry and the paella (that I tasted) was tasteless and it did not seem to be indiviually made since it came out in about 15 minutes, not the 30 minutes as stated. When the bill came and I saw that we were charged for a 4 serving portion, I asked the waiter about it and then he got the woman/owner. She agrued with me and said my 17 yr old daughter told her that we'd take the 4 portion. So she takes orders from a 17 year old when the adults clearly gave a different order?\n\nI would NEVER go back-EVER!!! To have an owner argue with a customer not to mention having to pay alot for tasteless food is irritating and a waste of time and money.

The hostess was friendly and fast in seating us, but the waiter was cranky. The food that came were all cold and undercooked. The shrimp was still gray and raw, I had to send it back to re-grilled it. The eggplant was cold and filled with grease, tasteless, my friend got a stomach ache later.  After 4 dishes, I got frustrated and stopped ordering. Dinners were like going to the flea market, fighting to get table and waiter's attention, it is not worth the trouble if you want a relaxing evening. Parking also took a while. I do like a lot of dishes and wanted to try 10 of them, but after this experience, I don't know if I want the trouble again.  I took off a star for the cold, uncooked food,  the grumpy waiter who did warm up to me later.  The place is just so loud it is hard for conversations.

The spot maybe tiny but the service and quality of food are definitely above and beyond expectation. The paella is fantastic. The sangria is delicious (could use more fruit though). And the ambiance teleports you away from the racket of the Mission and into this blissful dining experience that is one of a kind.", "author": "Richard R."}

The food tasted like it was rolled right off of a Sysco truck. Unimaginative, over-salted, overcooked.", "author": "Randy D."}

I don't understand why this restaurant is only getting 3.5 stars. \nLast night after shopping in SF, my boyfriend and I decided to have tapas for dinner. So we went on yelp to see which restaurant sounds good. Unfortunately, the wireless wasn't working really well, so we didn't really have a chance to see all the reviews for the restaurants to compare. We ended up randomly choosing a restaurant, which, apparently, is Esperpento. The parking was really hard to find, so we ended up parking on mission. So we got to Esperpento, and fortunately, there were 2 tables free. So we sat down and ordered the exotic chicken, spicy potato, grilled vegetable salad, ox-tail stew, fried calamari, and the special drink that everyone else is having. (forgot what that's called) All of the food that we ordered are really delicious, even my boyfriend who normally doesnt really eat vegetables liked the grilled veggie salad. He also said that for the red wine-lovers, they would definitely like that drink.", "author": "Gaby C."}

That's borderline ok with me as mistakes happen. The nice waitress was very apologetic and offered us free deserts which we refused due to loss of appetite. We did not mind paying the full bill and said so, but the owner had the audacity to not charge for appetizers ($10) but charged for the paella ($26). That's like saying \"We are kind of sorry\". I'm never going back here.", "author": "Chaitresh S."}

I loved the fact we were eating Spanish tapas in a cute little atmosphere which included a cute little Spanish girl.....I think her name was Rocio, or Roccia? Either way, the patatas bravas were exceptionally good, and the paella was mouth watering. Thank you, for an amazing experience in both food, atmosphere, and waitstaff. We will return!", "author": "Diana D."}
