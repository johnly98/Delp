I went in with a friend one day because we were feeling curry that day. It was pretty cramped when we came in, and it seems to be more of a takeout place since there weren't more than a dozen seats if I remember correctly. \n\nSince we got there near closing time, they ran out of the pork katsu curry, and we got the chicken katsu curry over rice instead. I ordered mine with the maximum spice level, since I like my curry spicy in general. One thing to note is that my friend ordered the same dish and we got it to eat inside, and I got my order on a plate while he got his in a to-go container, which is probably attributable to them not having enough people to wash dishes and it piling up. I don't fault them for that, but I did think that this is a very fast paced place. I thought the chicken curry was pretty good, and I'm not a huge fan of chicken in general. \n\nI came back another time because I was intrigued by their noodle dishes, and I got the spicy udon, which is the spicy ground beef curry udon, which had a more thicker base. I always thought that thicker curry and udon went well together, and I was very pleased with spicy noodle. The portion were a bit small for the spicy noodle, but still filling if you take your time to eat. Slightly prefer the chicken curry over the spicy noodle because of the chicken katsu.\n\nI haven't had a chance to taste the croquettes yet, and I could see myself coming back here to try their other curry noodle dishes. Overall, a solid four for FiDi, and I look forward to coming back here. Highly recommended since there's not really another place like this nearby.", "author": "Nelson X."}

Muracci's can probably fit less than 5 people comfortably combined with the customers waiting for their takeout orders. I ordered the chicken katsu curry, which comes with a heaping portion of rice, curry, chicken katsu, and a small portion of their house pickles. I opted for the mild curry and the spiciness level was great! You can choose between mild, medium, or hot. The chicken katsu curry is almost $13, which is expensive in my opinion and somewhat slightly off-putting.\n\nHonestly, it was just okay! The chicken katsu was slightly dry, not seasoned very well and the curry tasted slightly off; I can't really pinpoint what it was. Maybe it was burnt? I had leftovers, but I didn't finish them.\n\nIf you want a good plate of chicken katsu curry, go to Bhugay's in Oakland! They are always consistent and never disappoint", "author": "Joyce E."}

The line wasn't out the door as many people have experienced at lunch time, but a number of people had already ordered and were waiting for their food. But the line moves fast here and the food comes fast, too.\n\nI went with the karaage curry, hot, with white rice ($12.45) and extra rice ($3.00). I also got the curry pan ($3.50) and learned from the cashier that the type of curry pan on offer changes daily. The Monday special was chicken. I bought a piece of the strawberry roll cake, as well ($2.45). My boyfriend got the katsu don ($11.20).\n\nSeating here is extremely limited, so everything is served in to-go packaging in case you more than likely need to take your food elsewhere because there's nowhere to sit. Luckily my boyfriend and I grabbed the tiny table for two around the corner from the cashwrap and got to eat in peace, out of the way of waiting guests.\n\nI was surprised how big my plate of food was; this doesn't happen to me very often, but I actually ended up getting two meals out of this plate. Admittedly, I felt that there could've been a few mores pieces of karaage, but getting lunch and dinner out of one meal made up for that in my mind. I appreciated that the curry sauce was in its own separate container and I could add it to the plate according to my own preference. The curry was delicious and spicy, but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was cooked well and juicy on the inside.\n\nMy boyfriend felt his katsu don was solid all around and a hefty amount of food for the price, though his only complaint was that the bowl is served with a lid. That causes the contents of the bowl to steam a bit, so the katsu isn't as crispy as it could be, which might be a bigger issue if you're taking your food to-go.\n\nI wish we'd ordered two of the curry pan because that was so good. The bread was a little crisp, golden, and the chicken curry on the inside was well flavored. I ate the cake for dessert with dinner and thought it was a good amount of sweet without being sickeningly so, and the cake was soft and spongy.\n\nAll in all, a very impressive first impression from Muracci's for me. I really can't wait to go back and get more curry, and definitely order more than one curry pan. If you can, show up after noon to avoid the line-out-the-door lunch rush, though it seems like there's going to be a number of people here no matter what time you show up. With good reason!

And what is this pathetic diluted watery curry sauce? It also came with gingers for sushi. Why? Beats me! And you can't just add chili powder and call it \"spicy.\" Really stingy on the amount of curry sauce they give you as well. \n\n2) Karaage Lunch Set ($11.75): Burnt and unappetizing.

I didn't even want to try the potato salad or the miso soup. \n\nThe food was cold and felt like they were left outside for a long time. We took couple bites and threw them away.

Again, I've definitely had much better curry before, but it was pretty good.

However, each time it disappointed my cravings. First time I ordered it, the pork was super dry and the katsu itself was not too tasty. I thought I came on an off day and was willing to give another try. And another try. And another try. Ordered it 3 more times, and it confirmed that I will not be ordering it again as they were consistently super dry and tough and chewy. The reason I gave it multiple tries is because the katsu was crunchy, which I like, and the curry that came in a separate container was delicious.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry: it was actually a little better than the pork katsu because the chicken meat was not dry in the middle. \n\nSpicy Noodle: I finally found a winner here. This spicy curry deliciousness was finally able to satisfy my cravings!

Nothing too special in my opinion.\n\nI got the Chicken Katsu over Brown Rice with Mild Curry for lunch to-go. I ordered via Yelp with their Eat24 service and was able to apply a coupon so that was nice. Around $11 after taxes even with the coupon. When we got there around 12:10pm on a Friday, there was already a huge line from the lunch rush, but luckily since we had already ordered online, we were able to just go in and pick up our food. There's a shelf in the very back where all the online and phone orders were. You just look for your name, sign on the paper, leave the paper behind, and leave with your food. There's not much seating here so if you come here, expect to get your food to-go.\n\nBack at the office, the Katsu wasn't as crunchy. I'm sure it's a little bit crunchier if you eat it right away. The mild curry did have a kick, but nothing too bad. My coworkers were suffering from their medium curry so I'm sure the medium curry is no joke. The chicken was a bit bland and even with the curry, it wasn't too outstanding. There weren't a lot of pieces of chicken and very little cabbage. There was however a LOT of rice. Just wish they had more meat or veggies compared to the substantial amounts of rice.\n\nOverall this place was decent. Depending if you can eat a lot, this place may not fill you up.

I could barely taste the chicken from my katsu because it was practically 1/3 chicken 2/3 breading. \n\nFor $13 though it will stuff you up. I shared this dish and I felt pretty content.

This is a better place to-go if you have a nearby office as it gets crowded very quickly.\n\nThe food came, and the chicken was very crispy!

They've also recently improved the ordering process where they take your order at the door and your food is ready by the time it's your turn to pay. This means that you don't have to spend a lot of time inside the store and that is a big win IMO. That being said, even if you have to stand in line for some time, it will be totally worthwhile. \n\nI usually get the Chicken Karaage or Katsu Curry 3X spicy with brown rice and extra curry (Japacurry fans beware; Muracci's is not on the same spice level scale. It's much much spicier!). Honestly, I'd suggest you start with the medium spice level if you can't handle red chili powder. It is this spicy since they add the raw powder on top of the curry which makes your tongue and throat burn since the curry hasn't been cooked with the chili (Trust me, it's totally worth it!!).\n\nIf you're in the area and reading this review, walk in the door right now.

At the peak lunch hour there was a line that extended to the entrance of the restaurant next to it. I dutifully got in line and waited for my turn which came up in about 10-12 minutes.\n\nThe ordering process here is a little strange as you step into the restaurant there is a host at the door that takes your order, screams it to the people behind the counter and hands you a paper with the selections that you hand over to the person behind the counter, pay and try to find an empty spot to wait for your food.\n\nI decided to get the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice ($11.45) and went with the normal steamed rice and hot level for the curry. After a cramped 10 minute wait I was finally on my way. The first thing I noticed was that they had packaged the curry separately which was a good start. The chicken katsu was a decent lunch sized portion. I felt that it had been in the fryer a tad bit too long making it a little crispier that what I'm normally used to. The meat was not dry but at the same time it was not juicy either. The rice was not sushi grade but was of a decent quality. The hot curry had a taste of raw spices. It felt like they had taken the base curry and just mixed in a lot of spices and sent it on its way as opposed to having prepared a separate hot curry (I may be wrong but that's just how it tasted). Overall I felt that this was an average dish, definitely not bad but not very good either.\n\nPricewise it was about 15% more expensive than L&L Hawaiian Barbecue and the Japanese restaurant in the Internation Food Court both of which are just across the road.

I got the chicken katsu curry with mild spiciness. The curry was delicious and had a tinge of spiciness, but not too overwhelming. The chicken katsu, however, was a little burnt and dry, so it didn't really enhance the meal at all. Overall, this is a great place if you're craving curry!", "author": "Lisa C."}

My boyfriend ordered katsu + curry and I ordered just katsu. When we walked back to his office to have lunch, there was only rice in my to-go box. We shared his katsu + curry (which was delicious) and walked back to Muracci's. They were nice and gave the correct order but overall it was an unsuccessful lunch and extremely upsetting because we wasted quite a bit of time.

Japanese curry is one of my loves n I first fell in love eating it in its point of origin, Japan. my favorite specialty curry shop in the Bay Area was in Los Gatos. surprise! it was Muracci's Japanese Curry & Grill. yep, it was their second shop. it was such a sad sad day when I found out they were closing that shop down. : / a great Japanese restaurant that only does curries  isn't easy to find. \n\nI've never come to this SF location before so I was overly enthusiastic n brimming to the top with high hopes for eating a plate of Muracci's curry again. we turned down Kearny so we were expecting to c a sign on the wall soon, but we had walked almost to the end of the block n still no Muracci's! so we doubled back n walked slowly making sure we didn't miss it again. (now that I think about it, we should've used Google Maps. duh!) so the shop is located 3 stores down from the hair salon. the name of the shop is way above the door n hidden behind a protruding shelf so it's easy to miss. this tiny shop is literally a hole in the wall.\n\nthe shop is so tiny there's no tables; only some stools by the windows which makes it really cramped for ppl going to the restroom. (yep, there is a bathroom in this teeny tiny space.) u order at the cash register, pay, then u wait for your order to b called. it's a buy n leave kinda place. if u want to sit n eat there, u better get there early to grab one of the seats at the windows which is good for ppl watching also. thank god we got there early. there was a long line forming out the door after we finished n left. \n\nmy wait for their curry seemed forever, but lo n behold, there it was steaming hot in front of me n I was in heaven! omg, it was so DE-LICIOUS. it reminded me of the Katsu n Chicken Curry dishes I had at the Los Gatos location. the chicken was crispy from the panko on the surface n juicy on the inside. they give u a container with the curry separately so u have to empty it onto the meat n rice yourself. I ordered mine medium spicy so that was perfect for me. mild is always good too, but I like it with a bit of spice. : ) \n\nit's too bad their only shop exists only in SF now.

You probably won't go out of your way here since parking WILL be a huge pain in the butt. There's also no way you would want to come during a weekday lunch because you'll be stuck in a line along with the Financial District workers. If anything, come after work hours or on a weekend. \n\nThere's two counters which seat like 4 people each. On a 5pm Monday, there was no line, but the order took quite a while. They take phone calls which comprised of half their orders at that time. One tofu & vegetable curry udon, hot level please! It was about 15 minutes give or take. For a 4 star place with over 1k reviews, I'll wait any day. \n \nThis is my FAVORITE. The taste actually had taste and it wasn't just salty or spicy. It was a wonderful bowl of different aromas that made it very hard to stop eating regardless of how much I was sweating. For those spicy loving foodies, try the hot. Although you'll be begging for some milk tea, it was ridiculously satisfying. There was a good amount of tofu & vegetable that actually made me feel like I got my moneys worth. I finished the bowl with not a drop left. With tax, it came out to be ~$10. Somewhat of an average price, but it's nothing compared to having the curry of your life. \n\nYou're in for a treat if you're able to snag an order of their curry pan.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-10", "description": "Muracci's is owned by husband and wife team from Osaka, and named after a nickname for their son. How cute! Even before I looked up the history on their website for this Yelp review, based on taste alone I noticed the unusually fresh and homemade element--either there is a blatantly obvious difference compared to your typical katsu curry, or I'm finally developing some serious food critic skills.\n\n[TL;DR] Homemade style with skilled use of herbs and spices. Would recommend for anyone with a marginal liking for katsu curry.\n\n[THE BACKGROUND]\n\nSo the boo had a katsu craving a few months ago, which prompted me to investigate katsu places in SF. Volcano turned out to be underwhelming (watered-down, and Americanized), Kare-Ken is in the Tenderloin (no we are not sheltered and na\u00efve as to think we'll get mugged eating katsu in the Tenderloin... it's just out of the way), and Muracci's remained on the radar. I therefore made the executive decision to give it a try when we were foraging for lunch around the much-touristy-and-overpriced Union Square area.\n\n[THE AMBIANCE]\n\nBecause it's small and the interior d\u00e9cor doesn't go all-out, Muracci's could be classified as a hole-in-the-wall. Granted you could snag a seat, the dining experience is not bad--the bar stools add a modern touch, and we enjoyed the sunlight and people-watching at the storefront window (or perhaps more like people watching us inhaling the delish curry).\n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nI got the TOFU AND VEGETABLES CURRY ($9) because I felt in dire need of veggies. It's not as sad as it sounds though; the fried tofu, veggies, and brown rice blended into the curry really well. It could have used more assorted/pickled veggies, but I was very impressed with the curry. According to their website, the wife owner \"lovingly prepares\" the curry sauce over 2 days. You could definitely taste the superior quality over those box curries (which I'm sure are manufactured with no love at all). \n\nI stole some pieces of the bf's CHICKEN KATSU CURRY ($9) and I honestly do not know if I've ever had such good katsu. The chicken was tender and juicy, surrounded by a delightful thin panko coating. Dip into the magical curry, devour while the katsu is still crunchy, and you'll be as happy as the grinning Muracci icon.\n\n[OTHER NOTES]\n\n- Prices are not cheap, but for SF it is rather inexpensive at ~$10 or a little more for a filling entr\u00e9e\n- Props to the brown rice option at no extra cost!\n- They have weekly specials but it's not available on weekends\n- There's a small selection of enticing desserts, including roll cakes and dorayaki\n- They serve most food in to-go containers so overall it feels quite street-foody\n- Trash can says \"regular trash only\".... seriously wondering what irregular trash consists of", "author": "Edna C."}

So I got the regular Chicken Curry instead with brown rice. Since they didn't have to fry it or anything, it was way quicker than some other orders. I waited at the side for about 3 minutes tops for them to call my number.\n\nI don't think they expect anyone to eat there at all because they don't ask if you're eating in or taking out. They DO ask if you'll need a bag though - be smart, take the bag OR bring your own bag. I didn't because the whole waste of plastic thing, but I was worrying that I'd drop all my food if I didn't hold it with both hands all the way back to the office. They give you one thin takeout box, one container for the curry, and utensils wrapped in some napkins. Don't be alarmed when you open your box to see just rice and some pickled veggies (?) in the corner. The meat is IN your curry container!\n\nI think I understand why it's my uncle's favorite though - the spicy. I ordered a mild and I feel it was slightly more medium.

There are two Muracci's locations in the Bay Area: this one in San Francisco's Financial District and another in Berkeley. The SF FiDi location is a tiny hole in the wall. The food is both affordable and delicious.\n\nI was confused by the name Muracci's. While the name doesn't look Japanese, the food is quite authentic. Muracci is the name of the owners' son. The owners are from Osaka, Japan. According to the menu, the restaurant's curry sauce takes two days to prepare. It comes from a special recipe from Muracci's mom, Tamiko Murata.\n\nMainly open for lunch and early dinner six days a week (closed on Sunday), Muracci's specializes in Japanese curry (almost 10 different varieties), donburi rice bowls, curry noodles, simple sushi rolls (e.g. California rolls), and various Japanese snacks and side dishes such as fried ebi (shrimp), agedashi tofu (deep-fried tofu), and karaage (fried chicken). Filling curry entrees run about $10-11 each and most snacks under $8-9 each.\n\nThere's seating inside the narrow space, but not much. Total seating capacity is about 10. There are two four-person counters, one against the window facing the street and one against a side wall facing a mirror. There's a small table by the kitchen with seating for two. I saw many folks getting their orders to-go in Styrofoam containers. If you order in, trays are brought out to you and the food is served on actual plateware. Water and tea are complimentary and available self-serve in the back. There is a single clean restroom.\n\nIf you want to get the good stuff, go early! We visited around 4pm on a Thursday, after the weekday lunch rush. Unfortunately, the restaurant had run out of our first two choices, the Katsu Curry (fried pork cutlet with curry sauce) and Curry Pan (baked curry bread pouch). Normally, you can find the Curry Pans sitting right next to the cash register underneath a heat lamp. They'd already been completely wiped clean during our visit. I next thought about ordering the Beef Curry, but the lady behind the counter warned us the beef might be unusually tough and chewy. I didn't fully understand her reasoning, but it had to do with the cooking and prep time.\n\nWe ended up trying the Chicken Katsu Curry (#4 on menu, $10.45) and the Spicy Noodle ($9.95, #34 on menu). I was quite pleased with both dishes, particularly the former. The Chicken Katsu Curry was essentially like the Katsu Curry, but made with chicken instead of pork (tonkatsu). The breaded meat was still crispy and savory. There was a generous portion of rich, creamy, brown curry sauce. I was impressed with it. It had great flavor. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. Even after finishing the chicken, I kept eating spoonfuls curry with rice. By the way, you have the choice of both white rice and brown rice.\n\nThe curry entree came with a couple different pickled vegetables: red fukujinzuke (which can be made from a variety of vegetables, not sure specifically which one I tried here) and pickled cabbage. They were appetizingly crisp and tart.\n\nThe Spicy Noodle bowl was interesting. You have the choice of udon (thick white noodles) or ramen (thinner yellow noodles). We went with udon. Udon and ramen noodles are typically served in a soup broth. At Muracci's, these noodles are served smothered in curry sauce. The Spicy Noodle bowl contained ground beef topped with freshly chopped green onion. It was indeed spicy and every bit as flavorful as the curry used in the Katsu dish we tried. I'm pretty sure it was the exact same sauce.\n\nI think it's hard to go wrong with the curry dishes here, especially the Katsu.\n\nThere's a display case next to the checkout counter selling pre-packaged containers of Japanese pickles, salads, and plastic-wrapped slices of roll (swirl) cakes (green tea, strawberry, cocoa, tora) and three different kinds of mochi (Japanese rice cakes - white, red bean, green tea).\n\nService is good. It took a few minutes for our orders to come out, but I think that's because the staff were freshly preparing several of the ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful.

All their curry dishes are around $8-$10 and come in a take-out box since I guess they assume everyone who visits works in FiDi wants to take it back to their office and the shop itself is VERY small; only two spots for seating in front of the mirror and by the window. \n\nI thought portions of the food were a good size, considering how food is expensive in FiDi and there isn't much, but this was enough to get me full without any leftovers. Foodie friend and I had the same opinion that the curry here is very mild; not too salty, but not too rich. We THINK that no meat is used to flavor the curry itself, but I would ask in case this was a concern. Otherwise, chicken was super tender and had a piece of the katsu; can't go wrong with it as well. They separate the curry sauce (if you get meat, it's already in the curry. If fried meat, comes in the box) from the rice which is nice, so it doesn't get soggy.\n\nI'd come back if I was having lunch with a friend in FiDi, but I wouldn't go out of my way.

It's understandable since they have to serve numerous customers in the most efficient amount of time. Overall, it was more warm than hot and the flavor wasn't there.

They have curry over rice, curry over noodles, or curry bread. My favorite? Definitely the curry over rice. The chicken katsu over rice was served on a large plate with some pickled vegetables. You can pick between white or brown rice, or you can even do half half. You can also pick the level of spiciness. \n\nThere are a lot of other things I want to try on their menu, and I'm hoping they're as appetizing as the pictures look! Besides rice and noodle dishes, they also have small snacks and desserts. They don't have a lot of seating, which is why people usually take food to go.

I ordered the veggie curry udon, which came with plenty of tofu, broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers. It was tasty, but nothing special. \n\nMy bf ordered the salmon curry. Please don't order this - it was no good and not worth it. It was a tiny piece of salmon and super fishy tasting. Worse of all, it cost the same as the katsu curry where you get WAY more meat. It cost more than my udon as well, I think $13 + tax. \n\nMy sister and I also shared the fried curry bread. It was disappointing for me. The curry was lukewarm and most of it was fried breaded crust, so nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. If you want a quick lunch, then maybe stop by.

Various cultures will have their own interpretations of fried chicken: all of them are very good but very different from one another. You wouldn't compare Japanese fried chicken to Korean fried chicken right? So it would be unfair to do the same comparison for curry. However, unlike fried chicken, there really aren't enough places in SF that serves Japanese curry which means if I said this place was 2nd best curry in SF that wouldn't mean much if there were only two Japanese curry shops in the city (I've only found two so far). \n\nAs far as Japanese curry goes, this place is certainly worlds better than the garbage House curry packages you can find in the Japanese grocery chain. Rather than a bland taste of curry and sweetness which seems to be the general consensus of Japanese curry, the flavors are a pretty good blend of spicy, sweet, and salty. The curry is just the right amount of richness so you can get all of the flavors which is made even better by the red pickles that come with your order. My personal go-to is the pork katsu curry plate since the pork katsu is tender on the inside and crisp on the outside which works well with the curry. It's not quite the flavor mom has for her homemade curry, but it certainly isn't far off.", "author": "Ray L."}

Since I was feeling a little under the weather, I wanted some spicy curry to gulp down.\n\nTheir location on Kearny St is a bit smaller than their location in Los Altos (RIP), with two rows of counters on the wall. Surprisingly crowded for 3pm, but we received our food rather quickly and the staff wasn't overwhelmed--rather, they were quite pleasant!\n\nIf you're craving curry, it helps to get there early; by the time we got there, they were out of about a quarter of the menu toppings (popular items seem to be ebi fry, cheese, and pork katsu).\n\nPortion sizes are generous and worth the price (~$10 per plate), IMO. The plate is split pretty evenly down the middle in terms of rice to curry roux. There are also sweet pickles on the side to cleanse your palate. The curry has the consistency of thick gravy (not too watery) and you can tell it's better than the instant stuff. It's not too salty or full of MSG and has a more complex flavor, with tones of tomato, herbs, and spices. Their \"hot\" spicy curry won't burn your tongue off, but it helped decongest me a bit. You can also choose from brown or white rice, with no extra charge for the brown rice!\n\nFrom the limited options available, we went for the chicken katsu and the tofu&veggie toppings. The chicken katsu was top notch, crispy crunchy, and the breading was actually adhesive (instead of falling off). The chicken was juicy and tender, too. The tofu was lightly fried so it was crispy on the outside and the vegetables were soft but not overdone.\n\nWith that, Muracci's has leapt to first place in terms of my favorite Japanese curry in SF.\n\nI'll have to come back to try the curry noodle soups.", "author": "Jade V."}

It's a VERY small restaurant, with ~4 seats in line against the wall, and another maybe 6-8 seats in line along the front window.  Note that they typically do not do sushi on weekends.  The staff is friendly and responsive.  I had the Katsu Curry (pork cutlets with curry).  It comes with a side of white rice or brown and some pickled vegetables.  You can have your curry mild, medium, or hot.  The curry is naturally spicy already, so just keep that in mind - you are just adding more spice.  I thought they made it pretty fast, less than 10 min wait.  The katsu was very crispy and cooked well.  The curry sauce itself was OK, the flavor was very common for me.  Medium spicy had the right amount of heat, but most people not accustomed to this kind of cuisine or other cultural foods will find that mild is probably too much to handle (you know who you are =P).  The portion size is good, it will fill you up!  I could have eaten more, but I was still satisfied.\n\nMy girlfriend had the spicy noodle.  You get a choice of ramen or udon, she had udon with hot spicy level.  It was really spicy, scorching, but she likes it that way.  Portion size was deceiving, it looked like a small dinky bowl of noodles, but she was stuffed after it.  Watchout guys =)!  The sauce is very thick with ground beef and green onions, it's like japanese spaghetti, don't think of it as like a noodle soup dish, but instead, a thick noodle curry dish.  \n\nWe also had the curry pan - hot, which was not that spicy.  The filling size is decent and the crispy dough/pastry was delicious.  It's like a japanese empanada - must try!  Overall, we'd rate this $$ instead of $, it's kind of expensive for a \"fast food\" style place.  We'd come back though, it's definitely worth trying!", "author": "Kevin N."}

I really wanted to like this place but it fell short of my expectations. \n\nIt is pretty small inside so I wouldn't recommend bringing a crowd with you during their busy dinner hours. There was bar style seating with wooden stools. You can get cold water from the container located towards the back. I don't recall seeing a bathroom available. Service was ok, not rude but not memorable either.\n\nThe curry pan was very popular and had already sold out by the time I arrived. Before I visited this place, I looked up the menu on their website and had picked out the tofu and vegetable curry with rice. The picture on the site showed the dish had a nice, even ratio of how much rice you get versus curry and veggies. I ordered it and chose the mild heat option. \n\nMy total was almost ten dollars, so I was shocked to see the amount of tofu and vegetables I got on my plate. Good thing I ordered brown rice because I pretty much ended up eating mostly curry flavored carbs. Somewhere on the wall, they announced increases in prices after a certain date. I understand San Francisco's rent prices are insane but is it too much to ask for a few extra carrots and peppers so my glucose levels don't overload? Well technically, you can but you have to shell out some extra $1.50 for it. \n\nThe curry had a soupy consistency. It wasn't necessarily a negative point for me but maybe some people would like their curry more thicker. If there were more vegetables provided, it would have balanced it out more because I just ended up with mostly soaked rice to eat. A couple positives: The curry had a nice savory taste and the few vegetables I got were hot and cooked fine (not over/under cooked). I did enjoy the red and white pickles that came with the plate. They were crisp and packed a punch flavor wise. I wish I had more of those to mix in with my rice. \n\nDue to all the rave reviews, I want to give them the benefit of a doubt and the possibility that they were having an \"off day\". However, I am very hesitant to come back and give them a second chance because I really don't want to experience feeling ripped off again.", "author": "S A."}

In hindsight, spicy was not spicy, but you actually need to 5x or more the spicy for it to be considered hot. Ordering during lunch hour was a breeze, in and out in 10 minutes. The guy taking your order in line expedites this so much better than you'd think. \n\nIf I were to go back, cough. I mean when I go back, I'd order the tori katsu, with white rice (people, do you know that there is better nutrition in white rice than brown? ugh), extra sauce, and 5x spicy. If there are croquettes, you know I'll be ordering them. \n\nThe croquette was great, btw. You should get one if they have them.", "author": "Eric A."}

This place is small but definitely worth the lack of space. I ordered the pork belly curry with a curry pan on the side. The curry pan was so savory and hot it made an excellent appetizer. But that pork belly curry, oh my jesus, that was a orgasmic experience. At first glance my eyes went straight for that huge layer of fat. I know pork belly is fatty but this one was extra fatty. I hate fat OR SO I THOUGH. I poured my hot curry all over it and took a bite. The fat just melted in your mouth in the best possible way. It was like drinking bacon which is probably what it was. I had to NOM NOM NOM as fast as I could because I couldn't get enough. I even forgot to breath at one point. Even the pickled veggies that came with it made a perfect accompaniment to cut through the heavenly pork belly fat. YOU NEED TO GO HERE. It is a must.

A ringing endorsement, if I ever heard one! Unfortunately, my mom doesn't make curry (she makes a mean egg salad, though) and my S&B curry leaves something to be desired. So, finding myself in San Francisco one afternoon, I made my way down Kearney, in search of Muracci's mythical homestyle curry. \n\nIn a city booming and busting with food trends, it seems that Muracci's popularity has in no way declined since opening. Locating this hole-in-the-wall was easy; I scanned Kearney for a line of hungry lunchers spilling out onto the sidewalk, and made my way in toward the counter. Ordering was also easy- as everyone was ordering the chicken katsu curry, I saw no reason to buck the trend.\n\n10 minutes later, I was sitting in front of a bento packed with warm, fluffy rice, chicken katsu, and bright, pickled veggies. The katsu --thick, tender slices of chicken breast beneath a crisp, golden crust-- was particularly well-prepared, and stayed crisp even after a 10 minute walk to my next destination. The curry sauce lent a warming shichimi kick to the entire dish, and paired well with the spicy, tangy cabbage and daikon radish slices, which (alongside the katsu) were the bright stars of the dish. I was surprised to find that I wasn't floored by the curry itself, but grant that it did its job in pulling the bento together. \n\nWhat's really amazing (but also infuriating to me, as an out-of-towner) is how accessible and easy it is to enjoy an inexpensive, good --and I mean good-- lunch in downtown SF. If you have 20 minutes to spare, you too, can have hot and fresh Japanese comfort food.\n\nFiDi'ers have got it good...", "author": "Tianyi S."}

But given that I've always said \"food comes first,\" I was always going to give it a shot.  Plus Japanese curry doesn't really come around all that often, and when there's a good spot, you gotta take it.\n\nHad the chicken katsu curry.  I was pleasantly surprised that they used white meat instead of dark meat, because I'm always used to getting dark meat for my katsu fry-ups.  I was doubly surprised that they had a brown rice option.  It's good because..well, if you're a health freak, honestly you'd never come here in the first place.  But at least if you're trying to watch yourself, you can mitigate the damage (supposedly).  Anyways, it was definitely a good lunch.\n\nI do appreciate how they know the long line (and yes, it gets LONG) is coming and they have someone taking orders while you're line.  Then you just pay after that.  And they are VERY fast despite the line.  Bonus points for speed of food delivery.\n\nProblem is, this isn't exactly a sitdown place.  Yeah, they DO have chairs...about a grand total of seven of them.  If you want to eat here for lunch, better get here early or else be ready to just take it to go.\n\nNext time, pork cutlet for sure.  And must try the Curry Pan!

I've been coming here almost weekly since close to when they first opened.  Sadly over the past year, it's increasingly frustrating to step foot in the place.  The joint is tiny but due to the rise of the tech companies and army of tech bros, this place is nearly impossible to get in and out in a reasonable time.  First, the bros seem to constantly bring their entire offices here.  Bad enough you have to endure the constant chatter of their next lame startup idea that's just another rip off of something else but line is down the street often by 11:45.  Second, these tech (and admittedly other) companies place large pick up orders on a regular basis.  I'm glad Muracci's is doing well but they are forgetting the loyal fans that got them here in the first place.  See, they will prepare all the large orders as they come in before making any others which is often as the lunch rush is beginning.  If you unluckily order behind one of these, well, you're sh*t out of luck.  You get to wait 30 minutes for your order, at least.  I can't think of very many times this hasn't happened in recent months.  Sucks, sorry Muracci, but you're losing a lifelong customer.", "author": "Figaro D."}

The base does not appear to be coconut milk or to contain any dairy, for that matter.  I always get the salmon curry with brown rice.  If I'm wrong and this curry is dairy based, I do not want to know about it. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  I love the brown rice option as well. \n\n(2) Timing. During the lunch hour, Muracci's goes ape, and it's unpleasant. It's a good plan to go earlier or later than noon (although that's pretty much the consensus with any lunch spot at noon), which brings me to my next point. \n\n(3) Tiny. Muracci's is the definition of tiny. No, you may not dine in. There's a long line going out the door usually, and someone walks through the line and takes your order. It's best to have your act together so you don't hold things up, especially if I am in line behind you. If you special order be prepared to wait.\n\n(4) Potato Pancake. Of course you want one of those. So good. \n\n(5) Sriracha. You can order your curry mild, medium or hot. I like it hot, but Muracci's version of \"hot\" is only hot if you are a little beech. \n\nSo I'm paying my tab and I asked if they had sriracha. The cashier looked at me as though I had suddenly caught on fire. I became instantly confused. Did I say sriracha incorrectly? Was this not Japanese curry? I became flummoxed. I said, \"sriracha(?)\" again, with pause. The cashier just looked at me like, \"What the hell is sriracha?\"  Completely confused, I looked to my friend for help. She's a lot mouthier than me (imagine that)--so she asked forthrightly, \"Are you serious? You don't know sriracha?\"  Indeed, I'm pretty sure it's the official hot sauce of San Francisco. I put that sh** on everything. The cashier turned to ask the cooks--sriracha? They said no, but at least they knew what it was. They gave me chili powder on the side, which is not an acceptable substitute, as you well know. But not a big deal--I just wanted to know if they had it, because if so, I'm down. I ended up having to wait a lot longer for my order because I made this (what I thought was a simple) request. Whoops. Lesson: Muracci's does not have sriracha.

When I asked I was told it was all chicken-based, then when I started to leave they called back and asked the kitchen, who said they had veggie-based as well. It's worth mentioning they were out of brown rice when I got there, as it was their off day and they didn't have a lot of customers.\n\nAnyway, this wouldn't be so bad if the food was good - and it wasn't:\nCurry - Watery and flavorless, I also ordered my curry hot and it had absolutely no kick to it. The veggies were super-inconsistently cut, some carrot slices were about die sized and another was so big it did not fit in my mouth.\nRice - very dry, it tasted like it had just been sitting out for hours. Maybe they were scraping the bottom of a rice cooker?\n\nThe pickled ginger was fine, I assume they purchase that as is. There was some cabbage, too. Traditionally that would be fresh shaved cabbage, in this case it was extra funky, like they tried to pickled it and something went off in the fermentation process.

Muracci's is all about the amazing Japanese katsu curry served in a tiny and immensely popular hole-in-the-wall in the middle of dirty Kearny.  \n\nIf you work in the FiDi, chances are that I'm preaching to the choir.  Muracci's fans have understandably been forgiving of the longer wait necessary for freshly prepared, non pre-cooked katsu, karaage, ebi fry, etc.  Management made minor but effective adjustments that minimize the wait time.  The charming elderly owner, Yasuyuki Murata, now takes orders while you stand in line, so the staff prepares your curry while you stand in line to pay.  They also came up with an express curry line to go along with phone ordering system.  Such simple adjustments isolates the wait to the prep time, not the time to take orders and payments.  Nicely done.\n\nThe katsu curry continues to amaze.  The pork cutlet pieces are fried just right, perfectly crispy outside, juicy and tender inside, and hot all over.  It helps that they serve the curry on the side, pretty clever if you ask me.  Awesome curry as well, perhaps to be expected as it takes two days to prepare, and even the red special pickles on the side are delicious, breaking up monotonous flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-29", "description": "I'm all about curry. Spicy, creamy, and downright hearty is my favorite type. I was a military brat and while my dad was stationed in Japan, I lived in a small town called Sasebo on the island of Kyushu. All through middle and high school,  I spent majority of my youth there and from my earliest memory, it was there that I was first exposed to curry. \n\nGrowing up in Japan, curry was my favorite dish. Beef, tonkatsu (pork cutlet), or chicken; I loved em all. I love the side of red Fukujinzuke (relished pickle; had to look that one up) and how it added a certain sourness and crunchy texture to the creamy delight. This is my version of \"soul food\". It had been 13+ yrs since I had authentic Japanese curry, so you can imagine how ecstatic I was when Jason S. had found this gem (thanks Yelp) and suggested that I pay a visit.  \n\nI work in the FiDi, so one random afternoon, I coordinate a meetup with Jason S. to try the infamous Muracci's. First impression: cramped. With the lunch line of 10 people, it was already spilling over into the sidewalk. There was a \"small\" (and I use that term loosely), sitting area that sat less than 5 people. As I get to the front of the line, I'm distracted by the tempting display of korokke (potato croquette). \"Do you want to add korokke?\" says the cashier. \"Uhhh sure let's do it!\" I reply. After all, you can never, really, go wrong with fried carbs.\n\nThat day, we ordered pork katsu (tonkatsu) and beef curry and opted to sit above the Crocker Galleria to enjoy our lunch. When I opened up the plastic lid, I noticed that it smelled and looked like Japanese curry, but the taste was not. It tasted like the same basic ingredients: onions, garlic, peppers, S&B curry cube, but so much greasier than I had anticipated. Look, I enjoy grease in my food, but to add more fat to an, already rich, food and that's just obscene.  Sure, the tonkatsu was perfectly fried and white rice was as fluffy as clouds, but the sauce! Oh the sauce. Needless to say, I'm not a huge fan of greasy curry. The ironic thing is that I wanna love Muracci's, I really do!  But sadly, Muracci's take on Japan's \"national dish\" was a flop. The only saving grace was the amazingly crunch-on-the-outside-but-so-fluffy-on-the-inside croquette. That was an A+ in my book.\n\nThe closest thing I've had to to the Japanese curry I had in Japan has been at Ringer Hut (Saratoga, CA). It's been nearly 13+ yrs since I've had authentic Japanese but until I am able to go back to Japan, I'm still on my search for my favorite Japanese dish.", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

This last time, I poured through numerous photos on YELP and the chicken Katsu called me over.\n\nFirst time having chicken Katsu...EVER!  it disapponinted me.  It was crunchy and tasty on the outside but the inside was super dry.  And even dosing it with curry, you can still taste how dry the chicken was.  The curry, which is served to the side, was still good though.\n\nEven at this, I imagine I'll still be back to give it a second try.  Other Yelpers raved over this dish, so, I'm chucking this as a bad day for Muracci's.  Yep.", "author": "Jenny T."}

It looked like a pretty filling portion when I first got it. Mixed the sauze & noodles & oh my goodness was it justtt sooo goooooood. I started to feel full when I was about 3/4ths done, but couldn't stop picking at it because it was so good. I finished it and knew I would regret it later. .. it's ok tho cus yolo. lol. I def would love to come here again. I never really even crave japanese curry, but after having their spicy noodles, I can already feel an itch to go back. Their sauce is already spicy, hence the name, and I usually can handle spicy but it came with the perfect kick when I asked for mild. If you're a first timer, I would say stick to mild & u can always make it spicier. Since it's such a teensy spot, seating is limited. There was a bar table with 4 seats behind the cashier, and around the other side is about 2 tiny tables.", "author": "Elise T."}

Upon stepping into the narrow confines that place you shoulder to shoulder with those awaiting their finished orders, the waft of heavy, salty air from the work of the flurry of cooks causes uncontrollable salivation.\n\nMuracci's pork katsu is evenly breaded, coated just enough to provide a crispy jacket for the juicy meat, while the ebi fry is plump and fulfilling, despite being 3 pieces per order. Both display an admirable resistance to the temptation to over coat with breading, which inevitably leads to an unnecessarily heavier and oilier experience. The pork katsu is definitely more plentiful than the ebi fry, which can be taken under consideration based on appetite.\n\nThe copious curry is flavorful and rich, triumphantly uniting the meat and rice into nearly a stew-like state. The pickled red radish is a welcome crunch that could actually use additional reinforcements so that each bite can be uniformly blessed by it.", "author": "Andrew M."}

However, there was something very different about Muracci's! Maybe it was the extreme hunger factor or maybe it was that the owner was super helpful but I fell in love with this place.\n\nIt's definitely a hole-in-the-wall with seating for 14 people max, but the owner made sure we had comfortable seating and didn't process our orders until we were seated so our food wouldn't get cold. We were a group of four and unfortunately had to separate by 2's but didn't mind it as we all had one thing on our mind: fulfill hunger. \n\nI shared the Katsu Curry with brown rice with my friend as it was 3pm and we wanted to be hungry again for dinner. It was the perfect portion for us girls. The katsu was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and the curry had a certain kind of ZING that I liked. The side of house special pickles also proved to be crucial to this dish and I devoured all of it. Regardless to say, our plate was licked clean and our tummies happy.", "author": "Jaimie L."}

Aloha Eats in Chicago tipped me off to the joys of the food. The wondrous Emi H in Honolulu advised me on how best to fit 11 servings into my big belly. Muracci's sealed the deal. Oh, Muracci's. I understand why your small storefront is forever lined to the gills with people. This isht is delicious!!\n\nKnow before you go: the place is small. You are the last person in SF to have heard about Muracci's, ergo there will be a line. A long one. But, because the Muracci's folks know what they're doing, they've devised an order/pay/receipt system that's nearly flawless. Step in line. Observe. Imitate. Don't f it up. Simple, right?\n\nAlso know: get the chicken katsu curry. Yes. This. If a place has 'curry' in its name and you don't order 'curry'... what am I doing even finishing that sentence? Get the curry. \"But, Johnny T,\" you plead, \"Chicken katsu is my jam.\" Of course it is. It's delicious. \"Whatever do I do?\" Get the curry *and* the katsu. See? See that? But, wait. I'm not done. Get the white rice, not the brown. You aren't eating a kale salad with sprouts for lunch, so don't act brand new when it comes to rice. Throw the pickles over everything and ask for the hot curry. Yes, the hot one. Medium has a nice flavor profile, but no real heat. Hot will add some serious depth to your food but it's not so hot that you'll be in pain.\n\nAlso also know: all this amazing food will be yours for less than $10. It's true. Seating is limited, but you're in SF. Odds are the weather will be decent enough for you to eat outside. Head over to YB, plop down on the ground, yell at some hippies to get a job & cut their hair, and settle in for a huge amount (your food bag will be heavy) of delicious delicious food.\n\nKnow this.", "author": "Johnny T."}

So today, as it was wet and I've been walking a lot (stupid contacts ripped in my eye yeah!  I know!  Weird! So I had to go home and so much BART traveling), I decided it was a perfect time to try out the Katsu Curry at Muracci's since it was just a block away from our training center.\n\nLocated on the corner of Kearny and Bush, this place is tiny!  Don't expect to eat here with a big group.  Also if you do have a big group, order ahead of time and come in to pick it up.  The kitchen seemed a bit cramped but they made it work.  Everything is made to order so nothing is pre-made.  When I heard, \"1 katsu kare, onegaishimasu\"  I knew this would be a winner.  It took maybe 10 minutes before I got my order and I hopped skipped away to eat it.  There were other different curries as well as lunch specials and sandwiches.  They sold Japanese drinks too, so you get the full quick service Japanese food experience in SF.\n\n~ Katsu Curry ~\nYou get a choice of the spiciness - Mild, Medium, Hot.  I opted for hot since I figured it was a Japanese restaurant and not Korean.  I would be very wary of Hot at a Korean Place or Thai for that matter.  Anyway, I digress.  Then a choice of white or brown rice.  SCORE.  I love brown rice.  They separate the container of curry and katsu with rice and pickled veggies.  I've never had just Katsu Curry so I was expecting a little more than just meat in the curry sauce like veggies etc, but I guess that's not authentic.  The pork cutlet is definitely sizeable.  So crispy and juicy.  I opted to dunk my cutlet in the curry sauce and mmmm.  Hot was perfect.  So much kick but I wanted it to be.  It didn't distract from the taste of the pork, just enhanced it.\n\nI would say this place is a definite hole-in-the-wall, but a fancy one with authentic Japanese quick meals.  A bit on the pricey side, but I think it's definitely worth it for the quality.  I will definitely be back to try the katsu with cheese and the rest of the menu!", "author": "Carolen M."}

Now you can get your food in a reasonabile amount of time even if the line goes to the door.\n\nWhile their katsu curry is the best, it's a good idea to check their weekly special, because often they will have something interesting and good to eat.

Walking along this area of downtown is literally like travelling through time, or at least entering a portal to another country.

(Actually, I guess the fat pidgeons are all over SF.)\n\n2. The crowd.\n\nThe crowds of people walking into this store to order curry range from all sorts of ethnicities -  Asian to American, brunettes to blondes. Now choose any anime.

Light from Death Note, Lelouche from Code Geass, Kawachi from Yakitate!! Japan. Unless they are all Japanese but dyed their hair...?) \n\n3.

I'm at this Japanese place.  Just ordered, uh, hang on...katsu curry.\"\n\"Cat what???\"\n\"Kat-SOOO curry, f'ing racist.\"\n\"Curry?  Isn't that Indian?\"\n\"Yeah, I don't know.  I gotta go.\"\n\nMy order came out a short time later.  At first glance, it looked pretty plain.  I was already thinking about how I would explain it to my semi-racist friend back in the Lone Star State.  Chicken fried pork with Japanese-Indian brown gravy?  \n\nActually, that's not an entirely misleading description.  But the light and crispy breading gave way to a deliciously tasty bite of pork.  And the brown gravy, errr, curry, was awesomely flavorful, thick, and spicy.  I felt I needed something else to sop up all the curry after the pork was gone, like you do with pita and hummus.  Alas, I had to let some curry go to waste.  \n\nThe katsu curry was a seemingly simple combination perhaps, but this was very good . . . and at a good price too. Stop by late afternoon or call ahead if you don't want to deal with the lines.  If you can't do that, it's still worth the wait.  Maybe I'll even convince Bubba to try it sometime.  It is meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-19", "description": "Muracci's has become a favorite lunch stop whenever I'm in the downtown area on a late weekday afternoon.  Around 3 PM on most days the lunch crowd is gone, and I can actually sit inside the little restaurant and enjoy Muracci's amazing curry dishes.  On some days some of the selections might be sold out, but that hasn't bothered me since I'm willing to try something new with each visit.\n\nI love the taste and consistency of Muracci's curry sauce.  The portion is excellent as there is plenty of sauce to mix into the rice.  One of my favorite yelpers once wrote about his desire to lick the plate clean at Muracci's.  If I were not in a public restaurant I too would lick my plate clean each time.  The entire staff at Muracci's is nice and friendly where I'm always greeted by a smile and thanked before departing.\n\nMuracci's curry sauce is a brown colored sauce with tiny specks of chili visible to the eye.  It has a subtle sweetness to it.  I don't take very spicy foods too well and the one time I ordered my curry \"hot\" from Muracci's I didn't look too good when I left the restaurant with my eyes watering and my nose running.  I order my curry \"medium\" all the time now.  It's the perfect degree of spicyness for me because while the sauce still creates a sensation on my tongue, it's a more gentle sensation that will warm my entire mouth and stop just before it reaches my nose.  No runny nose.  No teary eyes.\n\nMy usual order consists of brown rice.  I've had the curry with ramen also, and that was outstanding.  I'm eager to try it with the udon noodles hopefully on my next visit.  The rice dishes come with crunchy pickled cabbage and sweet pickles.  I love combining everything into the rice and then smothering everything with the sauce.  Here are some of the selections I've tried so far:\n\nChicken Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=chh-Ec2DVbLJhhGJnhK1vA) - Very good with big tender pieces of skinless, boneless dark meat chicken.\n\nChicken Katsu Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Gu66z3HwgDZbp8Vabe0B3Q) - Excellent with a big piece of chicken breast breaded and deep fried.  The chicken was juicy and the breading was nice and crunchy without being oily.\n\nSalmon Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=CJ4l4K_QSvNQr5j3oQX4kg) - Excellent as the salmon was grilled to perfection moist and flaky.  The salmon skin had very nice crispy edges and they even added an extra piece of salmon into the sauce.\n\nVegetarian Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=5x7bGOIexkzXs8CVIrpFhA) - I ordered this one \"hot\" and still loved the taste the most even though the curry drove my senses crazy.  The fried tofu really absorbed the flavor of the curry sauce.  The vegetables in this selection are firm (but not hard) carrots and firm (but not crunchy) broccoli.  There are yellow and red bell peppers in there too.  The tofu was of a medium firmness.\n\nChicken and Vegetable Curry over Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7qK2Gwu0afQMtYFSJvvCqQ?select=Qew_2CR0JUPtk8OQ7Kqd5w) - You have the option between udon and ramen noodles.  This was outstanding as the curry sauce takes the place of the broth.  Lots of dark meat chicken with firm broccoli and carrots.  Lots of scallion and green onion too.  As close to licking a bowl clean without actually doing so as I'll ever go in public.\n\nI've also had the Beef Curry with nice tender chunks of beef and the Ebi Fry Curry with breaded and deep fried shrimp (no photos).  Both were delicious as well.\n\nIt seems you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  Muracci's is outstanding!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Big mistake.\n\nWe looked at their dinner menu and ordered a couple of the Curry Pan's, Tonkatsu Donburi, Miso Soup and Chicken Katsu Curry for delivery.  They said they don't have any Curry Pan and that they \"NEVER\" have it for dinner because it sells out after lunch.  I thought to myself, \"Then why still have it on your dinner menu?\" So, we ordered 2 orders of the Korroke instead.\n\nNot only did the order take a long time to get delivered, but when it arrived the driver called me to come down to get my food because he was double-parked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-25", "description": "I have been seriously OBSESSED with chicken katsu curry ever since I discovered JapaCurry's version about four weeks ago.  Since then, I crave it...weekly, and maybe even daily.\n\nSince it was a beautiful Monday afternoon, I decided to venture outside of my little half a block radius and head to Muracci's for lunch.  I decided that I was going to do a live assessment and comparison of Muracci's chicken katsu curry with Japacurry's plate.\n\nOn to the food! The pros/cons of my experience:\n\nPROS:\n-This place has a wonderful variety of options for people who are interested in curry, and those who aren't.  Not only were there chicken and pork katsu options, but there was also shrimp.\n-Brown rice is an option without needing to charge you extra for it.\n-Everything is made to order\n-Two types of pickled cabbage is provided with your lunch\n-Curry sauce has a lot of flavor, and there's good breading on the chicken katsu that I had\n\nCONS:\n-So, for starter's, Muracci's little shop is TINY.  On a nice warm day, the tiny shop turns into a sweltering shoe box, cramped with people who are waiting for their food and people picking up their orders via phone order. \n-The ordering system here is totally disorganized.  There are people who called in orders, and people like myself who showed up at the door.  Since there's only one register, it's a huge cluster of people cutting in line to pick up their phone order.  It'd be helpful if they had a separate area of people who were phone orders, but since this place is so small, it's probably not possible.\n-Muracci's portions are deceivingly small.  They spread out a layer of rice on the bottom of a regular sized take out box to make it seem like you're getting a lot for your money.  The truth is, it's really not that much.  Relative to what you get at Japacurry, it's maybe even a little less.\n-The chicken katsu I had was slightly overcooked and dry.  It looked like someone had left it in the pan for too long since the breading on one side was crispier/drier than the other.\n-The curry sauce I had was flavorful, but was sort of thin and more like soupy in consistency.  \n-Lunch was $10.25, compared to Japacurry where with brown rice, your total is $9.00 and you get more food.\n\nSo, based on my experience, Muracci's is overrated.  Perhaps I'm biased because I \"found\" curry through Japacurry and hold them on a pedestal for converting a non-believer like myself into an avid fan.  However, from my experience, I just couldn't get around the letdown feeling I had after starting my meal.  If you need to find me, I'll be standing in line at Japacurry for my curry fix from now on.", "author": "Lisa I."}

How can you sell all your pork in 5 mins?  Okay. I tried to stay calm and ordered chicken ( overcooked) Katsu. Second huge disappointment knocked me down. Please don't deceive Americans! \nHave you ever tried coco Ichihara curry in Japan?  http://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/index.html.  Their curry represents Japanese curry. Honestly. Muracci's curry is not Japanese curry, their curry is more Indian curry side and I  firmly believe that all Japanese agree with me. They misled many people here saying their curry is Japanese curry. No No No ! If you have a Japanese friend, please bring him/her here.  You will know I'm right. Oh maybe you can go to curry house in Cupertino. Their curry is not the best but you can see how different between Muracci's curry and curry of curry house. Curry house IS Japanese curry. We don't use Indian spices on Japanese curry! We don't like strong spice, you know.  I'm sorry to say but if you say Muracci's curry is the best, Japanese think you don't know Japanese food at all. Their curry wouldn't sell well in Japan especially Osaka as their curry is not Japanese one. Honest is the best policy to me!  I want to eat the real Japanese curry! If you want to enjoy Indian curry, plz go to Amber at Santana Row or Mountain View!

I barely stepped into this tiny joint when the nice server took my order and sent me on my way to pay. There's very little room to maneuver in this place and it gets hot up in there! Anyway, we sat on the stools on the street side to wait for our food. I witnessed deep fried chicken coming out of the fryer and then immediately sliced to be placed into to-go boxes. The katsu is very fresh. \n\nAfter waiting 5 minutes or so, my friend and I got our food and took it elsewhere to eat. Just pour all of the curry onto the katsu, would ja? You will not be disappointed. The rice and the meat get all soaked up by the curry that you won't notice that the katsu wasn't extremely crispy to begin with. And medium spicy was perfect.

With the hot curry sauce separate, the katsu with loads of panko crumbs stays crispy.  Katsu was good but would have liked more seasoning on the chicken.  There was a little red/pink pickled daikon (long white radish) as well as pickled white cabbage.  I would have liked more veggies!\n\nI'd like to give it another try.  I might try the Veggie Curry or the Chicken Karaage next time.\n\nIn the mean time, if you're craving Japanese curry, make it at home.  Instant curry doens't have the depth like Muracci's but still tastes darn good!  Buy S&B Golden Curry at Safeway/Berkeley Bowl/Ranch 99/some Asian grocery store.

If you like Japanese curry, you have to come and try Muracci's.  I've had the Katsu (Pork Cutlet) Curry (Hot) and it was delicious.  \n\nYou wondered what makes Muracci's special?  Let me break this down:\n+ The katsu has the soft breading, so it doesn't hurt your gum when you chew on it.\n+ The curry are so delicious that you want to lick every last drop.\n- okay, way too much rice.\n\nIn reality, there was too much food for lunch.  Come hungry or just don't eat all of it.  It's a hard call considered it taste so good, its hard to control yourself. \n\nPrepare to order take out, the store is very small.

I've been here twice once ordering the Katsu Curry the other time going with the chicken katsu curry. It's no mystery as stated in the beginning of this paragraph that I preferred the pork. The efficiency of the establishment is off the charts. A nice Japanese gentlemen greets you and takes down your order while in line. By the time you get to the register and pay the meal is practically bagged and in your hands. A bunch of Japanese words are thrown around in the kitchen = LEGITimacy. \n\nNow on to the most important part of any review: food description\nKatsu Curry (medium hot)- Simplicity is key, nicely fried pork cutlets on a bed of white rice (or brown if you prefer) with pickled cabbage and ginger. I added an boiled egg for 75 cents. Reminds me of a taiwanese fried pork chop dish I hold near and dear to my heart (flavor profile completely different, but ya know). The curry not surprisingly is the star of the show. The delicious flavor is subtle in its excellence. Medium hot was an adequate amount of kick. I was expecting more due to hype, but as I ate my appreciation grew. I wouldn't say best curry ever, but top 3. I'm sure If I went to Japan my mind would be BLOWN. \n\nChicken Katsu Curry- Respectable fried chicken, but imo the pork was better. Curry was consistent in goodness the second time around. \n\nUdon (chicken and veggie curry)- My friend ordered this dish. She had asked if the curry base was thick and the nice man said it wasn't. After finishing all the noodles a decent sized pool of curry was left. It was curry overload for her. As she threw away the rest I cringed because I could have easily cooked a batch of white rice and dumped that curry over. Instant delicious meal. Her slobber was all in it, I restrained myself. \n\nThe place is small and compact. There is some cramped seating along 2 sides of the restaurant, about 8 seats total. Next time I come back and it's only a matter of time I'll snag an assortment of Korokke to try. They looked pretty good bathing in the heat ray machine next to the cashier.", "author": "Jack C."}

I didn't know how spicy it would be, so I went with medium, but afterwards I realized I probably would have liked it spicier.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-10", "description": "My favorite lunch spots in the Financial District! Without hesitation, if someone asks me for a recommendation for lunch downtown, I'll tell them, try Muracci's! Their KATSU CURRY (not chicken) is one of the best katsu's I've ever had. Always fresh out of the fryer and consistently tender and moist, this is my go to order. The katsu lays on a bed of rice in a biodegradable container, with a small side of pickled cabbage and ginger, and a whole separate container for the curry (choose mild/medium/hot), always an appetizing sight! Servings are large and will fill you right up for lunch, watch out for that afternoon food coma at your desk! \n\nThe few times I've tried other items here, I've always come away thinking I should have just ordered the katsu curry. The one biggest disappointment has been the beef curry. The beef was overdone and dry, lacking that same tender and moist character of the katsu. The ebi fry is good, but just not as filling, or for that matter, fulfilling of a portion as the katsu. I've ventured to try a few of their weekly specials, which too, have been good, but the katsu curry keeps me coming back! You can also substitute brown rice for white rice (no additional charge!) if you're into that.\n\nThe curry is fantastic. Apparently cooked overnight, it has robust flavors and is a great accompaniment to the meats (and non-meats) they have on offer. You can choose the spicyness from mild/medium/hot (and with that, you'll see the amount of chili in your curry rise). They don't skimp on the amount of curry you get with your entree, plenty to go around on your rice and katsu. \n\nA good appetizer while you wait for your mean is one of their Curry Pan's. Sitting on the counter next to the register, under the heat lamp, these little guys are fried pockets of goodness. Bread, fried with various curries inside (vege hot/regular, beef hot/regular, chicken hot/regular). Selection varies based on day/time of day. When they're fresh, they're amazing. but when they've been sitting for a while, they can be a little dry.\n\nThey have very limited seating inside, one table for 2, 4-5 seats at the front counter and another 4 seats at the side counter. This place is SMALL. If you're coming around peak lunch time, 11:45-1PM, typically plan to take out (BofA building's plaza is a short block away, as is St. Mary's Plaza if you're not toting back to your office). However, if you do eat in, you'll be treated to service on a large plate and silverware, with the rice/meat/curry spread out across it. \n\nIf you're in a hurry and know what you want, call ahead and place your order for pickup. It typically takes them 10-20 minutes, depending on how busy it is. The wait in line can be daunting but it's well worth it. All of the people working here are very friendly, although can seem a bit less so when it's busy and the line is out the door. Somehow they manage to fit 5 people behind that counter...\n\nCLIFFS: Delightful Katsu Curry, choose your curry's spicyness and kind of rice, small place (take out!), Peak lunch time = line", "author": "Justin S."}

Seriously, once you've been here, there will be days where you'll get a hankering for Japanese curry that only Muracci's can satiate. Folks, today's that day. It's about a mile walk from my office, but it's totally worth it. Got there a little past 12nn -- about 15 people in line ahead of me. Albeit the long line, my friend and I were able to get a table right away. Waited about 10-15 minutes to get my order, and when I finally did, what do I do? I KNOCK THE WHOLE THING OVER, FACE DOWN. Perfect fried pork cutlets and white rice struck down in the prime of life. I was speechless. When I finally got myself together from this horrific incident, I told the kitchen what happened and they gladly replaced my order for free in just a matter of seconds. So amazing. Got the 'hot' option instead of my usual 'mild' and it delivered. There's definitely an extra kick. Whoever said their curry sauce is bland must be really old and have only 50/10000 working taste buds (I'm looking at you, Jen W.) \n\nThe only \"complain\" I have is the tiny space -- I always think that with all the curry money they're making, I'm sure they're able to expand. But then again, there's something about it being a hole-in-the-wall. So I take back what I said and have no complaints! Looking forward to coming back here soon.", "author": "Trixy S."}

You can choose how you like your curry.  I love how their mild is mild, medium is medium.  For a lot of other places I've been to (not only curry ones), their medium is like.. mild.

Knowing that getting to the FiDi from China Basin during lunch hour can eat up a good amount of time, my coworker and I planned ahead and left early enough to beat most of the lunch traffic.  Good thing we did too:  get to Muracci's in 10 minutes or less?  Check.  Get parking right in front?  Check.  No line, no lunch crowd?  Barely checked.  I'd say 2 minutes after we got there, the line started to form and it formed pretty fast.  (Btw, there isn't really any place to eat inside and it was always our intention to go back to work and eat, so parking right out front in the metered truck loading area was ok.  Err...not legal, but okay for a few minutes I guess.)\n\nAnyways, on to the food.  I went with the chicken katsu curry with vegetables as an extra topping.  Overall, it was just okay.  The chicken and the flavoring were there, but nothing really stood out.  I may have had my expectations high after reading some other reviews, but really, the curry sauce was too thin for me.  I like it thick, and I've read some people say that it is thick at Muracci's.  Maybe I caught them on an off day?  Either way, I felt let down since I had been waiting to try this place for a few months.  Like having a long day at work and getting a watered-down rum and coke at happy hour.  Although, I must say that I did inhale the entire plate and I was sufficiently sleepy for the rest of the afternoon.  So it wasn't bad....it just didn't meet my expectations.

You really have to beat the rush during lunch time - it's quite popular! Operated and cooked by real Japanese people (except the guy in charge of the frying) is comforting to know.\n\nI didn't start liking Japanese-style curry until 2 years ago and even then I never really craved it; growing up, I always preferred Indian, Afghan, Chinese or Thai-styles. But now I'm turning into a fan of Japanese curry, or at least for Muracci's Japanese curry I am!\n\nFor curries, you get to choose the level of spicy-ness and what kind of rice (brown or white) you want. On my first viist I got the grilled salmon with hot curry sauce and brown rice. The curry wasn't really spicy, but it was very flavourful and not too thick or paste-like. The salmon was grilled just well, so it was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside - very nice. I thought the portions and prizes were pretty reasonable compared to other FiDi options. \n\nThey have other items such as udon/ramen, donburi's, katsu plates, side dishes and a la carte items. Ordering is really simple, you can even fax or phone in to avoid the wait! There's an express line for mild curry with beef or chicken orders, I believe.\n\nMy second visit I their almost-monthly special for December, which was the \"spicy noodles\". It consisted of ramen/egg noodles with ground beef, green onions, onions, hot chili pepper and seasoning. They claimed that they only made 15 orders of these a day.\n\nIt was not bad, though not really spicy (though I already expected that.) The noodles were the best part - very soft and al dente and were packed with egg flavour. The sauce was very appetizing and could go well with many other carb-enriched items. \n\nI also had their curry with beef; the sauce was good like before and the beef was very tender, though too little in quantity. \n\nMuracci's is definitely worth the try because it's not like your average Japanese curry.

I probably would've been okay with the mild level, but the heat was definitely tolerable, and I don't consider myself a spice person. I was skeptical at ordering noodle soup in a to-go form, but they nicely package the soup and noodles separately so that you simply pour the curry over the noodles when you're ready to eat, and the flavor immediately infuses the carbs. At first, I thought that the small-looking clump of noodles wouldn't be enough, but my eyes prove time and time again to be bigger than my stomach and I became pleasantly full after consuming everything. They serve a strong, dark brown curry soup that I tasted in my mouth for the rest of the day, but not in an entirely bad way. There was a fair amount of chicken, but I could've used more veggies.   \n\nI have to say that I am really impressed at the way they have streamlined service to best serve a maximum amount of customers out of their tiny space. When I went, there was an older gentleman walking in front to take orders while taking phone orders on a headset--ultimate multitasking skills--and he'd shout the menu items to the kitchen area, who would assemble the entrees lightning fast so that one's food is ready shortly after one pays at the cashier, further down the line. The service is actually pretty great for the very casual setting: when the man asked \"to-go\" or \"for-here\" our facial expressions showed that we wanted to eat in but doubted that there would be room and he quickly assured us that we could eat \"to-go\" food in house if there was space, and we did indeed manage to get two chairs. Second, he found the time amidst the restaurant hullabaloo to bring me water while I was eating, which was unexpected but showed that the workers are extremely attentive.\n\nDifficult to snag a seat during the lunch rush, but if you have a dining partner you can tag team it and enjoy a cute Japanese meal.

Pork Katsu Curry with Brown Rice - typically what I order. I usually get medium spicy which adds just enough heat without overpowering the curry flavor. The Pork is breaded perfectly and it's not super oily. I usually order it as is  it plain but once added spinach...it's nice to have the vegetables but the extra cost doesn't make it worth it.\n\n2. Tofu and Veggie Curry with Brown Rice - I tried this once. It was good, as always came with their flavorful curry. The tofu was lightly fried and the vegetables consisted of 3 vegetables: broccoli, carrots and another one that has slipped my mind. The one thing that I didn't like was that there is less curry given to you in the to-go container because the tofu and veggies are in curry instead of being on top of the rice.\n\n3. Spicy beef noodle - very tasty but beware of the greasy and upset stomach you may get after. I got the \"normal\" spicy which was pretty spicy for me. Each bite I took was delicious but the aftermath didn't feel so nice. If you've ever had boiling crab...that is what it felt like after. Too much grease and spice. \n\nOverall, a great Japanese curry place. It doesn't get 5 stars because I feel that it is a bit overpriced for what it has to offer. Also, it's a small place that doesn't provide much room to sit down and enjoy your curry. Japanese curry isn't super smelly...but you can def smell it in the office.", "author": "Karis L."}

They serve it at an actual edible temperature as opposed to burning hot, and just the right amount if you're feeling hungry. And get the curry pan, which is a Japanese fry bread filled to the brim with delicious curry. At $2.95 they're a great grab and go snack that has veggies, carbs and protein. Just be sure to get them early while they're fresh and before I've bought all of them ; )\nThis place has got the goods. Be prepared to stand in line if you're coming in at lunch time-it'll be worth the wait (surprisingly, you'll be waiting longer in line than you will be for your food when you order; the place runs like a well-oiled machine).

A very solid Fidi lunch choice- not too expensive, pretty quick, and very tasty. \n\nDuring lunch hours, it's usually packed, so call ahead and you can skip the line. Everybody raves about the katsu curry and if you are a first timer, you should go for it. But, if like me, you are on a non-fried food diet, the chicken curry is super tender and flavorful as well. They offer brown rice at no extra charge, which is also very clutch. Usually a curry dish will run you about 8-9$. \n\nI wouldn't advise eating here as it's really small, though it really reminds of Japan!

It's got this rich, slightly sweet, deep flavor that you can't get from a box.  It's dark brown with flecks of carrots and chili flakes. \n\nI placed my order at the counter (salmon curry, spicy, with brown rice, $8.95) and then waited while they cooked my order (the sign says they don't cook it till you order it).  The counter has a taped menu and they crossed out sold out items - looks like katsu curry items are the most popular.  The prices are quite reasonable, lunch sets that come with rice, salad and miso soup start at $7.50 and donburi dishes are $6.95. They sell Lupicia tea, salads, bottled drinks and 6 types of roll cake ($1.75 each). \n\nTo speed things along, they also offer the Express Curry special - mild beef or chicken curry with rice.  \n\nThe curry comes in a separate container.  I never expect hot/spicy to be spicy when it comes to Japanese food but the curry actually had a good spicy kick to it.  The grilled salmon was delicious even without curry - a good quality piece of salmon, grilled properly with pretty grill marks.  Even the salmon skin was tasty.  The housemade pickles (fukujinzuke) and pickled cabbage were nice crunchy complements to the salmon and brown rice.  \n\nThe vanilla roll cake was soft and dense with a buttery, creamy filling.  It was good but I like my cake lighter and spongier and my filling less buttery.\n\nMr. Muracci was there that day overseeing the kitchen.  It's a tiny place with seats for 10 people - reminds me of GoGo Curry in NYC only not as crazy and Japanese.  At Go Go Curry, I heard people speaking Japanese and they had Japanese programming on TV.  At Muracci, I heard people speaking Chinese and English and they were listening to the radio - in English.  Though Go Go feels more Japanese, Muracci's has better curry.  Too bad you can't add natto to the curry (Go Go has that option).", "author": "Lolia S."}

Encouraged by the crowdedness of the place at around 1:30pm, I decided to try my luck. \nI ordered the tofu and vegetable curry to-go (medium, white rice), and was more than happy with what I got. The vegetables were indescribably  yummily-cooked and I loved the little container of pickled cabbage and carrots(?) that came with it. Portions are also pretty generous, and will definitely keep you full for the rest of the afternoon. This was my first time trying Japanese curry, and I will definitely be going back for more.\nWait was around twenty minutes...not too bad considering all I had to look forward to was going back to work.

The folks working the counter are always smiling and friendly and never once have I received the wrong order (which is wont to happen in the FiDi during the lunch rush).\n\nI think they make the curry in the morning to use for the full days service, if you go later in the day the sauce is a little spicier than if you go early in the lunch service.  Even the mild has a nice little zing to it by late in the day.

You have to be pretty hungry to finish it all in one sitting. Pair with their breaded (curried) pan. So so good. The entire order came out to about $13. A little on the pricier side for lunch, but well worth it since you can save up half of it for dinner as well. And of course worth it, because it tastes so great. \n\nThey also have a pretty nice collection of asian drinks.

I've had the chicken, chicken katsu, and regular katsu curries, and I've loved them all.  I've never had any of their non-curry dishes, and I don't think I ever will, because the place is JUST far enough from work that I don't want to walk there and the wait is JUST long enough that it makes going there hard.  I usually also get extra curry, so I can just eat it with rice!  I really like the different croquettes they have all the time.  They sit there on the counter right next to the cash register, saying \"get me... eat me\" and I can never say no, especially since the curry isn't too expensive.\n\nI've tried a couple other Japanese curry places in the city, but none have been as good as Muracci's so far.

It can seat about 20~25 people at the most, so if you're going during the prime lunch or dinner times, you might have to brave a wait outside.  Luckily, it was a late lunch for us so the restaurant was pretty empty - yay.\n\nAll of us got some combinations of the katsu curry (pork cutlet with curry sauce over rice) and the beef curry.  The servers bring out 3 different types of pickles to go with your curry.  \n\nThe curry - awesome.  The katsu was cooked perfectly, crunchy crust and the meat was very juicy and still maintained some texture.  The curry was a little soupier than I'd personally liked it but the flavor was deep and nicely seasoned.  by the way, you can get your curry in different heat-levels (mild, medium and hot).  You can also ask for brown rice instead of white rice.\n\nThe next time I am going there - I might have to try other things on their menu.  I think that they are known for their curry dishes, but they offer other japanese goodies - oyakodons, teriyaki platters, omurice, etc.  \n\nWill definitely return for a kick-ass curry and other concoctions at such reasonable prices ($8~$10 on average before tax and tip) and good service.", "author": "Mike P."}

The whole building is painted a weird beige colour and the three shops barely stand out from one another other than the plain, black lettering above their front doors. \n\nMuracci's itself is a small place, similar to the ramen/udon shops found in Japan. The people who own/work at Muracci's are Japanese: they even greeted me with \"Irrashaimase\" (welcome). There are daily/weekly specials, and apparently they're popular, since I attempted to order the special spicy noodle and the cashier told me they were sold out. Aw man!\n\nThe menu has plenty of yummy Japanese offerings, including several different kinds of curry (salmon, ebi fry, etc.), donburi, and some small sushi orders. Prices range under $10, which is average/not bad for lunchtime prices, and a sweet deal for dinner (unfortunately, they do close at 6, so you'd have to go eat an early dinner around 4:30 like I did). \n\nI ordered the salmon curry, extra hot; sat at one of the front counter seats and immediately felt like I was in Japan. It's tight yet cozy; the shop was pretty empty at 4pm, considering most people hadn't left work yet. It took them a little bit to bring my order to me, but no worries, since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere else.\n\nWhen my curry did arrive, I was surprised to see how huge the plate/portion was! Really good deal for the price I paid! The plate was as large as the rectangular serving tray, and...mm, plenty of curry sauce with a generous portion of salmon on top. I also liked that they gave me the option of choosing brown or white rice--knowing how I am these days, I tend to lean towards brown rice since it's healthier.\n\nThe entree itself was filling; curry wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, but that's okay, I figured the \"spicy\" was mild in comparison to, say, Thai food. I completed the meal with dorayaki...felt like the dorayaki was a little overpriced, but hell, I guess they gotta make money somehow.\n\nI can see how people would say the place isn't good in terms of the lunch rush--Muracci's does cook everything to-order, so the food is always fresh, but that means it takes a little more time to prepare than most people would prefer. Catering to the Financial District area is a smart move, but it's also kind of a weird spot for the restaurant to be in.\n\nWill be back again to try the other entrees. My friend bought the katsu donburi from Muracci's and it also looked very appetizing.\n\nIn short: Muracci's serves up delicious Japanese \"comfort foods\" in American portions. =)", "author": "Helene K."}

The pork katsu was crispy and delicious...fried to perfection!  The accompanying curry was to my surprise actually, spicy!  You don't really get a lot of spice in Japanese food so I was impressed at the depth of flavor and spice in this curry...made my nose run a little and but my stomach was very happy!

Too bad I work in the Embarcadero Centers and can't take too much off for lunch.\n\nI would absolutely recommend their Katsu curry, which is curry over rice with tonkatsu (breaded and fried pork). It's delicious and the most authentic katsu curry I've tasted in SF so far. Bit on the pricy side (9.70 + tax), but nothing crazy given it's SF. It gets packed during lunch, so they will take orders from people in the line which makes the process a lot faster.

Honestly, I now have a 3 way tie for my favorite Japanese curry stateside. The price point is actually pretty good considering the location and probably split a serving in half and eat the rest later (but I didn't because it was really good).\n\nThe curry sauce had a nice consistency to it and it paired well with the katsu cutlet, which was fried perfectly (juicy and meaty). Surprisingly, the cutlet was not fatty, and I was afraid that would take away from the flavor of the pork, but the curry sauce had a good amount of flavor, yet was not overpowering at all. They don't give too much rice nor pickled veggies, which sucks, but the piece of pork they give you is huge, so maybe that dwarfs the rice and veggies...\n\nI wussed out and got mild because the spicy ramen at Ramen Dojo torched me, so next time I will at least try medium heat and throw some cheese on it, the next time I'm in the FIDI prior to tossing a few back at Rickhouse.", "author": "Marc T."}

Anyway I think the more useful part of the review is the bad.\n\nPlace takes forever to make your food.  Call ahead or order the express curry if you want ur food fast.

I ordered the Katsu Chicken Meal (#17) which came with miso and salad. Part of the fun of being was watching the staff working like crazy to get everyone's order right. They weren't always successful on that count or at least in one case that I witnessed they forgot to give a customer her order until she asked about it. This was after she saw a people who had come in after her get served before her. They also goofed and gave her the wrong kind of rice, brown instead of white.\n\nThe meal I got was very tasty. I poured both sauces over the chicken and did my best to polish off the meal. In the end I left some of the prodigious amount of brown rice they gave me but finished everything else off.\n\nOn the down side this isn't the sort of place you can be in and out of in a hurry, unless you call in advance.

They seem to have some incredible ability to know what places are acceptable...even if they've never been there. As it is, one of my friends from overseas who has never even been to SF recommended Muracci's to me after we discussed curry, udon, their combination; and my friend did a quick bit of Google-work to find me a place to enjoy it.\n\nI've had plenty of udon before, but never Japanese curry. I'm normally accustomed to Indian style curries, but for someone who doesn't care much for rich, heavy foods, they aren't something I can or want to eat regularly, so the thought of making a whole soup out of my favorite noodles and curry made me cautious, but optimistic; especially considering the mystical clairvoyance of my foreign friends who had yet to steer me wrong. Learning that the curries I've always known are quite different from the Japanese variety also made the prospect more palatable.\n\nIt turns out I've been missing out in a big way... I love it! It's hard to know if it's the dish or the restaurant preparing it, but that's sort of irrelevant. Muracci's hooked me. The couple running the place are adorably sweet and it's interesting to watch them interact as you order, wait and then eat.\n\nThe food itself, which I've had twice now, is quite good. The curries they make from scratch and involves a long, home-cooked process, which is probably why they only have X number of servings per day for some of their menu items. They make/cook each dish as it's ordered, so you get the freshest possible servings. I'm a huge fan of spicy foods, and was delighted that they allowed me to specify exactly how dangerous I wanted to live; they totally delivered on my request too... not enough to make my forehead sweat, but enough to force the pouring of a second glass of water down my food hole.\n\nBottom line: Obviously, I've gone back twice in about one week; the place is excellent. Tiny--maybe a dozen bar stools total--but worth eating in or taking things out. It's also easy to miss if you're not careful...it's right next door to the Cinta Aveda institute! Now, if they could open a location more convenient to my East Bay apartment, I could award an elusive six stars.\n\nPS...don't insult the place by stopping in for a single korokke (croquette); I saw a few of these customers in just two visits.

I previously wrote \"nice portion\" but that was referring to the cutlet, not the curry sauce. Rule of Thumb: J-curry is satisfactory when they give you the curry sauce a little more than you want to finish the rice with. Not a whole lot more, but should be more than \"just enough\". You know what the fuck I'm talking about? \n\nThe Muracci family is originally from Osaka, Japan where locals are known for being severely tight-ass. They know how to make things  and they know how to make money out of it, but unless they're converted Christians, they will try to do anything to keep their operation and products cost-effective. They will not give you any mercy by allowing you to have a few extra bites. I could rate them 4.2 in the category of \"Osaka cheapass Curry\". \n\n\n\nEdit: I just read that somebody wrote this: \"I remember not having enough curry the first time around so I forked out the $1.75 for extra curry and now I have extra curry sittin  g on my desk.\" \n\nThis is a pretty good option as I'm sure many non-Osakan Japanese people will feel the same.  1.75 sounds just right.", "author": "yota L."}

Ordered the medium spicy katsu curry and waited at one of their 9 seats for about 10 minutes.\n\nWhen I finally got my paws on the curry - YUM! The medium wasn't too spicy. The curry, which came in a separate container was thick and flavorful, not at all watered down, like some places. They gave a good amount of curry so I initially drenched my katsu and rice in curry, then dipped my katsu in leftover curry from the container. I should be ashamed because I even started to sip the curry sauce directly from the container with my plastic spoon in the end. And yes! I ALSO combined my friend's leftover curry with my own and took it home. ::cries::\n\nMy only gripe is that my pork katsu was a bit chewy. The chicken katsu was juicier so I'll be ordering that next time. Loved the pickled cabbage and radish.\n\nSome tips:\n- When you order curry, choose the protein, your level of spiciness (mild, medium, hot), and type of rice (white or brown) \n- There is an express line for beef / chicken curry, mild spiciness only. Order and leave. No wait.\n- Order anything else and the wait is about 10 minutes\n- Only about 9 seats available in the place so you can't always bet on a seat in this tiny joint", "author": "Tina T."}

I've been here twice now--first time, having the Katsu Curry, the following, having the beef curry.\n\nI don't like bland food so I ordered a medium spicy curry. It was so delicious and flavorful. Just the right amount of hot intensity where I know they added spice but not too much where I can't taste my food anymore. \n\nI have to say that the Katsu curry is much better than the beef. The pork was much juicier and was a better complement for the curry. The beef was okay but not tender enough. Plus, they didn't give too much meat.\n\nThe brown rice option is a big plus for me.

There may be some tables in here somewhere but i have yet to see them. There is a long counter opposite of the kitchen and ordering area but I dont recommend sitting here to eat unless its empty.\n\nOnto the food...ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and grilled chicken curry for a friend, both with the medium heat curry and drove home to enjoy the goods. \n\nEven after a 45 minute drive home was happy to say the katsu chicken was still crispy and hot. The grilled chicken plate seemed to be lacking in portion size however in comparison to the Katsu cutlet so not sure if that is the usual or what. Also I am a BIG stickler on rice consistency and prefer to have rice on the dry side so I have to say it was a bit more mushy for my taste. I tend not to like my rice when it clumps together in big balls and not separate. Again not sure if this is the norm but both plates were the same. \n\nPoured the curry sauce over the plate and that is when I realize these guys are on top  for a reason and that is simply this: their currey sauce here is simply amazing. In my experience there are two kinds of curry sauces I enjoy: the thinner milk/yogurt and/or coconut based sauces from indian and Thai cuisines and the thicker non dairy based ones that I see with chinese/japanese curries and as you can imagine the curry here is the latter variety.\n\nThis curry sauce is magic. I am pretty sure if I poured it over anything it would immediately turn it into the best curry-whatever it is I just poured over it dish of all time. It just has the perfect balance of flavors and a deep rich curry flavor that any curry dish or sauce should strive for. \n\n So in spite of the mushy rice and just so-so chicken katsu the dish immediately becomes top tier once you add the curry. I would just go ahead and order another another to-go bowl of curry as that one helping they give you will not satiate your craving for the curry and you will inevitably end up with leftover rice or chicken with no sauce left.\n\nAlso the main reason for the 5 stars? You would think it would be the curry sauce and while it is special I have to say the thing that keeps me going back to SF in the middle of the ridiculous lunch rush even though I work nowhere near SF is the freakin CURRY PAN. These little deep fried, panko bread rolled, dough hot pockets filled with tasty curry love are simply....i have no words. The outer crust is fried to perfection and does not taste oily at all and has just the perfect salty and chewy exterior before you bite down and hit the curry gold inside. Fillings come in chicken, hot chicken, beef, hot beef, beef and veggie and just veggie. The filling is the perfect level of moistness not runny and not to dry or crumbly and they have the perfect ratio of filling to bread. Dip in curry sauce and say goodnight to any number of top 5 foods you have on your list.\n\nSo in summary: Go to Muraccis. Buy Curry Pan. Buy Curry sauce. Dip. NOM.", "author": "Donnie W."}

Little did I know that it was a hole in the wall curry joint with barely any room to stand. Apparently, its a popular place since there was a huge line out the door for it, and yet, I have never heard of the place. \n\nYou could smell the curry oozing from this place. I ordered the Tofu and Veggie + Beef curry w/ brown rice and my bf ordered the Chicken Katsu. I was pretty darn shocked that they served brown rice. My jaw almost hit the ground. I was excited cuz that meant that I didn't have to worry too much about how much rice I'd consume with the curry. \n\nWe also tried the croquettes which weren't bad. It was definitely tasty. When the order came, I was glad that they used eco-friendly packaging for pretty much everything. \n\nI'd have to say that the katsu was really good. There was a lot of meat, it wasn't dry and just so tasty! The beef that I had with my tofu and veggie curry was NOT good. It was so tough I had to chew it for about 5 mins before I could swallow it. (well I don't really know how long cuz after about 15 chews I gave up and just swallowed it like a pill -_- ) I didn't touch the meat after that. \n\nOverall, the curry wasn't bad. However, the curry tasted different from other places I've been to. I would say that I'd come back, however, I would go to other places before I'd go back there - like the Japanese restaurant in Japantown next to Sophie's crepes. \n\nHaving curry at Curry House in Hawai'i spoiled me a little bit.

Even though I miss seeing the Sun, I am comforted by the fact that Hetch Hetchy and the Sierra Snowpack have fared well with the recent weather. \n\nMuracci's is small so don't take 5 office mates and hope to get a seated lunch. \n\nThe Katsu, if not had before, is definitely worth trying. As countless people have already mentioned - its #16 on the The Big Eat SF List. I ordered mine medium spicy with white rice (brown rice is also available). In hindsight, I would order it hot and with extra curry for a $1.75. This was enjoyed with a cup of Green Tea. Total damage $10.35. Great value. \n\nAlso helped that the very competent women behind the counter were both friendly and very easy on the eyes. \n\nI do have to take 2 stars off. Primarily, this is because of excessive use of plastic and poor recycling. I ordered my Katsu Curry to eat there but was still served it in a box (not sure of material of box - but it could have been Styrofoam) with a plastic bowl for the curry, a plastic fork and spoon. While actual cutlery and plates might be too much to ask for, compostable forks and spoons and actual composting would go a long way. The curry in a plastic bowl is also unnecessary. There was a bin to recycle glass and metal (cans) - but not plastic and the sign on top of it seems mostly ignored by patrons. Disappointing on this front - this is San Franciso after all.

The first time I ordered katsu curry but it's sold out so I went with chicken katsu curry. The curry was delish. A kicking spicy flavor would be great. I like my curry: hot... Nom2.... Second time, I didn't know why I ordered katsudon and thought it's the same thing as katsu curry. Only after the dish was almost ready that I realized I ordered the wrong thing. The katsudon was okay but quite salty, especially if you're expecting real Japanese food that's usually not salty.\n\nStick with their curry dishes and you won't be disappointed", "author": "Cliff T."}

It's made to order, quite large, crispy and tender, and when you get it to go they'll slice it up and pack it with plenty of rice and a small serving of pickled sides in a compostable container.  The curry sauce comes in its own container, steaming hot and ready for you to spoon as little or as much of it over your meal as desired.  There's a wonderful aroma and intense flavor to the curry that stands out from other curry styles.  That's a huge plus.\n\nI like how you can choose between white or brown rice too.  I'm a brown rice eater so that's what I went for.  Wasn't disappointed with the perfectly steamed nicely textured grains.\n\nThey give big portions here - another huge plus.  The plastic container for the curry sauce is sturdy and reusable, and I used it to pack my leftovers for later on.\n\nOn a previous visit I had the veggie curry with fried tofu.  The tofu was big and chunky and so were the vegetables.\n\nBe prepared for a line and a wait because like I said they make everything to order and serve it up in turn.

I am paranoid of these little hole-in-the walls in the city for cleanliness reasons.  So I rely on Yelpers to clue me in.  I was happy to see the city rating gave them 100 and they had a fairly current posting from March 2012.  Although, like most shops, seemed a bit dirty.  A turnoff no matter what the city score (and it also doesn't instill confidence in the city's ratings.)  I just don't feel like there's anything to rave about.  Certainly not for the price.  I did get the beef curry HOT w/ brown rice $8.45 and added vegetables for $1.00.  I also wanted to try the California roll.  Not a bad price $3.50 for 6 pieces and the edamame $2.50.  Probably the best value was any 6-piece sushi.  But it was a lark and my paranoia probably won't let me order from a shop like this again.  It was fine, but fish is NOTHING to gamble with.  The edamame (I can eat a whole bag of steamed pods from Trader Joe's in one sitting most days) these tasted like they were steamed in what I can only describe as slightly fishy water. \n\nService was pleasant enough.  I went at 11:00 a.m., so, no line.  Several people arrived 20 seconds after me though.  All in all, while probably many like their food, \nSadly, I will not patronize them again.  I need to LOVE your food to shell out a minimum of $8-$10 for lunch.  Tasted like lunch truck food to me.  I actually spent a total of $16.76 to try everything I was curious about.

Muracci's is famous for its curry dishes, specifically the katsu curry that was on the 77 list 2 years in a row.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThere's really only room for 4 people to sit in this restaurant.

Both are filling and rich, so pace yourself!\n\nGrilled Salmon Curry w/brown rice - My gut would've ordered the katsu curry, but I had to watch out for my poor body that's been taking a toll on this food blog. So, I contently purchased the salmon curry for $9.25. Crazy expensive for Japanese curry. I have to admit the size of the fish looked pretty pathetic sitting on top of the rice. It was so small! I poured the container of curry over my meal and dug in. The curry was spicy, velvety and rich. I don't believe I had any chunks of carrots or beef in my curry, which is usually added at other Japanese curry spots. The curry was definitely delicious, but I think the curry at Hotei on Irving is very much comparable at a total cost of only $6.95.\n\nOverall, I think Muracci's serves up great curry.

Since this placed is famed for their curry, I added it in and ate it while I was waiting for my order. And it was sooo good, still fresh and warm! The outside is light and crispy. Even though its fried, it doesn't have that greasy, heavy feeling. Inside is sorta like mashed potatoes in curry sauce with I think some peas and carrots.

I have been dying to try this place for months though, so I stood my ground in their slow-ass line just so I could have a taste of their katsu curry.  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes to actually get to the front of the line to order and then another 15 or so to get our food, but we weren't in any hurry, and even nabbed two stools. Probably a bad spot to come to if you're on your lunch break and need something fast, but obviously everyone goes anyway because the food here is just that damn good.\n\nMy mild katsu curry was awesome. The fried pork cutlet was delicious, though a few cuts in the middle had some fat; I simply passed those pieces onto my boyfriend. ;) The curry sauce was flavourful, but I think I should have gotten it medium instead of mild, since I would have preferred a little kick. I tried my boyfriend's hot beef curry and though it made my mouth burn a bit, I think if you're a fan of spicy things, Muracci's is pretty light-weight in that department. \n\nI also got a tora cake roll for dessert. It was moist and sweet, but not too sweet.

The portions are huge, but it was hard not to keep greedily stuffing pieces of fried katsu in my mouth.  We ordered our food to-go, but seats opened up, so we grabbed them and sat down to enjoy our food.  I think there is a total of 6-7 seats at Muracci's-- they have definitely captured the squished-in feel of Japan within their ten square feet of space.  \n\nThankfully I ate at Muracci's before I started my current diet, because katsu curry is definitely NOT a health food.  Watching them drop HUGE slabs of nicely breaded katsu into large vats of hot oil isn't a recipe for healthiness.  But sometimes you just gotta let go and say SCREW IT, I WANT MY KATSU CURRY!  \n\nAnd then you go to Muracci's, because there is nowhere else better in the city to go.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

Having moved here from Hawai'i I am a bit skeptical about Japanese food since I've had the best of the best back home.  Everytime I walk into this place I am greeted with a warmness that has always transported me back home to the land of \"aloha\" even for a minute.  It's this warmness that is missing from a lot of food haunts in the city.  I'm actually a person here not just revenue to pay the bills!  Fancy that!  \n\nTrue, the place is small but most okazuya types are.  A few tables and counter space with stools make up for the tiny seating area.  Their menu is diverse and even though they specialize in Japanese curry they still have your regular Japanese items such as Karaage, Oyakodon, Teriyaki, etc.  I am always that much more happier with an eatery for their addition of brown rice.  Muraccis has such an option.  But, beware, SF is known for healthy eaters and the brown rice can be sold out at times.  Speaking of which, their popular items such as the infamous Katsu Curry become sold out as well.  This is a popular place especially during lunch time with the Downtown crowd.  Don't believe me?  Drive by Kearny during lunch time and I guarantee you will see a line out the door.  I usually call ahead and it always works in my favor.  \n\nThey are such sweet people to keep the curry and dry goods separate when doing take out.  They have a weekly special which is worth trying.  However, if I feel as if I can't seem to decide what to order I always go to my default - vegetable/tofu curry.  No I am NOT granola but I do love me some tofu from time to time and hello, I need my vegetables.

I knew immediately that it is owned and operated by Japanese Americans as soon as I walked in, and that's more than I can say about many places in the Bay Area that serve similar food.\n\nHowever, Muracci's is OK at best.  There's nothing special here unless you've never had good curry before.  Anybody can make the same food (possibly better) with a little work.  Here's how:\n\nGo to the supermarket and buy curry stock.  It'll be in the Asian section.  Buy some vegetables and meat (carrots, potatoes, onions, pork/chicken/beef).  Cook the meat and vegetables while you get a big ol' vat of water boiling.  Meanwhile, steam some California grown \"Japanese\" rice.  Once the water is boiling, add the curry and melt it and add your meats.  Let it simmer for a while--it tastes better that way.  If you have the patience to let it cool down and then heat it up again, do it--it tastes even better that way.  Pour the stuff on top of the rice. Viola~ Itadakimasu.

Long lines usually mean good food, so I changed my lunch plans to stop and pick up some grub here.\n\nBest curry katsu I've ever had! They use a large pork patty, all white meat, that is cut just the right thickness to remain tender after frying. The batter is light, tasty, and is freshly fried when you order it. The curry itself, is incredibly delicious! The spicy isn't overpowering and adds a great flavor. It's packed separately when you order it so that you don't get a soggy piece of pork when you eat it as take out. \n\nThe korukke are also freshly fried. The filling is mashed up potato and meat that is curried, and almost as equally delicious as the katsu.\n\nThe beef curry soup with ramen noodles should probably be skipped. The flavor is good, but I think they need to give a lot more soup for the amount of noodles they use, and the beef is a little on the tough side.\n\nThe line was out the door for lunch, and a lot of people seem to phone in their orders for pick up to expedite the wait. The place is tiny and only wide enough  for 2 people to stand and way too cramped if you're trying to sit down at their bar to eat. \n\nI definitely recommend taking this food to go.

This is the only way you can get out of here in under 10 minutes with a group of 4-5. The first time we came it took about 45 minutes to wait for all our food. This isn't cool for a lunch time place when you need to get back to work.\n\nThe food quality here is high. I would suggest to the staff that they expand the selection for the express lunch to have more than just *mild* curries. I would also like more vegetables with my chicken, it's just kind of boring now when I only get a few dices of pickled something with my chicken.", "author": "Michael S."}

Since Philly and his wife don't cook too often, it's more exciting for him, and Muracci made it to his top lunch spot.\n\nWow.  To my surprise, the curry is flavor-packed.  Very spicy (as in the spices.)  The katsu was made just right.  Probably the best katsu I ever had. \n\nI got the medium spicy, and it's just the right hotness for me.

To get me through the time until trips back home, I fill the half-jap void in my chest with bad quality sushi and homemade terriyaki sauce (which never tastes as good as when someone else makes it, you know?)\n\nBut today I found Muracci's (courtesy of Matt J.) and finally tried it. I was waiting to brave the line (brought a book and everything) but I arrived at 2 and was in and out with my hot chicken curry with vegetables in less than 10 minutes. The curry is spicy and sweet at the same time, just like Obachan used to make. The carrots are cooked just perfectly, the broccoli is crisp, and it's served in generous proportions over white or brown rice (another thing like my grandmother-- generous proportions because she always thought I was hungry, even when she tried to pile on a 3rd serving). Their pickled cabbage side is crisp and perfect, but I still like my grandmother's sweet pickles better.\n\nIt's so good it makes me a little homesick. The only thing that would make this just like my grandmothers house  would be to sell onigiri the size of your fist with umebosh inside, manju with red bean paste, daikon kim chi, nato (this is not a good thing and i hate that her fridge always smells like it) and getting drunk on this fermented ume plum gin she makes that's supposedly \"good for throat and nose\". \n\nYeah, that much alcohol would be good for that.\n\nI digress.

Both meats were well prepared, the pork was not overly lined with fat but not too lean and dry. The chicken is from chicken breast so it'll never be like dark meat but was still tender. So why 3 stars... the curry just didn't live up to the hype. Although very good, and had good depth I felt that Japacurry was a bit better. The spices and flavoring are slightly more intense and rich. I'm also going to rate Muracci's curry against Miki's in the outer Richmond district. Although Muracci's was a bit better tasting than Miki's, I really like the fact Miki adds in shredded/minced pork into their curry sauce. As others have mentioned, it's a nice touch that brown rice is available here which tasted good.\n\nI wouldn't make a special trip just for Muracci's curry, but if you're in the financial district and need a quick bite to eat and not be disappointed by over paying for an expensive and bland lunch, hit this hole in the wall up.", "author": "Andrew L."}

It's small, with no awning, but there is a giant picture of a smiling man/boy that's presumably Muracci, their son??  Not sure.  \n\nAnyway, the place is slightly bigger than what I imagined.  Because from all the yelp reviews, I thought it was gonna be just a counter and standing room for 2.  But no, my friend and I, being the first to arrive, had literally 10 seats to choose from!  I sat on the tall stool next to the window for a second then decided to settle on the 2-person small table next to the bathroom.  I love having choices! \n\nMusic is soothing, by the way.  Soft Brazilian bossa nova is somehow really Japanese and really fitting here.  The inconspicuous restaurant, the Italian-sounding name, the jazzy sound, it's all very Murakami to me.  \n\nI had the veggie and tofu curry, a little over $7 after tax.  My friend had the chicken curry.  I had mine medium hot and was perfect.  My friend thought her mild sauce was not spicy enough.  I very much loved the pickles that come with the rice.  It's crunchy and pungent and compliments so well with the rich curry and white rice.  \n\nBy 11:30am, more people came but there were still a couple of seats available.  We left a little before 12 so I am not sure how crowded it gets after that.\n\nBusiness-wise, I think this will work out really well.

Ever since trying the Japanese chain restaurant, CoCo Ichibanya Curry House, I have been on a mission to find a good curry house in the States.  Muracci's definetly fits the bill.  \n\nThis afternoon, I had the traditional beef curry with white rice.  The menu states that the curry is prepared for 2 days to bring out the flavor.  Welcome to flavor country!  The curry was not too spicy and full of taste.  The only drawback was that there could have been more beef.\n\nWhen going to a curry house, I don't expect much in terms of ambiance.  However, the line snaking past the door was a little annoying.  In addition, the wait after the order was like kicking a man while he's down.  Even so, the curry was worth the wait.  If you're in a hurry, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

The eggs and green onions were tasty, but some of my egg white was a little bit runny. That's not a deal-breaker for me, but it's just a heads up if you are weary of uncooked eggs. The rice was scalding hot when the dish came out, a sign of prompt and perhaps overenthusiastic service. It took several minutes for the dish to cool down and in the meantime I was gulping water to compensate. \n\nThis is a small place that definitely caters to the eat-on-the-go working crowd, so it gets cramped when all ten or so seats are filled and several more are waiting in line. The service is friendly as mentioned before. I just wish my food was just a bit more evenly cooked. Will have to try a curry dish next time.", "author": "Kevin L."}

A person with a 30 minute lunch, should not have to wait 45 minutes for PRE-MADE curry! But I will cut them some slack on their first day. \n\nMuracci's is a cute little whole in the wall - one table for two and a few stools along the wall. For the grand opening, seems like they had a lot of drop-ins from FiDi-ites looking for a good place to eat. Mr. Mike and I arrived at Muracci's and placed 2 orders of curry at 12:44pm. We waited, waited, and waited some more. We did not leave until 1:20pm. Every time they called out an order,  with bright and hopeful eyes we watched...thinking it would be ours. But no..it was not until we asked them how much longer for our curry that they finally noticed our lonely ignored order slip. \n\nAs for the curry, not too shabby. I ordered the chicken katsu curry (medium spicy) with white rice. Not worth the 40 minute wait, but I am willing to go back and try more. The taste reminded me of packaged boil-it-yourself curry from the Korean supermarkets, but those taste pretty good so I'm NOT complaining. The only thing - for $8.50, they could have given more chicken katsu for the large amount of curry they give you.\n\nEven though Muracci's made me wait a very, very long time, their friendly staff and yummy curry makes it hard for me to dislike this cute little hole in the wall.

There isn't a big sign like the other nearby restos (Banana House, Murphy's Irish Pub....for example) For those that are first timers it is located closer to the corner of BUSH and Kearny than pine.

The boyfriend and I ordered the Chicken Katsu curry and it took about 15 minutes.\n\n4) For most Asians, HOT translates to eh...spicy.  It will make your nose run.\n\n5) it is pretty cheap.  I think that the boyfriend and I spent under 20 dollars on our two chicken katsu curries.\n\n6) The inside is small and can be stuffy.  They pack your food to go...so find a sunny spot near union square to enjoy your curry.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied.  Yet my minor complaints:  1) the curry was too runny and 2) my mom puts potatoes, carrots and more meat into hers (who doesn't love their MOM's CURRY more??? and she didn't even pay me to type that!) \n\nPlus, It looks like they use the S&B curry powder (my mom uses the same) and that is what really makes it taste great and easy to churn out.

Fresh noodles, not dried. Some signs taped to the counter show favorite curry combos. The pictures of food look delicious. A few minutes later and my order is done, I hurry it back to the hotel. I can feel it's piping hot through the bag.\n\nInside my room I hurriedly unwrap the steaming bag of goodies. They've packaged the noodles separately from the curry in a bowl. I pour the curry over the noodles. Big chunks of chicken pile out with generously cut vegetables and a thick curry soup. I taste it. It's perfect.

The bf, who was in curry heaven after devouring his food, was in disbelief that I did not enjoy my meal (I barely ate half, and this is saying a lot because for those who know me, I eat..a lot) and was convinced the lack of flavor was a direct result of burned out tastebuds (see, I told you he doesn't like me eating spicy foods).

It's hard because it closes at 6 pm and it's not close enough to the area in SoMa where I work.  So, I worked up this big appetite to come eat here and get a katsu curry (pork).  The quiet, shy waitress politely says \"we're out of that\".  Alright, so I'll have the chicken katsu.  The waitress says we're out of that.  What about beef?  Out of that.  Dammmit.  I've come all this way to have some katsu curry and I can't get any.  Eventually, I settled on the Salmon curry, but I wanted white rice and they were out of that.  You have to get Japanese curry with white rice.  It's a must b/c it soaks up the curry the best.  I did come here a day before the Christmas holiday though and they said they cut down on supplies in lieu of the holidays.  I would've given an extra star had I not wanted katsu curry sooooo much.  \nThe serving is decent, but not enough for the $9 you spend for it.  The sweet taste of the curry is good, but i'm used to it being sweeter and having a stronger flavor.  The place is really small, so be prepared to wait if you come during rush hours.  It is reminiscent of restaurants I visited when I vacationed in Japan.  I would try this place again hopefully to try some katsu curry next time.", "author": "Robert K."}

I must admit that I was slightly annoyed when I called ahead and placed my order.  The person taking my order said that it wouldn't be ready for another 30 minutes!  C'mon, 30 min. to prepare Katsu Curry at a joint that churns out food to hundreds of people a day??  I got over it ... fairly quickly.  \n\nLike many lunch stops in SF, Muracci's is a small, crowded,  in-and-out food establishment the size of one of my closets at home so seating as you may have guessed is pretty sparce.  My office would at least provide me with a desk to eat on, a door which to shut out the immaculate fumes of the curry from the rest of my floor, and space to assume the food-comotose position ... I was ready; I opened my brown bag and was immediately excited for a few reasons.  First, I got to use chopsticks ... I absolutely love eating with chopsticks and use them as often as possible.  Second, there were sides packaged separately; one for the spicy curry (in a 1/2 lb. container like you see at the deli!!) and a couple others for pickled red and green stuff, and finally my last-second addition, mac salad from L&L's Hawaiian BBQ across the way from Muracci's.  This, as I said, was a last second addition to my meal, one which I debated in my head for all but 15 seconds.  In my opinion, mac salad should accompany any dish with white rice and meat ... it just works.    \n\nThe meal itself was amazing.  I have to say a good Katsu Curry depends on the the flakiness of the panko crust, the juiciness of the meat, and of course the flavor of the curry; fortunately, it had all of these.  Plus, throw in refreshing red and green pickles AND my personal touch, the mac salad ... oh, sweet baby Jesus!!  My favorite part of the meal, however, was \"dunking\" the pieces of Katsu meat into the 1/2 lb. container of spicy curry.  Oftentimes, I judge food by not only how it tastes, where I am, or whom I am with, but rather how my body sits on its seat afterwards.  After Muracci's, my body was slouched backwards, my head faced the ceiling, and my feet extended under my desk.  Overall, this meal was a huge success.", "author": "Brian S."}

My first thoughts are, . . .This place MUST be good for all this.  So after a 5 min wait in line, we get to order.  I had the chicken Teriyak and my friend had the chicken katsu curry.  The gentleman behind the counter, was very friendly.  \nWe now began the \"wait\".  A 24 min wait for our food.  I have a hard time with this, because even though they were busy, from what I can see its mostly re-heating.  There were BIG pots of curry on the stove, and all the rice was ready.  As were the miso soup.  So all that needed to be done was the katsu and the chicken.\n\nSo after the wait.  I got a DRY, STRINGY almost NO SAUCE Teriyaki, with flavorless brown rice, some veggie thing I cant identify, 5 pieces of lettuce with a drop of dressing and some pre-prepared miso soup.  I wouldn't wait 2 min for food like this, much less 24!  My co-worker's katsu curry was better, but definitely NOT worth waiting for.  I don't know what other curry's people have had before to rate this place so highly. It was ok, just average curry, not great and not worth waiting for.  \nI guess if this is the only curry you've ever had, and have nothing to compare it to, then you might think it's good.\n\nI really had a hard time with the rating.

This place is the bomb.  Keep in mind, there might be better curry places in NY or LA or Tokyo or at your mom's but unless its in SF, I don't give a hoot.  This place is the shiz nitz and anyone who gives it less than 4 stars is out of his mind and a curry snob.  Only one word for someone like that....  \"boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\"\n\nBeing Asian and having spent a year in Japan, I have to say, this is one of the best quality curry I've tasted in the city.  Its pretty damn authentic.  I just got the Chicken Katsu Curry (hot) and was enjoying every minute of my meal.  I almost licked the to-go container expect my co-workers would have thought I was crazy.  Actually, I didn't want curry stains on my shirt.  I can't wait until I go back and try some of their Udon Curry dishes.  (Disclaimer: When I say hot, I mean Asian hot not American hot.  You know what I'm talking about.  My curry made my nose run a little bit.  Be warned folks.)\n\nThe only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the wait is a bit too long.  If you have a full hour for lunch and want some good Japanese food, then try Muracci.  If you are in a time crunch, then this may not be for you, although, I think there is something called \"an express meal\" where you get prepared curry.  But you still have to wait in line to order.\n\nI think this place will pleasantly surprise you as it is the best Japanese curry in the city.

Can't wait for your lunch? Then call in your order, get a pre-made curry, or go after 1.30 pm. Trying to up your fiber intake? Then get your curry with brown rice. Every bite of the chicken katsu curry reminded me of when Dad would whip up quick dinners by prepping some Japanese S&B curry, veggies, and leftover meat -- when, that is, he wasn't grilling bologna on a makeshift pan made out of tinfoil. So feeling the burn of the\"Hot\" curry on my palate was like being a kid again, only without the post-dinner belt beatings, verbal abuse, and unreasonable expectations of success that led to various acts of rebellion against paternity, maternity, and tradition including, but not limited to, failing math, reading literature, smoking, drinking, and playing the meat flute in the dressing room of my high school theatre courtesy of G, R, M, K, R, B and W (don't laugh -- I can play the overture to Tannhauser) -- and all for the reasonable price of $8.50! SCORE!\n\nSpeaking of authentic, I can't express how wonderful it is to walk into a Japanese curry house and be greeted with a hearty \"irrashaimase,\" and, naturally, I just chalk this reaction up to my inbred Japanese JINGOISM and outright xenophobia which makes no sense because I'm technically a fourth-generation American so I REALLY should look upon non-English greetings with disdain by saying \"It's okay, speak English now, YURR IN THE GOOD OLE YOU ESS OF AYYY\" right before I dump my tea in the Bay, annex a couple of islands, and YOU CALL THIS A STIMULUS PACKAGE MOTHERFUCKER? THIS'LL ONLY GET ME TWO HOURS WITH A HOOKER but yeah, it's a nice added touch of authenticity to one of my favorite new lunch spots in the FiDi.\n\n***No, I'm kidding.

I would've completely missed it if my cousin hadn't pushed me towards the door. By the time we got there for lunch at 3PM, they were sold out of a lot of their popular items (i.e. the chicken katsu, pork katsu, and their lunch special). My cousin was disappointed since she wanted to try the lunch special: the oyster fry. Initially, we were just gonna get some fried vegetarian curry pockets (not sure what they're called). However, upon further contemplation, she changed her mind and we got the salmon fry curry to share too. It came with four pieces of fried salmon, curry sauce, pickled vegetables, and your choice of white or brown rice. The salmon was crispy and moist, complimenting the curry sauce well. Overall, the food is decent, but I give Muracci's four stars because the cashiers and owner are super nice. I suggest going before the lunch rush if you want to be able to try their more popular items.

Their process needs a major overhaul- they routinely mess up orders, sometimes completely forgetting them. In fact, my longest total wait was over 40 minutes- and that's when I called it in.  \nI think getting pissed off at them is almost an initiation ritual. Watching the massive wrecks and tempers flare has become a form of entertainment during the insane waits. When a person's brows furrow and lips twitch after being told that their order isn't ready after 15 minutes but they still stick around, it's kind of a \"welcome to the club\".\nWhy put up with it?\nBecause the one and only thing they manage to do right is the food.   As we know, their curry  is exactly perfect (and katsu too, I hear), vegetables are perky, and even their tofu (something I never order anywhere else) are simultaneously crisp and tender; like pillows for little baby angels. \nAfter a while, one realizes the futility of getting agitated... when I'm in the mood, I have to do a quick patience-budget check. Surprisingly, I'm willing to suck it up from time to time.\nNow I've conditioned my mind to blank out after I order. When I come to, I usually find myself back at my desk eating, with no recollection of the intervening 30 minutes.\n\nHint: Order, then leave; go for a walk. and always, ALWAYS, re-check your order AT the restaurant. Calling in an order is useless unless you do it before noon.\n\nIf patience is a problem, go to sushi bay a few doors down. Not as good (but not bad either), but better than angry, and it can offset some of the japo-curry craving.", "author": "Edward P."}

The meat was just right, not dry as it may be tricky to order pork when going out to eat. The curry is given to you in a small round, plastic container 1/4 filled. You can either pour the curry on top or dip your meat in the sauce. I like to do a combination. I pour the curry onto my rice and dip my meat in the sauce. MMMMMmm.

Unfortunately, they're never open weekends and they close at 6pm, which makes coming here difficult for me since I don't work in the area.  So when I finally got the chance to try them, I rushed over as fast as I could.\n\nMuracci's has a surprsingly extensive menu, with noodle soups, lunch specials, and of course, the curries.  I intially wanted the katsu curry, but instead opted for the regular chicken curry, which I mistakenly ordered spicy, rather than mild, which would have allowed the order to be filled immediately.  Instead, I waited a good 10 minutes for my spicy chicken curry, which apparently is a much shorter wait than during peak hours (I went at about 1:30 pm).  For less than $8, you get a good amount of steamed white rice, a little portion of tasty pickles and a separately packaged hefty portion of boneless chicken pieces (both dark and white meat) in a somewhat spicy curry sauce.  I loved that the curry wasn't placed all over the rice- it allowed you to control exactly how much curry you put on your rice.  The pickles that came with the dish were wonderful- I just wish that I could have had some more of them.  \n\nOverall, while I was charmed by the owners and how authentic it felt, I wasn't completely blown away by the curry.  I think that the sauce was great- it was definitely vibrant with spices and spicy enough to require drinking some water, but my choice of protein probably wasn't best, as I'm used to eating Japanese-style curry with katsu.  My fault, yes, but I didn't like the chicken curry all that much.  3 stars for a good meal- I'm reserving more stars until I get the chance to try it again, especially the katsu curry.", "author": "Angela H."}

I ordered the beef curry and I usually love Japanese curry, and I in face did like the curry sauce, but the beef was sorely lacking. First of all, there were only like 8  small pieces, which seemed like a tiny portion, but much more disappointing was that two of the pieces were completely inedible and were actually 100% fat pieces. Another 3 pieces were some sort of meat that looks like it came from a cow, but definitely was not a piece of regular stew beef. Not sure what it was, but had a very funny texture and psychologically my mind was screaming, \"Yuck!\"  Only 2-3 pieces were regular stew beef, which is what I was expecting. Basically I ate curry sauce over rice, which was not worth $7.50. Next time I'm definitely going to Delica in the Ferry Building for my Japanese curry.", "author": "Jeff L."}

The beef, which was advertised as tender was quite tough....stew meat. Four small pieces. The chicken curry was ok but also meager...5 bites.

I was on my lunch hour and the line was out the door, the restaurant was packed with people standing through the length of the place that was lined with bar stools and t a long table against a mirror so you can people watch while you eat.  My coworker told me it was really good, and so I decided to go for it.  I ordered the weekly special which was advertised as being ready right away with no wait.  It was quite good, the curry was rich and spicy.  It had ground beef, onions, eggplant and tomato in it.  They give you a choice of brown or white rice, a small container of pickled cabbage and a pinch of red ginger? The curry was in a plastic bowl which I think was a good idea so the rice would not soak it up.  As for the rice...they really skimp on the rice and charge you an extra buck plus some cents for more rice.  The dish already cost $10, I think it was a bit on the high side for what you get, but considering the location I'm sure they have to make up for the cost of rent.  After I ate my lunch, I ordered my bf an order of the pork katsu to go, it took 15 minutes for my order...I guess that is good that it probably was cooked to order, but just keep in mind that you will have to wait longer if you cooked something that needs be be fried, verses a curry dish that they just add veggies or tofu to. I also got the fried curry bread.  There were two types vegetable and beef, all the beef was gone and I wondered if the veggie was not as good...it was actually VERY good and pretty filling.

Before reading on, the spoiler alert is this: the food is very good. Worth the wait...but that's where my only problem was.\nI stood in line for a good 10 minutes. Placed order. Waited another 10 minutes. They called number 57 so I knew my order was next. For some reason though they called the next 3 orders by meal (Chicken Katsu, etc.) instead of the number. 3 Yups immediately grabbed them. One was my Chicken Katsu but one of them apparently ordered the same so she assumed it must have been hers. Oh well, rather than get in an argument over whose order it was (so third world!) I decided to \"act British\" - that would be politely staying the course while waiting. Big mistake. After a few more orders were handed off I finally decided to say something as by now I was sure the Yup had grabbed my lunch. Sure enough, they didn't see my #58 anywhere up on the ticket holder so they had to make my lunch all over gain. I didn't clock it but from but from the time I went in to the time I left (with a To Go order) was at least 30 minutes, possibly more like 40. I can't give it 5 stars for that.\nThe food though is pretty good. Chicken Katsu with a nice medium spiced curry sauced (simmers for two days apparently). They also give you a choice of brown rice which is really nice. Lots of tasty curries and udons on the menu (and even a few different varieties of rolls, like California, cucumber, etc.). I will definitely go back as the food is worth it, but I will either try to beat the maddening lunch rush or wait until it is over, never going during peak lunch hour again.\n\nUpdate: True to my word I went this time a little after they opened at 11 (will never go during lunch rush again). Much better this time. Only a few other people in there. Wait time for food was about 10 min. but since it is all cooked to order this is ok.

I personally get mild, but I've heard complaints that the \"spicy\" level isn't taste-numbing enough.

Couple that with deep fried meat (pork, chicken, shrimp, or salmon) and you've got yourself a full, tasty lunch for under $10. A non-curry item worth mentioning is the garlicky karaage (fried boneless chicken) which is served with some horseradish/wasabi dip on the side.\n\nThe shop is very tiny with only a few seats so prepare to order to-go. During peak lunch hours the wait might take up to 10-15 minutes.

It's a bit infuriating, but if you have a full hour (or more) to kill for lunch, it is definitely worth the wait.  If you don't, figure out some other trick to get your curry fix--either by going early or calling in your order.

I had the beef and veg udon. I had expected the curry consistency to be thick - just like what they would serve over the rice but it was watery. Maybe this is just their style but the taste was pretty good and the beef portion was pretty generous. BF had tonkatsu and it was a tasty thick fat portion but I think they are a tad stingy on the curry cos I would prefer my rice to be DRENCHED in curry..not just wading in curry! What I did not like was the restaurant was pretty cramped and could only seat about 10 people (mostly counter seating) so when you are eating, you are elbow to elbow with someone else...not very comfortable.

I was mildly peeved when the counterperson forced me to order brown rice, claiming the white was sold out.  However, then I saw other people after me ordering white rice, so I had to approach the counter again for \"permission\" to change my order to white rice.\n\nWhen I got the katsu back to the office, I was extremely peeved that the piece of pork I got was far too thick and riddled throughout with unpleasant fat and grizzle.  Moreover, the breading was very thick and mealy beneath the surface.  The sauce also seemed gummy and gloppy, for some reason.\n\nIn the past, I admired Muraccis for doing one dish PERFECTLY every time, even if it was the most expensive takeout lunch in my rotation of lunch spots.

I received no such warning when I ordered my meal. I could have waited 20 minutes without one, but 40 minutes is just not the kind of service I'd expect from any restaurant.  \n\nThe curry had no vegetables and as for flavor it is pretty meh.

They're giving you a 300% mark up because it's \"convenient.\" 40 minutes of waiting is not convenient. \n\nThis place even sucks compared to Matsuya in Japan. It is no Little Spoon or C&C Curry House. \n\nEveryone who is giving this place 4 stars+ is an idiot. \n\nI'll give it +1 star because the chicken katsu wasn't too dry.

This place is off the chain - I've had Japanese curry before but never like this.  Seriously, you will be dreaming about this place for the rest of the day after only one trip here.  One con about this place is that it's tiny but as long as they keep cranking out their delicious food, I am happy to get it to go (rather than squeezing myself into one of the like, 6 available stools/chairs) and eat outside.  I've tried their katsu curry as well as their hot noodle curry soup bowls - highly recommend both of them!  You might have to restrain yourself from licking your plate/bowl, it's that good.  They also offer Japanese drinks and sweet treats.  I recommend calling in your order so that you don't have to wait inside the cramped space.  The staff is very fast and nice, if not a bit frenetic - I would be too if I were trying to serve all these people desperate for some Muracci's to brighten up their FiDi week.  A true gem in the FiDi, I wish there was one in every neighborhood!", "author": "Suzanne V."}

I give this four stars for authenticity, but in reality I want to only give it three stars.  The main reason for that is that I actually don't like Japanese curry, but I lived there for 5 years, and now it has the nostalgia factor going for it.  Not only was it spot on as Japanese curry, the location itself is like sitting in Tokyo all over again, except with a few too many white people wandering around.  The owners are super nice, and the other food that I do like, such as the potato croquette, was awesome.", "author": "Daniel M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-14", "description": "I've been coming here since this place opened and love it. So far I've only stuck to what the place specializes (and the agedashi tofu). I love the curry - and I get it spicy for the dulling of the tasting buds, although it's bearable spicy (at least for me). The line is long - so just call your order in advance. Portions are huge - I generally share with a co-worker (saves money + saves the overbulging stomach of a young woman). So as far as agedashi tofu goes, it's \"okay\", but not as good as going to a more traditional sit down restaurant. I think the problem lies in the fact that by the time you get to your desk its' a bit soggy and it doesn't have that crisp that agedashi tofu should have. I won't ever reject tofu though - soy lover for life.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

They don't have much selection though .. only California roll , avocado roll , and cucumber roll . Very simple & not creative at all . The California roll is only $3.25 and it's okay but it's not all that great . I've tried the salmon curry which was alright . The salmon was very tasty and delicious . The curry was okay .. they asked me if I wanted mild or hot . I asked for hot which turned out to be a little spicy . It tasted like they put a little bit of wasabi in the curry . The salmon curry came with one piece of salmon , one mound of rice , and very very little homemade radish sprinkled on top of the rice . All for what ? 8 ?! It was such a rip off !! I've also tried their green salad which was okay except they didn't provide enough dressing !! The potatoe salad is really good though .", "author": "Eileen L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-23", "description": "My cubie was craving curry and this place had such good reviews that we decided to brave the 15 block journey during lunch rush just to see for ourselves. It was totally worth the trek. The menu includes non-curry options but why would you go to a Japanese curry house and not order curry? I thought it was interesting that one of their add on options is cheese. I didn't try it but my friend who lived in Tokyo for a few years raved about the cheesy curry she had in the curry shops in Japan. I think I'll try that next time. Our food was very tasty but I feel that the spiciness rating was inaccurate. I ordered the Chicken Curry Ramen Soup in Hot and feel like what I got was actually medium. Granted, my taste buds have probably been completely burned off from my vapid consumption of Flaming Hot Cheetos while growing up but it feels like they simmered down the spicy levels to suit a more sensitive palette. There's nothing wrong w/ being consumer friendly though. I wish this place was closer to my office so I could eat here more often but it's probably better that it's far away... My officemates would probably not want me to smell like curry after lunch every day...", "author": "Queenie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-07-26", "description": "You know, there's a reason this place is located in the FiDi-it's as bland as all the salary women and men in the FiDi! My boss, who doesn't like things spicy, had to borrow some of my co-worker's spicy curry to put over her mild curry! The mild curry was virtually tasteless. This place is also not as fast as they'll have you believe-I had three orders of curry and a Donburri-it took a good 15, 20 minutes. The taste of the curry was bland and wasn't very hearty-do they really simmer it for two days with veggies and meats? The meats, esp. in my Donburri did not taste particularly fresh. My Donburri was boring-plain and simple. I wonder if they had to tone it down for the folks that can't handle ethnic food-they need to pick it up a notch! The prices are steep for the portion and taste (really, pushing $9 for curry/!!). After Japan, I was hoping for a place that would be decent enough to satisfy my cravings-Muracci's didn't do it for me.", "author": "Jenny W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-02", "description": "I gave Muracci's 3 stars only because the wait was SO long. I even waited til after peak hours (or so I thought) and I still had to wait a good 30 minutes. I even tried to pre order via phone, and I wasn't able to get through on the line, so I just had to suck it up walk over and wait in the line. I get the fact that they make every order fresh, but really, it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a lunch that's supposedly fast food. Otherwise, it would have easily been 4 stars. I had the hot katsu curry with extra veggies and the curry had a great depth and complexity of flavor. It was spicy, but not too spicy and had clearly been long simmered. The katsu was crisp and had a nice panko crust. Inside the pork was juicy.  Unfortunately, my \"extra\" vegetables turned out to be a coupl eof pieces of broccoli and a slice of carrot. In any case, I'll be back, but at a really weird hour, just to ensure that I don't die of hunger next time smelling those yummy curry smells waiting in Muracci's doorway.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-10", "description": "I guess you shouldn't order the curry spicy (like I did last time) because it ends up overpowering the taste so I went with medium this time.  Also got my curry with tonkatsu since everyone on here says it's the bomb, boy was it goooood. Midway through making my order they told me there was no more potatoes which really bummed me out so they offered to substitute it with another extra, nothing on the menu interested me but the potatoes but I really didn't want them to go through the trouble of refunding my money since they were really busy so I substituted with a boiled egg; imagine my suprise when I opened my togo container to find not only the boiled egg but the potatoes I had wanted in the first place as well so that definately earns them an extra star. The curry wasn't watery like last time neither so i guess I just went on a bad day last time. I guess it helps when a restaurant gets alot of good reviews on yelp cause I might've never came back here which I'm glad I did. Glad I work nearby now.

Every kind of Japanese curry there is in the options of mild, medium or hot.  This place is so freaking good.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  I love the katsu curry which was astounding by the way... amazingly juicy and tender in an ultra crisp coating-there is actually a distinctive crunching sound when the chef slices the katsu into pieces!  The curry is blow your mind tasty though... that is the real go getter.  I had the mild so I didn't have too much spice barring the taste factor.  It's really good stuff!  The pricing is relatively inexpensive but when you consider the size of their portions, I'd say it is downright cheap... for the katsu at least... my friend had the grilled salmon and that did look quite a bit stingier in size... (less than half of my serving?)  My other friend had the chicken curry though and not only did they get a large serving of chicken that looked like my pork katsu, they also had chicken pieces served in their curry sauce.  I love the house made neon pink super crunchy pickles (I think it's ume plum flavored daikon?) on the side. And I really like that you have the option of white or brown rice.  The seating is extremely limited in this tiny dinky little place but it's easily taken to go and enjoyed elsewhere.  The service is extremely fast which is a big plus for me although the line can also be extremely long because of how many other customers who love this spot.  I also really liked the fried sweet potato croquette.  Very thick, very crisp on the outside, very fresh warm like and fluffy on the inside.  All kinds of yummy. So on my second run, I ordered the special of the month which was the Muracci's Spicy Noodles: Ground Beef, Onion, Green Onion, Hot Chili Pepper, in the house curry sauce over dry ramen noodles.  The noodles had a nice chewy texture without being too firm and the whole dish was a perfect level of saucey without being soggy.  I think they really have their perfect formula down at this place.  It's my ever consistent cheap eats love.", "author": "Angela W."}
