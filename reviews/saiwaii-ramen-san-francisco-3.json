This is a first time here and sadly will be the last.\n\nMy wife ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with the Avocado roll that was part of their lunch special and I had the Miso Ramen with California roll as my side. The rolls arrived fast which was a red flag to me but cannot judge whether it was made fresh or not. There was a weird plastic like texture from the sushi and it was very cold (later realizing it may be last night's leftovers and was refrigerated). \n\nThe Ramen took some time and when it arrived at our table was warm. Having just opened, we expected nice hot broth along with smooth and tender noodles. This did not happen and despite finishing the dishes (Mama did not raise me to waste), we did not enjoy the food. \n\nUltimately, we will not be returning to this location as the service cannot make up for the food that we had.

If you're looking for a good bowl of ramen, I would go elsewhere.  \n\nThe price range here is about $10-12 for a bowl, which is cheap compared to the plethora of $15+ ramen joints popping up around the bay area.  Unfortunately, pricing is the only place where Sawaii \"wins\".  \n\nI ordered the spicy garlic tonkotsu ramen.  While the portion size was nice, the flavor was lacking in many places.  The flavor of the soup did not live up to its glorious and flavorful name - it was actually quite bland and dull compared to most other ramen shops.  There was no fat cling on the noodles - usually for tonkotsu soups, there is some amount of fat in the soup that allows it to cling to the noodles and bring flavor into your  bites, but there was none of that going on here.  The pork chashu was also hard and flavorless.  The noodles were on the softer side, which I didn't particularly enjoy either.  Altogether, the bowl of ramen was disappointing and underwhelming. \n\nTLDR Service and pricing was really great, but the food wasn't.", "author": "Tim L."}

My family and I came late on a Friday evening and luckily for us it wasn't super busy as our party of five waited mere minutes to be sat. Saiwaii doesn't just serve ramen, they have sushi rolls, sushi, donburi, and other appetizers. It was rather chilly outside, as it tends to get cold late at night in that area, so we were all down for their Ramen specialties. \n\nI saw another table eating a reddish ramen bowl with plenty of fried chicken chunks floating on top and I was sold. I was so glad I order the Spicy Mala with karaage chicken, sliced pork, one half of a soft boiled egg, nori and plenty of ramen noodles in spicy soup. I loved the spice and overall flavor of the dish and the karaage chicken bites were crispy to the bite despite the fact they laid them in a bowl of noodle broth. The meal was so filling, but it was also the right amount of food for famish diners. Others my group went with the Tonkotsu Ramen, and Miso Ramon and the Unagi Don. Everyone seems satisfied by the meal, especially since everyone's dish was under twelve dollars.   \n\nSaiwaii has great service as our meal was deliver less than ten minutes after we ordered and to keep customers entertained they have The Food Network playing on the flat screen television screen above everyone's head. I can't wait to return to Saiwaii Ramen whenever I have a noodle and soup craving and I'm in the neighborhood.

I ordered the lunch special which was choose a ramen and roll. I ordered the spicy garlic tonkatsu with the salmon avocado roll. Our food came out fairly quick, but I was a bit disappointed in the ramen. The ramen was over cooked so the ramen tasted soggy, the ramen came with a ton of spinach, a little bit of mushrooms, two slices of pork and some garlic. The spicy was an oil, which I thought was a bit too much. I was also disappointed the ramen didn't come with corn or egg which it used to from what I remembered. Also the sushi rolls were alright, presentation could have been a bit better, the rice was messy. But all in all service was good, I cant complain for the price I paid with plenty to eat, but I wouldnt say its the best ramen in town but def would come eat if I was in the area and craving ramen.

I officially feel like I've probably been the ordering the wrong ramen in all my previous visits.\n\nBeing a creature of habit, I routinely order the spicy garlic tonkatsu. This flavor, as highly recommended as it is, always seemed to waver between underwhelming and decently good. So this time, I changed it up - I opted for the spicy mala and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThough I wished the karaage was served on the side (cause soggy deep fried foods are not my favorite), I thought this ramen was great value for $11.75. It featured a soft boiled half egg, 3 large pieces of karaage, another 2 thick slices of char siu, and a helping of other toppings (roasted seaweed, spinach, green onions, etc). \n\nWe also shared two rolls - the panda roll and the paradise roll. Runaway favorite was the paradise roll! Despite only having 6 pieces, the combination of eel, crab, avocado, and fried sweet red onions really hit all the right notes, flavor-wise and texturally - sweet, creamy, savory, crunchy, etc. I also loved that it wasn't slathered in sauce/mayo. The panda roll was definitely more delicate with the butterfish topping and asparagus cores, but it was still pretty good.\n\nAll in all, good meal this time.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

First thing I notice, the table wasn't even cleaned properly from people who had eaten before us. That alone is disgusting. I cleaned and moved on.\n\nWe were starving so we order right away and asked for water. Spoiler alert: we never got water. \nAfter a while, my GF asks for tea and the waiter brings us tea instead.

After another 3-5 minutes or so, he brings my food. I had ordered a large donburi with pork cutlet thinking it would come with curry. Boy, I was wrong. No curry. But that's my fault for not knowing, I guess. \nThe plate looked like someone had jerked off on the cutlet, with egg white spread on the cutlet and some green onion and pink ginger. \nEverything was sweet as hell, with overpowering onion and ginger taste. Worst of all, the pork was drier than the sand in the desert of Sahara. \n\nI hadn't eaten anything all day, so I was starving. Although unpleasant, I had no choice but to eat. So, I asked the waiter to bring me a side of curry so I attempt to eat the food. \nHe says there was going to be an extra charge, which... okay. I agreed. He brought curry, which was an absolute disgrace to the word curry. I took roughly about 4 spoonfuls of curry and managed to finish the food. \n\nI asked for the check and he added extra $3.5 for literally a quarter of a portion of disgusting, store-bought, premade, crappy curry. However, it's just money... I'll make more of it in a lifetime, so I paid and left. \n\nMy sincere question is: If any individual can cook better food than your restaurant, why and how are you even in business? Why is there no respect and love for food and more importantly for paying customers? I get it, you are busy (for some weird reason) but hire more people and give customers the service they deserve. It's not about running around and looking busy but about asking if the food is to their liking and if there is anything you can do to make my experience at YOUR restaurant a little better. \n\nNeedless to say, I am done with this place.

That sauce is insanely spicy.\n-I needed water cause of the insanely spicy meal, but their waitresses were hard to get ahold of. \n-If you ask to add mushrooms, they put in Enoki mushrooms. That's the one kind of mushroom I don't like.

The music that was playing in the background was hip and the place had a strong/great smell of garlic, which made me really hungry. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and added a dollar for the egg. Sadly, rather than receiving the nice gooey egg, I got an egg that was on the verge of being a hard boiled egg. Thus minus a star. However, the prices for ramen was only 8.95. Thus plus back the star.\n\nMy friend got the garlic tonkatsu ramen and hers was super yummy. There was a great taste of garlic and it tasted a lot more flavorful than the regular tonkatsu ramen. She got regular spiciness but I think that was already too spicy. So if you're not a fan of spiciness, it might be best to get mild.\n\nWe also got the soft shell crab and it was ok.

It's one of my favorite cozy, affordable spots in the area with comforting food. I think the ramen here is MUCH better than the offerings at Izakaya Sozai (seriously, stick to their specialties - don't get the ramen there), though definitely a step down from some of the more solid Japantown staples. It's great for the area, though! Not a ton of comparable offerings in the western end of the Inner Sunset. \n\nI always get the tonkotsu ramen - love the broth! But the sushi here is also solid. The wait staff is great - very prompt and friendly. Food comes out quickly, always hot and fresh. I'll certainly keep coming back!", "author": "Delia Z."}

I didn't have to wait at all when I came here for dinner one night. I've been here many times and I typically get the spicy garlic tonkotsu, which is alright. Not too much to complain about but also not great. This time I decided to try the spicy garlic miso ramen. I was very disappointed and wish I just stuck with my usual. The ramen really didn't have much flavor at all, other than spicy. Everything I eat, I love it spicy. Next time you want a spicy ramen here, stick with the spicy garlic tonkotsu. \n\nAside from the ramen, I always get the negi hama sushi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "description": "The Sunset has plenty of options for steamy noodle soup, thankfully so given the typical chilly and/or foggy weather.  While monopolistic competition prevails for pho and wonton noodle soup, the ramen scene is largely monopoloized by Izakaya Sozai and Saiwaii. \n\nTL;DR: In my opinion Izakaya's ritsu tonkotsu is more authentic and of superior quality, but there is only one ramen on the menu, plus occasional specials if you're lucky. Saiwaii is thus a good alternative in this part of SF, especially if would like more ramen options. Besides the traditional tonkotsu/miso/shoyu, Saiwaii also serves gimmicky spin-offs like mala and seafood. (Also, Saiwaii has way better lighting for food porn! Izakaya is very dim and my pics there always look ugly)\n\nThe broth here is alright--not very rich and flavorful, but if you get it spicy enough you will not be disappointed. However it was more oily and salty than I would have liked. In the bright foodporn-friendly-lighting, you can even see a thin film of oil. It sounds a bit gross but it turned out quite tasty, which is why I drank quite a bit of broth and got super thirsty afterwards. Noodles are just alright as well, not quite al dente, nothing special, and a bit too egg-based for my preferences.\n\nThe SPICY MALA is definitely the best deal, since it comes with chicken kara-age, chashu, half an egg, green onion, nori, and spinach. First of all, two types of meat included is unheard of, and none of the other options come with egg (though they totally butchered my half egg and I had to turn it upside down for my picture... sad.) The chicken kara age was not very meaty but surprisingly good, as the thick batter prevented it from getting soggy in the soup. The spinach was another excellent addition, earthy and nicely contrasting all the umami. \n\nI've also tried the SPICY MISO and SPICY GARLIC TONKOTSU, but I think the mala was more unique and better value. I would pass on the extra meat toppings which is an additional $4, which can get you an entire cup of cold brew coffee in SF(!!!) The spicy mala is the way to go if you want more meat and complimentary toppings.\n\nLike most standards for ramen spiciness, spicy is not very spicy: if you like spicy, I highly recommend getting extra spicy. Be aware that the spicy mala is spicier than other ramen, as you may notice with the bright red broth. Extra spicy level on spicy mala is thus wonderful for those who adore spicy foods, terrifying for the spice-intolerant or anyone with GERD. (Fun fact: mala is a term from the Sichuan region for Chinese food, translating to numbingly spicy)\n\nIt comes out to ~$14-15 after tip/tax/that weird extra SF tax--a bit pricey for a bowl of noodle soup, compared to the more budget-friendly pho and wonton noodle soup in the neighborhood, but within the normal price range for ramen. (Especially in SF...Where $4 can get you 3 pieces of pork belly, a cup of cold brew coffee, or a piece of artisan toast)", "author": "Edna C."}

They offer a lot of sides/additions that pair well with the ramen. I asked for extra spicy, corn, and chashu. The spice was a habanero blend which made my soup extra flavorful.

The pork was chewy and rubbery.  My friend got the chicken ramen which was made with free range chicken not frozen chicken which was OK , the soup lacks seaweeds or other ingredients.  It got green onions and cilantro.  My friend have to dip into my noodles because his soup was not enough to fill his appetite.

I remember their ramen being pretty good, so when I was craving noodle soup last week, I decided it was time to revisit.

I placed the order around 7:10pm and it arrived around 7:55pm.\n\n*Gyoza ($4.95)\n*Gyutan: beef tongue ($5.50)\n*Hatsu: grilled chicken hearts ($4)\n\nThe gyoza was pretty standard, but good. Totally fulfilled my pot sticker craving. The beef tongue was eh. No smokiness from being grilled or seared. And I found the sauce they used too sweet. Kinda reminiscent of teriyaki. I didn't like it. The chicken hearts were a better. Had a nice chew.\n\nSpicy garlic tonkotsu ramen: very spicy, includes cha shu, wakame, negi, menma, kikurage, ground pork ($10.95)\n*add Pork belly: cubes (+$4)\n*add Spinach (+$1)\n*add Corn (+$1)\n*add Enoki mushroom (+$1)\n\nThe ramen was okay. They give you a good amount of pork belly as an add on. It came with plenty of toppings. The only thing that felt kind of like a rip off were the enoki mushrooms. It was just one bunch. At $1, I expected at least two. The broth was nice and spicy, but I didn't get a lot of depth of flavor. I was expecting to taste more pork bone and garlic and just more levels of yumminess. The soup was more or less just salty and spicy.\n\nIt's nice to know I have more options when it comes to ramen for delivery.

It's a bummer that the egg is not included and it's an additional cost. On my last visit, despite my egg being butchered, it was cooked perfectly to my liking. \n\nJust FYI, gift certificates do not count for being used as tips.

Beef tongue, bacon-wrapped mochi, and their chicken karaage is good. Also, if you're a fan of eggs, ask them to add it to your ramen. They pre-cook the eggs so they stay soft boiled when they drop it into your bowl. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Dark wood all around combined with the ceiling lights romanticize the place a little.

My first time here was this past Thursday with a girlfriend and this was close to where she lived. It always seems busy when I've walked by here in the past so I wasn't surprised to see most tables filled up when we got here. We were seated immediately upon walking in. They have your basic ramen noodle soup bases (miso, shoyu, vegetarian, tonkotsu) and some special seafood options. We both got their garlic tonkotsu, mines mild spicy each with an egg. Other toppings included are chashu, bamboo shoots and green onion. I would totally agree that this place is just alright but well suited for those who are on a budget and happen to be in the area. Portion sizes are good for the price as ours were roughly $12/bowl egg included. \n\nThey also have sushi rolls if you aren't feeling ramen! And a wide variety of appetizers to choose from.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

This is probably one of my favorite ramen shops within the SF city area. \n\nMy favorite aspect of Saiwaii is like I mentioned, the spicyness of their ramen. I remembered my first visit I ordered my ramen extra spicy and that was a little too much spice even for me, so on my next few visits I toned down the spice level and it was perfect! Besides the spicyness, the noodles were cooked perfectly each time and the cha chu is always super tender! The only downside I see is that there are a lot of toppings that are extra charge, even an egg. But other than that the ramen itself is among the best!\n\nI also had sushi on a couple of occasions and they were ok. (Of course you can't expect top notch sushi at a restaurant focused on ramen).

I came here w my sister and BF and we ordered spicy garlic tonkatsu (1 mild, 1 extra spicy), regular tonkatsu ramen, fried calamari and spicy wings.\n\nThe spicy garlic tonkatsu broth was quite light, contrary to my expectations. The mild spicy doesn't really build up as you eat more of the meal which is usually the case at other restaurants, which was why I asked for mild. But they're not kidding when you say you want mild spicy so if you want that extra kick, just get regular spicy or extra spicy. The extra spicy garlic tonkatsu broth looked red af when it came out and tasted really spicy too. I wish the ramen included 1/2 soft boiled egg but it doesn't. Instead it has seaweed, cha Shu & some other stuff. I have to say the noodles were really good though with nice texture and it tasted fresh.\n\nThe tonkatsu ramen is the same except there's no spice or garlic and the broth has more of the pork flavor. It's light and not oily (good). \n\nThe spicy wings were a bit disappointing.

I didn't find it to be spicy at all, so would order it extra spicy if you are looking for any heat at all. I also added an egg and tofu to my ramen.\n\nMy ramen was pretty decent and the broth was served at just the right temperature.

That's why there was a lot of people standing outside. This place is small too. There was only two servers. I don't know if that's normal, but they were going on the slow side.

A couple dirty tables had their dishes and stuff removed but then a few mins after that it was cleaned off. It didn't make sense to me. Just clean it all @ once since you have people waiting!

And it's not like there wasn't a table ready for our group of four either. That made me so mad to see!\n\nSo we finally get seated. I don't like how you have to sit right next to someone you don't know. No offense. But it's so small in there, that that's how it is.

We figured it was worth it because the combo itself is only $2 more and you get a small sushi roll! We both went with tonkatsu ramen, the bf got a california roll and I got a salmon and avocado roll. \n\nThe sushi rolls came out first and they looked pretty standard. This isn't a sushi restaurant so you can't expect top notch fish or rolls. My salmon avocado roll was pretty good, the salmon was buttery, but the rice in the roll was kinda hard.. Same with the california roll that my bf ordered. Probably just old rice but bleh.\n\nThe ramen came out a few minutes after we finished the sushi rolls. Unfortunately I didn't yelp too much prior to ordering because I heard the spicy garlic tonkatsu is the popular choice at this place!! However I still enjoyed my tonkatsu broth. I like how they have the chili sesame oil and chili powder on the side to add to your broth. The broth had a pretty strong tonkatsu flavor which I liked, but when I was finishing, it got super salty and I couldn't finish the soup. I guess that is a common feat at a lot of ramen shops though. I liked the toppings on the ramen, it came with chasu pork, bamboo shoots, seaweed, wood ear mushrooms and green onions. The pork was okay, I like mine more tender. Bamboo shoots were super good!!! And the seaweed and mushrooms were a nice addition.\n\nThe food is okay, but the service is really quick.

Mmm that regular spicy garlic tonkatsu was on pointe! I'd definitely recommend that.\n\nSpicy ramen comes in mild, regular, and spicy. The regular definitely has a kick; I didn't feel it until midway thru the meal when I needed to blow my nose and my lips were tingling. I'd recommend getting something to neutralize it like an appetizer or something. Noodle:broth ratio was okay. Granted I'm a noodle person, I wished there were more noodles to enjoy the broth. The broth was great--a great vehicle for the rich flavors of the veggies, meat, and seasonings. Also, don't forget the pork belly. Such tenderness and incredibly meaty. Yum! Definitely had a moment with my ramen and pork belly.\n\nAlaskan salmon--the lemon slices on top makes the roll. It gives that extra oomf to the fresh sushi. This roll is a great complement to the spicy ramen; it gives your taste buds a break from the spicy flavors.\n\nService: Room for improvement. They didn't immediately give us a menu. If I was a regular, I wouldn't mind so much, but because this was my first time, I was itching to have the menu in hand. They were quick to do water refills. \n\nAmbiance: The locals know what's up. This place was packed on a memorial day Monday around 1pm. We waited a good 20-25mins for a party of 2.\n\nPrice: Bill came out to be around $48 (including tax, excluding tip) for a regular spicy tonkatsu with pork belly, regular spicy tonkatsu with pork belly and egg, and a Alaskan salmon sushi roll.

The broth itself was lacking salt and that deep rich umami flavor that you'd expect. The broth also had a smokey burnt taste to it.

Point being, I'm going to need a refresher.\n\nI ordered the MISO RAMEN, $7.95, which is noodles in a soy bean paste broth, topped with two slices of chashu pork, wakame (seaweed), negi (green onion), bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and corn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saiwaii-ramen-san-francisco-3?select=FccMCWg7-EaSEN__d8CofQ#uMueN2GrUcITvippcCpxug).\n\nOkay, so I can't quite shake all of my ramen elitism because Japan is big on hand-pulled noodles. Being a hand-pulled flour noodle fangirl, which are chewier and thicker, I wasn't a big fan of the thin egg noodles served here. But the noodles are firm and not clumpy, the miso soup is flavorful but not overly salty, and the ingredients are plentiful and fresh. Chashu pork was fairly generous for the regular bowl, and not overly fatty. The green onions are always appreciated, and the corn and bamboo shoots were unique additions.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the SPICY GARLIC MISO RAMEN with chashu pork, wakame, negi, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and corn, $9.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saiwaii-ramen-san-francisco-3?select=FccMCWg7-EaSEN__d8CofQ#g-FFnKlj1CGdmbeshmSqdg). Which meant that I didn't try his dish at all. You can choose from mild, regular, and extra spicy...but can you really trust a mild spicy miso!?\n\nWe also ordered the SAIWAII ROLL, which is 6 pieces of spicy tuna and crab topped with spicy scallops for $7.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saiwaii-ramen-san-francisco-3?select=FccMCWg7-EaSEN__d8CofQ#FccMCWg7-EaSEN__d8CofQ). The roll had generous amounts of spicy tuna, and the spicy scallops on top had a pleasant, chewy texture. But, the fish were overpowered by the creamy, mayo-based sauce. Not surprising though.\n\nI can't believe I called myself a hand-pulled flour noodle fangirl...I need some help.", "author": "Adele F."}

When it gets busy it can be a little hard to get the waiters attention but thats with any busy restaurant. \n\nI'd definitely recommend the spicy garlic tonkatsu ramen. If you dont like spicy then get mild!! The regular is ridiculously spicy! ( I can't handle spicy things so maybe im exaggerating LOL) Anyway, this is by far my favorite ramen in the city! I add corn and more meat because it only comes with two slices of cha su. (don't know if i spelled that correctly.. sorry!) The portions they give are a good amount and will make you full. I can barely finish the bowl on my own.\n\nI've also tried the california roll and the spicy tuna roll. Both are pretty basic and not bad if you're craving either roll. They're a little small but pretty tasty. \n\nOverall this is a great place to go for ramen. Plenty of parking nearby and the food is sooo good !", "author": "Kelly S."}

They do close for lunch, so be sure you check the schedule so you don't get confused when you get there and they are closed.  The restaurant is small, so there may be a wait.\n\nI like how they always serve tea when we sit down.  I love the flavor of the tea and especially great on a cold day especially since its often cold in San Francisco.  I had the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen with an addition of the Unagi Donburi.  I love the flavor of the ramen and it really hits the spot when craving ramen.  It had the right amount of flavor and it was pretty good.  I was hoping that the noodles would be a bit more chewy because it seemed like it was just a bit soggy.  I love the small donburi that came with it since I love unagi.  \n\nDefinitely will be coming back if I was craving ramen while in the area.", "author": "Teresa W."}

I ordered the spicy garlic tonkotsu ramen with chicken karaage. I was initially disappointed when they forgot the karaage as an extra topping and gave me a spicy rather than the regular level of spiciness for the broth. \n\nAfter initially sweating it out, I started to enjoy it more and more. It was a good kind of pain that left my lips tingling. My capsaicin receptors rejoiced as they became saturated. The broth itself was super spicy, but it had a rich, bold flavor. The noodles were ever so-slightly undercooked, just the way I like them. Everything turned out well since my karaage was added on the side and stayed crispy instead of turning soggy in the broth. \n\nThere was room for improvement with the cha-shu, which was mostly fatty and lacked any meat or flavor. I found two tiny pieces total. The agedashi tofu was lackluster. It either wasn't fried properly or sat way too long it the broth, which was bland.

Saiwaii is no exception. Most seem to have the same spicy miso broth, or garlic broth, or pork belly ....etc. My order tasted like it could have come from any other ramen place.\n\nThis little ramen joint is snuggled in the busy part of Sunset, on Irving St. Thumbs up for location, thumbs down for availability of parking. The service was very good. Friendly young ladies greet you immediately in Japanese fashion, and we were quicky seated. The place isn't big, so there's a a  chance you 'll be snuggled up next to a stranger. \n\nMy spicy miso broth (regular heat) was good, but nothing extraordinary. The pork belly was a \"melt in your mouth\" tender, but the pieces were lacking. Did it just melt in to the broth? Being regular spicy, I could not detect any heat. \n\nMy friend's extra spicy was indeed spicy, judging from the sweat-fest off his forehead, But he also said the actual flavor of the broth was covered by whatever they added to make it extra spicy. \n\nOverall, if you're close to the area, this would be a good, convenient place (assuming you find parking) to get your ramen fix.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Hisago on Geary Blvd. They seating is more spread out, feels more spacious and my ramen came with a generous porion of charred, lean pork. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/hisago-san-francisco?hrid=Y_rg_u1F36HdHRxLGTD8HQ", "author": "James L."}

(Well, it's practically the only ramen place other than Izakaya Sozai eight blocks up.) The restaurant is very cramped, and if there's a long line, there's only room for two to three people to wait inside. Otherwise, expect to wait outside.\n\nThe restaurant offers a lot of small appetizers, portioned well for two people. I always order their bacon wrapped scallops. They are yummy! Although there's nothing particularly unique about it, you must admit anything wrapped in bacon is delicious. The salmon belly nigiri is great as well. The rice ball holds together nicely and the salmon is very fresh. But unfortunately, they have appetizers I will never order again, such as their chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, and chicken skin. They were all very burnt, dry, and overall, not enjoyable.\n\nBut, this place specializes in ramen so, of course, I always order their tonkotsu ramen! The broth is nice and creamy, not very oily either. The noodles have a nice firm texture. They give plenty of seaweed and the one small but delicious chasu slice has an amazing \"melt in your mouth\" consistency. I prefer the regular tonkotsu over the spicy garlic one because with the spicy one, I barely taste the broth, even when I ask for it to be mild. Their miso ramen is tasty as well and not overloaded with bean sprouts, which is a definite high point since most restaurants typically use them as filler. And I have yet to try their spicy mala ramen.\n\nThe service is hit or miss; sometimes they're very attentive and friendly, but other times, ehh... It also really depends on how busy the place is. But regardless of service, I will continue to dine at Saiwaii Ramen whenever I crave ramen on a chilly night.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

And my friends and I were craving a big steamy bowl of ramen, so why not go to a highly-rated ramen house in the heart of a district known for great Japanese eats? \n\nFirst off, I'm glad we had a reservation because this place is tiny. It's even smaller when it's packed full of people like on this particular Wednesday night. We barely made it inside and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with some other guests who were also waiting patiently. This was made more challenging by other patrons entering and leaving, and I'm sure that if we didn't have a reservation I might not have as high of an opinion of this place. We were seated quickly though and promptly began out feast. \n\nNot in the mood to be too adventurous, I went with what seems to be their most popular option: the spicy garlic tonakatsu ramen, complete with some fresh herbs, a lot of noodles, an egg and two slices of pork. The star of this dish is the savory broth, of which I wish there was more. I could eat a bowl of the broth on its own and was saddened that this dish was far less broth and far more noodle oriented than my favorite ramen houses in Sacramento. Another negative was the pork, which was in my estimation about 95% fat. The fat might do wonders in enhancing the flavor of the broth, but there was no meat whatsoever. \n\nI will take into consideration that on a busy night (which seems to be every night here), the poor chef in back is pumping these tasty creations out like an assembly line and probably doesn't have time to analyze the fat-to-meat or noodle-to-broth ratio. Still, it's what makes ramen wonderful in my opinion. Either way, I'll be happy to give it another shot the next time I'm in SF on a blustery night.", "author": "Alex L."}

The chirashi was alright, I've definitely had better. The fish didn't seem super fresh, but it was decent. At least I didn't get sick. The variety of fish was your typical tuna, salmon, hamachi, etc. No special sashimi pieces. Size was perfect for me (I've seen bigger chirashi bowls), but you might need to order something else if you're really hungry (I wasn't that hungry).\n\nSecond time around, I learned from my mistake and ordered ramen. I got the spicy garlic tonkotsu, extra spicy with an egg. What I like about it was the spiciness. Now I LOVE SPICY and everytime I order a spicy tonkotsu, it's never spicy enough for me. I usually have to add the chili seasoning and chili oil provided. However, the extra spicy was perfect!!! I didn't have to add anything to it. Some might not like the extra spicy because the spiciness can overpower the actual flavor of the tonkotsu. I tried a sip of my bf's tonkotsu and it was pretty flavorful. The ramen noodles weren't that impressive though. Not very al dente, but at least they weren't soggy. They still had a little bit of chewiness to it, but not that nice crunch you can get from better ramen places. They give you a decent amount of toppings. I definitely had chashu pieces remaining after I finished my noodles. Their chashu was decent, not outstanding. Now, I ordered an egg in addition to my ramen. They precut it in half for you, I tend to like mine whole. When it came out, it looked perfectly soft boiled so I went ahead and ate one half immediately before the hot soup overcooks it. When I bit into it, it was cold which I never experienced before, but I love that runny egg yolk so I didn't mind too much. I let the other half warm up a bit more in the broth so it wasn't cold, but the yolk cooked a bit more.\n\nService was decent, your average asian service. The service was real fast. The bowls of ramen appeared before us before we knew it. There was no line both times I've been here and they greet with you a Japanese greeting which is nice (probably because their service is pretty fast). The place isn't that big either, seating can get a bit crowded.\n\nThey have a nice variety of ramen too and flavors I haven't had before like mala which I do want to try next time. They also have lunch specials where you can get a roll for an additional $2 during weekdays. For me, the ramen was enough (perfect sized bowl). It left me full but not overstuffed, if I got a roll too, I would have been too full and would have probably passed out after.\n\nPrices are decent $8-$11 for a bowl of ramen. Those special flavor ramens cost a bit more, the spicy garlic tonkotsu was $10.45.\n\nOf course it's located in sunset district so parking can be tough depending on the time and day. Both times I've been here finding parking has been easy to find. (late night around 9pm or weekdays around 2 pm). You do have to pay meter during work hours.\n\nThere's better ramen places, but they always have a line. So I'll definitely be back for some quick decent ramen close by.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Very delicate, unlike the many other fatty renditions I have tried. \n\nI may have not noticed, but I wish there was an option to add some kotteri as this tonkotsu lacks the fatty richness one usually encounters. This can be a pro or a con depending on your taste buds. \n\nSaiwaii bowls seemed to be a bit smaller than other places, considering I actually finished the entire bowl, plus a basic roll, and an unagi don. Curly noodles are served here, which I found to have a good texture. \n\nHigh quality is the M.O. here. \n\nThe miso ramen was extremely delicate and floral - almost ladylike.

On a Friday or weekend night you can expect to scribble your name on the whiteboard wait list, and proceed to keenly stare down the diners happily grubbing on ramen on your future table. The harder you stare, the faster the table becomes yours. It's a proven restaurant goer fact. It's worth the wait -- the food is all kinds of awesome. It's hot, savory, flavorful, consistent, unique and exciting. If we're talking ramen, this has become my go-to ramen feeding nest. The tonkatsu and miso persuasions are a sure-fire way to soupy bliss, add an egg and drizzle chili oil on there for added gastro-success.  \n\nFor you investigators who prefer a concise list to an oozing paragraph, feast your eyes:\n\nItems that are not to miss: \n\n- Tonkatsu or miso ramen \n- Mango Tango roll \n- Gyoza (the sauce is practically drinkable). \n- 49er roll (those lemon slices....) \n- Paradise roll (The PILE of delicious fried onion bits on top is practically genius). \n- Salmon skin salad \n\nI'm salivating all over my keyboard so maybe it's best that you just head over and give it a try.

Families bring their small children, so, it can be very very very nosy.\nThe wait staff is always busy and efficient. \nI highly recommend you review the menu before you are seated in order to place one's order quickly. \n\nThe ramen at Sawaii is far better than any ramen place I have ever visited in Japantown.\nThe spicy ramen is sufficiently spicy to give me pause (which means they are doing it right!).\nAlso, the ramen presentation is always so lovely aesthetically, well balanced, and composed gracefully.

Tough, chewy (in a bad way), and bland. Meh.\n\nNoodles were just as chewy (in a good way) as last time (I specified firm, which threw the waitress for a loop) and they also seemed to be more generous with the toppings of seaweed, bamboo, wood-ear mushrooms, and green onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=n85j9sz86778Z165xQfSPw).\n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=u1qMizhHw3UAUDxApzgkDw) tasted pretty good except for one thing . . . it tasted more like Tekkamaki (http://www.bento.com.sg/uploads/products/91/_MG_4728.JPG) that is to say, NON-spicy tuna.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-17", "description": "Sawaii has always been one of my favorite spots for ramen in the city and especially in the Sunset district. I can't speak to the sushi really but if you're looking for ramen on a typical gloomy/foggy/cloudy evening meal that'll satisfy your ramen cravings, this is a great place to do so! I love their broth here and the quality of the noodles. There are a ton of items you can add to your ramen to either spice things up or add more flavor.\n\nI love their spicy tonkatsu broths here - both the Spicy Garlic Tonkatsu and Spicy Miso Tonkatsu Ramen specials are delicious! I'd say the Regular Spicy usually does does the trick for me - I'd say it comes close to a typical \"Korean spice\" level for those of you who can handle typical Asian dishes with a good kick to them. The portions are quite generous here and the ramen usually comes with two good sized portions of cha sui (pork loin most often) and your various veggie additions (seaweed, bamboo shoots, garlic, among other items). The broth stands out with its milky, creamy, and flavorful consistency. Bowls go for about $9-11 since I last went back in Fall 2014. For those of you looking for a starter, I highly recommend the Soft Shell Crab - made fresh and every bite is as delicious as it sounds. Once again, I can't really speak to the sushi, so I'll leave that up to you to decide.\n\nWait times aren't horrible although I'd say you can expect a 30 minute wait for three to four people. I don't recommend a group larger than that since the place is pretty small (although table turnover is relatively quick). Then again worse case scenario, it's an excuse to grab a quick boba...just saying. Flat screen TVs on either side of the restaurant allows you to catch up the Giants game and/or other sporting event of the day! Staff here is super friendly which is also of course a plus.\n\nAll in all, a great ramen spot and one of the few specializing in ramen on Irving aside from Izakaya Sozai.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "***Solid 3.5 stars***\n\nSaiwaii is my go-to ramen place in the Sunset.  If you don't mind fighting old Asian men for narrow angled parking spots on Irving Street, Saiwaii could become your go-to place for ramen also.  I've been to Saiwaii at least a dozen times, and it always delivers, figuratively speaking.  \n\nThe place itself is as crowded as Irving Street on a Saturday.  The waiting area is barely big enough for 3 adults, which means that you'll probably have to stand outside.  Otherwise, be prepared to dodge the opening and closing doors, while getting evil glances from the waitstaff and the patrons.  The restaurant itself is very small, so you might have to rub elbows with your neighbors.  Last time I went there, I was talking to a young couple at the table next to me.  It's very tough to eat ramen gracefully; it's even tougher to have a conversation with strangers while slurping your noodles.\n\nI always go for the spicy garlic tonkotsu ($10.45), and I ask for them to make it extra spicy.  It's a big bowl of ramen with a couple of slices of pork, bamboo shoots, crispy seaweed and a bunch of other goodies.  \"Extra spicy\" has a lot of chili powder, but you can adjust the spiciness level according to your tolerance levels.  Also, there's chili powder on the table for that extra kick, should you ever need it.  I always add the pork belly ($3.50), which is not as fatty as it is at some other ramen places and corn ($1).  I love corn, so I add it to everything, but it really complements my ramen.  \n\nThe two women working there as servers are all business.  They could be a bit less than friendly, but it's hard to blame them.  They run around and bus their own tables, so there is little time to smile.  Sometimes it seems as though they ignore you while you are waiting for a table, but that's only because they are.  I was surprised at first, but now I kinda expect it.

My friends and I visit this joint in-between our breaks for class periods to grab a bite of ramen before our next class starts. It's really delicious ramen for a really good deal. Especially during the lunch hours. I probably visit Sawaii maybe once every other week. \n\nI've tried just about every ramen on the menu and I love them all. My all time favorite is the Shoyu Ramen. The noodles are cooked so that they are still a little hard and not too soft so that the broth softens them while you're eating. Although, the meat is a little lacking. The meat is good, but it's comprised of mostly fat than it is meat. Nonetheless, still good. Service is pretty fast and generally the waitress who always works there has treated us with nothing less than kindness. Although, it tends to get busy during lunch hours sometimes, but not always. \n\nHighly recommend trying Sawaii Ramen out!", "author": "Jessica X."}

That's what they're famous for here, and it's worth it. They make this very well, and although after awhile you can \"graduate\" to one of their other flavors, this is definitely worth it. I think this one deserves to be on the 7x7 top 100 in SF!\n\nIF THIS IS A REPEAT VISIT:\n\nTry one of their other ramens if you don't want/need such a flavorful burst/spiciness. I'm personally very partial to their Shio ramen. It's a soup that's delightfully lighter than its tonkatsu cousin, but I think just as savory in its own way. I prefer lighter ramens like Shoyu and Shio as opposed to Tonkatsu and Miso, so this works out great for me. \n\nTheir Shoyu has been solid, but I'm starting to prefer the Shio more and more. They're both on the lighter side (as above). Miso is good, but not fantastic. It comes with quite a quantity of corn (haha), so you'll be fishing for corn at the bottom of your broth after you're done. If you enjoy just the tonkatsu flavor, their non-spicy version is still very good :)\n\nThe pork on top of the ramen is very good in a non-pretentious way, which I thought was really commendable. In the era where \"novelty\" and \"designer\" chashus and pork bellies are being blown out of proportion by ramen joints, the simplicity of Saiwaii's ramen is great.\n\nAs for your side sushi, I recommend the salmon avocado and the spicy tuna. I've actually never had their CA roll here, because who gets a CA roll when you can get a fish maki? :P The spicy tuna is quite spicy, but strangely addicting. Salmon avo is always great :)\n\nThe bill will come out to be just under 11 dollars including tax (not for the spicy tonkatsu), and you will leave with a full belly and a happy smile. :)\n\nKeep up the good work Saiwaii!\n\nps.

I can tell when a serving size is too marginal.  Let me give a few examples.  My girlfriend, Bun, who is significantly smaller than me says the serving size is kind of small, it tells you something.  If the skinny Asian dude (weighing a buck twenty at most) on my right at the table next to us asks for extra noodles, it tells you something.  If you're wondering, it was not Kobayashi, the former hot dog eating champion.  Hate to start off on a bad note, but it gets better (Better to an extent at least).   \n\nSawaii's interior has a very stern and modern look.  The only thing missing is a water fountain or some kind of flowing water.  For some reason, I can imagine that.  There's one television hanging inside; it was on mute, and I didn't pay much attention to it as it ran.  Serving ramen, sushi, some rolls, a small variety of appetizers, and a few yakitori, the menu is very straight forward.  They have combinations with their ramen and add that extra punch to fill you up.    \n\nThe spicy garlic tonkotsu is the best here; while not really spicy, there's a touch of creaminess to the broth.  I tried the shio last visit, and it was bland.  By far was it from great.  Bun usually orders miso everywhere, her selection was no different.  I took a sampling of the broth and it was OK.  It tasted like miso at least.  I would have to order it to judge fully.  With the spicy garlic tonkotsu obviously on top, the extremity of taste ranking between the spicy garlic tonkotsu and any other choice so far is a drastic one.  The second best is probably the spicy garlic miso (go figure).\n\nMy suggestion, order the spicy garlic tonkotsu and close the menu.  Final answer!  Shouldn't even be a choice.  Get the extra noodles, save yourself the late night hunger pains.  Looking for a small bite to add to your order, the hand crafted gyoza was a pleasant treat and grilled with a nice balance.  Served with a dipping sauce, yet was delicious without it also.  Enjoy your spicy garlic tonkotsu, because that's the way to go here.  Trust me.", "author": "Arnold T."}

You can order this at three different spicy levels; I got the regular and was pawing for more tea.

Of course we ordered the Spicy Garlic ramen, and goodness! Was it spicy. We opted for the mild version and we're spicy kind of people! But, too spicy and you lose the flavor of the beautiful broth. I'll start with what I liked least about my dish, the noodles. In Japan the noodles are slightly thicker and there are few of them, so of course in this sense it has been Americanized. All together that was the ONLY complaint I had about my ramen. \n\nNow, on to the good stuff. THAT BROTH. Any ramen lover knows the importance of a good broth. Creamy, slightly thick but not soup altering thick, and of course the add ins were helpful. This broth is the best one I've had in America yet! On to the fixin's. What comes with the ramen is traditional. Seaweed, roasted garlic, mushroom type paste incorporated, pork, and welsh green onions. While the pork that came with my ramen wasn't my favorite, it also wasn't the worst. ( I saw a man eating the pork belly with the ramen and that looked fantastic! ) I had to add an egg. Why? Because it's ramen! It was perfectly cooked. \n\nAll in all this ramen joint rocks and I'm sad that the rating on here isn't better.

But tbh, I didn't think \"regular\" spicy was very spicy at all, so if you think you're tough, go for \"extra\" spicy.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall mom n pop kind of place, so don't come if you expect to be waited on hand and foot. The wait can be a while, especially if a large group decides to idle and chat for a long time, occupying the limited number of seats.  The waiters (possibly related to said mom n pop) are a bit understaffed and hard to get ahold of during busy hours. But you're not here for service, you're here for RAMEN.  You can order tonkatsu (pork), miso, shoyu (soy sauce), or shio (salt) for about $8 and add stuff for extra, but what you really should do is pay the extra couple dollars it costs to get spicy garlic tonkatsu. The broth, as compared to that of an undistinguished ramen joint, has the creamy, almost silken quality that marks good broth, and the spicy oil - miraculously lacking in the heavy greasiness of most oily broths - adds an edge that really opens your palate to the rich flavor. Ingredients are all plentiful, fresh, and well-prepared, notably the noodles and the broth. Sodium is on the heavy side, so stay hydrated with water, the complimentary tea, or alcohol of your choice. If you're a real sucker for fatty richness, adding pork belly is melt-in-your-mouth heaven. And last but certainly not least least add egg! Soft-boiled perfection. Everything else on the menu (and on other tables) looked meh. Maybe the agedashi tofu? But spicy garlic tonkatsu, no excuses.", "author": "Emily Z."}

It's also sparked lots of debates about which one is \"Best!\" After years of travelling around, trying different places, and reading lots of reviews, I've concluded that ramen is a very personal and subjective topic, and people definitely have their favorites. For me, that's Dojo in San Mateo, but that brings me to my point: excellent ramen is excellent ramen; which one you think is best is up to you. \n\nAll that said, Saiwaii is definitely one of my new favorites. I got the spicy garlic ramen (I love spicy and I love garlic!). The broth was flavorful (though quite salty), not overly oily, and the ramen noodles had great texture. The soft cooked egg was cooked perfectly, and the other toppings were generous and tasty. Portion size was generous, and I needed nothing other than a large Asahi to complete the meal. Of course, I disregarded that piece of advice and also ordered the chicken karaage, which was crispy, hot, and delicious.\n\nGive it a shot, you'll not be disappointed!", "author": "Terry N."}

It's lucky that we got this table, because the place is pretty small and everyone that came right after us had to wait for a bit.  When I say small, I mean it.  Our table was touching the next table and it is really cramped in there.  We were quickly seated and given menus.  I ordered:\n\nTonkatsu ramen ($7.95): flavorful, rich broth, topped with 2 thin pieces of cha-shui, bamboo shoots, seaweed, green onion, and mushroom.  The broth was quite tasty and I drank the most of it.  The cha-shui was good, but I wish there was at least one more slice.  The noodles are a bit more al dente than I am used to, but they were good still.  The portion was good as well.  They have a whole list of toppings you can add in: corn, pork belly cubes, half egg, etc.- each for a price.  Toppings are tempting to add in, but this can really make your ramen add up in price quickly.  \n\nOverall, it was rather good and a solid option for when I'm craving ramen.  My friends each tried a different ramen and each of them were satisfied with their dish.  The service was helpful and prompt.  The waitress came by to refill our waters about 3 times.  The ramen is very fairly priced- and they even have sushi or donburi options as well.  I don't think I'd want to wait around for the ramen, but it is pretty tasty and I'd say it's worth a try. \n\nNotes:\n-Add extra ramen for $2 if you have a larger appetite!\n-Parking in the area may be difficult, depending on the time.  Usually it's manageable.\n-Sign-in on the whiteboard to put your name down for a table.", "author": "Samantha L."}

I live in SOMA and the only ramen around there is Katana-Ya, which is in one word: overrated. I guess that place benefits from its proximity to downtown, as well as it being the only ramen place in the area. \n\nSince discovering Saiwaii a couple weeks ago, I've driven 30 mins across town at least 5x to eat the ramen, NYAM NYAM. You must add the pork belly, and perhaps extra noodles if you are hella hungie. I always get the spicy garlic tonkatsu flavor, which is not that spicy, somewhat oily, but packed full of flavor. If you add the pork belly, you also get tonkatsu, equating to a favorable mea t: other stuff ratio in the bowl. The soup is also so delish that i drink it all and clean the bowl, erry time O_O!~\n\n.....except for the last one. Went on a sunday afternoon instead of a weeknight. For some reason, fat was the theme of the day. My pork belly was 90% fat, such that I barely ate any of it. Interestingly enough, by the time i was done eating, most of the fat had disappeared. I guess it melted into the soup and I eated dat shit anways, X_X!~ That was sad, but the tonkatsu was also ~50% fat.

I got the garlic tonkatsu, and the bowl was smaller than I expected.  The flavor and everything was fine, just nothing outstanding.

I have eaten here several times since the restaurant opened.  I typically order the same items, agadashi tofu, fried chicken cartilage and spicy garlic tonkatsu ramen.  Over the past few months the quality and consistency has slipped greatly to the point I will not go back.  I can only assume there is cost cutting to be quite honest because:\n\n1.  The fried chicken cartilage USED to come with a bowl full of just that and it was crunchy, hot and delicious.  The past two times have been complete opposite.  Half the bowl is now filled with salad like vegetation and the other half with chicken cartilage.  On one of the two recent visits I had a two inch piece of cardboard surprise!  It was greasy soggy on that occasion and overly fried on the other.\n\n2.  The ramen noodles have changed!!!  They are dense spaghetti like noodles now no longer the softer chewy traditional ramen.  The new noodles now have an Italian pasta type texture.  Two of the waiters also confirmed the noodles have changed when asked.  Extremely disappointing!!  \n\n3.  Beef tongue izakaya style is quite rubbery and chewy the last two times I have ordered it as well.\n\nOn the plus which is why I gave two stars, the ramen broth is still better than a majority of ramen places in the city.

I lived in Japan for nearly 3 years and while there spent a couple months working in a ramen shop, making tonkotsu soup from scratch at 7am, so there is my preface. \n\nSawaii Ramen has very cheap lunch deals and when I went I got a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with a tuna roll for around $10. The soup was obviously from some sort of prepared stock or instant paste, definitely not made from scratch. It was thin and lacked the deep rich taste that makes good tonkotsu so amazing. The chashu was plentiful but was tough and dry. The noodles were decent, about what you would expect from an American ramen shop, but nothing amazing. Overall the ramen was pretty poor, not awful  but definitely not up to par with a real bowl of tonkotsu. If you have never tried real ramen or just have a really bad craving it will certainly scratch the itch, but please don't think this is anywhere near as good as ramen can really be. \n\nPS the sushi was average low grade fish, basically just a throw in with the ramen.

My overall impression is that the quality of food has been consistently declining.\n\nI recall when I first visited Saiwaii (probably in 2011) I walked away impressed with the flavor of the broth, toppings and noodle. The next couple of times I walked away feeling happy being fed, but indifferent to the ramen itself.\n\nToday, came for lunch and opted for a bowl of Miso ramen with a small bowl of unagi don. So, the Miso ramen comes with ONE slice of chasu pork, and various veggie toppings. I was shocked when my bowl arrived, that the ONE chasu pork slice sitting in my bowl comprised of 95% fat. Yes. FAT. :(\n\nI would have sucked it up if there were more protein toppings in the bowl. However, considering that the one 'chasu' aka fat slice would really yield me one small bite of actual edible lean meat, I had to speak to the server. When I asked about the fat slice, I was told that that's how the meat arrived from their supplier - that sometimes they come very lean, and other times, not so much. That is all?? So disappointing!\n\nI ended up peeling away the fat and slowly savored my ONE bite of small chasu piece, wishing for more. May I add that the unagi rice bowl was pretty underwhelming as well. The 2 thin unagi pieces lacked flavor and wasn't really too meaty. I definitely don't think it was worth the $4 price tag.\n\nWish I had a better meal.

The pork belly though fatty is delicious, it melts right in your mouth and there is enough fixin's of seaweed and bamboo to go around in every bite.\n\n\n*NOTE! the cons!\n\nI do however think $1 for additional toppings is a bit much especially because some toppings def don't add up to that amount. I didn't get it but butter as a topping for $1 more that's kinda nuts!\n\nAlso, there are no vegetarian options, so it sucks that I would not be going here with my boyfriend. They definitely should try and have one ramen dish or at least featured vegetarian once a week or something.\n\nThe other thing is I have noticed a long sitting wait for food. The second time I didn't get a roll and it we waited 40 minutes for just our bowls or ramen. we were maybe the third party of two to arrive since they just opened for dinner. \n\n~~~\nOverall though, I thought they were very nice, lots of water refills and checking in on us if we needed anything.

Some good comments here and there about not having to go down to Santa (in San Mateo) or other great ramen spots in the south bay. No more long drives to get my ramen fix, ya know. I was excited to know that there is a good ramen place located close by.\n\nI went there with my Mom and Sis on a chilly rainy day. No better time for a nice hot bowl of soup made of pig juices and meat, yummy toppings, and oodles of noodles. Nice place, clean, kinda cozy, nice waitress. There's even anime playing. The menu has good selections, as it also has sushi or donburi if you like, though ramen is the main thing there of course.\n\nThe ramen. It was good, solid, but to me...just O-K. Nothing more, nothing less. I dunno, I just didn't taste \"it\" when you sip that nice pork broth. When I think of ramen, I think of all the love that goes into it. The hours and hours and hours of boiling the piggy parts with other ingredients to get that nice taste in the soup. I like to see at least a little oil blotches floating in the soup. Some sort of slight weight in the soup. With this place, I didn't see any, nor did I taste anything special.\n\nMind you that I am not bashing this place. It's a good place for ramen, and I'll probably go here every once in awhile. But I'm just saying that I had much much better. I just wasn't impressed is all.\n\nWhat is cool is that you can add things that I have not seen at other ramen places, such as the duck. Kudos for that. Kudos also for the noodles...this place does it the way I like..aldente.\n\nWhat I ordered: typical chasu with the miso base. I added the miso duck and corn.

I wanted to see for myself what this place was all about.\n\nIt's rare to find a ramen shop in the Sunset so I didn't have high expectations, but am super happy that it's something different from the usual Chinese restaurants on Irving.\n\nIt looks small and not that inviting on the outside (but that's the entire block), but it's really warm and cozy inside.  Nice wooden decor, big flat screen tv in front of the kitchen.  \n\nWe sat two tables back from the TV and it was the perfect spot to watch the Giants game (I'm an A's fan, but I got love for the Bay!).\n\nOur server was really nice and attentive.\n\nWe ordered the grilled Ika, gyoza, EXTRA spicy garlic miso, tonkatsu, and one miso with extra half egg.\n\nI LOVED the Ika!  It was smaller than I'm use to seeing at izakayas, but none the less still better than my last experience at Ippuku in Berkeley.  It had a perfect char flavor, and was not over or under cooked.  It was served with a side of fresh grounded ginger and lemon.  I'm not a big fan of ginger, but it went perfectly with the Ika and a squeeze of lemon.\n\nGyoza-I didn't try it, but my friend ate the entire order himself lol\n\nEXTRA Spicy garlic miso ramen-it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be and it was just missing something.  The noodles were curly so I had my suspicions as to whether it was fresh ramen, but nonetheless it had a nice texture.  The broth was so so, but it got better and better as I took each bite.  Finally at the end I felt a wave of spice hit me.  I guess I should have mixed my ramen first instead of digging in right away (I was really hungry!).\n\nTonkatsu broth-it was ok, it could be richer. \n\nMiso-It was ok.  But my friends mom said it was too salty for her.  I told her that it's just the way ramen is.  In Japan it's even saltier!\n\n*for side of egg, it's only half an egg so that was kind of a bummer :(\n\nOverall the experience was 4 stars, decor 4 stars, service 5 stars, food 3.5 stars because I know the broth can be better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-16", "description": "I've wanted to try Saiwaii for a couple of weeks now, but each time I drove by, there seemed to be some sort of line or group waiitng out in front!  Normally, I don't have a problem waiting in line for a place, but admittedly, it's a little harder when it's frigid cold out here in the Sunset.  In other parts of the city, it gets warm, but it doesn't happen all that often out this way.  Generally, we have rainy/foggy, cold, and colder.  It's actually not that bad, and I like it at times...provided that I'm not standing in place for too long.\n\nFinally ended up coming here last night for a late dinner with my coworker though, and it was de-licious!  Their menu looks somewhat modest at a glance, but they actually have a lot crammed in there - ramen, appetizers, donbori, and sushi.  On a related sidenote: agree that it seems there are a lot of tables squeezed in (which makes me wonder if those were lines I saw or just people loitering), but I've seen worse.  A LOT worse.\n\nAs for the ramen, you actually have the choice of four basic types, each with a different type of broth (shoyu, miso, shio, and tonkatsu).  However, they also have a list of assorted items you can also add to make your ramen just like how you want it (half an egg, pork belly, etc).  I opted for the tonkatsu ramen since I don't see that broth on menus as often as the others, and my coworker did the same but with half an egg in hers.  I thought the broth was really good...not really greasy or overly salty, yet flavorful.  To me, that was the best part of it...the noodles are fresh, and I liked all of the ingredients, but the broth won me over.  The only knock I can find is that the meat is slightly dry, but not something I would hold against them in particular.  It's bound to happen any where if you let the meat sit in the hot broth too long, so it's not something unique to just this place.  Sidenote II: Heard they tweaked their ramen recipe since they first opened, so if you've been already and are reading this, might want to try it again...\n\nFeeling pretty hungry, I decided to make it a combo by adding a mini unagi don for another $3.  I thought it would mean getting a smaller ramen, but I was wrong.  Their bowl of ramen is pretty generous by itself, so my unagi don was completely unnecessary (other than making me look like I eat a ton).  The unagi don came in a neat little bowl (for some reason, I really liked it), filled with a good sized piece of unagi, sauce and rice, with a bit of ginger on the side.  The unagi was cooked perfectly for me, and I didn't notice any of those thorny bones you tend to find.  There's maybe a little too much rice, but for $3 it's worth it if you're pretty hungry.\n\nService was great, as not just one person tended to our table and they were always on top of filling our tea cups.  I'll definitely be back...cute and friendly waitresses, tasty tonkatsu broth, close proximity to home, and a load of options to add into my ramen?  Why yes, I would like some more...thanks Saiwaii!", "author": "Mike L."}

I should have made new friends this way but I was way too annoyed to even begin to think about anything but \"GET ME OUT OF HERE!!\"\n\nA regular bowl of ramen is $8. If you add an egg, that's an extra dollar. If you add pork belly, that's an extra $3. if you add corn, there's another dollar out of your pocket.

Here's the order our meal came in:\n\nKaraage, sushi, ramen, ramen, fried oysters. Huh? Everything arrived fairly quickly and out of order, which was a little strange. \n\nThe karaage was definitely over breaded with flour instead of panko and the first piece I bit into had a temperature of \"warm\" or \"cooling off\", which was really disappointing. Subsequent pieces tasted hot off the deep fryer, but I couldn't help but notice that every piece was undercooked and was very pink on the inside. I'd probably skip the karaage next time and just go to Quickly a few doors down for some popcorn chicken.\n\nThe oysters were tasty and consisted of four pieces -- less than we expected for the price paid. Breading on the fried oysters was definitely better than on the karaage.\n\nSushi was alright, nothing stood out.\n\nThe ramen was OK. I had the Spicy Garlic Tonkotsu and my girlfriend had the regular Tonkotsu. Though mine was ordered 'mild', I really couldn't taste anything in my broth other than garlic and spices. My girlfriend's, on the other hand, was rich with bone marrow. She wasn't a fan of the garlic taste in her broth, however.\n\nThe eggs were completely overcooked for my taste. I usually expect eggs with my ramen to be softboiled, the way Orenchi makes them. Here? Not so much. Definitely hardboiled here.\n\nThe pork in our ramen was thinly sliced (love it), but was very slippery and fatty (felt like fatty bacon slices, not good). Noodles are a bit thin for my liking, but to be fair I've had much thinner ramen noodles at other places before.\n\nWe live in the Inner Sunset just a few minutes' walk (or just about a minute's drive) from this place.

The owner's lovely wife came to the restaurant specifically to look after us and to oversee our meal. The chef, Yo-san, came by a few times to see if our food was fine. Actually, I was a bit embarrassed by the extra attention lavished on us. But this just goes to show that they pay attention to what their customers are saying and that they take a proactive approach to correct operational mistakes.\n\nNow on to the food: had the spicy garlic miso ramen. It was apparently well-prepared, had depth of flavor and, very important to me, no MSG. (I didn't feel thirsty or woozy after the meal.) The noodles were good, but I prefer mine on the al dente side. But very tasty and sizable portion. \n\nHowever, where they shined were in their appetizers. I really enjoyed the succulent chicken karaage, the seaweed (?) with fish cake and something they had just concocted that evening - unagi wrapped in pastry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-24", "description": "3.5 Stars seems spot on for this place. \n\nFirst the ambiance - It's another one of those crowded tiny SF places with communal seating. There are 3 sets of tables that can seat 6, 1 set for a couple, then a long table that can fit maybe 10. \n\nNow the food:\n\n- Shoyu Ramen w/egg - I wanted something lighter than tonkotsu so I went with Shoyu. The noodles itself was chewy and good. The Chashu pieces were buttery and delicious, but a bit overwhelming after a while. Lots and lots of fat. The broth was good, but too \"deep\". I was expecting something a bit more clear and refreshing, but it felt a bit too heavy for shoyu.\n\n- Tonkotsu ramen w/egg and pork cubes - Unless you just really love pork fat, I would recommend against this. Not only if the broth super fatty (but pretty good) the chashu is also fatty and the pork cubes are EVEN FATTIER. On top of that, they are marinated with a sweet flavor which kind of throws off all the other flavors. I know it looks good in pictures but I thought these were way too rich considering all the ramen already come with super rich chashu. \n\n-Chicken Karaage - Standard chicken karaage. Good. For comparison, Himawari's in San Mateo was better though.\n\n- Add on small Unagi don - Disappointment. In the pictures they look like http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saiwaii-ramen-san-francisco-3?select=VfF1fmlw6gF6r-P4UmQGbA#An46_qfa37VN0-XmSoGBEQ, but what I got was little filets that they probably use for unagi sushi. If that was the case, i would have just gotten the unagi sushi since it's cheaper. The texture and taste was all off and I felt jipped. I don't know if it's a fluke since all the other yelp pictures on here look like how it should look, but that is not what I got. \n\nOverall the meal was pretty good but left a bit to be desired. I think with time they can become one of the better ramen joints in the city.", "author": "Julie K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-01", "description": "Pretty disappointed with the ramen here. I ordered the Tonkatsu, and tried the Spicy garlic Tonkatsu broths. The tonkatsu broth had a really strong pork smell/flavor, but not the good kind. It wasn't the kind that was full of flavor, rather it was like a stinch of pork broth that maybe was from not so good meat, or had been sitting out for a while and reheated. The spicy garlic tonkatsu wasn't much better, was the same thing with a garlic flavor and some spice. The noodles were done well, however with the lack of a good solid broth, it didn't help the entire ramen experience.\n\nStrangely, the california roll (that comes with the $10 ramen lunch special) was decent. It had \"real\" crab meat, although it seemed like it was mixed with some imitation crab meat. The spicy tuna cut rolls were just whatevers.\n\nIf you want good ramen, go to Izakaya Sozai... which is down the block.", "author": "Alex R."}

I like that the location is near a bunch of other fun shops, so it gets a retail boost. Short story--ramen here is not bad, other fun things to eat too. \n\nWhile waiting outside for a table for two, I read the article taped to the window. It mentions the American city bastions for good ramen -- Los Angeles, New York...why isn't SF one of them? A good question. Why do most people say \"eh...ramen you say?\" I wish i knew the answer. I've tried to look for good ramen all over the city, but most of the time it falls short of my wildly high expectations. A lot of the tonkotsu broths have that collagen-rich thick flavor to the soup, but they lack a brightness that keeps you wanting to devour more. The same goes for this joint. I tried the regular tonkotsu ramen (maybe different if i had gotten the spicy garlic? may need to return), and it was above average. the pork belly bits were good...but I didn't jump up and exclaim '~uMaaai!'*\n\nThe tempura donburi had an excellently fried up shrimp, though I wish there were more sauce and crisper vegetables. The sushi was alright, not bad, not great. I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood and felt like some hot ramen on a cold day. Still, probably in the mid-to-upper tier of ramen for SF.\n\n*i have this vision of jumping and just yelling \"taaaaaasty\" and drinking up the broth in both hands, but it's probably better that i don't as i would likely burn myself", "author": "Jade L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-26", "description": "Sometimes, just typing in \"food\" on Yelp and going to the closest appetizing restaurant turns out to be the perfect choice. That's exactly what occured to my girlfriend and I as we walked down Irving on a cold, windy night. We both thought some hot ramen would thaw us out from a typical SF night, so we found ourselves here at Saiwaii Ramen. \n\nOn a street crowded with restaurants, Saiwaii actually had a waitlist. That was probably my first sign that Yelp wasn't leading us astray. Didn't have to wait long though, as we were seated within 5 minutes. I ordered myself the Spicy Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen, while my girlfriend got her usual Shio Ramen. Although the wait time for the food was longer than usual, I can excuse them for that since the restaurant was crowded at the time. I'd rather have a well prepared meal, than something hastily prepared and flung out the kitchen. And well prepared it was. It might have just been the cold weather, but I swear I have never seen a bowl of ramen with so much steam pouring out the bowl. The taste itself was amazing. Perfect broth that was not over saturated by spiciness, and some of the tenderest pork that I've had to date. It was literally breaking off of my chopsticks. In comparison to the taste of the many other ramen shops I've been to around the Bay, Sawaii definitely ranks among the top.\n\nThe portion size could be argued as small by some, but for me, it was perfect. I felt that if the portion size were any bigger, then I would have felt overstuffed, and if it were any smaller, then I would have been hungry still. I finished my entire bowl and most of the broth, and I felt just fine afterwards. The service was really nice as well, although everything was a little rushed due to the crowd.\n\nThere are a few negatives though. First off, the front door is heavy, and it slams pretty violently. The first time it happened, I was the one to let go of the door, under the assumption that it would just slowly fall into place. Nope, it crashed. I probably jumped a good foot. Although, the good part is that I got to watch the same exact thing happen to every other person that came into the restaurant that night. Another thing is that since the restaurant itself is small, they have to cramp in as many tables as they can fit, as to accommodate the most amount of people. There was around a foot of space in between our table and the table right next to us, and I had the displeasure of trying to squeeze my way in that gap without bumping tables. I kind of failed at that all night, and I'm just an average sized guy. I'd hate to see how someone a little bigger would manage. \n\nIn all though, it's nice to finally get to try out another ramen place in SF. Good ramen is hard enough to find when looking for it, so for being a random Yelp search, Sawaii turned out to be one of those chance encounters that I won't soon forget.", "author": "Sean H."}

Being spoiled by the better ramen places in San Mateo, I didn't expect much of the ramen here, so I went a different direction and got an unagi-don. \n\nOverall, not impressed at all. First, the portion of the unagi was small, nothing special. And their rice.... can it be any more horrible? It was hard and it didn't taste fresh at all. A ten year old kid could've cooked better rice, I mean, how the hell can you mess up on rice????? \nThey also forgot to give me the miso soup that came with all the donburis, so I had to ask for mine. Also had to grab the waitress once again for a spoon for the miso soup. And honestly, I could've gone without the miso soup altogether. I believe I didn't even drink a whole spoonful.\n\nAll my friends got ramens and they just said their food was average, but hopefully it was better than my donburi. \n\nDefinitely won't see me coming back here again.", "author": "Harriet W."}

FWIW, my regular was just mild, and the extra spicy was just right - not enough to leave a burning sensation throughout the meal.   The bowls only had noodles, \"cha-shu,\" bamboo shoots, green onions, and wood ear fungus - a bit disappointing when other ramen joints are adding eggs and generous helpings of other exotic ingredients (extra side fixings run $1-3).  Sadly, there were no chunks of roasted garlic for that great post-dinner date breath, although I could faintly taste the garlic in the broth.  The slices of \"cha-shu\" were a bit fatty underneath the pork skin and moist, although not very flavorful aside from soaking in the soup.  The bamboo shoots and wood ear fungus gave a nice crunch with the noodles, and the broth flavoring was decent - not too salty.

It's a small little place that serves big bowls of hot broth with noodles and meat and veggies... ;). On a foggy day in the avenues (wait...it's always foggy over there. Even better) go get yourself a hot bowl of ramen. They have other things on the menu too like sushi and some yakitori but the true shiner is the ramen. \n\nOk, some people hear ramen and think of the .50 cent packages of hard noodles that college students supposedly love. NOT! This is the total opposite of that. I get just the plain miso bowl and its so savory and has such an umami flavor. WAIT, did I just use the word \"umami\"? Well it fits for this dish. Never thought I could use that word to its full extent. \n\nEveryone must try this at least once. But don't go there a lot because then it will get too busy and then they wont have room for me to eat! :( like I said its a small place so I hope you don't mind rubbing elbows with your neighbors while you are slurping noodles and splattering broth all over your shirt.", "author": "Lizzie D."}

The place was full which is nice to see and there was maybe 1 or 2 groups in front of us. We were seated pretty quickly despite all of that. It was a cold night so ramen was going to be perfect to warm the soul. I got the spicy miso and my girl got the spicy garlic tonkatsu. I got my broth extra spicy while she got hers normal. I dont' know if this is always the case but it felt like my girls normal broth was spicier than the broth I got purposely more spicy. Maybe I was already a goner from my spice that when I tried hers, my taste buds were compromised. Anywho I like spicy so that is not a problem for me so maybe next time she'll have to order mild. The ramen is cooked well, good broth and the fixings were on point. Very good combination of everything and I ordered mine with extra cha shu which was well cooked and accompanied the ramen and other ingredients perfectly. My girl complained of a stomach ache after eating hers, It just might have been the spice so if you are sensitive to spice you may have stomach issues eating here but I don't so I might have to come solo. lol jk baby.

First impression, the name of the place screams Chinese owned ramen shop. It is on the Chinese side of Irving after all. We sat down and ordered their lunch special where you choose your ramen and a side of sushi roll. I had their spicy garlic tonkotsu and a side of tuna sushi. The sushi arrived first and it was nothing special, the rice tasted like rubber, just like supermarket sushi rolls. Approximately ~5mins later the ramen came. I would give the presentation 4 stars but other than the appearance I'd make better ramen at home because it's exactly what it tasted like, instant ramen. The soup was WAAAAAY too saltly, felt like I was sipping MSG. Tastes like the flavoring packets you find in instant noodles, sorry but I am here for ramen, not instant ramen. The noodles were not al dente, over cooked and NO EGG? Not even half? Seriously? A Chinese owned ramen shop that charges more than a Japanese ramen shop doesn't include a egg? The two thinly slices of meat tastes dry and stale. $13 for a bowl of salty MSG ramen with overcooked noodles and no egg? Wow! This is just another reminder why I never go to any Chinese owned Japanese restaurant. If you're gonna do ramen, focus on ramen and make it the best ramen on the block. Don't spread your menu out and included everything like sushi, rolls and yakitori. This \"ramen shop\" tries to do everything but in the end gets nothing right. You guys may want to look up what TONKOTSU is because obviously I tasted no pork at all in your SPICY GARLIC \"TONKOTSU\". You may fool non-asians or people that don't know any better but this type of practice is unfaithful to the cuisine and just down right shady.", "author": "Panchali S."}

We wanted to grab dinner before heading over to Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences. It was really cold that day too...well it's always cold in San Francisco. I was really craving something warm and ramen was calling my name.\n\nThere was only one waitress there and I remember reading numerous reviews complaining about the horrible service so I was a bit worried. However, our waitress was DA FRIGGIN BOMB! Maybe because there were only a few people in there at the time since it was still early and the dinner rush hadn't hit yet. Anyway, she was super sweet and I've never had someone so on top of my tea refills. She was literally on top of it. After a sip, she would swoop in and refill my tea. I didn't mind too much because I love hot, fresh tea. So I loved her and she was very friendly and patient. We took a while with ordering because I can never decide what to get (I wish I had four stomachs sometimes).\n\nOK, now to the ramen! I decided to order the tonkatsu ramen (thank you fellow Yelpers!) and my boyfriend wanted to try something new so he ordered the miso ramen. It took pretty long for our orders to come out, considering  that the place wasn't packed. When our ramens came they were smokin' hot and just hit the spot for me. I actually liked my boyfriend's miso ramen more and he liked my tonkatsu so we ended up trading (YAY, that's what bf's are for!) The tonkatsu was great but the miso had a distinctive taste that was addicting. The miso came with bean sprouts and corn (my favs), seaweed, green onions, bamboo shoots, and cha siu (pork). I found the broth was very tasty and the noodles were perfect (not too firm or soft). They were pretty yellow too which was a first for me, but I'm not going to discriminate ramen based on its color. However, we were both a bit disappointed because about 70% of the cha siu (pork) was fat. I just gave my boyfriend the fatty part (again, what bf's are for). That is my only gripe with Saiwaii. Other than that, the service was lovely and the ramen was delish! My boyfriend thought it was good but he wasn't as enthusiastic about it as me. I've been to Shinsengumi down in SoCal a couple of times and they have awesome ramen.

I also love how they have two TV\"s, just because I was there during the 18-inning Giants playoff game and the whole restaurant was going nuts. The TV's are not in your face so you're not distracted but if there is an important game then you'll catch all of the action.", "author": "Rory K."}

I've been wanting to come by ever since they opened last year and finally got the chance to.  Keeping it short, the ramen was just okay.  I appreciated the bamboo shoots and the consistency of the noodles, but sadly the flavoring was pretty bland.  I got the tonkatsu flavored broth and it only came with maybe 2 slices of meat.\n\nSo why 3 stars instead of 2?  Cuz I also got to try the chicken karaage and the Paradise roll.  Both of these items saved what would have otherwise been a very disappointing meal.  The chicken karaage comes with some house sauce and it's pretty good.  The chicken alone is very tasty and I dropped some into my ramen once I ran out of pork.  And the sushi roll was pretty impressive.  I thought it was on par with sushi you might get at Ebisu or some other similarly good sushi place.\n\nI'd go back to Saiwaii, but probably not for the ramen.  I really want to try out more of their sushi and get some of that tasty chicken karaage again.", "author": "Joe M."}

The 2 stars aren't for the ramen, or service, but for the huge portion of delicious & crispy Chicken Karaage appetizer. First, after having our name called and seated, the waitress seemed to have forgotten that she seated us, and we ended up waiting for quite some time before having our order taken. My wife stuck with her guns and went with the Tonkatsu Ramen, while I went for the Regular Spicy Garlic Ramen, and a Chicken Karaage appetizer to share. My wife says the first couple sip of her Tonkatsu broth was delicious, but by the time she was done, she thought it lacked flavor and noticed her store bought noodles had an odd texture. My Spicy Garlic Ramen tasted like burnt garlic, and eventually I couldn't taste anything after my tongue went numb from the building heat. I wanted to enjoy the broth, but simply couldn't, because I kept choking on chili flakes that got stuck in my throat. Additionally, my store bought noodles were mushy, kept breaking, and falling back in the bowl causing the broth to splash me. Not to mention the waitress who kept avoiding eye contact when we were trying to wave her down for a water refill. I'd be willing to come back when it's a bit less busy, in the hopes that we get a quality meal on our next visit.

I have been here many times, and it has been very consistent every time that I have been here.\n\nI usually get the Shoyu Ramen with Unagi Don combo which comes out to around $10.95 + tax and I can say its a pretty decent deal because I do feel full after eating that.  There are times where I have substituted with pork belly, and I do not think that is necessarily worth it because the pork belly portion itself is small and it doesn't strike me as worth $3 for like 2-3 pieces.  The ramen quality itself is okay, the noodles are nice and chewy.  The broth is pretty standard with their Shoyu which is kind of a testament to their ramen (nothing really stands out to surprise me at Sawaii).\n\nAs far as the ambiance/environment, it is pretty tight quarters between table to table and that ruins the dining experience a little bit.  On occasion, they have had new/in training waiters and they have been flimsy about getting orders completed and served in a timely manner, but usually service has been pretty good at Sawaii.\n\nOverall, I would say its about average, and I would come back if I wanted a quick fix on ramen for a good price.

The potato was a little too dense and not fluffy enough, but delicious still and served on a large bed of shredded cabbage. There's also a sushi menu aside from the ramen menu.

We were starving by then, so we just went to Saiwaii Ramen down Irving to fill our tummys. \n\nWe were the last table they seated immediately before they started a name list. We sat down, ordered, talked for a bit, and then we realized that the table sat down after us got their food first. We were a bit annoyed, but were calmed down as soon as we got our food.\n\nWe got an order of Unagi Avocado, Sake Avocado, and Ebi Avocado each. There were 6 pieces in a roll, and they were okay; not spectacular, okay for 4 dollars. It was food, and we gulped it down.\n\nI ordered Spicy Garlic Tonkotsu, regular spicy, and it was actually delicious when I first started. I love my ramen scalding hot. I always start a bowl of ramen with a sip of the broth; a good bowl of ramen is deeply depended on its broth. Like the normal Tonkotsu ramen, the broth wasn't thick and creamy, but it does have a nice tonkotsu flavor, and it was rich and spiiiicy. There's not really a garlicy flavor to it, which I didn't really mind (no smelly breath after!). The noodles were the normal yellow noodles, nothing special about it. \n\nMy friend got the same thing, but he got his super spicy. I had a sip of his broth and it was indeed spicy. It's got a nice strong kick at the end, it's got a spicy aftertaste. He eats spicy everyday, and he couldn't finish the broth. (but he eats more of a Mexican spicy than Asian spicy)\n\nMy boyfriend got the normal Tonkotsu ramen that's not at all spicy. It was mild, kind of thick, definitely not cloudy. Each bowl of ramen has 3 pieces of chashu, I gave my boyfriend my chashu, and he said it tasted better when it soaked up all the spiciness in the broth. \n\nIt was really good when you first dive in when you're all starving, but half way through it got kinda bland.

Anyhow, due to my bad ramen experiences, I was a bit reluctant to try Saiwaii Ramen, but since a few people recommended it, I had to try it!  I have to face the fact that I will never have the flavorful ramen I had in Japan in San Francisco.\n\nWe went to Saiwaii Ramen with an open mind. We started with the Kobe Beef Salad, featuring slices of lightly grilled fatty and tender Kobe Beef, on top of the spring salad and onions, with a hint of ginger. Yum, yum, yum...I highly recommend this if you go! Since they offer combination meals with the ramen, we added the Spicy Tuna Don, it was not the best, but it was not bad either, it was a nice cold side dish.  And then our ramens...my hubby ordered the Tonkotsu and I ordered the Spicy Garlic Tonkotsu. Both tonkotsu were served with chashu, bamboo shoots, seaweed, green onion and kikurage (also known to us Chinese as 'wood ear'). We both added the Pork Belly, I didn't realize that I forgot to add the Egg until I was halfway done! I heard their egg is marinated in soy sauce and the yolk is runny, I will have to try it next time.\n\nThe outcome? The Tonkotsu (non-spicy) was milky and flavorful. I then tried my Mild Spicy Garlic Tonkotsu, oh yeah, this is what I'm talking about, it was very flavorful and the spice was perfect, not spicy to the point where I couldn't taste my food. The ramen was actually good too, the texture was crunchy chewy, it didn't get soggy right away. The soy sauce Pork Belly was extremely fatty and the fatty part melted like butter, but I do have to say that the meaty part of it was not that tender.", "author": "Eva L."}

I got the mild one, but it still had a good amount of spicy taste, and the garlic flavor was really strong and delicious. Usually, I don't really care about the little foods in the bowl and just eat it, but the bamboo pieces and mushroom or tree ear, whatever it is, tasted really good. Everything was great together. I wish i ordered a boiled egg though; I did not know it didn't come with one, but that was my mistake. The pieces of pork were mostly fat with a little bit of meat, which was tasty, but I prefer more meat than fat. The broth was delicious, and the noodle texture was chewy and fresh tasting. One other thing I didn't like was I felt the portion was pretty small. I usually eat half of my meals and take the rest home for another meal, but without the sushi roll, I don't think I would have been that full. The sushi roll was pretty good, just a normal roll with avocado and salmon. \n\nThe service was good, our server was very nice.

I'm in ramen heaven.\n\nFor me, the most important part of ramen is the broth and they nail it here. It's flavourful, collagen-y, and not too oily. To make the already rich and porky ramen even richer and porkier, the perfectly braised pork belly cubes are incredibly tender, sweet, and full of flavour. I mean, just look at this beauty: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=9D5FbB5TFH5GQ_khRhWwOw. I'm normally not a fan of fatty cuts of meat like pork belly, but I *always* get them here. They really are *that* good (I especially love the chewy skin on top) and indubitably worth the extra time at the gym I'll have to spend to work them off. The noodles are cooked well and have a good chew to them. Of course, there are also the standard ramen toppings: chashu, bamboo shoots, wood ear fungus, seaweed, and green onions (though I wish they didn't charge extra for the egg). The chashu is decent, but pales in comparison to the marvelous pork belly. I take my time composing each spoonful so that I get a little bit of everything in each bite. It can be a little tedious, but so worth the time.\n\nIn addition to their fabulous tonkotsu ramen, they also have a pretty wide selection of very reasonably priced appetizers and sushi too. My favourite is their hiyayakko (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=C9Gzg4J5sEBKtknaK4yIcA). I've eaten my way through SF looking for the best hiyayakko and it's here at Saiwaii. The large blocks of silken tofu is topped with a generous portion of bonito flakes and green onions (most places don't give you enough). They also serve this with ponzu sauce, which I prefer to the standard soy sauce since it's not as salty and has more flavour.\n\nI'm also a fan of their California special roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7Cl-sZlymEjhxm0MJTR7nw?select=EhfFjJjXhdBHqtHH6MujjQ), which is basically a California roll with unagi added.

I called Sawaii and they were able to save a table for us which means no wait. \n\nWe had the garlic spicy miso ramen for me and a garlic spicy tonkotsu for the hubby. \n\nBoth soups were flavorful and rich. After a few sips of the spicy soup (regular spicy, mind you), we both couldn't feel our lips and our noses were running from the spice. I thought I had a high tolerance for spicy but boy, the \"regular\" spicy is really spicy! Next time I'll just go mild or none at all. \n\nOn that note, I believe the owner is the same as \"Sawaii Sushi\" on Kearny , another \"quickie pseudo-japanese\" lunch spot in the FiDi. I saw her give the sushi chef the stare down to make sure he was doing everything right. The waitresses were very sweet, but the owner lady's intense eyes made my experience not so pleasant, hence I deducted a star because I can't stand micromanagers!", "author": "Nancie T."}

But I feel a little ripped off because it was 9$. Come on now, 9$ for... california roll... It's like we paid an extra 5 dollars to have it deep fried. \n\nI like this place though.

There s so little room some parties who didn't know each other has to sit together.\n\nNow..on tot he food. The boyfriend and I ordered two ramens, fried oysters and fried gyoza. The fried gyoza was bland and too oily for me. IT was definitely a skip in my book. THe fried oysters were delicious to me. The boyfriend didn't like it, but then again he doesn't like oysters ( i know, he's crazy). Now..on tot he RAMEN. SSOOO DELICIOUS!!! I got the spicy pork one and added egg. THe boyfriend got the regular pork and added egg and extra pork belly. BOth of the broths were DELICIOUS. The noodles were just perfect for me. IT wasn't too hard or too mushy. I thoroughly enjoyed my ramen and felt it was worth  every penny. \n\nOVer all the restaurant is very good. Im totally a fan.

No wait or weird hours!  Came here on Sunday around noon and didn't have to wait at all for a table.  Throughout the meal until the end, there may have only been 1 party waiting?\n\n2. Great broth.  Thicker spicy broth reminds me of Ramen Dojo.\n\n3. Pork belly option!  This is hovering over the *typical* section though since it wasn't as tender as I hoped, though it was packed with flavor.\n\n4. Kalbi appetizer!  Who doesn't like kalbi?  With that said though, it was a tiny bit more fatty than I prefer.\n\n5. NOM.  The bowl was packed full of stuff.  Saiwaii definitely doesn't skimp.\n\n*Typical*\n1. Noodles weren't any special or up to Orenchi/Halu quality, though they weren't soggy either.  \n\n2. Price was about standard ramen price.  \n\n*Cons*\n1. Their attempt at a soft boiled egg kind of fizzled.  $1 definitely should give me something gooey and semi warm.  Theirs was more solid than anything and cold :(\n\n2. While it was more endearing than anything, I still prefer to sit farther than half an arm's length away from the neighboring table.  It was endearing because my neighbor was an adorable baby girl that was fascinated by me.\n\nOverall, I'd come back here, if not for the convenience of a lack of a wait and good price for ramen in the city.

The sunrise roll is spicy tuna and mango and yummmmmm delicious.  The ramen and the chasu was perfectly cooked and chewy, but the soup base lacked a bit of flavor initially.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but I expected my taste buds to dance when I took a sip of ramen soup base.  A whole bowl later, no dancing taste buds, but I was satisfied.

My first experience was near perfect. Ordered pork belly in shoyu ramen. Almost died, it was so good. Big, thick chunks of pork belly that fell apart into sweet layers of heaven in my chopsticks.

My expectations for this place was not high, but I had to fulfill my ramen fix. Compared to all the different ramen places in SF, this does stack up pretty well. It is no secret that SF does not have great ramen, but this place does pretty good for SF.\n\nI decided to try their Spicy Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen (regular)\n\nThe noodles are okay. The texture is good. The noodles have a good chewy texture to them, not over cooked. On the downside the noodles taste a little too salty. You can tell they are not high quality like some of the top ramen places in San Mateo (Himawari, Santa, Ramen Dojo). But for SF Ramen it satisfies.\n\nMy first impressions of the soup was salty. But as I kept eating and drinking the broth, I was able to get use to it without it being too salty to the point where I could not finish the broth. The spicy garlic tonkatsu flavor was good. The spice was perfect. It was not too spicy to overwhelm the broth, but left my lips tingling a little. Another big plus was that the spice was not an overload of chili oil, but had good flavor combination with the garlic and tonkatsu.  They put whole cloves of garlic inside, which surprisingly did not overpower the broth.\n\nThe ingredients used was plentiful. Good amount of bamboo shoots, sliced pork, ground pork, seaweed, green onions, etc...The presentation was very nice, and all the ingredients  blended well with each other. \n\nOverall, this place offers pretty good Ramen for SF, and is a good choice to come and try.", "author": "Nick C."}

Of all the places that he has claimed to traversed, this is by far his top SF pick.  \n\nThe Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen is pretty tasty.  But, the broth is heavy in oil, and it's not spicy enough for me to even pretend it's spicy at all.  As a result, I appreciate the Miso broth more, and maybe the Spicy Garlic Miso will fare better next time.  Nevertheless, the PORK BELLY is BOMB in the bowl!!  The pieces are pretty big, tender, and have thick fatty skin (if you are into that type of thing).  Although the add-ins can turn a cheap bowl into a pricey one, Sawaii is more generous than other ramen joints that seem to skimp on standard mix-ins (ahem* I'm sorry, a couple pieces of wakame seaweed does not suffice).  Last time I was here, every bowl included several pieces of pork (not pork belly) and vegetables.  \n\nThe restaurant accepts credit cards, which is a plus, and it's in a great strip of neighboring stores, boba shops, restaurants, and groceries (info for all the non-locals).

This isn't necessarily specific criticism about Saiwaii as I feel the same way about Shalala Ramen (Mtn View)'s highest level of spicyness. Dish vs. Dish though, Shalala's stock, noodles, and toppings make it a better dish than Sawaii's.\n \nCons:\n* Small portion for the price. I really expected a larger portion of noodles or at least an egg for a $10 bowl of Ramen outside of japan.\n* Roast pork wasn't very good. It was a bit firm/chewier than I like -- as if it could have been roasted a little longer.\n* Any sushi restaurant that serves butter fish is always suspect for me -- esp considering what butter fish can do to unsuspecting people's GI tracts.

I happened to go on their first official day of business and did not have to wait for a table.  The owner is very nice and was very apologetic.  I think I heard more apologies coming from the staff than anything else.  It took awhile for us to get menus so we could order but we finally got our ramen and ordered sushi and gyoza.  I thought the gyoza was good, sushi was okay but had a lot of rice.  Ramen tasted okay.  I ordered miso and it wasn't too salty but still had flavor.  The cha-siu had a lot of fat on it.  I think one of the pieces was just fat and no meat.  Overall, I was still satisfied.  But they don't add a lot of extras to the ramen.  I think it was just corn as the main vegetable in the broth.  You have to pay $1more for an egg, $1 more for corn, $1 more for everything else extra.\n\nI noticed the table across from us did not get what they ordered.  They forgot to make one of their appetizers.  Again, more apologies and they did offer to make their appetizer on the house if they wanted, but the customers left.  At least they offered.\n\nWhen the bill came I think I had slight sticker shock.  $31 for ramen?!   Wow.  I didn't even have any tea.  Big difference from my cheapo $.15 Costco packs that I used to eat daily back in the day.  But I guess our appetizers must've cost a lot.  Somewhat expensive lunch for us.  Our experience was okay and I'm sure they'll get tons of business in their location.  I'll be back anyway because I can't resist ramen.", "author": "Stacey C."}

After we ordered, the waitress seated other customers and took their orders as well. \n\nWe waited about 20 minutes...and our food never came. We saw bowls of Ramen and plates of sushi in the kitchen about to be brought out, so I thought they were ours. But nope, they went to THREE OTHER TABLES THAT WERE SEATED AND ORDERED AFTER US. Sorry about the caps, but I was so mad because they ordered the same thing as us, but they got their food before us. If they gave it to ONE table that came after us, maybe it would have been fine, but nope. They gave it to THREE tables that had parties varying from 2-6 customers each.

The noodles appear to be freshly made and were al dente which is the right texture, but I didn't think the noodles were flavorful enough.  The broth was perfect for the cold evening - the garlic wasn't strong,  the spiciness was just right, and it wasn't too salty.  Adding the pork belly is a great addition and my bowl came with 3 large and flavorful pieces.  The standard char siu on the other hand was bland and rubbery.  So I'd give this a 'good' rating, but not outstanding.  Of course I'm comparing it to the bowl I had at Momofuku in NYC so the bar is a bit high.\n\nService was a bit off so the rating takes a little hit there.  The server didn't know his dishes and got confused.  We ordered goma ae (steamed spinach in sesame sauce) but he called it seaweed salad when he delivered it.  I don't' know if you can expect authentic Japanese food here based on the goma ae, so you might want to stick to the ramen.", "author": "Brian Y."}

I was super disappointed when the only tonkatsu I saw was two slivers of what seemed to be extra wide slices of bacon. I know times are tough but REALLY! Overall flavor was decent but nothing that blew my sox off as I had my share of ramen experiences. Also be carefully when slurping, it will burn the back of the throat going down so if you can't take heat this is not your thing.

Driving to san mateo sucks.  However, i have to judge this place on it's execution of it's ramen, especially with the namesake in the title... and this case it was left really wanting..\n\nI ordered the Tongotsu broth ramen with the \"special\" pork cheek and combo'ed with the tekka don (tuna sashimi over rice).  For 7.95 + $4 for the don...it's pretty reasonable.  Also had the chicken karaage and grilled squid.   The fried chicken was good...and the grilled squid came out well... However, the most important judging is the ramen...\n\nThe Tongotsu Ramen broth... was terrible.  It felt watered down and lacked depth and flavor.  Was tempted to add soy sauce to mine..but the watered down taste was too prevelent to help.  I really swear they watered this broth down... to the point that it no longer had the creamy texture of tongotsu broth.  Also, the special pork cheek... wtf.. taste like the bbq from a roast duck shop.  The cha shu was okay...and the noodles was chewy, with a decent texture..but the broth was too diappointing to overcome. This is no where close to Izakaya Sozai's Ritsu tongotsu broth, which is amazing.   \n\nThe tekka don was nothing special.  \n\nThe wait staff was friendly but very slow and lacked experience.\n\nFor the city, I'd stick to Katana-ya for their miso and shio broth ramen.. and Izakaya Sozai for their tonkotsu broth.\n\nSaw the note from other reviewer on the stirring... trust me no amount of shaking or stirring will help.  We had two orders... one was split.. so no need to stir... and keep in mind tongotsu broth is emulsified..you do NOT need to stir.. see Ikazya's as an example.  It's almost velvety in texture.. where as here, it had the texture of water.   \"Cup O Noodles\" requires you to stir but definitely not real Tongotsu ramen.", "author": "Vien C."}

It was not great, but not horrendous. \n\nWe all had the ramen with sushi lunch special. The sushi rolls were somewhat small and though they use real crab, I can't help but be left wanting a bit more from a good sushi chef. They seemed somewhat bland, the crab was plain in the California roll and there was no avocado and the spicy tuna roll lacked a kick. \n\nThe ramen we had were the Miso and the pork tonkatsu. The broth was average, but was rather fatty, a thin layer solidified anytime we stopped eating to chat for a minute. The meat was somewhat boring, though it was offered in good portions. The toppings, seaweed, etc. gave a nice feel to the soup, but it wasn't enough to make me want to go back. The noodles were pretty average. My friend had the miso ramen and to me, it was pretty bad. I was under the impression that miso was not supposed to be sweet, but it was. My theory was that the corn that had been added to the soup was from a can and they didn't think to drain the corn juice that comes in the can which is often sweet. \n\nIn general, nothing stood out, and nothing drew me back.", "author": "Larry Y."}

I decided on the Tonkotsu Ramen though I wanted spicy, because I wanted to try the broth base first. I have to say, I was disappointed. Being that I've been enjoying Ramen houses for so long, maybe my expectations were too high?\n\nWhat makes this place a 2 star is the slow service, they would've gotten 3 if they were a bit quicker. 11:30am for lunch, and people are starting to fill into this small place. They cram every available spot with a table, so you feel really cramped when it gets full, then there's only one server and that person is also expected to clean up, bring your food, take the orders, bring the checks and collect money... I mean, really?? \n\nThe sushi also is disappointing. Not sure how the \"special sushi\" comes out, but the basics are something that anyone can make in their own kitchen...

So after a lot of waiting and checking this Yelp page, I felt it was time to take a dive. I should have gone with my first instincts and go to Turtle Tower in the TL but I felt lazy. Serves me right. It was pretty packed around lunch time but we got the small table in the corner right away. A lot of people were walking by and checking it out so I assume most of them are first-timers as well. \n\nWe ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and I added egg and stewed pork. Hoon got the Miso ramen, and we shared an Agedashi Tofu and a order of gyoza. \n\nFirst to arrive was the Agedashi tofu which was pretty bland. The portions of tofu pieces are about half of what you get at other places for the same price. There was nothing particularly special about it at all. It's fried tofu in some sort of bland dashi stock.\n\nSecond to arrive was the gyoza. Now this was a total what the fuck. The gyoza came to us not golden brown, not even brown, but the bottom crust was black. Now I'm all for carcinogens and burnt stuff because that stuff tastes good, but this was ridiculous! Any cook who willingly sends out black, charred, overcooked anything should be reconsidered. We looked at it on arrival and then looked back at the waitress who looked at the gyoza and had this astonished look on her face. Needless to say she ducked out pretty quick. I didn't even like the sauce they give you. It was really sweet and didn't compliment the gyoza at all. \n\nThe ramen arrived and I was very upset from the start. There was no aroma. The broth was warm, not hot. And most of all, it was bland and tasteless. There was no delicate flavors or anything special about it. In fact, I can easily attest that the ramen you buy fresh with a soup base paste tastes so much better. The noodles didn't have flavor nor were they springy. They were a bit overdone, and reminded me of spaghetti. No \"kansui\" flavor or even flavor of egg. Speaking of egg, they charge you a dollar for half an egg and it doesn't even come close to the one up at Izakaya Sozai. It's soft boiled, somewhat, but it doesn't yield any flavor. The cha shu is dry, but that may be because it was rather lean, but dry nonetheless. For $3 they give you a decent amount of buta kakuni or stewed pork, but even that was bland. \n\nThere was a lot of woodear fungus and really alkaline tasting bamboo shoots. \n\nThe miso ramen broth tasted like water and miso paste, which basically means miso soup but there should have been some sort of stock in the background to support it.\n\nWe felt rushed by our waitress. She came and took away our plate of gyoza when there was still 1 left and didn't even bother to ask us if we were done yet. Sure, it was all burnt and charred, and she probably didn't expect us to finish it, but at least have the courtesy to ask. \n\nI might give this place another try in a few months but right now, I'm going to pass.", "author": "Derrick L."}

This place came close to it! The thing that sucks about eating ramen is that they charge you $1 for everything you want to add to your ramen. For example you can't have ramen without egg and I love corn in my ramen so my bowl of ramen will be $12. So until I find a bowl of ramen that comes with everything my socks won't be blown off. However this place was good. Noodles wasn't over cooked and the broth was flavorful.  That's all I really ask for.", "author": "Ann C."}

If any Chinese or Vietnamese charges me that price for wonton noodle soup or Pho, I may have to throw a huge fit.\n\nAnd this is where Sawaii comes in.  The regular flavor ramen are all $7.95.  The spicy versions are all $9.95??  What da hell do they put in there? \n\nAnyways, I ordered the tonkatsu flavor and paid $3 extra for a bowl of unagi don.  The ramen was cooked al dente and the soap was delicious.  As long as the soap and the noodle was done right, the ramen will get a B from me.  I can't give this an A simply because my slices of pork were extremely lean.  It was pretty horrible since I expected a couple slices of fatty pork belly that's semi-melty from the hot tokatsu broth.  GIMME MY FATTY PORK SLICES!!\n\nAside from that, this place can definitely be a go-to place for ramen in SF.  It just seems like all the good ramen places are located outside of SF.   There are Ramen Dojo and Santa Ramen in San Mateo.  Santouka in San Jose.  Shinsengumi and Daikokuya in LA.  Oh well!

Last nights delicious seafood Ramen can not make up for the terrible customer service I received. \n\nI was hung over and sick with a cold, long day at work and a 10 mile bike ride home...I was craving salty, brothy goodness. My husband and I have eaten here many times before, and  have gotten to-go a few times. We have also brought out of town family here because damn the have have good ramen! Always great food and excellent customer service.\n\nLast night:\n\nI placed my order with a nice woman, the owner maybe? Said it would be ready in about 10...went to Walgreens and back to Saiwaii 10 minutes later. When I get back a waitress is now at the counter saying my food to-go will be done shortly. (2 orders of seafood ramen, one for me, one for my husband and an appetizer) Great! I ask her if she can please give me 2 double bags, one ramen in each double bag. Helmet in hand I tell her I will be taking the ramen home on my bicycle handlebars about ten blocks away. I have done this before with no problem. She tells me I will have to pay for the bags because it's the law. I totally understand and search my backpack for 40 cents ( I paid with a card when I ordered) I couldn't find any money and then thought, \"huh, it's \"to-go\" shouldn't my total have included bags?\". I ask her about this...she says,\"yes, we will give you one bag but we did not anticipate you needing 3 more\". I keep searching for change at the bottom of my bag, obviously a little annoyed. Finally I ask her if there is a minimum for credit cards. She says, \"no limit\" and happily takes my card to charge 30 cents to it for the to-go bags because \"it's the law\". I over hear the woman who took my order asking the waitress what's going on. Waitress says she's charging me 30 cents because I need more than 1 bag. The woman (owner maybe?) says, 'just give them to her she spent $30\". The waitress gives me 3 bags and says, \"she said it's OK\". No apology, no helping me bag it up no nothing. \n\nAt home the ramen was good...but damn I just couldn't get over that bag thing!\n\nThis used to be my go to ramen place but it's not good enough to go back after this experience.

We were greeted by loud calls of Irashaimasu and were quickly seated. Decor is dark wood tables and chairs with long benches. Anyplace that shows Totoro on the big LCD tv is always a plus.\n\nI ordered the Unagi Roll (Unagi, avocado, 6 pieces), and the California Special roll (crab, avocado and Unagi, 6 pieces)...the Cali special was really tasty and much bigger than the Unagi roll. I wished they used more unagi sauce since it was used very very sparingly. Laura L. ordered the dragon roll which had 8 pieces but at double the other order's costs. The tempura shrimp was still crispy inside and I love the big giant pices of unagi and avocado. Nicely done! Auntie ordered the Katsu-donburi. She really liked the flavors of the carmelized onions underneath the crispy pork cutlet pieces. Although she didn't finish the rice (but who usually does?), she really enjoyed it. The miso soup it came with was also made well, not super salty and not watered down to bland dishwater.\n\nWater service was very attentive (actually to the point of every 5 minutes), our server was very nice. We had only 1 mix up at the beginning where they served us just regular California rolls instead of what we wanted, which they apologized...I did eat one before they took away the plate...it tasted okay but I was surprised that the seaweed was so chewy. \n\nI'll come back next time to try out their ramen selection...from the size of their bowls, it's going to have to be when I'm super starving to eat that much food.", "author": "Pauline L."}

I chose the miso soup base, and overall it was pretty decent. I did feel that it lost its exciting appeal rather quickly though...the flavor and texture gets very repetitive. I don't know if all authentic ramen is like this, or if their ramen is a little lackluster. I also wish they offered something other than pork in it. But the place is cozy and very small, which I liked. I also ordered one of their sushi rolls and that was delicious, and fairly priced.

So we came across Saiwaii Ramen and then I remembered I bookmarked this place ages ago. \n\nPeeked into the window and noticed they weren't too busy so we figured might as well try it. We ordered the spicy garlic miso ramen and the tonkatsu ramen. We also tacked on a ten-don (small tempura don) for a about $4 extra. \n\nBoth ramens were very tasty. The tonkatsu ramen was just right and do I dare say it was almost as good as Santa Ramen in San Mateo? Yeah - I can say it. Very creamy and very good. Good amount of ramen too. \n\nNow the spicy garlic miso ramen was really good. It had just enough heat to remind me of dare I say Ramen Dojo? Yup - darn close again. I would skip the extra bowl of ten-don. It was just ok. Nothing memorable. \n\nThe only thing that kept this place from a 5 star was that when I went back later in the week for dinner (Yes - ate here twice in one week), the tonkatsu broth wasn't as flavorful. It was honestly kind of bland. Had to keep sprinkling hot pepper flakes into my soup. Also the portion of the ramen notably shrank .

Izakaya was closed for the holidays (still?!) and we had a hungering for Tonkostu ramen.  I did a Yelp search of the area and found this spot barely 2 miles away, which was very fortunate as my poor friend was withering away with hunger!\n\nFirst, the place is a very unassuming spot. No ambiance or decor to speak of, but DAMN the food was good!\n\n I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and the broth was divine!  Very creamy and rich with flavor, exactly how I like it! The toppings were fairly generous and the fresh scallions heaped on top was a nice bonus. I'm always surprised at how few places even bother with small touches like that, it shows an attention to detail and care that is quickly becoming a rare thing.  It invokes a fond memory of mama's soup, slurping up some noodles and gulping scorching broth just as the snow begins to fall outside. \n\n(Well, it was also REALLY cold in the restaurant. Damn guys, turn up the heat!) \n\nMy friend got the Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen, but spicy and even with all that spice you could taste the dimensions of flavor in the broth rather than it being obliterated by the spiciness. It will be my next choice!!\n\nI also ordered a Sunrise roll (?) which was spicy tuna, mango and avocado.  I was skeptical being the place looks slightly on the dingy side, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The seaweed was tender, yet not tough and chewy and the mango was sweet for once!! Usually when I get any kind of roll with mango in it, I can't taste it for squat, so it was nice change. Tuna was fresh, tasty and just spicy enough.  Beautiful presentation and great sushi as far as I can tell, I can't wait to try the others!\n\nIt's a pity that service isn't exactly that awesome as I had to call out to the servers twice to get their attention.  Oh, and we were THE ONLY ONES in the restaurant. Also, they don't have a liquor license yet, so no hot sake or ice cold sapporo for you if you enjoy that with your meal.  That was a REAL bummer. \n\nAlso, I really hope they consider putting some thought into the ambiance.  I don't enjoy hearing commercials when I'm eating dinner.

The tonkatsu ramen and the sushi came fast. I Waited for my unagi don for a long long time. The people at my table finished their ramen and then I got my unagi don. Making them wait and the unagi don was lackluster. The eel was okay and the rice was eh. It just had a lot of the eel sauce on the rice and like this a little bit of seasame and like a teaspoon of shredded seaweed. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad but the wait for it was horrible. \n\n2) The woman who does the sitting of the table during night time. I don't know if she's the owner or what. But man she makes me pissed. We wait about 45 minutes for our table. Why? Because people called and made a \"reservation\" and by \"reservation\" I mean they called it and the lady said okay come on in we'll set you up (how did we know? we asked some people around us what this \"reservation\" is and they told us that you don't even have to put down your name and you just come say you have a reservation and she'll sit you down) there's a name list as soon as you walk in and it's total BS. We waited freaking 45 minutes for a table because every freaking person said they had a reserveration and they put their names down on that stupid list. Our name was there before them but they said they called first so they got a table first. A group of people who came 15 minutes after us got a table before us because they had a \"reservation\". and you know the best part? She apologized to them for the table taking too long. But when she sat us down there was nothing. We waited 2x longer than them and we got nothing. \nAnd when we told her about how we were here before them she just said they had a reservation. it's like really?

I will say that the pork belly addition is delicious.\n\nAll in all, I think Sawaiii is a great ramen place.  They also have nice Ramen Combos that allow you to get a half serving of donburi.  I just wish they were more consistent with their flavors.  It's great that they seem to be paying attention to their reviews on Yelp, but at some point they need to find a taste that defines them.", "author": "Andrew T."}

However, I did notice two people lifting their bowls and drinking every last drop of the soup from their ramen...which I took as a good sign.  Anyway,  my boyfriend and I shared the Miso Ramen, Tonkatsu Ramen and Hot Summer Roll.\n\nThe Hot Summer Roll (spicy tuna, avocado and mango) was surprisingly delicious and refreshing.  The tuna was very fresh and the mango added a nice sweetness to it...nom, nom, nom!\n\nBoth the miso broth and pork broth broth from the ramen were very flavorful and I enjoyed them equally.

I was surprised that we were able to get seats at 7PM on a Friday, so that was a plus.\n\nUnfortunately, the ramen was not as good as I had hoped.  My friend and I started with agedashi tofu, which was fantastic (although I may be biased because I just love the silky texture of tofu).  The fried crab sushi was so-so.  I thought the rice was a little soggy, but I won't fault them there because Saiwaii is not billing itself as a sushi restaurant.\n\nI had the garlic tonkotsu ramen.  The broth is generally made by boiling pork fat, bones, and collagen for hours until a thick, milky broth is formed - in other words, savory, salty, deliciousness.  The broth here was really savory and salty, but it didn't have complexity or depth of flavor.  The noodles did not seem to have soaked up any flavor, so every bite was this weird, separated dichotomy of bland noodle taste and salty broth.  The garlic was overwhelming.  Maybe that was my fault for ordering the garlic version, which could have drowned out the more subtle flavors.\n\nAnyway, I'd try it if for no other reason than because this is a ramen shop where you can likely get a seat, and you can never really go wrong with a hot bowl of noodle soup.  Prices are really reasonable too.", "author": "Pearl L."}

Even though the restaurant is pretty small, the design is sleek, modern, and spacious which can accommodate large groups of people.  We all had the Tonkotsu ramen which came with delicious bamboo shoots and plenty of noodles.  However, the broth lacked dimension and felt flat.  I tried adding some red pepper flakes to give it a little more flavor but it still tasted bland.  A shame, really, because I'm a firm believer that broth is probably one of, if not the most, important aspect to a good bowl of ramen.  My only suggestion is to add more salt into the broth.  It definitely has potential; what it needs is some magic here and a pinch or five of salt there to enhance the flavor.\n\nThe service was also very friendly and attentive.

I've had ramen at many different places around town, and I still haven't found a place that makes ramen as good as the little street ramen places in Tokyo.  I have a feeling they don't exist.  \n\nWell, Sawaii was no exception.  And, of the places in San Francisco I've tried, it was very nearly the most flavorless.  I'm pretty sure they do not use homemade noodles, their consistency is that of dried, and their broth just doesn't have any flavor.  I had the Chashu ramen, and as someone previously mentioned, had to pay extra for the egg, and the egg came out nearly uncooked - the white was even runny.  In light of the salmonella scare going on, it seemed sort of bad taste (not to mention affecting my enjoyment of the meal).  \n\nSorry Sawaii, I'll be continuing to go to Genki for their amazing Chashu Ramen with the homemade noodles, super tender pork, marinated egg and loads of flavor (under 10 bucks out the door).    \n\nStars for the really nice staff, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that there might be a couple good things on the menu.", "author": "Cami B."}

But my most recent visit had been a lot less than pleasant!  It was about a five minute wait for a table for two, which is not bad at all given how small the restaurant is. But once we were seated, we had to wait 15 minutes before our order was taken. We tried flagging the waiter down, but he seemed to lower is head every time he passed us. Eventually, we noticed that the table that was sat after us (party of 6) had already received their food and we hadnt even been offered water! So I turned around and stood up to grab the waiter to take our order. He comes to our table, and the lady at the table next to us tries to order first! At this point, my patience has completely run out, and I say to the waiter, \"why are you taking her order? We are not together and my friend and I have been waiting for over 15 minutes!\" So he procedes to take our order and then takes the order of the next table (ehich I forgot to mention, just sat down), then he rushes off! So we sit there, drinkless while we wait for the waiter to come back.\n When we receive our food, a female waitress brings it, with tea. I can only assume that we have scared our waiter off because the rest of the dinner was served by the waitress instead. That waitress saved this review from being a one star review! Man, they have to retrain that waiter because it wasnt that busy and he really dropped the ball when it comes to just standard service! \nIn terms of the ramen, the garlic tonkatsu broth is great. A little pricey for the amount that you get though. I would say you woukd get a better deal at some of the other ramen places in the city or evem san mateo, with the same or better quality.", "author": "Randell J."}

Not necessarily the Debbie Downer of the group, perhaps we'll refer to him as the Hard-to-Please Henry. Hard-to-Please Henrys can come off very apathetic and are easily dissatisfied when presented with something of greatness. They are too consumed in their own high standards and great expectations that by the time this thing of greatness is revealed, they can only see this greatness as being a lackluster performance and nothing more. I sadly suffered a case of being the Hard-to-Please Henry the night I dined at Saiwaii Ramen.\n\nI really wanted to like Saiwaii Ramen, but once those feelings of slight dissatisfaction occurred, the transformation of happy camper into Hard-to-Please Henry was irreversible. It all began when our server told me that the shoyu ramen does not come in spicy. Now I am a spicy ramen enthusiast. I find it impossible to devour ramen if it is not spicy. The only remedy to my problem was to order the spicy garlic ramen because that was the only ramen that came in spicy. So my question is -- how does Saiwaii have a spicy garlic ramen but cannot add that same spice from that broth into the shoyu ramen? Blaspheme! I'm pretty sure the spicy garlic ramen was amazing, but my Hard-to-Please Henry goggles were on and anything substituted for my initial want of spicy shoyu ramen just would never reach my high expectations. The broth was overly salty and the mixture of spice, garlic, and boiling hot broth made my breath hotter than a flaming hot dragon. IMO, you either go with garlic or with spicy but never those two together because putting those two ingredients together create a potent mixture that'll leave your stomach bubbling and your breath reeking for days. \n\nDespite being quite the Hard-to-Please Henry, the chicken karaage was still delicious.

Went looking for it after I dumped off a prescription @ Walgreen's two blocks away. I was greeted nicely upon entering. There were several tables filled with customers, and most of the clientele were Asian, which always makes me confident that it's gonna be good.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen with pork, though I thought about getting one of the specials. Pretty good deal on any type of Ramen + six pieces of Donburi for less than ten dollars. Sounded like too much to eat right then though, so I went for the Tonkatsu.\n\nWhat arrived was nicely spicy (asked for middle-of-the-road spicy instead of super spicy). This is not a place that dumbs down their spiciness for pale whiteys like me. :-)  So, they get points on the spicy scale. Had a good amount of stuff swimming around in the broth, and it was a good size bowl. Not big enough to swim in (sometimes they just look daunting), but definitely enough for a meal.\n\nI'll be going back. Very good food @ reasonable prices, friendly service and in my neighborhood!\n\nScore.\n\n[Edit: I've been back twice since. This place is consistently good, both with appetizers and with the ramen.

After waiting 15-20 minutes for our order (the place was only half full and the waiter came to refill our teacup about half a dozen times) we finally were able to eat. I had their tonkatsu ramen and there was literally only 4 side ingredients as I looked disappointingly down at my bowl. A few pieces of bamboo shoots, shredded green onions, seaweed, fungus & 2 pieces of paper thin sliced pork (it almost gave me a paper cut!) with one having 3/4 of fat on it, so it was more like 1 1/2 piece. I swear they used to give at least 3 decent sized pieces.

That alone gives it a place in my heart, and it was the first and now only thing I order.  \n\nI go for extra spicy since regular spicy isn't hot enough for me, and yet, I can still taste everything. The broth is rich and flavorful. Even though it's spicy, the creaminess of the pork bone is still there; it's stronger than other places I've tried (which I like), but not overly salty. I've had friends try the other ramens, and they all liked the flavor of their broths. It has a decent amount of toppings: seaweed, bamboo, wood fungus, roasted garlic (but only one or two pieces; boo) ground pork, chashu and topped with shredded green onion and chilis (the thin red strings). The chashu is okay, but then I've never been to a place that had spectacular chashu, either. I'm no expert on what the \"perfect\" ramen noodles is supposed to be; all I know is I like how they do them. Nice and chewy, not too firm, springy, and they absorb the flavor in the broth well.\n\nI have tried the pork belly, and it is as good as they say. Tender, melt-in-your-mouthy with a stewed sweetness. When I'm feeling decadent, I'll get it since the ramen itself is already very filling and delicious, and that just puts it over the top.\n\nThey have a nice lunch special where for only $2 more, you get a sushi roll (spicy tuna or CA w/ real crab). If you bring a small child with you, that will usually take care of them. I've only tried a few of their appetizers, and they were only so-so. However, I've seen their hamachi and salmon kamas, and everyone who I saw eating it seemed to like it. They offered uni nigiri for a while, and the one I had was very fresh and delicious. They have a long list of appetizers (many of which I want to sample) and sushi available, as well as dons, if you go with a group and are not feeling the ramen (for which you should be ashamed).\n\nNow for the place itself: it's cozy, without being overly small, but you will find yourself sometimes elbow-to-elbow with the table next to you. Dark wood tables and chairs with 2 flatscreens on both ends (it varies what they have playing: sports, Food Network, or movies). There's a specials menu hanging over the sushi bar that also lists the beer and sake selections, but it can be hard to read sometimes. The service is very friendly and attentive. Every server I had was always nice and good about checking in. They are also fast; it always feels like I had only just ordered when they bring out my ramen piping hot, even on busy nights. They have the waiting list whiteboard, but even then, they move pretty quickly. My only real complaint is that the door doesn't close automatically. When you sit anywhere near the door, it can get cold when it opens, but it's worse when someone walks in or steps out and leaves it open.\n\nAs long as this place stays open and keeps making the spicy garlic tonkatsu, they will have my business.", "author": "Myrna A."}

I tried so many different ramen place (pretty much all ramen place in the peninsula side) and i finally have a favorite. As ramen goes, you might find better if you feel like driving down to Saratoga, Palo Alto or San Mateo, but as the city goes this place is the best to me! I used to go to katana ya for lunch, the ramen is good, but the area sucks, long waiting times and the place feels uncomfortable. Suzu has good ramen too, but the waiting time is always a bummer. Tanpopo also has good ramen, but in never tried during lunch or dinner time so i cannot say anything about waiting times, but it is good. Sapporo also has good ramen, but i like all the new ramen places spawning in the area. Genki ramen.... well i just don;t like their ramen. But let's talk saiwaii otherwise i will start listing all ramen places in the area. I got Tonkotsu ramen with extra pork belly cubes. It was delicious. The broth was delicious, flavorful and the toppings were great too, including the pork and the pork belly. I got an appetizer of grilled squid legs, age dashi and my wife got some sushi that she liked a lot. The service was excellent as well.  \n\nI really couldn't be happier with sawaii ramen, which i would put at the same level as the close by izakaya sozai. izakaya sozai offers other stuff as well and it is a great restaurant, but i usually want only ramen, and this is the place.

Always a good sign.  Once I walked in, I was instantly drawn to the cozy understated dark wood decor and the savory aromas of ramen broth and other home-style goodies.  Bonus points for a clean and welcoming atmosphere.  Service was super friendly as well.  Now, onto the food...\n\nOur party went all out and ordered like starving school children.  We started off with the house salad, which quite possibly has the best Japanese salad dressing ever...perfectly sweet and vinegary with fresh veggies and some tobiko to boot.  Next came the luscious bowls of ramen.  I am not a miso broth fan when it comes to ramen, so I can't comment too much on that one, but my Tonkatsu Ramen was spot on.  I took one sip and tasted the pork bone right away.   It was creamy and had just the right amount of salt.  Noodles were al dente and abundant, and the kurikage, seaweed, and pork toppings were the right balance for my ramen bowl. The buta kakuni side dish is a must-have too.  Have it on the side with your ramen and you'll be one happy camper.  (Love love LOVE the way fatty pork melts in your mouth.)   Oh, did I mention I also added a Tekka Don to my ramen?  For an extra $4, it was a generous bowl of rice with 4 nice slices of tuna, which really put me over the edge, since I cleaned out my ramen bowl too.  I also had a chance to sample my friends' curry don and katsu don, which were equally pleasant.  But what will bring me back for sure are the tonkatsu ramen, fatty pork, and house salad!  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu (they have some great looking izakaya items).", "author": "Kalista W."}

JoJo in my office cooked up another batch of boiled peanuts that were exquisitely spiced, with just the right almost al dente texture and ... oh yeah, this is about Saiwaii.  So after a mission to assist one business friend by taking them to the office of another business friend who is also a dear friend that I had not seen in over a year;  I planned to see another friend, Yo of \"Yo's Sushi Club\" on Mission fame, who sold that place and now manages Saiwaii Ramen.  I should give them a 5 for attitude, because, with Yo there, you know they are sincerely concerned with your culinary enjoyment.  I was kind of preoccupied with some other business concerns while also catching up with \"So what's up Yo?\"  Lots.  Suffice to say, I had the chicken stock ramen with the honey marinated pork butt and yes it was good.  I commented to Yo that I really liked the setup, heavy Japanese woodiness, rectangular floor plan with booths, because, it seemed very Ramen \"a pro pos.\"  Business associate had the tonkatsu ramen with a spicy tuna roll.  Service was attentive and I plan to further explore the menu at a later date.  You can't really go wrong with Yo on the premises.\nI should go ahead and give them a 5 ... nah, I'm kind of stingy with 5's lately. \nI keep seeing that review on my right that mentions \"...and the soup was pretty thick ...\"  It's supposed to thick ... ! ... aka flavorful ... long day, felt the love though ... did my good deeds ... Saiwaii worked well into the day's overall sanguine, feeling the love-ness ... Japanese style!   \nSolid 4, solid ramen, can't go wrong on that front.  They don't take shortcuts on food prep, quality ingredients and dedication to good product.  If you're thinking about Saiwaii Ramen and you read this far:  Go eat there.  You will enjoy it.", "author": "Terry A."}

If I had to use one word to sum it up it would be salty. They must have used a ton of salt or MSG to the point that I couldn't really taste any pork in the broth (maybe there was no pork). The egg was THE worst. It tasted like it was marinated in regular soy sauce. Yes. The marinade is supposed to contain soy sauce but not JUST soy sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-10", "description": "So close yet so far.  Saiwaii is so close being a solid four stars except for 2 seemingly minor but in reality major faults:\n\n1.) The tonkotsu ramen didn't come out piping hot.  Minus one star.\n2.) The shari of the nigiri was well-formed but used hard, stale rice.  Minus one star.\n\nThey both seem like minor things, right?  Nope.  Although easily correctable, each of these mistakes violated the cardinal rule of their respective food items.  \n\n1.) Ramen is supposed to be so hot that you have to slurp it for it to cool down properly as it enters your mouth.  Because the tonkotsu ramen was not hot enough, an oily pork fat flavor became evident, a real turn-off that could have been easily avoided if the broth were hot enough.  Real shame because the chaashuu was of high quality and of good quantity, and the kitchen was generous with the kikurage, negi, and menma (which was high quality as it didn't have the rancid flavor typical of low grade or expired bamboo shoots).  The noodles were good quality, too -- good koshi without an overwhelming kansui odor and cooked just to al dente.  \n\n2.) Some argue that the main attraction of nigiri zushi is the neta, and others argue that it's the shari -- I'm believe that it's a 50-50 split in importance, and the best nigiri comes from the synthesis of skillfully cut, fresh neta with a just dense enough, properly-seasoned shari composed of toothsome, high quality rice to form a good hitokuchi size to unlock the textural element of nigiri (the other element being taste, of course).  The itamae-san here was able to do all that with quality cuts of well-sliced fish for the neta and a shari that was the right size and density, but the rice was stale!!!  It was hard in such a way that indicated that it had spent too much time in a low-temperature area, a huge no-no!  No matter how well executed sushi is, once the rice gets hard from low temperature (a la refrigeration), the whole sushi is absolutely ruined.  If the the neta is on the cold side, I understand as it would be wise to err on the side of caution with raw fish, but to allow rice to harden due to low temperature is absolutely unacceptable.  Why do such a thing?!\n\nWhen the waitress asked if everything was OK and I expressed these sentiments to her politely, she seemed a little put off by it.  Well, your loss I suppose.  I just hate to the boss's otherwise hard efforts go to waste for two very easily correctable things.  If these two mistakes could be rectified, I'd gladly give the place four stars and make it a regular destination.  What a shame...\n\nP.S. TonkAtsu (fried, breaded porkchop) and tonkOtsu (pork bone) are two completely different things.  Make sure you know what you're getting into when you order and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Ryan D."}

The two of us are constantly having ramen dates, perpetually searching for the best ramen ever. As I said, the first time I came here, it was a serious contender for me. Because I'm a creature of habit with all things I find satisfaction in, I ordered the same thing both times--Spicy Mala with added pork belly. I took a picture of the first bowl and Instagrammed it, because that's the kind of person I am. I salivated over the photo regularly and shared it with everyone I came into contact with--the photo not the saliva. The presentation was perfect; the flavors remarkable. This second time felt like a half-assed attempt at half assery, though. The flavors were mostly good, although the chicken has a few bad pieces amongst them. The presentation was sloppy and not in a \"we're really busy and we're doing the best we can with what we have\" sorta way. The halved hard boiled egg looked like the remnants of an Easter I'd rather forget. The egg must have been pulled into two halves with someone's fingers, because there is just no other reasonable explanation for its state of existence. Everything else just left me longing for the presentation, taste, and excitement I get when I eat at Ken Ken. If only they had better hours. I probably won't return to Saiwaii. I can make better ramen at home. Luckily my roommate didn't go with me this time, so she can't say \"I told you so.\"", "author": "Shad S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-30", "description": "This is the third best ramen I have tried in San Francisco, and yes, I'm giving it three stars ... which shows you how dismal the ramen options in SF are.  (However, my two top picks, North Beach's Kirimachi and the Inner Sunset's Izakaya Sozai, both offer four-star ramen, in my opinion.)\n\nBack to Sawaii: having done my due diligence on Yelp beforehand, I ordered the spicy garlic tonkotsu ramen and added an egg ($10.95, including $1 for the egg.)  Here's the breakdown:\n\n- The broth was acceptable, but not great.  It had a lot of spice in it and too much oil for my taste.  I agree with the Yelpers who found it pleasantly creamy, though, and I did finish the broth.\n- The noodles were yellow and on the less chewy side.  I did not come close to finishing them.\n- The chashu was very disappointing.  I received 4-5 small pieces, but each piece was mostly fat.  I ate all the non-fatty bits, which were few and far between.\n- The egg was acceptable, but was on the cusp between hard-boiled and soft-boiled.  I like the egg to be runny so that I can mix the yolk into the broth, where it increases the richness of the flavor.  The yolk was congealed enough here that I had a hard time doing this.\n- The bamboo was good; the kikurage (mushrooms) were okay but forgettable; and the nori was standard, but not as I prefer it.  (Izakaya Sozai gives you a salted sheet of nori, which has possibly spoiled me for regular nori that comes already in the broth.)\n\nService was both fast and friendly. \n\nGiven that Yelpers seem to think that the dish I had is the best ramen that Sawaii has to offer, I'm not planning to return.  (EDIT: I did return, and I discovered that the spicy garlic miso is much better/less oily than the Tonkotsu, so I updated this review to three stars from the initial two stars I had given.) It's too bad: the reviews had me really excited for the possibility of a good ramen joint in the Central Sunset.", "author": "B L."}

Up side:  It has a cozy feel to it with nice warm colors and dark woods.  I wish they paid this much attention to the food.   \n\nFood:  Cold ramen sucks.  The broth was super salty even for this salt fiend and it was luke warm.  The only saving grace was the pork belly.  It was fatty, juicy and sweet.   \n\nService: The hostess was having a pleasant sit down snack with the table right next to us and pretty much ignored us the entire time.  The appetizer we ordered went to the table the hostess was sitting at even though they were pretty much done with their meals.  We couldn't get a refill on the tea to save our parched over salted mouths.   \n\nMy best friend and I went when this place first opened.  We were both excited to try this place but it fell short.  :( We ordered the tofu appetizer and we each ordered a different  bowl of ramen.  Mushroom or 'fungus' ramen for my friend and the special miso ramen for me with the pork belly.  First down side, the table next to us was obviously a group of friends of the establishment.  They received more attention, the hostess sat with them while they had dinner and they GOT THE APPETIZER WE ORDERED.  It took them forever to get another appetizer to us and it was nothing really special.  When the ramen got to our table, we received two pork belly miso ramen specials.  They totally got her order wrong.  When we pointed the mistake out to the hostess sitting NEXT to me, she looked annoyed and didn't offer to return the botched order but just huffed away and brought a little bowl of 'fungus' with no seasoning or perhaps even cooked to our table.  Classy.  She pretty much just grabbed a bunch of stuff from the ingredients bar, put it in a bowl and brought it to us.  When we finally got to dig into our ramen, the soup was very salty and luke warm.  I guess she thought the LUKE WARM soup would cook the 'fungus'.  Anyhow, the luke warm salty ramen is not satisfying in any way.  The only saving grace for me was the yummy pork belly that they served in chunks.  It was sweet and fatty and cooked to tender perfection.  My friend was completely disappointed.  I had such high hopes for this place and sad that it wasn't that good.

We order four things and they were 0/4. \n\nThis place broke the cardinal sin of serving food to the public - serving raw meat not requested by the customer. The filling for the gyoza was raw. Pork was so raw, it could've been pulsating! Knew something was wrong when I tried to break one in half and it stubbornly stayed together and tasted gooey. Not a good sign when the filling sticks to your chopsticks!! We sent it back and declined their offer for a replacement. Hubby had the big D for the rest of the day. Luckily for them, I haven't experienced anything yet. Or else I would immediately head over the emergency room for IV and fluids and send them the bill due to my extreme sensitivity to food poisoning. \n\nThe boiled spinach (with sesame dressing) was gritty. Definitely not washed thoroughly enough. Spinach was also tough and stringy. Hello- Costco sells pre washed baby spinach leaves which will serve four servings for the price they charge for one which means their profit margin is pretty healthy and they still choose to serve sandy/gritty old leaves?? \n\nThe tonkotasu and miso ramen were so-so. The noodles reminded me of those used by Santa Ramen. Cheap egg noodles with an aftertaste. The stewed pork belly add ons were okay, though salty and half of it was fat & skin. \n\nSince we were one of three tables of customers, there was no excuse for such lazy and pathetic attempts at cooking. \n\nThis has got to be my worst Japanese restaurant experience ever.", "author": "D C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-29", "description": "i LOVE saiwaii ramen! my boyfriend and i always get the spicy garlic tonkotsu ramen (available in mild, regular or spicy), chicken karaage, seaweed salad, pork katsu don and house salad. i'll add pork belly and an egg to my ramen when i'm feeling extra gluttonous. everything is soooo good and i'm never disappointed. my only complaint is that the level of \"regular\" spiciness can be inconsistent. sometimes it's too spicy and i have to ask for a side of plain broth to water down the spice. other times it's perfect. nevertheless, it's my absolute favorite ramen place in the city.", "author": "Robbie R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-17", "description": "Service is friendly and attentive here, and its speed has probably improved since the experiences of the earlier reviewers, though it wasn't particularly crowded during the slightly later dinner hours for which I was present.  Its proprietors appear to be Cantonese, and like Macao Friends before it, this small space is a passable option in the Sunset as a family-oriented place to nosh on a limited but thoughtfully targeted menu.  The tori kara-age appetizer was fine - crisp outside and moist inside; reasonably-sized portion.  However I have to agree with the prior reviewers' assessment that while the ramen is nice and firm, the broth (I had the shoyu) is too thin and bland.  Texture goes a lot way with me, so I slurped up all my noodles just fine, but all the while somewhat frustrated by the underwhelming flavors surrounding them.  Hopefully with enough feedback here on Yelp, their kitchen staff can course-correct accordingly and turn things around, as it will need to distinguish itself more on the strength of their primary fare in order to really do well in this area.", "author": "Aaron L."}

Grilled squid legs (very chewy) but taste ok.  Miso Ramen, the noodle was al-dente and taste good but the broth was another story....totally tasteless.  Also it was not temperature hot enough when it arrived at our table.  I hope they read this and improved upon this very important step of having a flavorful broth after all their rest. is called Saiwaii Ramen.  Katanaya is still the place for Ramen but it is nice to know there is another Ramen place close to my hood so I will be sure to return again perhaps try some other items on their menu.\nService ****is a solid 4 stars.... my tea cup was never empty and all the girls were super friendly and accomdating to all the patrons.\nwill def. be back and I am hoping they will improve on their broth for the Ramen.", "author": "Mel T."}

Had the lunch Special at $6.95, super hot miso soup, your not so plain Jane green salad, 4 pieces of CA roll, my entree of Chix Kara Age and rice, and that was for lunch. I can only imagine the dinners.  Ambiance is nice and clean, but not sterile.  This place a pleasant find.", "author": "Joe I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-16", "description": "We came to Saiwaii's for lunch and we both ordered the Tonkotsu (pork flavored broth $7.95) which we were told is their most popular flavored ramen. The ramen came with menma (bamboo), wakame (seaweed) and negi (green onions), and kikurage (did not care too much for). They give a good amount of each topping (good amount of pork too) and I thought the ramen portions were overall pretty decent. The bf liked his tonkotsu but I thought it was lacking in taste and could do with some salt so I loaded it with the special spices they provide for ramen. After that it was yummy! The bf also asked for a half egg ($1) but it tasted strange so he gave it to me. I agree it did taste weird but I ate it anyways. I know it's definitely not any type of egg I've had before (not chicken nor duck). I wonder what kind of egg they use...either way we wont be adding an egg to our order next time. We will be back and next time I may try their salt ramen to see if I like that better. So far Saiwaii ranks third among my ramen favorites.", "author": "Helen L."}

The spicy garlic tonkatsu ramen is the best!  I love spicy food and to have a bowl of spicy broth with ramen, you can't beat that.  It's nice to have a variety of broth to go with your ramen.  The mini don with eel or tempura is a must have!  Service is always friendly and good.", "author": "Ben S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-09-18", "description": "I was very hesitant about this place but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.  Ordered ramen, a sushi roll and a special tempura.  As mentioned in other reviews, the broth was lacking in flavor and the noodles did not taste like it was homemade.  Worst part was that the broth wasn't even hot!  When the bowl of noodles came, it was just warm/hot.  The sushi was not wrapped tight enough either.  I couldn't even pick it up with my chopstick without it falling apart.  As for the tempura, it was very oily.  So oily that you can taste oil in your mouth when you bite into it.  I feel bad for writing this review, but I hope the restaurant will take in consideration of this review and improve.  The service was nice, but since it was getting packed, I felt a bit rushed...but rushed with kindness.", "author": "Katniss B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-25", "description": "We frequent the sunset whenever we come home to visit. Our original plan was to go to another restaurant but parking around Irving can be hell and we found one exactly right in front of this place so we just decided to go there because it's Japanese and our son needs to have a meal where there is white rice. This was the perfect place for us. We entered and the waiter quickly seated us. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I ordered the spicy tuna sushi, which both were phenomenal. Seriously, you have to try it. While still looking at the little menu on the table, we noticed they have a kobe beef salad so we ordered it and my goodness, I thought I liked salad, but now I LOVE salad. Best ponzu dressing ever. My husband is still reminiscing and requested for us to start using more ponzu at home. For $5, there was a good portion of buttery kobe slices in that dish. Our waiter was fantastic too. He saw that we had a toddler with us, and he was kind enough to bring us extra napkins and a spoon for him right away. He was the only server and there were about 5 tables filled at the time we were there, and he did not miss a beat and checked up on us often. Service was quick. We didn't wait that long for our food, maybe 10 minutes. We would go back again and it's a new outer sunset favorite spot.", "author": "winnie b."}
