{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-11", "description": "My boyfriend and I found this place while we were on vacation in San Francisco. We found the place on Yelp, and saw some good reviews it had so we decided to check it out, hoping they were playing the basketball game. They were playing it, so we found some seats at the bar to order our drinks. The first red flag we experienced here was the bartender. I went to the bathroom while my boyfriend ordered drinks. Immediately she told him \"Just make sure you close out by 9, because that's when my shift is over. I'm heading to a new job after this and I'm gonna make bank, but want to make sure I get my tips you know?\" Mind you, it was like, barely 8:15 at this time, and as customers, we didn't feel like that was an appropriate thing for her to be saying to us. We decided then that we would only order 1 drink from her.\n\nThere was a decent amount of people there, for the small space that the bar offers, and of the group of people, there was a 7-8 person group of guys that were very clearly Golden State fans, and had obviously spent a solid amount of time, and money, at this place. When the game was over, and the Warriors won, the particular group was ready to close out their tabs and move on to other places to celebrate. One guy in particular approached the bar to close out, and the bartender made a comment like, \"Oh how'd you get to have only a $20 tab, you made all your friends pay for everything?\" You could tell the guy was irritated by that. Fast forward about 10 minutes and he returned to the bar stating that she gave him the wrong debit card, to which the bartender then discovered that she had given his card to someone else, that had already left long before the game was over, and vis versa. The guy was pretty calm about it, considering a stranger now had his debit card, but definitely wanted an explanation and a solution. The bartender had ZERO customer service skills as she tried to tell him that \"It happens all the time\", \"You can cancel your card and get a new one for free\" and \"there's no need to get mad about it.\" He continued to explain that he just wanted to celebrate with friends, but now his only means of money was gone. She offered him a free shot, of which he did not get to choose, another guy came out to back up the bartender. They bartenders/employees basically told the guy to the \"get the F*** over it\" and by the end of it, the guy left not receiving any apology or real severance for the bar LOSING his debit card.\n\nWhen the group left, the male worker that jumped into the situation towards the end, was speaking with another male customer he must have already known, saying things about being ready to \"throw down\" with the guy and \"fight him if I need to.\" All around just very unprofessional people at this place.\n\nI'm not from the area, so I won't be returning here regardless, but if I was I would absolutely not go here again due to the customer service alone. The way they handled this situation was so poor - especially for people that work off tips.\n\nProceed with caution.", "author": "Nichole S."}

Owl Tree might be your spot. \n\nIt took me many visits over many years to figure out what exactly is going on here. You can tell this place used to be a dive bar simply by the setup. It's tiny inside, but has been gussied up with nice, dark wood, comfy-enough seats, a cool bar, and decent liquor selection. The cocktails on the menu don't reach up to craft-cocktail level, but they're adequately nicer than what you'd find in a dive. And the bartenders are friendly and familiar enough to give you that solid neighborhood bar feel. Which is a good thing. It's a lot more simple and straightforward than I gave it credit for. \n\nThe more I stop in, the more I enjoy this spot. No pretense, no bullshit, no fake-y hipster dive scene (which means less obnoxious people)... So there's an absence of things to dislike. And what's to like? My drinks taste good, the booze is relatively inexpensive for the quality and the locale. It's not cheap, strong well swill, but I prefer not to drink that shit anyway. I can get mid-shelf here and not pay exorbitant prices for it. I like. \n\nRecently met a friend here for a pre-dinner cocktail and it did not disappoint. Bartenders engaged in friendly banter.

I wasn't quite sure how the drinks would rank in comparison to this stunning space. \n\nIt's very dim and dark, yet very cozy and has a classic feel, very timeless. The photos posted on YELP don't do any justice. Go see it in person: it's a stunner. The crowd was more of my preference: no loud obnoxious people, and no wannabe hipsters, and rowdy college kids. We were the youngest crowd there, but we didn't feel out of place. There was another younger crowd who were slightly obnoxious just a tad for a moment, but you don't even notice with the setup. It wasn't overwhelmingly crowded, it's a small space and the areas filled up, but nothing crowded.. super loungy: makes you want to be here for awhile. I could imagine writers and other creative folk from the past going to a place like this just to unwind. \n\nWe were confined in our own cozy nook at the end where we enjoyed the drinks we ordered with some perfectly complimentary popcorn (mix of mostly stale but some crunchy ones which paired well with the drinks, some of the popcorn had a spicy aftertaste that was a delightful surprise.)\n\nI had my first mule ever and it was great although it wasn't your typical moscow mule. I loved how the drink 'My Mule' was one where you could customize it, so I got it with whiskey. I asked my cousin on his opinion since he's had mules before and he said it was right on. And my pineapple mojitio was great as well. The Mai Tai here is pretty strong though: not my cup of tea. The shot of whiskey was lovely, but I learned I don't like plain whisky unless it's cinnamon whiskey. My cousins got drafts and shots (combo) as well and they seemed to enjoy it.

But Owl Tree surprised me - pleasantly - in a different way. The dark wood interior and comfortable booths were homey and a welcome escape from the cold night air.

And the patrons were mostly young folks like me who all seemed to be there just to try something new.  \n\nDon't get me wrong. This is still a dive.

Fast forward three years, and we learned that the owner had died, the owls donated to a library (??) and now it's all glammed up, pumping music and attracting a douche-y B&T crowd, courtesy of the son.

First, they gutted the place then they did outside plumbing, then they put new walls, floor, sealing, light fixtures and tiles on the outside wall....  They kept their original bar counter.  I think they did really good job with the new decor.  I really like their wide dark wood panels on the wall, nice square sealing treatment with chandelierish lighting and outside owl tile work.  (I posted pictures)\n\nOnly thing is they lost their \"dive bar\" feel.  The price for the drinks went up (See the pictures of drink menu I posted).  They lost cozy dark owl's nest feel...They put all the owl collection in a glass case near the stairs... Good thing is they have better wine selections including my favorite J Pinot Noir.  They suppose to start to serve appetizer such as salamis and cold plates soon.\n\nThe new owner Rick Howard and George Karas who also own Harry's Bar and Bruno's dropped \"C Bobby's\" and now the bar is called \"Owl Tree\".

We were going to check out another bar around the corner, but they wouldn't let us in because my boyfriend wasn't \"up to dress code\" (which is BS, they let in another guy before us who was dressed in pretty much the same outfit...if you're going to have a dress code, you need to enforce it for everyone!).  We decided to try this bar since it was right there, and it was definitely a good choice!\n\nWe got there a little before 10 on a Friday night and it was already starting to get crowded.  We had to wait a bit for a place to sit and enjoy our drinks.  The downside to this bar is that it is pretty tiny (I think the capacity sign said like 70 people or something) so if you aren't sitting down, you definitely have people knocking into you trying to get from the entrance to the back of the bar, and it gets HOT if you aren't sitting near the door or a window.  This place has some nice \"mood lighting\" going on, and the music was audible but not too loud.  \n\nThe bartender is awesome!  My friend wasn't sure what she wanted, so she asked him to surprise her with a drink that had Baileys in it, lemme tell you she was NOT disappointed.  I ended up getting one for myself later!  I have to give him credit for being so quick as he is the only bartender it seems and still have the drinks turn out great, nice and strong and not watered down!

And I truly believe that my colleagues and I were meant to find Owl Tree!\n\nRewind back to Monday night. Wandering the Mission, looking for a cool bar (but not too cool or pretentious) that might serve food. Our initial destination was closed for a private party (and I'm sort of glad about this, as we went there another night and it wasn't so great), so we were just taking stock of the joints in the neighborhood. \n\nAfter coming to the conclusion that most divey bars in this neck of the woods don't serve food, we settled on Owl Tree. The sign outside looked promising and I like owls. Almost got a owl tattoo on my bum around Halloween time. I took this as a sign.\n\nSo glad we stopped in! Fell in love with the cocktail menu right away. Who could resist a blood orange margarita? FYI- blood orange is the new bacon. They also serve bubbly by the glass as well as Blue Moon on tap. The bartender even allowed me to bring in a spider roll from next door! Now you're speaking my language...\n\nThe best part about Owl Tree was the jams! Amazing tunage for sure. We definitely heard \"Shots\", \"Meet Me at the Hotel\" and quite possibly some Rhianna. Having too much fun to Shazam every song that came on.

Finally, one time we called the bartender out on it, and said that we came for and ordered the Jameson on tap, could we have some of that please. It took all of a quarter of a second longer. \n\nIts a cool bar inside- lots of dark wood, comfortable seating. Plenty of people around, and an odd selection of music playing, but not loud or crowded to the point where you couldn't sit around a table and make easy conversation all night over round after round of Jameson. \n\nMy issue came when I went to close my tab. They way overcharged us. By about 40%. Of course, your chances of disputing a tab at a crowded bar at 1:30 on a Saturday night are nonexistant.

Who'd ever want to drink there?\" Well, I should know better than to judge a book by it's cover in San Francisco, as I couldn't have been more wrong about this place.\n\nOn the outside, there's this smarmy looking mosaic owl that greets you. Perhaps because I walked by in the morning hours and it was crawling with undesirables begging for change right outside the front door, I formed the opinion that it was a total poop hole. But upon scoping the TL for a place to cap off the night, a friend and I decided to head inside and give it a shot.\n\nIt reminds me of the awkward, semi-attractive girl from high school. You'd see her every day, think she was interesting... but because she wore bright, baggy clothes, you never thought twice about how she looked naked. Then somewhere down the line, you run into her at the local coffee shop wearing nothing but a pair of Reebok workout pants and a sports bra... and you realize that she's a total babe with delicious curves and an onion booty to match. That's Owl Tree. \n\nThe inside of the bar is totally chic. Dark colors, exposed bricks, fancy bar stools, an upscale crowd, and more! I'd have never guessed this was how the inside looked based on the exterior of the building.\n\nThe specialty drinks were a bit on the pricey side and they were slightly above-average for my tastes. After trying one gin gimlet, I stuck with beer, which was fine by me.\n\nIf you get a chance, check out the 2nd floor. It's private and it'd make for a GREAT birthday spot.

I judged this place by the outside and had decided it was probably douchey. But I ended up really liking it! I'm not a fan of the collared shirt crowd, and yeah, about half the population had collars, but it wasn't annoying at all! The spikey haired men in the collared pin striped shirts maintained decorum. The drinks were a bit pricey but the classy environment and convenient location to my home made up for my pricey drinks. I had a few of their $10 Cazedores blood orange margaritas and plan on having more in the future. Quite tasty. \n\nBonus! I guess there is an upstairs room that you can reserve for private parties. If you sit facing the stair case you get to watch drunk girls fall down the stairs!!!! It's fantastic!! I watched a girl eat shit and it made my night. Not because she got hurt, which she didn't (or at least she pretended not to be in pain) but it's always funny to see a dressed up girl lack grace and get really embarrassed about it. Hypocrite? Yeah. I've totally been there. And I hope whoever witnessed it laughed! \nAnyways, if you are feeling pretty and don't wanna waste your perfect makeup artistry at Ha-Ra, then head over to Owl Tree. And if you just aren't feelin like drinking to Morrissey or The Ting Tings and want to indulge in some Top 40 from 1998-2009, then get your ass over to Owl tree and stop pretending to be such a hipster!", "author": "Liz M."}

Much like Mabel Choate recalling that Jerry Seinfeld stole her marble rye, I remembered. I remembered coming here over a year ago and not liking it. I remembered the way-too-old-for-that-kind-of-foolishness old men cat calling my female friends and stumbling over each other. I remembered the smell. I remembered the bar did me wrong -- and it was doing it again.\n\nMy group had reserved the upstairs for a private get together. We were planning on going into that piece 70+ deep. We needed room. I was amongst the first to arrive and inquired about the room. There was no room. Even though the room had been reserved for weeks, the person who put it together forgot to hire a bartender for the night and, yeah. No room. And then we started coming. As more and more of my group piled into the small bar, I began to get irritable. As other, random people piled in because the bar wasn't closed to outside traffic, I got heated. By the time I asked the doorman to help with the crowd and not let anymore folks in (the fire code was a thing of the past) and found out that despite the 'yes' and head nod he gave me, he was still packing the bar with more and more folks, I was nearly homicidal. Deplorable service. There's just no excuse for any of the snafus from the evening. This is what happens when I refuse to listen to my instincts.\n\nSo... three stars? Yep. The bartender was smoking hot (sorry; she was/is) and made some mean martinis. She did the best with the hand she was dealt and I need to give props where due. Despite the intolerable crowd, she didn't skimp on the booze and the first drink was as potent as the last. That's professionalism.", "author": "Johnny T."}

Yet considering I'd already had a couple of deliciously tangy cocktails earlier in the evening at Thermidor, I was certainly in the mood for more. Not too many more, mind, I didn't want to be carried out of the place - thankfully Alex S and I left clear-headed enough to find our way back to the hotel on our own, and considering we had a self-confessed combined awful sense of direction, that was no mean feat. (Let's just have another virtual fist-pump for that moment, mister!)\n\nBack to the cocktail in all its sharp, acidic splendour. I'm always pleasantly surprised when a margarita comes in a tall glass as opposed to a martini one (I'm all kinds of clumsy with those bad boys, and it feels like you're getting better value for your buck anyway) and it was delicious. I'd highly recommend it to anyone like me who prefers a caipirinha to a cosmo and likes a bit of bite in their booze. A big hats off to Noelle who had us all completely enthralled with her cool as a cucumber, sweet as sugar demeanour - I'd be a dreadful bartender, I'd crumble under the pressure of one customer, let alone a floor that had been hired out to a substantial group. She was swift, deft and did not drop her smile once. \n\nMeanwhile the place is quirky, and you already know how much I dig quirky. Whether it's the retro 80s movies in the background (hello, my perfect bar!) or the jukebox switching from Metallica to Shakira in the blink of an eye, it's charming, it's unusual and it's a bar I'd happily return to in a flash, for the purposes of discussing British vs. American television or anything else.

I absolutely loved the decoration and atmosphere of the bar. Like other people said, it's like a dive bar. It has very nice furnishing and super comfy leather ottomans.\n\nThe upstairs bar sucks because it's tiny and does have a lot of alcohol. We should have gone downstairs for our drinks but we were too lazy. You can also rent out the upstairs for parties and events. Overall the drinks weren't that expensive. A shot of patron was only $8. Another note about the upstairs area, there really wasn't any service available. There was no menu as in some of the pictures and there was definitely no snacks or food. Also, they don't give you water, you have to buy their bottles of water. I think it's $3 for a bottle.\n\nThe people there were really nice and also very hip.

Must find a place for a drink...fast.  Everywhere we turned was either at capacity or $45 at the door.  Think fast...think fast...think fast.  Take a cab and head downtown.\n\nI recall in my memory of past drunken evenings of a fun dive bar situated on Post.  Music is ok, drinks are good, and bartenders are fast.  We escape our cab and run to the door (20 minutes till midnight), and $10 cover! Score! We gladly pay, proceed on through, squeeze our way upstairs with one thing on our minds...get to the bar...we are thirsty!  First cran/vodka of the night down my throat and warming up my tummy (10 minutes till midnight).  I look around, it's getting thick in here. I need another drink, but bartender has quite a few people ahead of me.  Where is our friend Matt? There's 5 minutes left till countdown? We succumb to our fate (champagne-less counting down from 20 now), and accept our next drink will come at the start of 2010.  \n\n\"Ten, nine, eight,...\"\n\nMatt appears...are those 6 champagne glasses in his hands?\n\n\"Seven, six,....\"\n\nGrab one, and pass one.

Or should I say, \"was\" a classic dive bar. \n\nI came here saturday night for a few beers and was surprised when I entered. Someone has completely renovated this bar. It has a new dark wooden interior, a new bar, two leather booths, and a back lounge area. Plus a private room upstairs. This was once a San Francisco dive bar where we drank jack and cokes and smoked marlboro reds.  There were old business cards tacked up behind the bar, and people casually met here for cocktails, conversation, and to play around with the old jukebox. \n\nNow this place is like Fabio meets Casey Kasem. There were two pumped up italian dudes wearing black t-shirts two sizes too small behind the bar. This attracts some gushing women cliental. Overall it was nice to see that the bar was revamped. \n\nBut minus two stars for the worst bar mix I have ever heard. They mixed eighties hair metal with hip hop from the early nineties like Warren G's track \"Regulate, (not that bad), but inexplicitly went from playing this track, to Warrant's \"Cherry Pie,\" and then played \"Ice, Ice, Baby,\" by Vanilla Ice.

The obligatory domestic beers pop up more than once. They have one or two craft beers in bottles, which should placate artisan beer snobs. \n\nBut the music is the real tragedy. I can only imagine that, with the bizarre transitions in tempo, someone brought their ipod shuffle into the bar, plugged in an audio cable to some speakers, then let the worst mix of songs bounce off the walls of the place. The party that I came with heard Rick Springfield's \"Jesse's Girl\" three times in an hour. There was also flamenco music wafting through the air before it gave way to \"Ooops, I Did it Again\" by Brittany Spears. The volume was bumped up much too loud for casual conversation, so patrons have to vehemently bark over one another like rabid canines. \n\nAnd why did they start playing Reese Witherspoon's \"Just Like Heaven\" on the two televisions after they had been showing UFC for an hour?

I had the opportunity to talk to the particular bouncer she spoke of last night, who in fact (after finding out about her ridiculous Yelp review) is pressing charges against SUSAN M. for PUNCHING HIM IN THE FACE after he told her the upstairs was closed and she could finish her drink downstairs in the remaining 20 minutes that the bar was open. She refused to go downstairs MULTIPLE times and only AFTER she punched him TWICE in the face did he grab her and call the police.

I mean the original had so much character, and I kind of enjoyed being the poser hipster sort trying to be part of a really cool dive scene (calling it a scene just proves why I am a poser, at least in these circumstances).\n\nAnyway, the place closed after Bobby passed away, sometime went by and then a few months ago the guys who own Harry's (and now Bruno's) took over the joint. If you know how Bruno's used to be and have been there in the last year or so, you can see why I was ready to not like this place (in short, they sort of sucked the soul out Bruno's but it's more packed than ever, go figure).\n\nSo it was with some apprehension that I finally paid a visit to the reborn establishment. The interior has been cleaned up, but they have kept the general sensibility of the space intact, sadly minus all the great owl memorabilia that made The Owl Tree so legendary in the first place; there is a nice glass-encased memorial which does honor the history, so I'll give them some props.\n\nNo jukebox, a huge disappointment, and see my previous review for why that is so.\n\nThey are building out the upstairs, so that's intriguing, a plus for renovation without too much loss of integrity.\n\nFinally, the drinks. I suppose they are priced around what they should be for the neighborhood, cocktails ranging between $8-10. It's not for the old timers, that's for sure (maybe they could offer a local discount?). I went with their Gin & Tonic, served with Junipero and with an individual bottle of Fever Tree Tonic, so that you could mix to your own perfection. Yeah, I was kind of impressed.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Now that I've lived in SF for over 10 years, I guess I'm starting to develop a sense of time and character. Sure, it was sad to see the original bar close. But you know what, time goes on, and while this isn't a Phoenix rising, it still is an Owl.", "author": "Nish N."}

While gallivanting around town and trying to suck this fair city dry of its alcoholic contents, I passed this little dive bar and was mighty curious. But as luck would have it, Rye was call my name and we went there instead. The next time I returned to SF, I really wanted to try this corner little dive, but sadly, due to Bobby's passing it was no mas and I never got to try the little hoo hoo hoo house that peaked my fancy. Bummer.\n\nA couple years later and a few nights ago, I was out on the town showing a few new CMs the drinking ropes and a friend suggested the Owl Tree. I thought, \"Surely You Jest! Not Theeeee Owl Tree?!?! I Thought It was Closed!?!\" (Actually I don't think in Shakespeare, but blame my fingers, that's what came out) Sure enough, it was the same Owl Tree location, but sadly, nowhere near as cool or divey as the original.\n\nWith that said, however, the place is nice, but because I have an incredible sense of loyalty toward shit holes and dive bars with old men sipping bourbon, this place didn't really make me happy in the toes or the pants. Instead, it's just a nice, glam little bar in the middle of the Tenderloin and I think tourists would find it Neat-O and a welcome surprise in an otherwise sketch neighborhood. \n\nWill I be going back, sure, it's a bar, they serve alcohol so what's not to like.

I adore the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nSo I've decided to move into the upstairs of the Owl Tree. I could not have picked more fantastic decor for my little apartment than burgundy shag carpets and roaring 20's dancing girls on the wallpaper. One of the many reasons why this bar is so fantastic is that boys have to use the bathroom downstairs, but girls get to ascend such a fabulous staircase to get to our special little upstairs powder room (you can tell Bobby keeps it clean and pretty because he's old school and we're ladies) that it could be an apartment all its own. My apartment. It makes you feel like a princess. It really does. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to note about the Owl Tree: if you're going to be throwing back Ketel One like it ain't no thang (because call drinks are very reasonably priced) make sure you eat some dinner before you get to the bar. Because they will bring a neverending supply of snack mix (Gardetto's, I think, which is not vegan in case you were wondering) right to your table (which is surrounded by some *fabulous* vinyl chairs that I'm sure they stole from my grandparents' den in the 70's) and you will not be able to stop with the snack mix.

The barback guy brings them over and says...\"18.\" I asked him for clarification - these were $9 each. And they were the second-worst Manhattan I've ever had in SF (only the Asian girl at Hyde Out pours them worse). Painfully awful.\n\nNobody with soul walked through the door for the next half hour, they had a Blu-Ray dvd player running the original Ocean's 11 (because nothing shows off high-def like a film from 1960) and, except for \"When the Leveee Breaks,\" the music stayed atrocious. Also they have one toilet. So there will always be some uncomfortable Indian family in there helping each other poop, or whatever the hell all those Indians were doing in there for ten minutes.\n\nWe pounded our sticky-sweet Manhattans and went to Whiskeys, where you trade a bit of class, of which I have precious little as it is, for proper drinking.\n\nIt's a shame.

The bar was full, a couple of the tables were taken, that was about it.  It was a calm but fun atmosphere (hard not to be fun when there's hundreds of owls scowling at you).  The bartenders were attentive, fun and mixed a good drink.  They gave you Chex Mix and little wet naps when you were about halfway through your first drink.  I went a few more times after that, and it was pretty much the same.  Once the owner was there with his crabby little dog.  He yelled at the bartenders and they were good-humored about it.  He thought I was sitting at a table with 3 women whose large boobies were hanging out all over the place and gave me the round I was buying free of charge.  He was annoyed when I went to sit down with my boyfriend and our male friend.  We still got great service, good drinks  and Chex Mix, though.\n\nAnd then I went a couple weeks ago.  The drinks had grown in price and shrunk in size by at least half.  The place had many more people in it, almost packed, and only ONE bartender.  The bartender didn't seem much interested in anyone who wasn't sitting at the bar (we weren't), but was somewhat friendly when he finally got around to us.  No Chex Mix, it didn't look like anyone got any, though I saw it sitting there.  The crowd was mostly middle-aged yuppies who looked annoyed.  I'm not the kind of person that really goes to bars/clubs that are filled with young and \"beautiful,\" so I don't mind the middle-aged yuppies, just the drink prices that tend to come with them.\n\nSo...I might try again on a weeknight, but I don't know.  I think people are more aware of its existence than they were when I first went and it's turning into a normal FiDi overpriced tourist trap with runoff from Ruby Skye (ew).

It's a travesty that they still call it the Owl Tree.  I'd guess that if everyone who rated the bar before the previous owner Bobby died were to update their ratings, this place would be hovering around two stars.\n\n[EDIT:  :(   Rest in Peace, Bobby.  :(  ]\n\nI like this place.  Going there and ordering a drink from Bobby gives me a thrill that I imagine is not dissimilar from the thrill one gets from walking into a cage with a trained lion.  It is unlikely that the lion will rend your body the moment you turn your back, but it is a very real possibility.  Yes, the owl collection is dazzling, but see my review of the evil Bohemian Club across the street, note their insignia--the sinister Owl--and then go to Bobby's Owl Tree Bar and look just above and to the left of Bobby's cash register.  Do you see what I see?  Now I don't know if Bobby is a Bohemian Club member or even a sympathizer, or simply a small business owner trying to increase his revenue; I haven't had the nerve to ask.  All I know is, be careful what you order in Bobby's bar.  I've seen this lion snap at many an ignorant drinker for ordering something stupid like a \"Manhattan on the rocks,\" or Jagermeister.  As for myself, I never, ever go wrong with a super dry martini, and I always exit the Owl Tree the same way I enter it--facing the bar, with my wits about me.", "author": "Mynameisdavid M."}

Going to Owl Tree on my birthday was a perfect way to make the night special. Owl Tree is on a corner and from the outside you can see a mosaic of an owl and another cute owl on the sign above the door. The bar was full but didn't feel crowded. There is seating all along the bar and also a little lounge area with short tables. There are TVs for watching games and an upstairs room for private parties. We sat at the lounge area and felt nice and cozy. It was a nice escape from the cold. I ordered the pomegranate martini. This drink is pretty and festive with a bright red color. It was chilled just right and went down smooth. I'm not sure about all of the ingredients but it was sweet (but not too sweet) and had a hint of lemon.

Perhaps because I'm a masochist, I enjoy the Owl Tree. I like the website because it makes my brain hurt, so much going on to take in at once. They have a live webcam tho, which could be fun if you are a creep and like to watch from afar.", "author": "Colleen B."}

Now it's full of cool people, the service has improved, the pretzels are crispy, and it just doesn't feel right. At least they haven't changed the cd's in the jukebox. My favorite owl is the big white one in the nook all the way in the back. Bobby, RIP.", "author": "Josh K."}

Every owl in here (wooden, Tiffany, macrame, stuffed, metal, etc. etc.) has its own life story, at least in my head.

There is just nothing special about it.  The tile outside is really cool.  The booths inside are comfy.  Its not that its a bad place...its just it doesn't offer anything better than the next place.  The old movies being played on big screen TVs is kind of weird given the place appears to be going for a more classy look (decor).  The music is also confusing; its all over the place.  I do like the bar snacks.  The bathroom is very clean and nicely decorated.  The actual bar is very small and can get crowded and seatless very fast/easily.", "author": "Rise G."}
