There are unfortunately not enough people who frequent this excellent restaurant, which is good for me because that just means there's less of a wait for me!\n\nThe pupusas themselves are delicious and unique. They're always made to order - you can even watch the ladies make them behind the counter if you want! I always get a variety of different flavors, with my favorite being any sort of cheese and pork combination. Even though I consider myself a big eater after 2 of these usually I'm full. At $3 a pupusa, you really can't beat the price or the quality.\n\nI wish it was busier as this place definitely deserves more business.

I was super excited to have pupusas as I don't get out much to the Mission for it, so it was a treat! \n\nIt's a quaint little place, divey, no frills, but the food looked good and the place felt promising. It took a moment for my friend and I to be noticed by the staff but we just seated ourselves (guess that's how it goes here.) \n\nWe sat for a few solid minutes without receiving any menus, so my friend ended up having to go and grab it (ugh -_-) Then we waited a while until they came to take our order. \n\nThe staff at Elsy's are very stoic and nonchalant. Like a robot. No enthusiasm, but b*tch face they had down. Our drinks and chips & salsa (only $.99! I liked the salsa- is spicy!) came out in a timely manner, however the pupusas took a little longer, and the side of fried plantains took forever and the side of beans and sour cream- EVEN LONGER! Also, when I was trying to get their attention for extra ice and proper to-go containers it was pretty much a fail. \n\nBOTTOM LINE. Food was good, but service was painfully slow. Was going to give this place 3 stars, but while writing this, remembering how unexceptional and disappointing the service was, I'm knocking off another star.", "author": "Victoria T."}

I only went because La Taqueria had a long line and i was super hungry. I normally enjoy pupusas in sf too, this was my first and last time ever coming here. I was better off waiting for La Taqueria or going across the street to Red Cafe, that have amazing food and service. The Lady at cashier needs to have training on how to Greet, Treat and Assure their customers are satisfied, I left so upset. First off i asked for Spinach/Cheese w/Revuelta and she said they don't have spinach but they do have Zucchini, i was like okay i'll take Zucchini/Cheese and a Revuelta. ( I saw a cash only sign) but i also saw a Visa/Master Card and told her i only brought my card she said it's fine they just have a surcharge (which is fine) but she looked annoyed at that. Plus i asked for water & looks like it rubbed her the wrong way. Anyways, I sit and wait for my food about 20 min and when she gives it to me it's to go, when i've been at a table and have a dinning cup with water, but that's besides the point. So i start eating my zucchini pupusa and when i cut through the second ITS ONLY CHEESEEE???!! i'm like ???? confused at this point, i call her over and let her know it's only cheese?? she said yeah ( and has a sarcastic/unpleasant look ) you ordered cheese. And i told her No, i asked for zucchini and cheese and a revuelta total of two pupusas, but i would NEVER order just cheese??? that's like a wannabe quesadilla... so she continues to say yes you said cheese and i tell her again no, i know i mentioned to you Revuelta, so she just has this look of , is that all?? and i look at her and tell her \" this is not what i ordered\" ( can i even show her proof??) no, because the receipts given here don't say what you order.. then she just looks and walks away?? just walks away leaving me upset knowing i didn't order a plain cheese pupusa and FORGET WHAT THE CUSTOMER says because \"I\" employee is right and don't care about what customers feel and if i was wrong i don't care to fix it ? Like what could have fixed it here was even saying a \"I'm sorry, maybe i didn't hear you or understand \" \" sorry for the mix up, here let me even get u a zucchini replacement instead but instead she walks away, leaving me upset.

And although I can't vouch for their ethnicity, just the fact that entire families including kids were enjoying their meals, was enough to convince me to try this out.\n\nWe sat at the counter and right away our waiter came over. Having absolutely no idea what Salvadorian cuisine/food is like, we asked him what he would recommend: he then told us that the pupusas here were the most-wanted item on the menu. Pupusas, we learned, are blown-up tortillas with filling inside. They're quintessential Salvadorian! So, we opted for these and then also ordered the Salvadorian Steak, which comes with a pepper-onion sauce and is served with rice and mashed beans. As a drink, I ordered Tamarindo.\n\nEventually the cheerful music would start - not unsimilar to the traditional Mexican tunes - and we knew we were in for a real treat.\n\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed our visit here.

Ten minutes later, in came our papusas and we were so excited to try it. It tastes like a closed up fried quesadilla, maybe a little thicker but it was so good.

We walk in, and my friend asks if they have soup, and the cute, kind employee says yes.  We sit wherever we want, we get menus, and the cute waiter guy takes our drink order.  I cannot emphasize how amazing the customer service was!  \n\nI ordered the chicken soup, my friends each ordered three papusas, all of a different variety.  We also ordered chips and salsa which cost a measly $.79 and came with refills.  The salsa was unique, not super spicy, but had a yummy taste to it.  My soup came in a big bowl with fresh, warm tortillas, and a side of rice which I dumped in the bowl.  I took the chicken out the bowl and shredded it myself and tossed it back in, and once I added the Tapatio and squeezed the lime in, I was on cloud 9.  I tasted the papusas my friends had ordered, and they were so delectable, fresh, filled with melting cheese.  One friend ordered a side of queso fresco, which our waiter informed us is house-made.  \n\nFive stars, five freaking stars for Elsy's.", "author": "Sarah B."}

They have reasonable prices and have great friendly service.  The pupusas here are really good, but what I enjoy the most here is the Salpicon. \n\nSalpicon is a dish where beef is cut up into a million tiny little pieces and has a lemony flavor, and is served with sides of rice and beans.  Most restaurants (and my mother) put the beef in a blender and let it shred the beef for what seems like hours.  This method sucks the flavor out of the beef and you end up getting dried meat--ELSY'S does not do this!  Their meat tastes great.  \n\nIf you are coming here get pupusas, of course, but also try the salpicon.  It is really, really, really good here.", "author": "David C."}

She stands behind the front window everyday using her magic hands to pat, massage and roll a hand full of masa into fresh, juicy pupusas. I met up with my Yelp buddies David N and Kent P for brunch this morning and the pupusa woman was there working her magic, pimp slapping my order of fat pupusa. The place is a straight hole in the wall with an open kitchen to bring about a quaint, homey dining atmosphere. There were a few hanging Salvadorian artifacts including a display of colon while the humble place is furnished by large tables to accommodate large families and their whopping bowls of soup that looked straight up hearty and delicious.\n\nWith David and Kent both had mixed combination of pupusas at $2 each, I ordered a chicharron con queso pupusa ($2) to compliment a bowl of menudo with pigs feet ($8.50). We all agreed that their pupusa were humongous with excellent fresh masa texture and cheese, but the meat was not visible or enough to let its taste stand out. The slaw was not as crunchy as expected while the red salsa was too watery and watered down. Luckily, my experience was dramatically different from my brunch companions as my soup was excellent. It was enriched with large thick cuts of tripes, chunky vegetables, and bulky pigs feet with a side of cilantro, red peppers, onions, and two thick masa tortillas. The combination of it all was flavorful and savory, just perfect for today's cool rainy weather. Additionally, I also thought the fresh warm masa tortillas were bread-like and delicious. I can literally eat them for fun all day long.\n\nService-wise, this is a family operation where everyone, aside from the pupusa maker, has a role in cooking and managing the tables. This resulted in slower service and things can get overwhelming in the presence of large groups. Anyone who wishes to dine in should anticipate some wait time within different stages of the dining experience.

I get pupusas revueltas, to go, every single time I am in the Mission.  I get enough to have a meal and then to take home. They might taste better on the reheat.\n\nLike others have noted, this place is a dingy hole in the wall but the woman who makes pupusas in the window, working off a gigant pile of dough, shaping them, slapping them on the grill, filling them. . .. seeing them made, feeling the good nature of the women who work there, also of the guys working at the cash registers much of the time. . . everything about this place if wonderful.\n\nI never try anything else, but I always want to. It is often busy, often families.\n\nI love the pupusas. Next time, I'm going to try the salpicon, a soup another yelper raves about. Sounds very tasty. It's just that when I am in the Mission, I eat burritos, which is why the pupasas tend to come home with me. I'm already full when I get to Elsy's.\n\nDon't be intimidated if you are a gringo, don't let the cosy Latino vibe keep you out. People are people, and when people are gatehred together over good food, they are nicer than usual.\n\nThese folks are very very very nice.", "author": "Shaniqua A."}

I have been to some famous ones in the city but Elsy's pupusas always come out on top.  I love them for the fact that the pupusas are kind of crispy on top and bottom ( kind of reminds me of a good pot sticker's crispiness) while my favorite filling of revuelta has the best combination of pork, beans and melted cheese.  I also love their atole de elote....I went again this evening and the owner's son was there helping out and provide an excellent and thoughtfull service..Thanks Jimmy.", "author": "m c."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-16", "description": "We couldn't figure out how the service worked, so we just grabbed a menu and seated ourselves.  Apparently that wasn't a problem, and we ordered at the cashier.  At the front display there were some amazing looking dishes, specifically the FRIED CHICKEN.  I asked the guy at the register and he told me it wasn't on the menu yet, but you must do yourself a favor and try it.  It was great!  Not greasy or dry at all.  Who'd have thought you could find such good fried chicken at this place?  \n\nNext time I come here, I might just skip the pupusas all together, as good as they were.  I feel bad for giving this secret away, lest I find myself waiting in some ridiculous line in the future, but the dude who worked there was so nice, I just want to see the business get recognition.", "author": "Ahma G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-09", "description": "The naughty slap-slap of masa enhanced the ambiance of this quaint little shop in which one can find rather wonderful Salvadorean cuisine.  In my three-or-so visits, I ordered the combo with two pork/beans/veggie pupusas, rice and beans.  The 'pusas were very good, coupled with a helping of lettuce and further enhanced by the bottled red sauce.  As there is a bevvy -- a veritable slew -- of Central and South American restaurants, it's hard to say that Elsy's is the best, but it's certainly worthwhile when you get the urge for authentic pupusas.", "author": "Victor R."}

It's a hole-in-the-wall establishment with a big personality.  The staff is super friendly and what's really cool is that you can watch them make the traditional and delicious pupusas.  They put a healthy amount of cheese in the pupusas, which I appreciate.  The price is right as well.  Their quesadillas are also excellent.  I go here all the time and the staff knows me and my friends by name.", "author": "Mike B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-16", "description": "The pupusas are really are lacking, but it's close to work and often you just crave something cheesy and greasy.  My last order was a caldo de res, which I grew up with at home. Not only did they forget to make my order when I called it in, but the two women were incredibly rude when I reminded them of the order and asked how long it would be so I could just come back. As this is the second time I've recieved attitude from them, I will not be stepping back in. There are much better places in San Francisco for pupusas.", "author": "C. G."}
