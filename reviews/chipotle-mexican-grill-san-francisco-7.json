I work nearby and avoid coming here whenever possible and would rather walk further down to the Chipotle by target/metreon. \nFirst, food is the same, Chipotle standard. However, the wrapping skills are the worst here from the burrito wrapping to the foil wrapping. Your burrito  has a higher chance of exploding here than elsewhere. This has happened to 3 of my coworkers who came to this location myself included, which ended up leaking through the bag (did not even get to the burrito it already unraveled, and it's never that stuffed). \nSecond, service absolutely sucks. No one greets you, 80% of the front staff look like they're about to have a throw down. One guy refused to help my coworker get another burrito after writing too hard on the foil it ripped through and ink got on the tortilla. He refused because it was \"really busy\". They don't know their prices (or they're trying to charge more intentionally) because I order the same things and get different prices. Order a small drink charged for a large. Hmm. \nThird, I have had hair twice fall in my food from here which marks it the last time of me coming to this location. \n\nThis place really gives Chipotle a bad name. I'd get rid of almost all of the front workers if I could. It's filled with young staff, on the edge of ghetto. \n\nThe manager of this location clearly does not give a crap.

On multiple occasions where I have asked for double meat, this one specific guy will literally walk my order the entire way and enforce the \"double meat\" charge to the point where he seriously shouts at the cashier to do so. It's as if he has some crusade against customers.\n\nWhen these issues happen more than a few times in a row, I actually spend a few minutes going through their horribly designed online form to give them feedback.

If I were forced to eat the SAME food every day for the rest of my life... it'd be CHIPOTLE. And you know what? I'm okay with that. In fact I would probably die happy.

T___T\n\nAnyway, four stars instead of five stars because yeah for a Chipotle this location is slightly suckier than others. The quality of food is still the same but sometimes they skimp.. even when I smile extra big and pause after they scoop the ingredient and before I say the next one.\n\nI always get the burrito bowl (less calories hehe and more filling hehe). I've tried the chicken, steak, barbacoa, sofritas..all of them except for the carnitas (not a real big fan of pork and I can't make that commitment to try). Steak is honestly the best one. It taste like real steak and not that salty fake tasting ones in the taquerias on Mission, no offense. The fluffy cilanto WHITE rice is so divine..not the brown one (yechhhh) and I've tried both. But kudos to Chipotle for trying to be healthy. I skip the beans (don't like the mushy texture). Then I get the mild salsa, the corn, the cheese (sometimes I don't to watch my calories lol), and the lettuce!\n\nI say \"no!\" to that $2 guacamole. The guacamole at chipotle is bland..Remember you can get everything on the side...including the tortilla!\n\nI know literally everything there is to know about Chipotle. They should seriously higher me to be an ambassador. I challenge anyone to fight me in a Chipotle quiz off. Yes, I am that confident and in love with Chipotle. Even this location is worth it for lunch, given the low ratings.\n\nSide note: There is another Chipotle at the Metreon which is probably like a 5 minute walk MAX.

Over the weekend, the boy and I were doing some shopping and decided to have lunch here.\n\nFor starters, the line was ridiculously and painfully long. The employees working the food line were taking forever to make burritos and tacos. When I finally got to order, I decided on some steak tacos. BAD DECISION! After just a few bites, I could tell something didn't taste quite right. The steak wasn't completely cooked! I ended up just picking at the tacos and eating everything but the steak. Also, the rice was sticky. Since when is rice, at any Mexican restaurant, sticky? Ugh.\n\nI know all Chipotles aren't this bad but, if you are even thinking of stopping by this location, just keep on walking. And if you MUST stop here then AVOID the steak! Or at least make sure it's completely cooked.\n\nLast time I go anywhere else but the Mission for a burrito. Lesson learned.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I thought he was kidding and he was like \"nah seriously you thought I was playin? We don't have brown rice. Do you want white rice?\" So I was like okay... Got the white rice, asked for both chicken and steak. He have me around 5-10 pieces of each. I hardly call that a bowl at all. Later down the line, I heard him asking what the rice situation was... Apparently there was more brown rice in the pot and he was too lazy to get it for me. The checkout lady forgot to give my boyfriend his tortilla which was on the side and after I asked for water cups and never got them, she saw me standing there and was like \"uhh need anything else?\" in one of the rudest tones I've ever heard. It's not my fault you forgot the water cups. \n\nIt is not only dirty, but terribly slow. There was so much food leftover with less an hour to mall closing.

After a stressful flight in from LA and a less than pleasant setback on Bart, my husband and I were famished to say the least. I was in a horrible mood and just wanted some food asap. We were staying at the Mosser and came down to the mall food court for convenience. It was a very busy food court and we decide maybe some Ramen would be good because of the cold night. It ended badly when the Ramen place wouldn't seat us for and hour despite the fact that there was only 2 folks ahead of us, that wouldn't have been so bad has it not been for the horrible customer service. We immediately made the decision to go next door to Chipotle. Despite having a very long line it moved very quickly. My husband wanted steak, by the time we arrived to order they were out. The fella that was at the head of the line then told Jovan. Jovan was working the cash register as well as helping out in every area that needed help. He immediately came over and apologized for the inconvenience and went about doing everything in his power to not only give us wonderful customer service but to get the food out to us as soon as possible. His great attitude and attempts to accommodate us really stood out to us.
