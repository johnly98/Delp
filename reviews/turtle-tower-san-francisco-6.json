I got your standard beef pho bowl and thought it was okay. The broth didn't have too much flavor and depth (it tasted watered down), and the beef was a bit overcooked. The noodles weren't particularly memorable either - overall a little underwhelming.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this is northern-style pho, where they don't serve greens, bean sprouts, and other toppings. They just have cilantro and green onion, which are already mixed in the bowl, so if you look forward to the assortment of toppings with you pho, I would skip this place.\n\nThe portion size was small in comparison to what you may be used to, and the prices were very SF ($10 for a small and $11 for a large). The service was quick and accommodating though, which was nice. \n\nI won't be back, but if you work in the area and need a quick lunch spot, Turtle Tower is worth a try.\n\nTips:\n- They take reservations for groups of 6+.\n- I arrived at 11:30 and the place was empty.

However, it's quite delicious, and there's always room for a change of pace. I would say that you should go with their two most famous dishes - pho ga (chicken pho) and bun cha ha noi (pan-fried pork patties with dipping sauce and noodles and veggies). You've probably seen the latter dish on Bourdain's Parts Unknown, and you won't be disappointed with this dish overall. Yes, you're going to be getting flat noodles instead of the usual thin, circular ones you're used to in your pho, and the broth is much more simple and clean than other pho places. Skip the appetizers though, because imperial rolls are almost $4 per roll (not worth the price for so little food), so you don't really want to waste your wallet or stomach space on that when large bowls of pho or rice plates are about $11-13 (great deal for the portion sizes, and noodles are never overcooked). Parking is pretty easy on Sundays because no one really drives all the way out to the TL to eat. The #4 (pho bo dac biet) will also cure whatever ails you. Again though, you're going to get something much different than you're used to with large pieces of flat, tenderized beef instead of the beef balls and tougher cuts you might get elsewhere. The tripe in this bowl though is absolutely killer. You'll thank me later.", "author": "Danny C."}

Finally came this Saturday around 1pm with no wait. \n\nRelative to the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, this one is surprisingly more spacious and seemingly newer. I think this is reflected in the price you are paying for their noodles (about $9 for a small bowl and about $10 for a large). \n\nI settled on their chicken pho, which was comforting, flavorful, and surprisingly light. Tasting the broth, you can tell it has a lot of chicken flavor without too much of the salty MSG flavor typical of most pho places. The medium-sized flat rice noodles were also fresh and soft. The chicken they use is already pulled off the bone and very tender. While I think it lacks some salt, it tasted great once I  ate it with some of the saltier soup. They don't give much chicken, but if you happen to want more, you can add on a small side of it for about $5. \n\nIf you hate cilantro, this chicken pho probably isn't for you, however. The soup is super yummy because they put it in the soup for flavor. \n\nI also happened to try some of my mom's rare beef pho. Their rare beef is interestingly made--it's more of a flattened rare beef patty than slices. However, it still is very fresh. I could definitely taste the beef flavor and it was still super tender. \n\nOverall, both the chicken and rare beef pho here is pretty awesome. You can tell their soups are very fresh and made with great ingredients; they're surprisingly light too. I think they're great for a cold day or a post-hangover meal. For $9 it's a bit pricey for the smaller portion size, but I guess you're paying for more quality ingredients and the more comfortable/uncramped seating in the city.", "author": "Clarissa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-28", "description": "TLDR - Yes to the chicken pho! Their broth is amazing, but prices are more than what I'm used to paying for pho\n\nI've always been loyal to variations of beef pho and have never really ordered chicken pho before, but since Turtle Tower is known for their chicken pho, I obviously had to go that route. If you usually stick with the beef version at pho spots, I'd definitely recommend switching it up. Their chicken pho is amazing! And you know it's their specialty because it's more expensive than their beef phos.\n\nUnlike most pho places you might be used to, they don't serve the usual plate of bean sprouts and basil and there's no hoisin or sriracha on the table. Instead, they're known for their Northern/Hanoi-style pho, which has wider rice noodles and is served with just jalapeno and lime on the side and chili sauce on the table. The menu says you can order the pho with the better-known thin vermicelli noodles (bun) or egg noodles (mi), but when one of my friends tried to order hers with the thin noodles, the man taking our order (whom I assume was the owner) was VERY insistent that she get the wide noodles, up to the point that my friend gave up and another friend decided to porridge instead of pho. Why do they give the option of ordering other noodles if they actually won't let you do it?!?\n\nI was originally going to order just the normal Pho Ga ($8), but one of my friends ordered the Pho Tai Lan (beef pho with veggies) and asked for chicken instead of beef, which I didn't realize you could do. If you want veggies other than just green onion in your pho, ask for #5 with chicken! Just know that it does cost an extra $1 for chicken instead of beef, which I didn't know until we got the bill. Their pho in general is a little on the pricey side for pho ($8-10 for a small), but still much more affordable than the average lunch you'd find in SF.\n\n* PHO GA LAN (small $9.75, large $11.25)\n[chicken, celery, carrot, onion & leek noodle soup]\nDefinitely one of the better bowls of pho I've had. I can't really compare their chicken pho with other places since I've never ordered chicken pho elsewhere, but it was better than a lot of beef pho I've had. The broth was light but sooo flavorful and addicting! There had to be MSG in it, but I didn't find it dehydrating - and I drank my entire bowl of broth plus maybe half of one of my friends'. In fact, I finished my broth before finishing the chicken or the noodles. The chicken was boiled and tender and there was a decent amount of it. The noodles were on the soft side though and a little too silky for my liking. \n\nThey DO take credit cards here (not sure if there's a minimum). The location isn't in the best of areas (helloo Tenderloin), but don't let that deter you from coming here!

My boyfriend got their chicken pho with gizzards and I got grilled pork with the chicken soup. He shared some of his and I honestly don't know why it's so loved. It tasted like any other chicken pho to me, which is usually bland for my taste. But maybe it's just because I usually add a lot of sauce that I couldn't get on board with the chicken pho. Although I must say the rice with the soup was really good. \n\nThe pork was I would say mediocre. I've had better grilled pork at Kevin's and other places. The meat was more on the dry side and didn't have much taste. I had to pour all the sauce that comes with it to give some taste to the dish. Also, the amount of pork that comes with it was very little. I LOVE rice and I usually have a lot of meat left over because I eat more rice than meat but this time, I had more rice left over. \n\nThe service, however, was awesome. I was about to get the chicken w gravy and my waiter was very honest with his opinion of it so I got the grilled pork instead. The other waitress was also quick to refill my water cup. One of my biggest pet peeves in a restaurant is if I have to track down a waiter just to refill my water cup. So that was a big plus for me.

Their fish sauce and siracha did not taste like regular fish sauce and siracha that you would normally get at pho restaurants, especially the fish sauce. Usually fish sauce has a sweeter taste but theirs was just too salty. And when I asked for hoisin sauce, they said they didn't carry any.

Trying Hanoi style pho was on my to do list for some time, but I didn't want to try it anywhere, oh no.  Turtle Tower was going to be my spot to represent that style of Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nI ordered a small bowl of the Pho Ga with chicken giblets (and heart and liver).   The noodles come with a small dish of jalapeno peppers and a wedge of lemon.  The noodles were garnished with cilantro and green onions.  The broth was clear and light, and tasted of chicken (not bouillon), but was a bit on the salty side.  I found no hint of MSG. However, I thought it was very one dimensional so added a few drops of fish sauce, a squirt of lemon and a dab of hot sauce to see if that would make a different.  It did.  \n\nThe shreds of chicken were silky and tender.  It was definitely cooked well.  I just wish there was more of it!   I thought the noodles were a bit overcooked and soft.  Normally a bowl of this size is more than adequate but I wish I had ordered the large.  The portion size was on the small side and I left a bit hungry.  The person next to me ended up ordering additional food halfway through his large bowl of pho.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and tables are spaced with some distance from one another.  However when it gets crowded parties of 2 may be asked to sit right next to other parties of 2, where the tables are pushed together.  It's not a big deal unless you are having a confidential conversation (thinking of all the attorneys and gov. employees working nearby).  \n\nThe staff seem to like to ask about your order as soon as you are seated, even before one gets settled in their seat!   I can only assume from this that they have a lot of repeat customers that know what they want.  In general the staff do a great job of moving people along to accommodate the crowds during the lunch rush.\n\nIf I were in the area I would be open to trying their pho again but I don't know that I would make a special trip.

The noodles were still perfection, the toppings the same. The only change I could tell was the soup. It was too salty, I couldn't finish it like I used to. Either they changed the brand of fish sauce they used to use to or added more in the batch today OR I came at a later time today than I used to (1pm) which means that water has evaporated from the pot hence a saltier broth.

I left with a scratchy throat because of the saltiness.\n\nFunny interaction: So I asked the cashier who I recognized from way back when, if they added extra fish sauce before serving out of curiosity because of the excessive saltiness.

The dish was pretty flavorful and I finished the soup. The iced fresh soy bean drink was not overwhelmingly sweet and paired nicely with the pho.

I was so fed up at all Vietnamese restaurants that substitute vermicelli for Pho but Turtle Tower didn't disappoint me. The noodle was so on point! Love it. The broth was clear and sweet. I'm pretty sure this place uses bome broth instead of MSG to sweeten the broth! The chicken meat was good, containing both lean meat and chicken skin. The chicken's organs remind me of the Hanoi's street food as I always order a side of chicken's heart, gizzard,egg, giblets when eating Chicken Pho in Vietnam. Everything about the dish was lit! Oh, and don't forget to order raw egg yolk as a side order. It went so well with Pho Ga. \nI had Thai Tea for drinks and it was tasty too! It wasn't overly sweet. \n\nThe staff here was friendly too!

We ended up coming fairly late (around 2) due to annoying lunch time meetings, and when we arrived this place was maybe only 20% full. \n\nI've heard so much about Turtle tower and was really excited to try their pho ga (chicken pho) that they're famous for. I recently tried it for the first time in Oakland at Huong Que Cafe and absolutely loved it there, so I was curious how this would compare. \n\nOrdering was pretty straightforward, pretty much everyone ordered a large pho ga (#9). I asked for mine to not have cilantro and green onions. I'm really glad I did, because here the cilantro already comes shredded in your broth and not on the side with the jalapenos like most pho places do. \n\nWithin a couple minutes, 5 giant hot steaming bowls of pho ga were placed before us in rapid succession, and we eagerly dug in. \n\nMy favorite part of this dish was the broth, it had a very nice rich chicken flavor that I really enjoyed. As someone who grew up drinking a lot of chicken soup, I absolutely adore good chicken broth. The noodles are thicker than the usual vermicelli noodles you find in normal pho but still thinner than the ho fun noodles I had at Huong Que Cafe. I thought they were pretty good, but actually preferred the thicker ho fun noodles (though of course this is all personal preference).\n\nI was disappointed by how little chicken there was in the dish though, especially since I had ordered a large pho ga. Also, the chicken is pretty bland and you're given this lemon based sauce to dip it in, but it was way too sour for me and I ended up pouring some fish sauce into dipping sauce dish and using that as my dip for the chicken.

So sad.\n\nOverall the food was poor quality and not well prepared. If you're looking for good pho or a real vermicelli bowl, look elsewhere.", "author": "James C."}

(I'm twenty now) The food just went downhill and the service is roughly the same. They portion off the food now and actually weigh how much chicken to give you instead of just grabbing a hand full and estimating. That already speaks alot. The place use to be packed with vietnamese based FOBS (shoutout to Eddie Huang and Fresh Off the Boat) and families. The atmosphere was very different from it is today. \n\nThe place is now jam packed with hipsters, techies, and millennials. You rarely see a family there. \n\nFood: Food taste the same before but it is now mostly noodles and less chicken. The cuts of chicken are pretty bad mostly fat. They jacked about the prices by like a gazillion fold from what it used to be. \n\nCashiers: The cashiers are the owners daughters and run a very good operation. \n\nDifference: You now have to ask for a fork or spoon and napkin with your to go order.

I am usually a beef pho noodle soup kinda gal, but because the reviews keep mentioning the chicken pho, I decided to stray from the norm and get that instead. My boyfriend got the beef pho which I actually thought was just okay and I LOVED their pho ga here! \n\nService is super friendly here and they seem to always have business. Out of most Vietnamese restaurants in the TL this is probably one of the cleanest ones I've been to. They have other soup noodle options and bun bowls but they're most known for their pho ga. The noodles they use here are a little wider than the ones you have probably seen most commonly around SF and have a lighter broth taste to it, also known as the Northern style of pho. Prices here are fairly reasonable; around $8-$9 for small, $9-$10 for a large. Not bad!", "author": "Kathleen S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-27", "description": "To my fellow Angelenos, if you go into Turtle Tower expecting the good old fashioned pho you're used to, you will be sorely disappointed. The pho here is Northern Vietnamese style and these are the key differences:\n\n1. Less flavorful broth - broth is by far the most important element of a good pho to me and sadly, this broth tasted just like water. No powerful star anise or beef flavor punches! But I've learned this is just the style of cooking. A much more simplified flavor profile, which was sadly too lacking for me.\n2. No garnishes - they will not give you the mounds of basil and bean sprouts that you might be used to. They don't even have hoisin sauce! Again, they're going for simple (aka bland to those of us used to the other style) flavors.\n3. Flat thick noodles - a very big textural difference from the thin noodles I'm used to, but probably the least offensive to me. Still didn't like the slimier, softer texture of a thicker noodle, but not terrible.\n4. Cut of meat - I'm a rare steak pho eater and I only later found out this place specializes in chicken pho. Sadly that was super evident in the fact that their beef was tiny and pretty much non-existent again in flavor. Naturally, I prefer the thick rare steak slices found in southern pho. \n\nSo all that being said, don't get the pho if you're used to the Southern Vietnamese style found in LA. Also, don't get the egg rolls - they're tiny and expensive, but not very good. The thing that was good however was their banh mi! Highly recommend the pate and fancy pork mix - delicious. My friends also had a couple meat/rice dishes and those are definitely a better bet too. \n\nDifferent strokes for different folks!", "author": "Nadia K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "I really hate to give this place only two stars but this is my review and my review is based on my personal preference.\n\nI came here around lunchtime and although there are separate tables I was seated sharing a table with another solo diner. No problem since I'm used to my Pho place back home doing communal seating. But I did want to point it out since not many people may be familiar with this.\n\nI read up on Turtle Tower and I came in well aware this type of Pho is different than what most of us are use to. It's Northern Vietnamese style, which means the broth will taste different, there are no condiments such as sirracha or hoisin, and the noodles are wider. \n\nSo I started off with an order of two egg rolls, they ask you how many you want. An order only comes with one for $3 and some change so two came out to be over $6 which I think is fairly expensive for average sized egg rolls. There was nothing special about the egg rolls, they were good but average. One would have been enough per person but I was feeling fat so I had two to myself. Per my friend's recommendation I ordered the Chicken Pho. Normally I like beef but she said the chicken was amazing and that they use free range chicken and \"it's sooo good\" so I had to give it a try. The size of the noodles didn't bother me much and I used to eat Pho without any condiments anyway because I didn't like how it changed the flavor of the broth. It's all about the broth and it should be eaten pure. So here's my take on Turtle Tower's broth - not good. I wouldn't consider myself a good chef but I have made my own chicken stock. This stock tasted super plain, and looked plain, clear, not much character, as if it was just shelf stock you could buy from the store, however with a huge amount of SALT (msg?). My mouth is dry and craving water just thinking about it. Good broth to me has depths of flavor, not just salt. The broth didn't taste or even look like it had bones simmering for hours to develop a rich flavor, all I tasted was salty water. People seem to enjoy the broth but to each their own.", "author": "Debi N."}

Two, you can always expect a the same DELICIOUS flavoring in their Pho. It's a different style of pho, with the thicker noodles, which to my knowledge is how they do it in the specific region or Vietnam where they serve this style of pho. It is always so promising, and very generous with their portions. They offer both small or large, and every time I come back I always have to second guess myself getting the large because it is always so filling. Lastly, their food and their service is at the level where I feel like every long standing restaurant in SF has to be at.

The wait can get pretty long at this place. On a Saturday afternoon it was about a 30 minute wait. It's not in the best part of town but worth the visit. The service is very friendly and were attentive to us. They used to be cash only but they take credit cards now.\n\nI ordered the small #1 well-done flank and brisket beef pho ($6.75). The bowl was so good I actually wish I had ordered a large. The soup is very flavorful I didn't need to add any sauces to it. The noodles are a lot wider than the pho I've had in the past. The soup is lighter and full of green onions. There's also no bean sprouts and basil to add but trust me you won't miss it.\n\nThe rest of my table ordered the popular pho ga (chicken pho) which they all loved and have been raving about. I thought it was tasty but I actually liked the beef better. My friend said it was the perfect hangover dish. We also got thai iced tea and three color bean dessert (each $3) which were both pretty good.\n\nOverall I highly recommend that you try this place out!

We came here because they were one of the few noodle places that accept credit cards\n\nI was a little skeptical when we first sat down. The tables didn't have plum sauce, siracha, or green pepper slices - staples of vietnamese pho places of my childhood. And the chopsticks they laid down for us were noticeably sticky. The menu is a lean selection of the classic pho bowls - primarily beef with some chicken choices (no vegetarian or seafood options). When our bowls came (beef combo and chicken), I was surprised to see that the plate of fresh greens that usually comes with pho bowls (mint, basil, beansprouts, and lemon/lime), was merely green peppers, and lemon in a sauce bowl. \n\nHowever, when we tried our bowls, the noodles made up for our misgivings. Fresh pho are hard to get right. Put the noodles in too early and they cook too much and break in your chopsticks before you can get them into your spoon. Too late and the soup is cold, or the noodles are tough. This place got the noodle texture right. We were also pleasantly pleased that our order came exactly as requested, and in a very timely manner. The soup itself was not too salty, though I would have preferred more spices (but my personal preference). R loved his bowl - pretty much inhaled it. Service was wonderful.

You know, the pho with basically everything on it - tendons, flank steak, and beef balls. So I like to consider myself a Number One connoisseur. For this place, I foolishly went here based on the stars alone and not reading the reviews. So I ordered my typical Number One and was somewhat disappointed. Sure it was good; the broth was flavorful (and tasted really fresh), but I've definitely had better Number Ones with more of a kick to the broth. It was just OK in my opinion, definitely not four star quality!\n\nSomewhat disappointed, I went back on Yelp after lunch to read what the fuss was all about. Apparently the fuss is all bout the chicken pho, which is a dish I've actually never thought of ordering at any pho places because I think that the broth would overpower the chicken. Intrigued though, I decided to go back and give this place another chance (also brought a couple of co-workers for me this time for company). We all ordered the chicken pho, and right from the moment our waiter brought out our soup, you can smell it. The aroma was so fresh and inviting, as if its as made out of all fresh ingredients! And the broth was perfect for the chicken; it was flavorful, yet not strong enough to overpower the taste of the chicken. In other words, the broth really complimented the chicken nicely. \n\nService here is always top-notch. They are polite, attentive, and speedy.

I used to come here almost every week for lunch with my family, and we loved it! But for some reason, I have started to dislike or to not appreciate their Pho as much as I used to when I was a kid. The soup isn't as rich and tasty as I remember it, and every time I have eaten here recently, I just left unsatisfied. \n\nSome people have stated that their meat feels awkwardly cold when ordering Pho Tai (rare beef noodle soup). The way I was taught to eat it was to allow the rare beef slices of meat to actually cook in the broth. Just wait a few minutes before pigging out and TA-DA, no more cold slices of meat.\n\nTheir noodles are different from most other places. They use flat white noodles. You also do not add bean sprouts and all those vegetables you usually get at other places. Just squeeze some lemon/lime juice to add some tang and you're golden.\n\n+ Ambiance & Location\nStill on the same block but much cleaner and much more modern than their previous location down the block.

Afterward, I saw the clip about Turtle Tower on a recent episode of \"Check, Please!

It's also the first visit I've had since my beloved Pho Ha Noi (San Jose) closed and now Turtle Tower is the solo establishment that I'm aware of that served Northern or Ha Noi style Vietnamese noodle soup characterized by signature wide noodles, milder, ginger tinged broth, and a minced flank steak.  \n\nI'll be honest.  I'm a fan of the larger, much cleaner space and I love the high ceilings and the sunlight that comes in.  It truly transforms the Tenderloin space which can still be a challenge to walk to (the surrounding area can be quite dirty) but that increasingly has food worthy stops such as nearby The Chairman (Bao) that just opened.  \n\nThe food is largely the same as I remember, but given now that Pho Ha Noi has been closed almost two years (I used to go several times a year), the version here still brought back memories of how much I really like Northern style pho compared to the Southern style I consume 98% of the time.  \n\nPho Ga - $7.  Small.  Ordered with giblets and the chicken meat is nice and tender.  The wide noodles are cooked well too.  The broth is tasty but can be a bit mild.  I still like the much stronger and flavorful Pho Ga at Pho Kim Long in San Jose, but the version here is probably good for breakfast like we had here.  \n\nPho Bo Dac Biet - $7.75.  Small.  I do like that even though the space is expanded and new, they 've kept the small options available and pricing seems fair.  Given their fame, I can see how they could charge more, but don't.  Like the chicken pho, the pho dac biet is a milder ginger tinged broth.  The flank steak and meat is nowhere near as impressive as Pho Ha Noi used to be but given it's all we have I'm not complaining.  The wide noodles are delicious.  Turtle Tower also used to now allow hoisin and sriracha sauce.  It seems there is still no hoisin but at least they jars of sriracha. \n\nChicken porridge - $7.  Small.  Another great breakfast food and both tasty and filling.  They use the chicken broth to make this porridge and likely cook it over night as the rice is both well congealed and flavorful.  Hit the spot.\n\nVietnamese Ice Coffee - great way to wake up.\n\nOverall, I can't help but be happy to have Turtle Tower.  I love Northern style pho and Turtle Tower continues to represent.  The renovated new space looks lovely as well and service was both friendly and efficient.  \n\nTurtle Tower accepts credit cards, including American Express.\n\nMy Pho Quest Rankings: [San Jose, unless noted]\n============\n1) Pho Ha Noi (CLOSED) - BEST EVER Pho (Overall & Northern Style)\n2) Pho Cong Ly - BEST Pho (Current Overall & Oxtail) \n3) Pho Y 1 - BEST Beef Pho (Southern Style)\n4) Pho Kim Long - BEST Chicken Pho\n5) Turtle Tower (SF) - Northern Style\n6) Pho Ga Hung - BEST Cau Bun Rau Muong\n7) Pho Nguyen (Milpitas) - Pho Nguyen Dac Biet w/ fresh wide noodles\n8) Nha Hang Saigon Seafood - Winner: Best Hu Tieu\n9) Hai Nam - Pho Ga/Com Ga\n10) Pho Wagon - Pho Dac Biet\n11) GOGO Pho (Santa Clara) - Filet Mignon Pho\n12) Pho 54 - Pho Dac Biet #1\n13) Com Ga Nam An - Pho Ga\n14) Pho Ga Nha - Pho Ga Dac Biet\n15) Kobe Pho (Cupertino) - Kobe Dac Biet\n16) Phuong Thao (Sunnyvale) - Pho #12\n17) Pho Wagon (Sunnyvale) - Pho Dac Biet\n18) Quan Ngon - King Oxtail Pho #6\n19) Pho #1 (Sunnyvale) - Pho Dac Biet \n20) Pho 90 Degree - Pho Dac Biet w/ Oxtail\n21) Pho Spot - Combo Pho\n22) Pho Avenue (MV) - Pho Dac Biet\n23) The Sandwich Maker (Los Gatos) - Beef Pho\n24) Pho Vi Hoa (Los Altos) - Pho P12\n25) Pho Ga An Nam - Pho Ga\n26) House of Pho - Pho Dac Biet and Bo Vien\n27) Rengstorff Pho (MV) - Special Satay\n28) Pho Vy - Egg Noodles with Pork, Chicken, Beef \n29) Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant (Santa Barbara) - Beef Pho\n30) Pho Little Saigon (San Mateo) - Beef Pho\n31) Pho Pasteur - Pho Ox Tail \n32) Pho Ga Ho Han Kiem - Pho Ga Dac Biet\n33) Pho 24 - House Special Pho\n34) Pho Minh (Cupertino) - Pho Dac Biet\n35) Beef Noodle No 1 - Pho #1\n36) Pho Nam (Sunnyvale) - Pho #1\n37) Dalat Restaurant - Hu Tieu Dac Biet\n38) Pho Little Saigon (Sunnyvale) - Pho #1\n39) Pho Nam (Sunnyvale) - Pho #1\n40) Pho To Chau - (MV) - Pho \n40-60) see more at rfung8.tumlbr.com", "author": "Randy F."}

Very flavorful broth with lots of cilantro to flavor the soup. I also like that they serve it with the thick flat rice noodles (ho fun). A small for $6.75 and large for $8.25, which is very affordable. I finished my small and was very full.\n\nDownside, I felt they could have given a bite more chicken, but it is shredded with no bones. A plus for lazy people like me and prefer to not have to pull bones out of their mouth as they're eating pho. Some of my white meat pieces were a bit dry too.\n\nOverall, delicious chicken pho for just $7!

I'd recommend not coming here at night, but they close at 5:00PM anyways.\n\nFood: We ordered the Spring Rolls and the Chicken Pho. The spring rolls were very fresh, decently sized and had plenty of shrimp. The sauce that it came with was also very good. The star of the show was their Chicken Pho though, which had a rich, flavorful, but also light broth. The chicken breasts were very tender and moist. I also like that you get plenty of chicken offal as well, gizzards, hearts, kidney and (my favorite) liver. All were cleaned very well and didn't taste gamey or mineral-y (if that's a word.)\n\nService: Our server was very attentive, and even though we arrived as they were closing, we never felt rushed. He even got us an extra sauce to take with our extra spring roll.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend coming to Turtle Tower if you're in SF and craving Pho.

But sometimes when you're hungover, you just want a steamy bowl of normal, dirty rare steak and tendon pho. It's supposed to cure your hangover and make you feel like you might be able to function again. \n\nI went with the highly suggested chicken pho (large because they didn't have a medium option) and also ordered the che ba mau just because they had it. Che ba mau is a three colored dessert (mung bean, red bean, pandan jelly immersed in a sweet and delicious coconut milk) and it was really tasty here. I definitely enjoyed it. The service here is extremely fast and we got our food within 5 minutes of ordering them. At first glance, the broth looked very clear and everything looked very clean. The noodles aren't your typical pho noodles but rather they are wide rice noodles. This place is also not your typical pho place because it didn't have sriracha or hoisin sauce (what?!) and people said you don't really need them because the broth is good enough on its own. However the broth to me was very like chinese herbal like so very bland and not savory enough. I added the hot sauce they provided but it still didn't add to the flavor. Also the large size is way too big and they should have a medium option. I can see the appeal of this pho over normal phos but I still personally enjoy a typical bowl of steak and tendon pho. Also this didn't cure the hangover =(", "author": "Anna Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-10", "description": "I hate chicken pho.  25 years in the pho game and would immediately put my hand up and say \"please\" chicken pho is abysmal compared to the beef option:  today I have lifted that thought completely.  Turtle tower renewed and rekindled a spark I never knew existed in Chicken pho.\n\n[ 3 factors in why Turtle Tower's chicken pho is successful ]\n\n1. Chicken.  Normally, Vietnamese restaurants would give you chicken breasts and drums on the bone.  Bones are awful and with rough chops, you usually find particles occasionally throughout your soup.  The chicken secondly is so dry. You would think cooking it on the bone would keep it moist, but it's far from that.  Boiled to oblivion and unloved chicken. It tastes like eating 3 day old drought-inducing / bland turkey that's been stowed in the bottom draw of your refrigerator.  \n\nTurtle tower is the polar opposite.  The chicken is so flavorful, moist, the meat is cut evenly, there are no bones, and smiles gleam across the room.  \"Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup and some hot sauce on the side~\" So-da licious!!\n\n2.  Noodle.  Normally Vietnamese restaurants serve vermicelli rice noodles.  It's okay, but fails to hold flavor as successfully.  It's worse when the chicken is God awfully dry and the dense rice noodles do little to save the pho dish.  \"Hey... Let's just give boiled / dry chicken parts and hard vermicelli noodles cause we're pho-king awful human beings!\"\n\nTurtle tower on the other hand uses flat rice noodles. So soft.  So buttery.  So velvety and delicious as it slides against the chicken -- a match made in heaven. A beautifully choreographed dance routine in your mouth.  It's a luscious consistency.  You literally feel comfort without needing to chew meticulously through hard rice noodles or fiddling with bones.  It's one of the most seamless experiences I've surprisingly had.  As a UI designer, I would say it was very \"user pho-riendly.\"\n\n3.  Soup.  The broth is true both normally and here.  Clear, flavorful, maybe a tad bit too salty for my taste, but I absolutely don't mind.  It's a minor preference.  The ability to create such harmonious and high joy out ways a little salt idiosyncrasies for me.\n\n[ Takeaway ]\nIt's literally 2 am and I'm writing about chicken noodle soup.  The world must try Turtle Tower's chicken noodle soup.  3 main ingredients create a 5 star tasting experience.  If you were against chicken pho prior to this review, there might be a beautiful, new and prosperous horizon ahead at Turtle Tower.", "author": "Edison G."}

Decided on this place over the other popular options in the area (Pho 2000 and Hai Ky Mi Gia) purely based on the cleanliness and natural lighting that the place seemed to have.\n\nThe wait was reasonable, and the service was quick. We ordered the Large #4 Pho (Combination of Rare Beef, Tripe, Well-done Beef Noodle Soup), as well as #13 Vermicelli (Fried Imperial Rolls with Vermicelli Noodle, Lettuce, Mint and Cilantro). We had pretty high expectations due to the Yelp reviews.\n\nFor whatever reason, they used their CHICKEN broth for the BEEF pho. We were appalled by this. Now apparently these guys are known for their chicken pho which may be why they used it. The broth itself was alright, though we felt like it had little flavor. The clashing taste was likely due to it being for the wrong meat. Note that they use thick noodles, which was also pretty surprising.\n\nWhat was even more disappointing was the tiny portions provided for the vermicelli dish. In other typical vietnamese restaurants, the vermicelli dishes come as a giant bowl, with a ton of vermicelli, a decent amount of imperial rolls, as well as grilled pork, carrots, and of course the fish sauce on the side for $9 or less.  At Turtle Tower, the vermicelli was a small plate filled with mostly large pieces of lettuce, a bit of vermicelli (literally a fist full), a normal amount of imperial rolls, and very light fish sauce on the side. They priced this at $8.50. Ridiculous. I was almost going to have this as my only dish, but luckily we shared the vermicelli and pho dishes. As a petite female weighing approx. 100 lbs, I walked out still hungry. I am sure an average sized visitor would have a similar or worse experience. \n\nThe imperial rolls were pretty good but did not add up to enough calories to be considered a real meal (since the vermicelli and lettuce were probably 20 calories in total).\n\nSeverely disappointed by what happened in there, definitely not going again.\n\nEdit: We finally went again to give the chicken pho a chance. It didn't change our opinions much - the broth was very light and bland, and the chicken had no flavour. I suppose it is a good option if you want to have a healthy meal..

Everything is already complete in one bowl.\n\nWhat people fail to understand is that it's the authentic way of serving pho. Many people are use to another style where noodles are thin and vegetables and sauce are served on the side.\n\nBut why would you need sauces on the side when everything is already flavorful.\n\nMy favorite is the pho tai: rare beef noodle and their famous pho ga: chicken noodle soup. It's perfect on warm days and even better for cold days or when you're just feeling sick. The noodles are thicker than what most people are use to and that's what makes them so unique. \n\nTips: when sharing with kids they provide a small bowl with scissors to cut the noodles (every parent understands how much easier that is for their child to eat especially since children don't know how to use chopsticks or fork to eat their noodles)\n\nTurtle tower is perfect for any day! \n\nCheck out their other locations on geary in the Richmond district and on 6th street near the courthouse", "author": "Joanne K."}

In the South you will usually find a lighter colored and a slightly lighter flavored broth.  Usually you can distinguish the different styles by looking at the clarity of soup.  The Northern region tend to use less ingredients and that's why it's actually lighter and clearer.   Another difference is in the noodle.  In the North they use a thicker and a bit shorter noodle than those you will find in the South [Hope that didn't bore you all too much]\n\nOk so Turtle Tower serves food from Northern Vietnam which is harder to find than one would think.  The pho ga here is amazing! It is everything you would expect and want from a Northern Pho Ga bowl of noodles.  The noodles are thick and the broth is light in color, clear and absolutely tasty!

All this while Sammy saved up eventually for a James Bondmobile and maybe a Batmobile in the garage, and I'm not talking about the Hot Toys versions ($r$ly the guy has a set of wheels like Jay Leno). Bad creature of habit I was...\n\nWell better late than never. In scanning some of the reviews, it's pretty interesting that not everyone understands the difference between Northern style pho (i.e. Turtle Tower) and Southern style which is way more predominant. Unfortunately way too many Southern style pho shops are heavily polluted by M$G, thus making you think you are drinking magic broth, when you are just dealing with shortcut diluted solutions....kind of like your favorite tapioca milk tea sucka MC remix drink (really you are drinking WATTE, like water with a shot of tea).\n\nNorthern style pho (and thus TT) uses fresh rice noodles that closely resemble Cantonese ho fun, yet I think these are slightly superior in terms of texture and smoothness and slipperiness. Obviously the climate to the North differs vastly from the South, and thus the differences in crops suited for local cuisine (including spices, herbs, etc)....and quite possibly more historic Chinese influence from the North (than the South).\n\nPretty much a no brainer that TT's signature is Pho Ga, or if you are hardcore FOB of any kind, the chicken with giblets (ie chicken parts) might be the way to go. Plus it has been forever since I had those chicken \"ovaries\" with the non fully formed eggs that are quite delicious (better than balut I'm sure). Plus it doesn't hurt the fact they use free range chicken for original flavor, original taste. It's like they are talking to my deep inner FOB. And I also love the fact that even after you put in the order, it takes a while to come out (especially in a packed house). None of that that \"order comes within 5 minutes\" McPho BS. Totally worth the wait.\n\nThe Chao Ga, or chicken congee, is of a similar principle. It's of a different texture than the Chao I had at Trieu Chau in Santa Ana (which was more Vietnamese Chinese Chiu Chow) where that texture was more like watery broken up rice...and the rice grains were not fully \"exploded\". Chao Ga here has a texture similar to that of Cantonese congee, but not as creamy, yet the crisp and clean chicken flavors were there, unaided by the BS known as M$G. Sure you can season it further to your liking with the limited sucka MC condiments at the table, but you really don't need it.\n\nSometimes a restaurant doesn't need to screw around. Focus on a handful (or less) of signatures and freckin nail that to the ground, and hit it hard and deep.\nKeep it as consistent as possible, and deliver as promised (or under promise and over deliver) and that's a formula for eternal success and delighting the customer.\nThe problem is that Asian Americans and some FOBs like variety like a Jack in the Dennys or HK caf\u00e9...and that's when it gets messy. Until a place comes that pulls off a Cooking Papa where 85% of the menu is brilliant and above average, and fairly consistent, it's risky to have a big and broad menu unless you can Jiro Dreams Of Pho out of everything (yeah sure, the pursuit of perfection yet never reaching the top, until Jiro discovers M$G for his pho recipe).", "author": "Ken K."}

Their ingredients are high quality and you can taste how fresh everything is. I've been to the Richmond and SOMA locations, but my favorite is the TL location as I think the broth there is the best. I go there at least once a week and usually order the chicken noodle soup (#9) with extra greens. This is great on a foggy SF day and is my go-to remedy for any malady, including hang-overs, colds, breakups (they have take-out) or generally feeling down. Don't get me wrong, I also go there when I'm in a good mood.\n\nMy other favorites on the menu are the chicken porridge (#21) and stir fried beef with celery, carrot, onion, and leek pan-fried noodle (#7, no soup). The chicken porridge has the same flavors as the chicken noodle soup with similar ingredients and is a nice, warming breakfast. The pan-fried noodle has a delicious wok flavor with a light, flavorful gravy for those rare days I'm not in the mood for soup.\n\nDon't be turned off by the TL location, it is worth the trip.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The young folks working there were cheerful and quick about everything. It was only a few minutes - like literally less than 5 minutes - after I ordered the Pho Ga when it arrived at my table. Of course as it's become my new habit to eat lunch at 3 PM it shouldn't have been so surprising. And as a late weekday lunch person I noticed once again that I'm not the only one. Quite a few other tables were also occupied. \n\nThe Pho Ga is very lightly flavored. Some people may consider it bland. The noodles are wider than other pho places. The chicken reminds me of Chinese steamed chicken. And the broth is just the thing for when you're feeling down. Like really good home made chicken broth. It's both light and comforting at the same time.", "author": "Jean K."}

The service was excellent! Everyone was very friendly and we were greeted by a waiter almost right after we sat down. The time from ordering to serving the food was blazing fast! Maybe around 5 minutes or less, even though it was busy! \n\nAnd I've gotta say, the pho was incredible; light yet flavorful yet filling.

If I had to pick one genre to have for the rest of my life, it would be Vietnamese food. Therefore, I eat a lot of it.\n\nHands down: TURTLE TOWER IS THE BEST PHO I'VE EVER HAD. While unverified, a friend said it was Northern Vietnamese style. It certainly isn't like other pho I've had - where they serve a dish of mint, cilantro, beans sprouts, and jalapenos alongside. That pho \"salad\" isn't a part of this. The noodle is also wide and flat when compared to other pho. But beyond those differences, it's pretty much the same in terms of broth, ingredients, etc. But that broth... you couldn't get a more concentrated, full-flavored broth. Just perfect.\n\nThe service is great. Sometimes there's a wait - and while I'm not one to wait at a restaurant - I will here.\n\nMy only complaint - which is why I only gave them 4/5 stars:  They don't take credit card. C'mon... it's 2015. If it's the fees they don't want to deal with - their food is so cheap they could bump the price to cover fees and it would still be a steal.", "author": "Warren P."}

I've been wanting to try this place for so long, and it definitely lives up to ALL the hype that you see in these reviews, and the wait is worth it! We saw a couple people standing outside and were worried that we'd have to wait a long time, but we were seated within 5 minutes of putting our name down.\n\nBe aware that this pho is different because it's northern style pho. The pho you normally get at pho restaurants is southern style. Northern style pho features wider rice noodles, and there are no garnishes like mint and bean sprouts - nor do they have sriracha and hoisin (not that I saw, anyways). They do add some green onion and cilantro to the pho, which is all I tend to do anyways, so as not to take away too much focus from the broth.\n\nI know that the pho ga (chicken pho) is supposed to be the best item on the menu, but I'm definitely more of a rare steak kind of girl, so I went with my usual pho tai. I always get the rare steak on the side, marinate it in lemon/lime juice for several minutes, and then cook it for a couple of seconds in the hot broth before eating. The meat could have been better - it wasn't thinly sliced pho tai like I'm used to, but it was still delicious. The broth and noodles were AMAZING - so hearty and flavorful, but didn't feel heavy like many pho places that add msg to their bro.\n\nMy friend and I also shared the chicken porridge which was just as, if not more, incredible. I may just have to get two entrees every time I frequent this place, because I couldn't tell which one I liked more. The chicken in the porridge isn't dry or overcooked at all - quite the opposite, and flavored lightly with ginger.\n\nJust wish this place was closer for those painful Sunday mornings when my body is screaming for chicken porridge and pho tai... but honestly, it was so damn good that I would make the venture into the TL again!!", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

I don't think there was anything rare, or any tripe in my bowl. The broth was alright, but the thicker banh pho noodles made a big difference in how the rest of the soup tasted since you were essentially getting 2x-4x more noodle per spoonful than if the typical noodle were used. They brought out a tiny plate with jalape\u00f1os, lemons (instead of limes), and no bean sprouts or herbs.

No bean sprout, basil, or anything else (just like what they mention on their menu). \nNow, the Vietnamese coffee is not bad at all. The coffee is pretty strong. I had been awake all day. So, be careful if you have it for dinner. The coffee is serious :)\nAs for the staff, the waiters are pretty nice. There's a guy who handles the name list and take people to their table. I am not sure if that's the owner or a manager, but he is a serious guy. He didn't really smile, but he did say 'thank you' when we left. \nOur bill came out to be a dollar something (yeah, the tax). \nTry this place out at least once and be the judge for their pho ga :)", "author": "Ervi L."}

I'm Vietnamese myself and have come here twice for pho. My first visit, I would give the place 2 stars and on my second visit (which is the one that I am rating), 1 star it is. I ordered the Pho Ga with the gizzards and eggs on both comings. On my second visit, I ate about 1/3 of my bowl and then I noticed that there were a bunch of small pieces of hair in my pho. So I showed the waiter and they took my bowl, and he came back and had told me that, \"Oh your bowl has hair in it because you ordered the chicken pho with the skin, next time say you want no skin.\" I giggled in my head because this guy must be retarded. First of all, chicken have feathers, and second, that still isn't an excuse to have about 20 pieces of hair in my bowl. Everyone at my table lost their appetite after seeing the pieces of hair in my bowl and stopped eating.\n\nI would rate the food a 1.5/5. Giving them 1 star because of the hair and their lame excuse. Would give them 0 if I could.\n\nOh and don't try the pho place next door to them other, I tried the pho there, and it tastes even worse than here.

Usually everyone who works at their restaurants speaks English as their second language, so they are often not Chatty Cathy and have different cultural customs of how much they like to \"talk to the customers.\" Once you start going in and becoming a familiar face they start to remember your order, ask how you are, and become more comfortable asking questions and \"providing customer services.\" No one is ever rude I think just shy around language barriers.

It's NOT Pho.  The noodles are over cooked and super soft.  The same owners were there so I think they changed it by design. What a shame.  Compromised the food to make extra profit.

TT is one of the few places where I know I don't have to mess with the flavor of the soup (usually by adding fish sauce, sirancha/oyster sauce, salt, etc...).  \n\nI'm sure they have some added preservatives (msg) in their soup, to make it extra yummy, but whatever... name one pho joint that you know of that doesn't use msg?

I believe the family that runs TT informed me that their noodles soup are served like in the northern part of Vietnam (Hanoi).  \n\nI've also had their rice plates and other noodle soups but they are okay (average).  What's going to stand out, and what TT is best known for, is the Pho Ga (#9, #10 if you like chicken giblets).  Stick with the game plan and save the other stuff on the menu for another visit.

Situated in a part of the city where there a quite a few pho restaurants, this was one of the ones that happens to be open on Sunday. We were able to find metered parking that required about a 2 minute walk to the restaurant. \n\nService was prompt and friendly. We were greeted and seated quickly and our orders were taken just as fast. We got here just before closing time and didn't leave until after the restaurant closed and staff was friendly the entire time, never rushing us as some restaurants will do in similar situations. We came here to eat pho ordered accordingly. I ordered a beef and my wife ordered chicken. We were given the choice of a few different types of noodles and we both chose rice noodles.\n\nWhile waiting for my pho to come I squeezed in a few yelp reviews which is when I learned their pho was different than most as it is \"Northern Vietnam\" style. This got me excited as almost every pho I have tried up to this point has been essentially the same.\nWhen my dish came it didn't come with basil, cilantro, or sprouts on the side. In fact, nothing came on the side. This was the 2nd time I experienced this in SF. The rice noodles that came with it were the flat variety which is different than the round type that I'm used to.  The broth was light and had a nice flavor to it.  It wasn't overly salty, fatty, or loaded with MSG but it did lack in depth of flavor. What I really liked was the rare beef that was served with my pho which was extremely tender, was served as one large piece on top of my soup, and appeared to have a texture as if it had been pounded with a meat hammer. The other slices of well-done beef were equally tender and tasty as well.\n\nAll in all, the pho here was different and even though it was good it wasn't so good that I'd come back here again. The main reason for this is because I do not live in the city and there are quite a few other pho places that look good in SF that I still want to try so I will most likely be giving one of those places my business if and when I return.", "author": "Alan T."}

I also discovered a new item on the menu - which is the egg noodles with beef infused with red wine.

We decided soup might be the best remedy for the hangover our party of 7 had. The reviews seemed excellent and this restaurant received high praise from our friends. \n\nSo we decided to try it out. Specifically the Pho Ga. The wait time seemed quite long but given that this restaurant wasn't overly large we continued waiting. Eventually we were seated and almost everyone ordered Pho Ga. \n\nThe Pho Ga had a nice light broth with a surprising amount of flavor. The noodles tasted really good. They were wider noodles than those that normally come with Beef Pho. No hoisin  sauce at the table but the soup was pretty good. It didn't have too much oil in it. Which is usually why I do not order Pho Ga.I also tried to order a sandwich which they were out of.\n\nThe service was just okay. The restaurant was pretty busy but I felt the service could of been a lot better. I would rate it 3.5 stars.", "author": "Jeff D."}

Not too oily and tastes like the broth has been stewing with chicken for hours.\n\nThe staff is friendly and very attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-03", "description": "I haven't been to Turtle Tower for a long time, but when I came back they moved. The new location is 2 houses to the right from the old location. The new place has two floors but I'm not sure why they're not using the second floor because it gets very crowded in the afternoon. When I got there it was around 12:35 pm, the line went outside the building but that's because they don't have that much space inside for people to wait. The wait time was approximately 15 minutes for a table of two on a saturday. I eat pho around the whole city and I still think the chicken noodle soup is the best.\n\nTurtle Tower is Hanoi northern style, meaning you won't get any side garnishes or bean sprouts because they don't serve those in the northern vietnamese style. Personally going to Turtle Tower a lot of times in my life when I was smaller, I think the best item they have on the menu would be the chicken noodle soup. Now at the new location the 2nd best item in my opinion would be #2, the rare beef noodle soup. The broth is the main key for this restaurant, it has very good tasting soup and noodles. When I asked for white meat, I got white meat, and believe me, every single chicken was white. The price for two was around $18, so yes it's a bit pricey for a bowl of noodles but you get what you pay for. If you are still not full after a bowl of pho, you can always order the imperial rolls with vermicelli, you will most definitely be full because I ordered the imperial rolls to go and it was delicious when I ate it at home. \n\n \nThe restaurant environment is very calm. My thoughts when I walked in the new location was that it has a good setup, nice counter and a big kitchen for the workers, most importantly it has over 20 seats. So yes, the line does go fast even when it all the way outside. Do you know how I know there's a big kitchen? There's a servery window, so you can see the whole kitchen and how they prepare their food through that servery window. The building has a big glass window outside, so anyone can look inside and see you eating. But on the bright side you can watch over your car or what's happening outside. If you're a sports fan, this is the right place for you. They have 2 big TV inside the dining hall that's always broadcasting sports. They also have decorations around the whole building. If you look around there's frames with black and white photos inside them. It shows the pictures of Hanoi in the old time. \n\nThe staff there was very kind, they told us the approximate wait time when you go inside to sign up for the wait list. And no, it's not those kind of servers who tells you a wait time that's completely inaccurate. When we were called in, it was like a typical restaurant. Get your name called, seated and order. I ordered the most famous item on their menu, the Chicken noodle soup. I looked around after ordering, most of the people there ordered chicken noodle soup so that's probably the best dish they have. I was surprised when the food came in 3 minutes even when they were on busy hours.The servers there are very fluent in their languages, most of them speak three languages, english, chinese and vietnamese. The servers are usually around you, so it's not hard to call them over if you want to order something. \n\nI would most definately come back to turtle tower when I have a chance, they had great customer service, good environment. last not least best pho in the city in my opinion! I eat pho every weekend so I have very high expectations when I'm eating pho since I come from a Vietnamese family. My family can make the same food as most restaurants but Turtle Tower has the broth that my family does not know how to make. Therefore it's one of the best pho places in the city. Just remember that turtle tower only accepts cash, don't bring a credit card because they will just tell you leave something expensive at the restaurant and get money from the bank. If I were to give a advice to this restaurant, I would suggest opening up the upstairs too so the line won't be that long. If you don't want to wait that long, I suggest you to go to their other two locations. There's one at Outer Richmond at Geary and there's another at SoMa at 6th street.", "author": "Wilson L."}

I really wanted to indulge in the unique food culture here and not just the touristy spots. Anyway, I wanted pho and I mean good pho so I did a little research (thanks Yelp) and every time, this place came up as number 1. I walked the 25 minutes Google maps said it would take to get there from my hotel and like Moses parting the Red Sea, there it was: Turtle Tower. I was excited and ready for that big bowl of piping hot soup and then it happened.....I walked in the door and was standing there for about 2 mins and no one said a word to me. Then when I was finally greeted by a sweet older woman and seated, I thought it would get better. It did for the length of time it took for her to take my order and for my food to arrive. \n\nI ate my pho tai in silence (I was alone after all) and I must say it was delicious. I also ordered the yummy spring rolls. The pho was the best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating it. Now I know you're asking yourself: If it was so good, why only 2 stars? Let me explain. Having worked in the retail industry (food service/retail all the same to me) for many years, I know what is expected of me to provide optimal customer service. I did not have the same experience at Turtle Tower. No one ever came back to my table to ask me how my meal was or if I needed anything else. Everyone around me was asked and anyone who walked in the door was greeted right away. It wasn't until I had to ask for more water (instead of someone noticing my glass was empty) did someone finally ask me about my meal. I told them the pho was delicious and the best I've ever had (which is true) and I smiled politely. I waited another 5 minutes for my check, paid, tipped and left. I was given a polite but emotionless thank you as walked out the door. \n\nWould I recommend this place for the pho, sure. Would I go again alone, probably not.\n\n***Edit to this review***10/9/13\n\nAfter talking with a friend of mine, he mentioned that I should make a little addition to this review which might also account for why I did not receive the same service as the other patrons in the establishment.

At first I didn't think too much about it since they took me out to Turtle Tower a few years ago at their former location and I wasn't impressed. BUT!!! At their new location I must say the soup was delicious! I really enjoyed the fresh noodles, the soup was very tasty without the addition of any other sauces. It was so good that I had to go back today. Luckily I was a single eater so I didn't have to wait too long for a table. They seat you with other single eaters so it could be awkward, but no big deal for me. I needed to eat a good hot meal--fast.

The lady owner looks happy - her smile is bigger, eventually they got to a larger place, but maybe too happy they've forgotten about what matters most: the food.\n\nI ordered the beef pho today - t\u00e1i gu. The young girl who was our server did not speak Vietnamese, so she couldn't understand the specifics. Moved on to a guy who could ... When the pho was brought out, its soup was too salty. I might understand how it happened, it was late noon and the evaporation might have been a bit too much, but don't you need to taste your own food if you are a chef? And the rare beef is nothing rare. It was overcooked and lumped together into hard to chew big pieces.\n\nMoving on to another dish - the egg rolls - too brown, over deep fried. I want to stop writing now.\n\nSo in my opinion, the restaurant is still a cash cow for its owner (is it owned by Vietnamese or Chinese now?) but the food has been on the decline.

I also like that you can have the pho with giblets and order giblets on the side. Wait can be long if you come at during lunch and dinner time. I come right after the lunch rush (2:00pm) and there's hardly a wait. I also like that they provide kid friendly utensils and food scissors if you need it.

I can tell my friend and I weren't the only customer with overly greasy food because I saw every tray that went by, had films of grease all over it. \n\nThe service, boy, they were quick to get our orders like they were rushing because we just sat down no more than 10 seconds ago and they were already asking as what we wanted. We told them 1 more minute, and they came back not even a minute. But the time it took to get the drinks, the food, and even the check was soooooo... slow.\n\nI give it 1 star for my friend who works here and 1 star for one of their staff who's really cute. =D", "author": "John A."}

It's not 3 stars because 3 stars means it's just okay and I think it's good, but I don't particularly love it either.  I think it has a good solid broth but I'm not a huge fan of the noodles or the chicken.  I mean it tastes good but  I think personally the noodles (they have regular and egg) and the chicken meat (it's just regular chicken meat) don't really do it for me.  I've had the imperial rolls quite a few times and I think they're good as well - really solid - but as someone who prefers bun bo hue I think really the broth is what I like here and not so much pho in general.  Another good place with really good broth is My Father's Kitchen which I think I like more - both their beef broth and chicken broth are delicious.  Turtle Tower is a really popular spot with my coworkers and friends though - also their coffee is great - but very strong!", "author": "Sophia D."}

This review is for the #4 combination for beef. The broth was very on point, along with the thick pho noodles. I like it, but I don't love it. However, their customer service is great. I think this is because they hire young adult employees. I will come back if I am in the area. Otherwise, I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.", "author": "Karen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-28", "description": "I have loved this place for years- not only are the owners stellar people who remember me and ask about my life, but the pho is just the best that there is, hands down. I am a pho aficionado- It's my fave food & I eat it probably 4 times a week- Nowhere has the northern vietnamese style like turtle tower- nowhere. I always judge a pho place on it's imperial rolls, too- so many places use a fried wrapper that is much like what you get when ordering chinese food- meh- but not turtle tower- it's imperial rolls, though small and expensive compared to other places, are a treat- they are lightly crispy and melt in your mouth at the same time.... delicious. I cannot say anything bad about any of their locations, although the TL one is always going to hold a special place in my heart! TT Pho-ever! Also, I have two babies that were basically fed turtle tower in utero for 9 months.... They came out loving vietnamese food just as much as I do! Here's to the next generation of turtle tower lovers!", "author": "C V."}

If you come on a weekend for lunch, be prepared for a line. The best thing is that you can call in and have it to go, it's nomrally ready in 15 minutes.", "author": "Kate J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-22", "description": "I give it four stars mostly because they use organic meat.  Device was friendly but they clearly rush you.  We had never been to the  place before and after having our menus for less than a minute an eager waitress asked if we knew what we wanted.  When we said we didn't know, she gave us this exasperated look and just stood there, as if to say, \"hurry up and decide, you're lucky you have a table.\"  We both ordered the Pho, one chicken one beef.  Broth was not as flavorful as I expected from other reviews. Overall it was very good, not great.", "author": "Ashley K."}
