Came to San Francisco for the first time and as much as I wanted to sight see and walk around and do this and that, Football Sunday is Football Sunday, we needed to be somewhere with a big television and crazed fans regardless of what city we were in. Did a quick Sports Bar search on Yelp in the area we happened to be walking around in at that time and this place popped up. This is your classic Sports Bar; mixed crowd both old and young, jerseys, Jameson shots being poured, beers being passed around, wings being eaten, pool being played, Sports Bar. We found two seats at the corner of the bar and grabbed those for a few hours. They had some great beers on tap, local breweries and your usual domestic options. They had your standard bar food, nothing too healthy as can be expected. The bartenders were super laid. back and cool. Very chill vibe in here. The bathroom was definitely gross. I mean, real gross. The sink had a massive massive soap bottle in it so you couldn't access the sink to wash your hands, which meant the zillions of people who went in and out of the bathroom were definitely not washing their hands, which totally skeeved me out. Luckily I had wet ones on me so I could. make do, but also, bleh. Definitely come here on Sunday to watch the game, it definitely seemed like a day drinking place.

Love y'all. But they have very good nibbles for a sports bar. I've had the tots, poutine, wings, hummus, chicken tenders, and quesadillas; all have been really tasty. Def go with the wings, I love them, Louisiana or buffalo, I like spicy. They have of course ranch or Bleu cheese as dipping sauces for the wings and bring you crema and salsa with the quesadillas. \n\nThey have a great beer menu and full bar. I love that I can have whatever I'm feeling a tequila shot or a nice pour of dechutes fresh squeezed ipa. And the new location is bomb for sure. There are so many TV's that I was able to watch baseball, stanley cup finals, and basketball. Did I mention I love sports? The new place is fantastic, they have many more TV's and a projector for the \"big games\". I'm trying to get my alum group to meet here instead of where we are currently at; I love this bar that much. Food and drinks and not just beer a full bar! I just wish they served micheladas full time and not just during brunch. \n\nThe service is fantastic and if you are looking for an amazing spot to watch games and have some munchies and drinks this is the place.

The alliteration! \n\nI was actively yelping for bars with trivia night and decided to give this one a try due to good reviews on their trivia and bar food! Came on at 8:30 on Tuesday night with a total of five friends for a night of fun and good $2 tacos. \n\nMy first impressions coming in was that it was on a quieter street than I expected after dark. The interior was pretty small, but homey. They had large screen TVs for games behind the bar and two tables for larger parties (5-6 people) in the back. \n\nThe trivia was pretty challenging, especially not knowing what to expect the first time here. There were 6 rounds, which included subjects such as Current Events, Asian Geography, a picture round, song round, and a surprise round. Some of the questions were less catered to our Millenial generation selves (understandable judging from the older crowds that came in). Nevertheless I thought it was pretty fun although we came in last place (womp womp). \n\nWhile I was pretty full from dinner prior to coming, their bar food menu was full of enticing comfort snacks such as bacon wrapped tater tots I had to refrain from ordering. I still got a $2 carnitas taco to try. It was actually very flavorful, filled with the savory meat pork and hearty beans. As for drinks, I ended up getting a Mexican Mule (pretty good for $7) that was really refreshing and just strong enough to me. One bartender was working and he did a good job serving drinks to us and the rest of the packed crowd in for trivia. \n\nI was honestly going to give this place four stars--A litte far for me to come regularly, but it's a small cozy bar that is great for locals. This joint has good bar food, drinks, and snacks. However, it was brought to my attention from one of my friends that I came with that he was rudely (and racist-ly) called out by the bartender for not tipping before he even had a chance to do so. While I didn't directly experience this, I'm disappointed this happened to our group of 5 Asians as a first impression here. We actually all spent a good amount of money on drinks and snacks together here (and do know how to tip), but probably will try another bar as a group because this happened to us.", "author": "Clarissa C."}

Ok - I'm a little biased because It's only a hop, skip and a jump from my apartment, but the up-beat ambiance, multiple high quality TVs, and solid beer selection speaks for itself. All of the bartenders are hardworking and easy to talk to. The addition of the pool table that was lacking from their previous location was monumental. Trivia Tuesday is raunchy yet educational, and the $3 tecates are always cold. Not the best food or beer prices in town, but definitely the best place to watch sports in North Beach.

Shoot, I'm not going to waste money on valet parking that can be used for romancing the bottle. Yep, priorities. \n\nTater Tot had his first grooming appointment in North Beach so we begrudgingly headed there on a Friday afternoon. The parking gods must have been looking over us because I scored awesome metered parking on Columbus street. We had 2 hours to kill after dropping him off so I thought I knock off some of my North Beach bookmarks that were collecting dust.\n\nFirst up: The Boardroom. \n\nI love that it's a scotch off the beaten path of touristy Columbus Avenue. And, unless the tourist is a Yelper, they're probably unlikely to find The Boardroom. \n\nI was hoping to be welcomed by the resident pooch that I've seen on Yelp pics but sadly, he wasn't there. It's ok though because we were welcomed by our super nice bartender who had a very distinctive Vin Diesel voice. \n\nThe Boardroom is a dive bar that serves decently priced drinks, bar food, and brunch on the weekends (hello, cookie batter French toast!). There's a bunch of flat screen TVs for watching the game and a Rockbot so you can select whatever song you want to play ($1/song). \n\nFridays are the best day of the week because I can drink to my heart's content and not have to worry about having to wake up at ass crack of dawn to go to work.

On Mondays, they have 50 cent wings (I'll make it there one day!) and Tuesdays are $2 tacos and trivia night. CC's accepted. \n\nI stuck with usual Hendrick's Tonic ($10) which was nicely stiff. I noticed they carried Effen Vodka which is rare so I also had two Effen Black Cherry Tonics ($9 each).\n\nWhat's booze without some good drunchies right?\n\nWe ordered their infamous Bac-o-Tots ($8): http://bit.ly/1dKsqJn and Carne Asada Nachos (Small - $7): http://bit.ly/1IkLF48 which were great. You can never go wrong with bacon and tots but together, they make the perfect drunchies snack especially with the side of ranch for dipping. Yep, definitely get an order of these...for yourself. We regretted not ordering a large nachos because they was pretty good as well. Fresh mound of crunchy chips topped with a duo of melty cheese, black beans, tender bits of carne asada, salsa rojo, guac, jalapenos, and crema. The chef brought out our food to us himself which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nDidn't encounter any douches when we were there like others did but there may be a resolution for that.

The chef in the kitchen does major work - cooking and bringing everything out to the many people who order, good work!\n\nWe shared Nachos with Carne Asada ($9) which was pretty bomb, plus an order of Mac N' Cheese with Bacon ($8) which was no bueno. It was basically large elbow pasta with a watery cheese sauce and topped with nearly burned bacon bits. Sad face central. Stephanie S got the Bacon Wrapped Tater Tots aka Bac-o-Tots ($8 for five) which she said were yummy, but not a lot came in an order. Rita I had the Buffalo Wings in Island Flavor ($9), which were not particularly meaty, but had good flavor. During trivia we got all fat kid and ordered Tot-chos ($8) and they were OK, a combo of soggy and then dried out, I could probably live without them.\n\nAnywho, I'd like to go back and try brunch. I think last night was also slightly tainted because there was a Wild Card A's v. Royals game on that went to the 12th inning, and there were way too many A's fans clogging up the joint. So that's that: I hope to be back, I hope no more awful men approach me and my friends, and I hope the staff continues to rock on.", "author": "Crystal C."}

Reasonably priced drinks - particularly at Happy Hour. ($4 pints - some good stuff on tap)  They introduced me to Frenet.  Excellent service.  The bartenders are super cool and take the time to get to know their customers.  The patrons are always interesting - Definitely the 25-40 (mostly male), affluent/professional but not flashy set.  There are plenty of the fratty types, but I have yet to see the obnoxious variety (I'm looking at you, Wreck Room ;) )  I've had a lot of good conversations with folks while grabbing a few pints and watching games.  Generally, there are some gals there too.  It's a good sports scene.  I go for MNF and hockey games.  One of the bartenders is a Leafs fan.  Overall, it's a relaxing place to unwind and grab a few drinks with buddies, and a good place to pop in by yourself.\n\nAnd, the food.  I love tater-tots!  They've got'em.  The sandwiches are all good - I'm a big fan of their burger ($10 if you get it with Cheddar and Bacon, with a side of tots).  I've tried the Pulled Pork, and that was also terrific.  They do Bacon-Wrapped Tater-Tots, which was actually how I found out about the joint.  Yes, they're great!

That sandwich gave me liiiiife! Nearly perfectly cooked meat, with just the right amount of coleslaw to compliment it's flavor. Bread: nice and fluffy. And a nice bowl of broth to dip in. Simply succulent. \n\nGreat service, average bacon wrapped tater tots, and a fantastic corned beef sandwich at a bar in North Beach....\n\nSTRONG 4-star", "author": "Jeff S."}

Was told upfront that it was a bar that serves food rather than a burger place, specifically. Good thing too, because when we arrived there was only bar seating and we hesitated at first, thinking maybe we would not be able to eat here.\n\nLuckily, we stayed- probably because the game was on and we didn't want to waste time finding a new spot, but the fact that wings were on special really helped, too.  Fifty cent wings on Mondays, 5pm-10pm.\n\nWe ordered a round of beers (had the hawaiian one on draft- can't remember the name, but it was light and sweet, refreshing) and a ton of food: a burger and the brisket dip to share, with sides of bac-o-tots and onion rings, plus (what amounted to) 25 wings in spicy bbq, hot, and spicy island. More on those in a minute.\n\nBurger was just okay, dip sandwich was dry and tough and we did not finish it- very unusual for us. Bac o tots were awesome, but seemed overrated based on other reviews we read here. Onion rings were okay. \nThe WINGS are where it's at though- specifically the SPICY ISLAND. I could bathe myself in that sauce. It was phenomenal- I was expecting something with pineapple that's overly sweet and not usually my thing, but this one.. dude, I can't even figure out what was in it! A fresh green herb/spice was present, possibly basil? Or maybe thai basil? Overall the taste to me was more thai than island, but whatever the hell you want to call it, we ordered extras of it, and even then I was dipping my pieces in the extra sauce puddled at the bottom of our basket.\n\nService was good- bartender/server clearly enjoys his job and was making conversation with most at the bar. Made good food/drink recommendations. Space itself is divey, and that's okay- all the TVs were working and the food was good, so that's all that matters. \nDefinitely want to add that the unisex bathroom was surprisingly VERY clean, which I almost didn't expect based on the looks of this place- but the appearance is deceiving. Most dive bars have mediocre foods and questionable cleanliness- and you'll find the exact opposite here: phenomenal island wings and tidy space, from the bathroom to the bartop.", "author": "Stefany V."}

But there were no waiters, so be prepared to go to the bar to order. The food, for the most part, was good bar food. Bacon wrapped tater tots: Delicious (though few in quantity. Not shareable, in my humble, bacon-loving opinion). Tacos: Yum Yum. Nachos: Great. Mac 'n Cheese: Not great. Just avoid it. They lured me with the promise of cheese and bacon and I felt duped!

I couldn't hear the woman reading the questions. When she spoke at a good volume, she was kinda mumbling (drink much, lady?). And there were HUGE time gaps between rounds.

STUMBLE. EVER.\n\nWalked in enticed by the tecate + jagermeister special. You can't go wrong with that combo for $6. It was a pretty quiet night, so we chatted up the bartender about the confusion of which football team the bar roots for, and their beers on tap. I must have looked hungry because the next thing I know, he plops a menu down right in front of me. \n\nPerused it a bit, hoping for something small to tide us over before dinner time. And saw the most enticing words I have ever seen on a bar menu \"Bacon wrapped tots.\" Bacon wrapped tots?!?!?! I was intrigued. So we ordered them up assuming the worst, but hoping for something at least worth digesting.\n\nA few minutes later, we were presented with a plate filled with tiny brown treasures that smelled like an angel's fart (kinda salty and fills the room.... but in a good way). The bartender knew we were about to lose our bacon-wrapped-tot-virginity, so he gave us the run down. The ranch is infused with bacon au jus (!!!!!) and mixed with a bit of the house hot sauce is the perfect little bite. \n\nOh dear God. My mouth was dancing. That bite was euphoric. The tot was perfectly cooked- tender and fluffy in the center with a nice tot-ty texture. The bacon, which I completely expected to be a chewy mess that would destroy the tot, was quite the opposite. The bacon was crispy and light and perfectly salty without being toooo salty. The ranch complemented the tot so beautifully as if they were created only to accompany each other in life. And the house hot sauce..... just enough heat to wake up your tastebuds so that they can experience this tot magic exactly as the heavens imagined. \n\nAside from this experience, everything else about this place is fantastic. The locals are really friendly and the bartenders are freakin hysterical. There are always sports on the two TVs and the rest of the food is pretty good too. They have a great brunch menu, if you're into that kind of thing too. I hear the bloody mary is yummy.\n\nThanks Boardroom, for ruining tots everywhere else.", "author": "Mar A."}

WE were looking for a place that my friend could watch the game and we finally landed mainly due to Yelpers on this place. The fact they had bacon wrapped tater tots was simply deep fried icing on the cake. When we go there we were surprised at how small it was but they indeed had several screens on and one of them was the game my friend wanted to watch. We of course wanted to dine so the extremely cool and helpful bartender (Martin) got us fixed up with menus.\n\nThe selections were not your typical bar food, my friend had a veggie burger with sweet potato fires, I can vouch for the fries as I stole a few (for review purposes of course). I ordered the signature bacon wrapped tots, and a breakfast burrito that took up the entire plate. It was very tasty and really not too overwhelming for its shear mass, but had what I have to assume was house made guac, and other goodies. I also had their secret sweet tea vodka concoction which I have to admit would be dangerous if consumed too fast or if you had to be somewhere serious but in the context of brunch it was just right. So I had 2. \n\nI guess the biggest plus for this place was it was clearly a neighborhood pub, and we were clearly not from the area but I felt they treated us as if we were there every night, I think anybody can sling drinks but Martin made us feel like he was opening his home and making sure we got whatever we needed.

The place has a cool, surfer theme, which was appropriate for watching \"Point Break\" on the bar's TVs. That was not Casey's choice of movie (the manager who was tending bar that night) but he was joking along with us, chatting with everyone.   He even recommended a great new gin to freshen up my tonic.\n\nWhen we finally contacted him about the possibility of having our launch party there, he was nothing but accommodating.  It's hard to find a place for 30-40 people for a weekday happy hour without a crazy price tag or an attitude.  Casey was as happy to have us there as we were to find such great place.  And in all our planning, Casey was quick to call back, professional with a sense of humor.  Perfect.\n\nThe event went amazingly well.  Ben was the fantastic bartender taking care of us that night.  He was so nice, and made great drinks.  He and Casey even made a signature cocktail for us for the party.  We also were able to plug our iPod into the sound system and enjoy a personal playlist.\n\nWhat really sealed it for me is that the next morning, Casey gave a quick call to see how the event went.  That was unnecessary and completely appreciated.  So if you are looking for an event space for 20 - 60 people, definitely give Casey a call.\n\nEven the regulars at the bar are super-friendly and nice.  The food here is really good, as well - can't beat bacon-wrapped tater tots.  It's a very clean place with a warm vibe.  (And no, there is no broken sink, like in the photos - it's a perfectly nice bathroom!)

Luckily for us, The Boardroom was what we picked. I was a bit apprehensive of eating in a bar at 11am when I wanted some really great breakfast food, but most on yelp said it was to be trusted so we went for it. I am sooo glad I did. What first got me in there was the bacon-wrapped tater tots-they did not disappoint (except for the fact that I wanted more after we finished the basket. Don't share-get your own!). I have never had anything like them and I will be drooling at the thought of them for quite a while-at least until I get my hands on a deep fryer and perfect the recipe. After our appetizer we ordered the cookie dough stuffed French toast and the Croque madame-both were delicious. Then, as if we hadn't splurged enough, we decided to go for the pitcher of mimosa. During the time it took us to get our buzz on I played around with the really cool app that lets you pick the music in the bar from your smartphone.\n\nThe food gets an A+ and so does the service. Marvin made us feel super comfortable and welcome from the moment we walked in and gave us excellent advice on menu items, city tips and picker-uppers to help with a food coma. I also thought it was pretty cool that they served Pisco and Fernet-things I had been missing ever since my visit to Chile that have been pretty hard for me to come by in the US.

I know that most people here come to drink and watch sports on TV, not to eat, so I don't think it's too fair to judge them by the speediness of their food preparation (which was on the slower side) - BUT, they were really accommodating about letting us change the channels on the TVs to watch what (sports game) we wanted to, which I thought was cool.", "author": "Melody L."}

My buddy and I had just got into San Francisco, it was Halloween Saturday and we'd finished off a 12-pack in our hostel whilst trying half-heartedly to decide what to do. We'd just come off five nights in Vegas so we were a little worse for wear, and weren't sure if we had it in us to go out. I consulted Yelp anyway, memorised the directions to the Boardroom and away we went.\n\nSince we're idiot Australians, we didn't have costumes for Saturday night as we were going to buy them the next day for a party we were going to. So we were essentially the only two people in the place not dressed up. But it didn't matter; bartenders Bruce (Magnum PI) and Ben (Zach Galifianakis) gave us some sage advice on Halloween culture and then plied us with booze. All fucking night.\n\nAt some point, one of the guys decided the bar needed to hear the soundtrack from The Hangover, which I just so happened to have on my iPhone. Minutes later, my iPhone was responsible for music for the next hour and a half, even after the soundtrack ran its course. There I found myself, rapping in the back of the bar with a random local girl and thinking \"wow, they're playing some kick-ass songs in here!\" Duh. \n\nI'd also like to use this review to apologise to the off-duty bartender who I kept buying Jameson shots and PBR for, even though he was wasted.

I agree with Mr. Luis, we should have just had dinner at The Boardroom, too -- the menu looked good and how could I have turned down tater tots and fish tacos?!?!  Will definitely try food next time...\n\nWe arrived a little before eight, bar wasn't as crowded as we expected.  A few Yelpers already stationed along side the bar.  Drinks were ordered.  $6 for a can of Olympia beer and a shot of Jager... tempting, but no thank you.  I had Mirror Pond Ale all night long.  More people arrive, our Yelp team got bigger so we had to split in two different teams before trivia started.  \n\nTrivia.  7 Categories.  Current Events.  Naming the Person's name by looking at a printed picture. Pop Culture. Music clips. Commonalities (things words have in common). Movie clips. Random category.  70 Questions total.  Rule number 1 is do not yell out the answer.  Rule number 2 is no cheating (aka: using iPhones to get answers).  Rule number 3 is DO NOT YELL OUT the answer.  Simple enough.  The host is great, she had to remind a few people about the rules and had a bit of trouble with the microphone.  \n\nTrivia lasted for a while, maybe about an hour and a half.  In the end, my team lost by a couple of points.  But hey, we still won a $25 bar tab for the best team name... \"A Colin in the Barack is worth two in the Bush.\"  Can't complain.\n\nGood food and drink specials, great service, nice casual bar and an interesting crowd.

The bar was nice and clean for this type of venue, kind of \"sports bar meets dive\" bar.  Good spot overall.

Thankfully we found The Boardroom that night and it's become one of my favorites ever since.\n\nIt's the sort of place that makes you feel like a regular even on your first time in. You don't need to fight through the crowds of reprobates to get up to the bar, and the prices are right where they should be. People aren't there misbehaving and acting like it's the first time they've been to a bar, even if they are more than a little lit up.\n\nWe were on a liquid diet that night, but have been back dozens of times since, and the food is darn tasty.

I used to come in wayyy back in the day when it was Shannon's to watch 'gator football.  Think I might have tried it's \"Woody Zips\" incarnation once, but just never became a fan...it was just so clean compared to the utter sh*hole that Shannon's had been that I couldn't adapt. Plus they moved the bar from the lefthand wall to the righthand side which tripped me out.\n\nBut then I stumbled in a few Fridays back (okay I walked in...but there might have been a slight stumble upon departure), and it was packed, and I mean packed with...wait for it...,no, not hot women...I know what you guys were thinking...but dogs. Gorgeous, playful puppies.  \n\nI'm so jealous because they are all just lying there on the couch and I *know* I can't bring my baby here because even at almost four and literally the best trained dog I've encountered in SF he's a little energetic.  Just a little bit.  Seriously, remember back when drugs were cool and people had money and did blow?  Sonny's like that ALL THE TIME.  (That's a lie, he's a Labrador so he sleeps 18 hours a day, but the 6 that he's up he's MOVING).\n\nSo this Saturday rolls around and its a beautiful day and I feel a need to get outside.  Sonny and I stroll over to meet a lady friend of mine at Washington Square Park.  We're there like 10 minutes or so when she says \"You know there's NCAA basketball on right now?\"  My heart melted a little.  Seriously...that's like hearing a woman say \"My hot bisexual roommate wanted to know if she could join us?\"\n\nSo knowing that the Boardroom is dog friendly and has at least 5 flatscreens, I decide to see if Sonny can play nice with mellow dogs.  We walk in and there's another lab, Maya, (whom I'd met before) there and the two of them get along famously, even though she's one hot bitch and Sonny still has his balls. \n\nIt was a minor pain in the ass because Sonny's favorite room in the bar is naturally the kitchen, so I have to keep one eye on him, which leaves the remaining eye split between the game, the girl who wanted to go watch the game, and our order of tater tots.\n\nThat's right...tater tots.  The 5th food group.  With two dipping sauces, one of which was cheese.  For like $2.  Also, while I didn't partake I did notice that on weekends they offer bottomless mimosas with their brunch menu.  $12...not a bad deal.\n\nTo recap:\n\n1. sitting in a bar with my dog\n2. getting buzzed on a Saturday afternoon\n3. watching Elite Eight basketball\n4. with a hot girl who's idea it was to watch the basketball \n5. eating tater tots\n\nWhoever called Disneyland the happiest place on earth never tried the Boardroom with that quint-fecta goin' on.", "author": "Jay W."}

We took a cab to North Beach to look around for a place to watch the game, and by some miracle we stumbled upon Woody Zips.

It is a locals bar, and that's nice since I live in the area, and have had my fill of tourists at day's end. The problem being that North Beach locals and I don't have similar tastes at all. See, I am a person that will actually gravitate more toward the divey bar than the posh one. \nSo, naturally I was excited by people's reviews saying it was a dive bar. When I arrived, I was reminded of why I don't fit in in North Beach. This place is NOT a dive bar, it's a cross between a neighborhood bar in a strip mall in Orange County (if those exist there) and a sports bar.\nPeople also claim it's laid back, so I wore a nice t shirt and jeans, and felt shabby in comparison.\nThis was a Thursday night, and it seemed to be on fire when we arrived, about midway through, the crowd was just one group and split. I thought Thursday was the new Friday? \nSo, most of the minus points are just because it wasn't my type of atmosphere, and because of the 90s corny lite rock/pop playlist. And a huge minus for the guy that turned the music off completely, then yelled for everyone to \"be quiet and listen for a cellphone.\" Buzzkilling douche!\nPlus points were having Afflingem on tap (with correct glassware), 2 dogs chasing each other across the place, and a nice bartender without 'tender 'tude.", "author": "Allie F."}
