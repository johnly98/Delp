The sandwiches looked like a true work of art. At presidio picnic on Sunday, the stand has 3 items on the menu: classic, kids grilled cheese, and nachos. You could add on items such as basil, arugula,bacon, tomato, pickled onions, candied jalape\u00f1os, etc. The standard price was $9 and you could add on all toppings for $6 (or $1-$2 individually). The sandwich comes in 3 pieces and it is very filling (basically a sandwich and a half). About my creation: beautifully grilled acme bread, 3 types of cheese, tomato, basil, arugula, and pickled onions. Also added sriracha aioli from the condiment bar. $13. The grilled cheese was very good but I think I'd rather have had one of their menu items that I've seen on the website (Nino I'm looking at you).  Would have loved to see  on the topping list or a grilled cheese with Brie and hot pepper jam. Line is long but service is super quick. \n\nFor all you families out there trying to enjoy your picnic Sunday, this place is very kid friendly with a kids grilled cheese that comes with fruit snacks and a Capri sun juice box.", "author": "Kara N."}

I mean, it's not like they're slinging out those (gross) Kraft grilled cheese sandwiches people!  These babies are huge, cheesy, and, most importantly, DELICIOUS!\n\nAfter doing a quick lap to check out Presidio Picnic's offerings, we knew we had to go back to the Grilled Cheez Guy stand when we saw person after person clutching onto their sandwiches.  Although there were only three different types available (Classic, Ham & Cheezy, Pastrami), they all sounded terrific.  Good thing my friend was down to split a couple!\n\n-- HAM & CHEEZY - Ham, Muenster, Cheddar, Horseradish Sour Cream...$11\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grilled-cheez-guy-san-francisco?select=3ptDpKTTc-yJZk1YzIinkw)\nEven though it tasted light on the muenster (it was cheesy, just cheddar heavy), they certainly didn't skimp on the ham.  It may not sound like much, but those four or five slices gave this a very meaty feel.  While the mix of flavors was very solid (and classic), that side of horseradish sour cream was perfect to help cut the sandwich's overall richness.\n\n-- PASTRAMI - SF Pastrami, Swiss, Arugula, Pickled Red Onion...$11\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grilled-cheez-guy-san-francisco?select=-xCHxjuHHanxbcBt4QNmeA)\nAs good as the Ham & Cheezy was, this was the star.  Not only was it even meatier, but it was just as cheesy and tasted even better.  The pastrami was both juicy and flavorful, and I liked the balance the arugula and pickled red onions added.  If this also had the same horseradish sour cream, it would've been perfect!\n\nWhile both sandwiches were obviously delicious, the bread they use is what really puts them over the top.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure what type they use (looks like ACME though).  However, on the outside, the crust on both was buttery (yet not too greasy) and had the ideal crunchiness to them.  On the inside, the bread was pretty soft and moist (which the cheese probably had something to do with).\n\nBesides how awesome these sandwiches are, the one thing I'd point out is how the hours listed on their Yelp page aren't very accurate (it only lists Sundays).  Instead, check out their Twitter to find out where they'll be and when (even their website is outdated).  Besides that, I have nothing bad to say about them.  Well, except that now, all future grilled cheese sandwiches I try will be measured against a relatively high bar.

I shared a quarter of it with my co-worker. We both loved it! I would have ordered the candied jalapeno's, but they ran out by the time I got in line. On the side is a habanero jam, which is not at all spicy. The vendor's told us that it would \"knock you on your butt\". That it did not, but I do eat spicy quite often, so maybe the heat just didn't effect me. Anywho. The bread was perfectly crunchy, cheese was just gooey enough. I added a thai chili pepper to the jam. Dipped the sandwich into my modified jam and enjoyed every bite!\n\nI docked down 1 stay because it is pretty pricey for just the sandwich. If they added even just a tiny side salad or celery and carrots, this would have been a 5 star review. \n\nI would go to this food truck every time if I saw it on the street.

I believe the price was $8-9 which i thought was a little pricey for some bread and cheese but i was proven wrong.  This tantalizing treat for the taste budz had me singing its praises all weekend.  The buttery crispy bread, gooey cheese, and overall enjoyment i experienced rivaled that of that first time a young man is left at home alone with just his room and an old sock.  I do wish they had some sort of frequent cheeser club so my 5th sandwich could be $6 or something like that but i will pay the cheese gods what is needed for this treat any time i come across it again. \n\nBottom Line:  Hands down the best grilled cheese you will eat!", "author": "Ted D."}

I ordered 2 to share so we could each try a couple of different kinds. One was the ham and cheese with avocado added and the second was the classic with bacon added. Sounds delicious right? They weren't. They were so burnt and it was mainly just burnt bread crust. Couldn't taste the cheese, meat or $2 \"avocado\" spread because the burnt crusty flavor was so overpowering.

The humble presentation wrapped in brown butcher paper was a nice nostalgic touch that revealed the gourmet ingredients upon my first bite.\n\nThe grilled cheese was made on Acme bread, toasted to perfection so it was crispy outside--though a tad greasy, so I was appreciative of the paper wrapper. The cheese inside was a mix of cheddar cheeses, melted to gooey perfection. \n\nThe peaches took a while--they had to be grilled perfectly tender--but they were so worth the wait.

We had the pleasure of having Michael and Justin cater our son's first birthday party in a local San Jose park. They are extremely flexible and cater to whatever you have in mind. The best part of their business is that they are a \"part\" of your party. They aren't your traditional food truck but more of a pop up shop which is so much better because they can mingle and be a part of your party. They arrived on time, are extremely professional and had a nice little set up with an EZ ups and their tables. We had selected 6 types of sandwiches and a side of chips and I can still taste the dessert grilled cheese in my mouth. The only thing I regret is not trying every sandwich. Michael's prices are super reasonable which was a great for us as we had him cater about 110 guests. Everyone left full and happy and I still keeping hearing about how yummy the sandwiches were every time I see someone that attended our party. He was also very accommodating to all my food requests and grilled the meat and veggie sandwiches separately. We have some egg and peanut allergies and he even catered to that. They brought plates, napkins, condiments and anything else you would need to serve food. It's amazing because you didn't have to worry about anything - just book them for you next event and see :) I can't wait to have him cater another one of our parties. Thank you both so much Michael and Justin!!!!", "author": "Harjeet J."}

He's a regular at dorkbotSF keeping the dorks fed and happy all night long so the fact you can tweet your orders to him and pay via square is also nice.  It looks like he's expanded the menu too - aside from grilled cheese and tomato soupshots - there's now grilled cheese + meat and desert grilled sammies too.  He's more portable than a food truck/cart so can serve you on a boat even!", "author": "X X."}

Perhaps it's because one of the three cheeses used was a goat cheese that left an I appealing after taste, or just that there was so much built up anticipation waiting so long.  I mean, the making of these sandwiches was such a production from the hand slicing of the cheese from huge blocks of cheese, to the slow cooking of these precious sandwiches pressed underneath foil wrapped weights.  Alas, the final product was a let down.", "author": "My H."}

I saw these guys set up a table last year in San Francisco where they  were selling  3 cheese w/ Acme bread grilled cheese sandwiches.They also had soups but they were already sold out of the soups. Since I had not had dinner and was on the go for most of the day, they delivered in a big way!!!!! I've never had a grilled cheese sandwich like these guys did it. The cool part about the sandwich is that they gave you huge portions of cheese and big cut slices of bread only to smashed by a brick!!! WTF! Great concept & great idea and let's just say I ordered 2 of them bad boys and did not disappoint!!!! If you ever see these guys set up, I highly recommend giving them a taste!!!!", "author": "Richard G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-22", "description": "\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Pretty much sums it up. Good bread grilled with Tillamook cheese that's it. Nothing fancy but also not that flavorful and definitely something any amature chef can make. $6 for a sandwich you could spruce it up and give me a paper plate or foil instead of napkins which stick to the cheese. $2 for a shot of watery bland tomato soup in a cold water cup. I wasn't sure if I was drinking tomato water or wax. Pickle was ok but was something you can buy from a jar at any deli. Surely not homemade. They pride themselves in the brick that they use to grill evenly. Nice technique for crunch but the end product was forgettable. Don't tell me you make the #1 best grilled cheese and about all your national recognition. If these are your products I call BS.", "author": "H Y."}

Can I say DEEELICIOUS!!!?   I first tried the one that had chicken apple sausage, goat cheese, and irish cheddar.  Oh man, that was pretty yummy and totally hit the spot.  I love how Michael warns you it's hot when he hands you the sandwich.  So true, I had to blow on it a few times because the melted cheese was steaming.   Ooh,  i was salivating just waiting to take a bite into the sandwich.  Anyway, I couldn't help order another sandwich after seeing people go crazy for the \"Frenchie\" - a grilled cheese sandwich made with carmelized onions, gruyere, and mozzarella.  Hands down, that sandwich blew me away.  I was pretty full from the first sandwich, but yet, I was able to finish this one.  I woke up this morning craving a \"Frenchie\".   Why does the GrilledCheezGuy not yet have a brick and mortar store in SF???   He would give American Grilled Cheese a run for it's money.   Anyway, I'll have to hire TheGrilledCheezGuy for my next catering event.  I know he'll be a hit among my guest.   Till we meet again, TheGrilledCheezGuy...", "author": "Christine C."}

Michael showed up right on time, fully equipped with rolling carts of amazing stuff: peaches, fresh beets, amazingly fresh bread, homemade tomato soup, hot sauce....and of course cheeses of many varieties.  A fellow New Jersey native (bonus points in my book!), he's very personable and low-key, and very easy company.  He got to work right away in our kitchen, preparing bite-sized snacks for us and our guests to munch on - prosciutto, cheese bites, small sliced breads, fresh pickels....really good.  Then the main course - starting with sliced beets with salt and a little smoky cheese, followed by really tasty tomato soup, followed by a choice of mild grilled cheese or super spicy.  For dessert, Michael prepared grilled peaches with a little cheese on top - we almost fought for the last one, they were that good.  Michael handles all of the setup and cleanup and seems very comfortable hanging out in the background or joining the conversation with your friends - he seems to have an excellent sense about that.  He's also very open to discussing how he became the Grilled Cheese Guy and what he does for his day job as he pursues his dream of owning his own sandwich shop.  We all have ZERO doubt that Michael's skills, personality, and drive will get him there.  You will NOT be disappointed with Michael and his professional, polished service.", "author": "Rick K."}
