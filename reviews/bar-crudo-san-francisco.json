Yes, you will likely have to wait a bit before it opens to secure your spot, but they seat everyone promptly at 5pm and your order arrives quickly as well.\n\nThe oysters here are always super fresh and well cleaned. They're served with lemon, hot sauce, and mignonette, but you can ask for horseradish as well if you'd like. We always get the manila clams, which are served in a briny white wine sauce. Get some extra bread to dip in the savory broth! The shishitos are a great snack for sharing and the chowder is consistently good. Off of the main menu, the uni toast is super creamy and delicious. Plus, the wine and beer deals during happy hour are reasonable too!\n\nOverall, great place to indulge in some seafood and wine. Will keep coming back for many more happy hours!", "author": "Joanna X."}

My friend and I came here with reservations at 7 pm and were promptly seated in their upstairs dining area.  As usual, we tried a little bit of everything:\n\n(1). Crudo sampler for 2 (4/5) - included Arctic char, scallop, tombo tuna and halibut. They were a little on the small side but very tasty. \n\n(2). Uni toast (5/5) - Santa Barbara Uni on toast with Yuzu, avocado and chicory.  This was a great preparation and the yuzu went really well with the Uni.\n\n(3).  San Sebasti\u00e1n (3/5) - tuna confit salad with tomato bread and Manchego cheese. This was OK but I prefer the Spanish version of the toast. Of all the seafood I had that night, this was the least impressive.\n\n(4).  Branzino (5/5) - this was just fabulous and I would order this again the next time I come here.  When they ask you if you want some bread, just say yes. You are going to want to use it to soak up as much of the sauce on that fish as possible. \n\n(5). Truffles (4/5) - great dessert including coconut, hazelnut and chocolate with nuts and honey. Nice and simple. \n\nFor my non-alcoholic pairing, I had their version of ginger beer. It's ok but I much prefer fever tree. Service was good but the restaurant was LOUD, LOUD, LOUD.  If it's just the food alone, I would have rounded up to five stars but the loudness of the restaurant negatively affected the overall experience.  With tax and tip, this meal was about $75 per person. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

The walls are white w/ the ceiling a dark shade that allows the white to pop even more. Is that even possible. \n\nThey offer only beer and wine here. If you're a beer person you more than likely won't find the typical beers like Miller, Coors, Corona and such here. Instead you'll be able to take a ride and explore the other beers that are out there. \n\nHere you get to enjoy some great fresh fish\n\nCrudo sampler for 2 (2 pieces each): ARCTIC CHAR, SCALLOP, TOMBO TUNA, BUTTERFISH - Each comes w/ it's on marriage of toppings to make it more flavorful than just sashimi.\n\nSeafood chowder - FISH, MUSSELS, SQUID, SHRIMP, POTATOES, BACON, CREAM - This was by far the best part of the meal for me. My girlfriend agreed 100%. Every bite was better than the last. It wasn't thick like most chowders are. More of a creamy texture. \n\nOctopus - Most places get octopus wrong where it's super rubbery.

For starters, if you didn't realize it by now or if you just started reading my reviews, I'm really adamant about being a planner. Weekend getaways, date night, family trip, happy hours after work, etc...I'm normally the one choosing where. This was one of the rare times I let someone else take the reigns and go. Not only in choosing the place, but in choosing the entire menu for the dinner. NO. REGRETS. \n\nOur friend recommended Bar Crudo and after fighting the horrendous parking situation (seriously, Lyft if you can!), we walked into the bustling, busy restaurant. We ordered rounds of fresh oysters, mussels, shishito peppers, seafood chowder, uni toast, manila clams, the crudo sampler, and this crab head thing that we're going to call Crab Butter Thing (I'll explain shortly). \n\nThe chowder was incredibly rich and the mussels were delish! I loved the manila clams because they were prepared in a white wine sauce which is exactly how I prefer them. The uni toast was crunchy and crispy and went well against the creamy uni! As for the crudo, if you don't know what crudo is, it's pretty much like sashimi, presented in different ways with different flavors the way you would prepare poke. Since we got the sampler, we had a little bit of everything. The servers recommend you eat it in a certain order, from lightest in flavor to heaviest. Our favorite was the Tombo Tuna because of the bright citrusy flavors! \n\nNow onto the dish of the night...the crab butter thing. It wasn't on the menu, but our friend said it was last time he came, so he asked if they had the \"crab heads with the stuff inside\" (LOL this is verbatim!!). They happily brought it out for us because they said they just forgot to add it to that nights menu. The crab is served cold and you dip the bread into the decadent insides and it's heaven. I've eaten that part of the crab before, but I don't know what it is that they add into it that makes it so amazing. Whatever it is, plz keep serving this forever, because I will order it forever.", "author": "Maleah M."}

The herb and jalapeno marinade is excellent.  The chowder was also impressive and had so many different variations of fish in it. Much better than other chowders that are instead just full of potatoes.  \n\nIf you don't go during happy hour, the menu still has a lot of great options, but for a jump in price. The crudo sampler is definitely the way to go. The cheese plate is also a great and pretty large for how cheap it is. \n\nAbsolutely love the decor in here.

Bar Crudo is one of those places. I met a girlfriend after work and we were 3rd in line, allowing us to sit front and center at the oyster bar when they opened a little after 5pm. Oysters on the half shell are $1.50 during happy hour, and we ordered a dozen. They were great! A little later we ordered a half dozen of the herb & jalapeno marinated mussels (also $1.50 during happy hour) which were just ok.\n\nWe each got two glasses of Vino Verde as we ate our food and caught up, and it was a very comfortable and relaxing environment.

With so many awesome restaurants in SF, why did I pick this place? Ugh\n\nFood and service both sub par. 3 main problems: \n\n1. Some of the oysters tasted weirdly salty - I've never had oysters that tasted so weird - I almost wanted to wash my oysters before eating. Out of the 6 oysters I had, the first 4 were all like that - I almost convinced myself that that's how their oysters are but then I had the last 2, they tasted just normal - not overly salty. The inconsistency in the flavor really bothered me. \n\n2. The seafood chowder was lukewarm when served. It was not very creamy or flavorful. It almost tasted like they used canned chowder that they didn't heat up throughly. They might not have done that but it surely tasted like they didn't put a lot of effort into the dish. The ingredients, especially the chicken, tasted mushy and bland. Oh well, as least the portion was small...\n\n3. My friend asked for some bread and the waitress brought over the bread and the check at the same time. Is that passive aggressive? You tell me. Now I always try to understand that businesses need to turn tables quickly but this is definitely not how you serve your customers. \n\nSpend your money somewhere else. Swan, Scoma's, Hog Island, Farallon, Anchor, and so many other good seafood places.", "author": "Iris H."}

They were very tiny but the broth was good. Really wish they had provided bread for dipping with that dish.\n\nThe only problem was the service which was very very slow (maybe bc we were sitting upstairs?). I also by accident spilled my water glass and we tried to clean it up ourselves. The waiter came by and was very deprecating about it (it was very odd- eye rolling and saying \"that's what happens when you're not careful\" and \"maybe you shouldn't leave your wet napkin where your food is\".\n\nBesides that strange experience the food was great- very pricey, but great!", "author": "Isabella L."}

Since I had a weekday off, I decided to finally stop by. I was meeting up friends, but I was the first one here on Thursday, December 21st as I arrived a little before 5pm. There was already a small crowd outside, but I managed to be the first person seated at the bar. I was assigned the corner for my party of three.\n\nHappy Hour: 5pm to 6:30pm\n*$1.50 Drakes Bay Oysters, Baja: order by 1/2 dozen or dozen \u00d76\n*$1.50 Herb & Jalapeno Marinated Mussels: order by 1/2 dozen or dozen \u00d76\n*$7 Pan Seared Shishito Peppers & Boquerones: lemon oil, sea salt, chives\n*$7 Manila Clams: red pepper flakes, sage, white wine\n*$8 Seafood Chowder: fish, mussels, shrimp, potatoes, bacon, cream\n*$11 Rod Cod Tacos (2 per plate): salsa, guacamole, pickled onions, cotija cheese\n*Merlot/Cab Blend, Domaine de Pellehaut, (France), 2016 ($7) \u00d76\n\nI didn't realize this until I was looking over the receipt to write this review, but we were charged for two extra glasses of Verdejo, Marques de Irun, (Spain), 2015 ($7). We asked them to split the check as the third person in our party arrived later. She was the one that ordered the two whites. That means we paid for two glasses of wine twice! I'm sure it was an honest mistake, but still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nOn to the food. Since we were here for HH, my gf and I decided to order the whole HH menu. Figured why not since we were here. My favorite dishes were the shellfish and peppers. The oysters were good. Clean, fresh, with a slight brine. Make sure to ask for hot sauce if you want a little kick. The mussels were good too, but I can only eat so many cooked mussels. Especially when they are served cold. The shishitos were nice and actually had a little spice. I also liked the addition of the fish on them. The rest of the dishes were just meh. The clams were kind of bitter from the alcohol, the chowder a little thin (though it did have a fair amount of seafood), and the tacos kind of bland. The HH red was fine. A nice drinkable table red.\n\nGlad I finally checked out Bar Crudo for HH, but a little upset that I didn't realized we were charged for glasses of white we never had. 3 stars for the food, but bringing my rating down to 2 because of that.", "author": "Elena N."}

We had oysters, the crudo sampler, the branzino, and seafood stew with a few drinks. The short and sweet - if you love fish, order the tuna crudo and branzino!\n\n1. Oysters: I had the miyagi, kumamoto, and baja oysters. I enjoyed them all! The miyagi were my favorite and are a softer springy oyster that was flavorful and a little sweeter than the others. The kumamoto were salty and dense, and the baja were small, salty with a medium texture. \n\n2. Crudo sampler: we had butterfish, tuna, scallops, and arctic char. We recommend eating the scallop, followed by the butterfish, next have the arctic char, and finally the tuna for the best overall bite. \nThe scallop and butterfish are very mild with soft flavors. You get a bite of wasabi, softened by the creme fraiche on the arctic char, and the tuna crudo is a flavorful balance of acid, fresno chili pepper and onion.\n\n3. Branzino: OMG THE BRANZINO! A whole beautiful fish prepared with shaved fennel, sliced mild peppers, cilantro, and finished with an acidic sauce/broth that I happily sopped up with bread. Top 2 most flavorful fish I've ever eaten.\n\n4. Seafood Stew: Delicious tomato base seasoned with chorizo pieces and full of seafood! We loved the clams, and enjoyed bites of squid, and cuttlefish.\n\n5. To drink: Pino Noir - Soft and fruity with red and purple fruit notes. Tempranillo - Complex, balanced a little earthy and so good. Golden wheat ale - It was on draft (I don't remember the name) and was very wheaty, but was great with all the seafood.\n\nWe live in the neighborhood, but this was our fist visit to Bar Crudo.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-04", "description": "My recommendation to my fellow Yelpers is to avoid Bar Crudo.\n\nThis comes from a recent experience that I feel is very much a bait and switch tactic.\n\nNamely,  we arrived at ~ 6.10 for the happy hour menu from Bar Crudo.  We were led to the side section across from the bar, and were told to wait there for a table.  So we waited there for 15 min while watching patrons who arrived after us get seated.  When I had made my second inquiry about seating, we were seated at ~ 6.30.  The waiter came to us at 6.31 (I checked) and told us the happy hour was over.  When I explained that we were stuck at the side tables with the hostess passing us by, she indicated that it was our fault for not understanding that full happy hour orders were to be placed from this waiting section prior to being seated to remain within the strictly-enforced window that ends precisely at 6.30.  \nTo me this has the look and feel of a classic bait and switch tactic.  There's so many great restaurants in SF that there is no need to deal with such poor practices. It's not even about happy hour specials really - it's about being treated like a complete jerk (and paying someone to do it).  \n\nI'll never go back.

Outside of HH, it gets really pricey here. The crudos are a must!\n\nI came with a group of 8 on a weeknight around 6 for HH. Luckily we were able to make a reservation 2 days in advance; otherwise, I don't think they could've accommodated us. The restaurant isn't super big. There's bar seating, some table seating and standing tables downstairs and a few tables upstairs. Definitely make a reservation if you have a group. Ambiance was lively and trendy yet cozy at the same time. Good for most occasions, casual and special. \n\nWe ordered mostly off the happy hour menu, which has some pretty good deals. The $1 oysters are a must, of course! We ended up getting 2 rounds of 2 dozen oysters, the shishito peppers and some of the group got the seafood chowder off the HH menu, and a few of us shared some of the crudos off the regular menu.\n\n* OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL ($1 each @ HH) - 5/5\nIf you love oysters, you'll love their $1 happy hour oysters. Super fresh.\n\n* PAN SEARED SHISHITO PEPPERS & BOQUERONES ($7 @ HH) - 4/5\n[lemon oil, sea salt, chives]\nA pretty small portion for the price. Simple, not too greasy like other shishito peppers I've had, and topped with a few tender anchovies (boquerones).\n\n* KONA KAMPACHI CRUDO ($14 for 4) - 5/5\n[orange, fennel pollen, orange oil] \nSo buttery soft, the kampachi basically just melts in your mouth. I loved the light citrusy sweetness from the orange. I don't think this crudo comes with the Crudo Sampler, but I'd easily get 4 of these instead of the sampler with 1 each of the other crudos, even though I'm normally one to like trying a little of more things.\n\n* TOMBO TUNA CRUDO ($14 for 4) - 4/5\n[citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko] \nGood but not as impressive as the kampachi.

Can't go wrong with uni and avocado spread\nSteam Clams: Fresh and delicious, great with bread.\nCrudo Sampler: Had Arctic Char, Scallop, Tombo Tuna and Butterfish. LOVE LOVE LOVE the Arctic Char, it was topped with cream cheese and wasabi roe, we ordered a separate plate of these. Scallops were decent, topped with a pea sauce and citrus peel.

The space is casual yet trendy, and the mermaid motif throughout is fun. We each started the meal with a crudo sampler (after all, it's not called Bar Side Salad!). This dish included Scallop (yum! the bite tasted like corn), Arctic Char (yum! didn't taste like corn though), Tuna (ditto) and Butterfish. Personally, I prefer butterfish prepared with pickled banana, but appreciate the chef opting for a grapefruit and almond base here. It was a refreshing, avant-garde, dare I say iconoclastic take on a favorite breed of fish.\n\nI then had the whole grilled branzino. While I view it as the mark of a lazy chef to serve a fish before removing its face, it did not bother me much. It was easy to fillet, though I missed a handful of bones. The fish was both juicy and flavorful - holy branzino! I finished the meal by eating one of the eyes - weird, as expected. One friend (we'll call him W.) tried the roasted crab and ate the entire thing. Another friend (we'll call her R.) had the lobster beet salad. By the looks of the cleaned plate, I'd say she enjoyed it - hah! My last friend at the table (let's switch things up here and call her Silly Sally) did not eat, as she wasn't hungry.

The ambiance was charming and intimate, perfect for date night. I highly suggest you make a reservation before coming here.\n\nPortions are very small, but they focus on quality and flavor. We started out with the Miyagi Oysters from Tomales Bay. Ask for a side of horseradish. They'll hand you a ramekin of grated dry horseradish which pairs well with your oysters. We also had the seafood chowder. SO GOOD! It had chunks of fish, mussels, squid and shrimp. The chowder was very creamy and flavorful. Make sure you ask for bread so you could dip it into your soup.\n\nThe uni toast was okay. The uni could've paired well with other accompaniments. They used sourdough for the toast topped with avocado. Whatever sauce they used, it was too sour and overpowered the buttery taste of the uni. The upside was that the uni pieces were big and fresh.\n\nNow onto the crudo. We tried every crudo on the menu. \nScallops with soubise, pickled corn, chili and chive blossom - Good, but the toppings kept falling off when picking up the scallops.\nKampachi with salmorejo, castelvetrano olives and orange oil - My least favorite. I'm a huge fan of kampachi, but the accompaniments didn't enhance the flavor of the fish. If anything, I'd switch out the olives and the rock salt.\nTombo Tuna with citrus, fennel, picked peppers and black tobiko - Refreshing combo. It was served in a small bowl, allowing the fish to soak up the citrus sauce.\nArctic Char with horseradish cr\u00e8me fraiche, wasabi tobiko oil and dil - My favorite crudo. It tasted like lox, minus the bagel and capers \nButterfish with gala apple, pink pepper and rosemary oil - My second favorite. The butterfish was delicate and delicious.\n\nThey also have a great happy hour! \n$1 oysters and mussels, \n$6 clams, seafood chowder and pan seared shishito peppers & boquerones \n$10 rock cod tacos\n$4 beer\n$6 wine", "author": "Helen C."}

Normally priced at $3.50 per oyster, I couldn't help but order a few dozens for myself since they are $1 each for happy hour. The Miyagi Oysters from Tomales Bay were really fresh, paired with the tabasco sauce and their vinegar mix; it was loaded with flavor and was quite refreshing. If I had the stomach for it, I could probably finish more than just a few dozens by myself... \nThe mussels were alright, I'm not too much of a fan so I'd stick with oysters only. \n\nMy friends recommended the Uni Toast (which is not on the happy hour menu) and also the fish tacos. I got to try a bit of the seafood chowder and it was loaded with flavor as well.\n\nYou can almost order everything from the happy hour menu and you'll walk out happy.\n\nGreat place for food, drinks and awesome prices for happy hour.", "author": "Sam K."}

Our service was subpar but I'm pretty easy going about service. They forgot my friends dish, which was one of the only things he could eat because he is on the keto diet. So he hadn't eaten anything all night. We bought some drinks and bread to hold us over as we waited for his food (we had finished ours). When he got it (genuinely an hour and a half after arrival), he didn't enjoy it actually which was a big bummer. I gave the waitress a 15 percent tip after what was actually really terrible service, the waitress glared at my tip in overt anger and threw it at the table where another waitress was at the register. My entire table felt incredible awkward as she publicly lamented our tip and she sighed angrily when we said \"thank you, goodnight\". It certainly was on the lower side for me as far as tips go. I am usually a generous tipper but because we had such a difficult time: I didn't feel comfortable tipping more: we ended up staying an hour longer than we planned. And mind you it was a 15% tip, it wasn't pennies. I had spent hundreds of dollars there already and I left completely alienated and upset by the public display of resentment.

The oysters were tiny -- arguably the smallest I had ever seen. In retrospect had I bothered to look up the type (Kusshi), I would have easily seen that they are known for their small size so maybe that's on me but still eh. \n\nWhat ended up being the nail in the coffin though was the uni toast -- I have had uni several times before and I am not sure if it was the uni or something else, but it was EXTREMELY salty like almost inedible.

Very possible, but felt the sauces over powered the oyster itself.\n\nUni toast - okay. To be honest I didn't know what to expect. The bread was good, uni was very good, and guacamole was good all separately, but not together. The guacamole was too acidic (too much lime) and strong in flavor. I couldn't taste the uni at all. The bread was toasted but could have had a nicer crisp. The uni was wonderfully fresh, sweet, and nutty. But when I bit into it together, everything was mushy and all I could taste was guacamole. Then the salad that came with it was way over salted and limed! Blah!

Our crudo sampler for two came with artic char, scallop, butterfish and tombo tuna. The scallop was our fave because of it's perfect texture, chili oil and the pickled sea beans were the perfect garnish. The artic char was my second fave because of the texture of the salmon but I wasn't a huge fan on the horseradish creme fraiche. The butterfish gained its place in third of the flavor but at the end of the day, I'm not a huge butterfish fan. The tombo tuna was our least fave because of it's texture, but keep in mind I'm comparing it to sashimi grade sushi. As for the flavor of the tuna, it was on point.

While prices seem high for the amount of food, I don't quibble with this as I figure the quality of the ingredients is very high.  The problem was the quality of the prep. \nOur bare plate of 5 medium-sized head-on shrimp at $2.50 each was $12.50.  Steep for very little food, but the problem was, while they may have been fresh, they were overcooked to the point of being mushy.  They tasted like they had spent too much time in the poaching pot, or had been previously frozen.  If I hadn't been sharing with new friends they would have gone back.  Our plate of 4 different raw seafood bites was quite good, but only the scallops really woke up my palate.  more please.  The seafood chowder ($9 for small bowl) was mostly a heavy cream stock.  Very little seafood was present, and the cream only had a faint seafood flavor.  That was a lot of calories for very little punch.  We shared mains.  I ordered the whole branzino ($32), and while the plate was beautiful, and the chili-herb \"salsa\" was tasty, if not inspiring, but the tasty branzino was again overcooked so much that it would have been entirely edible for someone without teeth.  What a waste of a nice fish.  My favorite part of the dish was the stocky salsa mixture which I scooped off the plate when the fish was gone.  Other dishes fared a bit better, but only the memory of the briny scallop stayed with me after the big check was delivered.  \nPreviously, I would have returned, if someone else really wanted to eat there, since it's in my neighborhood and a short walk from home, but after last Sundays dinner, I'll try to steer clear.

It is pretty amazing the types of tastes acquired from different regions with the oysters. Herby, creamy, acetic, briney, etc. The unami toast was creamy, crunchy, and tart with the avocado and lemon mix. The crudo platter was full of different flavors with each cut of fish. And to top it off, the seafood stew was unlike any other kind! Full of intense yummy flavors with each spoon. This was well worth the 45 minute wait (although I was getting tired of standing ;D). Well done, Bar Crudo. Well done.", "author": "Thanh N."}

Located on Divisadero Street and central to your foodie 3 blocks radius, this is a good place to grab some seafood.  \n\nParking can be a difficult cat and mouse game, and praying for the parking gods can turn something up... but when dining in Divisadero (north of the panhandle district), one must remember to bring coins, sharp eyes, and be ready to chow down with any restaurants as your selection.\n\nWe walked into the door and was greeting by Drew and told him we have a reservation. He told us to wait near the bar so the host can seat us. After we sat, Drew came back and ask us how was our day. Friendly, personal, and a great way to start our anniversary dinner. He also told us that we still apply to the happy hour special since we are early.  \n\nDrinks - Lambrusco sparkling red wine by the glass.\n\nWife wanted some sweet dessert wine (not for paring the seafood), but more for a good night out. With the recommendation, it wasn't bad.  I opt for just your normal water by the glass.\n\nOur first arrival - 1/2 Dozen Miyagi oysters from Tomales Bay, 4 Kumamoto from Washington. \n\nThe Special on this selection was the $1 Miyagi Oyster from Tomales Bay. We thought to give it a try. Along with the happy hour special, my wife loves Kumamoto and we proceed in ordering them on the main menu. The Oyster came on a chilled filled iced, and 6 Oysters on the left and the other half on the right. The middle center were two small dip sauce with a slice of lemon to wake th Oyster up.  \n\nWe must say, the Miyagi Oyster is by far tasty than the Kumamoto. It had a better taste, and more rich of freshness. A good way to start the seafood catch. \n\u00a0\nSecond arrival - Peel & Eat Gulf Prawns.  \n\nWe ordered four and our vision of Gulf Prawns where the black giant tiger prawns.  Boy were we wrong! As it arrived, we didn't think much of it until we took a double take. Is this Gulf Prawn? It wasn't bad in size but it wasn't giant size also. Your typical Prawn steam an chilled, then served on ice with dipping sauce with lemon at the center.\n\u00a0\nThird arrival - Crudo for Two: \nArctic char - horseradish creme fraiche, Wasabi tobiko, dill.  Scallop - corn puree, radish, chive.  Butterfish - pickled fennel, espellete pepper, Basile.  Tombo tuna - citrus, chili, yuzu tobiko\n\nWow. What a fresh taste! The the butterfish with a little hint of spice from the espellete pepper made your tongue sensor go wild and then calm with the mixture of Basile and fennel into the mix. The citrus and chili in the Tambo tuna lighten the mouth with fruit texture and a clean popping wash of the yuzu tobiko on each bite. The Arctic char had the smokey taste but a small clear of the noise of the Wasabi tobiko. And finally, the scallop is so fresh that it melt in your mouth on each bite. No need to chew like a gum, it just melt!   \n\u00a0\nForth arrival - Lobster and Tomato Salad: Burrata, little gems, corn, banyuls vinaigrette.\n\nThis dish is refreshing and light. It had all the right mixture but wished it had a little more lobster. But overall, a nice light dish to pack into the balance meal with greens/veggies.\n\u00a0\nFifth arrival - Seafood Chowder: Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes, Bacon, Cream.\n\nWe shared a large Chowder bowl and it was under the happy hour pricing. Can't beat that! The wifey said she could have passed on this dish, but I enjoyed it. It is different from other Chowder bowls we've tried, but it is just a little salty. If you didn't get bread on the side, it is a must to balance off the saltiness that comes from the Bacon, Cream, and Butter? \n\nSixth arrival - Roasted Crab: scallions, aleppo pepper, chili, verjus, tarrgon.\n\nWe wanted to give the crab a try as some reviewer mention it is a taste to try. Since we are here for seafood, why not! The Aleppo pepper and chili sure pack some heat to this dish. I like it but it is really messy. We were advise to be dirty when chowing down on this dish and we continued to say, bring it on. The crab isnt big and with each bite brought a good heat to the mouth and the tomato base tried to smooth out the heat. Overall, we will pass on this dish.\n\u00a0\nSeventh arrival - Crude for Two.\nWhat can we say, we wanted round #2 and nothing will explain more than Yum!\n\u00a0\nFinal arrival - Truffles on the house. \nWhat a surprise and Drew gave us House made Truffles for our Happy Anniversary dinner. All I have to say, it was tasty and sweet! The last taste of the night and it was good.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nA local small seafood hangout and must try during happy hours. We left with a fulfilled night out and all the dishes ordered were good to great. The noise level can be a little high as the place is small with high ceilings which echoes back conversation your next table patron having on heated discussion (or argument).  Great place to take out your love one for seafood chow down as a tapas kind of vibe because you can never order enough Oysters.", "author": "Mike T."}

And he ended up absolutely loving them!! BUT, after that, he went on a manhunt for some damn good happy hour $1 oysters so he could eat to his heart's content. \n\nAfter this recommendation from lots of his friends, we decided to come try it out after a knocking back a few cold ones at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival. We ALMOST didnt make it to happy hour because parking is horrendous, but we slid in 15 minutes before it ended. \n\nWe gotttt:\n-A dozen oysters: gives you a good amount of small and big oysters. These are a bit sweeter than the ones weve had before. fresh and sooo good\n-Half doze marinated mussels: i liked these because it had a very asian-y flavor to it. Had a slight kick from the jalapenos, which i loved. I also added a little lemon on top. These are also served cold.\n-Manila clams: MMMMmm these were delicious and warm! They are soaked in their white-wine goodness, kind of salty but amaazing. you can smell and taste rosemary and sage. \n-Seafood chowder: Creamyyy and had a great aroma. I loved this because it was hot and soupy and a great contrast from all the shellfish. Dip the bread they give you into the soup! also really good. My boyfriend and i did notice that the little chunks of fish are a bit dry, and has a huge ratio compared to the tiny amount of squid/mussels/shrimp though. He actually only got fish in his. \n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE! The vibe upstairs (only about 6 small tables) is romantic and date-y. It has dim lights and a really cool lamp hanging from the ceiling. Downstairs is  more of a mingling vibe, with a bar that you can eat at, a couple tables when you walk in, and these little nooks that you can stand at and order food. It may look like just a stand for plants and decor, but ive seen people have menus and food brought there. \n\nThis place is a must try for Happy hour.

The mussels were drenched in butter which is normally a good thing but I thought it was just ok. The seafood chowder was good. It had a lot of good chunks of seafood in it. It was a bit on the heavier side so its definitely nice to have a lot of bread to soak this up. The rock cod were tasty. I appreciated the fish to be grilled and not battered. These were kind of expensive though and it was $10 on the happy hour menu for 2 tacos.\n\nWe also shared some items from there regular dinner menu:\nuni-avocado toast and crudo sampler for 2 which consisted of artic char, butterfish, tombo tuna and scallops.\n\nThe uni avocado toast was a bit underwhelming. I was expecting a whole piece of toast but we had two small pcs of toasted bread with the avocado smear with uni. All the flavors were very distinct. The uni was pretty fresh but the avocado tasted more like guacamole. It was tasty but I wouldn't order this again. The sampler was a great way to try all their fresh fish bites.

Bar Crudo was high up on this list and may I state upfront, that my experience here also reflects the positivity.  I am known to shy away from seafood spots but this is now my favorite to-go-to in the event I am craving truly fresh and creative bites.\n\nFantastic happy hour menu and dinner menu in general.  Since my date is a regular, he proceeded to order from both menus: we started off with the Seafood Chowder (bowl), the Lobster Heirloom Tomato Salad, the Crudo Sampler for two, and Idaho Red Trout.\n\nFirst off, the seafood chowder here is exquisite.  It is a cross between New England + Lobster Bisque + chilis so the slightly spicy bite to the soup was welcome on a blustery evening.  The chowder is also chock full of chunks of fish, shrimp, squid, potatoes and let us not forget thicker chunks of bacon.  The bowl size from the happy hour menu is more than suffice, since the soup would fill one up too quickly.\n\nThe Lobster Heirloom Tomato Salad is a beautiful mix of soft lobster chunks atop sweet slices of tomato, sandwiched with spicy bits of arugula and a creamy alabaster melding of burrata cheese.  \n\nCrudo Sampler for two has a visually stunning display of 8 pieces of fish done up in creative and artistic flair.  My favorites were the Arctic Char (horseradish cream, wasabi tobiko, dill),  Butterfish (suncrest peaches, pasilla peppers, jamon serrano, shiso), and Ono (avocado, rhubarb and jalapeno relish, micro cilantro,\nBlack lava salt).  Each one came packed with flavors, mini petit fours style.  I hope my photo does the plating justice.\n\nLast but not least, the Red Trout is an amazing fish that melts in your mouth.  The mushrooms and potatoes provide the perfect boat to support the delicate flesh of the trout.\n\nThe pricing here reflects typical for seafood spots but for the ambiance, impeccable and kind service, and overall freshness/artistic/creativeness of the menu, I give it a top 5 rating.\n\nFor dates a perfect spot.  Check out their Happy Hour menu as well.  A steal.  Just remember to get in line quickly.  This little sliver of tastefulness fills up quite quickly.", "author": "Miika M."}

Doesn't get much better than that. Order the lovely and rich Seafood Chowder - then soak up every last bit with the fresh bread they give you as a starter. The happy hour white wine special paired nicely with the oysters and mussels, they also have a wide selection of beers to chose from as well.\n\nThe flavors of the Crudo Sampler are on point. Every piece was so fresh and paired with amazing flavors that complemented each bite perfectly. \n\nEnding the meal with a sampler of chocolate truffles was delightful. I have a huge sweet tooth, so this was exactly what I needed at the end of a great meal of fresh and flavorful seafood. \n\nLoved the ambiance of the restaurant and the service was great! Parking is tough in the neighborhood, would definitely recommend taking public transit. \n\nCan't wait to come back to taste more of the menu!", "author": "Megan K."}

It's not cheap, but seafood anywhere (and good quality seafood at that), is not inexpensive - so just be warned. I do want to come here for happy hour (5-6:30 pm) some time for $1 oysters. I may be stating the obvious, but if you're a vegetarian, you're going to have a really tough time eating here.\n\nAmbiance-wise, it's nice, with a lot of natural sunlight in the front and high ceilings. It can get loud, so you may not be able to hear other people in your group super well.\n\nCrudo Sampler (4 pieces, $14, 8 pieces, $28)- I got the sampler for 2, which came with 8 pieces, and shared with the person I was dining with. Or if you have a favorite, you can get 4 pieces of just that one fish for $14, but I really liked the variety. The cuts of fish were thick, the fish was fresh, and each piece had a little bit of garnish to make it a little extra special and unique (a hint of wasabi, a piece of kumquat). The garnish or sauces didn't overpower the taste of the fish, which I appreciated.\n\nUni Avocado Toast ($14) - It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but it's expensive (yes, I know it's uni), for what you get. The size of the \"toast\" was like those mini toasts you get in a box from Trader Joe's, and about 2 inches long. It was topped with avocado and uni and dressed with too much lime, which was just overpowering. I'll stick to uni at Japanese restaurants, and stick to avocado on a thick slab of toast at places like Jane or Reveille Coffee. Came with a small salad (or maybe it was decoration) that was overly limey, but I ate it anyways because I was wondering where the rest of the dish was, and I was hungry.\n\nBranzino ($28) - The fish was nice and well-cooked and seasoned, but you'll be picking around little bones all night. Just be warned. Compared to getting 8 pieces of sashimi for $28 and getting an entire filet of fish, this is probably a better deal and will keep you relatively full.\n\nAll in all, it was a pricey meal - for 2 people, with the crudo sampler, 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine and branzino, it was $114 before tip & tax. I left feeling satisfied and not overly full, which was nice, but I think you can probably get a better meal for $60-70 per person elsewhere in the city. I will come back for happy hour and will stick to the crudos next time I'm here.", "author": "Christina L."}

The restaurant is pretty cozy and intimate upstairs, but it still had a nice vibrant setting.  \n\nI loved how the restaurant was being conscious about the CA water drought that their menu noted that they'll only serve water if you ask for it.  You have to ask for bread as well.  Love that they're not wasteful!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n-Crudo Sampler for 2 (scallops, Tombo tuna, butterfish, arctic char)\n-1/2 dozen oysters\n-San Sebastian (salad with tuna confit, asparagus, roasted red peppers, caperberries, olives, manchego cheese, soft boiled egg, tomato bread)\n-Seafood Chowder\n\nThe crude and oysters were super fresh.  Loved the Tombo tuna with nice acidity.  The San Sebastian salad definitely had flavors that reminded me of our trip to San Sebastian and their signature seafood chowder has flavors similar to a lobster bisque, but with tons of hearty seafood in it.  With a glass of sparkling rose and a viognier blend, I definitely left happy!\n\nOur server was also super friendly and attentive.

I took a few sips of my wine and noticed that the glass was completely covered with dust on the inside and there was a thin film of dust on the wine with three very noticeable large specks. I called the server over to let her know there was a lot of dust in my glass and in the wine and she said \"Let me take care of that for you.\"\n\nA few seconds later they bring me a clean glass WITH THE SAME FUCKING THREE PIECES OF DUST IN MY WINE.

As in: we'd finished eating, our plates were cleared, and we were sitting around wondering when it was coming out. I'd say 25-30 minutes. \n\nThen - the table next to us got the branzino, and it looked amazing. Our server notices us eyeing the menu again and magically appears by our table, wondering if we're thinking of ordering more (he wasn't being out of place at all - we did keep a menu at the table and mention this was a possibility earlier). I said we had a concert to catch and how long would the branzino take? 7 to 10 minutes. Wow, that's it? Yeah we're getting it. It looks delicious.\n\nI decide to time it. Normally I wouldn't be so anal, but I asked about the time specifically because we were in this time crunch, and the only reason I ordered this was because he *assured* us it would take 7-10 minutes. I ordered the branzino at 8:26pm. 8:36pm passes. No branzino. 8:45pm passes. A branzino comes out from the kitchen!.... and goes to the table next to us. I ask our server if our chowder is still on its way out (we had ordered this at the start of the meal. More than an hour ago). Yes, he said, it's coming. You'd think this would prompt the dish to come out. Nope. By this time my stomach is growling I'm so hungry. FINALLY the fish comes out at.. maybe 9pm? We devour it in minutes. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded a dish taking this long, but don't set a completely false expectation!!\n\nHOWEVER, at the end of the night - REDEMPTION!

I wanted to be adventurous and try two beers I've never tried before. Unfortunately I picked two that were not really to my liking. Oh well.\n\nWe sat down for dinner and contemplated what to order. We were told that the kitchen closes in 30 minutes, so we'd have to order soon. Our waiter was very nice, amicable, and very attentive. Props for this! It was busy and he made sure we were taken care of.\n\nFood:\n++Sashimi (Artic Char, Salmon, Tuna) - We asked for some honest opinions on which ones to order. Most of the table normally likes hamachi, as does the waiter, but he didn't recommend it. We went with the other ones. \n\nThe Artic Char was definitely the best one. Salmon and Tuna were so-so. Our cuts were fairly fresh, but it definitely wasn't the freshest sashimi I've had. The portions were large and usually come with 4 pieces per order, but they were able to do 5 and prorate the 5th piece proportionally. \n\n++Uni Avocado Toast - These were okay, but definitely not great. It was missing something to give it that wow factor. Perhaps a garlic basil pesto, or a light sweet shoyu sauce, but something needed to complete this dish. On it's own, the uni was pretty good and paired well with the avocado, but leaves you scratching your head asking what completes this dish? Wash it down with a light beer or white wine and move on.\n\n++Lobster Tomato Salad - I was so sad that they didn't have the Beet salad, as I was craving it. This salad wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super memorable. The tomatoes were large, sweet, and juicy. The lobster portions were also pretty decent. Flavours worked nicely together.\n\n++Raw Oysters - The raw oysters were fairly good. Some of the oysters were a bit on the smaller end though. We ordered one of each kind per person. Let's leave the oysters at neutral.\n\n++Seafood Chowder - The seafood chowder was very very delicious. Some people thought it was a bit spicy with a slight kick, the others didn't. I can taste the kick, but it wasn't spicy for me. The flavour was there, and it was a nice subtle hint. There was a lot of chunks of seafood inside which is always welcomed. Just a neutral warning, this seafood chowder is extremely heavy and will for sure fill you up. It's so worth it though. \n\nThe decor on this place is very interesting. Really depends on your style of art, but my roommate and I really enjoyed it. It's a bit odd and confusing for some people, but I think it's very artistic and creative. To each their own! Other than that, the lighting is dimmed, and its very cozy and intimate. Good for small parties and perhaps dates.\n\nOverall, the service was good, and the food was decent, but I was really hoping for this place to blow my mind. The price is just a bit on the more expensive side for what you get, but overall isn't bad. Everything in this review directs it to a A-Ok rating. Sums it up perfectly.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this place, but I'm sure that won't stop you from going. However, I probably won't return to this place.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

I did read the reviews and looked over menu before I went and decided it was a good place. When my girlfriend and I arrived, the place looked nice inside and it wasn't crowded. We were seated and our server came over to the table and said, \"Hello.\" It was basically that point where it started to go down hill because he didn't say anything else  other than that. We asked for water and when he returned with the water, he took our order, then he never really returned to our table.\n\nSomeone else brought us our food and by this time our water was empty. The guy that took our order randomly came back once we received our food, said \"Here, you'll want this for your sauce,\" placed some bread right next to me, like it was for only me and left without refilling our water. We did see everyone else getting refills without asking. After we finished eating someone else came and cleared our plates and we just sat there. No bill, no water.\n\nI haven't mentioned his name to this point because he never introduced himself so I asked another server for his name and the manager but of course the manager left for the evening. \n\nSo, while we sat waiting before asking for him, Andrew was busy eating and drinking behind the bar and comping a bottle of wine for the obnoxiously drunk guy sitting next to us. Oh and I forgot to mention that it is very loud in there. \n\nAndrew eventually returned when the other server obviously tipped him off about our dissatisfaction. He said there must have been a mix up when he turned the table over to another server but he never informed us of the change, nor were we introduced to a new server. He tried making up by bringing us some truffles but my girlfriend doesn't eat chocolate. It annoyed me even more that he didn't ask if we would like the dessert.\n\nNeedless to say, next time I'm in SF I won't be returning to this place and I won't be recommending it to any one else. \n\nI give one star for Jen helping us out at the end of the evening and another star for the food being good.", "author": "Ian S."}

Happy hour commenced with a short wait in line while the friendly wait staff began shucking and chowdering, and at 5:00 sharp we swarmed inside, ready to feast our lips upon as much crudo seafood as possible. Our seafood nirvana commenced with a luscious bowl of the creamy seafood chowder, full of cream, bacon, and \"every type of seafood served\" at the bar. We were particularly impressed by the unexpected dainty purple mini octopus friend who took a swim in our chowder! Other favorites of the meal included the vinho verde wine, which is slightly fizzy, but sure to make your head dizzy with bliss. And don't even get me started on the oysters and mussels--yonic, creamy, and adorned with a plethora of delicious sauces you don't even need as they are so impeccable and fresh on their own. And this mollusk paradise was merely the foreplay in our pleasurable experience at bar crudo, as the climax certainly came upon receiving the check-- only $60 for multiple glasses of wine and one of nearly everything on the happy hour menu.

Reservations at 6 meant just in time to squeeze in happy hour (which ends at 6:30), and the soup-loving parentals dug the $5 seafood chowder cups.\n\nThe chowder came chocked with seafood goodness, while the bacon-infused broth reminded me more of a thick, hearty bisque than a brothy, satisfying soup. Other happy hour priced bar bites included the shishito peppers (meh), the spicy-tinged marinated mussels (liked the spice), and $1 oysters.\n\nThe dinner menu proved more promising, if more expensive. The menu is sparse, split into three entree-ish sections: raw, cold, hot. Like many a modern restaurant, dishes aren't meant to be eaten in traditional appetizer to entree form. Mixing in a big group is preferable.\n\nThe raw dishes are perhaps Bar Crudo's finest offerings, a take on sashimi that clearly screams Asian fusion. We tried five of six, leaving off the most traditional Ahi Tuna cube. The creme fraiche Char is reportedly the house favorite. I most dug the Ono and its sweet-spicy-sour grapefruit-jalapeno complement, while the table fawned over the Fluke and Quail Egg, heavily laced with truffle oil. Word of caution: these bad boys are neither cheap nor filling.\n\nCold dishes were forgettable. I wouldn't order either the San Sebastian (tuna confit with various side dishes) or the lobster beet salad again, though the lobster chunks were thick and hearty.\n\nThe sauce for the head-on Louisiana Prawns was spicily delicious, though being from so close to the Gulf, I'd call it more \"Franks Red Hot\" than \"Lousiana Hot Sauce\" spicy. The whole roasted Branzino was a crowd-pleaser for this Asian table, and a very good dish to share for a large party.\n\nI was set to award Bar Crudo five stars until a visit to the nothing short of incredible Swan Oyster Depot the next day. The freshness of Swan put Bar Crudo to shame, and it was easy to see some of Bar Crudo's more egregious errors. Most notably, the stuck-on shrimp shells was disappointing, and the oysters tasted short of sea-worthy fresh.\n\nAmbiance and waitstaff were solid, and our second story booth was cozy and comfortable.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

The mussels are full of flavor and have a marinated jalapeno type salsa on them.\n\nCrudo- I had the crudo sampler for one last time I visited and it was delicious, I definitely reccomend this if you visit.\n\nUni Toast- the staff is SO insanely nice and accomodating and never seem to get annoyed that you are just there for HH... my server (gentleman behind the bar) was nice enough to let me do a half order of Uni toast since I was by myself (met a friend after next door at Mojo). I am obsessed with Uni and the toast is a nice thick fresh sourdough chunk toasted and topped with creamy avocado and super fresh uni, if you are an uni fan you must get this.\n\nDelicious food, great happy hour prices and friendly, helpful staff... go TODAY! Also, their HH doesn't end until 6:30 which is a plus for those of us who work traditional hours and always struggle to get to a 6pm happy hour cut-off :)", "author": "Sarah A."}

I love their interior, ironically modern but vintage in a cute little building with two floors. Good variety of wines and beers. We ordered their sashimi platter, tacos, lobster salad, and oysters for appetizers. We shared a couple fish dishes, clams, their antipasto plate, mussels, and shrimp for our main course. It's fun to try small plates here but their portions aren't average portion sizes. Sashimi and seafood was fresh, but some dishes were a bit greasy. Overall a fun experience with really good customer service.", "author": "Christina L."}

We sat upstairs in the biggest table that holds 6 people, The menu was a little limited i thought so i ended up getting the lobster salad and lobster bisque. The soup was really good and creamy, they put enough pieces of lobsters in it. The salad was a little ehh for me. It had huge pieces of lobsters, but i didn't feel like the lobster and salad connected well together because of the dressing they used. i probably should have ordered something else, but at that point i was already over my limit for the night.  \n\nThis would be a nice place to check out on a date if your date likes seafood.

I was disappointed that the online draft list was not up to date so they didn't have the Dogfish head Noble Rot Saison on tap, but we managed to find a Belgian and bottled Strong Ale to try.  The bartender also poured us a sample of a sour we considered ordering, which was very kind.  For food, my sister enjoyed her oysters.  Not particularly caring for raw oysters, I had the chowder which I actually found disappointing.  The broth lacked any hint of seafood flavor and really just tasted like seasoned heavy cream.  The good news was that there was a decent amount of seafood in the bowl.  The seafood was very fresh, but unfortunately some of the more delicate meats such as the crab were overcooked.  I simply cannot understand why people would rave about this dish... did we get a subpar batch?  But at least one positive note is that because it is so hearty, after finishing the chowder with some complimentary baguette I was stuffed so, dinner for $6!  \n\nIf you like oysters this is probably a great spot.  The bar faces the oyster shucking station and there is no unpleasant fishy smell so you know the seafood is very fresh.

We had eaten at their sister restaurant, Seaside Metal in Guerneville, but never dined here.  \n\nWe got there at 4:45 and waited for the door to open, and by the time it did there was a line (we were first--woohoo!).  We sat at the bar and took advantage of their happy hour pricing.  I must mention here that some happy hour items were not that much of a discount ($7 for the chowder instead of the normal $8) but there were two things you must order and get the bang for your buck: $1 oysters and $1 mussels.  That was a great deal!  The oysters were Drake's Bay--very nice, and the mussels were AMAZING with the jalapeno marinade.  Wow.  We ordered the $6 glass of white (nice deal).  We ordered the shisito peppers (underwhelming) and the chowder--best chowder I've had.  Holy moly...the fish was delicate and the squid was perfect, along with the shrimp--they knew how to cook the fish and put it in the chowder at the right moment.  You have to order this--it really is that good.  We did most of the crudo dishes and really enjoyed those as well (arctic char was my favorite) but my dining companion complained that some parts of the fish were nicely seasoned, while others were way over salted (I think this is partially due to the large grained salt they use).  The server was perfect--engaging when she should be, letting us talk when we wanted, and was very attentive when our dishes were empty or we wanted to order more.  That's a difficult for many servers to really get down, and ours was good.  \n\nWould definitely go back--if you don't have reservations or want to sit at the bar, get there when they open.

All of that ~ of course, an understatement to the quality Bar Crudo has to offer. You must try it for yourself...\n\nSince he had been here before and we have similar taste in food, I asked him to order for us. Each dish and drink was like an even bigger and better surprise, even the order which he had them served was perfect. \n\nTo start he ordered a bottle of Allagash Curieux (Bourbon Barrel-Aged Tripel), served in wine glasses - it's such a smooth start to dinner. I was very impressed with this beer, but more so in the selection by my date. Absolutely perfect. \n\nThey brought in the first plate, the Bar Crudo Sampler for two. The arctic char with wasabi tobiko, hokkaido scallop, tombo tuna, butterfish with blood orange, radish, pink peppercorns. It was incredible and each piece melted in my mouth.\n\nNext up, the Oysters. *Le Sigh* I love raw oysters. While I loved them spicy, he liked the taste of the oyster itself. While we both agreed one was the BEST, I can't remember the name for the life of me. They had Kumamoto, Miyagi, Beausoleil, Malpeque, Kusshi and Pickering Passage. \n\nBefore the rest of the meal comes, he orders a bottle of Cinque Terre, a dry white wine that had a delicate bouquet and suited the seafood perfectly. While she is pouring, he tells me about the area of Cinque Terre's small coastal villages in region of Liguria in the province of La Spezia. I'm enchanted by my glass of wine and loving hearing about where it's from. \n\nNext up, the Lobster Beet salad, with gold and chiogga beets, burrata, mache, pistachios, banyuls vinaigrette. Very Beautiful and light. So delicious. \n\nThen to finish, the Seafood Chowder, which was perfection in itself. I don't think I have ever had anything like it and have thought about it quite a lot since that day. The bread is just as precious as you want to dunk every bit of it in that rich and wonderful soup.\n\nHe knew I'd love it and I did.

The only negative is that they actually do not have AC.  Really??? A raw bar that doesn't have AC.  Also it is just our luck that we picked one of the hottest day on record to come to SF...unheard of.\n\nWe made a reservation for 5:00p on a Saturday and happy to find out it was actually happy hour.  The front door was wide open which I thought was kind of odd on a hot summer day.  Well it didn't take long to realize why.  It was such a hot day and the restaurant was packed with people that it was really uncomfortable to dine there.\n\nSince it was happy hour, they were offering oyster for 1/2 price. There were also other items 1/2 price on the menu.  We decided to order a bunch of appetizers.  To start, we ordered 12 oysters on the half shell to start then the seafood chowder.  When the oysters arrived, they looked dried for the most part.  We were so hungry we ate it w/o any complaints.  The seafood chowder and tacos were really delicious.  The food is definitely tasty, but it's difficult to enjoy taste of food if you have to endure the heat and wave off flies the entirety of your meal.  Just no fun.\n\nBy the time we were done, we were full but just meh about the experience.  However, we decided to order another 12 oysters since they were making the rounds for last happy hour orders.

Hence the 3.5 stars.\n\nWith all the options in SF for good seafood, I don't think I'll be back to Bar Crudo anytime soon.  For me, the entire experience has to be memorable.

However, the dishes had its high and lows. Overall, the food was prob 3.5 stars. But I decided to go with 3 for how noisy it was, making it annoyingly difficult to carry a conversation during dinner. \n\nGood:\nCrudo sampler- well executed and delicious. Flavorful and airy, while still holding raw fish as the star. \nRaw oysters- delicious, fresh....can't go wrong\n\nOkay:\nLobster salad didn't have as much lobster meat as I had hoped. The mozzarella, while fresh, seemed misplaced. It didn't go with the cold lobster, and wasn't much of a dressing for the greens since the mozzarella just clumped together, and you had to eat it on its own. At least the lobster was cooked well, so that was the main redeeming quality. \n\nBad:\nDevil Prawns-the dish was more salty than spicy. The prawn had good spice and flavor, but it was just so salty, I couldn't eat much of it. The broth was too salty as well for me to really enjoy the dish. Huge dissapointment.\n\nOverall, given the price and the crowd, I was hoping for better and more consistent execution of their dishes. I will prob come here just for their crudos and raw bar, but I def had better.", "author": "Nancy Z."}

Totally forgot it existed, and then went asap as soon as I randomly spotted it on Yelp! Did not help that I had gotten wayyy too much sun earlier that day at the Chipotle Cultivate Festival and there was a whole table of people wearing the festival's uniform next to us! Great minds!! \n\nWe got the crudo sampler, butterfish, and the Louisiana prawns which my date had no idea how to deal with so I ended up peeling all his prawns for him! The crudo sampler was the best part of the meal!!! Actually the Artic Char was. Omnomnom. I fucking love raw fish! and it comes with Butterfish which is my all time favorite. We should have just ordered five more of these instead of our entrees since they both sucked. Whack whack whack. \n\nWe also got a bottle of Malbec and even though I wasn't feeling well I still ended up powering through and finishing the bottle. NBD. Service was never that nice which is super annoying especially when I'm always all smiley and all THANK YOU ^_^  and they say nothing in response and just move on quickly to the next table wtf. Fuckers. \n\nAnother huge negative...NO DESSERT MENU! WTF. They must be losing out on so much money by not serving dessert. I think all they had were truffles? NOPE. Dude they could have served anything remotely close to dessert for like $10 and I would have still paid it. MUST SATISFY MY SWEET TOOTH. WHY WOULD YOU NOT SERVE DESSERT. So bizarre. Over it!!!!

The lobster is sweet, the beets are hearty and the mozzarella is fresh. Throw back a couple kumamoto oysters in addition to start dinner off right. I had a couple glasses of prosecco to lighten up the creaminess of the clam chowder. I liked the little kick it had in every bite. I was also surprised by the big chunks of fish in the bowl. I could have gotten by with a cup due to the richness. Between scoops of chowder, i'd fill my fork with branzino and big pieces of trumpet mushroom.

We didn't wait long at all, so that was exciting. \n\nThe ambience of this place is very bar like, very small and quaint. It is very hot on the small upstairs level they have. The service was quick, prompt and friendly. The oysters were unbelievably delicious with different type of sizes, and the condiments were just cocktail sauce and another type of sauce, not quite sure what it was. We also ordered the seafood chowder, which was amazing! It contained fish, mussels, squid, shrimp, potatoes, bacon, and cream. It wasn't very thick like the usual chowders I've had, but that didn't matter due its rich flavors and aroma it had. \n\nIf it wasn't on a happy hour menu price, I probably would not have gone here.

It did come out last, when we were pretty full already. House bread was complimentary, and we asked for it about 4 times. I think the server was a tad bit annoyed! Lol. Uni toast ($14) was a bit on the sour side, I don't know why. It was also my first time having uni. It was so buttery, it melted in my mouth. Overall, we received pretty good service.

Arrived their early ( ~6:45pm) and was able to be seated right away. In my experience, a reservation isn't needed cause this place isn't overrun, but it wouldn't hurt. Plus, it's super easy to get one using OpenTable. AND, if you do end up on a waitlist of some sort, there's plenty of bars and cafe's nearby in NOPA (The Mill, Candybar, Flybar etc.)\n\nOur server was incredibly kind and patient with us as we selected what wine by the glass we wanted. You can try the various wines they serve by the glass before deciding. We ended up selecting a Gruner that was light, crisp and mineraly to go with the seafood.\n\nThe atmosphere for dinner on that day was very East Coast yacht club-y. Low lighting plus an open bar where you can watch the cooks shuck shellfish sitting on ice. Lots of wine glasses and sweaters and women wearing jewelry. If you've been to Hog Island, it has a similar vibe with less tourists (and not as good oysters).  \n\nWe ordered the Crudo Sampler for two, the San Sebastian, and the Seafood Chowder. So what's a crudo? 'Crudo' essentially means 'raw'. The crudo sampler is an assortment of their various raw fish dishes, which the pictures on Yelp can better show than I can explain. You get 4 pieces/person and they taste amazing. Complex and immensely satisfying. If you like sashimi, you will enjoy it.\n\nThe San Sebastian came to us highly recommended by our server who described it as a deconstructed nicoise salad -- she's right, it's essentially a deconstructed nicoise salad. We were surprised by how good this was, if you're not as into raw fish definitely try this one out as the tuna is cooked.\n\nThe Seafood Chowder is a tomato and cream-based chowder to which they add bacon bits. I am a fan of comforting rich foods, and this hits the spot. The price structure is $8 cup / $16 bowl, and protip: if you're going to share between 2 people, I'd recommend getting 2 cups because you'll get more soup for the same price\n\nOverall, this place is great. Good food, good atmosphere; it's not too loud or busy which a lot of nice places in SF can be and the price isn't ridiculous for the quality of food you're getting. You're getting the nice restaurant on Valencia St vibe but more enjoyable and without the crowds. Enjoy!\n\nAlso: They have a really great Happy Hour deal from 5-6:30.

The tip was about 18%.  18% for shitty service, i think that's pretty good.  She gave us a WTF look, rolled her eyes and said, \"ok.......\"  and proceeded to walk away.

You can get dungeoness crab or a seafood tower with some Spanish cava for a big, nice dinner. If you want to eat a light dinner simply try ordering the crude sampler for one or two. The crude sampler is my favorite item on the menu. It has some great arctic char, and scallops atop sweet corn puree.", "author": "Hannah G."}

Also, try one of everything; all the items we ordered were fresh, rich with flavor, and made us say \"ohhh\" after every bite. The chowder really stood out to me. It has got to be one of my favorite chowders (top 3 easy). Bonus - it's spicy (!) and I didn't even have to ask for hot sauce. The ahi tuna was served with a soy ginger sauce. The tuna was so succulent; it almost melted like butter. ::Pardon me while I go drift off into tuna heaven:: And though I'm not a big fan of lobster (What!? I know, I'm weird. I just don't crave it that's all.), the lobster salad was (sing it like Fergie) tasty-tasty.

This was SO GOOD and the consensus favorite. Each sample instantly melted in my mouth. The butterfish was the best!\n- Uni Avocado Toast: 4 pieces for $14. Honestly it looks so much bigger in the Yelp pictures, but I could fit two in the palm of my hand. The texture was so good, as you would expect uni and avocado to feel. The flavor was a little off however, definitely had one too many drops of lemon juice so it was sour and at the same time a bit bland.\n\nWe were about to order the $6 chowder but looked over to the table next to us and saw how small the bowl was so decided against it.\n\nPerhaps with a lower price point or bigger portion this place would be awesome.

While, I do enjoy minimal and authentic sashimi /nigiri time and again for sushi. These sampling bites retained to a certain umami quality about the profiles of the paired ingredients. One does really experience fish on a different level when juxtaposed with unexpected flavor compliments.  In order of taste preference:\n1. walu: rich, buttery flavor that was offset with some lean prosciutto\n2. ono: lean, firm, moist topped with mango relish that tasted like pine\n3. scallop: mildly sweet, topped with green roe that had a subtle horseradish heat to it.\n4. arctic char: rich taste, that was a mild cross between salmon and trout. \n\nThe whole roasted Branzino was a bit difficult to eat without casting tiny bones with each fork-full. (Perhaps a bone disclaimer may have been helpful) The compliments of butter beans, swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, poblano peppers, orange oil really made this dish, as the fish itself was very light and subtle, with a silky texture.\n\nDespite the bones, I will definitely find my way back here.", "author": "Ty T."}

Made reservations on Opentable.com and changed it a couple of times (including day of). Parking was so easy on a Sunday late afternoon (around 5:15pm) so we arrived 20 minutes early. The hostess accommodated us and kindly guided us to our table - poured us cucumber infused water (yum!) and handed us the menu (HH and regular). \n\nSince we already knew what we wanted, we went ahead and ordered a few minutes later. The food came our relatively quickly (since most of it is raw) and the service was amazing! One lady kept coming over to our table to ask if everything was going alright and kept giving us bread for our sauces and soup. She was very nice and made the experience more delightful.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Miyagi Oysters $1 each\nMy bf loved his oysters (I didn't have any since I'm not a fan). He said they were extremely fresh and the two sauces complemented the oysters really well.\n\n2. Marinated Mussels $1 each\nSuper flavorful and these mussels were so meaty! Would recommend these gems :)\n\n3. Manila Clams $5\nNot too many clams, but again, super flavorful! I loved the sauce it was cooked in so much that I asked for more bread to dip in it! Though don't get overboard cause it could get a bit salty. My bf commented that if a hot link were to be liquified, it would taste like this (the sauce). \n\n4. Crudo Sampler $13 (not on HH menu)\nCame with 4 different items: artic char, scallop, ono, and butterfish. My favorites were the artic char and the scallop. Though I didn't think it was spectacular (I think I had too high of an expectation from all the great reviews). Don't get me wrong, the fish were really fresh and the complex flavors were executed well, but I don't think I would crave for it... The ono and butterfish were too fatty and soft in texture for me. \n\n5. Seafood Chowder $5 \nNot your ordinary chowder. Not super thick, creamy, nor filling like clam chowder. It does have a tart tomato-y flavor to it (so a little bit too sour for my liking), but I still enjoyed it. My bf LOVED it and was the highlight of his meal. Though the chowder looks small, it's packed with seafood (fish and shrimp) and potatoes! I asked for even more bread to accompany the chowder, which made it less tart-y and more delicious! :)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was great. Prices are good for seafood, but portions are pretty small. We managed to spend almost $50 for our pre-dinner happy hour snack.... The food was fresh and full of flavor, but I didn't think it was mind-blowning that I would come back anytime soon. I just wanted to try this place based on the great reviews. But you should definitely give this place a try if you haven't already done so. The seafood chowder is featured in the 7x7 2012 Big Eats guide!

Anyways with that said, I came here for happy hour, happy hour is from 5pm-6:30pm. Get here early because by 520 or 530 it's already packed. They have a  downstairs dining area and upstairs they have a smaller area with a really cute corner table that could seat about 6-7 people. \n\nBest oysters I've had for happy hour this far. Usually places serve the same type of oysters. I can't remember for the life of me what type I had but they creamy and smooth $1. Seafood chowder is amazing(ask for bread so you can dip it instead of spooning it) $6. The cod tacos were light and clean tasting 2 for $10. And the muscles stole the show. $1. Beer $4. \n\nMinus 1 star because the staff were in too much of a rush. At first I thought it was just us. But as I observed they were doing it to everyone. Will I come back?

Service was prompt and friendly (we were seated within five minutes of our reservation). Atmosphere is sleek but not intimidating.\n\nTwo of us split:\nThe Crudo Sampler - like nigiri without the rice. Each piece had it's own flavor and light sauce to accent the fish. I liked them all except the scallop (nothing wrong with it, just didn't love the taste).\n\nUni Avocado Toast - tasty but small.\n\nLobster Heirloom Tomato Salad - delicious! The burrata cheese and lobster was a surprisingly great combination. Good size portion.\n\nBaked Flounder - perfectly cooked in a savory broth with yellow beans and potatoes. So yummy.\n\nOur waiter accidentally tipped over a glass of water at the start of our meal.

I ran to the bathroom while he was waiting for our waitress to bring him back the bill. \n\nI come out of the bathroom and the waitress is standing there waiting for me telling me my friend only tipped her $5 on a very expensive bill. It was so awkward so I asked my friend and he showed me the bill and he had tipped her 15%. I am not sure if she was trying to get a larger tip from me or what.

Maybe their consistency was supposed to be a bit dull and slimy, but they weren't very appetizing.\n\nWe also ordered the $6 seafood chowder. That was quite tasty but my friend thought it was a bit salty. It came with bread that was good for dipping and soaking up the chowder's flavor.\n\nThe Manila Clams for $6 were the best. We all agreed it was the best happy hour item. The broth was savory & not too watery. There were about 6 to a bowl, so the average cost was almost as much ad the oysters.\n\nTonight's red wine, Corvina by Scaia from Italy was exceptionally good. It was not dry at all.

She was completely absent for about 20 min looking after other tables in her TINY area (like she couldn't see us?!)- and when she finally stopped by because we flagged her down, she was short with us, rude in her tone, impatient with our questions, and displayed less warmth than a typical MUNI driver.

But great happy hour pricing - make sure to come in before 6:30pm to get it. I wish I'd known; I would've made an earlier reservation to make sure I got the happy hour deals.\n\nGet the crudo sampler - you're at Bar Crudo, you should try their specialty. You get 4 pieces of delicious raw seafood. My favorite was the butterfish and char (which we mistook for salmon at first). The uni avocado toast was also another favorite, even though I dislike uni on its own. Just a warning that they're really small slices of toast, about two thirds the size of a woman's palm. Good for sharing when you're ordering a bunch of plates, like we did.\n\nOther food we ordered: the manila clams, which came in a tasty broth. Seafood chowder that was actually full of seafood! Get your own small bowl - there's a lot of meat, but not enough to share for two.\n\nAs for the service, it was slow in terms of the bar and food. I made reservations but we got to the restaurant about 25 minutes early. They had us stand by some cute little tables that protruded out from the wall, which were just big enough to hold a few drinks and an appetizer. We perused some menus and flagged the waitress to order, who said she would be right back, but she never did make it back to us. After ten minutes at the wall, we were seated early, which was great. We got water promptly. Unfortunately, we were unable to order for another 15 minutes - probably why they still let us order off the happy hour menu despite it being past the time. We waited another 15 minutes before we even got our glasses of wine. Another 15 before we got our first plate of food. This was just for two of us. At least the supporting wait staff were good in providing water refills and clearing plates promptly.\n\nAll in all, Bar Crudo had really fresh, tasty seafood. A light meal for sure, sure to please foodies who like to sample. Make sure to snack beforehand or go out for a heavier dessert later (they don't do dessert at Bar Crudo) to help \"set\" it all in place. I'd go back again, but for happy hour!

However, after spending nearly $60 a person last night, we left hungry and pissed off. \n\nWhen it comes to food, I prefer quality over quantity and have no problem paying the price for it. I knew going in the portions would be minuscule but what I didn't expect was for the quality to be sub par. The ridiculously pretentious service was the straw that broke the camel's back and had me blowing steam out of my ears like Yosemite Sam as left. More on that later.\n\nF O O D\n*$1 HH OYSTERS - 1 STAR\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=or19voNlfSzL6ELQU_Dosw\nThe Pickering Passage oysters were horribly shriveled up. It was like unzipping a pair of pants only to be disappointed with \"THAT'S IT?\" and having to go on a hunt for tweezers.\n\n*SEAFOOD CHOWDER w/ Fish, Mussels, Squid, Shrimp, Potatoes & Bacon (HH - $5) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=sQ3SFQES3nhEYencRoshmQ\nThe chowder was sinfully good with a nice fiery kick and smokiness at the end. I appreciated that there was spoonfuls of mussel, calamari, and shrimp; not just potatoes. \n\n*CRUDO SAMPLER FOR 2 ($25) - 2.5 STARS\n**Artic Char w/ Wasabi Tobiko & Horseradish Creme Fraiche\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=roCTfRSB3iCv_tAeTxrr1w\n**Butterfish w/ Gala Apple & Sumac Vinaigrette \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=EiMjUndYncloYwRldYZSEA\n**Hamachi w/ Shishito Aioli \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=3orZbBvhL3689qR9sn_q0w \n**Scallop w/ Blood Orange, Fennel & Tarragon\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=xmROI5g5XnAYKFnQLCgeFQ\n\nBeing a sashimi feen, the crudo platter left little to be desired. The quality was similar to that of a mediocre non-Japanese owned sushi restaurant. The accompanying ingredients overshadowed and masked the delicateness of the sashimi. The artic char was the best of the quad. Similar to sake (salmon) sashimi, it was silky smooth and the butteriness was heightened from the cream fraiche. The scallop was the worst having a distinct fishiness to it that even the herbs couldn't hide.\n\n*UNI AVOCADO TOAST w/ Sudachi (2 for $10) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=gFLibwX0EE3jCHeuFz6gWw\nTogether, the uni and avocado produced a double layer of creamy decadence but it was lacking a component to brighten up the monotone flavor. \n\n*LOBSTER SALAD w/ Beets, Burrata, Pistachio & Arugula ($18) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=I-ybpOHYz6Yeoq5JRBREuw\nI normally despise beets but this dish made me a convert. The sweet tender lobster against the milky burrata and the peppery arugula was a perfect m\u00e9nage a trios of flavors. The pistachio would have added a nice textural contrast if it had been toasted. \n\n*BONE MARROW w/ Grilled Squid, Rainbow Chard & Salsa Verde Horseradish ($14) - 1 STAR\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CTE5lnXUYp4xidmh35knNg?select=MZy7Jz6klSG6j8kI75wlyA\nSeverely disappointing, the unseasoned bone marrow was overcooked and the left to sit to congeal before being served. What little bone marrow remained tasted like Crisco. \n\nS E R V I C E\nRUDE, SLOW, AND INATTENTIVE. \n\nFrom the start, the snide hostess had an obvious attitude problem. Our waiter was no better. The food took unexpectedly long to come out. After over 30 minutes of not receiving the two orders of bone marrow, we wanted to cancel it and leave as were left sitting there with a pile of empty plates on our table. When we told our waiter we wanted to cancel our order but he said it was being plated (we didn't receive the bone marrow until 10 minutes after). We told him we've been waiting for a while and he said in a curt tone, \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'll just take one order off the bill.\" A simple, \"I'm sorry...\" would have sufficed but his condescending remark left us blatantly offended. The whole time, the hostess was staring down at our table and continued to do so until we left. Go twirl your hair at the corner sweetheart and try putting more Vaseline on your teeth next time because I can see your eye rolls behind your fake pageant smile.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nBar Crudo has a very contemporary and industrial vibe with the sleek furnishings, urban mermaid murals, upper loft seating, and open kitchen (counter seating available). \n\nP A R K I N G\nDifficult street parking. \n\nAdios Bar CRUDE.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

How they infuse the smokey goodness of bacon in every single bite is beyond me, but they have and it's incredible!\n\nTruly an excellent dining experience and I am really glad we stepped outside the comfort zone long enough to find this awesome place. Service was excellent!! Our waitress was well versed on the oysters and when I told her I wasn't ready to eat head on shrimp, she immediately gave me the thumbs up when I chose the Trout. Overall the experience was top notch and I look forward to our second visit, someday very soon.", "author": "Hector G."}

The oysters are always so fresh.  Make sure you get there earlier enough, so they don't run out of uni toast before you get yours.  The service is always great, and they always have the perfect wine pairing for your meal.

The Uni Avacado toast is a great intro to urchin, and the crudo sampler platter is some really elevated sashimi (think creme fraiche and wasabi infused tobiko). \n\nThe shishito peppers are just pretty good, and I don't know that the fish taco's are better than you'd find at a wide array of other popular SF locales, but this is a happy hour not to be missed.", "author": "Sean F."}

The restaurant was already pretty crowded by 5:15. The ambiance was good, the place was lively, had tall ceilings that made it feel more open, and contemporary fixtures and art. The hostess was able to seat us in the front of the restaurant after waiting in the bar area for about 5 minutes, but she informed us that we would have to finish by 6:30 to accommodate a party that already had a reservation for our table.\n\nWe ordered the happy hour specials of a dozen oysters and seafood chowder plus the crudo sampler for two. The seafood chowder was the best of the three. It had plenty of flavor and big chunks of fish. Our server brought us sourdough bread to dip in the soup and it was delicious!\n\nHowever, the other two dishes were disappointing and didn't meet our expectations. \n1. The Pickering Passage oysters from Washington were so small! Half of them were literally the size of my thumb. When we asked about the small size of the oysters, our waitress confirmed that that is their normal size. She said that they periodically switch up the varieties of oysters available for happy hour and these ones just happened to be like this. The oysters themselves were gritty and not cleaned at all.\n\n2. The crudo sampler had arctic char, ono, yellowtail, and ahi tuna. For $28, I feel that it was too pricey for the amount that we were given. The arctic char was overwhelmed by the wasabi tobiko. The ono lacked some acidity that would have balanced it out. The yellowtail was the best of the four. The ahi tuna was fine, but putting it with soy sauce, green onion, sesame, and cilantro made it taste almost like ahi poke and wasn't that creative.\n\nOverall, this happy hour/dinner was too expensive for the quality and service that we received. We have eaten much better quality oysters for not much more than the happy hour special. We will not be coming here again.", "author": "Stacie W."}

They come with cocktail sauce, and a cucumber / vinegar that is so light and fresh - I could drink it!\n\nTheir seafood chowder is the best I've had - SO flavorful, creamy, and full of shrimp, scallops, calamari...You can get a cup or a bowl - it's so rich that a cup is usually enough, especially if you order it with something else on the menu. \n\nLOBSTER BEET SALAD - the highlight of the menu in my opinion. It has huge chunks of tender lobster, arugula, golden beets, Burrata, and a light olive oil based dressing. It's pricey for a salad ($21), but SO worth it! Note, some of the ingredients change by the season.\n\nChar (i forget the exact name of the whole dish) - OMG! Perfectly cooked with a roasted red pepper sauce, thinly sliced squash, and sunchokes. I might be forgetting an ingredient, I think there was a green mixed in there too.

The restaurant is pretty small, but they do have a bar area and we opted to sit there even though tables were available (the restaurant was full by the time we left at 8:45pm). We ordered:\n\n-Seafood Chowder (Fish, Mussels, Shrimp, Squid, Potatoes, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Large Bowl $14): Pretty good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the broth since it was too tangy for my taste, although I started liking it more as I ate it. However, they do not skip on the seafood, which was awesome! There were huge pieces of salmon and other seafood goodness in the chowder.\n-Uni Avocado Toast (Sudachi, Frisee Salad $10): A briny and delicious bite. I loved the pairing of uni/avocado, but was sad there were only two small pieces per order.\n-BBQ Hamachi Collar (Purple Potato Salad, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche, Arugula, Rosemary Sprig $15): This was ok, but I've definitely had better at Japanese restaurants. Also, the bbq sauce overpowered the taste of the hamachi, and I had to spit out a couple of scales that hadn't been scraped off. I would skip this dish.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the freshness and quality of the seafood, but I just didnt order anything that really wowed me aside from the uni avocado toast. I wish I had tried their crudo (a derrrrrr moment for me since that is basically the name of the restaurant!) because my friends who did said it was amazing. In any case, definitely order the crudo and other raw stuff if you come here and skip the cooked items! Also make sure you ask for the BREAD & BUTTER- it was delicious! I may try to come back for happy hour (until 6:30pm M-Th I believe) since they have discounted appetizers, but avoid having to drive as parking in this area is unbelievably crappy!

After warming up with a very innocent (Yelp, you know I wouldn't lie to you!) game of battleship and dessert at Candybar, we went to Bar Crudo for dinner.  \n\nOur waitress gifted us with lovely service; when I explained I have a preference for creamy oysters over briny ones, she chose the Kumamoto,  Effingham and Chelsea Gem varieties for us.  I have yet to find a place that serves oysters as good as the ones I had in New Orleans, but Bar Crudo definitely has some of the better oysters in the SF Bay Area.  \n\nFor our raw entrees, we shared the Yellowtail Jack and Ono dishes.  The Ono was divine!  I've never had ono (aka cousin of mackerel) in any form before, so this was a great introduction. One might argue that the jalapeno relish or cilantro masked the true taste of the fish, but who cares?  The unique combinations of flavors in the dishes here is what makes it stand out from other seafood bars.  This also holds true for Head-On (yes, your food will be staring at you if you order this) Deviled Prawns with the chiles, shishito prawns, spicy brodo and the San Sebastian tuna confit.  In fact, everything else on the plate saved the tuna confit dish, as the tuna was strangely bland for confit.  \n\nSo how did the evening with Nice Boy end?  Like a gentleman, he walked me to my place an entire block away and leaned in for a first kiss on what was not a first date.  In that split second, I remembered what I just ate, ducked and cursed the raw fish and accompanying spices for taking away my confidence to go for it, despite my minty gum-chewing.

Not during happy hour, which made it somewhat pricey, but we ate A LOT :).  We paid 220$ for everything that's below here :).\n\nWe started of with some oysters.  It seems like Americans like big oysters, I prefer them smaller, but we had a nice combination and they were delicious!  I do not get how people can put BBQ-sauce on something that delicious, but if you like it, then it's there.  We also got a  lemony-garlic-sauce with it, which was great!  Already looking forward to that happy hour menu :).\nThe crudo platter was an awesome experience for the senses.  A lot of new flavors or combinations.\nThen I was in doubt whether to choose the roasted crab or more oysters.  I only had californian crab once before on fisherman's wharf and a few hours later everything came out, so I was a bit reluctant to have the crab, but the waitress convinced me (saying they should tell people not to have dungeness crab at fisherman's wharf).  It was DELICIOUS! The sauce it came with was awesome, I like the whole peeling experience and the fishmeat was perfectly tender!\nMy husband had the cold lobster, which was also tasteful, but he was jealous of my crab :).\nAnd then we finished off with the cheese platter.  It should have said on the menu that one cheese was blue, as I don't like that.  But the cheeses were very strong, very tasteful.  I'm not a fan of sourdough bread, but it was pretty ok.  And I love having the little extra's: almonds, honey, apple slices, and figue marmalade.  It was great!\nWe shared a bottle of great cremant.\nThe best thing: I wanted to have local and sustainable seafood, which is why we came here in the first place, but then we also had this very rare beer from my tiny Belgian hometown (wevelgem).  A perfect, perfect birthday dinner! I already convinced my parents to come here when they're in the US.", "author": "Joke D."}

This is raw seafood simply as good as it gets... carefully sourced, incredibly fresh and served with perfectly balanced and imaginative accompaniments.\n\nWe were lucky that the happy hour oyster tonight was the Pickering Passage... small but incredibly sweet. Also tried the seafood chowder which was the one thing I would warn you about... it's magnificent seafood poached in cream basically, about 2000 calories and 70 grams of fat to hazard a guess. The new mom in our party loved the restorative powers but the other two were in danger of slipping into a butterfat coma.\n\nFortunately we were rescued by the crudo... butterfish and yellowtail jack on this night. The pieces are big, no nigiri size morsels here, so you really get to taste and savor. Chopped gala apples on the butterfish sounded a bit precious but actually they tasted perfect, a bit of crunch and a shot of sweetness against the tart shiso and velvety fish.\n\nI have an uni fixation so had to order the uni toast which was fine but more predictable than the other choices. Unctuous uni atop unctuous guacamole on a crisp slice of toasted baguette with some really tart micro greens to cut the unctuousness. I would have preferred a straighter shot of uni but his is a good intro if you are on the fence about raw sea gonads.\n\nBeer list was magnificent. Really interesting choices and the $3 beer on the happy hour was just as outstanding as some of the $9 glasses on the regular menu.\n\nSurroundings are great too. Interesting industrial lighting and various architectural details will keep you entertained when you are not transfixed by your fish. Overall, a great experience.", "author": "Otis M."}

The only negative is the parking, so definitely allow an extra 15 minutes for that (more on this below)\n\nI would come back to this place in a heart beat.\n\nRelatively simple idea: freshest sea food in classic and creative ways. Raw oysters (6 types), raw lobster, crab, shrimp.  Cooked fish favorites like mussels, seabass.  This place is a fish lover's delight. \n\nBest of all - huge portions.  We ordered a raw ahi tuna with 3 pieces for $14.  We expected sushi-size slices but each of the 3 pieces had enough tuna for a sushi roll.  They were significantly sized cubes of succulent fresh tuna  (like 4cm^3...nerdy enough for you, SF?)\n\nAlso loved their interpretation of clam chowder. It was more like a bisque (and huge fan of lobster bisque) but with lots of clams, mussels, salmon in it.  The BF ordered the whole sea bass (FYI its not the large chilean one...but the branzino - the european seabass that sells at whole foods for $12.99).  The preparation was good but I don't find the branzino to be nearly as juicy and succulent as the chilean seabass, so that was a little bit of a disappointment.  But rest of the dish was well done.\n\nMy only real complaint was on the uni avocado app. My love for uni is only paralleled by the love for my dog. Uni on some smeared avocado, on a large piece of toasted baguette is...just not good. Sure it's got a creamy texture, but uni really can't be used as a spread. Maybe mix it with some capellini and dungeness crab? I would die over a dish like that...\n\nAlso, maybe add a squid ink pasta dish to the menu, bar crudo? =]\n\noh yeah - about the parking.  Parking requires some advance planning. If there's a show at the independent, then you better rely on the parking lot 3 blocks away (fell and broderick).  The lot across the street from bar crudo is a sketchy lot of a pot clinic/trailer or something. Not the best spot to take your chances.  The issue with the parking lot 3 blocks away is that it's a pretty big parking lot (100-150 cars?) and there's only ONE machine to pay.  So there was a line of 4 people in front of us on a saturday night (which doesn't seem too bad except the machine has about 12 steps) and the two 60+ year old guys in the front couldn't figure out how to use the machine and managed to get their credit card stuck in there for a solid 5 minutes.  Then there's the woman with the crying baby who can't get the coupon code for bi-rite market to work in the machine.  The list of issues go on and on.  So yeah...definitely allocate 15minutes extra for parking. There's no valet and nopa is across the street, so not easy to find a spot on a date night.", "author": "Alice Z."}

I had reviewed this place on Yelp and was super excited to try this place for date night. We had driven quite a long way to spend the day in the city and decided to come here for happy hour. We came here just before 5pm (HH is 5-6:30pm) so we were the first to arrive and they let us sit down while they were still setting up the restaurant. Shortly after though, crowds came in and the restaurant was almost filled by 6pm. \n\nWe ordered a dozen oysters of the daily special (Miyagi Marin), bowl of the seafood clam chowder, manila clams, and 2 for $10 fried cod fish tacos. The oysters were super small and didn't give too much flavor, or maybe it was because the sauce at the middle wasn't up to my usual standards. But I didn't think that the oysters were extraordinary. The seafood clam chowder did not taste like a clam chowder at all. It was super cheesy and a weird orange color. Don't get me wrong, the seafood was amazing.. it was so light and easily pulled apart. But when you put chowder in the description, I am sorry but I automatically think of some potatoes, chunky white creamy sauce with some clams  and vegetables. This is nowhere near what Bar Crudo's seafood chowder tasted like. On top of that, my friend found that $5 for a taco that you can easily find for $2 anywhere in SF wasn't so great. I understand that the piece of fish was cooked perfectly and all, but the ingredients did not leave me thinking 5 stars. However, a brighter note is the selection of beers. We had ordered the Allagash which is something different from our usual and it was really good. I usually hate beer, but it was a really nice light flavor. \n\nA funny fact was that their daily special happy hour beer was Sudwerk's Pilsner beer for $3 and usually us, UC Davis students get that shitty beer on $1 pint nights on Wednesdays. Cannot believe other people serve that beer!! Haha", "author": "Anh Thu P."}

I'm not a huge uni fan, but when I had this toast, I barely tasted the fishy-ness, and more of the avocado - which may not be a good thing for uni lovers, but for me, it tasted good (plus I love avocados). The portion of the toast was really small though, it was probably the size of my palm. We also had the Crudo Sampler for 4 ($14/per person during happy hour) - and this was my favorite dish of the evening. Everything on the sampler was delicious! The scallop and artic char were my favorites! If i were to return, I'd probably get the sampler, but because of the price & portion, I probably won't be returning anytime soon.

My friend and I arrived and asked if we could be seated and order a couple of appetizers to take advantage of happy hour (5:00-6:30pm) and since our third person would be arriving later.  The hostess said that wouldn't be a problem and had us wait on the side.  She oddly walked towards the back of the restaurant as if she was looking for a table.  There was tons of seating available throughout the restaurant.  She came back a couple minutes later, pushed two small tables together, and seated us.  Even though we mentioned we would like to order a couple appetizers first, we sat there for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged.\n\nAs our meal went on, the service only deteriorated.   Our wannabe hipster waiter rarely checked on us throughout our meal and had a rather stuck up attitude when he did.  The topping to his rude attitude?  We finished all our dishes except the bone marrow that never came and I flagged him down to ask him to cancel the dish because it's been 30+ minutes.  He said the bone marrow was being plated but he could \"take one of the bone marrows off our bill if it made us feel any better\" (we ordered two orders).  I don't need your attitude and your failure to apologize pissed me off even more.  We waited another 10 minutes before the bone marrow came out.  If it was being plated, WHY was it not out almost immediately?!  \n\nAfter we finished the dish, we asked for the bill which was given to us almost immediately.  The hostess tried to give us the stare down while eyeing how much I was leaving for tip.  YES I SKIMPED ON THE TIP BECAUSE TIPPING IS EARNED AND SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED!  Upon leaving, no one acknowledged us by thanking us for coming in or even a goodbye.\n\nI do hope management reads this because they obviously chosen to hire a sour bunch.  There was nothing warm or sweet about our waiter or the hostess.  Employees who seem like they hate their job shouldn't be in the customer service industry since they'll only steer away customers.\n\nFOOD:\n*Raw Scallops (4 pieces, $13) - Good as the scallops were tender but the combination of blood orange, fennel and tarragon overshadowed the taste of the scallops.\n*Dungeness Crab (1/2  crab, $14) - These were not half of the crabs I saw on display behind the bar!  My half of crab was tiny and lacked any kind of sweet taste.\n*Lobster Beet Salad ($18) - Good and probably the best thing I had all night.  Generous portions of lobster meat were mixed with largely cut pieces of beets and tarragon that had a slight bitterness to it.\n*Littleneck Clams ($1.50 each) - Would've been better if there wasn't that tad of a fishy taste to them.\n*Bone Marrow (2 pieces, $14) - A let down.  I should've known better than to order bone marrow from a place known for seafood.  The marrow lacked seasoning as well as the usual savory taste I expect.\n*Manila Clams ($5 happy hour price) - Okay. The clams were small but tender in a paprika, cilantro and wine broth which had a nice kick.\n*Herb & Jalapeno Mussels ($1 each during happy hour) - Good.  This was my first time having raw mussels and it tastes similar to cooked mussels.\n\nPARKING:\nMostly metered street parking which is relatively easy to find before 6pm but expect to circle around after 6pm\n\nBar Crudo was on my bookmark last for a year and a half.

It was refreshing and melty, as well.\n\nButterfish - was a no go for me. was meatier than I liked. It is one of those hearty fishes, I guess. Not too much \"melty\" the way I like it.\n\nSeafood Chowder tasted good to me. loved the spice and the flavor. My friend thought it was too heavy and had followed this up by, \"usually I can do heavy soups but this one...\"\n\nWe tried another fish, but I don't remember what type it was. It had ginger and blackberry and nectarine to it: it was a bit too sweet for my taste. (the sauce, not the fish.) Wouldn't get that again (along with the butterfish)\n\nLastly, the oysters we had were fresh, yummy; once in awhile did have small chunk of shell. Can't remember what kinds we got-- we just agreed to whatever the reccs were from out waitress.\n\nThis place was def. cooler than school.\n\nLove the concept.

We passed by before it opened and noticed how small the bar was so we made reservations on open table on the iphone right away for later that evening. I would highly recommend making reservations in advance because it was really crowded and bustling during happy hour! The hostess was able to accommodate our party of 10 even though the reservation was only for 6 people. We were seated in a nice big table upstairs (the only big table in the restaurant) with a welcome view of the kitchen below.\n\nThe happy hour was amazing! Beers and glasses of wine were only $2-3 each and raw oysters (from Washington) were $1 each! We ordered 80 raw oysters for the table and there were plenty for the entire group to enjoy! I loved how the oysters came out 40 at a time on a beautiful large shallow platter of ice lined with raw seaweed for decoration (see picture). The oysters also came with cocktail sauce and a sweet 'n' sour vinegar shallot mignonette which we asked for more of as well as some tapatio to spice things up. We also ordered some clams and they were good but not memorable. For all that we ordered, we were fully satisfied and the bill came down to less than $10 a person! I highly recommend making reservations and coming for happy hour! I look forward to returning to enjoy more of their fantastic happy hour and trying their other dishes!", "author": "Rita N."}

However, once they left it was as if magic happened, and all was well in the world. \n\nSecond complaint is that in my oyster there were pieces of shell mixed in. I know, a small thing, but I would prefer not to break my teeth  or choke slurping an oyster, thank you. \n\nThird complaint is that the pea shoots on the scallops were...well, made of salt? Just completely oversalted to the point of inedible. Blech. It may have been deliberate, but not to my liking or taste. \n\nNow for the positive: \nThe food was mostly  (other than the listed above) fantastic. \n\nOnce past the shell pieces in the oysters, they were fresh and tasty. \n\nWe had the crudo sampler for 2, which featured four crudos, each with their own unique flavor. The butterfish was by far my favorite, followed by the artic char (win). \n\nThe tuna confit was a little bit of a letdown, as the flavors didn't meld quite as well as I was expecting.Yes, you got various flavors in every  bite, but it was...ok? Maybe my expectations were too high. \n\n The chowder was exceptional...I liked the hint of spice to it. fit was very flavorful, and a bit decadent with all that cream.

She went a long way into making this night what it was.  She knows every item on the menu, and was beyond helpful in suggesting things that we never would have ordered, and yet were unreal.  She sized both my girlfriend and myself up and brought us a wine and beer (respectively) that blew us both away, and her suggestions for menu items were spot on not just for overall quality, but for what we liked and didn't like.\n\nOysters - We had three each, the Kusshis, the Beausoleils, and a third I am forgetting.  Delicious and fresh.\nCrudo Sampler for 2 - This is a must order, in my opinion.  You got two portions each of the Arctic Char, Ono, Butterfish, and Scallop.  The first three blew me away, and the Scallop I thought was just \"good\" as opposed to unreal (a good problem to have, and it was my girlfriend's favorite anyway).\nLobster Beet Salad - I despise beets, and this was still one of the best salads I've ever eaten.  The lobster, vinaigrette, arugula, burrata, pistachio mixture was outrageous.\nSalmon - Cooked perfectly.  This thing literally melted in your mouth.\n\nLast but not least, we were joking before coming here that we'd have to eat something else after, since we were starving and seafood rarely fills us up.  We left totally satisfied, which is hard to do given the type of food served here.\n\nOverall, the perfect food, NoPa location, fantastic ambiance (casual yet elegant), and Dani's advice all pulled together for a very special night.

Great music, great location and very friendly staff. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had a couple beers with the oysters, Uni Avocado Toast, Chowder and the Red Idaho Trout. The beers are amazing. I usually drink beers as opposed to wine and the variety of beers made for a nice surprise when I came across the menu. I decided to go with a couple beers on tap, the Belgium ale and the beer from San Francisco (can't remember the name). Both went very well with my meal. \n\nThe oysters were good! Considering its a seafood restaurant and not really an \"Oyster Bar\" I felt the oysters were good, but not great. The Uni Avocado Toast was a bit of a disappointment to me. I felt the avocado and the uni clashed. I am a bit of an uni enthusiast so I guess I may be biased since I enjoy the purity of the taste of uni. \n\nThe chowder though was AMAZING. This may be the best chowder in San Francisco. I could come back just to eat the Chowder and drink the beers. The bacon brought out a really smoky flavor to the chowder and the seafood made a great base for the soup. And all the seafood was perfect for the chowder. Hands down BEST chowder I've had thus far in SF. \n\nThe Idaho Red Trout was also very good. The roasted vegetables went perfectly with the fish.

The oysters were delicious and very fresh. I was slightly disappointed that a couple of my oysters had small hunks of shell and sand in it, but they were overlooked because of how fresh they were. The muscles were interesting. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but the spices they used overpowered the muscles a bit. I would say skip the muscles and just get more oysters. The seafood chowder was delicious. The fish inside was super fresh and tender as was the rest of the seafood. It had a super super strong cheddar flavor, but paired very well with bread. We also got the crudo sampler for 2. Everything on this plate was paired well, although a lot of the toppings and sauces were a bit to overwhelming. We learned that the best way to eat it was to scrape everything off the fish, and then just add a little bit of sauce back on. My personal favorite was the atlantic char. The butterfish was delicious too though. I would definitely go back here during happy hour for the oysters! \n\nPros: \n- very reasonably priced happy hour menu \n- seafood was very fresh \n- not too busy for dinner (no need for reservation)\n\nCons: \n- spices and toppings tended to be too strong/too much", "author": "Diana C."}

Bar Crudo is our favorite early dinner spot, not just because of their daily happy hour (weekends too!) but mostly because the food is oh-so-delicious! While I'm still making my rounds, this ranks among my favorite seafood in the city. With a group of four good eaters and seafood lovers, we ordered 2 dozen mussels, 2 dozen oysters, 2 orders of the arctic char tacos (1 each), and a bowl of the seafood chowder for each. Do NOT skip the chowder. It's the best way to end such a satisfying meal! \n\nA quick word of advice: if you plan on going for happy hour, get there early (it starts right at 5) with your entire group. They won't seat you until you're all present and the waiting area is pretty cramped. Totally worth the wait, though!", "author": "Julie B."}

Now they've expanded to a slightly larger space in NOPA that's nearly identical except it's commemorative stamp sized.\n\nIt was disorganized in a charming, quirky way. By 5:30PM on a Friday the place was packed with a 45 minute wait for happy hour. I explained to the stern hostess, ready for a confrontation, that I'd been trying to call them for two days to say we'd be a little late. She shrugged kindly, admitted they aren't the best about answering phones, and promptly marched to one of the best seats in the house.\n\nOrdering anything but the crudo for two at Bar Curdo is like going to Tony's PIzza and having the meatballs, or the Crab Shack and having the chicken. But that's just what we did, to mixed results. The happy hour oysters weren't the best. No real problems, just not great oysters. Jalapeno mussels were pretty good but even at $1 each pretty expensive. Shisito peppers were so good we ordered a second. And like before, the chowder is basically liquid crack, and about as healthy, butter and cream pan fried to order with a bunch of fish hunks. Happy hour wine was a good deal, but the red was too cold, way under cellar temperature.\n\nServers were hustling and knowledgeable. They're not pretentious here, your waiter will fill your water or clear your plate, the hostess or food runner can take a wine order.\n\nThe complete standout is the crudo, which is not a happy hour dish but is basically why you should come here.  It's delicious, inventive, artistic, subtle, intricate, thoughtful, enlightening, and basically one of those things you will remember for a long time. Four different preparations on a long plate.", "author": "Gil S."}

We took a corner table upstairs that afforded me a bird's eye view of the kitchen (something I discovered only when my dining companion asked me to momentarily cast my eyes away). We began our meal with four sweetly delicate Kumamoto oysters. They arrived on a bed of tendrils from the sea (the sort of ocean matter you see wash up on the beach - a nice, authentic touch in my view) accompanied by a mignonette comprised of shallots and vinegar as well as a spicy cocktail sauce. The flavors played beautifully off one another.\n\nFollowing the oysters we dove into the crudo plate for two. The spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha and green onions and the arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill were standouts. I would order both on a return visit.\n\nI found that the Paulaner Hefeweizen went very well with everything I ate. My dining companion enjoyed two glasses of the Crauford Sauvignon Blanc. The seafood chowder with clams, mussels, cod, squid, potatoes and applewood smoked bacon is exceptional and should not be missed. I enjoyed the Seared Dayboat Scallops but could've done without the mussels on top - they were the only off-putting bit about the meal.\n\nThere was no dessert on offer (unless you count cheese as dessert - I don't)\n\nIf you are not a seafood lover (or willing to become one) Bar Crudo will be a major disappointment for you. The menu has no chicken, no steak, no grilled vegetable plate, no pasta. Unlike many restaurants that try to be all things to all people - Bar Crudo has a clear focus and that focus is seafood, mostly raw. Plain and simple. End of story. It is my appreciation for this clear focus that even allows me to forgive the fact that they don't have dessert.\n\nMy first dining experience at Bar Crudo was truly outstanding.\n\nUPDATE September 06, 2006:\nMy one and only point of disquietude with Bar Crudo - that they don't serve dessert - has been redressed! At the end of an impeccable meal there last night they brought us a plate of chocolate truffles in wonderful flavors like coconut and champagne and kahlua.

Even the bathroom came with an extra tiny sink (it was so cute I wanted to steal it!).\n\nAlmost everything here was severely overpriced, but I maintain that the experience was worth it. \n\nI came here a couple of years ago with a gaggle of friends for an SF weekend getaway (despite the fact that we lived right in the Bay Area not forty minutes away from the city of rainbow awesomeness). Using business traveler's points, we got to stay at the InterContinental in a luxurious suite. Woot! And since we had foodies in the group, we decided that Bar Crudo would be a great place for a nice dinner.\n\nAfter strolling around Chinatown for a bit, we came here and had to wait outside in the icy wind for our table. Damn, and we even had reservations! 20 minutes passed and finally we were seated on the second floor at a table next to the window.\n\nThe interior was warm and cozy, and the soft lighting really added to the atmosphere. Still, I had to stumble around a bunch of seated patrons just to get up those small stairs and into my seat. What a pain.\n\nUpon being seated, our server did the standard duty of pouring us water. But this wasn't just any ordinary water. This wasn't just ice water or lemon water; it was cucumber water! I had never before thought that putting a slice of cucumber into a pitcher of water would impart such a refreshing taste, but it was possibly the best water I've ever had. How often do you hear someone say that?\n\nAnyway, onto the food:\n\n- Crudo Sampler: the biggest ripoff ever. Yeah, the seafood was fresh, but for $23 I expected a little more than 8 pieces. Quite frankly, there's a point where the freshness isn't worth the extra money (my personal take on the law of diminishing returns).\n\n- Seafood Chowder: HOLY FUCKING SHIT GET THIS! In fact, get two or three whole bowls for yourself! It's been maybe 3 years since I've been here and I still daydream about this stuff. Rich, creamy, hearty, laced with delicious chunks of applewood smoked bacon. This was totally worth the money because 1. it actually filled me, and 2. it was orgasmic. Bar Crudo's seafood chowder has got to be the best chowder I've had in my life thus far.\n\nSure, you can easily spend $50+ here on tiny bites of their seafood, but why not save that money and spend it elsewhere at some made-to-order AYCE sushi joint (which only costs about half that)? Instead, spend $14 here on a bowl of seafood chowder, drink your free cucumber water, and you may just leave this place somewhat full!", "author": "Candice K."}

Another sad case of a high priced restaurant in SF that doesn't live up to its reputation.  Overpriced with average quality food and low quality service.  (Never mind the staff's dress code).\n\nFrom the very beginning, when we entered the restaurant without a reservation, we were greeted with a dismissive attitude;  we were told we'd have to wait at least a half hour for a table, on a Sunday no less.  We conceded. After the wait, we were seated in the most remote seating area of the restaurant (upstairs near the dishes).\n\nMy friend ordered a dish but requested it without fish, which they accommodated, and the waitress proceeded to recommend a vegetarian plate (that seemed like a nice gesture).\n\nBut our positive impressions were unwarranted. Not only did the server bring over the wrong dish (e.g. still with fish), the vegetarian plate suggested by the waitress never arrived, and only upon my prompting (by this time, I was practically done with my meal), did she admit never ordering it.  Despite  the clear error on her part, there was no gesture to comp us for the glasses of wine or anything else.  (which is a typical gesture at high-quality, upscale restaurants).\n\nIt's one thing when you go to McDonald's and expect below average service, it's quite another when you pay $24 for half a lobster (more like 1/4 lobster)  and get sub par service.

He left us the beer and wine list, in case we wanted to try something else for our second round.  My date asked if we could keep a food menu as well, in case we needed to order more food.  The gentleman smiled and said, \"Oh, no you won't,\" in a sing-songy voice as he walked away.  I suppose if we had been other people, we may have been offended, but I thought it was funny.\n\nThe Butterfish and Ahi Tuna were our favorite of the five Crudo dishes, but the others were just as fresh and flavorful.  Each fish was paired with a sauce and some kind of ingredient, specific to complementing the characteristics of the fish.  The portions are a really good size, for the price.  We had planned to get a Crudo for 2 (8 pieces, 2 of each of four fish) and an order of Ahi (4 pieces).  The gentleman who took our order suggested that we get two pieces of each fish, so that we could try each of them, so he did an Open food charge for $6 for the 2 pieces of Tuna & they were all plated together nicely.  \n\nNext came the Octopus salad, with grilled octopus.  It was lightly charred, slightly smokey, served hot, and melted in your mouth!  Delicious!\n\nAs our server, a friendly dark haired lady, cleared the salad, my date ordered one of each of the five oysters.  She was able to add these to our order in time to get them on the same serving dish as the Dungeness crab we'd ordered.  Prior to the delivery of the shellfish, she brought our sauces: drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and mignonette.  He really enjoyed the oysters (the Kumamoto and Kusshi best of the five - I don't do oysters).  The crab was firm, fresh, yum.  I've never had chilled Dungeness crab before.  It did not disappoint at all.  \n\nAs we finished the crab, we looked at each other and knew that we didn't need the two cups of Seafood Chowder we'd ordered, although it looked amazing on the table next to us.  When our server checked on us, we asked (for the first time ever in our lives) if we could cancel the chowders, or if she'd already ordered them.  She said that she hadn't yet fired them - she was waiting to finish clearing our crab.  She was very gracious about cancelling them.  I'm just hoping that she really hadn't fired them yet!  \n\nWe made up for it by ordering another round of drinks and a cheese plate for dessert.  The dressings served with the cheese (a fresh quartered fig, marmalade, and honey) were good, but we weren't crazy about the cheeses themselves.  The bleu didn't have much taste and the camembert was more bitter than I like (I'm not sure that I've ever actually had camembert before).  As this was the only item we weren't crazy about, I'm still going to give this place 5 stars.\n\nService was excellent and efficient and the food was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced.  Thank you!", "author": "Betsy K."}

They prepare, minimally sauces, but crudo is a little different, they make what is in my estimation perhaps the best fish tacos in the universe. Yes I know, like a hummus and falafel joint in Tel Aviv, everyone has their favorite fish taco hole in the wall along Highway 1 from Escondido to Astoria. They are a dime a dozen, but this place I swear, does it more right than the rest!\n\nI can go on and tell you how great the tacos are but it won't do them justice, just man up, get up off the couch, but down the Wii and the rock band and get to crudo for some happy hour goodness. The service is fantastic and the prices during happy hour for those gems from the bottom of the sea floor are just right.

The also have a notable beer list, great work bar crudo, and nice but selectively appointed wine list.\n\nWe started off with the Chowder and Mussels. Loved them both, both truly unique, the chowder had a nice acid component to it which perfectly complemented the spicy and light yet creamy broth. The mussels were delicious as well, very fresh and plump not overcooked, probably some of the best I have enjoyed on the west coast.\n\nFrom there we moved on to the ahi. On my the ahi was out of this world fresh. 4 large cubes lightly dressed in a soy like sauce. Really I could have had 4 orders and still wanted more. \n\nThe reason its not 5 stars is due to the fact I was feeling an espresso at that point and ordered one but they dont have espresso. Its the one category they fell short in. \n\nNaturally I did what anyone would do when a place is stimulant free. We went straight for the Louisinana Head On Shrimp. Dyanmite! Literally they were so insanely spicy, in a great way that I gravitated towards the peppers, eating almost every last bit of spicy broth with my spoon. Im glad we had this dish I will certainly get it again and again and it will always be my closer as I couldnt imagine eating it and then say a crudo. \n\nBar Crudo killed it, we will be back for sure.

The beausoleil and kumamoto oysters came with a lemon wedge, standard mignonette, and cocktail sauce.  The sauces were nothing special but the oysters were delicious and didn't need much!  We also ordered the crudo for two, substituting the fluke for the ahi tuna at our waiter's recommendation.  My favorite was the arctic char with wasabi roe - fantastic! Our final cold item was half a Maine lobster, which came with dipping butter.  It's hard to mess up lobster and this lobster was just as expected - it was solid without blowing me away.  \n\nFor our warm items we ordered the seafood chowder (that came so highly Yelp recommended) and the swordfish.  I found the chowder to be bisque-flavored, and incredibly strongly bisque-flavored at that.  I couldn't taste the individual seafood and potato pieces in the chowder, it was just a bowl of strong salty  flavor.  The swordfish, on the other had, was flaky and cooked to perfection.  \n\nThe service was fine, my main complaint is our wait time.

So, I made reservations to come on his birthday. When we got there, they didn't have our reservation. However, the host was very accomodating and managed to seat us anyway. We got there about 6pm so Happy Hour was still in effect until 6:30pm. We ordered a dozen of raw oysters ($1 each), seafood chowder ($6) and manila clams ($6). The oysters were good but not great but we were happy that it was only $1 each. The seafood chowder had a lot of seafood in one little bowl but I thought it was just mediocre b/c they used too much heavy cream and was a bit too sour. The manila clams were delicious and probably the best item on the menu. The broth was very tasty and there was a good amount of clams.  When we were done with our HH meals, we ordered from the dinner menu - had the crudo sampler for two ($28), half a dozen of raw little neck clams ($2.50 each) and the lobster salad ($18)...all disappointments!!! The presentation of the food was beautiful but deceiving!!! It definitely looked better than it tasted. The crudo sampler had the arctic char (salmon), scallop, butterfish and ono. The seafood were NOT fresh at all!!! Fresh seafood does not taste fishy! Their \"raw\" seafood was served room temperature (not cold and refreshing) and tasted very fishy, like old fish that's been sitting around too long.  The raw little neck clams were a disappointment. We are such huge fans of them at Mission Rock Resort but these were not fresh, had dirt in them and again, not cold...served room temperature...yuk! The lobster salad was a joke for $18...few pieces of lobster that tasted so bland and was not even fresh and sweet. How can you mess up so bad on lobster? It was mixed with some bland beets, gooey cheese that looked like fresh mozarella and was topped with some greens and pistachio nuts. The pistachio nuts were the best in the salad. I'm a huge salad fan and this was a total failure! \n\nThis restaurant is very confused with their food. I noticed that everyone who gave great ratings only came for the happy hour and was happy with their HH food. If I came for their HH food, I think I would've given them a better rating too. But the people who ate their dinner were disappointed like me. I wouldn't mind paying top dollar for good tasting high quality food. At Bar Crudo, the seafood is not fresh, the food is not tasty and the price is too high for such low quality small portions. I do have to say they have great customer service. We were well attended and our host and server were both were friendly and attentive. Their complimentary bread and cucumber water was good. \n\nI forgot to mention the noise level at this place in CRAZY noisy. It's not even a big place but everyone was talking so loud. I had to shout to place my order and it was hard to have a decent conversation with my date. Not a great place for a first date or with kids. What a disappointment!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "The problem with living in San Francisco for a long time is that inevitably, you will be disappointed. You equate one restaurant with one pure, superb dish and continue to return for years. Eventually, you go to recreate the epiphany of that first taste and find that the dish is the same, but the place is not. That dish is the seafood chowder and that place is Bar Crudo.\n\nMy husband and I sat at the bar one weeknight around 9pm. He ordered some oysters, a bowl of chowder, and a beer, and I, truth be told, having had half a carne asada burrito around 5pm, wasn't that hungry. So I ordered a glass of wine, a small plate of crudo, and 2 (yup) Gulf prawns. The waitress was somewhat dubious of my order, asking, \"have you been here before?\" I answered yes, but should have added that we are in fact some of your original customers from the Bush Street glory days. The kind that used to be on your email list for your beer tasting dinner menu, i.e. LOYAL.\n\nShe put the order in, then the chef at the raw bar -- where we were sitting -- got the ticket and started to make a stink, something to the effect of \"who eff orders 2 prawns??\" Um, I do -- the customer sitting RIGHT in front of you. If I wanted judgment with my dinner, I would save myself some money, go back home and eat with my parents.\n\nI would call the incident a fluke except for the fact that during our previous visit, we had gone to dinner to celebrate and ordered some crudo, the chowder, and a small seafood platter. I had intended to order the cheese plate for dessert, but the waitress had already closed the ticket. I'm either not eating enough, or eating too much depending on their mood.\n\nThe chowder was delicious as usual, but the front of the house attitude and poor service really spoiled what used to be a special spot for us. Seriously, if you want to criticize your customer's ordering habits, talk about it on your break, or don't offer an \u00e0 la carte menu.\n\nI didn't want to write this review, but my hope is that the owners (and other SF restaurateurs) will realize there is a contingent of diners in the city who are getting consistently disappointed by the attitude and lack of service in San Francisco. Please, please: make us want to go out again and give us a dining scene we can truly be proud of.", "author": "Janice A."}

If I come back, I would definitely order ONLY the arctic char instead of everything else that came in the sampler! Everything else was prepared well, very very fresh selection of fish!\n- Uni Toast with avocado - This was my FIRST time having Uni, and I'm still adjusting to the texture and taste of uni, but this was a pretty good combination, I would say! I would recommend this dish too!\n- Seafood Chowder - last but not least.. the infamous seafood chowder! Excellent chowder, I must say, however, tis very very rich!! We got a cup of chowder and shared. You can taste the richness in the chowder, but they were also very generous with their fillings.\n\nI would def come back and try the happy hour one day.

The beer list is double the size of the wine list and is well curated. Boyfriend loves seafood, so we thought this would be a perfect place for both of us to go. We walk in on a Sunday, expecting to order off the regular menu. Lo and behold, they have HH on Sunday as well as weekdays! From the HH menu: we get the draught beer of the day, order half a dozen $1 oysters and get an order of the chowder. From the regular menu: 4 portions of crudo, two arctic char and two tuna poke.\n\nOysters were definitely $1 oysters. Not fantastic and not bad. Crudo: amazing. They were both very different and really good in different ways. I loved the crunch and tang of the horseradish tobiko on the arctic char and the dill left a pleasant aftertaste. The chowder, again, AWESOME. Smoky, chunks of seafood, super thick and rich. Very much like a seafood bisque. And the BACON. Amazing, thick chopped bacon so that you can still taste it. The HH portion is definitely small, but rich enough and filling enough for one person. We ended up ordering another one just so each of us could have our own little bowl. We soaked it up with plenty of bread (great host/waiter kept on bringing us more). \n\nI love that their menu is small, but with great choices. I love the interior space. I love the beer menu.

Great balance between light, healthy ingredients and rich flavors.\n\nMy girl friend and I split the 2-person crudo (~$30), the lobster/beet/burrata salad (~$20), and two cups of the seafood chowder (~$15). This was a perfect amount of food for the two of us!\n\nAll of the crudo samples were extremely fresh. You can tell the quality of the fish is superb. Of the crudo sampler, we both were unexpectedly very pleasantly surprised by the scallops. I'm not typically a raw scallops kind-of--girl, but these were fantastic and the sauce was lick-the-plate good! The Ono, while itself not so flavorful, was very fresh and the accompanying ingredients provided great texture. The Arctic char was good (love me some dill and creme fraiche), but it didn't live up to all the hype (don't get me wrong, I'd order it again for sure, I just expected it to be mind-blowing). Unfortunately, the onion dominated the butterfish. Overall, though, this entire dish is a burst of flavors, and definitely worth ordering on every visit!\n\nThe concept of dairy products (burrata) and seafood (lobster) together is so strange that, for me, it is almost always a non-starter. I'm glad we ordered it, however, because I wanted to try it, and I loved all of the individual ingredients in the salad (beets? good! lobster? good!! burrata? good!!) ..but for me this combination is too weird. This is the one dish I wouldn't order again. For the record, my friend really enjoyed this dish.\n\nThe chowder is hella salty, hella bacon-y, and hella-good! I think a cup (each) was the perfect amount. It is chock full of seafood gems - but the broth itself was my favorite part.

I'd like to say that half of the menu is basically a Western take on sashimi.  Not bad actually.\n\nSo my experience started off on the wrong foot; mostly due to the outlay of the restaurant.  There is no front desk at the front door.  So when you enter on a busy service, you are immediately standing in btwn tables.  There is no host and the servers are busy keying in orders and bills about 20ft to the right at the end of the bar.  So I just stood there waiting to be helped.  Servers walked pass me several times to the tables but never looked or asked me anything even though I looked lost and out of place.  ONE CHECKMARK AGAINST THE HOUSE!  After determining that their workflow is poor, I decided to approach them at the bar area.\n\nOnce I did that then it was fine.  \"I was in the loop finally.\"  I was asked to order a drink while I waited for my dinner compadre to arrive.\n\nThe rest of dinner was a fun night of trying their Crudo sampler which was very interesting on the palate.  The ahi was typical and nothing special.  The San Sebastian was ok but I felt the fish was overdone and dry.  Ending with the Seafood Chowder was great.  IT WAS AWESOME!!  It's clam chowder to the next level!  Very good I must say.\n\nAll in all...I'd say if you love seafood, then you HAVE to try this restaurant.", "author": "Cary L."}

The service was PHENOMENAL, specifically our beautiful server. She was knowledgeable when I asked about wine selections when I gave her my preferences (I know nothing about wine) and patient with us as well.\n\nThe food was delicious. The bf and I happened to stop during their happy hour period. We decided on some oysters (they have a bunch of varieties) and their manila clams. I've never really had raw oyster before, so this was definitely an eye-opening experience. The clams were good, albeit a very small portion for $5. However, the sauce the clams came in was SO GOOD. We ordered more bread just so we could dip it into the sauce.\n\nFor our entrees I had the Trout. I was surprised they actually served the whole fish than just a small fillet you would normally expect, so this was a plus. \nWe also shared a small platter, which typically comes with oysters, clams,mussels, shrimp, and half a crab. They were out of mussels so they gave us extra shrimp.\nOysters: Not my cup of tea. Definitely a lot smaller than what I'm use to seeing.\nShrimps: Really big. I enjoyed these.\nClams: never had a raw clam before..I think I prefer mine cooked.\nCrab: The crab was good, but I think they left it in the ice too long. It just seemed like the meat had been sitting in water a little too long, so it had this weird texture around the meat that I scrapped off.\n\nWhile I understand you tend to pay premium for seafood, being me I don't know if I can warrant spending that extra money on dishes that doesn't necessarily fill you up and leave you feeling hungry after dinner. (This doesn't apply to just Bar Crudo, but seafood in general)\n\nOverall would I go back? It's really iffy. Spent over $94 (without tip) for 2 people and we weren't really full. Plus, the hours of food poisoning have taught me to stay away from raw oysters. X_X However, totally digged the atmosphere and service.", "author": "Jenna H."}

We ordered 36 $1 oysters... and my goodness they were soooo heavenly! They were the creamiest oyster's i've ever tasted. Fresh, cleanly washed, properly presented, sweet faint taste of ocean water, and creamy like butter.. That's when you know you're in for a treat. I cannot believe they were only $1 at such an awesome restaurant. After our 2 dozen, we quickly ordered another dozen. It was just  THAT good. Something about their cucumber water and the vinaigrette sauce was magical. \n\nCompared to Hyde's Raw Bar, I thought Bar Crudo's oysters were smaller, sweeter, and creamier. Hyde's are definitely larger, but not as tasty. They also have $3 beers, and $5 wines. We also got the clam and linguine. The pasta was perfect, their portion of clams were sooo huge. \n\nService was excellent and attentive!! The waiter always filled our glass with refreshing cucumber water. The food may take a little awhile to come but well worth the wait. By 6pm, you can see the entire restaurant getting packed, and people were waiting in line to get seated!\n\nThe only reason I took off a star was because the oysters had a lot of small pieces of shells in it. that's probably because they use the same knife to cut shuck the oysters and cut the oysters off the shell.

Divided into \"Raw,\" \"Cold,\" and \"Hot\" sections, it has something for everyone, save for the hard core meat and potatoes type.\n\nThe Arctic char with horseradish cream, wasabi tobiko, and dill melts in your mouth. The sweetness of the fresh, but slightly small, Hokkaido scallops is the perfect foil to the celery root, roasted apple puree, and truffle salt garnishes.  The tombo tuna with pear, hazelnut, and pomegranate reduction was absolutely delicious.  While interesting, the olive, orange vinaigrette, black garlic, and shiso detract from the pure ecstasy that butterfish can be if left unadulterated.  A combination of tuna confit, asparagus, roasted red peppers, arbequina olives, fried caper berries, and manchego cheese, served on tomato bread, the San Sebastian is a stand-out in the \"Cold\" section of the menu, while the seared Hokkaido scallop served with spicy coconut curry, shrimp, and peppers on pea greens is the king of the \"Hot\" section.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and fairly priced.  With a reasonably large number of by-the-glass and by-the-bottle selections, it avoids the \"usual suspects\" in favor of lesser known, but menu-appropriate, choices from Germany, Italy, and France.  A highlight is the beer menu--a virtual tome, consisting of more than 50 selections from the light and refreshing Reality Czeck to The Abyss, an imperial stout.\n\nService is attentive, informed, and helpful.  Water glasses were not left empty, and servers provided excellent food and beverage recommendations--staff training is obviously a priority at Bar Crudo.\n\nWhile some of the food is raw, the cooking and service at Bar Crudo are not.

Because otherwise, you'd base your review on more important attributes.\n\nAfter months of curiosity about this bustling little restaurant in our charming neighborhood, my wife and I decided to try it out in December. Halfway through our meal, we were ready to write the place off, because despite the tasty food, the restaurant is unbelievably noisy and I found myself in a cramped space next to a bussing station facing a water-stained wall and a food-stained ikea drape. But most notably, the place was freezing cold. Noisy and cold are the sensations that stay with me most. I don't mind paying top dollar for a fine meal, but I expect a lot more than mere tasty cuisine for said dollars.\n\nMy cynical hotel concierge friend says the atmosphere is intentional, to keep people from sitting there any longer than they have to. For whatever reasons, I consider it inexcusable that the restaurant owners are making a mint off this place, while simultaneously refusing to make a minor investment in badly needed improvements for comfort and atmosphere.\n\nAs I said, we were ready to write the place off until we had the chowder. God f'ing dammit, that chowder is one of the best things I ever tasted. The chowder raised this review from two stars to an initial impulse of four stars, but I waited a few days to write it and by then the horrible decor, unpleasant noise level and intolerable temperature overcame the impulse, hence three stars.

Thank you Bar Crudo for that.\n\nBut onto the food:\n\nCrudo Sampler: the yellowtail jack and ono were not very memorable, except for the strange garnish and sauces. The butterfish was the highlight, with a little spicy kick which was balanced nicely with the sweet peaches. The arctic char, supposedly the house favorite, was absolutely awful. It was SO salty, coming from an avid salt-lover that means something. Our order was covered in sea salt below a layer of wasabi tobiko.   After I scraped as much of the salt off as I could, I have to say I think it would taste better without the salt and if the fish were cut a little thinner.\n\nMain Lobster Half: The highlight of the evening. A generous and sweet lobster, served cold with butter and lemon.\n\nSeafood Chowder: the broth was good, very creamy, but nothing spectacular. I did not have any mussels or shrimp in mine.  Instead I had 1 piece of calamari squid and several chunks of fish. The fish was flavorless and I ended up not eating the fish and just drinking the broth. For $7/cup I expected a little more.\n\nUni Avocado Toast: SUCH  disappointment! The presentation was great, but the avocado completely masked the taste of the uni. It tasted more like avocado on toast. Such a waste of uni. \n\nOverall, the food was meh, but the service was good. I would be open to trying for happy hour one day, but for regular dining I will not be back.", "author": "Samantha K."}

The meal was so memorable because it was great.  Both floors of the restaurant are cozy but we were seated in the more spacious second floor by the window. \n\nWe took our time to look over the menu and ordered a glass of viognier and Foret saison to start with.  We finally orderd the yellowtail crudo with enoki and daikon salad, scallops,whole sea bass (a daily special) and the seafood chowder.  The crudo dish was delicate, bright and had a nice textural contrast from the enoki.  The scallops and sea bass were done nicely.  To me the pinnacle of the meal was my seafood chowder.  It was out-this-world good.  I nearly lapped up the vestiges of chowder from the bowl.  If they served dessert, we would have gladly stayed longer.  \n\nWhile our waitress wasn't too knowledgeable about her beer and wine list, she gave us nicely paced and attentive service.  I loved the meal but I didn't get much food for the sticker price.  Keep this in mind if you've got big appetite.  If I'm in town again and am in need for some taste bud sensation or comforting chowder, Bar Crudo will be on the top of the list.", "author": "Darren S."}

So damn delicious - creamy, spicy, with chunks of seafood like scallops, calamari, halibut, and shrimp...with added flavor from bacon or chorizo! Honestly, it puts all other chowders to shame. Besides that, the menu here boats plenty of options for seafood lovers...your choice from raw, cold, and hot dishes. My husband and I usually order the same thing:  we order a small seafood platter which consists of a 1/2 portion of cooked crab and shrimp surrounded by raw oysters, clams, and mussels (the mussels are my fave topped with a fresh relish...wish they served these on their own - I could eat a whole plateful!) -- and we finish off with a cup each of the seafood chowder. Service can be slow but is always courteous, and they're mindful of giving extra napkins and hot towels especially when eating crab or lobster as it gets messy!\n\nDefinitely book reservations whether you dine alone, with a friend, or with a small group - as the place is tiny and fills up quickly. Even with reservations, prepare for a wait time of at least 20 minutes. \n\nI wish they had dessert options here too...the one time we asked for dessert, all they had were these tiny gourmet truffle chocolates the size of my thumbnail. And yes, the prices are a bit steep for the portions served, but savor in the quality of every bite, and order the seafood chowder.

I think one needs to take other cultures raw food dishes into account here. Crudo from Italy and Spain, ceviche from South America, are all represented here in ADDITION to Japanese style offerings. I like the diversity of the ingredients and I'd argue that the skilled use of acid, oil, spice, and most importantly salt, are done quite well here. Things we tried:\n\n-Artic Char - horseradish cream, wasabi tobiko, dill\n\n-Kona Kampachi - peaches, chili-lime vinaigrette, avocado mousse\n\n-Butterfish - salmorejo, jamon serrano, quail egg\n\n-Hokkaido Scallops - english pea puree, lemon zest, chive blossom\n\n-Spicy Yellow Fin Tuna - ginger, soy, sriracha, green onion\n\n-Rhode Island Fluke - jalapeno, basil, mint, citrus, coconut milk, chicharrones\n\n-Head-On Louisiana \"Devil\" Prawns - shishito peppers, basil, cilantro, red chile brodo \n\nAside from the Yellow Fin, which you CAN, frankly get at most Japanese places, everything else was quite tasty. Price/portion ratio may not be the best but that's always going to be the case for seafood here of this quality. Item list is also a tad on the short side.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-06", "description": "i am truly in love with this place. Rarely do I give 5 stars but I must say - everything about my experience there (it was not just a meal, it was a culinary experience!) was top-notch. SF is a tough city to stand out as \"the best\" because you have the delicious but overpriced Gary Danko, and the celebrity chefs like Michael Mina, and local celeb chef owners that do a great job like Locanda, Delfina, etc. Bar Crudo is in a league of its own and if you don't look carefully, you might pass it by!\n\nI came in on Wednesday night with a friend who lives across the street from Bar Crudo. Both of us had been meaning to try this spot from press we've seen, and through locals' word of mouth. We had intentions of dining at another venue, but I am so happy I was able to add this to my list of favorites. I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the masses to flock here! \n\nFor starters, the food. The menu - simple, delicious, fresh, local, seasonal, carefully prepared in a modest presentation kitchen slash sushi bar. One should note - I have yet to try it, but they have a great HH menu as well that has additional menu items not featured on their signature menu - oysters, fish tacos, steam clams. They are a dinner-only restaurant, and there are plenty of small plate offerings that I suggest you try a wide variety of menu items just to see what this restaurant is all about. \n\nI shared the Crudo Sampler Special for 2 and it is 4 sizable pieces of either ono, butterfish, yellowtail jack, arctic char (my favorite), scallops, which can all be ordered as single larger offerings. Loved the San Sebastian salad and the oysters, and by that time I was full because the beer and wine filled me up. If I had to do the night over, I would have ordered the seafood chowder, which seems to be everyone's favorite and a notable menu item. The presentation - clean & simple. The pairings of flavors - savory. The food is pretty affordable and high quality. Our server Emily was very attentive from start to finish and made great recommendations based on her palate, popular menu items, and our preferences.\n\nThe beer and wine menus are worth noting as well. They have some interesting finds that are local and not as recognized. Fell in love with a beer called (ironically enough) Temptation, from the Russian River, Santa Rosa. Categorized as a Wild Ale, 7.3% alc. and worth the entire $17/glass. The tart and the citrus flavors were light but sour and citrusy at the same time - and it left a remarkable aftertaste for anyone's palate. \n\nThe Staff - The Chef de Cuisine, Ian, truly knows what he is doing and his staff works very well with him. Everyone is extremely kind - from the host when you come in, to the careful and honest recommendations from the server based on particular taste buds, and even the chef and his minions. They made our dinner a fun one since we sat at the sushi bar/bar. Great group of people that work super hard.\n\nBar Crudo is tucked away on Divisadero St. between Grove and Hayes and is a stone's throw from that area's famed Nopa restaurant. It has a very cozy vibe, and you can tell that it is frequented by regulars, based on the rapport that is exchanged between the diners and the staff. It doesn't do much in terms of elaborate decorating, but it does well in the most important area: the food. The music was well selected by the host, Andrew, and it provided a great soundtrack for our dinner. They work in a communal fashion - and while each table has their assigned servers, everyone works together to provide for a seamless dining experience.\n\nEveryone who knows me knows the most important things are food, service, ambiance and staff, in that order. Bar Crudo certainly hit a high note in my book and  I look forward to coming back next week and many many more times after. I'm sold!", "author": "Tammy H."}

Seafood chunks in every bite.  It even had crispy bacon bits for texture and flavor (because everything's better w/ bacon!) Cup of seafood heaven.  We all ordered our own cup since the other Yelp reviews raved so much about it.  So glad I didnt have to share this.\n\nManila clams ($5) - the broth these came in was to die for!

To make a quick comparison, Neptune Oyster back in Boston blows these out of the water (no pun intended).  They were smaller, had bits of shell (unskilled shucking ftl), and inconsistently fresh as some had a noticeably fishy taste.\n\n-Seafood Chowder: Delicious!  One of the best chowders I've ever had.  The creaminess was delightful and not overpowering, balanced with a smooth spicy kick that came on gradually and complemented with big chunks of tender fish, mussels, and potato.\n\n-Fish Tacos: Beautiful presentation and quite tasty to boot.  I'm no taco expert by any stretch of the word, but I enjoyed the combination of rock cod, guacamole, peppers, onions, and blue corn tortillas.  \n\n-Steak Crudo: Creamy texture that contrasted well with the crispy bread - good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nService was solid with quick refills, plate changes, and good approachability.  I can't speak for the seafood crudo, but the oysters didn't inspire much confidence to say the least.

Even better experience than the last time I was here - four years ago above the Stockton tunnel, in the upper section. Three of us from grad school had dinner at the new (to us) location and definitely enjoyed ourselves. I look forward to going back again.\n\nMy guidance is to follow her (their) guidance of taking your courses in the order of raw, then cold, then warm. Otherwise some dishes may overwhelm others and you'll miss the full palette of flavors. One person at our table realized this by eating some of the chowder, which is spicy somewhat like a Thai soup, before the uni and avocado toast, which is yummy in its own way but clearly more subtle.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes ahead of our 730 reservation, and waited another 10-15 minutes. Standing near the back of the kitchen, we couldn't help but comment on the attractive plating heading to the tables; every dish looked compelling. At the table, our water glasses weren't filled for another 5-10 minutes. It bothered me but not enough to reduce my anticipation for the meal. Also, it helped me (us) settle into a deliberate pacing for the meal. \n\nTo be fair, our server was really patient with us. She was professional, even nice...and yes, cute too. Sorry, had to say it. My friends joked that I was flirting with her, but I try to be nice with every restaurant employee, and I didn't even think of asking her out while she was working. Restaurant jobs are demanding and my experience can be made or broken by any person. Her joke about my ridiculous thirst was fair - it was unusual because I'd taken a decongestant - but in my defense, there can never be enough cucumber water! I wish more restaurants served it!\n\nWe first ate the crudo sampler for two. Every bite was tremendous, especially the arctic char. The cheese plate was the second of our six courses. While it's a cold dish, I'd recommend it as the last cold dish, or even a dessert dish, given its natural richness. \n\nThe marinated jalapeno mussels, our third dish, were very good also. The natural flavor of the mussels stood up surprisingly well. \n\nOh, need to mention the wine list: it was reasonable, with the median bottle price being in the 30s.

Maybe the number of NoPa hipsters you're stuck serving has finally gotten to you.  Whatever it is, things have really gone downhill in our relationship.  Your menu offerings, which used to send me into a dither of delighted indecision, now trigger the opposite response (\"meh\") and are underwhelming in my mouth.  Your service, which was previously attentive and friendly-as-all-get-out, is now lax and at times downright rude.  And I'm still paying through the nose each time I cross your threshold.  So I'm taking my business somewhere that doesn't feel terribly smug about itself and show it in every way possible.  \n\nPeace out,\nDB", "author": "Dani B."}

Maybe I'm completely weaksauce but towards the end of our meal, I started to feel nauseous.  As soon as I got home (40 mins later), I threw up and had diarrhea.  And so did my boyfriend (minus the throw up).  No joke.  Anyway, I will try impartially rate the food as I was eating it.\n\nSampler (arctic char, kona kampachi, butterfish, scallop) - Can't decide what appetizer to get?  This is perfect because all the fish is fresh and prepared in a way that's easy on the palette.  The green tobiko on the arctic char is exquisite!!  That stood out to me the most.\n\nOysters ($2.5 each) - I forget which kinds we had but we just asked them to give us two pieces of three different oysters.  Loved those tiny bites however this might have been the food poisoning culprit.\n\nSteak Crudo - Hefty portions.  You get four mini cylinders of meat with five slices of crispy crostini.  Each of the four meat shapes are topped with differently with horseradish creme fraiche, pepper, quail egg, and spanish anchovy.  The first couple bites is good but if you're only sharing this with one other person, then this gets quite overbearing.\n\nUni and Avocado Toast - $10!  The dish comes with two huge pieces of crostini topped with two huge slices of uni EACH.  If you've had uni at a Japanese restaurant, then you know that this is a spankin' deal.\n\nSeafood Chowder - I actually think this was put me over the top.  Staring into the toilet bowl of barf, it resembled this dish.  I know... TMI!  Even though people rave about this soup, I thought it was mediocre in flavor.  They make sure to include at least one piece of seafood: squid, oyster (well I got 3 of this), shrimp, fish mussels and then oysters and bacon too.  I felt like some of these items was just a bit overcooked.\n\nIf you're into yuppies, an extensive wine/beer list, and exquisite small bites, then come here.  But I'm just not quite into the sophisticated and uptight environment.  Where is the fun in all this?!  Another big no-no was that every other table had bread and butter except ours.

It's a delicacy and top restaurants respect the $3.50 a pop that you are paying and present you with shell-free oysters every time. My fav place for oysters never fails to deliver on this - it can and should be done. For a seafood-focused place I am very dissapointed. This and the non-strategic fish-slicing are why I feel Bar Crudo is just coasting along on a reputation and not being attentive to a 5-star experience.\n\nTrout:\nPros: Amazing, delicious, perfectly done and of course fresh.\nCons: none, except sadness that I was too full by then to eat more of it.\n\nSummary: Enjoyed trying it - not worth the money for the yummy.", "author": "M B."}

I came here after some heavy deliberation about where to go with the boy for my birthday. I picked this place because I was kind of sick of French food, and pretty much unable to do Japanese, both of these due to a particularly debaucherous recent trip to Vegas. I wanted something different, so I found this place and decided to give it a shot. Boy, was that a great idea.\n\nMaking a reservation for this place was pretty easy for a Thursday at 7pm. I used OpenTable, and the whole thing went off without a hitch. We showed up, and got seated immediately by a very friendly and fashionable hostess (the servers here are all fashionably dressed! I usually don't notice these things, but here it was pretty obvious). \n\nWe started off with the sampler, and were told that if we wanted to change up the four items so we could try everything, we could. So we started out with the standard four items on the sampler: the char, the scallop, the kona kampachi, and the butterfish. The scallop needs no words. I am already partial to scallop, but this was totally fresh and the English pea puree was a great topping. The butterfish was also delicious, with the added bonus of a quail egg (which I absolutely love). The kona kampachi was also tasty, but the char was a little overpowered by the other flavors in the mix that I couldn't really taste it.  For our second round, we got the scallops and butterfish again, and tried the tuna and the fluke. The tuna had a very subtle taste of Sriracha which was definitely well done, since Sriracha has a tendency to overpower everything it's added to. The fluke was also good (and came with chicharrones!)\n\nFor the actual meal, I had the Hokkaido scallops which again didn't fail to disappoint, and the boy had the Steak Crudo. Both were really, really tasty, and didn't leave me with that heavy feeling after a meal I had grown accustomed to after returning from Vegas, which was highly appreciated.\n\nWhat sealed the deal for me was that after mentioning that it was my birthday (I know, I have no shame when it comes to such things), our server brought out a glass of dessert wine which was really, really tasty. That was the unexpected twist that made what would have been a four star review into a five star review. I will come here again and again to satisfy my seafood craving.", "author": "Angeline P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-02", "description": "This review is solely for Bar Crudo's amazing happy hour special- $1 oysters; $1 mussels and ~$3 beers.  How good is that?  :)\n\nRAW OYSTERS ($1/each) (4/5):  Imported from Washington, Bar Crudo's oysters are served raw and in a half shell with two slices of lemon and a side of cocktail sauce and lime sauce.  It was delicious.  I think we each easily ate eight oysters each.  We probably could have ordered 100 oysters and then some.  :P  If you're not able to get to the fresh Tomales Bay and Hog Island oysters, Bar Crudo's medium-sized oysters are the next best thing.  :)  The oysters were mildly sweet, fresh and tasty.  Thanks, Rita C., for finding such a great place!\n\nMUSSELS with JALAPENO ($1/each) (3/5):  The mussels were good, but not what I had expected.  They aren't served from the shell, but are taken out and piled onto a little saucer with jalapenos and peppers placed on top.  I didn't really get the jalapeno flavor, but it was nice to try. Next time, I'd probably pass on the mussels and concentrate on the oysters. \n\nVENUE:  For a party of 10, we sat upstairs overlooking the downstairs dining area and kitchen.  It was great seating, and it was nice being away from the crowded downstairs area.  The restaurant is narrow in the sense that it's an small, elongated restaurant that seats maybe about 50 people. The place had a romantic, chic feel to it.\n\nCLAM CHOWDER:  The best clam chowder I've had is from Boston.  The next best is from Hog Island in the Ferry Building.  The clam chowder here looks like it could be just as good as the one from Hog Island!  I didn't get it, but looking at the bowls of clam chowder (not the thick, creamy kind, but the actually clam broth with fresh clams and potatoes) made me wish I put in a order for a bowl of soup too.  Must try!", "author": "Sunny S."}

The counter is perfect for someone like me who dines alone.  You get a free show with your meal.  My server was a bit cool at first but after a few compliments on the food and she warmed.  \n\nOh, and if you get there early the seafood chowder, tacos and house wine are all dirt cheap.  Happy hour.\n\nSo I started with the cod tacos.  Great.  Two of them, each with a substantial filet of cod.  Add to that a bit of avocado, onion, pea sprouts, some assertive spicing, and grated cheese with a mildly astringent dressing and you have really good food.\n\nMy seafood chowder came with the tacos and that made me unhappy.  But the chowder stayed warm and it was full of chunks of fish, whole shrimp and potatoes.  Really good.\n\nFinally, a whole branzino that came with large beans and mushrooms over a tomato based sauce.  The branzino was properly cooked and was nice and pillowy.  The beans and mushrooms were very nice.  I would have preferred the fish to be served without the sauce so that its skin would have stayed crisp.  However, that would be a matter of each patrons' taste.  \n\nA the five dollar glass of red was pretty good.  I might just eat entirely off the happy hour menu next time.", "author": "David D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-28", "description": "I came here not knowing that it was a raw seafood type of restaurant. I just thought cooked seafood. Don't get me wrong though, I love most seafood, raw or cooked.\n\nOur party of three got lucky with our seating because a party had cancelled so we got the downstairs right by the window.  The restaurant is pretty small and had dim lightings but luckily we got window seats so the light shone in from the outside.\n\nWe were served water with cucumber in it, which was interesting because it made the water taste more fresh and less tap!\n\nWe tried all the different kinds of OYSTERS they had.  When the waitress brought out our platter of oysters,she quickly went through which oyster was which, but it just went in one ear and out the other.  I wished there was a toothpick indicating which were which.  Anyways, the oysters tasted very fresh and was the perfect starter for our meal.\n\nThen came the CRUDO SAMPLER, which were beautifully presented and consisted of a variety of 4 different types of raw fishes...\n\nARCTIC CHAR: my two friends thought this was the second best, but it was my least favorite because I don't like horseradish nor do I like wasabi flavor. If you like your salmon with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tobiko, then you would LOVE this.\n\nHOKKAIDO SCALLOPS: it was my second favorite, while this was the other two's favorites.  We loved the texture of the scallop when you bite into it and the flavors of the pea puree along with the citrus flavor of the lime went perfect with the scallop. \n\nKONA KAMPACHI: one of my friends and I rated this as third best, while this was the least favorite for the other friend. It wasn't too bad, the fish was really fresh and I probably could have done without the citrusy flavor of the peaches and the chili lime vinaigrette.  The sprouts on top, didn't seem to help with the flavor either, could have done without that garnish.\n\nBUTTERFISH: my favorite, one of my friends' third favorite and the other's least favorite.  I just loved the combination of the butterfish with the serrano ham and the salmorejo sauce.  It was the PERFECT combination along with a quail egg. This just did it for me.  I loved the flavor and it left me wanting MORE!!\n\nNext we had the STEAK CRUDO, which was beautifully presented.  At first I was hesistant to try it, I mean I've had raw beef before at a vietnamese restaurant, but i've never had raw chunks of beef.  It made me think of cat food.  But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  It went well with their bread.  It was very nicely flavored and spiced.\n\nLOBSTER HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD: absolutely to die for!!! IT WAS THE BEST DISH WE GOT!! We all LOVED it. If you come here, you MUST order this.  Their heirloom tomatos were fresh, sweet and juicy.  The fresh mozzerella melted in my mouth.  The lobster, plump, juicy, fresh, sweet and DELICIOUS.  The vinaigrette dressing went well with everything and the greens were nice fresh and crisp.  EVERYTHING just went well together!\n\nAfter everything came out...we wanted MORE...so we ordered...\n\nMONKFISH LIVER MOUSSE: sounds disgusting, but it wasn't too bad.  It had a very unique taste to it and after awhile it became pretty addicting.  Went very well with the bread. \n\nTUNA CONFIT: Another winner in my books.  I loved the tenderness of the tuna and the mix of asparagus and fresh bell peppers it was made with.  Olives complimented well with the rest of the dish and the TOMATO bread was DELICIOUS!!! Also loved the egg, which was cooked to perfection (not too cooked, not too raw...it had a perfect yellow yolk). I could have done without the cheese though.\n\nOCTOPUS SALAD: Just didn't deliver for me.  I didn't like the taste of it, it was too sweet for my liking.  I was expecting a more citrus flavor to it.\n\nThey served all the raw seafood first, then they served the cooked food.\n\nLastly we had the MANILA CLAMS: it wasn't all that great.  I actually thought the broth was a little bit on the salty side, but it tasted better when you dipped bread into it. Nothing too special for me.\n\nI was very impressed with their service, the presentation as well as the taste of the food.  It was definitely an experience that I'll remember for awhile.", "author": "Sarah F."}

I know, it's not raw... so it kind of breaks the trend. But still, give it a chance. The chowder was rich, creamy, and filled with of a variety of wonderful little sea food morsels. It had certain accents that made it simply like no other clam chowder I have had before. Though these little flavor accents were subtle, they revolutionized the clam chowder experience.

We walked in the door and . . . . stood there.  For a good five minutes.  And it was relatively uncomfortable because there's no real host area, you're just kind of loitering in the middle of the restaurant among a bunch of people trying to enjoy their meals.  Attempts to give restaurant employees pointed \"help me\" looks were completely ignored.  It's really not a pleasant way to start off a meal feeling completely unwelcome and awkward.  Finally, I was forced to approach one of the servers, who acted as if she was doing me a favor dealing with us.  We were then told it would be a couple minutes and to go hang out by the bar.  Fine.\n\nThe ordering was equally irritating.  When asked what the difference was between the six types of oysters, our server responded only with \"My favorites are the Kumamoto and the Kusshi.\"  . . . are you serious?  No one gives a shit what your favorites are.  We want to know what the DIFFERENCE is between them.  \n\nAfter the horrible start to the dining experience, there was just no possible recovery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-25", "description": "Bar Crudo is nothing short of amazing.  And, I don't mean to mean to be crude, but the seafood here is EFFING AWESOME.\n\nThe sign for the entrance can be a little tough for this place, but once you find the commanding, large windows in the front of the restaurant, the rest is easy.  For such a posh and modern looking place, service is surprisingly casual and friendly, in a good way.\n\nTo start, I had the Crudo Sampler.  The Crudo Sampler comes with an all-star lineup of Arctic Char, Hokkaido Scallops, Tombo Tuna, and Butterfish.  All the seafood tasted really fresh with unexpected, yet clean flavor combinations.\n\nThe Hokkaido Scallop was interesting with the roasted apple and celery root puree and truffle salt.  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it still tasted great.  The Tombo Tuna was also a little bit on the sweet side, but the sweetness of the hazelnut and pear was balanced with a nice tartness from the pomegranate reduction.  The Butterfish was one of my favorites, topped with olive, black garlic, shiso, and an orange vinaigrette.  I don't think I would have thought any of these ingredients would go together, but somehow, they did.  The fish itself was out of this world, and only tasted better with a great mix of sweetness and acidity.\n\nThe star of the sampler, however, was the Arctic Char.  The freshness of the actual char harmonizes perfectly with the spiciness of the horseradish cream and wasabi tobiko eggs.  Top that all with a bit of dill, and you got yourself a real winner.  Overall, the sampler is the best way to get a good idea of Bar Crudo's food.\n\nI also got a Beef Tartare topped four ways.  Each was topped with either an egg yolk, hot pepper, horseradish cream, or a sardine.  All were great, and the beef was really clean and fresh, but were a little less interesting than some of the other dishes.\n\nFinally, I got the Uni Avocado Toast.  I love uni, I love avocado, and I love toast.  So I thought this would be a great combination.  And it was.  It was a little heavy on the fattiness, but a little fat never hurt anyone.  There was also a side sudachi, frisee, and herb salad.  If you have the salad on top of the uni and avocado on the toast, there's a great combination of flavors and textures.\n\nOverall, the seafood here is innovative, updated, and crude.\n\nGET:  Arctic Char", "author": "Michael K."}

Who all happen to be delightful, lovely, and abnormally attractive.\n\nThe wine list is brief but outstanding, there are many options for the raw foodphobes among us, and I would cut a bitch for the excellent cheese plate and crazy delicious nicoise salad, which I don't think is actually listed on the menu as such. The man swears by the chowder and the raw goods, so I'll take it on good authority that it's all out of this world, especially considering the tastiness of the food I have had. \n\nGo here.

There is really nothing to fault here, maybe it's a bit loud, and a lot of things to praise.\n\nEverything is incredibly fresh and full of flavor.  The San Sebastian is somewhat like a Salad Nicoise, but the best one you ever had.  The seafood chowder is not really chowder, at least not like any I've had.  Instead, it is the best seafood soup I've had in the US.  Creamy, full of flavor, probably from a great fish stock, and seafood that is not tough.  Obviously someone took the time to make this come out right.\n\nThe raw fish is excellent - we had the sampler and every piece was put together nicely.  The lobster beet salad was excellent - more my wife's thing than mine, since I'm not a big lobster fan, but really nicely put together.  \n\nThe wine list should be a model for other restaurants in the city - innovative and unexpected choices, lots and lots of wines by the glass, and really good pricing.  If you like reds with the food they serve here, have the 4000 Metres Petit Rouge - for $10, one of the best wines by the glass I've had here.\n\nService was good - attentive without being overbearing.

Really want to try the Idaho Red Snapper next time.\n\nHere's what we've tried:\n\nHappy hour (Tue-Sun, 5:00pm-6:30pm)\n\n$1 Oysters - 1st week were really creamy and delicious from Washington, 2nd week they were too briny and stringy so we ordered some Kumamotos which are not too pricey at $2.50 and never disappoint. My recommendation is to first order a 1/2 dozen of the special oysters then decide about more. The worst that can happen is you'll be out $6.\n\n$1 Mussels - I've never had cold mussels but these were delicious with herbs and garlic. Get some of these.\n\n$5 Seafood chowder - Don't think about the amount of butter and cream used in this tiny but insanely rich cup of soup. Delicious and good amount of fresh! fish vs. potato filler.\n\n$5 Clams - Marinated in white wine broth...possibly my 2nd favorite next to the oysters.\n\n$10 Fish tacos (2) - Crazy good value for 2 lightly battered fresh cod and the works...1st time around these were a bit larger but still good on corn tortillas. \n\n$5 wine + beer - both went down way too easy.\n\nOff the happy hour menu\n\nCrudo platter - a must. Each individual fish had a great twist and made an incredible bite! We split one plate which was good enough with a bunch of dishes from the hh. \n\nOysters - Kumamotos, see above.\n\nRecommend to arrive early for HH - we snagged at spot at the bar but by 6pm there were a lot of people standing and order oysters in small space behind the bar. Service still held up pretty well when the crowd exploded....overall attentive despite the rush. And of course the food, presentation and vibe was awesome from start to finish.

It's pretty down-to-earth, and more about the food than the atmosphere.  It's not a typical romantic date place. It is not inexpensive (dinner for 2, around $100.00).\r\n- The portions are small.

That may sound like an obvious thing but I'm serious when I say that otherwise, the flavor and texture make me a little nauseated. That being said, Bar Crudo has my props (and four stars) for providing fresh seafood tastily prepared.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nOysters: we ordered some beausoleil and the one that's like a big Kumamoto (don't remember the name). I'm not a fan of raw oysters (don't like the texture or the taste) but I tried some and they were fresh.\n\nRaw Arctic Char: so freaking delicious. It was tender and buttery and the horseradish cream set the flavor off. This was my favorite of the night.\n\nHokkaido Scallop: not much flavor (but scallops rarely do, IMHO) but fresh.\n\nLobster Heirloom Tomato Salad: Not too much lobster here but lots of burrata and beets. The lobster was also not touched flavor-wise and was a bit plain but the beets were tender and went well with the pistachios.\n\nPan-Seared Swordfish: tender, well-seasoned, went wonderfully with the bok choy and mushrooms that accompanied it.\n\nGrilled Yellowtail (this was a replacement for the bass of which they ran out): flaky and bass-like but not as flavorful as the swordfish. I loved the Brussels sprouts and the scallop broth was salty in a good way. \n\nOverall, I'm a fan because of the fresh food, young atmosphere and good price.", "author": "Christine P."}

Although this isn't a terribly new concept, in my opinion, it is in its infancy as far as exposure on the United States culinary scene.  Have you ever noticed the way ingredients have their 15 minutes?  Napa restaurants are notorious for this.  Star chefs will do a menu featuring a particular ingredient or preparation; examples that come to mind: skatewing, foie gras corndogs, sunchokes, kanapachi, wagyu, foam, raw, you get the idea.  Soon everyone is doing it until it is overexposed like certain young Hollywood stars.  Bar Crudo is a trendsetter; watch for many to follow in their very capable footsteps.

DO NOT SKIP the lobster salad. Truly a must-eat. Actually, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but if you want the full experience, I suggest the following: sit upstairs (it's slightly less noisy and there's less body traffic); start with the lobster beet salad and the crudo sampler. For mains, hit up the whole roasted Branzino or the Idaho trout. Pro tip: their happy hour rocks. Excellent clam chowder, great though non-traditional fish tacos, and of course delectable imbibables for those that care to partake. Bonus points that BC is easy and casual enough for bites with friends or a date, yet the food is wow-worthy enough for out-of-town guests and family.

We had already tried Hyde Street Raw Bar for oyster happy hour twice before and loved it.  Now it was time to expand our horizons!  \n\nWish we didn't.\n\n1.  They only offer one kind of oyster for oyster happy hour.  HSRB offers 3, and they are huge and juicy.  At the same price of $1/oyster.  Crudo doesn't even shuck their tiny oysters well - I had shell pieces in my mouth, gross!  \n2.  They only offer one kind of beer, Pilsner ONLY, for happy hour.  HSRB offers many more.\n3.  The service at Bar Crudo is atrocious.  \n\nLet's extrapolate on #3.  Service is one of those things, if done poorly, leaves even the best food with a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.  \n\nOur server did not greet us or even look at us, until she finally came to our table 10 minutes after we were seated.  And before you ask, NO they were not super busy, and YES we did the craned necks and turn to find her several times.  The problem with the 10 min wait, is that my sister, who also was a server for several years, stated that you NEVER would give a dessert menu to another table before greeting a new table.  Even if she just quickly said as she wooshed by us in a hurry \"Hi girls, I'm sorry I'll be right with you,\" would have sufficed.  \n\nNOT ONCE did she check on us during the meal, ask us if we needed anything, how the food was, nothing.  No water refill, we had to ask for more bread after many neck cranes, annoying as hell.   \n\nI say stick to Hyde Street Raw Bar, MUCH better oysters and better service.

Small menu, lots of samplers, extensive wine and beer list.   Everything to keep me happy.\n\nWe sat at the bar which is my favorite because we got to see the options as they were being prepped.  Any kitchen that is on display is not hiding anything.  For wine I had a pleasant Alexander Valley Savigion Blanc, Hay Hook.  We started with the Crudo Sampler.  Every piece of fish is a work of art , unique flavors and beautifully presented. I am not sure what Artic Char is but it tastes good!  The tobiko popped in little explosions in my mouth. Best bang for your buck.\n\nAs an entree I had the San Sebastian salad.  A novel take on my favorite, Nicoise salad.  Every bite was a fantastic bite of any of the seven flavors on my plate.  My only regret was not having enough of an appetite to finish.   My date had the seafood chowder which looks to be a hearty choice on a cool San Francisco Day, though he did have to request bread to go with it.

When I lived in SF, I often looked up sf.funcheap.com for fun/cheap/free things to do in the city.  They advertised Bar Crudo and mentioned their happy hour.  The chowder is divine - chunky and VERY fresh seafood.  The broth was creamy and very flavorful.  A $5 cup is just enough.  The oysters run a little small, but what do you expect! - they're a buck a piece!  I remember trying the happy hour tacos - meh.\n\nThe ambiance is casual but nice.  There's an upstairs seating area if you want to get away from the cramped first floor - but only if you arrive early enough to snag a table.  There are candles lit everywhere that give a romantic feel to maybe a casual \"meet up\". Playful mermaids are painted on the white walls and I love the small standing tables that fold down from the wall.  The kitchen is wide open for you to see and watch the chefs make your food - I love when they do this.  Shows that they're honest, fresh, and clean!\n\nIt can get pretty crowded during happy hour - so try to ditch work a little early to grab a spot in the restaurant.

The drink selection was decent enough to work in my own pairings with the fish selections....I was thirsty.\n\nRoughly 75% of the crudo offerings were pretty good (pricey most likely depending on where you would go as an alternative but good for that night) and had a nice balance of sweet/ sea salty with some acidity available in the sauces. Of course I liked the butterfish and artic (how can one screw up butterfish if they have a good buyer?).

All throughout dinner she was not friendly, and made it feel like she was just trying to get rid of us....despite our ordering 5 small plates, two larger plates, and then two more large plates. This brings me to the one food issue. We ordered the cheese plate, pretty simple and hard to mess up....the grilled bread they served us was completely charred. We literally had to scrape charcoal off the bread to be able to eat it. When she cleared the plate she never said anything about the obvious pile of charcoal. \n\nOther than the waitress and the burnt bread the food was incredible.", "author": "David C."}

The pictures looked great, the reviews were amazing, and happy hour prices sweetened the deal.\n\nOh, but what a sour deal it was. We had the crudo sampler, which consisted of delicious fish with....\"interesting\" combinations of dressings. Jessica L. and I agreed that the celery root and roasted apple puree reminded us of a somewhat sweet but bland baby food, and even more, didn't really accompany the scallops well. The tuna was forgettable (and by that, I mean I can't even remember what was on it but I remember it not being very good); the butterfish went well with the olives and the rest of the 'condiments' (I guess I could call them that) seemed to just...crowd the palette. The arctic char tasted good with the wasabi tobiko and could've left off the rest...which makes it not much of a crudo any more, but rather just sushi! \n\nBar Crudo, how you've disappointed me. Their fish was fresh and delicious, but served as crudos, I'll have to pass. Their $1 happy hour Point Reyes oysters kept me happy and their very creamy seafood chowder with bacon was tasty, but that heavy richness had to be shared.\n\nDespite all that, the service was helpful, and the space was cute though crowded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-05", "description": "Beer lovers love happy hours, and some of the beer bars in San Francisco offer some great bargains. Toronado, of course, has $1 off draft beers from opening until 6 p.m. At Lucky 13 in San Francisco, you can drink fresh Pliny the Elder, Dogfish Head 90, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Anchor Liberty and many more for $3 a pint from opening until 8:30 p.m. Most other beer bars offer some variation of a happy hour from around 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. or so. (Don't forget to tip $1 per beer.)\nBut one of the best happy hours in the city isn't even at a beer bar; it's at Bar Crudo on Divisadero. Bar Crudo's selection of some four-dozen bottled beers, along with a handful of well-chosen taps, would put many so-called beer bars to shame. But what sets Bar Crudo apart is its happy hour food. Usually, happy hour in a bar means a few munchies, Buffalo wings, or something deep-fried and virtually unrecognizable. At Bar Crudo, a lot of the food never goes near a flame, let alone a deep fryer. Bar Crudo, as its name implies, specializes in raw dishes, mostly seafood -- six types of fresh oysters; five types of clams; and small plates of raw arctic char, butterfish, Tomba tuna, Hokkaido scallops, spicy yellowfin tuna and Hawaiian ono -- as well as steak crudo and several other \"cold\" preparations. You can also order cooked seafood, as well as delicious seafood chowder, brimming with large chunks of fish, and fish tacos ($5 at happy hour). \nWhile other restaurants conceal frozen fish under deep frying batter or buttery sauces, at Bar Crudo there's no place to hide. Preparation is subtle and minimal, allowing the fish to be the star of the show.  \nThe lineup of five draft beers matches well with the food: Moonlight Brewing Reality Czech ($3 a pint during a happy hour recently), Allagash White Belgian-style wit beer (which adds some spritzy, subtly lemony zest to the oysters and raw seafood), Firestone Walker Solace, Russian River IPA and the 30th anniversary stout from Sierra Nevada and Anchor Brewing. (When you see Russian River and Moonlight on tap, it's a good sign; those brewers, who distribute their kegs themselves from Santa Rosa, love showcasing their beer with great food, and they're very selective.) \nThe extensive list of nearly 50 bottles is also carefully crafted to complement the fresh seafood, from Hitachino Nest White Ale and Bavik Pils to Ommegang Ale, Gouden Carolus and Duchesse de Bourgogne Flanders red ale (for those with a sour tooth). Wines are well-matched as well, with some sparklers like German Gilabert Cava Brut and whites and reds from France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Chile, Argentina and Napa. \nBar Crudo moved to what is now known as NOPA (north of the Panhandle) last year from its original location above the Stockton Street tunnel. The highlight of the new restaurant is clearly the fish itself, along with the people who deftly prepare it. There aren't any TVs, but that's OK when you can watch gifted chefs work their magic live and in real time. \nBar Crudo is taking California cuisine to a new level, showing the culinary world what can be accomplished with simple, fresh ingredients matched with great beer like Allagash White and Moonlight Reality Czech poured fresh from a tap. The overall experience is sublime, and when you can have half a dozen fresh oysters, a delicious cup of fish chowder or fish tacos and two excellent pilsners for less than $20, it's almost irresistible.", "author": "chuck l."}

One of us really liked the arctic char, but to me it was a little bit on the too-rich side. My favorite were the Hokkaido scallops with mini daikon leaves and yuzu extract, though I did pick up the slightest hint of msg from the yuzu sauce. \n\nUni avocado toasts - the creamy uni & avocado just melt in your mouth, balanced out by the crispness of the toast. (uni = sea urchin, btw) \n\nDevil prawns - these were ok. A little overcooked and shell-on. Definitely try their other main dishes over this one. \n\nTruffles - our server was nice enough to give us extra truffles  They were good and looked hand-made, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nDrink:\nTheir wine menu is short but has choice selections; emphasis on French/European wines, and our server knew the perfect wine to pair with the oysters/seafood. The grenache blanc was amazing, dry and smooth with a very slight sweet flavor (warning, it's $75 for the bottle - so you could say, 'hey it better be good' ). On the other hand, the Sauvignon blanc was a great deal, $30 and complimented the oysters so nicely. \n\nDecor:\nVery clean and new-looking, with a urban chic theme. It's fancy enough to make the dinner feel special, but laid-back enough where you don't have to worry about spilling your wine on a white table cloth (there is none). \n\nService:\nThe servers were really friendly and easy to chat with.

And I have to warn you sometime the size of the oyster they serve is tiny the size of my pinky nail)\n- Dungeness crab meat and beet salad $15\n-Devil Prawns $16 (my favorite)\n- The crudo sampler plate $12 (Tuna, scallop, Char, butterfish)\n-2 glasses of white wine $5/each (happy hour)\n-cucumber water\n\nThe portion is small almost tapas size for some dishes that's why I think they get a 3$$$ instead of 2. All their dishes except for their seafood platters are all under $20.\n\nBar Crudo's happy hours are RAW!!!\n\n**DW TASTE APPROVED**", "author": "Dick W."}

Their arctic char is great and the chowder is too die for. We also had oysters and the uni toast today. \n\nHowever, Jennifer W. decided to make my visit a little crappier today.\n\nI'm one who tips your standard 15-20%. Today, I made a bit of an accident because I was trying to account for the fact that I bought a beer when no one else in my party had. Our tab came out to $152 after taxes and the SF surcharge (so a 15% tip would have been $20), and after subtracting for my delicious Rasputin Stout, it came out to $36 for everyone else before taxes and tip. Everyone else decided to put in $4 (a little on the low side), and I was planning to put in a little extra on my own for both my beer and for tip. However, I was admittedly a little tipsy and when it came to signing off my credit card, I completely forgot to put extra in my tip for my beer and to cover the rest. All in all, we came out to a $16 tip ($4 x 4) after I had initially signed my receipt. \n\nI thought we were squared away and we were about to leave, but Jennifer rushes  in and asks us if anything was wrong. Not realizing my faux-pas on the calculation, I responded \"No! Everything was great!\". Then, Jennifer proceeds to say, \"Well was anything wrong? You only left $16 on a $152 tab (by the way this was after sales tax and the SF health surcharge; so our tip as it was was only 12% vs the 15% we were planning to leave)\". I wasn't getting it, so she kept iterating that our tip was low. I finally made the connection that I had forgotten to include the beer, and I promptly corrected it. However, I felt as if I was browbeat into it by this waitress, and I was not very appreciative of that. I gladly will pay the right tip, but don't be rude about it. In the service industry (I work in consulting, which some may not think is analogous to the job of a waitress/waiter, but I think client service is client service) you should never act as if you deserved to get paid extra. And, Jennifer needs to learn that lesson as she pretty much ruined a pretty amazing meal as I was very steamed after that.\n\n+5 for the food, -4 for the crappy aftertaste Jennifer imparted during the last 2 minutes in the restaurant. Oh yeah, she forgot to put in our order of uni toast and we had to prompt her at the end of the other courses.", "author": "Harrison T."}

Overall, a cozy little restaurant (probably seats a total 20-30 on a good day) with exceptionally good service.  I was a little disappointed with the prefix menu and honestly, would probably have preferred \"chowing\" on some of the regular dishes off the menu (especially since they're known for their raw dishes - gotta love it!).  However, if you blend in the atmosphere, great service, fairly easy parking for a small SF restaurant, and fresh raw dishes they provide I'll still give them a 4 star.

It tastes as if they killed the fish right before it landed on your plate.  (That's a little abrupt, I know, but it's descriptive and true.)\n\nThe crudo remain inventive:  I tried all five, liked all five.  The Atlantic char with horseradish is (of course) fantastic, but so were the rest:  butterfish, scallop, tombo tuna, the special scallop with a cold curry sauce.  Incroyable.   There are always five or six (or three) (who knows) distinct flavors going on at the same time.  I love that they are distinct.  (In a way, a Vietnamese sandwich is the same: cilantro and jalapenos and warmth and cold.)\n\nAlso had the beet salad with lobster and my favorite Gioia burrata (available at Cowgirl Creamery).   Very fresh, good, but it didn't quite sing.  It needed something else to tie it together subtlely.... a touch of grapefruit salt?  Balsamic reduction?  A couple of flakes of red pepper?   The crudo has so much, and this was almost right but a little . . . bland.  Still, uber fresh.  \n\nWe finished off with the scallop and curry hot dish and split a seafood chowder.  Crazy good.  The wines go really well with the food:  there's a lovely Crozes-Hermitage Marsanne-Rousanne that is austere enough to go with fish yet rich enough to satisfy.  The Albarino also works really well.  \n\nI will say that the slo-o-ow food concept remains untouched:  we weren't exactly slamming the wine on a school night, and yet we finished that Crozes-Hermitage before the final courses.   Then again, I like a leisurely dinner, and a split glass of Albarino did the trick and brought us home, stuffed to the absolute brims.\n\nAlso, lovely service, and I like the new spot.  Again, I don't know how they deliver such amazingly fresh fish, time in and time out, in such a small place. They must work hard to solidify their relationships with vendors.\n\nP.S.  While they have a uni toast, boy, I miss the old uni presentation.  At the old place, the owner dove once a week (Wed? Th?) for uni, served it spiked on the shell, and it tasted, as I think I said in review 1, like the sea.  I don't even like uni.  (Well, I guess I do now.)\n\nP.P.S.  I miss the Tunnel Top!  I love that bar, and my favorite SF dining experience was to go there first for a drink (fairly amazing watermelon martinis in the summer, and I don't really drink frou frou drinks) and then to Bar Crudo.  But still, this was lovely.  Parking?  Not as easy.  Food just as amazing.", "author": "Laurel B."}

And I cannot remember a time when I felt so happy and satisfied afterwards.\n\nBar Crudo is seriously a stones throw from my bedroom.  If I had to run to the nearest restaurant in an emergency it would be Bar Crudo.  Yet it took me four months to actually arrive.  For four months I have had people say to me, oh you live there? have you been to bar crudo.  At at some point my not going status became almost as important as my not having a facebook status.  But my self-control is not as strong when it comes to food as it is with rekindling friendships from the sandbox or knowing that so and so ran five miles and felt great.  Alas, the oysters on the happy hour bid me in...\n\nThe place is adorable, sort of small so make a reservation. Though I have heard rumors that they are expanding.  The happy hour menu is amazing.  The fish tacos are incredible, but messy...I seriously looked like a five year old that was left in a kitchen by herself to eat green cake with her hands. The sea food chower is cheap on the happy hour menu and so tasty, has a ton of different fish and a spicy kick.  I left this chowder until the end as they recommend.  And of course had half a dozen amazingly yummy oysters for 1.00 each.  Not on the happy hour menu we had a great glass of white wine, raw butterfish bites which i've been obsessed with since the sushi chef at ten-ichi expanded my life by introducing me to such melty gooy goodness...only complaint of the night, they put too many little toppings and garnishes on it at bar crudo.  Butterfish needs only its naked miraculous self...Then we got the lobster, baratta, heirloom tomatoe, arugula salad to split...(and my leftovers are still quite possibly sitting on the bar at Cafe Abir...sad face)...\n\nThere is an amazing beer menu, and who knows about dessert, I was in seafood coma and didn't even ask.  Whcih, if you know me at all, has never happened.  \n\nSo, to put this in less words...I ate the ocean and didn't care about the dessert.

First time we were here, it was not busy and only a handful of tables were filled. However, the waitress couldn't get our order right at all. Two chowders showed up as one, but was quickly remedied. Our later order of a dozen oysters showed up as two dozen and the server tried to convince us to keep the extra dozen, with no mention of a discount. Drinks took a while to get replenished -to the point where we gave up on our second round of booze because the waitress disappeared.\n\nSecond time we came, they couldn't decide if there was happy hour on NYE or not. After a no, yes and then a no, they decided to give us happy hour specials because someone had said it was available.  \n\n2: I'm currently suffering from the worst case of bacterial food poisoning I've ever had. The NYE happy hour special sure didn't do me any favors. I've eaten over 200 oysters at Hog Island and never been sick, but my second time at Bar Crudo put me in the ER.

Seriously, it is literally so dark in the upstairs area that I felt like I was eating in a closet.\n\nWe opted to leave after crudo, which is fine because I couldn't stand any further let downs.\n\nIf I come back, which I probably will because I want to like this place, and want to believe I came on an \"off\" day, I am going to insist on sitting downstairs.  And no more crudo.  I still shudder thinking of that sticky fish.", "author": "Lorin Y."}

In fact, for the most part you can do that for all the raw bar. The arctic char crudo was a generous portion for a crudo plate and was very \"Nordic\" in flavor...dill, horseradish.

Plenty of interesting things on the menu for people who aren't fond of oysters (like me).  \n\nSeafood and shellfish were f.r.e.s.h. Like, nothing even remotely, mildly on the nose. We had lobster and beets, prawns, their yellow tuna - similar to sashimi but served in a 1x1 cube with scallions - and a really quite amazingly bacony new england style clam chowder with a little octopus floating on the top.  The dishes were all great and well executed in their own right, serving timed well and in the right order. I mean, who wants lobster and beets AFTER a spicy prawn dish?\n\nSitting at the bar was cool. It was uncrowded but busy and noisy enough to make you feel like you're eating somewhere where something is happening.

It was cozy, but you still had room to have private conversation. We couldn't help but look over at the couple across from us who were like the dining dead they describe in Eternal Sunshine. Both were texting or checking email on their iphones instead of talking to each other... how sad.\n\nThe crudo sampler started with the scallop with micro greens and what was very much like a chickpea puree. The flavors with subtle and the textures were perfect together. After that they recommended we try the tombo tuna with lemongrass and siracha. That was probably one of the most delicious pieces of fish I've had in a while. It was extremely fresh and none of the flavors overtook the dish (which is difficult with siracha).\n\nThey followed this with a kampachi with hazlenuts and pears. It was sweet and salty at the same time, acting as a perfect following to the tuna. Finally we ended with the arctic char, which had horseradish and wasabi tobiako. It was one of the freshest pieces of fish I've had in a long time and the spice of real wasabi was also not overpowering. \n\nWe continued with the lobster, beet and burrata salad with watercress. Dear god please get that salad. It had giant pieces of lobster and they served golden beets with it. Everything was so fresh and the flavors were absolutely perfect together. This came with a very large bowl of mussels simmered in a Belgian beer sauce with scallions and bratwurst. This dish went splendidly with my pint of Rocket Red ale. The mussels were very large, very fresh and came in a huge portion.\n\nWe ended with a cup of the seafood chowder and that was the only thing neither of us were crazy about. For me, it was far too heavy and a cup would be great for about 4 people. It had a good flavor, but it's essentially bacon flavored cream that happens to include squid. If I hadn't enjoyed the rest of the meal and much as I did, I might have favored the soup more.\n\nIt was casual, but a fantastic evening. The service was attentive and we were very pleased with our first dishes. I will certainly go back, and I'll probably give them a higher rating if I switch out the soup for some oysters or crab instead :-)", "author": "Stephanie H."}

One staple is the arctic char, which has an incredible horse radish cream with wasabi tobiko and a splash of dill on top.....awesome.

Their decor is funky and modern, but the way they space out the seats is a bit too tight making it difficult to flag a server who's extremely always busy.  We had the seafood platter, which was not so bad. It tasted like every other platter I've had before maybe a tad fresher than some. We also had the lobster which wasn't cooked well.... a bit overcooked. If it didn't cost so much, we wouldn't have finished it. That's how so-so it was. Lastly was the seafood chowder. Although the chowder was really good it has a good kick to it, but it would've been better if they served it at the beginning. The service was so-so, I would've liked it more if the server had good suggestions or at least let us know the specials for the day, stuff like that.

This was a freshing start.  Lots of tomatoes, basil, white corn, fresh mozzarella and lobster.  The lobster was a bit bland, but everything else had loads of flavor.  Tomatoes and corn were super sweet and the Mozzarella was soft, mild yet flavorful.  \n\nArctic Char ($12) - 5 stars.  Amazing.  It comes with 4  thinly sliced fish, like a sashimi, topped with horseradish cream and wasabi flavored tabico.  The fish is very fresh.  It's richer than a typical sashimi/sushi due to the cream.  It's a very nice combination.\n\nSeafood Chowder ($7 a cup).  5 stars. Probably the best chowder I've ever had.  It was amazing  The chowder was very rich, but did not have any flour in it like the typical chowder.  It had squid, fish, mussels, shrimp and smoked bacon, which gave the soup a very distinct flavor.\n\nLouisiana Devil Prawns ($12).  4 stars.  This was tasty and surprisingly spicy for a non-Asian place.  It tasted more Asian (Thai, Sichuan) than Cajun.  The dish comes with 4 prawns with shell and head still intact, basil, cilantro and chili peppers.\n\nChocolate Plate. 4 stars.  This was great.  6 pieces of handmade dark chocolate with raspberry, caramel and peanut butter fillings.  The chocolate was soft and the fillings were nice.  The best one was the caramel.   \n\nThe food was all very nicely presented.  Unfortunately, I forgot my camera tonight.  This place also has a huge list of Belgium beers.

I found it quite a bit more difficult to manage than sushi, for example. \n\nWe ordered the half Dungness Crab, followed by the \"Crudo Sampler\" of raw fish -- interesting, but somehow a bit unsatisfying. Finally, a couple of hot (cooked) dishes -- a cup of the very good chowder, and the scallops, also very tasty. \n\nGood enough, without being memorable.

The Seared Hokkaido Scallops dish was 4 small scallops on a thin layer of coconut sauce with some alfalfa sprouts sprinkled on top.  No starch to make it an entree. \n\n2) If you're hungry be ready to order a lot of items as everything comes in very small tapas-style portions.\n\n3) The bathroom lighting is extremely dim.

We both ordered a Row 2 Hill 56 from Russian River Brewing, a recent addition to the brewery's portfolio.  I thought it's modest Alcohol level and piney-citrus hop nose would be a great companion to the food.  Oh yea . . .\nTwo types of Massachusetts Oysters to begin - sweet, briny oysters reminded us both of our New England roots. The Crudo sampler was just perfection. Two pieces of each and we adjusted that bliss by adding the Ahi Tuna to it, as it normally comes with 4 out of the 6 choices. Outstanding.  Tender, hyper-fresh fish wearing nothing but a few simple accompaniments to bring out the charm.  We loved the Butterfish so much we then ordered another plate with 4 portions of it.\nThe lobster salad was ok. The waiter told us that it was amazing with the heirloom beets from previous weeks, however the chef was using heirloom tomatoes this time. Texturally it wasn't exciting.  Although a bit full, we decided to have the chowder to finish, in lieu of dessert.  OMG.  I don't think there was any flour in it - just a smoky, bacon infused reduced cream with lovely shellfish and mollusks, few potatoes and heaps of love. This was worth breaking the bowl and licking the shards.\nService was good - casual, relaxed SF hipster style. We were amazed that one server had so many tables - we were worried at first when it took a while to get our first dish to the table, but things arrived on time from then on.\nDefinitely will return", "author": "JerBear .."}

We shared 1.5 dozen oysters, and they were so fresh.  \n\nWe also tried the $5 Happy Hour seafood chowder, which was unbelievably good.  Not only was the calamari tender and the fish soft (both of which are usually over-cooked in soups after being kept on the stove for too long), but the bacon flavor was mouth-watering.  The soup wasn't too thick, and had the consistency of a mix of broth and chowder.\n\nWe also tried the Crudo Sampler, and we liked everything!  They use really interesting ingredients paired with different types of raw fish that are harmonious in a very surprising way.  The most mind-boggling one was kampachi with the hazelnut and pear.  It was unexpectedly delicious!", "author": "Jen Y."}

Bar Crudo!\n\nSeriously though, if you're looking for quality seafood with bountiful flavor, make a reservation at Bar Crudo. Do be warned, it's a small place and the Happy Hour is literally only 1.5 hours long (5-6:30pm). \n\nTHE FOOD \nMy reservation for Bar Crudo was a selfish one. My boyfriend admittedly is not a big fan of seafood. But they managed to even make him a happy fan.\nOYSTERS // Hello, top notch oysters like Washington for $1?! Hell to the yes. 1/2 a dozen just for me, thank you very much. \nHERB & JALAPENO MARINATED MUSSELS // My dude loathes raw oysters so he ordered one of these, and then two more. He liked it. I tried one and almost spat it out...trust who you will. This was the only thing I didn't love. \nROCK COD TACOS // Pretty pricy to be on the Happy Hour menu at $5 a piece, but the nicely charred cod is generously portioned and the hot sauce they use on it really gets the burn going. \nBAR CRUDO SAMPLER // Yum yum yum. The only thing we ordered not offered on the Happy Hour menu, but well worth it. Basically it's sashimi + toppings. The fish chunks are big enough that we split each one in half to share. Arctic Char (salmon), Butterfish, Yellowtail, and Scallop. All fresh and flavored superbly. You've never had sashimi this way, so try it out. \nSEAFOOD CHOWDER // Arguably their most famous, and best, dish. It is that good. Chock full of fish, squid, and shrimp and the broth is off the wall! Creamy, a little tomatoey...just wonderful. $5 a cup during HH! It's a steal. \nAlso, beer & wine for $3 and $5, respectively.\n\nTHE PLACE \nIt's pretty hipster, but in a good way. Small, clean space with interesting art adorning the walls. Our server was helpful and attentive. Food was served in the order they deemed appropriate (cold to hot). He even gave us a heads up about a Silent Disco party at the SF Zoo for the following night. Too bad our dinner plans got in a way. \n\nNext time I'm in the area, I would go back in a heartbeat.", "author": "Amy L."}

Energetic, modern, fun atmosphere. The first floor is where all the action is so it can get a bit loud. If you're seated upstairs it's dark and quieter - perfect for that intimate date.  \n\nThe crudo? The freshness of the fish was outstanding.  I fell in love with how beautiful and creative each dish was and how fish just melts in your mouth. Hokkaido scallops were sweet pillows of goodness and the butterfish was just that - buttah! my least favorite was the fluke which I felt had too much going on in terms of flavor but still extremely fresh and delicious. \n\nYou have to get down and dirty with the prawns since they're served head on and shell intact - which I don't mind. Don't forget to suck the head *snicker* since that's where the flavor is it. The hamachi collar was extremely tender but the skin, although crisp and tasty left a fishy taste in my mouth the entire night. \n\nOur meal was a bit pricey due to the splurge on wine and oysters. I left the place far from being full since we didn't order anything substantial and the portions for what we did order we quite small. So be prepared to spend some dough if you want to get full.

But let's not forget what city we live in people.  \n\nMade reservations via OpenTable for dinner on a weekday which was a smart move on my part since the place was just starting to fill capacity around 6:15.  We were lucky enough to catch the tail-end of their happy hour though which was another smart move.  $1 Point Reyes oysters and $5 cups of their infamous chowder!?  The dipping sauces for the oysters were delightful.  The chowder was flavorful on its own and remained undominated by its seafood parts.  \n\nMy friend and I then ordered the Crudo Sampler and the Uni Avacado Toast.  The Uni Avacado toast was good though I wouldn't go out of my way to order it.  The Crudo Sampler's highlights were definitely the Artic Char and the Tombo Tuna.  I found the scallops a little bitter and not to my liking.  To my surprise they offered us more dessert items than I expected - cheese AND truffles.  They're known for their underwhelming dessert menu however I have to say - those truffles were a perfect finish to my meal.  \n\nDefinitely a place to go for their happy hour specials and/or to come with a group to enjoy seafood tapas style.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-12", "description": "Went here for my boyfriend's Birthday last weekend.  He is a huge fan of anything raw and tartare, so I figured this would be the perfect spot.  I had never been to the old location, but everyone said this new location was quite a bit larger - the old space must have been tiny because I would definitely not describe the space as large.  Basically it is a narrow room with about 10 small tables (2-3 people), a bar, and a loft/balcony upstairs.  \n\nOur waitress was great, she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations for us.  My boyfriend had an oyster that he loved, and could not stop raving about the lobster heirloom tomato salad with beretta cheese.  This was a great recommendation - the boyfriend LOVED it, as did every other table (it was the only dish that I saw everyone else order).  There was no skimping on the lobster, I'm talking about huge chunks of claw meat on top of the salad.  \n\nWe also had the steak tartare - it was beautiful.  Four separate mounds of tartare with different toppings (horseradish creme fresh, quail egg, anchovy, pepper).   All served with grilled bread.  There was a definite citrus flavor on the meat and lots of fresh herbs.  \n\nThe last stand out dish was the bowl of chowder.  I am not always a fan of chowder because so many times it just tastes creamy with no other flavor.  How to make a chowder better you ask?  Well, how do you make anything better?  Add bacon.  This chowder was infused with chunks of smoky, salty, porky bacon.  It was also filled with fish, clams, calamari, muscles, shrimp, and potato.  I would really describe this dish as more of a collection of seafood in a bacon cream sauce, but no matter what you call it - it was delicious.  \n\nBar Crudo has a short menu, but a fairly extensive beer and wine list.  Food is small plates, so you will need 5-6 dishes to get two people full.  Lots of cooked food for friends/family that cannot eat raw - but don't take a vegetarian here, I am not sure there is anything on the menu for veggies.  A bit spendy and I can't say I was totally full, but I did not leave hungry either.  Great for an occasion, but I am not sure I would return without something to celebrate.", "author": "Dana H."}

I hope they don't rest on their reserve fund of positive Yelp! reviews and are able to take it to the next level.\n\nThat said, this place is madly off in all directions.  It has the aesthetic and pretension to pique curiosity and pack its tables on the daily, but if it really wants to be great, it needs to find focus: cut down the menu, remove 2-3 high-concept ingredients per item, step up the service, and tighten up the wine list.  Given the vogueishness of SF restaurant faves, there's little incentive for it to do so, but until it does, it will never cross the threshold from \"good\" to \"great.\"\n\nI can sum it up by telling you that one of the least high-concept items -- the mache, heirloom tomato and lobster salad, served with a mozzarella bordering on burrata -- was the best.  They did the simple things well, serving up a competent oyster selection, and a delicious steak tartare with interesting toppings (e.g., anchovy, pickled pepper).  The edgier stuff, though, didn't really come together.  I'm thinking of the \"bites\" constructed of 6-7 ingredients with ambitious and cross-cutting flavors.  To pull this off, the proportions have to be atomically precise, and, sorry to say, it didn't happen.  Either one flavor (e.g., horseradish) hid all the rest, or they all blended into an unidentifiable and not necessarily pleasant whole.  As I said to my partner: \"These are cubes of confusion.\"\n\nService was OK.  The ma\u00eetre d' had her standard San Francisco \"I'm-too-busy-doing-great-cuisine-to-pay-attention-to-you\" schtick down cold.  We arrived early for our reservation, and were told to wait.  Um, where?  You mean, right over here?  In the narrow corridor between the wall and the bar?  Directly in traffic?  For fifteen minutes?  Without you offering to get us a glass of wine?  The waitress could charitably be described as \"discreet\" and less charitably as \"invisible.\"  The wine was unmemorable and overpriced.

Never let me down and I always felt I got a steal of a deal with the quality and freshness of their shellfish. \n\nI was really excited to try out the new spot but parking's a biatch in NOPA so that's what took me so long. Last Friday a few girlfriends and I rushed over for the $1 oyster happy hour intending to stay through to dinner. We started off with 2 dozen oysters. Not only were they butchered (stomachs missing, some pieces cut into two), but there were MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SHELL in every oyster. \n\nOk, I know it's $1 oysters so you can't be too picky, but GOOD LORD even a blind man could shuck better than this!!!!!\n\nSo, we did what any oyster lover would do... we ordered 2 more dozen and informed our server there were shells in the last batch (i.e. put a real shucker on the line, lady!). \n\nRound 2: EVEN MORE SHELLS, CUT UP OYSTERS, OYSTERS SO SMALL THEY WERE HARDLY VISIBLE IN THE SUPER DIM LIGHTING!\n\nDesperate to get the bad taste of shell out of our mouths, we ordered more wine and a couple more dishes. They were fine, so no complaints there.... we did however get the wrong bill sent to our table in the end and no apologies about the shells.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "I would probably give Bar Crudo 4.5 stars, if that were an option.   We ate most of the menu, and everything was really delicious.  The food was completely on point.  \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster samplers, which was really fun.  Usually when I get a plate of oysters, I can't tell much of a difference, but this was totally different.  Most of our table enjoyed the Kusshi's the most because they were so silky smooth.  \n\nThen, we ordered a bunch of the raw dishes.  We got the Kona Kampachi, which was my personal favorite.  I loved the pairing with peaches, and the avocado mousse went nicely with everything to tie it together.  We also got the butterfish, scallops, and the fluke.  All of the flavors were totally different, which made everything seem like a great tasting menu. \n\nWe got the lobster tomato salad with burrata, which was so delicious.  To be fair though, I love anything with burrata.  We also got the whole dungeness crab.  Here's where I think the service could have been a little bit better.  First of all, we got crab crackers to help us get the meat out, but it would have been really great if we also got a crab pick/scoop.  Using our regular fork was a little too unwieldy.  Plus, the busboy took away the butter before the whole table was done eating, so we requested more, but it took a little bit of time.  Also, at the end of the crab, it would have been really nice to get some wipes or a finger bowl to clean our hands.  I mean, c'mon, we just ate a whole crab with our hands.  We did end up getting bread, but only after we asked for it after seeing it on other tables.  \n\nFinally, we got to the hot portion of the meal:  devil prawns, scallops in coconut curry sauce, and the seafood chowder.  Due to the bacon flavor and overall depth of the chowder sauce, I believe I told the table if I spilled some of the broth on my arm, I would most likely go Donner party on myself. \n\nOverall, since we were eating some great quality seafood, and our table went a little crazy with the booze, I knew the bill would be on the more expensive side.  I have to say I felt like this restaurant totally deserved it though, because the food we had really was quite commendable.  I am not the type of person who eats a ton of fish outside of sushi, and the variety and interesting mix of flavors on this menu were able to keep me totally engaged throughout.  \n\nMy one last comment on this place though was they didn't have anything to offer for dessert, which was disappointing.  I mean, not even a sorbet, or fruit, or any other small sweet bite at the end of the meal?  Nope.", "author": "Julie B."}

The atmosphere was interesting, the jellyfish lanterns F--- MY TOOTH AHHHHHH hold on ...\n\nugh. ok here's an aside. if you ever have a extremely painful toothache, call your dentist! or even call them before it gets to this point. i knew i needed to see the dentist 3 months ago and now i'm paying for it. i don't want to go into detail, but if you want to know i explained it in this review for tartine bakery:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/tartine-bakery-san-francisco#hrid:DP3WGfgIFK-cDsO2hB_5Sg \n\n(that's not a shameless plug, i'm just kinda lazy to explain it all again)\n\nANYWAYS, back to Bar Crudo. ok, so the jellyfish lanterns were cool, the two paintings were also interesting -- i heard it was from a local artist -- but one of them were slightly crooked.\n\nWe decided on the Large Seafood platter: half crab, half lobster, shrimps, clams, mussels and oysters.\n\nHm. Here's the order of best to alright:\nOysters, Lobster, Mussels, Crab, Clams, Shrimp\n\nI loved the sauces that were provided. I even asked for a cup of the hot butter to dunk my bread in (classy yes, I know). Paula Dean would've been proud.\n\nNext we had the crudo sampler. \nOf the Arctic Char, Butterfish, Yellowtail, and something else with Uni on top (this was truly unmemorable as my memory shows) only the Artic Char was truly outstanding and what I had been expecting. The wasabi might be a wicked surprise for those who aren't used to it, but even then it really made a strong impact and helped the rest of the flavors and textures on the Artic Char work.\n\nThen the chowder. YES. One of the best chowder's I've ever had. Hog Island Oyster Company's chowder is up there too (though it's a slightly different type of chowder).\n\nThe beer selection is great.\nThe wine selection is decent. \n\nOverall Bar Crudo is good, almost great but not amazing -- it's definitely worth at least one visit if only for the Artic Char and Seafood Chowder (Not sure if I'd fly up to SF for it, yet alone a Bart Ride (I'm typing in parentheses so that my sister won't be able to read that, of course) ).", "author": "Charles T."}

Hamachi, new potatoes, calamari, shrimp, bacon, cream and what I suspect may have been crack. Could. not. stop. eating. it.  Truly, the only excuse a person might have for not experiencing this creamy, dreamy bowl of delicate seafood delights is a severe seafood allergy, and even then I'm not so sure. It is a white chowder, but exceedingly light in texture. Not the goopy slop of bread bowl fame. It's just perfect. I can't wait to go back and try more of the fresh fish I saw coming out of the kitchen. We also partook of the oysters (fresh & well shucked), marinated mussels (YUM, 2nd favorite of the evening) and steamed clams (spicy YUM).

Just to let you know, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there. (makes sense, because it gets crowded quick).  We wanted to try everything, so we got everything on the Happy Hour menu. The soup was mediocre. Tasted like straight bacon, and the pork in it seemed a little dry. One of the tacos we got was burnt, so i didn't enjoy the bitter taste it had. The MUST trys are the clams, mussels and raw oysters.  I gave it a 3 stars instead of 4 is because of the service. I thought the two lady servers were a little rude. Weren't friendly at all.

Adore the lobster and fresh mozzarella salad-- the fresh cheese is like cream nestled against firm, sweet lobster meat. Had their crab legs, too -- awesome, such sweet, delicious, NOT over-cooked (as happens so easily and so often with crab meat).

As many suggested, we went during Happy Hour and ordered a number of items both from that menu as well as from their regular menu.  What we both enjoyed was the crudo sampler for 2.  My favorite from both weeks was the butterfish, so rich and full or flavor.  I also thought the seafood chowder was delicious both weeks and included a wide variety of seafood that is hard to beat at $5 a cup (HH price).  From the 1st week, I also loved the uni toast, with the perfect amount of very fresh sea urchin on the bread.  The dozen HH oysters were very good each time but quite tiny.  So we'll probably skip that the next time we go.  The HH red wine is very drinkable at $5 a glass.  The lobster beet salad that we ordered on the 2nd visit was a mixed bag for me.  I thought the lobster meat was overcooked but the beets were perfect.  My partner, however, thought it was just right.  So I guess it's a mild recommendation for the dish.  \n\nThis location is definitely an improvement from their previous one on top of the Stockton tunnel.  The servers are friendly and efficient.

I met up with some good friends tonight for a quick bite at Bar Crudo and all i can say is the seafood chowder might be the new choice for my last meal on earth. Sorry mom!  The silky cream broth is flavored with applewood smoked bacon, mussels, shrimp, squid, and fresh fish to order with a well balanced ratio of potatoes.  It is perfectly seasoned and will redefine chowder as you know it.  Have you ever fantasized about sitting in a champagne filled hot-tub surrounded by attractive, naked models?  New fantasy: sitting in a hot-tub filled with Bar Crudo's seafood chowder surrounded by large soup spoons (naked models & bread optional).  Oh, and don't even bother with the small bowl - do yourself a favor and order the large bowl to avoid any regrets.\n\nI also tried the crudo sampler and it was ridiculous.  The fish was VERY fresh and each sample was quite different from one another.  Excellent flavor and texture contrasts in each bite but the arctic char was definitely the star which I'll order by itself next time.

This is why it was bad:\n\nI was in the mood for a light white wine and decided to order the pinot grigio (pinot grigio gets a bad rap by snobby critics but that's another review entirely). I swear it was a chardonnay they were trying to pass off as pinot grigio - the buttery oak lingered in my mouth like a bad Napa chardonnay. Horrible. Bar Crudo, please double check your labels next time.\n\nNext, we (as in my partner and two friends) ordered a dozen oysters and the clam chowder. The oysters were not fresh - they tasted like they had been shucked the week before, frozen and defrosted. Not ok to serve to the public. For the same price, go to B Bar's happy hour and order 4 different types of oysters that are freshly delivered and shucked that day.\n\nThe clam chowder, on the other hand, was ok. My big disappointment was that there was bacon in it and as a bacon hater that would have been nice to know (I don't understand the bacon craze, again another review). It was not a traditional chowder; it had chili pepper that gave it a nice spice and an orange-red hue. The gf was not impressed - where was the New-England style chowda we were expecting? \n\nAfter 1.5 hours of major disappointment, we left feeling less than satisfied with the meal. I ended up going to Nickie's after for some awesome mac 'n cheese. \n\nWill I go back to Bar Crudo? Perhaps for dinner.

With or without beets, this dish is one of the best cold seafood dishes I have had. Simply amazing.\n\nFor entrees we had the Idaho Trout (me) and the linguine with clam sauce (her).

Looked at Bar Crudo next door and figured we would stop for a bite. It's one of those places that had always been on our mind for the past two years, having gone to the fundraiser benefit they held when several staff members had been severely injured in a car accident. The huge crowds that day and outpouring of love and support for this tiny little place spoke volumes both of the staff and their food. \n\nFinally here at the right area and time, the long planned \"bite\" quickly became a full 3-digit $$$ meal. \n\nReservations are strongly recommended. A scattering of seats are at the bar are downstairs and a handful of tables on the second floor. On top of that, they are only open for dinner. \n\nNow I've never been a fan of seafood restaurants because most of them slather things in butter, fry them, or drench them in cream. But not this place. This place manages to take both fresh and raw fish into a world I didn't know existed. Each bite better than the next, we couldn't stop at just one. \n\nThe \"crudo\" are but small bites, sampler of 8 (2 of each) sashimi-size pieces ($22) isn't cheap but the best way to tour around their menu if you're a small party. The labor-intensive prep involved with each order and the surprisingly potent accents like caviar, wasabi tobiko, pomegranate seeds, and thin sliver of grilled meyer lemon made for a spectacular and unique flavor experience. Their Seafood Chowder ($13) is a good use of fish trimmings and has a thick tasty creamy texture second only to \"Fisherman's Grotto\" in Monterey. Large scallops were cooked perfectly, three lined to a plate, each atop a small spooned mound of celery root puree and topped with microgreens and a hearty meat-like flavored sauce. The Lobster and Beet Salad ($15) was a wonderful combination of fresh lobster pieces, sweet little beets, and crunchy pistachio bits. Light and refreshing. \n\nI only had three disappointments: \n\n1) The Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes ($12 for 4 pieces). Good size chunks for the value but the sriracha/sesame oil marinade was off. \n\n2) My stomach just could not take another bite. \n\n3) It's top ramen for the rest of the week because my budget just went bye-bye. \n.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

It was slightly spicy with a little sesame flavor.\n\nLobster salad: Wow, I did not want this salad to end. Truly amazing. The combination of the greens, burrata (a sort of gooey version of mozzarella), the tomatoes, and lobster was one of the most pleasant texture experiences I've ever had.\n\nSeafood chowder: Another incredible and memorable dish. The soup is FULL of seafood, no skimping. It's very rich and creamy, almost like a dessert\n\nScallops: Also delicious. I love scallops and must order them if I see them on a menu.

The chowder was so good and they served bread with it for dipping. The bf loved the salad. The third course were cooked entrees, monkfish and hawaiian uno i believe. These were both  good as well.

From the very first plate we were taken from Bar Crudo for a stroll along the brisk and misty shores of New Brunswick while slurping delicious and succulent oysters from the half-shell. Falling back into our chairs we smiled with content, yet eager for more as a thinly sliced poached octopus salad had us leaning back in.\n\nWe then ordered their crudo sampler and traveled clockwise around the plate, sailing the four corners of the globe as each bite into our fresh crudo sampler built with intensity and flavor. Another round of drinks led us to our next dish, where we found ourselves afloat somewhere between the banks of the Louisiana bayou and South America. Large devil prawns in a sea of aromatic spicy broth with charred whole green chilies captured our senses. With great fervor we sucked out the juicy goodness from their heads and peeled away their shells to finish off the rest.\n\nWe turned and followed the current north as a cup of their seafood stew arrived at our table. Rich, creamy, with a hint of spice, smoke and generous amounts of fish, mussels and calamari, the stew warmed our spirits as we headed for the pacific northwest. There we savored fresh and delicate Washington coast oysters slipping from their shells as the he last of our drinks disappeared.  \n\nWe leaned back and watched the San Francisco fog roll past the windows.

Plus this was a total last minute Sunday night drop-in for seafood so things will run out. The Head on Devil Prawns are a must!

Now here's where it gets complicated.  \n\nI had an ex ask me once on our first date whether my mother and aunts were fat to see what my FP (=fat potential) was.  He swears he never did, but it's my word against his and I always win.  I said, look, 1 woman out of those 5 is obese.  So what's it gonna be, you willing to roll the dice with me?  ARE YOU A BETTING MAN?!  (Of course, he couldn't resist).  Anyway, my point was...\n\nYES I GET FAT EASILY - LOOK AT MY PROFILE PICTURES.  Devilish little donuts?  Tipping see-saws?  Ahem.  Which brings me to MY LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH YELP.  (Kidding Nish, heh!).

I can't wait.\n\nBut until that fateful day, you might find me at Bar Crudo because it is the perfect spot for someone either with the appetite of a hummingbird or very deep pockets.

For what I consider to be a rather nice place to dine, Crudo somehow fell short of providing a high quality of flavor and an array of creativity when presenting their dishes. I'll begin on a high note, because there were a couple of aspects of Bar Crudo that I enjoyed. First, the service was kind and all in all attentive. Second, the beer and wine selections are great, and I had fun trying to decide what I wanted. And in the end, all three of the beers I tasted were delicious. Finally, the selection of oysters are phenomenal.\n\nNow, Bar Crudo is loud, like amazingly loud. This is a trend in many restaurants, but it's something that I personally have a hard time dealing with. I was able to carry on a conversation, so it wasn't detrimental, but it was still distracting. They overcooked their scallops, which is unacceptable in a restaurant the caliber of which Crudo is claiming to be. And the \"coconut curry\", which turned out to be a lackluster version of Thom Ka, while tasty, ended up being the sauce for two separate dishes on the menu. Lastly, the Seafood Chowder, which everyone raves about, was the saltiest, most bacon-heavy liquid in a bowl I have ever experienced. \n\nSo Crudo, baby, it looks like we won't meet again, but thanks for indulging me, and thanks for amazing oysters and beer.", "author": "Shannon F."}

I also feel, in light of the really lovely note, that I should mention that many people whose opinions I respect (including veteran service industry folk) really love this place so I'm betting our first night was anomalous.  Stay tuned, bunnies. \r\n\r\n\r\n2/2 Original review: \r\n\r\nI wanted to love you.   \r\n\r\nIn the words of Prince, \"why you wanna treat me so bad?\". \r\n\r\nReservation:  6:30pm \r\nOut the door after bringing the check to the server:  8:45pm (!!) \r\n\r\nWe watched other tables sit, be served and leave before we got our second course.  We had to ask for bread, for water, for a wine bucket to chill our wine (there were only two of us - we can't drink that fast - well, we can but we were trying to be grown ups).   \r\n\r\nThe final straw was getting the seafood chowder with ONE bowl and two spoons after we asked to share it for our last course. I mean...are we doing this now?  In what universe is okay to have two people slurping out of the same bowl? \r\n\r\nNice server - knowledgeable about the wine and menu she just completely neglected us.  Why would it take nearly 2 1/2 hours to have a three course raw meal (excepting the soup)?  I've had shorter dinners at Fleur de Lys.\"", "author": "Mokirobinson M."}

I have been at least 3 plus times and I don't have much to say that is negative as I have enjoyed every visit.  However, after my last visit, I now realize how much I am paying up for food there.  As an example, if you have their sampler, it is 6 very small pieces for $25.  At my favorite sushi spot, I would receive 3x the portion for the same price.  Yes, the sampler is providing a little more than just sashimi, but the pricing doesn't equate to what you are getting.  You could get two deluxe rolls for the same price at other very good sushi spots. If I didn't have other locations to compare Bar Crudo to, they would get a much higher rating, but SF offers too many options to skimp with small portions when serving customers", "author": "Markus S."}

From the outside this place looks, cozy, cool, warm, and special.  You walk inside and yes indeed, the place is cozy, cool, warm, and feels special.  The interior space is very small but they did a good job of using color and maximizing space to open it up a little.  The main dining area is upstairs in what could even pass as a friends home.  The space is tiny and has only a handful of tables.  They could have fit a few more tables in the dining area if they wanted but thankfully they did not.\r\n\r\nThe People:   The minute we walked in (on time) the host acted like a friend waiting for a guest to arrive at their home.  He was friendly and personable.  We were taken straight to our table which means no waiting, everything was ready for us.  Our table server was incredibly cool, and patient with us.  We had a ton of questions about ordering and ingredients and she was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We were never rushed either which is nice.  There was always someone around and the service was neither neglectful or overbearing. . .just right.\r\n\r\nThe Food:  Holy mother of taste, bite, crazy, melt in your mouth flavor extravaganza!  The food is insane!  Everything ordered was excellent.  Lobster salad, San Sebastian plate, steak crudo, yellow fin crudo special, some other crudo with watermelon, chowder (amazing smokey flavor!), 1/2 lobster and crab. . .I can't wait to return to try more of the menu.  Everyone was impressed with everything placed on the table.  Even the bread was nice.

You walk in and quickly feel cramped, but it's almost comfortable. The feeling is reminiscent of a traditional no nonsense sushi bar, but it's not Japanese.

What exactly is a Raw Bar and where did it originate from?\n\nWhatever a raw bar is, a picture of Bar Crudo and its inventive, beautiful dishes should accompany its dictionary... err... wikipedia entry. Every bite I had was fresh and had great flavor, two essential elements when you're consuming raw seafood. A great compliment to the fare is the immense selection of wine and beers. And when I say beers they not only have your run of the mill American beers, but also a selection of imported beers you don't usually see.

There are also cooked items for those who want to see what it's about, but can't get over the raw idea. I was sad the last time I went there that the hamachi collar was no more.

Sure, I have tried oysters (not really my thing- but how can you blame me, being from the Midwest?), and those are presented not really in a Latin or Japanese fashion- but for the most part- raw fish was always something that I would have only at those two types of places.\n\nNow- I simply have to think back to that cold August evening when I went with my fiance (now wife) to try this place out to remember how limited my food experiences have been.  It was eyeopening, and almost maddening for me to realize that such wonderfully creative presentations can be done- but only with the finest and freshest fish and shell fish around.  It was a wonderful, and yet frustrating experience- realizing that living in Chicago limits me to this type of food that I really love and now consider to be one of the best ways of presenting raw seafood.\n\nCrudo being the Italian word for raw, we somewhat expected things to be presented with that type of background.  I guess one could interpret it that way a bit- but only in the sense that truly great Italian cooks will only use things that are fresh, accessibly local, and in season- and Bar Crudo does this.  The chefs allowing the ingredients to sing for themselves, without manipulating the flavors through various cooking methods is a terrific way of experiencing the freshness and liveliness of such high quality ingredients.\n\nTo top off the crudo experience (in which we shared quite a few oysters as well ad the Crudo Sampler), we had ordered one of their hot dishes- in which we got grilled jaw/cheek of something (tuna maybe) and this too was wonderfully flavored, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience.  Be forewarned now though, with the space of the restaurant being quite small, feeling cramped even, you will want to be sure to get reservations when you plan on going.

If you have fresh shellfish, you can never be disappointed.  The sauces that came with it were average: clarified butter, a mignonette, and cocktail sauce.\n\nThe Crudo Platter was where I was extremely disappointed.  I love raw fish.

At Bar Crudo though, the chef douses each slice of fish in so much overwhelming flavor that you taste nothing but lemon zest, wasabi or vanilla salt.  This portion of the dinner was what I was most looking forward to, and because it was so disappointing, it overwhelmed the entire dining experience.\n\nThe Seafood Chowder was the best thing we ate.

Something about being small, being sexy, being (somehow) secret--and having neither space nor seconds to throw SF's vegetarians a bone.\n\nMost recently I sat at the bar alone, between two young German men working their way through two thirds of the short but sweet menu, and a blonde who was performing for the couple that formed her dining companion.  I ate perfect lobster with burrata and the San Sebastian, a dish that tastes like Spain as I wish it was.  You can sit alone at Bar Crudo:  you will not be bored, you will not be lonely.\n\nBut sitting with someone else is ideal.  I've both rejected and been rejected by women I took to Bar Crudo:  in all cases it's been a high point, in no cases were the regrets over food, service, or decor. Once I even came back after dropping her off, to drown my sorrows in beer and salted fish. Maybe it's because Bar Crudo exemplifies so many human virtues:  economy (a small menu from a smaller kitchen, every item quietly excellent), warmth (the lovely staff, front and back of house) persistence (recovery from a car crash that injured half their staff), precision (delicate yet effective salting, cucumbers in the water, timely seating in such a small space).  \n\nI won't pretend to fully understand the magic that Bar Crudo creates:  suffice to say it sets a high bar.

But this was not the case at all. The salmon was SO bland and I was very disappointed. And since I don't really care for horseradish, I took half a bite with and without. The second bite I placed some of the wasabi tobiko on the salmon, but the tobiko was too wasabi flavored. I honestly did not see what the big deal about this platter and at $24 for 8 pieces, I would probably pass.\n\nThe Seared Hokkaido Scallop dish was ok. Nothing great or bad about the dish. It tastes like something I've had before though, but the microgreens overpowered the taste of the whole dish so if you get this, you might want to opt out of eating those.\n\nThe best dish was surprisingly the Seafood Chowder.

I'm glad I did because this is a place where one could have the \"menu problem\" or not know what or how much to order. I used to work at a tapas place in Thailand, and we always had people confused with the concept. Our plates were tiny and usually about 5-7 bites. People would not understand, so they'd order one dish thinking that each was an entree. A typical conversation with a customer at Papa's Tapas would go something like this:\n\nCustomer: \"I'd like the chicken wrapped in banana leaves.\"\nMe: \"Well, sir, all of our dishes are small plates. Depending upon your level of hunger, a party of 2 such as yourselves should order between 6-8 dishes.\"\nCustomer: \"Well, we're not all that hungry, so we'll also have the asparagus.\"\nMe: \"Yes, sir, like I said, two dishes will get you and your wife started but it will by no means fill you up.\"\nCustomer: \"We plan to have dessert as well.\"\nMe: *walks away shaking head*\n\nAnyway, back to Bar Crudo. I had a few truly memorable dishes that night, and although shellfish usually aren't really my bag, I did enjoy the oysters. The best dishes that I would definitely go back for were the Arctic Char, the Tombo Tuna, the San Sebastien, and the piece de resistance, the lick-the-sides-of-the-bowl-deliciously-good-and-yummy Seafood Chowder. There's bits of bacon in it! I was that customer who was being annoying and banging her spoon as she scraped it along the side of the bowl to get all the remaining bits. \n\nMy only complaint would be that it's small, and if you go late enough, and sit near the east side of the restaurant, you can hear the (questionable) music coming from Tunnel Top bar next door. But Bar Crudo is healthy, delicious, and the staff members are all very nice (be kind to them, they have to manipulate those stairs ALL NIGHT LONG).", "author": "Rachel F."}

My friend and I have been thinking about coming here for months and finally we got around to it.  So we came here last Thursday and had 8:30 reservations.....I didn't seated until 10pm.  (Note:This is not a place for more than a party of 2...max is 4).  We had a party of 3 and they only had 2 tables that would accomodate us...the party before us had paid their bill and sat there for early and hour and a half just talking.  Now if I wasn't so hungry...I definitely wouldn't have minded.  They are located right next to Tunnel Top....great pomegrate comos.  I had 2 of these while waiting for my table and ended up really buzzed.  \n\nOk so when we finally got seated I ordered the Crudo sampler which consist of Artic Char, Fluke, Scallop and Tombo Tuna. I asolutely loved it....very delicious.  I was surprised I ate the scallop...normally I am not too big on it but it was very sweet.  I also had the yellow tail....which I was not impressed....the seasalt....was too salty for me.  Next I had the dayboat scallop trio....and omg was that delish.  Served on a bed of potato and fennel puree....I was just on a roll with the scallops that night..  \n\nOk so here is the best part...well close enough to it.  Because I waited so long for my table...they gave us the lobster and beet salad on the house.  Those have got to be the sweetest tomatoes ever.  The lobster, beet and tomato together went very well.  Also they gave us seafood chowder on the house.  I really liked it..especially since it had applewood bacon in it...smelled and tasted great.  \n\nOverall I will come back....next time party of 2.  Also, I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of things that I wanted to try but it gives us a reason to come back.  There is also an awesome staff here.

Just the right  amount of creamy richness to make my taste buds snap to and give a standing ovation. I loved what I had so much, I can't remember what DH had, cuz I didn't want to share mine so I didn't ask for bites of his....is that awful? I don't care...it was really delicious! No dessert, except for cute Drew who brought me a truffle or two just because he's a lovely young man.  I thought for as fresh and tasty as this dinner was, it was very reasonably priced.  Treat yourself, and go....just ignore the hipster children...I'm certain they mean no harm :-)", "author": "Jenn J."}

I've been trying to get to Bar Crudo forever, but am seldom in the neighborhood. We were able to score a table for three after shuffling back and forth in front of the door for about 15 minutes. I was a little buzzed and checking out everybody's food, so I didn't mind too much. We were seated in the small mezzanine area upstairs and then tackled the menu.\n\nBar Crudo isn't cheap, nor should it be. I mean this is raw seafood after all. That being said, we also weren't in the mood to drop $200 on dinner that night. We agreed to try some of the crudos, the lobster and burrata salad (b/c I can rarely resist creamy fresh burrata), and a then finish with a seafood chowder, both for something warm and to fill any lingering appetites. \n\nWe tried the ono, tombo tuna, and yellowtail crudos. The entire table was alarmed by the overpowering pineapple vanilla vinaigrette that topped the tombo tuna.  Pristine fresh fish should not be drowned out by such strong flavors. When the manfriend tasted it first and remarked, \"This tastes like Lifesavers,\" I thought he was more buzzed than I had realized. Upon trying the tombo tuna myself, I could not believe the uncanny resemblance to pineapple lifesavers!\n\nThe crudos were all stunning to look at; each plated with tiny microgreens, light sprinklings of exotic ingredients, and bright splashes of sauces for color. Except for the pineapple misstep, the others were very much enjoyed. The lobster salad was also a posh treat. The grad student salary does not allow for frequent lobster consumption these days. It was even more enjoyable to have plump juicy chunks of lobster primed for my consumption without having to decorticate it myself. \n\nThe seafood chowder was everything I hoped for and very richly garnered all the prior praise from others' reviews. So velvety and so, so very delicious. I foresee myself sneaking away for a glass of cava, a dozen oysters, and an indulgent bowl this of chowder when I need a special treat. \n\nService was perhaps more casual than the artistry on the plates and prices dictated. However, after our wine and food arrived, we didn't really mind. 4 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

Ingenious seafood focused preparations with a wonderful balance of raw and cooked options.  Some land animals available as well, also cooked to perfection.  Atmosphere is sophisticated and sexy - cartoony mermaid caricatures decorate the walls, brushed steel table tops bounce conversations across the room and polished concrete floors add to a urban, industrial feel.\n\nFood highlights included bone marrow and toast, Bar Crudo sampler that included individually unique raw preparations of fluke, yellowtail, arctic char and ono.  Also, beer list is top notch.  Try something off the sour section and you will not be disappointed (Russian River Supplication is a must try if you haven't already).\n\nNote of caution - this place is not cheap.  It's the small plates kind of place where you end up ordering everything and spending good money.  My latest tab for two was $130 and that's only with four drinks.

Crudo, which means \"raw\" in Italian is sliced fresh fish with minimal extras. This place was such a treat!!! The restaurant itself was fairly small. But they seated us upstairs in what seemed like a charming hideaway....It felt like we were having dinner in someone's upstairs attic! I also couldn't help but notice how cool and casual our servers were, but extremely pleasant.\n\nMy friend and I ordered almost everything off their menu. The plates arrived to us small and perfect for sharing. Here's a summary of what we ordered:\n\nCrudo Sampler - Artic Char, Fluke, Scallops, and Tombo Tuna\n\nSpicy Yellow Fin Tuna Cubes with ginger soy, sriracha & green onions\n\nHawaiian Ono with lemongrass, citrus, chili, daikon and cilantro\n\nTuna Confit with asparagus, red peppers & caper berries\n\nMussels & Clams with garlic, chile & winter greens\n\nSeafood Chowder with mussels, shrimp, calamari, and smoked apple-wood bacon........a bowl of creamy goodness!\n\nOhhh and the butter fish!?! So fresh and almost sweet. It didn't even taste like I was eating fish. Mmmm mmmm\n\nBy the end of our meal, we were totally stuffed like a turkey on Thanksgiving day. We basically had $100 of raw food and wine in our tummies. My conclusion is: If you haven't been and you love crudo like I do, you HAVE to go!", "author": "Anne E."}

The cold and foggy night invites you to Bar Crudo to enjoy comforting seafood a la Crudo.  \n\nBar Crudo is quite small; actually very small; I accidentally go in the wrong door and went to the wrong establishment; I moved to the next door and I knew I was in the right place.\n\nI enjoyed a small tray of Rappahannock; sweet, salty, fresh and clean; the two serving sauces; a cocktail sauce and a peppery tart sauce.\n\nThe Crudo is king here; the Butterfish was quite fresh and was accompanied with preserved lemon--everso delicate; so delicate that you weren't sure what it was-- pleasantly so.  The Dayboat scallops served with Vichyssoise, chives and black zest.  It woudn't be Crudo without scallops; the plating is delicate, elegant.\n\nThe Lobster and Beet Salad should be considered; the Maine lobster is delightful and matches well with the beets; the earthiness of the beets laced with a dash of the Banyuls vinaigreet and Burrata cheese is a superb choice.\n\nGo for freshness, Bar Crudo is expert and is passionate for seafood; easy going yet professional service; a small and well-edited wine list.\n\nBuen Provecho!", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

We had high expectations for the food.  All in all, we walked away feeling dissatisfied.\n\nWe had crudo sampler $22 four types of dressed up raw fish - arctic char was delicious (wasabi tobiki made the flavor stand out); fluke and tombo tuna were completely forgettable (tuna was tasteless and the sauce/cream not complementary) ; scallop was mediocre at best (albeit quite fresh).  The pieces are way too big to be a good \"bite size\".  I think the crudo sampler pieces should be smaller with five or six different types instead of four.  \n\nThe chowder had way too much potatoes.  I don't know why restaurants are compelled to add so much potato to their chowder (well, it is cheaper) as the starch from the taters makes the chowder griddy and masks the flavor and texture of the delicate cooked seafood (in particular the scallops and fish).    \n\nThe mussels & Clams in the hot dish really could be more fresh.  The flavor of paprika was way too strong and I don't understand what, if anything, the big beans added to the dish.  \n\nI have never been a fan of sardines, but my friend gave me one of the two on her plate.  I have to admit, the flavors were quite good and the oil drizzled on top created an inviting aroma.  Still, I would prob not have ordered this dish on my own, as the strong pungent sardine really may be offensive to some. \n\nWe tried 5 diff types of raw oysters and raw clam and we loved it all.  We also loved the wines offered at the restaurant.  All in all, the place did not WOW me.  The prices are ok - not super expensive but definitely not inexpensive for this type of food, in my opinion.", "author": "Kathleen H."}

Seems like the beer list is better, but I didn't check it out.  Finally, I thought the service was outstanding (we ate at the bar downstairs).  From the hostess to the raw bar to the server, everyone was very nice! \n\nI know this sounds crazy, but as we walked back to our hotel recounting the meal- MY EYES STARTED TO TEAR UP! ! !  After spending almost 2 weeks in SF eating out every lunch and dinner this place brought tears to my eyes!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-14", "description": "A review of the Crudo Sampler from the best to almost best:\n\n* Dayboat Scallops - I seriously think these scallops were alive just 2 minutes before they were served to us.  This quality of freshness is prevalent with every dish at Bar Crudo!  The tiny pats of scallops were so rich and decadent... like butter but w/o the guilt of the calories.  I would easily enjoy 2x the portion here.\n\n* Rhode Island Fluke - Loved the sweet beets against the salty cavier.  Gave the somewhat bland fish some life.  Rather disappointed the horseradish did not have a stronger kick to it.  \n\n* Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Cubes - Like a high class Hawaiian Poke!  I would have enjoyed a bit more spice, but I can see it taking away from the high quality, deep red tuna.  Green onions added a wonderful compliment.\n\n* Tombo Tuna - Quite refreshing!  This part of the review will be lacking as it wasn't a very memorable sample.\n\nWe went surf 'n turf here and also got the Steak Crudo, a series of semi-raw steak topped with various tastes.  The poached egg should be popped so the meat could marinate in the yolk.  This is a classic tartare or steak and eggs froofy younger brother.  I loved the simplicity of the pipparas and beef... spicy sweet with fatty beef.  These tastes are made for each other.  All this served with toasted crutons to cut the richness.  And you know the bits of peppercress aren't just good garnish, they should be eaten with the beef and fish.  Think of it as a tiny salad.  \n\nA thoroughly great experience here.  Service was patient (we came just 30 minutes before closing) and very cordial.  He asked that we must come back for their seafood chowder... we shall.  Another fav of this restaurant are the jelly fish light fixtures.  If the art of taxidermy is impossible on marine life, think again... these gorgeous glass art pieces were a great likeness to the jellies.

The refreshing cold dishes are perfect for the summer, and the warm dishes are best to sooth the winter wind burns.\n\nThis place makes my salivating glands go in over drive with the fresh oysters from the best estuaries, Malpeque, Miyagi, Kumamoto, and Wellfleet. The crudo sampler is definitely the best way to try all the different ones accented with very fresh herbs, tobiko, and flavorful sauces. It is also a fun platter to deconstruct with a friend that shares. The arctic char crudo definitely won my heart! After taking in the tummy-warming chowder filled with abundant seafood, you will be ashamed you ever indulged in chowder in a sour dough bread bowl down by the pier. Everything else is just as wonderful, but the aforementioned are my highlights. I do however want to try the half crab and half lobster plate, which I have yet to find a friend willing to share with me (hint, hint).\n\nThe wines pair well with the seafood.

It's my favorite type of layout especially when the food speaks for itself. \n\nFood (4): A good selection of seafood with minimal meat items. They have a sashimi section on the menu with some good selections with the char and the fluke being the best. Surprisingly, the tuna was the most uninspiring. Some of the \"main\" items we tried were the steak crudo and the devil prawns. They were perfectly executed and with good flavors that mix different influences. I do like that the menu is limited; sometimes tapas joints flood you with choices. We also had a bottle of Alaia which was the first rioja I truly enjoy in a long time. Hmm, that might have made me enjoy the food as much as I did.\n\nService (3): The service was ok. There were some lapses of attention and I think we ended up pouring our wine the whole time and had to ask for water.\n\nValue (4): It's a little pricey, but the quality of the food is good and I haven't found another restaurant that does these dishes for cheaper, so what is truly expensive? The wine list was reasonably priced and overall, considering that we had a bottle of wine, two orders of the sashimi, two bigger dishes and I think soup, it was reasonable.\n\nOverall, I really like this place. I do like a tapas restaurant with more meat dishes and a stronger Spanish influence, but this place has a seafood tapas gimmick and so the menu makes sense.

I think Jeremy S. sums it up best in calling it \"a Western/California interpretation of sushi.\"\n\nLet me start out by saying I loved it.  The oysters were great.  \n\nThanks to the many yelp recommendations, we got the Crudo Sampler for two.  I think it's the best way to try out many different dishes to see what you like.  \n\nWe also got the special Yellow tail dish and the Arctic Char.  Both were delicious.  I love horseradish and wasabi so the Char was right up my alley.  \n\nWe split a bowl of the seafood chowder.  It's super rich, so sharing it was a good idea.  Otherwise, I would have been way too full and missed out on the Yellow Tail and Char for sure. \n\nIts very small and cozy.

The sampler was as fresh as ever, especially the artic char with wasabi flavored fish roe.  The lobster salad was delicious while the lobster meat was cooked just right.  The clam in lobster broth was one of the freshest and every one of them was similar in size and meaty.

This hip little hole in the wall gets packed quickly, especially because their $1 oyster happy hour runs from 500pm to 630pm.

Must haves on the HH menu are the seafood chowder which is packed full of fish chunks, muscles, shrimp and whatever seafood goodness they happen to add in,  the cod tacos are also very fresh and tasty.

This place is pretty hard to find if you're a passer-byer but is well worth it when you do... like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Don't worry, no leprechauns there.  The restaurant itself is, however, a squeeze.  The size doesn't do it justice.  I mean... the limited spacing would make anyone who's craving their delicious Hawaiian Ono mad!  The decor is easy on the eyes.  As you walk in it's hard not to notice the jelly fish installation hanging from the ceiling.  Makes for a great photo opp!  Love the mermaid logo and the paintings are just whimsical.  \n\nEnough about the place... on to the food!\n\nMy friend, Leslie who I'd gone with and had been to Bar Crudo before, and I ordered the following (WARNING: may make you salivate):\n\nCrudo for 2: Spicy Yellow fin Tuna cubes, Rhode Island Fluke, Day boat Scallops (which were so creamy!  fish creamy?

I was EXTREMELY happy about the lobster substitute).\n& last but not least.... their Hawaiian Ono!!!\n\nThey don't serve hard liquor, only beer and wine.  Their beer selection has most if not all of the Belgian beer greats.  I had the Chimay and it went just fine with what we ordered.  Mmmm... Chimay with seafood.  Try it!  That's dessert enough.  Speaking of... I'm not sure if they serve dessert.  \n\nAnyway.... Tim, our host, was super accommodating and our waitress was very knowledgeable on the seafood which we ordered.

There's a long and comfortable bar with a large and impressive installation of multi-colored metal disks filling the big white wall space behind.  All in all it's nicely done.\n\nSo why the drop in score?  The food isn't as good, the service is indifferent and there's something about the general atmosphere of the place that I don't like.  It was crowded the night that we went - I get the impression that it usually is, but the acoustic in the space makes it very noisy.  And noisy with the dreary musings of the too-cool-for-school crowd that it now seems to attract.\n\nThe service also seems to have refocused itself on cool - the various skinny jeans and piercings look hip, but the attention to detail is wanting.  It took forever to be seated at the bar, and once there both the wine and one of the courses were forgotten - annoying when you're placing your order within a couple of feet of the computer where the orders are placed.\n\nThe food is still very good - the ocean trout with horseradish cream and wasabi-infused roe is fabulous, but overall execution of the menu - which has hardly changed in the last two years, doesn't attain the same lofty heights as it used to.  \n\nStill worth a look, but the upgrade in premises doesn't make up for the downgrade in overall experience.", "author": "Dom B."}

The cozy sized room upstairs makes for a very romantic atmosphere while the downstairs bar area is a bit more upbeat.  Portions here are small, and the dishes are a bit pricey so be prepared to spend quite a bit of money to get full here.  \n\nI came here for an anniversary dinner the other night and had a lovely meal.  We started trying 2 of each oyster that was available and they were all types I had never tried before. The standout ones were the Olympia oysters from Washington and like the restaurant, packed a punch for their small size. We also ordered prawns which were cooked perfectly and delish.  The oysters were probably the best part of the meal, but mainly because I absolutely adore oysters and can eat several dozen in one sitting! \n\nWe ordered the crudo sampler which was great because it gave us a little bit of variety.  I really enjoyed the arctic char and the butterfish.  The monkfish liver mousse was very delicious as well.  The bread they served with it was grilled and added a great texture to compliment the fluffiness of the mousse.  Then we had the San Sebastian which was probably the largest portion out of all the dishes we ordered.  We ordered a few of the strong Belgian ales and felt quite tipsy by the end of the meal!

Let me be clear: This is the place for good food! \n\nEvery dish was absolutely amazing. If you like restaurants that understand presentation and how to use spices, this is the place. We started with a sit down at the bar while we were waiting for our friends to arrive. We wanted some raw food and tried the Crudo Sampler which consists of arctic char, scallops, butterfish and ono. The presentation was amazing and the dish was refreshing. What a brilliant dish.  We noticed that everyone was trying the seafood chowder so we ordered four cups at dinner. Trust me, have the seafood chowder but don't make the mistake that we did. Don't get cups get bowls. We also ordered the swordfish. Folks, I have no idea how they make the swordfish but it is amazing. The outside was not blackened but tasted that way and the inside was moist. It was terrific. We also had the \"head-on Louisiana prawns. This is a must. Make sure that you have bread on hand to sop up the juice. It is spicy but sneaky spicy. After about a minute the spice will sneak up on you and probably prompt you to say \"man, that's pretty good sauce!\"\n \nThe restaurant also has great service. It just seemed like everyone was working hard. We were lucky enough to draw Jennifer as a waitress. Jennifer was amazing. She is a little bitty pretty lady with a huge smile, great sense of humor and real attention to detail. When my wine glass hit bottom, it didn't stay there long. When we looked at the menu she offered suggestions. I do not know Jennifer but I can describe her pretty easily. She is the kind of person that you meet and within five minutes everyone at your table comments that she appears to just be a nice person.  When I return I am asking for Jennifer.\n\nIf you go to Bar Crudo go early because parking can be challenging but I can tell you.

I wanted to try everything, hot, cold, shell, no shell, Crudo give it to me.  Getting as much variety from the menu as my little pot belly could hold, I thought I might max out the weight limit for that tiny balcony they call a second floor \"dining area\". All in all, it was a great meal.  Some of the dishes weren't as bedazzling as others - one dish was just a thrown together hodge podge of tuna, peppers, olives, aspargus, and bread (Ok so what do I do with this? Build a sandwich?) - but I enjoyed everything.  And on a return visit I would undoubtedly be able to pick out 5 courses of pure winners.  The service was definitely slow and not entirely attentive, but it's nice to have a slow meal rather than being rushed out the door.  \n\nFortunately I've saved the best for last.  The chowder.

The oysters weren't very good, but I enjoyed the rest of our dishes.

The mignonette was very nice, and the oysters were good.  I especially liked the Kusshi and my wife liked the Effington.\n\nWe each ordered the raw sampler.  The fish really didn't stand out in any of these items.  They were 'precious' and *seemed* interesting, but I didn't really find anything here that was greater than the sum of it's parts.\n\nWe moved on to the Lobster and Heirloom Tomato salad and the Chowder.  The salad was underwhelming primarily because the tomatoes were so average.  I'll take their word for it that they were heirloom tomatoes, because they didn't taste very heirloomy.\n\nThe chowder was very good - nice flavor and lots of nice meaty chunks of fish.\n\nWe ended the meal with the cheese plate.  The cheeses were fine, but there wasn't enough bread, fruit or honey.  We asked for more of the table bread and an extra ramekin of honey, so it wasn't a 'disaster', but I was disappointed by the initial lack of honey.  As originally presented, it was really only a garnish - a slight drizzle.  Likewise, there were five or six extremely thin slices of apple - it seemed like they were trying to make one apple last all night long.\n\nThe service was good - she really took a lot of time to answer our questions, let us keep ordering item by item, provided a lot of assistance with the beer selection, and noticed that our table was a little wobbly and worked on correcting that a few times.\n\nUltimately, we weren't really wowed by anything.

The wine list is pretty awesome. The beer on tap looks good, too. I had a very nice French chardonnay which complemented the food well. We tried the Steak Crudo, which was excellent, the sampler platter w/Arctic Char, Butterfish, Scallops, and something else I can't remember, and the Hamachi Collar. Everything was very good and super fresh. The garnishes and flavor/texture combinations on the sampler platter were fantastic. I was so surprised and elated to see Hamachi Collar on the menu and it lived up to my expectations - really crispy skin, flavorful, served on top of some awesome chard and white bean goodness. \n\nMaybe my expectations were low, as this was an unintentional, serendipitous find in my neighborhood, but I was very happy with my first Bar Crudo encounter and will return!", "author": "Lindsay M."}

Because right now I'm feeling a little physically overwhelmed from the insides actually, and not in a good way. I think that the seafood chowder was probably a bit much. From the looks on our host/server's face, I knew I had probably ordered a little too much food for the both of us.\n\nNew Brunswick & Rappahannock oysters (2 each) - I didn't have any of these because I'm not a fan to begin with, and the colors were darker than I'm used to. But my mate said it was alright.\n\nCrudo Sampler :\nDayboat Scallops - they were good, fresh and sweet.\nArtic Char - we both agreed that this was the most amazing thing of the night. everything that went along with it was PERFECT. \nButterfish - this was very good too. Butterfish as usual, is very smooth and soft.\nTombo Tuna - the tuna itself was alright but I really liked the crunchy topping on top of it (whatever it was).\n\nLobster Tomato Salad - pretty good, but parts of it was a little overwhelming, but nonetheless delicious.\n\nManila Clams - this was a hot dish, but this was probably the least special dish out of the whole night.\n\nSeafood Chowder - 2 bowls (not a smart idea). I liked the shrimp in it and the sausage (smoked bacon), but I didn't like the fish, squid and mussels. The soup base was good, but too milky/creamy. I think its making me feel a little uneasy now.\n\nBasically, the crudo sampler was amazing, with the artic char being my favorite. The lobster salad was good, but I might or might not order that again. I'll lay off the clam chowder and manila clams next time (both hot dishes). On the full-o-meter, I was about a 8, which is very, very good. A 9 or 10 would definitely mean overly, cannot walk full. Without alcohol and before tip, the bull came out to about $100 for 2. \n\nThis place is tiny, but there is an upper level where we sat. I would say the max capacity is.. 30 people MAX!!! So call in or go on Open Table to make reservations. The upstairs is quiet nice actually, with a view on downtown/nob hill traffic.\n\nService was decent. Our server/host was nice. But since she was probably host & server, she was a bit busy to keep our water glasses continuously filled.\n\nI give this place a 3.5 stars for the way I'm feeling right now.

Before the chowder, we were actually debating what else to order -that's how rich the chowder was...so make sure to save room for it if you want to try it.  \n\nWith the meal, we had a bottle of the Chateau Vignot Cabernet Franc and it was the perfect pairing of our dinner.\n\nI look forward to returning soon, very soon.", "author": "Gloria H."}

Cute little (and boy do i mean little) restaurant. The seafood bar/kitchen is open for all to see.  \n\nWe were seated at the mezzanine (which a lot of people recommend) which gave our special dinner and nice cozy feel. It would have been perfect if it wasn't for the two tables of annoying people who just would not shut up.  Duude...you can totally see that the restaurant is small, and that the rest of the tables are seated with couples who obviously want some quality together time...you could have the common decency to shut the hell up. I was like extremely extremely close to saying \"shut up bitches!\" but held back for my hubby's sake.\n\nAnyways onto the food. We got the Crudo Sampler- RI fluke (w/ fennel, cara cara orange, arbequina olives), arctic char(w/ horseradish, wasabi, tobiko, dill), scallop (w/vichyssoise, black caviar, chives, lemon zest) and tombo tuna (w/ lobster cream, vanilla salt, watermelon radish, licorice greens). I loved the arctic char the best. The toppings complimented the raw fish perfectly. Raw scallops however was oh so NOT good. Its not Bar Crudo's fault...I just think in general that scallops were not meant to be raw. They have this really funky milky texture that just makes me want to hurl.\n\nNext we had the Small Seafood Platter- oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, half crab and half lobster...with 4 dipping sauces.  All yummy. \n\nBut the best part of the dinner was the seafood chowder. It was just a bowl of yummy goodness.

The oysters are amazing, and the crudo sampler was very tasty. The halibut was a little bland but the other three were just perfect. The steak crudo is great, especially the one topped with quail egg. \n\nThey have an amazing selection of belgian beers, which I mean to sample the next time I go (we had wine--a nice pinot grigio). Definitely get a reservation rather than eating at the bar, since the upstairs room is very cute and cozy, though it was a bit loud before people started going their separate ways.", "author": "Jesse E."}

Determined to try all restaurants that have made the cut, I've been to 31 so far.  But, the experience has not felt complete... something is missing.  My mid-year resolution: add a final Yelp step to the process.  Bar Crudo is my first.\n\nI was solo tonight, and lucky me there was a single seat at the bar which was not reserved.  I love sitting at an oyster or sushi bar, right in the middle of the action, and I like it even more if the people behind the bar serve booze.  As I people-watched, I noticed that I seemed to be the only person without a reservation, which was a surprise to me considering it was a Monday night at 6 pm.  I bet this place gets crudo crazy later in the week.\n\nThe wine list was fairly unimpressive, although the beer selection was crudonculous.  I opted for the only Pinot (Noir in this review and all others) on the menu, which came in a bottle that had a cap instead of a cork.  I'll never get used to that; I don't care how \"green\" it is.\n\nI decided to start with the Crudo sampler appetizer.  I'm pretty sure that I was the first person who put an order in for the evening, however, the wait time was way too long.  Maybe not that long in crudo minutes, but certainly long in normal appetizer minutes.  It's ok though, because while I am waiting, I get to witness the spectrum of skill level in oyster shucking.  First guy, coulda done it blindfolded.  Second guy, I coulda used a blindfold, as I was certain this guy would slice his finger off before the dozenth oyster was open.\n\nI understood the wait time when the sampler arrived.  There were four kinds of crudo, each more delicate and intricate than the previous.  The one I was really excited about trying was the Hawaiian Ono, which had lemongrass, citrus, mint, chili, tobiko, and more on it.  I LOVE all of those things.  Did I love all those things together?  Not so much.  I expected some sort of crazy crudo chemical reaction in my mouth, which didn't happen.  Instead, it just tasted like a bunch of random ingredients thrown together for an experiment.  Very disappointing.  Thank goodness for the second crudo - the arctic char, which had just a few logical ingredients and was heaven.  In my industry, I'd recommend the KISS technique to the Crudoians.... Keep It Simple, Stupid; sometimes less is more.\n\nIt was cold outside, and there were only a couple of hot dishes on the menu.  I opted for a small seafood chowder, which was surprisingly large.  The first bite was beautiful, and I decided Bauer was onto something.  After the third bite, however, I was certain that I could replicate the chowder at home with a pint of cream and a few sticks of butter.  The chowder was so rich, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens (unless I'm on a first date.)\n\nLet me close with what I'd tell MB if he was interested in my Crudopinion:  Bauer, they're on to you.  They know who you are, and/or they know when you are coming.  I bet they have some \"special\" they offer you that is not on the menu when you're there, am I right?  There was no special for me tonight.  This place was good, but I'm not sure it was Top 100 good.  You ought to wear a disguise when you go back for the 2009 visit, or maybe send one of your prodigies.  By the way, are you taking applications for new prodigies??", "author": "Alana R."}

I must say this place did not disappoint.  We started with the oysters and the crudo sampler, moved on to the cold dishes (Lobster Salad and San Sebastian) and finally the hot dishes (Seafood chowder, the scallops and the trout.)\n\nCrudo - My favorite was the arctic char.  Very buttery and went well with the horseradish dressing.  The scallop and the butterfish were also very good. The salt on the scallop really helped bring out the flavor.  The kampachi was decent but I didn't eating the lime skin with the fish.  \n\nLobster Salad - Mirroring most of the other yelp reviews, the mixture between the lobster and the burratta was perfect.  I could have just had this dish for the whole meal.  \n\nSan Sebastian - The dressing they used worked really well with the tuna.  Kind of a vinegrette taste but very light.  The manchego and the broche went well with the fish as well.  The fish was a little dry but still had good flavors.  \n\nSeafood Chowder - Verrrrry rich!  I believe this is a chowder that needs to be shared.  After a few spoonfuls it becomes too much.  The seafood inside was cooked well though.  A lot of times seafood is overcooked in soups and is very dry but this chowder seemed to maintain the moisture very well.  \n\nScallops - The spicy sauce added a nice kick and really brought the flavors out.  I would have liked the scallops to be cooked a little less as I thought they were a bit overcooked but the flavors were still excellent.  \n\nTrout - We were initially not going to order this but our waitress highly recommended it.  I have never had trout that was so good before.  Very tender and very moist this dish could have been the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe service was decent.  The food came out a little slow but that wasn't such a big deal.  The place itself is a bit noisy and next time I will consider bringing ear plugs.  This place is a must try for all you seafood lovers.", "author": "Brent G."}

Didn't know this was available when we made the early reservation so nice surprise.\n\nFollowed with the 8pc crudo sampler.  The most memorable was the salmon topped w/a tiny bit of cream, green tobiko, and a micro sliver of dill.  Each piece was two yummy bites.  Next up was the lobster and beet salad.  The beets were delish!  Nice large chunks lightly dressed and dotted with pieces of lobster, pistachio nuts, and burrata cheese.  We then ordered our two hot dishes, the \"devil\" prawns and the seared scallops in a curry sauce.  They paired well together with the prawns having a pepper laden spicy sauce, and the curry smooth and creamy as a contrast.  Four large head-on prawns were really fresh tasting, and the perfect fodder for the addicting fiery sauce.  The scallops were good too, especially the curry which we sopped up with the bread.\n\nThe only \"dessert\" they offered was a cheese plate or chocolate truffles.

Right when you open the door, you see someone preparing the chilled seafood plates (jumbo prawn, oysters, clams, mussels) and it makes you hungry! And it makes you want order the prawn (although at $2 each)! \n\nThis is the kind of place you want to have either a good beer (which they have) or wine with your meal. Not necessarily a \"fancy\" place, it can go either way, and I would say fantastic for dates without being cheesy. It's cool. The food is delicious. There were two of us. We ordered 6 oysters (3 varieties though they had 6 or 7) and 6 shrimp to start and served with lemons, a mignonette and cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish. And we liked the ninigret oysters the best so we ordered half a dozen more! \n\nNext came the bar crudo sampler, two pieces of four varieties of fish, all raw. (We had Arctic Char, Fluke, Scallop and tombo tuna served with watermelon radish.) Then we also had the Yellowfin Tuna cubes in a sesame soy dressing. Not spectacular, but the fish was very good and fresh! Lastly, we had the seafood chowder to share, and that was a perfect end to the light meal. Shrimp, calamari, fish, mussel, smoked fish prepared in a buttery cream soup. No dessert.\n\nIt was delicious, but expensive. Very good when you want to splurge! Good alternative to sushi. Creative, fresh, delicious. Warm atmosphere. PS - I was advised by friends to get the sampler - there's a small and a large - the large will get you a whole dungeness crab and some lobster.

We also shared the lobster salad, which I found to be lacking in the lobster department and completely overpriced. We also got the crab, which was good but a huge pain in the butt since they don't crack it for you. \n\nTo be honest, this place isn't bad. But when you live in San Francisco, there's no reason to go back to a restaurant like this: it's overpriced, unduly pretentious, and underwhelming.

My friend and I were in town for a wedding and decided to give this place a try based on yelp reviews and their mentioning in a few oyster posts I had read.  The first day I had a reservation and they were packed upon arrival.  We were seated withing 5 minutes.  We had a few different varieties of oysters which was a treat for a few guys only accustomed to gulf coast oysters.  The beausoleil oysters were my absolute favorite.  We each had the crudo sampler.  My favorite was the arctic char with horseradish cream, wasabi tobikko and dill frawn.  We had the uni toast as well.  I had never had uni before but it was likely the best thing of the night behind the beausoleil oysters.  This meal was so enjoyable we returned the next day for happy hour.  We didnt have a reservation but a quick phone call and advice from the manager let us know to be there right at opening for the best chance at seating.  Luckily for us there was a unique little bike shop/bar just a few buildings down which allowed us to drink a pint while waiting for the opening.  The second day was just as good as the first.  We didnt want to overeat as we had later dinner reservations at Flour + Water.  The happy hour was awesome.  I think the beers were $4, washington oysters $1 and $1 marinated mussels (just drooled on my key board thinking about these), clams, shishito peppers and a repeat of the UNI TOAST.  The staff was friendly and helpful despite the place being busy.  Would love to go back my next visit.", "author": "Adam B."}

The lobster held it's flavor on the backdrop of beets and mache.  The burratta cheese provided a great texture for the salad without an intrusive cheese taste.

So I see an inconspicuous place titled Bar Crudo.  Immediately I imagine raw oyesters so I run walk towards the place.  Tiny on the inside I sat at the counter by the window.  I ordered some wine and a dozen raw oyesters and littleneck clams.  Oyesters,  fresh; sweet.  Clams firm; bursting with flavor.  DEE LISH.  Now I wanted some salad but wait, my wine was getting low so..alright, I'll take another.  My salad had lump crab on it.  Not dry shredded dark crab meat.  Clean, white lumps of crab.  That was all I needed.  The bill wasn't cheap but who cares.  \nI called it a night and as I walked back to my hotel I rubbed my belly thinking I gotta go back to this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-04", "description": "I was sold by the Happy Hour deal:\n$1 Point Reyes oysters, $5 glass of white, $5 cup of their famed seafood chowder. And the name. Bar Crudo. It just sounded so sexy; when I arrived I immediately picked up on the layout of the restaurant, the cute details like the stand tables with hooks, black and cream color scheme, contemporary artwork and sexy yet cartoonish sketches on the walls...\nNow, not only did it sound sexy. It looked it, too.\nI was eating up the hype, the 4.5 Yelp rating, the thought of $1 local seafood fare... And, I ordered accordingly.\nA dozen platter of oysters (per person... oh, I can take it), a shared cup of the chowder, a glass of the buttery sweet house white, and last but not least: the crudo sampler.\nThe only way I can describe my palette's reaction was: disappointment.\n* The oysters were still a bit glistening, iced, accompanied with delicious sauces, but several were the fat, creamy, very \"sons of the sea\" one might say, and a bit hard to put down. I don't know, maybe that's just luck, and honestly for $1 each I don't mind at all. But, at the end of the day it definitely stuck with me.\n* The seafood chowder was quite tasty, very savory, very rich. Maybe a little too rich; it was a tempting color, spoonfuls were satisfying, but I don't know if I would say I \"loved it\". I think it needed just a tad more balance, there was a tang that I really loved but it wasn't enough to cut the cream, the bacon overload and the fattiness of the mussels and octopus. It was truly Americana, and I may crave this on a cold misty San Francisco evening--but I'd need a friend to share just a cup with, for fear of clogging my arteries.\n* The wine was delicious. Seriously. I have nothing bad to say about it. Great pick for a house white.\n* The greatest disappointment was the crudo. Name a restaurant after a particular dish and one expects the dish to be the highlight of the meal. It certainly was not. Apple celery root paste as a condiment? It was akin to baby food placed on a luxurious piece of sashimi. I was eating with Christine L and not one sample did we enjoy. The butterfish, tuna, and scallops were flavorful but they were dressed in a manner that we could only describe taste wise as \"...interesting\". The last crudo was hardly memorable at all, the fish being oddly bland and the coconut sauce far from inspiring.\nI loved the space, the service was excellent, and the idea of the $1 oyster plus delicious $5 wine Happy Hour. Perhaps if I had only ordered a dozen oysters and a glass, I would have been happy--it would have been a pleasurable and worthwhile $20. But, instead I spent roughly over $35 to include the very lackluster crudo. The soup, just needed a little tweaking--but the crudo? Just bring out the fish next time. Just the fish.\nA hit and miss menu brings Crudo's points down a notch, but overall: a great location for Happy Hour, decent place for slightly expensive seafood, best for groups of 3 or fewer. Would come back to try the rest of the menu but not anytime soon.", "author": "Jessica L."}

We went on a rainy day looking for some decent oysters.  We were new in town and didn't know that Swans was for lunch only so I hopped on my phone and did a search and found Bar Crudo.  Little did I know that it was a wonderful little place that I would visit often.\n\nIts ran by a wonderful owner named Tim and his brother.  The staff there is extremely cool and friendly.  I was a little nervous eating there because for one thing I have never really had much experience eating at places that served wine by the bottle much less a menu without pictures of the foods.\n\nSo I figured this would be my crash course on find dining.  I looked across the upstairs room, which by the way is so damn romantic on a quiet evening, and just mimicked the old guy with his young girlfriend.  I ordered so many samplers and bottles of wine!  I really got carried away!  Soon after all the slurping was done she asked if we wanted chocolate and I agreed.  We got some truffles with cognac which was just simply perfect.\n\nI spent a good amount and was very happy about it!\n\nLittle did I know that it would be my future account and Tim would be such a great guy to work with.  I can't wait till i return and have another amazing meal.  Oh and the wine selection is great!\n\nGo get dressed and check it out, tonight!", "author": "Harry H."}

For the most part the portions are on the smaller side, but the seafood sampler was definitely sizable, and fun to share.  They had some kind of appetizer sampler with 4 small bites that was one of the best things I have tasted in my life.

In our wanders we've introduced them to good chocolate (Recchiuti), pizza (Amici's), pastries (Tartine) and coffee (Ritual) - so we had to find somwthing better than average when we were asked to find a good place that served dungeness crab. We chose Bar Crudo and were rewarded for making that choice.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant is a (not so hidden) gem - a few seats at the main floor bar, and a few tables on top. Arriving on time, we were seated upstairs at the edge of the loft, giving us a perfect view of the kitchen area and were promptly brought cucumber water (and later a carafe of it) and the menus. \r\n\r\nThe first thing to notice is the fairness of the prices. A perfectly prepared half of a dungeness crab was $15 and ranked almost as high as the fresh-from-the-boat crab we had last weekend. Four well sized pieces of crudo ran $10, and the amazing fish chowder another $10. The wine averaged in the mid $30 range and the restaurant also sported an excellent selection of Belgian beer.\r\n\r\nThe crab, as I mentioned, was perfect and served with clarified butter, a spicy sauce and a large crayfish. The crudo sampler had some amazing pieces (the arctic char) and some that were simply great. Then again, we're hard to impress with just excellent quality raw fish based on the amount of sushi we had. The joy of crudo is in the flavors that bring out the best quality of the seafood. I'm happy that I did the sampler as four pieces of even the most excellent char would have been too much.\r\n\r\nAs is appropriate, the cooked or more heavily flavored dishes followed the simpler ones. For our friends who started with the crab, a tuna confit followed. For my wife and I, our crudo was followed by the best chowder I have had in a decade - a perfect bisque with expertly boiled potatos and morsels of seafood (the cod and squid were perfect). We ended with the cheese plate - three well selected cheese balanced with honey, dates and perfect slices of walnut toast - lightly  buttered and grilled. The toast was so good, we had to ask for more to end the meal. A final offering of mint and truffles and we walked back into the winter drizzle, our wallets only $40 lighter per person for the experience.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Avery G."}

Bar Crudo was a couple of  blocks away from our hotel, so my friend and I decided to try it out. We almost walked past it because it's so small. We got there just after it opened, so there were plenty of seats available at the counter. I would advise getting reservations because when we left, they were telling people it would be a two hour wait.\n\nI guess the best way to describe Bar Crudo is an Italian seafood/sushi bar that has a great beer selection. We got the small Seafood platter, a whole Dungeness crab, the seafood chowder and washed it down with Chimay Blue and Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen. All the beers they served came in the official brewery glass.\n\nHighlights were the seafood chowder and the Belgian beers. The seafood chowder had large pieces of fish, shrimp, squid, potatoes and pieces of bacon, The bacon was a nice touch and added a great smoky flavor to chowder.

Are chalupas praiseworthy? Not in my book), recommended Bar Crudo to me.  My boyfriend Joel and I were feeling a tad uninspired about life last night, so we stopped in at this establishment on the way home to pamper our tastebuds and generally lift our sagging spirits. \n\nDue to the impromptu nature of our visit there was no room in the main restaurant (a good sign on a random Tuesday), so we sat by the bar in the window, which proved to be a good spot. The ambience didn't grab me at first but grew on me during the course of the night. Was that linked to wine consumption? Hard to say.\n\nWe ordered a lovely 2005 Pouilly Fume ($42) to kick things off, which struck the right balance between minerality and fruit, making it a useful pairing with our food. There were less expensive wines on the menu - but remember, I was feeling sorry for myself.\n\nWe launched into the meal with a couple of crudo plates (raw fish). The restaurant takes pride in layering unusual flavors in its dishes, so while I'm a perennial sucker for spicy yellowfin tuna, I succumbed to our waiter's pitch on trying some of the more adventurous, less standard concoctions.\n\nFirst up was the Tombo Tuna ($12 for four pieces), complemented with lobster oil, pineapple vanilla vinaigrette, chervil, Himalayan pepper. The vanilla was quite potent but other than that, this one came across a little bland and lacking in flavor - not a wholly successful ensemble. \n\nThe Hawaiian Ono, on the other hand, was quite delectable. The fish was beautifully presented, melt-in-the-mouth and matched up with lemongrass, citrus, chili, daikon sprout, enoki mushroom, mint, cilantro, and yuzu tobiko. The citrus gave a nice zing to the dish, the tobiko popped in the mouth and the chili provided a welcome bite ($12 for 4 pieces).\n\nFor the main event, Joel went with the seafood chowder ($13). Honestly, I'm not a huge chowder fan but I had to send the waiter away, twice, while I ended up practically finishing the bowl. The addictive ingredient that made me want this chowder over others? Probably the applewood smoked bacon. Bacon makes everything better. \n\nMeanwhile, I opted for the lobster salad ($15) featuring pistachio oil,  chiogga beets and some soft sliced mozzarella-like cheese, among other goodies I'm sure. This was also a successful combo - the oil was used sparingly enough that it didn't overwhelm, the lobster chunks were succulent, the cheese provided a dreamy backdrop, and beets generally make me happy, particularly when presented in two colors.\n \nBy the end of our meal, our tastebuds felt duly treated and we were definitely feeling better about life. We cabbed it home to indulge in chocolate truffles while watching the movie \"Match Point\". Yep, I'm spoiled. All in all it was a pretty sweet evening.", "author": "Leela S."}

I would suggest gettting there early as it gets quite packed.\n\nThe good:\n- $1 oysters\n- $5 seafood chowder\n- Uni toast\n- crudo sampler\n\nThe not as good:\n- $10 fish tacos\n- Chicken and rice\n\nThe not good:\n- the trout\n\nI have to say, the seafood chowder blew me away!! I would definitely come back here JUST for the seafood chowder.  I have to say, if it weren't for the seafood chowder, the artic char and the uni toast, I would have given this place 2 stars.  I can't say that I love this place.  But man the seafood chowder is heavenly! I think bar crudo is great for happy hour, but maybe not the best for dinner.  Service was extremely slow.  We sat at 5 and didn't revceive any food until 550 pm.  My bf and constantly checked the time.  We were here for over 2 hours.  Thats ridiculously slow for a raw bar.  When handing us the check they took 10% off because they knew how slow the service was.  I thought that was nice, but really not worth the 10%.   Alot of people contemplate between nopa and bar crudo since they are a block away from each other.  I think nopa wins hands down.  But for happy hour I would come to bar crudo.", "author": "Joanne H."}

It was my second time going and I was very impressed again. We made an 8:45 reservation on opentable and were seated at about 8:50. The dining room is very small, but, it is well lit and very pleasant on Bar Crudo's second level. We sat at a wonderful table close to the window. (This is the same table I had the last time I came).\n\nWe started with the full crab ($26). This seemed like a deal. You got 8 HUGE legs. Its always a fun experience with friends sharing, opening and eating the crab. We all agreed that the cocktail sauce was the best we'd had (and I am not really one to be picky about cocktail sauce). The crab also came with melted butter. I highly recommend anything that comes with it. The previous time I came, I also had crab, but, I don't remember it being this large. We might have come at an excellent crab time.\n\nIn addition, I had the Tuna Confit ($14) which came with toasted bread, roasted red peppers, green olives, asparagus and half a soft boiled egg. Getting a bit with the full combo was spectacular (but, difficult because the toast was so thick). My husband had the lobster and beet salad ($17). He enjoyed it, but, didn't like that he wasn't quite sure what some of white sticky stuff was on it. It looked to me like an uncooked egg white (but, who knows, we didn't ask).\n\nFor our last course, three of us had a cup of the seafood chowder. I was already pretty full, but, I remembered this from my last trip to Bar Crudo. It was delicious (best in the city), as usual. Somehow, I think I ate too much to fully appreciate it. By the way, the soup comes with chunks of fish, clam (out of the shell), potatoes, calamari, bacon and lots of cream. \n\nService was really nice. However, they could have cleaned off our table after we finished the first course of crab. It got pretty sticky and they didn't clean it until I asked them to.", "author": "Joan L."}

(In fact, it made me register on Yelp so I can write this; I do look forward to writing about more dining experiences).\n\nThanks to Yelp, we intentionally came here to see what the hype was all about, and low and behold we became believers ourselves.  We sat at the bar because there was no seating upstairs; the kitchen is wondrously tiny.  The service and atmosphere was warm and friendly - totally a local bar kind of feel with a touch of unique taste.  The food, however, was equivalent to a five-star gourmet dress-up-dinner type of establishment.  It was shockingly good.  \n\nWe ordered the Crudo Seafood Sampler, Lobster Salad, Seafood Chowder and the Gazpacho.  The Crudo sampler had bite-sized tastings of the Rhode Island Fluke (see Web site for details), Artic Char, Dayboat Scallops (raw and loved the fresh taste) and Tombo Tuna.  Each bite was heaven, and we joked about how this place could easily be the back kitchen of a French or Italian fusion joint and charge $100/head for tastings because it was that good.  The Chowder was a wonder of taste, because none of the seafood was overcooked.  The calamari was still soft and my teeth could sink effortlessly into the succulent soft meat.  Normally, I do not prefer to have fish in my seafoood chowder, but here, the small bits of fish were, ironically, not fishy but soft and flakey.  The red potatoes were not overcooked to the point where it thickened the sauce; no, each wedge had its sharp corners still intact.  The Lobster Salad was another heavenly dish, because, ironically, even without the fresh succulent melt-in-your-mouth lobster, the heirloom tomatoes and the rich burrata cheese doused with the caper vinaigrette was truly flavorful.  \n\nIncluding the two beers, our bill was about $80 before tip.  Cheerio.  We are definitely going again.", "author": "Theresa K."}

Got there on time and was told there will be a short 10 minute wait.  When I saw how small the bar area/waiting space was and how quickly more people came in with their reservations, I start to worry about how the staff will accommodate all of us sorta crammed at the door in an orderly fashion.  But when we got upstairs after a very long \"10 minutes,\" there were about 3 completely ready-to-serve tables waiting.  I was baffled, why make us wait downstairs when there are clearly available tables upstairs?\n\nBut my attention quickly shifted to the warm, charming decor: it's a simple room with romantic lighting.  The metal tables reminded me of Cafe Maritime (seems like the chef used to work there according to reviews I read here).   Our waitress was sweet and warm as well.  \n\nThe maitre d' who had us wait downstairs was interesting to observe.  He'd come up every two minutes to adjust the position of the chair next to us ever so slightly.  I suppose a perfectionist?  Maybe a nervous compulsive thing?  Unfortunately when that table was filled, he couldn't adjust the chair anymore.  So instead, he'd come upstairs, walk around it, and then go downstairs.  \n\nAlright, the food: oysters were delicious!  I don't know if anyone ever remembers the names of oysters they eat, especially when they come in a variety.  I sure don't. The crudo sampler reminded me of the sashimi three-way at Michael Mina.  Very pretty presentation, but slightly strong for my taste.  I couldn't really taste the fish themselves.  I didn't really touch my boyfriend's steak crudo, but it looked good and he claimed it to be good.  The seafood chowder we shared was good too.  He said it was the best calamari in chowder ever!  Very tender. \n\nI almost ordered another crudo dish just because it seemed like we didn't' order enough to eat.  But by the time I finished the chowder, I was completely full for some reason.  All protein, I guess!\n\nLast note, it'll be a slow dinner as many reviewers mentioned, but in a nice consistent way.  We ate our 2 hour dinner in leisure and felt very relaxed and satisfied.", "author": "Candice B."}

We had around four courses and we're still hungry.  While the food was good and presented beautifully I only ask to be full after an an expensive dinner *minus one star*.   Actually, the only dish that took *forever* (30 minutes after we had finished our crudo) to prepare was the mussels and clam.  I had two glasses of Chardonnay and the waitress charged me for three *minus one star*\n\nThe food itself was actually really pretty fantastic but the wait time left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since I'm the type to wait for everyone at the table to receive their entree before eating... so I'm generously giving Bar Crudo three stars.\n\nWill I be back?

The crudo plate was absolutely beautiful. I've never had raw scallop before this, so that was a wonderful suprise, and while my dining companions and I debated the gold star to the butterfish or the artic char, it doesn't really matter because it was just that good. (I voted for the char- horseradish, wasabi roe and dill, people!!)\n\nThe tuna confit with caperberries, hardboiled egg, roasted red pepper, white asparagus and sea sealt gave me the fun idea of playing \"the perfect bite\". Basically you just need to get all the ingredients on your fork at once. It didn't disappoint.\n\nLobster salad with golden beets, red beets, burrata (my new favorite-melt-in-your-mouth-cheese), greens and toasted hazlenuts were up next. Yum.\n\nThen grilled sardines with parsley and chickpeas. I mean, even the simplest idea came out so damn good. \n\nMy friend had the chowder, which he orders every time apparently. It was fantastic as well, but I was too focused on the rest to really get into it. \n\nWe finished with the cheese plate. In my wine and food induced delerium (the Greek white from Santorini was a good pairing), I'm pretty sure I picked up a rosemory roasted almond, held it aloft and exclaimed \"Even the almonds are so good!\"\n\nIt's a really small place, so be warned, but waiting for a seat would be well worth it.", "author": "Emily L."}

This was REALLY good.\n\nStill a little hungry, so we got a half dungeness crab, which was pretty good, but I still don't really get the whole crab thing. Didn't think it was amazing or anything, I just don't feel like crab tastes all that special in general.\n\nThey do a couple of hot entrees every night, but didn't try any.\n\nThey have a great selection of Belgian ales.

The decor is cozy and we were seated upstairs in what I called the intimate attic.\n\nThe vibe was definitely cozy and casual. We started with a series of Oysters which were good but they ran out of the Kumomotos. :(\n\nThe highlights of the evening: \n1) Artic Char (a firm salmon like fish with a most beautiful creamy horshradish sauce and wasabi tobiko)\n2) Spicy Yellow Fin (an Asian influenced composition of lime, cilantro, enoki mushrooms and chile)\n3) Lobster and Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata Cheese (sweet lobster with the most decadent Burrata cheese)\n4)  Excellent Chowder. Each dish was beautifully composed and the thick bacon in the Chowder delicious.\n\nThe lowlights of the evening:\nAny of the cooked foods. Both dishes were egregiously overcooked. My fellow Yelper's, I grew up in a restaurant family and when fish is cooked to the point of being firmly flaky, it's overcooked. I know it's what many diners have been trained to expect but the grilled Hamachi Collar was dry from the overcooking. The San Sebastian Tuna Confit was a huge slab of cold precooked Albacore Tuna that was swimming in oil. It was firmly packed and reminded me of (good) canned tuna. Both my dinner date and I were puzzled at these two dishes since a place that specializes in seafood should know better. \n\nThose two dishes aside, we enjoyed our dinner. We didn't taste anything that was a revelation but solid if you stick with the Crudo and steer clear of the cooked dishes (Chowder being the exception).

The vanilla flavor was a little odd to us both.  I didn't bother finishing my piece.\n\nLobster and beet salad - nice salad, but nothing too special.

I was seated immediately since there were few seats available at the bar.

So I ordered their sampler, the seafood chowder, and I tried one of 'em Belgian beers called Reinaerts Flemish.\n\nThe sampler was very good. It's like a sashimi of tuna, scallops, char, and forgot the other one; and there's a combination of citrus, sweetness, and saltiness to them. Very good combination with the beer.

We arrived at Bar crudo around 720pm with no reservation, because we weren't sure how long it would take us to get there and didn't want to be late for our time. The waitress had us wait only ten or fifteen min and we were seated! There is a dining room and bar area in front but we got seated in a little loft upstairs, very modern yet cozy. We were kind of copycats and both ordered the exact same thing. We each started with the heirloom tomato and lobster salad. Mmm! So good!! Really fresh! Next, we had the 2 person crudo sampler. We must have picked just the correct order to eat it in, because we started out with a more spiced fish and ended with a sweet one. They were all so good, so much flavor in each bite! To end, we each had a cup of the seafood chowder. I was expecting something more like a new England type chowder (since I'm from new England) but it was more like a thai soup, but with salt pork that my mom did used to put inside her authentic new England chowder. So it was a mix. The soup wasn't that heavy but very good. Once again, everything was very fresh. We asked about dessert, but they don't serve dessert here, we were informed. You can buy some chocolate candy that they buy from up the street, but what's the point in that. It was still a delicious meal! The only thing that's keeping me from giving it five stars instead of four was the service. The service wasn't bad, per se, but it was not good. It was weird. The waitress seemed like she was angry at us. She didn't really look at us, she was super brusque, she sort of slammed down everything and walked away as fast as possible. Probably it had nothing to do with us. Maybe she had a bad day. It wasn't super busy until right when we left, it was just filling up around quarter of 9, but I don't know. Or maybe she was mad we didn't order alcohol? It was weird, we both noticed it, how could you miss it? Still, that didn't ruin our evening and I definitely recommend this place yum!

The fluke was super chewy. \n\nThe hot dishes were tiny, so hard to share if you're with a party larger than 2... and really if you have a party larger than 2, you shouldn't come here. But the chowder was very tasty but too creamy, you can get rich without feeling like you're drinking butter.  When we went, we had the mussels and clams, also started out tasty, but then went south when it quickly got unbelievably salty. So it's weird to try to switch from fresh, clean to hot and salty and overly rich. \n\nTo top it off, totally snotty service.

They have an outstanding selection of raw fish that would give the best sushi sashimi bar a run for it's money. I personally enjoyed the Char, as it is difficult to find anyplace that even serves Char. Also, the oysters are fantastic in that they are fresh - and that you have a choice of like 6 different varieties.\n\nAside from the raw bar, they have great cooked dishes such as a mussels and clam dish in a light red sauce - and the absolute BEST seafood chowder. Do yourself a favor and order the chowder. Most chowder I've ever had, I am wondering where the fish is. It is chopped up and hiding as if the chef took the scraps from other dishes to make the stew. Well, not at Bar Crudo. The chowder is filled with big bites of identifiable fish in every bite, and somehow none of it is over-cooked - which is hard to do in a soup-type situation. \n\nIf you are absolutely starving and looking for a hearty meal, this might not be the place for you. Being a restaurant that specializes in raw fish, they really focus on the delicate flavors that raw fish has to offer. Savor each bite, and leave satisfied - not stuffed.\n\nAdditional tips on how to enjoy this place:\nYes, it is hyped. It is crowded. It is small. Be prepared for that. Make a reservation or show up as soon as it opens or you will be waiting a long time for a table or spot at the bar.\n\nThe service is, how shall I say....European? It is slow. You order 3 things and they come one at a time. The waiter disappears for a while. Instead of getting annoyed, enjoy it. Order a bottle of wine (or a beer for their OUTSTANDING Belgian beer selection), order a few dishes, and sit back and enjoy the ride. Be prepared to sit down for a few hours.", "author": "Craig G."}

I loved the lobster and beet salad - divine!  My favorite part was the big plate of mussels and clams we had at the end - they were the biggest I've ever had.  The broth was delicious.\n\nI would definitely come again.  They are a tiny place, they are always packed - so don't be late for your reservation like I was.

(A crudo is raw fish dressed in different sauces and goodies).  They give 2 pieces per crudo and they are just the right bite!

Be sure to follow the waiter's recommendations on which pieces to eat first!\n\nWe then proceeded with the Small Seafood Platter which had 3 of each item that included fresh clams, 2 choices of raw oysters, chilled jumbo prawns, mussels and crab legs.  This platter was delicious!  If you ever had the seafood platter at Bouchon's, the one served at Bar Crudo is not only just as good, it's also half the price!\n\nWe then had the lobster and beet salad which was out of this world!  Who knew that lobster and beets would go well together?  The lobster was perfectly poached and the beets were not the traditional blood red color, they were a nice yellow/orange color.  The combination of lobster and the sweetness of the beets was a delicious surprise.\n\nWe ended with the seafood chowder which was fantastic!  Honestly, by the time we got to the chowder to end our meal, I really didn't have any room left in my stomach, but to not eat the chowder would've been a bigger crime than to be overstuffed!\n\nThey do not have dessert at Bar Crudo so if you are celebrating, you can be like my bf and bring a cake yourself.

The portions were delicate and refined and at 24 I could not appreciate it.   Somewhere between Bordeaux and Vienna, I came to have a heartfelt respect for places such as The Danube.\n\nMy first experience at Bar Crudo was bittersweet because being a grad student and living in the states, you get accustomed to meals that do not give alot of freedom to discern flavors and treat dining as an experience and less of a meal.  The experience drove home the lessons learnt on the road.  The fact that you can taste a hint myer v. traditional lemon notes or fennel that adds to the dish rather than overpower the centerpiece encompasses what Bar Crudo stands for. What it comes down to is: quality v. quanitity.  Remember this while dining and shed yourself of your American tendencies.  Sometimes you need an open mind and a rainy SF night to bring you back to that place. \n\nI will have to say one thing though.   There are certain wines that go w/ raw foods and pinot noir definetely is not one of them (well at least not the med to full bodied ones one the menu).

Not to mention the deeply rich and most perfectly cooked seafood chowder I can even imagine.  The chowder reminded me of a chedder andouille sausage in it's richness and savoryness - although I I'm fairly certain that there wasn't cheese, there definitely is applewood smoked bacon.  And, as we all know (oh just admit it!) everything is better with bacon.  Somehow all this richness didn't overwhelm the seafood, which was delicate and tender, including dainty little squid tentacles and perfect mussels.  I can't forget to mention the simple pleasure of some of the best oysters of my life - Kusshi - creamy, slightly sweet with a hint of the salty sea.\n\nOh my!", "author": "naseema k."}

The arctic char was amazing, as was an octopus special we had.  The flavors are complex and interesting.  One downside - the scallop crudo we had was a great flavor, but the scallops were sort of slimy and mushy.  Probably just a bad batch, but they were...not good.\n\nWe also ordered a raw bar sampler, and it was not good.  The sauces that arrived with the sampler were basically vinegar, chunky tomato paste with horseradish, and the water used to boil the shrimp.  The flavors weren't good, and added nothing to enhance the raw and cooked seafood.  Not good at all...we would have been better off with a thing of drawn butter and cocktail sauce from a jar.  The seafood (which I ate plain) was tasty, and fresh, so that was not an issue at all.\n\nI would definitely go back, and would order several crudos, and some of the \"hot\" dishes on the menu.  I would skip the scallop crudo and the raw seafood.  I think with those changes, this would be a solid 4 star meal.", "author": "Shannon H."}

Most of the crudo we tried here had a little too much going on, and not in a good way.  Of everything we ordered, I enjoyed very few -  the arctic char because it was a bit less frilly and  the seafood chowder, which was very rich and full of flavor and chunks of seafood. The lobster salad with tomatoes and burrata was nice but I could have done without the raw peas. \nWe also had the butterfish and scallop crudo, which as I mention above, just had too much going on and took away from the delicate fish.\nOysters - we had the Point Reyes as they were on the $1 HH special.  I typically like bigger oysters but didn't order any because this batch had bits of shell in most of the dozen.\nPeel and eat gulf prawns- I do not find shrimp cocktail particularly interesting but I have to say, these shrimp were sweet and distinctive from that, but still not worth $2 each. \nUni avocado toast - I LOVE uni, but I was far from loving this rendition.  The uni was not particularly fresh and the avocado overpowered the delicate uni and tasted like lime soap to me- I figure there was probably cilantro in it.\nPicking at the hamachi collar and beans, I found this dish quite tasty.  It was probably the best dish until I got a piece of the chard and realized how overly salted the sauce was. \nThe steak crudo was again, overly citrus-y and bitter! Tasted like maybe there was some citrus pith made its way in.   \nFor $200 between the four of us, we barely felt like we had appetizers.  Even if we wanted to stay for more, there were barely any other options.  We went directly to a sushi/izakaya joint immediately after.", "author": "Amina B."}

Louisiana Devil Prawns bring out predatory instincts and a need for numerous napkins to clean up the carnage. Oysters at $1 a fantastic deal, although several times we have had very small and flavorless Pt Reyes :( \nSeafood Chowder on a few visits was the best I have had and I have roamed New England sampling. \nAtmosphere is seriously lacking, uncomfortable tables and chairs and a high shine modern scene is cold. Downstairs you get blasted with cold air from the door or people hanging over you waiting for tables and If you sit upstairs the smell of the dishwashers and detergent can overpower your meal until the place is packed and the battle of wafting garlic, saffron and... beats out PTSD flashbacks of bussing tables and dish washing as a 14 yr old.

The service was on point and knowledgeable. The fish is so fresh. The favorite was the tomba tuna crudo with peppers, chive blossoms, and salsa verde.

I stopped by a few hours before our dinner reservation and discussed how I would like it done and they were more than happy to accommodate me.  Apparently they have had many requests to put the ring inside an oyster - does this sound like a weird idea to anybody else out there?  A briny ring doesn't strike me as romantic.  Instead, I had them plate the ring and ring box with our main crudo order and it came out very beautiful, elegant, and not briny in the least ;-).

I'm so glad that they are moving to a bigger place in the Lower Haight in the next month! \n\nI came on a Thursday night, during peak hours, so we just put our name down (for the 45 min wait) had a drink across the street at Masa's, and they called us when there was a spot at the bar. Right in the window, in the corner, totally cute! We weren't in a rush so the wait was no problem, but don't plan on just walking in and finding a spot. \n\nEvery single bite of food was so delicious that my conversation that night turned into my friend talking and me just saying \"mmhmm mmhmmm\" and completely ignoring everything that was coming out of his mouth. Sorry homeboy but I was being taken to a dream world of raw magic. There is certainly something to be said about a restaurant that does simple to perfection. My favorite was the arctic char (with horseradish, wasabi, tobiko, and dill) - not an exceptionally innovative flavor combo, but the ingredients were clean, and in perfect proportions. The butterfish tasted just like, well butter, so how can one go wrong? I suggest getting the Crudo sampler, and then ordering more if the serving sizes are a bit too european for your liking.  Although, if you like sparkling wine, I'd definitely skip ordering loads of food and fill up on the Gruet blanc de noirs. The sampler and 4 glasses of champagne (and by 4, I mean 6), and I was good to go! Yum!\n\nAs far as service is concerned, they seemed a tiny bit uptight in the beginning, but I'm sure that's because they were slammed.

I'd bet it was a combination of the two.\n\nI'm surprised that they weren't on the best of the bay for 2009 (anyone know the reasoning behind that?

Interesting combinations and well-crafted dishes that hit all the right notes. I recommend getting the crudo sampler plate, the San Sebastian (home made Tuna confit), the steak crudo, the hamachi collar. And though I don't eat potatoes, I've heard the chowder is some of the best in the city. They also have a great wine list and an extensive beer list with perfect pairing options. They can even offer a nice red wine that goes perfect with your fish. I'm very glad they're only a few blocks from my house. It can get crowded, so i'd recommend reservations thurs-sat. They also have a dollar oyster/$5 wine happy hour. It's great.", "author": "Jason G."}

I love the fresh tasty fish - I'm not a big seafood platter person, but I've adored all the crudos I've tried including a recent foray into butterfish with grilled meyer lemon. They have oysters, a great beer menu, and some wonderful seafood chowder... on a cold and rainy winter foray into Union Square, nothing is more comforting than to duck into their bar and eat the chowder. Or the clams with spicy sausage. Or just the beer. Everything I've ever had here has been good, perfectly done, and fresh. That goes a long way for me.\n\nI also love the space - it reminds me of a redone warehouse with the smal upper loft, mermaid logo and the great jellyfish art/light fixture. \n\nYou can get into the bar area in the early evening, but if you want a proper table (not such an upgrade for 2, frankly), or god forbid, have more than 2 people, you need a reservation.", "author": "Carrie G."}

Last week we decide to check it out and we make our way over to Divisidero Street.  Its pouring rain and 10 minutes till 5pm.  We walk in, the place is lit up with candles and you can see the tables were set. As soon as we entered we were approached by a young woman who was the biggest bitch I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  She told us we had to wait outside until 5pm and we nicely asked if we could sit at the bar and wait because it was pouring outside. Again she said rudely \"UM, no, you need to leave now and come back at 5pm.\"  My husband clarified that we did not need a drink right away but wanted to stay for dinner and do not mind waiting at the bar until they are ready to serve.  She looked at us with the nastiest face and told us to get out.  Needless to say, we were shocked. We took our money to NOPA where we were greeted and welcomed with open arms even though they also did not open until 5pm.  The hostess and owners allowed us to sit at the bar and we ended up having cocktails, a bottle of wine, and dinner for over 2 hours. It was phenomenal and we are glad we did not spend a penny at Bar Crudo.  We will never go there again!", "author": "Veronica P."}

Every dish we had was tasty, seasoned well, and I respect that they use high quality seafood.\n\nHere's why it's only 2 stars:  For  $150,  I ate about 2 pieces of fish.  OK, I am exaggerating, but not by much.  The food is among the most expensive and skimpy  I have experienced in San Francisco.  And that, my friends, says a lot.  \n\nWe literally got 5 - 6 dishes for that amount.  One, a scallop dish, we ordered for our table of 4 people but they only serve 3 scallops.  After 5 minutes discussing with the server where she advised we could cut it into 4 pieces, we finally asked:  can you spare an extra scallop?\n\nI walked out of Bar Crudo feeling like I had blew over $100 on what amounted to a tasty round of appetizers.  I ended up going to the Philly steak place next door and ordered sandwiches and fries as my main course for evening.   \n\nI understand why this place gets such high ratings.  The food is excellent.

I made reservations for 8:45 and showed up around 8:15 and there effectively was no place for myself and my date to hang out comfortably. They had a 'quasi-bar' with a few stools, but it wasn't intuitively obvious if you could order a drink or what the deal was. \n\nAnyway, we head upstairs for dinner a few minutes later and I was a bit shocked to see there were only a handful of tables. Granted, this wasn't a problem, just a bit of a surprise. The ambiance was nice and it was pretty easy to have a conversation without raising your voice.\n\nWe opted for the 'crudo sampler' (for 2). It included tuna, sea scallops, and some other fish I can't recall. At any rate, I was not disappointed. We also ordered some seafood chowder and steamed clams. The seafood chowder ROCKED! I could have had a large bowl of this and would have been fully satiated. The steamed clams were excellent as well. \n\nOverall, I was pretty happy. But, I'd concur with 'avalon e.'s' assessment in that you don't get much 'bang for the buck'. While I enjoyed my meal very much...I was still hungry when we wrapped things up.", "author": "Matt F."}

I love the delicateness of a fresh fish with sauces that bring out the taste of the fish, not overpower it.  This definitely is the place.  We had 2 glasses of champagne and a bottle of white wine since I didn't want to get anything red to overpower the taste of the fish.  We started with 3 types of oysters.  Very fresh, and each had a unique flavor.  The waitress was really well versed in describing them to us.  Then we had the Crudo sampler, in which they let us substitute the scallop for fluke.  Everything was amazing.  The sauces and little spices complimented the amazingly fresh fish very well.  The tombo tuna melted in our mouths.  The fluke had a little bit of caviar to add a little touch of saltiness which it needed.  We also had the arctic char which had a type of wasabi paste on it which gave it an amazing flavor kick.  The fish was cut perfectly too, not too small and not too big.  \nIt's a very small place with great service, nothing lacked.  We ended with the Ono in which it wasn't as good as the others though.  Partly because they gave us 2 by mistake and only charged us for one so we couldn't finish it.  Very nice of them.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!

I had wanted to go here for what seems like FOREVER, so when we pulled up in front of Bar Crudo to start our evening, I was ecstatic and almost jumped out of the car before he could come to a full stop to drop me off!\n\nWe shared a bottle of Riesling over delectable Kushi oysters and Bluepoints that they had in stock for that evening.  You have to request horseradish separately, which is something I never did understand for any place that serves fresh oysters, but what they bring you is perfectly grated FRESH horseradish.  Crudo menu is fantastic - most notable was the Kanpachi crudo dish.  Four thick slivers of fresh, raw fish, with some nuts and a lovely, slightly tart huckleberry sauce drizzled over it.  It's a remarkable bundle of tastes.  This particular fish has a bit less flavor than typical yellowtail sashimi, but that actually allows the accompaniments to bring it to life, whereas the typical yellowtail sashimi's buttery flavor would kill the accompaniments that grace this dish.  Gazpacho was refreshing - -  a bit of seafood in the middle with a fresh, watermelon-infused cold soup.  Really nice.  We ordered more things - and everything was just truly fresh -  and flavorful.  Bar Crudo really knows how to dress up their raw seafood - - and presents it in a fashion that makes it look so appealing.\n\nService was very good, and even when it became a full house, we never felt neglected.  I should mention the water they gave us - - - somehow, without any change in color, I could taste a bit of watermelon flavor in the water.  I can't say I liked the water itself - - but what it did do at room temperature was serve as palate cleanser everytime you took a swig.  When dealing with a crudo menu - - this served most useful.  Fascinating... I'd have never thought of it.\n\n***********************************************\nSecond time:\n\nAnother night out to dinner w/ Archie the Manly Man.\nThis  time, we order champagne, which I always enjoy with oysters.  The champagne was no Veuve Cliquot, but a Brut 1+1=3.  Really, that was what it was called, and our server recommended it, so we accepted.  Great, it was not, but it got us pretty buzzed so it did what it was supposed to do.\nI was out to challenge Archie's allegedly newfound love of oysters, which he claimed at our last dinner at Ella where I had to twist his arm to get him to try raw oysters.  We'll see.  First, we order Kushi oysters - but they are out, so we end up getting Luna and something else, which name I cannot recall.  Oysters were good but not as good as last time.  I dress my oyster, Archie follows point by point.  I eat - - he eats.  Wow.  He actually does look like he's enjoying oysters.... Reminder to self, take this blossoming oyster-lover-wannabe to Hog Island one day.\n\nGiven this was his first time, I didn't want to risk ordering anything new and ruining his experience here, so I opted to order much of the same as last time, but fewer items as this was only an appetizer for us before the real dinner.  \nEverything was as good as the first time - -  but they had run out of Gazpacho, which was too bad because I really did enjoy that soup last time.  Most notable this night was the scallops w' corn puree..  The Konpachi was good but not as good as  the first time.  The Ono we had was very tasty... but again, it's the freshness that is really impressive.\n\nThere was no watermelon-flavored water, though.\n\n***********************************************\n\nBar Crudo is a place that is more appealing as a \"let's have a drink and get some good appetizer\" place rather than a full dinner location.  Very fresh fish, and I'd dare to guess that the majority of the things on their menu will be good.\nIt is expensive, though.  If you love raw seafood like I do, it can run way beyond $100 pp if you eat here in hopes of filling yourself.  I would just recommend you come here for a plate or three of appetizers, have a couple drinks and be off to a real dinner, like I did on both occasions.\nThe dining area upstairs is very small, and the seafood bar downstairs, while pleasant, is also small.  Make reservations if you want a table, they're available on www.opentable.com and I've had no problems getting one thus far.\n\nBut food aside - what makes Bar Crudo amazing is that in all this time, I have NEVER, EVER seen such an extensive list of Belgian Beers available, from Chimay Blue, Stella, etc.  There must be at least 40 different kinds of Belgian Ales available, a variety of IPAs and double IPAs, etc.  I daresay you'd be hardpressed to find this many Belgian Beers in one place outside of Brussels or something.\n\nFor that alone - BC would get 5 stars, but add in the fresh fish, and you might as well call it \"BAR GRACE\"!!!!\n\n\nThis is the good life, folks.... give it a whirl.", "author": "Grace K."}

We could have gone somewhere else, but prior to coming to Bar Crudo, i had read endless reviews on yelp and came in with *high high* expectations, and it seriously made me want to give it a try, and i swear, i was willing to wait the extra 30 minutes.\n \nI wouldn't really say this is a suitable place for a date... \nthe upstairs :  seemed rather claustrophobic, and the bottom level, well, primarily a bar area with a bunch of bar stools, can I just tell you how uncomfortable those bar stools were? In fact, I had to stand up a few times, and it was actually MORE COMFORTABLE to stand up, but what a waste to enjoy an evening, and not only that, there were people walking back and forth, including the server, because either they had to use the restroom or they were going upstairs, in other words, very chaotic, so you can't even sit comfortable.\n\nKinda has this California Wine Merchant feel (i'll write my CWM review tomorrow)... the structure of the bottom level that is...It even has this window seating area, and draws you into the back... It's cool I guess, everything is freshly prepared, and if you get a chance to sit on the bottom level, you can see how the meals are prepared.\n\nORDERED:\n**Crudo Sampler (2 pieces each, you get artic char, fluke, scallop and tombo tuna) $22. I'd say it was 3. It was interestin, rather fresh, but I wouldn't say it was excellent.

I'd give it a 1.5.. being the seafood lover I am, there was just too much to it, I was getting sick of it after 2 bites.)\n\nHe got the seafood chowder, which is basically clam chowder, but the seafood way with fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, bacon and such, but for $13? And to consider it as a meal of its own? 2.5 stars. It was quite tasty, but I wouldn't necessarily order it as a meal. I highly suggest getting something else as well. It was kinda thick too,  honestly, I'd rather save a few bucks and walk over to Boudins and get the original new England clam chowda! but if you like dipping your food in sauces, the complimentary bread they give you tastes actually super yummy with this seafood chowder.\n\nOverall, this place was SO bad that we stopped ordering after 2. yea, it was THAT bad... :x\n\nParking: a block away.  we stayed for 2 hours, and it was less than $5, for a parking structure, that's the cheapest i've seen in SF...\n\nService: rather slow, and the server was slightly annoying, but I'll pass... ask me about it if you really care.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nBasically, bottom line, this place is OVERLY HYPED on yelp, and I was VERY disappointed.\n\nI really REALLLY wanted to like this place, and i even wished after a few bites that it would magically turn into a 4 or 5 star like everyone else... AND Gawd KNOWS that I'm not a picky eater... you want your oyster//seafood fix? hog oyster hands down!\n\n2 stars is being generous, prolly cause the chowder made an impression. \n\nOh, btw, the restroom was disgusting and def tiny! I'm sorry Bar Crudo, you really disappointed me, BIG TIME.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Bar Crudo should be a sort of Mecca for all those in the Bay Area who like unconventional, creative cuisine with intense flavors. They have some cooked dishes on their menu, but the true highlight of Bar Crudo are the raw items.\n\nThey have four different types of oysters that are served on the half shell,. I had to sample all of them, since I LOVE oysters. They were all very good, of course. I then ordered the crudo sampler plate, which turned out to be an absolute work of art! On th sampler plate come four different pieces of raw seafood: Arctic char (which is similar to salmon and comes topped with creamy horseradish, wasabi tobbiko and fresh dill), Massachussets dayboat scallops (with vichisoise, black caviar, chives and lemon zest) tombo tuna ( with lobster cream, vanilla salt, watermelon radish and licorice greens) and Rhode Island Fluke (with fennel, cara cara orange, arbequina and olives). This dish was AMAZING. I honestly can't emphasize how wonderful it was, especially the Arctic char and the scallops. I have never tasted anything like it, and as a fellow yelper stated in her review, eating at Bar Crudo will definitely affect my taste for sushi and sashimi from now on. Aside from the beautiful presentation and the flavor, the seafood they use is of incredibly high quality. They put a lot of work and detail into their food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-23", "description": "Good things often come in small packages. I'm not sure if that's the case, but when speaking of Bar Crudo, it's right on the money. Opened in November 2005, by twin brothers Mike (the chef) and Tim (the house manager) Selvera, Bar Crudo has taken the raw-bar food craze to a new level. Its precise culinary delights are prepared and served in what must be one of the smallest dining spaces in the city. \n\nDespite its size, it's the perfect place to hang out with your friends or spend quality time getting to know someone special.  I'd noticed crowds gathering in front of Bar Crudo for several weeks. At first I thought they were party-goers and wayward smokers standing in front of the Tunnel Top Bar next door, but on closer inspection, I soon realized they were dedicated seafood lovers waiting to get into the tiny 30-seat restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere\nIn a former crepe house, the Selvera's have created a marvelous modern space with two unique dining counters downstairs, each seating five people. One of the counters gives you the opportunity to watch the chef and his staff prepare a wide variety of seafood specialties. The other is near the front door, and gives you a great view of other diners and, if you turn around, Bush Street. As you head upstairs, take a look at the unique chandelier that can best be described as looking like several jellyfish. It adds just the right amount of fun dcor to the place. \n\nFor the most part, the service at Bar Crudo is quite good. On the two occasions I've eaten there, I'd called ahead about 20 minutes before I wanted a reservation and was able to reserve space at one of the two previously mentioned counters. The hostess was cordial and professional on the phone and in person. Chilled cucumber water and warm bread was served promptly and my server discussed the house specials with me a few minutes after that. The other diners were quite chatty, and I soon found myself in conversation with many of them, discussing what they were eating, how many times they'd dined at Bar Crudo before and what the drunk man who kept pressing his face against the front window was screaming at us.     \n\nThe Food\nChef Mike previous culinary duties include being head chef for the opening of Caf Maritime and head chef at Yabbie's Coastal Kitchen as well as working at Absinthe, Town Hall, and Hawthorne Lane. As the evening was rather chilly on my first visit, I tried the marvelously rich seafood chowder with lots of fresh clams, fish, mussels, shrimp, squid, red potatoes, and smoky applewood smoked bacon ($10). Other excellent choices included spicy lemongrass mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lime, bok choy, mushroom, and snap peas ($12) and delicately seared dayboat scallops with tangerines, a sinful roasted garlic mussel sauce, pomegranate molasses, and watercress ($13). \n\nIf you love shellfish, Chef Mike and his kitchen staff don't disappoint. Their menu includes a nice variety of oysters ($2-$2.25 each), little neck clams ($1.50), marinated mussels ($1.50 each), peel-and-eat Gulf prawns ($2.50 each) and a deliciously chilled Maine lobster ($12 half or $27 whole). For true seafood aficionados, try the delicious seafood platters ($35 small or $65 large) consisting of a nice variety of oysters, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab and/or lobster. The crudo (raw fish) is the main focus of the menu and includes gloriously spicy yellowfin tuna cubes with ginger, soy, sriracha, and green onions ($12); Rhode Island black bass with hard quail egg, habanero tobiko and blood orange reduction ($9); and not-to-be-missed arctic char cubes with creamy horseradish, tobiko and dill ($10). In case you don't like seafood, try the artisan cheese plate with flower honey, seasonal fruit, medjool dates, and nutty walnut bread ($11) and the sherry duck liver mousse with green pepper corns, cornichons and grilled bread. Their rich flavors and tempting texture blend nicely together.  And if you're indecisive about what to have for dessert, don't worry. There's only one item available on the menu, decadent XOX truffles ($6) that were definitely worth the wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to dine alone, or perhaps with your friends or someone special, Bar Crudo's delicious seafood and quaint atmosphere are definitely a winning combination.", "author": "David G."}

The ambiance and service, however, aren't.\n\nI'd have appreciated if they had maybe one or two additional hot food options.  I know the name of the joint is Bar CRUDO, but I feel like hot seafood is just as tasty and respectable as raw.\n\nAs mentioned previously, I was a bit irked by the service.  \n\n1.  When we first walked into the tiny restaurant, everyone looked at us in a very awkward way, with expressions on their faces as though we shouldn't be there or something.  And, no one greeted us until I asked if this guy worked there and what the deal was.\n2.  I'm sure as you've heard before, the upstairs seating is very cramped and subsequently noisy. \n3.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and they didn't offer to put it on ice for us.  They just sat it on the table.  Just say NO to warm champagne my friends, that is just wrong.  And, when I asked our server for a bucket of ice, I felt like he thought I was being high maintenance when in fact he should have automatically put it on ice for us.  That's a no brainer in my book.  And, I noticed that another table had ordered champagne which had been placed on the table-no ice.  So, that was even more reason for me to mention it in my review-they need to alter their champagne chilling policy.\n4.  Although all the food was delicious, they brought everything out at once and didn't space the food at all.  They brought 4 dishes out at once which completely crowded the table and made me feel like they were rushing us.\n\nBut, the food was fab so I'm going to give them 3.5 stars.  The seafood chowder was amazing.  And, the lobster burrata salad is SO GOOD. \n\n I will be back, but if I experience bad service again I'll probably opt for other seafood restos in the future.

I'm thinking to myself that this isn't going to be enjoyable but boy was I wrong.\n\n  They started off with 1 star when we were greeted with some cucumber water. I LOVE CUCUMBER WATER!!  It's such a small detail but something I will remember this place for.  It's just so refreshing.\n\n  They got there 2nd star when I took a look at their wine and beer selection.  I hadn't even heard of a lot of the selection they carried and I'm a bartender!\n\n3rd star is for impeccable service.  The server was extremely knowledgeable about the food, was able to explain to us how to eat our crudo plate as well as recommended and was able to mix and match the oysters we wanted.  It was wonderful!\n\n4th and 5th star go for the food.  The menu selection is very small which (not gonna lie) scared me a little bit as I can be a picky eater sometimes.  But I let down my guard and didn't care if something had capers or olives on it (can't really stand the buggers) and decided to just roll with the punches.  We ended up ordering the crudo sampler which I would HIGHLY recommend.  The bite sized portions were just perfect and I feel that if we had ordered the 4 piece selection of an individual crudo we would have been disappointed.  I was shocked when my favorite crudo happend to be the scallop as I HATE SCALLOPS.  But that little thing was DELICIOUS! Possibly my favorite thing of the night.  The Beausoleil oysters were a great recommendation by our server as well.  Hamachi collar absolutely melted in your mouth and the bf was reluctant to share.  I had the hot clams as my main entree and was a little dissapointed not because they weren't good but because they were a little too spicy for all the delicate food I had just consumed.  There was some spice to some of the crudo selections but it was well balanced where as the spice in the clams was just too overpowering.  Took those home and will probably enjoy them for lunch today.\n\nHad an amazing experience here, enjoyed the quaint and close knit atmosphere, had an excellent dinner and will definitely be back!\n\n(Oh yeah... this place is DEFINITELY not good for large parties but absolutely great for a romantic dinner date)  Thanks Yelp for helping us find a really great restaurant!", "author": "shauna a."}

Also they were able to recommend a great champagne to accompany our meal and a port that was not on the wine list to enjoy with our cheese course. Fantastic. \n\nBar Crudo has definitely lived up to the hype that you all are giving it. This place was amazing and Tim was an excellent host. I shared the mixed crudo platter and loved every bite.

A member of our party ordered the half Maine lobster, which arrived with half of the tail, half of the carapace, and no claws (obviously a part of all Maine lobsters) at all. Being from Maine and growing up eating Maine lobster, I told our waitress that either they were advertising and charging for Maine lobster and fraudulently serving inferior Pacific lobster, or perhaps else someone was funneling lobster claws off to a side purpose (the lobster salad?) - but either way, since they advertised Maine lobster and were charging for it, they should provide us the 1 claw.  Our waitress said she checked with the executive chefs and told us they said that the 1 1/4 lb lobsters are just \"running small\" and that there was no mistake.  While 1 1/4 lb is absolutely the ideal size for a Maine lobster, there's no such thing as a healthy Maine lobster without claws.\n\nI told her that their story was untrue, and she left us for a bit.  We then saw her huddling with a bunch of people who worked there, and she eventually came back to us saying oops - the chefs said that we actually received a \"deformed lobster\" and she wouldn't charge us for it.  So they eventually did the right thing (and our seafood chowder and butterfish were delicious) by crediting us, but we resent that we had to push so hard and can't help but feel that they were trying to cheat us, and possibly others.", "author": "Aaron L."}

The plate was of average size but its contents were not. Four individual 1oz portions of fish, keep in mind this was not a small plate it was an entree.Next I ordered the Whole Main Lobster. They serve it cold and precooked, with a side of butter.

They also only brought us 2 soups (we ordered 4), and it completely lacked flavor. It was in desperate need of salt. We were so underwhelmed that instead of making a fuss about only getting two, we were happy to cancel the others. \nThe lobster salad with burrata was flavorful and fresh, and our favorite thing by far was the mussel happy hour special. They had a great lemon/jalapeno kick (I love spicy). We also ordered the devil prawns and were a bit disappointed. The sauce they were cooked in was delicious, but the prawns themselves hardly had any taste. I guess I just wanted to be blown away, especially given the prices. And this is perhaps why I'm being a little tough on this place-- if you're charging a substantial amount for your dishes, you naturally raise the expectations. \nI might go back and give it a second try, I'm bummed I didn't have the same experience that so many other Yelpers had.", "author": "Jessica P."}

Funny, witty, attentive, and clearly all having fun together.

The lobster heirloom tomato salad is worth a visit on its own.  \n\nMy highlight of the evening:  As we requested the bill, our server suggested we try to seafood chowder if we had any room.  Hmmm...chowder for dessert?  Why not?  THANK GOD we did because it was the best freakin' thing I've eaten in weeks.  I could have eaten bowls of this heavenly ambrosia.

Typically go here for romantic dinner dates since the place is a bit small. We always order the sampler of crudo, seafood chowder, two lobster salads (with lots of lobster, beets and burrata cheese.... me and the bf used to fight over who got the bigger half of the salad, so now we just get our own. no sharing for this dish!), and the mussels - I think we ordered the exact same thing the last 2-3 times we went here!  The crudo is essentially 2 or 4 pieces of sashimi with all sorts of yummy little flavorings on top that go with it (lobster oil, lavender salt, etc).  Other favorites are the big platters of shellfish, the bf loves crab but for crab we usually go to Swans Oyster Depot.

Here's my review of the food.\n\n5* for beer list\n3* for Hot \n4* for Raw\n3.5* for Wine/Cheese\n\nstarted off with the Malpeque and Kusshi oysters. Very delicious. Not served on ice like i've seen at other places.  \n\nWe had the Crudo Sampler and ate in order of spiciness as I had asked the server who brought it. \n\nStarted with the butterfish.  I really enjoyed the black garlic that this came with.  However it was not a melt in your mouth butterfish. Next was the scallop with the celery puree.  This was my favorite.  The scallop was the perfect size and the puree didn't over dominate the scallop.  We then had the tuna.  This was my least favorite.  It was too salty and it was an odd mix of pear/hazelnut with the salt.  Finally finished with the Arctic char and the horsey and wasabi and dill.  I enjoyed the heat in the nose but the char was big and it was chewey.\n\nI asked for some some of the tomato bread that came in one of the Cold plates.  I was thinking it was some fancy bread with tomato baked in it but it was just a french bread with tomato sauce baked into the top of it.  \n\nFor the hot entree we had the Scallops and Hamaci Collar.  I was least impressed by the hot food.  The scallops you can get seared anywhere like this and the sauce I've had better at a Thai joint.  The Hamachi was oversalted.  I enjoyed the oyster mushrooms and rhe rainbow chard but all it all it was too buttery/oily and salty to really enjoy the delicacy of the Kama (the collar). \n\nDrinks: I had the french sauv blanc and the french pinot.  Both were fair but I've had a much smoother pinot.   \n\nMy boyfriend had the firestone ipa and the deutsches abyss imperial stout.  I have to say that the beer bottle list was extremely impressive and had we stayed longer I would have opted for one of the Belgian Ales.\n\nLastly we finished with the cheese plate.  My favorite was the blue cheese with the honey.  There were 2 others but they didn't strike me particuarly in the stink category or the texture category.  I did like the fact that the walnut bread was served cut and toasted.\n\nMy take-- I'd go back and not order the hot food.  I'd stick with the raw, the oysters and the cold.  I doubt i'd eat the platter since I could easily go to an asian seafood restaurant and get the same if not seasoned better and way cheaper (if you want shrimp, crab, mussels, etc.)", "author": "A P."}

Unfortunately, it was on special, but if it's offered definitely get it.  The other crudo (crudi?) were all great, too, and we tried them all.  We also got the very often discussed chowder, which was delicious, if a bit salty.  Lots of substantial seafood in the chowder.  Everything (3 plates of crudo, 2 chowders, beer, tax, tip) was about 100 dollars, which I consider a deal.  It didn't take too long to get our food, which other people mentioned.  Plus, from where we were sitting we could overlook the chefs preparing the dishes (lovingly, exactingly, etc etc), and it was clear they were working hard.  I can't wait to get back.

From truffle oil drizzled to dill garnished, your yummy fish defied my stubborn belief that modern fusion seafood could never do what traditional sushi could...  Not only Crudo established its own style in preparing their version of raw fish, they combined innovative ingredients to bring out the fish's best.  Plus the extended beer selection...  How can one not love this place?\n\nThough I do miss the days when I could just pop in on a weeknight and get seated right away...\n************************************************** ***********************\nUpdate 7/16/07: A couple more fine examples why I will come back here over and over.  Friday night, without reservation, we were told the wait would be an hour.  Given the popularity and the size of the restaurant, I liked the fact that they didn't pull the snobby move many other SF establishments have done to me: \"No reservations?  Sorry\" (eyes rolling as lips moving).  Instead, hostess took our number and called as soon as the expectant table was ready.    And needless to say, the food was EXCELLENT.  The crudo samplers were amazing...  Amazing.  Vanilla oil dressed white fish (too busy devouring to take note of the proper name) smelled like candy but tasted like heaven.  The entire experience was simply the best.  Then came the next night, as we needed a place to just chill with some good beer...  we turned to Crudo again.  It was a daringly odd choice for just drinks, but they have GOOD beer.  Crudo didn't turn us away.  They let us hang and drink our beer until closing time.  We had a very relaxing half an hour to 45 minutes, with premium beer and a chill enviornment.  \n\nThis is a rare place that provides both great food and hipness without the attitude.  It is only natural to call it my favorite restaurant.", "author": "Jiajia C."}

The service is spot on without a touch of stuffiness. Both the Verdejo and Semillon whites were fantastic matches for our meal. \n This place makes it fun to share the bold flavors that come with the raw plates. After devouring the raw fluke, we had a lovely coconut milk jalapeno sauce that we couldn't watch go to waste--in a moment, there was the waitress with a plate of bread to sop up the sauce.\n I ordered the steak crudo which was presented in four little cylinders, each topped with a different complementary ingredient. It was wonderful, but too rich for me to eat as an entree; it would be perfect to share among 4 as an appetizer. The hamachi collar with cannellini beans and greens was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin and packed with flavor. I usually think it is snobby not to have salt and pepper on the table, but it didn't even occur to me until now that Bar Crudo does not partake in the automatic S&P--that's a good sign.

Seriously, the back of house seems to do a good job- nice presentation, definitely not cheap, but very good.  The lobster beet salad was not really a salad (more like a crazy sushi roll without the rice or seaweed) but great- I could eat that all day.  However, we made a reservation, were told 5 min. 40 minutes later (with no one coming to tell us what was up) we checked in again and were apologized to and told it would be 5 more minutes.  I understand stuff happens- and in a nice restaurant, when it does, perhaps you buy a drink or 2 for the people inconvenienced?  She even said they would 'bring some stuff out'  - however, no free apps, nothing.  Wait staff seemed pretty smarmy - topped out with me ordering a bottle and a sort of 'you cannot have ze duck' moment where he actually didn't bring it and made me try 2 other bottles instead.

It's sparsely yet tastefully decorated loft like interior was an immediate indication of the care given to details at Bar Crudo.  We arrived on a Friday evening without reservations (d'oh!) and waited at an absurdly small side table near the bar with a glass of Montepulicano and a glass of Spanish sparkling wine for my girlfriend.  After about 20 minutes we were seated at the bar; in the mean time the waiters were attentive to the order in which patrons arrived and made sure we had drinks if needed (there were people that were dying to steal our seats).  We sat and ordered the raw fish sampler which consisted of tuna, yellow tail, scallops and other raw fish.  Every bite was a masterpiece.  The portions are small, however, it made each bite all the more delicious.  It is food meant to be enjoyed and savored, constructed with meticulous precision and quality ingredients.  Each sample had it's own unique and subtle flavor, my favorite being the spicy tuna.  My girlfriend and I split the sampler and decided to order a cooked entree, the Idaho Red Trout.  We watched the cook, a lithe fair skinned brunette with flame tattoos on her arms, cook with astounding grace.  We even made friends with the raw fish chefs, two young latinos never taking a moment's break (the ticket orders were non stop).  The fish arrived, steaming hot, looking and smelling amazing.  The meat was buttery yet firm, it peeled right of the skin.  The taste... let's just say it was a good thing my girlfriend eats like a bird.  I got to eat most of it, savoring with utmost intensity each and every bite.  San Francisco was off to a good start..", "author": "Oscar M."}

And while it was hardly life altering or intoxicating like a narcotic, I'm glad I went. It was right by the hotel we stayed at so every night we strolled past it, seeing the crowded tiny bar space and jelly fish plastic lamps lightly sprinkling the back with their glow, and planning our visit. \nWe went last night, around 9:45 and the place was still nearly packed, understandable given it's mini physical space. We sat upstairs and while it was very hot and the lack of air conditioning a problem in early May, nevermind what it will be like in August, we were given cool cucumber infused water promptly by the very sweet and helpful wait staff.\nThey were out of a few of the raw bar items, lobster, and down to one half crab when we got there. It is understandable I suppose, given that it was later on a Monday night but if this is a typical occurrence it would get annoying. We each had the seafood chowder, which was generously filled with fish, mussels, squid, potatoes, bacon (which I left out), shrimp, and calimari rings. We also split the one half crab they had, and it was good but unoriginal. Given that we stayed away from the raw/cold selections the place specializes in though, it's our own fault for being tame :P Overall, we both left happy.

The space is very modern and love the lighting.  Only issue with the space is that it's pretty chilly and it almost made me not want to be eating crudo but something warm and hearty.  The full page beer selection is cool and the waitress suggested a great glass of red for me.  Started with the crudo sampler...love love love the scallops and the butterfish with the tapanade.  The uni avocado toast is delicious but you really have to love uni to enjoy this dish.  I'm not complaining since I love uni and appreciated the generous portion of uni.  The two hot dishes we tried were the hamachi collar and the seafood chowder.  The hamachi was good - interesting pairing with the white beans and mushrooms, very earthy dish.  The chowder is not skimpy on seafood and has this very creamy bacon flavor but being lactose intolerant I wasn't able to truly enjoy this dish but my dining companion said the chowder was what made the meal.  I'd definitely come back again but maybe when the weather is warmer...", "author": "Jen C."}

With the brightly colored walls and nicely placed lights, it really opens up the attic space all while making it warm and inviting.  \nI was more than a little put off by the prices and sizes of the dishes, and by the improper timing and delivery of the dishes.  While I am always one for enjoying and savoring my food instead of merely stuffing it in my mouth, it took my table of two 2 1/2 hours from ordering our food until we were done eating.  They bring out only two dishes at a time then wait another 20 or so minutes for the next two.  The pacing was just way off, especially since the sizes of the plates were pretty small and meager (but delicious).  The oddest part of all was that we got our salad--gasp---last.  But I guess it was worth it, for the lobster salad was by far the best dish we had....a perfect balance of flavors!\nI'd really love to give Bar Crudo another star or two but at almost  $100 for each of us (ok, so we had 3 glasses of wine each) it just wasn't worth it.", "author": "Jane I."}

My other favorite raw plate was the ono, with enoki, daikon sprouts, tobiko, and citrus.  It was such a great mix of flavors and textures.  My favorite cooked plate was the trout with braised greens, heirloom tomatoes and anchovies.   I literally cleaned the plate.  Other things we tried were tasty.  The day scallops with pea puree was yummy and the fluke with the serrano ham and the quail egg had a great texture but was a bit rich.

I never knew what arctic char was until bar crudo... it's closely related to salmon and trout, looks like salmon, but doesn't taste as fatty as salmon... which is why i love it!  the Mussels & Clams were just ok for me.  maybe b/c i was enjoying all the raw seafood and here comes some cooked ones... or maybe b/c i was too full to enjoy it.

I would warn you that the prawns are not only \"head on\", but are still fully in their shell and require a lot of work to peel and eat.

Our server--a dark haired young (I'm in my 40s, so that's anyone under 36) lady--was not particularly friendly throughout the meal, and she was continually pushing the trout on us.  I had my eye on it anyway, so I can't blame her totally, but she was relentless.  We ordered it, and see above: meh.  One of my dining partners asked for toast to go with the broth in his clams:  \"May I have some toast to go with this?\"  \"I'll get you some bread.\"  Not toast.  Finally, we ordered the cheese plate to finish up, and she first told us there was no cheese.  She checked, and told us that there was in fact cheese:  a Pt.

Bar Crudo is completely UNSPECIAL.  Their wine list, small but quality was probably the best thing.  Service was really good, unfortunately it didn't make up for the lack of intersting food items and teeny tiny portion sizes.  For the price you can get way better and more interesting food.  I predict this place will go through some changes and perhaps has a future.  As-is though, I won't go back.", "author": "christine h."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-15", "description": "For my birthday, my little sis took me there for one of the most enjoyable meals of this year. \n\nFirst, great little restaurant space. Very intimate, simple, but cozy. The environment reminded me of some great, small New York restaurants. I like the ladderback chairs in the upstairs room. What's great too is that you get a view of Bush St. below with all the comings and goings -- tourists and Tunnel Top drinkers. \n\nSecond, we got really good, attentive, and assured service. It's a cramped space, but the servers do not rush things. They (and the kitchen) are good at bringing things out at a good pace, not rushing, and trying not to crowd the small tables too much.\n\nThird, the food is very good and interesting. We split the small seafood platter. When we expressed interest in a variety of oysters, the server suggested adding a more complete selection for a slight added cost. We feasted on raw oysters, raw clams, one of the best mussels i've ever tasted, big prawns, and excellent, fresh Dungeness crab. Afterwards, a bar crudo sampler. The best of the 4 were teh dayboat scallops and then , was it the arctic char with some wasabi roe. My sis really enjoyed the fluke with the quail egg (quail eggs rule!) and a thin slice of jamon serrano(?). Finally, we ended with an overly rich yellow tomato and yellow watermelon gazpacho. It was finished with a bit too much olive oil, so after the initial 4-5 sips, it got too rich. However, the lobster salad with burrata cheese and heirloom tomatoes was scrumptious. I'd never had burrata with lobster before, and it was heaven. Yes, it still lingers in the mind. The last dish was what pushed us over our limit -- mussels in some rich tomato sauce and was it chorizo? It tasted really good, but we were completely full by then. \n\nI'm going to have to lay off the spending at Anthro, Therapy, the Candystore through the next year, so I can afford to go back a couple more times in the next year. \n\nI wouldn't mind trying to sit at the raw bar downstairs next time.", "author": "Lola X."}

The lobster salad was by far my favorite, with all the complex flavors it really shone. I'm intrigued to try it this summer when they pair it with heirloom tomatoes instead of beets (though the beets were absolutely delicious as well). My second favorite item was the butterfish. It was so fresh, and the truffle salt added such a delicious flavor, I could eat dozens of them! The ambiance was lovely as well. I liked that it was small, only about 9 tables upstairs, and bar room on the first floor. It made a perfect place for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend without being too cheesy. \n\nThe only part that kept me from giving Bar Crudo 5 stars was the wine list. I was hoping for a better selection. I ordered a pino noir as my second glass of wine and it tasted like eating a silver necklace.

The presentations of the dishes were wonderful, they seemed to have put some work into them.   But they were so unbelievably salty that we just couldn't finish them, however tasty they looked.  I actually considered rinsing the raw fish in my glass of water to dilute some of the sea salts but I think that is socially unacceptable....  \n\nI couldn't tell whether the food tasted good because the saltiness masked all the flavors.

Every time I have gone, I have had such a pleasurable experience! Last night I went with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar since we didn't have a reservation and there were no tables. This was my second time sitting at the bar, and I actually liked it better because you can converse with the chefs and it's much more informal. We shared one raw dish (butterfish with avocado mousse and peaches) and one cold dish (San Sebastian: tuna confit, asparagus, roasted red peppers, arbequina olives, caper berries, manchego, tomato bread). The butterfish was new to the menu and it was delicious, though a very small portion for what you're paying - as are most of the raw dishes. The San Sebastian is one of my favorite dishes on the menu because it's perfect for sharing, all of the flavors are great separate or mixed together, and it's actually quite a bit of food. For our hot dishes, my boyfriend ordered the Hamachi collar and I chose to have a bowl of the seafood chowder, because it's literally the best chowder I have ever tried. I've ordered cups every time I had been there before, and last night I knew I needed the full bowl. I told my boyfriend that he could try some, because it was sooooo good! He ended up finishing less than half of the bowl in addition to his Hamachi, and described the chowder as \"the best thing I've ever had.\" The chorizo in it makes a difference, and you're also getting huge chunks of all different sorts of fish so it's very hearty and filling - and not too creamy. AMAZING! Definitely a must if you're at Bar Crudo.", "author": "Kelsey M."}

Came here with my roommates and had one of the loveliest meals I've had in ages, for a pretty reasonable price considering how much nice wine we drank. In fact, I loved it so much I decided this was where I absolutely must come for Valentine's day with the BF (this was a few months ago, obviously, but I've been mulling it over). We have a tradition of going on the 13th to see if we can avoid the crowds, so I made an 8 o'clock reservation about three weeks in advance (I think the 13th was a Monday this year). The long and the short of it is that, even with a reservation, we end up waiting for a full hour. Seriously, I don't think the reservation meant anything. They just wrote down our name once we arrived. We showed up at 8 on the dot and the two other couples waiting before us got seated before we did, and the host didn't seem particularly interested in asking my name (making me wonder exactly what it meant that we had a reservation). I get that reservations don't always mean that a table is waiting for you, and sometimes you have to wait for a lingering party, and this place is super small, so I was trying to be patient. Still, an hour is a lot. We cheerfully went and got a drink at the bar next door after being assured that it would only be another 15-20 minutes, and ended up standing around awkwardly inside the tiny foyer for another 40 minutes after we came back. The food is indeed superb, but unfortunately by the time we finally sat down we were so starving that it was hard to appreciate the relatively subtle and delicate flavors as much as we would have liked. This may have been a one-off experience, but it was a real turn-off from ever coming back here for another special occasion. That said, the signature Crudo dish is unbelievable.

The San Sabastian took me back to my meals in northern Spain, The Kona Kompachi was one of those creations that comes together in a way that leaves your mouth gaping.  I'll describe this dish so readers can get a feel for this alchemist's craft: Mission figs, fifty year sherry, mascarpone, and young tender yellowtail spiked with almond dust!  The meal was priced perfectly and rang in at about 100 for the three of us with a nice glass of verdejo wine and a perfectly paired belgian triple beer(a karmeliet that at 14 dollars for a wine bottle size--- who wants wine?).  We finished our fluttering meal with a cooked chowder that blew us all away, no need for dessert, we were full and had bacon/cream/ sea love on our palattes with a hint of hops, the way it should be after a meal like this, lingering flavors.  Although i'm wondering what they could do with a raw chowder.", "author": "mr r."}

It's a great asset to the up-and-coming Divisadero corridor, and provides a good alternative to the many burger shops and ethnic eateries up and down the street.  I always have the same meal at BC, and it never disappoints: the four-piece crudo sampler plate (I think of it as \"Italian sushi\"), and a bowl of their most incredible seafood chowder.  This isn't a thick, gloppy chowder, but more like a sublime bisque, with chunks of fish and shellfish as well as potatoes and bacon.  I'd take a bath in it if I could.\nI was just in this past Friday; it was humming as always, but the service was crisp and efficient.  One minus--they have no coffee or tea; I was chatting with someone I had just met at the counter (great counter seating) who had a large glass of beer to finish and I wanted to keep him company while he finished it.  The server saw that I was a bit taken aback at having no coffee or tea, so he brought me a glass of sparkly dessert wine (on the house) so I could stay a bit longer.  Now, that's the kind of service that will continue to bring me back (along with that fabulous chowder.)", "author": "Tom R."}

The crudo sampler consisted of 2 pieces each of 4 of their crudo dishes and was a great introduction to our meal.  I have to admit, I'm not the most adventurous of sushi eaters, however, after tasting the amazing flavor profiles of the crudo sampler, I'm definitely going to be more apt to testing out sashimi and other raw seafood!  We ordered the cheese plate as our second course and while 2 of the three cheeses were good,  I would have preferred that the honey was in a separate container so I could use as much or as little as I liked.  When the mussels dish arrived, we were greeted with an awesome smokey aroma.   Each mussel was plump and fresh and the broth was light, but full of flavor.  At the end of the meal, my friend and I wished we had room to order the small seafood platter, but we were stuffed!  I guess there is always next time!!!!", "author": "Pilar P."}

The scallop crudo was just okay; the cabbage that went along with the scallop did not go very well with the scallops. The tuna was good, but the butterfish was disappointing. I love butterfish sashimi in japanese restaurants so I was excited to try this, but it was just okay the roasted bell peppers didn't do anything for that piece of fish. The lobster salad was amazing! very refreshing and very light. The clams were also not that great, a little more heat would have been nice as well as more garlic flavor, the lettuce cooked in the clam was unnecessary in my opinion.

Not the diamonds and chandeliers chintz of the ritz- the kind that matched our attire for the evening- country meets city (brown Frye boots, jeans, cashmere...you get the picture)  The only answer was oysters on the half shell.  But where to go?  Yelp offered many options but we weren't interested in a bar or fish market type place.  Finally we decided upon Bar Crudo, mainly because of the pictures of jellyfish chandeliers.  Not only were the giant jellyfish lamps more beautiful than in the pictures, but the entire restaurant surpassed our expectations.  We were seated upstairs in a tiny dining area the size of my bathroom.  (I have a big bathroom, and I like it a lot.  So that's not a negative comparison.)  Warm hardwoods, large yet low loft style windows looking over the street and glass/metal tables all worked together to provide a rustic touch of class.  The waiter (Andrew) was not only cute, but also knew his stuff.  He was attentive without being invasive- a fine line that many servers cannot straddle.  We ordered a sampling of oysters, followed by a crudo sampling, followed by more oysters.  They were all unique and a pleasure to taste (some more than others).  My only regret was ordering the Paco & Lola Albarino.  It was recommended to us by our server as a mineral, citrus, light wine.  It wasn't.  AND everyone else in the room was drinking the same bottle.  Made us wonder if they were overstocked and trying to clear out.  Oh well.  It was still delicious and the whole experience was exactly what we were looking for- a special birthday dinner for two foodies.", "author": "Connor S."}

What's all the fuss about?\"  Overall, it was a fine dining experience because the atmosphere was romantic and cozy and the service was very friendly and knowledgeable.  It was the food that was not especially memorable.  We ordered the San Sebastian which was pretty good but the tuna was dry.  The spicy yellowfin tuna cubes looked beautiful but were very fibrous - you almost had to swallow the entire 1 inch cube whole.  Both tuna dishes were disappointing but the kampachi was excellent - as were the oysters!

I'm truly a raw flesh devourer and I like to graze on various kibbles to stave off the threshold of boredom. Therefore, If you can marry raw flesh and variety, I am forever your food-slave. That is why you will find me at any of the numerous sushi bars in The City on any given eve (or afternoon for that matter). Now, with the option of a crudo bar, I can consume raw flesh on a totally new level. And what a level Bar Crudo has taken my palette to. I always request that Chef Mike dispatch whatever he desires. Just like at a sushi bar. For instance, the Scallops on the half-shell, with the shaved fennel and minced olives, drizzled with an infused oil nectar, is fucking fantastic (sorry Mom). Oh, or what about the the Arctic Char, topped with a horse-radish, creme fraiche and garnished with wasabi tobiko, then crowned with a mantle of dill. YUMMY! The Crudo Sampler has everything one could lust for on one platter...Tombo, Ahi, Fluke and Scallops generously adorned with their own cloaks of deliciousness. I will not trifle you with any more details. You will have to experience this for yourself. I can't do everything for you. Lastly, if you have to have a round of the cooked, try the Seafood Chowder. Simply put, the best chowder ever ladled into any gullet. The dichotomy that this dish conveys is pure genius. It traverses the thin line of delicate and hearty so smoothly, that even Nijinsky couldn't keep step. Anyway, I have seen the future of raw food and it is definitively crudo.

My dinning partner and I shared a Crauford's Sauvignon Blanc bottle, which complimented the all of the dishes we ordered.  We started out with a combination of oysters and were not disappointed by their freshness.  Our next  order was the Crudo sampler for 2.  Wow, the scallop was the best of all four presented.   The sauce gave it the texture and flavor that absolutely made the whole scallop melted in your mouth.   The tuna cube was the runner up with it's light soy and ginger flavoring, a creative deviation from its wasabi and soy sauce stable.  I didn't care too much for the Fluke crudo; it tasted flat and not as fresh.   Our last course was the much acclaimed chowder.  I love rich food so the creaminess was the perfect end to the meal.  This is a cozy little restaurant.  Be sure to call in ahead to reserve one of the tables upstairs, they're more intimate than the bar seating downstairs.

Bar Crudo was a great experience and the eating highlight of our weekend (though Slanted Door was tasti-licious 2).  Fully recommended by this humble tourist!", "author": "clarence d."}
