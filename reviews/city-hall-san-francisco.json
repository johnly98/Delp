If you want a small, non-religious, formal, but not traditionally lavishing ceremony, this is the best place!\n\nYou need to spend around an hour for the marriage ceremony process. Arrive at least 10 min before the reserved time. After the security check, find the county clerk office. You need to firstly have paperwork examined by an official. She/he will check your marriage license and IDs. \n\nThen, you will wait approximately 30 min to meet the commissioner with your witness(es) in his/her office. (They will give you a number so you can comfortably seated). The commissioner will ask your witness to sign the license. Only the couple and the witness(es) are allowed in the office.\n\nThen, you can choose a private place or the second floor above the main hall stair to hold the ceremony. The same commissioner will hold the ceremony for you. We (and I see many couples) chose the main hall. The great place, and the seriousness but friendliness of the commissioner, is impressive. (The bride before us even cried during the commisioner's speech.) Although they claim you can have 6 people to attend the ceremony, actually they don't count. As long as you do not bring an army, there are plenty space. The ceremony is around 10 minutes. But you may need to wait for the commissioner to hold ceremony for other couples. \n\nMy suggestion is to reserve an early time (10am maybe) so there are not many tourists in the main hall. (Or you actually like the tourists because they will applause for you at the end of the ceremony?). My ceremony was at 12:30 and it was a little bit noisy at background.", "author": "Y C."}

The San Francisco's City Hall it is which makes this place the best coming attractions for any special occasions of every season no matter what the consequences for both residents and tourists alike.\n\nI did likely visited to the SF City Hall a long time ago back in the early 2000s, and it was a magical experience! Inside, they have tons of magnificent views and historic wonders from the glorious, restored interior structures, beautiful aspects of the Rotunda, nice natural light displays and awe-inspired New York's Grand Central like atmosphere. It's officially welcomed to the public at anytime although it's defientitly the most popular of all is wedding photographs! Furthermore, it's also the home of the San Francisco mayor at this city hall too!\n\nOf course, the San Francisco's City Hall has tons of historic artifacts and special occasions moments from the beginning to the current. The City Hall did survived two earthquakes (both in 1906 and 1989) despite the minor destructive damages and renovations. 20th Century celebrities like Marilyn Monroe did married there back in the mid 1950s. Finally, in this modern generations of today, the city hall are always doing mostly seasonal and top priority events like St Patrick's Day Parade and Festival (every March), 3X San Francisco Giants' World Series Championships Celebration, and the Christmas tree lightning ceremony.\n\nParking at the SF City Hall can be challenging to park. You can park the the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. You can also alternatively ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, the San Francisco City Hall is the finest and the most recognizable monument that I've ever experienced and visited for many years!

The building itself is breathtaking. We wanted more of a wedding feel, so we reserved the 4th floor for an hour. \n\nWe went the day before to get our license, and to check out the space since this was a destination wedding for us. Our license appointment was at 9am, and the building was pretty empty. We saw some people heading in to get married as we left around 10:00. The process to get the license was fast at that time, but we wanted to walk around and see the building. You have to make an appointment to get your license online.\n\nIf you do a quick civil ceremony, they usually do it in the Rotunda, which is beautiful. You can have 6 guests, but it will be in a public area. If you want something more private, you can reserve one of the 4th floor galleries or the mayor's balcony for a fee. You can rent chairs for guest too. We chose the 4th floor North gallery because the lighting is better.\n\nOn the day of your wedding, they will rope off the area that you reserve, so it is a little more private. There were some people trying to catch a peak, but they could not wander in. City Hall allows for a string duo (not a quartet) if you would like string music. We hired Corelli Strings, and they were amazing. You also have to bring your own officiant. We chose Cynthia Gregory who set a beautiful tone to our ceremony. We also worked with our photographer Amanda Wei (Blueberry Photography) and HItmaker Films. They all have experience at City Hall and do a great job. \n\nCity Hall gave us the feel that we wanted in a beautiful setting without all of the fuss. We got married around noon. I was told it was empty during that time, but there were some people around. If you want a chance to get the iconic staricase photos, you may want to consider early morning or late afternoon. The later the better. One more tip, make sure about your time and your date. It is the government, and you cannot change things around without losing your deposit. If you will have a photographer, video, or ceremony music, you may want to contact them to confirm availability before committing to a date.", "author": "Keli B."}

Maybe not so much. \n\nFirst, the process is somewhat confusing. We arrived half an hour early with license already in-hand (hint: it's cheaper to get it at another courthouse!), but still spent most of that time running around trying to figure out where to take a number and whether we were supposed to take a number (yes). We had a friend who is a photographer doing our pictures and serving as our witness, but if we didn't, we definitely would have hired one of these photographers who is familiar with the process - highly recommended for others.\n\nSecondly, on a random Monday in March, the place was SWAMPED. I expected a lot of tourists, but I didn't expect a photographer \"camped out\" at every little nook and in front of every beautiful scene \"reserving\" the territory for another bride. Rude. People are also super disrespectful of the 6-guest limit - right before we got married, there was a group of at least 20 taking formal portraits on the stairs!  \n\nThat being said, once we found the right place to be, the whole process was like being at a very efficient DMV. Everything was on-time and ran smoothly. Our commissioner, Mary, was super sweet. We were not offered a \"traditional\" vs. \"secular/modern\" ceremony as many report, but seem to have automatically received the latter, which was very nice and unique. She was great at guiding us through the ceremony and letting us take our time, and was also very careful to pronounce our (rather difficult) names correctly. And while it did require a fair bit of pushiness, we were able to get some very nice pictures inside. \n\nAll-in-all, not a bad experience - and perfect for what my husband and I wanted - but I'm kind of shocked that people travel to CA just for this experience!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

So after exhausting our options in SF, my husband asked me where I've always imagined getting married at.  I quickly responded City Hall.  The reason I had never mentioned it was because of the cost.  It's expensive (unless you just hold the civil ceremony there, which is free).  My husband crunched some numbers and after all of the hidden costs for security etc etc knew we couldn't afford it.  However, he found out that we could pay less to rent out the space for 2 hours for a private ceremony, which is what we did.\n\nOur interactions with the office staff were rather disappointing.  It took a long time for email correspondences and to get answers when we had questions.  For the price you pay, you would think you'd receive better customer service, but I didn't care.  I just really wanted to walk down the aisle at City Hall.\n\nOn the day of, the staff were surprisingly really nice.  One of them offered me water as I waited to walk down the aisle.  He was a savior at that point, since I had forgotten to eat lunch and was incredibly thirsty.  He even found me a chair to sit down on while the bridal party procession took place.  Everything went smoothly and the venue was exactly what I wanted.  It was stunning, and nearly every guest commented on the beauty of SF City Hall.  Would I pay that amount of money again?  Definitely!  This building is one of the most breath-taking sites of San Francisco.  The grand staircase, the marble floors, the artistry... It's magnificent.  It was my dream wedding come true.", "author": "Penny N."}

This place was not hard to find, but finding parking nearby is a pain in the neck. We lucked out, and found parking adjacent to the building as someone was pulling out. \nGetting in here involves having to go through a metal detector. Once through, we were free to roam the large place and it's two stories. There were several displays, including a scale model of the building, a heart shaped panel of names of same-sex married couples, a big Christmas tree, and holiday decorations. Somewhere here is the office of the mayor, but due to the fact that we were here after normal business hours, he was not home. The hallways that make up the first and second floor are great to walk around, although just about all doors found along the hallways are locked. \nThe best sight within this place is the giant Christmas tree. It is decorated pretty well, and provides a beautiful centerpiece in an otherwise boring interior. The outside of the building is decorated in different lighting schemes, depending on the time of year or the occasion. There is a large lawn in front of the building, and there are many hippy groups always protesting or just loitering here.\nI'd recommend checking this place out during the holiday season.", "author": "William G."}

All worth it, for the money spent! I tell you, this was one of the most memorable wedding ceremonies that I ever attended.\n\nThere is a large underground parking structure, for private functions, there is a flat fee of $15.00 for parking, otherwise it's by the hour for a fee.\n\nI also found out that they do have tours of the facility, but the tours only happen on the weekdays.........I did not get a chance to tour the entire building, but if I ever get a chance to come back, I will surely take the tour of this grand place!", "author": "Fran C."}

Yelpers, I must tell you the story of the worst wedding ever (it was mine.) \n\nJanuary 14, 2010. It is a Thursday morning. I have been up all night sewing an alternative back into my wedding dress. After two hours of sleep, it's time to get up and head to the courthouse to get married. This is already a disaster waiting to happen. \n\nI get dressed and grab my makeup to do in the car. Driving from the East Bay to SF on a weekday morning is asking for trouble. We need to leave now.\n\nI know this is a mistake. I've been engaged for two years. We own a big house. We have pets. How am I going to get out of this? I'm not. There's a cancelation fee of less than $100 so clearly there is no turning back now. I'm 22 years old and I am dumb enough to think any of the aforementioned reasons, and especially the cancelation fee, are a true barrier to not ruining my life. \n\nI look down at my hand. I love my engagement ring. I don't want to wear any other piece of jewelry with it ever. I'm glad I decided against a wedding band. I feel like this is partially a good reason to go ahead and keep on toward City Hall. What was I thinking? \n\nOnly 6 people are allowed to attend the ceremony because it's a courthouse. My family doesn't approve and they're not there. Oh well, we're both the oldest of four so I guess it works out - we'll just have my fiance's two friends be our witnesses that we are required to bring.\n\nWell if this day couldn't get any more stressful, my fiance decides he's brining my least favorite person in the universe to City Hall - his overbearing Russian matriarch grandma. Kill me. We have to pick her up before we get to City Hall.\n\nShe criticizes my shoes. She also tells us that we're going to get divorced (she was right) & tells me I'm going to wear a family ring as my wedding band. I don't feel comfortable wearing a small car-priced ring. Plus it's hideous. Ugh.\n\nWe get to City Hall. Everyone oohs and awws over us as we walk inside. Grab a number and wait to be called.\n\nAs I lean against the pillars, I can't help but notice how stunning this place is. At least I'm getting married in the most gorgeous non-religious place I've ever been. \n\nAfter walking the halls with one of our witnesses for over an hour, our number is called. Thank God because I can't listen to his grandma nag me for another second.\n\nSurprisingly the rooms off the main hall are like every DMV in America. We go from station to station stamping and signing documents. I'm so screwed. The papers are signed, technically I'm married. They give us a packet about sexual health. This is weird. \n\nThere are other people getting married so we have to wait our turn to get married in the rotunda. Everyone looks so pretty. I feel sad. \n\nOur number is up. The officiant starts to speak. I zone out. What am I doing?\n\n\"Do you Stephanie...\" \"What? My name's not Stephanie\" I blurt out. The officiant reads my last name wrong and presumably thought it was my first name. This is so embarrassing. If they say the wrong name does that void the legality of the wedding?\n\nIt's time for the vows. \"Thank you so much, I'm his grandmother. I am from Russia and I live...\" Is this b---- really interrupting my wedding to tell the officiant about herself? \"Excuse me, can we finish this? It's not over\" I can't hide the vitriol in my voice between my clenched teeth. And why is she standing right next to him? I hate everything about this moment.\n\nI don't understand why only 6 people can attend when there is an Asian bus tour surrounding us and taking pictures of us throughout the 10 minute ceremony. \n\nI high five my new husband when it's over. I hate my life. Apparently this was the cue for the tour to stand in line to take pictures with us holding up the peace sign. At least they have pictures because I don't. Not that I'd want them.\n\nI am absolutely seething at his grandma. Of all times to stunt... On my ill-advised wedding day?! The officiant tells us we can get a copy of our license later but she has another ceremony to do.\n\nGod this place is pretty. It's actually breathtaking. I wish for a thousand things to be different but at least I picked such a gorgeous location. It's a beautiful disaster.\n\nIt's after 3. Traffic is going to be a nightmare. We have to be at our reception dinner with his whole family at 6 in Pleasanton.\n\nMy new husband (who is 27) decides it's a better idea to drive to South SF to wait out the traffic playing Call of Duty with his friends that accompanied us. It's totally necessary too because they're spending the night at our house after our dinner so that they can keep playing the game. We were so late.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-03", "description": "We got married here today! It was really great! I'd like to add some more detail on how it all \"goes down\" since it isn't written about that much, other than the one other Yelp review (thank you, btw).\n\nSo we made our license appointment (10:30am) and then wedding ceremony (noon) reservations online. We parked in the city hall garage; it's $2.50 an hour, and there were lots of open spaces. We had to go to the second level down, but no biggie and we got a space by the elevator. I can see how that parking lot could get dirty, etc. but it was fine for us.\n\nWe went into city hall, through security (they were friendly), got directions to room 168. The building is stunning inside.\n\nIn terms of the line for room 168, when you get there, you see a line leading into the place, which you wait in if you don't yet have a number. The line moved along fine. We waited there, gave the license paperwork, and then we got a number. Because I'd printed out the license application at home, we had it filled out when we showed up--that saved us one iteration through the line. No more than 5 minutes later, maybe less, they were calling our number, and we got the license. \n\nOur CA drivers licenses were sufficient ID. We filed for a confidential license, and they didn't ask for any paperwork proving cohabitation (which we had just in case), they just took our word for it, although of course under oath.\n\nSo then we got the license, and they said show up 5 minutes before noon and get another ticket. We went to chill at the spacious cafe (the bathroom is by here too), and chatted with our photographer. Had some time to take rotunda photos before our ceremony, and Royce from Blurred Line (BlurredLine?) Photography rocked it for us. We actually decided to get photos done at the last minute, and I'm glad we did. He was great and the pricing was very reasonable and transparent. He even came to the Embarcadero with us after, which was great.\n\nWent back to room 168 about 10 minutes before noon, got in line, got a ticket, hung out with our friends, and then we heard our number. We went in and met Virginia, who was to marry us. She was super cool. She clearly loves marrying people--she said she did it on a volunteer basis, twice a month.\n\nSo one thing with city hall marriages is that you don't really know where it'll happen in the building until \"the moment of.\" It so happened that at noon today there was Irish dancing in the rotunda, so we couldn't go there.\n\nWhat I learned, which would have been good to know before, was that if you can't use the rotunda, you can (usually? often?) go up to the fourth floor on one of the walkways overlooking the rotunda. We lucked out here and had another marriage ceremony right before us, and so while they were going first, my photographer scouted the two walk-ways and highly recommended the light in one of them being better (the less bright one, basically). So I asked if we could swing over to that one, and there we went.\n\nBTW I was worried the day before because the website says only 6 people can be with you. including babies, photographers, and so on. And with our last minute photographer decision, we had 6 + 2 photographers. My guess now is that it's mostly an issue if you're in the small room, because it seems like generally, even if the rotunda is a no-go, you can use one of the 4th floor walkways. In that case, there's room for more than 6, yes? Anyhow there was no \"headcount\" and we were just fine on the numbers front.\n\nFor the ceremony itself, Virginia led us through simple but profound wedding vows, which she knew by heart. She was absolutely \"present and connected\" with us. It was a really special moment--I'd read good things about the \"City Hall Marriage\" experience on Yelp, but this was REALLY good. wow. Thank you San Francisco.\n\nps: we went for lunch at Chaya on the Embarcadero after, and that worked out really well. Good food and service, nice views of the water, reasonable valet parking. I tried to find something nice for lunch walking distance from city hall but it wasn't to be so Chaya was a good bet.", "author": "Paul K."}

A couple of points I should hit on for those considering it s a venue ...\n1. Cost: this is a standout, it is CHEAP.  License and ceremony combined are under $300.  We figure, more $$$ for things like a honeymoon or a down payment, both of which last longer.\n2. Ease: not too tough, though warn guests they'll have to go through metal detectors.  Just be sure to book your license and ceremony appointments as soon as you can in the given window (separate appointments, and they fill up).\n3. Privacy: not so much.  It is a public space after all, and if they're busy weddings can go assembly-line style.  We were fine with it, but make your own informed choices.\n4. Ambiance: a mix of neoclassical and deco architecture.  Gorgeous.  The lighting is dark though (the peril of such a large space) so warn your photographer.\n5. Parking and logistics: this can be a nuisance.  There is parking underground at Civic Center Plaza (entrance on McAllister, north side of the park).  But if you can, take public transit, a cab, Uber, Lyft, skateboard, what have you.  SF traffic stinks, 24/7/365, always has and always will (right up there with death and taxes).\n6. Party size: the City Hall website will tell you it's 6 max, including a photographer.  However, within reason, this rule can be bent, as we had about 20 people.  It is a public space after all.  But be smart, and don't show up with a crowd that'd fill a Giants playoff game, as that will get you in hot water with the Sherriff's deputies faster than greased lightning.\nAll told we totally recommend it.  It was a great choice for us, and made our day wonderful.\nPS one final item: stay in town the day before and day of.  No sense commuting somewhere same day ... a wedding is stressful enough!", "author": "Patrick C."}

I was disappointed after a 5 hour journey to get here. There was no parking anywhere. ALL lots were full. After maybe an hour, I finally got a spot. I knew you had to make an appt. for the ceremony, but I didn't realize you had to make an appt. just to apply for a marriage license. Sure, I thought it would be an hour or so wait. I pumped the meter full of change. A nickel bought me a minute. A dime bought me a few more. I think the machine said $3.00 an hour but I was pumping it full of change like mad and there was a 2 hour time limit on it, so that part was a little stressful.\n\nThe building inside is BEAUTIFUL. But the amenities definitely felt lack luster. The cafe area had a few tables but there were barely any chairs. Half of the room was empty. Where they could have set up another 10 - 15 tables, they didn't. It really felt as if they didn't want to encourage anybody staying. That's fine. It's City Hall. They have stuff going on. \n\nWe got in line to apply for the marriage license and the lady asked \"Do you have an appt.?\". Uh oh. No we didn't. \"Well, we're booked for today and the rest of the week\" she said. UGH. Ok, so no sympathy for the out of towners. No \"I'm sorry you drove all that way, but we really can't make exceptions\". I would have liked to see some emotion. But it was more like DMV. \"NEXT IN LINE PLEASE\". \n\nI had already printed and filled out my marriage license form from online, gathered up birth certificates, passports etc. so I was prepared, but not prepared with an appt. I asked if it could be mailed in, and the answer was NO. This did however buy me more time to contemplate a name change. You have to decide what new middle and last name you'll be using as a married couple when you apply for the marriage license. No going back and making changes. \n\nSo, my advice: Make a reservation online.

We placed a hold on it with a deposit and come time that we paid the remaining deposit, an additional 300 dollar restoration fee was added. There was no conversation about this in the beginning and we were actually surprised that it showed up. Obviously we wouldn't cancel the venue because everyone already knew that our wedding ceremony was going to be there.\n\nFYI, this didn't really bother me but it was kind of expected. There are a lot of things that city hall does not allow. If things are not allowed on the contract and you don't see whether your specific detail of your wedding  is allowed, make sure you ask! \n\nVendors- only vendors with liability insurance are allowed. This basically wipes out a good portion of vendors out there. Make sure you ask the vendors if they have insurance.\n\nLastly, the one thing that did annoy me the most was on the wedding day. We were standing in front of the main entrance of city hall waiting to get in.  We could even see people standing inside however a little past our designated time schedule, they didn't even bother to tell us that we (the wedding party) and ALL our guests need to enter at the side of the building where the loading dock was. I had elderly guests that they wanted to send around the corner to enter the building. We argued with them for that because my 80+ year old grandparents already spent so much time walking to the venue that we did not want them to walk around the building to get in. That ate into the time that we were scheduled for building use and they are strict with the 2 hr time block.\n\nOtherwise, the three stars awarded was purely for the beauty of the building. I can't say that the operations of this building was exactly what I had in mind. More troublesome to work with. According to my wedding coordinator, they were a hit and miss with communication. There was a break in communication for myself since I was informed that my point of contact no longer worked there. I found out 2 weeks after no communication from city hall that she left employment there. \n\nCity hall is just a beautiful building without decorations. That was the best part because we hardly needed any decorations for this place.\n\nIf you decide to select this place for your event, weigh out your options before committing. For me It was worth it because I wanted to get married here. For others, the hassle may not be worth it. p.s. Book early if you want the 1-3pm ceremony slot on Saturdays, those book out fast.", "author": "Kimmy C."}

You can reserve your date up to 90 days in advance, and I'd recommend getting your license and doing the ceremony on different days, to eliminate as much stress as possible.\n\nYou meet your judge right before the ceremony, which is a little strange, but it all went smoothly -- I felt obligated to make sure that she was not putting the words \"obey\" in the vows and wouldn't be referring to us as \"man and wife.\"  She chuckled and assured me that no, neither of those things would happen.  (Bless her.)  The ceremony itself was less than 5 minutes. YAY!\n\nThe single drawback, at least to me, was that there were tons of tourists videotaping and photographing our ceremony!

Now before you think I'm some high-falutin', hill-rollin' sugar daddy with deep pockets, I have to clarify I was just a lowly volunteer picking up completed donation cards at the banquet. In fact, I think people were expecting me to bus tables, but I don't touch food that doesn't go in my mouth. Know what I mean?\n\nIf you haven't seen it, the voluminous rotunda is really a beautiful Beaux-Arts masterwork with its grand staircase and beautiful columns. A lot of people were dressed to the nines that night, including most of the local political celebrities since it was a black-tie occasion. It was a no-show for Newsom for reasons unfortunately too clear this past week. The rotunda was given lots of colorful lighting, and there were tables filled with fancy-schmantzy silent auction items. And I couldn't keep myself away from all the little mini-desserts.\n\nNow I do have a genuine interest in ensuring civil liberties for all of us, but truth be told, I was there because I knew Jennifer Holliday was performing after dinner. I saw her 25 years ago when she played Effie in \"Dreamgirls\" on Broadway, and the memory of her landmark performance still sends goose pimples down my spine. They set up the elevated base of the staircase as the stage and she came down all those steps to thunderous applause.\n\nShe dropped nearly 200 pounds since I saw her perform in 1982, and her voice was just as incredible as ever - a roof-raising roar that almost blew the top of the rotunda off. She generously sang five songs, but of course she had to sing HER song. Her introduction put her in pure diva mode...\"They tried to steal my song away from me. I fought for Effie, and I fought for this song. And nobody's gonna take it from me 'cause...I'm tellin' you I'm not going...\"\n\nThose goose pimples came back in full force, and I was lucky enough to be standing about 15 feet away from her this time. But she didn't end with her signature song...she finished with a gospel-fueled cover of Celine Dion's \"Love Can Move Mountains\" complete with a line of chorus boys in black leotards flailing white satin sheets on the stairs. There were even two adagio-style dancers doing their dance club moves next to her...kinda like what Jack did next to Jennifer Lopez when she performed at Karen's wedding reception on \"Will and Grace\".\n\nIt was a great evening...in a great building.

I didn't know any of the girls but all were so gorgeoous and happy that I wanted to go up to all of them and congratulate them. They were all taking wedding photos inside cause it is just that gorgeous. So gorgeous that I think I found the location for my wedding. I am not the kinda girl that gets super excited about weddings but this place sparks something inside of me.  \n\nThe inside is just gorgeous!!!!! The tour was free and I learned actually a lot. It will probably be a little dry for those who are not into history or arcituecture. It was very intresting about how they have pretty much earthquake proofed the place. Also the dome is taller than the nations capital. OMG!!!\n\nI love this place I took about a million photos every one of them is gorgeous.", "author": "Cris F."}

We left a 2 hour gap between our appointments, and I was glad to have that time to do my makeup and change clothes. \n\nThe ceremony was wonderful. Those with negative stereotypes/preconceptions about city hall weddings should definitely leave them at the door! Our officiant, Valerie Walker, was so kind. The introduction and vows she gave were very beautiful, and she seemed so warm and so genuinely happy for us. We had one witness, a good friend who also took pictures for us. A *lot* of tourists took pictures of us from the edge of the rotunda, but they didn't bother us at all -- the ceremony still felt wonderfully intimate and happy, and they all clapped for us when we kissed, which was sweet.

I checked my calender and I was actually in town, and said yes. I thought, well, this will be one of those 5-minute-after-getting-the-license-at-City-Hall type weddings. Not sure why I was invited. \n\nWoo hooo, was I Wrong! \n\nThis wedding was like no other wedding I have ever attended and like not other I probably ever will attend again. It was a once in a lifetime experience for all 100+ guests.  They weren't just getting married at City Hall, they were renting out City Hall for 6 hours!\n\nIt was a black and white affair, with friends and family flying in from Berlin, Munich, Greece, L.A., New York, MIami, Hawaii plus the local friends from Atherton, Carmel, and the Nob HIll neighbors! \n\nWe entered city hall and were welcomed by a quartet of trumpeteers playing several fanfares of majestic revery as we were handed champagne flutes. \n\nThen we were invited to enter the gorgeous Rotunda under the gold gilded dome, a cavernous, breathtaking sight with its huge marble center staircase. White orchids were everywhere. The Starlight Strings octet played beautiful songs like \"Some Enchanted Evening\". \n\nPanis Anglicus - a beautiful aria was sung by Leslie in an enchanting soprano operatic voice. \n\nBiset's Habanera from the Opera Carmen played as our beautiful bride, Suzanne, in her stunning red formal chiffon gown and her dashing groom, Dimitri, in his black tuxedo, descended the main stairs, moving past a double helix ring statue especially made for them. \n\nNella Fantasia was read by Tina and sung like a nightingale by Leslie.\n\nPablo Neruda's \"And Now You're Mine\" was read with heartfelt warmth by Susan and Jorg. \n\nThe service was delivered with such grace by Hank. \n\nAnd the bride and groom, well into middle age, were glowing and bubbling with love for each other at every moment, every turn. WIth warm glances, gentle laughter, near tearing at their vows. They tried to smooch 3 times before they were supposed to seal the deal!\n\nIt was beautiful!\n\nAnd after this enchanting ceremony, the party started in the same rotunda after a receiving line in the landing above the marble stairs and a mixing of more refreshments and fabulous finger food as the tables were being set below.\n\nAs we were seated, Candace, who flew in from Kahala, Hawaii, sang the always lovely Hawaiian Wedding Song in Hawaiian. So beautiful. I love that song.  \n\nAnd as the meal was served, HIlary Cole, who flew in from NYC's Birdland, sang several jazz tunes inspired by love. She was the only professional singer of the 3, and she was gorgeous and had a smooth voice and charming personality. She is big in Japan, too. \n\nA great heartfelt speech by son-in-law David, and plenty of good food and drink catered by the excellent Melons catering.\n\nLater the disco came out and a nice mix of songs got the now \"feeling happy\" guests cutting the marble and lifting their spirits with pleasure.\n\nThe night went on until 11pm, and everyone had a unique, once in a lifetime, joyous and memorable experience. This was mostly made not by the opulence of the ceremony, but by the warm, sincere grace of the charming couple who genuinely made everyone attending, guests and help, feel close to them as they shared the happiest day of their lives with family and friends.\n\nI knew the bride, but it is my sister who has known her for 2 decades and has been her Muse of Muses. I was my sister's date but felt honored to be there and see the love radiate out from this happy couple.  \n\nDespite everything appearing overwhelming well planned and executed, I did hear about some of the minor issues, since my sister was asked to assist in the production. But none of the minor flaps would ever detract from this fantastic wedding, made all the more special by the beautiful venue that is San Francisco's City Hall Rotunda. \n\nTrust me, this was not the normal SF City Hall wedding after getting the license ceremony.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-04", "description": "My hubby and I recently had our dream wedding at San Francisco City Hall.  When I say dream wedding, I truly mean it. For 1 day, I felt like a real princess.  Our wedding was PERFECT, and it wasn't over the top with florals or extensive decor. Why? Simply because SF City Hall doesn't need it.\n\nWe rented out SF City Hall for Saturday, 09.10.11.  Due to the 'specialty' date, as referred to by many of our vendors, we rented it out far in advance. I suggest you do the same if you decide to host your wedding here.  You can place a 'hold' without a deposit and if anyone else wants to book your date, City Hall will call you and give you the option of submitting a deposit or letting go of the hold. (FYI - the deposit is 75% of total rental fee and must be paid in Cash or Check)\n\nWe explored many different beautiful options like the Asian Art Museum, Ritz Carlton, Bently Reserve, Cavallo Point, The Fairmont, Four Seasons, StoneTree Golf Club, Flood Mansion, Omni Hotel, Sir Francis Drake Hotel, Julia Morgan Ballroom, de Young Museum, etc. \n\nThe moment we walked into SF City Hall both of our jaws dropped and we knew it was the place for us.  We were immediately wowed by the marble floors, intricate details in architecture, and the grand stairway of the rotunda.  I instantly pictured our wedding ceremony, seating, tables for our reception, and all the beautiful Tiffany Blue accents our day would bring.\n\nOur wedding started at 5:30pm sharp with a 30-minute ceremony at the rotunda.  After the ceremony, guests were escorted to the Mayor's Balcony for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres.  During the cocktail reception, our caterer and wedding coordinator teamed up to change the ceremony decor to dinner tables.  Everything happened quickly and smoothly.  Around 7:15 guests were directed to the elevators and they made their way back down to the rotunda for dinner and dancing.  Our sweetheart table was placed on the platform of the grand staircase.  We had an amazing view of all tables and all of our guests had a clear view of us.  I hate it when I go to weddings and I can't see what's happening due to the poor layout of the venue.  This was certainly not the case at SF City Hall.  Plus, the beautiful interior made a spectacular backdrop for photos.\n\nWe had a photo booth near the South Light Court.  It was a great location to keep away from the aesthetics of the wedding celebration but easy for guests to stumble to after several cocktails.  Our all-night Open Bar was a big hit! =P\n\nI will warn you that City Hall is extremely uptight with events.  At our initial meeting, prior to putting down a deposit, we were told that they're more laid back than other venues. (ie. Asian Art Museum - even more strict than SF City Hall)  SF City Hall was not laid back at all and several issues came up as we got closer to the wedding date.  I completely understand because it is a government building.  They have to abide by different regulations than a typical hotel or restaurant but it would have been nice to hear all of this from the get go rather than a surprise with only a couple weeks to go.  They require an ALL VENDORS site visit where they'll basically tell everyone the do's and don'ts of the venue.  They also have to PRE-APPROVE several factors of your event.  We received many preliminary approvals but had to go through it again 2 weeks prior to the wedding. In our case it was Unity Candles (used during the ceremony), kneeling bench (used during the ceremony), photo booth placement, loose diamond decor on tables, votives, and a few other things.  It surprised me that they were really strict w/our wedding only because they've allowed New Year's Eve parties and raves.  How could our small wedding even compare to the madness of these events?  \n\nSF City Hall requires that SF Police and the Fire Marshall are present the entire time so that's another big expense, on top of the rental fee.  Insurance is also required and you can purchase through City Hall but if you do your research like we did, you can save some $.  We obtained the same insurance for 1/3 of what they charged.\n\nOur wedding concluded at midnight.  It was beyond beautiful and our guests had a fabulous time.  Many of them said it was the best wedding they had ever been to and I agree, though I am biased. ;)  \n\nIf you're tight on $$$, SF City Hall also has an affordable wedding package for only $4,000 for a 2-hour rental.", "author": "Nikki C."}

If you've never been you need to check it out. The architecture, columns, marble floors and details are out of this world and amazing.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a half star deduction is because it is a pricey place to rent, close to $15K in our situation and there is a lot of required paperwork, but it was well worth it. \n\nAll of our guest said it was the most beautiful, elegant wedding they have ever attended. Check out our wedding video and you will see how beautiful this venue can be.\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/41986990\n\nWhat's nice about City Hall is it can somehow hold 300 - 500 people and yet still feel intimate.

We knew we'd be having a civil ceremony, and it would definitely be happening in a city hall as we didn't want to fuss about with arrangements and things, especially with us living an ocean apart at the time.\n\nWe had NO idea just how brilliant SF's City Hall was.  I guess we were both picturing our wedding happening in one of those generic concrete City Halls that are the norm in the US.  Imagine our surprise when I was looking for marriage license info and saw the photos of the glorious City Hall building!  I just couldn't believe it...it was like a beautiful, European Beaux-Arts building but in San Francisco, and used as their City Hall, of all things!  We were both over the moon.\n\nWe married in the main hall, under the grand rotunda.  Our officiant was lovely...TJ, I believe was how he introduced himself to us.  Very nice guy, and seemed to really enjoy his job.  In fact, everyone working at the City Hall when we were there seemed quite lovely and willing to help people with anything from baffling paperwork to walking directions to the museum.\n\nI'd advise taking care of your license details in advance of the day, so that you can show up and just do the ceremony without fussing about.  Appointments are available for this part of the process. That said, it's not a difficult or lengthy ordeal--just a matter of filling out a rather short form and showing identification, and then paying the fees for the license and the ceremony itself.  We did this the day before our wedding, and then spent the next hour or so wandering around City Hall admiring everything.\n\nIt's probably also wise to reserve the date/time for your ceremony in advance, though again, not entirely necessary unless you have your heart set on a specific date/time, or you're traveling and can't wait around for an open ceremony time.  I believe the earliest you can book is 3 months in advance of the date you want.", "author": "Tuesday F."}

For those of you coming from the East Coast or hail from the great continent of Europe, of course this is nothing compared to your great cathedrals and all that magnificent historical buildings from where you come from, but, well, we're at the West Coast here, and this IS something of value to us... \n\nIf you have seen the movie \"Milk,\" detailing the struggle of the gay activist Harvey Milk, well, this is THE place where he made that great speech to the supporting crowd.

What can I say, he's good looking and extremely charismatic.  And he looks even better delivering all of this from the grand staircase; image consultants contracted to him, doing a good job.\n\nA fantastic venue thanks to the neoclassical columns with an interior stabilized with massive granite and marble finishes.  No chintz here since I personally think anything gilded fake gold is cheesy but marble usually equates to a bit of class.  This definitely adds a bit of renaissance (and reminds me of the cherry wood tables with marble tops that my mum had all over the house, blah) and the stairs makes for a grand entrance to any speech, event, setup, foundation for the presenters.

Wonder why the buildings situated around City Hall seem to flow with one another in terms of architectural parallels?  Excerpt from the site state \"The architect was Arthur Brown Jr., who also designed San Francisco's Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and 50 United Nations Plaza.\"  Hence no breaks to the visual eye.\n\nI've been here for several venues and each time, they were methodically planned and the spaces efficiently utilized for maximum exposure.  It has a large capacity and the layout makes for easy mingling, although the hard rock surfaces carry laughter to the other side and heels echo continuously throughout the halls.  \n\nHands down, a lovely building during the day and even more so at night with the lights radiating the dome. Take a seat across the street and let the perfectly lined trees channel your view for a perspective.   \n\nA true SF landmark.", "author": "Miika M."}

I have lived in the bay area for over 30 years, and this was the first time I went inside the building.  I have been missing a treasure all these years.  This building ranks among the greatest works of civic architecture I have ever seen.  \n\nThe interior is dominated by the rotunda that reaches up to the giant dome.  According to the statistics I saw, is one of the tallest in the world and is taller than the dome over the US Capitol building in Washington DC.   There is a grand staircase from the first to second floor. This staircase was the scene of several weddings that were happening one after the other (it is a grand setting for a wedding!).  There is marble everywhere and grand carved plaster decorations on the archways and inner dome.  The second, third, and forth floors are open to the rotunda, giving many different viewing angles to appreciate all the architectural features as you explore the building. \n\nThe dome is of interesting construction.  The outer dome is what is seen from the outside of the building.  The inner dome is in two parts, a lower part that has a large center opening, and an outer dome that surrounds the lower part and covers it.  Light filters from windows behind the lower part up and over it, reflecting on the upper part, giving an indirect lighting effect at the top of the dome.  \n\nThe Board of Supervisors chamber was closed when we were there, but you can look in the crack between the locked double doors and get a narrow view of a magnificent interior of carved wood walls and ceiling.\n\nThis building was completed in 1915, replacing the city hall that was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake.  \n\nAfter the 1989 earthquake, there was severe damage to this building.  The city wisely decided that when restoring and strengthening that it would be restored to its original grandeur.  On the lower level, near the Grove Street entrance, there is a photo exhibit showing the massive reconstruction and restoration effort. \n\nThe building used to house court rooms on the upper floors, but most of these have been converted to offices; however a few of them are used as hearing rooms and retain what appears to be original appearances of the old court rooms. \n\nIf you enjoy beaux-arts architecture, you will enjoy wandering around this grand public building.  A good destination for tourists (even local ones).  It is only a short walk from the Civic Center Bary/Muni station.", "author": "Mike M."}

It was great while it lasted since it was nullified a few months later by the supreme court.\n\nMy girlfriend, my best friend and I left So-Cal and drove 6 hrs to get here and waited over 8hrs before we were able to know if the marriages were going to be allowed. The city employees even stayed after closing hours to complete the marriages performed that day so hundreds of couples were able to be married.  A few weeks later, the marriages were no longer allowed to be performed and the rest was history. \n\nIf you've been to SF but have never set foot in this place, I suggest you should.  I love the architecture and the long marble staircase that lead you to the Rotunda where I was married.  It was a crazy scene.  I had a news camera in my face and at the time I was afraid that my folks would have seen it in the news, but the camera man said that they were filming for Japan. Whew! I thought. (OK, that didn't last long because somehow my mom caught me in the news anyway. Oh well.)  If ya don't know, now you know!\n\nThe vibe and buzz around the city was just so welcoming.

The place is gorgeous and is a short walk from my condo, so it was a given that my husband and I would choose to say our \" I do's\" here. We spoke to the event planning committee about our small gathering and was given the price of a mere $1,400 dollars for an hour (anytime between the hours of 1-5 on a choice of two different floors..4th or 2nd) including chairs (but nothing else) for our 40ish guests. \n\nWhen inquiring about our event, I was told I would be receiving an email about the services with a write-up of our contract. I waited more than a week and got nothing. After I called and asked the second time, there was no information on file for us. Right after our second conversation, though, I was emailed right away with all the required documents. \n\nThe day of the wedding, I was greeted kindly and given a room where I could await my walk down the aisle. They even placed a mirror in the room for last minute touch-ups. \n\nThe set-up for the service wasn't finished until around 10 minutes before the actual ceremony started. In the corner of the room, a rack of chairs were left and not taken away until all my guests had arrived. I would have liked this to have been a bit quicker. \n\nI wasn't told that we had to hold off starting our music until our exact hour started (even though our guests were already seated and everything was ready to go). I found this a bit silly, considering we hadn't started the actual ceremony. We had violinist there to merely entertain our guests that had arrived early. My groomsmen was told to have them stop, but I wasn't told why.. so there was a big confusion and back and forth (poor musicians). \n\nAt the end of our hour, there was an announcement made over all of City Hall saying our wedding was over (a polite way to kick us out). Funny thing, because we had already left the area... and were taking pictures in different areas of City Hall. I found this a bit rude, but hey... you do what you have to do. \n\nThe photo opportunities were amazing in City Hall. Every corner provides something beautiful as a backdrop. \n\nHERE'S THE REALLLLL KICKER: \n\nCITY HALL LOST OUR MARRIAGE LICENSE! Yes, that's right. It was gone! For days we left our immigration lawyer waiting for us to provide proof we had actually exchanged vows. After going in twice and even having our officiant contact all his connections, we had him meet us there. I was livid by this point...\nI was told there would be NO WAY to get a copy of an affidavit (and we were meeting our lawyer just a couple of house later) until Monday when the lady that signs them would be in her office. After arguing with the lady at the counter, she sent over the manager. I told him EXACTLY what I thought about this situation, and he promptly found me someone else who could sign. \n\nThe super funny thing is, our lawyer told us just the week before, a couple came in and handed over their marriage license. After looking it over, the lawyer discovered it was for THE WRONG PEOPLE! City Hall gave someone else's marriage license to this couple. Wow, they disorganized.\nWith that said, looking at the bigger picture, our wedding was beautiful, our guests were happy, and at the end of the day, so were we... but not without a couple of headaches along the way.", "author": "emily h."}

We had never been, but were amazed by how beautiful City Hall was in pictures.  We decided to make it more special by getting dressed up and hiring a photographer for a couple hours.  I ended up being nervous about having to deal with two appointments on the day of our ceremony so we got our license in San Diego and brought it with us.  After our license appointment in San Diego, I grew apprehensive about a City Hall wedding in general - we really wanted something beautiful.\n\nI'm so glad we did not change our plans because the building is quite stunning!

We met our photographer and checked in about 15 minutes early; everyone was very friendly.  Despite having made an appointment (online which is super easy), they were running behind on ceremonies and very politely informed us of this.  Because we had our photographer with us, we used the time to take pictures and from that point on it felt as if we were the only two people in the entire building.

Each chocolate described the country that you would be sitting in during the reception!! ( Verryyy classyyyy)\n\nWe we then greeted into a very unique sushi bar in the middle of the room. Sashimi, Hand Rolls, Tuna, MMMMMMM The sushi was comparable to Sushi Zo in Los Angeles!!\n\nMini-Burgers and Curried chicken skewers every bite a different experience.\n\nReception:\nSalad: Dungeness Crab and Soba Noodle Salad: At first my eyes could not get over how many colors and smells were hitting my palate. But after the first bite it was delish!!!\n\nEntree: Petite Fillet Mignon & lobster Tail with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Vegetables with Red Wine Sauce.- I unfortunately am not a lobster person so my buddy Andrew consumed that one for me. ( He said mine was the best go figure lol) The Fillet Mignon was truly tasty, the first bite was like butter, the next few bites we not able to compare.\n\nDessert: Wedding Cake\nPetite Desserts- I Have to say my all time favorites were the Red Velvet and the Lemon Curd.\n\nThis was a wedding that will make the record books for being not only modern but traditional as well. Dragon Dancers and Photo Booths, it was a magical and entertaining night.", "author": "Terell S."}

I heard great things about this place after reading so many great reviews I expected to be giving the city hall at least 4 starts. It's not the case, not at all did not have the best experience here. I arrived barely five minutes before 5 pm to submit my DBA application and pay the fees. I had an application ready along with the check to submit the required paperwork. I drove from the East Bay as soon as I could because I work during the day, I tried hard to make it before five pm. Unluckily, I could not submit the stuff because the staff said that they were about to close. I wonder if they want to stop taking people at 455 pm, why don't they close at 455 pm? If they close at 5 then intakes should be accepted until five pm and not until four fifty five pm. The most annoying thing it was that all the staff members starting asking the receptionist to stop taking intakes nearly ten minutes before five pm. They should be more considerate, many people go there to start a new business, it does not mean that we are all millionaires that come come back any day at any time. I know that 5 pm is the time they close and I do not expect them to take people after than hour, but they should not turn people away before that time.", "author": "Pepi R."}

It's gorgeous and since it's a public building you're free to go to the various floors to take pictures. \nI had my wedding civil ceremony here recently and it went very smoothly. We registered with the office and then headed over to the rotunda to for the ceremony. \nYou can't book the rotunda ahead of time because of city events that might come up so you request it on the day of when you arrive. You can select the top of the rotunda, between the set of stairs on the staircase or in front of the mayor's office.  I personally think the top of the rotunda is the best option so you get a lot of the rotunda's detail and a view of the entire city hall. \nThe officiant was pleasant and the ceremony was quick - probably just around 5 minutes. Quick and easy-peasy. \nWhile the city website specifies that only 6 people (inclusive of photographers), they're not strict on this. It seems to be more like a precautionary message to avoid huge crowds. We had a total of 8 people but I'm sure if there were a bit more people it would be acceptable. \nCan't wait to see my photographer's pictures!", "author": "Tanya N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-09", "description": "I noticed that there are no reviews about Business Registration, so I thought I would post my recent experience.  It was surprisingly positive overall, but if you are looking for insight on how to avoid the long lines coupled by unavoidable disorganization that always accompanies government processes -- here's what I have learned:\n  \nThe Business Registration instructions on the .gov website will tell you that you must first pay the tax collector upon registering your business BEFORE you can register your Fictitious Business Name.  Well, it's a little more involved than that.  Luckily, I went mid-day on a Wednesday and was out of there within 30 minutes (a personal best!), but were there appropriate lines waiting for me, it certainly would have been one of those \"But I didn't know I had to wait in THAT line FIRST!\" kind of disasters.  Here's your guide to efficiency:\n\nWhen you arrive at the main entrance at City Hall, proceed on the main floor to the back left (SW) corner to Room 140, the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector.  When you get to Room 140, beware of instructions that tell you to wait in line (btw, we had all of our paperwork filled out and ready to go).  Instead, when you enter the room, you will see a long, low wooden desk to your right covering almost the entire length of the right wall.  START THERE.  \"I am trying to register my business.\"  The desk person will direct you to someone behind you in a cubicle.  Despite their condescending and sour demeanor, work with the cubicle person as they give you instructions, send you to wait in line to make a payment with check, cash (in person) or money order ONLY (no debit card option at this stage), and then run back to the same cubicle person with the receipt, and she will give you paperwork to submit to the County Clerk's Office (and hopefully devoid of snarky remarks).\n\nNext, proceed along the back wall of the building to the NW corner to Room 168, the County Clerk's Office.  First you must get in line to take a number to wait in line.  Asinine, I know, but remain focused!  There is a velvet rope leading up to the office entrance.  Stand in that line behind the black floor line.  The other people bypassing you are responding to their numbers being called.  Upon entering the County Clerk's Office, show them your paperwork from the Tax Collector, take a number, and wait outside the office.  Once your number is called, you go back inside and pay your fee for registering your Fictitious Business Name with cash (in person), debit card, money order, cashier's check, or personal check.  They will give you a receipt and instruct you on how to publish it.  (I went with The Recorder - $44 total for publishing your FBN once a week for four consecutive weeks and they file completion with the County Clerk's Office for you and send you confirmation for everything.)\n\nSo, what did we learn from this trip?  Go mid-day (weird, I know), mid-week.  Ask someone if you are in the right place before standing in a long line - it could be the wrong one!  Have your paperwork completed in advance.  Check, cash or money order will get you paid and on your way.  And be grateful you can pursue a business you LOVE!", "author": "Cuban B."}

I've never seen so many loving gay couples wanting to get married in my life. On that fateful day, I clasped my hands together praying that one day I was going to meet the man of my dreams. And, I swear, it was at that moment a black tinted car drove up the curb and out pops Gavin, our mayor! Under the beautiful, sunny sky and gleaming City Hall dome, he flashes his charismatic smile and shakes my hand (he had hands as soft as Chinese silk, btw). I was stunned by the moment and all I could stutter was, 'Thank you, Mr Mayor, for allowing love to prevail.' I'll never forget that day - it was a perfect day, even if I didn't get hitched.\n\nInside is the grand staircase where I witnessed the SF Boys Chorus sing like angels at the Mayor's inauguration, before being whisked off to sing for Prez Obama. Well, I guess if you can sing like angels the Heavens will open...or something like that. \n\nOn the 4th floor are hearing rooms where the different Commissions go about their business and the public gets their opportunity to voice their issues on public record (cameras are pointed at the podium and the Commissioners' bench which can be viewed on SFgov TV, Channel 26). I love the balconies on the 4th floor with the giant arched windows to let the sun flow in and the giant French-style urns that ornate the rail. This is the location for the filming of 'Milk' with Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. \n\nOn the 2nd floor, you can find the individual Supervisor's office with their names emblazoned on the doors.  I like passing by Supe Bevan Dufty's door - such a nice guy and I think, overall, he is good for City gov't.  The top of the grand staircase leads you to the double doors into the Board of Supervisor's hearing chambers; the walls are made of a rare Manchurian oak. On the opposite end is Rm 200, the Mayor's office. \n\nThe first floor you'll find the Tax Collector, Neighborhood Services, Assessor-Recorder's offices.  I've seen some amazing transformations of City Hall for parties with golden trumpeting angels, luxe velvet draperies, dramatic lightings, in like 3 hours flat.  And there are tons of newly wed couples and their friends in some snappy clothes.  I love seeing their beaming faces, one of which was Marilyn's, decades ago.  Maybe one day I'll even see Toni Collette having her 'Muriel's Wedding' moment, or some version of it, with the quintessential ABBA music running through my head.\n\nDon't forget the basement.  It's not what you think.  They actually treat their walls here like a gallery and display incredible things like Billy Graham's concert collection of photos (Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Cure) and various other up-and-coming artists - provocative.  Currently, they have these giant photos of offices with office workers.  I won't bore you with my interpretations, but it does have visual impact.\n\nI believe City Hall is most beautiful at night, with its dome and columns all lit up - a very stately building. The dome is an echo of Les Invalides in Paris (Napoleon's burial site). The exterior is Sierra granite and much of the interior is California marble and Indiana sandstone. The building is in the Beaux Arts ('fine art') style, similar to the other buildings that collectively make up the Civic Center Historic District with the park in the center (they now have outdoor cafes to enjoy the sun). Across the park is the Asian Art Museum and the Main Library, and along McAllister is the California Supreme Court, where they ruled the validity of Prop 8. \n\n5 stars to City Hall for being a significant part of a world-class city!", "author": "Roger R."}

We were warned that the Chamber of Commerce was right behind us and that sometimes a meeting would end and some clueless people would walk right in between a couple during their ceremony. Thank goodness that didn't happen to us! \n\nThe judge was very direct but at the same time seemed genuinely happy to marry us. She told us beforehand that we would probably laugh, cry and talk to each other throughout the ceremony; that sometimes the rings don't fit right away and to not take that as a sign of bad luck, that we might be too shy all of a sudden to look directly at each other during the ceremony and that she didn't mind if we stared at her instead. \n\nAll those things happened and damn right, I bawled.

My eyes and my heart were completely set on having this as our wedding venue and we have no regrets whatsoever. \n\nThe licensing and civil ceremony process were extremely efficient. Everyone was friendly and you didn't get the sensation that you were at a \"Sign and wed, NEXT!\" type of place. In retrieving a certified marriage certificate, I was in and out within 20 minutes.\n\nElsie, the Events Manager for City Hall, was great to work with. A bit intimidating at first, but she helps make your dreams come true and works with you to plan a well-executed ceremony and reception here. Kathryn, one of her assistants, is extremely detail oriented and was a blessing to have during the entire planning process. She coordinated with my vendors on all the required material and documents they needed to perform services for us and returned all phone calls and answered any questions or concerns in a timely manner if not immediately. \n\nThe deputy sheriffs were friendly, helpful, had a great sense of humor, and were extremely efficient at getting all 200 of our guests through security.  \n\nSome advice: Book your licensing and civil ceremony appointments early so you can get AM times. The first appointment is best. It's quiet in the morning and you can pick wherever you want to have your ceremony. No one is there to fight over it with you and you get privacy. Tourists don't start pouring in until later.\n\nDrawbacks: 27 page contract is a pain to go through. Rental fees for a private event using this space is pretty high at the base rate, but still reasonable for what you get compared to other Bay Area venues. It's GORGEOUS! Allow for a few $K more for security at your event in addition to the base rate. You can rent out the space earlier by the hour if you need more set up time. Alternatively, you can get a wedding package for just your ceremony for about $3K. It can become a bit dark at night so looking into supplemental lighting is a good idea. Acoustics is a concern here, but a good sound company can help you rearrange the logistics. When you do your rehearsal ceremony, you have to share the space with others. \n\nThey allowed us to bring our own alcohol and did not require us to select vendors off a preferred list.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

And sure enough, that's what I did.  Trying to find a venue for you ceremony was one of the most painful part of planning a wedding.  Calling and e-mailing all kinds of places for availability and debating whether you want to have an outdoor or indoor wedding.  But once I looked into actually having a private wedding inside City Hall for a few hours, I jumped on the chance of doing such a thing.  I only had one day to have my wedding (my mom looked at the chinese calendar and said this is the best Saturday to get married out of the months I've given her).  I called City Hall events and inquired on my date and they said..maybe...someone else was considering it as well. The only way for me to guarantee myself for this day is run down there and put a challenge on the date (and give them a $3000 deposit now).  So I did it, put my challenge in place, and follow-up in 2 business days.  Voila, I had my date on hold.  Two weeks before the wedding, I bug the events people about my 2 hour wedding and I basically huff it over to meet with Jenna to go over logistics of what I need, what I can do, and what I cannot do.  And the one thing that bugged me, they told me to tell my vendors to show proof that they have some kind of insurance and forward to City Hall before they can gain entry to the building and do their work on the day of the wedding.   Luckily, my vendors were quick to get that done so I wouldn't have to worry about it.  On the day of the wedding, everything went smoothly except for the fact that whoever was supposed to be there to supervise, wasn't there.  Instead, I had some substitute day of event coordinator who couldn't lead the bride (me!!!) to the elevators from the basement to the 4th floor.   Trust me, it was not fun walking in 3 inch heels for 10 minutes trying to get to the elevators.  Otherwise, my event went according to schedule...got in, did our thing, got out for the 2 hour period that I rented it for.   \n\nOverall, City Hall is a beautiful site to have a wedding.  Although it wasn't cheap to rent it, it was all worthwhile.  You have City Hall to your self and don't have to worry too much about strangers getting into your pictures.  On a sunny day and a good camera, you can take beautiful pictures in the rotunda.  Also, the rotunda has good acoustics for a string trio or quartet to play.  Unfortuantely, I just feel that 2 hours isn't enough time to rent for your wedding.", "author": "Lisa W."}

The renovations that have been done to restore and enhance the structure is outstanding. Yet the politics and the antics inside at times is less than inspiring. \n\nWalking through the main hall to view the interior of the dome is awesome. Take the time to look and yes, walk up or down those grand stairs. Just be sure to keep your balance. They are very wide and marble can be slippery. \n\nOn the main floor there is always some kind of display or exhibit, at the main lobby or in either the North or South Light Court. \n\nPresently at the grand staircase there is a sound exhibit, displaying all the sounds of the city, such as cable car bells, birds, water, etc. Yeah, it's kind of different. But as a new form of art it is rather unique. \n\nI guess this is when its appropriate to say, \"only in San Francisco!\" Ha! \n\nAll visitors must go through a security check so at busy times be patient. It is all part of the routine. Since City Hall is also open to tourists, dress code is casual. \n\nYet if attending a hearing or meeting with officials it is always best to dress up a bit, like business casual style. \n\nWhen attending a hearing or one of those long meetings it is important to try to be on time, otherwise you will not get a seat. Staff and protocol is very strict about that. No one is allowed to stand. \n\nYet, when there is an overflow, the staff opens up a room with a large TV screen monitor to accommodate the extra people. \n\nActually, sometimes that is much better. Because you can really see all the officials presiding as they speak. And, with a place to sit that is much less stress. Try standing and taking notes in an over crowded room with little or no air conditioning, no fun! \n\nThe view from the upper floors is impressive, especially from an architecture point of view.

My gut reaction is to despise it because I don't particularly like its architecture.  But I've lived in San Francisco for a few years now, and although I still don't really like how the building looks, I'm glad it's as large as it is and that it's in such a prominent place.  Basically, City Hall looks about right for the importance of San Francisco relative to the state, the country, and the world.  \n\nI often ride the 21-Hayes right next to City Hall, and tourists inevitably ask what the beautiful building is.  I'm always proud to say it's City Hall.  I've had quite a few tourists ask me whether it's the California state capitol.  See, San Francisco is cool like that.  We're only the fourth most populous city in the state (after L.A., San Diego, and San Jose [!]), but we don't feel like it.  I'm more partial to L.A.'s city hall, but San Francisco's is perfectly located amid some pretty important institutions.\n\nInside, it's an interesting building.  It would be neat to see a wedding here.  The second floor hallways feel like an old elementary school, but the entire first floor is interesting in a marble kind of way.

I've been to a number of parties there, and they do well with large events when companies rent the entire place for evenings.\n\nAside from that, the purpose of any City Hall is to provide service. And the service you get there is top notch.\n\nI needed to get a Passport renewed for my son when I realized a week before a trip that his had expired the month before. SF City Hall can take care of you if you have three business days before your trip, and you can then pick the finished passport up at the San Francisco Passport Agency.  If you have at least four business days, I'd suggest going directly to City Hall, since the line there was not terribly long, and the service was good. You take a number and a seat, then get called up to a desk where you can sit while the person across from you takes care of everything, which beats waiting in line and doing it at a window at the Passport Agency. Also, parking in the lot across the street came out to $3. I was third in line when I got there, and there was nobody behind me when I was being served, so getting there close to noon might mean there won't be a line.\n\nOnce you finish up at City Hall, you will have a \"Will Call\" slip to take to the Passport Agency (US Gov't agency, not City Hall) between 3 and 4pm on the day it's ready, or between 10 am and 4 pm on later business days. If you have the time, the big advantage of not going at 3 pm is traffic. You could also have it all taken care of at the Passport Center if you have less than three days, but you might as well go to City Hall and make things easier.\n\nWhile you are there, you might see people getting married, which is another popular event people have there.", "author": "H M."}

Just something simple.  Just the two of us.  We were planning a trip to San Francisco in the summer, and, as this is one of our favorite cities in the world, decided that is where we would like to be wed. \n\nLittle did we realize when we made this decision that: \n\n-- We would be being married at one of the most beautiful places in the world.  SF City Hall is magnificent, grand old building.  We are both fans of extraordinary architecture and SF City Hall more than fills that bill.  Everyone knows the dome and rotunda and grand staircase, but, beyond those, there are magnificent nooks and crannies that make every inch of this building something special. \n\n-- Everyone we encountered at SF City Hall, from the folks in the clerk's office to the JP who married us to the other visitors we met in-between getting licensed and getting married would be so friendly and helpful. \n\n-- We'd now have something in common with Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio. \n\n-- There would be such a feeling of love and hope and excitement in the air.  This was during the days, that I certainly hope return, when ALL couples were legally allowed to wed in California.  That we were being wed in a jurisdiction that welcomed and included all certainly contributed to making our day special.  I read one man's opinion that it was a whole new \"summer of love\" in San Francisco and we'll forever feel blessed for having been a part of that. \n\nFor all this and more, SF City Hall will always be a very special and important place to us both.", "author": "Elena M."}

When you first enter the office, you will be greeted by either the volunteer or intern (who usually cannot answer your questions) because nobody knows. (We are advised to tell callers or visitors to telephone 311 or 211, depending on the information needed).  Only the Legislative Aides (who schedules and the watchdog for the office).  The desk is litter with brochures (some are outdated) of community activities within the district.  The Aides supplies information  only \"as needed\".  Each Aide has their own files and information and sometimes they share it.  As a volunteer, you screen the telephone calls and give the messages to the Supervisor's Aides to decide how to dispatch it.   The Proclamations are written by the person designated to rewrite the information of the \"honoree\".  The volunteer would go to the Clerk's Office where the City's Official Seal is and use the embosser with a gold seal (some Supervisors use a red/white & Blue ribbons to accent the Proclamation.).  Then, the Supervisor would sign the official paper.  If other Supervisors are to sign the document, then the volunteer is to go to all the offices to obtain their autograph.  And, we have a log sheet of constituents who visits or calls in.  There's more but this should suffice for now.  Over and Out.", "author": "Marian G."}

This place was soooo packed! The lower level where the lobby is was where they had most of their food. They had food from local favorites such as Yoshi's and a bunch of other places I could not for the life of me remember. They had a lot of different types of food including Japanese, Italian, American, Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, and probably something I'm forgetting to mention. There were bars everywhere you turned mixing cocktails and pouring beer. Because we had VIP bracelets, we were allowed to go upstairs to the second floor where we had a private bar and this awesome sushi that totally kicked Yoshi's ass downstairs. We were munching on these all night and even got to do lots of exploring around City Hall after hours. I think this was the coolest part. We took loads of pictures and went up and down the elevators and hallways. We probably weren't supposed to be up there, but nobody stopped us! I must say I will never forget this experience. The City Hall looks awesome at night, btw!\n\nFinal Verdict: I was lucky enough to be able to attend this event, the invitation must be heaven sent! We ran up and down the city hall stairs, we had been drinking all night so we didn't care.", "author": "Florence W."}
