The service was great the Hostess was very nice and got us a table that was perfect because we had to eat fast to make our show. Our server was Josway super nice guy and great server. \n\nThe food was delicious and there was vegan and gluten free entree options perfect for our party. We had the chicken fried mushrooms and the seasoning and risotto with it was very tasty. My GF sister had the steak and I had the pasta. Joseay put the cherry on our night by sending out a butter cake with poach pears (it was my sisters birthday) absolutely delicious. Perfect dinner.", "author": "Sage D."}

Food was great, service inconsistent.  \n\nSolo diner as usual, but I was the given the option of a communal bench, two-spot table top or bar seating. Nice to have choice. My assigned waiter was courteous but distracted. \n\nKicked off with the charred shishito peppers, which were delicious: grilled just right and drizzled with a nicely umami mayo and fresh coriander (cilantro!) greens. Light and perfect for sharing. \n\nMy main was the Urban burger without bun. Mixed outcome here. I'll give the accompanying fries a big thumbs up for their crispy savoury taste. The burger itself was poorly composed, and without the bun it was a big hot mess. Bunless is generally a hot mess anyway, but this one more so than usual. IMHO the fillings were cut too thick to be manageable. The meat was over cooked and quite dry, plus it needed quite a bit of seasoning to bring it to life. First world problems...\n\nThe Rusty Negroni was ok, nothing spectacular. A little watery. I asked for a wine recommendation that wasn't too bad. \n\nThe hostess gets a big thumbs up from me. She kept checking in on me, had a couple of chats and kept me entertained. \n\nI'd return to try some if the other dishes, but I'd skip the burger next time.", "author": "Richard L."}

Okay, let's get real, it was really for the s'more sundae. \n\nThe place itself had warm lighting, modern decor, and kind wait staff. They will seat you even if your party have not all arrived. The bar area looked pretty cute but didn't get a chance to check it out. \n\nThe first time I came, I made the mistake of ordering actual food before desert. I had the 8-hr bolognese, which was hearty, filling, and delicious. The problem was the filling part. So, no room for ice cream. Not to be deterred, I came again a couple nights later and was a little more clever. I ordered an appetizer and the sundae. The meatballs were tender and moist and I loved the sauce they were smothered in. The veg seemed a tiny bit wilted but the bleu cheese whip was light and fluffy. As expected, the s'mores sundae was as amazing as I had hoped. Sweet vanilla-y/marshmallow-y ice cream, a side of torched marshmallows, chocolate sauce with some crunchy choc bits, and a graham cracker bar. Omg, it was the best thing ever. Perfect serving size. Don't share it. Just don't.", "author": "Sally C."}

It takes more to impress me today than on other days.  I am impressed.  The Urban Tavern was 495 feet from my body position on earth and I was hungry.  The hostess was a bit um, uncertain and it took a good minute of thinking to get a table.  This left me concerned. \n\nThe non alcoholic pomegranate ginger punch was a good start.  This drink was not sugary and was fresh, flavorful and a bit spicy from the ginger beer.  The photos show the kimchi fries and charred octopus appetizers. Both blew me away.  The menu description did not do their complex flavor justice.  The server, KJ, was fantastic.  Ask for her.  Really.  She anticipated needs before I knew I had needs.  On the food shows the chefs say if a restaurant has pimento cheese you should try it.  I could not eat another appetizer so I ordered the burger with pimento cheese, onion jam and avocado. I could not decide what I wanted and the true test of a good restaurant is can they make a burger special.  A burger is not my typical pick but this burger.  Sigh.  This burger was fantastic. \n\nKJ recommended that since we were full that we take a dessert menu back to the hotel.  This way we could stop for dessert tomorrow.  She really is a professional server giving fantastic service in an industry where this does not always happen.  She loved food.  So foodies getting a foodie server is appreciated.  \n\nI will not only say go here.  But I will say that this is a meal I will remember and miss and that is rare.   I am going to put on pajamas and reminisce before my full stomach falls asleep.", "author": "Kori H."}

We ordered three dishes of them to start things off--whoops!   The idea of whipping blue cheese drew us all in and we just had to see what that actually meant.\nThe pic explains it all.  Clap! Clap! Clap!\n\nUrban Tavern plates their dishes beautifully and has created a menu filled with diverse, unique choices that will please anyone's palate.\n\nThe menu is divided into small plates/large plates and you can mix and match as you like.\n\nI asked for two small plates and they were to be the extent of my dinner: the charred, Spanish octopus and the Kimchi fries.\n\nKimchi fries???   I had to find out what they were all about but first came the octopus.  I loved it--it was meaty yet tender and sat in a nice romesco sauce with accompanying chorizo and tomato chutney.  It was light tasting and also what I thought would be a rather healthy choice to pair with the Kimchi fries considering that they were about as unhealthy as you could get...\n\nPeople--you must order the Kimchi fries--they are steak fries covered in short rib, carmelized kimchi, and smoked fiscalini cheddar!\nWhat a combo.  No one at the table likes kimchi except me so I got to eat the entire thing by myself.  ( I am walking an extra 10,000 steps today as penance.)\n\nThe burger with added cage-free egg was a big hit for another diner too.  \nService was great.  There are creative cocktails to choose from as well as a pretty standard beer menu.\n\nWe went up to Cityscape after dinner for a nightcap--great views up there!", "author": "Thomas D."}

It's a visually appealing space with lots of Edison bulbs and clean lines with modern, efficient yet warm design. The staff is friendly, attentive and flexible and pushed this from a 3 1/2 to a 4-star review for me.\n\nAfter making reservations during GDC for a group of 3 at 8 p.m., we showed up about 15 minutes late with two additional dinner guests in tow. Apologizing, we hoped they could still seat us. The hostess was extremely friendly and accommodating, telling us it was no big deal and seating us immediately. \n\nOur waitstaff service was good and attentive, although seemed a little inexperienced. We ordered an assortment of appetizers and everyone enjoyed what was offered, especially the braised octopus and the chicken meatballs. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Ghost Pines cab, which needed to open up. The restaurant didn't have a decanter so we were stuck drinking it as is. Given the location in San Francisco with a well-promoted executive chef and foodie-friendly menu choices, I would have thought a decanter was a no-brainer. Especially since wine choices range from about $20 to several hundred dollars per bottle.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered an assortment of dishes - bolognese pasta (which is made of \"melted\" short rib rather than the more common pork-venison-beef), burgers and steak. All were okay with no major complaints, but also not really mind-blowing considering the price. My bolognese was quite bland. A little pepper and salt helped, but still not come anywhere close to the home cooked version I prefer. \n\nIn summary, I'd give this a 4 1/2 for service (with a small ding for the lack of decanter), a 3 1/2 for the food -- appetizers quite good, main courses just falling short -- and a 2 1/2 for pricing (considering the food quality).", "author": "Mario K."}

The meat was fresh & cooked perfectly. \n\nFor drinks, my wife had the Harvest Martini, which she describes as a nice fruit drink that didn't over power with Alcohol. I had the Last Word, which was a Gin based drink.  I thought it had a good balance of botanicals and herbals and enjoyed it, where my wife said it tasted like potpourri.  I also had an Improved Whiskey, which was a good improvement on an old fashioned. \n\nFor dessert, we had the S'mores Sundae. It was fresh marshmallow soft serve ice cream served with three roasted marshmallows, a graham cookie and sprinkled with Graham cracker and chocolate.  Another WOW!\n\nTotal cheque came to $92.00 - well worth it in our option. \n\nWe both would highly recommend.", "author": "Jason H."}

So much so that when we asked about one of the deserts he emphatically stated that we did not want to order it and it was in fact listed as a natural disaster. Definitely appreciated the frank and honest opinion. The vegetarian dish was positively a dream, with Jasmine rice risotto at the bottom and a wonderful assortment of shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, julienned carrots, thinly sliced marinated cucumbers, kamichi, wilted spinach with gently fried egg on the top. My dining companion ordered the pork loin which had the best flavor marinade seasoning and cooked to perfection.

For main dishes we shared the 8 hour bolognese and the burrata salad. Both were tasty. The bolognese was excellent it was just the right amount on the pasta with fantastic flavor. The burrata salad was good although it seemed to have too much of the vinaigrette dressing on it. We did switch out the mesclun for arugula, but I don't think that was the reason why.

Yet another 30 minutes to pass before we got our food. The food was nothing special and tasted like nothing special. The only thing that was actually good was the fries (I kid you not). Continuing on with the bad service, our waiter never came around to check on us, asked us how the food was and if we needed anything else. We had to flag him down twice. We asked for another order of fries and yes another 30 minutes passed and by that time we were done eating and no longer wanted the fries order. Our waiter told the waitress that was bringing the fries order that we no longer wanted them and she such an attitude - not OK! We asked for the dessert menu and again it was nothing special.  The entire bill was $80. And the guy got a $10 tip. It was so close to talking to the manager but lacked the patience to do so.

I would definitely come back, I had the burger and was very satisfied with it. The main reason I rated 'Urban Tavern' 4 stars is the unique menu selection. This will prohibit some customers because they will be scared to try it. My advice is to come in and try something new. The alcohol selection is huge and has plenty of selections. THIS IS NOT A KID FRIENDLY PLACE. They will have a hard time finding something to eat. But besides that this place was very good and would highly recommend it.", "author": "Evan H."}

There were six of us for dinner and we had 8-hour Bolognese, Chinook Salmon, and the Wine Bottle Roasted Biagio Chicken. Each dish was better than the next. And for dessert, we all ordered (on KJ's recommendation) the Berry Bomb (raspberry chantilly | strawberry and ginger beer consume | yuzu creme brulee buttons).

I ordered the pork chop and my friend ordered the bolognese, and we shared the brownie and panna cotta. My pork chop was pretty good. It was seared nicely and had a nice flavor. My only issue was that at least a quarter to a third of the pork chop was fat. I don't know much about cuts of meat. Perhaps that is just how pork chops are. The accompanying vegetables of brussel sprous and sweet potatoes, and the surprising addition of pork rinds were also very good - seasoned properly and cooked nicely. My friend's bolognese was good, but I thought the meat was a little tough. The actual brownie and panna cotta were good, but it had a strange assortment of fruits, candies, and flowers on top that were not. They did not go well with the actual desserts and actually detracted from them. The brownie itself was crisp on the outside and slightly gooey in the middle. The panna cotta had two fruity flavors - one strawberry and the other I'm not sure about. It was unexpected, but not bad.", "author": "Annie L."}

We were running late and the Urban Tavern was closer to the Exit Stage Left Theater than the restaurant that we had originally selected.  Wow! What a delicious surprise! I expected a basic (boring) chain-hotel food experience.  I was resigned to eating something small and generic just to avoid a rumbling stomach during the 2 hour show.  Well, we're we surprised! We had one of the most outstanding and delicious (and memorable) meals I can remember last night at the Urban Tavern.  Our lovely, efficient, bright star of a server, a 20 year happy veteran of the Hilton who calls herself \"K.J.\" was a delight!  She explained each dish accurately and beautifully.  We loved the burrata salad, the mushroom medley side dish, the outstanding \"pastrami-style\" pork loin and a yummy red blend wine from their very ample menu.  The dishes are clean yet complex.  The ingredients are locally sourced.  The dishes were artfully composed and unique.  We loved everything, seriously.  We can't wait to return to try the apple inspired cheesecake the KJ so carefully described.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-09", "description": "My wife and I were in San Francisco for business, staying at the Hilton and decided to try Urban Tavern.  The first time we went we were pleasantly surprised to experience world-class food and service.  Literally, it was far and away better than we could have even imagined and that's fairly powerful of us to say.  My wife and I appreciate and seek out great dining experiences and this was just so unexpectedly good...perhaps we were jaded in the sense that being it was attached to a chain hotel, we didn't think it would be as good as it was.  But, it WAS.\n\nKnowing that, we came back two nights later with a business friend of ours.  That night it was equally as good and we discovered the Filet of Sole was simply one of the best interpretations of this fish classic that was literally on par with anything, anywhere we have had in the past.  The desserts were stellar, the service exemplary and the food: superlative.\n\nNow, enter Friday, the end of the week, we'd been in presentations for three days and were just dead tired and decided, again almost on a whim, what not let's just complete the triumvirate and go to Urban.  Only this time, we went because we KNEW how good it would be.  And tonight, my friends, they simply crushed it.\n\nThe chef, Michael Raub, made us a venison platter that was on par with any we've had anywhere.  Our attentive waiter, Sebastian, was by now, recognizing us and treated us like family.  The manager, Gerald, even came by and told us a little about him and Michael and it was just a great, great time.\n\nI'll even add a little more:  It was a magical evening.  We were tired, we were ready to get back to our room and the entire entourage attached to us utterly went to the nth degree to spoil us with fantastic service, meals that stood with the best we've ever had and individual meetings with the Chef and the Manager.  Needless to say, we quickly forgot we were tired and let the experience really soak in.  If it seems like I am a bit gushy about these folks it's because I am.  The service and the food are on par with any place we've eaten in any major city, anywhere.  The food is absolutely rock solid, the presentation equal to the product and the staff are the type of professionals every restaurant wished they had.  \n\nI won't drill-down too deeply on individual food plates as we can safely say, if it's on the menu, it will be good.  The fish is a treat and if they have venison on the menu that night, don't hesitate to give it a shot; it is truly like butter, just melting in your mouth.\n\nMy wife and I have eaten at many a Michelin Three Star, many a world-class eatery and are no strangers to good service and good food.  But Urban Tavern is a rare, exceedingly rare treat in a downtown location in a great city that will blow your socks off.", "author": "Pruitt H."}

The vegetable dishes ie cauliflower steak for $25...ridiculous, and I don't care if it's \"the city\".  Barely anyone in the place which usually isn't a good sign, especially for a Friday nite. They charged an 18% gratuity - I guess because we had 6 people.  well technically 5 adults and one toddler.  Which is interesting since the service was excellent - our waiter was so lovely, and the chef came round to check on our level of contentment which is always appreciated.  I typically pay 20% tip unless service is horrible, so the built-in 18% was not a wise choice.

They had a very interesting and different food and drink menu so we had a lot of questions. KJ answered everything and made amazing suggestions. I have a severe nut allergy and she thought I had a nut on my plate and she was double/triple checking to make sure it wasn't. She so gave us great suggestions for activities and areas to check out. So happy we came to urban tavern", "author": "Aj B."}

We came on a Wednesday and they had a \"Wine Wednesday\" special - 50% off select bottles!  We got a Rombauer Chardonnay for retail price... highly abnormal in any restaurant serving wine. Food was delicious. We had the best time.  Definitely coming back.", "author": "Gautam J."}

We had a great meal and Sebastian, our waiter, made the experience even more pleasurable.  His recommendations for dinner were spot on and his, jovial, personal caring, and humor kept us in stitches.", "author": "Diana L."}

We asked for a well done skirt steak, they brought us extra dry steak with burnt baby potatoes. The burger had no taste whatsoever. They never bothered to refill water. The price for two dishes was $61 (extremely expensive for what we got). Definitely not going back!", "author": "Georgy Z."}

Something as simple as bread and butter was elevated to another level with the addition of some amazing herbs.  The dishes (octopus, salmon poke, little gems salad, & half chicken) were so unique and executed very well. Our server was super friendly and said they have a new head chef who used to be at French Laundry.  The only negative is that I was too full to try dessert.  Maybe I'll just have to come back next weekend!", "author": "Veronica E."}

I had a quick opportunity to do some shopping before the stores all closed. Having worked up an appetite, I popped into Urban Tavern for a quiet solo dinner. My server, Sebastian, was wonderful, warm and welcoming. I asked for some recommendations. He selected his 3 favorite small bites to create my perfect tasting menu. Warm octopus perfectly flavored over a bed of grilled vegetables, delicious chicken meatballs with just the right amount of spice, and mouth watering saut\u00e9ed trumpet mushrooms. Fabulous combination!  For dessert the berry bomb was as beautiful to the eye as it was to the palate. Thank you for making my dinner alone so fun!", "author": "Jane L."}

This restaurant was connected to the Hilton and we had seen it so many times we decided to give it a try. We were in search of a really good piece of steak to pair with some red wine and really we got quite the opposite. I asked for my steak to be medium well, I got burnt steak. BURNT TO A CRISP. not to mention our waiter came by to take our order and never came by again. We had to flag him down to get the checks. I'm giving it a 2 because it was convenient to not have to layer up to get to the restaurant but the service, the food & the prices were atrocious.", "author": "E C."}

Cocktail was reasonable.  Ambiance and service was solid.  Not gonna blow your socks off, but honestly for some reason we had low expectations at Urban Tavern pleasantly surprised us.", "author": "Amjad S."}
