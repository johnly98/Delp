This location is more rectangular than anything so the seating is mainly in the front of the restaurant while the kitchen/bathroom are farther down the hall. \n\n| WHAT WE GOT | \n\n+ Agedashi Tofu - YUM! This was a great starter. The tofu was fried perfectly and melted in the Tsuyu sauce. The added bonus was the bonito flakes on top.\n\n+ Chicken Karaage - Another great option! They pair it with a spicy mayo sauce which isn't that spicy in case you were worried. The chicken had a nice coating and wasn't overcooked. They did a great job of creating a crisp while maintaining the moisture of the chicken.\n\n+ Truffle Oil Edamame - I'm used to plain cold edamame when going to sushi/ramen spots so this was a nice change. The truffle oil paired with the salt added great flavor to the edamame. \n\n+ Black Garlic Ramen - This is something that I rarely see on ramen menus so I had to check it out! Even though they indicate this dish as spicy it wasn't what I was expecting. The black garlic broth had a nice kick but it had a slight burnt flavor (in a good way). It actually paired really well with the 3 pieces of chasu and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The addition of corn added a nice contrast to the other flavors in the dish that were very savory due to its tonkatsu nature. I also enjoyed that the broth here wasn't too savory but just the right amount of creamy to add depth but not make me full too fast.\n\nOverall, the dishes here a nice change from what you normally see on traditional menus and were delicious. I'll be honest and will say that the black garlic ramen is not my all time fave, but since it's not on your typical menus I would try it out. \n\n| SERVICE | \n\nService here was great. We called ahead to make a reservation and when we got there the table was completely set up with waters, silverware, etc and they let us sit down even before our whole party was there. They were attentive to our group and even chatted it up with us. \n\nPLUS - when they box your ramen to go they separate the broth and noodle vs. keeping them in one container.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

I've always been a night owl of sorts but regrettably most other ramen places only stay open until 10pm if you're lucky. As a hungry preggo lady, the weirdest cravings often strike late in the evening and lately it's been ramen ramen ramen. Thank you Ushio for staying open until midnight on Friday and Saturday! And also for being smack dab in the middle of a fun neighborhood - lots of other things to do and see around mealtime.\n\nWhile it's not the perfect ramen bowl, it sure is satisfying. The broth and the egg, arguably two of the most important elements of the bowl, could use some improvement. Broth is not as flavorful as some other places, it's true, and the egg has been inconsistent...this last time the outside of it was pretty hard and salty. The noodles are not as chewy as my favorite places either. But what i do like about this place in particular (besides their hours) is that they have a variety of bowls that i haven't seen before in other places...vegan, seafood, and my new favorite - oxtail! My grandma used to make oxtail stew often when i was growing up and i just love it. I know that oxtail is a pain in the booty to cook, so I take opportunities where i can to order it at restaurants. I personally feel like the brussel sprouts are a bit much with all the oxtail...I kind of wish it was maybe just spinach or some lighter green, the flavor of the sprout doesn't really seem to be cohesive with the rest of the bowl. All in all, a good effort and does the job for me.\n\nThe service is good too. Friendly and fast. I like that they play Netflix food shows while you're eating - makes me hungrier!\n\nLastly, i love that it's on the same block as the ice cream cookie sandwiches (also open late).

Serving portion wise, I would say this is definitely on the more generous side. Bowls were huge, the broth was rich and flavorful and they do not skimp on the toppings! They gave me two full pieces of soft shell crab (Ramen parlor only gives you 1!) and corn is included by default (most places charge you $1 for one small scoop). One minor complaint is that the broth was a little too rich and salty for me, but that is easily fixed as they offered to dilute the broth if wanted.\n\nOverall-- generous and rich ramen, good service, fairly new ramen shop in the city so short wait.

It was salmon mixed with mango  and avocado served with crispy wonton skin over spicy dressing .  I can't eat spicy ; therefore, I asked to have the spicy dressing on the side.

The broth is plenty flavorful, rich, and everything you'd want in a ramen broth. It comes in a huge bowl with a large heaping of noodles, and most of the toppings on the side. I added an egg to my ramen for an added cost. It's nice that they put the toppings on the side but I would've preferred if they just put everything in their for me. If I didn't want a certain vegetable I could've just told them but meh! There's an interesting variety of veggies in the vegan ramen including Brussels sprouts and some sort of sweet potato I think. Also eggplant! And fried tofu! All the toppings were really delicious and I think covered in a sauce? It's very VERY decadent ramen. The flavors are rich and bordering on overwhelming but the noodles sort of balance it out. It's definitely my favorite vegetarian ramen that I've tried. Check it out if you're veggie or not! Either or I think this is a SOLID spot for ramen in the mission.", "author": "Amy T."}

Aw yis.\n\nHaving moved from Sawtelle, LA a year ago, I've been a little disappointed with the local ramen joints. Most are too fatty (Yamadaya), bland (Iza), or packed (Mensho) for my liking. Imagine my excitement when I learned about Ushio opening up just a few blocks away.\n\nConvenience - It's basically on 16th and Valencia. Went for lunch on a Saturday at 12:30pm. The restaurant was about 50% full the entire hour I was there, which is great. I'm sure it'll get more crowded as more people hear about it.\n\nAmbiance - They're going for that modern, clean look. It's forgettable but fine. A photo is worth a thousand yelp reviews on this topic.\n\nService - The staff was attentive and very willing to offer suggestions.\n\nFood - The Spicy Black Garlic ramen isn't the best in the city, but it's solid. The cloud ear shrooms were a nice touch, the chashu was tasty, and the egg was perfectly runny. The broth could have been spicier though. The edamame and matcha cheesecake were bomb. GET THEM.\n\nPrice - A little on the pricier side, but this is SF \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nBad - Not feeling the use of comic sans on the menu.\n\nOverall 5/7.

Place was not packed, but not empty, either. We were seated promptly and I ordered the spicy black garlic tonkatsu, while he ordered the Ushio spicy miso. Our food came out in an adequate time. \n\nI tried some of his broth, and I'm not a fan of miso flavor with ramen; I like my miso in plain miso soup, so his just tasted OK to me. With regards to my spicy garlic tonkatsu, it was not spicy, more oily (the latter understandable). The former was fixable with their chili powder and hot sauce (both upon request). The hot sauce was more like XO sauce mixed with that garlic chili sauce that looks like sriarcha but in a jar with a green cap minus the rooster on the label. Personally, I love XO sauce, so I really enjoyed either take on \"hot sauce\". I was, however, disappointed that there was little to no garlic flavor. The ramen noodles were of the typical wavy type. I enjoyed my first few bites, but since both the broth and the bowl were piping hot, I think the noodles continued to cook while I was eating. I don't eat very fast (but also not a snail pace), so I actually noticed that my noodles had gotten soft. This was a little too well-done for my taste. In any case, both of us enjoyed our lunch (my bf preferred my broth over his). Why the potential half bump down to 3.5 stars? Well, I ended up being extremely thirsty for the rest of the day! I know ramen tends to be a little salty so it may be typical for others to experience this after effect; however, I don't. I feel like the saltiness was masked by the other flavors within the broth. .. in any case, I'm on the fence with whether or not I'd return. I've definitely had better, but I did leave the restaurant feeling satisfied.. but maybe I was just really hungry (I had just gotten off work at that time and was starving).

The broth was way too salty and the lobster was way overcooked to the point where it was stuck in its shell. \n\nThe kicker was that when we were ready to pay, the server asked if I wanted my food to go. I said, \"oh no thanks, it was waaaay to salty to eat\". She replied \"oh\". And then went to the bar area to pour some water. No attempt to let her cooking staff know or mention. I wasn't looking for a free meal, which is why I just said it after we paid, but there was no attempt to provide feedback to the cooks. Which is why I decided to write this review.

I was really excited to hear that a new ramen spot opened up in the Mission so I was eager to try it. I ordered the Seafood Ramen and my husband ordered the Black Garlic Ramen. First off, I was super impressed with the size of the bowls and how generous they are with the meat and noodles. My Seafood Ramen had soft shell crab, a lobster tail, clams, shrimp, etc. for a reasonably affordable price (by SF standards).  The broth was creamy, definitely seafood flavor, and rich.  The flavors of both broths were well-developed, perhaps a little on the oilier side.  However, after a few sips, it was quite evident that the broth was way too salty.  I think the addition of all of the seafood only added to the salt concentration and as they bathed in the broth, it only got saltier.  Most disappointingly, however, was that the handmade ramen noodles were way overcooked, to the point that they were mushy.  This was not true of all of the bowls ordered so it appeared that they were quite inconsistent in the cooking of the noodles. \n\nService was pleasant and the space was nice and clean.

We waited about an hour, and finally got a couple of seats at the bar.\n\nWe shared the chicken karaage - it was delicious, juicy, but needed some lemon or acidity. The spicy black garlic tonkotsu was good and had a nice heat to it. The noodles were nice and chewy, but the broth wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked. It also had a gritty texture, and my fiance thought it tasted a little burnt. He ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen, and I also thought it wasn't as flavorful or creamy as I like. Also, only half an egg for each bowl of ramen! \n\nFor the price and the wait, I would rather go somewhere else, like Mensho or Marafuku. At least at Marafuku you can put your name down and go grab drinks elsewhere, instead of waiting outside in the cold people-watching as all the homeless bums walk by.", "author": "Vivian H."}

The wontons were a good size for just me (because I was hungry), but would be a perfect appetizer for two. The wontons chili oil sauce was tangy and smelled mouthwateringly tasty. The black garlic tonkatsu ramen broth was incredibly flavorful with garlic (and whatever it is that gives it the black color), and had all the great characteristics of a good tonkatsu. The chashu and soft boiled egg were cooked perfectly, and the garnish of a feeling garlic cloves was a nice touch.

The wontons were good, spicy, but I'll probably try something else next time. Menu says they're served with chili oil and they're pretty oily because of it. The tonkatsu is also pretty oily, a pretty solid layer sitting on top.

The addition of corn is something different that I liked though. \nCheesecake was really creamy and well plated, even in a to go box.

The vegan lover was also delicious and the broth was perfect. \nWe also tried their konnyaku sashimi and their drunken clams, both of which were extremely tasty.    \nThe service was good, as the waiters are very kind and patient.\nI would definitely eat here again.", "author": "Judy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-27", "description": "Decided to try out the tori tonkotsu and gyoza, but the food service was slow even though it wasn't particularly busy (~20 minutes for the ramen) and the food was overall lacking. The gyoza was unremarkable in terms of flavor, but wasn't particularly bad (or good). The ramen noodles seemed like the kind you'd get from a pack of top ramen, the egg was bland, and the broth was watered down. The chashu was tender, but that was the only real positive about the ramen. Overall, the food and service were substandard and you'd be better off getting your ramen fix elsewhere.", "author": "Simon L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-20", "description": "Descent ramen and service. The vegan ramen was salty as other reviews have commented. I'd order again but next time ask the waiter to use less miso broth so it's less salty. Also ingredients didn't taste fresh. The miso tasted like it was from a machine and the vegetables on the side tasted previously frozen then saut\u00e9ed in some sweet sauce. The tofu tasted like it was twice fried then saut\u00e9d in the sweet sauce which caused the out bread to be a bit soggy and less crispy. This is the only vegan option btw.", "author": "Leah M."}

I had the seafood delux which is ramen with lobster broth, soft shell crab, clams, chasu, soft boiled egg, and lobster. What I liked was the portions were big, the broth tasted fresh with seafood, and the venue was clean and fun. Customer service was on top of things. I do think their broth could have more depth and noodles thicker. All in all was not a bad meal.", "author": "Peachie Y."}

I had the Noodles with Oxtail and I was disappointed, the broth lacked any flavor. The meat was tender and veggies cooked fine, just no flavor in the broth. My friend had the garlic noodle soup and agreed that the broth was bland. We also had the Spicey Chicken wings, and no spice whatsoever. With so many ramen places I won't be returning.!", "author": "Jim W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-10", "description": "This name of this ramen shop is supposed to translate into trendy, but no indication of this was given on the menu before we ordered.  I was looking forward to some delicious, salty, savory, umami ramen broth of the kind that is offered at a lot of ramen places, and instead the tori tonkotusu broth was acidic and strange.  Didn't have the depth of flavor that I was expecting.  Maybe my palette is not attuned to this kind of broth, but I would say that even something novel, or something with a twist should be satisfying and intriguing on first taste, and not leave you longing for a bowl of the more traditional stuff instead.", "author": "D K."}

I had dinner soon but I still wanted to try it, so I got the chicken karaage. I didn't expect much since it's a new place, but wow! The chicken was so tender and not super greasy.
