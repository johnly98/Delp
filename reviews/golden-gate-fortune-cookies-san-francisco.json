Been to SF so many times before, but this is my very first visit here.  It was quite interesting as you can see how the fortune cookie is created. And I love me some fortune cookies!!!\n\nWhen my wife and I went, there was a short line to get into the very small shop where we were greeted by a person handing out warm flat circular cookies (before it is shaped into a fortune cookie) for us to taste.  There were various fortune cookie flavors in the shop for purchase as it showcases capitalism at its finest in a touristy area.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience just to see how fortune cookies are made by machine and hand.  It doesn't take too much time (maybe about 5 minutes if no line) so I highly recommend it!", "author": "Johnny N."}

There is a huge variety of chocolate dipped, plain disk, and folded fortune cookies that are boxed, bagged, and sitting out in the open ready to be packaged & purchased. \n\nI'm not quite sure how often the machines are cleaned, but I distinctly noticed that the cookies have a slight burnt taste to them. Still edible, but just a lingering after taste that stayed with me when I munched on my free sample. \n\nWe purchased a bag of plain folded cookies. I also noted a slight burnt taste when eating these, even though I couldn't find any singed or burned coloration. So I can only assume it's radiating from the machines during the cooking process.\n\nThe lady who we talked to was really nice. After we made our purchase, she threw in another complimentary handful of more flat disk cookies into our bag. However, since she'd just handled cash with her bare hands before moving on to touch the unwrapped cookies, we weren't so comfortable eating these. Money is dirty after all, and we never know what germs get transferred!\n\nDon't expect to spend too long here-- maybe 15 minutes if you're looking through all the merchandise for sale & observing the machinery and folding process. It's a nice place to swing by if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip. Happy munching!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

It was a great learning experience, seeing how the fortune cookies were made. We bought 10 bags because of the buy 10 get 1 bag free promotion. It sure was a nice treat to bring back home to Hawaii. I especially enjoyed my fortunes and I couldn't stop at eating just one, I ended up eating about 10. Did I mention, that the fortune cookies taste so fresh?!", "author": "Judy C."}

As you can see, there was a decent line forming, but it shortened pretty quickly. Inside, was a small 2 person fortune cookies- making operation, as well as a couple of cashiers ushering guests along and stacking products where you can see how it's all made. I did not see nor hear them request change for pictures, but then again, everyone in line with me purchased something, regardless. We also got ample amounts of samples while waiting in line. \n\nWhat we got:\n\nWrite-your-own-message Fortune Cookie \n      1 for $1.50 or 2 for $2 of their fresh plain fortune cookies. I'm not going to rate these as it's a fortune cookie.. XD \n\nBox of Tri-colored Fortune Cookies\n      It was a gift for my family members, so I couldn't say what flavors they were, and honestly didn't mind not knowing what the flavors were as it didn't seem too crazy, anyhow. Although they do offer wild, chocolate drizzled flavors, I'm a simple gal, so I opted for more traditional flavors (I'm still assuming here... Haha) I ended up trying  the red and green once the recipient opened it, and my best guess would be strawberry and matcha. The flavors are very mild and just as good as the plain flavor.\n\nI don't see a need to come back as I don't crave fortune cookies, but I can see the intrique of visiting such a place if you're touring SF Chinatown.", "author": "Christine H."}

Reasonable price, and a fun gift idea. \n\n#2: You can find fortune cookies you can not find anywhere. They have chocolate-coated fortune cookies, ones with milk chocolate, ones with white chocolate, with sprinkles and without sprinkles. These are expensive: $5.75 for a container of 6 cookies. They also have fortune cookies for adults (X-rated fortunes).\n\nLast but not least, you can try fortune cookies while they are still warm (free). Don't dismiss it because it's touristy or stupid.

There's an alley called Ross Alley that leads you to this place and its away from the main street where it can't be seen. I say \"Gem\" because once inside you could see people on desks working their magic, making fortune cookies from a machine. At a quick glance, I saw a little bit of the process. They would flattened the cookie cake with a presser machine then fold them into shape laying them on a baking template sheet.\n\nThe only thing I purchased here was a mixed bag of commonly known vanilla, green tea, and strawberry flavors for $2.75. You can't really expect too much from these fortune cookies, unless your fortune comes true later on after reading the paper messages inside, but the texture quality was good. They were simple, light and crisp. Surprisingly, I did like Strawberry flavored fortune cookie, it had a light hint of berry in it. The Green Tea flavor tasted like it was made from Matcha Powder. My family and I had fun munching out the entire bag which it had about ten pieces. The manager of the store was nice enough to give us a sample or two of regular flattened fortune cookies. \n\nEither you're a local or a visitor outside the city.

I had been on one of my unlucky streaks and therefore decided that a trip to Golden Gate Fortune Cookies was in my destiny.  Perhaps it was placebo effect, but after leaving this little factory, I felt that my luck-o-meter had increased ever so slightly.  Warning: the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie factory does not guarantee increased luck to any of its patrons; just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so is luck.  As I've been told - you make your own luck in this world, and that's why they let you do just that right there in the factory...one of the best things about this factory/store is that for just $1 you can write your own fortune and have it placed in a cookie that is made right in front of you.  So, quite literally - you make your own luck.\n\nAlthough I was excited to buy bags and bags of fortune cookies, I was most excited to write the fortunes!  I wrote the fortune for my fianc\u00e9 whereas he wrote one for me - the fortunes were then placed within the cookies, boxed up and gifted to us.  If you can practice self-control and you want to bring a neat and cheap souvenir to family and friends back home, come here and write fortunes for your loved ones!  It is a gift that is cost-effective, thoughtful and worthwhile - when will you ever run into another fortune cookie factory?  Make sure that you also buy yourself some cookies, in fact - buy yourself a couple bags of cookies.  The flattened cookies, which taste exactly the same, are the bomb.  Needless to say, my fianc\u00e9 and I finished off the bag of cookies that night while drinking our beer in the hotel room.  Fortune cookies and beer - that made for one classy night.  \n\nAll the cookies were super cheap, but to get this deal you have to have some cash on you.  Don't come here without having first gone to the ATM!  Besides paying for the items, you can also provide a tip which isn't too much to ask since you're being allowed to go in and watch these lovely women work at making the perfect fortune cookies in such a cramped space.  It really is quite tiny in here - that means it can get busy and it can get hot.  Be prepared for both, and as much as you want to take your time in here, try to be as efficient as possible.  \n\nLastly, they happen to have a HUGE fortune cookie that they sell here - we bought it, thinking how awesome it would be to eat such a monumental fortune cookie, but it was super stale.  I literally couldn't bite into the thing without breaking a tooth.  It's a neat thing to buy just for a photo op, or maybe even just to put on display (though that might be weird), but if you're just looking to eat the cookies then go with the bags of flattened ones.  They're really the best.  \n\nFinding your way here can be just a tiny bit tricky as you'll have to look down the alley's for the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie factory.  But!  There were cats roaming all around the area of the factory so I'll just say, follow the cats?  The cats seem to know a good fortune cookie when they see one...that's how you know this place is awesome, and a must-try when in San Francisco.", "author": "Lauren K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-14", "description": "Have you ever eaten a fortune cookie and wondered to yourself how these little treats are made? Or maybe you just want to find a place that makes them FRESH, right in front of you - rather than purchasing them stale at a market. \n\nWell here at Golden Gate Fortune Cookies, this is where all the baked magic happens. \n\nRecently, my girlfriend and I were brainstorming new places to check off on our San Francisco bucket list. While searching up \"food tours\" in the city, we came across Golden Gate Fortune Cookies, a small bakery that's been around since 1962! Apparently, this is THE place to visit if you want fortune cookies (yes with fortunes inside). \n\nGolden Gate Fortune Cookies is located on Ross Alley next to Jackson Street (Between Grant Ave and Stockton) in Chinatown. If you plan on coming here, I HIGHLY recommend public transportation because traffic will be horrible on a weekend because of the high influx of tourists. But, if you insist, there's a big parking garage nearby and the occasional opening for street parking. \n\nFirst, let me preface by saying that you shouldn't set your expectations for this place to be too high. Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is, in essence, a small store/bakery. It's not really, as some people may suggest on the Interwebs, a \"factory.\" Yes, you see people actually making fortune cookies here, but just like any other bakery, you can get a birds-eye view of how things are being made. If you really want to take pictures/talk to the workers, I suggest coming super early because this bakery gets FLOODED with tourists/customers...which makes sense because this place is hyped up so much. We came in around 4pm (they close at 5 I believe), and it took around 10 minutes to reach the front.\n\nOverall, as I said, Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is really just a bakery. Once you pass through the door, you will be hit with the most amazing aroma. Man all that butter smells DELICIOUS. You just want to buy EVERYTHING. And the best part is that once you are close enough to the front, you will be greeted by a very nice employee who lets you sample a freshly made cookie that hasn't been molded into shape yet. And boy, does it taste warm and delicious. And after you've had a chance to let the taste sink in, you can open your eyes and  see shelves filled with ALL KINDS of different fortune cookies. They range from vanilla ones, to chocolate-coated cookies - all things you never see outside. And the prices are SUPER cheap too! At most, it's like around $10 for a HUGE bag. If you just want the basic ones, it's like $2.5 for a good number (at least 10+). We ended up getting the original cookies. \n\nI really wished we had longer to decide what cookies we wanted and also check out the gear/tools the employees used for the fortune cookies. But the big problem about this bakery is that it's TINY. With the huge lines, it's almost impossible to spend longer than 5 minutes to enjoy your surroundings. So it won't be one of those places where you can come in and look to see what you want before waiting in line. It's definitely better if you come earlier so you don't feel the pressure to decide and leave. But besides that, the bag of fortune cookies we got were AWESOME! Despite sitting in a bag, they tasted fresh, were crunchy, and smelled GREAT!\n\nAll in all, I am happy that we took the time to check out Golden Gate Fortune Cookies. I'm sad that we weren't able to spend longer in there due to the traffic. But, due to the experience + the delicious cookies, I give this place a \"nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy.\" I do recommend this place at least once if you are in the city!\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

One of the guys working went down the line and handed out samples while we waited. Fresh fortune cookies = yum.

We devoured them all within the first block of walking away. \n\nCookies: We tried the mini flat fortune cookies and the green tea cookies. They had a fresh batch of the regular and chocolate ones going too. We enjoyed ALL of them. Just depends on what your preference is. The fortunes are pretty unique too!

Yes, I had seen that you could get the cookies here for a while, but even better when I walked in, you can get coins!

Ask for a few of the fresh ones (even though they throw them in anyways) and the coins were my favorite. They had other flavors too like Green Tea and Strawberry, and some naughty ones for those of you who are naughty, but the flavor of the fortune cookies is great.

As my mom, aunt and I were heading to this special bakery factory on 5/30/2016, the atmosphere was quite on-going and active as I welcomed there. The concept is much small, yet it does do the job right from showing the demonstrations of making fortune cookies and prepping bags. Yes, I can feel the smell of these baked fortune cookies while coming here, and it's irresistible.\n\nThe employees especially the owner are doing a great job for making the customers like me an enjoyable service. No cons at all.\n\nEvery aisle of various formats of fortune cookies are very delicious and eatable to bite no matter how big or small is; original or flat. He did offered me a special deal of a bag of flat fortune cookies at a low price after I did seen this segment on Good Day few months ago. What a win-win deal! Very eatable and incredible to eat!\n\nParking at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookies factory can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearest surface street metered parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Otherwise, you can also ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.\n\nTo conclude, Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is the coolest and the most remarkable cookie factory shop that I've ever discovered right here in San Francisco!

So much so, that he asked me to pick some up if I'm ever walking through Chinatown. I didn't have anything to do during my lunch hour, so I decided to walk there and grab some on Tuesday, October 20th around 2:45pm.\n\n*Mix chocolate adult x-rated cookies ($5.50)\n*Regular fortune cookies ($4.50)\n\nThe nephew is less than 2 years old, so he can't exactly read. Would it be wrong to get him adult fortunes?! Initially, I just grabbed the mixed adult bag since I wanted some to humor myself. But I started feeling somewhat responsible and grabbed a bag of the regular ones before I left. (In the end, it probably wouldn't have mattered as the adult fortunes are rather tame. I wouldn't call them x-rated at all!)\n\nThe regular cookies are good. If you can get some hot ones, go for it! There's nothing like a soft warm fortune cookie. I'd stay away from the chocolate ones as they tasted burnt. Not sure if it was the chocolate flavoring or if they really were burnt, but I didn't enjoy them at all.\n\nI'm actually not a huge fan of fortune cookies, but there's something oddly fun and kind of comforting about them.

Hopefully, they're not too risqu\u00e9, cause they're planning to take it back to the office :-p. They also have little mixed baggies with regular and chocolate for $2.

I shared them with my new roommate and friends, and told them all about the small shop in an alleyway in Chinatown. \n\nA few nights later, my roommate, much less innocent than myself, got an under-the-influence smile on her face as she asked me for some of my \"circles of happiness\" to satisfy her munchies--the fog in her head wouldn't let her remember what they were called. \n\nSo in my family, the plain wafers have been called \"circles of happiness\" ever since.", "author": "Angela H."}

Literally a hidden gem! I finally found it again when I looked for it in Yelp during a visit to Chinatown on Christmas Day! yay! \n\nFrom the dimly lit place it did not look very big and it doesn't even look like a store, more like a manufacturing place. The lighting was poor (we arrived around 5:30ish?). There is no cash register counters or fancy display racks or cool neon signs... our transaction was done right there by the entrance. Once you walk in the metal racks filled with packaged cookies for purchase are immediately to the left. There was a table to the right and this was where an employee was packaging flat fortune cookies in individual packages. He allowed us to try samples from it, freshly made and still warm. In the same room is a female worker sitting next to a machine where she was pulling the small flat pancake-looking cookies from a conveyor belt while still warm and forming them into what we know as fortune cookie shapes. There were rows of these machines but it was a holiday and I only saw her working on one machine. She would take a fortune and insert them in the cookie and fold. She separated the reject flat ones and the formed cookies in two separate bins. I asked permission from her that allowed me to take a video while doing this process. They could be a supplier to restaurants and walk-ins were welcomed. We were the only customers here at the time.\n\nAnd that's it, folks! We paid for our treats and left. Quick transaction. This place is cash only. $4 for one package of the flat fortune cookies. I also purchased a package of 'Smackles' (it had chocolate swirls). They are not formed like fortune cookies. Light, crispy, delicious. They also make them in chocolate flavored which I didn't purchase.

It's located within a narrow space within an alleyway, and I saw one lady in front, seated and hand folding fortune cookies into a metal muffin tin. There are racks of freshly made fortune cookies and almond cookies on the left in bags.\n\nAlmost immediately I was handed a sample -- a warm, flat round circle of a pre-folded cookie that fits in the palm of your hand -- by the guy running the place, who doesn't speak English. All of a sudden my forgotten Mandarin was unleashed and I could communicate with him. It's funny how that you can remember foreign languages when you have no choice!\n\nThere are small bags of ~6  fortune cookies for $1 and larger bags for $5. Surprisingly there are paper message strips inside. Which I realized after many of them were crushed in my suitcase coming home. Next time, I'm bringing a plastic Tupperware box as Soo H suggests! At least the flavor and freshness weren't affected.\n\nThere's a sign that says \"50 cents if you take a photo\" which seems a bit offensive.  I think they should just charge more for their cookies.\n\nNow I can check it off of my list of things to do in SF. Makes a great mini gift to take home and people appreciate trying what a freshly made fortune cookie tastes like. Still, I wasn't blown away by the flavor although it is definitely better than one you would get in a restaurant.\n\nLucky me: I beat the rush as a large tour group of 20-yo Americans came immediately after I was walking out. \n\nTIP: Due to the construction currently blocking the most direct route to Ross Alley, you may have to make a bit of a circle to get here.", "author": "Peijean T."}

I found this place on a website of tourist activities for SF and immediately wanted to go! It was a little hard to find Ross Alley because it is literally an alley. You have to find parking and walk up a big hill to be able to go down the alley. I have to be honest, if it was dark outside, I would have been scared. I guess I'm just not used to hanging out in alleys. As soon as I walked in, I realized what a big let down this was about to be.\n\nThe \"factory\" is a small room with a few women making cookies. You're stopped at the front by a man and he offers you a free fortune cookie. It was kinda cool because it was flat and not yet folded. (I had never seen one like that) They let you take photos for a charge. I think the sign said 50 cents. And that's it! That's the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie experience. I was extremely disappointed because I expected a factory and a tour. I do have to admit, the cookie was pretty good. However, I was so disappointed and let down that I didn't even think to buy any until I was at the airport later.", "author": "Michele M."}

Since I could not find it to check in, which was weird, I took a pic of their business card to do a \"first\".  Well apparently it was a first for us, but not for thousands of others.  Anyway, since it was a quiet post-Halloween Monday, there were no tourists to be seen in the ancient alley & few Chinese for that matter.\n\nAnyway, my wife is neither into Chinese history, culture, nor holes in the wall....so I had to literally beg her to come in with me....later she did love eating what we did buy there...\n\nwhich are called\n\nPIG's EARS in Chinese \n\n& look like a flat wavy fortune cookie chip that has swirls of dark & light cracker.... I say cracker, because like so many other Chinese Deserts, it is basically not sweet, and I found it to be too oily.\n\nAnyway, my wife loved them when we came home to Shell Beach, and stated that they were her favorite treat as a kid....but for some reason, after all these years, she did not find them as delicious as she remembered.\n\nERROR PRONE GASTRONOMIC NOSTALGIA can fool one....again & again.\n\nMy wife had various theories:\n\n1) Did her tastes change?\n2) Did the Pig Ear change?\n3) Was it a different formula than that used in her hometown of Tiashon eons ago?\n4) Did her palate become Americanized & spoiled since she move to the USA?\n5) Did her old Orangutang of a Slovak-American husband spoil her taste with too much great\nexpensive gourmet food over the years?\n\n....anyway, she still enjoyed them....\n\nbut apparently she still concluded that it was my fault for some reason....\nso what else is new.\n\nToo bad, you cannot buy global general \"NO-FAULT\" insurance when you get married, so that \nyou can be cover in these events.\n\nNo matter, I almost alway agree that it is my fault anyway....that leads to more harmony in a marriage.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nBack to the shop.\n\nSince we were the only ones in the shop, my wife had plenty of time to yack it up with the \"boss-lady\".  For some odd reason, she kept gesturing toward the X-rated fortune cookies as she kept talking to my wife.  Since my wife would totally be insulted by even the suggestion that such things even exist....let alone buy them, somehow my wife did not pay attention, nor maybe realized what X-rated Fortune Cookies meant.  Apparently, I found out later that was the case.  \n\nThe boss lady kept suggesting that I could always have custom-made fortune cookies, with my choice of sayings, more than a few times.  Obviously, those would cost a small \"fortune\"...pun intended.\n\nLike many, I really enjoyed looking at the old hand making process & equipment more than the product itself.....\n\nand thus....that is why they have a 50 cent for photos jar...both I an my wife gladly threw in a few bucks.  It was only while I was taking photos of the photo charge jar which was right by all the Chinese \"Saints\" figurines, that I realized that I was sinfully taking unauthorized photos...\nno matter...apparently I could, since I had a charming Chinese wife with me :)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI did favor the flat fortune cookies and bought a $5 bag of three different kinds (Regular (good), Chocolate (not so great), & Pig's Ear (wife's fav)....as well as... two bags of Almond Cookies.\n\nTHE ALMOND COOKIES TURNED OUT TO BE AMAZING!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n& was a great hit with my co-workers at my SLO job....so fresh &\ntasty.  These were far far better than any others that I have had in eons\n& reminded me of the ones I loved as a NYC kid.  Like there other products, they\nare freshly made with simple \"wholesome\" ingredients like flour, sugar, salt, water....\n& did not contain any crap, that extend shelf life.\n\nSO- TO BE A BIG HIT AT YOUR NON-BAY AREA JOB.....get a whole bunch of these\nfor your co-workers....I was shocked & pleased at their glowing reviews of them.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nI will be sure to stop by this little shop again, when we need another C-town fix of \nChinese Feet Dim Sum for me, Vege Dim Sum for wifey, assorted high grade teas, assorted\n\"alien\" things that my wife cooks with, and the ever obligatory Chinese junk that you may or may not really need....but hey... why not?\n\nIt is cheap & they surely do not sell them in the White Bread area of San Luis Obispo....not to mention that each SF trip costs a bit & is a 5-6+ hr drive each way from the mid-central coast.\n\n~~~~\n\nThis new cookie discovery, plus the gloriously cheap & excellent Chic Feet discovery at the nearby Hole in the Wall...House of Dim Sum....will drive me this way again soon.", "author": "Paul M."}

I have also seen messages geared towards bachelor/bachelorette parties and thing like those.  \n\nTip: don't worry if there is a line, there isn't much to see so the line moves fast.", "author": "Mark B."}

If you're lucky you can get them when they're warm,  so it's safe to say that I am a fan of their end product. My GF bought a couple of bags to bring home but we ended up eating most befor getting on our plane :s oops! \n\nAs many have said it's $.50 for a picture but just give them a dollar and take as many as you want, you really only need a couple haha.

I'm a pretty cautious person when I'm traveling, so I had to confirm if they were samples...and they were :) \n\nEveryone in our group grabbed a piece, and they were really flavorful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-23", "description": "I've had a lot of fortune cookies in my life, and I have to say I have NEVER EATEN A BETTER FORTUNE COOKIE. No place even mildly approaches the FLAVOR, the TEXTURE, and the LOOK of the fortune cookies at Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory. \n\nThe FLAVOR is super LIGHT and SWEET--it leaves the most pleasant aftertaste in your mouth that I've never, ever experienced before in another fortune cookie. I have never tasted such a good fortune cookie in my life. \n\nThe TEXTURE is immaculately FLUFFY and LIGHT--other fortune cookies fail in this aspect because they're usually very dense and stale.\n\nAnd finally, the LOOK of it is just amazing--it's nice and golden brown, slightly shiny, and very signature of this particular company's fortune cookie. The other fortune cookies that I've eaten look too grainy or too dark or light. \n\nTHIS IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR FORTUNE COOKIES. HANDS DOWN NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THE BEST. \n\n(Side note, who in their right mind called this establishment Golden Gate Fortune Cookies when they created the Yelp profile for this business?! It LITERALLY SAYS GOLDEN GATE FORTUNE COOKIE FACTORY on the sign outside. The person that created this weirdo name for Yelp didn't even have the integrity to lift their brainless head up to check the name of the place, which CLEARLY SAYS Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory!) \n\nTo mere mortals (ahem, people that haven't eaten this fortune cookie sent from the gods), this is just some silly novelty that has a little quirky saying and some lottery numbers in the back. But to me, this is the representation of EAST meets WEST, of a CAREFULLY CRAFTED and meticulous FLAVOR that has STOOD THE TEST OF TIME. It represents my San Franciscan native culture and upbringing. I've eaten these fortune cookies since I was 5 years old and I still come back to buy some of this fluffy goodness whenever I visit SF Chinatown. \n\nSituated in the heart of historic SF Chinatown, Golden Gate Fortune Cookies resides in Ross Alley, one of the most hackneyed and iconic images of SF Chinatown. It's not super clean, but you know you're at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory when you see a whole bunch of tourists standing in front. I'm not exactly a fan of tourists traps, but this is a huge exception. NEVER FEAR, GO INSIDE ANYWAY.\n\nAfter you push yourself through the crowd of tourists, you realize that It's quite a small place and it's not much too look at...except the SUPER COOL FORTUNE COOKIE MACHINE, the old Chinese ladies that really know how to quickly man the machine and take the little pieces of goodness and fold them into fortune cookies, the huge variety of fortune cookies, the SMELL OF IMPENDING GREATNESS, the free samples, and of course, the $1.00 payment (or did they up the price? Yikes!) for pictures...ok maybe that's just a bit annoying any probably why I didn't take pictures of the inside. \n\nRegardless, pick what you like, I usually go for the flat round ones since I'm there for the taste, not the fortunes or chance of winning the lotto. But if I'm grabbing some for friends that haven't had the chance to taste this greatness, I'll buy some of them with the fortunes. They price is around $4.50-$5 per bag, but it's well worth it. You get at least 20 of the folded ones for the $4.50 and at least 30-40 pieces in the flat fortune cookies bag. After you pop one into your mouth, you won't be able to stop--they're addicting.   \n\nTASTE: 5 stars--the best fortune cookie I've ever tasted.\nSERVICE: 3-4 stars--I love the free samples they slap into your bag. They aren't the most cheerful people, but no complaints.\nTOTAL: 5 stars--although the people could be a little more cheerful, this fortune cookie is unrivaled, so I have to give a rare 5 stars. \n\nBottom Line: Gold standard for Fortune Cookies. I dare you to try other fortune cookies after this one and private message me if you've found something better. I'm coming here to get fortune cookies until I die.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Even with said directions, it took us two tries to find Ross Alley, where Golden Gate Fortune Cookies allegedly existed.  Ross Alley was a tiny, dark patch of asphalt straight out of a Mickey Spillane novel.  Dark, quiet, looming . . .\n\nAbout half-way down what was nothing more than a path, there was light shining into the alley.  It was oddly mysterious, so we took our chances.  In the back of my head, a little voice was saying, \"Don't fly into the light!\"  We did, and indeed the light was the destination we were looking for, where we were treated to quite a wonderful experience!\n\nSmall does not begin to describe the place.  It is long and narrow, with a few steel racks on the left, a counter on the right, and two odd-looking contraptions that are reminiscent of the machines in \"The Sneetches,\" by Dr. Seuss.  At each of the machines sat a woman with magic hands folding fortunes into cookies and placing them into custom cookie holders.\n \nWhen we entered, we were exuberantly greeted by the dude who runs the place.  He gave us samples of warm, pre-bent cookie wafers and invited us in to look around.  Schmoley, were the cookies FANTASTIC!\n\nWe were allowed to watch as long as we wanted, take photos, and asked a whole bunch of questions.  We were stunned and amazed.  The whole process was simple, yet mesmerizing.  Everyone was polite as they could be and we had a blast.\n\nWe were probably there a total of 20 minutes, but we talked to the guy who runs the place for around 10 minutes.  It was easily the best 20 minutes we spent in Chinatown.  It was truly a unique experience, and for around $10 we got personalized cookies that we wrote our own fortunes into, a box of mixed-flavor cookies, two bags of flat cookie rounds, and two packs of almond cookies . . . all warm off the presses.

Even though it is a super touristy thing to do. \n\nThey hand make all their fortune cookies and it's pretty cool to see how they make it. The workers are so fast and they make it look really easy. They do charge you if you take pictures though ($0.50 I think) ... So either commit what you see to memory or bring some spare change to pay. \n\nThe owner is super nice and gives you free samples of the cookie wafer before its folded. Sometimes you can get the hot and fresh ones that are oh so delicious and crunchy! (I would suggest you brush up on your Cantonese if you want extra free cookies!)\n\nIf you buy something, they'll even toss in a few extra cookies for you. \n\nEverything there is so cheap. I know there's not too many options to choose from, but it's all under $5, cash only of course. \n\nWhat to buy: the almond cookies, and the flat pre-fortune cookies, and of course fortune cookies!! My favorite is the flat cookies because they're so addicting, you can't just have one. I would skip the chocolate fortune cookies because their not that good.", "author": "Cathy P."}

Did you know if it takes more than 4 seconds to grab the hot cookie dough, insert the fortune, and then bend the cookie...it goes straight in to the waste/sample bin.

My wife lingered near him since we read in most of the Yelp reviews that they give you free samples, but the guy was not biting. And she's pretty good at coaxing free stuff out of people.\n\nIt did smell really really good in there for some reason, so we were tempted to buy some fortune cookies, but then we remembered and said to ourselves: \"wait, fortune cookies taste terrible, right?\". So we left, out only two quarters for a couple of funny pictures.\n\nIt was pretty cool to see how they make the fortune cookies, from the flat pieces that get folded into the shapes we know, using the far-too-intricate-looking machines they have.

Every time, I would use the lai see fong (red envelope) my grandfather gave me to buy a bag of the flat fortune cookie and leave with several fresh samples that I would devour on the car ride home with a smile from ear-to-ear. \n\nSince I was in the area for a meeting this past Friday, I decided to stop by Golden Gate Fortune Cookies. As I was walking on Jackson Street and turned into the Ross Alley, the sweet aroma immediately hit me in the face and brought me back to my childhood days. As I stepped into Golden Gate Fortune Cookies, I was welcomed by a big smile from the owner, the SAME man who use to greet me with a smile when I use to go there as a kid. I spent a few moments watching the workers take the cookies out of the iron cookie press, put a fortune in it and shape them to into a fortune cookie. \n\nThey have an array of different shaped fortune cookies: the original shaped, flat, small flats and broken pieces which they sell for cheaper. They also have chocolate flavored ones which I would veer away from (very artificial tasting). The original flavor is the best for a reason. They even have \"adult fortune cookies\" with naughty fortunes which is great for bachelorette parties or gag gifts.\n\nAfter all these years, the flat fortune cookies ($3.75/bag) are still my favorite. Their super light, airy and ultra crunchy with a subtle hint of sweet vanilla; simplicity at its best. THEY'RE TOTALLY ADDICTING!\n\nThe owner always throws in samples of cookies FRESH OFF THE COOKIE PRESS into your bag. But this time, he grabbed a bunch and placed it in my hand. It was HOT and he saw the pain in my face and giggled as I wrestled with them to throw it in my bag. Apparently, he thought it was funny and I guess I would have thought so also seeing someone play the cookies version of \"Hot Potato\". \n\nI noticed a lot of the 1-2 Star reviews were from tourists. I have to kindly note the following: \n1. Chinatown is not 5th Avenue; it can be dirty, grimy and smell.  Yes, the Ross Alley may look sketchy but it's very unlikely you will be robbed in broad daylight in Chinatown of most places.\n\n2. Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is not Nordstrom, so you can't expect them to greet you upon entering or leaving. Sadly, it's a cultural thing so you can expect rude or poor service from Asian establishments.\n\n3. Yes, it's a small place and may seem like a \"sweat shop\" to outsiders. However, it's the old bulky equipment that makes it look that way. With strict SF health and building codes, an establishment would not be showcasing to the public if they were a sweat shop which Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is NOT.\n\n20 years later and Golden Gate Fortune Cookies is just the way I've always remembered it.

I am SO glad we followed the map and found this gem.  \n\nI keep putting \"factory\" in quotes because this seemed like the opposite of that.  It was tiny with about four employees.  There were a few people just pressing small, flat circles of fortune cookie into the familiar shape we all know from restaurants and take-out.  It smelled WONDERFUL in here and it was really cool to see the process of shaping the cookie and stuffing it with a 'fortune.'\n\nInsider's tip: buy a bag of the unpressed circles - they taste EXACTLY like fortune cookies and they are cheaper because they haven't been transformed into a breakable cookie.  A HUGE bag of them cost about $5 and it took days to eat.  \n\nPlease note: If you plan to take pictures, plan to buy something or leave a tip.

The machine though ingenious, could fit inside my apt kitchen.\n\nAs you can see from the photos there's a big container where the dough is poured, then it flows through a clear tube to the nozzle that squirts out just the right amount of batter onto individual baking presses - think like waffle maker but fortune cookie sized with round grilling surfaces. A whole bunch of these presses are arranged on a conveyor belt that takes them into the oven then out the other side where the baked but warm cookies are pulled off by one of the women who then shape them using a small metal tick to bend the half moons into their familiar shape. \n\nOne woman per machine. Extremely efficient. I'm not sure how many they make each hour or if all fortune cookies are made by hand. There's not much information posted anywhere (there's not any information at all). \n\nOn a Monday afternoon the place was empty. Only one other person showed up while we were there and that was just to buy some cookies. If you're so inclined they have the flat cookies and the shaped cookies for sale. And you can get samples just by showing up. They also have chocolate cookies but not to sample and you have to buy the entire $4.95 bag.\n\nI felt a little awkward just standing around and watching their operation but they didn't seem to mind and didn't push me to buy anything.

Great fun for the family, provided you are not some tourist wrecking digital havoc (where you have to pay 50 cents to get a picture, and you end up blocking the shoppers while they wait for you to finish snapping photos so they can browse or buy the goods). Best thing to do is to buy a bag of cookies (a small bag of 4 to 5 is about a buck, or $3.75 for a large bag) or better yet the large plain wafers (without the fortunes) to get more mileage per bite. Then you might be able to take a few snapshots without forking out the coins.\n\nFortune Cookies do not exist in Hong Kong, although there are a myriad of baked goodies made with the same mixture over there (that are also available here to some extent), whether it be crispy egg rolls (the dessert kind), or egg puffs/eggettes (gai daan jai). The egg batter mix used in the fortune cookies borders on a tad too sweet for my liking (may be acceptable to most of you)...should the sugar content be reduced, it would be perfect.\n\nBring the fam and/or the kids here. The old man who works here is very nice to the young ones, and he gives out the free samples...aka the rejects from the molds that are not fit to be folded into fortune cookies, but are safe and perfect to eat. Most of them are pretty much hot off the press, so the free samples taste the best. If he really likes you, when you buy a bag of cookies (or wafers) he'll reach into the reject tin and take out a handful and throw them in along with your purchase.

The batter is automatically piped onto the circular press. Travel once around. And voila the cookie is cooked and ready! From the industrial to the human machine, the worker must work with the cookie while it's still pliable. It's about 20 seconds give or take. Grab hot cookie. Insert fortune. Form into shape. Repeat, repeat, repeat. It's so mesmerizing!\n\nAND their cookies are great!!! I never eat the ones served at Chinese restaurants, but I love these! They're fresh and not overly sweet. Best of all, they're thin and crunchy! Yum!! Free samples when you walk in. And more free samples when you buy some cookies! \n\nBe sure to talk to the person in charge. He is so passionate about his work. We asked him so many questions and he just answered and spoke with such enthusiasm!\n\nSo if you ever find yourself in Chinatown, go check out this shop.

It will be a sad day when they stop making it this way and give in to the fast and high production.", "author": "Wolfy W."}

They also do adult fortunes but some of the fortunes are a little lame in the adult bag.  \n\nSome other Yelpers said that the cookies don't taste very good, I would have to disagree.  If they have ever had Asian dessert/snacks, they would know that it's not meant to be too sweet or too anything.  We like our stuff mildly flavored so it'll go great with our oolong tea or green tea.  Don't expect this to taste like American chocolate cookies.  \n\nLike other Yelpers reviewed, taking a picture of the workers will cost you 50 cents per picture unless you can try to sneak one in.

Well, not at the fortune cookie factory.  As most people probably know, fortune cookies are not Chinese and you can witness them being made in America if you know which Chinatown alley to visit. I love seeing how stuff is made and watching the gentleman crank out fortune cookies is no exception.  When you enter the factory, there is about 14 square feet of standing room and you are greeted with a sign that says, \"50 cents if you take a picture,\" or something to that affect.  I'll gladly give this joint 50 cents for a picture!  I really liked that when I had my picture taken, one gentleman (the owner?) said something in Chinese to the fortune cookie maker.  Later I learned that the man must have said smile because I have a great photo with the fortune cookie maker flashing an enthusiastic smile.  What a neat little place.", "author": "Courtney K."}

He swears that they are made with some secret, probably illegal, substance that that makes them so good and I tend to agree.

This made for a somewhat awkward experience.  We stood timidly in the doorway, peering in, trying to figure out if this was the place, until a man inside yelled 'Come in!'\n\nSo we went in, and stood there watching two women at fortune cookie machines pluck burning hot cookie molds from the metal circuits, lay a fortune across the center, and then fold them - all so quick we could barely follow the process.  Except for the machine sounds, it was entirely silent and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in a sweatshop, observing the workers work in a lineup.  Yes, I KNOW that wasn't what was going on, just how my extrapolating, dramatic mind interpreted it.  I'm sure it would have been less creepy had more people been in the space than just us, and had they been conversing, or smiling, or had there been any jollity to the proceedings and/or observations.\n\nIt was, however, really neat to see how fortune cookies are made - who hasn't wondered how they get that paper in there? - and I love that they're willing to show their process to anyone.  They've got free samples all over the place and fortune cookies are definitely better flat and straight off the press.  My boyfriend bought a bag, and I eyed the sesame cookies, but we had just eaten a gigantic order of dim sum from Good Mong Kok and I just couldn't imagine that I would ever be hungry again in my life, so I didn't buy them.

It was quite interesting and I wanted to take a picture. Taking a picture inside of the fortune cookie store costs 50 cents. I think that's a bit outrageous, but I guess it's a way for them to make more money. \n\nThe fortune cookies are pretty cheap though. I got a bag with chocolate and regular fortune cookies for less than $5. If I remember correctly, it was $3.75 and a handful more cookies from the man selling them. \n\nYUM FORTUNE COOKIES.", "author": "Nina Y."}

Jackpot. We found it. Staring us in the eyes is the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory. The old Chinese man sitting in front greets us with a warm smile and directs us to go inside to take a look. \"Hello. Hi. Come in. Hello. Hi.\" repeats the old man.\n\nWe go in to discover that the name of the place perfectly describes the images we are seeing. It really is just a fortune cookie factory. A lady is sitting in the middle of the room folding the hot freshly made fortune cookies from this huge oven/machine/contraption thing. Just think \"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" minus the crazy Willie Wonka, minus the crazy magical effects, and replace chocolate with Fortune Cookie and there you go.\n\nWhen you first walk in, a man on the right side opens some containers and offers you some free samples. On the left side is shelves full of fortune cookies ready to be bought. Each bag is ranges from $3.50 to $5 from what I saw. The lady, which I spoke about earlier, is working like a robot. 1. Grab hot fortune cookie circular dough. 2. Fold in half. 3. Wrap around a metal stick to give the cookie its curve. 4. Place fortune cookie in cookie sheet. 5. Repeat. Now imaging doing this for hours upon hours. I'm pretty sure she doesn't do it all day.... but talk about repetitive stress syndrome! Any lawyers out there?\n\nSo we purchase some bags of fortune cookies to take home. Cash only. The nice thing is when you buy a bag, the guy throws some extra open cookies in the bag for you to snack on while you are on your way. I thought that was a nice touch... Even though he's probably just trying to get rid of the defective ones who didn't quite meet up to the tough fortune cookie standards.\n\nA cool thing happened while I was finished paying. A tourist couple open up a their tourist book and open the page to this place. In the description, there is a picture of that old man in front! That's crazy! The old man comes in, grabs the book and taunts the other workers in jest of his celebrity status. That gave us all a good laugh. On the way out, I had to take a picture with the guy. \n\nA few hours later when I arrived home, I opened my standard Chinatown pink little plastic bag and started munching on the defective fortune cookies. Still crisp and fresh. I smiled with happiness because 1) I was able to feed my hunger and 2) I was finally letting the defective fortune cookies fulfill their destiny.", "author": "Leo C."}

I was immediately greeted with free samples - flattened fortune cookies, and warm at that! The first bite was all I needed to know I was definitely buying a bag of them. They have different flavors, styles, and sizes.

The man forces you to take samples (flat fortune cookies).\n\nNormally I don't eat fortune cookies...you know, the ones they give you for free when you get your check? \n\nBUT THESE FORTUNE COOKIES ARE DIFFERENT. They are so crispy (they stay crispy for WEEKS...how? We probably don't want to know why), fresh and buttery. They are addictive. They must have crack in them, I swear.\n\nMy sister gave me crap about going all the way to SF to buy them. She said a fortune cookie is just a fortune cookie. No. She doesn't understand. \n\nMy roommate demands me to get these for her every time I go home to visit. \n\nTheir chocolate fortune cookies are moderately flavored. You know the Asian chocolate taste? Yes. The fake stuff. But they're quite tasty since they're blended with notes of butter and sesame (read: plain fortune cookie taste).\n\nI recommend getting the assorted mix so you get a taste of everything.\n\nBe aware: many tourists and school children frequent this place....AND no pictures allowed (unless you pay them..haha)\n\nGo and you will never eat the commercial fortune cookies again.\n\nAnd try to only eat one.

I've certainly heard worse in PG-13 movies than what is written on the \"adult\" fortunes.\n\nThe prices are excellent for their wares, just be sure you bring cash as they don't take cards as far as I know...owing to the fact that their \"register\" was simply a jar of bills and change, there was no card machine or drawer.  Also, they request a small tip if you want to take a picture of the place, but it's well worth it.", "author": "Paul W."}

Don't bother writing down the address as none of the street signs are labeled. Know the nearest cross street and look for the unmarked ally that is assuredly Ross Alley. There are no numbers on Golden Gate either, just a small sign with the name, but if you pass close enough, you'll be able to smell hot cookies through the door.\n\nThe owner is very nice. Upon entering the shop, he will shove a basket of chocolate and regular cookies at you, unrolled and broken as sample pieces. Take one of each, then decide what you want. I like the plain misfortune cookies... the unrolled disks that come in packages of like 150 for about $3.50. The chocolate cost $4.50.\n\nIt's worth a trip in the area. It's fun for locals, especially to get some take home treats on your lunchbreak or on your way back from dim sum.

I think that concept is hard to fathom until you have a fresh fortune cookie from the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Co.  These are the BEST fortune cookies you're ever going to find.  Or at least the best ones you're going to find for under $3 a bag in SF China Town.  Lots of vanilla and a great crunchy, yet airy texture.  The shop itself and the difficulty in finding it just makes them all the better.   If you do go, skip the folded ones and get a bag of the \"Unfortunate Cookies\" (the flat ones everyone's been talking about).  You get even more for your money and I happen to think they also taste better. \n\nBe forewarned, if you live or work close to SF Chinatown, these are habit forming.  I used to work 2 blocks from here and had to make frequent visits to replenish my supplies.  Now I have to settle on my mother-in-law bringing us several bags every time she comes to visit us in Omaha.  \n\nOf course I'm also a bit biased because I used their cookies to propose to my wife and they were heavily featured at our wedding reception :-)", "author": "Derek E."}

But little did i know how they were made or how they came about.\n\nAnyways, i was at BORDERS reading a book about the history of CHINATOWN and there was a reference to a famous fortune cookie alley in San Francisco. That alley is ROSS ALLEY, and it's very difficult to find in Chinatown. So.... with my iPHone and with the GPS i located it! It's amazing that I walk by it at least 20 times and never noticed.\n\nBut my new iPhone 3G found it, hahah! The factory is very small with a tiny little sign. There's also a lot of curious tourists who randomly walk by and discover it. Inside is a small room with older employees workin the fortune cookie machines. A rotating conveyor is filled with round chips, and they are all flat. Some of the flat ones are thrown into a nearby can and never become a fortune cookie. Others are folded in half by using a metal rod, and at the same time, a paper slip is placed inside. It is then curved into shape by hand and air dryed.\n\nOk!! I have told you how they are made. But what about the origin of the fortune cookie? They were never invented in China. Some say they were first served in the JAPANESE TEA GARDEN in Golden Gate Park. Others say they were first made in Japan. Even L.A. has bragging rights to the origin of the first fortune cookie. \n\nBut whatever the case, this place on Ross Alley is special. They give you free samples to try, yummm! The cookies are fresh from the oven, so fresh that i can't stop from eating half a bag! ;) Anyways, this is a recommended  place with 5 plus stars. And of course, it's worth taking a picture of the place for 50 cents. \n\nDon't forget bring your friends from out of town here. :) Or to check out the triple x fortune cookies, they are sort of hidden away.", "author": "herm p."}

Four basic kinds of cookies & then variations on the fortune cookie (chocolate, swirls, large & small flat cookies). People look crabby, but they are kind of  nice if that makes any sense.  They do give samples and the fortune cookies are good - not that weird cake batter taste that some fortune cookies have.  It cost $1 for a small bag of fortune cookies and $4.75 for a large bag.  When you are at a Chinese restaurant and you get a fortune cookie after dinner, we always want more, but when you can have as many as you want, how many fortune cookies do you actually want to eat?  We bought a large bag of fortune cookies, a mix of regular and chocolate flavored.  I wish now that I would have bought some of the other cookies, but they seemed to only have large bags of those for sale.  We were in there kind of late in the day, so more variety may be available if you go earlier.   It's interesting to see the ladies working to make the cookies.  Yes, there's a sign saying that it costs 50 cents to take a picture of them working - don't expect them to take notice of you or smile!  I definitely think it's worth finding the place, sampling and buying the cookies, and taking a picture - it's fun.", "author": "TL R."}

They're open late, and when I walked in at 7pm, she asked me if I wanted to pick it up later that evening, and handed me a stack of fresh cookies as she escorted me out the door. \nBest part of all was that I needed a reciept for my expense report.

I combined this with a tour of Chinatown.", "author": "Marina N."}

I can only imagine how many blisters she must have from peeling the hot cookies off of the irons.  But, despite the sweat shop feel it was super cool to see how they are made.", "author": "Ranger G."}

I had no idea making fortune cookies was still such a manual task.  The workers were wearing (non heatproof) latex gloves and literally pulling the cooked batter off from the griddle and shaping them.  \n\nThe owner was sort of bossy and stingy with samples.  She was offering only the regular-flavored fortune cookies (who doesn't know what this tastes like??), and was refusing to give people samples of the chocolate, unless you ask in Chinese.  So don't expect to be able to try all sorts of novelties, as earlier reviews may suggest.  Times must be hard....", "author": "Ana L."}

Okay it is a little dirty and scary looking especially as it starts to get dark out. But do not fear! It is perfectly safe. When you reach the fortune cookie factory it is this tiny hole in the wall with a few ladies making the cookies by HAND on these extremely hot and small machines. Fascinating to watch. You can also eat their broken/mess up cookies for free sometimes as samples. The best part is that they have usual fortune cookies for sale. You can buy chocolate fortune cookies, half choc half regular, and ones with naughty fortunes. Also if you are getting married or have a special occasion, you can talk to them about making custom cookies.  It is worth checking out, even for a few minutes as it is a part of the local flavor. Cash Only! And down the alley jtle further is a training place for a troupe of Dragon Dancers- Check that out too if you can...", "author": "Ella V."}

The owner, Franklin Yee and his staff are very nice, letting you watch the fastest hands in the west as another yelper said crank out fresh, excellent tasting fortune cookies the old fashioned way.  I love the aroma of fresh, hot dough that beckens you into the shop.  I love all of the flat duds that did not make it as they give you quite a few while you are there.  There are plenty of large bags of cookies for purchase; they all have some great fortunes.  Just be forwarned that they charge you for pictures (I think 50 cents. each.)  So, for excellent fortune cookies, a cheery staff, and an eyeopening experience, the Golden Gate Fortune Cookies Company cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

The chocolate ones are to die for, and you can choose from either the traditional fortune cookie or the plain flat ones. And if you every wanted to see how they put in the fortunes, they have an ongoing presentation. Definitely worth the short walk off the main drag of just half-a-block.", "author": "merle s."}
