The chef and his wife do an unsurpassable job running the place and making sure quality/service is top notch.\n\nDefinitely sit at the bar and chat with Wiley. This place is like any other.

There are two dozen other joints within walking distance of this place that offer a much different sushi experience than this one, and if you're looking for a higher-end meal, you should take your business down the road. This is my place for a terrific off-hours, sit-down-and-fill-me-up sushi fix. \n\nOn the weekends and during peak hours, this place can move slowly, which is why I tend to regard people who file in her during those times as out-of-town rubes and malcontents. Every time I've been here -- and that's over two dozen times in 10 years -- the service has been wonderful and the food was outstanding. \n\nEvery. \nSingle. \nTime. \n\nIf you're visiting San Francisco from out of town, may I recommend Ebisu?

There was only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant and it took her a long time to come and take our order. We werent even given tea or water before she took our order. \n\nWe ordered the albacore tataki and it was okay. Nothing special. \n\nThe sashimi moriawase also wasnt great. The fish was decent, but not the freshest Ive had. The salmon was the best out of all the fish, so I wish I wouldve ordered some more salmon rolls. \n\nWe ordered the blue fin tuna roll and the maple leaf roll. Neither rolls were good. Not impressed at all. The other reviews are definitely accurate as the rolls are small. Each roll we ordered came with 6 pieces total and each were really small. The maple leaf tuna sounded good, but the spicy sauce added to it ruined the semi sweet taste from the mango. \n\nLastly, we ordered uni and amaebi. The uni was not as fresh as hoped and the amaebi was fine but the fried heads were not good at all. Fried heads are typically fried to a crisp, but here it tasted like tempura batter.\n\nOverall the dishes were small and for the quality and size, I do not think it was worth it. I would rather pay a bit more for much better quality. The rolls were not cheap either, $12 for 6 small pieces that did not taste good. \n\nThe service was really slow throughout our meal. We waited at least 10 minutes after we ate each dish to get our next dish. Im not sure what the hold up was. The waitress said the restaurant was busy so it was taking a long time, but if thats the case, then dont seat and serve customers if you cant handle that capacity or hire another waiter. At the very least, you should be able to provide hot tea and water refills without me having to ask.\n\nUnfortunately this place missed on service and food. We will not be returning in the future.", "author": "Claire W."}

It was dinner for 2 later in the evening and the restaurant was fairly empty. It took the hostess about 10 minutes to seat us (a good 5 before we were spoken to) and then another 15 minutes to approach us at our table. We were tempted to walk out prior to ordering just given how poor the service was, but hungry people can't be choosy people. And we were on foot that night, too fatigued and low on energy to hunt for another restaurant.\n\nThe dragon roll and soft shell crab appetizer arrived 25 minutes after ordering. Much to my dismay, the portions were petite to put it nicely. I suppose after spending an hour at a restaurant with no food in sight you develop high expectations. The soft shell crab did appear to be freshly prepared as it was hot in temperature. The flavor was balanced, the crab salted and fried evenly, about a total of 4 very small pieces. The dragon roll was miniature with very little eel and even less rice. The avocado was barely visible, with a small piece of cucumber. I couldn't tell you the quality of the eel as the pieces were so small that I barely tasted it. Water and tea were never refilled. The hostess never reappeared until we flagged her down for our check.\n\nDisappointing to say the least. Costly without justification.", "author": "Cici T."}

Me and my brother are out-of-towners just on our vacation and we were just looking for a place nearby our hotel for a few drinks and unfortunately we chose this here establishment.  The service was quick we were in and out within 15 minutes (Quick for the wrong reason.  I was actually looking to spend some good money here for drinks).  Let me tell you of this evening.  It was a rainy days, my jacket wet from the pouring rain as we entered the establishment, not a soul to greet us.  I figure it must be a self seating arrangement so we chose seats at the bar.  At the bar was the sushi chef, an elderly asian man who spoke very little to us.  It seemed so unwelcoming.  After a few minutes a little asian women approaches us and ask us to move to a table if we were ordering food as well.  So, we obliged.  I figure why not have some sushi with drinks?  We moved to the nearest table.  My brother place an order for some sushi it arrived when 60 seconds almost like it was prepare before we arrived.  The portion was terrible and didn't looked up to par to the normal quality of rolled sushi.  Our 2 orders of 20 oz Sapporo beers arrive as well.  And, believe it or not within a couple of minutes so did our check.  Now you tell me what was happening this evening. We haven't even taken a bite of our sushi yet or a sip of our beer.  This place was basically rushing to get us out.  I felt like we didn't fit the mold of there standard clients.  It's okay we won't be here to spend our money in the future.  I always believe that it's awesome to help bring business to mom and pops establishment.  But, I don't think this establishment deserves our business.  I left a very good tip but I felt quite cheated.  Oh well,  I hope this helps some other outer towner.  I end this rant with a message.  I hope this establishment stays successful and I hope they open their eyes to the mistreatment of atypical guest.", "author": "Sam P."}

Nice ambience, decent but really slow service, so don't come here with a growling tummy.\n\n=== Food\nOrdered a Dragon roll (4/5), Spider Roll (4/5) and a Bulls Eye Roll (5/5). The portion and size of sushi are much smaller compared to the many sushi joints i have visited. Typically 2 of the sushi rolls would have filled the two of us, for today, we ordered three sushi rolls! The sushi tasted really good and fresh, which is key especially when for raw sushi. Am keeping this place in my list, pretty sure I will be back for sushi someday if we are around the block.\n\n=== Service\nDecent service but it was unbelievable slow. Three sushi rolls and we spend approximately 1.5 hours in the restaurant. We were not eating slowly by the way, once the plate arrive, we were digging into the food and finish them in less than 5 mins. The ordering, preparing, serving, billing and even asking to have our green tea replenish took quite awhile. \n\nTo a certain extent, i can understand why as they only had 1 server working the floor and looks like theres only 1 sushi chef but i might be wrong. Even so, the server wasn't attentive, we had to ask repeatedly to have our drink replenished and for more wasabi. \n\n== Parking\nStreet parking in this area. No restrictions for weekend. Weekdays - 2 hours parking. You probably have to do quite a bit of circling before you land a good spot. \n\nOverall, i am impressed with the quality of sushi. They are not the omakase standard but definitely one that is above average sushi joints.

My boyfriend and I have been coming here for about a year and a half and it has become not only our favorite sushi spot, but one of our favorite spots in the city, that also holds so many fond memories for us.  We are both foodies and have scoured this city tasting all the great sushi spots....and out of them all, Atami tops our list for several reasons, which are listed below.  \n\nQuality: If you truly enjoy raw fish and are not seeking another gimmicky sushi spot, you will not be disappointed.  The sashimi and nigiri are very fresh and amazing quality!  We have had just about every fish on the menu and our top 4 favorites are Sake Toro, Hamachi Toro, Albacore Toro & Aji. All of these cuts are very tender and have the perfect texture and flavor.  The Albacore Toro is absolutely delicious....it literally melts in your mouth.  If you are going to order rolls, make sure to order the 49er roll and the Crazy roll.  The 49er roll has avocado inside of rice (no seaweed) with salmon and lemon on top.  The lemon is divine, as it is cut VERY thin and adds the perfect flavor without bite.  Also, if you enjoy miso soup, make sure to begin your meal with a cup, as theirs is certainly worth enjoying!\n\nService: A husband, wife and son own and run the restaurant.  You can tell they put their heart and soul into ensuring their customers have the best quality fish and overall experience.  We have a tendency of coming to eat a bit late and they have never once turned us down, but welcomed us without hesitation.  The wait is standard with what you would find at most sushi spots.  We typically enjoy wine or sake when eating at Atami and have never had to wait for beverages.

We were more than ready to sit down, relax, and enjoy some good food- all of which was offered at Atami Sushi. The menu was more limited than I'm use to, but everything we ordered came out fantastic. It was all about quality over quantity here. We ordered several rolls to split: the Red Devil, Elegant Roll, and the Hurricane Roll. Each came out one by one which turned out to be a good thing since it allowed me to actually taste and savor every bite. The food is on the pricier end given that there is only 6 small pieces per order, but everything tasted so fresh and the combinations were unique. The Red Devil is definitely added to my mental list of \"best sushi rolls I've tried.\"", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Not too big, but it was perfect & just what we were looking for.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-02", "description": "I am currently staying at the Francisco Inn on Lombard and Franklin street. I wanted to have a good last meal before going back to New York and I was craving sushi. Since I didn't have a car, I wanted somewhere close yet good. Now I LOVE SUSHI and although I will admit that I sometimes eat at those 50% off sushi places  in NYC, when I do splurge on good quality... I always expect the best of the best.\n\nSo I found this place and it was down the block from the motel and decided to give it a try. So here's the breakdown:\n\nRestaurant Environment and Service:\nThe place itself is quite small and mainly should be enjoyed as a more intimate setting. Large parties I would not suggest it. But the place itself is very nice and quiet. So you can easily unravel and relax in this place.\nService wise... It is run by two to three people max. Two, who are the owners... One does the sushi and the other is the waitress. The third I'm not sure what he does... But because of this... Service is slow as stated by past reviewers. So when you come here make sure you're in the mood to really sit and relax while enjoying the food. If your in a rush DO NOT come here.  But either than that... The people are ridiculously nice and welcoming. \n\nFood:\nSo of course eating raw fish... It is a concern if the food is good or not. I decided to try three items, each of a different variety of the menu. I ordered the Kaze (I think that's the name) which Is 8 pieces of salmon sashimi, unagi nigiri, and a kamikaze roll (spicy tuna inside with ahi tuna outside)\nSalmon sashimi (~$14)- delicious! Fresh tasting and almost melts in your mouth. \nUnagi (~$6)- fresh tasting and actually quite surprisingly satisfying. I'm so used to eel just cooked with the sauce on top but for this they put the eel in the oven to make the outside a little crispy and then out just a good amount if sauce... Nothing over the top. This was definitely one of my top choices out of the three.\nKamikaze roll (~$12)- this one was okay. The spicy tuna did have quite a unique preparation. I've been very used to it being minced and mixed with the spicy sauce but this seems to be a whole piece marinated or lathered with some of the spicy sauce. That was the part that wash emo st unique but overall I would say this roll was okay. \n\nCost:\nSo this place was a little bit expensive, but I think it is worth it considering some of the very good tasting sushi and also the service and environment. The bill totaled to about $33.00 and some change. \n\nOverall: 4.0/5\nI would suggest this place to those who wants to relax and really enjoy their dinner. So that means they are in no rush... Since dishes seem to come out one after the other. While eating I see many locals order take out and some seem to be regulars being known by name and everything. The food is quite good and considering how some of the food is made quite unique compared to other sushi restaurants, it is worth a try.", "author": "Anthony T."}

When I eat here I just tell the chef to serve omakase (means \"I trust you\") but if you are not that trusting try the Aji and the sunomono salad. Absolutely mind blowing experience every time.

It was a spicy tuna based roll with tempura crunch and topped with albacore and green onion. I had the chirashi like I usually do with all new Japanese/Sushi restaurants I go to - it is how I judge their quality of sushi. Afterall chirashi (scattered sashimi on top of sushi rice) is essentially a giant piece of sushi! \n\nSad to say, the chirashi was a bit of a disappointment. There was not that much sashimi on top and the rice was quite warm/hot. Big mistakes in my book. I'm used to chirashi bowls so overfilled with an assortment of fish that I don't know where to put it all so I can get to my nice cool/cold sushi rice. The rice was warm/hot which warmed my sashimi pieces to an unpleasant lukewarm temperature. There was not enough fish. Also, service was slow. \n\nParking is also very tricky! Sharp turn in a moderately trafficked street (Lombard) with little room to maneuver. \n\nThere are so many better places in the city to go to.

Each item came out separately. The butterfish was cold, delicate and fresh, the way it should be. The udon came out next. The broth was perfect; not overly salty yet not boring nor bland. The burrito roll was wrapped in rice paper and filled with blue fin tuna, maguro and avocado. Good, but I liked the blue Hawaii roll better which was blue fin tuna and avocado wrapped in either albacore or hamachi, I can't remember.\n\nWe were in the neighborhood hungry for sushi yesterday, and Umami and Yuzu (both of which I've bookmarked and am waiting patiently to try) were both closed for the holiday weekend, so we opted for Atami.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-06", "description": "It makes me sad to see that 3 stars is labeled as \"A-OK\" on Yelp because this place was better than A-OK. However, I don't wanna give it a 4-star \"Yay! I'm a Fan!\" because of a few things. --- I'd like to quote Fred S. (down below on this page) who phrased it perfectly: \"If this restaurant were in another city, I'd go back, but in SF, I'll keep trying.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start with the positives: \nVery fresh fish. \nMy boyfriend and I started with the spicy tuna roll, which was the usual mashed tuna (not whole pieces, like some people prefer). Very tasty tuna though. You could tell it's not because they had bad quality fish that they mashed it. \nThen came the caterpillar roll. The unagi was inside with some very finely chopped cucumbers and the avocados were on top. This was way better than standard caterpillar rolls. The unagi melts in your mouth while the fresh, crunchy cucumber adds the perfect texture. \nThen we had the spider roll. This was good, but my least favorite. \n\nBecause that wasn't enough (refer to the negatives below), especially for my boyfriend, he ordered tonkatsu and I got a saba nigiri. \n\nSaba nigiri is a good indicator of whether the restaurant has good fish or not. Atami passes! Yummyyy! It melted in my mouth and wasn't overly fishy. Perfect. \n \nThe tonkatsu was really good too. It was almost as good as my mom makes it-- I have never had tonkatsu as good as my mom's at a restaurant. It's always either too thin, and thus too crispy/hard, or they use the bad part of the meat that's stringy or fat-heavy. This was the right thickness and the right amount of breading. :) Props to them for getting this right. \n\nThe negatives:\nThe only negative is the small portion! Usually, one roll is enough for me. Ok, maybe 1.5. It's probably fair considering how good they are, but I'm just not used to having to pay so much for sushi (in America). \nWhen the seaweed salad came, it was the smallest portion of seaweed salad I have ever had. I thought, well, the rolls may be different. When spicy tuna ($6) came, I thought it was just small because it was one of the non-special rolls. When the caterpillar roll ($10) came and it was also... tiny, I was sad :(  The only thing that was the same size as other places I've been to was the tonkatsu ($13.95). \n\nI would choose quality over quantity when it comes to sushi, but there's gotta be a place that serves just a liiiitle bit more. IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, GO HERE! THE FOOD IS GREAT!\n\nNo more negatives. The waitress here was really sweet, and the chefs looked friendly too. The place is really clean and has quite an \"authentic\" Japanese look to it.", "author": "Saori E."}

Very clean, sharp attention to detail and amazing presentation are all complimented by the personal and friendly service.  As someone who is not very adventurous when it comes to fish, Atami is the ONE location where I will try any dish, from Rolls to Sashimi.  Very fresh food and always served with a smile.  A must try.  Of all the sushi restaurants in SF this is the best.\nIf you're looking for a hip trendy spot, this is not it.  The music is soft and the lighting gentle so you can see and hear the people you're with.  It's not a fast food joint so don't expect to get in and out in 20 minutes.

I pass by this place on a daily basis, but have never made the trek to see what it's all about.  I've read the yelp reviews and wondered if I could really trust any of the ratings anymore.\n\nThe Glowing neon from the \"Atami\" logo signals you are close to your awaiting sushi adventure.  The entryway has well groomed plants and clean lines which reflects the interior.  This is not like most of the other joints on Lombard where you find a funky canopy and dirty flower boxes.  \n\nUpon a 9 o'clock entry on Saturday night, the place was jam packed with only 2 open spots at the sushi bar (I believe there are 5 or 6 seats at the bar).  Normally, I prefer to sit at the bar to see the sushi chef work their magic.  With 3 people total, a table was a more viable option.  Once the hostess/waitress got around to us, she offered a table or bar seat.  Apparently we overlooked the fact that somebody had actually left and there really were 3 seats.  Score!\n\nSince the place was bursting at the seams, we had to wait to get anything.  It didn't help not knowing what we wanted, although edamame, beer, and sake were standard sushi necessities.  Once we got down to ordering, things flowed smoothly.  Rolls to get:  Dragon roll and the Burrito roll.  We had two other rolls, but I can't remember the names.  My dining companions appeared to like them a lot, whereas I was preferring the burrito roll.  Note, the burrito roll has a non-seaweed wrapper which makes it stick out.  All of the fish we sampled was excellent.  I particularly liked the white tuna out of everything (torro, big red, yellowtail, jack fish).\n\nI can't say if the place has a great sake list, as we never got to see one.  I'd be interested to see what options we might have had.  Maybe next time when I go back.  \n\nHighlights:  fresh fish, a few really well done rolls, excellent service (everybody seems to know Michelle!)\n\nI'd say yelp has come through on this one.  The place has great sashimi and rolls.", "author": "Simon Y."}

The Dragon Roll is usually the tastiest one but here it was just OK, small pieces of eel, shrimp tempura is a bit dry, no unagi sauce in sight. Rainbow Roll and others were good, the fish was super fresh and a lot of it, very little rice.\nI also ordered seaweed salad and in my opinion the portion was just RIDICULOUSLY small for $4.00, it was probably 1/2-3/4 of a cup.\n\nThe service was great but for about $50 carry out order I was expecting a little more quantity.

I love how they bring each roll out one-at-a-time, so you're not just stuffing your face with everything all at once (which, come on...  it's hard not to stuff your face when they bring it all at once).   The burrito roll (on the specials menu) was also fantastic and the service was perfect.  If I had to pick one gripe, it would be that certain things were a little bit too pricey.  I don't like paying $11 for a small salad with barely ANY fish on it, but maybe they're just trying to keep up with all the other marina sushi joints.  Every sushi lover should try this place -- and be sure to order the blue fin tuna nigiri!  YUM!", "author": "Jacquie M."}

The service was fast and friendly (but I was also only 1 of 2 people there at the time).  The sushi was definitely delicious but a little pricey for the size of the rolls.  I know that area is high rent though.", "author": "C C."}

It is small with a very small staff but offers consistently  fresh sushi and friendly service. I always order sashimi. A bit pricey, but worth it.", "author": "Angel K."}

Michelle and her husband run the whole operation so you get very individual and personal service.  Parking in the back is a plus on a rainy night...", "author": "Ryan K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-07", "description": "We approached the door and saw that not a single person was inside the place. Doesn't that usually foretell negative food quality? Or is that merely a psychological game we play with ourselves -  we want what everyone else wants. It was 7pm, but there we were, the only ones in the restaurant.  \n\nHere's what we ordered:\nSunomono salad\nSeared Ahi tuna\nSake Nigiri\nHamachi Nigiri\nHurricane Roll - spicy tuna with tempura with albacore on the outside\n\nThe food was fresh with zero hints of fishy taste/smell. If you want quality sushi without all the sauces to hide the real fish, this is the place for you.\n\nService was excellent, attentive, yet not overbearing. This will definitely will be one of my normal sushi spots going forward.", "author": "Jason F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-10", "description": "This is a great Marina sushi spot.  Our friends told us about it as an alternative to our previous \"go-to.\"  It is usually not crowded at all and the service is wonderful. We have had the same women serve us every time and she is always smiling and very friendly.  \r\n\r\nThe special rolls are always a good choice and traditional ones like Saki Maki are solid.  Not the right place to go to for boys night saki bombs, but perfect for a relaxing weekday sushi craving.", "author": "Robert D."}

We finally made the decision to check it out with some of our friends visiting from the east bay.  Its a very quaint little spot.  The service was very friendly, we made a reservation at 6pm on Saturday for an 8:30pm seating and we sat right down.   \n\nThe six of us that went to dinner are all sushi lovers and we loved the food.  The fish was very fresh, the rolls were creative (but not over the top), and the atmosphere was very comfortable.  We ate and drank for over 2 1/2 hours and never felt rushed.  It was a great dining experience, and affordable.  We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\nThe only reason that I didn't give it a 5-star rating is that the background music wasn't my specific taste.  It was sort of that Muzac-style automated music that is piped in from a subscription service.  Its wasn't terrible, but the background music could be slightly improved in my opinion.  All-in-all, its a fabulous spot for sushi in the city!", "author": "Marc G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-23", "description": "Ahhh... my favorite neighborhood sushi place!!! No place like this one. It's run by lovely Michelle and her husband. AMAZING rolls in my opinion. Creative, and not an overdone mess that ends up all over your shirt and table. Each one is unique: Buritto roll is excellent. There is one that is heated and is to die for! The Deluxe maybe? My girlfriends and I used to go once a week... now less since we all have b.f.'s. Another huge plus is that there is parking in the back. When one of my girlfriends moved out of the area, Michelle brought us smiles and a complimentary sake. They work hard to take care of their loyal customers. A good family with a good business!", "author": "B H."}
