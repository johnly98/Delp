Everything is fairly priced and the quality is the best I've had compared to other dimsum Togo spots.\n\nThis is a cash only place . So make sure you brought enough! It's easy to get carried away \n\nThe big bun - cheap $2-3(forgot T_T) and super filling but it taste good too! A large sized bao stuffed with chicken, chinese sausage, boiled egg, mushroom and delicious flavors \n\nChinese tamale - it is freakin so tasty and huge !surrounded with sticky rice. The filling contains salted egg yolk, chinese sausage, fatty pork, lean pork, shiitake mushroom, lotus seeds, chestnut .. it is freakin tasty . Yes I said it twice \n\nBlack sesame paste dessert - think of it as a thicken soup instead of a paste. If you never had it before than you would just have to try to see if you like the texture. But I think this is the best black sesame paste you can get around unless you make your own from scratch or go to a very nice chinese restaurant that may serve it which  is rare to none. Taste like black sesame and not watered down glob like most places \n\nWhite sugar cake (bak tong go)- the white sponge looking thing. Slightly sweet classic dimsum dessert. I don't know how I should explain the texture but this place makes it right. Why? Because you know it's good when it doesn't have a sour taste to it. Has to do with the steaming process I've heard. \n\nSteamed pudding ( boot jai go ) I don't know the English name for this but it's just another classic old style dessert that's steamed in bowls with some red beans in it and taken out and cooled before eaten. Rarely any places makes this but I could be wrong \n\nAll the other stuff is decent. I mean it's a to go spot !", "author": "Myron L."}

Because, it is solid. Real solid.\n\nBy solid I don't mean the next Koi Palace or Yank Sing. Don't expect caviar or fancy roe sprinkled on your shumai. However, by solid I will sign off that TC Pastry is one of the better take out dim sum joints in SF. Better than most spots in Chinatown or on Clement St.\n\nTheir Chicken and pork dumplings (shu mai) were excellent. Rice paper skin not too soggy but overall it's also not too dry. I thought it was done right. Oh, and their price - 3 dumplings for $2.25 - I mean, we unwillingly spend way more on SF restaurant's \"health inspection fee\"\n\nAnother winner is the lotus leaf wrapped rice with mince pork.

We went in the late afternoon so many of their more popular items were already sold out. I was lucky enough to snag the last egg tart. They have all kinds of dim sum items, from rice rolls to vegetarian buns to curry pastries. In addition, they have some cooked dishes (e.g., fried rice, chow mein) and some dessert items. Everything is extremely cheap here, and you can get a very filling meal for just a few dollars. \n\nMy dad and I were just looking for a light snack, so we got one egg tart, one mango pudding, and one tofu pudding. The egg tart cost $1.20, and it was pretty solid. The pastry shell was flaky and buttery, and the custard filling was soft and creamy. The mango pudding came in a small container and cost about $2.50. The flavoring tasted very artificial, but it was still tasty. The consistency was smooth and velvety. I didn't try the tofu pudding but my dad complained that it was room temperature even though they advertised it as hot. Worst of all, there were black spots in his tofu pudding. I'm not sure what the spots were but it looked like mold. \n\nFood safety is extremely questionable here. The store was pretty dirty, and the staff didn't pay much attention to proper food handling. I was thinking of buying a box of pastries to take home to my family, but after finding the black spots in my dad's tofu pudding, I decided against that idea. The staff were unfriendly and rushed us when we ordered and snapped at us when we asked for napkins. Also, they charge 25 cents for each to go container.\n\nThere's no doubt that TC has cheap prices and a large selection, but it's not worth getting food poisoning for.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

Worth & Yummy!\n\nAfter grabbing iTea, I was just looking for a salty snack to complement the sweetness of my drink, and I happened to stumble upon this humble dim sum express. One word to explain this place would be utility because their interior and presentation did not appear so appealing. But, don't just the book by its cover, the food was awesome and extremely cheap!\n\nWHAT I ORDERED: (3) Sesame Ball & (3) Deep Fried Curry Pastry = $5.05.\n\nWhen I came in during the late afternoon, due to my cynicism, I just assumed what I bought would be somewhat stale or hardened. It didn't look too good through the displays, and I didn't check Yelp prior to see their positive reviews until after I took a bite in my order. \n\nBoy, was I wrong... the quality was good! The Sesame Ball had a nice mochi texture and a sweet yellow lotus filling that was simply delicious. The Deep Fried Curry Pastry was lightly crunchy on the outside and savory on the inside from its curry filling. Plus, both the size and quantity was enough to share with another person---which I gladly did not since it was too delish!\n\nTo add on top of that, for non-Chinese speakers, although workers mainly speak Chinese there, there are English labels on the display to help out, and the workers can get by through simple English. Customer service was good too. I look young, and they treated me fairly so no complaints there. There may be cultural differences, but hey, it's the food that counts.  \n\nOverall, next time I decide to visit the Golden Gate Park, I'm definitely first going to stop by here to satisfy my afternoon munchies, especially when it's low-cost and high-quality.", "author": "Linda X."}

Congee, chinese porridge, jook, whatever you wanna call it. And I wanted it with preserved egg (or leather egg, thousand year old egg, it has so many names)! Since my parents were going to be in the Sunset, my mom brought me some jook and dim sum from TC Pastry. It was Saturday, October 3rd around 2:30pm.\n\n*Rice porridge with duck egg\n*Chinese donut\n\nMy mom made me pei dan sau yuk jook (rice porridge with duck egg, it comes with pork too) a lot when I was little, so I crave it often when I'm sick or if I just want something comforting. Their version had a good amount of egg and good flavor. To me, jook is not complete without a yau ja gwai (chinese donut)! Theirs was super oily, so I had to take numerous paper towels to soak up all the oil. It was crispy on the outside and soft inside, so once I soaked up the oil, I had my little bowl of comfort.\n\n*Fresh shrimp crepe roll\n*Shrimp dumpling\n*Pork dumpling\n*Sticky rice ball with Chinese sausage\n*Mini egg custard\n\nSince I've have TC Pastry bookmarked for their dim sum, I asked my mom to grab me some. Their ha gow (shrimp dumpling) and ha cheong (fresh shrimp crepe roll) were both tasty. The shrimp was tender in both and the wrappers soft with a slight chew. The siu mai (pork dumpling) was just okay. I've had better. Sticky rice buns are another item that remind me of being a kid. Unfortunately it got soggy in the bag and could have used a little more sausage, but it fulfilled my sticky rice craving. I'd pass next time on the mini dan tats (egg custard). The crust is the cake kind, not the flaky one and they weren't very good. Kinda wished my mom had bought me a regular big dan tat instead.\n\nWhile their dim sum was okay, their porridge provided me the comfort I needed when I wasn't feeling well.

Not too shabby, good place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood for a cheap snack or lunch. \n\nRating Breakdown:\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nI saw the zhaliang on display and I knew I had to try it. For those of you who are unfamiliar, it's basically a fried Chinese donut, wrapped in steamed rice noodles, and topped with sweet soy sauce and peanut sauce. Definitely worth trying, but it's a LOT, so bring a friend or two to share with. Leftover zhaliang are no good = soggy mess. They cut the pieces into these huge chunks. I made the mistake of making eye contact with the lady behind the counter just as I stuffed an entire piece, smothered in peanut sauce, into my mouth. Let's just say this is one eligible med student she will NOT be introducing her son to. \n\nThe dim sum items were pretty disappointing. I got a turnip cake and two shumai (beef and pork) and they were served cold. The beef shumai had tendon chunks in it that kept getting stuck in my teeth. \n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nAt about 70cents a piece for dim sum ($2.00-$2.10 for 3 pieces), you get what you paid for. Maybe they'll taste better if you take them home and nuke 'em in the microwave first? Also, the heaping portion of zhaliang that you get for less than $3 (I think it was $2.70?) is a great deal!\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nTypical dim sum place where you have to use a lot of pointing to order if you don't speak some form of Chinese. The ladies behind the counter spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin. My one complaint was that when I asked for extra sweet soy sauce for my zhaliang, the lady said it would cost extra. What. Serious? For soy sauce? C'mon.\n\nCan I give half a bonus star? Well, this is my arbitrary system so I say I can.

I can see how it is popular though.  There's always a line out the door and these are my guesses: a) there is no other dim sum take out place close by b) it's cheap c) the portions are big d) service is quick.  I suppose it can satisfy for a quick dim sum fix or if you're planning on carb loading, but don't get your hopes up too high on the quality.  I don't normally crave dim sum, but that's what I wanted after returning from a trip to Amsterdam.  Being in a hurry, I thought to just get take out on my way to run errands that morning.  \n\nYes, there was quite a line to the counter once inside.  I will comment that the actual space where you can eat is dirty.  There are a few tables if you opt to stay in but the place itself is not too appealing, so your best bet is take out.  That morning, we picked up an assortment of items including the pork/thousand year old egg porridge, custard buns, beef rice roll, chicken/bitter melon rice roll, shrimp rice roll, shrimp dumplings (ha-gow), and beef sui-mai.  Definitely \"American\" sized dim sum.  We spend about $20 and had 2 bags of food.  I will say that the porridge was the best, following the custard buns.  I did not like any of the rice rolls at all.  The rice noodle itself was so thick, greasy and chewy.  None of the fillings were adequate.  The meats were cheap and you mostly just get a bunch of thick plain rice rolls.  I thought the chicken/bitter melon flavor would be like the ones you get at a dim sum restaurant.  Wrong!  There was but one little piece of bitter melon and a few bits of mashed together ground chicken.  Ha-gow didn't seem that fresh as the shrimp was mushy.  The wrapper was also very thick.  I did not try the sui-mai, but the other half said it was filled with fatty meat.  \n\nOverall, probably won't be going back.  I took a swing in the dark, and missed on this one.  Will need to actually go to a dim sum restaurant next time instead.  Parking is tough on Irving, so not really worth it for me to go through the trouble for TCP.", "author": "Liv A."}

They make them to order and in addition to the sweet soy sauce that I'm accustomed to having with zhaliang, they give you the option of adding peanut butter sauce. Friggin' orgasmic, folks.\n\nThe jumbo zongzi (glutinous rice stuffed with chestnuts, chicken, sausage, salted egg and steamed in a bamboo leaf) is also ridiculous. I was buying the ones from Guangdong BBQ across the street but the ones here are tastier. If you want to be healthier though I do recommend the one from Guangdong BBQ.\n\nThe majority of the other buns and dim sum items range from 2-3 stars for me. An hour before closing you can get 3 items for $1.45 which is a pretty good deal. It's cash only and the ladies are overall pleasant (not as nice as the ones over at Hing Wang, but nicer than at Happy Bakery). Solid option for fast food dim sum if you're in the area but worth a 30 min drive if you're craving authentic zhaliang for breakfast.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

My friend was I charge of getting three of everything for our party. She came back with a tray full of savories. One of my favorite dim sums is the fried taro. Unfortunately, TC's was a little on the greasy side to me. Instead of biting into a crisp shell, I got crunch and oil. Not so appetizing. I think it might have just sat too long by the time we got to it. The other dishes were more inviting. Also, I tried a couple of new items today. There was what I like to call a \"tofu chicken sandwich.\" It was tofu stuffed with a chicken patty of sorts wrapped in tofu skin. There was also a mini omelette type patty with mixed veggies and pork. The salt was well balanced in the various dishes and sauces. I especially liked the dumpling with watercress and dipping it in their chili sauce.\n\nThere are a few tables inside, but most people ordered to-go. I'm curious about their rice porridge (we didn't get it this time because we didn't want to get full off of one dish); someone across the way got it and he made it look good.", "author": "Erin G."}

Yes, other cheap dim sum places have the usual chinese donut, custard tarts, shrimp dumplings, sesame balls, etc., but TC has SO MANY OTHER dim sum that are tasty that I've never seen before.  For example, they serve very tasty savory curried pastry puffs with chicken or beef or bbq pork in a golden baked just right pastry.  They have dim sum with taro, etc. I and my sister like their food so much there that we can spend over $30 easily in one trip just to take home for later.\n\nIf it's behind the counter for a while, it may not be as fresh as it COULD be.

The potstickers are good. \n\nI always enjoy their shrimp dumplings, fried wontons, and pork dumplings. Next time I go I'll branch out and try some new things; last time I was enticed by their wonton soup but the will to consume a series of dumplings overpowered me. \n\nMinus a star for the slightly slovenly environment.

I just love dumplings and buns so much. CAN'T STOP WON'T STOP. \n\nI chose three things: shrimp, chive water chestnut dumplings (3 for $1.85), beef rice roll ($2.10), and pork buns (3 for $2).  I chose the dumplings based on the old Chinese lady ahead of me buying a ton. I figured she knew what to get here, even though instincts told me not to buy dumplings that were just sitting on a tray and not in a steamer.  The filling was good, but the skin of one dumpling was dry and hard. I guess I got stuck with an old one.  The rice roll was pretty thick. I like it. The best thing was definitely the steamed pork bun. The filling was delicious! While eating them, I thought about how happy and rich I'd be if I only ate those pork buns for breakfast lunch and dinner.  It's a shame they're not better for you. \n\nI wouldn't consider this place a destination by any means, but if you're in the neighborhood and want some cheap Chinese food, here's your place.", "author": "Jenn C."}

I take them home to freeze and pull them out whenever we have a craving. I'd re-steam them since microwaving would mess up the pastries. Sure, the front/dining room area may not look sparkling clean but this place is not a 5-star restaurant. I've been to some nice dim sum restaurants and you're paying for the privilege to be served. There was one dim sum restaurant that I thought was nice that I took my kids to for some dim sum, saw there was some black flakes in one of the dim sum bamboo steamers.. I looked closely and it had tiny legs. It was steamed ants in the dim sim. Told the head waiter. Head waiter looked at the dim sim, picked up the bits that had the ants, smooshed it onto my daughter's plate and comped only that particular dim sim plate and ordered a new one for us. Gross. A few minutes later, there was a distinct odor of Black Flag coming from the kitchen area. We haven't gone back there and that restaurant is no longer there.

I particularly like the 'Fun Gor\" I think it's called (meat, chives and peanuts) and the mixed veggie/shrimp dumpling. \n\nTheir buns are ok. Too doughy for my taste, but the fillings are good.

LOL but l wish that the filling is mixed better. One bit is of mushrooms and the other is of radish, so inconsistent. but I like that they slice the mushroom, other places they just put the whole mushroom in the bun. \n\nThe last time I went they had rice dumplings (zong zi), I had the meat one.

What is that dumpling contraption with shrimp? Who knows, go for it. Is that a shard of glass in my pot sticker? Yolo. \n\nThe review is solely based on two things: the baked pork bun and the chicken pie.\n\nThe baked pork bun gives victors a solid run for its money. Victors is better size wise but is a little pricier whereas TC's baked pork buns are a solid mix of sweet and salty; the bun is in a sweet bun with perfectly seasoned bbq pork tickling all taste buds leaving your mind blown (and pocket happy @ 3 for $1.70? wuttttt?!). don't want 3 pork buns? Suck it up and bask in the carb-y salty/sweet goodness my friends. It's been a rough week in the office and your significant other is cheating on you, you deserve it.\n\nChicken pie: have you woken up in the middle of the night, sweating your ass off begging for a chicken pot pie? ME TOO! If you say no, you're un-American and a liar. Every time I hear someone say \"chicken pot pie\" I get happy three times and so should you. So you rush on over to your nearest safeway, tear open the freezer doors and you stare Marie calendar dead in the eyes as she is about to feel defeat as your craving will be satisfied. And then it happens: half way through your indulgence you're just tired of the chicken/pea/carrot/bread combo and toss the rest and do the walk of shame back to bed. Here is the beautiful balance TC pastry offers:  A CHICKEN POT PIE THAT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. Boom, that just happened. After one orgasmic bite, you feel the love that chicken pot pies give you, the consistency you deserve and a serving size that tickles every craving your belly can work up. best part, SWEET BREAD. TC pastry has mastered the sweet/salty and for this I am grateful, and so should you.\n\nSide notes: all of the other dim sum is good. Standard, but nothing to write home about.\n\nBut for god sake, do yourself a favor and scrounge up $3 and step into pastry heaven.

We got there about 1130 and is wasn't too busy.  It is true the servers seemed bored, but they were efficient.  There was a strange looking guy in the back drinking some tea and later a can of Coke staring out at the customers.  Maybe he was making sure that the servers were giving out any freebies.\n\nWe ordered our standard of a couple of steam pork buns, hom fun (sort of a rice roll), chive dumplings, pork siu mai, har gow, and something that I can't remember.  The price per three items was about $1.75 - no super bargain since Happy Bakery across the street charges about $1.50 for similar.  We were going to eat our lunch there so they gave us a plastic tray and the dim sum was in a flop top plastic container (like a sandwich container).  We got our own plastic forks and started to chow down.\n\nThe food was cold!. I don't mean luke warm, it was cold. Even though we told them that we were eating in, they didn't bother heating it up for us.  Soon the line got a little longer and we didn't feel like asking them to warm it up for us.  If we did, we probably would have received the evil eye.  It was tasty, except the pork buns were not too good.  They charge extra for tea.  Additionally, they charge sales tax when most dim sum places like this already include the tax with the price.\n\nThe interior is typical of Chinese to go places - a little dirty and greasy.

We buy a dozen and then freeze them and when we want a bun, just pop it in the microwave to defrost and then steam it and voila, a fresh pork bun!\n\nThe size of the bun is average and the bun itself is light, fluffy and squishy. There's a good amount of meat and sauce inside and the pork is in small pieces and soft. The sauce is thick and rich with flavor. There's a good ratio between bun and meat/sauce.\n\nService is quick and efficient with some pushing in line. All standards in Chinese take out places.

TCP, which is just down the street from me, offers some tasty-looking treats that loc's seem to love.  As much as I wanted to try everything, I was just there for one thing: a baked pork bun.\n\nUpon seeing them, I was astounded at how small they were; about 3 - 3.5 inches in diameter which is tiny compared to other take-out buns.  It was only 60 cents, though, so I really can't complain. \n\nIt was heavily dusted in flour, something strange and new in my world of glazed-over bbq buns.  I took a bite and immediately noticed the sandpapery texture of the outside, not unlike that of a cat's tongue.  Fortunately for me, it was not filled with cat tongue (something that I had grown accustomed to living in Hawaii (all people from Hilo are in on this old manapua joke)) but rather it was filled with a moderately tasty, not-so-syrupy filling.  It had cubes of pork that were all a uniform in size, and were quite delicious, with a great sauce-to-meat ratio.  That aftertaste of red char siu was pleasantly moderate.\n\nThis bun would be a solid four-stars if were not for the offensive texture of the bun so I give it a \"3\", but I'll rate my experience at TCP as a \"4\".", "author": "Thomas M."}

They now have four...count it...one, two, three, four...little tables to sit down and gulp down these little delights.  It's great for a quick bite and easy on your wallet.  I particularly like their dried shrimp crepes (har cheung fun) with chili paste.  Mmmmm mmmmm good.  The shrimp dumplings (har gow) are also excellent.  Good chicken buns too!", "author": "JeFF T."}

Definitely one of the better take out dim sum places in SF. \n\nThings I've tried:\n- mushroom/vegetable steamed bun: 5 stars - delicious.  Just the right balance of veggies.\n- curry puff: 5 stars - the dough is fairly sweet, which balances well with the curry filling, that is just a little bit spicy.\n- shrimp and chive dumplings: 5 stars - just enough texture and flavor in a thin translucent skin.\n- steamed rice noodle with shrimp: 5 stars - big pieces of shrimp in a tender rice noodle -- three big pieces for $2!\n- steamed rice noodle with vegetable: 5 stars - it's the same filling as the mushroom/veggie bun - mushrooms, black fungus, carrot\n- potsticker: 4 stars - the filling was not heavy at all.  I think there was shrimp and pork in it. \n- steamed rice noodle with bitter melon a\nnd chicken: 4 stars - I liked the bitter melon, but wasn't that crazy about the chicken filling.", "author": "lovetoeat p."}

Food is fairly well labeled in English for those who are Chinese-language challenged like myself.  The ingredients and skin of the dim sum seems of higher quality compared with those of other take-out joints.  Big variety.  Huge bargain compared with restaurant dim sum (though of course there are compromises).  My favorite, if I can make it there by noon-ish, is the fried donut wrapped with rice noodle.  Egg rolls, sesame balls, and coconut red bean balls are also a hit. The staff are bilingual; I wouldn't say customer service is their strong suit, however, at least they smile at you most of the time.  Four tables available...but don't expect them to be super clean....", "author": "Kim T."}

Some things I've tried:\n\n- curry puff: the crust was good. It was on the sweet side, which was interesting. The curry inside was pretty satisfying!\n- chicken pot pie: the crust was the same as the curry puff! I didn't really enjoy this as much, probably because of the filling. Meh, I'm not too big of a fan of pot pies either..\n- hot n spicy wonton: THIS WAS GOOD! I think it may have been because of the fried wonton wrappers, but the curry inside reminds me of my grandma's. i'm not really sure what was in this (I gobbled it up so quickly) but I think it was just cabbage or something? Not sure.. They're small, but you can get 5 for like 1.25. \n- soy milk: This is pretty good! It's different, because it's homemade. I think it's less than a dollar a cup too. Goes well with the dim sum!\n- Curry Fish balls: Mmm. They're not that spicy (which I wanted) but still good.\n- Fried Dough wrapped in Rice Noodle Roll: For some reason, the name made it sound better than it was. It does come with soy sauce, and peanut sauce (which I like) but I wasn't that wowed by it\n- Coconut Balls: SO GOOD!! I like it when they're slightly cold (but not hard)\n\nThey also have some other things I want to try in the future, like the taro puff, and the black sesame soupy thing.  I will definitely return in the future!", "author": "Bub B."}

Uncertain whether the \"kitchen\" at TC Pastry would be closed by the time I arrived, I called in my order. I don't know much about dim sum, and certainly don't know the names of dishes. I asked for recommendations over the phone, and everything sounded good. I figured we could take care of $20 worth of food, no problem. To my surprise, I arrived at the restaurant and found three massive plastic containers filled with food, and more in a bag, all coming out to about $18.50. We got rid of half of it, and it was still $10.83 for so much food. The spicy deep fried pork rolls were my favorite. Everything else was so-so. We only managed to eat 2/3 of it. Overall, the place was pretty good. The quality was sub-par, and most dishes tasted identical. I won't go back, but wish the best to the friendly folks who run it.", "author": "Kevin A."}

TC is pretty much a take-out Dim Sum place with 4 tables if you want to get a quick bite, but what a gem of a place!  The Won Tons in the Won Ton Noodle soup are  meaty with a good sized piece shrimp (if not the whole shrimp) in each dumpling, the noodles are simple but just the right texture and the soup is light and simple.  All this for about 4 bucks!  Other favorites here are the 1000 year old egg & pork jook and the fish & peanut jook.  TC also offers a nice variety of Rice Rolls (Cheung Fun) the usual beef, shrimp or pork, but the Bitter Melon w/ Chicken and the Vegetable Rice Rolls are very nice if you want to try something different.\nThey also have Spicy (Curry ) Fried Won Tons are a nice twist to the Fried Won Ton enthusiast.  The Black Sesame pudding, paste or soup or whatever they call it offers a nice light and healthy dessert!", "author": "Doug L."}

Saw a sign for \"Dim Sum Specialists\" and couldn't resist. I've heard of dim sum chefs, but specialists? I must investigate. Upon walking in I thought they'd oversold themselves - the place is quite drab and the food presentation designed by a firm believer in pragmatism. But upon viewing and later tasting the food I had been way too quick to judge. 3 shrimp and cilantro balls for under 2 bucks?!? SIGN ME UP. The skin was surprisingly well made and there was a good amount of shrimp. My only complaint is that they were cold.  I also tried their coconut buns (they come in threes, shaped lik hot-dog rolls. Very handsome portion). These were warm and SO SOFT and delicious with the perfect amount of coconut filling. Delicious, filling snack for under 5 bucks. Twas my first and very satisfactory take-out dim sum experience. Specialists indeed. Will stop by next time I'm in the set for some of that deep fried curry puff action.", "author": "Polly F."}
