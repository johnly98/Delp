Did I change, did it, or were these two never the same? Maybe all of the above.\n\nWhile the staff was friendly, service quick, and ingredients fresh, the burrito was so terribly bland. It was as if it were designed for someone allergic to flavor, which is especially surprising given the Thai burrito (which was my fav at the East Bay joint) was described as having \"spicy\" sauce. I kept thinking, maybe all the flavor fell to the bottom, I'll get there. Nope. \n\nGiven there was nothing actually wrong with the ingredients, I'd give a different menu item a try, but I'd make sure to ask for whatever can actually impart flavor.

The guacamole was subtle, a little bland and felt like it was missing something salty and the prawn was spicy and salty and needed something mellow to balance out the flavours. I eventually got a fork and opened up the burrito so I can experience all the contents at once versus in separate layers.

Add your own salsa and your own flavor.  I found the salsas to be simply wonderful, just tantalizing with fresh herbs, spices and bursting with flavor.  With 5 to choose from (and mixing multiple scoops into each cup) the combinations really require more time/visits to choose a favorite.\nThe extreme hot has just enough habanero to really be a noteworthy favorite.  I doubt that I will ever have too much of that.  Should really try the others more, I always try a different cup of one other plus the habanero sauce, but nothing else compares to the addictive habanero flavor.    \n\nThe salads have always been excellent.  \n\nThings that seem pretty consistently mis-represented in other reviews:\n\n1.  Price.  $10 for a burrito is NOT expensive.  I saw a bunch of people saying that was too much???  REALLY?  Compared to what?  By Yelp's price scoring that falls into the moderate price scale which is the determining factor in my frequent returns here.  Cannot get better food for less.  \n\n2.  Authentic.  People complain that the food is not authentic.  This is NOT authentic at all.  It is gourmet.  It is better than authentic.  It is more diverse (with more options), more flavorful AND more healthy than authentic.  Remember: traditional Mexican food is based what the average Mexican living in Mexico can afford and has available.  I like to think of this place as what the wealthy might choose or have available as options.\nIt is unique and for that alone: I added a star because I have not experienced anything quite like it anywhere else.\nIn all of my extensive travel: I have never experienced anything like this anywhere else and that is a shame because Gourmet is definitely a step in the right direction.  \nI LOVE traditional Mexican food.  But what is wrong with being better than authentic or traditional?  There is always room for improvement and Gourmet has definitely created something special.\n\n3.  Ingredient quality is excellent.  The salsa aroma hits you from a few feet away, the veggies are crisp and fresh, the chicken, salmon and beef are well prepared.\n\n4. Healthier fare.  This is healthier cooking than the authentic lard laden fare of the average authentic Mexican restaurant.  They have taken the best of both and really made a one of a kind fusion.  \n\nThis is a unique one of a kind flavor and mix.  Why would anyone want to make this authentic when there are countless hundreds of authentic places around in the first place?  The selections here are what authentic SHOULD be, not what it is.  Don't hate the innovator.  Unique is not for everyone, but this is healthy AND unique and that is a brilliant combination for my dollar.  \nThe closest thing that I could say is think of a Mediterranean Mexican fusion.  Or as I said before: upscale Mexican with the resources to import anything from anywhere in the globe.  Salmon is definitely not authentic Mexican, but who does not love salmon????  Want authentic?  Enjoy your snapper/rockfish and tilapia.  Me?  I like variety, I like unique.  I love authentic, but I also enjoy something fresh and new.  People who demand only authentic cannot indulge in any different flavor and for that alone I would ignore their opinion.  \n\nThat said: 4 stars says that I am a fan and that is true.  \nIf we were to take points by score I would deduct for the ceiling tiles over the kitchen needing replacement and the t-bar needing painting or replacement.  But aside from that my review pretty much stands at 4 stars.  If this place were near my home: it would be a regular stop.  \n Healthy, tasty food at a reasonable price is always going to win my loyalty.  I wish that we had one of these in Los Angeles.", "author": "Veronica S."}

However, i don't eat burrito in this place. I always order the salad with chicken, steak, tofu and shrimp. The price is reasonable and they give you plenty of salad. The salad is fresh, made to order and the thing that i like that they cook the meat when you order it so it is actually hot warm not cold meat. They are pretty generous in giving the meat so you feel full and satisfied unlike some other salad places that are so stingy with meat.", "author": "sofie W."}

I go there often and have yet to eat a burrito that was not well prepared and delicious.  They have a creative way of taking a traditional Mexican dish and putting a California Twist on it that is new and refreshing.  The service?  Not bad, considering I go at lunch time and usually find a line going out the door.  The staff, who probably make little more than minimum wage and never seem to get a break, have never been rude to me.  I guess it's because I haven't been rude to them, first.  And I always say, \"Thank you\".  \nFor those who might think this post is from someone with connections to the place:  Forget it.  I don't know the owners.  I don't know anybody who works there.  I don't own any stock in the company.  I simply work in the neighborhood and think it's a great deal for lunch.", "author": "Raymond W."}

I always order the regular burrito and one time i actually ordered their special: chicken something. the rice AND black beans tasted kinda dry and well, tasteless. their gauc is usually good but for some reason, that one time, it was super salty and didnt taste fresh. oh yeah, i tried the quesadilla once and it was toooo cheesey. stick with their \"gourmet\" burrito.", "author": "Bren L."}
