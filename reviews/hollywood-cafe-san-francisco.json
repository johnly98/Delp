Fresh ingredients and clean food, this was by far a top pick. \n\nFOOD : I ordered the healthy plate ; 3 egg whites, spinach, tomato, and asparagus with an English muffin as a side and a fruit cup. I looooved this plate. So clean and so light, it made me leave feeling satisfied and happy. The fruit was fresh and a great array of different fruit - banana, grapes, watermelon, grapefruit, raspberries, blackberries, apple, orange, strawberries... for REAL a great variety. This was all around phenomenal. I could tell it wasn't pre made or something fishy. I WILL be going back!! Yuumm. My mom loved her 3 egg omelette too, we were extremely happy. \n\nSERVICE : We has such sweet service. They were prompt and willing to take complicated orders. They sat us quickly and we had such a pleasant time. \n\nATMOSPHERE : This was a pretty small restaurant, they had indoor and outdoor seating. The kitchen was visible to the customers, but there was a chill and warm vibe to it. There's a lot of people stuffed in and it's a little hectic at times but it's a great little place to stop in and have a lax morning.", "author": "Linden D."}

Pretty cool old time photos of some of the most famous actors. Its a neat little place but not crazy fancy or anything. \n\nThe menu is what you would expect from an approachable breakfast place. Their thing is that they have several dishes named after the actors themselves. I got the Marilynn Monroe. It was french toast with fresh fruit. The french toast was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The fruit was surprisingly fresh, all in all very well done. The coffee left you wanting more but you can't have it all I guess. \n\nGood experience but definitely not the best breakfast in town.", "author": "Adam H."}

Such a good choice! The portion was outstanding and I really enjoyed my omelette. The crab meat, though not super fresh, was fresh enough for me as to not having that annoying strong seafood taste which usually stemmed up when the seafood was set long. The avocado goes well with it, and the whole thing was lightly salted. The overall taste was very balanced and the ingredients great.\nMy friend ordered eggs and bacon sandwich and he enjoyed it. The only complaints was that they gave too much fruits haha!\nThe side toast was ok, goes well with the omelette.\nService was good and fast. The staff was friendly.

I came for an early sunday breakfast after working a night shift double. Its by alot of hotels in a tourist part of town so it was packed but I was able to get a table and staff were hustling so service was still quick.\n\nI ordered the dungeness crab and spinach eggs benedict and upgraded the hash browns to their house special hollywood hashbrowns with bacon, onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, and cheddar cheese on top. The benedict was dank and the crab and hollandaise made for a rich and succulent combo. They include a bit of fruit and a big rack of hash browns. \n\nThe hashbrowns were really tasty and filling but while the toppings were a flavor upgrade idk that its worth 3 more bucks for a sprinkle of stuff on top on an already 20 buck breakfast. If you dont really care about value and just want the best as I did that morning go for it tho.\n\nAll in all a really delicious meal that satisfied my craving and staff that were really hard working and efficient considering how packed the place was. In diner fashion they have a cool atmosphere and alot of old school photos of hollywood celebs etc if your into that too.", "author": "Sean G."}

Portions are large and the dishes were good and satisfying, but there's nothing special about this place.  If you're in the area and looking for brunch, Surinan around the corner has a much more interesting and flavorful menu.\n\nI ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict and upgraded the hash browns to the Hollywood Cafe hash browns.  The Benedict was fine though a bit milder than I prefer, and the crab a bit fishy.  Be careful eating it since we found a couple small pieces of shell in our crab.  3.5/5\n\nThe Hollywood hash browns were not crispy, and were topped with saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers and bacon which made them more flavorful.  However I was a bit surprised that the upgrade cost was $3 when ordering a la carte was only $1.50 between the normal hash browns and the Hollywood style.  3.5/5\n\nMy husband ordered the egg sandwich which came with two English muffins with fluffy scrambled eggs and bacon inside.  Simple but solid, 4/5\n\nWe also ordered a fruit cup which had standard but good fruit like blueberries, blackberries, bananas, oranges, strawberries and grapes.  However at $10.99 I was expecting a larger bowl.  4/5\n\nFresh squeezed orange juice was good.  We arrived at 11am on a beautiful San Francisco Saturday and waited for about 25 minutes for a table of 2, which isn't that bad if you're used to the crazy brunch places in the more hipster areas.", "author": "Alice C."}

My prose not up to snuff???\nWell that gives me a chance to add to the magic. \nI've been here several times, all with Sir Winston. Which means sat at one of the outdoor seats lining the front of the place. \nAlways dog friendly, with actual doggie bowls for cool aqua. \nThe portions are ginormous. That includes the variety of fresh fruit served in bowls over flowing with assorted berries, citrus, banana, kiwi, pineapple. The omelettes alway cooked to your specifications. Sour dough toast and endless coffee. \n\nToday was a great day to be outside in SF. Warm sunny, and for whatever reason... not too touristy.\nEven took a couple of victory laps around the marina to familiar tourist traps, taking advantage of the lack of pink n yellow neon clad out of towners, throngs of kids in tow.\n\nFrankly by the time I dropped Bae off to get in the usually wrapped around the block line, parked the whip up the street a half a click, we were seated. Ice cold water for us and Winston soon arrived without asking. A tag team of friendly, yellow tee shirt clad staff happily waited on us, leaving us not wanting for anything. \n\nGet in, get stuffed, and get out.  Another throng off hungry locals and tourists alike, eager to repeat the process await. Although today not so much. Crazy because this was a chamber of commerce day. \n\nFrankly we were heading to Union street for a hipster upscale brunch. \n\nAs we drove by to spy the line... well the lack of it was all we needed. \n\nIt's seven pm and we are still not hungry!

They each took him to the counter to \"help\" bring people their food. Some carried him, some held his hand and walked with him, but all of the waitstaff engaged him. When the meal was over, he felt like the hero of the place and said \"bye\"to each of them... they all were genuinely friendly in saying \"bye\" back, giving hugs/high fives, etc.\n\nAgain- food alone was five stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-05", "description": "OK so this will come up as one of the top places to get breakfast in SF. And what I can tell you is that there is for sure a reason why! I actually like it so much that it's the only breakfast place I've made it a point to go to when I'm there. \n\nWhat I can tell you is to get here EARLY! There is not much seating at all (maybe ten tables inside and 4-5 outside). If you have a big party, get there right when they open. I'd imagine they would have a difficult time accommodating parties of 6 or more. When I came here the first time, I think we got here within 10 mins of opening and were seated right away. We quickly saw a line start forming and felt pleased with our decision to get there early. The second time I went, I was not as smart. It was July and I was in SF for the Marathon. It was a few days after the marathon and I wanted a nice big breakfast to splurge! I got here between 10-11 and saw the line outside. I was starving but it was also freezing outside (50s and windy). I stood outside for about 20 mins questioning my decision but it was too late to turn back now. There were probably 5-6 parties ahead of me and the line was moving SLOW. Luckily, being a solo traveler helped. After about 25 mins, an associate re-confirmed with me that I was a party of 1, then quickly went inside and came right back out and motioned me to come in. I was able to jump the whole line. SCORE! But regardless, just try to get here early. It's worth the wait, but like I said, due to little seating, the line moves slow.\n\nI have gotten the Marilyn Monroe both times I've come here. It's three slices of French toast and a fruit cup. Now let me tell you that this fruit cup will be the BEST and most exotic fruit cup you will ever have in a restaurant. Most restaurants I go to will usually over-supply on the melons, have a few grapes in there, maybe strawberries and bananas if you're lucky. But this place LOADS you with EVERY kind of fruit imaginable. It's insane! Watermelon, apple, banana, oranges, grapefruit, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, grapes, kiwi (KIWI!!!!!). I mean it's endless. I can never seem to finish the darn thing, but I really appreciate how they don't skimp at all. It's great!\n\nI also got the hash brown this most recent time which I scarfed down. A great and hearty breakfast before sightseeing in SF!\n\nWhat I will say that I didn't love about this place is that bc the line is so long, they kind of want you out of there ASAP. So they will give you your check before you're done eating. I had paid and was finishing my tea and just browsing on my phone and they came and started clearing stuff off my table (mind you I was still drinking the tea I paid for) and I felt like they were kinda telling me to get outta there. Also, the bathroom situation is kinda sketchy. They have to give you code and you go into this industrial building. Just overall sketchy. If you are a female alone back there, be cautious. I'd just prefer if they had a bathroom on site in the restaurant. Would make me feel much more safe!\n\nEither way, make sure you come here on your visit to SF! Promise you'll never get a fruit cup like this anywhere else!", "author": "Chelsea E."}

The name was cool and the menu looked really nice. There was no queue as they had only just opened a couple of minutes earlier, however if you arrive any later than 7:30 am you can expect to find a queue of at least 30 minutes to an hour. We got a table outside and within minutes ordered our food and coffee. The food was extremely well prepared and fresh, the service was quick and very polite. You could tell that they were no strangers to efficiency. The presentation of the food is really what makes this cafe different from the ordinary breakfast place. If you're looking for a place to take that perfect instagram picture then this is definitely the place to do it! \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice too although the restaurant doesn't have any restrooms which is a major flaw in my eyes.

Coming from AZ, we get great chorizo and this was very much on par.  The specialty plates are definitely worth a try as well.  The Vivian Leigh is a personal favorite, the croissant is soft and fresh, the eggs cooked perfectly.  \n\nBut the best thing on the menu - must order - is the fruit bowl!  HUGE bowl of fruit, definitely get something that comes with it.  The specialties come with it.  You can order a separate one and it's $9.95 - which seems like a lot for a fruit bowl, but if you really just want fruit, it's plenty for breakfast.

There was a short line when we arrived, and we quickly moved up and got seated since there was only one party ahead of us. We sat on one of the outside tables, and it felt pretty nice especially on a sunny day. I knew I wanted the pancakes coming in here, I just didn't know what type of pancakes. I eventually settled on the blueberry pancakes, although the combo would have been nice too. I just wasn't feeling like getting any meat at that time. Anyways, we ordered and our food came within ten minutes, which was pretty nice. \n\nThe blueberry pancakes were great, and they were very nice fluffy. The staff was very generous with the fruits and it was nice of them to shower my pancakes with plenty of fresh assorted fruits. You could see there was a slice of grapefruit, two orange slices, strawberries, bananas, blackberries and a generous helping of blueberries on the side. Also, it was nice of them to give a very large dollop of whip cream on top. \n\nOverall, I thought the meal was fantastic, and the pancakes tasted pretty great. Generous portions all around and service was excellent for the price. Would definitely try to find another opportunity to come back.

Although there was a line of a quite few parties in front of us, we waited about 15 minutes. The line goes pretty fast. We glanced over the menu while waiting and I must say they have quite a few options. \n\nGot the French toast combo which has eggs, choice of meat, and 3 slices of French toast. I got the vanilla French toast which has banana pur\u00e9e and slices on with whipped cream and sliced almonds. Pretty good!! Love the banana touches on it. More sweet than the classic toast though because it has some cereal crust on top. \nEggs were nicely cooked although I got over easy when I asked for over medium. \n\nOverall great place though", "author": "Melissa L."}

I just found the photos of this place again from when I wasn't so into Yelp, and started drooling over the fruit again.)\n\nIf you're big on fruit and healthy foods at breakfast, I suggest checking out Hollywood Cafe if you're in this part of town. It's a tiny little place close to the wharf, but far enough from the hustle and bustle that you'll be fine. They'll start you off with coffee, which gets to the table really quickly, and a plate of sourdough, SF's finest. Both are pretty good, although the tastes conftrast each other if you take a bite of one after a sip of the other.\n\nWhen I came, I got the Vivian Leigh (croissant sandwich), and while the cheese, eggs, and bacon weren't anything special, the variety of fruit in January really was. It's not berry season this time of year, so it was a pleasantly sweet surprise. I think I struggled to finish the fruit more than I did the sandwich. If it's any rule I live by, though, it's that if you can't finish everything on your plate, at least go for the expensive stuff. The place in general is average-priced by SF standards, and I'd argue it's a really good place to still get breakfast among the brunch craze.\n\nIf you get a seat inside, the service is really fast and you get to see the servers maneuvering their way around the tiny place, which is kind of fun to watch in and of itself. :) You go, servers!", "author": "Gwen W."}

The portions are large and everything comforting about breakfast. I ordered the B.A.T (which stands for bacon, avocado, tomato) three egg scramble with hollywood hash browns. Three eggs with all those veggies and cheddar cheese came to be a huge omelet. Next to it was a huge slab of hash browns and of course I had fat eyes and had to get them hollywood style so more bacon, mushrooms, cheese, green onion, and the kitchen sink. It would have been a bit more unique and tasty if they mixed in the hollywood part with the potatoes and then fried it but I was able to just mix it up myself. The orange juice was also freshly squeezed which is a huge thumbs up. The table next to us got the mimosa sampler which looked heavenly but I was still suffering from hell/a major hangover.

Chose to go to Hollywood Cafe on Sunday at 10:45 am. By the time I got there, there was a line about 10 people deep. The restaurant itself is small, but the kitchen and wait staff do a tremendous job of getting people seated and fed in a timely manner. Excellent service as demonstrated by the 5 times a waiter asked my friend if he wanted more coffee every time they saw his cup was running low. \n\nI ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict. The English muffin was crisp and there was a good amount of crab meat and spinach. I wasn't expecting the slice of lemon which was refreshing at first but then began to take over the taste of everything else because of the level of sourness. I understand it was there most likely to help reduce the \"fishy\" taste of crab, but it ended up taking away from everything except the egg. The egg was beautifully presented but, once cut into, revealed that it was slightly overcooked as the egg wasn't runny in the way I'd expect a Benedict to be. That being said, it's the best crab benedict that I've had in SF so far. \n\nThe hash browns that came with my meal were excellent. They were crisp, crunchy, thin, and in a big portion. I'm glad it wasn't just undercooked carbs on my plate. \n\nThe orange juice was freshly squeezed with plenty of pulp. This is how I like my orange juice so I thoroughly enjoyed having it with my food. \n\nI would definitely come back to try other items on the menu despite all the places I'd still like to try in SF.

Came here for breakfast with my boyfriend our first day in San Francisco. The restaurant seemed to be family owned. When we arrived there was a short line about 5 people ahead of us. We were able to be seated quickly, within the first 10 minutes of waiting. Immediately, was greeting and brought drinks. I ordered the meat lovers omelet with a side of fruit and my boyfriend ordered the classic eggs Benedict with a side of hash browns. Everything was amazing and the fruit tasted so fresh. However, the omelet was filled with meat. I understand, it is called the meat lovers omelet, but every single bite was just filled with bacon, ham and sausage. It was a little too much for me.

I could not be a bigger proponent of this spot for breakfast.  This past time was my fourth visit but I have yet to write a review until now.  This time I went for the \"Vivien Leigh\" breakfast platter which is pretty simple but will always be my favorite savory breakfast dish.  This included an egg scramble with bacon and cheese mixed in on a delicious and perfectly seared croissant, delicious sour dough bread and butter, and the fruit bowl to end all fruit bowls.  In fact, most of the reviews here will mention their famous fruit bowls because they are huge, as fresh as can be (much of it sourced right here in California), and features the best and priciest fruits such as grapes, strawberries, kiwi, and rasberries.  They do not fill you bowl with honey dew like most places do.  If this is your first visit you MUST get the side of fruit.  I've had some of the sweet breakfast options as well, such as the french toast, and it is as amazing as it looks.  I also love their breakfast potatoes, which often get mistaken for crepes.  Regardless, they are delicious and love the way they are plated.  Their coffee and espresso drinks are also pretty decent given this is not explicitly a coffee shop by any means... At Hollywood Cafe, the Food is the star!  I find it crazy that this place is in the Fisherman's Wharf which is the known tourist district, but go figure!  This place is not cheap either, but you get what you pay for, and consider the fact you are in downtown San Francisco as well.\n\nPrice:  6/10 (More like $$$ Yelp, breakfast plates are mostly $15-$20)\n\nValue: 8/10 (it is just breakfast, but its San Fran and its a great experience)\n\nService:  8/10  Good, but this place is usually very crowded.\n\nFood:  10/10  For breakfast, it doesn't get any better.\n\nWill return!", "author": "Blake B."}

This restaurant serves fantastic and plenty of food, but it's definitely not great for parities larger than 4.  Thankfully, we didn't wait long for a table and were seated in the back of the restaurant at the only table large enough to seat us.  As mentioned in previous reviews, there's no real good place to wait so you awkwardly hover over those eating on the sidewalk.  Each table has strawberry and orange jam available for use.  I ordered the crab Benedict and I definitely do not regret it!  It was fantastic and had plenty lump crab that you could see and taste.  I ordered the Hollywood hash browns and honestly wish I hadn't.  I was disappointed in this side dish, as the cheese tasted like cheese wiz.  Not yummy.  I also had the misugaru latte for the first time and had no idea what to expect.  Earthy and delicious!   I shared an order of the dolce French toast with my family and was not impressed.  \n\nA family member told me they thought the cappuccino was good but not very bold in flavor.  Another family member loved her salmon Benedict, another really enjoyed the apple chicken sausage, another thought the meat lover omelette was bomb, another was very happy with her heuvos rancheros was great and another was not satisfied with her tropical iced tea.  She said it just tasted like regular unsweetened tea. \n\nThe wait staff was great and very friendly!   They replaced a cappuccino that we split on accident for free.  They also split our checks and allowed for multiple cards to be used.  \n\nI would stick with the omelette and benedicts.

Definitely would not recommend the chilaquiles. They scramble the eggs with chorizo and tomatillo sauce then give you a side of baseball field tortilla chips. The Omelette was good, lots of ham and cheese. The French Toast was amazing. Portion is 3 halves of toast which we found strange, but delicious nonetheless.\n\nOur waitress was probably below average, perhaps because she was busy.

Winning!!\n\nOne thing is they charge an extra misc tax which I think is for sitting outside (like in Venice???). I really don't know but it was $3.00 for just me. Hmmmm", "author": "Jeannette L."}

No, they're not doing some super fancy breakfast brunch pub farm to table type thing, but they are consistently pumping out simple and delicious fare with super fresh ingredients. Their service is fast and even with what appears to be a long line, the wait is never too long. Be warned, I've only been here for breakfast, but I've been here many times. \n\nI've never had anything I didn't like here... their French toast, the crab or meatlover's omelet, the veggie sandwich (add bacon), the fresh fruit, the sourdough toast... it's all stellar. What really got my attention off the bat is that they use real fruit in their fruit bowls and on their French toast. It's not the typical orange wedge, cantaloupe, and grapes. \nYou get raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, banana, citrus, honeydew, kiwi... Whatever is in season they serve it, and they are generous with it.\n\nThe only knock on this lovely place is that they once gave out the sourdough toast like water, you just got some... and asking for extra didn't cost you. \nNow you only get it with certain plates and ordering any more will show up on the bill. Kind of a drag... It's not like I come here and just order a side of scrambled eggs and fill up on toast, so having this taken away is just a bummer. The other thing is that as the morning goes on, the portions get smaller... from what I've experienced. The first few times I came here, it was usually early... just about when they opened their doors, and man, the portions were GENEROUS. The last few times, I've come later in the morning and there has been a notable disparity. I'm hoping it's just the time of the morning and not altogether smaller no matter the time. I'll find out next time I'm in the city early in the morning. \n\nI don't recommend the Wharf as I've spent so much time in SF, but if you must visit there then HW Cafe is perfect to have an early great breakfast and walk over to the Wharf/Pier 39 before it gets too crowded with tourists.", "author": "Raul M."}

With that being said I had to google search 'best breakfast/brunch near me' while I was visiting The Bay Area. Needless to say quite a few highly rated joints popped up but the Wifey and I both agreed that this was most definitely the place (sometimes you just gotta feel it) They are a very popular establishment and there was indeed a lengthy line but upon arrival they provide you with warm smiles and menu so when it's time to get your seat you'll be ready to eat. I don't know how they did it but we were seated pretty fast and orders taken within minutes upon getting our table.

No matter what time you go, there will be line of upwards to 10-15 people. But as far as the food goes, it's awesome! The portions are huge and the prices are incredibly reasonable. One of my favorites is the fruit they have here. You'll get an overflowing side of seasonal mixed fruit that tastes so fresh and sweet. Every time I go, I always try to order something new and so far, I haven't been let down!

If you're one to get easily cold like me, never fear, there's outdoor heating available so you'll be relatively comfortable sitting outside.\n\nThey have a wide variety of typical American breakfast items but from what we sampled (the Marilyn Monroe and the Denver), they do an exceptional job. The Marilyn Monroe (french toast and fresh fruit) was delightful. The bread was light, chewy yet substantial at the same time. The dish came overloaded with fresh fruit. Everything was fresh and sweet. The Denver (omelette with sausage, peppers, onions, hash brown and sour dough bread) was just as delicious. The omelette was light and fluffy, and the hash browns were cooked to perfection.\n\nDespite how busy this place was, the server stopped by on numerous occasions to top off our coffee and check to see we were enjoying our dining experience.\n\nWe left the place with a content belly and a bill just over $30.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-28", "description": "Breakfast is, hands-down, my absolute favorite meal of the day, and this place reaffirms my undying love for it. Just happened to be in the area around 7 AM, so we decided to check out a spot we wouldn't normally get to visit. Thanks to Yelp yet again for bringing another amazing place to my attention. You do yo thang, Yelp!\n\nThe four of us arrived just around 7:30 and stood in the short but already-growing line. By the time we were seated, a massive line had formed behind us and only the first lucky 30 or so of us found ourselves at a table. We felt like winners! With buzzers going and confetti streaming from the sky and everything. \n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE:\n----------------------\nNothing too special about the environment other than that it's in North Beach. It has a spectacular view once you step outside. Parking in this area may be rather difficult. Inside is a typical cafe that isn't quite quaint but not modernized either. Clean but efficient.\n\nService is also clean and efficient. They're friendly enough but they're so busy they need to focus on the tasks at hand. My latte was forgotten a few times and it arrived when I had already eaten most of my meal. The server was apologetic and brought it out as soon as it was ready.\n\nFOOD:\n-------\nBut the food is the real showstopper here, of course.\n\nLet me comment first of all on the **Sweet Bacon**. Glazed with maple syrup, fresh orange juice, brown sugar, and Grand Marnier, this meaty goodness is so delectable. And the great thing is they it with many dishes. You can ask to clarify. I ordered a side of the sweet bacon without realizing it already came with most of our dishes! Oh well, no harm in extra bacon. Who's gonna say no to bonus meat!?\n\nNext up I have to tell you about those **Hollywood Hash Browns** topped with bacon, mushroom, onion, bell pepper, basil flakes, and melted cheddar cheese. If you're not sure whether to upgrade your hash browns, the answer is yes. \n\nOkay now, on the entrees at last!\n\n1) People rave about the **Dungeness Eggs Benedict** and with great reason. This dish is excellent! The poached egg is done just perfectly that it runs all over the crab meat and English muffin just the way it should. I really couldn't ask for more. \n\n2) The **Vivian Leigh** breakfast special is very delicious: eggs scrambled with bacon and mild cheddar cheese on a grilled croissant with fresh fruit. Don't be fooled by the \"with fresh fruit\"--your plate will be overflowing with a virtual cornucopia of divine fruit. We were impressed to count at least 15 types of fruit! \n\n3) If you love your meat, go for the **Meat Lover Scramble** which is stuffed bacon, sausage, ham, and mild cheddar. Super hearty and you won't be hungry for quite some time.\n\nThe **Latte** was decent and a great complement to my meal. I definitely needed a kick to wake up after engaging in massive food coma.\n\nTIP: Get here well before 8 AM. This place be popular.\n\nDATE TIP: Definitely a fun breakfast date spot, if you happen to be up early on the weekend (or haven't gone to sleep yet!).", "author": "Denise L."}

Great start to the morning! After being seated, we were promptly asked what we would like to drink and I stuck with water while my girlfriend ordered a vanilla latte. Water: Yum. Vanilla Latte: Delicious, but not out of this world spectacular. Pretty much what you would expect ordering a mocha from a place that doesn't specialize in coffee. Next, we ordered our food... And waited... And waited. Apparently, we were unfortunate enough to be caught in the middle of a surprise visit from a city inspector and they had to stop everything in the kitchen for 30 minutes. Okay, not their fault but I was STARVING and ready for my food. The meal:\n\nDish 1: Chilaquiles (chorizo, eggs, cheese, tortilla chips, tomatillo salsa, hash browns and sourdough toast on the side) \n\nDish 2: BAT (Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, and cheese scramble with a fruit cup in place of hash browns (+3.99). \n\nDish 1: I thought the chorizo was very flavorful for American chorizo. Certainly of better quality than a lot of other breakfast restaurants. The tomatillo salsa, while I would have loved more, was a wonderful addition on top. I was also thankful for the chips because what is chorizo and eggs without chips? Hash browns were extremely large but pretty average. Kind of difficult to cut, yet thin. Not crazy about them. The sourdough bread is what I really could have done without. It was dry, crispy, and lacked any flavor whatsoever. I would have preferred an option for some fruit or even normal toast. The final comment I had about the dish was I found what I'm assuming is the skin of the chorizo in the mix of that and my eggs. While edible (yes I tried it) it was an unpleasant sight, and there was kind of a lot of it in there which I'm not sure if that's how it always is or what... But overall it was a delicious meal and well deserving of 4 stars. \n\nDish 2: BAT scramble. Really delicious scramble with a generous portion of big slices of bacon, avocado, and...tomato? They left out the tomato... Oh well it was still delicious. The one major downfall of this dish was how much cheese they added. It was definitely an excess amount of cheese that actually made the eggs slimy. If one wanted cheese eggs, these are perfect, butttt a little less cheese would have made this a near perfect dish. The side of fruit was SO delicious and every single piece of fruit was fresh and juicy. \n\nOverall, a solid 4 star restaurant with HUGE portions and delicious, fresh breakfast food.", "author": "Alex M."}

There was already a line forming outside for a table when we arrived.

The marilyn monroe was three wedges of french toast and also a huge side of fruit.  The denver omelette was good but could of had more cheese per my brother-in-law.\n\nWhat's popular about the place is the huge side of fruit with the breakfast specials.

My classic Benedict was pretty standard. They toasted the English muffin enough which is awesome. A lot of places don't and they end up soggy. They also didn't drown it in hollandaise like other places which is great too. The hash brown was perfect too. Nice and crispy, just how I like it!", "author": "Audrey L."}

Once you sit, you're expected to know what you want pretty quickly. I wasn't rushed to leave, but the bill was brought with the entree. Staff is charming and efficient. Food is great!

We walked in and were immediately seated. The coffee was good but the food could have been better. When placing our order we were told that they could not accommodate my gf's chilaquilas by making the eggs over easy rather than the scrambled eggs that they offer. We accepted it and when they brought out her food,they just gave her from what looked like an omelette that was turned in scrambled eggs. We informed the waitress of this and she stated that they were sorry and went back just to bring back chips and stated that they forgot to put chips inside. We advised that from what they are giving us is completely different from their description of chilaquilas on the menu. The waitress apologized and tried explaining to us what happened and at this point we needed to get going and gave the waitress the benefit of the doubt and just kept the plate. The food was so poorly made that my gf barely ate it and my hueuvos rancheros weren't so much hueuvos rancheros as they were nothing more than scrambled eggs with added items. Very disappointing!!! Definitely wouldn't recommend these items to anyone who have had quality hueuvos rancheros and chilaquilas. Maybe the next time we try this place, we will just stick to the simple items on the menu.", "author": "Kevin P."}

It was a Saturday morning not quite 8 o'clock and there was already a line out the door.  That's a good sign if you're looking for a good breakfast, not so good if you are starving!   Part of the reason for the line is because it is very small inside and there are a few tables outside.  We put our name on the list and since we said we would be willing to sit outside, we only had to wait a few minutes.\n\nWe soon learned why outside seating was so available.  If you sit facing out, you are just a few inches away from the people standing in line.  So, there you are eating while someone is looking longingly at your food.  Also, within just a few minutes, the sun had risen above the buildings in front and was right in my eyes.  If you are going to eat outside in the morning, I would suggest facing the restaurant, if you don't want people looking right at you and sun in your eyes.\n\nWhen it comes to the food however, there was nothing lacking.  My husband got the James Dean - which was two eggs, bacon, toast and fruit.  His eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  I got the Marilyn Monroe - which was french toast and fruit.  Oh my gosh.  The french toast was excellent, crispy on the outside, perfect on the inside.  The show stopper however was the fruit.  The fruit cup was literally overflowing onto my plate.  It was filled with raspberries, blackberries, watermelon, oranges, apples, bananas, kiwi, grapefruit, and cantaloup.   It goes on record as the most beautiful breakfast that I've ever eaten!!  It was the perfect way to start a glorious Saturday in San Francisco.", "author": "Pam G."}

The atmosphere was okay. The service was good.  The food options were decent and the prices were about what you find everywhere.  It's biggest flaw - it's not Eight AM which is just a little further up the street.  We had eaten at Eight AM the day before and the Hollywood Cafe just doesn't compare.  I ordered the French toast with caramelized banana and was quickly disappointed by the portion size for what you pay.  3 lukewarm halves for $14.  The flavor was nothing special.  My husband ordered the Florentine Benedict with hash browns which we also shared.  It really needed some seasoning and it, too, was lukewarm.  Overall disappointing.  If I had no other option, I would have rather gone to IHOP just up the street.  But I DID have another option.

And this leads to frustration and spats of inner anger for not having a full proof eating plan....\nAnd as you go to bed knowing all to well that in a few hours you need to get up at 4 am to stand in line to purchase tickets to Alcatraz because you though, that 2 weeks early was \"more than enough time to get tickets...\" and you didn't (side note, you wanna go see the Rock in high season... buy your tickets minimum a month in advance) but I digress... where was I?\nOh yeah, walking out the hotel to go stand in line, so there I was cursing the cold (I'm from miami so any temp under 72 is cold for us) with only a sweatshirt which let in the colder breeze, I cross the street and make a right to pier 33 and halfway down the block I spot the Hollywood cafe... still closed but I didn't give it much of a thought except for the hope of a future Latte and the cheesy decor showing black and white pics of past Hollywood stars... thus the name.\nWell, off I went into the dawn to try my hand at standing in line with about 50 other folks... by 6:30 the line had grown to over 150... and as my stomach rolled and complained the line grew even longer.\nAnd as if Murphy himself was watching, the announcement that everyone in the party had to be present or no ticket took whatever good mood I had, which wasn't much, and crushed it. \n10 seconds later I woke up my wife and 3 kids from what was sure to be dreams of cuddling by a warm fire as the aroma of chocolate chip cookies baked in a skillet pan.\n\"Honey wake everyone up, and rush over here I'm 30 people away from purchasing tickets...if you are not here we are not going... hurry!\" I hear a grumble on the other end and realize it's time to dad up! Cause the clan ain't gonna make it!\nThe clock ticks by and I get closer... no sign of the family. A few more minutes stretch on and it's game time... two windows open up. One has a 20 something goddess working the tickets with a million dollar smile. The other window is another 20 something young man that was clearly hung over.\nDon't get me wrong, I have mojo.... but my mojo ain't what what it used to be, so it was time to work my magic on hungover man... I started off with an apology then whipped out the pictures from the day before... it was clear that he just didn't want to hear anymore... so he smiled, told me not to worry and sold me 5 tickets! Sans family! \nHungover man was now 'The Man'!\nNot seconds later they ran out of tickets and my wife called to see status. I exaggerated my story and mentioned my hunger to which she responded that she was passing the Hollywood cafe and the line to get in was rather long.\n\"Stand in line! On my way\"\nAnd 25 min later we where having a breakfast feast!\nI'll start with letting you know... it's a popular place so be ready to stand in line. As mentioned... you are looking at 20 to 30 min wait for 5, less for parties 4 and under.\nService was quick... and to my delight my Latte came in a large cup and was delicious! So much so that I had a second cup when the meal arrived.\nCalifornia is a big state and so where the meals that overflowed with fruit over the thick French toast and the fluffy eggs... boy did we eat! So much that non felt hungry till that restaurant zombie hour 3-5 where doors close and there is no one in sight.\nSo as you can probably deduce... it was damn good, and for San Francisco... a great price... so much so that we ate there the next morning before taking off to Yosemite... road trip but that's another story!", "author": "Robert B."}

I have been here twice and have tried couple of items from the menu and none of them have disappointed me. The restaurant opens at 7AM and is open only till lunch time (1:45PM) and it is almost always crowded. My first visit was just 10mins after it opened (7:10AM) and it was crowded (I was able to find table only because I was alone). \n\nFood: \nThey typically start off with serving coffee which is again great and much essential to kick-start your day.  Food is central to any successful restaurant and Hollywood Cafe nails it hands down. In two visits, we have tried vegetarian omelette and BAT (sans bacon) (typically served with hash browns and toasted sourdough bread), Dolce french toast, veggie burger (served with french fries). The food is absolutely delicious and makes up for an amazing breakfast. Especially the deep fried food, which can easily turn very greasy, wasn't very oily and great in taste. \n\nAmbiance: \nThe ambiance lives up to the name as you see framed photos of hollywood stars on one of the walls. The place is, however, a little cramped. At any place, you would be sitting just centimeters away from your next table. However, the glass wall on the road side makes up for the required natural light which doesn't make the space suffocating. There is a sitting arrangement outside as well for those who want to have their meal outdoors. \n\nService:\nThe service is quite good for the amount of rush they receive. Our order didn't take much time to arrive. The guy who normally serves coffee checks in regularly if you need a refill and makes sure your mug is never empty. The staff is quite friendly and calm, although quite eager to serve you a check once you're almost done with your meal without checking if we would like to have something else.", "author": "Jay M."}

We arrived here not long after they opened to try and avoid the long lines and that strategy seemed to work, but it's apparent that a lot of other people do the same so at some point it just won't matter five minutes after we were seated the line was at least 20 people deep. The food is truly amazing as hundreds before me have stated there is no doubt about it. I have had similar breakfast experiences but those have been rare so I agree this is a pretty special place.\n\nThe food is well prepared and the presentation is about as creative as you could ever expect I mean how many ways can you arrange breakfast well it appears there are an infinite amount of ways, looking around at the staff its difficult to see where the talent lies especially if you look at the amount of food the kitchen puts out. \n\nHollywood Hashbrowns - simply amazing\nMeat Lovers Omelette - simply amazing\nFruit Bowl - simply amazing\nSourdough Toast - simply amazing\n\nIt's impossible for me to give this place anything less than 5 stars, if I found any weakness it's space, the tables are small and very close together, so hopefully you're fortunate enough to have good neighbors, we weren't so luck no fault of the restaurant but very distracting and it did negatively affect the over-all experience. We had two loud mouth arrogant business men practically sitting right of top of us, in between them throwing the F-bomb out ever other word they were spitting their food while smacking the entire time, I so regret not requesting another table in a way that would of been obvious to those jerks. So yes the close proximity of the tables in some sections are a problem but it won't deter people from swarming here.", "author": "Dave O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-02", "description": "I find it rather amusing that Jamie W. and I decided to eat here just before taking the three-hour San Francisco Movie Tour. It's like we intentionally built a Tinseltown theme around our entire Saturday morning when honestly I was just reading that the breakfasts here were pretty good. But then again, I really don't know any locals who admit to coming here since it's in the heart of the tourist zone on Northpoint at Fisherman's Wharf. Sure enough, as I was walking toward the place from Columbus, I saw the place was packed with tourists speaking with all sorts of accents from across the country and around the world. Apparently all the tourists at the big hotels had been informed to come here (photo: http://bit.ly/1NOa3R0).\n\nIt's not a big place and it appeared that half the seating was outside on the sidewalk judging by how many tables they squeezed onto the pavement. We got lucky because a large group of Germans, the Von Trapp family I'm presuming, was just being seated as we swooped in and got a table on the sidewalk. Moments later, a long queue formed, and the hostess was not about to tolerate any line cuts or unnecessary badgering. She treated them like the prisoners of war in \"Platoon\" and even dictated how people should stand and stop blocking the sidewalk. She handed out one menu per party as she made it clear she was taking it back the moment they get seated. Such authority, such unblinking conviction. I think I was in love.\n\nThe servers moved like whirling dervishes, and we felt like pawns in a game of speed chess. Of course, I went with the Hollywood theme, surprisingly bypassing both the Audrey Hepburn and the Gregory Peck (even though I love \"Roman Holiday\") in favor of the Vivien Leigh, which consisted of scrambled eggs with chopped bacon and melted cheddar, all of it stuffed into a jumbo croissant, and served with an overflowing fruit cup festooned with berries (photo: http://bit.ly/1RMj91e). The berries were fresh and sweet, and while I liked the girth and flavor of the croissant sandwich, it was lukewarm, a disappointment considering how robust it looked on the plate. Jamie decided to go with one of the omelets, the classic $12.50 Denver.\n\nIt was pretty hefty with ham, cheese, bell pepper and mild cheddar, and then he let all hell break loose with Hollywood's Hash Brown, which was a bargain at just $2 extra since it was a flat of hash browns topped with bacon, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers and cheddar (photo:  http://bit.ly/1NnBLG2). Again the massive size of the portion was compromised by the low temperature of the dish. We were wondering if the dishes were pre-made to some degree to increase the turnover of the tables. I wouldn't have minded this approach had they mastered the timing more. I think if the hostess took a bite, she would have thrown the plate at the chef and told him to start over again. There aren't enough drill sergeants like her in the restaurant business.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...huge truck-driver-size portions and great fruit cup but hamstrung by lukewarm temperatures\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...every inch of that space was used\nSERVICE - 3 stars...buzzsaws but none sharper than that hostess, she scares yet excites me\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Hooray for Hollywood?", "author": "Ed U."}

There are other options nearby, but we wanted to try Hollywood cafe.  When we got there, there was a small line forming outside, and my group of four was second in line, behind another group of four.  They also have outside seating with heat lamps, but on this particular morning, we wanted to be inside where it was warm.  After a short 10 minute wait, we were seated inside the caf\u00e9, which really isn't that large.  The menu is extensive and they seem to favor having multiple types of eggs benedict.  In fact, while we were waiting in line outside, a customer who was leaving said \"TRY THE EGGS BENEDICT, they are fabulous!\"  I was tempted, but I usually stick to a classic breakfast, so of course, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  My kids got pancakes & French toast, and my wife got her usual breakfast sandwich with eggs / bacon.  Service was top notch, as obviously, they want to get you in and out, but not in a rushing way.  Our drink order was taken quickly and brought quickly.  Not five minutes after we ordered our food, it was at the table.  Crazy fast, but also crazy good!  Nobody complained about their breakfast, as our kids wolfed down their meals.  My huevos rancheros were very good as well, only being rivaled by the ones I've in the divey restuarants of Mexico City.  Overall, it seems that this restaurant knows what its doing, is popular, keeps its customers happy, and serves up good food.  My other love is that they never let our coffee cups get empty.  Asking for more coffee is annoying and I never had to ask here.  The only weird thing was that there is no rest room inside the caf\u00e9.  It's too small for that.  However, if you need to use the restroom, they give you a code to use to go in next door, venture through the bowels of the building, and find a restroom that seems to be available to other establishments in the area.  Also, as we were leaving, the waiting line increased by a large factor, so if you want to come here, be the early bird.  HIGHLY recommend this place!!", "author": "Herb D."}

For a bit extra you can have a reasonable amount of fresh fruit with your breakfast to include blackberries, raspberries, kiwi, strawberry, grapes, pineapple, melon, and apple (pretty much a rainbow of fruit!) \n\nThis little restaurant is conveniently located near Fisherman's Wharf, and many of the hotels.

Their hash brown was made into a toasty rectangle(I've never had them like that before!). I loved everything! My hubby on the other hand wasn't too thrilled with his order.

My fianc\u00e9 enjoyed his eggs, chorizo link, and ridiculously large helping of hash browns. We were also given a side of sourdough toast which was better than what they serve at Boudin Bakery. \n\nThe servers were all friendly and it was nice to see them working as a team.

It was right up the street from our hotel but more importantly, HC has great reviews on Yelp!\n\nLocation - a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. Near a ton of tourist spots and hotels. There isn't a ton of seating so be warned HC might not be the best option for an extra large group. There is a good amount of outdoor seating but the tables are tiny so it was a struggle to fit all 6 of us and our plates at the table but we made it work. \n\nFood - solid breakfast spot. I had the BAT (bacon, avocado, and tomato and eggs) which is great after a night of drinking. I ordered it with egg whites (because, healthy). Word of advice: order the Hollywood Cafe Hashbrowns - basically a play on loaded mashed potatoes (hashbrowns topped with peppers, onion, cheese, and bacon). Every table gets a stack of toasted sourdough bread which is a big hit with a bunch of hungry 30 something's. The mango mimosa was a big hit as well.   \n\nService: boy they are fast here. The food is turned out so quickly. I think that's how they're able to have such a high volume in such a tiny space. One note, you will likely have 3 or 4 different servers. Basically everyone that walks by asks if you need anything. And when the food is ready, whatever server is around brings it out. I'm not mad at this, by the way.

I will definitely agree that the fruit is a fantastic substitute for hash browns. But I need a little more than a bowl of tasty fruit to justify $50 for 2 breakfasts. Contrary to claims, it isn't \"always\" busy. We stopped by at around 7:30 and there were only 4 tables occupied. The sausage patties were tasteless, the eggs were...eggs.

It was brief, but she looked like she was enjoying her meal so much (http://bit.ly/1vGt5nq).  I think if I never saw that little clip, I probably wouldn't have ever considered coming here, especially with it being at Fisherman's Wharf.  Though it's pretty impressive how despite being in a touristy part of town, Hollywood Cafe still cranks out some delicious food at low prices making it very easy to see why this place always has a long wait to get a table.  I would call this place the Brenda's of Fisherman's Wharf because of that.\n\nDungeness Crab Benedict with Hollywood Hash Browns --  http://bit.ly/1zwIK42\nIt was almost like I had two main entrees on one plate!\nWith the Hollywood Cafe being located near Fisherman's Wharf,  I wouldn't really expect anything less with the Dungeness Crab Benedict.  And it did not disappoint.  These were loaded with a huge amount of fresh Crab Meat!  It was amazing!  The hollandaise sauce was perfect making these one of the best Benedicts I've had in SF!  (Sorry, Zazie!!)  The Hollywood Hash Browns seem to steal the show on this plate topped with Bacon, mushroom, onion, bell pepper, basil flakes and melted cheddar cheese.  So much going on with this and it's really good! \n\nOne thing I've also noticed looking at other people plates is that if it comes with fruit, they definitely don't skimp on the fruit.  They generously serve you a mountain for freshly cut fruit!  How awesome is that?\n\nI definitely would love to come back to Hollywood Cafe again.  What I've had so far has been awesome and I'm looking forward to try their other breakfast and lunch items.  If you do decide to check it out, I highly recommend coming early, otherwise be prepared for at least an hour wait.  It's still worth it!", "author": "Rodney H."}

My fiancee had the Hawaiian omelette (pineapple, ham, and cheese), She said hers was amazing however it was very filling with everything inside!

What it means- it is a crispy crunchety hash brown that is literally the size of the entire plate! It is an extra $2, but that has got to be one of the greatest ways to spend 2 dollars I can think of.\n\nWhat I got: I ordered the \"Chilaquiles\" and upgraded to the \"Hollywood Hash.\" Dude, this breakfast was ridiculous! It had Bacon, Chorizo,  fresh avocado, peppers, onions, tomatillo salsa, this thing was off the charts good. I am venturing to say it was the GREATEST BREAKFAST OF ALL TIME. I know that is a big statement but Its true! You know an establishment is serious about breakfast when they cut the succulent crunchy bacon strips into bite size pieces. What a treat!\n\nWhat the Wifey got: Orangish French Toast. This french toast super flavorful with a delicious dulce appropriately named \"orangish\" flavored sauce on top. The french toast was thick, succulent, and browned to perfection. It was great.. However my wife a little envious of my Chilaquiles for what its worth.\n\nThe Verdict: Best breakfast I have ever had..

If you aren't a big breakfast person, it's a mean in itself. Not only were the portions great, but the variety plus the quality of the fruit just makes it even better. Don't even get me started on the french toast....I want to say it was the best french toast I've ever had because it was cooked so perfectly: that crisp on the outside that gives you that nice texture and bite and then nice and chewy in the middle. Even after the french toast cooled down and sat on my plate as I attended to my fussing son, it still held it's texture and was simply divine. \n\nService here was superb. Even with a line and the hustle and bustle of Saturday brunch, they were very accommodating to my son and I--they saw I had a stroller and gave me a table that had easy access and helped me move it in and out when the table next to us left and the next party got seated.

My boyfriend and I came super early for breakfast like right when they opened and the place was already filled with tourist and I can see why.

Oh...my...heavens.\n\nI almost wrote my thesis on the food here instead. Simply amazing. I ordered a fruit bowl that came with the freshest, juiciest fruit on this green earth. \nThis was accompanied by the crab omelet with a side of eggs. Everything was so tasty and fulfilling, the kind of meal that you'll definitely need a nap after consuming. \n\nThe next day was graduation (yippppppy), so my mom and I headed over a few hours before the ceremony to indulge in some pancakes and waffles. Once again...so damn delicioso. Talk about the perfect start to the day.\nI'm actually slightly disappointed with myself because I've lived in SF for 3 years and occasionally passed this joint on the way to classes, but never went in until my last days in this city. WTF! Hopefully you are reading my review and are heading there right now yourself.  \n\nAdditional notes:\n-Good for groups, but small dining area.\n-Indoor and outdoor seating.\n-Very crowded on weekends, like most brunch spots.\n-You'll receive the same food portion for takeout, as you do dining in.\n-Staff is friendly and efficient.\n-Does not accept reservations.", "author": "Court S."}

It's definitely the best breakfast spot in Fisherman's Wharf and it won't cost you a leg and an arm.\n\nMy girlfriend and I came here one early morning on a Friday for breakfast and there was only a brief 5 minute wait. I love the interior wall pictures, filled with ex and current Hollywood stars; who would have thought there be a LA theme restaurant in San Francisco? Upon seated, we were given a basket of free complimentary warm toasty bread with butter and waters. I ordered the Hawaiian omelette combo while my gf ordered the sunny side up egg combo.\n\nHawaiian omelette (4/5 stars): this omelette is huge. made with fresh eggs and satisfied my hungry appetite.  I love the pineapple and ham inside and the \"brown\" saucy pineapple on the outside. The mixed berries that come with it were a great touch! Sweet and delicious does it justice! Only flaw was the hash browns that accompanied my meal. It was not very crispy and too soft for my liking. \n\nsunny side up egg combo (N/A stars): I didn't have a single bite, but my gf loved it!\n\nHollywodo Cafe does a lot of stuff right. They have home made organic jams, Himalayan salt from Trader Joes and excellent service!

It's a small cute place. The service was friendly, quick, and attentive. I got a basic breakfast, nothing fancy (eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, toast). Everything was great, as expected. The last end of the hashbrown was a little thinner and therefore, crisper than I normally like. But it was still good. My husband got a Hawaiian omelette. It was huge! He loved it. We also shared an order of buttermilk pancakes. So delicious! So rich and fluffy. Every dish came with a fresh serving of fruit - strawberries, blackberries, bananas, orange slices, grapefruit slices, etc. The strawberries were so fresh. Again, so delicious!

The menu did have wide selections to eat and for good prices! 2 of my fiends got omelets but I got the Carmel Fried banana French toast with walnuts. I first ordered a glass of OJ since the workers said it was really popular and oh my god, I have never tired an OJ like that one, it fresh sweet and every right bit of tangy, totally worth $4. Once our food came the presentation was lovely and the fruit looked supper fresh. \n\nCostumer service was great, workers were kind and quick and when they brought our food, BIG PORTIONS for good prices. I still recall the first bite of the French toast and WOW BEST FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!!!

You don't put your name in, just get in line. The seating is very limited, so unless the weather is very bad just tell them you want whatever comes up first. There are heaters above the outside tables, and they are sheltered under awnings. You may wind up as we did, directly next to the front door eating in front of dozens of hungry people, but it will be worth it!!\n\nIn order to make things go as quickly as possible, they will hand you a menu when you are next up for a table. Read it & figure out what you want now, don't waste time lollygagging with your friends...as they will expect your order right after you're seated. This is how they keep that line moving!!\n\nAlthough it's very busy on Sunday mornings, the service was extremely efficient so we got our food quickly after ordering. \n\nMy picky eater husband said the \"Hollywood Style\" hash browns were \"Life Changing\".

We ordered them as an extra side, and were so glad we did. They are a must-try!\n\nI got the french toast combo which was the best french toast I've ever had in my life.  The bread was thick cut and it was perfectly grilled and the \"traditional\" flavor batter was superb. They have several flavors of french toast batter, including one with gran marnier which I'm betting would be spectacular! \n\nThe bacon was thick sliced but not tough, perfectly cooked; it was SO GOOD! The fresh fruit that accompanies each breakfast meal was supremely fresh and ripe. The banana especially was on point, creamy and perfectly ripened, and perfect with the french toast. \n\nThe scrambled eggs were very good, and you get a huge portion of them.

It wasn't a bad breakfast, but I have had much better - especially in the City.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and salmon benedict and it was okay.  The sauce was excellent, but my eggs were way {way} over poached.  I did specify, even though you shouldn't have to with an Eggs Benny, \"soft poached eggs\".  They were way overcooked.  The hashbrowns were just okay to me - a little chewey.\n\nHubby got the meat lover's omelette and liked it but he did say it was a little bland.  \n\nService was 100% 5* - excellent.  My coffee cup was full the entire time.  We were checked on frequently and had everything we needed.  If I could rate 3.5* I would.  Overall the food was okay, not awful but not \"amazing either.

Walking up it had a pretty large line however, it was only a 20 min wait. You won't find your standard hostess table here, you just hop to the end of the line and as you approach the front a little lady will great you. While you're in line they will hand out menus... so you should be prepared to order your drinks and breakfast at the same time. I'm sure this is how they have a fast flow of short ticket times.\n\nWe sat down and ordered a mimosas, great size for $7 and plenty in champagne in them. We saw the massive amounts of food as we waited in line so my girlfriend and I shared the Vivian Leigh, a chopped egg and bacon croissant sandwich. The chunks of bacon were a little too much for me... and I LOVE Bacon! The croissant was good, flakey and buttery. The special came with a largest bowl of fruit EVER! I mean it's a light meal in itself. We also added side of pancakes, which was no doubt large too. It tasted amazing. \n\nThe second time we went back we still got the side pancake but added the B.A.T( bacon, avocado, tomato) 3 scrambled eggs which came with crispy hash browns and sourdough toast.  Mmmm yummm, I  liked it better than the meal before. Great place to start off the day, I suggest if you can agree on the same thing...share!

When using reviews, I look for average and # of reviews and when you sport 4+ average with 1,000+ reviews, odds are good that the place will be great.  \n\nWe went Friday at around 11 am - there was a line that extended not quite to the corner on which the establishment is located.  Took around 20 minutes, struck up a conversation with another couple and ended up sharing a table with them.  The other couple had been there the day before and enjoyed it so much that they came back the next morning so I was feeling pretty good about enjoying my meal.\n\nThe menu is fairly expansive with some unique offerings, S had one of the salads and had them trick it out with some crab and I was feeling a little sweet so chose what was essentially a banana fosters french toast offering over many of the tempting omelette offerings.  \n\nBoth plates lived up to expectations - immediately you can tell that items were fresh and \"homemade\"  - the freshness was off the charts.  The french toast melted in my mouth and the contrast between the velvety bananas and the caramel with the texture of the french toast.  I don't usually go french toast but I am now a fan.  \n\nThe wait and the limited hours will deter people from giving this place a try and sometimes hype can be tricky because of all the reviews you expect this place to be a contender for your last meal on earth.  Temper your expectations - it is breakfast food.

If you are eating here outside you will have hungry people literally 4-5 feet away staring (longingly) at you eating your food. If you are waiting you are watching people 4-5 feet away eat food you want to be enjoying. This is not a good setup. They should invest in pagers or in some way not have those waiting line up right in front of those eating food.

My family of 5 had brunch at the Hollywood Cafe on Sunday and what a great experience.  I was very skeptical because of its proximity to Fisherman's Wharf and frankly didn't want to fall into a tourist trap.  \n\nThe place is not very big, but it had outside seating and they turn over tables very quickly.  My party of 5 probably waited 15 minutes total.  Not bad at all.  The service is very quick and attentive.  The food was plentiful and came out in no time. \n\nWhile I wasn't a fan of paying $8 for fruit, I was shocked at the amount of fruit that came out.  I'm used to paying $5 for a 2 pieces of cantaloupe and some grapes, the fruit plate at Hollywood Cafe was incredibly generous and overflowing with raspberries, blackberries, oranges, bananas, kiwi, grapes and cantaloupe  Overall, our meal was great.

The worst part was I realized it's right in one of the most touristy spots, Fishermen Wharf. I wasn't surprised when I got there on my bike and saw the line was practically all the way to the end of the block. Nothing new in this city, especially for Sunday brunch and on one of our Indian summer days.  Seems like everyone and their mother was out soaking in the sun. \nDespite the long line, we got a table in less than the usual hour wait. Granted it was outside seating where you're roasting in direct sunlight since Karl was nowhere in sight, it was bearable. \nOne of the reason in deciding to eat here was the unbelievable rating. Had to see for myself.  True, portions are great but sadly fruit portions that most boast about was lacking for us. An order of the original eggs Benedict came with TWO pieces of berries. My French toast combo was decent in terms of the actual French Toast, but I didn't like the extra charge for the maple syrup.  I got it with bacon and had my two eggs poached.  Unfortunately they couldn't get it just right. I felt like Goldilocks, one was more like hard boiled eggs while the second had the whites still runny.  Thick cut bacon is nothing like Sweet Maple just okay.\nService was also lacking.  They never checked in to refill our drinks, only to give the check. Three stars for decent & mediocre food and price. I'll stick to our usual brunch like Mission Beach Cafe, Dotties, Brenda's and so many more.", "author": "Naty D."}

It was really unbalanced as on more than half of the sandwich was just plain scrambled eggs & then all of bacon bits & cheese on the other side. Also, the eggs were a bit too over cooked so it was partially dry. The eggs could've used some more seasoning aside from the salt & pepper provided on the table. Some seasoning, a nice sauce or spread would've made a great difference. Aside from that, the side of fruit did not disappoint as I had to take most of mine togo.

He could t get over the combination of tastes in his mouth. He never likes to combine too many things but he took the plunge and went for it. He talked about it all day and how incredible it was. The service was great and quick. Hope to go back again in the morning of we are going to do breakfast. Must go must wait in line well worth it.", "author": "Nicole T."}

The restaurant is very welcoming with its amber and sunset orange wallpaper lined with black and white pictures of Hollywood actors and its small, cozy interior, especially in the early morning hours. \n\nThe service was very friendly, and the quality of the food was out of this world, from the fresh fruit to the eggs. It may seem unusual, but the eggs were my favorite part of my meal. No matter what style you get them in, they are always cooked perfectly. I got the sunny side up eggs, and it was the best sunny side up egg I have ever had. The yolk was perfectly runny and the egg white was cooked just right with a little crispiness. \n\nFor breakfast, I definitely recommend the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes are chocked full of blueberries, and they give you a lot of fruit. They were quite fluffy, and they give you the perfect portion.", "author": "Zoe C."}

My wife wanted breakfast and it was already 1PM due to wasting time wondering if we should wait it out at the other place. We ventured in to \"HOLLYWOOD CAFE\" already thinking this was going to be \"whatever\" because it wasn't our first choice.\n\nWell I was silenced because our first experience here proved us wrong. Being so close to the wharf--one of the major tourist spots in SF, we were expecting high prices, small portions, and average quality. We were surprised to see portions were plentiful, prices were very competitive, and the food was great! \n\nI wasn't feeling breakfast so I ordered the California Burger. MAN IT WAS SO GOOD! Especially at the price. It was $11-12. It was a good size burger. I'm a fat boy and I was satisfied at half of the burger, so finishing up the rest--I was done! It comes with fries, but not boring fries-- but CURLY FRIES!! SUPER DUPER POINTS! The ingredients were all fresh tasting and the bun tasted almost croissant like. It had a hefty amount of avocado and SPROUTS! It was just great!\n\nMy wife's breakfast was good too. Bacon was on point. French Toast was good.\n\nKey thing with this place is they do not SKIMP out on things. Each dish comes with loads of fruit!! Not the usual few pieces you would expect, but a good portion. I've seen other tables who ordered an actual side of fruit and it was shocking to see how much they give. \n\nThis placed surprised me, mainly because we were so bummed we couldn't go to our first choice restaurant and we had the mentality that anything else wouldn't compare. But we were wrong, and I'm glad we came. Although this is right by one of the biggest tourist area's in SF, the quality and value were excellent. You normally expect overpriced and average food in tourist areas, but this place was neither.\n\nHopefully things don't change. I would definitely go back.\n\nPS, the service was great btw. Only hiccup was our original waitress who took our order messed up. 2 in our party said we wanted a side of FRENCH TOAST, but they gave us FRENCH FRIES (which are curly fries btw-no complaints its awesome) . So we thought that was the side of fries for the 2 burgers that we ordered, but it wasn't. The manager said we can keep it which was nice. But our waitress gave us the cold shoulder the rest of our time there. To the point she didn't wait on us anymore. Mistakes happen, she didn't apologize, nor were we mad about it, but had to point that out. It was her mistake though, she probably wrote it wrong and got confused, as she asked us when we ordered the burgers if we wanted salad or french fries. It happens, no big deal.", "author": "Eugene N."}

The only request is that we asked for was extra-extra crispy hash-browns and they came out just regular and room temp to cold. The owner should know that breakfast is a menu item that needs to be served right away because it doesn't hold heat well. It also doesn't help when the door is left open when the temp is in the 40s...duh? In the Denver omelette the ingredients were not even sauteed. I hate not having my food come out as ordered because if you have to re-do anyone's items, then the other person waits as they watch the other eat, which doesn't make any sense.....I have higher expectations for a pricey breakfast place.

But then again, she had no communication skills. Who am I kidding?\n\nWe get our fresh sourdough bread which is absolutely delicious!  Next we get ONE benedict.  My dad's benedict.  We wait another 8-10 minutes for the rest of the food.  We told my dad to eat because we didn't want his food to get cold.  By the time ours came out, he was completely done, and only had fruit left.  This is so unprofessional and my biggest pet peeve.  \n\nMy french toast was good, and my parents loved their egg benedicts.  My brother thought his pancakes were just okay.

I knew we were in for a bit of a wait based on the amount of people loitering about outside.  The estimated wait was 30-45 minutes which turned out to be pretty spot on.  \n\nI ordered the smoked turkey eggs Benedict, the other two in my party ordered the lox bagle and two egg scramble with Hollywood hashbrowns.  My meal must have came with an entire avocado, definitely a plus.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, the fresh fruit is super delicious!  All of our meals were pretty large and I don't think any of us managed to finish the entire thing, although we were very tempted to push through.  All of us were thoroughly satisfied with our meals.  \n\nThis place is definitely a gem among most of the other restaurants that line the fishermans wharf area.

Thankfully Hollywood Cafe helped us out with the latter.\n\nFOOD:\nBlueberry pancakes: They usually come with whipped cream, blueberry compote, and fresh blueberries, but despite ordering them without whipped cream, I was served pancakes with the whole she-bang. Not a big deal as boyfriend ate the entire serving after I wiped them off. The pancakes were very tough - it's as if they over beat the batter. They were more cakey than fluffy, but I was more focused on the HUGE mound of fresh fruit on the side. Raspberries, strawberries, honeydew, cantaloupe.. you name it, it's on your plate. Amazing. \nTurkey eggs benedict: The boyfriend really enjoyed this, and it ALSO came with a heaping serving of fresh fruit. These portions are on the large side and sort of justify the hefty price point (we were also in super touristy marina). \n\nSERVICE: \nService varied from incredibly slow (when we asked for the check) to very attentive. \n\nOTHER:\n-No AC. I guess this wouldn't really matter because SF weather is moderately cool to begin with, but it was pretty warm in the restaurant.

Sometimes you get lucky and can park right out front! I usually get the yummy French toast with a fruit bowl. Awesome Hollywood hash browns too! And yummy mimosas. The wait line can get long but luckily I've never had a problem with a crazy long wait. I always upgrade the French toast and that's never a problem either. The fruit they use in their bowls is an excellent combo, usually grapes blackberries blueberries melon orange grapefruit pineapple kiwi strawberries raspberries banana but varies by what's in season. So good and the portion actually fills you up quite well!!! When I'm in the mood for a good diner and want to avoid any unknown factors I come here and know I won't be disappointed!

The best breakfast/brunch spot with inevitably the worst parking endeavor in the Bay Area.   \n\nI've had my eye on this place for a while, but finally got around to trying the place out on a wednesday mid-morning. I figured that they'd have a calmer crowd, and my intuition was correct. This place gets mad packed. Don't even try coming here on the weekends with the tourists and all. You'll spend an hour trying to find parking and you don't want that unless you want a head start on greying your hairs. \n\nAs far as the food goes, everything good that anyone ever says about this place is true. They don't skimp on SHT. Massive portions is what you'll get. If you're trying to eat healthier opt out for the fresh fruit as your side. They give you a mountain worth. A definite try would be the crab omelette. They put a generous portion of crab into it and I have a feeling that they try to let their customers know that they use fresh crab. How you may ask? I found like 3 pieces of crab shell in the omelette. Bruh, I get that you use fresh crab. You don't need to let us know by \"accidentally\" putting crab shells in there. \n\nThe service was straight. Nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that the waitress kept trying to refill our water cups after every sip and even though they were still already full. Bruh, we're in a drought. Calm down.  \n\nAll in all, If this place wasn't in the heart of the main tourist spot in the city, I'd definitely come back. Why you gotta be in sf man, why?", "author": "EJ B."}

It's so bright and fresh and airy, especially if you can score a table outside in the morning sunlight. We popped by around 11 am on a Saturday, so you can bet it was crowded. We could have had a table inside pretty quickly, but we really wanted to sit out in the fresh air, so we waited about thirty minutes. This was no big deal in the nice weather, but there is no where to sit and not a lot of space to stand, so you just kind of awkwardly hover around the people who are already seated. Oh well, at least you can look at their food and start thinking about what you want.\n\nEverything on the menu is very reasonably priced and sounds amazing. I decided to go with the Rancheros, which is just a ridiculous amount of food, so beware. Two eggs over medium with plenty of salsa, served on top of tortilla chips, avocado, and hashbrowns (Hollywood style, which means they have peppers, cheese, bacon, onion, and basil added. Geez). There's also plenty of random fruit on your plate, so you don't need to order a side of fruit unless you're a serious fruit fiend. Adam ordered the crazy-hearty-helping of French toast served with eggs, bacon, and fruit. All of the food is picture perfect and so delicious. But I truly think there's too much of it. I probably only ate half of my plate, and I'm a good eater. Come super hungry or share!\n\nDon't forget to order a mimosa.

The omelet, had tomatoes, spinach, black olives  and feta - it was OK for a restaurant omelet, a little overcooked and a tad under-seasoned but with the addition of pink salt, fresh ground pepper and some Cholula ( all available on the table) it was quite satisfying. The side of 5 slices of toasted, crusty, chewy, pre-buttered sourdough toast were perfect for soaking up the juicy tomatoey omelet stuffing too! \nBut you won't care about the omelet.  it's really all about the fruit. It is a giant pile of very fresh beautiful bing cherries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, kiwis, bananas, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, apple slices and grapes. It's crazy. It's enough fruit for like 4 or 5 people. I ate way too much in an attempt to get my money's worth but I still left about a third of it.

Can't complain too much considering it was freezing outside so we wanted to wait a little longer and sit inside. \n\nThe service: Very attentive! Food came out super fast and you can tell the waiters and waitresses work very hard. \n\nBasically, if you're looking for a good brunch place in the city, but don't want that whole fancy shmancy feel then this is an amazing place to try out!", "author": "Vanessa P."}

We had the crab omelette, crab benedict, denver omelette, original benedict, rancheros, and dolce french toast.

Hollywood cafe is where it's at!\n\nI went for lunch with my family close to closing time, and even then the place was jam packed - they kept taking as many customers as the could until the last minute too. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded delicious, which made it hard to decide on one thing but I settled for a chicken sandwich. It did take some time for the food to come out, but I can understand because they were so busy. Even though the food took some time, the service was great. The servers came to our table often to see if we needed coffee refills, and they brought us sourdough bread with butter as appetizers. (I believe the bread came with the salads, but since three people in our party ordered salads, we all decided to share the bread). \n\nWhen the food came out, man we were all starving, which made the food taste that much better. The bread of my sandwich was a little wet - not soggy though - because the juices from the sandwich were seeping out, but it wasn't wet enough to make the sandwich unpleasant. The chicken was grilled and seasoned to perfection. And the rest of the stuff in the sandwich was just icing on the cake. I chose to have my sandwich with a salad instead of fries, which had a very interesting, and again delicious, dressing - I think it was ginger based. \n\nIt makes me sad that we only discovered the place on the last day of our trip but I know for sure that Hollywood cafe will be on my to-visit list the next time I visit SF again.", "author": "Julian B."}

The service and food prep is also quite fast.\n\nCons: We were told that the orange juice wash fresh-squeezed (and they charge fresh squeeze prices) but it was definitely not fresh-squeezed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-22", "description": "I will start this review by saying that I did enjoy the atmosphere of Hollywood Cafe. I loved the cramped space and the outdoor tables. Here is a restaurant that took it's limitations and ran with them. I felt like I was back in Paris ordering from a crowded street side cafe. I loved the quippy names for the specials and I liked the photographs of the famous Hollywood stars scattered on the walls. \n\nWhat I didn't love were the pancakes. I feel like I'm constantly disappointed by pancakes. For such a simple meal they're never really down right. Or at least to my pancake standards (sorry for the food snobbery but I work at a restaurant with hands down the best pancakes around). For me, the perfect pancake is crispy on the outside while being cooked through and fluffy. It comes down to the batter, and if the chef has not over mixed the poor thing to death. The batter was alright but lacked the fluffy yet crispy texture that I believe makes up the perfect pancake. It was a bit more chewy than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong they were still great pancakes and worth ordering, but I wish they were lighter/fluffier. Also, they mean business at the Hollywood Cafe when you order the fruit cup. Piled high with seasonal fruits, it's the perfect compliment to their pancakes.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Although the guy had ordered the salmon benedict,  the girl did not order the crab benedict and so sent it back.  She recognized that it was not what she ordered before actually taking a bite.  So, they took it back to the kitchen and sat it on the counter until they got another salmon benedict ready.  Then they proceeded to deliver it to me.  Kinda gross really.  They should have discarded it and made me another one rather than giving me that one.  I complained about it so they did make me a fresh one.

There may have been a special dish I should have ordered or something, because my order was a typical breakfast and not much else. I ordered the meat lovers omelet, which came with a lot of hash browns and some toast. Both taste and presentation were basic. Something I could have had at home. Not a must have in my opinion. The other dishes my party had ordered were standard plates as well. Some of their dishes came with a whole lot of fruit.\n\nIf I get another chance to try this place.

I am used to ordering this at other restaurants and you get a little crab - not here at the Hollywood Cafe- they make sure you get more than your money's worth. The hash browns - are yummy, yum, yum. Mix them in with that amazing hollandaise sauce with a little crab for the perfect bite. I was very happy here at the Hollywood Cafe and felt right at home with the friendly staff. They made me feel very welcome and they didn't complain about how much coffee and water I drank they made sure they remained full with a smile.

The wait wasn't totally ridiculous and we only waited about 20 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. The menu was very extensive and everything looked delicious! All our food had beautiful vibrant colors and tasted quite unique. However, there were too many problems with their poor customer service that I can't get over:  \n1. My friend found a strand of hair in her omelette. When she told the waiter, he didn't even apologize, though the omelette was replaced. It was just not done in the most professional manner.\n2. After my friend asked for water for the second time (they have such tiny tables, I had to keep my wallet on then floor), he accidentally dropped water on our table and my friend... and completely ignored doing that.\n3. Switched the two cards we used for payment even though I specifically explained which one needed to be charged with more. \nThose were all forgivable mistakes, but it was a combination of all with the lack of a sincere apology from the waiters that really turned me off.\n\nOverall, though, the food and cutesy ambience was great.

As everyone else here has been raving, they give you a GIANT heap of fruit and it's all very fresh and tasty, I loved it! \n\nHowever, unless I'm going to a fruit juice stand, freshness of the fruit isn't the main criteria...and unfortunately, I thought the crab omelette was ok at best. It had plenty of crab in it, but the combination of the avocado, onions and cheese didn't really do it for me. The crab didn't have much taste, or maybe the flavour of the cheese was overpowering the crab, or maybe just the combination of the ingredients wasn't the best... The eggs weren't light and fluffy like I've had a few other brunch places in the city. I kept on having to put salt, pepper, and hot sauce on it in hopes of sprucing up the flavour, but I ended up not finishing the omelette. \n\nService was efficient and attentive and friendly enough. \n\nIf I want a huge bowl of fresh fruit for a quick breakfast I might drop by again since I live close by, but otherwise I don't think I'll be back.", "author": "Anna H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-13", "description": "Discovered Hollywood Cafe while roaming around the Fisherman's Wharf area on a trip to San Fran this past week. We were looking for a good brunch place and decided to try it out based on the great reviews. I am SO glad we did. As other Yelpers have commented - the food is great and portions are huge. I ordered the Marilyn Monroe which was 3 slices of french  toast with a fruit bowl. The fruit bowl included a TON of fresh fruit that was spilling over the bowl and all over my plate. The fruit and french toast were both really good. My husband ordered the HashBurrito, which he loved. It had a really fresh and unique flavor. We also got a side of the Hollywood Hashbrowns, which I highly recommend. The side order literally took up an entire plate!\n\nIn addition to the great food, the service was pretty outstanding as well. The seem to have a system where rather than have each server assigned to specific tables, everyone just helps out everywhere. So we had several different people come up at various times to take our order, ask how everything was and clear our plates, etc. This system seemed to work very well as we felt very well attended to and they seemed to get people in and out of there pretty quickly. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a great value on a delicious brunch in SF!", "author": "Stacey S."}

The eggs were fine, the bacon average, but the hash browns were about the size of a McDonald's hash brown, but thinner.  The hash browns were so small, that the \"Hollywood\" style toppings were extremely sparse, maybe 3 bacon bits, and 4 thinly slices peppers.  It also came with bread, which possibly could of have been toast at some point, it was devoid of warmth.  Going into restaurant I wanted to have a lighter breakfast, which I got, but I feel like I paid for a huge breakfast.  My son had the \"basic\" pancakes for $10, which he was not thrilled about.  We ate about 7:45 before the crowds arrived.  It was 40-45 degrees outside, people were eating on the sidewalk, and the doors leading in were wide open, so it was on the chilly side.

But I shall try.\n\nEn route to LA from Redding (way up in NorCal) by car, I wanted to stop in SF for brunch. My cousin agreed, and after discovering that our first choice (Mama's a few blocks away) had a horrendous line, I suggest Hollywood Cafe, based on its vicinity, its rating, and its lack of a line at that time. Despite the 4.5 stars, I had my doubts, mainly originating from the name of the restaurant: why would I go to a restaurant 400 miles away from the actual place it's named after, especially when I live so close to said place? I tried very hard to ignore it.\n\nBut then when the food came... I just can't handle this. My heart is starting to pump faster just re-imagining this terrible, terrible brunch. I ordered the shrimp and salmon benedict, and my cousin ordered the crab omelet. Here I go.\nThe benedict was disgusting. Everything was cold, from the smoked salmon to the poached eggs. The hollandaise sauce was way too much and way too heavy. The combination was just a terrible one. And the three shrimp were just thrown into a corner of the plate, as opposed to being put into the benedict in some way. When I put everything together in one bite, I tasted not a pleasant breakfast, but rather the result of a bad breakfast. Ugh. \nMeanwhile, the crab omelet, which I momentarily thought was much better as relief from the benedict, turned out to be quite a fluke, as well. Omelets are supposed to be eggs, with various ingredients mixed in. This was a sheet of egg--I suspect they aren't even natural ones--wrapping a few shreds of crab with a huge handful of green onion and a thick slice of cheese. So like a sandwich. A very cold, hard one that was nearly void of its promised primary ingredient (crab). After a few bites, this omelet also became repulsive.\nAt least the hashbrowns were good, I suppose. They were very thin and took up about 2/3 of the space on each of the plates. But really... it's hard to mess up hashbrowns. \n\nThe iced water tasted weird. My hot water came in a chipped mug (right at the point where I would have put my lips had I not noticed the chip). The bread (I don't know who serves bread baskets for brunch, but okay) was oily from them having just slathered butter onto each piece. The service was awkward--nobody really seemed to understand clearly or respond attentively to what we were saying. The restroom was soooo shady--or, rather, lacking, since the one they tell customers to use is in the vacant space next door, down two shady corridors and whatnot. \n\nJust disgusting. I wanted very much to have a filling meal before the long drive home, but my desire to just stop eating that disgusting food overpowered the natural need to eat. See if I'm ever trying a restaurant with \"Hollywood\" in the name again. Hmph.", "author": "Wendy C."}

I got the turkey eggs benedict and my husband got the cheesesteak.  My benedict was very good, lots of turkey and avocado and egg runny and perfectly cooked.  Lots of egg benedicts are good though but the kicker for me for the ginormous sheet of hash browns they were served on.  Super crispy and delicious.  My husband cheesesteak was delicious, one of the best I've tasted.  He got shoestring fries on the side which I usually don't like cause they lose the starchy texture in the middle but these were delicious.  Our friends got a croissant sandwich and something else I can't seem to remember but the croissant sandwich looked great and came with a giant serving of fresh fruit.  In terms of portions, very decent, we each ate half our food.  \n\nUpdate.

It's a tourist trap and everything is so-so and other neighborhoods could have hidden gems... well this place is the Wharf's hidden gem (to the locals at least). \n\nThis place has yet to disappoint me. I've been here at least 8 times. Actually, my cousin visiting me once asked me to meet up with him here because he was staying at a nearby hotel. When he initially asked me, I really wanted to counter him and offer other places (Pork Store, Boogaloos, Eats, anything really.. I was plagued by the Wharf...) but I resisted and gave in... glad I did! \n\nHere are some pointers that make this place great... (for locals) \n\n- Tourists flock to this place well before 10am because then the tour groups start, the ferry to Alcatraz leaves, they're leaving for Napa, etc. So when you roll out of bed and stroll in, say 11 or 12 , for brunch, its almost always guaranteed you will have a table. \n\n- You can drive and 99.5% find parking. Why? Because tourists don't drive. Also, they take advantage of their hotel's parking. \n\nMoving onto the food...\n\n- Generous sides of sourdough with jams and butter\n- HUGE fruit bowls\n- Fruit with everything! (even as garnish) \n- Hashbrown SHEETS y'all (so amazing)\n- I love me some scrambles! (if  you love bacon, get the bacon cheddar scramble. you will NOT be disappointed) I also recommend you substitute for egg whites, it just tasted better to me. \n- Coffee is delicious\n\nService is prompt and friendly (Those Thai are so friendly) Definitely one of my go to places for a hearty breakfast or brunch.

However, after reading some of the Yelp reviews and viewing a few of the food pics, we decided to try this for breakfast prior to heading off on our Ferry ride.  We are so glad we did!\n\nThe one thing that you need to know before getting to the restaurant is that there will most likely be a wait (unless you get here first thing when it opens).  We got there at about 10:30AM and waited for roughly 25 minutes for table for 4.  \n\nThe food was great!  The portions are huge!  The size of their hashbrows was out of this world!  I swear it was 8 inches by 5 inches (a friend ordered this as a separate side).  Our main dish were filled with fruit, and I really enjoyed the meal as a whole.  We were full and could not finish our plates.  \n\nOn average, we spent about 20 dollars each.  We did purchase beverages and extra sides which adds to the cost.  If you stick with water, and just the meal, you can probably come out spending 15 or less.\n\nThe service was quick and excellent!  The people there were very nice to us.  \n\nAs a local, I would definitely come here again if I pass by that area during the first half of the day!\n\nSo if you are looking for a breakfast spot near the Wharf, look no further!

A big ole plate of eggs, ham, fruit, and french toast landed in front of me as I basked in the sun outside. I annihilated everything - the french toast was bomb, fruit was fresh, eggs were eggs, and ham was a little dry. Overall a very fulfilling meal. Coffee was great too.", "author": "Nick W."}

Sure, they mainly cater to the tourista crowds that are staying in the nearby hotels and motels, but even a localite can sometimes venture into strange and unexplored territories once in a while.\n\nOn Sunday morning (and it is nice to see that they open up bright and early every day for early risers that aren't bent on \"Brunch\") I had their Greek Omelette. This was an absolutely HUGE breakfast. I think it says it's made with three eggs, but this had to be at least 4-5 eggs worth; plus, the large side of hashbrowns are done extremely well ~ nice and thin and crispy. There was a lot of fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach and Feta cheese; I would just have rather seen real Kalamata olives in it instead of the flavourless black ones from a can.\n\nIf you would care to read a more detailed review of my meal (and a few other stupid unrelated items), please click on my account here and check out my silly breakfastary 'blog.", "author": "Brian M."}

The freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee helps start the day with a refreshing taste too.\n\nThe service is fast and friendly, but can requires reminders for water and check-ups on how is the meal.

She had a veggie omelet and fruit bowl (13 dollars) and I had scrambled eggs with chicken sausage that came with a fruit bowl and free tea or coffee (11.00).  We both received three slabs of hot toasted sourdough bread with butter.  My mom liked her omelet which had a nice mixture of arugula, mushrooms, and bell peppers.  I loved my fruit bowl-- there were ten different kinds of fruit in it!  The pineapple was obviously cut from a fresh pineapple and there were huge chunks of it.  I was really impressed with the freshness and size of my fruit bowl which is easily worth 7-8 dollars. The service was quick in the beginning but it did take a while for me to get my bill.  The bathroom is located outside of the restaurant and inside an alley.  \n\nThe service was friendly.  I didn't like how my scrambled eggs tasted (it tasted like it was mixed with too many cooking additives) but otherwise, it was a good and generous meal.

I also love to eat as well and hardly finished. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Audrey Hepburn and every time I get this dish the fruit I get is always fresh! I've been to some restaurants that give you fruit salad as the side and they weren't that great. But here it's amazing. I haven't tried any of the egg dishes because I HATE eggs! (I know I'm weird) So I wouldn't be able to help in the part but everything else is great! \n\nEveryone needs to come here and plus, you are right by pier 39 and the wax museum etc.  So you get to burn that load off. \n\nAlso the workers there are super friendly!", "author": "Oisis J."}

You need to stand in line outside, at the front they will ask how many in your party. If your entire party is not present the staff will skip over you.

The waiter then said that they had a large table available and if we would be ok with sharing we could just divide the table into two. Both of us were agreeable to that. Directing us to our table they pointed to a round table in corner. It was set for a party of 5. Both us and the other couple were thinking it was going to be more rectangular and less intimate. It work fine in the end we chatted and ate:) I had the chilaquiles which come with a sheet and I mean SHEET of crunchy hash browns, it was super tasty. On top was a whole avocado, who doesn't like avocado?!? My boyfriend has the eggs Benedict with a sheet of crunchy hash browns and he was full after one but forced the second one down because it was so good!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "description": "I had very high expectations about this place, judging by previous reviews and photos of the food I had seen on Yelp. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the crab omelette. This was a $33 breakfast for one including coffee, an upgrade to Hollywood hash browns, OJ and a standard tip. I would have expected a better experience for that price. \n\nThe food was lacking flavour, and the omelette needed a lot of salt and Tabasco to be palatable. The biggest disappointment was the fact that my omelette arrived cold! The hash browns were hot at least, but that didn't make up for the barely lukewarm morsels of crab and cold pieces of avocado that made up the majority of my omelette. The hash browns were very mushy and soggy, not crisp like I had hoped. They had a bizarre bright orange artificial-looking cheddar cheese sauce creepily drizzled on top, which reminded me of a cross between cheese wiz and cheese in a can. Everything was piled up on a very small plate, making for a messy goulash-like concoction on my plate. Sound appetizing? \n\nI was served by 3 different waiters during my short visit. None were bad but none were great either. They were in auto drive. It took forever to get my first drink. I found myself slightly annoyed as I waited for my beverage, while I saw a few other tables get faster service. I was not even offered or brought water. To me, that's a necessity at any restaurant. \n\nHollywood Cafe was certainly not an experience I'm planning to repeat, especially for the price. In one word: overrated! I think the major draw is the huge portions.", "author": "B C."}

The eggs Benedict was a massive feast probably could have fed 2 normal hungry adults.  Came with a sheet of hash browns that covered the plate, 2 large eggs Benedict, some fresh cut fruit, 4 slices of buttered toasted French bread, and I got a cup of coffee.  That was a ton of food for 10 dollars.  Didn't wait at all either so that was nice, service was fast and the waitress was very nice.

I tried to order a combo meal but I do not eat meat so I wanted to get hash browns instead of meat so I asked my server and she yelled at me telling me I was unable to substitute even if I don't eat meat so I had to order things separately. I was really surprised because usually restaurants are very accommodating. I was fine with it but the server was just rude about it. It just left me with a bad impression. Being yelled at and getting mediocre food that all came out at different times is definitely not what I waited in line for 35 minutes for.

The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the sourdough bread was as good as San Francisco can deliver.  \n\nPrices were on par with the quality.  I had \"The James Dean\" and it included 2 eggs, 3 sausage links, two large slices of sourdough toast and a huge bowl of fresh fruit.  And I'm not talking about 2 or three different kinds of fruit.  I'm talking about grapefruit, grapes, raspberries, pineapples, apples, oranges, blackberries, bananas and kiwis.  In total, my bill came out to $10.80.  Add a couple dollar tip in there and you can walk away for under $15 a person.\n\nI'm planning on going back tomorrow to try one of their FIVE types of eggs benedict.

The fact that it is called Hollywood Cafe. \n\nThere are the other obvious red flag factors such as the gimmicky photos, cheese decor and continued theme of Hollywood. Like I really wanna think about Hollywood and its starlets, albeit old school ones when size 8 was sexy, when I am eating my Benedict with fried items and bacon!\n\nAnyhow, I was talked into going there and was VERY pleased that I gave up my fight and bias to this place. First of all, they give you SOURDOUGH bread all hot and warm with butter all over it...thank you for doing this for me. I would have never put that much butter on my bread but since you did it for me, how can I waste such perfect bread? That would be downright wasteful! Second of all, they have the best hash browns in the entire world- I think they are called Hollywood Hash browns..topped with bacon, green onion, bell pep, and a cheese sauce...HEAVEN. \n\nThe fruit bowls that accompany the entrees are overflowing with FRESH cuts of excellent fruit- no half ripe, or over aired, ageing fruit- straight colorful delicious loveliness! One time I ordered an apple, mint iced tea...was so refreshing I wasn't too upset at the 4.95$. I did make sure to get my money's worth by having them refill it numerous times and even asked for a to-go cup...they did not even bat an eyelash or appear to want to roll their eyes (and if they did, they concealed their contempt which is all one can really ask for!). \n\nThe service is fantastic and the food is on the same level- wonderful. I must say, I have beaten myself up quite a bit for letting my anti-things-like-hollywood-cafe get the best of me. I am working on it because this place put my previous notions in their place...now if I can only get over my hatred for places like the Tipsy Pig and Cha-Cha-Cha I will become more well rounded...yeah, I doubt that will happen any time soon.", "author": "Lucia V."}

The tables were all small but for 5 we were ok.  Seated in about half hr on sat 9 am. \nCoffee was nice an strong. Always topped up. Omelette sanfranscian was delicious and huge portion size. I've upgraded the hash browns to hollywood hashbrowns and shared my meal with daughter and we both were stuffed. \nThe kids chocolate pancake (junior iv) came with scrambled eggs was large enough for an adult. \nThe healthy omelette came with fruit was also very good and healthy. A note tho. The bread they serve with meal always tipped with huge amounts of butter so ask for it on the side as I noticed before I ordered. \nthe servers are real friendly and I'll be happy to return anytime.\nThere is also meter parking just half a block down which is .50 cents an hr from 7-12pm and i think after that it goes up. don't park in fron of the restaurant unless u have to. the meter there is 2.50 an hr in the morning.", "author": "Mrs H."}

This was on a Sunday AM and I was worried we wouldn't be able to get in...a line outside when our cab pulled up confirmed it.  Then, to my massive shock, I saw the freakish but friendly speed at which they were turning tables.  I still don't understand it.  We were told to write our own names down and that it would be about 10 minutes.  Amazingly, it was.  We got a lovely table outside in no time and coffee came quickly.  \n\nEverything we tried was good but the stand-out was the fresh fruit.  After looking at all the food in front of us, we wished we had just gotten one omelette to share and two orders of fruit.  It was WAY too much food and the fruit stole the show anyway.  Coffee refills were quick and food was hot and fresh.  Will absolutely be back my next time in the area, fabulous.", "author": "Valerie M."}

With the help of Yelp reviews and Mama's being closed on Mondays, I landed at Hollywood Cafe.  The restuarant was smaller than I anticipated but with 45 mins until the 2pm closing time there were plenty of empty tables.\n\nI ordered the Vivian Leigh which is a cheddar, chopped bacon scrambled egg croissant with a side of fruit and coffee/tea.  The croissant was nicely done, nothing spectaular but very much a menu item I would return to get.  The portions were huge; really too much to consume in one sitting.  I found my myself wondering about what happens to all of the perfectly good fruit that is sent back to the kitchen uneaten... This thought did not sit well with me so I immediately stopped eating my fruit. \n\nThe coffee/tea promised with the meal never made it over to my table but I honestly could not consume another thing after finishing the croissant.  All-in-all I would return for another Vivian Leigh, sans the fruit.", "author": "Jen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-28", "description": "I wanted to review this place after a visit to San Francisco where I had breakfast at Hollywood Cafe and Mama's.\n\nMama's is an extremely popular place that I found through yelp and I would normally have eaten breakfast here, but it was Monday and Mama's was closed so I had to find a Plan B.  Plan B was Hollywood Cafe, a less hyped but still highly reviewed breakfast joint.\n\nLet me start off by saying that my experience at Hollywood Cafe was AWESOME, even better than the breakfast I would have later in the week at Mama's.  And THAT is why I need to review this place.\n\nWhat I had:\n\n-Dungeness Crab Eggs Benedict\n-Fruitbowl Side\n-Coffee\n-Sourdough Bread (comes with every breakfast)\n\nThe Benedict was some of the best I've ever had.  It was traditional EB, but instead of canadian bacon, you got crab, spinach, and caperberries.  The meal was prepared very well and the flavor was awesome.  The only downside was the english muffin wasn't great, it needed to be a little more crispy.  But this did not prevent me from loving the meal.\n\nThe most impressive thing was the side of Fruit.  Never have I enjoyed a fruit bowl so much.  Not only was it huge, but there was a variety (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, canteloupe, melon, banana, apple, pineapple, cherry, kiwi), but it was high quality fruit.  The fruit was prepared like a main attraction and not a side.  \n\nThe coffee and sour dough bread were also very good. \n\nFor an everyday breakfast, the price was a bit high...crab benedict with fruit side was about 16 dollars.  However, the exact same thing at Mama's, minus the awesome fruit bowl, was selling for 22 dollars.  Mama's also includes and obligatory 30 minute wait outside in the cold.  For a direct comparison, my mother had french toast at both Mama's and Hollywood Cafe and she enjoyed the Cafe more.\n\nOverall, this place was enjoyable enough that we had to come back again later in the week.  Again, we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated and the food was very good.  My parents had sandwiches which looked great.\n\nI would highly recommend checking this place out if you are looking for a GREAT breakfast at a good price without the hype and wait that you get at other places.", "author": "Scott B."}

Typical brunch dishes but they're known for:\n- hollywood hashbrowns - hashbrowns topped with onions, mushrooms, peppers, bacon and cheese. are you kidding me?\n- MOUNTAINOUS bowls of fruit that come with everything - we're talking apples, oranges, bananas, kiwi, grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, blueberries, raspberries...the list goes on and on.\n\nHad lunch here a few weeks ago around 11:30 and only waited about 5 minutes (granted, SF summer tourist season was over) before we were seated. They sat us outside and even though it was a bit chilly, all was well because they have outdoor heaters!\n\nFood came quickly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-30", "description": "I really wanted to rate this place 5 stars. The food was really good. We ordered the pancakes, eggs, bacon, and my husband ordered the French toast. We were really pleased with the fresh fruit selection also!! It was plentiful and FRESH!!! Omg, it was amazing!!! The 1 hour wait was well worth it. We had just flew in from Philadelphia and headed straight here, all thanks for the endless reviews! The food definitely delivered on its promise!!!\n\nNow, onto the service, which is SOLEY why I rated this restaurant a 3 star. You write your name on a list for a table and wait outside where there's hardly anywhere to stand because it's so crowded with other people waiting. We knew the wait would be at least an hour, per the lady behind the counter. So we decided to walk a block down to the shopping area. I called the restaurant about 30 minutes later just to check the status on how far down the list we were at that point. The woman who picked up the phone wasn't at all helpful. Her response was \"I don't have time to look. You need to come back to the restaurant right now because if we call your name and you're not here, you will be removed from the list and will have to wait at the bottom again.\" Then, she hung up. Wow...ummmm...okay then. So we headed right back. I walked in...and took a look at the list and there were still 15 names in from of us. Took me 2 seconds to look...which I'm sure she could have done. We stood outside for another 45 minutes waiting.\n\nOnce seated, our waitress had a very unpleasant attitude. It was almost unbelievable. When we placed our order, I order the fruit with my meal. After explaining to my husband how good I heard the fruit was, he decided to call our waitress over so he could add one to his meal. Her response was \"it's too large of an order for you both to have one each. Just share\". I kindly replied with \"thanks for your recommendation, but as my husband asked, we'd like to each have our own, so please add one on for him. thanks!\" her reply \"well, if you decide you don't want it, I'm no taking it off of your bill\" and she walked away.\n\nAt that point, I wanted to pay for the drinks we had, and leave. However, my husband convinced me to stay. He was a lot hungrier than me obviously...because I could have gone elsewhere. We decided to stay.\n\nHer entire presence and attitude throughout the rest of our dining experience was just rude. She never came over to check on us, only when we flagged her down from across the restaurant. She rushed our questions and order almost s if she just simply couldn't be bother with us asking for more coffee or orange juice. It was ridiculous.\n\nSo, yes, the food is really good. But the service ruined my experience and I wouldn't dine here again based on that alone.\n\nI've read that the service here isn't great, but I wasn't expecting that at all!\n\nWe left her a 20% tip, because we are respectable tippers. I do however, think that they should explore the idea on how to respectably treat their customers. I'm not the type to take being mistreated in exchange for a good meal. San Fran has plenty of other places to dine for breakfast that are just as good, if not better! Brenda's and Mama's to name a few!\n\nBTW, we BOTH ate ALL our of fruit.\n\nYou're welcome.", "author": "Kera N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-28", "description": "Like Alissa A. said, location and tourists (myself included) notwithstanding, this is incredibly good breakfast food. Really fresh and very tasty. We are staying in the area accidentally for a work trip -- would never ordinarily choose a touristic area like this one, and had high hopes but moderate expectations. In a word: go. at 9am on a Friday, we waited about 15 minutes for a table.\n\nWhile we waited for our breakfast, they brought slices of toasted sourdough. There were raspberry jam and marmalade on the table -- these tasted like sysco brand but were tasty enough, and the bread was really good.\n\nI had the Audrey Hepburn -- 2 pancakes and fresh fruit, plus a side of 2 over medium eggs and coffee/water. The eggs were done perfectly (if you've seen my other breakfasty reviews you know that this is a HG item and also a bit of a unicorn). The pancakes were very cinnamony; this was unexpected but not unpleasant at all. The fruit was extensive and there was a ton. Other people have mentioned the overflowing bowl of fruit -- I will specify that it was strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, banana, orange, grapefruit, and apple slices. And yes, it was overflowing and very fresh. The coffee was fine and frequently offered refills; the water had a lemon slice. \n\nThe man friend had the eggs benedict with Hollywood Hash Browns. The hash browns, omg, the hash browns! Bacon, onion, mushroom, pepper, cheese -- these are loaded and very good. Very crispy too. The benedict had lovely thick pieces of ham, but the hollandaise was only mediocre. Somewhat of a hollandaise snob, I feel that if it's not lemony, it's not hollandaise. This was pretty much just buttery -- I couldn't detect any note of lemon at all. \n\nThe meal came to $30 before tip.\n\nOverall, this was a win. A really solid four-star breakfast to stand up to the best anywhere, and extra points for being so legit in a tourist trap area. Bottom line: tons of fresh food served quickly and for a reasonable price given the location.", "author": "Jessica B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-25", "description": "My friends were in town from L.A. and we all wanted to go down to the Fisherman's Wharf. Since it was too late to go by the time we were ready to go out Saturday (after commute time, we would have only gotten a couple hours to hang), we decided to get up early on Sunday, and go have breakfast there instead. My hubby and I were excited when we each individually found Hollywood on Yelp. It sounded good, and the one dollar sign was a definite yay. \n\nWe took the BART to the F-line, walked a little, and with no hassle, we were there. It was a beautiful day and the outside was crowded, but I was pleasantly surprised that the four of us were able to be seated at a table as soon as we walked in the door. \n\nWe ordered a Diet Coke, two coffees, and one decaf (mine, of course) to drink. My husband also asked for ice water and we were served four glasses of room temperature water with no ice and a thin slice of lemon. For some reason, my coffee mug was served only half-full. I shrugged this off for the most part, and then we went on to order our food. \n\nThe hubby and I split an omelet that had crab meat and avocado, and cheese, and also an order of French Toast. My friend ordered the fruit plate, and a bagel and cream cheese. My other friend ordered a simple eggs-meat-toast kind of breakfast. \n\nI have to say I have mixed feelings about the food. I appreciated how fresh all the ingredients were, and that they used sustainable, locally grown foods when possible. The fruit was really fresh. My friend received a huge plate of strawberries, bananas, apples, and kiwi. My omelet was just OK. I was a little adventurous ordering one with crab meat, but I'd had a salmon and cream cheese omelet once at Benjy's in Houston, and really enjoyed it, so I thought why not. The hash browns were pretty gross. I like mine a little crunchy, and these were just downright greasy. The omelet was more like a scramble. We had sourdough toast, and that was good, of course. \n\nThe service was on par with the food. They were not very attentive. Could have been worse, I'm sure, but nothing special, either. \n\nThe atmosphere was that it was a quaint, cute place. The menu items named after movie stars was half-cool, half-gimmicky -- I couldn't decide. \n\nAlso, for the bathroom, you have to use the one that is for the whole building. You go out the front doors and then into another door in the building, and then down this dark, dank hallway, and around a corner, and then you get to a pretty icky, gas-station quality restroom (I hope you have sanitizer with you.). It's quite the trek!\n\nThe Verdict: This is more like a three-and-a-half. On the plus side, many of the menu items were under $10, which is hard to find in this town, much less the area of town where the restaurant is located, but I just wasn't feelin' it.", "author": "Cara S."}

My boyfriend got a fruit bowl with his, and it looked so yummy, I asked if I could order one to go, so I could snack on it later. They were glad to put it one together for me. \n\nThe servings were huge, and the cost was cheap.The toast wasn't just sliced white or wheat wonderbread, but delicious slice and toasted french bread. YUM. The eggs weren't processed egg whites or anything- I watched a guy crack about 20 eggs, scramble them, and then pour them through a strainer to make sure there weren't shell pieces. Smart, and efficient! The bacon was crisp and well done.\n\nAnd let me just say, the Hollywood Hashbrowns?! DELICIOUS! Even if you don't like a lot of stuff on your hashbrowns, they were delicious even plain. \n\nI got some chocolate milk, and they mixed it there, best way to make chocolate milk! They even have mimosas, which completely rocked my world. Who doesn't love a mimosa with brunch or breakfast?! :-) \n\nWe are definitely going back before we leave town!", "author": "Cori P."}

There were only 3 of us there and when the table was ready, they wouldn't let us sit until our party arrived.  We requested to sit anyway and said we'd just order theirs to go.  The food was SUPER quick, though, and our friends finally joined us and we somewhat got ignored for a little bit.  Hey, as much as I was irritated, we also probably irritated them during such a busy morning and they finally took the rest of the orders and got the food delivered super quickly again.  I do not blame the servers for being that way and they actually became likeable again at the end.\n\nTHE FOOD:  IS AMAZING!  I ordered the crab omelette and it was delicious.  A couple of the party ordered the James Dean... and we all admired this.  It comes with a ton of fresh fruit!  Truly truly fresh and variations of fruit (as opposed to one or two options in a little cup, it was a BOWL of lots of fruit!.. enough to be its own meal for some!!!).  Also, the sourdough bread was AWESOME!  We ate that up and I have been thinking about it for days since!  Silly, I know, but I love bread in SF!!!\n\nBottom Line - GREAT FOOD!  EAT HERE!

It is a fairly tiny restaurant, but they pack in quite a few tables inside, plus a few tables outside on the sidewalk (they even have overhead heaters to keep you warm on chilly SF mornings!)  I think I have ordered the same thing every time I have eaten here: the Vivian Leigh- bacon, eggs, and cheese on a croissant with a side of fresh fruit.  Most places give a tiny ramekin with a few cubes of melon.  Not Hollywood Cafe!  They give you a big glass bowl overflowing with fresh berries and fruit.  Their portions are so big that I can rarely finish my dish!  The only downside is the restroom situation.... They don't have their own restroom in the restaurant.  Instead, they give you a code and send you next door into what looks like an abandoned office building, and you have to wind down a few hallways to find the locked restrooms (hence the key code). It just feels shady to me, but the rest of the dining experience is 5 stars, so I won't let the restroom situation stop me from eating here :)", "author": "Dana P."}

Boyfriend got the eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon and shrimp (there was some fancy name for it that I forgot), and I got the dungeness crab eggs benedict.  Mine was...just amazing.  I never liked eggs benedict before, but this place converted me.  The hollandaise sauce was just right, and the crab + spinach together was perfect.  (UGHHH, the worst part about yelping is that when I try to remember the food, I get freaking hungry).  The eggs benedicts come with hash as well, but be smart like the bf and ask to substitute with Peter's hash.  It's loaded with everything!!!\n\nPrices were OK, portions are huge.

I looked his place up on Yelp and it sounded quirky, so we checked it out. \n\nThe size of the space was kind of a buzzkill, because you're literally elbow-to-elbow with strangers, but this may also be the very thing that draws such a crowd. I kind of wonder if they might be wise to invest in a bigger space, but that might kill the \"local hangout\" vibe. People will only wait in line for thirty minutes if the people ahead of them have done the same. \n\nThe waitress wasn't memorable, except she seemed slightly confused when I asked her about a substitution, but if I had stared at hundreds of people in a four hour time span, I'd be confused about what my name was. \n\nThe decor was groovy, with pictures of celebs on the menus and walls. Fun stuff. \n\nThe food was above-average breakfast fare and worth the price. I would love to come check the out the next time we are in the area, but SF has so many restaurants to try that if you're not a local, then realistically, you'll probably be shuffling around to new spots every time you're in town.

We thought to ourselves this must be a good place to have breakfast.  However, as we were about to get in the door, the hostess called out for a party of 4 and directed to a seat outside.  Another party of 4, POLITELY, asked if there was a mistake since they were ahead of the party.  The hostess, quickly looked and fumingly replied....\"you asked for an inside table and this table is for outside.  LET ME DO MY JOB\".   She huffed and puffed while we were a little shocked as we followed her into the restaurant.  She then spoke to us with a very stern voice...\"PUT YOUR NAME DOWN\".  My wife and I looked at each other and quickly turned around out the door as we looked at the other poor guests that were unnecessarily got their heads bitten off by this lady hostess.  She really didn't have to respond to them in that manner.  They were very kind and was even polite in asking why their party was overlooked.

It came with a huge portion of fruit including an entire banana so keep that in mind. Good place to stop on the way to Pier 33 for the Alcatraz tour.", "author": "Jenelle R."}

It was right around the corner from our hotel so we figured we would give it a shot. A cafe in the middle of the touristy wharf neighborhood I wouldn't think would be that great but I figured our friends (the locals) knew what they were talking about. Placed a to go order for four, mostly French toasts with a side of fruit which set us back $75. Pretty pricey but any request we made like substituting for fruit was an additional charge which was unfortunate. The place is chaotic and picking up a to go order on a Saturday morning was no exception. All the orders were correct which in itself is great cuz anytime you pick up a large order, it seems like something is always off. The French toast tasted amazing. Had the vanilla banana and it was perfect. And the portion was just right. I thought they would be stingy with the side of fruit substitution but it was a large container of fruit and fruit I actually wanted to eat (not just cantaloupe or melon which I hate). I would eat here again but perhaps not on the weekend as I personally don't think a lot of foods are worth waiting in ridiculously long lines for even if it tastes good.", "author": "T H."}

Best. Decision. Ever.\n\nHollywood Cafe is a tiny little breakfast and lunch spot on North Point, about three blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. In a city of absurdly overpriced food, this little street side cafe was a welcome alternative.  Not only could the four of us eat for less than $50 (which, in SFO, is a bit of an anomaly), but the food was well-prepared, the portions perfect, and the service friendly and attentive without being overbearing (or creepy - see my review of Alioto's). \n\nI can safely say everything we ordered - omelets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, eggs, hash browns - was, well, delicious. The ingredients were fresh and cooked to order. The fruit on the side freshly cut. The orange juice freshly squeezed. The coffee piping hot. The food was so good, in fact, we ate breakfast there every day.\n\nThere are only two drawbacks I could identify, and they're not bad enough to downgrade it from 5 stars.  First, the place is cash only, but this fact is not prominently displayed.  Second, if you eat inside (which some people do avoid the early morning SFO chill), you end up smelling like breakfast. However, there is a solution: bring cash, wear a sweatshirt and eat at one of the sidewalk tables.", "author": "Gavin S."}

Not a fan of greasy spoon or places most other people like for breakfast.  I like fresh, filling, and at least semi-healthy.\n\nTheir menu is very large and varied.  something for everyone.

It's the kind of place that makes a trip just that much more memorable.\n\nIf we didn't stay at the Hyatt across the street, we probably would have ignored this little gem. Situated in the most touristy part of town, and with a name like that, you would think this is just another tourist-fooling place like all the other restaurants in the area. But the truth is, Hollywood Cafe rivals any of your neighborhood brunch favorite in any city. In fact, it's probably my favorite breakfast/brunch place in the world.\n\nI first came in here to buy a coffee and get some quarters for parking. The coffee was good, the staff was all smiling and the place just had a fresh, happy vibe to it. So when my parents asked where to get brunch, I took them here. Then we came here everyday, even right before our flight.\n\nThere's most likely a line. If you have to wait for a table, do it. If it's 30 minutes, wait. The space is small and the decor simple, but very warm and cozy and not plain at all. I even like the hollywood star portrays on the wall. There were compliment messages and letters from around the world on the fridge door. The staff was extremely nice, they were always smiling and looked like they were genuinely happy working there. By our 2nd time, they already remembered us and by the 3rd time, we felt like we'd been their loyal customers for ages. Service was always fast, and they never got anything wrong. Everything we tried there was fantastic. Fresh ingredients, big portions and cheap prices. The benedict was world class. Like everyone mentioned it's cash only, but you don't need a lot to have a great meal here.\n\nA lovely place in a lovely town. One of these days I'll move to San Fran, and I would start as many days at Hollywood cafe as possible.", "author": "Qian M."}

We arrived just before 9:00 a.m. and got a table right away.  However, by the end of the meal, there was a wall of people outside waiting for a table.  I have to admit that having forty people look jealously at my plate made the omelet taste that much sweeter.\n\nThe service is speedy.  I waited a minute or two for my coffee, but the food followed so quickly, I didn't have a chance to take a sip before everything was one the table.  I'd be tempted to say it came too fast and must have been microwaved.  I would have been wrong.  The kitchen is open and very small, and I got to watch the highly organized chefs operate more quickly than I could believe.\n\nA previous post recommended getting fruit as a side, and I must agree.  Everything was fresh and the portions were outstanding.  The strawberries were as big as my fist and perfectly sweet.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "William B."}

Since I'm from the east coast, the three-hour time difference caused me to wake up painfully early throughout my trip.  No biggie, waking up early means breakfast! I didn't have to look far for a quaint breakfast spot, since Hollywood Cafe is located directly across the street from the Hyatt.  \n\nHollywood Cafe is a cute, tiny place that serves breakfast and lunch. Tables are very close together and there are customer testimonials posted on the wall and refrigerator.  We managed to score the last table available.  Since it was a bit on the chilly side, they had space heaters plugged in adding to its home-y ambiance. \n\nThe energetic waiter gave us menus and took our drink orders: coffee please.  The waiter came back lightening quick with coffee, milk/cream and sugar in tow.  How efficient!  As I scanned the menu, I was amazed how affordable this place was, considering it being in a rather touristy location.  \n\nI decided on the waffles (I have a thing for waffles) with eggs and bacon.  When the waiter came back to take our order, my world came crashing down when he told me the bad news.  Their waffle maker broke and had yet to get it fixed. So no waffles!!  Crushed, I pulled myself together and went with my second choice: pancakes with eggs and a side of bacon.  My dining companion ordered his favorite: French toast with eggs and ham steak.  Both dishes came with crispy hash browns.\n\nMy pancakes were fluffy and buttery.  I love that the plates come with pieces of fresh strawberries and bananas.  Very Californian of them.  My dining companion's french toast was crispy (in a good way) and cooked perfectly.  We also ordered a side of their special hash browns, cooked with cheese, peppers and onions...mmmm I'm drooling thinking about the hash browns.  I also ordered the orange juice, which had the just-squeezed taste.  My coffee mug was never empty and the coffee was perfectly smooth, strong but, did not taste burnt strong.\n\nJust a reminder: it's cash only.  Considering the size of the plates and the amount of food we ordered, we were expecting the bill to come out to around $40.  When the energetic waiter presented the bill, I was stunned at the price.  For two people, we spent a total of $34 (that's including tip).  After my breakfast, my dining companion and I walked from Fisherman's Wharf to the Golden Gate Bridge and back to Fisherman's Wharf.  Breakfast at the Hollywood Cafe is the best way to start your day of sight-seeing.  \n\nI would have given them five stars, but I don't think I can forgive them for not having waffles.", "author": "Jenn C."}

It came with 2 slices of toast a slice of orange and a huge serving of hashbrowns. For a side I ordered some french toast, nice serving of two slices. Woooweee - the serving on that was also huge, and mighty delicious. It came with fresh, cut fruit and another side of hashbrowns, which I gladly gave to my fiance, as I would have been insane to eat that along with everything else I ate that morning. \n\nThe service was prompt and completely friendly. The wait was about 10 minutes, around 10:00 am and was worth it! The cafe is very small, so on a weekend morning, expect a little wait, as it looks as if it tends to be packed.\n\nI have no negative reviews - as the price fit the excellent service and the fresh, ever-so-yummy food. \n\nI'm definitely going here again when I come back to SF!", "author": "Patricia A."}

I ordered the french toast, and my friend ordered an omelette with pesto, peppers, etc. \n\nThe food was good, but I'm a bit biased because I think all breakfast food is delicious. I'd read that the fruit was abundant and varied, which was true. The omelette was also fairly tasty.\n\nMy 3 stars is predominantly centered around the fact that the food was pretty damn expensive, almost $10/plate for breakfast food, and that the food is really just nothing special. It is good, definitely, but there is nothing really amazing about it.\n\nThe strangest thing also happened as I walked away. I felt like I needed to throw up immediately after we started walking towards the car. Not too great of a feeling to start your day.", "author": "stacy c."}

It was a nice place for lunch, and I'll probably go back if I get the chance.\n\nFOOD: My party had a few of the breakfast items. Everything was good...not amazing or spectacular, just pretty good. One thing of particular note, I ordered a cup of fruit and the thing was enormous (for a cup...). It also had an incredible variety of fruit; melons, watermelon, apples, grapes, kiwi, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, oranges, & probably more. On the down side, our toast came out drenched in butter. Maybe some people like their toast like that, I think I should've been given the option. \n\nATMOSPHERE: It's small, so it can feel a bit cramped. But it's nice and clean. The only thing really Hollywood about it is they have pictures of actors from the '50's on the wall. Otherwise, there's nothing really unique about the place. \n\nSERVICE:  The staff was great. They were pleasant and very responsive to every request. The food also came out very quickly as well. \n\nCOST:  I found that it was a tad on the expensive side for what is ultimately just breakfast cafe, but it could be that price is closer to the norm for the area...\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  This isn't a \"must go\" place, and I wouldn't go too far out of my way to eat here, but it's a solid spot for breakfast or lunch.", "author": "DA B."}

I shared some sort of breakfast combo with a friend. It came with an over easy egg, which was done a little too easy. It was way too runny for my liking. The bacon was too crispy. The fresh fruit was certainly fresh, but nothing different from vising my local farmer's market.\n\nBasically, I came in with high expectations and it wasn't met. However, the waiters were all very friendly and prompt. He refilled my coffee as soon as he noticed I needed more.", "author": "Emily T."}

I came here with my bf this morning for a nice Thursday morning/afternoon Brunch. There was a 10-15 minute wait which was no biggie. We finally got seated inside and there were a lot of tourists surrounding us, lol. We took a look at the menu and everything sounded really good! I ordered a Smoked Turkey and Avocado Eggs Benedict with Chipotle Hollandaise Sauce that came with hashbrowns and sourdough toast; bf ordered the Meat Lover's Omelet (with hashbrowns and toast). Everything was DELICIOUS! And BIG portions too! My Eggs Benedict was very delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was out of this world! And the smoked turkey was mhmmm Mhmm! I loved the Sourdough Toast as well. :) I tried a piece of the Meat Lover's omelet and it was good too! It had ham, bacon, and ground beef! We also shared a buttermilk pancake with sliced bananas and strawberries and a fruit bowl! Yum! I would definitely come back here! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!\n\nThe service was decent and my water glass was never empty nor my coffee cup! \n\nThank you Hollywood Cafe for a great meal!", "author": "Francesca H."}

We were seated after about 20 minutes, and from then on, we were rocking & rolling!  The menu was filled with lots of traditional, comfort style items with a flair. We ordered the Orangish French Toast, made with Grand Marnier. It was 3 thick halves on a plate loaded with gorgeous fresh fruit. The French toast was rich, golden and slightly crispy. Delish! And only 1 of 4 types of FT on the menu!  My boyfriend got a meat-lovers omelette. It was ginormous and came on the plate with the biggest, but thinnest, slab of hash browns I've ever seen.  Perfect for people who like hash browns for the crunch, and not all the mushy potato inside.  His omelette was filled with ham, sausage & bacon.. And (this was a first).. He could only eat half. Not sure if it was because we split the FT too, or the size of the omelet, but he's a big boy who took a to-go box for the first time ever that I remember. I ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich, because lunch is served at 11am. It was sweet and loaded with tomatoes, arugula and dripping jack cheese.  Like my counterpart, I could only eat half.. But happily took the rest to go. The service was fantastic.  The waiter spoke with a bug smile and RAN to get us another water. The place was filled with couples, singles, families & tourists. A boisterous, noisy place with signs of old Hollywood on the walls.  You might have to wait if your group includes more than 4 or 5. Not sure they can accommodate large groups.

The dining room was tiny and so fast that you could actually get a tasty butter cooked eggs sit down breakfast quicker than waiting in line for a cup of coffee.\n\nThat is now a faded memory. Unfortunately this review is on top of a colossal disappointment. They have recently reopened after a renovation that took over the space next to them. We rolled out of our office to grab a quick cheese covered breakfast to replace the lunch we would have that day. I ordered my usual eggs cheese on a croissant (which was equal parts eggs and USA cheese...so great) and a side of hash browns, pretty simple stuff. Now when they asked me what kind of cheese did I want I had to question... the old Hollywood Cafe never had a cheese choice. American and lots of it. When you used to order a grilled cheese at this place they would have to triple-decker the thing to even out the cheese and keep the top slice from sliding off. So my answer to \"what kind of cheese?\" well I said American of course. The reply was, we don't have that. UHHHHH. Cheddar I guess, the other orange cheese. So the people I was with always enjoyed the same sandwich. A veggie breakfast 3 decker sandwich that was egg and cheese on one layer and avocado and grilled mushrooms, onions and peppers on the other layer. It was a giant sandwich, 2 meals worth and fantastic. So they ordered that. Their sandwiches showed up and this is when we discovered that this is not the same old Hollywood Cafe. They were the saddest un-toasted, two slices of bread, no cheese, veg on bread sandwiches we have ever seen with sprouts. They said no to them they were so awful looking. The staff asked what was the problem, the food looks and tastes terrible kind of problem. We asked them what happened to the old sandwich. They said that they merged the menus with the other place that they took over, then brought over some scrambled eggs so we could stuff them into the sandwich I guess. The croissant was OK but not the same, not a lot of cheese and so so eggs but definitely edible. The staff are and have always been nice, but I suppose this is my goodbye. I will not try to lend any advice as that I have never owned a restaurant and I understand that places down in FW don't really rely on repeat business. So, nice staff, don't order from a memory and you probably wont be disappointed. But, I will not be returning.", "author": "William R."}

For instance, what makes Mama's so good? There's always a long line, but for breakfast? Are they known for something? Eggs Benedict? Oh well, I guess I'll have to stand in line to find out! I digress...\n\nAnyway, I felt the same way going to Hollywood Cafe. First of all, it wasn't that crowded. I guess their location does not receive much foot traffic from locals. Then again that area is more for tourists. No crowd? Must not be good huh? To the contrary... I went here with my friend a while back and we had a very filling breakfast (most important meal of the day folks). I had a three egg omelet and he had a veggie something... While I didn't pay, we got a lot of breakfast for the buck!\n\nToday I went there again, but this time for lunch. My decision on what to eat was further clouded when the waiter said they serve breakfast all day long. I love breakfast (especially French toast drowning in maple syrup)! But I settled on a regular burger. The burger was priced right at $4.95. It wasn't one of those thick 1/3 lb. burgers so if you like that go someplace else. It came with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayo on a toasted bun. I love toasted buns (get your minds out of the gutter). No sides, but for $2 more, I got some garlic fries. Total lunch bill a little over $7.\n\nWhat I like about this place is the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable.

Never have I questioned the name of an eating establishment and poured scorn or questioned their product for that reason (See Wendy C.!). \nI was in SF over Christmas (23rd to 30th) and breakfasted at the Hollywood Grill three times, including Christmas Morning. The food, service and general ambience of the place was five star. Never have I experienced a better breakfast. Everything we ordered was always fresh, hot (where cooked) and extremely tasty. The longest we ever had to wait for a table was five minutes. The staff were exemplary and very pleasant. I personally had the French Toast Combo Breakfast, the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon  and Shrimp and the James Dean (with poached eggs and bacon). All were served with a healthy portion of the freshest and sweetest fruits (Melon, Raspberries, Strawberries, Kiwi, Blackberries and Orange). On the table were a lovely Raspberry Jam and an extremely good Orange Marmalade, both being perfect additions to the sourdough toast served to all.\nThe eggs were always served as I like them (the poached eggs are particularly well presented and good), the bacon thick, tasty and perfectly cooked, the salmon rich and smokey, the shrimp were shrimp.\nWe tried three other places for breakfast while in SF (Caffe Sappora, Pat's and the second-rate Beach Street Grill) but none of them even came near to the Hollywood Grill.\nThe Hollywood Grill is by far the best breakfast place I have ever eaten breakfast and I cannot recommend them more highly.", "author": "Brad B."}

The staffs are very courteous and kind.\n\nBeing hooked, I went there several times and here is some of the dishes I tried: vegetarian hamburger (tastes like real hamburger, delicious), steak hamburger (awesome!), and mushroom omelet with smoked salmon (I had this several times.  Excellent!).  The food is very tasty.  Each part of food is perfectly cooked and appropriately seasoned.  I can tell the cook is one of the best in town.

No one smiled at me, it was cash only, no one said hi or was nice. Hated it.", "author": "Allanah C."}

I had a grilled croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and tomato. It was incredibly good, as was the fresh orange juice. The service was great.", "author": "Jennifer P."}

Everything the other reviewers said were spot on. Orange juice fresh, coffee hot, I had the meat lovers omelet - to die for, hasbrowns brill, and I had to get a side of fresh fruit because of the reviews. Excellent, fresh and juicy, but so much i had to take it back to my hotel. The staff were very quick and attentive, worth the wait.", "author": "Glenn M."}

My french toast was fabulous  - and I couldn't believe how much delicious fresh fruit it came with!  We asked the waiter for a Mickey Mouse pancake for my daughter, and although it wasn't on the menu, they prepared one for her - with whipped cream and fruit for his face.  The bacon and eggs that my husband ordered were excellent, and the portions quite hearty.  After eating breakfast at 9:00 a.m., I didn't get hungry again until late afternoon!  Yes, the restaurant is a little small, but with fewer folks to feed at a time, they were able to get our meals to us very quickly.  Good food - good value!", "author": "Tasha K."}

It was a block from the Hilton, so yes, most of us diners were out-of-towners, but so what! Why should we go to Denny's when we can get good, fast, cheap food, and eat outside and feel the breeze?! I loved the Ocean- its an omelet with shrimp and salmon in it- so awesome! you can't get that back where we're from. The french toast was great too, and everything you order comes with a little fruit to sweeten up your meal. They do only take cash, but they do state that on the menu to let you know ahead of time. Its a small place- I think 4 tables inside and 5 outside- but every time we went there at least 4 were already occupied. I think our meals averaged $20-$24 per day for both of us, not including tip. If you like a good little breakfast place, definitely give it a try!", "author": "S S."}
