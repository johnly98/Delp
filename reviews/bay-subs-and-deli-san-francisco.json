I sat in to enjoy my sandwich with my dad, mother, & grandmother. The sandwich I selected from the menu was the crab sandwich with sourdough bread. I really enjoyed it!!! The crisp of the bread to the seasoned crab. I believe I came at a busy time, that still did not change the friendly workers. They provide great customer service. As I was eating, I seen the employee make a sandwich for a customer that was not on the menu which was very nice of her. I noticed they received many phone calls for customers that were placing orders. All the customers left with smiles which made me happy!! I didn't eat the other half of my sandwich and was wrapping it up.....the employee asked to wrap it for me....I told her thanks but I got it! She even gave me a bag to take it in!!! AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They are sweet and very personable!!!", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

Went on Yelp and found this little gem.\n\nOrdered the Italian sub on Dutch crunch bread with provolone cheese and found a seat.  The toasted sandwich was delivered to my table on the curb lickety split.  Meat was tasty, cheese was all melty goodness and the bread was crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Overall a great little sammie!\n\nThe staff was quick and attentive and delivered my meal even though this is not that type of restaurant.\n\nThe place is small, real small.  Has about 4 seats inside with two tiny tables.  There are three more tables on the sidewalk that can seat about 9 more patrons.\n\nOverall a good bet in Pacific heights and would recommend.", "author": "Matt F."}

The sandwiches at both of those spots far exceed the quality here.\n\nPrices are high relative to size.  The small looks to be about the size of a 6'' Subway sub; I'm used to the \"small\" sandwich size at other shops being about 150% the size of these.\n\nI was also underwhelmed with the ingredients.  There wasn't a lot of turkey relative to other toppings, the sandwich was constructed in such a way that all the meat was to one side of the sandwich, and the spicy brown mustard was overpowering.\n\nFinally, the sandwich was somehow wrapped in such a way that the paper was inside of the sandwich, meaning that once the cheese melted and re-solidified and I went to remove the paper from the sandwich...it was stuck the cheese and totally pulled the sandwich apart.\n\nIf I was in this area and was dying for a sub sandwich, this is edible....it's just not as good as it could be.", "author": "Tay H."}

Finally came in today and ordered the bulgogi sandwich. Now the sandwich is quite tasty. The problem I had is the way they cut the meat on this sandwich. It's cut up in very small pieces so the meat tends to fall out of the bread. I would prefer larger piece which would probably resolve that issue. However, like I said, it was tasty. The bread was fresh and toasted, I really liked that. The lettuce was also fresh, not limp or wilted. \n\nI will come back for the pastrami and the chicken pesto. They sell a small and large sandwich. This was my first time there, so I got the small. But you might as well get the large.", "author": "Anthony W."}

It's literally a hole-in-the-wall mom & pop shop. The mom & pop are the ones preparing the sandwiches in their little kitchen while the daughter is ringing up customers at the register. As I mentioned, this place is the size of a shoe box, so after you place your order you pretty much have to wait outside on the sidewalk for them to call your name/number.\n\nMy go-to was always their regular turkey/bacon sub (plenty of deli meats, shredded lettuce, tomato, cheese of your choice, mustard, mayo, on a toasted sweet roll). Never too oily or greasy or inundated with condiments. My sub always hit the spot! You can get a larger sandwich for a few dollars more, but their regular size would always satisfy my appetite.\nNow back when I lived in the hood 4 years ago, they only accepted cash (which was kind of annoying since I only carry a debit card in my wallet). But on my recent visit, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now accept most cards with a minimum $8 purchase.\n\nI know that they also serve Gyros and a few other goodies.

Yelping for a neighborhood gyro place, I found this convenient lunch spot just off of Fillmore Street.  My friend had a veggie gyro (aka wrap) while I had a small Italian sub on a Dutch crunch roll.\nExpecting just a gut filling experience, I was pleasantly surprised  when my smoking hot (temperature wise) sandwich arrived.  Packed with a variety of Italian meats that, of course, included salami, my sammy offered the textural contrast of the melting cheese and crunchy warm bread.  We ate at one of their two indoor tables.  There are also a couple of sidewalk tables for those rare warm sunny San Francisco days.\nA mix of neighborhood locals and work service staff ordered as we ate as it is literally just down the block from CPMC. Love hitting these small local owned businesses, especially when they serve good food.  Let's put it this way; I'm still thinking about that meal and it's been almost two weeks!", "author": "Mike C."}

This place delivered, while not the best and not the worst but the sweet as pie owners were so nice that they get an extra star. Every sandwich was prepared to order so be prepared for a wait but strike up a conversation and the time will fly by. I only wish they had a better chip selection.", "author": "Kim K."}

They make hot subs to order and their ingredients are always super fresh. Their subs never fail to hit the spot :)", "author": "Chelsea M."}

How does a sandwich shop run out of bread? I got the chicken pesto sandwich and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. They toast all the subs so they come out hot and cheese is melted. It was a very simple menu but the sandwich was very tasty. I will definitely be returning here.", "author": "Kelly M."}

Sub was good, like how they cut it with paper, also like sauce, meatballs a tiny rubbery though, good just not incredible. Ordered with my phone and picked up. I like that Asian lady kept saying, 5 minutes ready, that's kinda fast and awesome, and it was ready that quick!", "author": "Mary And Chris H."}

The sandwiches were much more than what we were expecting, especially for the cheap price. Also, the owners were very friendly and treated us as if we were regulars (which a few came in while we were eating). If you're in the Pac Heights area I highly suggest stopping by for a quick bite to eat, its across from the Marc by Marc Jacobs store, which was very convenient ;)", "author": "Ash K."}

I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Queen E."}
