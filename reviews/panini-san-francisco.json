While my panini was being pressed, the girl behind the counter did get out some fresh bread and began (I assume) assembling new sandwiches to replenish the available stock.  \n\nI was impressed that my sandwich (with accompanying side salad) came out to less than $10 with tax and tip included.  Because in sf these days, apparently sandwiches and burritos have decided it's ok to make it into the double digits.  Thankfully, not here.  \n\nI was most impressed though by the taste.

The panini was nice and hot, cheese melted onto the chicken, even though its white meat and im not a fan of white meat, but the PESTO sauce was a great touch where it didnt bother me that it was white meat chicken :) the side salad was good too, not like a cheap type of salad that just tossed into the meal. the dressing for the salad was really good as well. im def. going here for paninis from now on!", "author": "Eva H."}

The secret?  Panini not only uses a Panini grill but they use a convection oven too.  While you have to wait a longer time for your sandwich, the end result is a true delight.  \n\nI had the Tofunini ($7.05).  The bread is soooo good. It's extra crunchy on the outside while still soft on the inside.  I love the lightly grilled medium firm tofu slab - it's truly for those who appreciate the flavor of tofu.  You know who you are - you like plain, uncooked tofu even better than marinated tofu.  The tofu adds a soft, creaminess to the sandwich which works so well with the arugula, red onions and juicy portabello mushrooms.  \n\nI still like the side salad with the delicious balsamic vinaigrette, but it does wilt quickly in the carryout box.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Awesome. :)\n\nI waited a while, and more people came in. I was just hoping that nobody would take that single table!!! Luckily, everyone was getting food to go. So I got my chicken pesto panini and it came with a salad. Mm the salad was pretty damn yummy :). Then I ate my panini. Ooomg!!!

I also don't understand why he informed me that I could sit down while I stood waiting for my sandwich.  So two stars for this guy.\n\nI had the tofunini based on other Yelpers' recommendations, and I was very disappointed.  The bread is delicious, but the tofu is bland.  Very bland.  It's not gross, but I didn't really understand why I was supposed to like it.  Now, the salad that all the paninis come with is awesome.  I would highly recommend the salad, and I think they should make it clearer that all sandwiches come with salad.\n\nThe tables here are too narrow; it's as if there was a sale on oddly shaped tables at Ikea and this place bought out the stock.\n\nI might come back, but I would need a pretty good reason to.", "author": "John S."}

Simple as that.\n\nI had the chicken pesto panini and the bread was seriously the best ever- hot, crispy, toasty.. Yum. My only complaint with the sandwich was that it's supposed to have sundried tomatoes but mine only had 2 puny ones.. I think they could have added more but I didn't want to bother them. \n\nThe blonde girl who took my order was a bit rude though. I told her I was excited to try their food and that it was my first time and her response was,\" cool.\" No \"welcome\" or \"yay\" or you're in for a treat, but just a \"cool\" that came out of her nose. Oh well. Maybe she was having a bad day.\n\nThere's limited seating but you can easily find a nice place to sit on Haight. Great sandwich! Yay.", "author": "Joy A."}

I hang out and eat up and down that block of Haight St. all the time, have been for years. While drinking at my favorite local tavern Trax Bar, I decided to have a sandwich from the new place. I've had about a dozen since.\n\nThe folks are great, the ingredients are good quality, and the sandwiches are not stingy with the stuffing. I've had the Italiano (really good, ask for extra tomato), the Nicole's Panini, and The Brie. All amazingly good. My friends have tried the veg/vegan type options and raved about them as well. \n\nIf you're en route someplace and want to grab a sandwich, consider this place. If you come to belly up to the Pork Store, but can't stomach the line, hit the Panini place instead. \n\nOh, and they have really good coffee--and the little side salad they give you without even telling you the sandwich comes with it is tastier than some mixed green salads I've paid for other places. \n\nI've even heard that if you're drinking at Trax (a few doors down), you can get a menu from behind the bar, call in the order, and they'll bring it to you.", "author": "kelly d."}
