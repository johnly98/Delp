I was with four friends, we ordered all at the same time, miso and edamame to start. Miso came out straight away, edamame never came. I ordered two rolls, everyone else ordered one roll each. 20 minutes later my rolls (and only mine) came out. 15 minutes later, one other roll came out for friend #1. He asked for a beer at that time as well, which never came. Then two rolls came out on the same plate for friend #2 and #3. They were separate orders and not sitting near each other. Friend #4's food didn't come out for 45 minutes. At that point, we told them that it hadn't come and to not worry about it, we figured it's a wash and ask for the bill. Then friend #4's roll comes out 5 minutes later, but no bill. At this time we just wanted to pay and leave. Then the waitress apologized and offered to give us a $3 edamame on the House after we had all finished eating our rolls. Great timing. We said no, paid, and left.

The poke bowl is a delight as a starter. It's super fresh with a clean flavor and the miso soup, though admittedly a tough dish to mess up, was probably the best I had. Also, if you order an entree (I had the teriyaki salmon! Yum!) they give you a pretty good sized portion. So that made me happy.

What I also like was that they didn't skimp on the portion.  I got about 10 pieces, which didn't make me full, especially since I also ordered ahi poke.  Which, btw, was also very good.

I will instead list the areas in which I believe they are leading by example.\n\nFriendly staff (even when they are trying to close)\nExceptional food; I hate when sushi leaves a fishy taste in my mouth, and their fish was very fresh\nFair price point; Sushi tends to be overly priced because it's difficult for some owners to see the profit margin they want to see charging fair prices for sushi rolls, but that's a quick way to scare away potential customers.\nOverall, I was very happy, and I will be returning.", "author": "Brittany A."}

We got seated in the back room that has an interesting sunroof and a small backyard in the back.  There were 2-3 other large parties and the room was quite loud.  It was a bit hard to hear everyone and I was (jokingly but not really) saying to my friends that I was going to deduct 1 star in my Yelp review for acoustics.  If you come here for a quiet date night, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nI always feel a bit strange reviewing restaurants that focus mostly on sushi since I actually don't eat sushi.  I always get entrees at these places.  This time, I tried their duck in a miso vinagrette sauce.  The duck was actually cooked pretty well and the meat was on top of a bed of lettuce.  My only gripe is that by default there is no rice - dude, I'm super Asian, and if I'm ordering a meat dish, there should be rice with it.\n\nThe edamame on the table was actually salted well. I've had my fair share of bland edamame so I'm always glad when I stumble upon salted edamame.  I like salt, so what.\n\nI did try a fried scallop (I think this was the fire cracker ball sushi dish).  The others at the table liked this dish a lot and one of my friend who is a regular claimed this was one of his favorite dishes.  My opinion was oh god this is gross but remember I don't like sushi, so let's just go with my friends' opinions.\n\nThe fried green tea ice cream was okay.

That being said, it's still quiet and feels intimate.  The waiters come around to check in at a nice pace too.\n\nThe sushi was good, but average.  I liked their unique naming systems and we enjoyed our selections greatly, but I've had similar experiences elsewhere.  The Happy Hour prices are excellent though and make having a little sushi tasting party easy!  This is a good place to go if you're a casual sushi fan and are looking for a quiet little place to dine in.", "author": "Leslie D."}

I have no idea how they are still in business. \n\nContrary to many other reviews, the service was good. The food was disgusting.  \n\nThe chicken kaarage was inedible in every sense of the word. It was gross tough chicken parts deep fried. It say boneless meat and in hindsight, I think they would've said breast/thigh/wing meat at the least. \n\nThe salmon tartare with wonton chips was so oddly greasy and you just fill with regret as you're chewing it. \n\nIn no way whatsoever can I recommend the firecracker balls. I was excited to see them come out - they looked good! The inside was revolting. Chewy flavorless gunk was inside of these fried mystery balls. \n\nThe only 'eh' part of the meal were 2 rolls - spicy salmon and spicy tuna. Both were rolled a bit loose but otherwise tasted moderately accurate. They weren't worth the $4 happy hour price if that tells you anything. \n\nOverall, I regret not trusting the Yelp world and can only hope I don't sick from the awful excuse for food I just ate (no I didn't finish a single dish for obvious reasons).", "author": "Nicholas H."}

They have two rooms, one where the bar is and then the big room. \n\nOur food didn't took that long either to arrive (again, it really depends on what time you come). Food is great! I don't eat those hardcore raw sushi but my family does and they seem to always enjoy their food! Everything looks fresh too! I just wish their miso soup is free because some places offer it for free, but here it only comes with certain food that you order.

It didn't help either that I also ate their veggie tempura which was so oily I peeled off the batter. \n\nAs for the sushi, my aunts weren't raving about it.

I feel sorry for the people working here, the service wasn't terrible, but the food was really bad. We got a hamachi maki roll, a salmon maki roll, fried calamari, miso and a hamachi kama. Pretty simple stuff, figured it would be hard to mess up too much. \nThe fish was all around bad. It had an off smell, and especially when I tasted the salmon roll, I could tell it was bad so I sent that back.  The hamachi kama was poorly cooked, it was mealy, and it had a strange smell. Hamachi kama is one of my favorite things, and I couldn't eat it. When I told the server how bad it was, he said they only source top quality fish. It doesn't matter how nice the fish was when you got it if it is improperly stored. I unfortunately ate the hamachi roll, which resulted in having to call in sick to work today with food poisoning.

Be sure to bring lots of change!  \n\nArea:  Nice neighborhood with lots of interesting shops/boutiques within walking distance. (There's a cupcake/cake place across the street that looked really good!)  Near water and Exploratorium.\n\n\nEVAN'S THOUGHTS\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you immediately understand the aesthetics and look the owners of Naked Fish were trying to go for:  a trendy and simple Sushi Bar. The service was fast and cordial, efficient and welcoming something that can be hard to find in small scale sushi bars like these.\n\nThe food was very good.  We ordered an appetizer of Shrimp Tempura Sushi with avocado and cucumber.  The sushi was light and warm, and the shrimp was done well.  Next was the miso soup.  I have been to many Japanese restaurants, but by far this is the best miso soup I have ever had.  For the main course I ordered the chicken teriyaki and the california roll.  Once again another extremely well prepared dish.\n\nBottom Line:  quaint, modern, delicious, good prices, Naked Fish easily gets 4 stars from me.\n\n******************************************************\nMADELEINE'S THOUGHTS\n\nAs soon as we looked at the menu I was sold. Lots of sushi roll/ hand roll (whatever that means) options and plenty of non-raw fish options for the average non-raw fish lovin' American. We split a sushi roll (which contains 5 pieces of sushi) and got the lunch box special which came with an order of rice, miso soup, and two entrees-mackerel and gyozo (japanese fried potstickers) for me. Everything was great but the mackerel. I mean, it was great, until I realized that mackerel has about a million tiny bones in it. Made it very difficult to eat with chopsticks (though I doubt a fork would have helped with the bones). \n\nThe selection of sake (though we did not partake) was large. Seating is not ideal for large groups since most tables seat only 2-3. No dessert options. Booooo (but yay for that cupcakerie across the street!). The entire meal was reasonably priced - the whole meal was $25 for the two of us. All in all - I be comin' back hur.", "author": "Madeleine H."}

Their specialty rolls are delicious, with really interesting and unique combinations of fillings. My favorites are the Marina Angel and the Dragon Roll...with the Veggie Dragon Roll coming in close behind and filled with sweet potato, avocado and other yummy things. Oh, and the 49'ers and the Giants are both amazing as well, and I'm not even a Football fan!\n\nI go here about once a week and always take friends when they're in from out of town. They have a great sushi happy hour with discounted sushi before 6.30pm Mon-Thurs, and before 6pm on Fridays, although they don't have the full menu on the happy hour menu which is a pity, particularly since some of my favorites are not offered during happy hour. I love sitting at the bar cos then you can watch the sushi chefs prepare the sushi and I always meet someone interesting when I'm there on my own.\n\nI took a group of 12 people there for my birthday over the summer and it was perfect for a party. It's never too busy but still has a nice sociable and mature atmosphere, and the service was good. We had a large table through the back and they made sure we were well looked after. It's really easy to share all the sushi if you order lots of different things so it's a perfect location for a group.\n\nThey also have a huge menu of cooked food so even if you're not a sushi fan, there's something for everyone. Beware though, if you're in a group over a certain number of people (not sure how many), they add on 15% service charge. I didn't realize that until I got home and checked my receipt again and then realized I'd paid them another large tip! They were super cool when I called back and they had the double service charge removed with my credit card company.

After searching forever for parking, we finally made our way in and were immediately seated at the bar. Our waitress brought us our waters and offered anything else to drink, but especially after having just exercised, we stuck with our waters.\n\nWe took a look through the menu and after seeing the selection they had, I figured it would be best to stick to their rolls since they didn't offer much else. Maybe I overlooked it, but I didn't even notice any lunch specials. Between the two of us, we ordered four rolls: the spicy tuna roll, the spider roll, the hot mama special (from their specialty rolls section), and the another specialty roll that had a honey sauce on top of it (I forgot what it was called...). \n\nThe spicy tuna came out first, and it looked pretty typical. It had a nice amount of heat to it, though it could have been slightly spicier. Next was the hot mama special. It was a little hard to pick up each piece because the rice kind of stuck the pieces together, but it was really tasty. The salmon had a nice texture to it and the sauce was amazing. Finally, the spider roll came out. It was pretty good, but nothing super special. The last roll came out with a small dollop of honey sauce on each piece. I thought honey would be a weird addition to sushi, but it made it nice and sweet. It was a good contrast to the rest of the sushi piece. \n\nOur waitress was attentive (granted, there were only a few other customers there), refilled our waters as needed and cleared our empty sushi platters.\n\nFor approx. $20/each (including tip/tax), it was a pricey lunch. I likely won't come back just because it was so expensive and while their specialty rolls were really good, I would be fine trying a less expensive place with lunch box options (I like getting the miso soup and salad included in my meals).  However, I'm glad I tried it at least once because they had some unique rolls. This is a good place if you feel like having some really good specialty rolls and don't mind splurging a bit.

Typically their sushi is pretty good. Not great, but definitely above average, and it's conveniently located for me so I order from them a lot. With that said, tonight their take out sushi was really bad. I am a pretty simple guy and we order basically the same thing every time. Teka Maki is very basic. Raw tuna and rice. Usually the tuna quality at Naked Fish is pretty good. Not amazing, but it's consistently pretty good. Today, it was horrendous. They should not have sold the sushi they delivered to me today. The tuna was damn near white (maybe ever so slightly pink), while it's usually a deep red. We ordered 3 orders of Teka Maki and 1 of the orders was ok but the other 2 were flat out embarrassing and inedible so we threw it all out. The Dragon Rolls and California roll was ok though. I won't order from them again simply because anyone who would sell that quality of fish doesn't deserve my business.", "author": "Adam P."}

We were greeted by the chefs and chose to sit at a table in the back. Cute atmosphere, nothing too special but no complaints about the ambiance. \n\nAfter we sat down, a server brought is menus. OK, here's my problem, the menu was one page, double sided with maybe about 8 rolls on it. Whaaat? I know lunch menus are usually smaller but come on, there was hardly anything to choose from! And I was also disappointed since the rolls that were on there all seemed pretty basic...I read the reviews for this place after we left and heard rolls called out (Hot Mama, Autumn..) that weren't on the menu. Kind of a bummer, I wished they hadn't cut out the good rolls just because it was lunch! Unless there was a specials board somewhere that I missed, the menu was a little too small to excite me.\n\nSecond disappointment, I tried to order kampachi and the server said they were out and didn't usually carry it because it wasn't ordered enough. Then take it off the menu?? So then I ordered the aji and got the same response, they were out. Come on guys, the menus small enough and now the stuff I do want on there I can't get? Oh well. I ended up getting the tempura udon and an order of salmon. Boyfriend got toro and two rolls.\n\nOnce the sushi came, we were pretty happy. The rolls were REALLY good (dynamite something and I think sparkle something).  And for the nigiri...YUM! The disappointment from the stuff they were out of left my mind, salmon melted in my mouth and tasted extremely fresh, and toro was excellent!\n\nThe udon on the other hand was bland. I'm used to udon having carrot, cabbage, mushroom, broccoli, etc. in a bowl of big buckwheat noodles. This bowl literally only had seaweed and green onions, and the noodles were a lot thinner than the usual ones I've seen. On the upside the tempura it was served with was good, not too much batter and not too oily. Also, it was served with 4 pieces of deep fried gyoza, which was a nice plus!\n\nThe service was excellent, our server was extremely attentive and was constantly clearing dishes and refilling our tea and water. Our check was brought out on time and she was friendly (a grumpy server can ruin the mood real quick!)\n\nOverall, sushi was good, udon was not. Great service, reasonable prices, and I'll probably be back (at dinner) so I can check out the rest of the rolls people are raving about.", "author": "Nicole B."}

While trying new things can lead to new favorites, it can also lead to restaurants like Naked Fish.\n\nWe showed up around 7:30 p.m. and were automatically seated- which was a perk. We got the table closet to the kitchen, which butt up against a three-paneled full length mirror. Who wouldn't want to watch themselves eat? (Saracasm) This is my pet peeve in restaurants- while mirrors make a place more spacious, full-length mirrors make diners self-conscious. Ugh.\n\nI will tell you right now that I am NOT a Sushi fan. After a first date gone horribly wrong, I can't bring myself to eat the stuff. That being said, the boy thought it was great and would anxiously return for more. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Teriyaki. We also requested an order of Gyoza. When we ordered, we specified to bring the Gyoza first (as an appetizer) and to bring the sushi and chicken at the same time- as these dishes were to be our \"meals.\" \n\nThey brought out the Sushi and the Gyoza at the same time- which spoils a meal when one party has their dinner but the other is still waiting. By the time my dinner did arrive it was COLD. I don't mean stone cold by any means- but certainly not comfortably warm. Certain pieces of the teriyaki were cold to the touch. I kid you not fellow Yelpers.\n\nIf you're going to put down 50+ for a meal- GO ELSEWHERE. Additionally, please tell me how a Japanese restaurant decides that techno music and rapidly changing colored lights \"fit\" this type of restaurant. I simply don't get it. \n\nNeedless to say, there won't be a second visit.", "author": "Annalise F."}

The worst of the bunch this afternoon. We weren't expecting deep fried balls (we were expecting that sort of light ungreasy tempura you sometimes get around the edge, like the beloved Futo Krispy at Moshi Moshi). But these were akin to mozzerella sticks, that gross breaded crust around the edge. And they were drenched in hot sauce, so you couldn't taste anything but that. Texture was mush. So flavorless, greasy, gross... ugh.  ($8) 0/5\n\nSpicy tuna roll: OK, but disappointing. It wasn't spicy, and the tuna was just mushy pulp - just very low quality. I've had way better (both the rolls mixed \"salad\" type tuna and the solid fish). ($5) 2/5\n\nSprinkle roll: Excellent - thank goodness for that!

Well, after walking down the block, we decided to go back to Naked Fish for dinner.\n\nWe were seated in the back and handed our menus.  It's got a dark, low-lit vibe to it.

And being that we've come up with this ritual where we're not allowed to eat at the same restaurant more than once, we've been able to try tako from a multitude of places. Most recently, Naked Fish definitely wins the lead for having the best takos so far.\n\nWe came into Naked Fish during their happy hour. Their deals weren't too shabby. We ordered 4 pieces of tako nigiri which were $1.50 each, fried oysters, fried soft shell crab, the Golden Gate Rainbow and the Autumn Delight. The tako nigiri was definitely my favorite out of all the dishes. This actually was my first time trying tako nigiri, since we usually order tako sashimi, but I absolutely loved the tako in nigiri form. It tasted so fresh and didn't have that Ocean beach salt water fishy dead whale aftertaste. It was light and refreshing, yet sweet and flavorful. The Golden Gate Rainbow was my second favorite dish. It wasn't anything special, just the usual California roll topped with raw fish. I usually try to stay away from the California roll since it's so amateur when eating sushi, but I suppose when raw fish is included in the picture, I tend to let California roll bigones be bigones. As for the fried oysters and fried soft shell crab... mehhh tell me something new. It was the usual fried crispy appetizer filler that you can get at any cheap hole in the wall restaurant and still have it taste exactly the same as it did in Naked Fish. However, the Autumn Delight, now this dish was horrible. I'm starting to think any type of food ending with the word delight is pure crap (eg. Sunny Delight, now that is thee most worst tasting self proclaimed delight of all time... OF ALL TIME!) The Autumn Delight was so bland and the slightly fried tuna and albacore combo tasted like a soggy wet blank every time it hung out in my mouth. Their lemon ponzu only added on to that soggy wet blanket taste since it basically was a watery tasteless sauce infested with unnecessary sesame seeds. And lastly, I hate wasabi, so being that the wasabi mayo was the Autumn Delight's last chance for approval definitely didn't save it from it's failing reputation.\n\nWhatever.

It's ok, but they have room for improvement.\n\nNigiri: quality tends to be decent to good. However, I think last night the regular sushi guy must have had the night off and his apprentice stepped in, because some of our cuts still had fish skin on it when they most clearly should not have. Sometimes the toro is better than others - a month ago it was dreamily great, last night it was a bit tough. I had to wonder if that was just chance, or indicative of a trend.\n\nRolls: Skip the designer rolls. We've had nothing but bad luck with the rolls here - we've tried 3-4 different rolls on three occasions over a few months, and we both agree that rolls are not this place's forte. \n\nService: Varies. I've had great to mediocre service here. Staff has ranged from knowledgeable to first-day-on-the-job. Your mileage may vary. At the moment, there's one *very* cute lady working here, very friendly, very efficient, very helpful. Although I was a bit miffed when she indicated it was \"last call\" at 9pm (it was NYE, after all), then saw a new couple being seated 15 minutes later. Hmmm. It didn't effect us, but I did feel as if I was being a bit rushed out the door so the staff could hit a NYE party. (That's speculation, but it is a vibe that a staffer left with me, a customer, so it counts in a review.) We were given a mini-bottle of Brut on the house, which was a very nice touch, and one we both appreciated a lot. Thanks for that! :)\n\nAtmosphere: It's trendy and comfortable with an ambient/low-key techno vibe. It's clear they're trying to make it nice on a budget. But in the end, I go to a sushi place seeking mind-bending nigiri that makes me cry, not atmosphere.\n\nThe staff is mostly Cantonese-speaking Chinese, so if you're expecting a die-hard authentic Japanese through-and-through sushi place, Naked Fish is not that place. But for a decent local sushi joint, it'll do. It's not as good as the original sushi place that was in this same space in the late '90s - that place was definitely more downscale and lowkey, but it had phenominal sushi.\n\nAt the end of the day, what makes me happy is great sushi and a good price. Everything else is secondary. Naked Fish does alright, but it's not the dream-sushi place I'm still searching for.", "author": "Gregg G."}

We dropped in after the Union Street Festival for something light and relatively low-key, and that is exactly what we got.\n\nDuring happy hour, the fancier rolls (i.e. sunset roll, rainbow rolls, etc.) are 25% off, small rolls (i.e. tuna roll, hamachi roll, etc.) are $3.00 , nigiri  is $1.50, and hand rolls are $2.00. \n\nI don't really have any rolls to recommend, since none really impressed me. The rolls are small, the fish mediocre, and I felt like the rice was not pressed tightly enough when they made the rolls. The sun set strip we ordered, which is a roll consisted of tuna, yellowtail, minced salmon, and avocado wrapped in cucumber with no rice and soaked in vinegar was disappointing. It came with only 4 pieces and one of the pieces was missing avocado, again, demonstrating the sushi chef's lack of focus and precision.  I did, however, enjoy the spicy scallop hand roll, but it was pretty standard and nothing to get excited about either. \n\nThe service here is a bit under par.

The takeout was perfect for an on-the-go lunch. Everything was boxed neatly and nothing spilled in the transport. \n\nNow that the food has settled in my happy tummy, there were slight improvements I would've made.

OMG, $3 bottle of warm sake, $3 maki rolls, $5 appetizers and 25% off house special rolls!!  We had a bottle of sake, fried oysters, spicy salmon maki, spicy tuna maki, and mango tango roll....all of this came to $21!  \n\nThe sake was decent quality..obviously their cheapest but at $3 a bottle Im so not complaining.  The fried oysters were lightly breaded and delicious.  The spicy maki rolls were AMAZING! I love me some spicy rolls and most places use what I call yuppie spice...barely enough to make me flinch.  Their rolls surprisingly (for such a nice hip looking place) were full of spice that lingered in my mouth long after.  The Mango Tango roll was amazing....so fresh and crisp...my mouth is drooling at the thought. Sure the portions weren't massively large...but with sushi it usually isnt.  Plus I glanced over the menu and even without the happy hour discounts they are pretty reasonably priced.  \n\nOverall great service and wonderful food, with so much medicore sushi in the city, I cant wait to go back!", "author": "Seana L."}

Two young (OK, not that young anymore, but its my story) leave their Pac Heights apartment after a long day of work in search of some good sushi. We were looking to get crazy - leave our hood and our usual sushi haunts ! Having not been to Sushi Groove in years, we decided to  head over to Hyde Street for some good fish. 40 minutes of frantic parking-searching later, we gave up and went to  Naked Fish. I figured, hey, we can always get a table, and I really like the Firecracker Balls. \n\n15 minutes later, true to form, we were seated at Naked Fish, and our Firecracker Balls were being brought to our table. Giddy at the the thought of lightly fired spicy tuna ball surrounded by a trio of yummy sauces, the smiles were immediately wiped off our of faces when the plate set in front of us appeared to have - brace yourself - gasp - burnt sushi on it. Yes, you read that right - BURNT sushi. Is it possible? Is it an oxymoron of epic proportions?\n\nUndeterred, we though maybe it had been a while since we had the balls of fire and maybe we had forgetten that they appear charred so we dug in. Nope, those things were burnt. We doused them in sauce and slathered on the wasabi, but nothing could get rid of the deep fried burnt taste. Very disappointing.\n\nWe had ordered a couple other rolls and they soon showed up so we went ahead and ate. The Super Dynamite Roll is pretty good and is the reason Naked Fish gets  one star from me. The other star is for the quick service. The Very Hot Mama is just plain awful - warm bland crab covered with baked salmon and served in tin foil. It was like something out of Betty Crocker's Cookbook, circa 1950. Ouch, I can't believe I just dissed Betty like that, but even she wouldn't try to pass this off as \"sushi\".\n\nTo add insult to injury, our bill showed up listing 7 rolls on it (we had ordered and received 4) but we were so eager to leave that we just paid it and left.", "author": "Megan L."}

Every item which we ordered was served with minimal wait time and the sushi was fresh and yummy. The wait-staff was also courteous and attentive.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the Spicy Fried Calamari.  Fried perfectly with a hint of jalape\u00f1o, I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone that loves calamari.  Although the tartar sauce that accompanied this appetizer was a bit more spicy than expected, I was still content without the sauce when eating it.  Next we had Albacore Tataki.  The flavors of the ponzu sauce, sweet onions & thin slices of tuna meshed so well, it was effortless to eat . The Naked Fish roll came after.  An unagi & avocado rolled topped with yellowtail & tuna and wrapped in soy paper.  The texture of this roll was different than the rolls I ordinarily eat, due to the soy paper.  But all the ingredients combined, worked well together.  \n\nOne of my favorite dishes of the night was the Ankimo (Monkfish foie tossed with salmon roe & tobiko).  These little bit size cylindrical patties of foie melted in my mouth and bursted with great flavor.  Lastly, we had the Tasmanian Salmon Tower.  This dish was perfect in every way.  Baked in honey sauce,  2 slices of salmon patty separated by grilled asparagus.  The salmon was not undercooked nor overcooked.  This dish came out wonderful in both presentation and taste.  The sweetness of the honey sauce and the freshness of the salmon made this dish a delight to eat. \n\nI would highly recommend Naked Fish to anyone that enjoys discovering new creations in Japanese food.", "author": "Vindy C."}

My first visit was for a weeknight happy hour, and my friend was right, it was pretty good!  Drinks, sushi and appetizers were all majorly discounted, and while it's not their complete menu there is certainly enough to keep things interesting.  The sake mojito is enormous!\n\nA few weeks later I came here for a regular dinner (not at happy hour), and we were excited that there wasn't a wait on a Saturday night.  The menu was much more extensive than the happy hour one, and prices were still reasonable.  I had the most amazing roll ever, which of course I can't remember the name of, but this is what it was: no rice, no seaweed, super thinly sliced cucumber wrapped around tuna, hamachi, salmon and avocado.  Four pieces per order, and oh my god it was fantastic!  Next time I am certainly ordering it again!\n\nIf you're coming here on a date or just want some extra privacy while you dine, they have one table that is a little booth behind some heavy velvet curtains.  You can probably call and reserve it, though I'm not positive about that.  A bit odd for a sushi place, but kinda cool nonetheless.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

So their happy hour is from 4-6:30pm, with service being so slow it's good to get there before or by 6pm to make sure you get your orders in. Their beers and hot sake are 50% off. Nigiri $1.50/pc, variety of hot appetizers $4.95, 25% off special rolls. $3 for big Kirin or Sapporo is awesome, comes very chilled!\n\nMy husband and I discovered this place right near our house recently and have gone 1x week to get our sushi fix. This place is 4 stars compared to similar sushi places of its class (just below Zushi)....Zushi Puzzle has better fish for sure and costs more. Naked Fish is more middle of the range but the Nigiri is pretty fresh and it is a closer alternative with more variety than Nippon. Actually, we haven't been to Nippon in a very long time b/c it's not worth driving over there for take out anymore.\n\nAt Naked Fish we typically spend around $40-60 including tax tip. We have about 5-7 pieces of nigiri each (saba, aji, tai, hamachi, kanpachi, scallop and halibut are good,  the walu hawaiian butterfish is hit and miss b/c seems to taste very watered down.) My favorite hot appetizer is the agedashi tofu. The short ribs are yummy but very fatty.  I've tried about 5 different appetizers but I'd rather pass them up and get maki rolls ($3/ea) or a hand roll ($2/ea) instead. My fave maki rolls are the spicy tuna , negi hamachi, vegi futomaki. Spicy scallop handroll is good.  On to the special rolls, I'd recommend: Sub 1000, Crunchy cannon, mango tango but don't go overboard on the mango sauce.\n\nGo enjoy yourself and try to ignore the sometimes strange choice of music..it's always different when we come and once time it was blasted so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation but they figured it out fairly quickly and turned it down.", "author": "Mellie D."}

This can be a bad thing especially since their menu lacks many of the old standbys. All I can say about this is that the Mango Tango was surprisingly bland and the crab meat may have been a little off (maybe do something with blood orange instead of mango) and there were far too many cooked/seared items. \n\nI hope that they change their menu up frequently as I don't think I'd be able to go there more than twice and order strictly sushi without getting bored. \n\nThat aside it was all excellent.

But the food was excellent, I had the dragon roll (shrimp wrapped with eel and avocado) and the seared ahi.  I'm salivating just thinking about it, I want to go back right now....Prices were reasonable, waitress was friendly.

Suckered by the t.v. at the bar, because I wanted to have a light dinner while watching a Phoenix-LA playoff game, I walked in on a whim.  They have a well-positioned flat screen t.v. at the bar and the sushi chef is generous. That's the only two nice things I have to say about this place.\n\nThe bad: the green tea is overwhelmed by a brown rice and soapy flavor, the poke flavoring not only tastes store bought, but all kinds of wrong, the sushi while fresh and cut neatly is fine, but one should expect more from a sushi restaurant in San Francisco.  In fact, before going to Naked Fish, I could always say \"I've never been to a bad sushi restaurant in SF,\" and now I say \"screw you Naked Fish for that making a caveat.\"\n\nLastly, the service was terrible.  The host was glib to the point of insulting, the general attention given by the wait staff (aside from the sushi chef) was inattentive or impolite, and all this annoyed me to the point of not even watching the basketball game.\n\nIf you do go, there are a lot of alternatives, even in the same area: zushi puzzle and ace wasabi for examples. But if you do go, because everywhere else is rightfully busy- stay away from the tea, any specialities i.e. poke, rolls, etc. and stick with your basic sushi standards.", "author": "John L."}

I don't care how fresh the fish may be once it's been smothered in mayo / deep fried it doesn't matter anymore. I'm not a total purest, but one of the things I love about sushi is being able to taste the fresh, clean flavors and the light feeling of the food --- Naked Fish offers no such experience. I went with a group tonight  (we tried a ton of different dishes, so I feel I can fairly judge the food) and I ended up with such an awful stomach ache, that even though I left still hungry --- because I couldn't fathom eating any more after so much grease had been packed into my body --- I am laying here still awake, hungry and in pain now... it's not food poisoning, just too much oil.

Our service was speedy which correlated with the fact that there were about 5 people (2 waitresses, 1 sushi chef) in the restaurant.  We ordered spicy scallop and naked fish rolls.  We also got a spicy, fried tuna roll of the \"firecracker\" variety.  I loved the naked fish roll - the little bit of mint accented the avocado very nicely.  Each roll had 6 pieces, which seemed more generous than other places I've been to.\n\nThe restaurant is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  We sat in the back, which had more natural light.  We lingered after the bill came and the waitress was still kind enough to continue refilling our water glasses.\n\nNot quite a \"go to\" kind of place... but definitely yummy and I'm glad I finally gave this place a chance.

The place is not that hard to find, the new sign is much better than the old black awning that the old owners used to have (check yelp picture). I stepped in to the front door and the ambiance was not that bad. They didn't make any cheesy attempts to fill the place with Japanese decor to falsify authenticity (unlike some places in the city that's so phony but i digress). For starters, the edamame was served and its free (unlike most sushi places in SF that bleed you for everything). On to the food.\n\nFirst off, simple rule of ordering sushi... ask the sushi chef what is fresh or what his specialty is. This has never failed me. I have to say that the fish is pretty fresh (and this comes from a guy who actually fishes and makes his own sushi). The allegations of the fish not being fresh is false. I'm a big fan of beef tataki as well and the chef has prepared it a little differently from what I'm accustomed to but a delicious rendition none the less. I would recommend the Sprinkle Roll or the name sake Naked Fish Roll for people who are open minded to try something different. They served chilled Tradition sake with my meal and it was smooth. The service was top notch. We received our edamame as soon as we sat on the bar. I talked to the sushi chef, introduced myself and I had my order taken right there and then. I didn't really have to wait more than 15 minutes and the bar was full. My overall experience has been great and I would recommend this place to friends who want to try something new.", "author": "Jojo G."}

Couldn't go wrong with this dish, it's like ordering french fries at McDonald's - had to.\nRaw Oysters from Washington - Sad that our server didn't know specifically where the oysters were from nor the name...  Anyways, they were pretty good, nothing special, I added that sauce they provided along with extra tabasco to make it tastier.\nMarinated Ribs - These were cooked on a grill and marinated well.  tasted pretty good and sliced nice and thin.\nSoft Shell Carb Appetizer - This was good but not at all jaw dropping where I wanted to request another one.\n\nSo overall, the food was okay and pleasing.

Usually we like to take an excruciatingly long time to decide where we're going.  Really ups the hunger crank factor, makes for a fun time.  However, with my dad on East Coast time and willing to stay with our sleeping kids, we didn't have time to think - just dashed out, said \"We'll be back soon!\", and didn't look back.  Oh wait, I do remember a going-nowhere discussion about what type of cuisine we were in the mood for while we were walking, and there was some back-tracking during that walk, so I guess we did employ our usual process while deciding where to go.  Yeah, I was really irritated with the poor guy, but I digress...\nWe both loved Naked Fish!  We're definitely used to Midwest sushi, where the fish isn't as fresh, the portions aren't as large, and the prices are higher.  So maybe this is just a typical West Coast sushi place, but we really enjoyed our meal.  It was delicious.  Honestly, we were so tired at the time I can't remember all we ordered.  Edamame, a couple apps, and some maki.  No sashimi or nigiri.  We loved it all, though we did over-order because we're used to smaller portions.", "author": "L T."}

The place is upscale and trendy with a very friendly atmosphere.  The food was good with the one qualification being that the raw sushi seemed a little dry and maybe not as fresh as it could have been.

If my first experience had been when this nit-wit was making the sushi, I might have thought less about this place... but even then, my review would have been one less of a star. \nBut because I have only that to say as far as the negative is concerned, there is a lot of good to add....\nNaked Fish has a dynamic menu full of great rolls and entrees creatively fused to make for an appetizing experience that sets it apart from so many other run-of-the-mill restaurants. Their Flying Philly roll rocks, and their raw fish is good--not too fishy (I don't like eating fish that resonates too much with that of an unkempt female organ, if you know what I mean). Their bento box has never yet been a let down. I like their tempura, it has a hint of sweetness I haven't found elsewhere (except for one other place). The ambiance depends on where you sit... I think the back of the joint is very drab and ordinary compared to the front. But overall it's not bad. The front of the restaurant is fixed with a flat screen, so if you want to watch the game and have your sushi too, it's a safe bet since they usually have it tuned to sports. Or... people watching out the window onto the madness of Chestnut Street on a bustling Sunday can be just as entertaining. Another point that gives this place an unmatched edge to their competition.", "author": "Mike S."}

We recommend the spicy hamachi and sake makis.  Stick to the simple at this place.  Their house special rolls are pricey, and we tried a few and preferred the simple makis.

There is just nothing fantastic about anything here and the food isn't great - that being said, it isn't awful either, hence the 2 stars instead of 1.  It was kind of random, when we got there - the music was fairly mellow and just kind of in the background - I swear at the same time the woman next to us got the smelliest fish dish possible that made us both want to gag, the music got crazy loud and was so kind of trance techno beat.

If you are a sushi purist, you will probably be underwhelmed but the innovative rolls are good once in a while.  The gyoza is very good.  I don't know if they wrap their own but it is better than most Japanese restaurants.  The hamachi kama is outstanding.  Never overcooked and very good dipping sauce although I don't always use it because the fish is so good.  While I love rolls, using 10 different types of fish to make one roll strikes me as just wrong.  The firecracker roll is really good.  A deep fried tuna roll?  Yes, it is very tasty with the hot sauce and mayo sauce drizzled on top.  The snow white roll had to have been invented in heaven.  I would eat there for this roll alone.  The house tempura roll is one of my favorites as well.  It is very simple with tempura prawn and avocado but it is so good.  The regular tempura entree is very good also.  Light batter and crunchy.  If you want something Japanese but a little different, this is a pretty good place.  If you only like nigiri, you will probably be pretty disappointed.", "author": "David S."}

Not the usual three or four items that restaurants usually have for HH, but rather three or four pages.  The firecracker ball is really good....deep fried sushi ball with a spicy sauce....mmmm.", "author": "LT B."}

The only reason we continue to go back is due to their fantastic happy hour specials. The food is definitely good enough that the happy hour makes it worthwhile.", "author": "Eric R."}

The hot mama roll is the best, also their autumn roll is very good! HUGE selcetion of sake (half off during happy hour), service is ok, could be better and a little boring atmposphere too but the food and the prices are well worth it!", "author": "Luba R."}

My wife likes to put ice cubes in her white wine and was using her fork to move them from her water glass into the wine glass and the waiter actually came over with a glass of ice for her!  The sushi is very good and please try the Crunchy Cannon Roll which we get every time and I absolutely love.  Happy hour runs until 6:30pm Mon-Thurs so if you can make it after work the large Sapporo's are only $3 and the rolls are 25% off!", "author": "Rory C."}

The nigiri $1.50 a piece(scallops, spanish makarel, etc) was really fresh and the rolls were good, including the hand rolls.  The large Asahi was only $3.  The beef short ribs were great.  The service was very good. We had our own private booth near the back of the restaurant which was really nice.", "author": "Brian L."}

Ordered the tuna tar tar and what we received was completely different from what the menu described. Asked the chinese sushi chef about it and he replied \"that's how I make it today.\" Waiter was rude, gave dirty looks. We are very laid back easy going people and didn't deserve the attitude at all.  Will never go again.", "author": "Brad W."}

Not only was the hostess who took my order rude, she never once felt it necessary to apologize for the absurd amount of time it took.  A random waiter apologized and said it would just be a few more minutes at the 20 minute mark, then 30 then 40 minutes.  My request for something to be comped fell on deaf ears and after many inquiries to the hostess, she finally responded \"this is how long it takes\" and still no aplogy when I flat out told her not to blame me for their incompetence.  Unless you have 45 minutes to waste for mediocre sushi, don't bother.  I could have driven to Ebisu, had my order filled and gotten back to Pacific Heights in the time it took.", "author": "Rita F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-25", "description": "I had a wonderful experience at Naked Fish last week.  The sushi was phenomenal, and the service was very attentive and friendly, and when the bill came I was very sure that this place is a really good deal.  Our server was really nice and made sure to check on us regularly, and the support staff kept water glasses full.    We really enjoyed the Spicy Tuna roll, California roll, and Sunset Strip.  The fried green tea ice cream was in a class by itself, in my opinion.   The atmosphere is festive and loud, so if you're looking for a really quiet meal this may not be for that occasion.   I had a great time and really enjoyed the food and wine, and it looked like their Sake list was extensive, too.  I'm telling people to go if they like a high-energy staff, vibrant environment, and great food for a reasonable price.", "author": "Derek R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-10", "description": "i'd really rate this 3.5 stars, but since i can't, i'll round down to 3 stars.  the best part about naked fish was the happy hour.  half priced sushi rolls and beer every night from 5:30 - 7.  sushi rolls are a bit small and overpriced for non-happy hour, but it's definitely a great deal during happy hour.  went with a table of 7, had 17 sushi rolls and 10 giant sapporos for $140, including tip.  rolls are fusion-y, one had pesto sauce on top.  definitely worth a trip for happy hour, but would skip it on a regular basis.", "author": "Olivia T."}
