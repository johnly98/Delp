I walked in and ordered a  burrito, nothing complicated, just a simple grilled chicken with black bean and rice burrito. You walk I. And place order at this place. Then you pick a table with your number and they bring out the food in a few minutes. \n\nThe burrito even as simple as mine (you can opt for fancier burrito) taste so good. The salsa they had in it was spicy, yet flavourful and the grilled chicken ( pollo asada)was really good. The size was perfect for me, not too big or small and really hot the spot. I ordered an agua fresca (watermelon) which also taste very fresh and accompanied the burrito perfectly. \n\nService was great and very helpful. Prices were very reasonable as well. Place was clean and peaceful to enjoy your food. Parking is also street meter parking with the 24 Divisadero line stopping at 24th/Castro streets a few doors down from the restaurant.", "author": "Albie E."}

To that end, the salsas are decent but have way too much acid (lime juice). The hot red salsa is probably the best of the bunch, and it goes great with the pastor on nachos or tacos.\n\nI've been here a few times since this place is local. Overall the food is decent and maybe I'd give it 4 stars, but the prices are too expensive. A garlic and shrimp burrito for $16? I know you gotta charge a bit more to make it in SF but, seriously, I can't bring myself to pay that kinda scratch that when the mission is just around the corner. Also there's only beer and wine here, so if you want any hard liquor (i.e. a margarita) you gotta go somewhere else.\n\nIf there's anything redeeming about this place, it's the brunch. The chilaquiles are pretty decent (again, it's all about the salsa) and the breakfast burritos are serviceable. It's definitely a good option for a hangover since the other Mexican spot down the street doesn't open till 12pm.", "author": "Travis V."}

Five bites later, and I still couldn't find any protein. So I opened it up and found out THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE CARNE ASADA!!!!  this place is not worth it!

My order arrived via Forkable a little before 12 noon.\n\nCustom Tostada Salad ($11.95): Our signature salad made with your choice of a menu option, organic mixed greens, black beans, avocados, pico de gallo, queso fresco, cucumbers, mango salsa & roasted bell peppers with a lime-cilantro dressing served on top of a crispy tortilla shell\n*Menu Option: Pollo Asado\n*Add Extras: Carne Asada (+$3.75)\n*Notes: No Beans, No Mango salsa, Extra Pico de gallo, Extra sides of Salsa\n\nI've had this salad before and I really enjoyed it. For some reason, this time, it wasn't as good as I remember. The salad is still a huge portion. Really big and super hefty. Even without the tostada, it's a large size. I liked the meats, but the avocado wasn't creamy and the sides of salsa seemed chunky and dry. I wasn't a huge fan of the dressing, so I didn't really have anything to dress the salad with. It ended up being okay as it didn't really need a dressing due to the pico and the rest of the ingredients. One thing I just don't like about this dish is the cheese. Maybe if it was nice and melty it would have blended better, but it just didn't meld together with the cubes of queso fresco. I ended up picking them out of my salad.\n\nOverall, an all right salad. And who doesn't like a salad with both steak and chicken? (Yes, my inner fattie does!) Still a very filling dish. It just wasn't as good as I remember.", "author": "Elena N."}

It had a great crunch and fresh, vibrant flavors--my only complaint is that the tostada the salad came on was extremely greasy, so I didn't end up eating it. \n\nThe salsa bar here is also amazing--there were at least four different types of salsas, including tomatillo and chipotle, and plenty of fresh pico de gallo!

The highlight of every chilaquiles dish is the excitement that accompanies sticking your fork into a shiny, bulging, golden yolk and watching the fatty flavor balloon burst, dripping ever so delicately down the rest of the dish.

I've known about this restaurant for a while, but was turned off to it because it is \"Mexican inspired\" food, not traditional. But I've embraced fusion restaurants in other forms, so I thought I could give TLC a chance. \n\nThe mister and I tried the pozole rojo and the garlic shrimp burrito. The pozole looked beautiful with crunchy radishes and cabbage piled on top of the soup. It was desperately in need of being more sour and spicy, but I was provided with only one quarter of a lime. I know we're having a lime crisis right now, but I could have used a lemon! Or some other citrus/vinegar source. So I resorted to good ol' Tapatio to increase the spicy/sour level. The shrimp in the burrito was questionably fishy tasting, but I know the shrimp wasn't spoiled, it's just not a taste that I prefer to have in my shrimp. The burrito otherwise was a bit boring. I've had better at La Espiga De Oro or even El Toyonese. \n\nThey do have a really great salsa bar and provide chips with your meal. The chips alone are terribly bland so they definitely need the salsa, which are all fresh and interesting. There are about 5-6 salsa options, plus pickled jalapenos. \n\nOtherwise, the food was pretty so so for me and they do have friendly service. I know TLC is not really about the food necessarily. It's more about the convenience of being in the neighborhood and how kid-friendly this place is. The food isn't bad at all and the ingredients are chosen with care, but I wouldn't return.", "author": "Victoria J."}

My friend recommended coming here since he eats here at least once a week since he lives close by.\n\nChecked out the menu and they have burritos, quesedillas, enchiladas, tostada, and tacos.  Fairly typical menu for a Mexican restaurant.  For all the items, you get to choose a protein, and decided to go with the chili verde chicken, since that's not something I have too often!\n\nFor the burrito, it's not that big, although you can order it in 3 different sizes.  It comes with rice, pico de gallo, salsa, cabbage salad, and the choice of beans.  You can choose from 4 kind of beans, which is pretty great.  I'm not a fan of refried beans so I went for the vegetarian black beans.  Nice little plump black beans that's lightly seasoned!  The chili verde chicken is soft and tender, and goes really well with all the ingredients.  For some reason, the burrito just tasted really... fresh, even though with everything it sounds like it should be a heavy heavy meal!  They probably could've stuffed it a bit more but I guess that's reserved for the super burrito?  The regular burrito was enough for me though.\n\nThere's also a salsa bar with different salsas so for people that love variety, it's a great spot.

I received an email from Door Dash notifying me of a price increase from the restaurant to accommodate my special requests. It wasn't much. No big deal.... I receive my order less than 45 minutes later; yay, fast service! NO. No drink. There were two pint sized CONTAINERS.  One was full, spicy red salsa. The second one was filled to just under halfway with green salsa. No chips, and when paying for the in restaurant gratis salsa there was no indication that you had to ask for chips or even a way to order chips. Enchiladas were BOTH covered in red sauce........

That's not a complaint though; it was pretty delicious.  \n\nThe tab for this (one beer, one burrito, one tostada salad, chips and salsa) rang up at just under $26 (not including my Broke-Ass coupon) which seemed high for a traditional taqueria but just fine for this pleasant, casual, family-friendly eatery.\n\nA nice little find...  if I lived in the neighborhood I'd be here often.", "author": "Tracey A."}

All my friends and family loved the chips, salsa and guacamole bar they setup during cocktails, and the elaborate taco bar and taco salad buffet.

It looks, though, very grim and it smells like old, dirty San Francisco underground caf\u00e9. The place is cold in every way--no heating system working and no feeling of welcoming customers present at all. The place also has extremely low lighting (I wondered what it is that they didn't want me to notice). Their kitchen is visibly super clean, but the rest of the taqueria isn't. Dirty seats and tables (with crumbs of chips all over them) and super dirty floors...and walls (typical of San Francisco, pig town by excellence). Gross! I'm glad I didn't have to go to the restroom there this time.\n\nI was immediately shocked by their limited variety of non-alcoholic bottled drinks. That's a big minus for a Noe Valley taqueria!\n\nAs I busily cleaned my bench and table from all the chip crumbs left by the previous customers, I took a good look at a nasty-looking soup just served to my neighboring eaters. I asked them what it was, and they told me it was a tortilla soup. It looked terrible, like cheap broth with added grilled chicken and tortilla chips thrown in it. Tortilla soup is supposed to be a slow food dish; it actually is considered a fancy dish in Mexico, not a fast food improvised broth with chips! But the person eating it told me it wasn't bad. She seemed to know what she was talking about; I had a chance to briefly chat with her and her friend about food and places to go.\n\nAfter being freaked out by the non-authentic appearance of the tortilla soup, I became quickly aware I was not in a Mexican restaurant but rather in a semi-fancy taqueria. So, in order to test the waters, I ended up having a chicken enchilada with green sauce; it included rice, mini-salad, and pinto beens on the side. I wasn't mesmerized by the texture quality of the enchilada (fast-food preparation is not the right way of making enchiladas) and the chicken had the texture of...average taqueria chicken meat. But I was overall pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of the enchilada flavor, especially its green sauce--surprisingly good and authentic. The side beans were also surprisingly authentic--cooked longer than just one hour, properly and simply seasoned. The rice had a Mexican fonda consistency and flavor (natural tomato seasoned, dry, slightly overcooked red rice), which is still passable.\n\nSo, as far as the enchiladas with side rice and beans go, they do have an authentic Mexican flavor, which truly surprised me. But the level of cleanliness and the super low lighting was like a bad sign, like a very red flag. Should this place be considered fancy just because it serves organic? Does it really serve organic? I'd rather dine non-organic authentic Mexican than organic Mexican cooked for people who can't tell the difference between authentic and non-authentic.\n\nI believe this place should improve its lighting and cleanliness, specialize more on tacos and burritos, and exclude dinner dishes that are, by Mexican tradition, supposed to be prepared with plenty of time and devotion.\n\nI will come back here only if I have to. Today, I had to, because nothing else around was open at 10 pm.", "author": "Raymond F."}

In college, I worked at a place outside of Chicago where the cooks made crazy good tortilla soup. And, there used to be another place, one of the Mi Lindo... restaurants on 24th that is no longer that also had a brilliant tortilla soup-- \n\nSo, finally, I've found my local tortilla soup replacement. The tortilla soup here is rich, meaty with chicken and has a lot of fun surprises like queso fresco, avo chunks, roasted corn, pico de gallo and fresh herbs. However, the main ingredient, tortillas, is the star! Chihuahua's tortilla chips are excellent: light, with a little salt and thin (delgado) with nice crunch. They're better than Papalotes tortilla chips! Sorry Papalote, but for a while now your chips taste stale all the time! \n\nAnyway, tortilla chips are what make tortilla soup. Some recipes for the soup require that you grind corn tortillas into the soup to thicken it but I don't think they do that at Chihuahua. Instead they add corn and give you lots of chips that will sink and soften as you eat. There's also a nice hit of spice somewhere in there. So, five full OLE's for their soup.\n\nI'm also crazy about the Mexican Chocolate Humphrey Slocombe ice cream they carry. It's really spicy! But, in a good, complimenting way.\n\nSometimes there's too much cheese, often there's way too many onion slices in things (can they just cut back, a little?), but otherwise, everything always tastes fresh and the agua frescas are super tasty. \n\nI also like a taqueria with mommy cocktails and beer on tap.

Either way I really appreciate how you had me sitting down for a good 3-5 minutes before you gave me my food that was sitting right there on the counter. Sorry if you don't like short mexican dudes, though I can't help it. \n\nThis is also the 3rd or 4th time in a row I have asked for no guacamole.....and low and behold I get.....guacamole. The only reason I don't make the trek to Taqueria Guadalajara on mission and Onandaga is because its a crucial trek, though I dont get any attitude and I get way better food AND they have lengua!!!", "author": "Mike C."}

After I tried the food, it took the edge off my excitement.  Many of the taste combos lack a flavorful kick -- the burrito fillings in particular.  And give us single girls a break -- I don't always have a pal to share -- why is your specialty plantain burrito only available in the large size?\n\nOn the flip side, agave margaritas are big, cheap, unique, and super-tasty.  Tortilla soup is delicious and with a subtle broth base, lots of veggies, chicken and fresh avocado.  Service is quick and courteous.", "author": "Cathy A."}

I'm not kidding, $23 for a burrito a little larger than my phone with rice and tomatoes in it. Here is the full picture:\n\nMy friend and I walked in at 9:30 hungry and ready to try these \"garlic shrimp burritos\" that everybody on yelp seemed to like so much. The counter lady was nice and took our orders. Since they were going to close soon we decided to have them to go so that we can get out of their way. My friend likes simple (but boring) burritos. She just wanted shrimp, salsa, beans and rice. Simple right? I wanted everything on mine. Simple again right? WRONG. First the guy cooking seemed to be confused by my friend's order, how do I know this? Because I heard him ask the woman at the counter questions in Spanish and then him and another cook laugh at my friend's order. I ignore this because I then hear her correct him on the order, so I think well the cooks are jerks but at least we will get our food right. WRONG my friends, so very wrong. We get our burritos, I thank her and head home. We get home at 9:55 and unwrap our mini burritos. First Bite: Rice(but hey that happens sometimes) Second Bite: Rice Third Bite: Rice and tomatoes. Seriously? My friend opens up her burrito revealing rice and salsa. I'm serious, She paid 11+ bucks for rice and salsa. So I open mine, I have rice, salsa, avocado and about 3 shrimps. That's it.. I was pissed to say the least. How can you serve that to somebody? I felt so bad that I recommended this place to eat at that I knew I had to come here to warn everybody else. On yelp all the pictures and reviews looked so good but what we experienced was far from good. My friend ended up throwing hers away. \n\nSo please, If you are hungry for some true Hispanic food look elsewhere, go to the mission, or go anywhere else for that matter! If you must eat there, please order to eat there, that way you can say something right then and there. Don't go home and be disappointed like I was.

Unfortunately they are so tucked away on 24th Street past Castro you might have missed them. I have never had a bad meal there and the place is well decorated, clean and the employees are friendly and prompt. For Mexican restaurants in this city there needs to be some middle ground in between the low-end shithole taquerias and the fancy-schmancy places. This is one of those places.\n\nThis is really tasty Mexican food at an affordable price in a neighborhood not known for catering to  quick, price-conscious eaters. Although Papalote basically does the same thing (and has incredible chips and salsa) I give this place the nod. Papalote can become very crowded, noisy, messy and over-populated with hipsters.

It was not bad at all! The meat in the burrito was nice and chunky, which I like... and it was tender- making sure that \"Chunky\" doesn't mean something bad. The mexican rice was pretty decent, but it was just mexican rice and I honestly can't decide on what good rice is good. I mean, bad rice is bad, and good rice is good... c'mon now!\n\nOverall, I would come back to this place anytime! Burritos weren't so bad and were pretty filled and chunky (in a good way).

Seriously -- better.\n\nBus your own table?  Not only is it strange to pay north of $10.00 for bad food ... I gotta bus my own table? wha?  Worse -- they actually make it difficult.

Definitely potential for a 4-star rating on a future trip.\n\nCame here for dinner Friday night with high hopes.  I love Mexican food and was hoping that Little Chihuahua could become a nice alternative to prevent me from eating too much Papalote in one week.\n\nIt wasn't bad!  We shared the black bean and plantain burrito, on recommendation from many Yelpers, and the regular nachos.  Both were pretty good.  The burrito was quite creative and unlike any burrito I've tried before.  I love plantains and the burrito created a nice contrast between the sweetness of the plantains and the other spicier Mexican flavors.  I would totally get it again!\n\nService was great and the portion sizes were good as well.  I shared the burrito with my male companion and we were both stuffed afterwards.  We barely touched our nachos because the 1/2 burrito was so filling.  \n\nWhy 3.5 stars, you ask?  There are NO good salsas!  This wouldn't really be an issue if I thought the burrito could stand on its own. While I thought the burrito was quite good, I definitely think it could have used a good salsa.  There were 5 salsas in the salsa bar (I was SO hopeful when I saw a salsa bar!), but alas, not one of the salsas was good.  We kept trying to mix them, but never found a combo or flavor that we liked.  Also, this place is a bit pricey.\n\nThat said, I like that they have different sizes for their burritos (the \"Baby Burrito\") if you don't really feel like having a food baby afterwards.  I'm not sure how big the Baby Burrito is, but I will definitely check that out when I'm not sharing.\n\nThis place has potential and I would try it again to try different items on the menu.

So next time you don't want to wait an hour for a Toast table walk further up the hill on 24th and get a seat here. \n\nThey've just recently added heating lamps for a small outdoor seating area in the back.\n\nEverything is made to order and you can watch the kitchen as they make it.\n\nAfter your full meal take a stroll along 24th street Noe Valley for shopping and a sweet treat.", "author": "Marti P."}

It's catered probably to the locals who live in the walking distance, blandness all around.\n\nGot the carnitas burrito...the carnitas were not crispy, they were mushy. There was absolutely no seasoning in this thing...it was blander than baby food.  Actually, it reminded me of it, the texture and the taste. \n\nHusband ordered some plantain burrito thing and he thought it was gross. We couldn't even finish half of the burrito. \n\nThe salsa had no flavors. Chips were good, but probably because they bought it from an outside source and did not cook it themselves.\n\nGave 2 stars because the staff was polite and the food came out fast. I would never come back here again. If you want real Mexican food, go a few blocks down towards the mission. We should have done that but thought parking would be easier.

I am not sure if the order takers/cashiers are just dumb or super stoned (maybe both) when they come to work.  For example, tonight I was looking forward to one of LC's delicious super burritos for dinner.  I called to place to a take-out order. The chick who answered the phone put me on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up and called back and again this little chick-a-dee put me on hold for another 5 minutes.  I called back and when the little chick-a-dumb asked to put me hold again, I said, \"No, I've been holding for 10 minutes. Would you please take my order?\".  She said, \"sure I can take your order but I need to put you on hold for a minute.\" I hung up and went elsewhere. (Thank goodness LC is not only burrito place in town!) There are multiple other ways the service at LC in Noe Valley disappoints, but hey, it's a burrito place so I am willing to put up with less than intelligent cashiers, but tonight really took the cake (sadly, not the burrito).  \n\nAs to not be too critical without offering suggestions or support, this is for the young lady who answered the phone tonight: if you were too busy in the restaurant to take a phone order, why not just say, \"I am sorry. We are really busy right now and can only help customers in the restaurant. Would you like to try calling back in 30 minutes?\"  Because you did not have the common sense or general curtesy or basic hospitality training to do that, you lost a formerly loyal and regular customers (please see my 3/18/2011 review).  \n\nPossibly your manager will read this and provide you and your fellow order takers with some training on basic customer service.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

I've been living here for almost 11 years and I have yet to find that San Diego/SoCal hole-in-the-wall taco shop flavor that I so crave!  But that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy good Mexican food and there's plenty to be had in the Bay Area.  \n\nTheir carne asada is definitely above average.  All of their meals are made to order so when I asked for a sample and got denied, I was intrigued.  I ordered their regular tacos with the rice/beans combo.  The meat was tender, had lots of flavor and was clearly of higher quality than what you normally find in a small taco shop (I think they use Niman Ranch, if I remember correctly).  Their carnitas are also good, but then carnitas are hard to screw up, much like pizza (it has to be a disaster for me to reject pizza/carnitas).  Their chicken was decent but then I don't get excited about chicken...\n\nThe black beans were really good; not too soupy but not too thick either.   Although if I had to pick one, I'd go with the thicker-style beans.  Their rice was also surprisingly good.  Not many restaurants place an emphasis on rice and maybe you dont need to, but LC's rice was really flavorful.  They have a great salsa bar too with lots of options.\n\nI've tried their Chicken Tortilla Soup but I didn't think it was all that great.  In fact, I probably wouldn't order it again simply because I can easily get a better soup elsewhere.  Unfortunately, the best tortilla soup previously  available (in my opinion) was at Palapas restaurant in the Financial District, but that closed down in 2008 (rest of their food was degrading quickly so not surprised, plus the whole financial crisis).  If you want a good or decent tortilla soup, go to Whole Foods and get theirs BUT, you have to dress it up!  I add a lot of red chili flakes, black pepper, some lime, chopped red onion, shredded extra-sharp cheddar, avocado, good quality tortilla chips (Primavera chips also available at WF, expensive but well worth it!) and of course cilantro.  Without these ingredients, I cannot stand by the soup at Whole Foods as it will taste completely different; rather bland actually.\n\nAnyway, Little Chihuahau has my support for Mexican food.  Made-to-order yet still quick-serve, good quality and all at a good price!", "author": "Giggity Giggity G."}

The employees are very nice and really take the time to make sure your order is right (I hate cilantro, so I really appreciate it when my order is correct).  The only problem is that Little Chihuahua is extremely overpriced.", "author": "Roberta J."}

On 1/21/2014 we had a super pollo burrito and a pollo taco. We also had roasted tomato salsa and chips. Approx. 5 hours later I started to feel extremely nauseous followed by my wife 1 hour later. We both became violently ill and I wouldn't wish that pain on anyone. Undoubtedly, food poisoning due to the simultaneous oncoming of the illness with us both. We also both had flu shots and our two children didn't get sick so it wasn't the flu. I did some digging and found some other yelp reviews about food poisoning at TLC. I sent an email to my companies distro warning them and even had a couple people respond with similar stories about this place. I've eaten food in some shady places all over the world and never once had food poisoning. Whatever these guys are doing they need to clean up their act. If anyone else got sick around this date I encourage you to write SF Dept of public health.", "author": "matt l."}

There are tons to choose from on the menu.\n\nIf you order pollo asado, you don't get grizzly meat, it is wonderful, white meat grilled perfectly. The salsa have tons of flavor.  The guacamole isn't mixed with any other salsa verde or what not to \"water\" it down.\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup is spicy and great as well.\n\nMy boyfriend keeps getting the burritos and won't venture on to anything else because they are too good.\n\nI don't know why this place doesn't have better ratings.

Had the guacamole enchiladas, a new concept to me, and fajita steak enchilada. Not fancy, just very clean, pure flavors, not oily, NOT over cheesy. If you want good quality Mexican (Sonoran) cuisine but in a much healthier, less fatty context, this is the place.  PLUS, they have Pacifico and Negro Modelo ON TAP.", "author": "Nicolas E."}

I ate a chicken burrito this evening and was really impressed by the flavor.  I wanted to eat another. Maybe I was just really hungry, but I usually can't finish an entire burrito. I wish it were a little cheaper too, but I think the price is about right for San Francisco. If you live in the neighborhood, I think you will be quite happy to frequent this place.

My favorite menu items of the moment are the wild mushroom burrito (spinach tortilla + non-vegetarian refried beans) -- either with or without cheese (depends how wild I'm feeling) -- or the carne asada burrito, but everything I've tasted here is delicious. I especially appreciate their call-in and take-out service. The counter folks are fast, polite, and friendly and they always make sure you know which location you are contacting (so you and your burrito may be properly united in carnivorous or non-carnivorous bliss). They keep your order nice and hot while you are en route and they have NEVER messed up an order for me yet! Love them, love them, love them.", "author": "Fromage S."}

Nachos - Even if you're not stoned you will feel that vague sense of munchie relief eating these nachos.
