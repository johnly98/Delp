I had the tomato and cheese pie for $5.50. It was massive, with a good crust (not as crisp as I'd like, but you can't have it all), a generous helping of fresh mozzarella, rich tangy tomato sauce, and fresh chiffonaded basil. Even though this looked like a rather plain pie, it was saucy and gooey and everything you want in a slice. The crust, though it could have been crispier, did have a great bready flavor. I drizzled some of Tony's red pepper olive oil over the top, which added a nice touch. \n\nThe regular cheese slice looked good, but extremely greasy and cheesy-- I wasn't ready for that stomach bomb, and I'd only recommend it to those ready for an extreme cheese experience. But I can wholeheartedly vouch for the  tomato and cheese pie. Great lunch with fast service and a reasonable price point.", "author": "Bhiravi R."}

Since I first stumbled across Arinell's in the mission over 20 years ago, I've sought out new slice joints that can help satisfy my noon-time fix for the world's most perfect food.\n\nSo, when my best friend told me they opened up at NY slice-style joint across the street from this apartment by the ballpark, I was intrigued.  Finally, last week we got the opportunity to check it out on our way to the Lady Gaga concert at PacBell.\n\nIt was about 5:30PM and the line was out the door and down the street - a good sign and a bad sign since we needed to get to the concert (didn't want the girls to miss anything..). What happened next was pretty amazing to me.\n\nFirst, the line just zipped along, even though the place was packed and pies were flying around like frisbees on silver platters. Within about 10 minutes it was our turn to order - and since this was my first visit I opted for the standard of all pizzas - pepperoni (note: in NYC proper, most true pizza lovers would say a cheese slice is the standard, but we have lived in CA for quite some time now so basic toppings are acceptable). We also ordered a salad and drinks.\n\nWell, the fast-serve style of order-at-the-counter-and-we'll-deliver-to-your-table really works in a place like this. We hardly got settled when bada-bam the salad shows up followed by bada-bing the pizza arrives, steaming and with that really inviting pizza aroma... mmmm. taste buds waiting...\n\nIt was REALLY good. Better than a lot of more expensive pies I've had in SF and elsewhere... including Brooklyn. In fact, one of our girls (who had eaten before we left for the concert and swore she wasn't hungry) took one look at that pie and grabbed a slice to scarf down.  The large pie was enough for the six of use, a slice each plus salad and drink, and we were out of there way before Gaga set foot on stage.\n\nAll in all, I can't wait to get back there - and now I understand they have a place inside the ballpark!

There are always 4-6 different pies available for slices, from regular cheese & pepperoni to thick squares of Sicilian and their ever-changing slice of the day.  And if you feel you need to have some \"healthy\" food with your pizza, add a salad with the slices.  Our normal order before a game are 2 slices (one each for my wife & myself) and a salad to share.  Each slice is good enough for one person.\n\nI recommend coming here an hour before game time, so you can sit and relax.  There are 2 TVs that are always tuned in to sports stations.  But if you are in a hurry, get your slices to go and walk them into the game.  The Giants have a very fan-friendly policy that allows guests to take in food from the outside (just no alcohol or drinks in metal or glass containers).  Food here will be a lot cheaper (and tastier) than what you can get inside the stadium.\n\nThe staff is also very friendly and helpful.

I came here with a friend of mine that had visited the area and we chose something close by to where he was staying. The girl at the front was really friendly which is always nice, and the workers extremely helpful.\n\nHe had gotten 3 slices of pizza, and an order of wings. I picked up a panik and grandmas slice. The prices were a little higher than used to but for slice places around the city it seemed like it was on par for the most part. The panik didn't wow me to be honest, but the chicken on it had a good flavor and good consistency. Typically if a place uses chicken I worry it turns out a weeeeeeee bit dry but theirs was fine. I like the crust for the grandma the best out of what I ate though I wish I could've added some other toppings to it. Like roasted garlic, basil, or sauteed wild mushrooms would've brought the flavor a step up. But that's just personal preference. I had one of the wings also, it had some sort of bitter flavor at the end that took away from the taste. Not sure what that was from, could've been some type of korean bbq sauce that was used or it was hoisin based. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'd get grandma's again if I came by although I'm not sure I would spend the price point to customize it entirely.

The pizza came out in less than 10 minutes and it was so good, especially when you've been drinking and hungry all day.

Places that I'd be willing to endure a longer wait for than others (to a certain point, anyways).  However, despite how much that love extends to Tony's Pizza Napoletana, our hunger simply didn't have the patience to wait two and a half hours for a table.  The alternative?  Literally the next best thing, though not the next door location - Tony's Slice House!  \n\nLocated just a few blocks over from the ballpark, Slice House's location is great - clean, plenty of seating (both upstairs and down), and nearby parking (when there isn't a Giants game).  Most importantly though, the food is nearly just as good.  True, the menu isn't nearly as varied, or extensive, as Tony's Pizza Napoletana's, but I doubt there's any pizza restaurant out there that has a menu as awesome and amazing as theirs.\n\n-- ST. GERMAIN WINGS...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-house-san-francisco-3?select=quITzUH7D29meYuNMPtuhA)\nI was worried they were going to taste like generic buffalo wings, but, thankfully, they were better than that.  The sauce added a bit of spice and sweetness, yet it didn't overpower the wings.  Also, while each one was decently meaty, at $10 for six pieces, the dish is a little pricey for wings that are decent, but not amazing.\n\n-- CAESAR SALAD...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-house-san-francisco-3?select=0y8QOS8ecPv2fqK9M5RsSw)\nAlternatively, this starter was much more worthwhile.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh, the dressing had just the right tartness, and the anchovies were delicious (and not drenched in oil).  Funny how pizza joints like Amici's and Slice House do Caesar Salads better than some restaurants.\n\n-- SWEETIE PIE - White Pie, Prosciutto, Arugula, Mozzarella, Formage Blanc, Sweety Drops, Parmigiano...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-house-san-francisco-3?select=LD56rp1mONR3t1u3oYbkZQ)\nThey're so generous with the toppings!  Especially with the prosciutto and arugula, though perhaps a little heavy on the latter for some (I liked it).  I liked how they didn't skimp on the cheese either, and the white sauce was pretty flavorful.  The crust was a little thick, but it was fine, seeing as how it's Tony's/Slice House does really well with all of their pies.\n\n-- THE WISEGUY - Tomato Sauce, House Made Italian Sausage, Calabrese Link Sausage, Ricotta, Hot Pepper Oil, Natural Case Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Green Onion...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-house-san-francisco-3?select=GjQr6XQcWZBAQLP2PmZqrQ)\nOf the two we had, this was my clear favorite.  I'm not super high on red sauces, but this one was good.  It helped that the pizza was so meaty and I really liked how juicy the sausages were.  I thought the ricotta would be a little too heavy, but it blended well with the rest of the flavors, especially with the hot pepper oil!\n\nAs far as service goes, it was clear the staff was undermanned when we dropped in for dinner (several tables uncleared, lack of clean utensils at stations), but you could tell they were doing their best while maintaining a friendly demeanor.  Beyond that, the only other semi-downer was how the menu doesn't include Tony's famed Margherita pizza.  For that, I guess I'll just have to wait.\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded up.

He is also the first and only American to date to win the World Champion Pizza Maker at the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy, where he was the first non-Neapolitan to achieve such glory. Since then, he's opened up a lot of popular and successful pizza joints in North Beach and all over San Francisco, Sacramento and Las Vegas. He's also got one joint inside AT&T Park for all you Giants fans. I'm sure Timmy would love that joint after hitting the peace pipe. \n\nAfter attending a meeting at the ballpark, we were walking back to work and we were all getting hungry. We were undecided on where to go at first until we stumbled in front of this place. You can't go wrong with pizza so that three of us all walked in and started perusing the menu. You can get a slice or the whole pie or pan as they describe it ranging from Classic American, Italian, Sicilian and Neapolitan. They also have meatballs, chicken wings, garlic bread, salad, paninis and pasta to choose from. We also each chose a slice (or two) of our own and a plate of meatballs to share with the group. \n\nSeating is self-service so you can choose your own table and make sure to grab the utensils and some water at the station. Our pizzas arrived in a jiff and thank goodness since we were starving. I ordered the Grandma and it was a perfect name as it was like comfort food. These are not thin-sliced pizzas as the dough is fairly thick, but it's very light and fluffy. You can tell the sauce is made from fresh tomatoes and not from a can based on the texture and wonderful flavor. And the ingredients are portioned evenly giving it a good balance from dough to sauce to fillings. The meatballs were delicious and seasoned well. It was moist, meaty and manly. \n\nIt's another good addition to the neighborhood (no surprises here) as it's reasonably priced and they even have a Sunday Brunch special.

Before I delve into how the pizza itself was, let me break down some facts about this place:\n\n* You can either wait in line and get your orders to-go or you can eat-in by sitting at one of their tables.  (They have seating both upstairs and downstairs.).  Regardless, you need to first get in line, place your order and pay.\n* Don't think that it's just a place that serves only pizza, based upon its name.  Their menu is quite extensive with Italian fare -- they have pasta, antipasti, salads, focaccina (panini sandwiches), garlic bread, meatballs, Italian desserts (i.e. tiramisu, spumoni, etc) and more.\n* Furthermore, in addition to traditional pizzas (i.e. cheese and pepperoni), they make pan pies, speciality pizzas with a number of fancy ingredients and artisan pizzas too.\n* Drink wise, they have coffee, soda and water.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Despite the line, transactions were quick and I was in and out in ten minutes.\n+ Aside from ordering a slice of cheese, I also wanted garlic bread.  However, the cashier informed me that due to the power outage from the previous day, they had been unable to bake any in time for the lunch rush.  She was very apologetic about it and I understood as my office building nearby experienced the same power outage.\n+ Despite the price, you definitely get your money's worth.  The slices here are HUGE.  And they've been very tasty too.\n\nCons:\n\n- The only negative was that the slice I ordered was swimming in grease.  Yes, I know that pizza is known for being greasy.  But I had to pretty much blot the pizza with several paper towels to remove the excess grease.  I don't have a problem with greasy food, but I tend to get an upset stomach whenever I eat something that's overly greasy.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed.  I'm sure I'll be back soon.\n\n4 stars", "author": "Michael F."}

Beautiful crust, beautiful sauce, and beautiful toppings. Beautiful tiramisu, too.\n\nThat being said, the reason I'm not giving this place more than three stars is because the last few times I've come in, my pizzas have been undercooked. Like, between the sauce and the bottom of the crust is a layer of half-cooked, slimy dough that I can scrape off with a fork.\n\nThis kills the structural integrity of the crust and makes the pizza taste worse. And considering that a slightly overcooked pizza usually tastes better than a slightly undercooked one, this says to me that the place is becoming more concerned with quickly pushing out pies than it is with delivering a consistently excellent product.\n\nA disappointing and fatal rookie mistake in an otherwise masterfully executed pizzeria.\n\nFront-of-house staff here has always been mildly unfriendly, but this place used to be so good you wouldn't even care. Used to be.", "author": "Oliver K."}

The pizza here is a great, about the closest to a NY slice I've had.  But it's just not the same popping in sober during lunch or before a baseball game.  This food would taste even better as the last stop between a night out and my bed.\n\nCheese Slice: Having lived in Manhattan for 6.5 years, I really miss those casual and quick slices.  No toppings, no folding, just a firm bottom crust (that doesn't flop down) and parmesan cheese, red pepper fakes, oregano and garlic salt on top.  Most pizza by the slice is pretty bad in San Francisco.  Besides Tony's, Arinell is the only tolerable one out there.  At Slice House, it's almost like being back in NYC.  The crust is a little fluffier and they're a little more generous with cheese, but the sauce is spot on and the bottom of the crust is nice and firm from the oven reheating.  No garlic salt in sight unfortunately.  They pre-sprinkle on the parmesan cheese and oregano, which could be an issue for some, but is fine by me.\n\nGrandma Slice: Golden Boy is a tad better for Sicilian-style square slices.  But this was tasty.  Loved the fresh mozzarella and ample portion of sauce.  Tasty,  but probably better to save your limited stomach space for more NY-style slices.\n \nMeatballs: These are pretty awesome.  Order a Cheese Slice and a side of 3 Meatballs and you have a hearty meal for $10 (...a rarity in SF).  There is so much nice red sauce in the bowl that your pizza crust can become a bread stick with tons of sauce leftover for your meatballs.  The meatballs themselves taste meaty (i.e. not much filler) and firm, but not too firm.", "author": "Adam B."}

On Friday, July 17th after 2pm, I walked the 2+ miles roundtrip for some pizza!\n\n*Pepperoni ($5.25)\n*Tomato pie with cheese & basil ($5.50)\n\nThis totally hit the spot! Both slices had the wonderful chew I love about Tony's pizza. The pepperoni fulfilled the carnivore in me with it's delicious meaty flavor. I adore cheese and basil, so that slice provided a great contrast to the pepperoni slice. I was in heaven! Plus, these slices are fairly large, so I had half of both for lunch and the remaining halves for dinner.\n\nThank you Tony's for fulfilling my pizza craving.

The Grandma slice was killer and reminded me of the slices I'd get by my college in NY, only better. The slices were big and hearty, and the sauce on them was zesty and flavored wonderfully. One of the weak spots I've found in California pizza in general is that the sauce often tastes just of tomato paste.

Ingredients seem fresh and slices are generous in size - essentially getting two normal slices, which explains the higher pricing as well. Open relatively late and popular hangout during local games (Giants, Warriors) with lots of TVs to watch. Upstairs is quieter and nice - usually pretty empty during the day.

I finally got to check out Tony Gemignani's pizza, and I wasn't disappointed. We came in as a gigantic group a quarter past noon on a Wednesday before the Giants afternoon game, and they weren't super busy at the time, although there was a fair amount of people coming in and out during our order. Since I was expensing the meal, we had a 20+ person order and the staff was fantastic and really accommodating. We were able to order and get our food in 20 minutes or so, which is impressive. I was sad that the variety they have available for purchase by slice is very limited (only Cheese, Pepperoni, and Tomato Pie w/Cheese & Basil for the traditional crust, and the Silician and Grandma on the focaccia bread). I tried:\n\n-Cheese Slice ($5, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-RcFX1StRVh2qHxiX4EWRQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This was a very solid cheese pizza, and I loved that the crust on the middle part of the pizza wasn't soggy and just collapsed when you picked up the slice. The cheese had just the right amount of grease on it, which gave it flavor but didn't make it too oily. Recommended!\n-Tomato Pie w/Cheese & Basil ($5.50): Also very solid, although I always wish there was more fresh mozzarella on this type of pizza. However, I liked the sweetness of the tomato sauce. Recommended.\n\nI will definitely have to come back and try some of their combination pizzas, such as the Cal Italia, which won the Gold Medal on the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge, and the Pigman, since it sounds delicious. They also have a decent (although small) selection of beers on tap, but they also have a variety of bottled beer as well.

While Tony's offers great pizza, slice house is a great option for a quick bite before a game. The options are fairly pricy. I went with the Cal Italia which featured prosciutto and multiple cheeses. The dough is probably the best part of the pizza, especially when fresh. Both doughy and crunchy, the toppings never fell off and provided great stability to the pie. \n\nMy only concern with slice house is the price of a full pie. A large pepperoni pizza was nearly $40.

Yeah probably but it's not like he's sold out and become a Food Network whore like Guy Fieri whose most current culinary connection is the excessive amount of carbs he can stuff in his ample mouth. Like many in our fair city, I became a fan when he opened his first San Francisco place, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, back in 2009. That's when my friend Maggie organized a birthday f\u00eate for me, and we tried a number of different pies including my eventual favorite, the Cal Italia with four Italian cheeses, prosciutto, a Croatian sweet fig preserve and a liberal drizzle of a balsamic reduction. Fantastico and then Jamie W. and I recently tried Tony's other North Beach Capo's for the first time.\n\nFantastico seconda parte. And then we found out Tony was taking over the former Ironside space on 2nd which thrilled us since he's now in our 'hood. This may be his third San Francisco operation, but he has since expanded his pizza empire from here to Vegas. Fantastico terza parte? Jamie and I decided to give it a try this past Friday and were surprised to find it nearly empty at about 6PM since there's plenty of beer on tap (photo: http://bit.ly/1byJErQ). I got here a bit earlier than Jamie, so you'll probably never guess what pizza I ordered for the two of us. The Cal Italia, of course (photo: http://bit.ly/1PQiKek). The ingredients were the same, but the crust was different. He bills it as \"Ancient Grain Pizza\" which represents a blend of Tony's double-zero flour, spelt, semolina, sprouted grain & whole wheat.\n\nThe result was probably healthier than the original but not quite as satisfying because of the chewier texture. You would think that would be enough for two mean with healthy appetites, but we were mindful of the name of the place, Slice House. With that in mind, I ordered a $6 square of the Sweet Grandma's Pizza, a Sicilian-style creation of which they make a limited number daily. It's really more a thick foccacia-like loaf with a sauce made of sweet, vine-ripened tomatoes ladled on top with mozzarella, garlic, oregano and pecorino (photo: http://bit.ly/1JwYGNf). While I appreciated the freshness of the ingredients, the breadiness overwhelmed me somewhat, so much so that for the first time, I could not finish a slice of Tony's pizza.\n\nJamie liked his $5.25 slice of the Pepperoni, and the slice was frankly enough for two with an abundance of meat (photo: http://bit.ly/1GCBVXt). My one complaint was the amount of grease that accumulated on the cheese probably because it spent some time saturating in the display case. Even with the focus on pizza, there were plenty of other items on the menu - salads, a couple of pasta specialties, paninis and apparently a meatball sub to die for according to the server who was pushing it hard. I have no doubt that Tony will bring 'em in again although I hope he doesn't go into a franchise zone with his award-winning pizzas. Not worried yet, but I'll be back to monitor it. After all, someone has to make sure of the quality on a regular basis, right?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...Tony is a pizza artist but some of the North Beach pizzazz seems missing here\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...good use of the loft-like setting Ironside struggled with\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...cordial enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a slice of Tony's is worth a pound of cure...or somethin' like that, goombah", "author": "Ed U."}

I understand their gluten free pizzas are cross contaminated. They have a warning on their menu explaining that. Ok.\n\nSo, a month ago, I went there for lunch with some coworkers, thinking I'd try their GF pizza. You can't get it by the slice. Bummer, but understandable. So I ordered a 12\" gluten free pizza, thinking it'd be about enough for 1.5 meals. \"That'll be $32.95,\" said the cashier once he'd rung me up. WTF?! An individual-sized pizza should only be $15-20, even if it's gluten free! I am not paying more than $30 for lunch. I canceled my order and walked out.\n\nThen today a team at my office ordered pizzas from them. One of the people on the team is also gluten free, so he offered to share the GF pizza they'd gotten for him. (The order was: Popeye: White Pie, spinach, garlic, ricotta, mozzarella, and red pepper. 13\" Gluten Free.) I was impressed by how puffy the crust was. Most gluten free pizzas are flat and crispy. As I was eating a slice, I thought, wow, this is incredibly good. The more I ate and the more I looked at the crust the more skeptical I became that it was actually gluten free. So I did a google image search for Slice House gluten free and found a picture of their gluten free pizza. Sure enough, it bore the characteristics of your typical gluten free pizza: flat and crispy. Not anything like this \"gluten free\" pizza we'd been delivered.\n\nAn hour later I started feeling the effects. Guys, this is not a minor gluten exposure. For a celiac, eating an entire slice of REAL pizza is horribly damaging. Fortunately I seem to be spared the more painful effects most celiacs encounter, but still had to cancel my evening plans and hunker down. I'm planning to be under the weather for the next few days and it'll be at least a couple of weeks before I'm back to normal.\n\nHere's the thing: If you're going to offer a gluten free option, you have to be on top of that shit. It's great that they have a disclaimer about cross contamination. But their staff needs to be really attentive to when a GF pizza has been ordered. It's serious. People become debilitated by eating a thing they think is GF when it's actually the MOST gluteny thing out there. (Pizza flour has extra gluten, FYI.)\n\nAlso? Your gluten free option shouldn't cost 3x what the regular option costs. That's just obscene.\n\nIn conclusion, DO NOT go here if you're avoiding gluten. They absolutely fail.", "author": "Heather H."}

We arrived at 620 and got our pizza at 745. It started with the cashier there was a long line yes but when I got there he had no personality and seemed glue less after I asked about certain sliced pizzas. The ones I chose he indicated that he cannot offer because they ran out of the dough for that type of pizza. This is a Friday night before a Giants game which is down the street. Next I finally ordered a whole pie was given a number and we sat viable to all as waiters kept passing by us. Initially the cashier said that the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes. Once we hit 30 minutes I asked for assistance. At first the waiter came up and said the Pie would be out in five.  four other times I asked for the manager. He eventually came up at 45 minutes to say that the Our meal would be comped but the pie still did not come and he never came up with th credit. We finally was ready to walk out I went to get the credit and then after I got the credit they delivered the pizza to our table but still nice I got the credit the waiter was ready to take our pizza away because we got the credit.  the pizza ended up under cooked and frankly no where near the standards of Tony.\n\nIt was clear that this restaurant has major service issues and management needs to get on it right away.", "author": "Hans H."}

I'm a sucker for their margherita pizza, but that always comes with the wait.  Instead, we went with The Wiseguy pizza and Mostaccioli ala Vodka Cream for dinner.  Two very hungry adults took down The Wiseguy pizza, and an overly hungry one person took down the mostaccioli.  All in all, it was gluttony at its finest that night, and I have zero regrets when it comes down to chomped down on half a pizza.  The Wiseguy comes with some spicy sausage, hot pepper oil, and it's topped with little bursts of mozzarella.  About midway through, that mozzarella came in handy when the spicy sausage got to being a little too much for me.

I was excited to try this outpost from Tony, given the location and the fact that you don't have to endure the ridiculous wait times. \n\nI stopped by for lunch today and grabbed a tomato pie slice. It was incredibly greasy. I'm not one who typically shies from grease or dabs the slice with a napkin. But this slice was an oil slick, such that I had to eat it with a knife and fork. The crust was a tad too thick and tasteless. The whole thing had a slightly burned taste; not from a nice char...more like the cheese had been reheated a few too many times or the oil was rancid. Something was just off. This was nowhere near as respectable as what I've had at Tony's and certainly nothing like the real deal on the East Coast.  \n\nTo top it all off, a slice and a Coke set me back $9 before tip (I mean, the Coke alone was a ridiculous $3).

My husband and I each ordered a slice of pepperoni, and I also got a slice of the tomato pie. We took our seats, and about 5 minutes later were handed our slices.

Large slices for about $6. Was going to try the pasta but - strangely - the pasta is only available after 3:30 pm !  We think it would be a good lunch option, not sure why the time limit on it. The 13 inch is $24 and offers nine styles. We opted for the Genoa - pesto, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, castelvetrano olives, feta and roasted garlic cloves. It was delicious and just the right portions of all toppings, especially the pesto which we loved.  Also had a classic Caesar salad (with anchovies!) and the artichoke pasta salad - both were good sized and excellent taste. The place itself is of nice ambience - wood interior and cozy feeling, with TVs and a second floor seating area as well. Very busy at lunch, mainly take-out service and it was easy to get a table. No table service (except food delivery) so be sure to order at counter before claiming a seat.

Whether it's on a meatball or on a pizza, it's absolutely delicious. I also really like their pizza crust, but then again, I'm a crust lover. You're more likely to find pizza remains whose crusts have vanished on my plate when I leave.\n\nNew brunch buffet:\nMy husband and I stopped by this morning and saw they had their new brunch buffet open. They had a bit of everything - breakfast pizzas, frittata, lasagna, spaghetti, meatballs, and then breakfast favorites like eggs, potatoes, and bacon. In general, it was delicious. Their lasagna was delicious (have I mentioned how much I like their sauce?) and their custard french toast was pretty killer. Actually, it was a bit more like bread pudding made from french toast, which is totally ok with me. All in all, a delicious experience.\n\nOne piece of feedback for Slice House is that their brunch serving sizes are a bit too big. Their breakfast pizza slices and frittata are the size of a normal slice. Considering one of those slices can be basically a meal, it was hard to try everything I wanted to try. I'd love to see them do much smaller portion sizes for a buffet so people can sample smaller bits of more things (without preventing people who want to go all-in from doing so).", "author": "Erin B."}

The only drawback, according to the dinner menu, is that you cannot get all the specialty pizza's that I  love at Tony's Neopolitina. The reason why I did not give this location Five Stars as I do the original location, is attributed to that on Giants game day their menu becomes very limited.  So  this little fact was not known to me or well publicized.  Not knowing this fact, I walked to Slices for two  whole pizzas as take out. I was only able to choose whole pies from what slices they were serving (pepperoni, cheese, grandma, and Sicilian). So if you want more of a selection  check to see if the Giants are in town.  Even though it was limited the guys made a fresh whole Grandma and Pepperoni pizzas for my take out.  For two whole pizzas expect to shell out over $75.00", "author": "Robert J."}

There is no way to tell when this place is actually open without calling.  Yelp! posted hours of operation are way off.  Saturday they don't open until 3.  Sunday sometimes they close at 3.  They are also \"subject to game day changes\".", "author": "Michael S."}
