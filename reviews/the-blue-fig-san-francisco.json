It wasn't until I passed by in the daytime that I saw it in operation. Only one woman runs the entire cafe, and I was honestly feeling sorry for her because she was looking understandably a bit exhausted by 2:30PM when I showed up. Now I had no idea that the signature dish was the $9.75 Blue Waffle made of organic blue cornmeal topped with fresh fruit and ladled with a fig reduction. The cafe's name must come from this colorful creation.\n\nHowever, for me, I didn't want to be so calorifically suicidal and went for the $7.75 Greek Yogurt which normally comes with their housemade granola. At that hour unfortunately, she was out of the granola and consequently gave me a double helping of the yogurt along with a drizzle of honey and fresh strawberries, blueberries, and banana slices (photo: http://bit.ly/2xh1o8Y). Surprisingly I didn't miss the crunch of the granola, though it was more yogurt than I could digest in one sitting. The $2.75 Cafe au Lait was the perfect accompaniment (photo: http://bit.ly/2QyctKV). Still I do need to return for that blue waffle, don't I?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...fresh yogurt served like an ice cream sundae\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...cozy space with a parklet in front and a patio in the back\nSERVICE - 4 stars...one woman does it all...so what's new?\nTOTAL - 4 stars...visions of blue waffles dance in my head\n\nRELATED - Looking for other dining options in the Mission?

Any sympathy we had quickly evaporated because the guy's service was abysmal. We sat in the back patio and when our \"French toast\" arrived, our request for another plate and utensils was met with a hostile \"I've got other customers.\"\n\nBaked French Toast: Absolutely hideous, and a lie. Because it wasn't made with an egg, biting it was like shoveling sand into my mouth. Although the menu says the baked French toast is made with brioche, we were given cinnamon raisin bread. When we pointed out the error, the worker insisted that it was brioche. How stupid does this rude person think we are?\n\nAlthough the patio itself was nice, my friend and I abandoned the plate and hightailed it out of the darkness. I hope that guy is no longer employed because it's best to not pay someone to sabotage your business.", "author": "Chad S."}

I also ordered a chicken empanada that was delicious and truly hit the spot. It was a good snack for me while I did work and waited to eventually get dinner. I didn't get a chance to try their Greek yogurt with fruit dish but my friend ordered it and seemed to be pleased. Next time I'm in the mix I'll definitely order that. \n\nOne of my favorite things about this location was that they had a grand window that allowed natural light in as well as allowing me to distract myself by people watching. There's also a nice patio in the back to relax in but it was a chilly day so I passed and stayed inside. \n\nThe service was excellent, the lady taking my order was patient and nice when taking my order. Even though I stood there for a while trying to figure what to order (fear not, no one was behind me so I didn't ruin anyone's day). \n\nI would definitely recommend checking this location out.

Sure, there's something definitively quaint about sitting down at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in Paris and leisurely eating a croque madame, but trendy restaurants in the Mission also have their own charm! Cash-only policies that will have your friend awkwardly asking, \"Hey, uh, can I Venmo you for this...?\" when you're ordering! Overworked employees in the ridiculously small kitchen! Aesthetically pleasing back patio seating to distract you from the long wait!\n\nI'm still mindblown by the heavenly combination of b\u00e9chamel sauce and Gruy\u00e8re cheese, both of which created a rich array of flavors instead of overpowering each other.

I got the most popular item - a ham & egg sandwich on foccacia bread with aioli (I got it without cheese since I don't eat cheese). They are cash only, and make everything to order, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you are in a rush.\n\nI sat in the back patio since it was a nice day outside to work and wait for my food (I am a sucker for patios if it's sunny outside). I was pretty hungry, and had gotten an acai bowl across the street at my favorite acai bowl place (Sidewalk Juice), so I ended up eating half of that first while I was waiting lol. My food came in about 20 minutes, and there were about 5 other people outside on the patio with me. The sandwich was really good! Mainly because of the toasted bread and the aioli, which had a fresh herby flavor to it. Would come back to chill on a sunny day.", "author": "Betty M."}

It was essentially toasted bread sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and the other toppings advertised. \n\nThe service was a train wreck. Came through on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. One other party of 2 in the backyard, and a small group of 2-3 behind us. When the food was delivered to us, we asked for an additional plate as well as silverware since none were put out in the communal area where you'd normally grab them from. Was met with a flippant \"I've got other customers\" before the staff person walked away from us. Hire more people to work busy shifts & even in a short staffed situation, don't talk to your patrons like that!\n\nI was with a friend visiting from out of town and it was straight up embarrassing to bring him here with the rudeness.

I could see through the front window of the Blue Fig that a woman was being served what looked like a very nice croque madame. There were several tables free out front on the sidewalk, and the weather was lovely, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered before I saw that a few Yelp reviews mentioned slow service. The woman who took my order was the owner, and she was just the nicest person, from Mongolia. In truth, I was a little nervous because her English was not great, and I wondered how much practice a person gets in Mongolia to perfect a French croque madame. Any worries I had dissolved when my food arrived. It was absolutely delicious--bread perfectly toasted, smoky ham, melted cheese, whole-grain mustard, creamy bechamel, a soft fried egg, and some dribbles of basil oil that added just the right touch. It was filling but not heavy, and so good that I seriously thought of coming back later for another one. Like, for real. Maybe her service is slow at busy times, since it's just her there. So, go at an off hour and get yourself a truly delicious croque madame. Hey, you'd be supporting a business that is woman-owned, immigrant-owned, and also has yummy food. Not bad, right?", "author": "alex a."}

Instead of making my food right away, they prioritized refilling the silverware and other menial tasks that could've waited.  \n\nI went there last week and with only 1 customer in front of me, it took 20 minutes to make a 5 minute meal.

This cafe is a classic SF cafe, before Blue Bottle, Ritual, and Sight Glass came along and turned coffee into some wine tasting. They serve regular strong coffee. The cashiers, waitresses, and baristas are all classic-SF ladies: a few regrettable tattoos, they are poets or musicians or painters, smart, empowered, worldly, who don't shave their armpits, but are perhaps attracted to cruel emotionally unavailable men. Imagine Joan Didion without all the money she has, with a touch of Daria seen through the lens of The River's Edge. One slight problem before you think this place is a godsend: the ladies, being Joan Didion/Daria-types, are a bit 'frazzled' and it takes on the long side to get your order. And sometimes the order is wrong. And sometimes they have attitude. But this is America, and the free market tells the stories of winners, and I give my money to The Blue Fig. And who cares about details when the you're having a decent cup of medium roasted coffee in a back patio that reeks of an SF experience, like last weekend I was reading Book 2 of My Struggle and two couples sat at the table next to me, talking about some air mattress, on which, it was heavily implied, one of the couples slept. They were all attractive, their lids tugged downward in post-orgasmic lethargy, and so I imagined their art of rugged coitus as I toyed with a 50 euro cent that I had found under the table. I was brought a sandwich I didn't recall ordering, and told the silverware was in the front. I traced her retreat by looking at her buttocks, breathing in a faint waft of basil from my sandwich, which I conflated with her feminine funk. A pigeon came by, which I half-heartedly tried to kick, knowing I would fail. Seeing through me, as if gleaning my depression, it became fearless in my vicinity. It's tiny black eyes betrayed contempt. Seeing this hurt me. If you like it real, a place that feels like it has no time for consultants or therapy, come to The Blue Fig.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

The point is the space is versatile. \n\nAbout the food: the food is pricey but I was pleasantly surprised because it is good. I think maybe I went in with the expectation of it being just a coffee shop but it wound up having a nicer restaurant feel so to speak. The almond croissant is impeccable as is the Ruben. The Ruben comes with a salad and unfortunately we found a dead Rolly Polly (cute little insect) in ours. Not a deal breaker they have an excellent health rating and hey, it's certainly organic. \n\nAbout the service: I'm from the East Coast and have noticed that in particular coffee shops have poor service. There was a young man there that day who looked like he could care less about what we ordered or when we ordered it. Restaurants grossly underestimate service, customer loyalty and word of mouth here. A lot of times even if your food isn't the best if your customer service kicks ass, I'm in. I was so turned off by the lack of service that I'm not sure I would go back. I wonder what folks are asked in the interview process here. I'd love to sit in on one because if you aren't passionate about service and about your customers you won't last -- or rarely last I should say.

Regretfully, I wasn't too impressed...\n\nAmbiance:  It's a simple enough cafe, but I found that the purpose is lost.  Is it a cafe, or is it a restaurant?  Can it be both?  I'm not sure, but I encourage the Blue Fig to pick one...\n\nService:  You never really interact with them besides ordering.  The girl at the front, for her credit, was super nice -- I had seen online that the barristas here make shapes out of the coffee.  On my trip (of course) the barrista who could do that was out that day, so no such luck.  Still, the girl that WAS working agreed to try for me -- she made me a simple heart, so I was happy.\n\nFood:  I think that the best thing that they served me here was the coffee.  I tried their \"3 Piece Bruschetta Sampler\" and it was awful.  Next I split the \"Savory Waffle\" with a friend, and again, it was pretty awful.  When I think of both of those things, well, let's just say that what I expected was not what I got.  Lastly we split the Ham and Gruy\u00e8re sandwich.  This was pretty much the reason that my review was a 1.5 and not a 1.  It was exceptional, such that I encourage the Blue Fig to make more items like this (maybe focus entirely on over the top stuff, rather than the aforementioned, underwhelming sampler), and I bet you'd get a lot more word of mouth traffic.\n\nFor my part, I don't think I'll go back without a major menu shakeup.", "author": "Bryan H."}

The lack of any seasoning lead me to ask olive oil from behind the counter. The sandwhich needed some salt too, so I sprinkled some on, then it tasted better. I liked the Roma breakfast a lot after those touches. \n\nThe asking price was around $7.50 I believe. Not really a bargain, and the portion wasn't that big either. Felt like a mere appetizer rather than a breakfast meal. \n\nBesides that the ambience was relaxed, and the counter help was having a good time when I swung by here. There are some cool photos and pieces of art up on the wall that are nice eye candy. \n\nIf I come here again, I may just go with coffee.", "author": "Maximilian R."}

On the one hand, you are always the perfect place to hang out and get some work done, never dead, but never as ridiculously crowded as a certain other trendy coffee shop down the road.  The ambiance is always nice and welcoming, and you have some delicious snacks to keep my belly full; the egg sandwich is to die for. \n\n But on the other hand, Blue Fig, I always want myself finding more.  The wait for food and drinks can err on the lengthy side, and when it gets there, more often than not it is just kinda...meh.  And I have sampled a wide variety. Also, while I have quit drinking coffee I have had friends tell me that theirs is noticeably worse than at other places.\n\nSo in sum, Blue Fig is overall, not a bad place if you are in the area, but with so much that the neighborhood has to offer I would't put it as one of my favorites.", "author": "Mirae B."}

It sounded like the right thing to do.\n\nWe got there around 12, the place looked packed with a few tables available here and there. There is sidewalk seating, main area seating and back patio seating which looked nice. My friend sat down at one of the tables and I walked to the counter to place our order. I asked for two coffees and mentioned they were going to be \"for here\". The 20something looking guy took two \"paper cups\" and walked to coffee machine. Right when he was about to pour the coffee, he turned around and explained \"we have no more \"for here\" cups available\". Well, perhaps they were out of the clean ones at the moment. Kinda ruins the Sunday brunch experience but no big deal.\n\nThen I ordered some food, got a plastic number attached to a stand and walked to our table holding the paper cup coffees. After maybe 2 minutes of having seated myself, two other ladies walked in to the patio, holding \"real\" cups looking to see if there was any available spot. Still holding the no big deal attitude, I convinced myself they had just got them out of the dish washer.\n\nMy friend and I had some catching up to do, so we almost didn't realize how half an hour passed. I just looked up and noticed that our food was not here yet. The same guy that took my orders was passing by, I called him out and inquired about the order. He merely looked at me, barely stopped and on his way back to the main area just said \"we are super busy this morning\". Oh well, an egg sandwich and a french toast definitely needs some preparation...\n\nAfter about another 20 minutes, It just got frustrating. I called another one of their staff and explained it had been 50 minutes that we were been waiting for the food to come. She left and after a couple of minutes returned with a \"your order for some reason has not gone through... Do you want me to put it through?!!!!\"\n\nAt that moment we decided we didn't wanna ruin our Sunday in such a place. Went to the cashier, the same guy had the nerve to return my cash to me with a vague explanation \"I am sorry, there was something wrong with the toilet, it all got confusing and so and so...\"\n\nDefinitely not giving it another chance.", "author": "Tara H."}

The egg sandwich. I think you can make this vegetarian, but they serve it with Boar's Head ham and this really delicious, light basil aioli. It tastes like bechamel sauce and marries perfectly with the expertly fried egg inside a double canopy of focaccia heaven.\n\n3. The \"blue\" waffle. This waffle is special in that it's made from blue cornmeal, but still eats like the waffle you've always loved. It's hearty and crispy, and they serve it with this amazing fig reduction sauce and maple syrup. \n\nThis is one of those cafes that look like they could be great or terrible.

I give credit to the 3 people working the restaurant (one had to do the register + make coffee; the other the food), they were very busy, and they were doing their best to get the food out. \n\nI think the place was under-staffed which created a bad experience for us, and probably wasn't a good work environment for the people working. Other people around us who had been waiting had been asking about their food (one couple got a refund and left).\n\nWhen we were leaving, the bathroom was flooding too, so water was spilling out and noone could use the bathroom.

I was pleased with the taste and ingredients of the salad...fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, candied pecans, and a delicious fig dressing.  However, the lettuce to other stuff ratio was disappointing...too much lettuce, not enough other stuff. I tried my friend's veggie sandwich and it was incredible. Roasted peppers on crunchy ciabatta. I would definitely go back but I'd get a sandwich next time. If it's a nice day, the little garden area out back is a charming and relaxing place to eat.", "author": "Corinne G."}

Flow: The crazy mess behind the counter, lack of communication with the customers on who was going to deliver the food/drinks or if they should wait at the counter, the line infringing on people's tables. Think about the experience, did you mean to make it feel hectic? Did you want me to finally sit down going oh  man am I actually going to get my food or will someone else?\n\n2a. Pay attention to your staff/efficiency. Does it really make sense to keep the tea up on top of the counter so that the barista needs to reach up uncomfortably every time someone wants some? It's great to have them on display, but time is money and customers aren't always going to wait in line. Keep the containers on the counter, and the tea within arms reach.\n\n2b. Consider a # system. I felt bad for your staff twice as they searched for someone, gave the wrong table other people's food.\n\n3. FOOD: Waffles (especially with bacon inside) are a killer idea but  you need to step it up. They are tough, firm and chewy. People want fluffy, flavorful and mouth watering. Consider getting a different style waffle maker, or really embrace the quality of these ones.\n\n4. The coffee - my cappuccino wasn't top notch\n\nKeep trying, I like the location, the outdoor seating and the croque monsieur is awesome.\nGood luck, I'll maybe try back in a few months.", "author": "Patrick D."}

Ordering at the counter was clunky because the staff member was new to the computer system. Open kitchens are awesome but theirs looked like a hot mess with 4 people crammed behind a tiny prep table.  With the size of their menu and full service coffee bar, I don't see how they can run a smooth operation.\n\nNow onto the good, because there are plenty. The iced chai was fantastic - not too sweet, not too spicy. The salmon bagel was pretty average but they added a nice touch with the preserved lemon rind. 3-way sample bruschetta was worth trying but I recommend getting all basil cream cheese. By far the winner over the peanut butter and almond butter.

It was served on warm toasted bread with a side of salad that had a spectactubular vinegarette dressing that complimented the sandwich perfectly! One of the things i really enjoyed about the sandwich was the texture. Its really easy to make a soggy dripping ruben. But THIS sandwich had just the right amount of dressings as to not overwhelm the taste buds and allow the bread to stay warm and toasty the whole way through. A difficult thing to do..\n\nI have to agree with the above statement about the pasta salad. I had it too and it was amazing!!! I too was full but polished it off because of its yummy goodness lol. \n\nIt was nice to actually be able to see your food being prepared.

The only drawback is that it's too small for its level of awesomeness; I feel a little bad loitering over breakfast when new patrons are standing around looking for non-existent empty tables.", "author": "William P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-17", "description": "great sandwiches for a reasonable price. the sandwiches are made fresh and are so crispy with the first few bites. if you eat slow like me you might start to feel the sogginess begin to develop but it's delicious no matter what. the salads are very healthy too and you feel so good about eating there compared to a fast food restaurant. the plates come out beautifully decorated unlike the simplicity of the store, and parking is relatively easy if you don't mind paying the meter.", "author": "Kristine C."}
