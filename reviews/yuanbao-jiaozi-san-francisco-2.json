You can choose to have the dumplings without soup (14 pieces) or with soup (clear broth with 12 pieces). I prefer it with soup because it keeps the dumplings hot and juicy. The broth is clear and savory with seaweed, green onions and cilantro. Order the Shiitake Mushroom & Fish Dumpling, smooth in texture and delicious flavors. My 2nd favorite is the Pork & Three Delicacies Dumpling.\n\nShredded Pig Ear in Chili Oil - thinly sliced marinated pig ear, crunchy texture, and flavorful. This is a cold dish. \n\nHot & Spicy Beef Tendons - also a cold dish, thinly sliced beef tendons with sliced white onions. Delicious!\n\nIts a small location, sometimes there is a wait, sometime the service takes a little long, but I think its worth the wait considering how fresh the dumplings are.", "author": "Janny S."}

Also tried the beef noodle soup and the broth was flavorful, but the noodles were alright. Recommend trying any of the dumplings, just depends on your preferred filling. I've tried the chicken and shiitake and fish and shiitake and both were good. I'd probably pass on ordering them in soup as the soup is nothing too amazing, it was like a plain seaweed soup.\n\nGood addition to the area but it gets really busy and isn't a very big place.", "author": "Mary X."}

The 4 of us were seated after a short 10-minute wait. The restaurant is small but clean. You can see chinese ladies behind a glass window making fresh dumplings. My friends have been here a few times. They ordered the cucumber salad and tofu sticks for starters, beef noodle soup, and 3 different types dumplings- Shiitake mushroom & fish, celery & pork, and shrimp & 3 delicacies. Out of the dumplings, my favorite was the celery & pork, yea yea basic I know, but the other two tasted really bland to me. The shrimp and 3 delicacies was filled heavily with chives which I do not like. If I had known chives was one of the delicacies, I would have ordered something different. \n\nNow let's talk about the beef noodle soup!! It's so good, I highly recommend ordering it. We got it with mild spiciness, which was perfectly flavored and the noodles are nicely cooked. Honestly next time I go, I would skip the dumplings and order the beef noodles instead!", "author": "Valerie C."}

That's kind of how I'm currently feeling about Yuanbao Jiaozi which is unfortunate because they make some truly delicious dumplings in my opinion.\n\nWalked in during an off-hour and was able to get seated right away - there were only about 3 other tables at the time. We perused the short menu and opted for two plates of dumplings just to hold us over.\n\n...5 minutes\n\n...10 minutes\n\n...20 minutes\n\nOkay what's going on? Are they raising a pig for the pork or growing cabbage for these dumplings?\n\nWe wave down a waitress and she \"checks\" with the kitchen citing an additional 10 minutes was needed. At this point, I just have to raise my voice a bit - we're looking at 30 minutes for boiled dumplings? Are you kidding me? She then bargains with us - how about 5 minutes? Fine. Whatever. But then we watch another 3-4 plates come out none of which are ours. \n\nUnacceptable.\n\nCue us waving down second hostess who actually goes to check the tickets. She rifles through the pile and looks up with a shocked face...and repeats the process as if she had missed it the first time. Next thing you know, she walks to the kitchen and pulls out one of the ladies who typically makes the dumplings and immediately assigns her to make our dishes. She apologizes to us, citing a computer error....I guess that makes it okay?\n\nBy the time our dumplings arrive, we were very hangry to say the least.  2 plates of dumplings should have never taken 40 minutes to arrive. In fact, I'm also disappointed that they didn't even realize something was amiss before we did. I'm also not one to ask for free things but I honestly felt like a discount or a free appetizer was warranted in this case.\n\nSo as good as they were in technical skill and taste, it just didn't hit the spot at all.\n\nHopefully this was a one-off experience.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Finally got to try this place on a Saturday during \"linner\" hours - got here around 430pm - and there was no wait! \n\nWe were seated immediately and got to sit in front of the clear walls where we could see the workers freshly make the dumplings in front of us (kind of reminds me of Din Tai Fung!). \n\nWe ordered the house special beef noodle soup (spicy), pork and napa cabbage dumplings, and shiitake mushroom and fish dumplings. We were not disappointed by any of these dishes! The beef noodle soup was very flavorful and not very spicy - they do have chili oil in case you want more spice! The noodles were cooked just right, and super easy to cut and divide among two people. Both dumplings were great, and very fresh! The mushroom and fish dumplings stood out to me the most though, you could really taste both flavors. You also get all the standard sauces (soy sauce, black vinegar, white vinegar, and chili oil) to make your perfect dipping sauce. I'll definitely come back and try more, if not all, of their dumplings! \n\nParking in this area wasn't too hard!

This new spot serves pretty authentic tasting, northern-style Chinese dumplings, and they offer a variety of different types. Coming from a northern Chinese family, I thought the appetizers were very authentic and the dumplings tasted similar to the ones I had tried while in China. \n\nWe decided on the spicy pig ears appetizer, the shrimp and three delicacies boiled dumplings, and the beef noodle soup. The restaurant is small, and we luckily didn't have to wait for dinner at around 6pm on a Saturday night. The food, however, took a long time to arrive at the table,  and the service was somewhat lacking. The spicy pig ears were so full of  flavor, and I loved the spicy, garlic-onion aroma with the crunch of sesame seeds. The shrimp and three delicacies dumplings had a filling of shrimps, chives, and eggs and they were pretty good. There wasn't too much filling in the dumplings, but they were cooked perfectly. The beef noodle soup was also very good, but the noodles were a bit overcooked for me. \n\nI see this place becoming a popular spot in the future, and expect a line the next time I come.

Luckily the wait was only around 10 minutes!\n\nWe ordered the tofu skin salad, dumplings with pork with three delicacies, and dumplings with fish and shitake mushrooms. The tofu salad came out and the first thing we noticed was that it was pretty spicy! As we kept eating, it got spicier and spicier, but we enjoyed it. The dumplings came out together shortly after. Our favorite was the shitake mushroom & fish dumpling. The shitake was so flavorful and the fish was unexpectedly good. I've never had fish in a dumpling before, so it was different but yummy! The pork with three delicacies were just okay. We didn't really know what the three delicacies were, but we could see the scallions, lol!!\n\nI like how you can mix your own sauce with their soy sauce, dark/white vinegar, and chili oil.

Honestly, besides the fact that they were affordable (14 dumplings for the dry, 12 dumplings for the soup at about $9 each), the food itself wasn't all that impressive.\n\nThe dumplings are freshly made (you can see them being made behind you), but they honestly taste like they were just boiled and then served quickly. I guess that's what dumplings are, but visually it left a lot to be desired.\n\nTaste wise, the food was just mediocre. The meat didn't taste all that good on either dish, and dipping them didn't make it much better either.

I forget who had told me about this restaurant, but I couldn't deny my intrigue with the pinyin-based name. My friend and I both had a weekday free, so I asked her to drive us out to catch the opening hour in fear that the place would be crowded. Lo and behold, we were the only customers in the place at 11:30 on a Thursday.\n\nAs others state, the place is small, with five 4-seaters and four 2-seaters. Din Tai Fung-style, you can watch the chefs make dumplings from behind a glass panel. Jasmine tea is $1 per person and consists of tea bags and hot water from a Zojirushi water boiler in the back (not self-serve). There are 7 dumpling varieties, each order costing $8.99. An order of dumplings itself comes with 14, whereas an order of dumplings in soup comes with 11 or 12 dumplings. We opted for a plate of the celery and pork dumplings, which were tasty and not overpowered by the celery. We also ordered the $4.99 tofu skin stick salad and the $10.99 house special beef noodles, non-spicy. I was happy with the quantity of tender beef, but we both found the noodles in the beef noodle soup to be way too soggy, as if they had been boiled for too long. Would not get again.\n\nOther reviewers mention that $9 for 14 dumplings is steep. For some skewed perspective (skewed because prices are from 2016), Shanghai Dumpling King sells 10 dumplings for $5.75, and Kingdom of Dumpling prices 12 pieces at $6.95. So, yes, 14 dumplings for $9 is a $1 more according to this linear equation, but it's not atrocious. My taste buds aren't picky enough to prefer one store's dumplings over another's, and, honestly, I can't think of a dumpling I've had that I haven't liked. So, if you happen to be nearby and are looking for some decent dumps, Yuanbao Jiaozi is solid.", "author": "Adele F."}

They have the standard pork and cabbage dumplings, in addition to some that I haven't commonly seen on standard dumpling menus (e.g. shiitake mushroom and fish, green pepper and fish, etc.). We shared the cucumber salad, dumpling soup (with shiitake mushrooms and chicken), and steamed shrimp and zucchini dumplings. The cucumber salad was excellently flavored, with sesame oil, garlic, and cilantro. Yummmm. Definitely our favorite part of the meal. The dumpling soup was comforting and especially welcomed on a typical freezing summer day in SF (:. The broth was simple, fresh, and hit the spot. The steamed dumplings were just OK. They fell apart far too easily and the filling was a bit too 'eggy' for my taste. Also came with minimal shrimp, sadly. Meh. Would also be great if they offered fried dumplings. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and you can see the chefs making your dumplings in the kitchen. Service was great. Wait was not too long on a holiday for a table of 3 (about 10 minutes). $8.99 for 12 steamed dumplings or dumpling soup = good price for the area. The tea served with the meal ($1 charge) was strong and delicious. Bonus points for *not* being cash only. Not my favorite dumpling place, but I'd go again if I was in the area (especially to try the spicy beef soup I was eyeing).", "author": "Tahmina N."}

Each order of dumplings is $8.99 and contains 12. With soup comes with a pretty plain broth. Dry dumplings would be better dipped with spicy chili oil paste. Also tried their marinated beef $6.99 and beef noodle soup $10.99 -- both were just average. \n\nOverall I think people like the \"made fresh\" concept and the other people who come are probably only here because they see a long line and assume there's great food.

If you're craving Chinese food minus all the greasy and heavy sauces, you will love this place! \n\nFOOD: \nTheir menu is very straight forward and easy to choose from. They have variety of dumplings, 1 beef noodle soup and a small selection of tapas. We got: \n+ Cucumber salad $5: very refreshing with a small kick of sin chuan oil\n+ Tofu skin salad $5: same taste as the cucumber salad, but with different texture of course\n+ Beef Noodle Soup $10: the broth was flavorful without being too oily. The noodles were evenly shaped and chewy, but it came with less beef than I would have liked. \n+ Shrimp & 3 delicacies: shrimp, chive and other spices. This one was pretty good. The skin isn't too thick or too thin. The ratio of filling to skin is perfect. \n+ Chicken and Shiitake: This was our favorite!   \n\nSERVICE: \nThey only had one server/hostess when we were there. It was okay when only a couple of tables were full, but one server can be way under staff when people come all at once during rush hour. It took us awhile to get our bill because she was busy with other tables. But other than that, she was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nLike many trendy dumpling and dim sum places, you will get to watch the staff wrap the dumplings by hand through a glass wall. The shop itself isn't that big. They have about 9-10 tables that seat 2-6. They are located by Quicklys on Irving, so parking can definitely be a headache. \n\nVerdict: I would take my parents here to try there other dumplings!", "author": "Samantha F."}

Not so good. \n\nI wanted to like this place SO much more than I did bc I love me some good dumplings. And man, they had SO many dumpling options I could eat here! All that seafood!!\n\nWe started off with three diff apps: (1) seaweed salad - uhhhh was this Costco bought? This was that Japanese seaweed salad you get at an Americanized restaurant. Not the szcheun type of seaweed salad you'd expect; (2) tofu skin salad - basically flavorless. No spice. No salt. No nothing; (3) cucumber salad - also flavorless. And sadly, the best of the three, but still not good. Also, the cucumber salad wasn't even chopped properly. The pieces weren't so much pieces as they were all stuck together by the skin! \n\nThen, dumplings. OKAY, those grandmas churning out dumplings made-to-order is impressive. We order fish and mushroom (boiled) and one of the shrimp ones (soup) to share. Few things. First of all, I'm no food inspector, but all the seafood was just left out while they were waiting to make the dumplings. Is that okay?? It's not at a refrigerated temp, which seemed a bit concerning. Secondly, the soup option wasn't so much a soup as it was boiled water with dumplings in it. ZERO flavor. And the worse part?! They don't even make their own sauce. Isn't that the best part of dumpling eating?! Or second best, behind the actual dumpling itself. \n\nAnyways, the fish one was better than the shrimp. But not by far. The food wasn't gross, by any means, but also wasn't good. For that price, I expected more. Kingdom of Dumpling has still got WAY better dumplings IMO.

Noodles were a bit generic though and too soft.\n\nOf the dumplings, my highlights were the:\n- Shrimp with Three Delicacies (P.S. the Three Delicacies are eggs, chives, and scallions)\n- Shiitake Mushrooms with Fish\n\nWe arrived at 6 PM on a weekday and there was no wait but around 7:30 PM when we passed the restaurant again there was a pretty significant queue waiting outside.

The place itself is very clean and minimally decorated with a big glass window where you can watch the kitchen staff make all the Jiaozi (I really enjoyed this part lol). \n\nMy friend and I both ordered the Pork & Three Delicacies Dumpling Soup and the portions were big! I honestly don't find Jiaozi particularly special considering I grew up eating them and they kind of all taste the same to me, but these were tasty and the soup was comforting and partly a reason why I enjoyed this place so much. The only negative I have for this place is that it took quite some time for us to get our food even with only 2 other tables (who were already served) and a couple of take-out orders that came in while we were seated. \n\nTLDR; If you want inexpensive and yummy dumplings, come here--especially if you're starving because it's filling.", "author": "Anna L."}

Right off the bat there's a party of ~8 Chinese people ahead of us. The only waitress there puts together a few two-tops to accommodate them. The result was a big gap in the middle of the floor with two two-tops in awkward positions -- one right in front of the doors and the other angled in between a couple (Mr. and Ms. Quiet) and a guy sitting at the end of the big party.\n\n-- Act I --\nAt this point we're standing in the opened doorway waiting for the waitress to seat us. In addition to the awkwardly positioned tables, there were two four-tops in decent places and one four-top in the back left corner. This one was so squeezed into the corner, it had room for only two chairs, both of which were side by side and facing the dumpling prep area.\n\nAfter I told the waitress I had two in my party, she had the gall to offer me the table right in front of the doors. I said, \"I'm not sitting right by the door.\" She looked confused then proceeded to another table to take their order. HELLO?!!!!\n\nAnother waitress finally arrived (she was late), and (surprise! surprise!) she had the gall to offer me the table with the chairs facing the dumpling prep area. I refused and told her that's a terrible place. So she offered me one of the decent tables. At this point I was exhausted by the idiocy of the waitstaff.\n\n-- Act II --\nWhile we looked at the menu, I kept my eye on whether they were going to move the awkwardly laid two-tops to fill in the gap on the floor. Well, they didn't. Two women came in and were sat at the table right in front of the doors. When the waitress took their order, she stood between their table and the doors. A customer was trying to come in to join his party which was already seated, but he couldn't. The waitresses looked like idiots when they realized this and scrambled to unlock the left door for him. \n\nThe whole time we were there they never moved the other awkward table so customers could use it. Instead, they pushed it right against Mr. and Ms. Quiet's table which unnecessarily caused a woman and her child to sign up on the wait list. (And most of us there weren't going anywhere for a while.)\n\n-- Act III --\nWhen the party of 8 finally left, the waitresses re-arranged the tables and seated strangers together at two-tops. An older man who didn't want to sit with a random younger guy was lucky that Mr. and Ms. Quiet just left, so he moved to their table. At another two-top, an older woman spotted the empty table behind me, so she darted for it. But the waitress insisted she go back to the two-top and sit with a stranger. Seriously??\n\n-- Epilogue --\nI understand restaurants don't want to sit X people at a Y table where X is less than Y. But I've been to many restaurants that will do that anyway if it makes the most sense at the time. They get it. They get that they should accommodate the customers physically standing at the door rather than the party of five that might or might not appear in the next 15 minutes. Yeah, this place is small, and lots of people come here. This pain point is a result of their success. But they need to remember that for young businesses continued success comes from happy dining experiences, which is the sum of many things, not just good food. So if you force strangers to sit together or force customers to sit in bad places when there are other options, they might not come back. I'm certainly not holding my breath until the next time I go back because I'm not dying to return.\n\n=== The numbers ===\n\n* Food: 3.8 (We ordered the cucumber salad, fish/mushroom dumplings, and chicken/mushroom dumpling soup)\n* Value (food and price): 4\n* Table Service: 2.5 (No offers to refill our water until we were done eating despite the fact the waitresses were standing around a couple of times.

The selfish part of me wants to rate this place down so it doesn't become that popular place with the hour-long wait, because that's what I expect this place would be very soon.\n\nWe came here for a snack after a walk in the park. We arrived when they opened and were one of the three parties in the restaurant. The staff greeted us and gave us our choice of table. The venue was light-filled and spacious. A glass panel separated the clean, organized kitchen from the dining area, so you can see the chefs meticulously preparing your dumplings.\n\nThe service staff was extremely friendly. Sometimes I feel like I have to speak Chinese at a Chinese restaurant in order to get better service, but this comes at the cost of leaving my non-Chinese friends out of the conversations with the waiter. The staff here at Yuanbao Jiaozi was very courteous to us even though we spoke to them in English, and were treated just as well as the Mandarin/Cantonese-speaking parties next to us.\n\nI was delighted by the small menu--no analysis paralysis! In my experience, places with small menus tend to have amazing food. They're confident that you'd be pleased by anything in their small food selection, and they're able to concentrate on mastering all their dishes.\n\nMy hunch was completely correct. We ordered two appetizers (about $6-7 each): the spicy beef tendon \u9ebb\u8fa3\u725b\u7b4b and shredded seaweed \u6d77\u5e36\u7d72 (Chinese style, though they also offered the Japanese version of the dish). Though both were served cold in chili oil, they had very distinct flavors. The beef tendon's sauce included vinegar and tasted slightly sour, perfect for balancing out any excessively meaty taste. The seaweed salad tasted a bit musty like the ocean, which I loved.\n\nWe also ordered the pork & three delicacies dumplings \u8089\u4e09\u9bae ($8.99; not pictured because we just wolfed them down). The skin on these dumplings were thin yet chewy. They contained the perfect ratio of the filling. The minced meat was very tender, and tasted slightly herbal, maybe of Chinese five-spice? Overall, the food reminded me of my mom's cooking, one of the highest praises I can give.\n\nI cannot wait to be back in the area just so I can come back to Yuanbao Jiaozi and try more of their dishes.", "author": "Yuki P."}

When we arrived, we found out that it's their soft opening right now. We were behind three other tables, and were seated in about 20 minutes. During the wait, we were observing the staff, and they all work so slowly. Most people were sitting idly at the tables on their phones, as if waiting for something. One even got tired of waiting and went up to the front to pay the bill. The people making the dumplings were so slow and forming them in an unnecessarily delicate way. The waitresses had clean tables empty for minutes before seating the next group on the list. However, it is their soft opening, so I understand that the restaurant is still developing efficient operations and workflow. \n\nHot and Spicy Beef Tendon ($6.99) - so flavorful. The sauce was so good and I almost wanted to drink it - I didn't, but I did dip my dumplings into it! However, the portion is incredibly small for the price, especially compared to other restaurants that serve this dish.\nShredded Seaweed ($5.99) - also very good, with garlic and chili sprinkled on top. They asked if we wanted the Chinese or Japanese version (Japanese version is the seaweed salad that is sometimes sold at grocery stores/served in restaurants). We chose the Chinese version, and they're like seaweed \"noodles\", with a great texture (if overcooked, they're too soft). Also small portion for the price.\nHouse Special Beef Noodles (I forgot price, but around $11-12?) - we got the spicy version, but we couldn't really tell because our appetizers were already spicy. It was very good, and the soup tasted a little herbal. The noodles were great as well, and it came with beef slices and cubes, some greens, and peanuts. We liked this. \nShrimp and Three Delicacies Dumpling ($8.99) - shrimp, egg, and chive dumplings. They tasted good, great skin thickness, with a good amount of filling, and the shrimp was sweet (in a seafood way, not a sugar way) and cooked well. You can order dumplings on a plate (comes with 14) or in a soup (comes with 12). My dad was looking forward to a dumpling sauce, but they only had the standard soy sauce, chili sauce, and vinegars.\n\nCard accepted only for purchases over $20. Their \"Three Delicacies\" should be clarified on the menu so that people don't constantly ask. The waitress told me that it is shrimp, egg, and chive. But then why is there a \"Shrimp & Three Delicacies Dumpling\"? Isn't that redundant? Also, it was clear that our group would be sharing the items that we ordered. All we were given were tiny little sauce plates. When we asked for something on which to eat the appetizers, we were given little bowls that are used in other places as sauce bowls (such as for hot pot). After the noodle soup came out, I asked for a bigger bowl, and the waitress seemed annoyed and gave me one (same type the appetizers came in). I didn't feel like service was slow during the meal, as we were just finishing up our appetizers when the noodle soup and dumplings came, and they gave us our check quickly after asking. The food overall was very tasty, but somewhat pricey for the small portions. Will come again after their grand opening to see if there are any changes.", "author": "Nicole M."}

You can see the ladies making their fresh dumplings through the transparent glass as you wait for your food to come. \n\nFunny side story. On the menu for the dumpling side, they have the option of having it plain (steamed) or having the dumplings in soup. As we were waiting for our food to come, this dude next to us literally flagged and asked the waiter \"so what are the differences between plain and in soup? By in soup do you mean the dumplings are in the soup or the soup are in the dumplings?\" By that point, I couldn't help but to crack up inside. What kind of question is that? Lol maybe this guy got dumplings and XLB's (xiao long bao) mixed up cause... I've never had soup inside regular dumplings. \n\nBut anyways....... ordered their shrimp and pork 3 delicacies dumping and their spicy beef noodle soup. \n\nTheir beef noodle soup was on the lighter side. Their soup tasted something along the lines of light broth + beef stew/ brisket sauce + hint of white pepper. It came with 3 types of beef (seemingly): Thin slices of marinated beef, beef brisket, and beef cubes. They were all super tender and flavorful. \n\nI think if you like dumplings, the pork ones a standard staple. A good thickness for their handmade wraps, not too thick and not too thin, also good ratios with the fillings. \n\nFor the shrimp dumplings, it was on the saltier side for me. Wasn't sure if it was due to the leek.. the shrimp or whatever it was in it. Also these weren't as filled compared to the pork ones and they were more watery, probably due to the moisture from either ingredient. \n\nOverall not bad for a new place on Irving.

This place offers a small menu of dumplings served three ways (your choice of regular boiled, with soup or pan fried) and an equally small menu of cold appetizers. Some dumpling options are chicken and mushroom, shrimp and veggies, celery and chicken, celery and pork, and the two we chose:\n\n- Mushroom fish dumpling: This is their house special, according to our server, and we chose to have it just boiled. The wrap was on the thick side but had a nice chew. Definitely fresh tasting--you can see the workers making the dumplings to order in the glass-walled kitchen. The filling was tasty in a homemade sort of way. The fish and mushroom are chopped up small, and the seasoning is very mild. This one benefited from some chili in oil and vinegar. Shiitake mushrooms gave it a nice dose of umami. Overall, a decent dumpling that satisfies.\n\n- Shrimp zucchini dumpling: We chose to get this one with soup, which is a clear broth with cilantro. Compared to the mushroom fish, this was less satisfying. The filling was chopped so finely that it was hard to tell it's shrimp. Pretty mild flavor as well--ate this one with chili and vinegar, too. Between the two dumpling orders and one appetizer, the two of us were full and had four dumplings left to take home. Decent value. \n\n- Spicy beef tendon: Average. Does a good job at whetting your appetite.\n\n- Service: As to be expected for a first day, service was imperfect. The kitchen was pretty backed up, for which the servers were very apologetic, which was nice. We waited more than half an hour for the first plate of dumplings to come out, and then another 20 minutes for the second dish.

It will add more flavor if you dip it in the soy sauce+ chilly sauce( you can make it yourself). It's my favorite. Highly recommend the dumplings with soup, healthy!

The menu is small, but everything I've had was fresh and flavorful. \n\nThe dumpling skin was thin enough not to be chewy, but tough enough not to fall apart when you pick it up. A good balance that is and to find. The fillings are obviously fresh and well balanced. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was excellent. The noodles tasted like they were just rolled. It also included certain cuts of meat that are shunned by most Americans but prized in other cuisines.

The menu is rather limited, and the dumplings are good but not great. Service was excellent though, and pricing was decent for the sunset. \n\nFood: The seaweed salad was nicely seasoned and pretty generously portioned. I thought it was a nice touch that they offered \"Chinese spicy style\" or \"Japanese non-spicy\". The shrimp zucchini dumplings were pretty good, while the pork five spice dumplings were nothing too special- there were some chives but not enough for much flavor. I also saw some other tables order the beef noodle soup, which may be promising. I'm a little confused by the limited offerings of 5-6 appetizers, dumplings, and beef noodle soup. They're going to have to step up their game if they want to compete with Kingdom of Dumpling or Beifang style (better food, ridiculously good prices).\n\nInterior: The interior is well lit and has a nice modern feel. If you like to eat at places with good decor, this might be a better choice than the dingier sunset spots (which admittedly have better food).\n\nService: Great service! Attentive waitresses who refilled water quickly. Food was brought out quickly.\n\nOverall: Great ambiance, decent food but there's stiff competition in the sunset for dumplings!", "author": "Jackie T."}

The flavors are really interesting and different that your normal dumpling restaurant. Instead of pork and napa or chicken and chive, you can try shitake and fish or shrimp and zucchini. Just some really interesting dumplings. We ordered pork and 3 delicacies,  which has chive and egg in it. The dumplings are made to order, so be patient. It is worth the wait. Sometimes things will sell out, just roll with it. The wrapper is thin and the meat inside was tender and juicy. Also tried the shrimp and zucchini,  which had nice pieces of juicy shrimp inside.\nThe beef noodle soup was really tasty too. The noodles cooked just right and the soup wasn't greasy. You also get different cuts of beef, so it was really good. Our small dishes were cucumbers, pig ear and tofu skin. The cucumbers could have used a bit more garlic and salt. Everything was good though, although the spicy oil sauce was pretty similar in all three dishes. \nOverall this place was a big hit with my family. I would only suggest to the owners that they should add noodles.and soup to all of the dumpling options because not everyone likes beef and there are no other noodle options for people.

I had some friends who visited Taiwan and they said, this place was pretty good.  I recommend the seaweed salad and cucumber salad.", "author": "Jacky S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-03", "description": "The place is so new that it is very very slow. All the dumplings are handmade as you order and literally one person rolling the skin and the other wrapping the dumplings.  They don't really make your order in the order of who ordered what, when. They have one plate of one ingredient, they will finish wrapping that plate then move to another ingredient. Meaning if you order chicken dumpling and shrimp dumpling at the same table and they are busy, you will get one then wait a long time for the other. \n\nThe flavors of the ingredients are fresh. The meat ones are good and have meat, BUT if you order the shrimp, say shrimp ad 3 fresh ingredients, you will get very very little shrimp. Not worth it. If you order the dumpling in soup, it is really just water. So not really sure why to order that. \n\nThe sides are just ok. Can get better everywhere.\n\nPeople seem nice and authentic flavors. Good to try.", "author": "Food Is L."}

Cucumbers and tofu skin side dishes were seasoned well and tasty. I really like that they have a large selection of dumplings without pork since I don't eat pork. I do wish they would have one vegetarian option - that is the best feature of Dumpling Empire in South San Francisco and it's pretty rare to find good vegetarian dumplings around here. I like that they have soup, regular, and fried versions of each dumpling. The soup version is especially tasty on a cold day. Overall, seems slightly more expensive than other no frills Chinese places like House of Pancake, but still cheap overall and definitely worth visiting especially since I haven't seen any other dumpling shop in the city with such fresh dumplings.", "author": "Erin C."}

Each option can be steamed, made into a soup or pan fried (which unfortunately wasn't an option during the soft opening). Pigs ears were tasty but the soup was like water. I guess I'm used to awesome nourishing broth and this was just not that. It's also really cool to see the ladies making dumplings, which my toddler loved as well.", "author": "Ashley F."}

The female server was working and was pleasant. Let me preface this review by saying the food here is delicious. The beef noodle soup is to die for, and the dumplings are delicious and made fresh right in front of you. Now on to my bad rating. My second time in here, we sat for 20ish minutes while there were 4 tables of people in the restaurant waiting for our server to take our order. We watched two separate families get seated and served within 2 minutes of sitting down. We weren't on our phones and our menus were neatly folded in the middle of the table. I even tried to make eye contact with the gentleman taking orders multiple times to which we were ignored. I can't help but feel that because we were not of Asian descent, that the gentleman did not want to serve us. We finally decided to get up and leave and go to our favorite Pho place right down the road. I am not the type to write bad reviews and I myself have worked in the customer service industry for close to 15 years now. I know when I'm not welcome, and this place is certainly not accommodating to outsiders. Your mileage may vary. As a note this was at 8:47 pm on a Saturday. We didn't walk in at 9:55.", "author": "Hunter F."}

We had the shiitake mushroom & fish dumplings in a soup, and the shrimp & zucchini on the plate. As mentioned in another review, the soup broth is rather bland. There is also not a lot of vegetarian options. But the portions are generous- 10 dumplings in the soup and 14 on the plate. They did not have the pan-fried option available yet, but I will definitely return to try that as well.", "author": "Arielle T."}
