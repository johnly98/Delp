When we lived in SF, we'd walk to the Haight and eat in this location - it was another name back then - in this crazy building that was once the home to the famous Magnolia Thunderpussy's. You can look it up, really!\n\nAnyway, when my daughter-in-law came to visit a couple of weeks ago, she wanted to see the Haight on our way back to Marin, so I drove her around and figured we'd walk around and find somewhere nice for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised when we passed Magnolia, to see not just beers but some fine looking food, so we took a gamble.\n\nWell, first the beers were great. I had a lager, she had an ale, and we were both very happy!\nThen the food came and we both gobbled up our entrees, which were fresh, hot, tasty, and right-sized portions.\n\nThe best part might have been the people watching. We were seated by a window facing Haight, and I think Yelp would delete this review if I listed everything we saw during our lunch (some things I wish I hadn't). It's always a real slice of life there, and Magnolia's a great place to watch it happening.", "author": "Mike K."}

I had the Bombay IPA which I liked with the subtle hints of spice in the back of your throat and fragrant cloves in the aroma.  This is my own assessment so please don't go by what I say is what the brewer intends.  Anyways, the steamed mussels when fast because I didn't get a good photo.  Garlic was abundant and the broth very buttery and goes well with the toast.  We also ordered the special Fried Chicken,  jicama slaw, and bacon fried basmati rice.  This was very tasty.  I especially liked the bacon fried rice because it reminded me of when I use to cut school and make bacon fried rice at my best friend's house.  It all set in nicely.\n\nService was great.

The Rye was my preference as it was smooth and not overly hoppy, but wasn't the coldest beer I've had served, but still good.  The India had more hoppy flavors and was nice and chilled.  \n\nFor lunch, thumbs up for the burger cooked medium, adding smoked gouda and bacon - tasty and hit the spot!  Yes, definitely recommend the fries, they're awesome if you're a fresh fries fanatic.  A pricey burger at $18 with fries, but it was excellent.  If you just want fries, you can order those in a good size cone basket.\n\nAlso ordered a spinach salad, very fresh ingredients with bacon and the feta melted in your mouth.

I mean every 10 minutes you see those double decker tourist buses.  And the street is covered with pseudo hippie stores, Tibetan stores, some outrageous cloth stores and of course some name brand stores as well.  The street is a mix of tourists, locals, homeless and people just wandering usually high.  And it's perfect.  I decided to grab lunch at Magnolia because I really wanted a burger.  And the place is cool.  Service not so great.  I asked the waitress for seltzer with lemon and after she told me it was not available, something about a broken machine, she went on to list all the soda, loaded with sugar, they offer, I decided on regular water.  The burger was good and nicely prepared with fries.  But for $16.00 for a burger I expected something a little more than I received - like gold leaf.  They do bring a plate of ketchup, mustard and other condiments on the side, and keep refilled, which is nice.  I don't drink beer but the guys sitting me did.  They were asking the waitress about the various selections and instead of just bringing them a taste of something, she kept going into these long descriptions.  If it was me, I would of asked for a sample instead of listening to go her go on and on.

Okay, I'm being dramatic but no waters to be had in this establishment and our server (sweet lady with backwards floral print hat) was MIA. She finally arrived with our appetizer (spicy wings) and said \"oh, I'll bring you some water for the table.\" Yeah, thanks. \n\nI was willing to forgive the 10 minutes it took to get water since the food was pretty good. Not amazing food but my beau enjoyed the pub burger (it was cooked medium) and fries were crispy and delicious. I ordered the lamb sausage plate and also liked it--just a bit spicy with mash and greens/cabbage.\n\nTook a WHILE to have our plates cleared. In fact, it wasn't our server that did it. I guess another server noticed how long we were waiting and took pity on us.\n\nWhen our prodigal server finally did come by, we naively asked for the dessert menu because we're trusting folk and truly believed that the service could be redeemed.\n\nWE ALMOST DIED OF NO DESSERT. Okay, obviously not but it took another ten minutes of the MIA server just NOT bringing the dessert menu and us looking forlorn around the restaurant. Just as I was about to just walk up to the bar and pay, she magically appeared and asked if \"we needed anything.\" \n\nAre.You.serious.\n\nI said, we would like the check please and she said \"oh dessert!\" ... Nope, just the check.\n\nIn my haste to GTFO of there, I of course left my credit card at the table. We walked about 10 minutes away and I called to see if they had it. They of course couldn't find it and our server hadn't seen it (much like she hadn't seen us for the duration of our meal but I digress). I called my credit card company to cancel the card and OF COURSE magnolia calls back 30 min later to say they found it--Much like their service that night, a little late.\n\nMy new card is in the mail and will arrive in 3-5 business days which seems lightening fast compared to the service here :/", "author": "Semuteh F."}

We sat down and our waitress was \"SUPER\" nice and made the experience much better for us.  \n\nThis is a place you will either like or hate, in my opinion.  I love the look, design, and vibe they are going for.  This is a straight beer pub and above average food options, to pair your beer with.  Please don't expect any 5 meal course.  You have beer options and simple food options.   \n\nThe reason I gave this place a 3 star is for lack of great customer service, would like to see more beer options, and a very small establishment.

I don't go to the city too often but most of my trips include a stop to Magnolia for a couple pints of their killer beers and a bite to eat.\n\nThe name Magnolia is a Grateful Dead reference so the music they play is usually very much dead or of similar influence. Most of the beers names have a dead influence as well. New Speedway Bitter, High Time Harvest... Seems appropriate as they are located in the Haight Ashbury district of the city.\n\nThe beers are not only awesome but they serve them in 20oz. imperial pints! Beers are served cellar temperature and they always have a few cask conditioned offerings as well. My last visit I enjoyed the High Time Harvest Ale with fresh hops added to the beer within 24 hours of harvest, They had 2 versions, one with Citra hops, and the other with Mosaic. This is an awesome way to learn to identify what hop are in your beer by trying the exact beer brewed the same way but with a different single hop in each.\n\nFor food you are sure to find something you love here. They pride themselves on sustainable and fresh local ingredients including humanly raised meets. They have an chef that has a very unique style. I would describe the place as a Gastropub. They usually have a couple house made sausage offerings, and a killer burger. I had their version of a pastrami dip that was served with french onion soup as the dip, so good!\n\nWhen I'm in the city I go to Magnolia, you should too!", "author": "Mark F."}

Very cool that it was right on the sidewalk.\n\nThe English pale ale I had was very delicious--its name escapes me. The beer menu was full of various English-style craft ales I would've liked to try more of if their food menu didn't have an ounce of vegan options for my girlfriend and I to eat. You would think in a place like Haight they would have such offerings. I used to eat meat though, and for what options they did have they seemed very good. My girlfriend decided to finish our beers and eat elsewhere.\n\nI would've given this place another star, however while our server was quite nice, she took very long to return and check on us. \n\nWhat really ruined the experience for us, though, was another gal, raven-haired and slender, who was bussing the table behind us. I was politely trying to get her attention to request our check with our server a handful of times when she was literally right behind me. It seemed like she was blatantly ignoring me as it wasn't very noisy outside. After my final call to her she finally responded with a rudely scold back to me \"My hands are full!\" \n\nIt was very rude and unprofessional. And seeing the few glasses on her tray, she should've been very capable to take a minute to see to my needs, or at least given me the courtesy that they would be right with me.\n\nAll in all, good beer and nice atmosphere; but the lack of vegan options and poor service is enough to keep me from coming here.", "author": "Julius D."}

We were there early enough that we only had to wait about 10 minutes. \n\nWe all immediately decided we wanted the Magnolia Pub Burger, which is the only burger they offer. The burger comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion. You pay to add cheese, you pay to add bacon, you pay to add egg. So my $14 plain burger ended up being $17 with the addition of gruyere and egg. It would have been $19 if I had gone for the bacon too, and $20 if I had chosen blue cheese over gruyere.\n\nWe also ordered Scotch Quail Eggs to start. The eggs were good, served on top of a very spicy mustard sauce. But, quail eggs are tiny, so we were served two little eggs for $8.\n\nThe burgers came out. All overcooked. The person who ordered it rare was served medium, and the others who ordered medium rare got well done. The burgers are also served dry and you have to add your own mayo/mustard/ketchup.\n\nI found the burger to be dry and lacking flavor. The egg was overcooked. The fries on the side were delicious. The pickle on the side (homemade) was great. \n\nPerhaps if the burger was cooked to my liking I would have enjoyed this place more, but $17 for a burger is still a bit too much for me.

Honestly, I don't know much about beer except I enjoy the occasional Blue moon with a meal. Once in a while when the mood strikes, I like the stronger beers like Guinness. Since I went on a Tues, it was $4 pints all day. Perfect excuse to try two beers instead of one! The Proving ground ipa and Stout of circumstance both appealed to the lighter and darker side of my tastes! \n\nNow on to the food. I found everything to be standard pub fair with more misses than hits.\n\nPlate of pickles: I enjoyed the pickled veggies, but the apple and kumquats were a little odd. The mix of sweet and pickle just didn't work for me.\n\nHalf dozen oysters: Enjoyed the mignonette. Don't remember the type of oysters, but they tasted good with the all the sauces provided. Asked for tobasco and got a house hot sauce.\n\nCheeses: They had run out of most of the cheeses I wanted so I got the Bad axe and Chimney. I normally like soft cheeses the most, but I really enjoyed the Bad axe. Nice, creamy and savory. Yum!\n\nBeer brined pork chop: Sooo salty! The brussels and sweet potato were nicely seasoned and the pork chop was nicely cooked, but it was way too salty. Ruined the whole dish.\n\nPork & cheddar sausage: They had run out of the 2 sausages I wanted to try so we got this one instead. Everything was super oily. From the hash browns to the egg to the sausage. I love rich fatty food, but this dish needed some kind of carb or veggie to provide relief from all the oiliness of the ingredients in the dish.\n\nFish and chips: Our waitress forgot to enter this dish in with our order so by the time we got it, I was super full! I took a bit of the fish and it was nice fried. So were the chips. But as far as the seasoning, etc, I can't really comment on that.\n\nSo the only reason I came here was because I got a $100 gift card. If not for that, I probably would have never gone to Magnolia. Even though I would most likely never return for the food, I wouldn't mind coming here again for their $4 pints on Tues. Such a great deal!", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-16", "description": "Having visited Magnolia twice, both as an out-of-towner, I can say the place bolsters a homely and modern gastropub vibe. With a small short menu and revolving beer selection, Magnolia is a hip place to be among locals and youthful twenty-somethings. \n\nTo our fortune last Sunday, we came in around 1:30 p.m. and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table/booth. Kelly served us intermittently, as she was quite busy handling (my guess) over half of this establishment. If I was a New Yorker, my patience would have been tested. This place needs probably 1-2 more servers/waiters during these hours. \n\nI ordered the fish and chips, and found it to be quite simple and delicious. The fish and chips were not too oily, and good in portion. The fries were plentiful. However, by the end of the meal, I was definitely feeling a bit sleep and full from the food. It didn't help to know that I was in a lazy Sunday mood. Many people love the beers here, and from my discussion with the patrons and from other yelpers, this is what keeps them coming back. Pricing is inflated to match SF city standards (a bit higher than what I'm used to being in LA) for such hip and cool joints. \n\nI encourage you to at least try this place if you're looking for a place to come with friends, but not the boss or someone you're trying to impress. It'll do you right, and leave you feeling comfy.", "author": "Mohib Q."}

The food is good but isn't as good as it used to be.\n\nThe burger is now a 2 patty burger. It's decent but I prefer the previous burger. The new one is a touch greasier and isn't quite as juicy. They let you order it 'medium' but it has never come remotely pink the few times I've ordered it that way. Being that it's two thin patties, they take away that option as you can't cook a quarter pound patty to medium. Only medium rare or well. It's a bit disappointing.\n\nThey've changed the fries as well and I prefer the previous ones. They are thicker and not as crispy.\n\nThe burger plate now comes with a few pickle slices and no longer comes with a pickle slice... bummer.\n\nI heard that the fish and chips weren't as good also.\n\nPerhaps the changes all came with the recent news about the business, a new chef and a mostly new staff.\n\nI love the beer but paying $8 for one is a bit steep.

We were seated immediately at a table by the window.  We heard that they brew their own craft beers and they have pretty tasty food.  I love gastropubs.  We ordered: burger with bacon and gruyere (to split), heirloom tomato salad with burrata (to split), beers, and the sticky toffee pudding.  \n\nService was excellent.  The food was pretty good.  The tomatoes were sliced thin and you can't go wrong with burrata mozzarella.  The burger was cooked medium and had the perfect amount of pinkness.  They split it in half for us and gave us separate places.  The fries were crispy too.  I even enjoyed the pickle spear too.  As for beer, I tried the pomegranate cider (guest beer).  It was good and more my style of beer.  The sticky toffee pudding was full of toffee flavor.  It was more of a cake than the chocolate pot de creme that we decided against and a perfect end to a great meal.  It can be a little pricey but we liked it.

This wasn't my first choice as the options   for food seemed limited but  I was way out voted and I am glad I was.    For a drink, I had a raspberry cider  which was quite good and most of  my  friends had that as well.    For food,  I had  the burger, medium rare  with smoked cheddar.  They cooked it perfectly  and it had loads of flavor and was super juicy .   The spicy  aoli   added a little heat, but not much at all and it complimented the burger well.  The fries  that came with the burger  were  fries.   The highlight of the night though were the  cheese croquettes.  . They were addictive and would be perfect as a snack if you are mainly drinking, but wanted  something to nibble on.    They came out  warm and gooey and cheesy!!    They also came with garlic mayo which I used on the fries too! (So yummy.)  \nThe   host and  waitress were very nice.  They were able to handle our group of 8 people.   My friend accidentally   knocked  a full pint   over and the waitress and host quickly got the situation handled.   We  were there a long while and we never felt rushed. \nMain issue  was the loudness but that seems to be a SF thing. \n\nI am never in this neighborhood so  I probably won't come back, but if  I wanted a similar vibe for a meet up like last night and other people  in my group lived closer   I would consider coming again.", "author": "Sascha B."}

My friend and I were the first to arrive in our party, we were expecting a few others to show. The waitress sat my friend and me at one of their large booths and said \"no one else can sit here, once you 2 have been seated\". I really just shrugged her comment off since the booth was huge and could easily accommodate 4 people. Well when my friend and his wife arrived I go to skooch over to make space for the 2 of them and the waitress tells us that my friends are not allowed to sit with us and must wait to be seated at their own table! Really, it's their restaurants policy.. In ALL of my years of dining experience I've never ever heard of such a stupid rule... Not wanting to make a big deal of it we ended up getting up from our table and moving over to a new table to sit with them a few steps away..

I almost walked out because of the smell but then I thought I'd give them a try anyway. The waitress was nice and attentive. \n\nI ordered a Winter Warmer beer. It was darker - creamy and kind of sweet. Very good. I also ordered the \"special\", which was a breaded pork sandwich. The sandwich was not very good in my opinion. Dry and not much flavor. They cut my sandwich in half without asking first - a serious breach in etiquette! The fries were soggy.\n\nI would stop in again for a beer if they figure out how to rid the place of the smell. I would not go there again to eat.", "author": "Christopher H."}

Ever since I broke out of that shell and started sampling different brews, I have really developed a love for beer. \n\nFor Father's day, I came to the Magnolia Brewery with my Dad and some friends for beer and a bite to eat. We had been talking about good beer, so I decided to try a sampler. Although not printed on any menu, they will give you 6- 4oz. samples of any beer you choose. I won't bore you with my opinion of each beer, but I'm a fan of the Proving Ground IPA, Ruby Mild (Dark) or Billy Sunday. (See http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tdPIuXJrcjH17SQn-H_mZw?select=xR17GHziC_wq_wP3yZRP-A)\n\nTo start we had the Devils on Horseback, blue cheese stuffed dates that are wrapped in bacon and broiled so that everything melts just perfectly together. Very Savory. We also ordered the plate of pickles, that did not contain any pickles - but pickled beans, carrots and such. \n\nFor our meals, some of us split sandwiches and burgers with fries- which was a perfect amount of food. The Prather Ranch Burger was a hit and so was the Fried Chicken Sandwich, the fries were okay but not crisp. They were really nice about plating them up for everyone and splitting the fries.\n\nThe food was excellent, we all were really happy with our selections and had fun sampling each others meals and beers. Now I know exactly what I want next time, two of everything. :P", "author": "Rebekah T."}

We decided to come here on a whim on an afternoon when we were both feeling a little under the weather. We were staying a few blocks away on Page St. so this was a convenient option while we explored Haight-Ashbury area. I guess it served its purpose. \n\nThe food, though, just wasn't that good. I got a burger, which was $17 after adding cheese and bacon. I'm from Washington, D.C. so overpaying for a hamburger is something I regrettably do quite a bit. If you like a good hamburger and enjoy eating out, it's just unavoidable and I get that San Francisco ain't cheap, either. But if I'm shelling out that kind of money for a friggin burger, it better at least be good. What I got here was awful--well-done, even though I had ordered it rare, and I think I remember some sort of sauce that came on it that I could have done without. I would have sent it back but we were in a hurry. \n\nThey were also out of tea, which sick little me was pretty bummed about. \n\nOn the positive side, the Scotch quail eggs that we ordered as an appetizer were great. We were also able to sit outside on really nice day. Although it took a while to order, our food came out pretty quickly and the service was friendly. \n\nBottom line: San Francisco has so many good restaurants from just about every price point imaginable. Especially if you're on vacation with a limited amount of time, this place just isn't worth it.", "author": "Tyler B."}

We ate the pickle plate (good) the scotch quail eggs (amazing) and the cheese burger (good). Whatever mustard they use is delicious. On the pickle plate there was only 1 half of an egg and I could have easily eaten a whole one... Or two!  The quail eggs were soooooo rich  and crunchy and the sauce on the plate was extremely good. The burger is a fair size and comes with a trio of dips/sauces and a delicious homemade pickle. 4stars because the beer was $$ and the burger was $16.", "author": "Taylor P."}

It truly is one of the most unique brunch dishes (with a southern twist) in the city!\n\nThe leading character of this entree is the oh so sensitive and delicate pork belly.  Soaked in a semi-sweet, semi-tangy BBQ sauce, she is laid to rest on top of a hunky portion of cheddar grits.  Typically, I am not a fan of grits because of its mushy texture.  Magnolia's grits, however, is an exception as I love how it gradually dissolves in my mouth after every bite.  With every fork stab of the pork belly, you must have with the cheddar grits!  As if that's not enough, there are two poached eggs that compliment and support the protein and starch.  My favorite part is slicing them and letting the yolk run through the grits.  For those of you who love Eggs Benedicts as much as I do, order Bearnaise sauce (a relative of Hollandaise sauce) on the side.  I dabbed a little bit of it on the poached eggs to give it an extra kick of richness.\n\nAs disgustingly full I feel after finishing 90% of the BBQ Pork Belly, a side order of Brown Sugar Peppercorn Bacon is mandatory.  Sticky, sweet, salty, with a hint of spiciness.  It's to die for.\n\nFunny thing is - Magnolia's is very well known for their selections of beers.  I'm not a beer drinker so I'll be coming for more of what I love - brunch!", "author": "Judy C."}

They have both a decent sized bar and a lot of table seating if you're going to eat something... and a few tables outdoors if you don't mind being sent back inside at 10pm when the city sticks it to them.  The vibe is airy vintage, including those exposed filament bulbs I'm a sucker for.  It's pretty loud in there, but this actually means you can only hear your own conversation.\n\nThey have a menu with some true delights and a and large selection of beers on tap, both regular draught and cask.   (And they thankfully list the \"bitterness units\" of each beer on the chalkboard beer menus.) Winners:\n- Blue Bell Bitter, which they call \"bitter\" despite having only 30 bitterness units.  Supremely well balanced which is probably why like 100 Yelpers mentioned it.\n- Sara's Ruby Mild, which is just a little sweet and utterly delicious.\n...and from a separate tasting at the Beer Hall SF for SF beer week, I can report the following are also incredible, crushing their respective 4-entrant categories (at least in my humble opinion):\n- Oysterhead stout - superbly balanced and smokey\n- Kalifornia Kolsch - light and almost like apple... great if you must drink a \"light\" beer.  (Somehow I thought it tasted like PBR when I had it in the pub itself...  weird)\n- New Speedway Bitter - this did not taste at all bitter, or like a speedway, actually :) and it just had a hint of woodiness that made it go down extra smoothly.  (Incidentally, I had this here before and it was a little funky or sharp... weird.) \n\n\n- Food! The Pork and Cheddar Sausage was aMAZing, with a lot of the work done by a perfectly paired super crispy potato pancake and sour cream.   Also, their burger is fantastic here, though to be fair the only time I had it I was not paying close attention because I had just \"finished\" B2B.\n\nI've also had some other things here, some better than others.  Commence completely disorganized paragraph following reasonable topic sentence.  The Proving Ground IPA proves indeed that it is possible to score 100 bitterness units. I tasted every one of them.  My friend somehow loved this.  The sturgeon entree was decent, with the tastiest bites coming from the more seasoned top edge of the cut.  And the apple pie was perfectly tasty, but not that different from others you might have had.  The oysters were excellent but pricey.\n\nPour me a Blue Bell, Magnolia.", "author": "Aaron M."}

What struck me was how nice the customers are. As we stood at the bar to order our beers, people happily moved out of the way so we can order in peace; love the consideration and awareness. \n\nReturned today as it was a beautiful warm sunny day, perfect for outdoor brunch. Unfortunately, we were advised that no liquor is served outdoors due to a permit issue so we sat inside. Solid, easy service and our food arrived promptly. The hangover fry was delicious (altho I didn't have a hangover) and enjoyed the caramelized onion and bacon combination on the eggs. The oysters were lightly fried so that I tasted the oysters. There is a homemade hot sauce which isn't too spicy or sour, but had the right amount of sweetness to it which we promptly used on everything on our plate.\n\nMy favorite beer right now is the Chocolate George Stout (5.6% alcohol which is on the lower end of typical stouts) and tastes like liquid dark chocolate; perfect to savor slowly. \n\nThe bathroom is a bit of a conundrum and I observed a guy trying to open the wrong door. I won't reveal the secret behind it so you'll have to stop by and check it for yourself. Overall, a good place to catch up with friends and enjoy another perfect sunny SF day.", "author": "Sophie C."}

She looked around a couple two person empty tables and was about to tell me it'd be a wait, so I asked her if I could order food at the bar.  \n\nThought it to be odd that the bar was empty and yet I sat there, wallet in hand, making eye contact with every staff member that passed by. They'd rather organize newspapers instead of pour me a beer. I waited 15 minutes, more or less, at an empty bar until I got to talk to someone. \n\nI asked if they do flights and he suggested pints since it was $4 Tuesday.  I found that helpful since I wanted to try a kask and I didn't want to pick out 6 beers when most all of them are bitters and IPAs.\n\nExcited to try kask drawn beer so I ordered Saras Ruby Mild. (Only 3.4ish % abv, I love the big beers but you gotta have your small ones too). It was very good and I like the slightly warmer temp and little to no carbonation of kask style. \n\nFood came out fast. You can peak in the kitchen window from the bar and it looked like they were working hard.

After passing by this place so many times on the bus on the way to other eateries in the Upper Haight, we decided to finally stop in for a late lunch.\n\nMagnolia's has a very cozy, neighborhood, atmosphere and is a nice spot to grab some drinks and some food and catch up with friends. My boyfriend and I really liked the ambiance and the overall decor of the place.\n\nThe menu had pretty standard pub food and we opted for the fish and chips. I've usually had cod when I order fish and chips, but at Magnolia's they use flounder. The fish was great and it was even better when paired with the tartar sauce, which had a ton of lemon flavor. The fries were amazing! We were also given a garlic aioli dipping sauce that was pretty tasty. The only complaint I have is that for the price of the fish and chips, $16, I wish they gave you more than two pieces. \n\nMagnolia's is one of the better places to grab a bite on Haight so you can't go wrong with stopping by here.

This joint was actually pretty good. \n\nWould I ever call my non-Tuesday experience \"homey\" or \"neighborhood\"? No... it definitely felt like the Grateful Dead were playing music over a trendy night-time hangout -- Jerry would have need to been out of his mind to handle the hustle and bustle. That was odd and disheartening for someone who grew up listening to his father talk about the neighborhood he was born in.\n\nThat said, I did enjoy my pomegranate cider way more than I thought, and my partner's chicken breast was actually a juicy half a chicken, flavored mildly but quite nicely, with garnish. Good! In comparison however, my \"steak\" was more like the slices off someone else's steak... the same price on the item, but vastly different portion sizes. Why would you do that? Just make me pay more for the steak or cut down her portion and make it cheaper, because there was no way she was eating that chicken on her own. \n\nMy steak was also ordered medium rare, and I ended up with a nearly-raw piece of steak with some ugly unrendered tendon in the middle. It was edible, and had a solid jus underneath it... but that plus the 2 tiny potatoes and the oh-so-\"I learned this on Top Chef\" broccolini made this plate not worth the price at all. My British friend and his companion both said the fish and chips were just good... nothing really amazing. \n\nWant to drink craft beer and be seen by other people who drink craft beer? Want to pretend the Haight isn't a dirty place? Magnolia will suit you nicely. I'd go back... I'm just in no rush to do so.\n\nHow is the average price range $11-30 as listed on yelp, but their cheapest entree (the burger) is $16? To make it under $30 you'd have to have a cheap beer and the cheapest app. Either folks are basing their prices on just drinking, or aren't paying attention to Yelp pricing rules. Average?

When we got to MAGNOLIA PUB & BREWERY at 12:45pm on a Saturday, there was understandably a wait, we put our name in and the Hostess said \"it would be about 20 minutes\". After about 25 minutes, we asked the Hostess again and she said \"well, it would be about 20 minutes\"... okay. Someone else from our party went in to ask about the wait and a different Host (I think he was the manager) said it would be about 5 minutes and sure enough, we were seated in under 10 minutes. I have to admit, as we were walking to our table, I heard the original hostess tell another customer that the wait would be \"about 20 minutes\" - ha!\n\nMAGNOLIA is hopping, a very lively joint with good energy, a strong bar and a nice looking room - it's easy to see why their place is so popular. They are known for their beers and their \"Chocolate Stout\" did not disappoint but we were here for Brunch so on with the food. The meal for the four of us consisted of a SCOTT EGG (covered in sausage and served with a spicy/smokey Romesco Sauce), FRENCH TOAST (great cinnamon bread covered in roasted pears and bourbon whipped cream), CHICKEN HASH (a massive pancake of hash covered with two eggs and pancetta strips, surrounded by salmorejo sauce) and the BBQ BELLY & GRITS (slow-cooked BBQ Pork Belly in a sea of Anson Mills cheddar grits, topped with a poached egg & fried shallots!\n\nWhile I am usually a \"savory\" person, the Cinnamon French Toast was an absolute knock-out, a feast for the tastebuds but very decadent as one friend said \"it's good but its too much like dessert\". The Chicken Hash was great and the addition of crispy pancetta always makes anything taste better. While the Pork Belly itself was tender and flavorful, I found the grits to be somewhat flavorless with extremely little to no cheddar taste at all. Finally, the Scotch Egg was good but only one for $8? I found it too expensive for what you got.\n\nI will go back to MAGNOLIA, it's a good space with decent service and an original brunch menu worth having again.

I can offer a perspective of continued experience and exposure here.\n\nFirst of all, if you live in San Francisco, Magnolia's is one of the MUST GO places.  You haven't been fully indoctrinated into the life of the San Franciscan until you've been properly acquainted with Magnolia's.  Nestled into the corner of one of the most famous streets in the world, Magnolia has a force field of awesome that repels the riff raff and nonsense that surrounds it.  Literally, I don't know how they do it-they don't get tagged, you don't get harassed waiting outside, herds of tripped out hippies don't hang on this corner.  The only way to explain it is there must be a magical force field.  That alone is enough to come in.\n\nThe lighting is just like the perfect amber beer, bright enough to illuminate everything but dark enough to add a little sexy to the atmosphere.  \n\nI like bitter beer but I'm not a fan of Proving Ground IPA, it's a little too bitter for me.  They offer another IPA called \"In With The New\", it's outstanding with even a sweet finish-rare and well done for an IPA.  \n\nPomegranate Hard Cider might call out to the ladies but don't be fooled girls-this is a ferocious biting cider.  Don't be had by the \"pomegranate\", expect a fierceness here.  This is like the perfect drink for a super man's man that just found out he is allergic to gluten.  \n\nCypress Brown is malty and carefree.  It's a tasty brown ale.\n\nSara's Ruby Mild is slightly punchy.  \n\nFor breakfast lovers who are partially committed to lunch:  SMOKED PORK\nAND CHEDDAR SAUSAGE 15.\nhash browns, sour cream, green onion, fried egg \n\nTuesdays they do a special of fried chicken.  I don't care who you are or where you're from, I travel for a living and this fried chicken is unbeatably orgasmic!\n\nThe fish and chips or the burger are great staples they offer with minimal risk and are both far above average.  Though, the fish and chips will feel like simultaneous weight-gain while you eat it.\n\nFor dinner:  THE BRICK CHICKEN.  Do you like chicken?  OF COURSE YOU DO.       BRICK CHICKEN 24.\nhouse made fennel sausage dressing, toasted \nalmonds, dried cranberries, cranberry glaze\n\nDon't be a jackass and eat for several hours when it's busy.  There is a communal table you can always hop on to finish with some beers.  Contrary to popular belief, this is not a \"hipster\" hotspot.  It's far too expensive.  The crowd is a good collection of new college grads and young to middle aged adults that are finally making a living.  The staff is nice and attentive.  They are not uber friendly but they are on top of it and they will never blow you off or ignore you rudely.  \n\nLastly, if you order dinner you get a special surprise with your check!

Magnolia falls into that category for me.\n\nIt's much smaller and less in-your-face than many other brew pubs, but that's also all part of the charm and experience that you're signing up for.\n\nLocated in the historically counter-culture hub of the city, you expect some level of funk going on here. In truth, it more resembles a traditional Irish pub than it does an acid trip. \n\nLet's talk beer. So I've been here on two different trips into the city. The first was after getting good recommendations and the second was an intentional hike into the city from a work trip in San Jose, for quality beer and food. \n\nThe beer will not let you down. They tend to have mostly English style ales, but there are always a few surprises on tap. Their range of IPAs are great, as are their varied bitters, a type that seems a lot of breweries don't really dive into. \n\nOn my last trip, I definitely was that strange dude. Sitting at the bustling bar alone, I bellied up, not caring, and ready to have a memorable meal. And I did just that.\n\nI started with an IPA, then decided to get my taste buds going with a cheese plate of local California cheese (when in Rome, right?) Then as my second beer was arriving, I went all in and went for the fish and chips. As much as I wanted to pretend I was going to get a healthier option, seeing that golden brown delicious planks of fish being served to the guy next to me just broke me. So I gave in and enjoyed every last bite. \n\nFor being a small place, it can get really, really jammed really fast. But, be patient grasshopper, and it'll be worth your wait. The bartenders are pretty efficient and quick and can find a hole in the crowd to serve you.\n\nAs I write this, as happy hour draws nearer, I just wish I was en route to Magnolia right now.", "author": "Chris S."}

The first 3 beers I tried to order were either sold out or out of season--time to update your menu, guys. The 2 beers I did try were good; the IPA was pleasantly hoppy without being overbearing, but the quadrupel wasn't as flavorful as some I've had. \n\nFoodwise, the Devils on Horseback appetizer--goat-cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon--was tasty if a little too sweet, and at $6 for 2 seem overpriced. The burger was actually excellent! It's tough to balance juicy with the need to hold the burger together, and these guys nailed it. Desert, on the other hand, was pretty forgettable, though their espresso is top-class.\n\nOverall damage $50+tip for 3 courses, 2 beers and an espresso. Not cheap eats by any measure, but given the quality and location isn't obscene. Will probably be up for another go next time I'm in town.", "author": "John D."}

I tried both the draught and cask bitters, and liked both. Did I say the beer is good?\n\nFirst time there was eleven days ago. Had two bitters, one draught, the other cask, fish and chips. Wish the \"chips\" were more like the thick cut (i.e. 5/8 inch) British pub style. For a place doing British style ales, could be more authentic. Their's here are more like MacDonald's fries, but not as tasty. \n\nThe place is somewhat crowded and noisy. I managed to get a stool at the bar; I was alone. Not a place for an extended conversation, but perhaps to enjoy an ale with someone who appreciates a good craft brew. Overall, I liked the atmosphere, and the service was good.\n\nThat first visit, I was impressed with the fish. Wasn't cod, but the flounder was two pieces of a good size, crusty on the outside and flaky on the inside. I enjoyed this visit and anticipated when I might return. Had a British friend visiting last week, and was disappointed we couldn't get there.\n\nThen, today, I managed a couple hours, after lunch (to miss the crowd). Ordered a cask conditioned bitter, fish and chips. The ale was as good as I remembered; the chips the same, but I could live with them. I was disappointed with the fish; still two long pieces, looked smaller than eleven days ago, not as crusty on the outside, not flaky (sort of mushy) on the inside. Didn't enjoy them anything like before.\n\nI hope today was a fluke. I'd expect more consistency. I'd have given them a five after my first visit; but based on today, it is more like a three. I'll probably try again; I'd like more consistency, and something like my first experience. One can hope. \n\nBut, the beer is good!", "author": "Glenn F."}

Ordered a very flavor-able stout, and the Magnolia Burger (medium) with fries. The beer was excellent, as I watched the dregs of Haight pass by - though I felt kind of guilty that I had in-front of me an $8.00 beer. The burger came after an appropriate amt. of time, with a side of mayo, whole-grain mustard and ketchup. I'd say the burger tasted very fresh, but had quite a bit of grizzle in it, and was served more like a meduim rare, rather than I how had ordered (no big deal). Eating it, however flavorful it was - was a challenge, as it was hand -formed, but not flattened - it was a lump of burger meat - obviously made with no care, or thought going into the process at all.  In the end, there was so much juicy stuff (tomato, and lettuce with some kind of sauce) that the bun fell apart as I tried to eat it all. The fries, looked like the broken pieces of left over fries - probably not fresh as they were more than crispy, and shattered when I tried to spear them with my fork. Bottom line - WAY over priced for the \"quality\" of food that was served to my table. Really - $26.00 for a burger, fries and ONE beer?

There were the three servers, all gathered at the food pick-up station, goofing around and having their own little party. OK, I've seen this before at other places, so I'll just be patient. Finally, one of the guys takes my beer order, but continues his silliness with his female co-worker. He's holding onto my beer while chatting and giggling with her, while scratching his beard and hair, with my beer in hand. Dude, what is keeping you from just handing my the drink? Why must you continue to chat and play around while I stand there? Normally you'll see this at a grocery store, when the clerk stops midway through ringing you up to chat to the co-worker...you're standing there thinking, \"am I invisible here?\". \n\nAt this point I just walked out. Obviously it's more important to continue the silly conversation with the co-worker than to take care of the customers!\n\nNormally, a great place. To the manager:\nI'm sure you don't like seeing money walk out your door.

The hills (and probably the drinking from the night before) about killed me, and by the time I got here, I was definitely ready for some food.\n\nDecor wise, I totally get now why people have been telling me that Old Granite Street in Reno was heavily inspired by Magnolia - the dish towel napkins, high back wooden booths, chalk board menus, and the like all reminded me of Granite.\n\nIn any case, I ordered the Chicken Gravy Breakfast Biscuit, which is a biscuit topped with a fried chicken thigh, cheese, egg, and gravy, and it came with a side of potatoes.  The fried chicken was fantastic, and I can see why it's popular, and the potatoes were spot on.  Unfortunately, the rest of it just sort of fell flat - more gravy probably would have helped, and while the cheese, egg, and biscuit were all good, the whole thing did not seem to come together - in fact, the parts were better than the sum.\n\nOn the other hand, my step-sister did the English breakfast, picking the bacon, two eggs, and the bubble and squeak (mashed potatoes fried into a patty, and containing bok choy that morning).  The bacon was perfect - thick slices, nice and peppery, and perfectly cooked to give it a satisfying crisp, but not to the point where it was crunchy.  The bubble and squeak was tasty as well, with the nice contrast in textures with the fried outside and the mashed inside.\n\nUnfortunately, due to my revelry the night before, I wasn't in the mood to drink, though I did see some amazing looking greyhounds and the California Kolsch looked refreshing as well, and I really wanted to try one of the many IPAs.\n\nWhile I'd probably give my meal 3 stars, my step-sisters was good enough to get the place 4, and I definitely want to go back to try some of the libations, as well as a few of the other items on the menu.", "author": "Ernie C."}

Alas, fifteen years ago, I was long-haired, tie-dyed, spun-out, and hanging out on the Haight St.  Thankfully I sold out: cut my hair, put away the patchouli, and learned a few trades besides hustling grilled cheese sandwiches on Grateful Dead tour.  \n\nMagnolia and the gentrification of the Haight are symbolic of my own personal transmogrification from a clueless hippie-kid into a more or less fully functioning adult.  We all have to grow up sometime--even the Haight.  So it's little wonder that I love Magnolia.  \n\nAmbience/Atmosphere:\nWith only a light dusting of 1960's nostalgia (something that could have easily been overdone), the place always seems warm and open.  Its weathered antique look belie an attention to cleanliness and detail that don't come easily.  Even the noticeable water damage on the ceiling and poorly fixed cracks in the walls somehow give the place a rustic resonance.\n\nThe graphic design is clever and subtle: collage art mixed with a series of original sketches.  Lots of psychedelic eye-candy without being overwhelming.  Again, a palpable sense of detail.\n\nFood/Booze:\nI've never had a bad meal here.  Everything always seems to be on point.  This particular outing I had the eggs and bacon (again).  Its a peculiar rendition of the classic American breakfast staple.  Pork belly and scrambled egg served as an open-faced sandwich on a house-made bagel and drizzled with maple syrup.  I said:  \"Goddamn!\"\n\nWash that down with a half-liter of their notorious Proving Ground Pale Ale--cask brewed on-site in the basement--and you have a perfect breakfast.\n\nService:\nThe only word I can use to describe the service is \"stony\".  Clearly getting baked before work is a job requirement here.  I'm actually alright with that.  Mellow bartenders and servers beget mellow customers.  This I like.  So, sometimes you may have to remind the bartender that you like to drink beer.  Or water.  Or that you exist at all.  But, don't take it personally.

Surprisingly, instead of a \"not bad, don't like that one, that one is good, ew what is this\" I went thru the options with hardly any I disliked. This stood out to us since we visit a lot of breweries. It was strong beer month so our sampler was guided by that. He loved the Rye Rye Rocco and I enjoyed the Pride of Branthill. Great flavors all around. \n\nMet some nice folks sitting next to us an struck up a convo. It was such a fun, friendly atmosphere.\n\nOur waitress was great and mindful of the order of food since we were sharing most dishes. My husband, who eats the four-leggers, enjoyed the pork nuggets.

Cows are tasty critters, anyway, but when you do it right...people come back.  \nMy only negative thoughts would be that the service (though always super friendly and cool) can get rather sluggish at times, as this place can get Hella-busy.

Served with a tangy catsup that was a combination of curries and bar-b-que sauce with slight bitter notes that sang through the sweetness. The artisanal IPA they brewed complimented the sausage and fries with suave efficacy. The spiciness of the currywurst didn't overpower the delicateness of the rabbit of which it was composed. Dinner service features a little bit different menu targeting the slightly sophisticated palette while maintaining the corner pub feel.\n\nThe waitstaff were helpful and know their beer selection well.

I also liked they had a few good beers, but maybe would have liked more variety. \n\nI really liked the ambience and that it was a low key bar with an old time-y feel almost, with great window-facing bar for people watching.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I've gone here before and after the new management (I think that was a year ago or so). First few times it was good, not fantastic or anything. Then one beautiful brunch a year or so ago I went there when the new managers had taken over. I got pork belly over home fries (don't get excited they don't have it anymore) and good god I went somewhere. In fact, that pork belly took me about a thousand miles past the acclaimed pork belly sandwich at Bar Tartine. It was fantastic. Why in gods name did they get rid of it? \n\nFortunately, they didn't get rid of the burger. God was the burger good. No really, YUM. It had blue cheese on it, and I just could not stop eating it even though it was my date at the time's food. Oi Vey, mama mia!\n\nLater I went back to Magnolia and had a long lasting brunch with my friend from Seattle. I say longlsting because we did not stop ordering food. We had miyagi oysters, bacon wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese, and poached eggs with asparagus. That was just some of it. There was something so simple about everything, but so damn good. My friend was surprised that she hadn't heard of Magnolia while she had lived in the bay area. I told her that I had just rediscovered it myself, and that I was planning on coming back for more. And more. And more. And...yes...more.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

I love this place. Great vibe, very local feel to it, always a good selection of beers and choice of cask or draught. Nice selection of IPAs, bitters, and lighter beers for beer weenies such as myself. The Kolsch that comes in a tiny class is really perfect when you just want something light and easy. And the food is great! The fries are amazing and I recently tried one of their spicy sausages. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I love everything on their menu.\n\nOnly things to be aware of: one, at evening time they often will not let you sit down without a commitment to multiple entrees from the group (as in, not a few apps to share - more expensive plates). I've been turned down for a table more than once even when the restaurant was fairly open.\n\nTwo, not a great date place if you're just grabbing a drink. This place gets LOUD! And it's loud in a good way - lots of fun, relaxed, happy people grabbing a pint and catching up. But it can be quite noisy.\n\nGreat place to have on my corner and I like supporting these guys.

Instead of listing every restaurant that I currently approve of in the area, I'll just let you know that I think Magnolia is doing things right.\n\nOwned by the same crew that runs the Alembic, they've been able to capture a similar neighborhood following as their brethren about three blocks to the west. Albeit completely different styles, they've obviously got their hands on the secret sauce for captivating a community.\n\nMagnolia is a great neighborhood pub serving up comfort food and good beer. Some of those hoppy creations are brewed on-site, while others derive from a variety of different Bay Area microbreweries. On the food tip, the do most of the bar bites you'd come to expect, and they do a pretty great brunch. Nothing is bottomless, but they do have chicken and waffles! The best part about their chicken is that it's boneless. You can almost pick up your waffles to create a fried chicken sandwich without having to compete with those pesky bones. \n\nThey have a pretty cool patio area outside also, so on a nice day like the ones we've experienced recently during our late summer, it's a beautiful way to spend a lazy Sunday.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

K asked if we could be on the list for a table since we wanted to eat rather than just have beer. Other people weren't clear about this and were, yes, annoying, but we weren't. Also, when you're in a people-based industry you kind of have to grin and bear it/go withe the flow/suck it up and deal. This chick missed that memo.

I didn't shut up about them. For main courses we had three different things: mom had the baby back ribs. According to her they were the best she's ever eaten and my mother LOVES wings. I told our waiter this when he picked up our plates at the end. He said, \"Our food is good.\" ?! Oh, well. I already knew there was an attitude in this place, why do I allow myself to be surprised?

It's partially because their beers tend to be a bit too hoppy for my tastes, which beer purists would argue is the point.  But I do get to have my own preferences.  The one time wheat beer was available it tasted like 25% water.  I can drink a lot, but couldn't drink that.  The burger is tasty, but not quite the wonder many position it as.

Twice a month, it's fancy dinner time.  This week, we picked Magnolia, having never tried it before.\n\nSpoiler: I would come back for beer and dessert.  The rest was fairly average.\n\nTo start, we had Devils on Horseback: goat-cheese-stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon, with a kolsch gastrique.  Delicious!  But you only get two pieces for $6, which seems kind of ridiculous.  \n\nThe pickle plate was pretty good: pickled asparagus, bell peppers, jalapenos, cucumber, an unidentified pickle (jicama, maybe?) and grapes.  Definitely more value for the money there, and the pickled grapes had a great tart-and-sweet flavor.\n\nFor the entrees, we ordered a crab and bacon stuffed trout (me) and braised short ribs (him).  The trout is served whole, prompting me to think of the Fish Heads song the entire meal.  While cooked perfectly, with lots of crispy skin, the flavor of the crab stuffing just wasn't my thing.  I didn't get much bacon flavor from it - or crab, for that matter.  It was served atop \"melted leeks,\" which appeared to be braised - very good - and with a grilled lemon half.  The grilled lemon had a lovely flavor, which brightened the dish.\n\nThe short ribs were tasty, but about halfway through they became overly salty.  The highlight of the dish, to me, were the tiny braised baby carrots and the horseradish cream.\n\nBeer: I had the Gruit and he had the Saison de Lily.  Both were good - I preferred mine, an herbal, caramelly bourbon-barrel-aged dark beer, over the Saison, which has forever been spoiled for me by The Bruery's Saison de Lente.  \n\nDessert was excellent - the chocolate bourbon pot de creme was rich and sweet, served with whipped cream and chocolate cookies that had a sprinkling of salt.  \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive, despite what other Yelp reviews mentioned.\n\nIf you go, skip the big entrees and get beer, dessert, (I think the Gruit would be great with the pot de creme) and maybe the pickle platter.

I managed to sneak in here after the rush (always helps to eat off hours). Got a table without too much of a wait (and boy can it get crowded). It's a pub for sure, with a variety of characters. Service was decent. The food was all right but nothing too remarkable. I tried the Hawaiian albacore sandwich. Some how when they split the sandwich half of it did not get the olve tapenade or sliced cucumber and was actually quite bland. The other half was far taster with the condiments. The portion size was generous. The chocolate bourbon pot de creme...(well you had me at bourbon) was quite disappointing. The texture was not creamy or whipped. It wasn't very chocolatey and it looked like it was made in someone's home kitchen (but not in the artisan way). Certainly didn't get the same batch as the other Yelpers did, because this was a fail. I'll have to get there earlier and try the brunch menu.\nThe beers... well then, that's really what you come for. With a hearty portion of 20 ounces, you can't go wrong. They've got a great selection and the cole porter was delicious.\nA very dark brown, appearance. Nice coffee and some bitter dark chocolate aromas. \nTasted mildly bitter but smooth finish. Mouthful of robust flavor. For drinkability I'd say this a smoother porter for the bitter profile and quite enjoyable.\nPS. Bathrooms in the restaurant were a little sketch.

We were told that the wait for a table was 15 mins (not bad at all) but we chose to sit at the communal table where there were a handful of open stools.\n\nI made an immediate trip to the little girl's room and was pleasantly surprised... very clean & well stocked restroom, awesome subway tile, fun trough-style sink, and a stocked shelf of clean hand towels.  I like this place's style already.\n\nI returned to the high-top communal table to find my brother talking to Sal, our server.  Now, I got an instant good vibe from Sal.  He was very laid-back and unpretentious, dressed in a casual v-neck and jeans.  I like that there was no apparent dress code for employees... they're comfortable, we're comfortable.  Sal instantly impressed me as he was super knowledgeable about the menu and brews, as well as incredibly attentive to our dining needs.  He answered our numerous questions about the menu, gave great recommendations, and provided impeccable service throughout our meal.\n\nMy brother and his girlfriend both ordered brews from the large chalkboard drink menu.  Sal even brought over a sample glass of another brew that he recommended.  Not ever being a beer drinker, I veered towards a Sunday brunch staple--a mimosa!  It came in a regular wine glass, was slightly pulpy (perhaps freshly squeezed orange juice?!) and was champagne heavy.  Love.  The others seemed pretty happy with their brews, although my critique wouldn't be fair since I think beer tastes like soap.  Heh.\n\nAlthough the brunch menu was being offered, which was full of amazingly exotic sounding dishes, we all steered more towards standard lunch items.  I ordered the pub burger--because, let's be honest, you can tell a lot about a place by their burgers.  It was, hands down, THE best burger I've ever had.  Although, ringing in at $14, it might have to be a \"special occasion\" burger.  And the fries, even thought they're such a minor detail, were crispy and salty and delish.  We pretty much ate in silence, with the exception of the occasional \"Mmmm...\", \"Wow...\", and \"Oh my god...\"  Yes, it was THAT good.\n\nA few other noteworthy items... The music was on point!  I mean, who doesn't want their brunch soundtrack filled with the likes of Bruce Hornsby's Mandolin Rain, Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight, etc.  Reminiscent of Mike Tyson in the Hangover... \"This is my favorite part coming up right now...\" {insert amazing air drum solo} Yeah, that happened, in between bites of pub burger.  It was pretty amazing.  Also, each table is given water glasses and an old label-less wine bottle full of water.  It was another unique touch that I noticed and appreciated.\n\nAll in all, it was an exceptional dining experience.  I'll be honest, I don't love the Haight... personal preference I guess.  But I will definitely make a trip back to the neighborhood to visit Magnolia.", "author": "Jamie H."}

Other than that, our 2 hour wait would've been really really sad without alcohol to keep our bellies full. I ordered the trout and it was waaaaay too over salted. I'm talkin' salt shaker in my mouth. Def not worth the $22. The bf's burger was cooked medium rare but it had the consistency of really undercooked meat. Not the kind that is oozing blood, but if you've ever made homemade burger patties by mashing ground beef together, you know the consistency. It broke apart in my mouth like raw mashed together meat. It wasn't very bloody at all. Just pink and raw. No juice to it whatsoever. The service was so-so. It took a while for our food to come out of the kitchen. They were really busy, but I noticed almost none of the tables around ours had food on their table either. I'd say skip the food and just go for the beer, but their bar area was pretty packed the whole night and we had to play human tetris every few minutes.", "author": "Lily Z."}

I did try a bunch of beers though, including four from Magnolia and two or three guests. The Magnolia beers were all... mediocre at best? It's a shame, I really wanted them to be awesome.

After waiting near the door for a while, we finally asked someone who looked like they may work there if it was just open seating at the community high-top near the bar. She kind of shrugged, grunted something to the effect of sure, and walked away. Cool. We sat... and waited a while.... and then finally asked someone if we should order at the bar or if there was a server. She told us there was a server, so we waited. And waited. And waited.

But that restaurant was booked and I veered off course a bit.\n\nWhen I came to the SF Bay Area over 20 years ago, I was very fascinated by the Haight Ashbury. Largely due to the fact that as a teen I devoured any and all information I could find about the \"summer of love\". Books, movies, music - you name it - I loved it and it made we want to move here.\n\nShortly after I arrived, my husband and I got into riding vintage Vespas, wearing vintage clothes and sipping classic cocktails at Club Deluxe. We spent hours just roaming in and out of all the unique shops, having breakfast at the Pork Store and relaxing in Golden Gate park.\n\nYears passed, we moved out of San Francisco and setup house in the East Bay, had a couple of kids and I realized we had precious little time for roaming around any neighborhood - especially one as frenetic as the Haight.\n\nBut this visit made me realize the only thing you need to turn frenetic into fascinating again is a well-curated plan or a willingness to just wing it. \n\nEither way Magnolia Pub and Brewery is well worth a visit. This is NOT your typical pub - they say that right on their menu.\n\nIt is a very vibrant and warm space filled with an eclectic crowd - just as you would expect in this neighborhood. They brew their own artisan ales on site and source an incredible array of fresh, sustainable ingredients for their hardy menu items. Try the house made sausage and beach fries which are seasoned to perfection with Old Bay spices. You might want to go on $3 Tuesdays when all pints are just $3 all day and night.", "author": "Michelle S."}

Seriously mouthwatering, and unlike anything I have ever tasted.\n\nAnd of course the beer is delicious as well, although it is also on the pricier side. Even for a brewery.\n\nBut then comes the downfall of Magnolia. When I brought my mom and brother from out of town to Magnolia a couple days ago, we were instantly blown off by the waitress. We told her we came for a few beers and she completely brushed us off, telling us to go sit at the stool-seating section where there was obviously only one or two seats left, and not even near each other. I had planned on getting an appetizer anyway, but I knew then that I had to make my agenda very clear to the waitress for her to show us any interest or give us a seat at the booth we were already standing right next to. Mind you, this was only 2 pm in the afternoon. They weren't particularly busy.\n\nOnce the waitress decided we were worthy of her time, she gave us a seat at the booth.\n\nThe fried pig ears were lackluster.

Classy but relaxed, and a nice beer selection.\n\nAnd even after receiving the brush-off, it seemed like a good choice. \n\nUp until the point where the cockroach came out of its hiding space in the booth that we were seated at. Right next to my mom's head.\n\nI'm not one to make a scene, so we simply moved everyone's belongs to the opposite booth seat to ensure that we wouldn't be wearing the filthy insect later on, or throughout our lunch.

Oh did I mention they always have a shitload of beers on cask?\n\nOK the food. If you're a mostly-vegetarian like me maybe you won't be in love with their menu because it's definitely meat-heavy. But, that doesn't mean there are real bright spots for veggies. Right now they have a killer quinoa hash breakfast option which is pretty much just like what my sister-in-law would cook on her farm. Their pancakes always hit the spot and lunch-wise I've enjoyed their salads for sure.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the place gets crowded but come on, so many of the best places do. Just time your trip accordingly if that's not your thing.", "author": "Paul C."}

Beers were good and plentiful (still are) and there was a warm, welcoming ambiance.\n\nFast forward 4 years.  Prices have gone up significantly, the menus look more \"artisan,\" and the beer selection has gotten better, but the menu, to a veggie, is very spartan.

Were the walk-ins right below us? Is there an earthquake? But we kept drinking and forgot about it.  \n\nWe shared some oysters and a cheese/meat plate. Only thing that was a little bit of a downer were C's brats - the server was either preoccupied/high/too busy and forgot to place his order and ended up ordering it on the fly. We were a bit disappointed since the brats had grill marks, but tasted like they were re-boiled/microwaved. Bummer. \n\nI would love to come back and try their beers.

My sister and I were finishing up an afternoon of shopping and were famished. I had been very curious about Magnolia since it's ALWAYS packed when I walk by, so we decided to take a look inside. Magnolia's outside appearance is definitely deceiving; I expected it to be similar in feel to Squat & Gobble down the street. Instead, I found myself faced with a very cute pub with high leather booths, tables, and happy people all around.\n\nThere was a bit of a line, so we placed our names on the list. (I love that the list is written on a chalkboard near the door.) We didn't have to wait long and were seated along the back wall close to the kitchen where all the action was at! Okay, so I am a sucker for well designed menus and consistent branding. Major props to Magnolia for menus that match the mirrors, coasters that match the paper on the menus, and amazing graphic design in general (see photos for details). I knew that unless the food was sorely lacking, this place was about to win my heart.\n\nWe ordered the beer-battered onions to start. The flavors were good (would have been more awesome with beer, but my sister is underage so I refrained), but it was difficult to eat. The onions were left as bouquets of a sort instead of easy-to-eat rings and were hard to cut through. Not a huge deal, but worthy of note.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the burger. The fries are really good and came with a heaping, ultra-dippable saucer of ketchup. The fish was also pretty tasty. All around good dish. The burger came with freshly-grated mustard; I don't even like mustard and I kept dipping my fries into it. We had a lot of fried food that night but didn't feel gross and greasy afterwards--good sign.\n\nThe portions are big, so we were pretty stuffed after all that food. Still, we couldn't resist getting a dessert. We ordered the Magnolia Beer Sundae, which includes Bi-Rite \"the other one\" ice cream (very creamy with lovely hints of beer), toffee bits (amazing), whipped cream, caramel sauce, AND a chocolate chip cookie. It was really really good.\n\nStill haven't tried the beer, but my hunch is that this is definitely more of a place to drink with friends than one to have a dry dinner at. Still, our meal was very enjoyable and I'd go back for sure.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Our group ordered a casked Prescription Pale, a brown, and the Cole Porter, and passed them around. But okay is rough going in the craft brewing business - as we sat there and sipped, we found ourselves missing the Toronado a couple of blocks away. They just weren't that memorable, although the Cole Porter was the standout.\n\nOur server was courteous, but a tad aloof.

The key word here is \"novel.\" Everything about the place is presented as somewhat offbeat or just a tick below avant garde -- from the \"wine on tap\" to bacon-on-everything--but, ultimately, the execution is poor, and the quality is so-so.\n\nI ordered the cheese board, and was left wondering how and why those particular cheeses had been selected over so many other (even local) cheeses that are more distinctly more interesting. The selection seemed utterly random as well as needlessly narrow. For dinner, I had the snap pea ravioli, which was fine, but would have tasted better if it hadn't been so overpriced, at $18. I also tried the wine-on-tap, which was also fine -- but clearly more novelty than quality.\n\nMy fellow diners, being good sports, ordered the fried pig ears which they said were surprisingly bland and could have benefited from salt. Again, more novelty than quality. They appreciated the effort (they are much nicer about these things than I am) and overall enjoyed the meal but admitted that things could have been better. \n\nWe didn't bother with any of the bacon-ized desserts. The wait for the table had been too long, and the food too mediocre to justify extending our stay.", "author": "Catherine T."}

The space itself is nothing to get too excited about; it's a barebones affair that seems to fit the neighborhood, but doesn't necessarily fit the upwardly mobile leaning menu.  First, though, about the beer: I tried the darkstar mild and the bourbon-barreled belgian single.  Both tasted as the waitress described, though neither really rocked my world.\n\nThe Prather Ranch hamburger, however, was a revelation.  No joke and no hyperbole.  The burger was cooked *perfectly* to order (medium rare) and was 10x more flavorful than any burger i've had in recent memory.  It reminded me how flavorless most other burgers can be, but this was perfection.  Comes with carmelized onions, lettuce, and a pickle; my only nit was the lack of a tomato.  The fries were good, too.  We also tried the beet salad, which was excellent as well.  \n\nThe menu boasts house made sausages.  I'd like to try them, but I don't see how I can possibly go back and not get the burger again.", "author": "Laurence W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-19", "description": "I have a barrel of conflicting feelings about this place. First off, I came here ONCE before they re-modeled to an upscale, high-priced gastropub. Oh yeah, did you know that they were basically just a specialty sandwich/burger beer garden with hippie decor? You didn't? Next time you go in there, pay attention to the faint strains of Phish and Grateful Dead bootlegs playing over the house stereo, their last vestige of hippie-dom...\n\nAnyway, I ordered some awesome sandwich whose contents I cannot for the life of me remember, a delicious beer, and paid just under $20 for my share. It was that kind of joint, not at all dissimilar from the perennially satisfying and unfussy Triple Rock Brewery in Berkeley.\n\nThen they fancied the place up. And started serving DISHES. Like a RESTAURANT. I was sad. BAH, I exclaimed--I just wanted good sandwiches and beer. Determined to give it a fair chance, I tried dinner there. It was OK. I ordered a fancy sausage that wasn't enough food to fill me up. But it was about the same price as one of their sandwiches previously. :/\n\nSo I started poo-pooing the place. Boy, was my girl tired of me poo-pooing this place. Considering the menu had expanded, we opted to give it another shot, for brunch this time. I have two things to say about that, one positive, one negative: 1) you have to order home fries separately from your dish, 2) fresh doughnut holes are served with an apple glaze on top. You know which one is which.\n\nRight about now, you're wondering, \"after two 'meh' experiences, why go back?\" Well, this place is SO close to my house, it's required a Herculean effort to avoid it. But avoid it I did as it was not pressing my buttons. Be that as it may, I was planning to meet friends for beers and suggested Magnolia as our spot. After all is said and done, they do pour a solid imperial pint steps from my front door (I do GRR a bit at the $6 price tag but it IS 20 oz).\n\nMe and my friends order some stiff IPAs and their charcuterie plate and friends, here was the wingspan of Magnolia in its full glory at last. The meats were divine (including a succulent and juicy chunk of pork belly) and the beer a perfect hoppy companion. Snacking and beer-ing as an exalted act, this was.\n\nACT 4 (in which our restaurant continues to redeem itself): we went last night and got to try the Thursday fried chicken special. Best fried chicken I've had in SF, bar none. Such a delicious crispy, buttery crust bursting with moist white-meat chicken. The best part? I ate the whole 2nd breast with no bones remaining (sure, there may have been some cartilage in there but it was all too deliciously fried to refuse!)\n\nThe math washes out to 3 stars in my mind. This place is never less than crazy busy so they need my opinion like...a thing that's not really needed. All things considered, this is a place to enjoy selectively. Not everything's a home-run, or even on-base, but what's good is very, very good. Cheers...", "author": "Alee K."}

Not even a salad--while they have two, one has fish and the other bacon on it. There's a veggie entree, but it has cheese in it.\n\nA couple of times, I've asked them if they could make something vegan, and they will if it's just a matter of not putting cheese on a salad or something, but they're not willing to go out of the way at all to accommodate vegans. For kids, they will make a grilled cheese or cheese pizza.\n\nI would come here far more often if I could eat here; it's just not practical to come in for a drink if you have kids with you.

Having worked in a restaurant before, I don't think that it's hard to check on your section and make sure they have what they need.  Our server passed by our table several times and failed to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything.  We ran out of ketchup in the middle of the meal and waited close to 10 minutes before she even walked by again.  We noticed that tables in other sections had sat down after us andhad their order taken way before our server came over to check to see if we were ready to order.  Not that I was in a rush today, but I hate waiting around, especially if I have a hangover and I'm hungry.

I reallyyyy enjoyed it here.\n\nFirst off, it seems like this place is generally super busy because we were quoted a 45 minute wait on Thursday evening around 9pm. Maybe get there earlier if you don't feel like waiting. Regardless the vibe is super cozy and warm. Really welcoming too. The decorations are simple but provide a great ambiance.\n\nI REALLY liked the food. It was kind of pricey (hence the 4 stars) but what I had was worth it. We started off with goat cheese-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates which, yes, is a super trendy dish but yummy none the less. I mean, come on. It combined 3 of my favorite things! The bacon was really crisp while providing a nice balance to the sweetness of the dates. The real winner, though, was my seafood boudin served with dirty grits with tasso ham. Oh my god yum they were so good. The boudin was cooked perfectly. Not burnt but still crisp and kept the seafood sausage juicy. The grits were also really really good, which is amazing because I am really god damn picky and particular about grits. Everything about the dish was just awesome. My friend's burger was really good too but we both agreed that the seafood boudin was incredible.\n\nThe beer was yummy too. The IPA was a bit on the generic side but had a nice pine bite that I actually enjoyed (I am not the biggest pine hop fan). The ESB was nice and mellow, subtle yet smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed the beers.\n\nService was fine. Nothing exemplary but not bad. I mean, it was super busy. She was definitely good with keeping us content.\n\nIn a nut shell, if I could pack Magnolia into my luggage and take this place back to Philly with me then I would in a minute because I am greedy and want this place near me forever.\n\nEDIT: We went back for brunch the next day and YUM YUM YUM. It was so good. I ordered pork belly served on top of cheddar grits with 2 poached eggs. Yes, it was sinfully bad for you but it was delectable and I do not regret eating every single bite of it. Paired with a really delicious and refreshing pomegranate cider and I was a happy bumble bee. I love this place.", "author": "Lauren D."}

Since last we met, the place seems to have undergone a sustainable-organic-local foods revolution.  I was skeptical--but hungry.  \n\nThe beers arrived quickly (we took recommendations from the server, who knew her microbrews), and directly on their heels, the best calamari I have ever eaten--tender, beer battered, heaven.  The beer batter is the simple genuis here.  Just trust me, go get it.  Even you, wrinkling your nose and going \"eww, squiiiid!\"--GO GET THE CALAMARI!\n\nThe fall mushroom pizza was notable mainly for the mushrooms, but it's not the pizza's fault--after that calamari, I would have been underwhelmed by creme brulee served by talking dolphins.  \n\nBonus points: the kitchen is open til midnight (at least on weekends).", "author": "Dana S."}

Sweet, tangy, and bacon!  It's basically a goat cheese stuffed date wrapped with bacon.  The Shrimp Toasts was more of a nice snack then an app, and the $8 pricetag was sort of a turnoff.  They literally just spread some shrimp paste on sliced bread, not a crustini or something that would seem fancier.  And they had 4 pieces, which really equalled to 2 slices of bread.  \n\nThe pork chop is one of the better ones I've had in the city... it looked like a steak actually.  Bacon jus... yeah whaaat?  Awesome!  The chicken breast dish was really hearty as well.  How did they get the skin to be so crispy w/o dettaching it?  The mini corn muffin was an excellent part of the dish too... not only did it taste great by itself, it was a great way to sop up the juices and onion soubise.  \n\nThe beers were all very great, but were not cold enough!  Especially the coveted ones from the cask.  I need a nice cold tall one... once it warmed out, it was a chore to sip.  \n\nWaitstaff was extemely helpful and loved the casual vibe Mag Pub offered.

When I asked the waitress to tell me about their beers, she gave me a dirty look and pointed to the board with the beers written on it. I guess \"tell me about your beers\" translates to shut up and read the sign. Rude. \n\nOur party ordered coffees for brunch. They finally brought them out after we finished our meal... Usually I enjoy coffee while I'm waiting for my brunch, not as I'm paying the bill. We ordered a grapefruit juice, and they brought orange. It took 15 minutes to get it switched out, and of course they charged us for both of them.\n\nI asked for a bottle of hot sauce. They finally bring it to me, and it's completely empty. The bottle was clear glass, so they could have seen this if they actually had half of a brain. I got up to find another one from the kitchen and big surprise, they were completely out. What kind of brunch joint runs out of hot sauce. Really? Have you ever heard of the concept known as 'inventory'?\n\nWe had 3 different servers over the course of our meal, each one as rude as the next. It was as if taking your order or bringing you food was really bothering them. Waiting to be served there was about as exciting as watching paint dry. The food was terrible. The potatoes that came with the breakfast looked like pieces of an old leather boot due to sitting under a heat lamp for god knows how many hours. Even if the potatoes had been good, the serving size was about 3 or 4 small pieces of potato. You could have eaten them all in one bite. Last time I checked potatoes are about the cheapest thing you can buy. So when paying $15+ for a couple of eggs and potatoes I would expect a little more. \n\nAgain, the main waitress that served us was really annoyed by the fact that we were ordering food in a restaurant. I suppose it's not my fault she hates her life. The restaurant takes no care in their service, food, or customers. I guess that's why you got 80 cents as your tip. Whoops. Try being nicer to the people who pay your paycheck. That's what you're there for. Ehhh there's a lot more, but I feel that I've wasted enough time on this place. Don't bother.", "author": "Rob M."}

They served the hamburger nicely - we asked for it to be split between two people, and they brought out two plates, each with a half serving of fries and perfectly divided, medium rare burger. The fish and chips were nothing exciting, but were well prepared, especially the perfectly fried fish. The vegetarian sandwich was more disappointing - I wondered how it would be, given that the description on the menu didn't seem too exciting, and that was exactly how it turned out - a mess of vegetables with some tomato sauce on bread.

It was rather busy when I arrived, so I sat at the communal table which had an open stool. It took about five minutes for anyone to offer me anything, and then it was just the original host that suggested I sit there offering water... Not a menu, and not a beer. Some more minutes later, I finally met my waiter and he provided a menu and a hazy inaccurate description of one of the beers I asked about. I placed an order, and then waited another ten minutes for the beer, and twenty for the burger.\n\nThe food was great, and apparently their bacon is maple flavored, though the fries were a bit weird (all crunchy) and needed ketchup. The beers though... Meh. I tried the Deep Ellum Dubbel and the Proving Ground IPA.\n\nIn short: slow service, a stoned waiter, mediocre beer, and decent food.

We got to our seat at 550 pm and placed  our order for beer and food at 605 pm. The place was busy so we were patient on the long wait to put in our order. We ordered beer and dinner at that time, pork chop, shepherd's pie and fish and chips. They brought our beer in about 5 minutes. Then,We waited almost 45 minutes, and saw a few other tables order, get their food, and leave in the interim. We finally were able to flag down our waiter and ask if we had been forgotten. He said let me check. He came back 5 minutes later and said the pork chops take about 45 minutes to cook. We said, ok. At the 1 hour mark, he brought our food to the table. The $18  shepherd's pie was like canned soup with mashed potatoes in the center. The  $25 pork chop was cold and raw, but the cornbread pudding on the side was awesome. the $7 fish and chips on the kid menu, however was excellent. When we called the waiter over after trying for 10 minutes to get his attention to show him the bleeding pork chop, he said it was a  the. Latest culinary style to serve the pork at 80 degrees in the center! I looked it up, it's supposed to be 145 degrees. We sent it back to the kitchen to be cooked the rest of the way. On the return, it was much better. By this time it's 7:45 pm. Wow-the waiter did apologize and comped us for the meat.  We got our check and escaped by 8:15.I don't know what was happening in the kitchen, but my husband was verbalizing his refusal to ever go there again.

These are as good as any in North America.  Most cask ales in North America are hop bombs and unpalatable.  However, Magnolia has wonderful and subtle BB's and ESB's.  Furthermore, on tap, their Milds are outstanding.  I could very easily come here just to drink and leave happy.   If you like Bitters and are in Halifax, NS, go to Granite Brewery.  Excllent.  Another treasure in North American real ale.\n\nFood:C- \nDreadful.  Trying hard to be creative but not achieving what they set out to accomplish.  I had rabbit sausage and felt bad for the rabbit because it was surely more interesting when it was in its cage than it was in its casing.  Furthermore, their appetizers all sound interesting, but that is all. Very similar to what one finds in most British pubs:  they have all gone fancy to try and offer something special, but for the most part cannot deliver.

Wow I actually got a table!!\n\nThe waitress came over and this is how it usually starts with me at Magnolia; so how is the Rosebud?  Oh we ran out so I'm not going to tell you....hmmm....which is when I start to frantically look at the menu trying to find a reasonable alternative.  I will say the Sara's Ruby Mild is a great mid-beer, if they have it in stock, they have ran out on quite a few visits.  The Pumpkin beer was also very smooth and not too pumpkiny.  Finally, I do want to know why magnolia beer is $6 at Magnolia and $4 at Toronado?  anyone?  anyone?  \n\nSo food, wow they now serve sausages, 5 different kinds, always a star in my book.  I didn't eat the sausage but my friend said the linguisa was very good.  I personally really enjoyed my oysters, another new edition to the menu.  The curry flavored nuts were also quite delicious.  \n\nI would like to give Magnolia 4 stars but I can't just yet.

It just seemed so picturesque and fitting for the moment.\n\nEnter Magnolia. It was the Monday after San Francisco's beer week (which I highly applaud and consider to be a personal holiday---right up there with, say, Christmas) but Magnolia was doing it big and keeping the strong beers on tap. I may be a small girl, but I'll always go for the hoppiest, the darkest ales, or the brews with face-smacking ABV's. \n\nWith that said, I ordered an Oysterhead Stout as a warm-up, and was very pleased that my server obligingly gave me a quick background check on the beer and how it is brewed (which, btw, whole oysters and shucked shells are actually INCLUDED in the brewing process of this once...awesome?!) My boy ordered the Prescription Pale, and we decided to round it all out with fries.\n\nNeedless to say, our quick pit stop on haight turned into a full on feast, and we followed up with an order of the Quail Eggs in Sausage, and the notorous Devils on Horseback.

The Mad Mead Maker was a home-brewing, mountain biking fanatic... and picked this place for our first lunch \"date\" - an odd location for me, since I can't drink... no matter what the W. Girls preach about Pepcid AC. \n\nDespite my depraved rants and raves on Yelp... I am actually a very sentimental person - but that's strictly between you, me, and millions of other Yelpers. Shhhhhhh. I found myself here with Caveman after an impromptu I'M REALLY HUNGRY walk following a post-op check @ the UCSF Kidney Transplant Clinic. \n\nIt was a strange feeling, to cross the threshold again... Present day: the MMM and I are both very married (not to each other, of course!) but I glanced at the table where we sat together. I would have taken a moment to digest the feeling of revisiting the place, but the bidness of putting food in my belly at the only gastro pub in the Haight was more pressing. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n* Berkshire Pork Cracklings: sent them back - they were the consistency of plywood. As someone in the Dental Field, I suggest you skip them, unless you have excellent dental benefits and are willing to risk fracturing a tooth all the way down to the root. \n\n* Devils on Horseback (goat cheese stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon) - they were okay, but for a paltry order of 2 and a $6 price tag, I'd rather eat a superior version at AOC - also $6 for 4. \n\n* House Made Jerky - they were out of or discontinuing this item \n\n* Pork Nuggets - unremarkable finger food... \n\n* Bierwurst - decent, but easily forgettable \n\n* Mortadella - ibid \n\n* Chorizo - I asked the server which vendor they use; she returned with the answer of Fatted Calf. Big Fat Lie; it was not. It was Soria brand, pre-sliced, and I resent back of the housers who LIE to me about what they're serving. \n\n* Picholine Olives - nothing to write home about \n\n* Butternut Squash Fritters w/ brown butter aioli: These were bland, tasteless, and served with a side of seasoned BUTTER. I pointed out the consistency and taste of the \"aioli\" - and our server stuttered that it's their proprietary recipe for aioli. It was herbed butter and was absolutely not aioli, which still couldn't have redeemed these fritters. \n\n* Humbolt Fog - standard; local; met my expectations \n\n* Shelburne Cheddar - sharp and tasty... \n\n* Old Kentucky Tomme - I'd order it again... \n\n* Watercress & Apple salad - necessary roughage, but completely forgettable \n\n* House Black Cherry Soda - nice; authentic... \n\n* House Root beer - ... but I liked the Black Cherry better! \n\nThe reconfigured and more polished gastro pub feel is a nice idea IN THEORY. The famed murals are no longer up... the seating arrangements are different, and I think the concept of a cool, neighborhood brewery with good eats was a solid idea. \n\nThey just didn't deliver... but maybe I'll revisit again when the clever website is reconciled to what Magnolia is actually serving.", "author": "Kim D."}

In fairness, the bread pudding was pretty delish, but my mushroom-chicken sandwich was, for $13, pathetic. Barely any meat, too much blue cheese, flavorless undercooked bacon and bread that was tough as an old shoe. I'd suggest they focus less on serving esoteric (albeit certainly conversation-worthy) items like bull balls and instead get the basics a little more down.\n\nAs for the beer--mine was good, but the variety my server recommended was far too bitter for me (I asked for something like Bass and got something like Guinness instead).

And when there's a bit of a wait, it's worth it. \n\nI wish I could drink beer, but I can't, so I'll focus on the food instead. I go to Magnolia when I want Devils on Horseback. And then, because bacon begets happiness, it all evolves from there. The sausages are divine, and Magnolia has a way of pairing them with perfect compliments. I usually have an \"eyes bigger than stomach\" experience here, but that's okay because the leftovers are lovely. \n\nMagnolia's dinner menu tends to have enough options to accommodate my high-maintenance allergies, and the servers are generally very nice about having to deal with me. The brunch menu, however, is a little more difficult for me to pick from. This morning I ordered the scrapple, not knowing what it was, but assuming that it was merely a combination of the sides listed under (poached eggs, bacon jelly and potatoes). Well, you know what they say about assuming. I made an ass out of myself. My face fell when the plate was placed in front of me and I realized that a \"scrapple\" is, at very least, something that is breaded. Our server obliged, took the dish away and replaced it with a menu. I reluctantly pointed at my second (only other) choice: the quinoa hash. But I waaaanted bacon jelly! I was pretty bummed about the whole thing, I think I even made a face when he brought it out (because deep down inside I am a 6 year old). I don't love quinoa and I had wanted MEAT with my brunch. But here's the kicker: the quinoa hash? Ridiculously delicious. I mean blow-my-mind delicious.

The place was packed and the wait for a table was 20 minutes. The hostess suggested we sit at the bar while we wait for our table, so we did. We managed to find a seat at the bar and my friend ordered a beer. It was \"Strong Beer Week\" and a lot of the beers they were brewing were not of my taste, so I didn't have one at that point.  After we finally got our table, service was slow. I did end up ordering one of their strong bitter beers but the food took FOREVER to come out and by the time it did, I was D-R-U-N-K. My bad because I hadn't eaten all day, but their bad for taking so damn long with my food. We also ordered the quail egg appetizer, which was DELISH. Quail eggs wrapped in some sort of ground meat, then fried. They were very tasty.\n\nThe food finally came and I wasn't disappointed. My friend ordered the sausage sandwich. I had a bite and it wasn't my thing, but he loved it.  I ordered the fish sandwich with fries and it was really good. The fish was battered perfectly and the tarter sauce wasn't too bitter or overwhelming. I asked the waitress for a side of aioli, but never got it :-( The waitress was very nice though, had a good attitude and apologized a few times for the delay on our food.

We look forward to the Thursday when we get there before they run out of fried chicken.\n\nBut beware, Magnolia is very hit-or-miss.  I do not recommend the scones for brunch; they are too dry and lacking in flavor for being $8.  Also steer clear of the bland grits and pork belly (previously, they had a similar dish with crispy pork belly and black eyed peas; this was MUCH more delicious).  \n\nService is also hit-or-miss.  Today we waited 45 minutes for our food without our waiter even stopping by in the interim.  I almost lost it but our food finally arrived (unfortunately for me I had ordered scones), and our waiter comped our drinks.

After a few swigs of our ice-cold craft brewskies we ordered two of Magnolia's house-made sausage entrees. My boyfriend stuck to the \"basics,\" ordering Bangers n Mash.  But this Bangers n Mash was not your ordinary British fare.   A huge and juicy banger lay atop a pile of black garlic mashed potatoes dripping in onion gravy and with garlic chips as edible d\u00e9cor.  Reminiscing this dish is making me ravenous...so I'll move on.  \n     I chose the Lamb Sausages served over a surprisingly rich creamy cauliflower puree and topped with a piquillo peperonata. The insanely moist sausage had a great kick and played nicely with the mild flavors of the cauliflower and the tanginess of the peppers.  This is not your standard pub fare people.  If ever in SF, in the land of the hipsters, go here and get the sausage....as well as the award-winning beer (duh). \n   My only complaint?  Servers weren't the nicest folks...not rude...just a bit bland.  We also have a very slight suspicion the sausages were umm...old because we felt pretty sick a few hours later.

Magnolia Pub & Brewery (referred to as Magnolia from here on out) always has solid brews and good eats, but there's two things especially that the world should know about.\n\n1) Three Dollar Tuesdays (formerly Two Dollars Tuesdays). Get a pint of delicious brew for $3? I'm in. Try the Cole Porter, it's the best porter in the city. Better than Anchor.\n\n2) Fried chicken. Once a week this place has fried chicken. Usually on Thursdays. Ask ahead. What makes it better than other places? They de-bone/de-joint the chicken quarters (leaving on the delectable skin) before frying. It's fried chicken quarters that you can easily cut through with a knife, or pick up and tear through with your hands if you're feeling like a caveman. Served on a bed of any number of beans (usually black eyed peas, but they use whatever they got) and with some cohnbread.

In theory I was OK with the re-frying. I didn't expect a brand new piece of chicken since most of the first serving was untouched. \n\nHowever what I did expect was that I will not be charged for the raw, or the twice fried chicken. Oh no... first we were handed a check with our meal charged in full, and after protesting they took $5 off. Seriously, when we just spent $45 for two???!!!!! \n\nThe waitress claimed it was the most she could do, and walked away as soon as she handed us the new check. We took that as a signal that there was no further negotiation available.\n\nHaving worked in food services once upon a time, I know what it bitch it is to have a meal sent back and I try very, very hard to not do it as a patron.

I considered informing her it was she with the potbelly, not myself but resisted less she order the cook to spit in my food.\n\nIt was at that time time I informed my dining partner that if one more person spilled beer on my shoulder I would start slicing off hipsters' shaggy bangs with my butter knife.\n\nWhen the burger arrived, it seemed small. The onions appeared shriveled. The cheese looked stingy. My comrade in arms implored me to \"just eat it, you'll love it.\" And she was right. It was a terrific burger. The perfect burger? No... I was momentarily disturbed to the point of shouting when a shaggy haired female spilled beer on me then proceeded to mop up my shoulder with a napkin I had previously used to blow my nose.\n\nSo, the result: noisy, crowded, annoying clientele, expensive ($90+ w/ tip for two burgers, an app, a side, and three drinks!), but the food was great. And I left full. And, there were some attractive girls with whom I would have eagerly conversed, had I not been claustrophobic. Sad.", "author": "Ross S."}

I think it's my fave Restaurant in the city (without getting all fancy).Located right at Masonic and Haight.\n\nThis spot is really good for late night eats. They say open until 1am on the weekends. They also do an amazing breakfast. The food & beer here is really really good. If they still have the Brew Sampler hit that up. It gives you 5 beers from the lighest they have to the blackest! It's hands down the best Microbrewery that I have ever been to. This place is pretty well known in the city. So there is always a full house but everyone puts off a really friendly energy. \n\nSometime last year Magnolia rehauled their interior and their concept. I haven't been back since this overhaul but I hear they haven't lost their edge. From what I've seen of the menu it looks like they raised the prices a tad and edited the menu so it includes more Beer friendly pairing items (charcuterie, sausages, etc.) and is heavily Southern influenced. I think they might have a new chef now because in the last 2 years the menu has become increasingly Southern versus just good New American eats before. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing just something to be aware of if you don't like cornmeal crusted okra or fried chicken sandwiches.\n\n\nYou can take any of the bus lines (6,7 etc.) or the N-Judah Muni to get to Magnolia's. If you are driving it is doable. You just need to find parking in on of the off streets off of Haigth. Also sign up for their e-newsletter if you live anywhere in the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-05-04", "description": "Alright, so my previous review said you can't beat beer prices here on Tuesday, and while that is still mostly true, I have something to gripe about. This arbitrary line drawing at \"strong beers.\" So my favorite place on a Tuesday disappointed me. Ordered something new off the menu, Pride of Branthill (9.7%abv). Sounded good. Everything I have ever gotten here was $3 on a Tuesday so long as it was a house beer. Why would I think it would be any different yesterday? Well it was. I was disappointed getting a bill that I expected would be $6 and seeing $14. Apparently the strong beers are never on special. BS. And when I asked what a \"strong beer\" is the answer was, \"one that comes in a goblet style glass.\" Dare I ask how I know what kind of glass it comes in based on its listing on the menu? Fearful that the answer would be, \"when it's a strong beer\" I decided not to. Furthermore, the website even says \"$3 Tuesday: ALL [emphasis added] house beer $3, all day, all night!\" No caveat about excluding \"strong beers.\"\n\nAnyway, simple math will make anyone realize how stupid this distinction is. So my usual go to, the Proving Ground is 7%abv. They pour it in a 20oz glass and only charge you $3. You can see where I am going with this. The Branthill comes in a 13oz glass, and they charge $7. Even on Tuesdays. So for $14, I can get 26oz of Branthill. Because it's \"strong,\" it's full price. Alternatively, I can get 100oz of Proving Ground for $15 because it is \"not strong\"? This is an arbitrary distinction. If you want to charge different prices for your house beers on Tuesdays based off their strength, you should be telling your customers ahead of time. It's good business practice. Don't tell someone \"ALL\" your house beers are $3, \"all day, all night\" when they aren't.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the beer is still great, but I most likely will not be returning for a while.", "author": "Alfredo A."}

Turned out not to be a meal really worth repeating.\n\nI ordered the Home-Made Sausage Sandwich, which had good constituent elements. The sausage was tasty, the peppers and sauerkraut were flavorful... but the bun was a disaster. It had already fallen apart before it got to the table. I ended up having to eat the soggy thing with a knife and fork, which ruined the experience for me. Making matters worse, the stout I ordered was not what I considered a good stout. My beer adjectives are not what they should be to write a proper review... but in the words of Diner T \"it's missing all the things I appreciate about a stout.\"\n\nMy fellow diners went off the brunch menu -- as the lunch menu offered only one vegetarian friendly option -- going with the donut holes and the crabcakes. The donut holes were good, but tiny. It was not a meal, and really ought not have been advertised as one. Diner T would end up ordering pizza an hour later. The crabcakes were more substantial, but a side of pancakes order at the same time didn't show up until the meal was almost over.\n\nBetween bad prep, small portions, and lackluster beer, I just can't recommend this place at this time... but I will probably give it another shot just to make sure it wasn't an off day.", "author": "Sean K."}

Exhausted, dehydrated, and a bit sore, we stopped in for munchies and a drink. \n\nTo start off with, I got the Wit Rabbit, and the boy got a Kalifornia Kolsch. The pork nuggets sounded intriguing, so we ordered that as well. The Wit Rabbit was exactly what I was looking for on such a hot afternoon. It was refreshing and light. The Kalifornia Kolsch was also refreshing, but it should be noted that it does not come in a pint glass! The glass it's served in is a mere shadow of a pint glass. This should be noted on the menu, so unsuspecting patrons don't think they're getting a normal pint. When the waitress set down the pork nuggets, we were appalled to see that for $7, there were three pork nuggets on the plate. Granted, this was an appetizer and not an entree, but three pork nuggets? So we savored them and made them count and had a pork nugget and a half each, and while they were absolutely delicious (the pork was tender and came apart effortlessly), they were not worth $2.33 a piece. \n\nWe went for a second round, hoping that things would improve. I ordered Sara's Ruby Mild, the boy went for a Blue Bell Bitter (which they replaced with something else, because they didn't have it on tap that day), and we went for the breaded spring onion appetizer. The appetizer was actually better than I expected, given that I'm not absolutely crazy about spring onions. The bulbs at the bottom were really succulent. The boy's beer came in a pint glass this time, so that was definitely a step up. My Ruby Mild was very Guinness-like, more malty and less hoppy, which I enjoyed. \n\nI'd come back for beer, but until they drop their prices on that ridiculous pork nugget appetizer, I can do without munchies.

Both times our wait has been significantly longer (like double what we were quoted.)\n\nThe food takes forever for large parties.  The last time it took almost 45 minutes from ordering till we got food.  After our hour and a half wait this was retarded.  What made it worse is that everyones food was cool when it came out - it clearly had been sitting in the back for awhile.  My order was wrong and I didn't notice it in the two seconds food was tossed down on the table.  It took me almost twenty minutes to get the servers attention again - one of my friends finally reached out and tapped someone running by.\n\nOur group undertipped (cause, wow, was the service bad) at 15%.  The server chased us down for her extra three bucks.  I've never been embarrassed about recommending a restaurant before.\n\nMagnolia's is alright for couples.

Their reviews were pretty good too, so I definitely looked forward to trying it out. The place was pretty busy when we got there- it was a late Friday afternoon. We managed to snag a table immediately, though aside from the booths, the seating feels pretty claustrophobic. It also oddly smelled of wet dog-- not overpoweringly so, but still, wet dog. Service was a little slow, but the place was packed, so somewhat understandable.\n\nWe started off with the IPA. Neither my friend nor I liked it. We felt that it wasn't hoppy enough and generally not an interesting beer. I slowly finished it while my friend made quick work of hers and gave the stout a try. Also a disappointment. It was a little too tangy and my friend hated it so much that I ended up splitting it with her just to finish it off and we still managed to end up having to abandon some of it (which is basically unheard of when it comes to us and beer).  We thought about getting a third beer to split and discussed getting the brown ale, but given the poor showing by the first two beers, we opted against getting another and moved on to another bar. \n\nDespite the disappointing beer, the food was excellent. We got the bacon-wrapped dates with goat cheese. It came as a pair on the plate, which was surprising to us and we'd hoped there would be more. After tasting it, we definitely wished there were more- it was very delicious. Each was about the size of an egg and perfectly wrapped with bacon. The sweetness of the date balanced the saltiness of the bacon well. As we were not too hungry, we split the burger and got it with blue cheese. The burger was very good, very juicy. The server even went ahead and cut the burger in half and served it to us on separate plates complete with our own pickle and fries. It was an unexpected gesture, but very nice of them. We ended the meal with a pot de creme. The chocolate cookies that go with the pot de creme were very good, soft and chewy. The pot de creme itself was good, however, it was a little too cold and a little too firm. Still very smooth and chocolatey though. \n\nI would return to this place for the food, but definitely not for the beer.", "author": "Jia min C."}

The portion sizes of everything was perfect.

They were crispy patties, soft on the inside.  Quite good.  My sides of brussels sprouts and grilled escarole were both oily and charred, and the oil, especially on the escarole, tasted like it had been recycled several times in the cooking process.  The char had the texture of sand, which makes me think perhaps it was charred dirt.  I couldn't eat it.  The only side they seemed to do well was the french fries.\n\nThe $5 thimble of curried mixed nuts had peanuts in them.  I don't mean to be a snob, but I find the taste of peanuts overwhelming and that they generally ruin a mixed nut medley.\n\nDessert, baffling enough, was mindblowing.  Do try the butterscotch pot-de-creme or banana bread pudding.  Holy shit.  The atmosphere being pleasant enough and the waitstaff being pretty friendly, Magnolia might be worth a future visit for a beer-and-dessert nightcap.\n\nOverall, the quality at Magnolia was very inconsistent.  I went here with a friend whose taste I highly esteem, and this is one of her absolute favorite places.  I had a fun visit because she loved the place so much and had a great relationship with the waitstaff.  The beer is quite good.  The menu is interesting, with much variety and the potential for greatness if you're willing to risk paying high dollar for gag-inducing food.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

And I eat enough to know that the soul of a restaurant doesn't come from having the same art work for a decade or worn out booths.

It's only a few blocks from my actual living room and they have much better food than anything that has ever come out of my kitchen. \n\nI know the service is slow and I will have to wait in the crowded bar area for a long time on a Friday night.

Beers were always good. My experiences there meant I was never going back. I heard they made some changes recently so I went to give it another chance.\n\nWow what a difference! \n\nI was never attached to the cheesy decor so I can't say I miss it but I can understand how others would. Things change, thats life, neither incarnation of Magnolia really truly represents that \"vibe\" people consider to be that neighborhood, but everyone has a right to their opinion. \nAll of the people whining about it are most likely 40 or younger which means they were not in upper haight drinking brews back in the day. \n\nThat would make them full of shit;\nThey just think they know what it would have been like, and consequently what it should be like, \nthey were spotty faced teenagers IN THE 80'S. \n\nDo they know that Magnolia was a Walgreens about a hundred years ago?\n\nThe new decor does seem unfinished though, those empty spaces on the wall need something, whatever it is, hopefully not the return of the Gnomes.\n\nThe food is dramatically different, and it in fact excellent. I was really impressed with the variety and depth on the menu, and everything I had (on 5 visits) has been awesome. \nI think Magnolia is one of the best deals in the city for that quality of food. It is really inexpensive when you consider you can get a house made sausage (5 to choose from) with two sides for $12, that in itself is a meal. \nPeople really need to stop bitching about the $14 burger. \nThey have no idea what it costs for ingredients these days and how much it costs to run a restaurant, NO IDEA! \nIt probably pisses them off that someone is using the words \"variety and depth\" to refer to the menu. \n\nThey just want the old days back, a simple menu, a cheap burger!! \nHow much did a burger cost in the summer of love?\n\nI understand peoples frustration at what has happened there, it is definitely very different, it has grown up it seems.\nAs to what happens it remains to be seen.\n\nRestaurants with good food and service do not always succeed. Magnolia now has good food but basically still has bad service.\n\nThere are many restaurants with bad food and bad service but they are hugely successful, the former incarnation of Magnolia was one of those, they always had good beer and; location, location, location!!!\n\nA lot of people grew up eating bad food and don't know any better, they are entitled to like whatever they want. \nThey also may feel more comfortable and at home in a place that is more casual and without aspirations.\n\nSuch a hard business, there is no formula that guarantees success. There is always someone that is unhappy.\n\nI suppose the lesson to be learned from Magnolia is that it had a working formula and loyal client base, and now they all seem to be pissed. \n\nThe new formula may attract a different group of people which will piss them off even more.\n\nThat might have to find somewhere else to eat cheap shitty food.", "author": "Lucius A."}

My month started out with a trip to 21st Amendment (also a great brewery/pub, see my review about it) and this time I made the trek to the Haight to check out this Gastropub.\n\nThe Beer: Why does Strong Beer Month only happen once a year? It seems criminal not to offer beers this good year round. I started out with the Tweezer Tripel, which quickly disappeared from my glass as I found myself constantly sipping it. Next, the Promised Land IPA, which I wanted to get \"out of the way\" since I'm usually not a fan of IPAs. This was by far the best IPA I have ever had (despite its high IBU value of 150, which I didn't even think was possible). I finished off the night with the Smokestack Lightning Porter, a meal in itself. I would love to come back and try some of their other beers.\n\nThe Food: The burger I had was to die for. The meat itself was very well seasoned and perfectly cooked and when topped with cheddar and bacon became the perfect accompaniment to my perfect beers. I hadn't eaten since breakfast, so after one beer I had already started to feel its effects and the side of fries was a welcome sight. My friend ordered the Fish and Chips (I make it a policy to never order this unless I have previously heard good things since you are usually bound for disappointment), which turned out to be the worst I have ever tried. Flavorless fish and batter, which had not been fried long enough so the outside was soft and chewy, is certainly not a recipe for success.\n\nEverything else: Service was exceptional. Our waitress was on top of things and very helpful and chatty which made for a great experience. The bar area can be a very tight squeeze and it was nearly impossible to order drinks since they only had one bartender working the bar and filling the wait staffs' orders on a Friday night! \n \nAs an added bonus, take a Growler of your favorite beer home to enjoy later (unfortunately, strong beer Growlers are not available).\n\nMinus one star for the aforementioned Fish and Chips and the tight/awkward bar area and slow bar service.", "author": "Ben K."}

On each occasion (two involving our table) customers were asked to move around, change tables, or just wait until somebody got the divine inspiration to take our order.  \n\nIn the late afternoon once, when the place was barely half full and there was plenty of staff there (most milling about behind the bar and chatting while we waited to be served), a pair of Dutch visitors were asked to please move AWAY from the 4-top table (ALL OF WHICH WERE VACANT AT THAT TIME, AS WAS HALF THE RESTAURANT) and move to a deuce.

Some, and they may be managers I can't tell, appear grouchy and cynical.\n\nThe food is 3 Stars.

I mean, I worship 1967 as much as anyone, but all the psychedelic flower-power murals (including Magnolia's) strike me more as historical preservation a la the Painted Ladies than a real statement of the Haight's attitude.  The Mission, Noe, even the Outer Sunset--these are all neighborhoods whose reputation is based on the day-to-day lifestyles of their present inhabitants.  But I can't for the life of me ever remember meeting an \"authentic\"  Upper Haightian.  And yet, it's a far cry from the tourist BS of Fisherman's Wharf too--case in point, a visit here does not induce nausea or despair.  So, wise Yelp, I ask you: what is the essence of the Haight today?\n\nAt any rate, the Haight is a good place to drink, and there's no better place to kick off the night than Magnolia.  It's hands down the best brewpub I've been to in the city (Beach Chalet is good too, but it's apples and oranges).  Beer flights served in awesome wooden holders?  Check.  Classic British staples like bangers and mash?  Check.  Fries with curry ketchup?  OH MY GOD that is good.  Once you go curry, you, er, won't be going back in a hurry? \n\nBeer selection is vast, with about a dozen different kinds brewed on site.  They have an Oysterhead stout, brewed with real oysters, but you can hardly taste 'em.  My favorites would have to be the Big Cypress Brown and Cole Porter.\n\nWe got a booth right away on a Sunday night, but it's a deceptively small place, and I can picture it being nigh on impossible to snag one at other times.

It could be that the name \"nugget\" conjure's up too much McD's guilty pleasure excitement, because the product we were served was fantastic at first bite but ended up a soggy, grease laden square of pressed together and fried piggy meat after it sat out for a few.

Note that pints are only $2.50 on Tuesdays!\r\n\r\nThe food is a big draw for me, as well. They have one of the best burgers I've had at a SF restaurant, cooked to perfection and preferably topped with blue cheese. Served with hot, crispy fries, the meal is complete with a serving of their addictive curry ketchup (you may have to ask for it). The steak frites as well as the pork chop are very good selections as well.\r\n\r\nIf you're there purely for sampling the brews, but perhaps you are a wee bit hungry, the plates for sharing are a good call. Last time I ate there, we shared the house-cured fish sampler which comes with a fresh assortment of local seafood, pickled vegetables, goat cheese and thin slices of bread. It was perfect to go with the couple of pints that we consumed.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning are their snacks, namely their plate of molasses glazed bacon. Best. Beer snack. EVAR.

Sign me up.\n\nI was taken here by a group of foodiefriends in SF and I don't think i stopped smiling after I walked inside.  The atmosphere was just great, dark, oaky smelling, kind of uncomfortably rigid seats, but it was AS advertised - a pub.  And it was cold and raining outside.  Perfect!\n\nWe started with two samplers so we could try pretty much every beer they made there.  Out of the 12 that I tried, i think maybe one of them i didn't care much for.  And it wasn't even the IPA.  I was DEEPLY impressed with the smoky flavored \"Stout of Circumstance\" and promptly asked when I would be able to order these in bottle form from home.  They said right now they haven't been able to keep up with the demands of the restaurant so until they move from a microbrewery in the basement to a different facility, bottling was out of the question.  Can't wait.\n\nThe food was delicious as well, I asked what our server recommended and she said to go with the burger.  I rarely order burgers at purportedly 'gourmet' places now (even though I love me some burgers) since they're either 'ok' or 'crappy' in my experience.  The Daily Grill in Irvine is an example - bleh.  This was a glaring exception.  This had to be the best tasting, most perfectly cooked medium rare burger I've ever tasted - with beautiful butter lettuce, a nice swiss on top, and fries that I could only describe as \"bigger, seasoned In - N - Out style fries.\"  I can't get over that burger, the consistency was just great - usually the juicier burgers fall soggily apart and the drier ones are crumbly and flavorless, this one was just perfect - it was unlike any gourmet burger I've ever tried.\n\nAnd for dessert - warmed chai spiced milk and assorted cookies?  Couldn't be better.", "author": "Ken P."}

Not that there's no market for the smell of stale beer.  I happen to own a very posh perfume made by Christian Dior called \"Miss Dior Cherie\" that smells exactly like the rubber wells used to catch the drips from the tap at bars.

Couples that look exactly alike.\n\nIt was a long long wait for a table.  I'm not sure exactly what the system was, no wait, I know exactly what it was, it was SUCK.  My BF and his friend had beers which were mediocre.  He's english and his friend is french so they know their drinks.  It didn't help that the minute we got a table, Freddy decided to spill the contents of his pint on to the table.  Or was it Rob?  I don't remember.  \n\nThe menu was not memorable.  Nothing sounded good and I'm the type who would at least find something incredibly unhealthy to crave.  I got the moules frites and later wished I hadn't.  Oh boy did I wish that I hadn't.  The toilet wished that I hadn't and the kitchen sink wished that I hadn't too.  Does that make it obvious enough or should I paint a picture?

When they got rid of all the lame 60's decor, I could not have been more happy.  Magnolia's new look is great, but there is still room for improvement.  \n\nMy first complaint is in regard to the music.  Although they updated their look and dumped the corny hippie artwork, their musical selections are still stuck in a different era.  Improvised jam band music does not play well in noisy restaurants.  What you need is something with a good beat that you can hear in the background.  Or even a playlist with a carefully selected sequence of songs that were recorded after the millennium.  If you play a song with a twenty minute bass solo in a crowded room, it is just going to sound bad.  Magnolia could you please update your stereo and hire a good DJ to do your music.  The Grateful Dead are legends.  No one listens to them any more.\n\nOn a more positive note, I think the menu has improved a lot lately.  It seems that there is food that people will actually eat on the menu again.  All of the bizarre quasi gourmet stuff is thankfully gone.  Also, the service was very good at lunch yesterday.

The napkins are dishrags- a decor element- and pretty stained, but overall the look is very cool. \n\nThe food however... we got really excited as we read the menu. There is a great beer and wine list, and the dishes sounded delicious! Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as we hoped. The dark sauce with the fried squid had NO taste. I'm not even sure what it was supposed to be. The watermelon with honey tasted rancid and not at all sweet and light. The duck wing plate was so odd- the wrapped figs had no taste even with the meat and creme fraiche. Just all so tasteless, very strange. The sausage main was ok, the beets were good, and the plating (in a shallow dish) attractive. The chocolate cake dessert with gelato had a wonderful texture and was yummy.

I feel like they are stretching the concept a liiiiitle too far. \n\nAnother time I went here and it was special fried chicken plate day! I LOVE fried chicken, but not for $18.

But I plan to return here on the regular, so they get 4. We arrived and put our name on the list for a table, then walked down the street for a quick errand. When we returned, got a table right away. Not too shabby. Our server was adorable and my roommates kept trying to get me to talk to her more so I could make a new friend in the city. I stuck to eating my lunch and drinking my 'beer' instead. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with french fries (not my healthiest moment) and a hard cider. The hard cider was delicious. Food took a little long to get to the table. The sandwich looked good. My roommates got a fried fish sandwich and the burger with a couple of beers. Theirs looked good. Although, I was happy I didn't get the fish sandwich - looked kind of plain. The batter around my chicken was over cooked, but that was not a problem cause I like it that way. Once I took a bite, bad news. One of those moments you wish you wold have ordered something else. I don't know WHAT the hell piece of chicken this sandwich was made from. Partially breast meat, partially dark meat and then about a third of it fat and slime and grizzle. I ate around most of the purple veins and gray parts that seemed to be Frankenstein-ed together in this thing. Seriously, one of the worst chicken pieces I have ever come across. Let me be clear - I still plan to return. I ordered the wrong thing or perhaps just got the wrong piece of chicken. I sampled the burger beside me - it was good but I think someone spilled a salt shaker on part of his meal cause there were sprinkles of salt all over the salad (if you call a mixed green handful with no dressing a salad) and on top of his burger. It was weird. \nAmbiance sold me here. I love the feel of the place. Loved our server. Loved the beers and the cider. The whole set up was fun. But I won't be ordering meat here again. I plan to come back and eat here again. Just no more chicken. \nWe even had dessert. They were tasty - but all the deserts on the menu were damn near identical! I mean to say - all the flavors were the same on each one. Those definitely need to be updated with something a little lighter and perhaps something with fruit. \nBill for three of us having lunch with three meals, 3 beers, and 2 desserts was $77. For lunch - that's about $10-$20 too high. But we were treating ourselves - even if my meal was bad. \nNext time - I feel a little wiser and will order something vegetarian.", "author": "Jena D."}

The constantly shedding-dish-towels-as-napkins wasn't impressive but annoying.\n\nAlthough their beers are good, the descriptions don't give you really any clue what they'll be like. A few of us had the fish and chips, and one got a sausage with the sides.  The other 2 with the fish each got a sausage, so at our table were 3 of the 4 types offered. They all thought they'd be good since they seem to be a signature item, but each and every one of them was so dry - and only one had some flavor on top of the dryness. Interesting that NO mustard or sauce was served with the sausage sides.\n\nGo for the beer and pass on the sausage.", "author": "Kristi M."}

I know what pub food is supposed to be - not gourmet but yummy. This was just not good enough. Ick.

My friend had a mushroom pizza that looked like it had a can of mushrooms dumped on it after it had been cooked. She was literally sweeping them off. \n\nMany in my party were annoyed at the service, but I don't think it was really fair to judge because it was a Friday night and they were swamped. \n\nHave a beer - but don't eat here.", "author": "M M."}

On a Tuesday night, a trip into the city sounded like plenty of adventure with none of the usual city weekend-crowds headaches.\n\nUnfortunately at the poorly designed Magnolia, a Tuesday night felt like a weekend. We arrived at close to 9:00pm to find a packed dining room and not-even-standing room bar. As a group of three we realized we would have to get a table, the wait for which was quoted at 30 minutes but took less than 10 when they graciously converted a two-seater to three. \n\nThat, unfortunately, was the last time we would not have to wait for something here. Having never been before, we understandably took more than one minute to read over the beer options... our server appeared to take our order but, when realizing we weren't ready, left, only to return MUCH later. She did not offer advice, a real draw-back for me and a beer place. \n\nLonger story short- the Cole Porter is excellent, as deep as you would hope, the Oysterhead Stout does not have the oceany flavor promised, the food is decent but overpriced. An alright restaurant in the Height that happens to brew it's own, as opposed to a pub. I will only go back if I happen to be in the neighborhood, or need a keg (they are cheaper than BevMo and hey, buy local!).", "author": "Katie D."}

Unfortunately, this is not a compliment, it's just the entire place is filled with people visiting SF who come here because they don't know any better.  I can't imagine why anyone who lives in the city would go here at all, let alone frequent the place.\n\nFirst off, they do make decent beers to give you a change from your usual PBR or Stella (for the refined crowd.)   As others have mentioned, this fact is offset by the tiny glasses which can be an issue if the place is at all crowded.  The food isn't bad.  It just isn't anything to write home about either.  It's also too expensive for what it is.  You could go out for a really good dinner for as much or even less than what you'll pay here for the glorified bar food.\n\nMagnolia does participate in the strong beer month so I could see visiting them once a year just to give them and other local brewers a pat on the back.

We've both heard great things about this place and I'm bummed that our experience was anything but enjoyable.\n\nLet me start off with the fact that the food was great .  This review is based solely on our experience (or lack thereof) with the waitress.  \n\nSo after waiting the usual 10 minutes for a table to clear up, we are seated by the hostess.  We looked over the menu by the door while we were waiting so we already had a general idea of what we wanted to order by the time we were seated.   \n\nThe hostess drops off some water less than a minute later.   After about 5 minutes, we put our menus down and are ready to order.  But one little problem... our waitress is nowhere in sight.   Oh wait... we also couldn't figure out who our waitress even was because no one had dropped by to say hello, introduce themselves as our waiter/waitress, or ask us if we'd like anything to drink.   \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, we started to get annoyed with the lack of service.   There was a waitress at the table directly across from us with a couple and  I thought that maybe she was taking their orders since she had been standing there for a bit.  Then at one point the girl gets up to use the restroom and the waitress plops herself in the seat across and starts chit chatting with the other guy!  Turns out the waitress is friends with the couple and she proceeded to just sit there for another minute or two.  \n\nIt wasn't until TWENTY MINUTES LATER that the waitress shows up and introduces herself.  And low and behold, guess who it is?  The chick that was sitting directly across from us chitchatting it up with her friends!  LUCKY US.   \n\nAt this point, my fiance and I are both annoyed.  She FINALLY asks us if we'd like anything to drink and we told her that we were just ready to order.   The food arrives a bit later and it's delicious and we are finally starting to enjoy ourselves.   Our waitress didn't drop by to ask how our food was or if we would like anything else.   Once again, the HOSTESS refilled our water.\n\nWe were done eating and we sat around for another ten minutes waiting for our table to be cleared and order dessert.   Our waitress was still nowhere in sight.   The hostess had to come by and clean up our table!!!\n\nAfter about ANOTHER 10 minutes of just waiting for some sort of service, our waitress finally checks up on us.  My fiance and I were both pretty set on trying out one of their desserts that sounded great but after seeing how slow and non-attentive our waitress was, we decided to pass and get the hell out.   It took her another 10 minutes just to get our check.   \n\nI have worked in restaurants before and it is a given that in order to do well, you need to have a sense of time.  Our waitress had none.   I really can't believe how long it took her to check in with us, especially since she wasn't even busy.  She apparently decided that it was more important to chat it up with her friends than cater to other guests.   I really wish we had left the tip for the hostess since she gave us more service than the waitress.  \n\nAll in all, food was delicious but I really can't believe that this place would hire/retain a waitress as inattentive and slow as ours.

Also, their menu now has \"bar snacks\" featuring \"fromage blanc\" and \"terra firma pistachios, pixie tangerine.\"  Classic bar snacks--riiiiiiight.

When I first visited you, you were a hippie-dippie pub with good food and good beer. You were popular with locals and tourists alike. \n\nBut it went to your head. You started thinking - wait, I can do better than this. I can bring in the middle class with their Diners Cards, Amex and green-enviro-vegan-organic-homemadeisbetter ethos. I'll start dressing more nicely and charging more for my services. \n\nYou went... upmarket. \n\nIts OK, I was as sad as the rest when you painted over the murals inside. I did like the menu makeover... well the style anyway. The content, not so much. There is limited and there is limited. \n\n$10 for the tiniest cheese plate on the planet (3 small slices of cheese with 4 slices of bread to share). Come now. Fortunately only 3 of our party liked cheese so there was less fighting over the scraps. Admittedly, the cheese was pretty good. \n\nNonalcoholic beverages. Now I know that this is a pub, but there are such things as the Designated Driver, or the teetotaller, whose choice of beverage is sorely limited. Please, increase your nonalcoholic stock, it would be nice. Having drank here before, I can suggest that the beer here is good - and I always like a place which carries full descriptions of their beverages. I am always a sucker for a loquacious chronicle of fermented cereal.\n\nThe main courses we had were good - the steak was sublime. The fish and chips is a classic. My burger was really good and cooked perfectly. For that I cannot fault. The desserts were hit and miss in terms of quality, flavour and texture but the butterscotch creme brulee was a table favourite. \n\nHowever, the waitress service is so very poor. Like the style, you've puffed your chest out in a style of \"I work here, you should bend to my will, weakling\". I don't appreciate being huffed at for my friends running late, or not being able to decide on my choice of meal quite fast enough. You made me feel bad. And seriously, turn the music down a notch - it isn't that good and its doesn't fit the style of the place you are trying to run. \n\nOverall, I'll probably go back to Magnolia as its convenient to meet my upper-Haight friends, but there is a measure of guilt there. For Magnolia is a confusing mix of style, substance and emptiness which for me just doesn't really gel that well. The food is inconsistently good, the beer is good, but I just never leave feeling that amazed by the place overall, although clearly the ego at Magnolia massages itself.", "author": "Catriona C."}

The brisket had parts that were tender and delicious, but also had areas that were completely dry. The brussel sprouts and potatoes were cooked well, but it wasn't enough to save the dish. The deviled eggs were alright and the fries had way to much salt and pepper on them. Yes, I get that salty fries make me drink more beer. But with that much salt, I just ended up not eating the fries.\n     The food wasn't bad, but for the prices they charge, it definitely needs to be a step up from what it currently is.

Today I had the 3 item combo which you get to pick yourself:  potatoes, home-made chorizo and 2 fried eggs.  The chorizo option is what prompted me to order this as I always enjoy chorizo, but today's wasn't so great, it was sorta just lacking in any stand out flavor.  The rest of my breakfast was fine, eggs were just the way I ordered them, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked (some places over cook them and they come out dry).  Mesh the potatoes, eggs and chorizo and I have a yummy mess.    The bread pudding was not the same as I had had in previous visits, looks like the chef changed it up: was sorta dry, but that was remedied when we ordered a side of caramel sauce to drip on it.  That did the trick of making it not so dry and also giving it some flavor, that extra kick it was needing.  \n\nStill, despite the less than the stellar experience, I'd still come back for brunch if I was in the atmosphere, just because I am used to the place, and know what to expect, and this is one of the few places the BF and I both agree to go to; he can drink beer, I can have a mimosa, and we both can find something decent on the menu.", "author": "Denise B."}

This is what I wrote in a craigslist ad:\n\n\nMaybe this should be in the rant/rave section, but I wanted to explain my poor tip.  \n\nBasically, you sucked as a waiter.  We came in Tuesday night around 9pm.  We were a party of two guys and sat by the window.  As it happened, we both ordered burgers.  You wore a plain oversized white t shirt that was untucked.  \n\nFirstly, what was up with that super sized shot or \"taster\" beer size?  Obviously, ya'll just remodeled and probably have some different policies.  I don't frequent Magnolia, so maybe this isn't a new policy.  But it is quite expected for customers to not know of the serving size of this beer.  A simple warning about the puny size would have easy and nice.\n\nThen when you informed me that it was pint night and for one dollar more I could get a beer 3-4 times bigger, I was mildly stunned.  Isn't it obvious to tell the guest this from the start?  \n\nWhen it came to taking our order you asked \"What kind of cheese would you like\"?  This implies that it comes with the burger.  \"Would you like cheese?\" has a mild implication that there is an additional fee.  I only ordered cheese because of the way you phrased the question.  Normally, I go cheeseless with my burger.\n\nAnd same with the salad.  \"Would you like fries or salad?\" implies that it is an either/or situation.  Had I known that there was an additional charge, I would have either stuck with the fries, or ordered a side other than a lettuce and o&v salad.\n\nYour service was slow too.  I was trying to nurse my shot glass taster beer until I got the regular sized beer.  However, you didn't bring the next beer until I was finished with the puny beer.  I was practically done with my burger by then.  Maybe there was a miscommunication here, but when I ordered the second beer, I was ready for the second beer.  I didn't ask for you to bring it later.\n\nSo your poor verbiage, lack of providing information, and improper expediency is why you suck.  \n\nHopefully you will improve, get fired or quit (it doesn't matter).\n\nThe burger was cooked to specification I'll admit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-04", "description": "I flew up to SF for a conference and had this brew pub on my short list of must see attractions in the bay area. I must say that I had beer on my brain and didn't really process much with the menu, so please be advised that my rating is strictly limited to how impressed I was with the beer and the brewmaster of the house. \n\nSo let's talk beer. While I did get to sample several different ales, there are really only two styles that I drank extensively. First and foremost...the gruit. Unless you are a huge beer geek you may not be familiar with this kind of libation. It is an ancient style of beer which was brewed with various herbs and spices instead of hops (that's right...no hops). I first encountered the gruit as a special limited engagement beer at Hamilton's Tavern in San Diego where the owner had worked in collaboration with Green Flash Brewing and the brewmaster from Magnolia to make for the SD bar's third anniversary. It was love at first sip and drinking this beer was the whole reason I went Magnolia's in the first place (and the reason why I started home brewing). Anyway, when my friend and I sampled Magnolia's Gruit, it was as wonderful and as unique as we had remembered it from Hamilton's (with some subtle variations of course). I believe Magnolia brews this beer seasonally. If you are in the area when it is available I say you must stop by and sample it. It is my understanding that this brew pub is one of the only commercial breweries in the United States to make gruit, which means try it here, or good luck finding it elsewhere. And may I just tip my hat to the brewmaster. He was so awesome that when we told him we were from San Diego and that we were homebrewers seeking council for brewing a perfect gruit, he actually pulled out his recipe books and let us look at the ingredient list. That was above and beyond!!!\n\nThe second style would be the bitter. Magnolia makes several different standard, special, and extra special bitters. Now, I spent about a year and a half studying in England and during that time became quiet accustomed to drinking bitters. After returning to the states, I longed for it, but quickly realized that other than the occasional ESB, this style is not exactly found in every bar across the country. Also, when I did find it, it certainly fell short of what I remembered a proper bitter to be. With that said, I truly believe that Magnolia is brewing the absolute best English Style bitters that I have ever tasted outside of the UK. Bravo Magnolia!", "author": "jared s."}

The food was perfect--he got some kind of big, stuffed sausage sandwich that was like heaven in your mouth, and me, not being as hungry, got this simple salad and a side of fries, and everything was just right. My bf loved his beer, and I loved my cherry soda which they also make on-site along with all the homemade beer. \n\nAfter seeing some other reviews t seems like people are really pissed about the changes this place has made. I can't speak to that b/c my first time was after they made the changes, but I really loved it there and I can't wait to go back.

I will say though, if they used to have a late night erotic dessert service, it would be a shame if they had to get rid of it for this--why not do both? Also, for the record, I don't know what's wrong with duck in any SF district if it's done right--I don't see why the Haight should be immune from innovative, delicious food when it's popping up in places like Valencia Street, which seem just as unlikely of places to house great restaurants.", "author": "Allison G."}

After the last time, I wanted to believe we just caught Magnolia on a bad day. After two bad meals in a row, I'm inclined to believe Magnolia's kitchen staff just doesn't quite have it together.\n\nThe food here- local, sustainable gastro-pub fare- sounds great on paper. Unfortunately the execution is seriously flawed. Today we tried Magnolia for brunch. I had the pork belly plate with black eyed peas and fried egg ($11). Katie H. had the crab cake benedict ($13). We also shared ordered two sides of potatoes and the house-made sausage ($10 for all three). For drinks, I got a cask-conditioned cole porter ($6, 20 oz.) and Katie got  a Mimosa ($6). The drinks were the only thing we didn't have a problem with. My pork belly plate was alright- the black eyed peas were nice and the portion of pork belly was generous. Unfortunately parts of the pork belly were not really cooked through. I got a few bites that were largely cold, chewy fat. Very unappetizing, and actually made me gag a little bit. Anytime I am tasting bile the whole car-ride home from a meal, I can't in good conscience go higher than 2 stars. The terrific beer is the only thing saving Magnolia from 1 star hell.\n\nKatie's crab benedict suffered from similar problems. At first, her poached eggs were practically hard-boiled. She sent them back and the next batch were severely undercooked. For the prices here, they ought to be able to cook eggs. The hollandaise was also separated. The speck and the crabcake were yummy  but couldn't save the rest of the dish. Our server graciously comped Katie's mimosa, but it didn't really make up for the meal's glaring deficiencies.\n\nThe potatoes and sausage were also pretty mediocre. The sausage seemed a little undercooked and the potatoes were tired and not quite warm enough as if they had been sitting a while. This hunch was confirmed when they brought out some replacement potatoes after Katie sent her eggs back that were much hotter and crispier.\n\nI want to like this place, but for a $50 brunch, there were just too many things they got very wrong.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-20", "description": "As a beer geek (or as one friend constantly says, a beer sensei for reasons I have not yet figured out), having a place like Magnolia in town is a good thing. Not only do they have a fantastic selection of house made British and Belgian-style ales, but they also have some of the best Buffalo wings in the city.\n\nHowever, it's not these things which makes them tops in my book, but these three things:\n\n1) Handpumps - I think 5 of them in total, because real ale usually tastes better without added carbonation - and they're at the proper cellar temperature, not chilled to the level of the beer on CO2.\n\n2) Guest taps - when they have the space, you can find beer from other local breweries or brewpubs on tap to compliment (or contrast) their own selection.\n\n3) German ales - aside from Hefeweisen, there are only two indigeneous ales left in Germany: Klsch, from Cologne and Altbier from Dsseldorf. Not only are their interpretations dead-on (and I lived in Cologne for a while and practically lived in the brewhouses there), but they have sourced the correct glassware (stange and becher appropriately) which does add to the experience. Keeping these styles alive is aces in my book.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides to Magnolia. Personally, when it comes to the music of Jerry Garcia, I'm grateful the band's dead... and Phish can go jump in a lake, which means that the music certainly isn't my taste. \n\nAlso, the design of the pub doesn't dedicate nearly enough space for the bar. I'd blow out a couple of booths and expand the bar seating so you can find a place to stand on a busy weekend. The lack of space at the bar when I am at a brewpub knocks a point off of the overall rating, but the beer is definitely worth 5 stars.", "author": "Avery G."}

We ordered the devil on horseback ( i think that's what it was called) appetizer which were figs topped with goat cheese, wrapped in bacon. They were pretty tasty, except that the figs were a little over-ripened so the dish had a slight mushy texture. I also ordered an oyster (yes, only the ONE, since it was $3 a pop), which was very good. I was a little disappointed that they only had 1 type of oyster on the menu, but it was very good either way so no complaining here.\nNext I had the caesar salad (pretty good) and my friend had the watermelon salad, which was basically a bunch of mustard greens put on a plate with a couple slices of watermelon on the side and a sprinkling of bacon bits. In my opinion, definitely not worth the $12 she payed for it. \nAlong with my meal, I ordered their house-made root beer, which was a big let down for a brewery. It was watery even right as I was served it, so it was not the ice that had melted in. It also didn't have much of a taste to it, I hope that their beer does for their sake. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was their simply delicious pluot tart. It was magnificent. The warm pluot slices on top of the delicious buttery crust of the tart were amazing, and to top it all off, they served the dessert with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream. In my opinion, order this dessert and skip the meal!", "author": "Deana T."}

I got Magnolia's at brunch last weekend (after an assurance from the waiter that it was worth the insane price of $13) and it was yet another failure (but worse because it was $13!). All components of the burger--the meat, the bun, the pickle--were weirdly sweet (the onions were too, but they're supposed to be). The meat was juicy enough, but the outside was beyond charred. It tasted like it had been dipped in ash. It also showed up with cheese despite my specifying no cheese.\n\nOn top of the disappointing burger, my $3 coffee had lots of grounds. The staff was nice, however, and the fries were fine. My friend had pancakes that she liked.

Pre-makeover, it was a homey little neighborhood place with delicious pub food, including the best club sandwich and onion rings I've ever had. Also beer I suppose, and I guess I should admit at this point that I don't drink beer, so this review is based on food and ambiance alone. At any rate, it was a great pub before, but someone decided it should be trendy and pretentious instead, so they transformed it into what is an only mediocre pseudo-trendy restaurant. \n\nJust to be clear, I love trendy restaurants, but only if they live up to the hype. In Magnolia's case, they've taken the really yummy must-eat items off the menu and replaced them with weird stuff like chicken liver mousse and pork cracklings. Even with the basic stuff, they seem to have lost something; the fish and chips were underseasoned and a fancy salad I had was so blah that I don't even remember what was in it. I've tried several meals off the new menu and I can say definitively that it has not a single thing that I'm excited to order or eat.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin (and totally in keeping with the rest of the misguided makeover) is their new website, which looks cool but is a usability nightmare.

This place is heavy on meats, which isn't my thing, so I went with the chicken breast in maple sauce. The rest of my party really enjoyed the wide range of both meat and beers available. Matt had the bluebell bitter and said it was pretty good but not amazing. We all thought the food was really salty, especially my sister. The brisket was good and the chicken was ok.

He has already infused New Orleans and Southern influences in dishes such as these on the dinner menu: Bourbon glazed spare ribs with corn bread and potato salad ($19), Bluenose bass with roasted sunchokes, artichokes and beet relish ($20), pan-fried pork chops with red eye gravy and mashed potatoes ($18) and mushroom ravioli with sage brown butter, dino kale and Grana Padano ($15). \n\nTaking advantage of the fact that our daughter was down for a long nap after a fun Easter egg hunt at a friend's house, and that our son was at Grandpa and Grandma's house for dinner, my husband and I made our way to the Haight last Sunday to check this place out.  We were excited to see that their touted housemade sausages were still on the menu ($12 with two sides).  We tried the Portuguese linguisa, a salty, slightly spicy thin sausage that paired well with sides of German potato salad and tender rainbow kale.  The bratwurst was okay, we had it with roasted sweet potato and sauerkraut.\n\nOddly enough, the beers and wine on tap seemed a little off.  The two beers we sampled - Big Cypress Brown and Dark Star Mild - tasted almost identical and were lacking malty flavor and depth.   And I am not a wine snob, but after an initial taste, I had to send back their special Sutton Cellars \"Magnolia Blend\" of syrah (60%) and carignane (40%) because it was slightly sour.  The Tin Barn zinfandel proved to be a bit better.\n\nAs far as service goes, both the bar and kitchen had missteps during our meal for which our server graciously tried to take the blame.  My first glass of wine came out completely dirty, covered in lipstick and remnants of pulpy orange juice from brunch-time mimosas.  Our server said she saw the bartender wipe my second glass clean, but it still had lipstick on it.  And after I inquired about the preparation of one of the dishes, our server asked the kitchen.  She came back and explained it would be done one way, but to our surprise, it was prepared another.  Hmmm.  It was at that point that we decided not to try anything more. \n\nI know Magnolia has a loyal following, so for those individuals, there will be a collaboration dinner with buddies from The Linkery of San Diego on May 11th.  It is a beer/salumi \"simul-dinner\" showcasing cured meats from The Linkery and beers from Magnolia, starting at 5:00 p.m. in both places.  Also at Magnolia every Tuesday, house beer is $3 all day.  They have fried chicken on Thursdays starting at 5:00 p.m. until they run out, and Ronnie's Beer Dinners happen every last Wednesday of the month featuring a three-course dinner with beer pairings.\n\nOverall, the sausages and sides were good, but the rest of the experience was less than impressive.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to rush back to try the new menu, sorry chef New!  It's sort of like comparing apples and oranges, but if my husband and I were in the neighborhood, we would definitely grab a seat at the bar at The Alembic instead.

What we found was great food and an exciting flight of beers (whenever you have a chance to take \"the flight\", do it).  We have since returned several times and here's what I've learned.\n\nThe food is consistently good.  Very good.  They nail some of the more traditional (read: European) bar fare.  Fries.  Mussels (though I've never tried them--don't do shellfish).  And some bad-ass onion rings with an American twist.\n\nThe beer--and I love my beer--is somewhat less consistent.  It's obviously far superior to standard American and European big brewery suds (i.e. Miller, Stella Arois, whatever other swill people drink).  But as far as craft brews go, these guys are hit or miss, mostly hit but with a noticeable number of misses.\n\nWhen they hit, like the recent Kolsch I had, they hit hard.  And when they aim for the more out there brewing styles they deliver.  We recently tried a no-hopped Gruit that was the group favorite, despite its not-so-ordinary  spices.\n\nWhere Magnolia leaves me wanting more are their standard English styles.  Brown ales, bitters, even some of the pales (though not all) come up lacking depth.  Even watery.  Some of the pales and IPAs are strong, however.\n\nOverall, I'll keep coming back to this place for several reasons.  They are the real deal.  They take risks and deliver most of the time.  And, frankly, any bar that names its best beers after Phish and Dead songs, is tops in my book.\n\nThough I live in Mountain View, in my heart, this my new local.", "author": "Adam A."}

If you order an ESB or a Porter or a Kolsh here, you're going to get a beer that could never be mistaken for a lager.

So, when we heard that a new chef had recently improved the food and the place had a new focus on sustainable agriculture and buying from local farms, we decided to give Magnolia another chance.  \n\nI wanted to eat a salad for dinner.  And on previous visits, I've enjoyed their Waldlorf salad.    However, a new salad caught my eye: shaved cantaloupe and grapefruit with arugula, feta, Serrano ham, hazelnuts.  I asked our server what she thought. \"Oh, it is the best salad.  It is really good.\"  I ordered it.  Meanwhile my four friends ordered two burgers, the chicken and the Cuban sandwich.  \n\nOur food took a LONG time.  And when it finally arrived, in front of me sat a tower of lots of shaved cantaloupe, about 8 little arugula leaves, a good amount of the Serrano ham, some grapefruit, some feta and one - I'm serious - one hazelnut.  I had been envisioning a big bowl of arugula, which I love, with a good amount of hazelnuts (which I also love) and some ham and cantaloupe, not a mound of  an entire cantaloupe with two pieces of lettuce and one nut!  And another thing while I'm complaining: I couldn't believe the waitress didn't tell me that this salad wasn't really big enough for an entre, when all my friends were ordering things like burgers and fries and chicken.  (To be fair, I should say that everyone else did like their meals and I did have a bite of the chicken and it was tasty!)    \n\nAfter we finished eating, it took forever to get our server's attention to ask for the bill.  Then, after trying several times to make contact with her as she rushed passed without giving our table one look for 20 minutes, I had to take our credit card over to the register myself.  \n\nAs we walked down Masonic towards our apartment across the panhandle (two hours later and one hour past my bedtime), can you guess what I said?

The service was slooooooow, but the food and beer were pretty good.  We ordered the brussel sprouts (yum), the sweet potatoes (double yum) and the fish and chips (meh).  With the aforementioned growling stomach, we just asked that the timing of items didn't matter so much, just bring out the dishes as they were ready.  Little did we know that there would be a 30 minute gap between brussel sprouts and fish and chips.  Oh well.  Everything was hot, so I guess that is a good thing.  We decided to get a dessert and ordered the malted milk cupcake.  It sounds yummy, right?  And for the most part, it was decent.  But the price tag ($7!!!!!!!!!) makes me feel like a big chump for ordering it.  \nOverall, it was an OK experience, but I'm not going back anytime soon.", "author": "Ms L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-10-22", "description": "I have never before left a restaurant shaking with anger.  Magnolia, how could you?\n\nI was meeting friends at Magnolia, and arrived before they showed up.  I put my name in at the bar, party of 4, two of us already here.  No tables were open, and no bar stools were open, so I sat at the small rail between the bar and the tables and waited patiently.\n\nWhen a table opened up, the hostess came and asked me if the other members of our party were here.  They weren't.  She then said that they couldn't seat us until everyone was there, in case another party of four came in while we were waiting for our friends.  Now, I'm not a huge fan of the \"we won't seat incomplete parties\" philosophy.  It is anti-customer, no two ways about it.  But, it's not like Magnolia is the only practitioner of this unfortunate philosophy, so I sucked it up and said nothing.  Then another table opened up.  Then a third table opened up.  At this point, I caught the hostess' attention and said that, since there were now 3 tables for four people open, they could surely seat us, since there were no parties of 4 waiting, and the other 2 open tables should be a more-than-sufficient buffer in case some unknown people walk in.  The hostess said that no, she couldn't do that.\n\nNow, I wasn't happy at this point.  But, at this point in the story, I would still have eaten at Magnolia, both that night and in the future.  But sadly, that's not the end of the story.\n\nI watched as the hostess took 2 place settings off a table for four, and then seated a party of 2 who came in after us at the table.  And at that point, I spoke to the hostess again, and said that if the restaurant was now going to start seating parties of 2 at tables for 4, it was time to seat us.  She responded that the two tables that were left were only for parties of 4; the table she had given to the party that came in after us was the only table that could be converted to a table for 2.  And I responded that, when she decided to convert that table, we were the only proper recipients of it.  And she said that she seated the other party because the party was \"complete\" whereas our party was \"incomplete.\"  I noted that we were a \"complete\" party of 2, same as the people who got seated, and were entitled to the table since we had been waiting for 30 minutes and they had just arrived.  The hostess responded with the patented \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" non-apology apology.  The \"I'm sorry you're offended\" sort of apology.\n\nRight about this time, my friends came in.  I zipped up my coat, and we left.  I absolutely won't visit a restaurant that seems so dedicated to delivering horrible service.  My friends live 2 blocks away from Magnolia.  They were shocked by my story, as indeed I was shocked by the treatment I received.\n\nHere's my point.  A restaurant can have whatever policies it wants.  But when you start with a policy that is fundamentally anti-customer, as the \"no seating incomplete parties\" policy is, a service business like a restaurant better be extra careful to administer the policy delicately.  Once Magnolia had 3 empty tables for four, there was absolutely no reason not to seat us.  That's inexcusable.  When I called this to the hostess' attention and she still refused to remedy the situation, we've gone beyond inexcusable to the realm of unforgivable.  When the same hostess then converts a table for four to a table for two and gives it to people who arrived after we'd been waiting for half an hour, we've actually entered some sort of Twilight Zone where the customer is the enemy and the hostess' job is to see what sort of abuse she can heap on the customer until he or she or they go away.\n\nAs sad as all of this is, what's also sad was that my old review of Magnolia had a funny story in it.  And a 4-star rating.  But that good experience has been all but blotted from my mind due to the absolutely horrific service I got there last night.  That, of course, is the nature of the service industry: years of hard work can be obliterated by the thoughtless actions of one person, one night.  And so it is with my review: the old, good review is gone, replaced by this bad review.\n\nMagnolia has great hamburgers and good beer.  So do dozens of other restaurants in the city.  Most of these restaurants will treat you well, and welcome your business.  None of them, I feel safe saying, will treat you as badly as I was treated at Magnolia.  Indeed, I can safely say I've never been treated that badly at a restaurant ever before in my life.  I sort of doubt that's the tagline Magnolia wants for their restaurant:\n\nMagnolia: Great hamburgers, good beer, we'll treat you worse than you've ever been treated at a restaurant in your life.\n\nBut that's all I'm going to remember about Magnolia.  I hope the two empty tables for four were worth it.", "author": "Ben P."}

The beers are amazing, always order the seasonal so you don't miss out on brewed gold, then get the proving ground IPA, it's a great. The food is also quite brilliant, haven't had a bad meal yet. Though I wish the menu was more expansive and had a little more for veggies. I'm a sometimes veg myself, so it may be personal thing. Regardless the food is superb, try the Fried chicken, it is excellent, and the snoseges are awesome. I always forget to ask but if they don't think they have food and beer pairings.. They should! It would truly enhance the experience... they should work on that. If they already do my mistake, and well played magnolia, well played. All in all Magnolia is a delicious and very cool. I mean even the bathrooms are cool! So stop on in for a sleepy lunch they will not disappoint.", "author": "Sean MC E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-23", "description": "I am really sorry to be writing this review... I've lived 2 blocks from Magnolias since long before it opened, was really excited when it opened, and for several years enjoyed eating there (the old menu, pre-renovation days). Since then, I've continued to bring family and friends there, but less and less, mostly because the food - though sometimes very good - was overpriced for the type of venue it is. My partner was more critical of Magnolias, but I hung on to my hope and appreciation of having such a restaurant in a neighborhood  that has very few truly good restaurants (surprisingly). Last night I decided to take my daughter and her boyfriend there for an early dinner (5pm). Here's what happened. \n\nThe service: We got there early enough to have our choice of booths. We apparently chose the wrong one cos we got a completely inept waitperson. She *finally* showed up, before my partner joined us, and we ordered a quartino of the \"house wine\" ($15 for 2 glasses). My partner showed up about 10 minutes after we did, and at some point she brought 3 more place settings (5 now, but we were only 4). No big deal. We had water but only two water glasses. When we finally had the opportunity to interact with her again, we asked for more water glasses and they came about 10-15 minutes later. My partner was never asked - even when we were ordering food - if HE wanted something to drink. So I said before she scooted away, \"He would like to order a beer\". Long story short - the beer never arrived. AFter about 20 minutes, half an hour, we asked. She was apologetic. Found the beer. Meanwhile, during this wait, my daughter and her bf had questions about the menu because they are gluten free. This waitress had never even heard of \"gluten free\". This is SF, not Wyoming. But okay, so she goes off to ask the kitchen about just a handful of dishes we wondered about... comes back and says that 3 of the 4 sausage dishes were gluten free. The risotto was not, because it is has rice. So now we are really confused. Did she misunderstand or is the kitchen really inept? The rice was not in question - it is gluten free. (At this point my partner still did not have his beer.) Okay, so we discuss the options further and decide to ask for confirmation about the risotto when she comes back cos that's what they really wanted. By the way, they knew their choices would be limited and so we perused the menu at home, and it seemed there would be a few choices, which there were. No thanks to Ms. Waitress. So we order one risotto, one prosciutto, two onion soups, one spinach salad and one merguez sausage. The waitress brings plates and ONE spoon for the soup. Both plates are dirty as is the spoon. But where is the spoon for my partner's soup? She comes back and we tell her about the plates and spoon and she says, oh I only heard one soup order (mine). (I heard him order his).\n\nThe food: The onion soup... I tolerated  mine. You could probably get better from a can. Onion, stale bread and cheese. And it said \"traditional\" on the menu. I ate most of mine out of starvation. My partner pushed his aside (to her credit, she comped that). The risotto  was good, they said. The prosciutto was good. The merguez was not hot, a pet peeve of my partner, the \"accompaniment\" was \"eh.\" The spinach salad was good. Did I mention that I did not particular like the wine? The waitress even said that it was an \"acquired taste.\" What??\n\nI have history with Magnolias (including communicating with DAve McClean via email years ago). I want so much to like it. The food is mediocre. Their hiring standards have evidently gone way down and at least this waitperson's service was not commensurate with the price of the food. Since she comped the beer (told us as the end), I gave her a tip (the beer plus $2). But she didn't really deserve anything. At first she made a lot of excuses about how many tables she had (again, it was 5pm when we got there) and later she started to apologize. A little humility is good, yes. But between that and the food and the bill, which was $85 including the tip, it was NOT a worthwhile meal at all. It is unlikely we will go back there. Very  disappointed. Oh, and let me say that this $85 was with only 3 drinks, a shared entree, a shared appetizer and no  expensive entrees besides the risotto! \n\nI don't usually do this kind of review on Yelp. I'm hoping that maybe Magnolia will take it to heart. (Dave, can you hear me?) They sold out, or something. Maybe they should stop pretending to be a restaurant and just do beer and bar food.", "author": "Mara K."}

The food at first was kinda tolerable. But since then I've had two run-ins with rude severs / wait staff, one of which was rather epic, and telling of the true nature of the vibe of this place. \n\nThe way to sum the Magnolia up: Come eat / drink / be merry at the crash pad of an East Coast Trustafarian!\n\nAs I've said, I'd gone to the place a number of times to enjoy the beer.  I started bringing in friends to show them my new find...then I started to notice things.  If your friends are of a color other than Lilly white, they will not get good service.  And the Magnolia staff barely tries to hide it.  \n\nThe worst encounter I had there was when I brought a brown friend in for a (brown) beer.  Both of us are 35 years old with a \"touch of grey\" (as the Dead song goes hawr) - I enter the establishment first and get an IPA.  As I enjoy the beer my friend comes in and sits down.  They are ignored at the bar for over 5 minutes, so I ask the bartender (one of the original wait persons no less, who had served my friend before, and had seen her at other beer events, the female one with the thick glasses) for a beer for my friend, she looks at them, sneers, and says \"let me see some ID first\" - to a 35 year old with grayish hair!  I had NEVER seen anyone get carded there!  Shoot I don't even carry ID anymore, this being America and keeping to cash for budget reasons - what 35 year old carries it?  I pointed this out to the bartender, and she gave me a rash of crap.  My friend drinks water and goes to another establishment.  I finish the fine, hoppy IPA.  While I finish my beer no less than three people enter the bar and are served - all younger than my friend and without ID checks.  They happened to be white.\n\nI went on another day with a black fellow and he caught similar bad treatment - in more of an ignoring, condescending way.  He simply had an extremely hard time getting served a drink, not only his first, but his second and third. After that he had it --- and he hasn't been back.\n\nI have talked to other people who happen to be non-white and they have had similar encounters there.  I know of no less than ten hardcore beer lovers - who love their beer but can't take the service.  The service is plain bad, the vibe is less than \"caring\" or \"homey\", and the food is not good.  No beer can make up for all of that.", "author": "jeff b."}

The food is presented in an uninspiring manner, the chicken wings i ordered were tasty, they would have been better had they contained actual meat instead of mere skin on bone.\n\nWho ever remodeled the interior made a serious mistake, Magnolia's art was part of it's character and displayed a solidarity with the neighborhood and city it is located in. Now it looks like a you're dining in a laundromat with a water and mold problem. The gold wall treatments and mirrored panels on the pillars are reminiscent of a steak house in rural Texas circa 1976. \n\nThe table to the left of the door is cool though.\n\nIf i wanted to build an epic restaurant with a solid following, I would fire whoever made the decision to change what seemed to be working in the first place at Magnolia.", "author": "Adam R."}

I decided to give it one more chance, and I will not be returning.  We  went early on a Friday night (6 PM) because some friends from out of town loved beers.  We wanted to order appetizers and beers, but the $12 hamburgers kind of frightened us out of ordering food.  After the server realized we didn't want dinner, she told us that we couldn't order another round, gave us our bill with our beers, and ignored us for the rest of the evening.   To add further insult to injury, the group at the table next to us only ordered appetizers and beers, but they got good service (ie the server came to their table more than twice), apparently because they had ordered more expensive appetizers than we did.  \n\n We work in the service industry, and realize that we were probably not the most valued customers since we weren't ordering food, but we were fully prepared to order lots of appetizers and lots of drinks, which would have brought our bill up just as much as the food did.   Who knows, if we were having a good time, we might have even broken down and ordered some of those worth their weight in gold burgers (by the way, the lilac creme brulee tastes suspiciously like liquid soap).     We planned to leave a good tip, but we  thought better of it after  we spent 30 minutes complaining to each other about how obnoxious the service was. \n\nI think the sign of a good restaurant is that it makes all of its clients feel valued so that they will return in the future.  Magnolia made it painstaking clear what the bottom line is for them -- turning over as many tables with as high a check as possible.\n\n(By the way, my beer snob friends did like the beer, hence the 2 stars).", "author": "anne s."}

It was my favorite pub to go to when I first moved to San Francisco, but after the recent remodel I've found that this place has lost a lot of it's unique charm. Some of the changes they've made are good, like the giant table by the window that invites multiple people/parties to sit down and start up conversation, or the updated bathroom which looks awesome. However, they got rid of the abstract mural that brightened up the place and totally fit in with the Haight. Where the mural once was, now is plastered with stained and ugly gold leaf wallpaper that makes the lighting seem very dim. I also don't like that they chose to get rid of the nice bar top and replace it (and other surfaces) with cheep stained Douglas Fir. Mirrors on the posts don't flow so well with the place either.\n   In addition, it seems there beer selection needs to be updated. Most of their beer I find great, but every single beer is a handcrafted artisan masterpiece of a beer. In my opinion, they don't have anything mellow that goes down smoothly like a nice Amber Ale. \n   Final summation: I miss the old place. It used to feel much more welcoming and local before the remodel. In my opinion, the charm has faded, and judging by how many people where there last Friday, the people in the neighborhood feel the same way. It used to be this place would be standing room only by 7:30 on a Tuesday night. If it's not broke, don't try to fix it.\n   There are other pubs on Haight, unless you're really craving specialty beer.\n\nPS What kind of douche bag word is \"Gastropub\"?", "author": "Garrett H."}

The loss of the amazing murals, honest pub grub, and groovy atmosphere was heartbreaking. On the upside, the much needed bathroom remodels did turn out lovely, and they do now have very tasty water, available in regular or sparkling. More importantly however, I've given the new food several tries, and been let down every time. Super salty pizza, with chunks of pork belly fat atop (yuck!), dry, crumbly sausage, and severe skimpage on the cheese platter, fries and burger fixings... not cool, especially at the prices they are charging. The lack of new artwork leaves the decor very bland. Their newsletter from several months ago claimed the new art would be up soon, still I see blank, antiqued gold walls every time I go in, and it makes me very sad. \nGo for the BEER, and only the BEER. It is definitely the BEST BEER brewed in the city, and arguably the best beer brewed in California. \n\nA hippies money is just as green as a hipsters, right?

Magnolias has good beer at a good price if you go at happy hour. The pub is weirdly situated on the corner in the Haight so the space feels a little cramped. From the outside you would never know its a brewery but once inside the taps call and soon you have a 20oz imperial pint and realize that looks can be deceiving. The beer selection is good a unique (my favorite was the Weather Report Wheat). If you are going to try it out go during happy hour when imperial pints are only $3.50....thats a lot of beer.", "author": "Annie M."}

Finally when I complained for the third time, they gave us two tables adjacent to each other but insisted that we do not put them together for fire hazard reasons. So essentially they split us up into two groups and at the end brought us two separate checks - one for each table of five but they added a mandatory service charge of 18% for groups of 6 or more.

One BIG one is that they do not offer a simple veggie burger.  That should be a brew pub staple.  I'd like to see a turkey burger on the menu too.  But, without pointing out too much what is missing I'll concentrate on what they do offer.   They offer great beer in general.  Unless, of course, you choose to go on Sunday when almost all the beers are tapped out.  That is what happened to me this past Sunday and I was somewhat disappointed.  But, it did make me try other options and the Blue Bell Bitter was a better bitter than I'd have thought.  The pizza was especially good.  It had a great herb crust and not too much of any one thing.  The perfect balance of ingredients made it superb.  They always have good house cut fries for $4 with tasty dipping sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-24", "description": "A-\nA welcome and relative newcomer to the restaurant and pub scene here in the city and a perfect fit for the Haight.  It fits like a well worn glove into the crossroads location at ground zero where the summer of love began.  Eclectic and dedicated, this place is a real tribute to artisan beers, ales, bitters, stouts and handmade brews more so than other brew pubs anywhere in San Francisco and each a breakthrough with an audience and following.  The names of some of these beverages alone merit serious literary perusal.  Food follows in the same direction with creativity and integrity being the passwords at this serious joint.  Windows from mid thigh to arm reach level face both Haight and Masonic and a permanent wooden overhang protects visitors from the blaring sun and rain.  Green, beige and brown tiny tile flooring contrasts with the simple ceiling adorned only by old milk glass hanging lamps.  A mural wraps around the whole interior wall at arms length height and is vibrant and reminiscent of famous poster art from the hippie era.  There are lots of wonderful little discoveries to make at this formidable testament to individuality like handmade sodas and no Coke or Pepsi which is truly refreshing.  The burger came on a large white steak platter and the plate was filled with the burger, fries and salad with a house made pickle on the side.  The burger was generous and from Niman Ranch which lends itself to a great burger like skin to bone.  The artisan bun was perfectly toasted and the cheese was still melting over the meat when delivered.  The house cut fries were piping hot and fresh with a dusting of herbs and fine salt which was close to overpowering but after a few bites just right.  The fresh lemonade came in an old fashioned pint glass and was perfect.\n\nMagnolia Pub offers food in several categories at all times they're open and it is interesting enough to have loyal followers at all times of the day and night.  I loved their snack menu with things like roasted salted almonds, bacon wrapped water chestnuts and the starter menu which offered blue bell onion rings with horseradish mayo, Niman Ranch lamb chili, the sandwiches, salads, specials and desserts like a tri color sundae with chocolate, vanilla and wild cherry ice cream with banana and house made sauces.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-07-30", "description": "Magnolia was one of the first places I ate at in San Francisco.  Their tasty, reasonably priced burgers and Cubano sandwiches, with crispy delicious fresh onion rings, fantastic cheap fries, and inexpensive beer were a draw, and the lively crowd and awesome mural around the wall kept things interesting.  Sometimes you had to wait a while for a table on a weekday afternoon.\n\nIt is thus with mourning that I must report that Magnolia has changed significantly for the worse.  My most recent meal at Magnolia will be my last; it will require substantial effort to drag me across the threshold back into the restaurant.\n\nTo start with, all the prices have gone up.  A lot.  Like 40-50%.  We were there on a Tuesday, so the beer was all half-price, but I wasn't drinking, so though the waitress took great pains to explain that it was a really good deal, I didn't order any.  And I felt a bit awkward having the waitress try to sell me on it, especially at the new, \"classy\" Magnolia.  Also, the vast majority of my menu favorites from the past are gone.\n\nEventually the waitress came back to take our food order; despite the $11 price tag I ordered the cubano.  My friend ordered the Brewer's Yeast pizza.  Though the restaurant was maybe 30% full, the food took close to a half an hour to be served.  When the cubano arrived, I noticed some leafy greens on the sandwich.  This was a new addition, and unexpected since it was not listed on the menu.  I asked the waitress what it was, and she told me it was red chard.  Why would you put red chard on a cubano?  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, I took a bite.  It was awful.  Disgusting.  It tasted like bad steamed leafy greens with a hint of ham.  The waitress could tell I was unhappy, and asked if I wanted them to make another without the chard.  I told her no, because I didn't want to wait for another sandwich (remember, this one had taken 30 minutes, and this is a weekday lunch!)  So I removed the chard completely from the half sandwich I had taken a bit of, and tried again.  Sadly, the sandwich was not improved.  Because it had been grilled with the chard inside, the flavor had permeated and overwhelmed the sandwich.\n\nSo I picked at the french fries, and left the disappointing sandwich to sit on the plate.  When the waitress came with the check, she said they \"couldn't\" (why not?) comp the $11 sandwich I couldn't eat, so they'd comped my friend's $3 beer instead.  That made me pretty angry, but I was starving and in no mood to get into an argument, so we paid our check and left.\n\nAnd I don't think I'm ever coming back.  The food and the service both suck now, the mural is gone, the place looks half-finished and sad, and the crowds are gone too.  What a sad, sad fate for what used to be a wonderful place.", "author": "Laurence B."}

Can I just say... WOW! This burger was the most delish ever! I liked it so much that I told a friend about it last weekend and ended up there... AGAIN! More burgers please! I think I may have found a new liking to red meat. The flavor and tender juiciness of this burger leaves me wondering... why oh why don't I eat more red meat? The place is more for the meat eater... but it is pub like food... and for pub food... it is superb! \n\nThe service is friendly. There can be a wait during dinner hours. They accept all forms of payment... as long as it is legal form of tender in the US. Sorry... no pesos or Euros allowed here... \n\nHmm... makes me want to see Steel Magnolias now... well... that is a whole other story! \nIt is priced right for the quality. I had no issue with it.", "author": "Amelia M."}

Being allergic to alcohol and refusing to touch high fructose corn syrup, I end up drinking a lot of water when I go out. Which is very boring. So a brew pub that lets me actually drink a dark bubbly beverage with my friends is totally awesome. However, last weekend my little love affair with Magnolia ended: splat. I had to pay $17 for a tiny sliver of wild salmon, half a dozen brussels sprouts, and a dab of mashed potatoes. Seriously, 8 bites of fish (I counted). It was pathetic. My friend ordered the same thing and hers was just as small.

We finally came by on a Monday afternoon to empty seats at the bar. I was impressed at the sheer number of beers they brew at any given time, I think they had 12 or so. I had the Blue Bell Bitter (one of 4 or so bitters!) and a pale ale. Both were excellent and full of flavor and complexity, equally representing their brew style. My BF had both their IPA's, one being crazy hoppy but still surprisingly smooth. We sampled their Weekapaug Gruit, which is a hopless beer with herbs that reminded me of old fashioned cola elixirs from the 1900s. We did order an appetizer of pickled peppers, they were tasty but it was a small portion. Also ordered the carrot cake whoopie pie and it was A++! It had a delicious caramel sauce and freshly whipped cream cheese filling.

The food is good. \n\nStopped in here after the crowd at the Chieftan was overwhelming (trivia night tuesday...) I came for the burger. Pretty excellent. Everything I want in a good burger. Tasty beef, good cheese and yummy special bacon of some sort. All criterion checked. The caramelized onions were pretty strong, but a few did the trick. Everyone who ordered a burger that night found them a little pinker than they expected, but hey, with beef its much better to err on rare.\n\nThe decor is really nice since they remodeled the interior. Low lighting, A lot of nickel and pewter tones against dark woods. It certainly felt like a gastropub (god I hate that word). \n\nWhy three stars? Well, I have mixed feelings. First strike against this place is the association with the Greatful Dead - its pretty subtle now so I can deal. Second strike - I ordered a beer thinking I was getting a pint and I got about 8oz (beware if you order the Kalifornia Kolsch). It seriously took forever to get our spacey waiter (strike three) back over to get another drink. I was past the halfway point in my burger by the time I got my sippy cup replaced with a grownup sized beer. Resorting to asking the busboy to get your server after you have been waiting is telling. Still, one service lapse does not a trend make, so I will certainly go back. Normally i wouldn't get bitchy about a beverage refill, but this isn't a coke. It was a beer. At a microbrew. In a nice restaurant.

And the food is definitely good by regular restaurant standards too. Came in here Saturday for lunch, when the sunshine outside and an early morning hike at Muir Woods meant a good pint of beer was in order. Since I'm not hardcore enough to drink the dark stuff I ordered a Prescription Pale to go along with their chicken sandwich. It was definitely good enough to ween me off my standard Heffeweizen. The sandwich hit the spot and came with a generous amount of fries seasoned to dangerous levels for a carb-free dieter and a little salad. It's good for what it is and doesn't try to be what it's not, and is worth stopping in at when around Haight.", "author": "Ayelet I."}

Prior to this last visit I do remember enjoying quite a few of their home brews but I don't remember really really really digging the atmosphere (which is surprising because I really like the neighborhood). It just wasn't a place that I would go out of my way for you know? But this past Sunday changed my tune....\n\nI was out with some friends who were feeling \"brunchy\". So we hoofed it from Civic Center area to H-A with stops in Hayes Valley and Divi and Lower Haight. Why such a long walk? Well one of my friends was in one of his \"moods\" and had to find the \"right\" place to eat. Going through this ordeal is equivilant to say taking a dog on a walk in the rain. Doggie needs to find the \"perfect spot\" to pee on and all you're thinking is \"hurry up! one place is as good as the next damn it!\" but I digress....\n\nSo yeah we wound up at Magnolia for brunch and let me say, it kicked ass even with the absence of Bloody Marys and mimosas (staples in my mind for Sunday brunch). For starters even though it was about noon ish when we got there our group of three only had to wait about ten minutes or so. The croissant and jam were lovely and just the perfect blend of flaky and squishy. The chorizo and eggs with cinnamon black beans were delicious (apparently they make their own chorizo) and big enough to share. The seared scallops on a bed of radicchio, white beans and smoked tomatoes were so decadent it was unreal (think the perfect blend of sweet and mesquite-ish). Plus they were so soft and fresh you could cut them with a fork. I wish I could have tried the blueberry waffles with peaches and cream but sadly, I am allergic to blueberries. Oh well. As I finished my fresh oj before we left, I made a mental note to come by here for lunch some day. They've set the bar high for themselves so let's see what they bring.", "author": "Veronica G."}

If you're not a drinker, or are simply not old enough to drink in public yet, try the homemade root beer float. Again, the root beer is made at the brewery, and it's oh so scrumptious.

I didn't want to be the complainer, so I went along and thought I could always eat later and just have beer.  Well the menu was completely different.  It's like upscale brew pub.  They have a bunch of different sausages, fish, etc...I didn't really look on after I saw the sausages honestly.  I got the spicy chicken one, and you get to pick 2 sides.  I had the horseradish mashed potatoes (sooo good) and the corn on the cob.  It was just the right amount of food and really delicious for only $12.  \nI'm still not completely a fan of their beer.  I had the wheat, and it wasn't unfiltered or served with a lemon, which is what I want with a wheat, oh well.

I had the Cured Salmon Boxty again.  I couldn't get enough the first time so I had to order it again.  We also had a side of the house-cut french fries with curry ketchup and garlic mayonnaise.  Yummmmm, I loved both dips!  For my entree I had the Grilled Portobello and Zucchini sandwich.  It was OK, which I don't think I'd order again.  It said it comes with feta, but I think it was provolone.  Hmmmm, I'm wasn't sure but it didn't taste like feta.  I could have had the Boxty as a meal.  I paired my meal with the Oysterhead Stout!  Yummy!  It had a hint of bittersweet chocolate and you could definitely taste a hint of salt from the oyster shells.  I definitely would get this stout again given they don't have Proving Ground IPA available.  They received one star in return for service where it lacked once!       \n\n***First Reviewed on 10.02.07***\nThe first time I ate here, I had the lavender infused creme brulee, which was the second reason why I came back.  First reason, I LOVE THE PROVING GROUND IPA! My bf and I even brought a jug home this time.  The first time, the service was great. The second time around the service suffered a bit due to the amount of customers that day, which is understandable but it's still not an excuse for the poor service.  \n\nI returned a few weeks ago and had the cured salmon boxty which was delicious.  The salmon was a bit on the salty side, but the crispy potato cake it sat on made up for the saltiness and it could have used more creme fraiche, but that stuff is filling so maybe I didn't need more than it had.  Although the frisee salad with the tomato vinaigrette looked bland, it was full of flavor. Since I returned on an account of the lavender infused creme brulee, I never got it this time around.  I asked our server to bring a dessert menu.  We waited around a bit.  Our server never brought me the dessert menu; I never had the chance to ask him so we just paid and left.

The menu and the restaurant have changed...I think the mural they used to have up behind the bar was one of the reasons why I remembered this place. Now they have totally revamped the place and is now a flashback to what it once was, which was a pharmacy 'Pre' 1960s ( I liked the mural better! so sad to see it go and I know I'm not the only one). As for the food, still pretty tasty and the fries are probably the best I've had. So if your a french fry lover you will not be let down...make sure you get them when their hot and fresh. Also if your a beer drinker they have some really good micro brews as they brew their own beer. The employees are up on the facts of the beer, so they can tell you what a BTU is and how the beer is made...if your trying to become an at home brew master...they have a day out of the month or week (one of the two) that the brew master answers questions and gives tips on his micro brews. \nLast but not least, is if your a Deadhead like me your going to enjoy the music playing in the restaurant as its Grateful Dead Hour all day every day! \n\nKeep On Truckin.", "author": "Ben L."}

It was about 8:30 when a friend and i showed up and the place was slightly busy. While there were lots of people at the bar, there were a couple of open tables on the back wall, so I was seated almost immediately by a super nice dark haired woman. We were waiting on friends so we ordered a couple of beers and some appetizer from our waitress. After she took our order for beers, Brussels sprouts, and devils on horseback, everything started going down hill. She brought us water in a bottle who's top had broken off. When we brought it to her attention and asked for a new bottle, she made some comment about how we could lie about swallowing the piece of glass and how we could sue magnolia. She then decided to walk away from the table and not replace the bottle. Awesome right? Two minutes later we received our beers.... easily the highlight of our night. While I had the stout of circumstance, it doesn't matter what beer you get. They are all epic. Beautiful full flavor and never dull or watery. About half way through the beers we received the inevitable text from our friends... the one that's saying we are getting ditched for a night club. Right as we decide to take another look at the menu and figure out what to eat, our appetizers arrive. Now I've had the devils on horseback multiple times before, and every time I have they have been better than good. But this time it was a total miss. Burnt Bacon. Chard bacon. Terrible disgraceful bacon. So bad that when the pieces mixed in my mouth with the warm and perfectly melty cheese inside of the date, it totally ruined the experience. The Brussels sprouts were no better. Completely overdone. Even the hearts were uneatable. After that, we couldn't take it. Paid our bill and left. It was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in San Fran. Even after saying that, if you have never been here, go. Their beer is EPIC.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "The way I see it - there are those who \"new the old Magnolia\" and then are newcomers like me. \n\nTo those old timers - ok - sorry. You may have lost murals or prices or dingy whatever you used to come to. I honor that - especially in this location that focuses on the time of the past. \n\nBut you know what - times have past. And this place evidently has tried to evolve. \n\nAnd I am impressed! \n\nA friend tipped me off about the fish and chips here. Anytime you combine great beer with gourmet pub food - you have me hooked! \n\nThis place is the real deal! \n\nMost of the people walking by the window of Magnolia on Haight probably don't want to come here or can't afford it. But this place is definitely worth a trek to even if you have to park five blocks away for public parking. \n\nThe blackboard boasts 15-20 beers - although expect 2-3 to be out until the next batch arrives the following month. The brewer knows his yeast - from Belgium to German to American - and crafts some tasty items. I enjoyed a couple of IPAs - and a wonderful single Belgian Abbey ale. \n\nFor an appetizer, I wanted salt and opted for the curried nuts. They were ok - but as I say, \"If I can easily do them at home - then a restaurant version won't impress.\" On the other hand - I tasted what will surely be one of my best appetizers of 2009: \"Scotch Eggs.\" Few have mentioned this in past review. I am not sure if they are new to the menu or are intimidating. But they were terrific. They start with soft boiled quail eggs, and surround them with spiced ground meet. Add a flavorful breaded coating and deep fry - and you have an amazing mouthful of excellence. They serve it with some dressed arugula and saut\u00e9ed red peppers. It was a great appetizers. \n\nThe chef here specializes in meat. Stuffed meat. Cooked meat. Affected meat. Think dark wood, hunter seasons and meat. They make homemade sausages. If you have only eaten the Johnsonville Brats from the market, hyped up with fat and flavors - you may not like these. They are natural and singular in focus (one meat - one flavor). \n\nI had a hard time between choosing one of the sausage dinners or the waitresses favorite, the Cassoulet. She talked me into the Cassoulet - and I was not disappointed. It was a hearty casserole dish of housemade Toulousse sausage (garlic and white wine with meat), a leg of duck confit, saut\u00e9ed pork belly and rich, yet not overdone cannellini beans. \n\nWow. I mean wow. The flavors were great. Each meat held its own. The bean were \"al dente\" - and instead of being soggy - were nearly crispy on the outside but creamy on the inside. \n\nOne note. This is not your \"german sausage\" place. That is my heritage, and I know what you mean. The guy behind me wanted to know what kind of mustards the place had. I love a good greasy sausage with german or hot English mustard like the best of them. But this is more of a \"French sausage\" place - where it is all about the taste of the single or double spiced meats. If you want cheap and german heavy spiced sausages, get yourself down to Rosamunde Sausage Grill and the next door Tornado (which I also love!). This is a whole level above. \n\nI will return for more. Much more. I want to come back and try the fish and chips. Their gourmet Prather hamburger will be right on the day when I need that beef taste. The serve 5 kinds of cheese and charcuterie - including Humbold Fog. \n\nThe menu is cool. The website is hip. \n\nIn a city that sometimes under impresses for me - this one impressed me. Come give it a try. Forget about whatever may have been here in the past. Or what \"should be\" in this neighborhood. And enjoy the beer and food!", "author": "Stefan V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-04", "description": "In my previous life as a Seattleite, the hoppin' neighborhood brewpub was something I always took for granted.  Innovative local brews, solid food, and warm camaraderie were (and still are) the keys to these little gastronomic marvels, and I was so lucky to always live within spitting distance of one or another while dodging the everpresent Seattle raindrops.\n\nUpon my relocation to the Haight, I was thrilled to find Magnolia - seemingly a place I could hop in on a whim, enjoy some grub, nuzzle a few beers.  I've visited three times and always left a little disappointed ... and just a little bit homesick.  That said, it's not a bad place to be.\n\nThe cornerstone of any place calling itself a brewpub is, naturally, its beer.  Given the effusive manner in which SF locals have described Magnolia's brews, I was prepared meet with the second coming of Brouwerij Sint-Sixtus van Westvleteren.  Needless to say, I didn't.  I've tried their pale (presumably American), bitter, brown, mild, K\u00f6lsch, porter, anniversary ale (some sort of imperial IPA), and saison.  None really hit the mark.  The Saison was underattenuated and lacked the crucial farmhouse funk.  The K\u00f6lsch was too estery and finished far too sweet.  The anniversary ale was nigh undrinkable; not from the extreme hop content, but from the the overwhelming nose and flavor of a late addition of stale, freezer-burned Chinook or Cascade.  Their English styles are somewhat better, but had varying off-flavors or missing characteristics.  I have to wonder what their yeast strain is doing, and if the results are intentional.\n\nTheir food and decor paint a considerably brighter picture.  Ingredients are fresh, flavors are unique, and presentation is generally good.  They bill themselves a gastropub, and while the food doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny when compared to that of the trendy English gastropubs that undoubtedly inspired them, none of it is bad at all.  They get major points for using sustainable ingredients and for supporting the slow food movement.  Service is adequate, if a bit slow, and noise/ambience is acceptable for a pub-based restaurant. \n\nIn sum, I have mixed feelings about Magnolia; as a matter of convenience, it's close and the food is pretty good.

Or maybe they think \"the 60s\" refers to a fortified wine and are just plain f&@# lazy and since the \"progressives\" in SF are more than willing to enable their chosen lifestyle, why not pile into the Haight---but I digress.  \nMy point is that I do not think Magnolia has some obligation to be frozen in time like many of the Haight's \"residents.\" Change can be good, fun, etc. Unfortunately, once in awhile when we change things, we screw-up. You know, a bad haircut or \"what the f$#@ was I thinking when I painted my entire bedroom THAT color.\" \nThe key here is to recognize the error and fix it. Yes, I have been frequenting Magnolia since it opened and sketchy service aside, liked it just the way is was--not that a remodel and freshening up was a bad IDEA. And Magnolia still has the best fresh brewed beer in town and the food is pretty good; but the remodeled interior, atmosphere, whatever you want to call it, is a drab downer. Dark leather, dark tables, dark chairs and looming over all the darkness those dark gold walls---how bright and cheery. \nAnd the one thing that might have saved the whole thing, and I know I risk sounding like a petrified Haight dweller, was to keep the mural in place. Not because of its subject matter, but because of the depth and the light and color and cheer it gave to the room. So, bring back the mural (or just get rid of the depressing flat faceless gold walls), paint the posts that dominate the room a lighter shade of something, and presto!!!--- back in business. \nA final note: I do not mind paying more to help finance the remodel or for the upgrade in the food, but $17 for a growler of beer to go(that is four pints or 64 ounces for those who do not know)? That equals about $20 a six-pack, and we all know it is the bottling materials and bottling process which drives the high price of a six-pack. My favorite bottled six-pack of local micro-brewed beer (Speakeasy) can be had for less than half that--so what is up with the $17 growler folks? Just plain abusive.", "author": "b g."}

I ordered the seafood sausage, with fries and corn on the cob. It was the perfect portion (unlike most places that give you way too much) and not too bad of a price. The best of all was the dessert, the chocolate cake was not too rich and soo good!

Others represent the \"gastro\" part of the pub -- like my delicious \"shepherd's pie\" of assembled braised oxtails and short ribs, with a potato topping, two kinds of baby carrots and watercress.

I've must of been there at least 20 times in the last 2 years and every time, but one, the wait staff was not only indifferent and rude, like I'm putting them out by  being there, but they always mess up the order. And not just one order. Usually multiple orders. For instance, this last time they didn't bring me a pickle and they gave my partner fries instead of a salad. I mentioned the pickle *yes it seems petty but I LOVE pickles* and she never brought me one. I didn't have it in me to put up a fuss about it. I have many stories from my hopeful visits, one that includes a waiter who never checked on the table, screwed up orders and then threw a temper tantrum over our questioning adding an automatic tip for a table of 5... but there's just not enough room in this little screen or time in the day. \r\n\r\nBoth my partner and I wondered what it is about this place that they have such terrible wait staff.

Magnolia inside is warm and cheery. The napkins are essentially dish rags (interesting decor) and in the bathroom, they use real towels (don't worry, a fresh towel each time, the idea is just to avoid paper). We were initially seated at a table, because they apparently thought we were going to order food (not that they asked). However, once we ordered the drinks, the waitress seemed quite annoyed that food was not on our agenda, and warned us that if a larger party came in, we would be forced to sit at the bar. Our drinks arrived (I went for the sparkling wine, my friends took various beers) and since they appeared to be four free seats at the bar, we moved over to avoid getting the boot later on. The drinks were pretty good, although my friends thought one of the German style beers did not match up to what she was used to (oh well). The sparkling wine was quite potent. Most of the beverages are made by Magnolia, since it is a brewery, and most are unfiltered. The bar table is made of a smooth dark wood, and was perfect for perfecting our penny spins. The more we drank, the more elaborate we became with our coin games until eventually we realized it was time to pack up and head over for some fourth of July madness somewhere on the other end of the city (too bad Buena Vista park was smothered in fog as well- would have been the perfect firework viewing location). In summary, Magnolia is a cool brewery, the drinks are pretty good, but options are limited if you don't drink beer. A nice place to check out if you happen to be in the upper Haight.", "author": "Kate A."}

In desperate need to alleviate all of these, some friends and I darted into Magnolias in search of a nice cold beer and your typical brew pub fare. I don't venture to upper Haight much so I had no prior knowledge of Magnolia's. To our surprise, it turned out to be an upscale, semi-gourmet version of a pub. Prices a bit on the high side ($15-25). No worries - I'm hungry! I ordered the short ribs with sweet potato puree and arugula salad. Damn this was yummy! Falling off the bone and oh-so-tender, I gobbled up that rib and everything surrounding it. Others at the table ordered the fish and chips and monkfish. The fish and chips had a good 1/2 inch of fried batter on it, which is a bit much for my liking. Not sure how the monkfish was but I think the short rib was the winner of the night. I washed down my short rib with the Cole Porter, which was fantastic! All in all, good food, good atmosphere, good beer.

At one time, The Alembic was my favorite local haunt, but recent changes (Clipboard Nazi) have ruined it for me. And, sadly, I think that like The Alembic, Magnolia has become a victim of its own success (and likely the success of The Alembic). Bar classics have been replaced by quail eggs and fried okra, though some have been forced into culinary elite status by qualifiers like \"Prather Ranch\" and \"Brewers Yeast\". Granted, it is a selling point, but putting it in the name? Really? While the interior has indeed seen an upgrade, it is not radically altered from its previous and more pedestrian incarnation except in color scheme. Apparently, the idea is that darker equals upscale. Ultimately, for me, its ambiance and Alembic-lite menu makes a once easy 10 block hike something less tolerable. This is especially true for the non-carnivorous among us, as that population is almost entirely ignored on the menu. Vegans will have to be terribly creative and hope for the goodwill of the kitchen, or just brown bag it (though I never expect most places to give vegans a break). The only saving grace was the beer, which has never disappointed me and I doubt ever will. Luckily, despite Magnolia's evolution into a chesty pub with $13 burgers, The Haight is not lacking in places to grab a good beer and more affordable, less self-important, bar food. But, hey, of that's what your looking for in a pub, hike on over, you will probably love it. I've left a table open for you.", "author": "Don B."}

Don't think I've ever tasted such a good fresh sausage like this before.  Dee-lish!  The reuben was no less spectacular.  I was expecting a traditional deli sandwich.  But no!  The corned beef was straight off a brisket, with nice thick slices of meat, topped with sauerkraut and cheese on toasted fresh rye bread.  I think that this was the best rueben I have ever had.

At the 1 hr mark, she came buy and said she would buy us a round b.c of the wait.  Oh and then we couldn't go to the museum b/c we ran out of time so it ruined out day.

When I first moved to the Haight, I was so stoked to have a brewery within a half block of my house.  Now, I must give myself semi annual reminders of why I hate this place.  Hoping things had changed, tonight I had my reminder.  After waiting 15 min only to take a seat at a table that was empty when we entered, I then waited another 10 before I was able to order my beer so I could then wait another 10 to taste it.  1 wait staff for 15 tables, not  a well managed shift, but has it ever been?  Once my $13 \"where's the beef\" burger and 10 fries arrived it all became clear, this place has no soul.  It has all the makings of a wonderous establishment, but through the hollowed eyes only emptiness.   There is nothing that bad, other than the prices, the food, the service and that pitiful single top table that forces it's exiled lone traveling patrons to stare out the door as they are blasted by a bone chilling draft and longing to be able to make some sort of contact with others, but there's nothing that good either.  If you want a good burger, go to never fail Burgermeister.  If you want to spend some $ and get some ambiance with a good burger, go to NOPA.  If you want to wait, freeze your ass and wonder why the hell you tried this f'ing place again, go to Magnolia's", "author": "Ryan S."}

Over that time, what was once a great restaurant has slid into being little more than a tourist trap. The food quality and quantity have gone WAY down and the price has gone WAY up. I was there recently for all-day happy hour on Tuesday after not having gone there for a while. The beer there was the one thing that kept me going back. Since I'd been there last (which was a very long time ago, maybe 6 months to a year), I'd become way more of a beer aficionado, and what I noticed recently was mildly skunked beer that tasted like it was poured from taps that were never cleaned. It was almost like I could taste the mold and bacteria going across my tongue. Yuck. This wasn't just one beer or tap, and it was less noticeable from the stronger beers (which have more alcohol and thus inhibit microorganism growth better). Another thing that's kind of creepy is that around midnight the rodents start coming out (this isn't unique to Magnolia; you'll see them come out around the same time at other places on Haight Street). One good thing that's never changed is that the service is uniformly pretty good. But overall a huge shame this place has slid.", "author": "Marvin S."}

When the food came, the pizza was cold and there was one, medium sized crab cake.  I asked the waitress about the crab cake, and she said \"thats the way we do it\".   When i asked why then, was it in the \"Small Plates\" section, and $10.95., she said \"well, thats our word for appetizers, and crab is expensive.\"  Well, ok, but I KNOW FOR A FACT that crab is not that expensive.  The place i work at sells two pretty damn good ones for $7 and Alamo Square sells two of some of the best crab cakes that i have ever had, for about $9.  Now, I did misread the menu, and that was my mistake, but really, if you are going to sell a $10 crab cake (and who sells ONE crab cake?  I have never seen that) it better be damn good. When I asked about the pizza, she copped an attitude, and said \"What? Do you want me to take it back?\" When we got the bill, on top of the cold pizza, $10 crab cake, and the unbelievbly rude service, we looked and saw that they charged us full price for our drinks (one round of their mediocere beer, 20 minutes before happy hour was over).  When we asked about it, the girl said she had entered in the drinks after the special was over. No \"I'm sorry\" or attempt to fix anything, thoughout out this whole thing.

The fake water damage on the walls and ceiling are painfully sad when you consider the mural they replaced (they make me think of the vanity of pre-shredded / damaged jeans). The menu is no longer comforting, and instead feels like it is trying to do too much. This wouldn't be a problem if the results were good, but unfortunately they are average at best. If I want to eat what's now on Magnolia's menu there are plenty of other places to go that offer the same items. In the end, that's the true problem: Magnolia no longer feels special--it is now just another eatery that is aiming for the charcuterie and cheese crowd.", "author": "Jeff S."}

CREEP! that AJ guy got what he deserved, worst server ever!", "author": "cesar z."}

They really filled a void in the neighborhood. But in the last few weeks, they are apparently trying to fit in with the other yuppie restaurants and did a complete overhaul of their menu: not only is their hamburger 14 dollars, but they got rid of a favorite: Buffalo Wings. Too \"gauche\" I guess, because now they have \"creative\" quail eggs instead! My boyfriend and I walked out, hopped on the 33, and went to Phoenix in Mission instead. There is officially nowhere to go in upper-Haight  for buffalo wings and a beer without being inundated by TVs. To top it off, I heard that they wouldn't donate a keg of free beer to a fund-raiser for a soup-kitchen. Addendum: The owner wrote me a friendly message in response, saying that they donate to causes when they can, that the rise in the burger price is due to the new high quality bun, and that they wanted to shift away from \"cheap\" food towards something more artisan. But I never thought it was cheap or boring before. In fact, it was always many steps above typical bar-food, while also being affordable for people in the neighborhood. I still feel very passionately that my neighborhood pub has been taken away.", "author": "Jerry P."}
