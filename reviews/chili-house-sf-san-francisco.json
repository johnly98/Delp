I came here Sunday at 1pm with reservation, it's actually not a long wait with reservation. We, party of two, waited for about ten minutes and got seated in a clean table. The environment of the house is in a very traditional Chinese feeling. We ordered 5 dishes and they are all very good that I would highly recommend to try!!\n\n1. Beijing pot stickers \u934b\u8cbc\n2. Tan Tan noodle \u64d4\u64d4\u9eb5\n3. Pebbly jellied meat \u6c34\u6676\u9b5a\u51cd\n4. Pork with Szechuan pickled mustard broth \u9178\u83dc\u767d\u8089\n5. Peking duck \u5317\u4eac\u70e4\u9d28\n\nFood impressions\n1. Very appetizing to eat before enjoying the real entree. This pot stick is a very traditional Beijing food that I couldn't believe I can try in SF (I have tried it once when I travelled back to china and they tasted almost the same!) The pork in the pot stick is very fresh and savory! Give it a try and you will love it!\n2. The Tan Tan noodle is sooooo good! It smells so delicious and spicy, but actually it isn't that spicy. I would give this noodle a five star, because it tasted very good like traditional north Chinese's handmade noodle!\n3. The pebbly jellied meat is very great and it looks so cute! It uses some yellow-bean to make the \"jellied meat\" in a fish-like shape, added with the special homemade sauce, and made it tasted so good as an appetizer before meal!\n4. This is an entree that the cook highly recommended us to try, and it's in the \"secret menu\" that not much known of. It tasted so good and it has my favorite vermicelli in it!! It is very good to eat with white rice, because the meat has absorbed all the flavor of the broth and became very savory!\n5. This is my favorite dish of the night! I always love the way how Chinese cooked the duck, and this is my favorite cooking method! We enjoyed the special taste of Beijing Roast Duck by covering the slices with special sauce jam and green-onion shreds on a soft flat bread. And after that, they cooked a soup with the rest of the duck (the part that couldn't be sliced down). They cooked a duck in two ways, so we can enjoy both the sliced duck and the soup! I love this so much!\n\nService impressions\nFast, competent, and efficient wait-staff. Very nice and patient to introduce you their famous foods!\n\nWould definitely come back!!", "author": "Patricia L."}

This place is a perfect place to go if you want to bring guests to entertain with the kungfu tea show, or just simply to enjoy their delicious food!\n\nParking is a street lot, which is expected in SF. \n\nWhat we ordered;\n1. Kungfu Tea- actually this is the main reason why I went to this restaurant, I wanted to show my kids and my mother how cool the kungfu tea performance was. The price quite be steep but my kids and mom really enjoyed the performance. Something that you don't get to see in San Jose. \n2. Beef Wrap. Juicy beef meat wrapped with chinese tortilla skin. Inside you would see some veggies, some sauce that made it all so good. \n3. Noodle with Chilli Oil. The noodle is not soggy, chewy, chilli oil is not that hot. Definitely will re order this dish if we're planning to come back. \n4. Steamed Scallops and Steamed pork dumpling. These are also good as well. Juicy on the inside, and most importantly the dumpling's skin is not that thick. Some places sell their dumpling skin way too thick that you feel like just eating flour. Unlike this one, the portion of the meat was generous as well. \n5. Shiumai - nothing really extra ordinary. I prefer the ones that still have chunks of shrimp inside. But not bad for the taste itself. \n6. Fried Noodle - I ordered this dish specifically for my kids, and they totally loved it. \n7. Peking Duck. GET THIS DISH WHILE YOU'RE HERE!! Because this is what they are famous for! Duck was juicy, not too dry. They will slice is in front of you with the walking tray, and they will serve the duck bone as a soup with veggies that will be served after all the dish came out. You usually eat the sliced duck wrapped in thin flour skin along with sliced cucumbers and some hoisin sauce. So good!\n\nWill come back for sure!", "author": "Maureen M."}

Service was friendly but a little chaotic, lots of food both in varieties and portions but with some hits and misses. All the dishes were plated beautifully, kudos to the chefs;  tea serving with the super long neck kettle from a distance was fun and interesting to watch.     \nThe starters were all pretty good, chicken in spicy sauce, couple's delight,  pig skin jello in a fish mold and my favorite the bitter melon ribbon in honey sauce, which was pleasing to the eyes and taste buds.\nDim sum were done well, the fried egg rolls were crispy, Peking shao mai was tasty and juicy which I liked better then the Cantonese style, dan dan noodles had good texture but a little too spicy for my taste.\nThere were many large plates; the one dish we enjoyed the most was the seafood stew with prawns, clams and fish, all poached perfectly in a tasty spicy broth. The Peking duck carved table side was decent and stir fried pea shoots is always a crowd pleaser. A repeating theme in several of the dishes was over frying (and the reason for 3 instead 4 stars). The large prawns in mayo sauce was dry and tough; sweet and sour fish, same issue, even the baby meat balls although very tasty can be cooked a little less.  The platter of sweets was again interesting and fun to explore. \nDefinitely a place worth coming back for and hopefully they can better control the frying time.", "author": "Julie W."}

I'm not too sure if they've had a change in hands at some point over the years - possibly around the same time they started hard selling their Peking duck - but the spicy staples that I've once loved from them are loved no more.\n\nWhile the Couple's Delight, Twice-cooked Pork, and Spicy Wontons (I order these three specifically, every time) are still good, they're just simply not what they used to be. Though I find their staple dishes a tad lacking, I do quite enjoy their Salted Egg Yolk Pumpkin but the Peking Duck in all honesty, is just \"okay\" in my opinion. I won't say that I've had better in The City - because I haven't - but the fact that they praise their designated chef's resume so often, at the least, I kind of wish it all lived up to its hype. Again, just my two cents.\n\nI will always come back to this place but I still wish they hadn't changed whatever it was they changed in the quality/recipe/technique they once mastered for their more simpler dishes.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

Big mistake as the wait was over an hour. There were several parties ahead of us that had even left because they were tired of waiting. When we finally got a table, we were ignored for quite some time. We were seated before the table across from us, however, the other table was given tea, had their order taken, and even start receiving their dishes BEFORE we were even acknowledged...and it was only because we had to manually flag a waiter down before any service was given to our table. \n\nAs for the food....the Shanghai Wine Chicken ($10.95) was tender and delicious. This was one of the best wine chicken I've tried and my favorite out of everything we ordered. \n\nThe Cauliflower with Smoked Pork in Mini Flaming Pot ($15.95) was another good order. It is a little spicy, but the flavors were pretty good. \n\nTan Tan Noodles ($7.95) - I did not like this dish as the sauce was too spicy and did not have the right flavor. I would not order this one again. \n\nCouple's Delight ($8.95) - Although I did enjoy the beef slices, tripe, and tendon pieces, the flavor was too spicy for me. Also, the spices were tiny and scattered throughout the dish, a little too messy. If you enjoy REALLY spicy flavor, you'll probably enjoy this dish. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience, but the wait was too long, the wait for service was too long, and a few of the dishes were too spicy. Their Peking Duck looked pretty good, which I would be interested to try in the future. This restaurant does not provide complimentary tea, they charge $1.75 for a bowl of rice, 30 cents for each take out container you request, and 10 cents for a to-go bag. Just mentioning the small details. Also, another piece of homework I didn't do...Groupon offers 20% cash back through your credit card.

What stood out to me was the amazing sauce that accompanied it. It was like a mixture of hoisin, oyster, and some some floral notes (I would recommend, drinking the hot Jasmine tea with this dish to bring out more the floral notes). And the pancakes that came with it were so incredibly thin, which is great so that you don't fill up on the carbs. This meal also came with green onions and cucumber. And they offer to make a soup of the carcass, stir fry it, or deep fry it. We had it deep fried with salt and pepper, which was good, but we would've preferred it in a soup. Still very delicious. \n\n2) The Szechwan Green beans were spectacular. The green beans are dusted in flower and fried for a light crispiness and then topped with fermented black beans (for saltiness), chopped nuts, and roasted Szechwan pepper (tasted like camp fire marshmallows and a mild spiciness). \n\n3) Spicy Wontons: The wontons were amazing. Most people forget to dip them in a little bit of soy sauce, which is why they think it's flavorless. it sits a pool of chili oil which looks intense, but they're actually beautifully balanced and not over powering at all. \n\nWe would've loved to order more, but it was just two of us and we were already so full. We would love to come back again for dim sum.", "author": "Lizzy S."}

The fresh fish in spicy oil, salted egg yolk pumpkin, the tan tan mien noodles...\n\nI actually like the tan tan mien noodles better here. They're spicier. \n\nTheir fish in chili oil is pretty good too but somehow seems watered down in comparison to its sister.\n\nSalted egg yolk pumpkin was okay as well too.

At least that's what Bread sang back in 1971, and OK, maybe Confucius said it a few centuries earlier. But it resonated when I walked by this popular eatery while strolling on Clement and saw a close-up photo of the Poached Chicken in Explosive Chili Peppers. I decided I needed to try it, so a few weeks later, I came back for lunch. In the meantime, I perused some of the online articles about this place and discovered it shares the same owner as Z&Y in Chinatown (review: http://bit.ly/2x4YGpm). They appear to be famous for their Peking Duck as well as spicy Sichuan-style dishes like the one that caught my eye.\n\nI was by myself, so I couldn't find it in my conscience to order anything beyond the $15.95 poultry I saw. It came in a fairly large bowl and the intimidated my rather sensitive palate with the heavy oil and intense red of the peppers which completely overwhelmed the smallish chicken pieces and heavily boiled vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/2LmbYkp). I have to say I was disappointed as there appeared to be more skin than meat in the dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2s0oyO3), and it required at least one bowl of the $1.75 Steamed White Rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2LmcWNz). I'm no Sichuan culinary expert, but I could barely eat a third of it. So much for the worth of a picture.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...spicy and oily concoction that disappointed me\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious and not too crowded on a Thursday afternoon\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...not too friendly or forthcoming with insight on Sichuan cuisine\nTOTAL - 3 stars...for Sichuan and Peking Duck aficionados only", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-15", "description": "4/14/18\n\nThere are good Chinese restaurants, GREAT Chinese restaurants, and TRANSCENDENT Chinese restaurants, (among all the weeds.)  My gf's a treasure hunter, and food is her prize.  We heard among our friends, friends of friends, wanna be's on the net, fellow chefs-in-training, and even the birds singing into the sky, that there's this restaurant that would be TRANSCENDENT...\n\nFrom the owner of Z&Y, (or is it Z&X... X&Y... hmmmmmm.)... well, THAT one that US Presidents like to visit when in SF, that person also opened this Chili House & Peking Duck.  The bar's high.  The heavens aren't much higher.  Was this Chili House a success?\n\n..... first, before I begin, I just want to say that despite the heavy tailoring towards non-Chinese ethnicities, and despite the very mixed cultural makeup of the patrons, despite your initial assumptions and stereotypes, this would be a Full Fledged Yellow-Blooded True Chinese restaurant.  So...\n\n...for those that aren't Chinese, you might have heard snippets here and there about Chinese table manners--don't point your chopsticks at people, don't stab your chopsticks into the rice, pour tea for everyone first even if they're too far to reach, elders first, etc.; BUT, I tell you, one thing that definitely will piss off all Chinese patrons would be ordering FRIED RICE, ORANGE CHICKEN, and CHOW MEIN.\n\nWe looked to our side and there was a table of 10, all non-Chinese.  All were happy and smiling--awesome.  Then we saw on their lazy-susan an array of fried rice, orange fried chicken and chow mein.  Basically Panda Express served fancy.  The selection was striking, being the largest table, and surround by dozens of tables topped with steaming clay pots, and big bowls topped with thick red oil.\n\nJust don't okay?\n\nAlright: dungeon level hardcore or not???...\n\n1. Peking Duck $43.95 \"served with roasted duck, pancakes, green onion, cucumber, and paste.  add $3 for extra green onion, cucumber and paste; add $5 for extra pancakes\":  \"Peking Duck\" is actually part of the restaurant name.  So, better be beyond heavenly good right?  Well, sorry to say, you know what's coming--it SUCKED.  Like, not inedible terrible--ironically I only had that bad of Peking Duck once, and it was in Beijing (Mandarin spelling of the Cantonese word \"Peking\" if you didn't know).  But other than that one duck, this was the next worst.  The skin was at times hard, and other times just uninspiring (as opposed to the epic buttery crunch awesomeness of the best), and the flesh was actually pretty dry.\n\nTo make it even worse, they're REALLY stingy with those pancakes, giving you only about 8, which totally is not even close to enough, and have the balls to charge $5 if you want more.  I would say taste-wise this duck is 3/10. but the price and balls, and even being the restaurant name..... 2/10\n\n2. Pickled Veg & Fish Clay Pot $18 \"fish fillet boiled in our traditional Szechuan pickled mustard broth with tofu\":  Ahhhh.... NOW we're talking.  DELICIOUS fish broth, topped with pickled goodness, and tender fillets of fish.  This you want.  10/10\n\n3. Xinjiang Grilled Lamb Chops $16.95:  These are lamb ribs basically, missing much of the expensive steak meat.  Which is fine, as I like ribs.  The odd thing was out of the 5 pieces, each one was a different shape and size.  Flavoring to me was good, but my gf wasn't impressed though--but she grew up in Xinjiang, so who knows what she's thinking.  Pretty juicy and tender.  I should note, this was our friend's favorite of the night, a White girl with us.  7/10\n\n4. Bean Jello in Red Chili Sauce:  Apparently a cousin to my gf's favorite dish of all time--Liang Pi.  Served the same way--thick and delicious red oil sauce, some cucumber, and other mystery tidbits.  The only difference being the noodles, which according to my gf is made from the starch of a different plant, which makes for a more \"Jell-O\" like consistency, instead of being chewy like Liang Pi.  It's a bit hard to eat with chopsticks though, since the noodles are brittle and break.  Glad I got to try this though since I've never seen it at another restaurant.  9/10\n\n5. Chinese Cabbage with Chili Pepper $10.95:  Sigh... I write too much.  Out of space... so, it was great.  8/10\n\n............. okay, I didn't talk about the other unique thing of this place: the entertainment.  Yes, there's entertainment!  Want a Kung-fu tea service with a long sword-like tea pot?  How 'bout a very traditional multi-face Chinese opera'ish dance to watch while you eat?  (Gf says it's actually a special trade in China--only passed through apprenticeship, after bowing to master's and showing your deep respect to those who might teach you.)  Personally all I could think was somehow Jaqen H'ghar, the Faceless Man, figured he needed some money and started working here in SF...\n\n....alas... it was not transcendent.  Too much hype.

The presentation is also quite pleasing.    \n\nI ate at this place when it first opened and it was excellent all around, but how quickly things change.  I predict that this place is not long for the world.  \n\nThis time the problems began right away.  It took ages just to place an order.  Once the order was in, the noodles arrived quickly and we polished them off just as quickly.  We waited another fifteen minutes for the dumplings before they arrived, and they were luke-warm (I assume because they had been sitting on the counter and no server thought fit to bring them). After sitting another fifteen minutes, we had to push the waitress, telling her we were pressed for time and that we were still waiting for our appetizer!  It arrived quickly, but was cold through and through. \n\nThe flavors were good, but the prep/serve times etc were ridiculous.  Don't know who is to blame, but whoever is running the kitchen should be fired (drawn and quartered) and someone who knows their stuff hired.  Or else a new wait staff needs to be hired.  Bad management.  Will probably not give this place a second chance.  Your best bet, if you live in the SF area, would be to order take-out.

We waited about 5 minutes to get seated. A long line started to form at 6:00pm so we just beat the rush. Overall a great experience and we will be back! I want to try the other dishes!\n\nFOOD\nCucumber chili fish- lots of peppercorns and a slow burn which I like. Fish tasted a little fishy (in a good way!) and I feel my mouth salivating now as I'm reminiscing.\nBitter melon slices with honey- served over ice and very refreshing and the bitter melon was not unbearably bitter. Perfect amount of honey, not too sweet. \nBeijing potstickers- super juicy meat inside and delicious with a little chili oil. Looks like rectangular spring rolls, not the common Dumpling look a like. \nChicken ginseng soup- small order was pretty large and we had to pack the rest to go. Good flavor\n\nSERVICE\nGreat! The waitress came over to take out order shortly but we weren't even ready haha. Then a waiter came back. Both were friendly and spoke both English and Mandarin. Food came out at a good pace. Saw other tables who ordered duck had a waiter served the duck from the side of the table- table service!\n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE\nDecorated with Chinese calligraphy/words on walls and posters of mouthwatering dishes (terrible if you're waiting for a table and starving.. you will become hangry).

Wasn't there a popular chain called Chili's before?  \n\nMy family and I came to this restaurant after my father saw a commercial advertising that this restaurant had a chef straight from Peking, China cook for you.  When we came, I asked.  The chef is from Peking, but most of the other chefs are from Szechuan.  So food should mostly be Szechuan.  Customers were a mix group of outsiders(nonAsian) or Asians that are willing to come here for just the presentation and not the food.\n\nEach dish took at least 30 minutes to wait.\n\nWe ordered the Hot Sour Soup.  Tasted like soy sauce and just powdered pepper.  The soup was black and the tofu was hard.  It had no contrast of Hot and Sour and barely had any ingredients inside.  We complained to the waiter that it was nasty tasting.  He was reluctant to do anything. We asked to exchange it.  He did, but then came back and told us that we didn't know how to order food.  That we ordered too little and that we shouldn't eat here if we didn't know what food tasted like!!\n\nI was so insulted.  By the way,  he wears glasses and is stocky build.  Avoid him at all cost if you can, he has an attitude.  But he will serve you well if you are nonAsian.\nI would have left, but my dad assisted on staying for the rest of our meal.\n\nWe exchanged the Hot Sour Soup for Egg Flower Soup.  We waited and waited, finished our other food before the soup arrived.  It had absolutely no taste.  Too much meat.\n\nNow I\"m not picky at all for food.  I would eat just about any Asian food because I am Asian, but gosh did it not have any taste.  It was like drinking water and they just threw meat into the bowl!\n\nOverall, the dishes were small and tasteless; expensively targeted for those who want to throw their money away and don't know what Asian food taste like.  They tailor to the tasteless.  You have to order a lot for them to give you a lot.  \n\nThe Peking Duck is $40.00 here.  There are better, cheaper places for Peking duck. Folks, just because the chef is from Peking doesn't mean you are getting the exquisite, authentic food directly from China.  You are being pulled for your money for food you think is Chinese.\n\nWe had ordered the Fried Rice, but they never placed the order and so we just asked for the check.\n\nWe noticed they charged for the Hot Sour Soup and were not only careless in removing this off the bill (or at least giving us half price off), but were going to charge us for 2 soups!\nVery careless!\n\nBottom Line: This restaurant caters to those who have never ate Peking Duck before and charge you sky high prices.  They make most of their business off of this dish and this dish alone.", "author": "K G."}

However, I wouldn't say it was a special or memorable dish.\n\n- Pork Intestine with Blood and Tofu\nAMAZING. Our favorite dish of the night by far. This is a hard dish to find in the US and even harder to find a place that prepares it well. The flavors were superb, spicy enough to have that numbing feeling but not too spicy that we couldn't taste the other flavors. Would recommend that anyone who visits this restaurant get this dish!\n\nOverall, we had great service and great food.

I guess hit or miss on the duck. I still enjoy the chef cutting it in front of you. I usually come here only for their Peking duck and their other dishes was just ok. Today I tried two new dishes. Their beef roll and tan tan noodles. The tan tan flavor is actually really good but they need to work on their noodle. The beef roll is ok nothing wow same with XLB. Oh their service was really good. The young kid waiter was awesome. Overall 3.5 star. If they can be more consistent on their Peking duck flavor and work on more chewy noodles in the tan tan sauce than I can move into their restaurant lol.

Some people that walked in after us were seated before us. I highly recommend making reservations before coming here.\n\nWe already knew what we wanted to order so immediately after being seated we placed our order. The food was brought out so quickly (within 5-10 minutes). I was definitely impressed. The food was on point as well. My favorite was the poached beef. Wow. So tender and had some good heat to it. The green beans were also delicious. We appreciated the nice discount the restaurant offers on the steamed dumplings with Yelp check in.\n\nWe also tried the tan tan noodles. I didn't think they were such a big deal though. They lacked flavor and there was very little meat.\n\nMy parents thought the food was overly spicy and salty but the rest of us thought the food was  perfect for szechuan cuisine.

They don't give you the whole duck, which makes me wonder what they do after they're finished cutting slices for customers?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-05", "description": "For a special occasion, our family of 7 reserved the Beijing Banquet of 14 courses, and $418 later, I was completely underwhelmed. The service is spotty, which might have been forgivable if the cuisine was stellar. The restaurant is trying to pass this off as a high-end Emperor's tasting menu, but the dishes were lackluster and not fresh (except for the duck). They also charge 19% gratuity (not stated anywhere when making reservations). When you arrive, there is no menu describing each dish. I requested one, and was given the a la carte menu. I asked again for the menu for our banquet, and I was given a 8.5\"x11\" sheet of paper with a handwritten menu in Sharpie marker, with item names only and no description of each item. Service was typical Chinese restaurant service. I wouldn't complain elsewhere, but for the price, it should be better. \n\nLet's start: \n1) The sweets were at the table before we arrived. They were stale, chalky tasting, overly sweet, and obviously a day or three old.\n\n2) The cold appetizer dish: this came after the sweets, when it should have been first. This was probably one of the better dishes. The poached chicken was soft and moist. The rest was forgettable. \n\n3) Strips of bitter melon: all presentation and no substance. It was covered in a syrupy glaze that tasted so artificial and was presented on a bed of ice on a dish that was wrapped in cling wrap (why?). We barely touched it. See photo of the dish AFTER eating. \n\n4) Soup of winter squash and seafood in a young coconut shell: it was an odd bright yellow color and thickened with some sort of agent. It was sickeningly sweet, like they added sugar to it. They probably did. Seafood was fishy. \n\n5) Braised baby spareribs with mint: I'm assuming since it doesn't say it's cold appetizer that it shouldn't have been cold, but it was cold. However, if it was supposed to be cold, they should have said so. It was fried and dry, almost like jerky and tasted old - like it was fried a day or two ago and then re-fried before serving us, but why it was cold, I have no idea. \n\n6) Peking duck: this was the best of all the dishes. The meat was moist, and not too fatty and the skin was thin and crispy. Flavor was pretty good but not as good as Great Wall of China in Berkeley if you want good duck. \n\n7) Crab-avocado pastries and large prawns, glazed with horseradish mayonnaise. The prawns were coated in gobs of horseradish mayo and there were SPRINKLES on it. The kind you get on your ice cream at Baskin Robbins 20 years ago. \n\n8) Four-happiness dumplings. Bland. The wrapper was mushy.\n\n9) Beijing-style pot stickers: too much wrapper to filling ratio. The filling was ok tasting. \n\n10) Braised and fried lamb rib coated in cumin and chiles. There was nothing braised about this dish. My husband was only able to cut off 3 pieces that were 1\"long x1/4\" thick that was stringy dried fried meat. The rest was fried to a crisp.\n\n11) Beijing-style shao mai: these were ok, nothing special. \n\n12) Baby meatballs with baby spinach. Served lukewarm, tasted like they were fried and frozen and then re-fried upon serving. The spinach was very salty and overly seasoned. \n\n13) Catfish (or a fish like catfish - how would I know since the menu said \"whole fish\") in a peppercorn and chili oil broth. Fish was fishy and coated in oil, lots of skin. \n\n14) Pastry chicks filled with red bean paste. The pastry shell was hard and not flaky and tasted like hardened lard. \n\nI'm not sure how they got a good review in the SF Chronicle, but people save your money and go to Old Mandarin Islamic Chinese or Beijing Restaurant.", "author": "Patricia L."}

I wanted to try a new place and really taste authentic Chinese food. I was getting tired of the same restaurants and food. My family and I came around 7 pm on a Friday night. We parked on a meter and since it was after 6 pm you don't have to pay.  We were a bit nervous thinking there would be a long wait since this place was number 1 on the article. Luckily, there was a table and we were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nNow, I was unsure of what to order and I didn't want to go with the typical orange chicken, fried rice, panda express type of order. I wanted to see if the waiter had any recommendations but he just seemed really eager to take our order. I ended up choosing the dan dan noodles and they were extremely bland. I asked to confirm if this was the right order and the order said, \"Yeah, numb,\" to my dismay. We also ordered soup dumplings since they were half off if you check in on Yelp. Those were pretty good. My mom got the mushu pork and liked it. We also ordered the onion cakes which were average and bland tasting. As an entre\u00e9, I got the salt and pepper chicken which was good, but I felt like there was more flour than meat. My dad ordered half a duck and he liked it. This place seems to be known for their Peking duck. \n\nOverall, we had an average experience in terms of service. I think we would've had a better taste experience had we ordered more popular dishes and dishes we were familiar with.", "author": "Dan G."}

First, the customers are maily Chinese (good sign of credibility for good Chinese food). Secondly, the presentation of the dishes are well put together. And thirdly, the combinations of spices is very acxurate to the region of China where it is from.\n\nThe first time i went there i was with non Chinese people so i had to Americanize our order to satisfy their non-sophisticated pallet. So i ordered Americanized items like orange chicken, egg rolls and chow mein. It was horrendous but i was a team player and like Jay-z says, \"I had to dumb it down for my fans.\" Indeed i did.\n\n2 weeks later i told muself i had to come back a do it for real and redeem myself to myself. This time i came with the love of my life who has a food pallet that i have never seen anyone reach in my life. We walked in and immediately the owner noticed me. I told him that his place had potential and that my last experience was mediocre because of the people i was with. He told me \"give me your menus and i will prepare you a dinner myself that's not for white people. You will love it.\"  So I put the fate of my pallet into his hands. What happened next was a blissful trip to North China in the niddle of Upper Sunset SF. \n\nFirst item was a pepper ground lamb dun dun noodles served in a bowl with basil leaves. It was the most exotic comfort food i ever had. Dripping with wet chilli oil with a minty taste and meaty finish. I was sold\n\nThe next thing was a the pepercorn and chilli tea smoked duck. It was savory, spicy and the skin on the duck was smokey and crispy. It was as satisfying as a cigar but with food.\n\nThen came the siew loong bao (a Northern china staple). These steamed pork dumplings came in a bamboo basket with a side of vineager ginger dipping sauce. One bite into this gelatinous ball and all the juices came shooting out in an orgasmic fashion. It was juicy, savory and most of all, delicious\n\nLastly we had a melin fish soup. It had chunks of fatty fish  and fish fat floating on top of the melons. It was stable, even in flavor and really brought the meal full circle.\n\nThis meal was so good that I felt like that nerdy pimple faced kid who scored with the hottest girl on prom night.

Well, first of all, the service people, including a manager like person, were super racist - when they saw non-Chinese customers, they smiled and they welcomed them wholeheartedly. During the meal, they would talk to these non-Chinese customers and asked them opinions about the meal. However, to Chinese looking customers, they simply tried their best to ignore them. The difference in services was as wide as the Pacific Ocean although we Chinese know what to order and actually ordered more expensive food.\nIn terms of the food quality, this place is trying to do it all but failed. Peking duck is Pekingese cuisine and has nothing to do with Szechuan cuisine. To have some Peking food mixed with Szechuan food and label itself \"Chili House\"will not work for people who really know Chinese food well. As some other reviews indicated, their Duck is just so so and the duck cutting performance is just average. The soup dumpling is Shanghainese food and also has nothing to do with any of their specialty. Because they wanted to fit every possible taste of Chinese cuisines, none of them excelled. The Northern dishes we ordered did not do it right . Some of the things they advertised that their service person didn't even know what they were. I believe that the guy who is busy doing duck cutting performance is a real chef from Northern part of China. However, at least teach your staff how to greet your Chinese customers and teach them that \"Wandou Huang\" and \"Lvdagun\" are not Cantonese or Szechuanese Dim Sum. \nThe restaurant is also a very tiny one trying to pretend to be a bigger one. Ding Tai Feng started in a very tiny place but evolved into a huge company by only making two dumplings famous.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-05", "description": "Welcome to the Szechuan world! Chili House is all about bold and robust flavors of Szechuan cuisine, a cuisine known for the generous usage of garlic and chili peppers. Learn about how the unique Szechuan peppercorns separate CH from other Americanized Szechuan restaurants. When it comes to ethnic foods, I am all for authenticity and the virtually 100% Chinese crowd bears testimony to this. Don't get intimidated by the fiery red chili oil and the gazillion chili peppers in the sauce as CH's job didn't just end here. CH also juggles to balance heat with the numbing effects of Mala sauce to produce a symphony of flavors. Being the novice that I am, I have to admit that not all dishes in CH were pleasing to my palate.  This might just be me. \n\nMy first visit to CH was indeed a learning experience. Staying with the true and tried, I ordered Tan Tan Noodles ($6.95) to share. It was the sauce that made the noodles absolutely wonderful. The chili oil was plentiful although happily blended with vinegar and sesame oil to enhance the taste and dilute the heat. A subtle sourness in the sauce was the key. Noodles were al dente and topped with chopped peanuts and minced pork that acted more like garnish than intended protein. The heat was surprisingly mild, mild enough that any spice wimp can handle!\n \nI have often seen Shanghai Style Wine Chicken ($7.95) in Szechuan restaurants, a Shanghainese dish that I truly enjoy.  My guess the whole chicken was marinated in Shaoxing wine (a Chinese rice wine) and steamed perfectly so that the skin remained intact and the meat was firm, not tough or dried out. CH's rendition was flawless except for one big transgression IMO. The chicken was almost too salty to be eaten without rice.\n\nMcDonald's has Chicken McNuggets. The Japanese has chicken karaage. CH has their very own Chicken with Explosive Chili Pepper ($10.95), a name that couldn't have been more graphic and intimidating. There was this pile of red chili peppers where the chicken nuggets were buried.  As to why the nuggets were not more 'explosive' remained a mystery even up to now! Kudos to the chef as the meat was moist. The flavorful 5-spice marinade differentiated Szechuan style from the Japanese and of course McDonald's in a good way. This was where my love for this dish ended.  CH added an inordinate amount of Szechuan peppercorns that overwhelmed everything else. I am still new to this weird fragrance so while others savored it, I find that a total overkill. \n\nThe House Special Fresh Fish Filet Boiled in House Spicy Sauce ($15.95) was like their signature dish but failed me for two reasons.  CH carried only one kind of fish and that was catfish. This is my least favorite fish regardless how it is prepared except maybe deep fried Southern style. Then there was again the ubiquitous Szechuan pepper sauce blended in a pool of chili oil. It was my mistake not to pre-check the kind of fish used before ordering. Nonetheless, the fish had a soft texture and the elaborate spicing concealed the inherent muddy taste. They were generous with the fish portions and the Napa cabbage did help break the monotony. This was the spiciest dish of all and I could have enjoyed this dish more if the peppercorns were toned down to a more subtle level.\n\nIn spite of me not savoring the food as much as I should like the rest of the diners, I can still honestly say the food here is legit. I definitely need to first acquire and appreciate the new taste and fragrance of Szechuan peppercorns in the numbing Mala sauce and give CH another shot when I am ready.", "author": "Geoff G."}

We ordered a bunch of amazingly delicious entrees and left more than happy.\n\nI'm sad to see that between eating here and the time that this review is posted there is a Consumer Alert in effect for: Poor Food Safety Score from Yelp due to a recent inspection, where this facility received a food safety rating that is in the bottom 5% locally, and is categorized by inspectors as \"poor.\"\n\nIt kind of makes this review a moot point. However my iron stomach and I will proceed.\n\n-Spicy Dumplings ($7.95 at time of review)- Really good. Really, really good. The presentation was super cute and the food was flavorful and filling.\n\n-Beef Pancake (price varies due to market)- HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE. I was surprised at how much I loved this dish. I am one of those genetically mutated individuals whose taste buds think that cilantro taste like soap. This dish however, was the first time I genuinely appreciated cilantro. \n\n-Peking Duck- AMAZING! The best bet is to call ahead a few days and special order this so you're not disappointed when they run out. The chef will come out and carve the duck for you. Then once the meat is served they take the rest of the duck in the back and deep fry the bones & leftovers and bring it back out for you. I'm not a huge fan of the fried bones but I know there are some people out there that love it. \n\n-Ma Po Tofu ($4. 95 at time of review)- This was good. However due to the other food ordered this dish didn't stick out as much as it would have if I wasn't with a group and ordered it alone.  \n\nI'm sure that we had two other dishes but to be honest I think that I can't remember what they're called because they didn't stick out to me as much. This is a fun place for a group to come to. There were 5 of us and our bill came out to about $35 a person.  \n\nOnce yelp removes the Consumer Alert I'm sure I'll be back.

We were well into our meal when a server gave us each a bowl of white rice, as is common at Chinese restaurants. What is also common is that rice is included with the meal, and since we didn't even ask for it in the first place, we were put off by the fact that we were charged $1.85 a bowl for it. If we had asked for it and been subsequently charged for it, that would have been one thing. But we did not request it and then got charged for it, which is not OK.\n\nBut on to the decent. We went for a late lunch on Christmas (knowing that they would be opened) after a long day of walking. The place was packed and there was a waiting list, but they did a very good job of accommodating as many customers as possible. We waited maybe twenty minutes before they offered to sit us at a large table with another family, which we were more than happy to do. We ordered up some soup which we had asked to be out first (it ended up coming out last), followed by some dumplings, green beans, duck, and a couple rounds of beers. It was solid food, and we were simply happy to be able to sit and eat indoors after walking around the city for the past four hours.\n\nWhen the check came, I noticed that they had charged us for an extra beer that we did not order. They happily corrected the (I'm assuming honest) mistake, but when the check came back a second time is when we noticed that we had been charged for rice that we had been given, but had not asked for. Since it wasn't a significant amount of money and the servers were still running around, we decided to let it slide so that we could get going. Even if it's only a few bucks, that's not a good way of doing business and it's disrespectful to your clientele.", "author": "Reid C."}

So one night while channel surfing I saw their ad playing on KTSF and decided to give a try. I have been to Chili house before and didn't really like their food compared to the other location in Chinatown. We came on Chinese new year's eve, place is packed but since we had a reservation we were sat down pretty quickly. Ordered bunch food and all of them taste pretty good. Peking duck is prepared at the table, the duck chef pushes the cart to your table, show you the whole duck, then he will carve it in front of you. Very authentic! just like the one you get in Beijing. Duck is very juicy and the flour pancake is home made, this is what you should eat the duck with, NOT with buns. You can choose what you want to do with the leftover, either have the chef make salt and pepper duck or soup. I would go with the soup but salt and pepper is good too.\n\nI am not sure if they really hired a new chef or the chef really listened to the suggestions and improved but the food does taste better now compare to the last time I came. We will be back again more often now to try other beijing style dim sum.\n\nOne suggestion to the restaurant if you are reading the review, please do not add sesame oil (\u9999\u6cb9\uff09into the sweet bean sauce \uff08\u751c\u9762\u9171\uff09 for the peking duck.", "author": "William C."}

They had a very good business apparently.  Was the food good as well?  Let's check it out.\n\nWe didn't want to have a big meal, so just ordered the following and that's what we thought:\n\nVegetables (warm):  Dry Braised String Beans..................way tooooo salty!\nMeat (Cold side dish) : Couple's Delight.............................way tooooo oily!\nAppetizers (warm): Beef Roll Pancakes.............................not bad but not fantastic either.\nSteam Buns (Shanghai Xiao Long Bao).............................An Ok for me but my friend said not good.  He is way more experienced on food than I do.\nDrink (Cold to room temperature): Soy Milk.......................they advertised as self made but we saw it was poured out from a plastic bottle that we can find in the oriental grocery stores.\n\nThe first two dishes put us off guard and almost damaged our appetize.  They were way too salty for our tastes.  But, my friend said when he was invited by friends from mainland China to their house or to the restaurants they picked, the dishes were always very salty and oily.  Hey we eat salty food in other part of China region as well but NOT THAT SALTY and OILY!  So, maybe it was normal for them in mainland China but definitely not healthy.  \"Couple's Delight\" was supposed to have more oil than most of the dishes, but, the restaurant poured way too much oil for this style of dish.\n\nMight not go back.", "author": "TG B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-28", "description": "Well before coming here i did some reading on yelp, let me say the most helpful tip was that they take reservations. When i walked in they were busy, and some people were waiting to get seated. One of the tables were reserved but the other table was occupied. So we had to wait til they were done and then we got the table in time. While i waiting for the group to arrive, i looked at the menu and prices were very reasonable. We did a group of 18 people, for a go away party for a friend. For the seating situation they had a round table that fits 10 and another round table that fits 8 people. We couldn't put the tables together for some reason anyways we split the group up into 2 round tables. Then we order separate orders for the 2 tables. In my table i was sitting with the foodies so we had ordered their popular dishes and the more authentic dishes too. \n\nPICKLED SALTY CABBAGE \nThis dish is complimentary for each table. Its like a starter to munch on while your deciding what to order. It was salty and wasn't even sour. It had a weird taste to it too. It did look good but when i took a bite of it, i left it alone lol. and had to wash it down with water lol. \n\nDRUNKEN CHICKEN \nWe started with the Drunken chicken. It was strong with an alcohol flavor. The chicken was tender and juicy. The presentation looked great too. We had a table of 8 in our table. We all had a pc or 2 and was enough.\n\nSPICY CHILI COLD BEEF TENDON \nThis dish was served chilled. The warm hot oil on the meat did made the meat luke warm. The meat was soaked up in the red orange chili oil which was mild. it was over a bed of chives which made the presentation of the dish look good. \n\nGINSENG SOUP \nThe soup was served in a clay soup pot. The pot was traditional made out of ceramic. When the herb soup is serve in that tastes the best because it keeps warm and gives it extra temperature for the herb to come out into the soup. There were lots of herbs, ginseng, and chicken, and gogi berries floating on top. Everyone loved the soup, but didn't like eating the ginseng because it looked funny. To me this soup reminds me of my childhood memories growing up to all kinds of traditional herbal soup from the asian culture. \n\nSALTED EGG YOLK PRAWNS AND CORN \nThis dish was definitely tasty! so they batter up the corn and prawns with some egg yolk and batter and then deep fry it. it was crisp all around and in every bite. Them kernel corns were so scrumptious! i did enjoy it a lot with my steam rice. \n\nSTIR FRY PORK BELLY WITH CHIVES\nThis one was one of my favorites to pair with my steam rice. it was more on the salty side and it was flavorful. the pork belly did have lots of fat on it with the lean meat too. this dish did make me want to run an extra 5k to burn it off. The chives were also soaked into the sauce. I only had 2 pcs since i didn't want to get a bigger tummy lol. i do recommend this dish if you want to spoil that body. lol \n\nHOT POT CHILI OIL FILET FISH \nI am not sure what kind of fish it is. It did taste buttery so we were guessing its cat fish. The fish was inside a pot of chili oil. Also there were lots of dried chili peppers on top which they did help remove it once it got to the table. The fish was very tender and non spicy and bland. don't let the look of the dried chili pepper fool you on being it hot spicy. Also the fish was boneless so that was a plus. \n\nSWEET AND SOUR FISH WITH FRIED TOFU (AKA SECRET MENU)\nOk this dish was from previous experience. The fish was fried then soaked in chili oil to make it well done. The fish was crisp on the outer but inside it was mooshy. The presentation overall was a 10! it was served in a big white plate with fried tofu around the fish and then sweet and sour sauce drenched in the plate. The sweet and sour sauce was good. The fried tofu was crisp on the outside and inside of the tofu was soft and hot! overall this dish was so so to me. \n\nHONEY BITTERMELON \nThis dish was thinly cut bitter melon and served chilled with a light honey sweet taste to it. The bitter melon was served over a bed of ice to keep it chilled and lightly topped with finely chopped red bell pepper. This dish was interesting and definitely the bitter melon was bitter! it was different and interesting and definitely good for ig, fb, or for social media pic. \n\nOverall they don't have large table to host a big parties. they only have 3 max table to host large parties. plenty of small tables which is a plus for smaller parties. The tables were wobbly. It was hot inside, Then they open the door to let the fresh bay breeze in and cool us down at the end. The food was oily overall, it felt like i was getting a heart attack with all the oil intake lol. Half of the dishes were ordered were kind of bland, but looks really tasty in pictures and it isn't. They did have good service on refilling water 3 times when it was getting low. Also they did include a 15% gratuity to the bill so we didn't have to tip since its included.", "author": "Alex T."}

You don't really drink the broth because its hella spicy but the beef is perfect. They make rice pancakes here that are a lot like crepes but rubbery, liquid proof little guys that turn anything into finger food.\nHad orange chicken, perfectly cooked chicken that was moist with a crispy shell.

Just give them a wave and they come right over. It's a hard thing for me to do coming from fine dinning lol.

I was quite scared since I couldn't feel my mouth the last time I tried Szechuan cuisine. However, Chili House's spiciness is not full-on flaming, it is also quite flavorful. We went for an early dinner around 5:30pm so it was quite empty when we arrived. However, I did notice the restaurant got quite full around 6-6:30, so it may be wise to make reservations beforehand as suggested by other reviewers.\n\nWe ordered the hot and sour soup, mapo tofu with pork, mushrooms with seasonal vegetables, tan tan noodles, fish filet, and the grilled lambchops with garlic. I definitely recommend the mapo tofu with pork, tan tan noodles, and the lambchops. All the dishes were good, but these three were absolutely delicious! The mapo tofu was flavorful and I loved the aftertaste burn. Same for the tan tan noodles, except it was also a bit sour. Don't let the color of the tan tan noodles scare you, you'll regret not trying it! The lambchops were extremely tender and so flavorful from the garlic and chili peppers.\n\nThere is street parking, but it may be challenging depending on when you go. Service was just average, like any other Chinese restaurant. We went in with a party of 6 and our bill came out to $72+. Pretty decent since we ordered 6 dishes too.

It can get crowded and busy during peak dining hours - especially when the fog creeps into San Francisco!  \n\nChili House serves up Sichuan Chinese food that gradually makes your mouth feel the spiciness overtime!  \n\nBring a group instead of a plus one!  With so many dishes to choose from, it was too hard to resist just a few plates from the menu! \n\nTheir (Dan Dan Mein) Egg Noodles in a bowl reminded me a lot like Z&Y's style on how they make theirs.  I feel like this place is somewhat affiliated with Z&Y (located in Chinatown, San Francisco) because of their decor and the food presentation.\n\nI really liked their cold cucumber appetizer dish and Couple's Delight, which is a cold spicy beef starter!  Try to save some cold sliced up cucumbers for the main courses that are hot, hot, hot because it helps with calming down the spiciness.  The light vinegar taste to the cold cucumbers, helps to thin out the rich, spiciness of the other dishes!  The cold spicy beef platter is good, in general, throughout the meal!\n\nI didn't care for their Mixed hot pot dish nor their Stir-Fried Rice Cakes.  Their mixed ingredients in the hot pot, didn't compliment well with each other and their rice cakes were soggy - not chewy textured at all.  I've had better so skip and order up other entrees.\n\nServers were hustling and bustling - our waiter came out with the wrong order as well as forgetting to bring me my vinegar when I asked for it.

Good food but can't compensate for the worst, demeaning and somewhat racist service of my life. When my family and I walked in, my mother wanted to sit at a table in the front because it's dark and dim in the back. The hostess rolled her eyes and sighed three separate times when my mother requested another table because it troubled her to take an extra minute to explain that she needed the two front tables for larger parties later on. Funny thing is she sat two people at each of those two front tables later on and not any larger parties. After being seated by the rude hostess, our waiter came by and started yelling at my American boyfriend because my boyfriend accidentally poured the tea before it was fully infused and ready. He then rudely assumed and spoke out, \"You must be Dutch.\" to my boyfriend, basing off of his blonde hair and skin color, as to insult my boyfriend for not knowing Asian customs or how to correctly pour tea because he's Caucasian. The waiter and hostess were both so eager to make everything go faster that they didn't care about what the customers wanted.

She has a hard time finding a good place that just for her liking.  This place has spiced up her life and I think it will spicy up yours as well.   This looks like your typical Chinese restaurant but their menu is truly a szechuan place.   \n\nThis place does get crowded but if you get here early enough you can get a table.  I've ordered a few items here before so allow me to break it down for you\n\nBeef Pancake- i guess i didn't like this dish because i didn't like the way the beef was prepared.  The beef is sliced up and rolled up into the dough.  I was hoping the beef was going to be minced.  \n\nString Beans- there is no way anyone can mess up this dish and they didn't.  It came with chili peppers and it made it super tasty\n\nSpicy wontons- I didn't quite like this dish, i didn't like the ingredients that was inside.  This however, was a very spicy dish, so if you want that extra kick you should order this dish.  \n\nCouple's Delight - this was a cold dish, i believe it was spicy tendon,  It's pretty good and it's best to eat this with rice\n\nFish Filet with Flaming Chili Oil- This is a dish there the fish filet is in a soup of chili oil, so start fishing! This dish may look very spicy, but it wasn't extreme.  You can tell them to make it mild if you want.  Again another good dish to be served with white rice. \n\nPrawns with Salty Egg Yolk- this was by far my most favorite dish,  The prawns are in this light battered and this dish comes with fried corn kernels.  Yes each kernel was covered with batter, it was so good.  I doubt you can get this just by itself, but the next time i go i will try to just order that.  \n\nThe service here is also pretty good and parking is usually never a  problem after 6.   I tried to place an order on my phone but I think their site is not mobile friendly, so i made my order over the phone.

The lunch menu prices are extremely reasonable ($7 includes the entree, rice, and the soup, pseudo-kimchee, and tea).  I was able to try two options - the mapo tofu and the eggplant with garlic sauce.  \n\nThe mapo tofu was very good, but not any better than what I make at home or any decent Chinese place.  It was flavored well, the sauce was the right thickness and not too salty.  The tofu quality was average and tasted like it was from Safeway.  But overall the dish was everything you can ask for.  \n\nThe eggplant with garlic sauce caught me off-guard as I was expecting eggplant stir-fried with sauce, not eggplant cutlets that were fully battered and deep fried.  It tasted great and the garlic sauce with sliced carrots and bamboo shoots was also very tasty.  But I wasn't really in the mood for the deep fried eggplant and the abundance of oil that I tasted in each bite.\n\nI will definitely come back here again to try some other dishes.

Mouth numbing Sichuan peppers check, mounds of red chili peppers check, but the taste?  The only way I can describe it is it had a very home-cooked feeling and taste.  Like a friend's mom might make. Although the taste was alright. The chicken flavor lacked depth, maybe because they seemed to use a lot of white meat and this time on the verge of being under cooked. Not the darker color and richer flavors of somewhere like Z&Y restaurant. The fish dish was also not on point.  It had a slight fishy after taste that made me doubt it's freshness. \n\nBut all that said it still fulfilled my Sichuan craving. Come here for a solid and homey meal.

The skin on the Peking Duck was perfect... the meat was a little on the dry side and needed a little more seasoning. My favorite was the steam sea bass and the Szechuan fish with flaming chili oil. The basil clam was another good seafood dish.\n\nMy best comment is the service was 5 star for my party of 15 for mother's day dinner.", "author": "Kmaintl L."}

It's a different style of Szechuan food than you typically find though my lack of culture only vaguely understands the differences. \n\nIt's spacious, and we've thrown larger parties here before with set courses and a lot of bourbon. \n\nBad: The beef rolls. These are one of my favorite, comfort dishes and they flat out suck here. Go to Dong Bei Mama for them. \n\nDecent: Minced pork wraps, sliced pork and garlic, spicy wontons. \n\nAbsolutely must get: Dan dan mien. The main reason I keep coming back here is for this dish. It's hands down the best version of these noodles I've ever had and something I've introduced many friends to. \nAnother favorite is the pumpkin soup served in a coconut shell. It was hot and savory and comforting and we absolutely did not pour some bourbon in there. \n\n\nOverall I would have given Chili house 3 stars as a standard place to eat if you're in the area, but their Dan Dan Mien really is that good and I crave it every rainy now and then.", "author": "Jonathan Y."}

There were large families at three round tables, mostly two tops and some singles. I was very excited to try this place because Peking Duck is one of my fave dishes and I've had take out at their sister restaurant, Z&Y many times and love their food. We ordered the Hot & Sour Soup, Szechuan Cold Noodles, Silky Tofu with Fish in Chili Oil and Peking Duck. We did not call ahead for the duck but we lucked out and they were able to make it for us. We gladly waited the 45 minutes and it did not disappoint. The duck was juicy and delicately carved tableside like we had experienced in Beijing. Since it is a northern tradition to eat it without the bun, they served it with pancakes, cucumbers and green onions. I couldn't believe how thin and soft the pancakes were and they peeled easily and didn't get punctured. They have some master making them in the kitchen. The pancakes held up well even after being filled with hoisin sauce, duck and the garnishments. It was definitely tasty Peking Duck. Based on the inflection of our server's tone when she asked if we wanted a small or medium sized soup, we went with the medium and it turned out to be huge. We did finish the whole thing by the end of the night. The Hot & Sour Soup had good flavors melded together and the right consistency, not too thick or thin with the eggs scrambled correctly and the perfect brown color, all factors that one should judge it on. Steve and I love spicy food and my friend likes it a little but it can make him sick. I could sense his anticipation as the red goodness reached the table. As he took a few bites of the Fish & Tofu, he commented that it was good, with a numbing effect and didn't burn his stomach so we had a winning dish! The Cold Noodles were delish, just like at Z&Y. The menu here has more to offer than their sister restaurant. We'll be back with a bigger crowd because a whole duck to ourselves was overwhelming and I want to try now things. On this first visit, we did order the right amount of food choices. We polished it off except for all the duck and bones. I should mention you can have the duck bones cooked in soup or fried. We went with fried and they sprinkled the special salt & pepper seasoning on it. It was very good as well. Oh and the service is good. They were friendly and attentive. They refilled water and actually checked on us which is hard to come by at most Chinese restaurants.", "author": "Jen L."}

The waiter semi made up for it with great service, but what happened before I sat down left a really bitter taste. Never have I ever been more appalled at the severe lack of professionalism at a restaurant. I also completely understand that Chinese restaurants are not known for their service, but this level of disregard and disrespect has never happened to me.\n\nAs I stepped in, there were about 2 parties ahead of us. We wrote our name down. I looked around, and there were a bounty of empty tables with the restaurant (think a half empty restaurant). I definitely do not mind waiting for a table, but the fact that my bf and I sat there for ~30 minutes with no one coming to explain that either 1) the tables were reserved and the parties are coming soon or 2) ???. I don't even know what a second scenario would be. Fine. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt that there was a huge party occupying half the restaurant soon. Then, a group of 4 Caucasian people came in and wrote their names down. Very soon after, a waiter goes over and asks how many people they have. After around another 10 minutes, they sit the 4 people down when there were clearly 2 parties of 2 (us and another couple) who came here WELL before they did. When I asked why they seated the 4 people ahead of us and showed him our names on the paper, he completely ignored me and didn't even look me in the eye and apologize! I really really dislike playing race cards but what made him magically IGNORE the sign-up board in front of him and just seat them ahead of us? Instead, he walked away hastily pretending nothing happened. I'm not sure why this man decided to seat 4 people over us when we were waiting for a good 40 minutes in a half empty restaurant (remember that I gave them a huge benefit of the doubt that there was a banquet coming in which is why they didn't want to occupy that half of the restaurant). \n\nThankfully, a more sensible worker saw what happened, (who eventually was my waiter) apologized and asked if we wanted to be seated. He offered us free drinks and honored the Yelp Check-In deal. The actual food we ordered was good. The chili was on point, but there was a lack of flavor depth. I would've probably given 3 stars for solely the food.\n\nI still must give this place a 1 star because it was easily in one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant. If you totally oversaw us for 40 minutes, fine. But the worker who decided to completely ignore us was completely unprofessional and unapologetic. If any managers of Chili House are reading this, I suggest you create a better system / process for those waiting for a table.", "author": "Claudia C."}

All in all, food was great and I'd order again, but my only regret was eating too much too quickly, and not having enough veggies in my selection of dishes.

I had to spit some of the pieces of mince pork in a tissue because it had hard \"stuff\". \n \nthen the explosive fried chicken came. it was not spicy enough for me to be called explosive. my friend and I both agreed that they didn't give u much chicken, it was mostly covered with dried red chilies. and when u ate the chicken, it wasn't crispy like it should. and some of the chicken were so fatty. I had to spit that out. \n\npumpkin and battered prawns came next. I thought these were toooooo pricey . you get about 6 or7 prawns with one order and I believe they were 15 bucks or more. they did not use fresh garlic to season the so called \"battered prawns with garlic\" instead they used cheap fried garlic in a jar from the Asian market and put lots of that on top of the prawns. it was too salty. \n\nat least 30 min later my friend and I were still waiting for the steam rice. the food was too salty that we needed steam rice to be able to at least enjoy it better. \n\ndid I say, that it was really difficult to get a waiter's attention here? they were pretty well packed with waiters id say 5 or 6, however they never came to our table to ask if we needed anything or asked if things were ok. we asked for water in the beginning and it wasn't delivered.\n\nafter finally trying to catch a waiters attention for 20 min, we asked about our steam rice. the lady waiter said she will check on it. \n\n10 min later a different waiter, male, came to our table to tel us that there is no steam rice ready. and that it will take a long time. and he suggested to cancel our steam rice order. \n\nin total shock and disbelief I didn't know what to say or ask. lots of things run in my mind. how could a Chinese restaurant run out of rice? steam rice???? oh come on this is a must and is a staple for Asian food!!! how the hell do you run out of steam rice!!!!! \n\nmy friend and I were pretty upset. they could have told us this in the very beginning that they ran out of steam rice and it will take a while to cook. obviously nobody was paying attention in the back if they had enough rice or not. also, as soon as they found out they should have told us, but NO!! we had to find out ourselves!!! so how the hell are we supposed to eat all these salty spicy foods without rice???! are you kidding me? \n\nmy friend and I quickly packed out foods to go, and left that restaurant. and this is the first time I never gave tip in my entire life.

The two young ladies watching the line were not very friendly but it may be a language problem, they being Chinese from China and we being two old white men from SF.  I have to say they were busy clearing tables when not working the waiting line.

I have eaten in Chinese restaurants all around the world for 63 years and a pretty good judge of food and service\nThe food we had was good but not the best although they did their best to serve us and the service was very good considering a full house.  Our Xiao lum bao was as good as Shanghai, dry fried string beans good, yao choi with garlic was good.  The main courses so so.  we had spicy pork with dumplings was good but not spicy.  It was Shanghai braised pork shoulder that was sliced and piled in the center of the plate with the brown skin piled on top of the meat and a ring of dumplings and broccoli florets laid around the meat.  It looked very good but was not spicy at all.  I asked for Szechuan prawns but not on the menu so my waiter told me she would have the chef make me something similar.  It was spicy and good kinda like kung pao chicken. Last but not least the hot sour soup.  One of my favorites.  The soup was very typical but not enough white pepper or vinegar. I did tell the waiter to tell the chef although I hate to tell the chef how to cook less he come after me with a meat clever. I took the leftovers home and spiced it up.  And talk about leftovers, the portions they serve you are large and you do get your money's worth. \nAll in all we did pretty good and will come back again with a few more people so we can enjoy the duck.

This is much better than the rating I'd give for most other Chinese restaurants: F. \n\nI enjoyed this meal a lot and definitely want to come back soon to try all the other spicy dishes on the menu.  Since I'm not used to eating this amount of spice normally, I paid for this meal dearly with numerous bathroom trips later that evening and into the next day.  This, of course, is my own fault, and I think it can only be corrected by eating more spices more often.  And I believe Chili House will help me do just that.", "author": "Vivian C."}

So I'm glad that this place is bigger and the food is good too!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n+ Rice Cakes - it's not spicy but it's DELICIOUS. It has a sort of sweet taste to it, not because there's any sugar but it was probably the lettuce that was cooked with it. I liked it a lot! The rice cakes are chewy and good. I asked for a little bit of hot sauce on the side so I could dip my rice cakes in.\n+ Stuffed onion pancake - this was an interesting one because it was stuffed with meat on the inside. I liked it though because it was really hot and crispy. Yum!\n+ Red Oil Chili Wontons - No good. I was hoping that it would taste like the red oil chili wontons at Sichuan Home but I guess I'll just have to go back to that place to get them. \n\nA lot of people were getting the noodle soups so I assume that those are either really good or just really worth it.

I wouldn't say this is the spiciest Szechuan place I've ever been to, in fact I think it's a little toned down. But for the average American it's probably still considered spicy.\n\nNon-food-wise:\n --- Parking around this area is generally easy. Paid meters everywhere. \n --- I usually come slightly off the peak dinner hour and never had to wait. There is ample seating from 2-table seats to traditional large round tables.\n --- Service is speedy and good\n\nThey are a little on the pricey side, but I think they use better quality ingredients and produce. At least I feel like all their food is a tad more \"refined\".\n\nFood-wise:\n\nCouple's Delight (\u592b\u59bb\u80ba\u7247), $7.95 --- Cold marinated slices of lung and I think tendon. One of the best appetizers you can get. The marinade is spicy with the right blend of soy-sauce-ish salty sweet. Highly recommended.\n\nWonton with Spicy Peanut Sauce (\u7d05\u6cb9\u6284\u624b) $5.95 --- another recommended appetizer. The sauce is what's important (should be spicy & salty with a tad sweetness), and I think they do it very well\n\nMa Po Tofu w/ Pork (\u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150\uff09$9.50 --- If there were a textbook example of Ma Po Tofu, this would be it! The balance between chunked soft tofu, minced pork, and chili sauce is excellent.\n\nHome-Made Soy Bean Milk \uff08\u8c46\u6f3f\uff09$1.50 --- A surprising delight. It's rare to see Szechuan restaurants carry house-made fresh soy milk. Much better than the store brands. I like to get it warm with no sugar.\n\nSteamed Chinese Cabbage with Garlic (\u849c\u84c9\u84b8\u97f6\u83dc\uff09$10.95 --- My least favorite dish out of everything I've order here. I don't dislike the cabbage but the broth they pour on it combined some kind of green onion slices they put on it just made it very unappetizing to me. It had some kind of onion-y smell that wasn't the kind of onion-y smell I liked :( On the other hand, my husband thought it was fine, so it's probably a very personal preference.\n\nXinjiang Style Gill Lamp Chops \uff08\u65b0\u7586\u70e4\u7f8a\u6392\uff09 $13.95 --- lightly salted and peppered grilled lamb chops. By the way, Xinjiang province is very far from Szechuang (I think of the silk road when ppl say Xinjiang) so not sure how this ended up here but it definitely has got that Middle Eastern touch to it. Yummy!\n\n\nStir Fried Chicken with Pickled Chili Pepper (\u5c0f\u7c73\u6912\u7231\u4e0a\u5c0f\u516c\u96de) $9.95 --- I liked this less.

The service was pretty bad too. We waited several minutes in \"I'm ready to order stance,\" menus closed, stacked, and placed on the edge of the table, eagerly looking up for a waiter even though there were several waitstaff standing around. We also had issues with getting water and our order of rice. They had to be reminded several times to bring these things to our table. This is the kind of place where you have to flag people down for everything. You could even hear the bell being fervently rung from the kitchen, calling a wait person over to bring out a boiling soup that had to be served hot. \n\nAnyway, the food:\n\nExploding Chili Chicken: the chicken tastes fine. It's nothing spectacular and has a distinct flavor from all the spices. I kind of think all the chili peppers are a bit of a gimmick because to season a dish there's no way you need that many, but I'm no expert on this. \n\nSteamed Napa Cabbage: This was really just an okay dish. I wanted a vegetable dish, but I've tried stir fried green beans so many places and felt in the mood for something different. The serving size is insanely large and it essentially was what you would expect.\n\nTan Tan Noodles: the flavor profile of this was good, but it's a bit freaky how much oil there is.  I know that's just the style of the dish, but freaky nonetheless. The texture of the noodles weren't great.

The food was so bland that we had to ask for hot pepper sauce to go with it.  The chicken curry has nothing to do with any kind of a curry you've ever had before but more like chicken with white sauce and some vegetables.  It was marked with a red chili pepper signifying a very hot dish which it was not. The  scallion pancakes were not crispy .   Again, the clams in a clay pot  were  so  bland that I had to ask for some Hot Chili Peppers sauce to add some nterest to the dish.  Service was acceptable,  if not welcoming. The restaurant was very busy and we did not get utensils with our dish.

I came in on a Wednesday night, and the place was about empty, which was nice, albeit unfortunate for the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered the house noodles, beef pancakes, string beans, and numbing beef. The noodles were garnished with a great sauce, and were the perfect consistency. I also love cucumber, so having that on their was a plus. The beef pancakes were awesome, too. The string beans were fine. Good flavor, but nothing to write home about. Granted, this isn't the fault of the restaurant; string beans don't have a ton of potential. The beef was the only thing we didn't like, but that was more due to how it was presented than to the actual quality of the dish. It simply wasn't what we were expecting. We used the sauce from the beef on the veggies and noodles, however, and that definitely added a kick. \n\nThe service was great, although we were the only ones in the place, so it wasn't a surprise. Food was out almost immediately, which was great. \n\nI will definitely come back with a better understanding of the menu, as that was pretty much the only thing that kept this from being a five star experience.", "author": "Zander N."}

SF has no shortage of Chinese restaurants, but they all serve up saccharine Americanized Cantonese food.  (Note: If Mongolian Beef or Beef & Broccoli are on the menu it's not legit) .\n\nWhen we finally found Chili House we were in heaven.  The atmosphere was just like being back in China and the menu had exactly what I wanted.  Even the smell of the restaurant and the bright fluorescent lights were spot on.\n\nThey had my absolute favorite dish of all time which is a pork dish that I don't exactly know the English name, but if you order YanJianRou you can't miss.  The flavor was spot on, but strangely the pork was very soft and doesn't have the sensation of eating meat.  I seriously considered bringing in my own pork and begging/bribing them to  make it for me.\n\nThe Beef (or Fish) in Chili Oil is very good, I prefer the fish as the beef had a similar issue as the pork.\n\nRecently we have been getting very poor service.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced, although they are basically just smaller versions of the regular dishes.  We went for lunch and, after hunting down parking, I was getting close to the end of lunch time.  They shut down the whole kitchen at 3PM, not just the lunch specials so they rushed my fiance who was in earlier. They asked at her at least 5 times within 3 minutes to order although we were obviously trying to hurry.\n\nI went here a couple nights ago and the taste of the food was also quite good, although the meat is still super soft and a little strange - not like it would be in the real dish in China.\n\nSo... long-ish review, but this is a fantastic place and perhaps the only one in SF with decent Chinese food.  Now if they can just stop being rude (even by Chinese standards) and get their meat right I will be there on the daily.", "author": "Brian L."}

The frog itself has a weird taste which I cannot describe but not good at all.

It was heavily peppered, which was fine for me, because I always toss in a ton of pepper anyway. However, this soup was HEAVILY peppered. My sister kept coughing because she was completely overwhelmed by it. \n\nWe ordered lemon chicken, which I really thought would come out like normal lemon chicken but nope... you know orange chicken? well it's like that but with the hint of lemon. It was definitely not what i was expecting at all. Fried. \n\nWe also ordered the explosive chicken, which I've had at Mission Chinese Food. Mission Chinese Food wins hands down. Their chicken was actual chicken wings whereas this restaurant had pieces of chicken and the flavor wasn't better than Mission Chinese. Fried.\n \nWe got some \"Gill Lame Chops with crispy garlic\" aka Grilled Lamb Chops with crispy garlic. When they say \"grilled\" you think grilled, but then tell me why they were lightly coated and lightly fried? Ugh... but this dish was pretty good.

There was way more than enough chili oil in the bowl to soak the dumplings completely, although I'm not sure why, seems like a waste of chili oil. I'm not going to drink it, nor did it have much flavor to enhance the dumplings.\n\nMaybe these two apps were just misses, so I ordered a third dish, the Twice Cooked Pork, knowing full well I'd be taking home leftovers... because I really wanted to like this place, and wanted to have a reason (a true knockout dish, really) to come back...\n\nThe Twice Cooked Pork failed. Honestly, there was too much fat in the dish. Solid fat strips and overall fat content easily easily outnumbered actual pork meat two-to-one.

I chose their shui zhu yu-- a legendary Sichuan-style boiled fish dish. This comes in two sizes, dinner and lunch. I opted for the smaler lunch version and it met all expectations. Please: if you are spice averse, stay clear. I love spice, and my first bite still had me in the loo coughing. The dish was served full with tender white fish with loads and loads of traditional dried red chili as well as the famed Sichuan numbing pepper corn. Contrary to popular belief, the Sichuan pepper corn isn't spicy per say, it's numbing, and these did just that. It is a sensation that is all but absent at most \"Szechuan\" places. In addition, and for some reason beyond me, I also ordered the Yunnan rice cake with pork belly. This too was served spicy, but with chopped moist red chilies. The rice cakes were great, but the pork was too salty. Every meal comes with house soup (even if you order soup as a main) and pickled cabbage. I'd love to come back here with a big group and try about 5- or 7 dishes, including the frogs, which they told me they don't kill there (it's done across the street at the seafood butcher place.)

I was excited to try the Z&Y sister restaurant closer to my house (and without a wait!).\n\nThe dining room is a similar size to the Z&Y in Chinatown and the menu offers the same sichuan dishes with additions. They do not have their beer & wine license yet but another table was enjoying wine and beer so I think they are operating as BYOB at the moment.\n\nWe had the explosive chicken, beef pancake, and cucumber and jalapeno salad.  Everything was as spicy as we had hoped and the beef pancake had a sweetness that offset our other spicy dishes. Food quality was what we expected  from visiting Z&Y. I look forward to visiting again and trying more of the dishes I enjoyed at Z&Y.\n\nService was a bit slow for a restaurant that was not even close to capacity but I am sure that will get better once they get a swing of things.", "author": "Leuwam T."}

I went with a couple of friends, one of whom had been through China and knew a thing or two about Sichuan cuisine.\n\nWe are all comfortable with blood and guts, so I was a little surprised by the waitress' attitude. After ordering, she confirmed with my friend that the \"laowai\" would eat the food, and when we asked for small bowls of rice, she told my friend there was no point because the laowai would just dump it on their plates anyway. (I understand enough Mandarin to follow my friend's conversation).\n\nWaitress' attitude notwithstanding, the food was fantastic:\n\nCouple's Delight - There were a few thick chunks of tendon that were hard to chew through, but the taste was fantastic. We all loved it - much better than at Z&Y or SPiCES. 4/5\n\nChicken With Explosive Chili Pepper - I have had this at a lot of Sichuan spots and it never quite meets my expectations. This one had just the right amount of spice and numbing Sichuan peppercorns to hit that perfect \"ma la\" balance. 4/5\n\nHouse Special Fresh Filet Boiled in House Spicy Sauce - It's a Sichuan specialty that I would have loved a bit more if the dish had any kick. The pieces of fish held together really well, but the flavours fell a little flat. 3/5\n\nMao Xue Wang - This was a bit of everything; congealed blood, pork intestine, fish, beef, rice sticks, and more. Just a hodgepodge. Tasted fantastic. 4/5\n\nCumin Lamb - We figured we'd get something a bit less spicy, for some balance, and this certainly wasn't spicy. In fact, it was a bit sweet, which was somewhat disconcerting. The lamb was delicious despite the sweetness - tender, fatty, with a nice kick of cumin. 3.5/5\n\nOverall, I'd give the place a 3.75/5. I'm more impressed with Chili House than I ever was with Z&Y, and I definitely want to go back.", "author": "Harley C."}

Another waitress comes by and takes our appetizer order--steamed pork dumplings and couples delight. Few minutes later the first waiter comes back and asks if we want appetizers....seriously?!  I told him another waiter took our appetizer order so he asks if we are going to order anything else. I start with a dish for my toddler boys, broccoli beef because they can't handle the heat. His response? \"Really?? You come to a Szechuan restaurant and order broccoli beef?\"  Excuse me?  I didn't ask for a commentary on my selection and why have it on the menu if you dislike it so much? I don't need to explain myself or justify my order to you! Also, we were excited about eating here and wanted to try many dishes, however, he kept stopping us and saying we ordered enough food. Are you rationing the food??? If I order too much food, isn't that my problem and a boon for you?\n\nThe interaction made our experience unpleasant and made the food less appealing.  Almost felt like being combative when he asked how the food was.....the food is not spicy....you call this a Szechuan restaurant? But bit my tongue.  Needless to say, hesitant to return.

As someone who has been deprived of good Chinese take-out, I welcome our new spicy neighbors.  One of these is Chili House, on Inner Clement.  The dining area is clean and remodeled with \"interesting\" choices for music.  The service is a bit slow, but the food (at least for what I ordered) was worth the wait.  \n\nFirst visit: Mabo Tofu and Rice to go.  Ordered extra spicy.  It had the burn and the numbing peppers that numbed my tongue.  The tofu was firm so you could it up with chopsticks easily.  Awesome, especially compared to my last visit to Spices (which seems to have gone downhill).  \n\nSecond visit: Kung Pao chicken over rice for lunch.  Bits of chicken were bite sized and the portion was nap inducing (generous).  Ordered spicy and felt the burn come on half way through.  Dish was good.  Ordered an canned iced tea (the kind in the red can).  $2.50!! Check the menu for beverage prices. \n\nSo they can do the basics.  Good.  Next visit means a proper multi-dish dinner.  Exploding chicken perhaps?", "author": "Rodney L."}

This is not your average Take out Chinese place so expect to open your mind and go here to try new things and strange amazing flavors. Although you can get your standard fried rice and walnut prawns there are so many more unique dishes you need to try. And FYI if you are a spice fanatic like myself a lot of my recommendations are SPICY so watch out. They dont mess around. You can always ask for more chili sauce if youre feeling daring.\nAlthough very odd the Cold Beef Tendon appetizer is an experience. I have no idea what the flavors or textures are and this is not a dish for everyone but once I tried it years ago I was sold.\nOf course you have to get the Mapo Tofu and the beef pancake roll appetizer. I dont know all the exact names so hopefully im close.\nThe number one thing you must get is The Explosive Fried Chicken! Comes in a giant platter of hot peppers and it is awesome (dont be convinced to eat several of the peppers like I was...you will regret it)\nThe hot pots are pretty popular as I saw them on several tables around us and the fried fish is good as well.\nGo with an open mind or should i say palette and you wont regret it", "author": "Lilia D."}

The fuqifeipian wasn't bad, but definitely not our favorite -- it was a little too sweet.  The dandan noodles were good but we found the sauce to be a little soupy and again a bit too sweet and not enough sesame paste/nutty flavor. The laziji was disastrous -- boneless chicken that tasted like it had been frozen for weeks and it just didn't have the right taste to it. One thing I was pleasantly surprised by however, was their very liberal use of sichuan peppercorns (mala ftw!). We still prefer Spices (both locations) to Chili House but would go back in a pinch.

Second, the service sucks.\n\nNow before you get up in arms about the racist comment I just made, allow me to clarify. Service here is good if you are accustomed to shouting across the table at a passing waiter. This is the Chinese model for customer service, where common courtesy is dispensed with for the sake of getting to the point. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, it's just a cultural norm. \n\nAlso, I'm Chinese, so it's ok if I say things like that. .\n\n If, on the other hand, you like to wave down servers when they are close to your table, you're going to have a bad time. You can gesticulate, you can politely chirp \"Excuse me\" repeatedly, the waitstaff here will not notice. They are all furiously studying something on their shoes as they weave around the restaurant emptyhanded.\n\nA waitress here, she seems to be the manager as well, is humorless and impatient with the elderly. Now I know that is a very specific criticism, but I happen to be very particular about how service personnel treat my 90 year old grandfather. This woman missed the mark by far. Old people are hard of hearing, so repeat yourself without appearing exasperated. Old people talk slowly, so don't fidget like you are in a hurry, even if you are. \n\nMy grandfather spent some years in Szechuan and says the food is very authentic.

Nothing was bad, but it just didn't have any life either.\n\nResult: much better than most Chinese in this neighborhood and in the city as a whole. Not a standout by Sichuan standards.\n\n---\n\nWhoever took my phone order was light years ahead of the level of service gotten from most Chinese places, though!", "author": "r g."}

It had huge pictures of food in the window so I went over for a closer inspection. I found a menu on the door and thought \"I am going to have to try each and every one of these plates of food, starting with Mo Po which no one has ever been able to make hot enough for my taste. \n\nWhen we first sat down we were served a 'teaser' and I did not recognize what vegetable it was. Potato was the answer. I had always wondered what the Chinese would do with a potato and now I know. How in the world they get it cut so thin is something I want to know the answer to. Lightly steamed and while still crispy a light sauce that truly excites the taste buds, served room temperature. We had another dish that I can not find on the menu chicken marinated in something wonderful covered with a pepper and oil sauce. I have never eaten anything like it and Bruce says we are definetly returning here again. We ordered a sup gum chow mein and another vegetable dish and some steamed rice and tea. Nice sized portions yet very low prices in a clean dinning room with attentive waitpersons. The service was as excellent as was the food. \n\nThe only thing I don't like is they close at 10pm and it can be difficult to get there before then if my meeting runs late. I really want to try their dim sum. I know I will be returning here again and again. Highly recommended", "author": "Alan H."}

My sister from New York insisted on swinging by the restaurant before heading back to Marin to pick up this yumminess. I added spicy dumplings and we were in heaven!! Made some rice at home and that ws a great welcome to the Bay Area dinner!", "author": "Belle C."}
