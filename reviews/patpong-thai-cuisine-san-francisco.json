I was particularly missing Asian food after not having it for a week. We decided to order lunch from Patpong Thai Cuisine on Saturday, September 9th at 12:58pm through Delivery dot com. It arrived at 1:48pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n23. Hot & Sour with Shrimp (Tom Yum): Hot and spicy, With kaffir lime leaves, galangal root, mushrooms, roasted chili paste ($12.95)\n28. Spicy Basil Fried Rice: Hot and spicy, Chicken with crushed chili peppers, onions, tomatoes, bell pepper and Thai basil ($10.50)\n30. Pad Thai: Thin rice noodles stir-fried with Chicken, fried tofu, egg, bean sprouts and green onions with crushed peanuts on the side ($10.50)\n37. Green Curry (Gang Keo Warn) with Chicken: Hot and spicy, With Chinese eggplant, bell pepper, zucchini, green bean and basil ($11.50)\n*Chef's Special Papaya Salad: Prawns, tomatoes, carrots, green beans in chili-lime sauce, no cashew nuts ($11.95)\n*Brown Rice ($2)\n\nWe have our usual Thai spot we order from, but they weren't delivering for lunch, so I just picked this restaurant. Overall, I thought the flavors were too one note. And everything was overly sweet. I wanted more spiciness and fishiness to balance out the papaya salad. The curry had a good amount of heat, but I found it thin. I tend to like a thicker curry. The soup also needed more lemongrass (or something) for contrast. The roommate ordered the other two things and seemed to enjoy them.\n\nKinda wished our usual spot was delivering as I wasn't impressed. Everything just needed more flavor. Especially spice as I noted most things extra spicy. Oh well, at least I tried a new spot!", "author": "Elena N."}

We have found our new lunch delivery spot, after tiring of the general un-flavorliness of Tsing Tao (and also the unfortunate discovery of a hair in my coworker's lunch)....and it is Patpong.  We all ordered chicken pad thai the first time (to accurately judge a thai place, you need to try it, right?) and I thought it was really good.  Good flavor, not greasy, a good amount of crushed peanuts on top, and a generous takeout portion which easily provided me with two meals.\n\nThe next time, we ordered delivery for about 15 people for a lunch talk.  They carefully labeled each dish with the person's name on it, and not a mistake was made...on 15 orders.  Maybe I just have low expectations from delivery, but I was pretty impressed.  And everyone's food arrived, on time, and piping hot.  A+!  Everyone gobbled up their lunches happily, and most had leftovers for the next day.  I ordered the spicy basil chicken which was the right amount of spiciness - not burning my mouth off, but definitely with a kick.\n\nSince that order went so well, we ordered again the same week.  This time I went back to chicken pad thai, again, perfectly satisfying the craving.  My two coworkers (one who is Korean and loves spice) ordered their dishes spicy.  And oh my goodness were they!  We had just taken a few bites when both of them started sweating and needed to get an ice-cold drink from the vending machine.  However, they really liked it.

This is probably because most customers either order over the phone for pickup or delivery due to its convenient location in the Richmond district.\n\nThere are many neighboring restaurants within the vicinity so the options are out there should you decide on something else.  Parking can sometimes be tough since this is one of the busier parts of the Richmond.\n\nThe space is medium-sized but as previously mentioned, seating is never a problem.  The decor is pretty standard for a Thai restaurant with your Buddhist statues and various plants laid out to give it that ethnic and traditional feel.\n\nTheir lunch menu is a perfect quick fix for that Thai craving, such as the crab meat or roasted duck fried rice, or any of the clay pot dishes.  The pad thai and the pad see ew are also pretty good.\n\nOne of my favorite main entrees is the herbal red snapper which is sauteed in special herb sauce, bamboo shoots, baby corn, bell peppers, eggplant, green beans, zucchini, and Thai basil on a sizzling plate.", "author": "Tony L."}

The first time I ordered fried chicken over garlic fried rice - fried chicken was soggy and the fried rice tasted too plain. Second time I had the pad thai: it was way too tangy with too many noodles and not enough veggies and meat.\n\nOn top of that, I checked in on Yelp right after I ordered during my second visit and was granted an offer for a free Thai iced tea, yet they refused to honor the coupon. So they made me pay for the Thai iced tea I drank during my meal, and gave me another iced tea to in a plastic to-go cup. What the f***, how hard is it to enter your computer system and delete a drink off the tab?\n\nAfter reading through other reviews on Yelp, it seems like the general idea is that Patpong refuses to take an extra step to establish a clientele. Its a disappointment cause I want to like this place, I really do - its clean, the food is marginally acceptable, and its within walking distance of my home, but they have no loyalty and their food isn't good enough to overlook that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-22", "description": "I love to come into the Richmond District at night as the thinning professional crowd coincides with the thickening waves of rolling fog coming from the ocean. Without much foot traffic, it gets particularly chilly walking in this neighborhood while others flock toward the Inner Richmond or other parts of San Francisco for a warmer cozy dinner. As a wealth seeker in the most unlikely places, I often go in the opposite direction from the places that bring in a crowd. This and an advice from my good friend B.B brought me here for an evening of Thai cuisine. There is nothing more comforting than to walk in and out of the cold with a warm ambiance and spicy food waiting to indulge my curious mind and empty stomach.\n\nThe restaurant was gorgeous. It had all the characteristics such as dim lighting, dark wooden floors, sleek tables, and nice dining sets with warm candle light to induce an exquisite intimate atmosphere. It reminded me of Wuong Luang Thai of Concord where everything in the backdrop had an aesthetic purpose. Sometimes I feel apprehensive about going into such a nice restaurant by myself but since there were only a few people it was easy for me to swoop in without causing an odd spectacle.\n\nContrary to what I might have expected from such a fancy restaurant where a table for one could render one's invisibility in the eyes of the servers, the two people who were there actually gave me a strong sense of belonging as they were highly attentive, warm, and knowledgeable. I was initially disappointed when they ran out of fried taro appetizer but instead my orders of fresh rolls ($6.95) and poh turn ($12.95) were a pleasant surprise. My pair of fresh rolls came with a mixture of cucumbers, bean sprouts, tofu, eggs, and mushrooms wrapped in fresh egg roll skin topped with tamarind sauce with a dab of real crab meat. With the wrappers served warm and fluffy, the taste of sprouts, mushrooms, and eggs really stood out while still submissive to the tamarind's sweet and savory accent. For the price I thought the crab meat was rather decorative and could be more elaborative and integral to the overall experience.\n\nWhile some restaurants hold back on its authenticity by succumbing to the mainstream palate, my poh turn arrived just the way I liked it: Spicy bodacious and yelpalicious. With strong lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, galangale root, and chili peppers anchoring a good mixture of prawns, scallops, fish, calamari and mussels, this dish sizzled. While portions were small, this dish grappled with my imagination with its sharp, spicy, and sour flavors that was jaw dropping delicious. I loved to eat my Thai food with sticky rice ($2) and thought it was a decent complement to such a flavorful dish. \n\nTo further add to the experience, my cup of water was never empty and they were very attentive by making warm eye contacts with one arm folded to the back as a part of being great hostesses. They also surprised me in the end with a free pumpkin dessert with warm coconut milk to give my dinner the appropriate finish. In the end when I asked for a take out menu, instead of pointing to the stack at the door, the server went out of his way to bring me a copy. In terms of good customer service, this was one form of personalization that will keep bringing me back. \n\nBesides these strong attributes, I thought their prices could be lowered and portions could be more generous. Otherwise, this place deserves a very strong 4 stars for its wonderful unyielding flavors and unparalleled dining experience. I promised B.B. that I would come back for their spicy crispy chicken wings and hopefully by then they will also have the taro appetizers too.", "author": "Daniel L."}

But heck, Patpong is closer to our Outer Richmond address so I figured I'd send some business their way.\n\nOrdering was easy, they have their menu online and the descriptions are clear. Phone order was good so no problems there. Delivery was free so even better. I ordered 5 dishes - spring rolls, tom yum soup, Thai style fried rice with chicken, spicy basil duck and prawns with spring peas. A decent selection from the menu right? Well, when we got the food, it was a big disappointment. Who said the portions are huge? They must not have been talking about the delivery servings. For the price, since we got these puny portions, I thought maybe the quality and taste is worth it. WRONG. Nothing made my tastebuds go \"YUM\". Even the Tom Yum soup didn't do that and it has YUM in the name! King of Thai Noodle's Tom Yum soup has a lot more goodies in the soup like lemongrass and huge pieces of ginger so you know its real. Patpong's version made me wonder if it was yesterday's left overs.\n\nPatpong, we gave you a chance and you didn't deliver.

There are dishes with chicken, seafood, beef, and vegetables, and they had Pad Thai, other noodles, and about 4 different types of fried rice, including Pineapple Fried Rice.\n\nTheir Pad See Ew ($7.50) was delicious; just the right amount of sweetness, and the noodles were tender and didn't stick together.  The portion is just enough - usually I have a hard time finishing the dish at other Thai restaurants, but this was perfect for me.  I wish the chicken wasn't in such large chunks, because they took away my knife I think when they brought me the dish, and so I couldn't cut up the chicken.\n\nHalf star off for the waitstaff having family members around and therefore not really paying attention to us (no one came by to see if we needed anything).  They gave us some sticky rice with custard dessert on the house, and that was really delicious as well.\n\nOverall 4.5 stars; definitely someplace I'd return to if I'm in the area.", "author": "Tori S."}

Then we figured perhaps it was just too far away from the action and would be, as described by a local we met at the nearby Tee Off Bar, exceptional Thai food.\n\nAlas, it wasn't. The place smelled a bit dank and there were flies (at first just one, but then the lonely guy was joined by two family members, or were they just friends?) buzzing around our heads. At first it was amusing - trying to catch them in our hands. But then the novelty wore off and we realized it's just plain gross.\n\nThankfully we only ordered the onion pancakes (greasy as we'd predicted). At least their Singha beer was delicious and cold but the coup de grace was when one of the flies pulled a kamikaze dive bomb into my half-full (I'm an optimist) beer. That's actually the first time that's ever happened to me inside a restaurant and I didn't quite know how to react.\n\nI just felt sad. We left and went to a Japanese place down the street which also had a few flies but otherwise was quite good.\n\nI hope these guys get it together - these are little problems that can be solved and I believe their food might be quite good.", "author": "Mike B."}

What we hadn't anticipated was that the portions were going to be large... especially the rice, which turned out to be a regular tub of it. Not only are the portions big, though, but they are also inexpensive and good.  That's a winning combo. The only downside is that the kitchen is nearly out in the open (hardly covered at all) and can get a little distracting with chatter during a meal, but that's a real small complaint.\n\nAll in all, this place was probably one of the better Thai restaurants we have been to.

Last year, my office ordered Patpong for our holiday party. Patpong is conveniently located new our office in the outer Richmond, so we thought it was the perfect fit. Placing the order with the restaurant was quite simple, but actually getting our food was another story. We ordered about $300 worth of food for a party of 20 to be delivered at noon. Not a huge order, but substantial enough that I thought it would be given proper attention. I called in the morning to verify the order and the noon delivery time and was told everything would be delivered on time. Noon rolls by and no food. I wait another 15 minutes and no food, so I decide to call. The owner tells me that driver is out for delivery and should arrive any second and sorry for the delay. So we wait.....party begins at 12:30pm, but still no food. So I call the owner again, he explains the driver can't find the building....my response was, \"Really? The driver can't find the main entrance to the VA hospital?\" In response, I got a bunch of excuses. So I hang up and wait. Another 15 minutes rolls by and still no food. I call the owner again and ask him to call his driver. (At this time, I am beginning to become agitated). He says, \"Oh I tried, but the driver dropped his phone in his car and can't find it.\" I respond that how could he possibly know this if he hasn't been able to reach him. Silence on the other end. I get a bunch more excuses and finally I say to him, \"I am not hanging up until the food arrives.\" So we sit on the phone for 10 minutes in silence. Finally, I see the driver's car and have a fellow colleague run out and grab him. To my shock the driver steps out of the car in his pajamas with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a half-dressed girl in the front seat. The driver doesn't even offer to help bring the food into the building and just sets it on the trunk of his car and waits until we make multiple trips to bring it in. Sadly, he also delivered our curry in the pot it was cooked in, no plastic serving bowl that we were promised and paid for. \n\nI must say, Patpong is the worst delivery in San Francisco. Their blatant disregard for customers and ability to lie is deplorable. I will never order from Patpong again, nor would I recommend it to anyone who wants their food actually delivered. The food is average anyway, so you aren't really missing anything. Try Another Monkey in the Mission, if you want good quality Thai in San Francisco.", "author": "Alice S."}

Having stayed in the city for 3 nights, we still hadn't eaten any Thai cuisine, so we decided to eat at the tiniest Thai place we could find, something that looked family owned. We found Patpong Thai.\n\nThe decor is nice, the server was friendly, and the food came out pretty quickly.\n\nThe lunch specials are a great price! You get soup, a little salad, an appetizer, and your entree with rice for about $7-9.\n\nI got the vegetable red curry with the fried wonton appetizer.\nThe soup was okay, but I've never had Thai soup, so I have nothing to compare it to. The fried wontons were pretty good, as was the dipping sauce. The peanut salad dressing was deliscious (though it cracks me up how the unhealthy dressing totally cancels out the very little nutrition that is in that type of \"salad\"). The red curry was very good (though I prefer it a little spicier; I guess I should have asked for green?), and the rice was the perfect texture.\n\nMy boyfriend got the chicken? pad thai. I don't like noodles/pasta in general, but I could have stolen a heck of a lot more bites from him, than I did. It was REEEALLLY good. Again, I didn't have any former experience of pad thai to compare it to, but I don't like noodles and these were fantastic! Perfect amount of cabbage and carrots and crunchy peanuts and all that good stuff. He seemed pretty pleased as well, but we were both exhausted from our trip and our 2 mile hilly trek from my car (not to the restaurant, but earlier in the day), so he didn't say too much. \n\nThe exhaustion brought him to order a Thai iced coffee.

I went with the lunch combo- 1 appetizer, one entree, and soup and salad for $7.95.  Sounds like a great deal, but needless to say everything was tiny.  The food was just no good.  It wasn't horribly offensive, but I probably could have made it better.\n\nWhat really turned me off though, was the server.  He was wearing converse, which he wore more like clogs so he could slip his feet in and out in a hurry I suppose.  He scuffed and dragged his feet all around the dining room.  He also wore his hair in a dramatic bob, which was constantly in his face.  There were too many little service problems for me to list them all, but the icing on the cake was when he put the check down, went to drop off another check, and then came back immediately to pick up the check.  I was still eating!  I just looked at him and said I wasn't done yet, and he scuffed off.\n\nWith Bai Som a few blocks away, I won't be back.", "author": "Theresa H."}

For the entrees, my favorites are veggie Pad Thai, Spicy Basil Chicken and the Panang Curry.\n\nI have a soft spot for their Panang Curry.  I have tried that dish at half a dozen different Thai restaurants and Patpong always does it the best.  I consider myself a meat eater, but I will order the Panang Curry vegetarian as a good change of pace for my palate.  It is a great treat.\n\nI am a big fan of Patpong.

The dreary day out today made me want the yummy goodness that is my comfort food aka Thai.  Ben got the yellow curry, extra spicy with chicken and I stuck with old faithful, the pad see ew with shrimp.  The curry apparently was seasoned with dried chili flakes rather than chili oil, which was different but good.  It was almost like the aroma of the sauce was where you picked up the spiciness, so that when you inhaled you tasted the spicy, rather than instantly when you put the food on your tongue.  The sauce on the pad see ew was really, really rich, sweet and kind of syrup-y.  Ben really liked it, said it's probably his favorite pad see ew of all the Thai places we've tried.  I liked it, but I'm not running out the door to print a t-shirt telling the world how great it was.  Portions were perfect, not huge but not too small either.  \n\nThis place is pretty small inside and unfortunately due to the fact that it has wood floors, wood on the walls and basically seems like it's trying to break some record for acoustics inside a restaurant, we had to listen to the girls across the room talk about their myspace drama.  Oh dear, the world will surely end if Johnny doesn't friend request Suzie.  Other than that the decor was nice, there was soft music playing the background and it had a generally calm, relaxed feel.  Service was good, although like with many other Thai places I've been to, my food and his rice came out about 3-5 minutes before his curry came out.

I decided to just eat it instead of make a complaint.  Then, when I was about halfway through the dish, I feel...something in my mouth.  I spit it out and it is a piece of eggshell. Gross!  I forked through the dish some more and discovered another HUGE cracked up piece of eggshell. It was like 1/4 of the shell, and I wonder how the hell someone could miss this?\n\nSo I called this bumbling waiter over and pointed it out to him, and all the while I'm talking he has this huge grin on his face.

I was mostly dropping cash here because I earn united miles and sometimes I'm a lazy ass and don't want to trek all the way down to Bai Som or up the street to the no longer there King of Thai. That was until they served me the most heinous tofu pad see ew ever created on the planet. Pad see ew happens to be one of my favorite things to eat and I don't think I've ever put something in my mouth that was this awful. Rancid tofu and funky veggies are not a good combo!\n\nIt's not a destination spot, there isn't anything really special about it but if you're really lazy it isn't that bad.

Not even mediocre food, just bad. \n\nWe used to order from here a lot because my boyfriend likes the seafood curry dish even though I always thought the pad thai (my litmus test for Thai places) was just OK and skimpy on the shrimp. This time, though, when we ordered we realized that they raised their prices. \n\nYou would think that the portion sizes would at least stay the same. The pad see ewe was so skimpy I am still hungry!! I used to get at least 2 meals out of the pad thai and pad see ewe dishes, but now I'm still hugry after eating the whole thing. To ice the cake, it wasn't even good! Pad see ewe should be sweet, this was just salty. And the beef was so grissly I had to spit it out. \n\nTo top it all off, the thai tea that my boyfriend ordered arrived on its side, leaking all over the bag it was wrapped in. And no straw. \n\nWhen I called them to tell them that I was dissapointed in their shrinking portions, the chick on the phone almost seemed bored. All she could say was, \"sorry about that\". Gee, thanks (for nothing!).\n\nAfter travelling through Thailand I am familiar with good and not so good Thai food.

Unless I am there and they only have enough for one order left.  Then you will let me have them.  I'm not kidding.  Being a mini-chick, I already have a high appreciation for all things mini, but these really are amazing.  Perfectly seasoned, nearly bite-sized and accompanied by a refreshing cucumber salad.  The sweet potato app and the samosas are also pretty good, but not at the same level and can slightly suffer the fate of mush if you get them \"to go\".\n\nMy favorite dish here is the prawns with ginger chili paste.  It's weird because I have had this same dish at other restaurants and enjoyed it but it is prepared differently here and it really stands out.  Something about the the sweet/spicy combo that is just right.  \n\nWhat's especially nice about this place is that the ambiance is really quiet, softly lit with candles and gently scented by the jasmine oil that is heated in the back of the restaurant.  Even when it is crowded, the noise level is low which makes for a nice, casual, neighborhood restaurant date vibe.  Even the servers are attentive, but quiet and non-intrusive.  In other words, they are there when you need them but don't hover.  \n\nStreet parking can be challenging, but there is a lot just down the street if you get frustrated.  I usually end up circling 2-3 times and finding a spot without a problem.", "author": "Trina C."}

The place we chose.......CLOSED by the liqueur control board! DAMN!! \nSo we start walking down the street to window shop for a new place and we come across this cute little Thai place and I grab my Iphone to check out the Yelp review - IT'S GOOD!  We decide to give it a go.\nFirst of all, the chairs did NOT look comfortable, but they were. The Prices were PERFECT. And we both dive right into the menu - there were a TON of choices. We order 2 Singha while we read the menu thoroughly. The beer come out with two chilled mugs - EXTRA POINTS there!\nFirst course - an order of fried spring rolls and some crispy chicken wontons. The plate presentation was beautiful and the taste was delish. A perfect portion for each of us and enough of the sweet sauce to coat it all in. This place was surely a 5 star Yelp in my book. \nHere's where it all went wrong - \nI get up to use the restroom and wash my hands of the sticky appetizer sauce. The bathroom was DISGUSTING!! Only one toilet for the whole place (that's fine) and it looked like a hobo threw up in there. Cleaning supplies strewn all over the floor (USE THEM!, don't just display them) and its cramped and dirty. Then I notice there is no toilet paper and no new rolls laying in this filth to replace it. \nAs I stand there washing my hands, I am literally thinking of how I hope my date doesn't have to use the bathroom and I really hope I can just forget about this bathroom and still give the place 5 stars!\nIt only gets worse - \nOur entrees arrive while I'm in the bog of eternal stench.....I casually walk back to the table as if there was nothing to see there. \nWe have Phad Thai, Some Rice, and an order of Sweet and Sour Chicken (don't even ask why we decide to try this) - And the Phad Thai is generic, your basic Phad Thai. I take a bite and CRUNCH! I must have bit into a rock or some sand or something. I mean, I felt like I had a mouth FULL of ground up teeth! Really weird. I am thinking that it was some dirt from the green onions or something. Nothing I can't handle - but lets make a note that this was a lot of flipping sand, ok? Then The Sweet and Sour Chicken gets there. This junk was like a giant bowl of orange ectoplasm with some fried chicken and veggies floating around in it. It was SUPER SWEET. there isn't enough rice in the WORLD to sop up all this soup. I wouldn't be able to even pick out the pieces I wanted cause it was all COVERED in slimy, sweet goop. This dish was inedible. \nThen my nightmare continues as my date gets up to use the restroom. Oh No......\n\nAs a side note, the service was great.", "author": "Jena D."}

The food was delicious and came out quick.  The service was friendly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate #2  11-1-06\n\nI have yet to find a better Thai place so I gave Patpong another chance.  I still haven't dined in the restaurant but the take out service was quick and easy.  Maybe they were having an off day last time.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy once favorite Thai restaurant now  leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years.  I know how important good service and customer service is ... if there is a problem or error ... it should be remedied IMMEDIATELY.  \n\nMy friend and I phoned in an order for pick up.  First of all, we were told it'd be ready in 20 minutes ... we gave them 25-30 and it wasn't quite ready.  When we got home, our appetizer was missing.   We called right away, they acknowledged that the appetizer had been left out.  They apologized and said they would deliver it.  I live 4 1/2 blocks away.  40 minutes later, we were still waiting for our appetizer.  \n\nBy this time we had already eaten the rest of our food.  I called to inquire about the missing dish and I was told it was on it's way now.  It arrived 10 minutes later ... soggy and cold.  (It was a deep fried appetizer ... like tempura ... something that doesn't taste right cold or warmed in the microwave).  \n\nI called back and let them know the dish was soggy and cold and that nearly an hour had passed since I was told it would be delivered.  I was told repeatedly that, \"the restaurant is so busy, very busy.\"  I pointed out that just because we weren't eating in the restaurant doesn't mean we shouldn't get good service ... it was their error ... we had already paid for the dish ... and the fact that I live soooooo close.  \n\nWe no longer wanted the appetizer and asked for our money back.  After several minutes of discussion (I was passed around to 4 different people on the phone and had to reexplain the situation to each of them), I was finally told I could have my money back but they wanted the appetizer back.  \n\n45 minutes passed and no one had come to pick up the dish or bring us our money.  I called AGAIN.  I was told I had to wait 20 more minutes ... until the restaurant closed.  I told them we didn't want to wait 20 more minutes, we'd already been waiting 45 minutes for our money and another hour prior to that for our food.  \n\nI pointed out how ridiculous it was ... especially since I was only a few blocks away and it was their error in the first place.  I told them we couldn't wait any longer ... that we had plans to go out.  Then the woman had the nerve to tell me I should have told her sooner that I had plans to go out ... had she known I wanted to go out, she would've had the delivery guy come back right away.  I seriously doubt that.\n\nIn the end, we had to go pick up the money and return the food on our way out.  When we arrived the staff didn't say a word to us, just handed over the money.  The woman I spoke with on the phone stared at me with a mad look on her face.  \n\nLooks like I'm on the lookout for a new Thai restaurant.  \n\n2-24-06\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nI've never had a bad dish at Patpong.  The food is delicious and looks and tastes extremely fresh all the time.  I'm only giving 4 stars because I have yet to dine in the restaurant and experience the service, but I give them 5 stars on their free and fast delivery.  I eat Thai food about twice a week and this is the best place I've found in the city so far.  I highly recommend the garlic pepper pork or prawn dish and the Fresh rolls.", "author": "Miss Purr fec t."}

I drank water and my boyfriend had a beer. There wasn't anything fancy or extra, we went straight to the point.\nI really find it hard to believe that you can't be full from sharing some entrees and rice.

Sooooo good.\n\nOther than that, the food is decent, good portions, fair price, done quickly, etc.  I almost always get it as takeout rather than eat there, so I can't say too much about the service, but the few times I've eaten there I had no complaints.  Basically your average Thai place, I'd say.\n\nBut the Thai toast!", "author": "Morgan M."}

It may be a tad expensive but to me, it's worth the price... It's also a little hole in the wall out in the Richmond, so don't go during busy hours... But I highly highly recommend them...

Did they change the chef?  We ordered the Pad See Eu again, and it wasn't the same.  The service this time was spotty, they seemed to have forgotten what we ordered (though they were nice about bringing us the right stuff).  We also got the garlic prawns and ginger chicken.  Both were OK, but nothing outstanding.  Man, I swear we were in a different restaurant last time.", "author": "Waynele Y."}

These, both good things, because when I say I want it spicy, I really, really MEAN it.  The sadist in me loves the total numbness of tongue, or TNT, if I may.  Patpong does not pussyfoot on the spice.  They elephantfoot or whatever the equivalent is.  When I tell them how spicy I want it, they wink a little, like, \"We're going to hurt you, you know this yes?\" and off they go to the chef-lair to plot my demise with the most bad-ass, tattoed ruffians of the nightshade family. I honestly believe they cultivate a magical pepper there yet undiscovered by anyone else and they save it for MY food!  \n\nLunch is great, very inexpensive, good value, and quick.  The chairs look like they may have once had padding but it was torn off and then the frame was soaked to get all the possible butt-comforting nuggets of padd off.  What remains is what you find yourself sitting on when you dine in at Patpong, which is why I'd recommend delivery-\n\nGotta say, it's always packaged well, comes with my requested extra peanut sauce, and offers great little gems of tastiness for next-day fridge diggins.  \n\nWho are all these folks on here leaving hungry?  I often feel explosively full after a good frolic with Patpong's danger team, that being Tofu Satay and Pad Kee Mao.  I occasionally add the Hot and Sour Soup when I'm not being rational with myself, which always results in ye olde, \"It's time for pants with a stretchy waistband\" feeling.  I have shared this same meal (well, not the Mao cause my BF can't take it) with my partner in crime, and there were STILL leftovers!   The Pad Thai or noodle dishes are not good reheated, but they historically never have been and noodles are best when they're freshly cooked anyways.  No fault of Patpong's of course; when I solve this world mystery about noodle-to-Fridgidaire hardening ratios, I will build a museum around my house and charge admission.  Til' then, it's the dish you should just try to finish so you don't have to get all verklempt about throwing it away.\n\nYou could always give it to a Freegan.", "author": "Lea N."}

My friend's favorite thai place was closed, but things were looking up when you came along offering free delivery on a chilly night. I ordered my standards: tom ka gai and panang curry with chicken and tofu plus thai iced tea and pad thai.  The iced tea was absolutely perfect, the soup was acceptable until I realized how much of the container was filled with the inedible galang stalks and kaffir leaves. The chicken was way tough. But where you truly dropped the ball was with the curry- because you didn't send along any rice. The chicken here was much better but the dish overall was mediocre with green pepper. Pad thai was totally greasy and uninspired. Pass.", "author": "Greycella L."}

Patpong stands out!\n\nFriendly staff especially the young woman who works there week nights, politely took my order over the phone and even confirmed it with me before hanging up. And even dealt with my crazy antics when I changed the order twice more within 5 minutes. Everything was bagged, tagged and ready to go when I went to pickup, even when I added additional items. \n\nNot anymore expensive than other places, got 5 dishes and rice for around $44 and even had leftovers for lunch. If you like Spicy Thai make sure to convey that over the phone or when ordering. The Brown and Green Curry were mildly spicy at best, but I am whimp. \n\nPapaya salad, brown curry and shrimp and cashew dish are the best. Although as a true American I am going with some fried dishes next time. Ordering rice for about 4 is the equivalent for 6, so cut down on the rice order, unless you like starch.", "author": "David B."}

Another patron complained to the waitresses that he'd been sitting there for a while but hadn't been given a menu since he got there. \nThe food is decent. the stuffed chicken appetizer was tasty, even though my utensil-challenged brother complain about not being able to cut it. I also had the duck, which only came with maybe 6 small slices on a bed of veggies for $10. My brother had the crab meat pad thai which looked tasty, but I didn't get any. My mom had the \"huge salad\" which has a weird name but was rather large. I didn't care for the dressing on it, but I'm not really into dressing all that much. \nI think the wait kind of ruined the whole experience for me.

I went with some friends and we all had something different and all of the dishes were tasty but nothing stood out.  A nice lemon-grass dish was the best.  \n\nBut we had a coupon for a free desert and also a parking ticket that needed validation (they have a deal with a parking lot down the street).  They wouldn't do both things--it was either the desert or the parking.  It clearly said on the coupon and the parking ticket that there were no strings attached etc.  Anyway, we took the desert--a weird fried thing--and paid the parking.\n\nWhat could have been an o.k. experience went south.

We started off with the green onion pancakes which was  nice and flaky and very tasty.  It came with a dip consisting of chili oil with cucumber slices. We ordered Pad Kee Mao which was rice noodles with pork and red peppers.  We also had their spicy chicken fried rice with basil, red peppers, onions and green beans.  The chicken were in chunks and not your normal diced chicken.   Although the food was great, the portions were small.  I've gone to other Thai restaurants and their portions are twice the size of what we got.   We were the only two customers in the restaurant and I felt the service could've been better.   We had to flag the waitress down to fill up our water glasses.  Plus, on the website, it indicated that there was a Special Offer -- Receive a FREE dessert with your dinner order.  I asked about it and the waitress said they no longer offer the free deseert.  I told her it should  be removed from the website as it is deceiving.", "author": "Mary C."}
