{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "First, the pizza was excellent. The cheese was creamy, the tomato sauce vibrant, basil fresh, and pepperoni was perfectly spicy.\n\nI stopped by because the reviews were good, but immediately I was in the awkward position of whether I should find something else for dinner because they close in 20 minutes. The man who was firing the pizzas, explained curtly that it's to-go only as they close soon.  I should have just accepted his clear body language and found something else to eat, because I gave the wrong answer by saying to-go was alright, and both myself and my girlfriend felt his annoyance. \n\nThough their sign says pizza cooks in 2 minutes, I felt that I greatly inconvenienced this worker for asking for to-go with plenty of time to complete my order before \"close\".\n\nUltimately, I wouldn't have been compelled to write a review if they, at first, said, \"I'm sorry, we close soon and this is the reason why it would be difficult to make food for you.\" If he really wanted to refuse service, he should have just said no, instead his bad attitude really soured the experience.\n\nAlthough a little pricey, the quality and taste of the pizza, means CPC still deserves a recommendation, but just don't go in the last half hour of business.", "author": "Justin G."}

Frozen pizza would have been a better choice. \nThe concierge at the Sheraton recommended this place (it was the closest to our hotel of his recommendations). \nThe crust was burned on the bottom and uncooked throughout the sauce was flavorless. It was overall just burned, soggy and and sloppy. We were tired and ended up just eating the toppings and leaving the horrible crust. \nIf you are a pizza lover and crave pizza frozen is a better bet than this pizza.

Oh man, we are just dying to go back to have their margerita pizza again!\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe wife and I were out at Fort Mason to check out an arts and crafts show.  We parked a bit farther than expected, so we decided to have lunch first before we went to the show.  \n\nCARMEL PIZZA\nA tiny little place in the famous Fisherman's Wharf area, CPC is a nicely decorated place with quite the Italian theme going.  They really created a great little atmosphere in such a small space.  We were impressed and I think you will be too.  \n\nOne thing though that you might find difficult if you're under 5'10\" is the very unusually high counter.\n\nFOOD\nAs we didn't want to be too full going to the show, we split their margherita pizza, a soda, and a bottle of water.  So let's talk about, no GUSH, about this pizza:  while it's not a true NY thin crust, I don't think it's intended to be.  But the crust was incredible.  Very thin like we like it and crispy all around.  Like perfectly crispy.  And the sauce. We talked with the owners about their ingredients and she said all their pizza sauce was made fresh on premise.  I totally can believe it.  And of course the cheese and basil.  In combination, wow.  We still talk about their pizza.  It was that good!\n\nOh they have their own freshly made chili oil.  While not as spicy as we like it, it was enough to add that right amount of spicy flavor that's right for Italian food.\n\nRETURN VISIT?\nEmphatic yes! If only we lived closer!", "author": "Bob K."}

So we wanted a little break from seafood and wanted pizza. We yelped and came here. Very small little place you can miss it. \n\nWe ordered the all pork pizza and diovola. Omg hands down one of the best pizzas I've had. It's made in a stone wood fire oven which is the best. It's thin crust (my fav). It's not too oily and just right amount of spice. The All Pork Pizza was the best. \n\nIt came out with a side of chili oil. That was the best part. We just drizzled that all over the pizza and asked for more! we loved it so much we had to order another pizza. So delicious. It looks like a local spot too because the owner was very familiar with the customers and he was a very nice guy. \n\nOnly bad thing, I think the price of the pizzas should be less. The size is quite small for the price but does not take away from all the flavors and goodness of the pizza.

It's in a cozy patio where you order from the counter and they'll bring the pizza out. I got the Diavola and I was nervous that I'd have a ton left over eating by myself but surprisingly... I ate it all. The pizza isn't super filling and the first few bites of the slice are almost paper thin. Luckily it gets better as you work your way up to that fabulous blistered and chewy crust. I almost wish they would make a giant pizza donut where they cut away the middle of the pizza and just give you the outskirts.. anyways.\n\nThe price is pretty high, at $14-$20 a pizza. If you're sharing as a snack it may be justified but I think if you're super hungry sharing a pizza won't fill you up much. They do offer 3 types of bottled beers here so it's a nice retreat from the sun and the crowds. I did enjoy my time here even and you can't really complain about anything being overpriced in this area. Happy I stopped in.", "author": "Emily B."}

I never heard of this place and since it was in the fisherman's wharf area so I was a bit skeptical. Ummm it's a hidden gem for sure!! What stood out was that they have a wood fire oven somewhere in there. It's a small spot so I was trying to see where it was but couldn't see it. They do have a huge stack of wood on the side though. \n\nWe ordered a margherita pizza and it came out perfect. The dough was nicely done with a little char but not enough to detract from the overall taste. The tomatoes they use have the perfect amount of sweetness and tang and not too wet that it makes the pizza soggy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "I wrestled with whether or not to write a review. Why? The pizza was really good and I enjoy supporting non-chain businesses like this that put quality and experience before profit squeezing. I'm always afraid that something negative that I experienced could have been a one-off situation, so I prefer writing about places that I have visited more than once. Still, I've passed by this place quite a few times before finally buying a pizza. Carmel Pizza Company is slowly building a reputation as a great little pizza spot near the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area. \n\nFOOD:\n\nFirst off: The pizza was good. I mean, it was REALLY good. It tasted a little better than I expected -- and my expectations were already a bit high. Like others have written, it did taste like a healthier, gourmet pizza that you might find at a classier locale. My dad lived in Italy and this tastes a lot like the pizza that he described of Naples. I've had similar pizzas (even in San Francisco), but this was certainly comparable with the \"fine\" (aka pricey) pizza pies found elsewhere. \n\nWe ordered the Margherita. I requested pepperoni to be added only upon half of the pizza (and I was willing to pay for full price), but the man said that they don't do split toppings. I was disappointed, because I was willing to pay full price for half the pepperoni slices (not difficult or \"splitting\" the toppings in my opinion). \n\nLOCATION: The Carmel Pizza Company is located on Jones Street between Jefferson Street (along the bay) and Beach Street. It is located right off the sidewalk in front of Fisherman's Wharf Parking. It is also nestled between a few other shops -- like The Baked Bear ice cream cookie sandwiches and Tanguito (the Argentinian empenada food shop). It can be hard to see it if you're not looking -- because the patio obscures the little restaurant from view. Thankfully, there is a little sign out front.\n\nIt is also located very near the seafood spots along the grotto and wharf. If you're not into crab, then this is a perfect option while touring that area!\n\nEXPERIENCE: The patio is small with limited seating. There are a few tables out front too (along the sidewalk). Thankfully, my wife and I were biking through the city and stopped during the early afternoon on a weekday.  \n\nThere was a Hispanic couple with young children dining on the patio. They purchased a pizza and the husband walked next door and bought either an Argentinian empenada from Tanguito or some fish from The Codmother. While the rest of the family dined on pizza, he took a bite of his food. However, the woman working there informed him (from the serving window) that they don't permit outside food. The man quickly put his food away and waited patiently while his family finished their food. I really felt bad for the man -- because there weren't any crowds waiting for food. \n\nIf I had to rate this place on the basis of the food and proximity to the Fisherman's Wharf, it would be a solid FIVE STARS. However, I was a bit disappointed by the unwillingness to add pepperoni to just one side of the pizza (despite a willingness to pay for pepperoni for the entire pizza). \n\nMore importantly, I felt embarrassed for the young couple and their two children being unabashedly scolded for having \"outside food.\" I completely get the fact that restaurants don't like outside food on their premises. However, in this case, these were obviously tourists (they said that they were from Southern California) and they were sitting in the patio eating a pizza and drinks from Carmel Pizza Company anyway at a time in which there weren't other customers waiting for seats. \n\nThose minor issues caused me to drop a star from an otherwise perfect five stars. The food was terrific! It was well worth the money and time!", "author": "Chris M."}

This isn't New York so you're not gonna find it here.     Surprisingly tho, This crust was good!  They actually stretch it out and form it there.  They have a wood Fire going in a nice dome style Brick oven. It gives the crust a bit of a crunch and slight char which is what you want.  The cheese was decent, I call it mild Mozzarella but was good texture.  The sauce wasn't zesty at all in my taste and also a tad mild but was ample on the slices.   I gave them 4 stars only because they're charging a Dollar for Parmesan cheese as a topping and the prices for a personal pie are a tad high.    If the sauce had some roasted garlic flavor or some fresh oregano or some fresh basil and the marinara or pizza sauce was bright zesty or bold and the pie came out garnished. I'd give it 5 stars for sure! At that price, I just feel like I'm being banged out for the grated cheese.   Overall it's a good slice and worth the trip over there for sure!", "author": "Chris N."}

The decor is almost like walking into an enchanted forest. Just simply breathtaking. Its like a food truck with a nice decorative tent over it.\n\nThey have an outdoor set up however covered outdoor area with heat lamps on top of the corner tables . This was great as it was a bit chilly when I went in April.\nWe ordered the Romantico pizza which had mozzarella, Arugula, Balsamic Glaze and Heirloom Tomato . The pizza was $18.00 which I thought was okay however I was also expecting a much more larger pizza. It was around 7:45pm when we ordered this pizza. I do feel like I left hungry from here as they were advertised to close at 9 on that day. We tried to order another pizza at 8:30pm and they were already closing their service which was absurd. I was annoyed that even though we were in the restaurant and it was no where near 9pm we still had a half hour , we weren't able to order more food.\n\nThis is why I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5. How do you close a half hour before your closing time and stop taking orders?\nThe pizza also was really good and well done. However, NOT WORTH THE $18.00. If you are going to charge that much money for a small size pizza please increase the portion size. That was way too small of a pizza it was meant for just 1 person.\n\nEven though the scenery and feel of this place was extremely relaxed and romantic. I wouldn't go back to this place for two reasons-  1 THE PRICE and 2 false advertisement on that day. \n\nOther than that go early and order more pizza on the first go before you leave this place hungry.\n\nI felt rushed and over all paid way more than I feel I should have for this pizza.

I asked about it and the staff said it's not meant for a group and we should get pizzas. I asked how many pizzas we should get for five people and the lady working said 2-3. This would end up being the same price as five lunch specials for the five of us so we pizzas. We got two as we weren't very hungry. Overall the pizza seemed too expensive for the size and quality. North Beach is near here and plenty of places have better food that's cheaper. \n\nI paid with a credit card and got a mini survey from Square asking for feedback. I gave honest feedback, that I thought I didn't get the quality or quantity that I would expect for the price I paid. I got a response right away from the owner or a staff member saying I should have ordered more pizza for five people and I'm the only one to give negative feedback. They said one pizza is for one person, though that's not what I was told in person. Even so I didn't care much about how much we got, I cared that the price doesn't match what we received. I didn't want anything from them, I was asked to give feedback and I did. \n\nThe owner or worker who responded was rude and condescending. Negative feedback is meant to make a place better and my feedback was far from criticising just to criticize. I wanted them to know others may also be unhappy if the same thing happens to them. Instead of replying to me with something positive or even neutral, or not replying at all, they immediately blamed me for the negative experience and told me what I did wrong. That's awful customer service for someone who's giving honest feedback on a private feedback form.

There's just something about eating at a restaurant that, for me, requires the company of another human being. Pizza is perfect for the lone traveler wishing to grab a meal to enjoy in the comfort of their hotel room (me). No utensils required, and still good at room temperature. \n\nI chose the classic margherita + mushrooms. The crust did consist of overly toasted bits, but I worked around it.  A bit pricey at $17, but they offer $1 off with cash. Decent pie overall. Bought two, gave one to a man that crossed my path on the street that cold evening.

The pizzas range $12+, and are worth every penny. The crispy, wood fired crust is savory, beautifully charred and crisp, and leaves nothing to be desired in a wood fired crust. The sauce is a delicate balance of sweet and savory that is a true testament to the freshly grown organic heirloom tomatoes used in their recipes. Carmel pizza does an excellent job of allowing you to customize a pizza to your liking, or choose a pre made pizza from their excellent menu. Carmel is well worth the trip from any part of the city, and stands up to the \"big boys\" of San Francisco pizza lore. Carmel is a place that can be truly enjoyed and appreciated by both locals and out of towners.", "author": "Dustin S."}

Well, thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, I searched some places and found that Carmel Pizza had a super high rating. My initial thought was to skip this joint and go for more seafood, but decide to give it a try.....and boy was it worth it!! What a lovely little relaxing place in the middle of Fishermans Wharf!! On Jones st near the pier, there are several food trucks that really are a must. This one is one of them. When you enter, you really feel like your in a little happy village away from the hustle and bustle. Ordering is a breeze and in no time, pizza is served to you at your table or you can take it out in a box- whichever you prefer! \nAlthough I thought that I have had my fair share of pizza and this one would be A-ok....I was wrong. Let's just say that I have never ate a whole pizza in my life....until I ate the pizza here. First off, the crust is crazy super thin so you eat more toppings than crust. The toppings are so fresh it really provides so many remarkable flavors that you forget where you are and you seriously sink into pizza oblivion. \nIf we were staying in SF longer, we would for sure return to this amazing place.

On big doughy slices of pizza, I'll eat the toppings and leave the entire crust behind. But I do have a weak spot for thin crust pizza. Especially a soft crust with a nice chew. I'll eat an entire slice of that. Crust and all! Carmel pizza company has the type of pizza I'm looking for. On Saturday, September 12th around 1:45pm, Rodney H and I stopped by for lunch.\n\nWe shared the Diavola ($17): mozzarella, arugula, asiago, pepperoncini picante, salame piccante. Let's start with the crust. Thin, but not cracker thin, so you still feel like you're eating something substantial. The crust held up the toppings well. Spicy, melty with a nice freshness from the arugula. And I loved the chewy crust. Wash it down with nice cold beer and you have a great pairing. I opted for Anchor steam beer.\n\nCPC is outdoors, but it's actually enclosed pretty well. On a chilly day, you don't feel the wind or cold much. They've done a nice job with the space.\n\nGreat pizza in a fun casual atmosphere. Who knew this existed in a touristy area?! I think I now have a reason to come to here more often.", "author": "Elena N."}

Within easy walking distance of our Fisherman's Wharf hotel was Carmel Pizza.    We loved the simple outdoor seating in the pretty patio.   As soon as we saw the variety of pizzas we knew we had made the right choice.   While the Tutto Porko with mozzarella, Applewood smoked ham, Italian sausage, Italian dry salami and pepperoni was so incredibly tempting, we were in the mood for something lighter.\n\nWe settled on the Crudo e Parma, which has mozzarella fior di latte, arugula, Prosciutto crudo di Parma, and Parmiggiano reggiano.  It was prefect.  The crust was thin and crispy with nicely charred spots that you get thanks to a wood burning oven.  The toppings were generous and fresh.\n\nThe weather was perfect, we thoroughly enjoyed our pizza and nice glass of wine out on the patio.  A great casual location for some authentic wood fired pizza!", "author": "Pam G."}

Twice.\n\nSo the second time around, we opted to stay & try something else.\n\nEnter Carmel Pizza Company.\n\nEverything about CPC threw me off.\n\nThe title threw me off.  \nI thought it literally was a Carmel Pizza Company.  I expected a thicker crust & a pie for the masses; a bit generic. \n\nThe space threw me off.  \nI initially thought tourist, but it's just...cool.  A patio w heat lamps for the SF chill, a cool mist for our warmer days, bubbles dancing in the air automatically above the entrance, homey touches hanging everywhere.  It's straight up charming.\n\nThe pizza threw me off.  \nWe ordered the Diavola...\narugula, asiago, mozzarella, pepperoncini picante, salami picante.\n\nThe crust:\nA thin wood fired pizza oven crust that was impressive.  If it's not soggy, you're ahead of the game.  It was not at all soggy.  Win.\n\nThe toppings:\nA light spread of delicious red sauce.  It was delicate but still delivered big on flavor.  The pepperoncini picante added a divine heat that didn't reveal itself on first bite, but on first inhalation.  The salami picante complimented the pepperoncini like 2 coworkers that love working together.  And the addition of asiago as a star instead of just a small supporting role?  A fantastic medley of flavors.\n\nIt was a thoroughly outstanding pie.\n\nWe were told that there are no other locations.  This is it.  They started as a catering company, & set up shop here 3 years ago.  What a great addition to SF's pizza landscape.\n\nAnd A HUGE upgrade to the food options on the wharf.\n\n5 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

We were in San Francisco and had several days of large meal and just wanted a simple meal. I checked on yelp while we were walking along Fisherman's Wharf and stumbled upon the reviews for Carmel Pizza. What a find!\n\nFirst of all it is a glorified food truck, literally. It has been enhanced with an adorable garden like dining patio that is blocked off from the street.  There are no more than maybe 12 tables. They have very reasonably priced bottled beer, wine, soft drinks and water.  The pizza is by far the best I have had in years.

The little pizza oven is housed in a permanent food truck setting and it's so adorable and casual. The Caesar salad has wonderful dressing that the owner makes from scratch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-10", "description": "Damn good wood-fired pizza in a cozy outdoor setting by Fisherman's Wharf. \n\nI am beginning to check off pizza places in San Francisco from my must-try-pizza-list and I recently stopped by Carmel Pizza Company.  I first noticed their sign said that their pizza was fired in an oven powered by almond wood--interesting.  I can't say that I noticed anything different in taste; but, I digress.  The location is right near pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf.  Yes, it is in a touristy area but it is still worth a visit.  The owners seemed to have converted a food truck into a shaded patio area with some interesting decorations featuring succulent plants (see the pic I posted), metal tables, and trellises.  We ordered two pizzas, the Quattro Formaggi with sausage (mozzarella, asiago, gorgonzola, and pecorino toscano;18.00$) and Romantica with pepperoni (mozzarella, arugula, balsamic glaze, heirloom tomatoes, and parmigiano reggiano; 19.00$).  Non-meat toppings were 1 dollar and fancier meaty ones were 2 bucks each.  Vegetable ingredients are locally sourced from the farmers market, a nice bonus.  I should note that they also serve beer and wine. \n\nOur food was served mind-alteringly-fast.  I forgot how quick wood-fired pizza cooks.  The size was about 14inches per pie.  The pizza was a bit pricey in my opinion but I soon forgot about that when I tasted it.  I preferred the Quattro formaggi over the Romantica because I don't like green stuff on my pizza :]  Overall, this is excellent pizza indeed with fresh toppings and chewy-wood-fired crust that you won't skip eating.   \n\n*Tip: Check-in on Yelp for a dollar off any pizza.", "author": "David D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-14", "description": "It's roughly 8 am in the morning and a friend and I wake up and tart craving pizza. We brainstorm for a second and I tell her I know of a place down at fisherman's wharf that has amazing pizza and it's delicious. We both agree that's what we want but take probably 4 more hours to get out of bed.\n\nRested, relaxed and all fresh and smelling like a like a late night drink we walk out into the blinding light of the world. Caught two buses and a short walk with the assistance of gps to the spot. Not a line in sight nor person knowing of this little gem in sight. We walk up and are greeted by a woman, she asked if I have been here before I said \"yes\" then continued with a flurry of questions. \n\nThe chef or \"pizza dude\" told me he'd give me a card full o stamps for being a returning customer. I happily responded with thank you! We ordered two glasses of wine, a pepperoni and a pizza called something that completely slips my mind. It did consist of arugula and prosciutto and also a Caesar salad.\n\nWe sat patiently after I was told They'd bring our drinks out and we sat and drank. Waited and waited for roughly 10 mins and no salad. No biggie I figured they'd maybe bring it with the pizza. Out comes the pizza and no salad. \n\nLuckily our senses were overwhelmed with joy and mouths were watering from the fresh Parmesan regiano and prosciutto and pepperoni. We quickly dug in and were in heaven. Thin slices with an airy crust and just enough grease to satisfy but not make you sick or skin greasy and the rich and bold taste of the marinara even though lightly spread across the doughy goodness.\n\nWe completely forgot about the salad and nor did we care at that point. So we let it slide. We devoured both pizzas matching slice for slice like Blows in a Ali and Frazier match. Both stuffed and feeling overly satisfied I walked up to pay. \n\nI told them after handing them my card thy I never got my salad and I guess it slipped the woman's mind completely and she asked I wanted it now. I politely declined and paid. The price was a bit steep but given the satisfaction I didn't have any worry in my mind. \n\nIf you're looking for some of the best pizza (artisan) pizza in the city look no further. You won't have a line here like at Tony's or Cappos of north beach and you get quality service. Although after you get your food nobody comes and checks on you to see if you're satisfied. \n\nOverall job well done Carmel!!\n\nPS. I may have told my date I've been here but mid way through I told her I've never been lol but have tried a cold Slice from a friend.", "author": "Robert B."}

We ordered a Margherita pizza and a mushroom, dried tomato and sausage pizza.  The thin crunchy crust shifted the focus to the fresh tomato sauce and the cheese, and the results were ultimately satisfying.\n\nService was somewhat slow, especially since we were the only ones getting food, and the pizza is slightly on the pricey side.  However, the seating area was a lovely patio type arrangement, open to the air and even with a fountain.  Not a lot of seating room though, more like one of the stands that you see on the side of the road or a food truck with an extended covered eating area, but this pizza place is very much worth a visit if you are dropping by Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Emily Y."}

I had the 4 cheese pizza and my husband had the tomato and arugula pizza. We both loved it.

It all started with Tanguito for some Awesomely Awesome Argentinian Cuisine.  Next came the quirky Codmother and her Awesomely Awesome Fish & Chips, Fish Tacos, and Deep Fried Oreos and Twinkies.  That leads us to the new kid on the block that just opened, Carmel Pizza Company.  And they're making a huge statement with their Awesomely Awesome Wood-Fired Pizzas and Porchetta Sandwiches.\n\nLet's start with the Pizza.  We ordered their special of the day which was their Caprese Pizza (http://bit.ly/Xc00uv).  It's basically like a Margherita with heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella.  This was probably one of the better Margherita pizzas I've had in my lifetime.  The crust was thin but had a nice light crispy texture to it and all together with the cheese and toppings made for a really delicious pie.\n\nThe La Porchetta Sandwich (http://bit.ly/T45bxV).  OMGYUM!!  I might get bashed on here if I say that this sandwich is way better than Roli Roti's.  But you have to believe me because it really is!  Prepared pretty much the same way with arugula in an Acme Roll, the big difference here is that it's not as greasy as Roli Roti's.  That actually might turn off a few folks because that's actually an important trait their Porchetta Sandwich has, but for me, I can live without it.  The cracklins and Tuscan spices already provide enough flavor and the big plus is they load up the sandwich with a very generous amount of Porchetta.  I suggest you come here and try it for yourself and be the judge.  You definitely won't have to wait as long as you would at Roli Roti.\n\nHella good Porchetta Sandwich and Hella Good Pizza!

The ambiance is quaint and charming - love the outdoor seating with the succulents covering the walls. \n\nWe had a bianco, romantica (with prosciutto added - do this) and the diavola (plus a side of bruschetta). All incredible - the crust is unparalleled - light and crispy but still substantial enough to hold up the toppings. I chatted with the owners - Amanda and AJ - who were super friendly and obviously passionate about food. Amanda lived in Italy and studied cooking there so these two know their stuff.

The seating area is very adorable, perfect for a little date or even a catching up spot with friends. \n\nCustomer service was great. They were patient when we chose our pizza. And gave us a $1 off if we paid in cash. Love how quick they were with clearing the table when we finished eating. \n\nAt first I was iffy about the pricing. Shared a Margherita pizza with a friend and we loved it! The tomato sauce isn't overwhelming (which is a major plus for me because I hate when I taste tomato sauce than the actual pizza). And the thin crust of the pizza was quite a pleasing touch to it along with the basil.\n\nMy other friend got the Diavola. It was a really fresh pizza. The green topping added a unique taste to the pizza and overall was better than I expected to be.\n\nThe pizzas are worth the prices!\n\nThe downfall was that the pizza was slightly burnt, but it wasn't that serious to complain about. \n\nThe succulent wall is absolutely adorable, by the way. \n\nGlad that I tried this place out!", "author": "Amy T."}

After all, I've also seen Pizza Hut locations get 5-star reviews.  Anyway, Carmel was just around the corner from our hotel near Fisherman's Wharf so it was an easy walk.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we ate the last piece, we were in heaven.  First of all, the service was warmly friendly with each question and request we had. Every interaction was met with a genuine smile, which is a big deal during Christmas week in San Francisco!\nWe were four hungry pizza lovers so it was recommended that we share 2-3 pizzas since they're 10-12 inches in diameter.  Of course, we went for 3 because there's nothing worse than running short of pizza except perhaps running short of bacon at breakfast.  We shared a couple of really good Caesar salads that had great dressing and shaved Parmesan cheese.  The pizzas came out shortly after.  These are Neopolitan pizzas cooked in a brick oven so please don't expect something that looks or tastes like a $5 Hot-n-Ready from LC...this isn't that place.  Instead, expect top quality ingredient combinations on a wonderfully flavorful and chewy thin crust that might have a little bit of char from the oven...it's not burnt, it adds to the flavor and presentation. \nAll four of us walked away incredulous that we found such delicious pizza near Fisherman's Wharf.  And I don't mean delicious for Fisherman's Wharf, I mean delicious against any pizza I've ever eaten, but it happened to be near the Wharf.  \n\nP.S. In case it isn't obvious from the other pictures, you do eat outside here under a covered veranda with outdoor heaters.  It was plenty comfortable despite the 55 degree outside temperature.", "author": "James M."}

Living in North Beach for 7 years, I have been spoiled by some amazing pizza spots in the neighborhood but Carmel Pizza Company takes the cake.  \n\nThe Diavola is my favorite, it has the perfect amount of spice for those that like their pizza with a little kick.  My girlfriend goes for the Margherita which in my opinion is better than Tony's, is less expensive and you don't have to wait 2 hours to get seated.  Next on the list that I want to try is the Crudo e Parma (from what I've hear the prosciutto on this pizza is heaven-sent). \n\nThe restaurant itself is in a really cool covered patio area.  The ambiance is inviting, relaxing and serves as a perfect escape from the hectic wharf scene.  They have heaters if its cold, good drink selection, and an authentic oven firing up the most delicious pizzas around.  \n\nThe owners -- Amanda and AJ -- are amazing as well.  They are incredibly nice/friendly and have studied pizza-making in Italy, so they know their stuff.  They each work very hard to consistently serve the best pizza.  I know, because we go to Carmel Pizza at least once a week -- often multiple times a week, and embarrassingly enough, have gone back-to-back days on more than one occasion.  We have never been disappointed and look forward to eating there like it's the first time, every time.  They also have a frequent diner card -- which, needless to say, we have put to good use.\n\nI recommend this Carmel Pizza to anyone who will listen. Seriously, stop reading this and go try it if you haven't already.  You won't be disappointed.  Having now written this, I'm suddenly craving a Diavola and will probably go there tonight.....full disclosure, I had their pizza last night as well.

Granted the base was a true authentic Neapolitan style pizza but there was something off with the tomato paste they used. It tasted very plain, maybe they run out of the marinara sauce so they just used a plain tomato sauce out of a tomato tin. That's what it tasted like. \n\nThe staff were friendly and corrected their mistake (forgetting the topping) straight away when I took my pizza back.

It was walking distance from the hotel tell which was great with parking the way it is in SF. \n\nI was expecting an actual restaurant or shop, so following the blue dot on my Map App made it a little hard to find. The pizza joint is a small stand kinda hidden amongst all the touristy stands. It's like you're walking up to a truck/portable stand when you're ordering. Seating is outdoors. It's quite a cute little set up in my opinion. Great place for people watching and also a great spot for eying the F-Line if you're hopping on a bus to get around SF. \n\nFood is cooked super quickly in a wood fired oven and the flavors really deliver. We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza as well as a prosciutto and arugula pizza. Both were tasty and the highlight of the pizza would have to be the wood fired crust. The smoky, light and crispy crust makes this pizza. This is way better than any other tourist spot in the area. \n\nThey don't serve alcohol, but suggested we could get a bottle and drink there.

I think we paid $32 for two pies and, with drinks, it ended up being over $12 per person for our group of three. It's hard to justify spending $12 on a quick pizza dinner.\n\n- For the price, we expected a warmer dining experience and better ware (they gave us paper plates with tacky cartoon Italians on them). But whatever, this was the least of my concerns.\n\n- Aside from the food, the service was great. Everyone was very attentive and friendly.

The wife and I we're somewhat skeptical at first being that it is so close to the Wharf and it being such a tourist trap however we were pleasantly surprised! Some of the best pizza we have had since in Italy a year ago. \n\nWe ordered the Pizza Romantico with Prosciutto Crudo and Parmigiano Reggiano! Highly highly recommend this trio! I had an Anchor Steam and the wife had a Sierra Nevada, beer and pizza! Can't go wrong! If your in the area check it out and if your not get down to the Wharf for some EXCELLENT pizza!! We will definitely be back next time we are in San Francisco!", "author": "Conrad O."}

We were looking for somewhere relaxed to eat near where we were staying and this fit the bill.  We were surprised whenever we got there that it the restaurant felt more like a truck than a true building and that all of the seating was outdoor but we quickly adjusted.\n\nUpon the recommendation of the cashier we decided to split three pizzas amongst the four of us so that we could try a little of everything.  The pizzas that we ordered were the Quattro Formaggio, Crudo e Parma and Diavola.  They were all cooked in the brick oven and reminded me of many true Neapolitan pizzas I have had before.  Thin crust, good sauce and some cheese although not too much.  All of them also tasted pretty good with my favorite being the Quattro.  All of the cheeses on it made it very tasty.  My least favorite was the Crudo e Parma as I thought the prosciutto tasted a little off but it was still good.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  It was a pretty chill place that offered some good authentic Neapolitan pizzas.", "author": "Jason F."}

If this pizza were sold on the East Coast I would try to invest in the company. This is among the top pizzas I've ever had in my life. And I've had a lot of pizza. A lot. I don't know where to begin. The owners are friendly and charming. The space, though it is \"food truck\", is almost 100% enclosed with the ceiling, heaters, tables etc. - all what looks like completely custom fabricated stuff. A lot of love has gone into the space.  The pizza is off the charts. Super-duper thin, with small patches of slightly oven-carbonized crust, like the best thin crunchy chewy pita toast you've ever had.    But much better than that.  The ingredients seem like they were all made from scratch five minutes ago. Everything looks immaculate in the kitchen. I personally saw the chef take the prosciutto from between thin wax paper slice by slice.  The mozzarella seems like it was made an hour ago - as he made my pizza he put small hand shaped balls of it strategically across the top like cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. I wanted so badly to stop eating on the fourth slice but I just couldn't. Luckily the pizza is so thin and light that I didn't feel \"impaled\" on my own dinner.   The small Caesar salad was phenomenal too.   Everything completely homemade including I believe the croutons.  What an absolute gem this place is!", "author": "Matthew P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-04", "description": "This place, right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf, serves great pizza.  They use a wood oven and use the classic Napoletana recipe with fresh ingredients.  The crust is a little thinner than other Napoletana pizza restaurants in San Francisco, which is good for me.  Their price is also slightly cheaper than similar restaurants in San Francisco if you pay with cash.  The ambiance is very good; it looks like a little urban park.  The kitchen employees were very friendly and let me enter the kitchen and look at the oven.  The only quibble I have about the place is that their crust is a tiny bit saltier than I wished, although that doesn't penalize them much.  That's still four and a half stars, which I rounded up to five.\n\nAnother reviewer posted here that their pizzas were burned.  That was not the case for me.  My pizza was perfectly cooked.  They must have had a bad day with that customer.\n\nThis pizza is as good as the ones at similar restaurants like Tony's Pizza Napoletana, Pizzeria Delfina, and Zero Zero.

The one we absolutely loved (even more than the first) was their special Caprese pizza. With the description it sounds just like a Napoli, but the Napoli has NOTHING compared to this Caprese pizza. What made the all veggie Caprese pizza so delicious was the heirloom tomatoes that they used. Both pizzas came with a few burnt spots on the sides, but that's very understandable with the whole woodfire ordeal. All you need to do it take it off. The crust tasted delicious by the way. :)\n\nIf you are around the Fisherman's Wharf area and are hungry for some authentic pizza, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed coming here. My husband and I wish so badly that they would have a restaurant down here in LA. Never tasted pizza so good.\n\nNot convinced? Try it yourself and satisfy your appetite as much as we did :)\n\nAlso, the chef is so very kind and eager to serve you. At least he was for us.", "author": "Masumi T."}

Everything we had there was delicious, from a tangy Caesar salad to a caprese salad with amazing heirloom tomatoes that actually TASTED like tomatoes, and very high-quality mozzarella (very creamy and flavorful -- not the usual rubbery mess too many places try to foist off on hapless diners).  \n\nEveryone that works there seems incredibly friendly and sincerely eager to please -- they seem to really want you to enjoy the food that they're so obviously passionate about.\n\nIn short, if you're standing in front of the place, reading this on your smartphone, trying to decide if you should risk it, don't worry.

Yeah there's Gary Danko but elsewhere it's mostly fried calarmi, crab legs and more crab legs, not that those are bad but it's not porchetta and prosciuotto sandwiches!  \n\nEver since London a few years ago I've been yearning for a great porchetta sandwich and tonight my gf and I found it.  Yes it's called Carmel Pizza company and while I can't say whether their pizza is delicious or not, their sandwiches are some of the best ones I've had in a long, long time.  The porchetta comes with chunks of meat and arugula.  The meat is perfect as there are crispy skin, meat and a bit of fat, the perfect balance.  The prosciutto sandwich is equally just as good.  Lots of meat, arugula, heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella.  The sandwiches are so good, I bought an extra one to go.  Both sandwiches have great balance of flavors while being covered in acme bread.\n\nThe guys and girls here are super nice and friendly so service is an A+.

The place is run out of a custom food trailer/building and features al fresco dining in the heart of the Fisherman's Wharf district.  The owner/operators are friendly, enthusiastic and provide excellent service.  But what really gains them the five star rating is the pizza.\n\nThey make personal sized wood fired pizzas that seemed to be around 12\" in diameter, but I might have misestimated the size.  The crust was exceptionally good, crisp with wonderful flavor.  The sauce was very nice providing an well seasoned background to the toppings without overpowering them.  The toppings themselves tasted fresh and high quality.\n\nI had a half and half pizza with their caprese on one side and their garlic and mushroom on the other.  The tomatoes on the caprese side were heirloom tomatoes and tasted nicely ripe and the basil was delightfully flavorful.  The garlic on the other side was well roasted and added a wonderfully subtle array of flavors that blended well with the mushrooms.  My wife had a combination of her choosing and loved it.  She thought the sausage was especially enjoyable.\n\nWe will definitely be back.  The also deliver within five blocks. So consider ordering one if you're in the area.", "author": "Tony P."}

After a LONG day walking around the city, we were exhausted and hungry.  The place is small, but wasn't too busy for a Saturday night.

Our friends that were with us had the pizza panini.  Everything we ordered was delicious. They use very fresh ingredients in everything, and the pizza is thin crust, but the crust is amazingly delicious.  They say the pizzas are supposed to be sort of individual sized, but we had 2 pizzas between 3 of us and there were a couple of extra pieces, so our friends ate them.  We could not waste that delicious pizza!\n\nThey serve beer and wine, although a limited selection, and sodas, which are in a case and you help yourself.  Very informal, but definitely worth a visit.  We liked it so much that we decided to go back again a couple of nights later.  \n\nThe second time i ordered a ceasar salad, which was $9 so i though it would be fairly large.  it was really just an individual portion.

Walk-up ordering to what looks like a food truck and seating (about six tables) on a patio in front of the truck. Very simple menu and a long wait (about 15+ minutes for two 11\" pizzas), but our pizza was really good. We had the caprese special - super fresh tomatoes - and the one with prosciutto and real Parmesan cheese, mmmm. Thin crust, but a little too much crust for my taste. Great way to kick off our time in San Fran, though!", "author": "Kendall T."}

Everyone was super friendly, food came out fast, pleasant seating area out of the wind, and with the wood oven aroma in the air, this place earns an instant 5 stars.\n\nThe food was delicious.  The pizza wasn't greasy and the toppings were fresh.  Three of us split two pies and a salad; it was the perfect amount.  Everything very reasonably priced as well.  Nothing by the slice here, great for mix-n-match with friends or for leftovers.  The Caesar salad was big and not drenched in dressing.\n\nGreat addition to the Jones street lineup.

The place is 5 stars for a small venue/foodtruck type place, but rounding down due to limited seating and no beer/wine choices to enjoy with the pizza.  I took mine to go, so I could enjoy at my hotel with a beer, and that can cause a little cool-down sog factor as you cart the pizza in the cool SF air to your eating place.  I would say it would probably be best to consume on the premises.  The pizzas are not overly big, so most can eat one themselves, and you might want to order two different ones and go halfsies if you are with someone.  I really enjoyed the seasonal Caprese pizza with heirloom tomatoes.  The crust was cooked just right with some softness and crunch on the edges.  The sauce was zesty and brought out good flavors of the fresh buffalo mozz and hairloom tomatoes were killer.  I recommend this place, but next time I will enjoy onsite in their little seating \"garden\" outside the truck.", "author": "Dan M."}

If you're in town and in the mood for Pizza, you MUST go here.\n\nThe Food:\nAt this place as with any good pizza place, toppings are like frosting: good, but not what really makes the pizza great.  It's all about the crust, sauce and cheese and on those three, this place hits all the high notes.\nCrust is thin and flaky, yet chewy.  Perfect if you like thin crust.\nSauce is light, but very savory.\nOverall, delicious.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt's small and kind of hidden, on the east side of the street between Lincoln and Beach, across the street from Wallgreens.\nNice little spot.  Can be romantic. Staff is very friendly.\n\nNotes:\nThey only sell full pizzas (11 inches, 6 slices); not by the slice.  But one person with a good sized appetite can eat a whole pizza by him/herself easily.", "author": "Joe S."}

There was outside seating in front of the truck, and as it was a beautiful day, we were excited to try it out. The service was amazing, the two working that day were the most chill, laid back, and nice individuals we met in SF. The prices were super affordable and the pizza was delicious!

Basic starts at $10, and you choose toppings, either $1/$2 each.  \n\nWe both liked our pizza, and the friendly owner adds much to the atmosphere.

My family and I ate there three times last summer in three days and tried their pizzas and La Porchetta. The food is very good! Fast forward to this summer as I was out to the area again on business. I dropped them a quick message on FB that I would be out and asked if they would have the La Porchetta as some days the sell out pretty quick. Imagine my surprise when I show up at 5:00 and the girls recognize me. They show me the note they had made to save a La Porchetta for me. 1st class if you ask me!! Until next year, I will think about the wonderful food that is waiting for me!", "author": "Matt G."}

I ordered a cheese and he ordered a pepperoni pizza.  The crust was delightful and crisp.  The cheese was a mixture of 3 cheeses and was absolutely delicious.  The pepperoni was spicy and great.  I highly recommend this pizza.  The place has great ambience for a truck place.  The pizza arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering it.  Super friendly people.", "author": "Kathy K."}

I have absolutely no reason to slander their business. With my 10 percent employee discount -- which they've since DISCONTINUED -- I paid $8 for the pepperoni pizza two years ago. I think I know what I paid and I think she knows, too. A few months ago the price was $15 total, with tax. I think that's where the discrepancy is when she says $14, which is fair enough.Regardless, you will see that the price of their pepperoni pizza isn't listed on their current online menu, nor are the prices of their toppings. BUT -- let's just say it's true that the price started at $10 and is now $14. That's still a 40 percent increase! Are you saying the price of your pepperoni and/or other artisan ingredients has gone up that much? And if so, aren't you able to absorb at least some of that price increase for the sake of your customers? \n\nSeems silly to go back and forth on this. The pizza's good, but, no matter the rationalizations or excuses -- the price increase was, IMHO, outrageous. I don't think anything more needs to be said. \n\n09/30/14\n\nThey can provide as many excuses as they want... Plenty of other family-owned artisinal businesses in the area haven't raised prices one iota in the last two years. The price of the pepperoni pizza has gone from $8 to $15. Fact. I have no reason to slander a restaurant, least of all a family-owned one. Wishing them the best but it's too steep...", "author": "Matt P."}

It tastes ok but was nothing exceptional.", "author": "Tessa M."}

For the wharf a fair deal on a thin crust pizza - the crust was a little too floppy and had trouble holding the toppings, but probably as I told them I was in a hurry and they didn't cook it long enough.   Giving it 4 stars as it didn't \"wow\" me.   The service was great - very nice people.   Can easily take it to go.

Girl that took my order was nice but really didn't help much as I wasn't sure what kind of pizza I fancied. I realize not her job but she just wanted to take my order and get on with it. She assured me that the pizza would be great and that was it. Ended up with a different pizza then I ordered. I didn't complain as I didn't have time to have them change it and I am sure they would of had I asked. So that is certainly not their fault!  It is thin crust and others that were eating there sure seemed to enjoy their pizza. I have definitely had worse pizzas and I am sure I would give them another shot when I am back in the area. I know that they sold out of pizzas the night before so I am certain that they are doing something right. Tons of topping choices. I would be sure to be more specific with my order next time. My guess if you check this place out and know what you want- you will love it! We will be sure to try again next time. The owner/chef seems very sweet and cares about her customers liking what they get. My own fault for being rushed and not letting her know.", "author": "Shansar A."}

Had to come down to pier 39 to get my fill of Oysters.  Upon parking the car, we were met by a gentleman looking over a small wooden fence, who told us if we were looking for a great wood fired pizza, his place was the place.  \nLet me say, I did not miss having the Oysters!  AJ introduced himself (Owner) and we told him to make me his best Pie....He made a Caprese!  Fresh cut heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella.   This was the best pizza I had in a very long time!  \nThe passion AJ exuded when discussing his pizzas is what makes this place the best place for pizza in San Francisco.  You know without a doubt, this man is going to put a little love and a lot of care into making the absolute best product! \nIt was so good, I convinced my wife to walk back for a second time on our short Vacation to try his slow roasted pork sandwich and fresh made Caesar  made.....OUTSTANDING!!!!   I wish I could remember the name of the sandwich, but it was Fabulous!!!!!   \nAJ and his Fiance Amber(who we met later, she was shopping for the ingredients for the day) are simply wonderful people who are passionate about their craft!  It shows in their attitude and their FOOD!!!!", "author": "Steve B."}
