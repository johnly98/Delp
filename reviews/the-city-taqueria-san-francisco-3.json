It is not big from the outside and very narrow inside, but it is long with surprisingly a good amount of seating and dining area.\n\nFrom the newly-installed digital menu, the prices are just as competitive as anywhere else. I ordered the Grilled steak super burrito for $10.00, which is the average price. You place your order through the chefs in the very back, who cooks and grill your meat and tortillas right in front of you. Basically, you know and visualize your meat are cooked fresh.  All the other condiments are colorful and separated in another part of the kitchen. You have to like that for freshness.\n\nThe chef knows how to grilled the meat to perfection. The steak was very flavorful without being overly-burnt. The super burrito has a perfect amount of the condiments. The melted cheese was very sharp. Sour cream was not excessive. The guacamole was green. And the hot salsa was a nasal-opener. \n\nI don't go to that part of Divisadero Street often. But the burrito is just as good as any. And yes, I also liked the name. I am a big fan.", "author": "Matt G."}

San Francisco is known for our burritos. The are second to best to real Mexican AUTHENTIC food. Now there are many different types of burritos from; tradition Mexican, sushi burritos, candy burritos, ramen burritos, nann burritos, and the list goes on. \n\nHowever there is one place in particular that has the best burritos ever! Hands down, there are no comparison. Ocean Taqueria, which changed their name most recently to The City Taqueria. Is located on Divisadero. I had very easy access to this dive, because I went to school about 4 blocks away!\n\nWhen you first walk in, you kind of have a sketchy feeling, because you have to walk all the way in the back of the restaurant to order. You can get burritos, tacos, enchiladas, nachos, tostada, quesadillas, or their plates. You get to choose what meat you want, what kind of tortilla, and whatever else you want in it. The staff their are VERY FRIENDLY. I really like going there because they do make you feel welcomed. \n\nEvery time I go to The City Taqueria, I always order a Carne Chile Verde burrito. I ask for a spinach tortilla (because I always think it's somewhat healthier in my mind, when probably there isn't a huge difference) and add lettuce, Chile Verde, sour cream, cheese, and rice. I would have asked for guacamole but, I'm allergic to avocados (what a stupid allergy). Their carne is so well cooked that the meat is so flaky and its the kind where you don't need a knife to pull it apart. It just kind of crumbles on its one. \n\nPart of why I like The City Taqueria so much, is that it holds memories for me, being able to go after school or during lunch with my friends, and then sitting down eating our burritos and talking, was something I cherish doing with my friends. Note: When I usually go I also tip them because this is actually the second one, but the first one closed down, and I don't want this one to go either!\n\nCheck out my profile to find my official blogs as well as more food reviews", "author": "Food G."}

Individual crunchy pieces, not a speck of gristle, then the happy ending:  Soup-like meat juices settle into the burrito base, drip down your hand as you try to eat, plop on your paper plate and are there to be blotted up with remaining tortilla bits.  Not all carne asada burritos end this way but the best of them do.  \n\nMy burrito included pinto beans, fajita veggies, pico de gallo, hot salsa, and rice.

I've had the carnitas and pollo asado and both were tasty. The meat is done on a flat top grill and they throw in onions and peppers if you like.

I also have yet to find a burrito that truly meets my southern California standards for Mexican food, and several jaunts into the Mission have left me feeling disgruntled.\n\nWhen my coworker Caleb and I decided to go have lunch, he nixed my idea of going to the neighborhood Korean place so we could check out the waitress that our supervisor's been crushing on, although not for that reason - he just didn't want Korean food.  He then brought up the idea of burritos, so off we went, and we found parking pretty easily.\n\nWe both got a grilled chicken super burrito, which basically had a whole mess of things: freshly-grilled-on-the-spot chicken, onions, and peppers, rice, your chocie of beans (black or refried), pico de gallo, sour cream, mild, medium or hot sauce, guacamole, more types of salsa, and lettuce.  Wrap this all in a huge flour tortilla and you get an instantly happy stomach.\n\nI think the freshly-grilled chicken and peppers made the difference here - it added so much flavor, and it wasn't overwhelmed by the sauces or sour cream.

Good thing I was the only one there that Saturday afternoon, so the guy manning the grill was super patient. He asked me what I wanted and since I didn't know, I just said everything in my super burrito. He grilled the carne asada, onions and green peppers on the spot, so you know it's fresh. Everything including shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and all of the salsas. You can tell him if you don't want spicy, but everyone who knows me, knows I love my spicy food and spicy salsa is no exception.\n\nI walked home with the burrito. Usually when I walk home with an El Burrito Express burrito, it's cold. No, not this burrito from Ocean Taqueria. It was hot, the veggies were still a bit crunchy and the juice from the carne asada is running down the burrito and onto the plastic bag. So satisfying, considering this isn't the mission or SD.

Every single year I end up losing our annual NCAA tournament pool and it's me who gets stuck with the lunch tab. Lucky for me they are both men of simple tastes and usually a simple Taqueria will do.\n\nUpon arriving on Divisidero we attempted to lunch at Burrito Express, but the line was a mile long and were three hungry soles who needed a fast remedy and take care of our low blood sugar issue. Just a few short steps away is Ocean Taqueria. We walked in and found plenty of open seats and a much shorter line. \n\nIf you go, make sure to follow the rules and get in the right line. As you walk towards the cash register there are two lines, one to pay and one to order. The confusing part is you encounter the pay line first, but you quickly learn that you must proceed to the back to order.\n\nThe menu is exactly what you would expect from a casual Taqueria. Burritos, quesadillas and nachos everywhere. All you really need to decide on is if you want the \"Super\" size or the \"Regular\". Both of my ex coworkers went with the \"Super carne asada burrito\" with everything and I went with the \"Regular carne asada quesadilla\". The assembly line for your order is right in front of you and the burrito/quesadilla guy lays your tortilla out in front and asks which fillings you would like. There are plenty to choose from, rice, different kinds of salsas, guacamole and three kinds of beans (whole, re fried and black). Both of my friends went with the works.\n\nWhen it came time for my quesadilla to be assembled, the counter guy asked what I would like. I was little confused in that usually a quesadilla is just cheese (and the carne asada as I had requested). I responded with just the cheese please. He then rolled it up rather than laying it flat and it just looked a cheese burrito. I don't know about you, but I prefer my quesadillas flat.\n\nMy quesadilla wasn't bad, but it was little soggy and did not like eating wrapped up in foil. It wasn't very \"cheesy\" nor did the tortilla sing to me with flavor. I ate half as I lost interest fairly quickly and figured I would save my caloric intake for dinner. \n\nOverall I came away unimpressed and probably would go elsewhere.

I work as a retail/food service supervisor, and such an addition does not warrant an extra charge of $1.50, considering that the cheese comes in a 3LB bag, and is a very cheap, processed item, not high quality in the least bit (I would know, I order the stuff for my company). \nSo after all that, the cashier tries to make me agree to a $7.21 sale, I still won't back down, he talks to his co-worker in Spanish, assuming he is berating me in a tongue I do not understand, we settle on an even $6.50 and I leave. The conduct of the staff here is just plain and simply bad and dishonest business, and I will never come back. I advise anyone who plans on going here to be very specific with what they order. Do not let them tack on extra costs, thinking that you are another yuppie from the neighborhood who makes \"so much\" that another few dollars and cents doesn't faze you.", "author": "Sean R."}

It's a very \"Soup-nazi\" like atmosphere they have going on. You quickly give the guy behind the counter your order and when they ask you what kind of meat, veggies, etc, you want on your burrito, quesadilla, taco, etc. you better answer quickly (like 1 or 2 nanoseconds) and don't ask any questions or you'll get a surly stare. \n\nThere isn't anything from here that stands out. I take that back actually...they do have good guac. It's not the real thick Chevy's-style table-side kind, it's a little bit runnier, but I wouldn't call it runny (make sense?). I've had burritos with grilled chicken and carne, as well as quesadilla's with the same meats and everything has been pretty bland (this goes for the beans and rice as well). \n\nThe food here is a little cheaper than The Little Chihuahua or The Green Chile Kitchen (and it should be), but more expensive than El Burrito Express (and it shouldn't be). They never give you chips, with your food and I didn't realize until seeing another review here it's because they charge two bucks for them. What a joke! \n\nLike others have mentioned the place isn't that clean or really that nice looking, but that I don't mind. In fact, places like this usually have really good food, which makes the fact the Ocean Taqueria doesn't that much more disappointing...", "author": "George A."}

I said hell yeah! it was yummy and moist, after standing in the Giants parade for hours anything was good. Oh, I've seen this before but not a fan, lettuce in the burrito, uh I don't like. I also got the watermelon fresca, not too sweet, on the money! The guy said sip some and I'll give you more, Hell yeah! Only one downfall, uhh I want free chips! No bueno.", "author": "Karen T."}

A little hole in the wall place that looks slightly intimidating but instead is very inviting and friendly. They grill the tortilla, which I prefer, and they grill the meat on order. They ask you if you want onions and peppers (say YES!). Now my review is for a Super Baby Steak burrito but I imagine everything else is just as good. And yes, you want everything on it. Now I am not a fan of goopy burritos but I make an exception here because it is so flavorable and I love slurping up the juices. The burritos still manages to be tightly rolled and you get a bag of tri-colored chips. I love my Mission taquerias but this place is a front runner for Best in the City.", "author": "Marguerite E."}

So, on my way back to my car, I saw this place was open and decided a burrito can't be that bad.\n\nI walked in and the guys were very nice and it was kind of awkward because they kept speaking to me in Spanish even though I kept answering in English!  I don't know much Spanish at all so was surprised that I even knew enough to get by yesterday.  They were asking me more than just whether or not I wanted cheese or not, but whether I was eating at home and all kinds of stuff.  Either way, I got by!\n\nAs I was watching them make my burrito, everything was runny.  It looked like everything had water added to it.  The guac, the beans, the sour cream - all  very runny.  They put very little rice on, very little beans, very little sour cream and a bunch of pork which I was semi afraid of eating because it looked more like pork flavored product than actual pork.  So I get a very empty burrito for 8 bucks.\n\nThis is the only time that I have been here, but I don't think I will waste money trying it again.  Yes, my place is closed on Sundays so if I am really craving a burrito on a Sunday, I will just head to one of the other hundreds of Taquerias in this city.  This place is sooo not worth it and completely didn't satiate my craving.", "author": "M M."}

Congratulations on expanding your turf--too bad you couldn't come up with a better name this time, either.\n\nI mean, c'mon, it's not like restaurants named after streets have the type of brand recognition and reputation that would be worth leveraging.\n\nThat aside, I really thought I would never go to this Ocean Taqueria.  El Burrito Express on Divisadero is just so good that I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.  And the one time I went to Ocean Taqueria on Ocean, I wasn't impressed, though I don't remember it being bad either.\n\nThen today I ran 15 miles and I was craving a burrito, but El Burrito Express failed me: they are closed on Sunday.  I was disappointed, but I figured Ocean Taqueria would seize this opportunity to gain some business on their competitor's off-day, and I was right.  As it turns out, they offer a Jumbo Burrito for $9.50.  I had to have it.\n\nThe Jumbo Burrito is delicious and the main reason you need to go to Ocean Taqueria the next time you are starving.

Compared to the taqueria two stores down (El Burrito Express), there is NO reason to come here. None! If you are sitting down wondering what burrito place to go to in the neighborhood, GO TO EL BURRITO EXPRESS! Why is that? Well what makes a great burrito?\n\nFirst of all, all great burritos have their tortillas GRILLED, preferably on both sides. Burrito Express does this, Ocean doesn't. They steam theirs and the tortilla is soggy and sticks to your teeth. Blah.\n\nTwo, meats. Though you might be fooled by the fact that Ocean throws their meat on the grill when you order it, don't be! It's bland and tough.\n\nEven spread and heat. Your burrito should have its contents evenly spread throughout the burrito and both Express and Ocean do this. But the big difference is heat. Express's burritos are always warm and retain their heat through out the meal. Ocean's burritos are lukewarm at best and by the time your done, cold.\n\nNext, size. For slightly more (as in about 50 cents more) you can get a burrito at Express much much larger than the puny, tasteless burritos at Ocean.\n\nService can be sketchy at ocean. Sometimes they're really nice with no problems, at other times they're rude, condescending, and misogynistic. I NEVER get that at El Burrito Express.\n\nOk ok, there is ONE reason to come to Ocean. That would be Sunday's. Express ISN'T OPEN ON SUNDAYS! What the hell!? The BEST day for a burrito, after a night of Saturday drinking, I crave, I starve for a good burrito the next day and I'm stuck with crappy Ocean. \n\nSomeone should tell Catholics (I'm a former member) that on the Sabbath, God didn't just rest, he ate a burrito and how would he feel if his favorite neighborhood burrito place was closed?

I know the owner, and pretty much the whole staff at the other place. I lived near by and went to SFSU which is down the street.\n\nAnyways, I went to the Divisadero location and I ordered a regular burrito, and he asked again if i wanted cheese, I said no. The guy who filled the condiments and ran the register was taking his sweet time filling our order.\n\nI get to the register and was paying for both my friend and my burrito. The rings mine up as a super burrito. I mention to him I ordered a regular and didn't ask for cheese, guacamole, or sour cream. \n\nHe gave me a smug look, put the burrito behind him on the counter, and then went to fill other people's order.\n\nAt this point I was confused, the guy never said anything to me, or tried to talk to me. He mentioned something to the cook and then ignored me. I couldn't believe it, eventually I sat down with my friend as he ate his burrito. I think/hope they will remake it because I paid for both at that point, but didn't have my food.\n\nFinally after taking 4 people's order, waiting about another 10 minutes, I am extremely starving at this point. They remake the burrito and call me over to get it, but never asked me exactly what I wanted. \n\nObviously at this point, I'm pretty irritated, so I quickly rip the burrito in half to check what they put in it. They forgot onions and peppers, spicy sauce, and habanero. I go over and ask the cook and try to talk to him, he shrugs and doesn't say much, but the guy who ran the register/condiments, calls me a \"Puta\", grabs my plate and pushes the burrito off into the trash. Then walks over to the register and starts pulling money out and puts it out on the counter. \n\nOnce I got the money back, before I did anything I'd regret, I told my friend lets go, and got a burrito next door. \n\nI'm always one to give a place a second or third chance, but the previous times I've gone, they don't make the burritos correctly as the original location does.

I went to High School 3 blocks from here and it was a weekly routine to make the journey to Ocean for lunch. Whether it was the tacos or the burritos, I always left satisfied. My favorite thing on the menu is the Grilled Chicken super burrito. They grill the chicken right in front of you, guaranteeing its freshness. Their guacamole is incredible as well and if you dare, try a spicy pepper or two, they are well worth the pain!\nThe Staff is incredibly nice and while they almost only speak spanish, if you can speak some of the language they will love you for trying. They have given myself and my friends great deals over the years due to being such great customers and you can tell they really appreciate their customers. After leaving San Francisco for college and coming back 2 years later, the staff immediately remembered me and gave me a warm welcoming, chatting me up about live at school. \nOver all I love this place and while it looks like a bit of a hole in the wall, its food more than speaks for itself and my friends and I always come hungry, and leave in pure bliss.", "author": "Colin T."}

It's a long narrow restaurant where you have to walk all the way to the back to order your food. On the way, there's a few tables and shabby interior design. When you get to the ordering station, the dim lights overhead help to disguise the meager offerings of your standard Mexican fare. When I went in at lunch hour, the beans and other condiments in the steam table were down to half and judging by the crusty line of dried goop on the sides of the containers, I assumed the food had just been put away the night before and pulled out for service that day, without refilling.\n\nI continued to order a beef burrito. When the cook rolled it up, it was small. The smallest burrito I have ever had in San Francisco. I think I even had a bigger burrito at Taco Bell! When I asked for chips, the cashier said it was extra. Well fine, I'll pay 50 cents for chips. Then I asked for some hot sauce or salsa for the chips. He gave me an embarrassed look as if to say the salsa was going to cost me more too. Luckily, he caught the hint and threw in the salsa for free. \n\nThe burrito lacked flavor. Plus, I was paranoid that I'd catch something or get sick from the unappetizing ingredients. \n\nIn this town, to compete with the dozens of other taquerias you'd better cook up a nice fat burrito that's fresh and satisfies a lunch craving, not just a kid's sized burrito for a snack.

The guy making my burrito obliged me when I said I only wanted a little rice. Nice. He seemed to think I wanted only a little of everything else also because the burrito was SMALL! Not nice. The guy behind the register wasn't cooking anything but was wearing a chef's hat that had pickles wearing santa hats on it. Nice. He did not offer me complimentary chips but instead shoved a handful of peppermints in my bag. Not nice. I am polite and wish the staff a good day and walk back to work to enjoy my lunch. Good thing I wasn't very hungry because I finished the whole thing in about five bites. The burrito was seriously lacking flavor. I wanted to put salt on it but I thought that would just be so wrong.

I could head north and grab some \"Mexican\" food at Left at Albuquerque's but today I was craving an authentic burrito at a place without pictures adorning a shiny plastic menu.\n\nThe closest places I could find were Ocean Taqueria and El Burrito Express, not 3 doors away from each other on the same block of Divisadero.  On a side note, apparently there's an unspoken ban on authentic Mexican food between (but not including) Divisadero and Polk St.... much to my dismay.  \n\nAfter eyeballing El Burrito and Ocean, I figured Ocean was more authentic and headed in.  Hearing far more Spanish being spoken than English, I was already satisfied with its authenticity.  The menu was written with black magic marker on a plain white wall... perfect!  I ordered my burrito and was able to select my ingredients while the chef was making it (a la Freebirds).  I love places like this for two reasons:\n\n1) You make sure you get what you want\n2) As soon as you're done ordering, the burrito is ready\n\nI quickly paid for my burrito (not super cheap, but very moderately priced) and sat down to enjoy.  Here's where I'll stop blowing sunshine up the ass of this Taqueria.  The burrito was good, and I'll definitely come back for another, but not the best I've ever had.  I like a fairly healthy burrito (no sour cream, cheese, guac, etc), but I also like a lot of flavor; again, it was good, but not great.\n\nAnyway, I gave this place 4 stars, partly due to my craving of the day, partly due to the authenticity and partly due to the scarcity of such a burrito place near my house.  If there were a dozen burrito joints near my place and this was just one of them, this would get 3 stars.\n\nBottom line - I was glad I made the trip and will definitely come back.", "author": "Pete S."}

I was brought to the ocean taq on ocean street in my first month and had well basically the best asada burrito I've ever eaten. Fast forward another month and I found this ocean on Divis. The burrito here tasted exactly the same! \n\nThe 5 star rating here is definitely  for the food, All taquerias are crap holes on the inside and if its not then its really just a chain business owned place attempting to capture that \"south of the border charm.\" I almost never eat in them anyway. So lets get to the food. How it works has been described pretty well here.  I love that they grill the meat right in front of you. You know it hasn't been pre-cooked, boiled in a bag and shoved under a heat lamp all day. They have a huge selection of tortillas and the way you get to pick everything you want in the burrito as its being constructed is genius.  One word of caution if you get everything including the hot sauce the burrito will be very liquidy and run down your arm. I usually skip the hot sauce or have them put very little on.  The super is the burrito to get, if you get a baby and start adding items that it doesn't come with, your charged for them and might as well have gotten the super anyway. The nachos are also the best I've had, everything that goes in the burrito goes on top of the chips after the cheese gets melted on. The prices are a little spendy (for a taqueria) but I think its worth it. I shouldn't be eating burritos all the time anyway. The staff are always very friendly however if you try to go there in the hour before closing you might get greeted with a locked door or them telling you they are already closed so don't always count on a quick late night run there.", "author": "Chris D."}

(Everything else looks great too, but I've never been able to not order a super burrito.) I love that they grill the chicken right in front of you when you order and throw bell peppers and onions onto the grill too if you'd like. I'll give it that the decor is not the best, but for a $7 super burrito, what do you expect?", "author": "KK R."}

Though the food is ok the experience isnt recommended. I would say avoid the place and head to Tortilla Heights.", "author": "Morgan T."}

Its not fancy, heck the menu is on a plywood, but I go in there thinking 'i just need a good burritto' and i've never been disappointed.", "author": "S B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-12", "description": "I've always had very good burritos here. They grill your meat when you order...and they throw the tortilla on so that it gets nice and crispy. Salsa is tasty. The chips and guac are okay...nothing special. As other reviewers mentioned...the place doesn't have the greatest ambiance but I think its worth it for the fresh burritos.", "author": "Melissa M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "i've spent a long time, years probably, pondering what/where the best burrito is.  hands down, the best is at ocean.  i can honestly say that this is the yummiest burrito i've ever tasted.  i crave it like candy.  it's made to order, fresh, delicious, and huge.  the marinade they put on their grilled chicken is amazing.  the staff is awesome too, they always say \"see you manana?\" and they usually will.", "author": "alexis w."}
