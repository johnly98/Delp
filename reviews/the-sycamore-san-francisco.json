My friend and I stood at the front waiting to order for about five minutes before they turned away and asked us what we wanted. Even then, it took a while for them to get their point of sale system working properly and swipe my credit card.\n\nThere's some really cool dishes on the menu, including the trademark pork belly donuts. I accepted my fate of a sugar overload and got a plate of those plus a blackberry cider, which was quite refreshing on a sunny day. It was freakishly sunny when we dined there -- large groups were hogging the umbrellas and we had to squeeze past several parties to even find a seat at the end of the picnic table. We were so far in the back that our server almost didn't see us when she brought out our chicken and waffle and donuts.\n\nThe food is classic rich brunch fare, albeit done in smaller, manageable portions. Pork belly donuts are delicious, like tempura batter filled with tender, fatty meat. When paired with their light maple syrup, it makes for a filling meal. My friend really enjoyed his fried chicken and waffle, even though it was much smaller than he thought it'd be. Dishes were generally affordable -- about $16 for the donuts and drink.\n\nWe enjoyed our brews -- they have a giant drink menu and there's something for everyone, even those who prefer non-alcoholic beverages. There's also a bunch of board games you can borrow, which makes it an appealing place to sit and eat for a while. My problem is that there's so many people who spend too long there -- we had trouble finding a seat because other parties were hanging out with their empty mimosa pitchers, and the staff knew them all so they were allowed to stay for ages after they'd finished. I, on the other hand, left with no regrets and no intentions to come back.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I came in for lunch on a Saturday since I was in the Mission District, and it was fairly busy but not packed at that time. I tried:\n\n-Pork Belly \"Donuts\" w/Maple Syrup & Makers Mark Glaze (3/$7.75, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9rt6k4XYCUzbbH7GRBv-nw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Interesting concept, but the pork belly pieces had way too much fat (even for me, and I love pork belly fat). I was also expecting the pieces to be crunchy and the donuts more solid/cake like. However, the donuts were more on the doughy side. I wouldn't get this again.\n-Sycamore's Famous Roast Beef ($9.25, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lk7pLO8TUivp7SMyiZ98Xw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): We got the sandwich with mayo and sauce, and they definitely put a lot of both on. The sauce was like a tangy BBQ sauce, and I'm not sure how well both went with the sandwich. The bread was also too soft to support all the beef and sauce, and got soggy really quickly- skip!\n\nService was ok- not great but fairly attentive. Overall, the food wasn't very good, but I would return here for drinks. The drink prices seem very reasonable, and they have a large variety and quantity of beers on draft.

I'm used to imbeciles stumbling around the subject of my race because of my brown hair and blue eye (heterochromia, so yes just one), but that doesn't mean I won't call people out.\n\nHere's how it went. He told me my name was confusing, or that he couldn't say it or something. So I responded with, \"Oh, it's Pirouz Mehmandoost, yeah it's a Persian name\" (just FYI, Persian is an ethnicity, Iranian is a nationality). So he responded with, \"Oh, I've seen worse.\" So y'all know where I'm gonna go with this already- I replied saying, \"Well I don't think of names as being better or worse, but yeah... it's ethnic if that's what you mean.\" He segued by saying that he has an Indian surname but he isn't Indian, and I clearly didn't give a shit at that point. I tipped as I normally would for an 8 buck bar bill and said \"thanks, have a good day,\" because in the end I know that people are more likely than not to treat anyone in a service profession like they are not human.... so why would I care?

We ordered the Salmon Benedict and Chicken & Waffles (the fact that it was stuffed with ham and cheese was simply irresistible). The waffle was rather stale and not fluffy at all and the portion of chicken was on the measly side, but the flavor was good. The Salmon Benedict was tasty and the pineapple from the Eggs Benedict was very sweet and juicy.

A waitress accosted us as we were looking for seating and threatened to kick us out and blacklist us from ever returning - all because my friend thought a waitress handed her a pitcher of mimosa. Hello, it was bottomless, not crazy to think they'd give you the pitcher so they don't have to keep refilling? My friend immediately apologized and the waitress CONTINUED being so unbelievably rude. She was sarcastic, didn't accept my friends apology, and went looking for different waiters to see who had \"handed\" us the pitcher. We were in shock. Never have I ever been in a restaurant with such terrible customer service. We went back to the bar, and immediately asked for our order to be cancelled and to be refunded. Another waitress did so, but not before grabbing the mimosas out of our hands and aggressively dumping them out, WHILE ROLLING HER EYES. I said that we didn't appreciate being spoken to that way by the other waitress, and got no response. So we walked out.

You have to order them at the bar first and then the staff comes around often to refill your cup. I swear I couldn't even finish my cup before they came around again. lol. \n\nLocation wise it's convenient to get here since it's only a 3 min walk from 16th mission BART. The place itself is quite cramped though. They have a few tables inside and about 3 picnic tables in the back. We got here around 11AM and it was already packed and by 11:30 people had to stand as they waited for a table. FAIR WARNING: This place only has 1 bathroom so the line can get pretty long, especially when everyone's sipping on those mimosas.\n\nTBH, I thought the food was pretty mediocre. The food menu is pretty simple, but they had their own twist to the items What we got: \n\n- Pork belly doughnuts ($5.75): I was excited to try this but it was too salty for my taste. It's supposed to have a maple glaze on it but it was basically just covered in plain syrup. These had a nice texture/crunch but they were lacking with how much pork belly was in it. \n\n- Salmon Benedict ($14): My friend and I ended up splitting this dish but I couldn't even finish my half. The dish tasted waaaay too vinegary and overpowered all the other ingredients in the dish. The home fries and fruit it came with were tasty though. \n\n- Chicken & Waffles (double for $10.75): My favorite dish of the 3 we got. The dish comes with 2 small pieces of chicken on top, but I though the chicken was overcooked. The waffles had a nice crunch on the outside, but once I tried to cut it the waffle basically split right down the middle where the ham/cheese was. It had a nice balance with the saltiness of the ham and sweetness of the syrup. \n\nOverall I would come back here again just for the bottomless mimosas since it's a steal compared to other places & they don't limit you to just 2 hours.

The waffles had cheese and bruschetta in the middle, that's what caught my eye! When I bit into the waffle, it was hard and burnt. The chicken was literally really small, considering it was the half order, the chicken was also really dry... My friend had ordered the carnitas eggs benedict, but instead of having a poached egg, she had her eggs scrambled. She let me have more than a few bites of hers since she was too full.

Found The Sycamore with their awesome price of $8 bottomless mimosas (with order of entree), and decided to check it out. \n\nI didn't know that you had to seat yourself, so I apologize to the two ladies from Portland who I walked passed to look for a host/hostess. I didn't realize that there wasn't any, and that you were first in line for a table. \n\nWe didn't have to wait outside in the rain too long for a table. We saw fried chicken and waffles when we sat down, and ordered that with bottomless mimosas. You have to order and pay at the bar, which is why it's important to make sure you get a table. \n\nThe food came out quickly to my surprise. And it is the best fried chicken I have ever had. I can't think of another fried chicken dish that's come close! The chicken was boneless, very crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy on the inside. I'm in awe that it wasn't dry. I assume they brined it for a long time to retain its moisture. The waffles were made with manchego cheese and prosciutto inside. So at first, you see two pieces of chicken and a lot of waffles (with the larger portion option) and it feels like the chicken-waffle ratio is off. But it's actually just right because of the cheese and prosciutto inside the waffle, otherwise having more chicken would be too much. I will be dreaming of this chicken tonight! \n\nThe bottomless mimosas were mostly champagne with a touch of orange juice, which is the best way to make mimosas in my opinion! I was very happy at the end of the meal. \n\nThe Mission is usually sunny, and I would've enjoyed eating this meal outside.  But we were there on a rainy day. The dining area is small, and it's on a slope, so we had to level out the table with some napkins so it would stop tipping to one side. \n\nI like the divey atmosphere, especially in contrast to the ultra-modern, hipster-industrial look that many brunch places have. It's nice to just grab a bite to eat your local bar full local art and a jukebox.  Oh, which by the way, played awesome music that included Beck, and some 90s alternative. I really want to come back for another bottomless mimosas brunch to try out the sliders.", "author": "Vira P."}

My friend and I a reservation for 16 people for her birthday brunch on Sunday, about a month before. The restaurant called a couple days before to confirm, and I said yes, 16 people.\n\nI got there were with my friend at 10:50 so we could get set up for an 11am reservation. We arrived to find out they put us at an 8 person bench table, next to a party of 10. There was legitimately no way we could all fit there. I went up to the waitstaff and said \"there's no way we're all going to fit here.\" His response: \"yeah, you're right\" ....... Okay dude, well do something about it!!!!\n\nHe said \"let me know when the rest of your party arrives\" went inside, and then did not come back out. A few minutes later, when it was 11:00am and our party was there, I went back inside and asked him what we were going to be doing. He didn't really have an answer, so I suggested that he ask another party at a more open corner area if they could switch with us. He seemed very annoyed at me for asking, but HELLO, it was 100% the restaurants fault that they did not give us the space we needed for our reservation. A few minutes later, he came outside and asked 3 people to move from the corner, table, which they very kindly did. Unfortunately, there was another group of 3 people also sitting at the corner table, who were not getting up and moving. So after 5 minutes of our party awkward crowding around the area, I had to go BACK inside and ask the waiter if he could please ask those people to move. It was not my responsibility to ask them myself, as it was the restaurants fault that they messed up our reservation and therefore their responsibility to fix it.\n\nThe waiter, again very annoyed with me said \"give me a few minutes,\" as if I was being an inconvenience to him. He was never apologetic at how much the restaurant had fucked up our reservation, and was not trying very hard to reconcile it. At this time, it was around 11:30, meaning 30 minutes after our reservation had begun, and we were not yet sitting down. Finally he came out and asked the people if they would move, and they said they would when they were done, but then didn't..... We eventually just had to sit down with them so we could start ordering, and they awkwardly stayed there for about 45 minutes longer. \n\nThe most unfortunate part of this experience was that the food was actually pretty good (I got the roast beef sandwich and tried the salmon Benedict), but because of the horrible service and experience, I would never come back and strongly discourage others from coming back as well.", "author": "Jenna G."}

She decided to do brunch at The Sycamore on Saturday, April 30th. She showed up right at 10:30am when they open to grab a spot in the back patio. I was a little delicate from the night before, so I didn't show up until around 11:45am.\n\nOne of the reasons she chose The Sycamore was their Bottomless Mimosas ($14 with $8 food order). I wasn't sure if I could drink right then and there, but I actually felt better after having a sip. It's all premixed, so unfortunately you can't control the amount of OJ in the drink. I'm normally not a huge fan of too much juice, but that day, it was okay. They come around with pitchers throughout brunch time to refill your cups, so you're never empty for too long. Since you need to order food in order to get the bottomless, I got the Country Scramble ($13.25): Sausage, Bacon, Mushroom, Sharp Cheddar & Country Gravy. It was good and comforting, but I couldn't really stomach much food at the time.\n\nIt can be a little confusing as to where you place your order, but just go to the front bar and place your order there. One of the reasons my gf picked this spot was there's no need to split checks. Everyone just goes up front, orders their own food and pays for it. Good spot for big parties as it takes away from needing to split checks.\n\nSo I'd probably give them 4 stars except the bathroom situation is ridiculous. They only have one bathroom for the whole restaurant! Combine bottomless mimosas with one bathroom (for both men and women) and you have a ridiculous line. I almost didn't want to drink too much since I'd have to wait forever for the bathroom! Maybe it's a ploy so people don't take advantage of the bottomless, but they should at least have two bathrooms.\n\nFour stars, but minus one for the lack of restrooms.", "author": "Elena N."}

I got the eggs benedict, which was really yummy, but also I feel like is pretty standard and hard to mess up. The bar snacks are delicious! We got the fries (seasoned perfectly - enough but not too much), mac and cheese fritters (the best thing we ordered - that jalapeno is just too good), kale dip, and the artichoke. We ended up getting a second order of fries. Portions were decent too, which was nice as we were splitting the items among 5 colleagues. Each item was ~$6-9, which was what I expected. \n\nService: Brunch was super busy, and full of drunk, obnoxious people. I recommend being prepared for that kind of scene. Staff seemed to be doing the best they could. Coming for happy hour was a really pleasant experience. The bartender was really sweet and helpful, even accommodating a specific request I had regarding payment for our order. \n\nNote: you order both food and drinks at the bar, they don't take your order at the table. Convenient for splitting checks. Not sure how they know where the food goes, but they do which is awesome!\n\nDrinks: Extensive beer menu with quite a few on tap. Got to try a few new things which was nice. The bottomless mimosas were actually $16. They come around to refill often enough for our table. I was typically empty already but my friends weren't so it appears to be a personal problem (oops.. lol).\n\nThe patio out back is nice with lots of seating, and you can also smoke there.

Was very excited for The Sycamore since it was to be my first brunch experience in San Fran. Came away with mixed feelings. Its a cozy little place in Mission which was packed because of the lovely weekend weather. They have some seating facing the street in the front and a patio at the back. The patio was bursting at the seams and we were lucky to commandeer the only empty table in the front.\n\nThe decor was interesting, sofas combined with mismatched chairs gave it a cool, rustic sort of appearance. They had only 1 bathroom which was kind of a pain because the place was jam packed. Regular American brunch fare at prices that I suppose are par for the course in SFO. You can add bottomless mimosas for a little bit extra.\n\nThe food itself was quite good, I had a veggie burger which hit the spot and everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal as well. The service was very sub par. Firstly, the food took reallllly long to come out (which I can understand since they were packed). However, the guy who was to be replenishing our supposedly bottomless mimosas was nowhere to be found for the most part. We kept having to go to the bar for refills which seemed to annoy the bartender who rudely instructed us to wait on the missing mimosa man. When said missing mimosa man finally showed up, he tried to show off some pouring skills but ony succeeded in pouring the drinks onto the table and down someone's pants, instead of into the glasses. The guy was either completely wasted or just incredibly bad at his job. 3 stars because the food was good and the vibe was chill but they need to up their service game.\n\nBreakdown:\nFood - 4/5\nSetting - 3/5\nDrinks - 3/5\nService - 2/5", "author": "Varun D."}

In the front of the restaurant are a few tables, but there is an outdoor space that has much more seating. I would recommend coming with a part of 6 or less. I had 6 and it was more than difficult to find seating. One thing I liked about The Sycamore is that you order at the bar and just go find a seat, which means you don't have to worry about splitting the check with frands or family. \n\nBottomless Mimosas are 14 dollars (w/ purchase of an entree that is $8 or more). I would have to say that it was worth it since they were always quick to fill our cups. The food on the other hand was mediocre at best. Here are my thoughts! \n\nBreakfast Chicken Slider - Chicken was nice and crispy, but my friends kept telling me how salty it was! Maybe I was a tad buzzed, but I didn't believe them until I kept eating it. I am hoping it was just the batch they had made.\n\nFried Egg Slider - Same as the breakfast chicken, the biscuit for this was way too salty. The egg yolk was nice and runny though. If it weren't for the biscuit, they paired nicely with the mimosas. \n\nBiscuit & Gravy - Very heavy and thick! I think if you want something filling, this would be a good option to get as well. Nothing too special, but of course the mimosas made it decent.\n\nOverall, this place is a great option to get bottomless mimosas.

Then 20 minutes later, 1 other dish arrived - weird, usually they try to bring all orders at the same time, but ok.. \n\nThen nothing. FOR HOURS. \n\nWe were a bunch of friends who hadn't seen each other in awhile so even though we were hungry, we didn't mind the delay at first because we were just catching up. But at some point we realised that there's gotta be something going on. All of the other tables were getting restless as well. \n\nAround 12:30 or so a friend of ours went inside to check and saw our waiter screaming at someone telling him to 'get the f*** out' - so he refrained from asking about our order. There seemed to be no point anyway since it was obvious that it wasn't because they forgot, the kitchen was simply not making food. We weren't the only table waiting for our order.\n\nAround 1:30pm, the same waiter went out to the patio out to make an announcement basically saying \"your meal is coming, stop asking the bartender, there's a shenanigan going on, we're sorry\" - he didn't go into details about what the shenanigans were about.\n\nFinally around 2 pm - close to 3 hours after we arrived, more of our dishes came out. By the time we left, close to 3pm, my order - a simple fried egg slider - still hasn't come. So I cancelled it.\n\nSo here's the thing. I totally understand that things happen at restaurants. But for the price Sycamore is charging, I was expecting them to handle \"shenanigans\" in classier manner. There was no explanation, no attempt to remedy the situation, no offer for a refund, there was no acknowledgement that we'd been waiting for our food for 3.5 hours. A little explanation of the situation would do much in garnering empathy. Or how about an offer of free mimosas during the 3 hour wait?\n\nI had never received such an abysmal service and was very disappointed - mostly by the way the place handled whatever crisis they were having that day.

We all met back at the patio in back of The Sycamore and enjoyed our meal until a waiter came and said - \"We do not allow food from outside.  Please pit it away.\"  We were almost done eating, so we figured we'd just finish and then leave.  Less than a minute later, the server was back - \"OK, I am doing being a nice guy.  Pack up your food and get out.\"  That's right; he threw us out of the bar.  We had spent $30+ on beer and sliders, and that didn't matter to The Sycamore's waitstaff.  Won't be coming back here any time soon!\n\nFood was mediocre at best.  Fries were well seasoned and tasty, but only one of the three sliders (the lamb one) had any real flavor to it.  The chicken one was deep fried but tasteless and the fish one was flavorless.  Beer selection was reasonable.  Outside patio was OK except for all the pot smoke (it is the Mission though).  Overall, nothing particularly outstanding about this place, and the rude waitstaff is definitely a downer.", "author": "Matthew R.C. Z."}

I've seen this place get PACKED before and my friend and I were just sipping on mimosas for 2 hours before our food came (a bit ridiculous). She didn't give us a full order because they ran out of the chicken and waffles (which are AMAZING) and ended up not charging us for it. \n\nChicken and waffles. Where to begin...?\nManchengo cheese and prosciutto...and heavenly bourbon maple sauce. It's truly amazing. The chicken is not as amazing, but it complements it well. Also, their benedicts are yummy! I've had the carnitas benedict and that was awesome. Also, lamb burger slide and beef slider are better than the chicken, fish sliders. The lamb one is really flavorful. The chicken and fish ones aren't as special but still delish.\n\nCool staff, fun board games. Go for brunch!", "author": "Natalie M."}

Their beer selection is OK, but nothing special. Their food is barely passable. They don't do table service, so you have to up to the bar. This might be fine, except that if you order more that one drink at a time, they make you go get your buddy to come up and show their ID. Then, while half of your friends are up in the drink line, or showing IDs, or waiting in line for the one bathroom, a busboy will come around and bug you about having all this empty space at your table, and how your group should scooch over so that others can sit. \n\nIt's all frustrating, and nothing about this place makes it worth the hassle.

We lost count of how many we had had, because she was there - and for the whole patio, too. Later we saw her running to pick up more OJ, but damn if this woman doesn't deserve a liver-shaped award and a raise.\n\nOk, so for the actual review, as I'm the resident Yelper of my group, even though I live the farthest away I'm the one who has to come up with a plan. Using filters, The Sycamore came up as having a patio AND bottomless mimosas, and that was pretty much our only criteria.\n\nMy friends and I showed up at the perfect time - around 11 where the place wasn't packed inside or outside yet. We went with patio seating, which is in the back space and on very short picnic tables - my friend who is 6'4\" had an interesting time. Fortunately, this is an interesting place.\n\nWhen you walk in, first thing is pretty much the bar which offers a number of draft beer choices (above the bar is a collection of impressive tap handles), and you order at the bar and eventually they will yell your name when your food is ready - be aware, if you have a common name, you might want to change it up (I go with Mordecai). Then, find some seating and enjoy the wonderfully hipster atmosphere with decorated walls, board games, and interesting people (Not sure if performing troupe or just hipsters).\n\nSeeing pork belly donuts on the menu, had to get those. Got two orders of 3 - pork belly surrounded by fried dough, swimming in syrup. Kind of like sweet and sour pork to give you an idea.\n\nAlso got the mix and match sliders: the chicken biscuit and the lamb burger. Both were very tasty (don't forget to grab the sriracha), but actually liked the lamb one better with the Romesco Aioli and Manchego Cheese. \n\nAll of this is excellent hangover cures, though the bottomless mimosas might get you going back.\n\nI would gladly return for the very casual environment, solid food and what I keep raving about.

We were craving some unhealthy brunch grub and endless mimosas, can you blame us?\n\nWhen we walked in, we couldn't help but notice how tiny it was. About 10 tables in the main dining area, a smallish bar and a narrow hallway leading to a smaller patio. We didn't see signs so we lingered a bit only to be barked at by a waitress that its open seating. Due to it being peak brunch time, we opted for the bar. Rookie mistake #1. \n\nWhile I understand what they're looking to accomplish with the \"do everything at the bar\" approach, IMO, it's very poorly executed. I saw people at tables waiting for lengths of time for waiters, questions about the menu that the bartender tended to get frustrated over, etc. I don't think it's fair to throw all responsibility on one bartender for food orders, drinks AND keep bottomless mimosas flowing. \n\nFood: Yelp hyped up the pork belly donuts and I opted for the pulled pork sandwich (fact: you can not overdose on pork. google it). The pork belly donuts... this is what tipped the scale and brought us here. Yelp, I love you all, but ya let me down. I got lots LOTS of batter with a hint of pork, not pork belly. Maybe an off day, but I do know my pork belly and this wasn't it. I had high hopes, and unfortunately it crashed and burned. The saving grace was the pulled pork sandwich....easily one of the best ive had in SF. It was packed with beautifully marinated pork and the bread was nice and soft. This alone would make me come back.\n\nService: again, I feel for the bartender; Drowning in food orders, tap beers and mimosa maintenance. To be fair, It wasn't her fault for the not-so-chipper attitude, because I would be the same if not worse in her position. I can simply fault the restaurant in the operations department.\n\nAmbiance: sardine-like seating in the main dining room and communal-sardine-like on the patio. If you're at the bar, you can either smell the bartenders breath or get bumped into by passers by in the narrow hallway heading outside.\n\nIf you have friends in town and want to show them the \"character\" of the mission in a small window of time, head to sycamore. In this, there will be no disappointment.\n\nAll in all, pulled pork, wonderful beers and bottomless mimosas....  These are a few of my favorite things.", "author": "Ryan L."}

Life's disappointments help us grow stronger--this is in the top 5, or maybe, the biggest one I've ever had.\n\nHow is this problem solved?  Well, it was solved by hanging out in one of the neatest little bars I've ever visited.  The Sycamore is located in a small corner alcove off Mission Street.  When I saw that it had a Dutch door, the top being open on an unseasonably warm afternoon in March, I knew I'd be in love.\n\nThe interior was something out of a storybook--rustic, warm, inviting and magical.  There's a selection of board games to choose from if you want to occupy an afternoon with some friends playing Scattergories or whatever game you happen to choose.  When we walked in it wasn't busy, and despite being out of pork belly donuts we settled on some beers and sat down to enjoy.  Some people were seated to the front finishing up a game and appeared to really be having a good time and enjoying life.\n\nI had a couple PBRs for a couple dollars each and they were served ice cold in cans.  If I lived out here in this neighborhood I could see myself frequently enjoying this place.  One of my friends got a few of their sliders--they have various ones, including lamb and a fried chicken one--and she thought they were great.\n\nI plan to return on my next visit and hope to waste away an afternoon eating pork belly donuts, playing chutes and ladders and sipping on PBR in cans.  This is the stuff dreams are made of--and I can see mine coming true here, at The Sycamore.", "author": "Jared E."}

Sweet + savory = delicious. Sweet + savory + very salty = nope. I wish they didn't stuff the waffles with prosciutto and manchego cheese. Then again, without the structural integrity of the stuffing, the waffle was limp. And the chicken was only 'meh.' It reminded me of chicken that you buy from the frozen section and heat up in an oven, because it lacks that really satisfying crisp outside.\n\nDo order the pork belly donuts - those were amazing! That was exactly the sweet & savory combination I'd been craving. This ended my meal on a positive note.\n\nDo not go on a hot day, unless you can find space outside. They don't use or have A/C and all the windows create a greenhouse effect that was miserable.

After a great meal at a local hot spot, a friend of ours took charge and lead us down Valencia, then down a dark alley and right into The Sycamore. If I didn't know the neighborhood at all, I'd have been a little leary walking in because there's nothing special about the bar area. A small room with dark walls, lots of posters and s*it hanging from the walls, and a narrow, dimly lit hallway at the back. The beer selection is small and succinct, but it's complete and includes everything from lagers to double IPAs, draft and bottle. I settled into a Bombay by Boat IPA from Moonlight Brewing and was whisked down the narrow hallway, which happily opened to a sweet courtyard with rows of picnic bench style seating that encourages you to get friendly with your neighbors.\n\nIt was bingo night, not the blue haired grandma game you're thinking of, but a raunchy, rowdy, and lively game with an awesomely animated caller that looked like Saul Goodman. The other patrons happily invited us to get in on the last game, and in the middle we were all rewarded with free jello shots! It appeared that I missed bingo by one number, but when reading back the winning card, I heard my missing number! Bummer, but it made for an awesome Yelp photo!\n\nI'm definitely the low key, divey, hole in the wall kind of guy, as long as there's good beer and company, and the Mission is home to oh so many good spots. The Sycamore delivered on all fronts, and I was only sad that I had no appetite to enjoy what is supposed to be great food. Next time I'm in SF, I will definitely be back with room to chow down.", "author": "Michael T."}

I wanted to try it, I made it a mission to check this place out before I left SF. \n\nThis local Mission bar is the perfect place for casual date nights, hanging out with friends or if you just want to come by to get some work done on your laptop. Whether you're an 8-5 office geek, hipster or a marathon biker (there were two dudes fully decked out in their gears & helmets dining)- the staff will warmly welcome you with a smile & a pint of beer. \n\nFRANZISKANER HEFE WEISSE ($5): \nNice citrusy finish (I didn't even have to use the lemon like I normally do with most hefes). You can taste the bananas & cloves in this pint of deliciousness!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=pS0P1y4KSDdy8qoS4mQH-w\n\nThe decor of this bar gives off a rocker-ish vibe with it's brightly painted red walls, black furnitures and black & white framed artworks. There's a classy, yet comfortable & unpretentious vibe to this place. \n\nTheir back patio is the area to be. There's a very cool framed artwork on their wall, complete with a flowing waterfall. The owners used picnic tables and tree stump stools to keep with the whole \"sycamore\" theme. \n\nI particularly like the mini private area, located on your left as you enter the back patio. Come early if you wanna snag this spot for your friends.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=NHn3S3epnO2XrugTVKa6dQ\n\nPORK BELLY DONUTS w/MAKERS MARK GLAZE ($4 for 3 donuts):\nIt sounded like a good idea, but the execution & flavors fell short.  \n\nThe beer-braised pork belly just tasted like plain pork belly, no seasonings and I'm missing the salt.\n\nThe beer batter donut was thin, yet it got soggy & greasy REALLY fast. The combination of the greasy batter combined with the melt-in-your mouth pork fat makes every bite heart-clogging & rich. After the first donut, I ate the rest sans the dough. \n\nI didn't get any bourbon taste from the glaze. Just tasted like plain maple syrup.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=VdfAmms0ZEqmjilgDWQjMw\n\nInside shot of the Pork Belly Donuts.

My only complaint was its choice of dinner rolls used for the buns. It wasn't toasted on the outside & was sort of dry.\n\nWe got one of each to sample: ground beef, lamb burger, fried chicken & fried catfish.\nSo stinkin' cute & tastes delicious! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=4qQHRWbH5CP3szyETuzSAQ\n\nBEEF SLIDER:\nThe ground beef is cooked to the right temperature. The roasted garlic aioli wasn't overpowering and provided the right amount of moisture to the bun. The sweet caramelized onions and blue cheese complimented each other really well, and helped bring out the sweetness in the beef. Very juicy, very flavorful.\n\nLAMB BURGER:\nJust as flavorful and juicy as the beef burger. \nThe manchego cheese compliments the lamb very well, there was a peppery bite to it, which I liked very much. The romesco sauce was rather weak & watery. I didn't get the nutty-garlicky tomato flavors much, even though there was a large chunk of tomato on my burger.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=RyqdcI-CfydcAoth5rFmKQ\n\nFRIED CHICKEN BREAST & FRIED COD FISH sliders ($3.50 each):\nOut of all the fried items, the Fried Chicken Breast Slider was my favorite and the Fried Cod Fish slider was a close 2nd. Yep, pork belly donuts was last....  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=VaPWSfbhQor-t152CuJdCg\n\nFRIED CHICKEN SLIDER:\nAt 1st glance, the chicken looks thin & dry but that all goes away when you bite into it. The chicken is crunchy (not at all greasy) and seasoned well. I could eat a few pieces of this without its other components. \n\nThe menu said there was pickled red onions & cole slaw. All we got on ours was a bunch of lettuce and a garlic aioli. Np, since i was willing to eat the tasty chicken all by itself.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=fzpEmD3AY9JScn_cfqKKbQ\n\nFRIED COD SLIDER:\nThe menu & bartender said \"catfish\" but it was cod. It looked & tasted like cod. I hate catfish, it tastes like dirt to me.... and this fish burger didn't taste like catfish. \n\nSame batter used for the pork donuts = soggy greasy mess. Served w/sriracha aioli & house pickles. I wouldn't order this again.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=04IjHZSVKbLfZ88ScE2VOw\n\nCAPRESE SALAD w/basil vinaigrette ($7): \nWe got one healthy item, lol. \nThe mild, soft Bocconcini mozzarella really absorbed the flavors of the tasty vinaigrette.

We found our way to the Sycamore eager to try the much-hyped Pork Belly Donuts with Maple Makers Mark Glaze.  That's right, a pork belly donut, a  combination of two things I love, but not one my heart will approve.  I was actually worried that I might get addicted to those things, because at 3 pieces for $4, they're certainly priced appropriately.  The verdict?  Good but not great, like all other items we tried.  Overall, the Sycamore is a pretty solid spot.\n\nThe pork belly donut was a tale of two cities.  The donut part was amazing...perfectly fried, light, and airy.  The dough had a nice sweetness, and was perfectly complemented by the sea salt.  The pork belly, however, fell short.  I thought it was very bland and not very tender.  Also beware, the donuts actually look much better in photographs.  Still, I think this is an appetizer worth checking out.  If you come in with the right expectations, you'll probably enjoy them.\n\nAlso well above average was the Sycamore Roast Beef Sandwich, supposedly their signature sandwich.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=FCmUPX1c0kGywIO6v4hvHA)\n\nI had it with both the mayo and special sauce...such a hearty and filling sandwich packed with a generous helping of thinly sliced beef.  The meat was warm, juicy, flavorful and tender.  The sauce, however, was a little on the sour side.  I'm not a fan of vinegar-based bbq sauces.  Finally, no complaints about their french fries.  The fries were seasoned properly and fried perfectly.\n\nTo be honest, I've been going back and forth from three to four stars.  I'm settling on a four because the items here are above average and priced fairly, though some adjustments are necessary.", "author": "Angel S."}

They don't take reso's and it is a first come first find a spot kind of joint but it is worth a little elbowing...or table sharing for the food.\n\nYou'd be surprised at this little hole-in-the-wall, it serves up some INCREDIBLE breakfast/brunch items and they also have an all-you-can-drink mimosa deal.  As many of the other reviews mentioned...you MUST MUST MUST, seriously this is an order...must try to pork belly 'donuts'.  They will blow your mind.  \n\nThis is exactly what you want from an SF brunch spot. The staff was super friendly and the crowd is, for lack of a better word, eclectic.", "author": "Alexandra P."}

At $12, it was a very good deal...  The servers made sure our glasses were always full..plus they use Odwalla orange juice (with lots of pulp!)  which made it better (in my opinion, at least)\n\nSince people have been raving about their pork belly donuts, we decided to get that, plus the breakfast chicken slider,  bacon/egg slider and the country omelet.\nI was a disappointed with the overall taste and food portions.  The chicken slider was tasteless...even WITH the gravy. There was nothing special about the bacon/egg slider and the country omelet.   I was hoping for a bigger serving (or yummier food).  The pork belly donuts (I didn't have this but my husband did) were ok though.

The simple menu includes 2 appetizers, 2 salads, a few bar snacks, sandwiches ($8) and sliders ($3). They even have a Seitan sandwich for vegetarians. Very friendly service.\n\nI ordered their signature roast beef sandwich ($8) with BBQ sauce and/or mayo, plus choice of fries or side salad for $1 more. I got the side salad. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oUgyD229rC8wU6T90x75Jw/l The sando was delicious! The thinly sliced and SUPER tender roast beef meat was excellent.

It can be a nice lunch alternative to popular Yamo (fake Thai/Burmese food hole-in-the-wall) a block away.

This place reeks of filth, with dirty floors, no ventilation, and in a shoebox of a location. I wouldn't even go as far to say this is a restaurant because it looks and feels like the opposite of one. I felt like I was breathing in asbestos and mold. \n\nThe pork belly donuts are good but not great. Unfortunately, I ate salt balls in every. single. bite. The sweet maple (obviously) did not balance out the sodium clad balls . The pork was bland. The tempura batter is okay and has a chew but nothing impressive. The overall taste did not entice my taste buds. I felt that it was on the lower end of mediocre at best and not really creative in the realm of the Mission food scene.\n\nWe also ordered the fried chicken slider, the fried egg slider and the beef slider. The beef slider had a garlic aioli sauce which was the best of the three, although it might just be the mayo giving the slider flavor it wouldn't otherwise have. The fried chicken slider was very bland and had no real flavor. It was fried with no seasoning and finished off with 2 biscuits on either end. If I can say it looked like reheated frozen food, well, that was it. The biscuits tasted like cardboard - very dry, breaks after a bite. Uneven. Very greasy. Very meh.  The best part were the fries because you can't really mess that up.  \n\nThe worst thing was actually waiting for everything. We came at 11:04 on a Saturday morning. The place wasn't even half full yet. Food doesn't arrive until after 12:30. About 30 minutes in, I asked about my order and they said they were having problems with their oven and the biscuits were taking more time to be made. Ok fine. Wouldn't it be better practice to tell us that? She proceeded to ask if I wanted slider buns instead of the biscuits, so I said yes. It didn't come out any faster. At around 12, they shouted out to everyone in the dining room, \"the oven's working, woo hoo!\". Classy? No. To add more fuel to the fire, there were other people who came in later than us that received their food on time. It wasn't just eggs. It was the same things we ordered. It was just that ridiculous! We were about to leave but out comes our order and it was prepared in such a haste that the cheeses were still cold and not melted. \n\nService was decent. Mostly everything is self service so you get your own water, or coffee. You pay first after you order from the counter. Find your own seat. I think the waitress saw how upset we were and offered us both complimentary mimosas, which were good but not great. I've definitely had better. It's not worth the $12 price even for bottomless. The orange juice is all opened in the back counter and it looks  very unsanitary. The pitchers were also not covered. When our sliders finally came, the waitress came and comped our sliders for the wait. That was good customer service on her part and I appreciate the gesture.  \n\nTo sum it up, I would not recommend this place for the reasons above. I didn't feel like this place lives up to its ratings on Yelp.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

My partner and I happened by this place while in the neighborhood and stopped by for an afternoon drink. They have beers on tap that I've never really seen before in the city. I had the a Belgian Pale Ale (I think it was from the Marin Brewing Company), and my partner got the Headlands RyePA. The Belgian had wonderful, smooth flavors, though it had a lighter flavor profile than I expected. However, when I tried my partner's RyePA, I loved it immediately. It was hoppy and you can taste the rye in the beer. \n\nWe took our drinks out to the back patio, smoking area. It's a fairly small open area packed with picnic tables.

We started off with the pork donuts, which is pretty much a piece of pork battered up and fried like a doughnut with a sugary syrupy glaze. It sounds insane, and it's pretty freaking delicious. I went for the biscuits and gravy, which for any place outside the South is pretty delicious. My wife and other friend who were there went for a selection of the brunch sliders. I tried several and all were delicious.\n\nBy the time we finished our brunch and had a couple of beers, we had to take off because we had an appointment to look at an apartment just down the street.

We are not pork gals so just tasted one each and left the pork out.  Good concept, though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=NsJDKxQ2lcDC0YtXrnD-bQ\n\nSALAD: Butter Lettuce with Pear, Strawberries, Goat Cheese, Chives and Creamy Tarragon Vinaigrette  ($8) This salad was so ginormous! Sad to say, it was not a very good salad. The butter lettuce was not cut and we had to cut them which was hard because we only had appetizer plates. The quantity was great for sharing but the ingredients did not come together nor the dressing well-balanced.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=pZ0GxbVVfyJbKeUr82i7Ag\n\nBEER BATTERED ROCK COD SLIDERS with Sriracha Aioli and House Made Pickles ($3): These are the bomb!!!! Hot, fresh off the fryer, delish and flavorful! A \"must order \"when at Sycamore. You can mix and match their sliders of lamb or beef burger, and/or fried chicken sliders for $3 each.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=Dcw-JDqBy_ygLQ69UzS5UA\n\nSEITAN SANDWICH ($8): Let me put it this way. Unless you are a vegetarian, I will go for the beer battered rock cod sliders.  This sammy was huge but tasteless and dry.  And seitan is one of my favorite non-meat products. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wNcShx5YTSMvOxt6G0iA9w?select=K9RKOmtJiYxhGKDK2pfNTA\n\nFRIES: $1 more with the order of sliders. Not very good. Greasy and overly fried.\n\nOVERALL:\nSycamore is a cool place with decent food and great value. They will definiltely feed you without stealing your wallet. If I were a beer drinker I will come this place but I would not mind returning for those sliders.\n\nThe interior is fun but on the divey/gritty side. It did not help that it was storming when we got there. We were wet and cold, and the place was not heated. (I overheard that they were fixing their heater.)\n\nTAB: With the $25 Groupon, Heather only paid $5 more. Thanks, Heather for a fun birthday lunch, 7x7 mags and Cupcake champagne!

The servers are efficient and friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy, sunny, youthful. \n\nI've had their pork belly donuts, chicken+waffles, biscuits+gravy, as well as one of their omelette plates, and everything was decent. The portions are a bit on the small side and I would recommend getting their more unusual dishes to make the price worth it. \n\nThe chicken+waffles in particular are stuffed with prosciutto and sauced with a maker's mark maple syrup. The pork belly donuts taste almost the same as the chicken+waffles, only with the added delicious fattiness of the pork. The omelettes (side of home fries, side of fruit) are tasty but pretty standard as far as omelettes go. Same goes for their biscuits, gravy, and fries.\n\nOverall a great place to lounge around on the weekend, where the atmosphere makes up for the good-but-not-stellar food.", "author": "Jasper P."}

It didn't even look like somewhere where food is served- it looked like a dingy, dusty bar. \n\nWe sat down inside and ordered the pork belly donuts, 1 each of the sliders (regular, lamb, chicken, cod, fried egg) and bottomless mimosas.  To be honest, I couldn't stop thinking about how the place didn't look clean the whole time.  It wasn't filthy but just a place that looked like tons of people got drunk and sloppy there the night before.  We started playing board games while we waited for our food which was fun.  They have a variety of classic games to choose from.\n\nPork belly donuts: it tastes like exactly what it is.  No pleasant surprises.  Just pork belly fried in batter, topped with syrup.  Although it was good, I wouldn't go back to eat it again.  I think it would have been better if the pork belly was browned before it was dipped in the batter.  Also, the outside batter needed to be crunchier.  The ones we ate were a bit soggy, limp and pale (and not from the syrup).\n\nSliders were all pretty tasty, particularly the lamb slider.  Everything else was good but not great.  I just took a bite of each and called it a day.  \n\nThis place is more of a bar that you should come to at night time to mainly grab drinks and have some drunken snacks.", "author": "Lanna K."}

We decided upon Sycamore in the Mission district. \n\n(+):\n-A block away from the 16th street bart station.\n-Simple brunch menu so you won't suffer from indecisiveness like me and focus on drinking (note: $12 bottomless mimosas if you order $8 worth of food or more). Ordered the roast beef sandwich which was full of meaty goodness, bbq sauce, and mayo. Side salad to balance it out. Next time I'll order the sliders cause they looked pretty bomb.\n-Servers are friendly. The lady who came around with the mimosa pitcher was like a ninja! Every time one of us set our glasses down it would be magically full a second later.\n-Dog friendly! Bring them to hang out with you in the back patio. The lady even offered fresh water for one of our pups.\n-Chill and friendly vibe from everyone. No one was an obnoxious drunk mess thank goodness.\n-They take card. Nice enough to split the check too.\n\n(-):\n-Food takes forever to come out. Waited a good 30 minutes just for a roast beef burger & salad\n-Open seating = hovering over tables to snag spots. Tough if you're a big group like us (8 or so) and want to sit together. Solved this by using the stools to sit on in the patio.\n-Place is rather small so you're bumping into people here and there walking to/from the bar or around the patio\n-Flies around the patio. They probably can't do much about those, but I couldn't help but notice and hoped none of them would land in my food/drink.\n\nOverall: Good place to come to if you intend on doing more drinking than eating.

A $4 order comes with three samosa-esque pacakages of fried dough with the teased tips of dough that come from the hand dredging of the pork belly.

It's almost easy to miss when you're walking down Mission -- unlike most of the bars you find in the area, it's quieter, chiller, and smaller with a more Portland vibe to it. They've got a healthy selection of board games and an eclectic selection of music (courtesy of a jukebox). This is a nice place to go if you want to actually have a conversation with your party, instead of yelling at each other at a crowded and loud place like the Elbo Room.\n\nThat being said, the food here is very overrated. While the pork belly donuts that my friends raved about were pretty good, I couldn't shake off the sneaking suspicion that I was eating glorified Chinese food. They're not really donuts -- more like breaded and deep fried chunks of pork covered in some honey glaze (I know that the bar description reads Maker's Mark glaze, but it really tasted like honey and maple syrup). The sliders were okay but relied too much on their sauces to give the burgers flavor. And the fries were just bad. Normally I inhale pounds of fries without any problem, but here, I just ate a couple of fries and called it a night.\n\nI was initially going to give this place a 4 (just because I loved the ambiance) but I noticed that it had described itself as a \"gastropub\" (ala Magnolia and the Alembic) in its Yelp profile. Well, I suppose if that's the case, the food here really just deserves three stars.", "author": "Michelle L."}

They were fresh out of the oven or wtver, and they were freaking delicious! A perfect combination of sweet and salty!\n- breakfast chicken slider: fried chicken with country gravy on buttermilk biscuits. Are you drooling yet? Perfect with mimosas as the \"brunch\" part of the meal.\n- lamb burger slider: this one was really strong and heavy. I really like lamb! Included caramelized onions, aioli, and cheese\n- ground beef slider: so good! Had roasted garlic aioli, caramelized onions, blue cheese. I think I liked this one the best\n- side of potatoes: made breakfast style.

My friend and I weren't extremely hungry, and decided to order some of the more well known items from the brunch menu.  \n\nPork Belly Donuts - It was a mix between sweet and savory that hit my taste buds all a little too weirdly. However, I can't say I hated it because I really didn't. But I do wish that they put a little less sea salt on the top, since that definitely put my mouth on salt-overload. I would definitely order this again, but share it - it can get a little on the greasy side for one person to handle\n\nBreakfast Chicken Slider - THIS WAS DELICIOUS. I think what made this so good was the gravy they had on the slider to accompany the fried chicken and bread. If you come here, be sure to order this, the other yelper definitely didn't recommend wrongly!\n\nChicken & Waffle - I never settled on the idea of chicken & waffles before, but since my palette was already introduced to the sweet & savory experience from the pork belly donuts, I was not hesitant on trying the chicken & waffle. I don't regret trying it either, it was really good! But since I really have nothing to compare it to, I can't give it too much of a review except that it's tasty. Perhaps this will lead me towards trying more chicken and waffle restaurants.. \n\nThe waitresses are super friendly here, and they don't lie about bottomless mimosas.

The building looked funky and their chalkboard outside advertised one of my favorite beers, so I decided to give it a shot... it became my go-to neighborhood bay almost instantly. There was awesome music on the jukebox, the projector out back was playing a nature documentary about otters, the beer selection was well-curated and varied (not just increasingly-bitter variations of IPA, which has become trendy to the point of exclusion), and they still sold $2 Tecate for the times you just don't give a damn about adjectives. Later, I would come to realize the awe and majesty of their Chili Dog and other offerings; though the portion sizes vary considerably depending on what daily lunch special you order... none compare to the chili dog. I think I finished one.... once.\nThe outdoor seating is great; there's a little bench nook under a heat lamp if you're feeling social and a half-dozen picnic tables. I like to get there early (like noon), because I prefer drinking alone, and that first half of a sentence just made me sound like a loser, but that's how I roll. (See Tarun B's earlier review, where he describes the place as \"A great place to kick it, make friends, or just plug in your headphones and ignore everyone\"... truer words never spoken. I don't wear headphones though, because you overhear some outlandish shit posting up at the Sycamore.)\nMoving right along then, they also have great art all over every surface of this place. Outside has a groovy mural, and the rotation of framed art indoors is also wonderful, usually on an off-kilter, comic-illustration sort of theme.\nMost importantly, truly wonderful people work here, and you should tip generously.

After waiting 15 minutes until their 11:30 open time, I had already gone over and over what I was about to stuff my face with.\n\nWent with the pork belly donuts, each of their sliders, side of fries, and the pulled pork sandwich. The taste of the Makers in the pork belly donuts are very subtle but it's good nonetheless. Each slider was flavorful and their proteins really shined. The fries were nice and crisp like how Jack in the Box used to be before they swapped them out for the hand cut fries. But the pulled pork sandwich was staggering behind the other menu items we tried. \n\nThink I'll be back to try their brunch menu.\n\nOh yeah ... website menu prices are different than in store but not drastically so break out a couple more quarters for your grub.", "author": "Eric L."}

There is actually about 60% champagne in these bad boys but you can't taste it at all, just the juicy Odwalla goodness! If you're really desperate for drunkenness, this special lasts for 5 hours from 10-3pm on the weekends. \n\nSliders and fries were great side noms to accompany my mimosa lunch. \n\nBtw servers were super attentive to my mimosa levels.

They were mostly orange juice, but they were definitely good about keeping them refilled.  Like most brunch places, there are no reservations, but it wasn't bad getting a patio table on a Sunday around 12:30pm.  I even found metered parking right in front.\n\nSeat yourself, then go to the counter to order your drinks and food.   Coffee is $2, water is self serve.  Then, they bring the food out to you (pretty quickly).\n\nFood:\n- Chicken and waffles: Thin chicken breast, fried nicely, served over waffles.  These are not just regular waffles - they're stuffed with proscuitto and manchego, and I now strongly believe that's how all waffles should be made.  The Makers Mark maple syrup was surprisingly not too sweet.  Definitely get a double order.\n- Pork belly donuts: Basically pork belly battered and fried.  The batter is somewhat thick outside, but the pork belly inside is generous, and the same syrup/glaze as above is crucial for covering the batter (otherwise, the batter doesn't have much flavor)\n- Fried egg slider: Served on a biscuit. The egg had a perfectly runny yolk, sharp cheddar, and crisped bacon.  This was the best slider by far.\n- Lamb burger slider: Not too gamey, went well with caramelized onions and manchego, served on a regular slider bun\n- Ground beef slider: Well seasoned, topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli.  If you like blue cheese (which I do), you'll like this\n- Roast Beef Sandwich: Thinly sliced roast beef, reminiscent of an Arby's sandwich.  The sauce was kind of like Arby's sauce (which I love), and it was generous on the meat.\n\nI love the back patio, but it got pretty warm under the sun (try to find a seat under the big umbrellas).  I hear it's pretty cool for happy hour and at night, as well.  Brunch did not disappoint!", "author": "Marilyn H."}

It has nothing to do with the scene, it's just that I think this place really is a bar at heart who just decided that they wanted to make brunch one day without doing any research as to how to do it correctly.\n\nOn to the food, it was all bland and not seasoned well. I usually don't put extra salt on my food but at this establishment I definitely had to employ the saltshaker many times. The pork belly donuts were underwhelming (and I LOVE pork belly usually) and the benedict I got was underseasoned. \n\nI would not come back here for brunch.", "author": "Rylan C."}

Coming down from Portland where similar pubs are everywhere, it's such a treat to find something like this. A good beer selection and even more in bottles. The star though is the delicious food. I had the pork belly donuts with maple makers mark glaze. Amazing. Though I'd probably a different choice of meat, one that would fall apart so i can enjoy the meat in both bites of my donut. The maple and makers mark glaze is well balanced where you get the taste of both and some sea salt on top to contrast the sweetness. delicious.\n\nI also had the the beer battered catfish and this is another phenomenal. there isn't much to say about fish and chips but if you look at how the batter is light and crispy and the fish is tasty, what more do i need to say?\n\nMy last dish was... disappointing. It was the fried mac n cheese, which she sold me bacon with. I don't think the bacon made it in to my mac n cheese either that or it's so lost in there.

That said, the service was impeccable, the tap selection lovely, the food tasty, and the spirit of community is strong among the Burner-hippie-artsy crowd that makes this their local. If you like sitting out on the patio at Zeitgeist but want a little variety or some somewhat hipper snacks, get to the Sycamore.

The Sycamore is a essentially a smaller version of Zeitgeist with a more relaxed atmosphere.  There is an outdoor area, although it's mostly covered so the smoke can get a bit overhwhelming.

I dislike reviewing places because I have a terrible memory when it comes to food and I can't stand taking pictures of food while it's sitting right in front of me, just begging to be eaten. But I feel obligated to write a review of The Sycamore after my experience.\n\nAfter looking for a place for brunch in the Mission, my GF and I felt that Sycamore would be a nice place to sit down and relax. I ordered the black bean burger (I wanted the pork sandwich, but they ran out, that's fine though) my GF had the Roast Beef sandwich and we ordered the pork belly donuts for apps.\n\nFood:\n\nPork Belly Donuts - I love donuts, I love pork. This sounds like a match made in heaven, but to both of our disappointment, they were bland and had a weird bitter aftertaste.\nBlack Bean Burger - I loved it, my GF hated it.\nRoast beef sandwich - Average\n\nOkay, so I would probably rate this place a 3, went on with life and have the mediocre food vanish from my memory forever. But two incidents happened that really blackened our experience here. First, my GF went to use the restroom after we ate. While she was waiting, one of the butch looking waitresses (owner?) told my GF in a condescending tone that the \"restroom was for customers only.\" My GF replied that she WAS a customer and the waitress looked at my GF and walked off. Later, she came and told my GF \"my apologies.\" Why would she assume that my GF was not a customer? The only thing that stood out in my mind was that we were the only Asians in the restaurant. I don't want to assume anything because SF is such a diverse and welcoming City, but I have no idea why the waitress would assume she wasn't a customer. We were both sitting RIGHT IN FRONT of the staff in plain view. For the sake of not playing the \"race card\" I'll just assume the waitress had one too many mimosas.\n\nThe second incident happened when I went to pay the bill. I had to wait nearly 15 minutes to get someone to help me and when they did, I discovered that they tacked on some Granola that I did not order. I told one of the bartender/waitresses that about the mistake and she stared at me, gave me a hostile face and told me \"Are you sure?? You told me you wanted Granola.\" I had no idea what she was talking about, this one definitely had one too many drinks. She agreed to credit me back, but her bad attitude was just too much. I was glad to leave The Sycamore.  \n\nI will NOT be coming back to this establishment.", "author": "Kevin C."}

We got the beer battered fish, beef, lamb, and the fried chicken slider.\n\n I thought the lamb was the best, tasted really good, you can taste the meat, i like the burgers though, it was like oozing oil lol, i liked that. the fries were pretty good, really crispy. the fried chicken had sour cabbages i think masked the flavor. beef like had no sauce bro, was my least favorite. my cousin liked the beer batted fish the best.

We ordered the breakfast chicken slider, fried egg slider, lamb burger slider, chicken and waffles, and pork belly donuts. The food was good for the price, the portions were somewhat small, but ok for the price. You have to order everything at the bar, including food. They were taking a long time to come around with more mimosas so I went to the bar to get more, considering everything is ordered at the bar I thought this would be ok. The sever rudely said to me, \"you know what if you would just have a seat she'll come around she has a lot of people to serve\". I wish I could say this was the only person that was rude but the entire staff were not friendly. Maybe locals are use to this kind of service from this establishment.

If you know the area, great.  If you don't, The Sycamore is right in between 17th and 18th on Mission, so some people hanging outside the bar can be somewhat ghetto, but harmless.  I did lock up my bike outside and looked over to make sure it was still there.  No problemo. \n\nPro's: \n- Fatty pice of pork belly, deep fried in dough.  Yummy, but like many other people said in their reviews, you can probably only eat one b/c it's super greasy & fatty.  When I think about it now, it grosses me out, but it was delicious when I was eating it. : P \n- Beer selection was good.  Between the four of us, we covered 4 shades/types of beer.\n- Board games!!  Taboo, Scrabble, Apples to Apples.... they even have a Ouija board... eek. I won't be touching that one, ever.  \n- Chill atmosphere\n- Two dudes playing guitar in the corner\n\nCon's:\n- Say no on sangria.  Well, I do realize that this is probably a rarity, but I might've gotten food poisoning of some sort from here.  I can only think of sangria that could've caused it because between the four of us, we shared the donuts and fries - and I was the only one, who chose to try the sangria and ate most of the fruits inside it.  Nobody else had a reaction except for me, so I blame the sangria/fruits for waking me up nauseated at 4am with a massive stomach ache.  \n- Two dudes playing guitar in the corner. I liked it... and they were good, don't get me wrong, but when they started singing... well, let's just say that I was kinda relieved when they were done. \n\nAnyway, the bottom line - I would give it 3.5 stars, but I don't care what kind of a goddess it is - the Toilet Goddess is not cool.

The chicken and bacon salad, was on point too...I don't even think there was dressing on the salad, nonetheless 3 people can share this salad its quite tasty. The eggs Benedict's were O.K. and that's it, nothing spectacular, and nothing horrible, just O.K.  As for the pork belly donuts, I was excited to try them after reading all of the RAVE reviews, maybe I got a bad batch I don't know, the 'glaze\" at the bottom of the bowl was the best thing, otherwise everything else tasted like bundles of fried dough with large crystals of salt melting down your throat, the pork belly was bland.

A fine mix of black and reds throughout the room make the artwork pop out of the wall. Most of the art is baed around black and whites with accents of cool metallics. The room had an \"old fashioned\" juke box. What that means is that it's one with buttons and no touch screen connected to an international database of popular top 40. Nope, I was listening to mostly indie pop. And I liked the change. I noted the board games sitting on a high shelf and the comfy booths lining the walls. \n\nThe bartender was nice. She acknowledged me right away and excused herself to assist others before getting to me. I appreciate this compared to not getting noticed at all. Very respectful and knowledgeable about the beers.\n\nLet's talk food. I had the pork belly doughnuts and it is great I didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad I got what I got. Imagine if you will a nicely braised, still very meaty, pork belly that's still got that luscious fattiness dripping from it. Now dip that in doughnut batter and fry it. Perfect drinking food. Forget a pulled pork sandwich, this is better.\n\nNext up I had the pan fried provolone with chimichuri. A nice dish in and of itself. I wish there was some bread with the dish so that I wasn't picking up seared cheese. It was a surprisingly well seared piece of cheese, I'll give them that.

So my review is strictly regarding their food and not their beer or atmosphere, though the bartender was a pretty cool guy. \n\nThose pork belly donuts were overrated I'm afraid. It's simply a piece of pork belly, albeit a good piece, wrapped in dough and fried. Sure you have the syrup on the side but it seriously needs to be soaked in it to live up to the 'donut' name. I came in with the idea that it would be like a donut donut, not fried bread. \n\nYes, the sliders are pretty awesome. The lamb was excellent, the chicken was excellent, the beef was excellent, but the fish was only OK as it was more batter than fish.\n\nBiting into the roast beef sandwich the first thought I had was that it reminded me of a hamburger in sliced beef form. It was probably the sauce but the sandwich was pretty tasty and if it was a hamburger it would make a good hamburger. \n\nSo The Sycamore has some great food and I may decide to go again some day for lunch or at night with a different group.

Welll...... \n\nFound this place on yelp and I was immediately drawn to the chicken and waffles and pork belly donuts, so I grabbed my foodie sidekick and headed over to the Mission to search this place out. Like many restaurants in the Mission, it's pretty easy to pass, but if you go there once you'll remember how to get back. It's located on a corner between 17th and 18th and there's no sign in the front. We walk into the restaurant/bar and it's pretty tiny. As soon as I felt the vibe I looked over to my friend and she looks horrified. A lady who tends to be annoyed of the hipster trend she immediately questions my taste level. But I'm whatever as soon as I see sporadic food baskets at every table. Her expression was built by something other than the food though which were the games that were being played at every table and even the bar. I don't mind that thing, but it just goes to show the contrast of a all you can drink mimosas place in the Mission with a bunch of hipsters to the same deal in let's say the Castro of the infamous on going night club of Lime (RIP). We take seat at the bar and when her eyes fell on the menu she focused more on her goal and dropped her insecurities of the environment. \n\nI didn't really think to come on here to write about the food because it's pretty spot on with all the other reviews. Waffles stuffed with delicious surprise, soaked with syrup but maintaining crispyness and accompanied by a delicious three bite chicken tender. Crispy fries, delicious two bite lamb sliders, sweet, sticky fluffy donuts with salt flakes encasing tender pork and an overflowing fried egg with bacon slider. Okay, I guess it was worth mentioning. \n\nGlasses never got empty so it was hard to gauge how much I drank. The server told me if it never gets empty it always counts as one. I also tried a shot of this German liquor that I forgot the name of. It's 44% alcohol but it's served as a digestive.... Contains a lot of cloves but I liked it, and it was on the house :) \n\nIn conclusion, I'm coming back, and my friend says that waffle is on the top 5 of the best things she's tried!", "author": "MaryAnn C."}

Find delicious and unique choices like Magic Hat No. 9 and Cherry Voodoo Tripel to go with your Lamb Burger or Fried Chicken Sliders! What I can't get enough of are their signature Pork Belly Donuts! Yes, Pork Belly Donuts- a tasty, fatty chunk of pork belly surrounded by a crunchy dough shell covered a with Maple Makers Mark glaze!

Food is just fine for a pub but nothing special\n\nThis is a great little neighborhood pub.  Good unique beer selection and a nice little menu.  This is not, however, a gastropub, unless gastropub is just a new longer way of saying pub.\n\nIn my mind, any place that has mixed bar and table seating and offers food but obviously considers itself a drinking establishment is a pub.  What makes a gastropub fit the category is that the food is better than your typical pub food (also that they might actually use plates and silverware).\n\nI had Sycamore's \"famous\" roast beef sandwich and a Kolsch style beer whose brewery I didn't catch.  The beer was on draft and really tasty.  The sandwich came with their house made sauce.  The sandwich was decent, but we're only talking a step or two above an Arby's roast beef sandwich - same style too: round white bun, thin sliced medium grade roast beef, sauce and/or mayo.  No lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle etc.  Fries were really good.", "author": "Wes H."}

But where it might skimp a bit on decor, it focuses its attention on its surprisingly good food.\n\nThe menu is simple - a couple of starters and salads but the focus is the mini sliders (beef, lamb, fried chicken or BLT) and the sandwiches (roast beef, pulled pork).\n\nStarted off with some chili roasted peanuts, which were served hot.  Nice touch! And like the little kick of (spicy) heat as well.\n\nThe roast beef was delicious with tender meat piled on a soft bread that soaked up the hearty juices.  The accompanying large cut fries were crispy but soft on the inside (just the way I like them).\n\nAlso tried the ground beef slider.  Omg, three bites of heaven, especially with the healthy pile of point reyes blue cheese.  I also heard the BLT was good.\n\nLove the unique beers on draft.

When a coworker mentioned that it served great sliders and beer - it was a no-brainer that I had to make my way over.\n\nToday, my roommates and I checked it out. Findings below:\n\nAmbiance: \n-Gritty and divey. The non-hipster Mission at it's finest.\n-The Sycamore looks like it's been around for years - a small corner shop with a bar, some tables and a jukebox.\n-Old tap handles line the ceiling above the bar. A fun touch a la Toronados. \n\nFood:\n-We ordered the fries, pork belly donuts, salad, and sliders along with our beer.\n-Fries: Mmm, medium at most. Similar to what I used to get at my high school cafeteria.\n-Pork belly donuts: BEST PART OF THE MEAL. Biting into one of these was pork belly, succulent, heaven. Even better when dipped into some Ketchup and Tapatio. I'd come here just to order these with beer. No joke.\n-Salad: Also ok. We ordered the caprese salad - which I was super excited about because it contained heirloom tomatoes. It ended up being mostly arugula which tasted a bit strange - more bitter than the spiciness I like arugula for. Additionally, I wasn't sure if the tomatoes were heirloom - but it sufficed.\n-Sliders: Catfish, Fried Chicken, and BLT. Fried chicken was probably most delicious - a yummy chicken morsel - perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Can't put my finger on what it was, but the sauce added a good kick! The Catfish was forgettable along with the BLT. Not enough flavor.\n-Beer: Pretty good selection - refreshing with your sliders!\n\nGood-to-Know:\n-Order your food and beer at the bar. If you go with friends, have someone save a table.\n-Mondays @ 8p are trivia night - and sometimes can also be on Wednesdays. This was a surprise to us when we visited today! Pretty fun quiz and not TOO hard. \n-Props to the owner being so enthusiastic and having a pretty challenging song round.\n\nEh, bet this place is fun for happy hour - which is, I think, from 4-7p.

After ordering at the bar for some sliders, we all sat down and started sipping on our mimosas. 4 glasses and 50 minutes later, we still haven't gotten our food so we check on it with the girl behind the bar. She tells us its on its way, so we wait some more while she makes the rounds of mimosa refills while avoiding our gaze. Finally, 3 of the 4 plates show up... I went up and asked for my order again just as my friends all finished theirs. The egg on the fried egg slider was cold, the cheese not melted, and the fruit cup ($2 add-on) was a mess of tiny (fingertip sized) slices of melon and a few mushy blueberries. Also, I think they ran out of the regular bread for the sliders because we got the biscuits for all of them (chicken/egg/beef). She took my meal off the tab, but still really not worth it.

I was quite excited to try them but they were good but nothing extraordinary. The description was definitely better than they tasted. Maybe I am picky but cold pork belly isn't that appealing. When I have had pork belly in the past, it always melted in my mouth and I was kinda of expecting that when I bit into this donut, the fat from the pork belly would just melt and coat my mouth. The first bit was alright, the syrup was definitely a nice complement but the pork belly just wasn't hot enough...I know it's fatty but biting into a lukewarm piece of pork fat just isn't that great. The roast beef sandwich was tender and the bread was nice and soft. The food here is good but I would say the description plays up the food. The service here is excellent and they all make sure you are taken care of. There is a huge selection of beers.", "author": "Eve C."}

I love this place! I have been a few times and the food is consistently great. You can sit inside and play board games or outside in the backyard at the picnic benches. They have endless mimosas as well as a full bar for other treats like bloody mary's. The only drawback on the bloody is it had no veggies in it- which is my favorite part. \nIt feels like a mini zeitgeist but minus the crowds and asshole bartenders. The food is also WAY better and CHEAP! \nSliders are $3 and you can get sides of fries or potatoes or fruit for a few bucks.  Everyone who works there is super duper nice. \nI highly recommend the pork belly donuts and sliders. All of them are so good! The fried chicken slider comes on a hot biscuit with country gravy dripping off it. The lamb burger is also seasoned perfectly. I have never had something so sinful as the pork donut with sea salt and whisky glaze. It is an orgasm in your mouth. \nBe warned, its all comfort food so be prepared to take a nap immediately after eating.", "author": "M K."}

Decor is a typical neighborhood dive bar, but their lamb and their chicken sliders were out of this world.  The beef slider was good, but not nearly as good as the other two.

The back door patio is intact (if slightly rearranged) and on this trip, nobody peed a puddle under the alley-facing wall as we watched in horror.\n\nThe BEST reason we picked the place is because you can bring your dog in back.  My new dog got lots of love from everyone, so this place gets 4 bones for offering that opportunity as well as good food. \n\nI got the portabella sandwich with greens.  The seasoning on the mushroom was perfection.  I have never had a better one ever.  The greens were oiled and seasoned well and made for great nibbling in between their good beer on draft.  The only slight minus was the small-ish serving size.  The sandwich was at best medium-small and the basket with greens was small enough to reinforce that idea.  75% of the time I would probably complain the opposite about most restaurants overdoing it- this one left me hungry enough to need a side of fries afterwards.  They also offer sliders, and a couple of those could add to a meal, but I felt a little uncomfortable about the price for such small items.  Also the menu is not very extensive.  I'd wish to see those addressed at least a little.  But otherwise, this was good food with good beers and gastropub ambiance.  I recommend giving it a visit to make up your own mind.", "author": "Pat L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-26", "description": "As soon as we walked into the Sycamore with our group of six people, we were disappointed by the size of the place. But, it's the Mission right? Our mood was slightly elevated once we saw an outside place, however there were only a few tables out there and they were all taken. Yet, we found a way to stuff our hungry, slightly tipsy bodies into the front room. We sat there for about 10 minutes and then realized that we had to order at the bar. No problemo. We each went up and ordered what we wanted. The bar tenders were very nice and had no problem with us ordering individually. I was kind of afraid that they would force us to all be on one tab since we were sitting together, but they didn't mention it. Good stuff. \n\nOn to the food: I ordered one of each slider - lamb, ground beef, BLT and fried chicken. I also ordered a basket of fries. The sliders are $3 each and the large basket of fries only $5. I think the prices are very reasonable. Oh yeah, and the table go a bunch of pork belly donuts. \n\nThe food came out in about 25 minutes. Good timing I thought. But it could have taken longer - the food was AMAZING. Each slider was amazingly tasty and amazingly different from one another. My first bite, the lamb. Awesome. The second bite, the ground beef. A burst of beef and bleu cheese. The third bite, the fried chicken, so juicy. The fourth bite, the BLT, the bacon was from another world. And so the bites went on until everything was gone, crumb and all. The fries were regular fries. Middle of the road. They met my expectations, however, thinking back, I would have thought they would have gourmet'ed the fries up a bit. Seeing as the sliders are so well done, I think they should add some kind of special touch to the fries (how about truffle butter fries?) But, I was happily downing $2 PBR and chompin' away on the fries so I had no issue. \n\nBut alas, the pork belly donuts. These are just one of those things that, when you bite into them for the first time, you immediately check mark a box on the list of things that you want to experience before you die. You want to run outside and tell everyone how amazing they are. Crispy sweet glazed outside, fatty pork belly on the inside. They lasted 5 seconds around the table. \n\nThe beer selection is quite good, but I think they charge a pretty penny for some of the more gourmet beer options. $9 for Delirium Tremens? I think they could push $8. BUT, they have $2 PBRs if you want to be a cheap bastich like me. Good draft beer selection. They ran out of Boddingtons while we were there though, so, that was kind of disappointing. I can live without it though. \n\nThis place has some neat stuff too - an interesting little juke box as well as classic board/card games (Sorry! and Apples 2 Apples). Good for a group looking to spend some quality time together.\n\nSummary:\n\nPROs:\n1) The most awesome sliders you'll ever eat.\n2) Pork belly donuts.\n3) Good beer selection with reasonable options if you're feeling stingy\n4) Friendly staff (when I asked if water was possible, the waitress said \"Oh, ANYTHING is possible.\" I like to hear that.)\n5) Fun and games for the group - juke box and board games. \n6) Oh yeah, and props for letting us shotgun PBR's in the back (at least I think they were cool with it). \n \nCONs\n1) They weren't too smart with their placement of seating in the outside back area. I think they could have set it up to hold more people wanting to sit. The design of the back area looked a bit unfinished as well. \n2) Fries needed more umph.

When you walk in, it looks half-coffeeshop with boardgames, half-neighborhood pub with youngsters. Couldn't even tell they had food but still I persevered, taking a seat at the bar. The bartender on duty & an off-duty one having a drink both friendly, good senses of humor. One advised me on what to order; the other offered beer tastes. Draughts $1 off, so I tried a domestic saison and one of the ancient recipes Dogfish has been reviving, which made for interesting chat. If it hadn't been Happy Hour; however, I would've gone with Maudite or Delirium, as the bottle offerings appealed more than what was on tap. My 3 sliders (1 lamb, 2 beef) & basic side salad arrived immediately: rich & juicy & delish! Though $3.50 for a (rather large) slider seemed a bit pricy, the final bill - $21.50 for dinner and 2 beers - certainly was not! Exactly what I wanted before the theater.", "author": "Faith A."}

A perfect combination of terrific beer selection, absolutely delicious mini-sandwiches (and big ones too) and a fantastic jukebox.

The sliders were all delicious (my goodness, the blue cheese and roast beef ones!), and the beers were a wide variety- and the staff were knowledgeable about what they'd recommend as a comparable brew to the ones I favor.  I'm already planning to visit to try out more of the menu. \n\nThe location's easy to get to by public transit (about a block and a half from BART & the 22 Fillmore; 1/2 block from the 33 Stanyan)- and the interior is cosy-feeling, with a jukebox that was 90% artists I knew, and 10% artists I was forced to assume I'd like.  And for those of you who smoke, this bar's got a back porch where you can take your beer, and enjoy your cigarette, without being asked by random passers-by for a spare one (sorry, buddy- I only got 20 in this pack!).", "author": "Turner M."}

Holy hell. I should have gone with the sliders, but blek I chose the pulled pork sandwich and it was disgusting'o'rama. When i got it the whole bottom part of the bun was completely drenched, soggy and no longer held bun form. I picked it up and it broke away, falling onto the wet paper towel below.  I was left attempting to hold together the fatty bits of flavorless meat. I wasn't about to get suckered to pay 8 bucks for no sustinence, so I reluctantly slurped it down, not in any pleasurable way I assure you and chugged my beer and got the hell out of there. I liked the janky place it was before, Cafe Prague much more. Perhaps the sliders are better? The woman who sat TOO CLOSE to me on the bench seemed to enjoy hers, I could tell because she was chewing right next to my ear. Then I went to Oakland Pride and it was much more fun, where I got pork on a stick that was comparably priced but so much better. This place was rank yo.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Worst salad I have ever had.  I know you're asking what would I expect from a bar, but it's a gastropub, and if it's going to suck so bad, why bother to put it on the menu?  \n- Service is minimal.  Go to the bar to order, get water refills, and wait in line with others trying to get drinks to get your bill and pay.  \n- It was freezing!  I kept my coat on.  When I went to the bathroom I saw they had the door to the alley in the back open.\n- Not horrible, but kind of weird, but in said bathroom, the trash had onion peels in it.  Are they peeling onions in the bathroom?  \n- First order of fries hit the spot, but the second order was hard.\n\nOverall, solid positive points are not terribly detracted by the random negative ones (just don't order a salad.)  Think of it more as a low key bar with food, not a gastropub, and expect to work for you supper.

Just stopped in for drinks with a variety of different friends each time. They'd be 5 stars for sure if they had a full bar, and had a non-smoking outdoor patio! But alas, they only serve beer and wine (and \"sangria\" although it seems to just be cheap wine with some fruit chopped up in it... that's not actually sangria FYI), and there's always a plethora of smokers on the patio (seems odd to me to have to go INSIDE to get fresh air... eww). It's so nice to find a spot in the mission on a Saturday night where I can find a place to sit with a group of 7 friends, and we don't have to scream at each other over juke box hits from the 90's in order to hear each other!

I had two sliders (chicken and fish) with fries, and also the pork belly donuts.  The donuts were delicious, with just the right amount of pork flavor.  The sliders were satisfying and perfectly cooked and topped.  The fries were cooked to my exact liking--crispy on the outside but not dried out and nasty in the middle.  The beers on tap were good and reasonably priced, plus the happy hour is $1 off all on-tap beers.  I sat at the bar, so service was good.  I would certainly stop back here, especially if I was in The Mission in the late evening after some bar hopping.", "author": "Jason S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-23", "description": "I'm going to address all the people on here that have complained about the Sycamore: this is not the perfect gastropub you are looking for in your ideal world. Their food is really good because they put time and effort in making everything (and the chef who helped design the menu has worked at some pretty high end establishments), the beers are carefully selected (as well as the wines and other drinkables) and the jukebox music is hand selected by the sibling owners. The reason why it says on here that it's good for groups is largely because of the outdoor patio, which is fabulous when it's warm out, which is frequently the case in the Mission. If it's too small for you and your friends, go to Zeitgeist (and suffer their douchebag wrath). The slanting floor is not their fault, DEAL WITH IT and watch where you're walking. On that note, I liked their fried chicken and new catfish slider last night! I think the fries are NOMMY!

What you're craving is the pork belly donut from The Sycamore. The Sycamore provides the richness and tenderness of perfect pork surrounded by a crunchy fried hollow sphere.\n*Fried Chicken Slider - It sounds amazing in theory, and it might be in execution... but not always. The biscuit was a bit dry. I was also surprised since I had assumed the chicken would be southern-style fried chicken but was instead covered in what looked like panko crumbs. It was good, but not as great as I wanted it to be.\n*Fried egg + Bacon Slider - If you love the messiness of slicing into a fried egg over potatoes, and you want this messiness on your fingers, you should definitely get this slider.\n*Beef Slider - I didn't get this, but my friend Mark swears that it's the best thing he ate that day. And we ate a lot that day.\n*Fries - They were perfect. There was the perfect ratio of crispy to soft potato. They were seasoned just right. These fries were fantaaastic.\n\nAmbience\n*Board games - Uh, they have board games. We didn't play any, but I loved the fact that they had 'em.\n*Cozy/cramped - It's San Francisco, so what do you expect?\n\nService\n*One waitress? - We only had one server on a Saturday morning, and didn't see anyone else serving customers. The place was full. We got our food, but we weren't checked on and we got our own ketchup because we couldn't find the waitress.

Either way we talked shop for a bit while I waited for my brother. The bartender/waitress/cashier helped me select a tap beer and even offered a sample or two. When my dashing brother arrived we got down to ordering food.  We came specifically for the roast beef and ordered just that. I wanted pork belly donuts but was veto-ed. Instead we added a couple sliders and side salad, just to counterbalance the amount of grease and breading we were about to ingest. We sat in the backyard as it was a sunny San Francisco afternoon. Our food was delivered quickly. The roast beef sando was big and sloppy and saucy and tasty. The sliders were mediocre across the board. My fave was probably the fried chicken. The catfish was a little heavy on the oil and the lamb was decent. Overall, the price was right and the service friendly. If I still lived in this perfect city I would go again for a late afternoon snack/beer. Thanks ladies.", "author": "Jessica K."}
