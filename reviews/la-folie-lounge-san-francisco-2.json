But the lounge is a little more accessible, does not require a reservation and is totally casual.\n\nThe \"bar bites\" are bar snacks to the nth degree. Some of our favorites are the salmon lollipops, the gougeres, charcuterie plate and deviled eggs -- topped with caviar -- we are talking Chef Pasot after all! \n\nAnd in addition to a full bar, the bonus of eating at the lounge is you have access to the whole Regular Menu of La Folie, and the entire Wine List curated by George Pasot. With plenty of new and old world selections at all price points you are sure to find something you will like. And George and his staff are happy to help.\n\nAfter a couple of glasses of Champagne and some bar bites, we had a nice bottle of Cote Rotie, and shared the lobster risotto, the lamb chops and a cheese souffle.\n\nLife is good!", "author": "John C."}

La Folie lounge where have you been hiding among the sub par (obviously blue barn is excluded from this statement) restaurants and sports bars that line Polk?\n\nMoving on, based on the constantly full seats I have definitely come late to the party, and maybe this place isn't a secret after all. Their happy hour menu is phenomenal! $6 glass of French rose, yes please! Deviled eggs with roe, of course! \n\nWe had the above, as well as lobster Mac n cheese (no brainer) and the seared foie gras. The Mac n cheese was good, although I felt there was a bit too much panko or breadcrumbs or whatever they used. Interesting presentation with the overflow of the ramekin being also plated (but hey I'm not one to get mad over more cheese and carbs). It was good, but not sure I would go back for it.\n\nNow onto the important things, the foie. So I love foie gras, and I particularly love seared foie so this was a no brainer (even at $50, more on that later). In the city, my one true seared foie love is at absinthe (assuming it's one of the times foie is legal in SF). But this one was interesting and worth a try. It was HUGE (maybe why it was $50?!). I am certain I've never experienced such a large piece of foie. It also came with the tiniest piece of walnut financier (read sweet bread). Now I have eaten more foie than is probably good to admit publicly for a variety of reasons, but as me and my girlfriend stared at it, we were just at a loss. Do we eat it like a steak? LUCKILY, cute bartender to the rescue since he helped us out and brought some toasted brioche which was lovely with the foie and braised cherries. This being said, as with the Mac n cheese, I'm not one to complain about foie, but the sear and glaze were such that it almost felt tough in the outside. And I typically like my foie to be so mindblowingly good I forget about the social/ humanitarian implications. I'm not sure if this one did it for me. \n\nI was overall very happy with the experience and the ambiance coupled with amazing wine deals will have me coming back. However, I might just stick to more of the bar bites next time.", "author": "Adele T."}

A while back, a good friend gave to me a gift certificate to La Folie. I called ahead to make sure they would accept it in the lounge and they said yes. I suggested to my parents that we try the lounge since we've been to the actual restaurant several times. Plus, it's not as much of a monetary commitment as the actual restaurant.\n\nWe dropped by Monday, July 27th around 6pm for a light dinner of drinks and apps. There were some people there already, but we were able to find a four top for the three of us.\n\nFood:\n*Ahi tuna tartare: trout roe, pickled beets, marinated quail egg ($14)\n*Seared Hudson Valley foie gras: with caramelized peaches and spiced peach consomme ($50)\n*Artisan cheese (Three $18): Fourme d'Ambert - rodolphe le meunier, Auvergne, France; Brillat savarin; Epoisse - Burgundy, France\n*Grand charcuterie plate: assortment of pate, salumi and cured meats ($18)\n\nThe foie was just as delicious as I remember. Silky, fatty and oh so good! My mom actually wanted to order two of them! I had to stop her as this is a generous portion and there were only three of us! If you also want their foie torchon, order the charcuterie as it comes with it along with a good selection of other meats. And such a deal at $18!\n\nMy dad adores cheese. Whenever a restaurant offers a good cheese plate, we always order it. I don't know much about cheese, but I know I like stinky and creamy. The Fourme d'Ambert and Epoisse were my favorites. The Fourme d'Ambert was reminiscent of blue cheese, but so much better! The Epoisse was nice and creamy. The menu said it was labeled the king of cheeses. I understand why. Yum!\n\nThe tuna was good, but nothing amazing. I'd skip that next time.\n\n*Macallan 18 ($21)\n*Mas de boislauzon 'la chaussynette', france, 2013 (Rhone blend) $32 bottle\n\nSurprisely, their wine list is moderately priced. All bottles ranged from $32-$64 and glasses ranged from $8-$20. I was expecting the cheapest bottle to be $70, so this was a nice surprise. I also got a macallan as it was national scotch day. And it was nicely priced for an 18 year.\n\nEvery time I go to La Folie, Roland Passot is walking around greeting his diners. I love that. To me, it shows he cares about his patrons. And he's always down to take a picture. Such a lovely man. Plus, he makes the best seared foie! If it wasn't for the roommate, I'd be chasing after Mr Passot!

Truth be told, if I am going to spend upwards of $70.00 on a bottle of wine and nearly the same amount for Champagne, the decor should match the price point. The chair I was sitting on, in my purple silk dress, was dinged and torn at the corners (see photo). I was not impressed La Folie! I chose this location because I felt it maintained a high level of standard for not only service but atmosphere as well. As a patron that has enjoyed your establishment on more than one occasion, I suggest that you invest in new chairs or at least chair covers. \n\nNow that I have said my peace, I do love the overall experience here. The service is impeccable. The staff is available, but not hovering. They work very hard to accommodate your needs. Just ask. \n\nTheir selection of wines and Champagnes is wide. Obviously there are wines from France, but so also a nice selection of California wines. The Rose Brut from France is splendid. Effervescent without having a soda pop experience that most typical bubbly produces. Our pinot from Russian River valley was as equally sublime. The initial fragrance was like smelling a bouquet of flowers. It was light on the palette and a perfect pairing with our small bites. \n\nThe small bites were perfect for our group of 4. The California Burrata is probably the best burrata I have had, since it has become a 'thing' in San Francisco. The cheese was soft and spreadable. When ordering the Grand Charcuterie Plat\u00e9 be sure to sample the foie gras mousse. It is divine. I swear I was spreading butter on my bread crips. Oh! the bread crips themselves are delicious on their own. The selection of Artisan Cheese was my least favorite. They were not very tasteful. My friends made the cheese selections, so next time I will be more involved in that process! \n\nMake note that the sound can become quite loud in the lounge. Also if you have larger group, say upwards of 10, seating will be difficult. \n\nSince I was celebrating my recent engagement here, the icing on my cake was when the Sommelier came to pour my wine. I am a sucker for that type of attention to detail. Clearly our server spread the word.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

I've eaten there twice but not at La Folie Lounge, which is next door. I ate here about four weeks ago. One of the coolest things you can order at the lounge is ordering items from the restaurant. One of the items I wanted to order was the Baked Alaska Peach Melba. However it was out of season. That's probably a good thing because I think to really appreciate the lounge you need to order food from the lounge and not the restaurant.\n\nAs I entered the lounge I looked at the cocktail menu. I was shocked there was a drink called the Le Bourdain. In the San Francisco episode of \"The Layover\" Anthony Bourdain had breakfast with his friend Roland Passot. Later in that episode Anthony Bourdain recommended La Folie. La Folie was my first fine dining experience. That is how I got interested in fine dining. I was wondering if the cocktail was named after him. The cocktail was a nice, refreshing beverage to start off the evening. \n\nAs I've had with the restaurant next door, I ordered 4 items. The first item was deviled eggs. I never had them before but I also don't like cold eggs. However I wanted to give them a try. It was a light dish and not heavy as cold eggs tend to be from my experience. The second dish was the truffle macaroni and cheese with lobster. Macaroni and cheese is nothing special - it's just elbow pasta and cheese. However there are certain dishes where I've experienced an epiphany. The macaroni and cheese with lobster at the lounge fits that epiphany. The only thing I never liked about macaroni and cheese is the dish tends to be heavy. The dish at the lounge is light because it is cooked in a small cast iron bowl. Yet this dish maintains the crispy top prevalent in macaroni and cheese dishes. I've see bacon added in macaroni and cheese however the addition of bacon makes the dish salty. By adding lobster to the macaroni and cheese it adds sweetness to the dish. What makes the La Folie restaurant great is the big portion of each dish. The third dish brings that quality. The crispy duck confit has a large portion because the duck leg is huge. Even though the portion was big I was disappointed about this dish because I didn't find the duck confit to be crispy but dry and stringy on the outside. The meat inside is tender. The best duck confit I ever had was the Michelin Star restaurant The Village Pub in Woodside. So the crispy duck confit at the lounge was going against some tough competition in my mind. The fourth dish and final dish I ordered was a dessert - cheese souffl\u00e9. When the souffl\u00e9 arrived I was delighted and surprised it was the Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9 from the restaurant next door. I read so many great reviews of the Edam Cheese Souffl\u00e9 from La Folie. This was by far the lightest cheese souffl\u00e9 I ever had. It just melts in your mouth. As with the restaurant, after four dishes at the lounge I was stuffed.\n\nWith all the great experience I couldn't give a perfect 5-star rating. First the crispy duck confit was stringy on the outside. Second and most of all is that I couldn't give the same rating  for the lounge as I did for the restaurant next door because it implies they're both the same and they're not. Overall this is nice, quaint place to dine while experiencing a sample size of the La Folie menu.", "author": "Gerald R."}

Yes, we knew La Folie Lounge (LFL) would not be the same yet here's what we encountered when entering and eating at the Lounge this past Saturday evening:\n\nOn the outside LFL, looks cool with outside tables.. perfect for people gawking on Polk.

All said, food is fine, not stellar yet good for a lounge.\n\nYet, here's the deal. The bill was $140.. \n\nHere's my take:\n\n- LFL needs to step up their game as it is a gateway to La Folie (LFL place should be tip top shape (shit, TOAST, down the street is in better shape).\n\n- Your champagne prices by the glass are exorbitant.. if it were La Folie, i would understand.\n\n- 86 the miniature ice cubes. Rather, man up and get a machine which produces large format cubes as it changes the entire experience of the drink (both in terms of presentation and taste).\n\nLastly:\nLFL has an accommodating staff, a nice, casual atmosphere for sharing a drink.. yet needs to step up it's game.\n\nWe look forward to LFL improvements as it can be a real killer place.\n\npeace,\nsam", "author": "sam l."}

However, we were mistaken.\n\nTo start, my friend walked outside to puff on his vapor pen when we arrived to the bar. He was at a fairly large distance from the entrance, off to the side. To further elaborate on a vapor pen, it is not tobacco--it only simulates smoke and has relatively no odor. However, although he went outside and stood at a considerable distance from the entrance, our server (a female, the receipt I was given after paying said \"Graeme\" but I believe that is the male bartender) scolded him for doing this and told him to stand even further from the entrance. Later, several patrons sat at the table directly outside the bar, with the windows open, and smoked cigarettes, with the actual smell of tobacco blowing into the bar and onto our table, as we had the one directly against the window. The patrons were never informed to move or stop smoking so close to the table. Our group was rather insulted by this seemingly double standard.\n\nWhen we then ordered our drinks, our server (the same female who had told my friend not to smoke his vapor pen near the entrance) was cold and seemed to want to not serve us. She was very cordial and social with the other tables, but did not come back to our table for over 30 minutes until we were ready for the bill. While I know water is usually upon request, I did not see that information anywhere on the menu or the bar, so I assumed we would have received some upon entering. We did not. It was as if she was avoiding us the rest of the evening. Mind you, even after this treatment, we were still civil and polite, never belligerent, boisterous, or disrespectful. We had also asked for a Cabernet or a Pinot recommendation, and she only told us that \"Pinot is the light version of the Cabernet\", which didn't really answer our question. She ended up recommending (and us choosing) a wine that ended up being a mix of Cabernet, Malbec, and Merlot, the direct opposite of what we desired. Being this is a Michelin Star-awarded establishment, we took the server's word for a good wine selection, and were pretty displeased at what we received. Not wanting to be rude (although we certainly had reason to do so at this point), we ended up keeping the wine. \n\nAfter my friends took their frustrations to the manager, Rob, he never came by to assuage them. If he had at least came by to say he was addressing the situation, we would have felt more at ease. Or if he had at least delegated to someone else, that would have been a start. But the lack of response caused us to be more upset.  I understand it was a Friday night, and Halloween, so it was perhaps busier than usual, but when you come with this type of problem, you would think it would warrant at least some action. I wasn't asking for her to be fired or berated on the spot--just something to show we were being listened to. I was not privy to the entire ordeal, but when I went outside to leave, I saw Rob talking to my friends. He continued to say \"there is nothing I can do here\" and seemed to want us to go away. He only said \"I'm listening now\" after we spoke to him outside the bar directly. His lack of interest in our complaints was concerning and further caused us to agree to never return to the bar again. When we told him that, he seemed to not care. You would think a popular restaurant in San Francisco would not want to lose business, but I suppose losing five people who spent almost $100 total isn't a big deal.

Clearly, we didn't realize quite a few other people are currently on foie gras binges themselves.  When we were paying, we politely asked how typical the night was compared to a normal Monday and the waiter told us they had already done 4 times their normal sales! And it was only 9pm, with an hour and a half of service remaining and people waiting patiently outside! Yup, SF loves its Foie Gras.\n\nAfter waiting a quick 25 minutes, we got a great table and proceeded to enjoy one of the best meals of our lives!\n\nYou can order the normal bar bites or the items on the Foie menu a la carte if you'd like, but the real deal are the Foie prix fixes.  They're offering very similar dishes as the $175 Foie meal in the restaurant, with slight variations and smaller (but not by much) portions, making the Lounge definitely the way to go this week.\n\nYou can get 3 courses for $80, 4 for $90 or 5 for $100 and they allow you to share the dishes, so we went with the 5 for $100 to try everything on the menu other than the foie & truffle topped filet, which was $45 supplemental and unnecessary during such a foie heavy meal.\n\nFor wine, we decided on a bottle of Sancerre to add a little sweetness and balance out the richness of the Foie Gras.\n\nTo start, the amuse bouche was a dollop of Foie Gras Mousse topped with diced peaches and walnuts, served in an asian soup spoon that sat on top of a lemon slice.  The slight hint of citrus definitely added a nice twist.  Perfect tease for the pallet, awaiting an onslaught of foie after a long day.\n\nWe started with La Folie's famed Foie soup that was mostly a foam and had a uniquely intense, yet somehow light foie flavor.  Very innovative dish.  It came served alongside a 6 oz slab of seared foie gras sitting on glazed baby turnips.  To say we were pleasantly surprised by the portion of foie that was listed as a \"side\" element to the dish is putting it lightly!  What a way to start the meal!\n\nNext came the Torchon of Foie Gras with smoked apple bbq glazed squab and a caramelized onion and strawberry compote.  Not listed on the menu was a square of a peanut butter like substance that the torchon sat upon.  Interesting that it wasn't mentioned, as we all thought it MADE the dish.  Basically envision a PB&J with Foie Gras, the richest and most decadent PB&J ever!  It also came with a tiny brioche bun that made the PB&J comparison hit home even more.  The torchon was creamy and complemented every aspect of the dish perfectly.  This was an Excellent dish!\n\nDish 3 was Scallops topped with Foie Gras, served atop seared yukon gold potatoes with a sherry vinegar, truffle sauce.  The foie was great, but I actually preferred taking it off and enjoying the scallop on its own.  Covered in the foie residue, it was one of the best scallops I've ever had.  The best was yet to come though...\n\nThe Seared Foie Gras with caramelized cherries and aged maple syrup was the single best Foie dish I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Simply AMAZING.  The sear was perfection, leaving a crisp exterior that provided an excellent bite, coupled with the creamy inside.  The sweetness of the cherries and the jus/syrup was a great complement to the rich foie.  Really, really, really good.  And a HUGE portion, 8-9 oz, easily enough for 3 to share.\n\nFinally, the meal finished with a Foie Chocolate Mousse served with a cassis gelee, sponge cake and bacon ice cream.  Solid foie dessert, as the foie paired nicely with the chocolate and cassis.  The sponge cake was good, but a bit dry and, while the bacon ice cream was great, it was very bacony and slightly overpowered the foie flavor.  Good dish.\n\nLa Folie Lounge's Au Revoir Foie menu is a MUST this week if you're a bay area foie gras fan.  You owe it to yourself to enjoy this meal, trust me.  Think we're going back later this week, and no, i'm not kidding...I can be healthy next week!\n\nTonight's a night off, back to it tomorrow...along with some Sauternes, can't wait!", "author": "Jake M."}

My boyfriend and I were headed to Gary Danko for our anniversary dinner and since we were running ahead of schedule he proposed popping into the neighborhood lounge at La Folie. Being that we were dressed up and hadn't tried La Folie (the lounge or restaurant), I was on board! Knowing the pricing at La Folie and having looked at the restaurant tasting menu, I half expected lounge prices to be a pretty accurate reflection of that. \n\nWhen we walked in though, I was surprised. The place wasn't stuffy in the slightest. On the contrary, it's small and pretty casual. Surprisingly so, actually. We were dressed up since we were moving on to a nice dinner, but there were people in jeans there and no one seemed out of place. We opted to sit at the bar, but they have a few sofas and comfy seats to congregate with a group. Drinks weren't cheap, but I thought they were pretty standard for San Francisco: $10 - $12 a pop. We opted to snag an app while we were there, too and went with the truffled deviled eggs per my boyfriend's request. When I looked at the menu, I was actually surprised that they were only $5! So, sooo good. Truffles are clearly the theme here - they use it throughout their menu and you can smell it if you're near the bar. Delish. \n\nTo top it off, the service was super friendly. It never felt stuffy or pretentious (which, admittedly, surprised me in a great way). The bartender also mentioned that you can order off the restaurant menu a la carte! I find the tasting menus a bit much -- and quite the investment -- but it would be a great spot to try some of their food without breaking the bank. We'll definitely be back!", "author": "Shannon E."}

Our server was rude and took forever to stop by our table. I felt she treated us like we were children. Like we've never been in a nice bar or knew anything about alcohol. But when we asked her for a nice cab wine recommendation, she recommended a blended red wine without acknowledging that it was a blend. Since the place was nice, we assumed the servers would actually know their wine. Guess we were wrong. Wine was terrible and only had 20% cabernet in it.  Also to top it off, before we went in, my friend was 10 feet away from the entrance with a vapor and was scolded to not stand there. Later a couple sat right by the windows blowing cigarettes in, and no one bothered them. We even asked to speak to a manager, which was ignored.

A generous portion nicely plated with very crisp croutons, some apples, apple compote and a peanut brittle cake underneath.  You can also order anything off the main restaurant menu, though it may take some time for it to arrive and prices are both high and not listed.  We had the foie gras soup dish - a whipped foie soup paired with a large chunk of seared foie.

Ate less this time since we at least got to try a lot of the items in the menu we wanted to try before, but everything's still good as ever.\n\nThe truffle popcorn is still good, and we actually wound up taking another order of it to go!  Since we only had a month and a half left to enjoy foie gras, we decided to order the seared foie gras that they serve in the restaurant next door (they let you order anything from the regular restaurant a la carte at the lounge).  It is still definitely the largest piece of foie you will ever get served in the city!  The thing must have been at least 8 ounces.  It came with a cherry sauce that went perfectly, especially with the season.  It was $45 a la carte, but so worth it since it was easily at least 3x the size of foie you would get in any other restaurant.\n\nWe probably spent most of our time on the cheese platter and charcuterie platter, and the servings were large enough that this constituted most of our dinner.  The chef was kind enough to walk us through the different choices and help us decide based on our preferences.  We also had the sommelier from next door consult with us on getting a bottle of wine.  Since we had a couple glasses of champagne already in the hotel, at least we figured we'd drink less here but splurge on a nicer bottle.  She helped us pick a really excellent Burgundy that was wonderfully earthy...it has everything I love in a good French wine, and went perfectly with all the food.\n\nFor dessert, I just couldn't resist coming back to the warm chocolate cake (also from next door).

Don't know why exactly since the layout of chairs and sofas are at odd angles so sometimes it's unclear as to who can huddle up where. The people-watching there never disappoints, no matter what you might think of your fellow patrons. Regardless, it's a nice place for drinks with friends or on a date, especially after dinner when things are getting interesting. I've gone there in each situation and been happy with the choice.\n\nDrinks are especially good; I've been on a liquor / cocktail bend recently. If La Folie's chef has to approve the drinks, It wouldn't surprise me. Seeing him stroll around the room with a smile is cool. He sees a lot of happy people, putting down strong cocktails.\n\nTheir music gets louder later at night - probably a good move to continue fueling post-work benders and pushing uptight folks (like myself at times, surely) beyond a relaxed mode into one more lively.\n\nYou might order the popcorn because it's a popular choice. Popcorn is even more addictive w truffle oil. Just know that you'll spill it because the bowl is too small. It looks cool when served, piled high above the rim, but a popcorn bowl's gotta be much larger than the popcorn inside. \n\nDidn't even bother with the popcorn on my last visit. My friend and I ordered the salmon pops, which sound completely bizarre but are interesting, even if they're priced high, perhaps for the labor required. We got four bites of a sushi roll, without rice or seaweed, on popsicle sticks. Then they're placed vertically offset in a custom-made wood serving block, which is kind of interesting if that's your sort of thing. \n\nSo overall, I'd recommend sticking with their food items from the restaurant side of the menu if you want something to eat while drinking up.

One time on a Thursday and one time on a Saturday night. I feel as thought I have ordered enough stuff off the menu to comment on the food, the service and the overall experience. \n\nFrom the get go, I appreciate the $15 valet in front. Trying to go out in Russian Hill can be an exercise in frustration before you even get out of your car, this makes it so easy to say, sure I will meet you in Russian Hill. The service at the valet on both occasions has been professional and quick. Bring cash for that.  \n\nOnce you are in, it's like a well decorated William Sonoma home store or designer show room. The lounge aspect is well executed. It's sophisticated, chic and what you would expect from La Folie. It's not too large and has some great natural light. The room is divided between the bar area and several furniture groups that accommodate larger groups. \n\nIf you sit at the bar, the service is very quick. The menu is easy to navigate and there are so many choices... To cocktail or to wine/champagne is the next big decision. I like the St. Germain cocktail and the rest of the cocktail list looks good. The wine list is reasonably  well edited and the prices seem good for what you get. I also like the immediate water service. I think that all lounge and bars should service water like this with no ice. A great idea. \n\nFood wise, I have tried the pickled veggies (great), the country pate (too fatty for me, should have done the mouse), selection of three cheeses (wonderful but scant on portion), and the ahi tuna tartare (WOW! good). I have seen other things ordered and I want to try them as well as the popcorn which did smell wonderful. Don't come here expecting to skip dinner and eat off the bar menu. It's not really heavy food. \n\nTruthfully, this is a great destination for a girl's night or a date. Don't come here to meet men. They are there but they are all there with dates. I am not on that track but if I was meeting a friend out who wanted to meet men, this is not the place. I also think that folks under 30 may not feel as at home, this is a well heeled, 30+ crowd. \n\nOverall, the service keeps this place from being five star. The bar service is five star but the wait staff is over worked and not able to cover all of the tables in the lounge area  in a manner that is consistent with La Folie. The waiter was great but I had to ask for my drink two times and it took some time to get our check. He also didn't come back to check in on us. I think that La Folie should consider staffing better on busier nights.  I like the chef guy that comes out to explain the plates when they are being delivered to the table. That is a nice touch. \n\nBottom line, worth going to and making a regular desination.  Be prepared to spend about $120 for cocktails and apps, it's not inexpensive but most of the time, really good food isn't cheap", "author": "Amanda J."}

The only reason I am giving it one is because Yelp doesn't allow for zero stars, and the truffle popcorn was really good.\n\nWe are members of Crunch next door, and we had just completed a light workout (we weren't sweaty & smelly). We were about to walk home, but we saw LaFolie Lounge; on a whim, we decided to go in despite how we were dressed. We were dressed in Lululemon, but not stretchy pants i.e. we looked sporty, but were covered up, too. Once inside, people were dressed nicely-business casual, but I didn't think we stuck out too much. The lounge wasn't busy, but it still took our waiter awhile to acknowledge us-we almost walked out then. We ordered glasses of wine-and not cheap wine, either.\n\nI noticed that when most people were about 2/3 finished with their drink, they were being offered an additional glass. prior to that, people were even being asked if they wanted something to eat. Not us.\n\nOnce we finished our wine, it was another 15 minutes before someone came up to us and asked if we'd like something else. It was the lady making the popcorn not even our waiter who, by the way, stared at us at several intervals. She was super nice, and because of that, in addition to seeing a friend of ours,  we ordered popcorn and another glass of wine. Once we finished that, it took our waiter another ten minutes to acknowledge us. So, if he's wondering why he received a low tip, it's the lousy service he gave us.", "author": "Nic Z."}

It was pretty early, about 6.30ish and so upon entering the lounge, I automatically saw how small the place is considering it was packed! The ambiance was very vibrant but the scene, well they're mostly old folks and yes, I agree with other yelpers that most guys were wearing sports coat and that made the guys look older...no offense, that night, most of the guys all had white hair! \n\nAnyway, my sis and I managed to find a table next to the bar in the hallway. Sis went straight to the menu and ordered a bunch of stuff. It was so much that I forgot what we had...though I did really like the cheese plate and their crackers. We tried 2 cocktails but then after, we resorted to just getting glasses after glasses of champagne (I don't know kind but my sis just said it's $25 per glass so I figured its probably the top of their list). \n\nAnyway, it got busier as the night progressed.

I recommend sticking with the lounge's specialities.\n\nThe food: Outstanding bar bites -- think of your usual bar food to nibble on, then add truffle oil and foie gras. Popcorn, tiny hamburgers, mac and cheese, deviled eggs, and more. I haven't had a bite I didn't think was great. The truffle popcorn is my personal favorite.\n\nThe drinks: The food is actually secondary in my motivation for coming here to the cocktails. The bar menu is packed with some of the tastiest drinks I've had. The cucumber caipiroska is the most refreshing drink I've tasted. If I could take a pitcher of it to a beach I would be set for life. The cocktails have a ton of variety so you end up tasting alcohols and flavors you never heard about before and loving all of them.\n\nThe staff: Last but not least, these people love their jobs and love giving you the highest quality food and drinks. These aren't just part-time bartenders and line cooks; these people have dedicated themselves to giving people the best, most knowledgeable service possible.\n\nCome in to start/end a great date, with a friend or with a small group (anything over 6 ppl starts getting outsized).

We arrived 40 minutes early and they easily accommodated us. \nWe ordered 4 courses eac becaus pe we wanted to everything. But their dishes are pretty large so be forewarned. Will do 3 courses next time.\nThe first amuse bouche of the corn in gelee with bacon and microveg on top was delicious. It popped nicely when pressed into. A little rich but the bacon was very tasty.\nThe second amuse bouche (!) was a coddled egg yolk in a squash pur\u00e9e served with a brioche toast. The brioche dipped in the yolk was delicious. Again, a little on the heavy side.\nWe splurged and shared a half ounce of Russian Ossetia caviar. It are on top of Creme fraishe and lobster potato blinis. It was so so delicious. The osetra paired s well with the Creme and the blinks were well seasoned. The lobster cooked just right. Will splurge on this again. If you've never had caviar, this will convert you.\nThe dungenese crab salad on the pea panna cotta does not look like a salad. But it tasted like like. The pea panna cotta was smooth and very pea flavored. The fab was delicious and the paddlefish caviar was a nice salty pairing.\nThe duck egg on top of a sweetbread pancake and topped with fresh truffle shavings is so delicious. Hard to make a deep fried egg but it was good. The truffle shavings are so good! Now I want a truffle of my own! The sweetbreads was tender and moist. Not cooked like at Fleur de Lys. The morel salad was light and tasty.\nThe folie torchon was really really rich. It was a huge piece and could only eat about half. The duck breast was delicious. Won't orde this again though unless I'm sharing with someone else. Too rich.\nThe seared Hudson Valley folie gras was the largest piece I've ever seen. It was prepared excellently. Super delicious with the tart cherry sauce.\nI ordered the beef tenderloin with the bone marrow butter off the chef's tasting menu. The meat was perfectly cooked and the marrow just melts in your mouth. The crispy fried beef tendon was amazing. Wished I had more. The pickled mushrooms were perfect with the richness of the dish.\nThe lamb chops with lamb tongue and butter beans was well cooked,  wished there was more lamb tongue.\nThe lemon verbena taste refresher was delicious and refreshing.\nThe peach Melba baked Alaska was the best. The Earl Grey cake was and the peach sorbet paired so well. The toasted meringue outside was like toasted marshmallow! I was so full but I had to stuff myself. \nThe folie dessert was a little.

The plan was to start the evening there at about 9:30 to enjoy some quality drinks in a classy atmosphere - I mean, wearing a dress in the freezing summer is big deal for most of us city girls. This plan quickly changed about 10 minutes after our party of 15 or so had taken their first sip. My girlfriend had brought a box of beautiful cupcakes she made - not bought - for the birthday girl. This apparently enraged the bartender (male, bald, Italian?? 30's I think), who very rudely and aggressively came over to our table and told my friend that she couldn't have outside food and to keep them closed and out-of-sight. The reasoning? Someone could choke on one and sue the bar. Valid, I guess, but unlikely. \n\nSo, a birthday guest went to try to patch up the situation with the manager at La Folie, who graciously apologized and said the cupcakes could stay. This obviously didn't get communicated to the bartender. One of our (male) friends had taken one bite when the bartender returned and angrily demanded he \"put the cupcake away.\" When he refused, saying he didn't understand why there was still an issue but would just finish it, the bartender reached over to grab the box! In a valiant effort to save the poor cupcakes (yes, go ahead and chuckle - we are actually talking about CUPCAKES here) our friend grabbed the box and cupcakes, truffle popcorn, you-name-it, goes flying. I had to step between the two to stop a full blown fight. You think this would end our classy night at La Folie Lounge, right? Nope - the police showed up. At least no one got arrested, because remember - we are talking about cupcakes. I can't imagine what the judge would say. While this made for an interesting evening, it put a pretty sour taste in my mouth, not even one a cupcake can change. \n\nI truly hope La Folie considers replacing this bartender - for their sake and its patron's.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-28", "description": "A friend & I went here last night to celebrate our double birthdays today. It was my first time here but certainly not the last! This is a beautifully appointed jewel box of a lounge. We sat in the corner near the window on an extremely comfortable leather banquette that I would like to see in my living room. Service wasn't super-prompt, but our waitress was personable and had some good recommendations. We shared four cocktails throughout the evening: two new (Strawberry Fields, St. Germain) and two classic (Blood & Sand and Pisco Sour). Of these, the Strawberry Fields was my favorite (and may be a contender for one of my favorite cocktails all year). It was comprised of gin, basil, and strawberry puree, and had a delightfully fresh herbaceousness that kept it from becomingly overly sweet. I am not a gin drinker but this was freaking delicious. I wanted a little more St. Germain flavor from the eponymous cocktail, but once the ice melted it kinda tasted like spa water thanks to the floating cucumber slice. The classic cocktails were not really that memorable except for the Pisco Sour, which came in a balloon glass with some cool foam art on the egg-white froth.\nOn to the food... we started with the Truffled Deviled Eggs. Three perfect egg halves were presented on a special indented platter, with cornichons and assorted olives. Earthy truffle mingled with creamy egg yolk, which was all set off by the briny trout roe on top. A very good combination of flavors!\nWe then selected two artisanal cheeses to share, a Corsican number called U Pecurinu and Moon Flower from CA. They arrived on a thin slate slab, with some fig mostarda and honeycomb accompaniments. The Corsican cheese was sharp & tangy, which I liked. The description on the Moon Flower was a little misleading though; it was described as a washed-rind cheese which immediately made my ears perk up, but what arrived was semi-hard with a very chewy rind. When I think \"washed-rind\" I think of a softer cheese with an edible rind and an... assertive taste. I liked the taste of it, though it was definitely on the milder side, but was overall disappointed in the selection. Had I known, I would definitely have chosen the Epoisses (because I'm sure in a place like this they have specialized Epoisses spoons!). We had to have some sort of charcuterie so we also ordered the Foie Gras Mousse. Surprisingly, the cute chef brought us what resembled a whole charcuterie board, with lardo-draped crostini, salami, duck prosciutto, and an oversize quenelle of mousse. It was all good, but the highlight was truly the mousse. It was sooo creamy and full of gloriously intense foie flavor, which was only enhanced with the rich peach chutney served alongside. I mowed that stuff down like it was my job :-)\nWe didn't really order dessert, but once they heard birthdays were involved we were in for something special. A petits fours dessert plate topped with two candles was brought over, and included a shard of \"happy birthday\"-inscribed chocolate bark and doubles of the following: perfectly caramelized canneles, mini-madeleines with brandied cherry, sugar-dusted raspberry pates de fruit, and a chocolate-hazelnut ganache square. The canneles were my favorite. It was a completely unexpected gesture that really made the evening stand out, hence the 4th star. Merci beaucoup - I will return!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Stars are for the addition of a classier style lounge ambiance in the 3 block radius.\n\nVery mellow and low-key vibe.  Decor is contemporary (cream leather modern designed loveseats and chairs) and minimalistic...and IMHO, in a rather uninteresting way that  lacks the extra \"pop\" that it should have for the prices it feels worthy to charge.   Its a spot for a pre-post dinner drink with date or friend, definitely not a mingling scene, even at 10:30 on weekend.   \n\nUltra pricey and ultra small portion!!  Normally, SOOO  for the sharing of a small dessert with my date...however, not for a bland tasting cheese souffle that was so small, it was baked/served in an espresso cup--and a small one at that!    The bill for 1.) regular coffee 2.) coffee with amaretto...sans fancy whip cream or garnish  3.)miniscule cheesecake souffle shared by two was $38 pre-tip.  (Hmmmm, yeah, the bitty souffle was $15.) Even if sitting in the LaFolie restaurant, and this dessert followed the meal, I would have been extremely unimpressed, but at least it would have been included in the prearranged price of a multi-course meal...AND I wouldn't have thought of splitting  the tiny thing!  \n\nI have fully enjoyed meals/service/setting in the \"LaFolie\" restaurant, however, they are obviously relying upon the reputation/location of the lounge association with the restaurant in determining their prices and menu.
