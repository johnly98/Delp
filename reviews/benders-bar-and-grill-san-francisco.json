And after I visited the bar for a couple hours, I realized that I really enjoyed this bar. They played heavy metal rock music and there were hipsters. It felt homey and like a nice place to spend time at. You could meet people there if you tried. There's an outdoor patio. I had 2 crispy tacos, which were okay, but not stellar. And it took a million years for them to bring them to me after I ordered. The bartenders are cool. I was with 3 guys. I liked the atmosphere. It was better than the Knockout for sure. I would come back to this bar. It's more than a dive and the experience is fun.", "author": "Denise C."}

Pretty chill place, lots of regulars sitting at the bar chatting up the bartender. There's a jukebox, but no one was using it, so the bartender was choosing songs from it. He was playing some good Sunday jams. Mostly Motown stuff. My husband had the burger with a side of mac n cheese and said it was really good. I had the totchos and they were good, but there was a taste I wasn't expecting on them. I think it may have been curry? It didn't mention curry on the menu, so I'm not 100% sure that was the seasoning, but there was definitely a flavor that I wasn't anticipating on totchos.

Except I'm a walking calamity. Trying to walk in heels, I looked like a baby giraffe in roller skates and ended up with several sprained ankles.\n\nThese days, comfort is everything (I haven't worn heels in yeeaaars) and happy hours are a rarity. But, some days, you just need to cut lose and just don't GAF about having to impress those cute men in suits. Well, because there are none in Mission dive bars.\n\nI was in The Mission at an appointment when my friend met up with me and said, he was hungry. I had Tater Tot with me and saw Bender's Bar on my nearby bookmarks: full bar, dog-friendly, and grub so we headed there.\n\nBender's is CASH ONLY but they have an ATM inside. As others have mentioned, Bender's is a smaller version of Zeitgeist but without the douchewad employees. The female bartender (blonde with sleeve tats) is super sweet and the guy with the ponytail at the Counter Offer is super friendly (he pet TT and showed us pics of his friend's Pomeranian). \n\nIt's divey and dark which means everyone looks good in dark lighting after a couple of dranks. There's a pool table, juke box, small outdoor patio, and a photobooth ($5): http://bit.ly/2dqAzXS. The crowd was from all walks of life: hipsters, grunge, skaters, millennials, and a handful of techies. \n\nFor dranks, I stuck with my usual Hendrick's Tonic. The bartender made me one stroooonnng one that was only $8! Yah, so very cheap drinks. \n\nTo accompany those strrooooonnnng dranks, you must try the food at the Counter Offer, a food counter at the right side of the bar. On the menu are fried pickles, chicken wings, burgers (including a doggie burger), fried chicken biscuit, mac & cheese, crispy tacos, and fried \"f*ckin'\" oreos. Burger menu: http://bit.ly/2eVim5o. They also have a \"Burger of the Week\" and this week is \"The Elvis\" with peanut butter and bacon. \n\nMy friend ordered the Hand Dipped Corn Dog ($5) which was a special of the day: http://bit.ly/2eKA0sW. It was one loooonng, girthy dog. The polish sausage was juicy, and not overly salty which was perfect with the sweet corn batter. \n\nWe each ordered the Bent Burger w/ bacon, american cheese, preserved jalape\u00f1os, louie sauce, L.P.O, tater tots ($14): http://bit.ly/2ea12bj. This is what dive bar burger dreams are made of. It was incredibly juicy (not a frozen patty) and had great layers of flavors from the salty bacon, melty cheese, tangy and spicy jalapenos, and animal spread-type sauce. The burger was cooked to order (medium rare) and the warm, toasted sesame bun held everything together...but not for long because that patty is juicy AF. It's a messy burger and I had beef juices running down the sides of my hands but what great burgers aren't. It's accompanied with perfectly crunchy tater tots. \n\nTater Tot got a Chester Burger ($2): http://bit.ly/2emA6V9 and was a happy camper.\n\nWhen I returned to the bar for another round of drinks, an overly friendly drunk techie walked up to me and said, \"Hey, HR lady!\" He told me how he's making a point to tell people one \"hot\" thing about them. \n\nWhat did I tell you about THAT lighting!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

She proceeded to rant and curse at us very aggressively because she believed us to be tech scum, ruining \"her city\". Honestly if I had been by myself or with less people I would have felt pretty unsafe given her extremely angry attitude. \n\nI understand that this is not really in the control of the owners of the bar but I just want to warn others.

They were offering Jameson and ginger for $4.  They have a rusty old metal sign that says Metal Rules.  They have a pool table and photo booth.\n\nTheir dark ceiling is adorned with dollar bills.  Their food is orgasmic.  Bar food...orgasmic?  Yup.  \n\nMy friend and I scooted up to the grill that serves the food (it is located in the back).  A young guy named Sean was sitting there and offered us chips out of his chip basket.  We decided to order a snack so we ordered the mac and cheese.  And oh how happy we were that we did so.  The mac and cheese is to DIE FOR.  Best part is that they sell a grilled cheese sandwich that they stuff with the mac and cheese.  You need this.  Anywho as we were eating our mac and cheese we started to hear the long, slow whine of a siren.  \"Ohmygawd is that a tsunami warning??\" my friend asked in a panic.  \"Nah\", Sean said, cool as a cucumber, \"that's just the beginning of a Tupac song\".  Come to find out Sean says he is the owner of the grill.  Really??  \n\nI was originally brought to Bender's thanks to the Noise Pop festival who hosted their happy hours here.  And thanks to them I got to see a lot of amazing, FREE bands like the band Kitten I recently started following.  I have a feeling Kitten is going to blow up so I'm glad I could say I first saw them at Bender's.  The stage at Bender's is small so any show you see here will be very, very intimate.  And very, very, very loud.  \n\nOf course this type of place is hipsters central.

To my surprise this is a pretty laid back, inexpensive fun time. It seems like they have a little something for everyone; 2 pool tables, 1 gaming machine (poker and a few other games), a pin ball machine and karaoke. \n\nSomething we all found a bit strange was after a 2 hour set up time for the equipment to get the karaoke set up all of these 30-40year old women came out of nowhere and pretty much took over the bottom quarter of the food area to dance and prep themselves to sing. There were some pretty entertaining dance moves. By that I mean it was like watching dancing muppets, flailing inflatable tube men and possibly some pantomiming of an electrocution. Yeah! Funny if nothing else.\n\nThe CONS:\n- the \"karaoke\" area is a 5ft wide, 3ft deep top step of a divider between the pool table area and the \"cafe\". It makes it a bit difficult to move when the place is full. It would make more sense to have it in an corner where no one has to bump the singer and their backs are closer to a wall. \n\n- the cushion on the benches are deteriorating and there's giant dips when you go to sit. \n\n- some of the very interesting tables have giant holes where the plastic has been burnt away. \n\nAnywho, beyond some random little interior issues this is a really good spot to meet up with friends and have fun.", "author": "Jennifer F."}

You've been to places like this before. Right?\n\nI was here several times for happy hours related to the NoisePop 2013 festival, and it's an okay place -- your typical dive bar. Seating is very limited, so most people had to stand. \n\nThe really great thing about this joint is the little kitchen tucked around the corner. I helped one of the guys working there with his chalkboard menu, and he rewarded me with a helping of their macaroni and cheese. OMG. It's an orgasm in a bowl, one of the best things I've ever eaten. Normally, I avoid carbs, but in this case, I couldn't stop; it was that good. \n\nAnd as if that weren't enough, to have the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted, they also stuff it into a grilled cheese sandwich. Someone gave me a bite, and wow, just wow. I think I almost fell in love with him just because he had the good sense to order well. Wow. So if you go there, you owe it to your taste buds to try the grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with mac and cheese. Your waist will forgive you later. \n\nOkay, so I'm not much of a drinker...Blah, blah, blah...They serve beer and a shot for a special happy hour price, they have lots of beers on tap, a full bar, blah, blah, blah.

Bender's is a good one.\n\nFirst, let me say that the place is *huge*. As in enormous. There were easily 50+ people there and still there was enough room to swing at least three cats.\n\nThe bartender when I went seemed nice enough; not sure what's up with all the people complaining about surly service.\n\nDrinks are cheap and (if you get a mixed drink) generously poured. Tap selection is on par for what you'll find in SF these days, mostly micros with the el cheapo PBR (of course) thrown in.\n\nThe food setup is a bit odd. There's one guy making food and he'll take four or five orders before telling everyone to go away until he's done cooking that round, at which point you have a chance of being one of the next five orders. I lucked out and walked up exactly as he was getting ready for more, so I got food quickly. Others not so much.\n\nOnce I got food it was awesome. Tater tots (yes, tater tots are totally making a comeback, and I love it) were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and just the right amount of salty. Burger was cooked well, the cheese was all melty, and the toppings and bun held up and didn't distract.\n\nBottom line: Bender's is a good place to have a burger and some cheap drinks.", "author": "Sam K."}

To side note that: if you do happen to be brave enough to utter it in my direction (with that tone) I will take you down. \n\nAfter I located my friends and dropped off my various loads of paraphernalia, I made my way back over to the bar to get a drink.  I was enchanted by the hundreds of pieces of origami hanging from the ceiling and side noted it; \"to take a picture of\" for later. \n\nI was then rudely cut off by a guy whose drink order was apparently much more important than my own.  The bartender saw him do it and threw him a bit snark accordingly.  She carded me, called me \"Sweety\" and poured my drink quickly.\n\nIt was interesting because the drink I was handed at that point was nothing like the other two drinks I was handed subsequently afterward.  They got bigger and stronger but the price stayed the same.\n\nMy \"take a picture of the origami\" side note sailed away somewhere in the first few sips of rum/rum/rum/rum/rum & coke #3.\n\nThe tables are really cool; ours was various drivers licenses suspended in epoxy resin.  I befriended the table next to us (full of guys) as the night progressed.  As I pulled out various colors of play doh and then cards & chips - one of them remarked, \"How many games do you have in there?\"  He totally tried to help me cheat by telling me where to put my hand when drawing \"champagne toast\" with my eyes closed. I know it's \"effed up\" to have to draw it without looking Mr. Befriend, but those are the rules.\n\nMy favorite part: I had to charade \"Rags to Riches\".

Pretty good dive bar feel.  You walk in, and there's a bar on your left, maybe 10 stools or so.  Straight ahead is a pool table, with plenty of room around it, so no need for weird shots or angles.  To the right (behind a wall dividing it from the bar) is a food counter, with maybe another half-dozen seats, and some small tables around it.  In the last quadrant, there's a small stage with some room behind it, include a pinball machine.  There was some stuff out back past the pool table, but I never made it that far . . . \n\nI had a pretty good night here, eating my burrito, having some Tecates, playing some pinballl, and shooting some pool.  Slightly bad experience in that I got skipped on the pool table, but that kind of stuff happens at a bar.  The dive bar experience was definitely punctuated by the fact that when ordering the Tecates, they pop the tab, and also punch it with an old school can punch opposite the opening.  While I'm too old to be chugging Tecates or Pabst, the little triangle hole definitely adds character.\n\nCan't comment on the food, as we brought in burritos for elsewhere.  Still, pretty cool that they serve food, and have no issues with bringing in outside food.", "author": "Ernie C."}

I don't care about your arguments of \"yeah, but if it's not crowded into the bathroom stalls it means it's not popular\".  Screw popularity.  I'm not looking for a \"happening scene\" where I can bolster my hopes of getting laid and check out all of the supercool fashion, be it hipster or metrosexual.

I ordered two Jameson shots with Pabst backs and a Stella.  The waitress charged me for the drinks and after I took them back to the table, I realized we were short one Pabst.  I went back to the bar and reminded her I'd ordered two beers.  She said she'd given me two beers.  The missing beer wasn't at our table, in my hand, or on the counter, so I asked her if I could get another beer.  She replied she already gave me two.  No voices were raised.  Okay, here's where it gets interesting.\n\nA shortish, short hair young man with a beard pulls out two Pabst and shoves them in front of me and says:  \"Here, take your free fucking beer!\"  I said nothing took one of the two beers and, without comment, went back to the table by the front door.  At least now we had two Pabst.\n\nAbout 3 minutes later the same bearded bartender came from behind the bar and up to our table for the first time.  I said \"that was uncalled for.  I didn't mind paying for the second Pabst and I wasn't being rude.\"  He put his elbows on our table looked me in the eye with a smile and said \"Well, you got a free fucking beer out of it.\" I turned to my friends (we were nervous at this point), and I we agreed to drink these and leave.\n\nSo another few minutes go by, and the bartender comes back a second time to our table.  Again, he puts his elbows on the table and his face uncomfortably close to mine.  I say nothing and he says to me, again with a big, threatening smile and close to my face says:  \"So, how's that free fucking beer?!\" I said to him \"If you're threatening me I'm going to call the police.  He said \"Go right ahead!\"  I started to call the police, but thought better of it.\n\nThen, a few minutes later he arrived a third time at our table.  Same posture, smile, menacing--everything--and he says: \"So, where are your police?!\"\n\nAt this point, he leaves the bar to go outside.  My girlfriend gets up from the table and follows him outside and tries to reason with him and to calm him down. She was out there for about 10 minutes.  I was worried for her safety as well as mine--even just trying to leave--and at this point called 911 for potential violence at Benders on 19th and So. Van Ness.\n\nAs the three of us were standing outside, I told my girlfriend we were leaving.  As he turned to go back in the bar, he made one more comment to me about calling the police and headed back into the bar.\n\nA little about me:  I'm 50.  I have a job that pays me well.  I wear a long sleeve shirt, slacks, shoes, and I'm not about to get into a fight with anyone--not over anything. Not even over a $2 Pabst Blue Ribbon.  I was never rude to my original female bartender (even though we only got one beer).  She and I could have settled it ourselves.

So to be accosted by one of their employees who honestly looked like he was on something pretty much just ruined the spot for me.\n\nOn the other hand I have to say that the bouncer didn't get out of line, and one of the other bus boys came out to smooth things over, so that was nice.  But the fact the guy who tried to start a fight came to the door to try and talk shit (while standing behind the bouncer) while i stood around having a smoke waiting for my friends to come out, just showed poor class.

The nicest group of people I've been around in a long time. \n\nThe Crowd: \nThere were a couple of douche bags but that's hardly the bar's fault. There was one large girl dressed up in some kind of Mrs. Santa outfit that threw up an elbow and body checked me, almost knocked me down, to get to the bar before I did. There was also some crazy longhaired bearded guy that reeked of Old Spice. He took off his shirt and started amoeba dancing and rubbing into people. He was talked to several times and finally thrown out. \n\nThe Band: \nThe Bass and Drums were solid the two guitars were awful. They were sloppy and the tones were ear splitting and shrill. I couldn't help having the feeling that they didn't usually play together. They played mostly cover songs and the few originals they played had every musical clich\u00e9 imaginable.\n\nI hope to check this place again but they usually charge a cover and I refuse to pay to drink in a bar.

I have been on this pinball binge for the last month or two, so I thought I would check yelp for bars with pinball. Benders looked promising from the reviews I read, so we hopped in a cab and headed over. \n\nMy first impression of the place was not much. It had a very small bar that made it difficult to order a drink, my drink was very weak. From my calculations, I figure it contained 1/2 oz to 3/4 oz of actual booze. Cheap! I don't complain, I just switch to bottled beer for my second drink. \n\nWe played pinball for a while, finished our drinks, and headed out for a quick smoke. When we returned, a table was set up and a guy at the door was asking for money for a cover charge. We mentioned that we were in here earlier and we just stepped out for a smoke. He said that was cool and let us in.\n\nWe get a couple more drinks and go back to the pinball. While I am deep into my game, a woman comes up to me and my boyfriend and says to us, \"Because you didn't pay any cover charge you two will have to leave, and if you don't leave in five minutes, we're going to have to trow you out.\" Wow! SHE ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS--THROW US OUT! \n\nIt is worth mentioning at this point that the two of us are always good customers. We tip very well. We are polite and curtious whereever we go. And on this occasion, we were sober too. I cannot for the life of me figure out why they would threaten to kick us out. And the funny thing is, nobody even told us how much the cover charge was. Maybe if that woman had any business sense in her head, she would have asked us nicely to pay $10 or whatever amount it was to stick around, we most likely would have.

How we ended up here was mere coincidence as we were headed to Mission Chinese.  However one of our friends with keen eyesight (yet ironically the only member of our group with glasses) spotted their chalkboard with the magical words Grilled Macaroni and Cheese Bacon Sandwich.  How could we not enter and find out the greatness of this sandwich?  What we weren't ready for was the perfect dive bar type atmosphere that came alone with it.  The bar is strewn with cool kitchy stuff to look at as you slam back drinks when waiting for your meal. There's pinball, pool, and a photo booth.  The booth it seems ends up having most of the photos pinned up at the bar so you can have an immediate place in the history of the place.  One major moment I wanted to mention was the bartender.  Automatically with his Australian accent he was better than half the bartenders I'd ever met in my 20+ years of drinking. But on top of that he was one of the nicest and honest bartenders as well.  I had accidentally over paid my round of drinks by about 25 dollars and he made sure to get back the proper amount of money before accepting a tip.  For that alone we tipped him an extra 5 on top of what we already gave him.  He could have easily walked away with all of it but he immediately went against that.  That moment alone solidified our return next time we were in the area.  If that wasn't enough the sandwich that we so desired arrived and it was as advertised.  It was simply amazing. It was a shame we only ordered one to split with the 4 of us but we didn't want to ruin our appetites.

How can one complain?\n\nLocated on the block following my best friend's apartment, it seems only natural we'd end up here eventually although she was a bit reluctant in that the previous times she'd been by there had been a $8-10 cover charge. I urged her on anyway with the promise we'd split if there was a cover but in fact, there wasn't. There was however, a pretty burly punk rock door guy though who didn't hesitate to card us. In fact, we were carded a second time by the bartender- a long haired rocker, who could have easily been a double for Sebastian Bach. For many, the double carding may have been annoying, but for moi,  who turns 30 this year, I'll happily take these requests as compliments. \n\nMore cool stuff about Bender's: \nIt's really spacious. We had no problem finding several seating options. A nice long sparkly (literally) bar with comfy short backed bar stools, pool tables, another room where the fryer station and a smaller second bar are located with some pretty awesome tables featuring tabletops made out of real confiscated fake IDs. \nAgreeable crowd made up of a random mix of the local younger 20's set, mid-aged punks, and normals.  \nThey offer the same fried pickles served at Weird Fish. We actually had ordered them at dinner before we hit up Benders and I can honestly say, they rule!\nAs previously mentioned, they have a sweet jukebox!

After moving to the Mission, I lamented the loss of Molotov's and Cafe du Soliel as evening watering holes, but then I found Bender's.  Think Molotov's with nicer bartenders and about 8x more space, seating, and an outdoor area (oh and let's not forget fewer hipsters).  \n\nWhen you walk into Bender's, you're reminded of any old dive bar, save the killer decor, but it has a bar with a bunch of stools and then a series of small high tables with high chairs across from the bar.  Then you walk to the end of that area and you realize Bender's is so much more.  If you take a right at the end of the bar, you find yourself in a comfortable sitting area where movies are often projected on the wall - though with the jukebox on, it would be a miracle to hear it.  If you continue straight up the 4 steps at the end of the bar you find yourself in the pool area, it only has 2 tables, but plenty of room to shoot and plenty of seating to watch the shooters.  \n\nContinue back past that and you find yourself in an enclosed outdoor area with 2 picnic tables.  Great for those of us who smoke.  Also, they allow dogs, which given I take my puppy just about everywhere (save the office), is a huge draw.  \n\nThey also do free BBQ on Sunday afternoons, and the Wednesday special (Whiskey Wednesdays) a shot of whiskey & a beer for $5.00 can't be beat.\n\nDefinitely one of the cooler places in the Mission - though watch out for some of the guys there (especially greasy ones in track suits) they can be a little drunk and pretty aggressive.", "author": "Alison L."}

It's unfortunate that the bar lies on the wrong side of Mission St., as it doesn't benefit from much foot-traffic, but that's also a blessing. The crowd is as unpretentious as clams. Ample seating - I don't think I have ever had to stand. They generally have two pool tables running (unless they have live music; then they only have one going) and the tables are both in fine condition. They have some pinball if you are into that kind of thing, along with a photo booth that mildly offensive people take to making out in. The jukebox is skewed towards loud noisy punk, but it fits in with the overall vibe. I would say, however, that the jukebox is a weakness. They have been having DJs recently on Fridays, playing Delirium-style music. There is a free BBQ on Sunday - the quality of the food is definitely indicative of the fact that it's free, but then again, it is free. There has also been this guy cooking brats and what not for people late at night, but I don't know if he'll be a regular or not. He charges money, though. The backyard patio for smoking closes pretty early (9PM, I think) so don't get too excited about that. The bartenders are all friendly, and the drinks are cheap - $2 PBR & Tecate, and they have a $5 bike messenger special, which nets you a can of the aforementioned potabilities and a shot of whiskey. You might have to show a bike key to qualify for this, however, or else simply be charming enough to convince the bartender you are worthy of such a bargain. Overall, Bender's has huge potential due to its similarities to Zeitgeist & Kilowatt (no surprise, given the common ownership, I believe) and it's also been seeming increasingly popular with the kids lately.", "author": "Max H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-25", "description": "I give this place 4 stars for being Benders, but 2 stars for being Benders on the night they hosts Burlesque simply because this is a bar, not a venue.  See... venues have seating and room and places to like, BE and breath and drink.  Bars, when trying to be a venue are very very very crowded with no place to sit, or for that matter stand, breath, drink, etc.  Since burlesque only happens once a month, and even if you are unfortunate enough to go there on that night, there are burlesque performers hanging around in their pasties, I bumped it back up to 4 stars.  Benders is good at being a hip dive bar with really strong drinks.  There's a tiny back patio with an occasional free BBQ where burgers are handed out in order of attractiveness of the burger eater according to the burger maker.  We refer to it as Zeitgeist Jr except on the days when we are feeling less charitable, then we call it Zeitgeist Wannabe.", "author": "Cosmolicious L."}

Anyway, there was this lovely bartender lady who I can't remember her name, and I'M SORRY for that!!!  But she remembered me, and I remembered her, as we had a mutual friend TEDD who is no longer with us, and that's really weird, because I also know Rosa the dancer through Tedd too, so anyway, enough with the weird connections.  I totally loved this bar, and even more so because the door boy was so WASTED that he let us in for less than the price of the cover, since I was short on cash.  End of the story is I love Benders, I love Rosa, and I love the lovely bartender who remains nameless, but I never forget a face.  She used to work at the place next to Holy Cow on Folsom that has changed names many times over too, Ace Cafe?? Someon help me out here if you know her name, cuz I was a little drunky poo.... but I will be back!  Oh yeah, who ever heard of 2 Gene Simmons dudes on stage at the same time?  That was a real treat.", "author": "Barbra K."}
