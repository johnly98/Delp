It's so spicy that the staff warns people when ordering. When there was a Ramen Underground location in Japantown I lived going there for that.\n\nOtherwise the ramen itself is okay but not great compared to other places I go to. There's not much meat included, just a few pieces of sliced chicken.\n\nAlso on the menu it says there's a $0.35 fee if paying by credit card. When I came back for the first time several weeks I didn't see it and was unaware until I got the bill for signature when I saw it was added. This past week when I visited again I charged anticipating the fee (figuring I still come out ahead after my credit card reward),  but it wasn't added. So don't know if that fee is still in place or I lucked this past time.", "author": "H K."}

Just a little chewy and more on the well done side. The broth was okay. Not oily or creamy enough for a tonkatsu, but it was seasoned well. More like a rich chicken broth than a pork bone one.

Worst of all, we asked for our kimchi to be put on the side, but as the server put our bowls down in front of us, he was like, \"sorry, we forgot to put it on the side,\" as in, \"oops we know something is wrong with your bowl but oh well we just can't be bothered to take 10 seconds to scoop it out and make it right.\" \n\nThe bathroom hallway reeks, probably because - surprise - the filthy trash bins are right there. Lovely way to cap off your meal. Oh and if you didn't know, this place has scored a 70 health rating (FAIL) within the last year and a half, something i was surprised to have read on SFGate recently.

It was a good sign that the place was full later in the afternoon on a Friday, so we waited about 5-10 min before sitting against the window. \n\nThe menu has a lot of different types of ramen, but the topping selection is not as extensive as others. I got the miso and my friends got the tonkatsu/spicy tonkatsu. The noodles were very good - a bit chewier texture that I really like. However, we found the broth to be a bit salty compared to other places. On the wall, they do have a small illustration with instructions on how to eat/order, and they do recommend getting a bowl of rice to put in the ramen, so perhaps that is the way to go to counteract the salt.

So I thought i would investigate this secret Ramen place and see what it had to offer.\n\nI came here at 4:30pm for an early dinner and it was completely empty sans a handful of customers. The place is actually pretty small as described by some Yelpers, so be prepared to cozy up next to your fellow ramen-lovers. I have been in smaller and more cramped-up ramen restaurants during my time in LA, so the seating here was no problem for me. \n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was very disappointing to say the least. I add-ed on a side of corn and the pork belly. The broth tasted very fatty, not in a good way. While I liked the noodles served here, the bbq pork and the pork belly were chewy and didn't look presentable. The pork belly was nor tender of flavorful. I would have liked it better too if it was sliced in half. You also have the option of adding extra noodles for a dollar, BUT you have to order it when you order your ramen. Otherwise, the noodles will cost two dollars if you add-on later. \n\nService was attentive, but maybe that's because there were only two additional single diners and one waitress. I would hate to see what it is like during the lunch/dinner rush. During my meal, one of the workers started rolling out dirty garbage and recycle cans out the front door to the curb, that's a major NO-NO in my book. \n\nWith my tonkotsu ramen plus two side add-ons, I was looking at a bill of almost $20 (including tip) per person. A small bowl of ramen with mediocre broth and meat for $20? No, thank you. I can't imagine even waiting in a 15-20 minute line during rush hour for that same bowl of ramen. During whole dining experience here, I felt I was getting nickel-n-dimed here. Without the add-ons, I felt my bowl of ramen would have been very bare.

I also liked the decor much more in Japan town. I used to love their ramen because it tasted very healthy and they didn't add to many random things. A few years back the japan town location closed all of a sudden. I went with friends and we stood in front of a closed restaurant and many other people as well that traveled from the other side of gg bridge just to eat there. I moved to L.a and had a lot of ramen there but I was very excited to come back to SF and have underground ramen again. We went to the downtown location and to my surprise there wasn't a huge line like normally, we got a seat right away. We ordered and to our surprise they no longer offered mushrooms! I have never heard of anything like this before in any restaurant. We asked why and they told us that customers didn't liked them. Ok.. we got our ramens and the where ok. I asked for the red Japanese spice, but they only had the red peppers that you put on pizza not the powder like they used too. I was a bit disappointed. This used to be my favorite ramen place. Now I feel it is really to pricy for what it is. Toppings are very expensive as well. I know sf is an expensive city but I feel it is to much for broth and some noodles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-19", "description": "Only recently I discovered the joy of good ramen & specifically, tonkotsu broth. Apparently I'm late to the party, so I've been doing my best to catch up. I've eaten ramen at 5 different restaurants in the last few months.\n\nSpoiler alert: best ramen? Ramen Underground.\n\nI honestly can't believe all the nit-picky reviews. What do you people expect? Ramen on gold platters? Ramen made out of unicorns? Where are you getting better ramen? Seriously tell me because I want to eat it!\n\nRecently went to Ippudo that just opened in Soma. It was good, but imo, not as good as Ramen Underground -- and way more expensive to boot. But it's good if you enjoy an extra helping of pretension with your food.\n\nWent to Ryujin Ramen in Sacremento. It was excellent and priced more reasonably, however I still think Underground would edge it out if they went head-to-head. However I guess Ryujin would be a better value because it was much cheaper.xt\n\nLast place I had ramen recently was in Oakland when I was sick. I can't really compare it because they made me an order to-go when they don't normally do that and it was missing some key elements (uhh like chashu).\n\nAlso I usually go to Ramen Underground after the lunch rush (around 1:30 or 2), and never have to wait long (ten minutes max). Then once we're seated, I've been amazed at how quickly they slam out orders. We sit, order, and have our food in under 5 minutes every time. I've been there maybe 4-5 times now.\n\nAnyway here's what makes Ramen Underground really stand out:\n\n*TONKOTSU*\nFirst off, I don't really understand ramen without tonkotsu broth. It doesn't make sense to me. Second, the tonkotsu at Ramen Underground is truly outstanding. Creamy, flavorful with great mouthfeel and so much umami it could break the internet.\n\n*PORK BELLY*\nEvery (other) place I've ordered ramen has mentioned pork belly on the menu. Maybe they mean they make chashu out of pork belly? I'm not sure. But when I get ramen other places, it always comes with 2 thin slices of chashu (round-ish slices of pork). But at Ramen Underground, it comes with 2 slices of chashu AND 2 cubes of pork belly. You read that right. FOUR PIECES OF DELICIOUS MELT-IN-YOUR MOUTH PORK. \n\nI always add an egg (their eggs are consistency of medium-boiled) and spicy paste.\n\nIf you REALLY need to overdose on richness, add miso to your broth. Good god, it's almost too rich to finish that way.\n\nI'm sure I don't really know how to evaluate ramen noodles properly. But it's definitely because I'm too distracted by the broth & the pork. If other reviewers have problems with the noodles, I can neither confirm nor deny. But I will stand by my evaluation of the broth & pork till death. Which will be much sooner thanks to all this bone broth & pork.\n\nThanks for reading and I'll see you at Ramen Underground.\n\nEDIT: Worth noting that the ramen here ain't cheap. It's 2nd most expensive behind Ippudo. ~$16 for me typically.", "author": "Steve H."}

Total is about $17 after tipping. Some people have complained that you get fewer ingredients at Ramen Underground for the same price. It's true that the ramen bowl here is pretty basic. Standard bowls come with just chicken/pork, spinach, and onions; there is no egg, which is a deal-breaker for some people (I personally think the egg is overcooked in a lot of the ramen shops). \n\nHowever, the broth here is delicious! I'm not into super-creamy soup bases, and I think this place can do broth just right. It's flavorful without being overly-filling. The spicy miso ramen also has just the right amount of spice. For that, I can forgive the lack of egg and 2 squares of seaweed that people seem to care so much about. \n\nThis place is tiny though. Tables are big enough for just you and a lunch buddy. Any more than that and you'll probably have to wait for the bar area to free up (which is pretty uncomfortable to sit at because the counter-top is so high). From what I've seen, this place is packed from 12-1pm, so I recommend coming here before noon.\n\nTL;DR - Good, basic ramen with tasty broth; not good for large groups; come early.", "author": "Taylor K."}

I used to live in the city and would eat here almost every weekday for lunch.  Now that I live out of state, I make sure this is my first stop every time I get to come back for a visit.  I have yet to find a restaurant anywhere else that comes close to the flavors I get here.  My favorite thing to order is the spicy miso ramen.  I love the dumplings (pot stickers) they put in.  The spicy miso is the perfect level of spice, enough to feel a kick, but not so much that that is all you taste.  The wait staff is great, too.  Most of the time you will have to wait for a table, but it is definitely worth it.  And once you're inside, you get served pretty quickly.", "author": "Megan M."}

The prices are a little more steep than I've experienced,but I figured it's because they're located in the smack middle of FiDi on Kearny competing with other lunch joints in the area. What I find a little funny about this place is that their basic toppings are a little out of the ordinary, especially the spinach and mushroom. They don't include an egg in basic toppings! (extra egg is +1.50) :(. I usually end up ordering an egg and corn to add in the bowl.\n\nThe thing here is that the portions are HUGE. They aren't cheap about the noodles and the broth is pretty good. They generally use MSG free chicken broth which isn't very common, but some people like it. I tried their tonkotsu ramen the other day and the first time I had their miso. Not bad, but I wouldn't come out of my way here. They do offer tsukemen though! I'll definitely be trying that next time.\n\nExpect to spend about $15-$18 for a good bowl of ramen.

Came here based on the recommendations of my coworkers, but definitely did not get the hype. Ramen is supposed to be many things - hearty, warm, satisfying, rich. It's not really supposed to be healthy, which is what Ramen Underground tries to do, sucking away everything that makes ramen so enjoyable. Either that or they're just being cheap with ingredients. \n\nI got the tonkatsu ramen because it came with pork. Otherwise, standard toppings are spinach, mushroom, and chicken. Extra toppings such as egg cost anywhere from $1 to $2.50, and you can quickly spend $20 just trying to get a decent bowl of ramen. \n\nBroth was watery and lacked the rich pork flavor of tonkatsu. Noodles were okay, but on the hard side. Toppings were a disappointment - I put spinach and raw mushrooms in salad, not my ramen. The pork slices were hard and too salty, with none of the melt in your mouth tenderness you expect. The only saving grace was the kakuni pork, which was savory, creamy, and delicious. However, the piece was tiny, not the long strip of meat I've gotten at other ramen shops. \n\nTop it off with a crazy long line, and you have over-hyped, expensive, not tasty ramen.", "author": "Hali M."}

The soft-boiled egg was nice and runny. The fatty chashu melted apart in my mouth, but I could have used a couple more slices. The flavors of the kakuni cubes also bled nicely into the broth. It was topped with spinach leaves and sliced button mushrooms. I'm not used to button mushrooms, nor am I a fan of them. Also, the spinach looked like it was thrown on top as an afterthought as opposed to being cooked in the broth. As much as I enjoyed slurping all the noodles, I felt it was considerably saltier than most bowls of ramen.\n \nI give this bowl of ramen a 7/10. If I could lower the level of salt and swap out the mushrooms for some bamboo shoots instead, then it would be more of a solid 4/5, but I'll round up.\n\nNow I haven't actually dined at this location, because there's always a ridiculous line at lunch. Another deterrent is their cash-only policy. When ramen costs about $12-$14 per person, I don't see why they can't just operate with a credit card terminal.

Something that I like about this place is that they have different broths to choose from. They have chicken, vegetable, and tonkotsu. Most places just have the regular tonkotsu or pork broth, but I don't really eat pork all that much so this was a great alternative. I ended up ordering the Spicy Miso Ramen with an egg ($1.50 extra) and organic tofu ($1). It also comes with chicken, green onion, mushroom and spinach. The ramen was average not awful, nothing too special. I could barely taste the spicy miso, I should have gotten the Habanero Ramen.

Since it was hot inside we decided to take the table close to the door so we can feel any type of breeze coming in.\n\nOn this particular day I was with a friend and we decided to order some ramen.  I take a quick glance on the menu and I usually order the tantan  ramen, it was unfortunate but I did not see the ramen available.  But it's ok I'm a mad genius and will find a way to make this bowl spicy.  My buddy ordered his tonkotsu chicken bowl and I get the tonkotsu pork with extra pork and a hard boiled egg. Before I go and modify my ramen I decided to take a small taste test of the ramen.  I must say this is a light tasting ramen.  The simplicity of the ramen is here but I did not get something to separate this ramen from any other ramen place I have been to.\n\nWe finish our bowl and left this place.  We only wish that the a/c would have been working  during the odd days where it's to close to 100.  If your in a hurry and want some ramen this place will serve you quickly.

While other places have taken the last five years to make ramen a big more precious while it rode the food trend wave, this spot doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, you have a lot of load-in options with veggies, meats, flavors and styles. Kudos for the creativity. But it's not served up in some fancy boat of deconstructed made-for-photo earthenware over pomp and circumstance. Nope, it's just ramen in a bowl.\n\nI can definitely dig the simple and no-frills approach. It came a long with a hefty bit of efficiency, too. I got my soup quick (I've never understood what could take a long time with soup at restaurants--it's been stewing for a day or two... it's ready!) and I have to give them props for that. Flavor, however, was kind of a disappointment. I had a bowl of pretty straightforward tonkotsu and it really could have used more flavor, more seasoning, and more body. It seemed pretty thin. Maybe it would be better to go with something bold here like the haba\u00f1ero miso that I've read about? I finished the bowl a little disappointed, but I finished it nonetheless.

Too much hype, too trendy looking and poor reviews usually bodes poorly for a restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.\n\nChicken gyoza - 2/5 - Average gyoza. Would probably pass on this in the future.\nSpicy Miso Ramen - 4/5 - I would have liked to have ordered the habanero broth, but I feel obligated to try anything that makes the 7x7 list. The broth was rich and tasty and the noodles were decent enough. I'll say that this making the list is acceptable to me.\n\nOptions - 5/5 - I really liked the choices that were available to customize the ramen here. There was a good amount of broth choices, as well as the usual topping options. I went with added char siu, pork belly, chicken and egg. The chicken was surprisingly good and came in a very generous portion. The pork belly was delicious as well. My favorite part of the customizability was the option for extra broth, which came in a side bowl. Many places offer extra noodles, which I'm not interested in, but this is the first time I've seen extra broth as an option. I drained both bowls and loved the sheer amount of rich broth this meal provided.\n\nOverall, I look forward to trying some of their other broths, and I will definitely be back.

Thankfully my work let us out early for the long Memorial Day weekend last Friday. I knew this would be the perfect opportunity to beat the dinner crowds by going in around 3:45PM. \n\nI walked through the door and my hunch was right! Only a few people in the restaurant and I was able to grab a roomy table for myself. The servers were quick to bring me a menu and glass of water.\n\nI ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN. It comes with complimentary mushrooms, green onions, spinach, corn, and a slice of BBQ pork. It's been a long work week and sometimes you just gotta #treatyoself -- I added a soft boiled egg ($1) and some pork belly ($2) to my dish. Five minutes later I was already slurping down on my bowl of piping hot soup (after the obligatory Yelp check-in and picture taking of course).\n\nWhat do I LOVE? All the veggies are very fresh, especially the corn. I have a soft spot for soft boiled eggs, and this one was cooked perfectly! Soft and gooey on the inside. The miso soup was rich and spicy enough to soothe my throat and clear my sinuses (is this TMI?). The noodles are thin but still chewy (however I still prefer the thicker, dense noodles at Shalala -- review to be written soon!). Not sure if I'd splurge on the pork belly again, but the BBQ pork was very moist and fulfilled my carnivore cravings.\n\nI'll make a note to visit again during weekday off-peak hours...maybe a late lunch or early dinner after work.", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

The irony is that a new ramen house opened in the old closet of a space, the eccentrically named Sushi Bay since they don't serve sushi (review: http://bit.ly/1EWrf1I). Ramen Underground took over the execrable Miyabi Sushi, which was a fast-food spot for Mickey D-style bi bim bop. It retained the harsh lighting and tired floor tiles but otherwise the owners made sure it still attracted their core customers, noodle-crazed hipsters, with its claustrophobic tables, chalkboard menus and servers with attitude.\n\nActually this last feature is new, and that's the one ding I'd give it now. Before, the Japanese sistuhs were racing around and very polite, but now they have young, glum-looking guys with attitude pretending to wait tables. They still did their jobs, but I felt like I was intruding on their space. Fortunately that really didn't prevent me from enjoying my ramen. It looks like they extended the menu judging from their laminated placards (photo: http://bit.ly/18DA7Pi). I suppose I could have tried the Haba\u00f1ero Ramen or maybe even a Tomato one, but I ran true to form. Excuse me, rather I waddled true to form and ordered the $11.95 Tonkotsu Ramen with the $2 premium for the Kakuni Braised Pork Belly (photo: http://bit.ly/1wNRsJD). Spoiler alert, I know.\n\nAnd of course, this being the FiDi and all, there was an extra dollar for my beloved corn kernels and yet another dollar for the boiled egg. Care to ask me if I want it hard-boiled or soft, sonny? Eh, can't hear ya, boy. So the real price was $15.95 all told, but hey, it was good and the broth decadently creamy without really being creamy. That hasn't changed since the original location and neither has the melty-good pork. Probably in an attempt to frustrate the hipsters staring at me though the front window, I also ordered the $4.95 Seaweed Salad and ate it rather slowly (photo: http://bit.ly/1EwONNk). Not so much to savor as to have something to do to stare back at the hipsters. It tasted like something from the refrigerated section of Nijiya Market.

Idk I mean from the standpoint of a bowl of ramen.. the soup and noodles were both underwhelming so there's really not much redeeming after that.

All the tables are occupied and there are a dozen people waiting their turn outside the door. \n\nThe wait wasn't bad at all. But then again, we had strategically chosen a weeknight. Our waitress was friendly and informative. When I told her I don't eat pork, bacon or ham, she was very helpful in recommending options.\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the selections. For people with dietary restrictions, the Vegetarian Ramen is a good option because you can still add a ton of extras. And that's exactly what I did. The bowl was enormous, the broth hearty and the vegetables fresh and crisp.\n\nIt is a cash-only place and quite small. I recommend not carrying giant bags when you visit.", "author": "T.E. M."}

Recently, I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen for takeout and realized at home that they'd given me the wrong soup base--chicken instead of the pork broth.  As someone who had previously worked in the food service industry for many years, I completely understand that mix-ups happen and would never (ever, ever) write a review for this reason alone. I found the chicken ramen broth to be very, very bland--but it might be good to order if you've got a stomach ache. The toppings for the Tonkotsu do not include boiled egg; you've got to order it separately (+1.50).", "author": "Michelle C."}

But absolutely worth the wait.\n\nThe Spicy Miso Ramen comes with shredded chicken, instead of the usual pork. Which is a awesome. Because pork is icky. It also comes with a little bit of spinach, so you can blast back into your office like a slug from a .45 rocking your tight new Popeye-esque brain muscles. And all for only $10.95.\n\nNaturally the menu offers opportunities for customization through additional toppings. However, skipping the frills won't impact your experience in a negative way at all. The fundamentals here are well executed, with a rich tasty broth that feels lighter than other ramen places in the area, and noodles that are certainly a step or three above those same joints.\n\nRamen Underground is worth the dive, assuming you have the time. I've paid a lot more for ramen that was a lot less tasty than this. Gotta love that white meat!", "author": "Kevin B."}

This one had that chewy texture and al dente. Broth was good, rich, milky and yet not salty at all. However, the meat was a bit disappointing. It was dry, unflavored and nothing close to being tender as it should be. They were also a bit stingy on their toppings, almost at a bare minimum. Small portions in a big bowl makes it a bit deceiving.\n\nI guess if you are craving for ramen and don't have high expectations, this would be a good place to stop by.", "author": "Em T."}

I've never had mushrooms or spinach in ramen, but both were actually damn tasty. The biggest downfall was the pork. It comes with chasu (BBQ pork) that wasn't very good. I didn't know this when I ordered, so I added kakuni (braised pork belly).

When it was located across the street at the original 355 Kearny Location, it was one of my all-time fav ramen joints that my BF introduced me to a few years ago. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth, the broth was frothy, and the noodles were chewy.\n\nAs of this summer, the new location at 356 Kearny changed their menu a bit. No more pork (although the menu still deceivingly said the normal order without extras comes with 1 piece of Pork) and totally replaced with crappy, shredded chicken. I was really disappointed! \n\nEven the Pork Belly extra (+$2) that my BF got was just mediocre. I'm genuinely disappointed Ramen Underground. I hope you'll go back to your original recipes of delicious-porky-goodness. \n\nOverall - just an okay ramen spot now  with more chairs/seating than before.

I read some decent reviews and the place was within a mile of my hotel so a friend and I trecked our way through the drunks and homeless for a big steamy bowl of ramen.\n\nThis was really a flavorful bowl of ramen. But I just don't think it was worth $17. Not even in San Francisco. It's just...the noodles were so weird. I really wasnt expecting a spaghetti noodle, which is what these essentially were. No wiggle, no chew, no classic ramen snap back. Maybe the noodle is a style that I have never heard of. I am not an expert, but I know what I like and dislike.\n\nThe tonkatsu miso broth was lovely. Its the most expensive broth on the menu. But it made up for the creepy noodles. I added dumplings and egg. The egg was lovely. The dumplings were not worth the extra $. The pork was tender, and the other toppings were average. \n\nThere was some bland chili oil and soy as seasoning and that's it.  \n\nAfter a beer and a bowl of ramen my bill was around $25.

Don't bother.\n\nMy 2 friends and I were downtown last night doing some shopping, and we were ready to eat. As we are coming around closer to 9pm, we knew our options were waning, and given SF's rather bi-polar weather recently, one of my friends wanted soup. We talked about the merits of different kinds of soup, I suggested Ramen Underground with the warning that I thought the place was overrated, but it's always busy, so let's give it a try. We get seated quickly, and after being asked to shift over one seat, we place orders. My friend was surprised at the lack of toppings in the soups given the prices, and how $$ the add-ons were. \n\nI ordered the miso-tonkatsu ramen with an egg. I haven't had more tasteless broth in memory; there was neither the porky richness that one associates with even a decent tonkatsu broth, nor the savory-saltyness that comes with miso. Noodles were overcooked, and didn't have the appropriate chewiness. (If you want to REALLY nerd out on ramen, it's components and structure, read Oishinbo's manga on the topic. You'll learn quite a bit). Toppings are both ood (spinach) and run-of-the-mill. The only good thing (and merits one of the two stars) was the egg was cooked to perfection. \n\nService is choppy - and they charge 35 cents to use a credit card (which, after doing a quick google search, is illegal in California).

Chashu is well cooked, not too fatty, very flavorful and mouse-watering.\n(+) PRICE: I think the price is pretty reasonable for the taste. Spicy miso is $10.95 (miso is $9.95). Premium toppings (like chashu bbq pork, pork belly, etc etc) is $2.00 each, whereas the other toppings (boiled egg, corn, mushroom, green onion, etc) is $1.00 each.\n(-) SERVICE: Very long wait. Don't come with big groups, or you'll be waiting forever. You can also call in and order for pickup/to-go if you don't want to wait too long. Average wait time is around ~15-20 mins for a group of 2.

Those two toppings did not go well at all with the broth or the noodles at all. I added the corn for a $1 extra. The broth was thin and salty. Nothing went especially well with each other.

I will be honest and say that I've never made my own ramen from scratch nor my own tonkatsu broth, so I can only make comments on other aspects of execution. Came here for lunch while visiting the bay area. It was busy, but that is no excuse for some of the problems in basic execution that I noticed. We ordered the tsukemen and gyoza.\n\nI'll start with the gyoza. The flavor was to be honest meh and the gyoza were lukewarm and dripping with oil. Maybe too much oil was used, I don't know, but let the gyoza drain before putting them onto a plate or the oil will reduce the dumplings in a soggy, oily mess. One could tell that the gyoza were served after sitting out too long after being pan-fried.\n\nOnto the tsukemen. My disclaimer is that the first and only tsukemen I had was at Tsujita and this is what I'm comparing Ramen Underground to. The broth was a touch too soupy for my taste when I imagine a tsukemen. I would prefer the broth to be reduced further to concentrate the flavors and to nearly be considered a sauce. The broth served by Ramen Underground was thin enough that the noodles would not pick up enough of the flavor and not reduced enough that I was able to drink the broth by itself, grimacing only barely at how salty it was. The broth was served lukewarm and the noodles slightly below room temperature. Serve them both hot, especially the noodles. Dipping cold noodles into hot (not to mention lukewarm) broth will only cause the dish to taste and feel like leftovers. Flavor-wise, I enjoyed the broth, though I think it would be better as a soup ramen than a tsukemen.", "author": "Joe L."}

I was waiting for my car to be fixed in Chinatown, so I headed over here. I was surprised to see that this was such a small, cramped restaurant. \n\nIts not your ordinary set menu, rather, you build your own bowl of ramen. Therefore, they charged for all the individual toppings/add on. Ramen underground also only accepts cash, so that was a bit inconvenient. Their service here isn't even great, we had to keep calling the waitress to get our order, to get drinks etc etc. Terrible service, and she wasn't even busy.. she was just standing in the front cash register. \n\nI had to use their restroom, so I walked through their kitchen to get to the tiny cramped bathroom, and boy was the kitchen dirty. That made me feel very unappetizing to the food that was going to come out. I wonder what their rating is for cleanliness. \n\nOverall, the ramen broth here isn't very heavy, as you usually see from cooking pork bones for 20+ hours.

Maybe because it was the spinach and how it didn't completely wilt into the broth. \n\nBut remember how to never judge a book by its cover? The same goes with ramen. Once I took a sip of the broth, it was game over. The broth was flavorful and not watered down. It was the full pork flavor and nothing short of it. As I made my way through my bowl, I realized it came with a pork belly. Don't know if it usually does, but I can't complain.

I had the salt ramen, which was my favorite at the old location. It was flavorless and bland. It used to be so full of flavor and umami. I added egg, which came completely unseasoned and pale. It also was missing big chunks in the white and was broken apart. The slice of pork wasn't cooked long enough so the fat was still hard and chewy. It was also unseasoned and pale.\n\nI'm so bummed cuz this used to be my favorite ramen in the city! Ugh.", "author": "Jessie L."}

It's comparable with Ajisen, which is a chain I like at SF Center.  \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu just for comparison with other places.  They give you a piece of beef stew, a piece of \"chasiu,\" and an egg.  The booth, which is an important part, lacks the deep flavor at Orenchi and the thick creaminess at Mensho. (The Mensho broth was chicken based, truth be told).   The noodle was cooked exactly right and the egg was soft inside.  The Tonkotsu ramen at Ajisen has more toppings, but the egg is exact there (and hard boiled).\n\nOverall, the experience was adequate that i would not mind going back if I happen to be looking for a place to eat in the area.

Perhaps I am spoiled by the authentic ramen at Tatsuya in Austin, but this place is the equivalent of cup-O-noodle with better fixins, and a huge price. I came here for lunch with work colleagues. We arrived before noon but the restaurants, which recently moved to a larger space across the street, was already completely full with 15 groups waiting for tables. I was bemused by their wait list system which consists of a dry erase board at the street where you sign in-- honor system I guess. We decided that we didn't have time to wait so ordered pick-up instead-- lucky!!(?). But unfortunately even pickup is behind all the customers at tables who just ordered, so it ended up taking 20 minutes to receive our food, and that was missing an order. The toppings were also wrong, sadly, on one soup (really just a mixup between 2 soups). \n\nThe cost was $16. For a bowl of ramen. Let that sink in for a second.  My main complaint though was that the broth was not well flavored, not bad, but not the rich flavor you get from cooking pork bones for 20 hours either. The noodles were meh, nothing special there. The choice and variety of toppings keeps this place from the 2-star range, but as noted above, those toppings will add on a pretty penny to your already $8-10 bowl. They have kimchi, which was a plus. \n\nOverall, I would come back if a work colleague wanted Ramen Underground and was standing his/her ground about it, but I can think of at least 3 other primarily soup serving restaurants that I would rather eat at in the area.", "author": "Adina P."}

It's not too spicy at all and has great flavor. If you're hungry, I would add a second helping of noodles. I also liked adding extra spinach and hard boiled egg. My only gripe is that once you add more things, it gets a little expensive (for ramen, IMO). $15 for a bowl of ramen is hardly a deal, but it's definitely tasty!

The broth was good, however the noodles were undercooked and the chicken had no flavor and was dry. I would've given this place 3 stars but there was an issue with the bill that really upset me. There was 3 of us - and 2 of us paid our portions including tip and tax in cash and our third friend put the remainder on her card.

She asked \"did you mean to put this much tip? Because it's not enough\" And we were just like uhhhh no? Lol It was just very unprofessional considering tip is optional. Our friend definitely should've left more tip because we did get good service, but after the girl said something about it we definitely didn't feel like giving it anymore...\n\nOverall, I won't be going back.

Not sure if it's even Japanese owner any more, it's definitely not Japanese cooks. If they taste their own ramen at least once in a while, they may just notice that the broth is gooey and sour (at least for their miso flavor), it's like they just pour hot water on some pre-made paste.

This ramen is what single handedly, or should I say, single bowl-dedly got me into ramen (ok, that seriously is the last bad joke of this review). It is not some hastily put together token vegetarian broth, it is very flavorful and sure packs a wallop. It is slightly on the spicier side, but I always ask for extra spicy with a few more chilly flakes. But be warned, the bad part is not the burning tongue or what happens the next day. Every so often a rogue chili flake would go forth to irritate your throat and make you cough up ramen broth through your mouth and nose embarrassing you in front of the girl you were trying to impress. You thought a pebble in your shoe was irritating? You have obviously never had spicy ramen broth in your nostrils. \nBut if you discount the human deficiency of breathing and eating through the same pipe, this place is a must try if you are around financial district.

Everyone is an expert, mainly through self proclamation. To college students, it's a staple because you can eat it through the week and save some money for the weekend. For younger kids, it's just good. For adults, the sophisticated, refined type it has become a delicacy. \n\nFor me, I just like it. There are days I want cheap maruchan packets. There are days I gourmet the crap out of those same packets. Then, there are days I feel overly sophisticated and somewhat refined and want something authentic. In Japan, ramen broth is art and is passed down. It is meticulous and intricate, it is delicate and balanced. I have sampled many variations of it and I think I know what is good, what is excellent, and what should be fed to your neighbors' dogs.\n\nSo Ramen Underground...\n\nIt's actually above ground, and nothing mysterious about it so the name doesn't suit it. It's seating capacity is probably 20 - 25 and you sit casually with other people at any open chair. For groups, this can present a problem. For singles, who cares? \n\nI like that they let you write on the paper menu and use that as your actual order. Who would mess up that order? I don't like that their blackboard tells you to enjoy edamame while waiting when they don't give you any edamame while waiting. Where's my edamame???? Argh!!!!!\n\nBase price for ramen with noodles and broth, limited toppings is $10.95. Every add on is anywhere from $1 to $2.50. I like that you can add on extra noodles and broth. I don't like that for you to have the toppings of traditional ramen you would bring your price to about $15. So here is my problem with this place. I am fine that they charge $10.95 but this should have onions, corn, mushrooms, the normal stuff. Otherwise, just charge me $15 for my normal bowl and don't play mind games with me. I deserve more than that. \n\nThe broth was delicious. I had spicy miso and yes it was good. It wasn't ramen dojo good and the pork wasn't buttery delicate but good nonetheless. The additional pork belly I asked for was dry and over cooked. Other than that it essentially just came with a couple mushrooms and about 3 spinach leaves. \n\nHence, they get and deserve three stars. Don't mean to poop the party but c'mon now. With Pabu ramen house nearby you cannot go on like this. My bowl with kimchee, and pork belly came to $19.95. That just isn't right for a B grade joint. \n\nAt the end of the day, I satisfied my ramen fix but I wasn't pleased. I was disgruntled. I may read this again and decide that even a 3 was generous.

I make the exact same order and tell the cashier (who is the same woman I spoke on the phone with) my story. She marks the toppings off and then asks me for $12.

After being seated, they proceeded to deliver our menus and glasses of water. The ramen came out quickly and was hot. \n\nThe soup was not as expected though; it was thin as noted by others. The taste was a bit plain as well. I was disappointed to see that they topped the ramen with normal button mushrooms, sparse amounts of spinach, and a small piece of pork. The true highlight of the dish was the pork belly though. It was well layered, tender, meaty, and soft. The noodles were as expected.\n\nWhile I will probably not return to this restaurant, for those in the district without a budget, this is a decent place to eat ramen.", "author": "Kaiden T."}

First, they deceitfully substitute the allegedly included pork with dry, overcooked, flavorless, poor quality chicken.  The \"extra\" slice of pork that I added for $2 was minscule.  I don't know what the noodles are, but they weren't ramen noodles and they can probably be found in the pasta aisle at Safeway.  I can't believe people line up and wait for this place.  I assumed it had so many bad reviews due to the relatively high price, but unfortunately the failure runs much deeper.  AVOID.", "author": "Will H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-26", "description": "Worst ramen I have ever tasted (and I have been to way too many ramen joints between Cali and Japan...) and definitely by far the most expensive place of all.  Long story short, $15.27 before tip for a fake \"tonktsu\" ramen with pork belly.  The tonktsu soup base tasted like it was made from manufactured paste, like those stuff you get with the frozen packs you can buy from any of the Japanese/Chinese super market.  Want Cha-su and boiled egg that should come standard in any ramen place? Sorry, thats $1 each add-on!  In fact, my \"tonktsu\" bowl comes with chicken pieces and uncooked mushroom?! Both first in a tonktsu ramen for me...\n\nWorst of all, the waitress is simply clueless, to a point of being extremely annoying.  I went in when the store was almost empty (late Friday afternoon).  The waitress saw me, told me to sit anywhere.  I asked if I can sit at one of the tables by the window, she said sure, so I did.  She then came to me and asked me to move to the bar because she needs to wipe the table, so I did.  She then came back and asked me to sit at the far end of the bar against the wall!  I was like, you just told me to move so you can clean and now I can't sit at the table?  And on top of that I have to sit in a tight corner by the wall? When there is no one else at the bar area?  She then said fine so I moved to the table.  After the meal I walked to the counter to pay, she looked at me and said \"Welcome you can sit at any table...\" WTF??!!\n\nAnyway, so $17 ( with tip...for the non existent service) for a bowl of weird ramen that's worse than the frozen instant ramen packs.  This is one experience I don't ever want to have again.  There are plenty of great, and reasonably priced ramen joints in the Bay Area, namely Orenchi, Ramen Dojo/Parlor, Yamadaya, Waruku etc to name a few.

I understand that mistakes can happen at any restaurant, especially one that is very busy, but when those mistakes do happen the staff should find a way to make it up to the customer.\n\nAt any other restaurant I have been to, that type of mistake has always led to an offer to take the item off of the bill.

Unfortunately it only comes with Ramen in Miso Soup with some Spinach, Mushrooms and ONE piece of pork.  I added $1 for a hard boiled egg.  The only thing I can taste is the very saltiness of the bowl of noodles.  Also, part of the noodles were uncooked and still stick together.  Not sure all the rave about this place.

I'm a big fan of Ramen in general, but as a vegetarian, it's hard to find Ramen dunked in veggie broth. But in Ramen Underground I finally found my solace. I come here quite regularly and invariably end up getting the same thing - Ramen with veggie broth, corn, tofu and spicy green onion. Corn adds some fiber and the spicy green onion adds the zing. I once got Ramen without those two, and it tasted pretty bland. A word of caution is that the Ramen is pretty salty - not salty enough to ruin the taste, but salty enough to test your daily value sodium requirement (but I guess, that's just the very nature of Ramen, isn't it?) While the place is a bit pricey (comes out to ~$15 for that combo), the Ramen quantity is very sufficient. And oh, the place is cash-only.\n\nThere is always a big waiting line for lunch, so if you want to dine in, then be prepared to wait a while. The place isn't too huge (it has a very undergroundy hipstery hole in the wall feel to it)...it probably seats about 15 people. Even if you order to go, you'd end up waiting at least 20 minutes or so. The evenings are little less packed, because I presume all the FiDi bankers have gone home by then.", "author": "Srivatsan S."}

However, the lady came and told us that the tips we paid was too less. We have to follow their guideline to pay the tips (the minimum is 18%).

Out of all of those places, none of them beat Ramen Underground's Shoyu Ramen with kakuni, soft boiled egg, and tofu. Once in a while, this place isn't perfect - the pork might be dry, the soft boiled egg a little overcooked, but the noodles and broth are always consistently flavorful and to me, that's the most important part. I love the variety of toppings they have, but I agree that it can really add up. I also love that they offer to-go options for when my boyfriend is sick or if I'm ordering during work.

I can't really call myself a good native if I live and work in the district. The wait is about 10-25 minutes, the latter if it's really busy that night amd people jus aren't leavimg. The disappointing thing now is that they've chamged their ramen recipe a bit. Instead of a slice of chashu, you get chicken that's been reduced to a meek pile becauae they simmered it for too long to make their base. Chashu is now a $2 topping. Japan is crying from overseas. \n\nI always get the spicy miso. The heat changes from time to time, but it was perfect last night. Had me reaching for the water a couple times and my nose started to run, but I wasn't tearing up or sweating. The basic toppings are good, but you have to get the egg, even though it's $1 extra. Were these chicken fed grapes by virgins with feather fans or something? Stradivarius violin playing as they boiled the eggs? They also changed the noodles. It felt more like boxed thin spaghetti than actual ramen. I'm left wondering if they ran out of ramen noodles or if management decided it was time to switch from caring about their food to caring about their money. I'm sure they're crying all the way to the bank at this one customer's letdown.\n\nThe guy running the table seems like a great guy, very attentive to your needs. The girl working the cashier has told me consistently, every time I've eaten here, that my change wasn't enough for tips. I can sympathize that minimum wage must suck and living in SF is expensive, but why don't you worry about providing good service first, because that's what determines your tip. One time she even screwed up amd forgot a whole side of the bar's order and failed to apologize as others arrived, ate, and left, before we even got a notice. I'm pretty generous with tips but I'm pretty sure you don't deserve more than a couple dollars for that, if any. I always give more though because that one poor guy has to take care of the entire floor, which is no easy endeavor.\n\nStill, ~15 bucks for a meal is enough to smile at. My friend always gets a billion toppings and so both her bowl and bill is bigger, so you actually can end up spending a lot for what other places would've given you as their basic bowl. But you end up bringing home leftovers so that's something. Oh, and to end on a winning note? You can get ice cream next door now.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Ordered the spicy miso broth with pork belly and a boiled egg. The broth was delicious and very comforting since the weather was so cold, but I was expecting it to have more of a spicy kick. I was really let down with the pork belly.. It was hard, not tender like it usually is served at other ramen places. The meat was hard to chew and the flavor was a little off-putting.. Even though the pork was a disappointment, I still thoroughly enjoyed my bowl of ramen. I'll probably come back here if the wait isn't too long!", "author": "Krizia M."}

Took them 5 minutes to get us our menus but they took our order right away.... so I guess it kind of makes up for the lack or attentiveness.  \nMy friends ordered the tonkatsu and spicy soy sauce while I got the spicy miso.  It was alright,  like I said the noodles were the only good part.  I was really disappointed,  the only gave me mushrooms and 1 sliver, not slice, sliver of meat. What is up with that? Did they like run out? The other portions seemed to have a wide array of condiments.  I was surprised by the spinach in ramen. \nService was bad, they didn't greet us, no one checked up to see if we needed anything else.  We had to ask for our own water.

The line is always long, I tried to wait for a spot for one and watched open single seats remain open while the overwhelmed wait staff overlooked them. I finally ordered to-go and regretted it because that took super long too. I ordered miso broth with added wontons and mushrooms and my total was like $14, dumb. The miso was way murkier than I am used to, I guess I'm not a connoisseur but it tasted like they added some sort of dairy to it, no dice. Also the noodles were definitly not $14 ramen status, I got a bowl of ramen for $6 at Lee's that had way better noodles. But the real deal breaker was how incredibly salty the broth was. By the time I actually got to eat the elusive soup I felt like I needed to get back to work so since it was so hot and soooo salty I added like 3 ice cubes to it to cool it to quick-eating temp and to dilute the salt. It barely made a dent in that saline soup!! I ate less than half and tossed her out, bye bye $9 and 30+ mins of my time :'(", "author": "Emma H."}

Second, service is extremely disorganized and inefficient. The guys were scrummaging around all flustered with no sense of good customer service nor attentiveness.

It's like everyone (servers, cooks, etc) just stopped caring?!

Once our ramen finally arrived, the broth was bland, portions were small, prices are overpriced, and corn was undercooked. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. I don't understand why their standard ramen comes with chicken now? If I want chicken ramen, I'll specify if I do.

Today my family and I wanted to have a nice lunch together, we drove 8 hours from home to visit my brother. I however, did not want ramen, so I purchased a sushi burrito about half a block down. When we entered this sad excuse for a restaurant, we were seated and they gave us room temperature water. As I opened my to-go box with hopeful eyes (keep in mind I was feeling quite frail since I hadn't eaten today, had been walking around, and it was about 2PM.) a waitress came over and ever so rudely said \"no outside food in the restaurant okay?\". I accepted this fate and stepped outside to eat my lunch, as I sat down on the dirty concrete I turned around in dismay to see two waitresses looking at me and laughing. Their actions were demeaning and uncalled for. My family proceeded to get up, gather their belonging, and leave without another word. This joke of an establishment should be looked down upon as a reprehensible blemish on the culinary arts. Please take your money and put it towards a business who treats their customers with respect. The idea that a \"business\" would rather lose the payment of three customers than allow me to enjoy a nice family lunch is baffling. If you're looking for a good ramen bowl in the area I'm 100% sure there are better choices (like the one we went to in the mall off of Market street who allowed me to eat my sushi burrito with no questions asked!). I think the owners and managers of this store should go over how waiters and waitresses should carry themselves and consider retraining. My return as a customer is 100% not plausible after the disrespect received today, I would never want food served to me at the hands of such a putrid staff. Aside from treatment, their prices aren't reasonable and their location is small and cramped, similar to the minds of the people running this pile of putrescence.", "author": "Noah D."}

Limited seating, and not so ideal for larger groups.  Let's talk about the ramen.  It flat out sucks. Broth was thin and lacked flavor.  Noodles were hard and were prepared more like al dente pasta in a shitty broth.  They give you tiny pieces of pork belly and 1 incredibly small piece of char siu that was just pitiful to look at.   I got a bowl of spicy miso with pork belly, corn, and a egg and my grand total was freaking $16 and some change.... Hmmmm... A bit overpriced in my opinion, but keep in mind the location is in the Financial District, so this is why they can get away with the ridiculous pricing.  They forgot my egg too, which kind of annoyed me even more cause I was there on a rainy day and hoped the ramen would be somewhat of a decent experience.  Don't waste your time and money.  I'm not even a ramen snob or anything, but I assume the majority of the people go to ramen places mainly for the broth.  If you love good broth this is definitely not the place for you.", "author": "Eric C."}

Tried the Tonkatsu Ramen last night just before closing. ..loved it and decided to go back with the family tonight...having waited for 45 minutes i had been waiting for a table a good 15minutes longer than the new crowd that had formed...yet this one server seated another party before me and then erased my name from the waiting list...he proceeded to call another name before mine...his response to my protest was \"does it really matter who goes in first?\" I told him how long I've been waiting and he says \"fine, go in\"...as I went in with my family..he didn't realize my wife was still standing next to him outside the door as he told the party after me \"don't worry, I'll treat you better than him\"...what nerve. Just so there's no mistaking who the server was...he was the only Non-Asian serving tables this evening the 22nd of November...sorry, we thought we could get passed the mess when the bowls came but couldn't...as far as we were concerned the food might have been good but we were too upset to tell...thank you who ever you are for ruining a much anticipated meal.", "author": "Orlando J."}

Ordered the ramen and even though I made a mistake they were complete jerks about how I made my order. I don't care how good their food is, if they make me wait 10 minutes even though half the restaurant was empty and that we still need to wait to be seated", "author": "Wilson W."}

Ive had a lot of japanese ramen and this was quite decent, not the best of the best. It is a little pricey, I recommend for those who dont eat much or trying to cut out some carbs to share with someone, and its so customized, you can add in extra meat, veggies, egg, etc. The place is small so it wouldnt be convenient for a large group. Service wasn't very good, waiters were very busy so you need to call them every time you need something.", "author": "Amber R."}

The chicken teriyaki is surprisingly tasty if you fancy switching it up a bit. Accepting cash only in this era is just annoying though and the small space is not kid friendly.", "author": "1 D."}

This time after sitting in, I'm just not really impressed. I guess I've been pretty spoiled with really good ramen in the south bay, so my standards may be high, but the hype surrounding this place just simply doesn't match what I was eating. I got the shio (salt) ramen and it was ok. The broth just wasn't that flavorful, but possibly that's because I like pork broths more than chicken broths. The meat was pretty good. I got extra pork belly just to try it, and it was ok. I guess 3 stars because it wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth the hype", "author": "Edison T."}
