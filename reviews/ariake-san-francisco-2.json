My third time dining there and hands down, they have some of the freshest sashimi and tastiest nigiri anywhere. I asked the chef/owner where they source their fish and he informed me that twice a week it's flown from the eastern seas of Japan and Korea. The colder water white fishes are the best in those parts, and I certainly do not mind paying a couple of more dollars for it.\n\nGreat food... excellent service!!!

I usually order rolls when I go to sushi restaurants, and especially salmon rolls, and so I got the 49er roll, Island roll, and the Cherry blossom roll.\n\nFood, the rolls were decent, not the best I ever had, but I did like the Salmon. The amount of fish on the rolls were just right and they were good. The cherry blossom was a tuna roll, and although I usually like Tuna, I was a little taken aback by some of the flavor, and not sure if they had the freshest tuna on hand.\n\nService was ok. The first waitress that was helping us was not very helpful. She first gave us our drinks and then asked if we were ready, which we were still trying to make a decision, and then basically never came back. The second waitress was very attentive and started helping us through the ordering, getting us the free small plate of edamame that comes with the meal, and then getting additional wasabi and ginger, which they don't seem to give a lot of with the rolls themselves.\n\nOverall, I would come again, but maybe avoid the Tuna here.", "author": "V W."}

The staff is attentive and informal.\n\nMiso soup was hot, but quite ordinary, as was the tea. \nVeggie tempura was very crisp and flavorful, with nary a hint of greasiness. The dipping sauce, however, lacked much flavor at all.\nUnagi nigiri was delicious - warm and appetizing. I can see why some might find a dish like Unagi Don so appealing.\nThe Crunch 13 roll had shrimp and crab meat, deep fried. The texture was appetizing, but the flavor was a bit bland; I probably should have had one of their more colorful, inventive rolls, instead.\n\nThe price was around $35. Ariake seems to be one of those places that requires more research to find the really great dishes. This time around, the food was simply...good.", "author": "Thirsty C."}

If you're from SF you should be used to that by now. The interior is cozy and decorated like a usual Japanese restaurant. Staff are Korean, but that doesn't mean the food isn't authentic! I struggled between giving this place a 3 or 4 star rating but I think 3 is appropriate since I felt it was quite average.\n\nWe got this carpaccio type dish. I think it was harame or yellowtail think sliced, dressed in ponzu, and topped with sliced onion and tobiko. It was good but... Way too much sauce. The fish was just drowning in it and we couldn't taste the actual fish much - this is probably why I don't remember what fish it was.\n\nNext, we got a platter of sushi to share.

Ariake was the closest to us w/in walking distance and was rated 4 stars on yelp, but I beg to differ. Our experience was unpleasant enough to warrant a review.\n\nService: We had to ask 4 times for a water refill and twice for soy sauce plates. By the time we got our soy sauce dishes, we had already finished all 4 of the rolls we ordered. The male server was friendly, but the older woman was not welcoming at all. She was pre-maturely taking plates off our table as we were still eating, so her fingers came dangerously close to my face.\n\nFood: Honestly, I expected more for a 4-star restaurant. The quality of the fish did not meet my expectations. Our \"Rainbow Roll\" looked as if it was composed of scraps and the fish was definitely was not as fresh as some reviewers claimed it to be. In addition, I almost ALWAYS order the \"Lion King\" roll whenever I'm eating sushi, so you can trust my judgement when I tell you that the Lion King at Ariake was dry and bland. \n\nPrice: If the food tasted better and was of higher quality, I wouldn't mind the $$$. But $70 for 4 mediocre rolls?? No thank you. Our total came to be $105, which included 2 combination lunches that were just as mediocre as the fish.", "author": "Michelle H."}

Having always passed by, I decided to finally try this Japanese restaurant. I must say I was pretty disappointed by most facets of my visit. \n\nTo begin, the service was pretty bad, bad enough to warrant writing about. Our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there and constantly kept asking if we wanted more items after we explicitly said we were done ordering. Our food came out but we had no utensils to eat them with, and when I asked for chopsticks, it seemed as though I was doing her a disservice. \n\nWe ordered the cherry blossom roll as well as an unagi roll. The cherry blossom roll was hardly fresh, while the unagi roll was passable. On top of that, the ginger served to us was old and dried up. Our rolls seemed far larger on the menu but came out to be much smaller, so I left the meal still hungry. Coupled with the fact that the rolls were more expensive than most restaurants, it made for a pretty lackluster experience. \n\nIf you're on Geary and want Japanese cuisine or sushi, you'd do better to find somewhere else a few blocks away.", "author": "George K."}

Staying open past 10 PM--that's herra rare for Japanese restaurants!\n\nWhen we arrived around 10:15 PM, we had to a wait a few minutes for an open table. Looking through Yelp reviews, there wasn't a strong consensus for must-order items, but a good number did mention the Moon Dog special roll. Which is exactly what I chose.\n\nThe MOON DOG, $14, is an 8-piece roll stuffed with prawn tempura and crab, topped with seared tuna and special sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ariake-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tkz1Qpo4Qxzxk2Glir7v4g#zBEvOlPMsQ34W8XYk12jiQ). The seared tuna is nicely subtle and smoky, and the tempura added that textural dimension. The special sauce and Japanese mayo weren't too heavy, and the freshly diced scallions were appreciated. They seasoned the sushi rice with furikake and used cucumber slivers in the roll. Sadly, I didn't really taste the crab.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered dinner entree #6, the SALMON SHIOYAKI, $16, which is broiled salmon without teriyaki sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ariake-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=tkz1Qpo4Qxzxk2Glir7v4g#Nd7ZBcAGWVemFkqPgIYBJw). Since it's a dinner entree, it's served with miso soup and mixed greens salad. The entree dish also comes with a pile of shredded pickled daikon and another pile of seaweed salad (double yum). The salmon wasn't strongly flavored but wasn't dry either. Not the moistest I've had, but tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe food is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Unfortunately, I couldn't bite the bullet and convince myself to order their slightly pricey raw fish dishes. I'm starting to follow a trend of either paying dirt cheap for mediocre fish, or paying oodles for amazingly high quality fish (e.g. Tekka). But, when it's past 10 PM, and you're craving Japanese, Ariake becomes your default option :P", "author": "Adele F."}

One can never have enough!\n\nWhile it's tough to top an omakase meal at Tokyo's famous Tsukiji market, Ariake does a pretty decent job of satiating our craving. Got some oysters, ankimo, uni, blue fin, amaebi and toro nigiri -- very happy with my selection! The quality of the fish was superb -- it's a cut above the other Richmond area sushi restaurants we've tried.  Our kids also enjoyed their tempura shrimp udon and agedashi tofu. \n\nBy the way, it's a small restaurant but quite popular, so come early to find parking and get your name on the wait list.

Although small, it's very nice and gives off a more authentic feel. For a Saturday night, they were packed but we arrived just as a table cleared so no wait, yay! Because it was a full house, it took 30 minutes before our first dish came. They gave us free edamame as we waited, so all is forgiven. \n\nWe ordered the Tataki - small, Maguro Maguro, Double Albacore, and the Rainbow roll. The Tataki was delicious and the small was more than enough for our party of 3. I definitely recommend it! The rolls were good, but the Maguro Mango was a little too sweet due to the creamy sauce. Oh, we also got half a dozen of the Kumamoto oysters and they were amazinggggg! They're 2.50 each and very small, but so good! Definitely try them! \n\nBecause it was busy, it did take a while before our tea was refilled and we had to ask twice before we got the check.

Excitement overtook my weary body as my eyes spied cooked and fried sushi rolls: my favorites. Could they be as good as the ones at my favorite sushi place: Cha Cha in San Jose?\n\nThe rolls we got were a mixed bag. I really enjoyed their Lion King Roll (crab, avocado, wrapped in salmon and baked with special sauce). The roll had a little tangy kick towards the end of each bite that I couldn't really put my finger on, so I figured the special sauce was just doing its thing. On the other hand, the Godzilla Roll (fried yellowtail topped with sweet and spicy sauce) was totally disappointing. Some pieces of this roll had barely any fish in them. \n\nDessert was again a mixed bag. The Green Tea Cheese Cake should actually be called Green Tea Ice Cream Shaped Like a Cake. It looked like what I'd imagine green tea cheese cake looks like, but it was FROZEN. I want my cheesecake to be soft and creamy, not hard. The Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream was good, but nothing mind-blowing. \n\nService was friendly, yet we had to repeatedly ask for refills. We had just spent 2 hours in heavy armor beating each other with wooden swords so we were pretty parched. Even after we kindly asked, explaining to the waitress that we were pretty thirsty, it still took a while to get our refills.", "author": "Mark C."}

They made up for the stringiness by giving me a little extra maguro as sashimi on the side. They have a board behind the sushi bar that shows what their \"catch of the days\" are---follow this, try something new, and you will be set.\n\n-Really delicious specialty rolls. I'm not a huge fan of lots of mayo sauces, so if you are along the same parallel as me, great! Order the Hamachi Mango or Dragon rolls. The tempura in the rolls doesn't overwhelm the sushi, if you know what I mean. If you like more mayo-y sauces they have a few of those too: Moon Dog and Bob's rolls.\n\nDisclaimer: very small space with limited tables.

However Ariake is awesome for the regular, typical nigiri and sashimi. However they have some great rolls too!\n\nThe \"Love\" Combination is great. I would suggest the Chirashi (donburi style) since I think they give you more rice that way. I've had that combo as a sashimi dinner, which was great, but I was not full at the end, which can be disappointing if you're really hungry.\n\nThe service here is really sweet. There's one girl that is very personable, and funny.

The waitresses were very attentive from the moment we sat down. Sometimes sushi places can get intimidating especially if you don't have the things that are listed on the menu but the waitresses were extremely helpful.\n\nNow onto the food. I ordered the 12 piece chef's choice Omakase as my dinner for the evening. It is a fixed dinner wheeee you have the option of a mushroom or clam miso soup, a small sashimi appetizer, 12 pieces of nigiri, and a choice between red bean and green tea ice cream.  \n\nThe clam miso was interesting because the clam definitely added a different level of flavor to your average miso soup. The sashimi dish was not explained but it was some type of seared fish seasoned with sauces and daikon radish. Both were a good starter and the sashimi had a nice tangy flavor to it. The seared fish provided an interesting contrast when being eaten. \n\nNow the star of the set meal the nigiri. The progression of the different kinds of fish that was served to us was harmonious. We started with light subtle fish and as the meal progressed the chef started bringing out the big flavor a with the stronger tasting fish. Each piece had the perfect amount of wasabi added to bring out the flavor and the waitress was kind enough to explain every piece that was brought out. The salmon nigiri was probably the best pieces of salmon I've had so far because it was just melt in your mouth good. She also explained that we should follow a certain order to get that flavor progression. \n\nOverall a great experience with fresh fish and great Omakase.

Ariake is quite innovative with its premium rolls - Hamachi Mango rolls are highly recommended, flashy and pretty in presentation as well as taste and originality. Ariake roll though on the other hand is too fish with the seaweed. \nThe Ikejime Tai sashimi special is extremely good, fresh, and melts in my mouth.. the crystal texture and look is also very appealing. I made sure that i carefully chewed each piece.\n\nThe street parking is stringent, very busy and somewhat tricky geary street, back street parking are slightly better. Walking 2 blocks on a weekend is normal. Restaurant is very small and crammed.\n\nService is average, considering the restaurant is quite busy, it is okay. Focus on the food!", "author": "Dilys S."}

It would've been 10x better there for the same price.  \n\nOrdered a bunch of sashimi from the specials board. The sashimi was the thinnest and smallest pieces I've ever seen. The scallops were crazy thin and were $20. The toro the chef kept pushing was alright but also not worth the $20 price tag. The miso soup was sickly sweet and I couldn't even finish it. Sake wasn't served nearly cold enough. \n\nWaitress was all over the place. At one point she filled up my tea cup and left without filling my friends even though I hadn't taken a sip out of mine and his was completely empty wtf? They also refused to let us sit at the tables further in incase a bigger group of people showed up even though we were one of the last customers that came in. \n\nThey did have multiple televisions playing the football game though if you're into that.

I was having dinner with my girlfriend, we are sitting at the sushi bar chatting and enjoying our meal when my friend tells me that she is going to send me a text message and to look at it.  She writes that there is this creepy man staring at you, giving you elevator eyes. \n\nI've been noticing this man staring at me 3 seats away at the sushi bar but have been trying to ignore him, but when my friend notices and points it out I can't ignore it anymore.  Now I am feeling very uncomfortable and I can't enjoy my food because I feel very creeped out.  So after a few more minutes of attempting to ignore the staring, I turn and face the man and ask him, \"Are you staring at me?\" The creepy stranger starts mumbling something in his poor French-English saying something about studying here and that he was just watching the television on the other side of me.  I very well know he wasn't looking at the TV when his eyes were burning into me.\n\nNow he is embarrassed for being called out and shows me his French-American Alien card for some reason and shows me how much he spent at the restaurant.  It was very strange and he made it more uncomfortable by continuing to explain.  I told him it was fine, my friend and I are just trying to enjoy our meal and to please leave us alone. Shortly thereafter he leaves Ariake.\n\nThe owner of the restaurant and main sushi chef must have been watching this encounter because as soon as the weirdo creeper leaves, he starts scolding me.  The owner says that the man is a regular customer and spends a lot of money there, he obviously does NOT care/understand how uncomfortable I felt.  I felt even more doubly uncomfortable as I am Korean-American and I know that the owner is Korean and Korean men from his era are historically misogynistic.  Rape wasn't even reported until a couple years ago and customarily it was considered the woman's fault in South Korea.  Therefore who cares if a strange man was staring at me, I was probably asking for it right? I was in the wrong here obviously.....\n\nI live several blocks away and I love sushi but I am never coming here again.  Ladies and gentleman, unless you enjoy stepping into the realm of the 1960's where misogynistic ways of man rule the planet, I wouldn't suggest you spend your money here either.", "author": "Clover S."}

I've come here (and dragged friends as well) around 4 times and we have never been disappointed!

There, a few doors down sitting pretty was Ariake, and it was warm and comforting once I walked inside. The place is tiny with less than ten small tables arranged along one side of the restaurant next to a vertical sushi bar where a jumbo flat screen TV showed Monday night football. The ambiance was soothing and reminded me of Tanuki or Takao without the table cloths. There was also an air of seriousness with its straight laced decor while the sushi chefs chatted away casually with their regular customers about football and Jerry Rice. The place was crowded and festive.\n\nNestled by the end corner of the sushi bar facing the TV with my back against the door, I ordered their sushi dinner--Love ($20.95). It came with eight pieces of nigiri, tekka maki, salad, miso, and edamame. The nigiri pieces had good portion and they were thick and very fresh. The taste was outstanding and each piece had all the firm and buttery texture at the right places. I thought the eel, tuna, white tuna, yellowtail, salmon and scallop were flavorful, and the sea urchin and salmon roes caught me off guard with a mouthful of deliciousness. Everything was pretty standard while their dessert options were weak and lacking. \n\nOverall I thought their menu was pretty standard and somewhat lacked innovation but they were very good at what they do. In addition, I thought their prices were decent since it could be cheaper but it was still quite affordable for the quality you get. If there is one stark limitation, it would be their service as it was quite spotty for me while the chefs and servers were visibly cliquish with their regulars. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to develop a sense of belonging to connect with the place. Here's how they fared as a result:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 5 stars\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 4 stars \n3.) Quantity and substance: 4 stars\n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 3 stars\n5.) Service and ambiance: 2 stars\n\nNot yet a fan, 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

Our waitress came back a few minutes later and was like sorry we can't make it that way. Seriously you can't sub out rice for more lettuce? it's not like its a maki roll or something. Literally you are just adding more lettuce and then putting the fish on top. I think this is the first time ever i was told that can't happen which frankly mind boggled me a bit. This pretty much annoyed me to no end and kinda turned me off from the place. The second thing was the wait for the good. There was a rather long gap of time between each dish that was brought out instead of it all being together. I ended up getting the sashimi combo and a salad and the fiance got one of the mango rolls and one of the taco rolls along with a house salad. The rolls were ok but nothing out of this world.

We got some maki rolls, which is what we normally eat when we have sushi. The size of the rolls was pretty decent-- about what I've been used to seeing other places. There were some interesting maki rolls that I hadn't seen before, so we tried some of those, and some more classic ones. The different ones were interesting, and not bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-29", "description": "I saw some of the reviews and thought I should write about this place. For one, I don't understand why people let $ become a factor for the review. I get that price can be a big deal, but come on, you can check out the menu and know if you can afford to eat there or not. Duh. This shouldn't be factored into whether the food tastes good or not. \n\nSecond, what's with factoring race? If Koreans made sushi, big deal. If it tastes good, I'm so there. You see non-Asians at Panda Express making Chinese food, but people still go there...just sayin'.  \n\nOK. End Rant. Now onto the restaurant review...\n\nI've been coming here for at least the last 5 years. I haven't been disappointed and although the sushi could fluctuate once in a while (the new sushi chef behind the counter, not Jin, sometimes doesn't put the masago on top of my rolls), the taste is always the same. \n\nThe restaurant is small, so sometimes you have to wait for a table. But if I had to rate the place  solely on the space and the cost of the sushi, I would not give it 5 stars, maybe more like 3 or 4 on atmosphere. But I'm rating on the quality of the fish and service, so I give this place 5 stars. Sushi is pricey to begin with, but it doesn't mean this place costs an arm and a leg. It's about the same anywhere, but the fish is always fresh and my tea cup is always full. The waitresses are really nice and attentive, even when they are busy. \n\nMy favorite rolls I order that I can't find elsewhere are:\n\nMoondog Roll\nIsland Roll (Really like this roll because of the thinly sliced lemon they put on top of it really gives you a fresh burst of citrus that complements the salmon coupled with the crunch from the tempura shrimp). \nHamachi Mango (Mango and fish?! Who knew the combo would be so noms!)\nCliff House (although this is no longer on the menu, but they still make it for me :) )\n\nIf you get bored of regular rolls, this place has a few that you won't find anywhere else. And if you become a regular, JIn remembers you and will strike up a conversation with you if you sit at the bar.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-19", "description": "Okay. This place... I can't even... just -- go there. The exterior does not at all betray the cornucopia of deliciousness that resides within. This is a true-blue hole in the wall restaurant. The staff is adorable and incredibly polite. The owner, Jin, imports fish a few times a week. If he's working the sushi bar, you can ask him what's fresh/what he'd recommend and he will go into obscene detail as to why, say, the tuna is the best that night.\n\nI've been here a few times with a friend and her husband, and the food has never failed to be anything but incredible. First off, we have ankimo. Monkfish liver. Those not seasoned in sushi may cringe at the thought, but this stuff is SO AMAZING. It's buttery and smooth -- not at all what you might expect from well... liver. If you're brave enough, give it a go -- it's definitely not the cheapest thing on the menu, but very much worth every penny.\n\nNext, hamachi kama. This is the cheek/neck of Yellowtail, and Ariake does it right. The meat falls off like it was placed there by hand, and each bite is like a miniature megaton of flavor. \n\nThey have kuramoro oysters with a great house sauce. This is a great place to start if you want to try oysters! The sauce compliments the flavors of oysters, which are surprisingly sweet -- not briny, and not at all what I expected.\n\nIn terms of rolls, the only ones I've had are the Ariake and Moon Dog. I... probably won't even bother trying anything else, because those two knock it out of the park.\n\nNow if you're in the mood to spend a bit of money, and you're a fan of sake, indulge in the Narutotai. It comes in a 700~ mL steel bottle, and it is likely the best sake you will find on this side of the Pacific. I've rarely appreciated notes of flavor in sake (as it was usually going down with a Kirin or Ichiban in a sake bomb). Narutotai is AMAZING.

It was a quiet Wednesday night, not too busy, but a steady stream of regulars coming in throughout the evening.  There was even a space heater near the front to warm those customers seated near the doorway.\n\nWe were seated immediately and were greeted with warm disposable towels. Edamame was placed between my dining partner and I.  First thing I noticed, the cleaniness of the fish assortment before my eyes.  The display case was neat, and the fish weren't just tossed in there.  Even all the 'sides' on the counter behind the display case were laid out with care.  I definitely appreciate this in a restaurant.\n\nWe started with the Bonito Sashimi with creamy sauce.  I definitely enjoy how Ariake does it.  There was a plentiful amount of fish, tobiko eggs, and creamy sauce (without being runny).  It was oh so yummy!  Next was Firecracker - deep fried shiso leaf with seaweed salad and poki on it.  Yummy, and a nice contrast of flavors.  \n\nWe also ordered Uni nigiri, Hamachi nigiri, and Ikura nigiri.  It was good, not fabulous, but good.  My sister also had a Natto roll that I stayed far away from.  The smell alone turns me off!  Bleh!  \n\nWe closed with a 49er roll - salmon, avocado, mint leaves, and lemon slices.  Refreshing and tasty, quite enjoyable.\n\nThe green tea ice cream tasted even better than what I recall other places offering.  Perhaps it was the creaminess?  I'm not sure, but it was good.\n\nService is at a slower pace here, but my tea cup was always full for the most part.  (And I do drink lots of tea when I'm dining.)  If you're in a rush, I wouldn't recommend eating here then.  Go when you have time to spare.\n\nWith the low music playing in the background, I enjoyed this quieter side of eating sushi.  The last few times I've sat at the bar at other restaurants, I was surrounded by loud, obnoxious and overbearing patrons.  It was a relief and comforting to be able to enjoy my meal without being subjugated to everyone else's dramatics.  \n\nIn the past, I've had some hits and misses with Ariake's.  But last night, they were more on the hit and I would definitely go back.\n\nSide note: I used to bring my friend here who became addicted to their Toro.  He would come here on his own, daily, weekly, whenever he wanted a taste of Toro.  He became known to them as Toro Boy.  He then started bringing his friends along, and in turn, one of his friends 'introduced' his favorite SF sushi place to me - Ariake's, on a date.  I had to laugh, the power of networking had come full circle.  I had to break it to him, I had been the one who brought Toro Boy to Ariake's in the first place.

Although the waiter was prompt and courteous, he gave us bad recommendations for cooked rolls.  They ignored my request for light or no sauce.  The space was tiny and cramped (4 tables and a few chairs at the sushi bar).  We found the food intolerably sweet or salty, overcooked, oversauced, and sloppily prepared.  My review is based on 3 items we ordered:\n\n--Dinner item #10. Sukiyaki: sliced beef, glass noodle, & vegetables cooked in broth.  It came with miso soup, salad and rice.  Intolerably SWEET broth, excessive onion (1/2 of a big one), good tofu and beef slices.  I could not drink such sugary broth despite my eternal love for soup.  5/10. \n\n--Sushi bar special #5. Lion King: crab meat, avocado, wrapped salmon baked.  Recommended by the waiter, so shame on him.  SALTY, OVERCOOKED, OVERSAUCED, MESSY.  They overbaked the roll and added excessive salt and mayo/eel sauce.  They baked the whole roll in aluminum foil and served the roll atop the foil, instead of baking only the salmon and then preparing the roll with the baked salmon.  With the same ingredients, Yuubi offers Pink Dragon roll - beautifully presented, clean, tasty, & cheaper.  4/10\n\n--Sushi bar special #12. Cliff House: crab meat, avocado topped with baked\nseafood.  Recommended by the waiter, so shame on him.  OVERCOOKED, OVERSAUCED, MESSIER AND SLOPPIER than Lion King roll.  4/10\n\nThe poor-quality food would keep me away forever.  Us included, there were only 3 occupied tables during the lunch rush hour on the busy Geary block.

We strolled in to a 3/4 full restaurant around 6:30pm and sat at the bar since we didn't call ahead.  We ordered the exact same thing we got the first time we were here, Maguro and Hamachi Nigiri and the Moon Dog and Ms Vivian rolls.  It was good but let me tell you about a few red flags we saw tonight.\n\nApparently they made an incorrect order of hamachi nigiri because we saw a plate sitting on the sushi bar counter for over 5 mins. The sushi chef realized his mistake and took it off the counter and continued to reuse the fish to make ours!  If you've ever seen Top Chef you know that Gordon Ramsey would flip out!!!  You DONKEY!!  But we figured that it wasn't out for thaaat long so we didn't say anything.  The pieces were kinda warmer than we would have liked and the maguro wasn't cut around the ligaments and was stringy.  We also noticed that the refrigerated door for the fish was frosted so we couldn't see what the sushi chefs were doing.  What are they hiding back there anyways?\n\nThe rolls were definitely NOT as good as the first time.  Maybe they were having an off night.  We wouldn't know; this was our 2nd time eating here.  After paying the bill, my BF watched one of the woman behind the counter make a roll topped with raw salmon.  She reached into a tupperware container filler with what looked like left over salmon pieces and proceeded to top this roll.  This container was sitting out on the counter the whole time we were there.  This was not kept in the refrigerated area with the other raw items.  \n\nI don't know if the incidents we witnessed tonight are \"normal\" in the restaurant business.  I think if I were a restaurant owner I would at least want my staff to recognize these are things to NOT do in front of customers.  We won't be coming here again.  The waitstaff was friendly but the food didn't meet the standards they set for themselves the first time around.

I really only eat nigiri sushi because that is the true test of a real sushi chefs sushi skill set... the rice that goes into the sushi. Most folks think it's the freshness of the fish or all the crazy sauce and other crap that goes into the jive ass rolls aka dragon and rock in this that roll. Yes freshness of the fish definitely counts but if the rice is not well seasoned and prepared then no matter how fresh your fish is its just no good.

The role is not filled with tons of imitation crab and no fish like many of the other Chinese own places but lots of fish with good fish to rice ratio and ingredients. The crunchiness of tobiko added a nice crunch and flavor to it which was nice. I'd get this roll again even though I'm generally not a big fan of rolls.

I do not know if I came in a bad day, however, for a reputable Japanese restaurant, the food was simply not acceptable.  When I came in, the restaurant was crowded however, a sweet waitress was able to fit us in a small table in the back, right by the kitchen.  Unfortunately, the smell of disinfect and soap permeated in the air, caught by my ultra sharp senses.  Btw, upon walking in, there was this prick berating one of the waitresses because he did not receive his shrimp tempura.  With his little daughter in tow, he still was able to act like a complete doosh in front of her, asking the waitress condescending things like if she spoke english.  The chef should have pulled out his hanzo blade and taught him a lesson.  \n\nSeated in the back, the place was so busy that the waitress forgot to give us a menu.  When I motioned the gf to get us some, the waitress snapped to attention, apologizing profusely.  She was literally so sweet that if there was a Yelp for waiting service, she'd get the maximum amount of stars.  Alas, there is not.  We ordered the agadashi tofu, lion king, sashimi assortment and an order of toro.  I really love tofu and the agadashi came piping hot.  The sauce that accompanied it was so good.  It reminded me of the house special tofu in Carmel and its accompanying sauce that I have put on a pedestal.  The tofu was very good, however, it is such an easy dish that's its pretty much the same everywhere.  The sashimi came next and instead of the traditional flat cut, it was cut more into cube pieces.  The salmon did not taste very good.  Usually, good sashimi melts in your melt.  Pls. view Sushi Ran or Akoni for more details.  The salmon was tough  and tasted similar to sake that I can get at Davis Sushi Buffet or Fujis.  The hamachi was equally tough however the maguro was good.  HOWEVER, GET THIS....THE TORO WAS SO BAD.  Toro is on the more expensive end of sashimi and because it is fatty tuna, literally melts in your mouth.  You barely need to chew.  However, the toro we got had ligaments and just did not seem like good quality.  The redeeming quality was the lion king, which was very good.  Many have attempted the lion yet it has rarely been duplicated.  Most places' lion kings just crumble when you touch it with chop sticks.  It is ironic that an americanized roll is the stand out dish in a traditional sushi restaurant when it should be the quality of the fish.  \n\nI had really high hopes for this restaurant, hoping it could by my SF Akoni or Sushi Ran, however, it really disappointed me.  However, I must say the waitresses are very sweet and I hope they can be employed by the restaurants I mentioned in the first sentence.  They forgot our toro order so gave us a third piece free of charge.", "author": "Brian V."}

However, what you will have is a delectable dining experience that won't  leave you unable to pay your rent. Chef Jin is always eager to welcome you into his humble eating establishment with a smile and even more eager to recommend what's the best of what he has to offer. Because of this I've become a regular here even despite the fact that I live only a few blocks from Ebisu (which isn't a bad place but nowhere near Ariake' s caliber)  I've even been known to show up more than once a week depending on how bad my withdrawals are.\nYes I order plenty of other things and they're all up to par.

Seems like when ever I want to eat something it magically happens to be at the same random 2 hours that the place is closed. On that note I still don't understand the whole being open for 2 and a half hours then closing for 2 and a half hours just to reopen. \nAny way, I went in and asked how long my order would take before I place the order (to go order) as I had to be back at work soon. The waiter/host told me it wouldn't take long at all and so I took him at his word and place my order to go.\nAfter waiting and waiting I get my food, I ended up with a few minutes to spare. The sushi chefs just took so long as they were talking to other customers over the bar that the waiter had to ask them multiple times where my food was. My food took so long (i couldn't give you a specific time frame as I didn't time it) that my poor waiter looked upset with the chefs when they gave him my prepared food order.\n\nNow to the food.\nI got about 3 different rolls and all 3 were horrible. The fish didn't have the flavor it's supposed to have and one of the rolls had a chunk in it. I don't know if that chunk was a fish bone or just a random hard chunk but either way if I wanted to find random hard uneatable chunk in my food I'd go get McDonalds.\n\nFor the quality of food and horrible wait that I had here I found the place to be over rated and over priced.

Sadly, the amount of eel was poor and the avocado dominated the dish. Worse yet, no wasabi was provided! In fact, counting all the sushi dishes order by the entire table we received only two small \"dollops\" of wasabi. The other diners reported their sushi was better, and the few other pieces I stole were, in fact, decent.\n\nFood was also brought out in a very strange order, with some diners receiving their entire order before another even received their sushi (to say nothing of their main dish). We then waited nearly 15 minutes after our plates were cleared before someone thought it would be nice to give us a check, or even swing by so we could ask for a check.\n\nThe tonkatsu I ordered was overly breaded, but the dipping sauce was more than sufficiently tangy, and the miso soup really hit the spot on a cold San Francisco evening.

I've been frequenting Ariake for the past 6 years and I make a point of trying all the good sushi places in the city. (Just haven't yelped them all yet!) When I was living in Japan and came back to SF for visits, I'd still hit up Ariake for it's wonderful fresh sushi delights.\n\nAll the raving you see on here about the Moon Dog is true -- if you like rolls, order one, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a roll fan, enjoy the sashimi or nigiri. Be sure to listen to the recommendations about what's fresh!\n\nThe head chef and owner Jin is the penultimate Korean sushi chef: highly skilled, super friendly, and charming too. If you've never been to South Korea, or known any Koreans sushi chefs who honed their skills in Japan, let me assure you that race does not matter.

I've lived in the neighborhood for a year and have tried a handful of sushi spots in the Inner Richmond, and by far Ariake offers the freshest sushi and friendly, attentive service mixed with reasonable prices. \n\nThree of us came in at 6:00 pm on a Thursday night -- hardly rush hour. Within 15 minutes, though, nearly the \"entire\" restaurant (maybe 10 tables and a sushi bar) was packed, which we took to mean that we made the right choice. The staff checked in with us every few minutes, though, so service was consistently top notch throughout the meal.\n\nEvery roll was delicious; we split one each of the Bob's Roll (best one for sure -- prawn tempura topped w/seared bonito & special sauce), Dragon Roll (standard eel/avocado -- but very fresh avocado made it stand out), Dynamite Roll (spicy yellowtail, salmon and tuna deep friend w/sauce -- yum) and Godzilla (fried yellowtail -- so so) roll. The nigiri rolls were especially good -- we recommend the white tuna and the salmon. Definitely could be a good quick date spot, or for a group of friends.\n\nAnd extra thanks for the extra effort on the part of the hostess -- I left my debit card behind, and she sprinted a block to catch up with us and reunite me with my one and only source of $$.

We went in around 6pm and there were only 2 other parties there but it filled up pretty quickly as we were having dinner.  They were nice enough to turn on the heater right above our table as it was a chilly evening.\n\nOur little table in the corner was nicely decorated with a fresh red rose.  A pretty nice touch.  The service was excellent and very efficient.  An empty dish never stayed on our table for more than a few minutes before being whisked away.\n\nWe ordered the \"Love\" chirashi, monk fish liver, and chicken teriyaki.  They were nice enough to substitute the salmon roe for extra hamachi, my fav fish, in the chirashi.  The sashimi in the chirashi was excellent, very fresh, and I enjoyed the other ingredients of the dish, the marinated bamboo (I think), the soy sauce mushrooms, the sprouts, shredded turnip, and tamago.  For $20, I was very satisfied.  The monk fish liver was nicely sauced, a bit soy and spicy sauce. Yum!  If you like liver pate, you'd like this dish.  The chicken teriyaki wasn't terribly special but a good portion and tasted like chicken teriyaki should taste, not over-sweetened like some places.\n\nOverall, a good dining experience.  Oh, their tea smells (and tastes!) so delicious after coming in from the cold!  Our dinner cost about $50 after already adding tip.

One, because you want to enjoy every little morsel of taste as it reaches your mouth w/o anyone swatting, screaming, or lunging at you and two, because I have a ginormous fear that I will poke above mentioned kiddos w/my chopsticks while attempting to tackle reason one. Not a pretty sight, folks.\n\nSo sushi it was and w/a dash of citysearch and a serving of yelp we stumbled across Ariake. And why yes, fellow yelpers, you are on the mark w/this one. If I were to gauge the cost of the sushi against the taste my belly and wallet would say, yay, I'm a fan and pat me on the back for being financially savvy. The Moon Doggie and Bob are my favorite. The spot is a little tight, but you really won't care b/c they are quite friendly and it makes it easier to ask the table/person next to you what they're having and what they think of it. (Now, I didn't do that but I saw a couple strangers discussing their plates and I'd like to believe it's not due to Christmas spirit.) So go, Ariake, it's yummy, I wish you luck in finding a parking space.", "author": "Cecile Q."}

The owner (who speaks both Japanese and Korean) is very friendly, and I think he actually remembers you after you've gone there a few times.  \n\nMy hubby and I tend to order all the fatty types of fish.  Unfortunately, that also means we rack up the bill whenever we go out for quality sushi.  But your money is always well spent here at Ariake.  You leave feeling as though your mouth just finished a two-hour massage.  \n\nThe last time we went, we brought a Japanese friend who is a foody just like us.  When the meal was over, she gave the restaurant her two thumbs up.   \n\nDon't go to Ariake unless you're willing to get only the best.  \n\nSome highlights were the toro, the uni (piled high) - sooo incredibly nutty, the amaebi heads (better than most places we've been to!  You could taste all the yummy goods in those heads when we went in early March 2008), and the liver (appetizer)) and the agedashi tofu (let it bathe in sauce that they provide for you and you will not regret it the least)... and just try something different.

However, after a few drives back and forth between Clement and Geary, we discovered this jewel.  It's somewhat hidden, and small.\n\nNobody was in there, so it made me kind of skeptical.  My parents always said watch out for the places with no customers.  It was late which was considerable but my perception of the Sunset/Richmond neighborhood is that there are always late-diners around here.  \n\nBut WHATEVER.. we just wanted to get our hands on some sushi/japanese food already!\n\nDecided to order the dragon roll to split between the two of us.\n\nNow I know my review is based on just one item, but that has probably got to be one of the, if not best already, BEST dragon rolls I have ever tasted.  It was extremely fresh and made with juicy goodness.  The roll came with about 10-12 pieces for $12.00.  Mmm, that was kind of pricey huh now that I think about it.. 1 dollar a pop! Dinner Bento Boxes were about something like $14.95 for two items, and $17.95 for 3.  A bit on the expensive side compared to many of the other restaurants in the area.\n\nI also LOVED that the restaurant was owned by authentic Japanese people, not by Koreans or Chinese, haha.\n\nDefinitely could be expecting a potential revisit from me in the future.", "author": "Leslie Y."}

I drive from San Jose, just to eat great sushi here.  The maguro mango roll is really good as well, bob's is an excellent choice.  Spicy scallop hand roll is almost a must try.  One other combination that Gin will make for me is the moondog handroll, yes its not on the menu but he will make it for you.  Gin also makes the moondog extra spicy for me, you can ask him I'm a fan of spicy food.  There's also a secret \"special roll\", as well with thinly sliced lemon peel, imitation caviar, and white tuna.  Tataki salad is really good and you can ask for a half size if there's only two of you eating otherwise its a huge plate, firecracker is our appetizer and always delivers on good taste.  Ariake roll is good, as well.  Fresh raw scallops are really good as well, with the combination of the sauce that comes with it.  I also always ask for unagi sauce on the side to change up the flavor of not having to have just wasabi and soy sauce.\n\nThere's only one roll i advise not to try \"dragon roll\" its the only roll that this place does not do right.  The eel tastes burnt for some reason.\n\nMy suggestion to people is to go here when they are not as busy, i notice that the waiter staff are sometimes inexperienced.  I never have a problem with that, but notice other people do.  That is why i sit at the sushi bar.\n\nThis place delivers their fish daily at lunch time, none of it is frozen and you can tell in the taste of the fish.

While it was very quant and charming, there are too many great sushi spots in SF to be sub par. That's exactly what this place was. Not bad... except for the fact that the waitress brought us hamachi and tried to convince us it was white tuna (I know what white tuna is - it's white!)

I'm not even sure how you can make foie gras using sushi (I can't remember which fish it involved, but I'm leaning toward something like hamachi). None of the other rolls stood out and their roll selection was somewhat limited. \n\nThe company was great (I love my friends), but all in all, the food itself and the service were both underwhelming. There was also a point during the night when the entire restaurant was watching American Idol playing on the screen. I can do that at home!

He's ultra friendly, and your food tastes better as you get friendlier. Yeah, the \"it's who you know\" rule extends to this restaurant, too.\n\nThe rolls are great, but the treats are in the nigiri. The geoduck, the toro, the salmon, the tai, all that stuff is mmm mmm goodness. I'm getting hungry thinking about it.\n\nThe one roll that comes to mind is the hamachi mango. Good stuff. The mild sweet/sour tart of the mango gives the roll a nice kick. One roll that I forgot the name of (I want to say Moon Dog) has this baked pile of creamy sauce+various seafood components. It's one of their few warm rolls, and has so many wonderful and rich tastes.\n\nThis place isn't all perfect, though. While the food isn't overly salty, I think they add MSG or salt or something to the rice, because I always leave this place really really thirsty, and I'm drinking tea the whole time! This place is also pretty slow, mostly because there's two main guys making the food and it's a popular place.\n\nMy tip for getting the most out of this place is ordering different kinds of food. I'm not talking getting the salmon and then getting the tuna. I'm talking get a couple rolls, get a few nigiri, get a hand roll. And seriously, get to know Jin. Early on, I made both mistakes.

The roll was great; the seaweed salad complimented the spicy tuna, and the red snapper was soft and melted in my mouth. Next, I had tamago, shima aji (yellow jack) and a dynamite roll (deep fried, spicy yellowtail, salmon and tuna). The spiciness of the roll did not overpower the taste of the fish,  the egg in the tamago was fresh and the yellow jack was fresh. Finally, I had aji (jack mackerel).

We ordered 3 rolls; the 49'er, Ariake, and Dynamite. We received our first two rolls maybe within 15 min. I noticed that they only had two chefs so we didn't say anything when we didn't receive our third roll. It was probably 30 min later and one of the waiters asked if we wanted our check. We told him we didn't receive our third roll. 15 min after that I figured they forgot and we decided to get the check. We told the waitress that we didn't receive the roll and just wanted the check. When she told the chef he proceeded to tell us in front of the whole restaurant  that he gave us the roll. I was shocked that he was suggesting we just didn't want to pay for it. It is a small place and the entire restaurant was starring at us. We were being nice by giving them time to get us our roll because they were busy and then they go off and pretty much act like we were trying to steal from them. I even tipped well because I know it wasn't the waitresses fault, but I would never got back to this place again. They were very disrespectful and rude when it was their mistake!

I know former locals that continue to return to Ariake time and time again to indulge in the delicious rolls. I order the mango hamachi roll every time and am never disappointed. Edamame is complimentary and they indulge me in my sake bombs. There is no pretension here and though the place is bustling, if there is ever a wait, it is usually not more than 5-7 minutes.", "author": "Renee B."}

I've never had a bad experience or meal here. Everyone is always friendly, the food is always good. Sometimes we get it to go and eat at the shop. The other day I was in there with the wife and we got, among other things, something called tatake, which I believe was some kind of tuna. it was kind of expensive, I thought, but ordered it anyway because I was feeling extravagant. As it turns out, it was actually kind of a value! There was a ring of fish all the way around the edge of the plate and then  a little mound of it in the center on top of grated daikon, green onion and watercress, I think. It was fucking awesome, and could have filled us up by itself had we only known. As it was we ended up gorging ourselves, having not anticipated the size of this dish and ordering a shitload of other stuff too. Anyway, the fish was marinated heavily in something really good, maybe including rice vinegar(?). Man, it was good. I could really go for some right now. I guess if you're not into marinated stuff you wouldn't like it, but I am and I did. Everything else was great also. I'm hungry.", "author": "jason s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-03", "description": "So, even 3 months ago I would have given this restaurant \"5 stars\" as the fish is always fresh and delicious and the prices are pretty reasonable for the quality.  However, the last time I brought a friend there, I felt like we were treated differently because we got the \"sampler platter\" instead of the a la carte items written on the wall.  The chef who had always been so friendly and nice to me was suddenly looking at me (and my friend) like we were second class citizens.  The sampler was ok (your standard tuna, salmon, halibut, etc) but I almost felt guilty for not getting the gourmet stuff.  A reputable sushi chef will do his best to impress you with his work, no matter if you are paying  10 or 1000 bucks for dinner.", "author": "Lisa K."}

I wasn't really into the rolls that were cooked, but the raw stuff was awesome.  I love that my friends love sushi (which is the reason I was here in the first place).  Definitely wouldn't recommend this place for big parties (we had 19 people).  Get the Moon Dog roll - super good!", "author": "Margie N."}

I really enjoyed the Sushis there which were at the right temperature, well cut and with a perfect texture. This place would deserve four stars if only I did not find an insect in my salad, and they did not come up with a miserable excuse \"it was a piece of dry onion\". I have never seen onions with wings :) But despite this important detail, it is a place worth trying.", "author": "Cedrick C."}
