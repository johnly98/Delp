It's literally out of this world and by far my favorite place for Greek/Mediterranean food in the area.\n\nSo, I came in last Wednesday with my friend around 11:15am. Not busy at all. We ordered two chicken shawarma - one with hot sauce and one without. Me plus hot sauce don't mix well so I had to opt out. However, I did ask my friend if she liked it and she said it was the perfect amount of heat. \n\nChicken shawarma - made with chicken, lettuce, sumac, and tzatziki. The chicken is infused with exotic flavor and the taste is incredible. The lettuce is fresh and the sauce... omg the sauce is what puts it all together to create an amazing wrap. With every bite you take, it's like a masterpiece of flavors and aromas in your mouth. Well worth it for $8.95 before tax.\n\nOverall, I love the chicken shawarma. Definitely my favorite.

Super sweet staff! I ordered the 7\" Gyros Pita (lamb & beef with tzatziki, lettuce, tomato & onion) and added on fries and a drink for the extra $3. Luckily I came after the lunch rush so I nabbed a table and my order came out just a few minutes after I sat down. The gyro was just perfection. Super tender and flavorful meat, crisp veggies, and a nice fluffy pita. The fries were also really tasty, but I had stuffed myself with the gyro so I barely made a dent in them. For $10, it was a really great value for the amount of food you get. \n\nThe only drawback is that this place is T I N Y.

Much better than those puffy pitas from the grocery store.  The gyro meat was thinly shaved, though not particular crispy.  I imagine they have such high turnover that it doesn't get much of a chance to sear on the spit.  Still quite tasty though.  The tzatziki was creamy and delicious.  A bit too much romaine lettuce; I had to sweep half of it off.\n\nFalafel: Perfectly crispy on the outside then firm and grainy on the inside.  It was a tad dryer than I like, but still enjoyable.\n\nFries: Medium thickness.  Not a limp fry in the batch.

I can't dance, even if Anthony Quinn was holding onto my shoulder as he kicked up his heels on a beach in Crete. My everyday plates are Corelle, so they bounce when you try to smash them. Nope, I'd make a lousy Greek, which may mean you have to take my review of Ayola with a grain of salt or maybe a grain of orzo. But hey, I'm a big fan of the one on New Montgomery where they do something nearly magical with their fries, so I'm not sure why this one doesn't make me want to go \"Ooom-pah!\" Part of it, I have to admit, is location, as this Ayola stands in the shadow of Baladie on the same block where their gyros wraps are outstanding as you gaze at the mural of Petra. Here you just gaze at the condiment stand.\n\nOn my first visit, I went for what I knew best, the $7.95 Lamb & Beef Gyros, the nine-incher as we say in the trade (..I have no idea what trade I'm taking about) with a splooge of tzatziki sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1COyXgo). It was certainly big enough with a decent amount of meat shaved from the spit (presumably), but the pita wrap was crusty to the point of jaw-tiring. What's more, the fries were dry like Sahara-dry (photo: http://bit.ly/1CcfJMh). Needless to say, I was not all that motivated to come back until recently when I had a hankering for some Greek eats for lunch but wanted to be a bit more mindful of the calorie count. This time I ordered the $8.75 Neptune Salad described as a \"Greek salad with tuna\". Well, not quite but it was still pretty good.\n\nIt was actually a pile of chopped Romaine with a few tomato wedges and even fewer Kalamata olives thrown in. On top was this mass of tuna that looked like it came from a can. Not that I'm complaining as I eat canned tuna voluntarily, but I had no idea Charlie the Tuna even knew the God of the Seas. Anyway, their special house dressing was on the side as were a couple of grilled pita wedges (photo: http://bit.ly/16Nld7Q). And halelujah, the fries were almost back to their magical form - hot, lightly crisped and oh-so plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/16Nll7a). It was enough for me to reconsider the gyros at some point when I can afford the carbs. In the meantime, I sat up in the balcony where they set up a counter for diners to have a panoramic view of the first floor. It's the nearest I'm getting to a vacation for the next couple of months.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...kinda hit-and-miss with their gyros and fries but the salad is pretty decent\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...small space, not that comfortable but the view from the balcony is just...oh who am I kidding?\nSERVICE - 3 stars...order and pick up, no big whoop\nTOTAL - 3 stars...will Anthony Quinn ask me to dance?", "author": "Ed U."}

The cashier thought that I was rushing and told me to take my time, but I was eating it voraciously not only because it was way past my lunch hour, (it was 3:30 for my lunch break) it was also too delicious to put the gyros down, but in my mouth!  \n\nTheir meat had flavor and it wasn't dry.  Of course, the hot sauce and yogurt sauce helped superbly!

The gyro was quite good, I really enjoyed the liberal amount of lettuce and tomato inside, but the pita was kind of dry on the edges. The meat was nice and tasty and moist and the tzatziki sauce was delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-20", "description": "Ayola is the FiDI's ideal launching point for a gyro trip.\n\nThe gyro comes with both 7-inch and 9-inch options, but unless you anticipate burning the midnight oil or work in construction, the 7-inch is recommended to prevent sudden onset nap syndrome. The pita is noticeably fresh and a great envelop for shipping the lamb and beef contents mouth-ward- it does not awkwardly crumble, an obvious characteristic of stale pita, and is not overly chewy, so to compare it to the necessary gum after. The tzatziki sauce permeates the gyro in appropriate amounts, negotiating harmony between the juicy slices of meat and crisp, veggie accoutrement. \n\nA true highlight of Ayola is the optional hot sauce stored in squeeze bottles by the utensils. The sauce is not overwhelmingly spicy and devoid of flavor, but instead a rich smokiness that perfectly complements the cool tzatziki. Beware the gradual spice buildup when progressing through the gyro, but the swirl of flavor high is well worth the slightly sweaty aftermath.\n\nAyola's fries, which can be added to any meal along with a soda for $3, are thick, crispy, and well-seasoned, and are as inseparable from the gyro as they are from their more famous burger cousins. The crispy fries' textural dance with the softer, yielding gyro is a spectacle for your mouth to behold.", "author": "Andrew M."}

This is definitely one of the better lunch options in the FiDi.  \n\nWhatever you order, make sure to take advantage of the turkish hot sauce, some seriously good stuff.  \n\nThe place is small and unassuming, not the type of place one would expect to be good, especially since the neighboring places (except Muracci's) are mediocre.

When I see a Greek place, I'd love to walk in, say \"Giassas\" and at least get a broken \"Ti Kanis?\" out of the proprietor. Please note that while three employees were working at Ayola today, not a single one spoke a word of Greek. That's lame... in fact, extremely lame. I mean, not that I have a problem with people cooking outside of their cultural heritage, but unfortunately, the impression got worse from there.\n\nThe cashier asked me if I was speaking Spanish to him... which was again, not so funny so much as very insulting. \n\nWhatever -- I was there already, so I went ahead and ordered a Gyro Platter. Now here, they did some good things. I asked for no tomato, and to their credit, I got none. The hummus was definitely a good consistency and flavor, although that little guacamole thing in the middle would have made my Yaya sneer. As it was, I didn't think it added anything positive to the flavor.\n\nThe pita was warm, and the gyro meat was fresh, so no real complaints there. Still, at nearly $13 for that platter and a drink, I think the meat-to-bread/salad ratio could have been a little higher. For the record, a \"Greek Salad\" in Greece almost never has lettuce in it though. I realize this is America, but lettuce is a lot cheaper than Kalamata olives, Feta cheese, and extra virgin olive oil. \n\nThe value wasn't really there for a relatively fast-food styled place, and their top-floor seating needs ventilation *badly*, but the food was not bad, but not great. The staff was certainly friendly and attentive, if a bit clueless. Either way, they should really learn some Greek.\n\nFor those of you rating this place on the quality of its gyro meat... seriously?

The lightly fried exterior offers a crunchy consistency without a greasy finish.\n\nOne thing I did not count on were the french fries. I nabbed a couple from my co-worker and had to order my own.

I do appreciate Ayola's tendency not to overdo it with the sauces though, unlike Baladie at times.\n\nFries: Another tie - Ayola's fries are more like Belgian frites and hold up better than Baladie's, while Baladie is more of a semi-shoestring variety with a lot more spice.  Were it not for the spices, Ayola would win out here, but both styles have their merits.  \n\nDolmas: Baladie - haven't tried the ones at Ayola yet, but for $3.75 for 4 of them, I'm not in a hurry and Baladie will do just fine.  \n\nHours: During the week, Baladie is open when I get off work, while Ayola closes at 5 so, yeah, Baladie for sure.\n\nOverall, Baladie wins out, but Ayola has a lot to offer also.  If Baladie took Ayola's meat, used slightly less sauce and adopted Ayola's fries but kept the spices, I think I'd have a nearly perfect gyro meal (the perfect one being my first from somewhere in Sepulveda over 20 years ago, and maybe the one I had in SOMA some drunken evening that I need to find again to verify its worthiness).  \n\nI'm sure I'll find myself here on some random Saturday again between 11 and 3.", "author": "Sus...

But, I am fairly certain the result was that I got fewer falafel pieces so that the chicken could fit into the wrap, while being charged for the full number of falafel PLUS the additional chicken. I say this because the pita was by no means bulging, and if the standard 7 inch pita contains only the three falafels I received, then it would be pretty limp.  This was not a huge issue, but enough to make me feel like I was getting slightly ripped off, and enough to bump an otherwise \"good value\" lunch into something I'd think hard about ordering again.\n\nI'll go ahead and give this 4 stars, but 3.5 is probably more accurate.", "author": "Rachel G."}

Now, its no secret that I am part greek by association of seriously close friends for the better part of my life and therefore, I feel qualified to take the pepsi challenge of sorts ... and this shit is good.  really lovely comfort food of a gyros, this is.  \n\nSee, I'm certain that I make my surrogate-yaya roll over in the grave by insisting that my gyros be accompanied with fries (y'know, much like they did in the old country ... I'm kidding, yaya ... please don't haunt me) ... but, in my opinion, finding a gyros place in this city that includes fries for pairing is like finding a hooker praying the rosary in church.  seriously rare. \n\nAnyhow, the fries are ridiculously perfect ... and truth be told, I'm not sure whether to get on bended knee and confess my love to margot b.  for the recommendation ... or really, to slap her since this little introduction today will surely take over the size of my ass if I'm not careful!  mmmmmmm.   so good!", "author": "Sarah K."}

My theory is that the heat has to be turned up enough and that all the meat gets about 1 turn of a good roast and then cut. So the cutter is just always cutting. I've seen this only a few times and they've been during the peak drunk hours of dining in Chicago Greek spots. \n\nNow that I've gotten my expectations out of the way, this place is not bad. It's pretty busy, so everything is pretty fresh if you go during peak hours. prices are a little costly, but very fair for California. Also keep in mind I expect to get a Gyro packed full of meat the size of my head for $3.50. They have a 7\" and a 9\". I opt for the 7\" with extra meat. \n\nI'm pretty happy this place is here. It's good. If it were in Chicago it would be just OK, but considering what we have to work with out here in the Bay, I rank this among the highest gyro spots in the bay.", "author": "Paul V."}

When my order came, I looked down into my pita sandwich and blinked. There were no chunks of meat; just many slices of extremely processed chicken. Now, I'm not against ALL forms of processed meat (god knows I consume enough spam), so I decided to give it a chance and bite in with an open mind. It was terrible. Didn't taste like chicken at all and the texture was so reminiscent of vegetarian fake meat that I scanned the menu to check if they in fact served a fake meat gyros. They don't. I'm really surprised no one else has complained about the chicken gyros - is this actually standard and I'm just being provincial? \n\nEven the fries were meh - a bit too salty and peppery. And I'm a girl who normally adds salt to her fries. \n\nTwo stars for nice people who work there and fast service.", "author": "Ada T."}

Not sure why cause usually I start to get hungry by about 1:30, but today it was just unbearable. I knew I had to eat something before it got worse.\n\nI wasnt too sure on what to eat. I didnt feel like eating rice and I wasnt too keen about getting a burger or hotdog. I was about to just go to subway and get a foot long or something..=_= when all of a sudden I remembered there was a place that sold Gyros.\n\nIve never had a Gyro before so I was thinking well might as well give it a shot...I always hear people saying its tastey and etc. So I walked to Ayola and noticed there was a line. Hmmm I guess it must be pretty good, I noticed that they have falafels and schwarma? wraps and  salads. I just stick with the Gyro (comes with lamb and beef and greens and red onions and their um tatziki? sauce). They have two sizes for the wraps and gyros a 7inch and a 9inch. There isnt much of a price difference for a larger size but I wasnt planning on falling asleep at work because of a food coma so i opted for the 7inch. They also have a \"value\" meal which they add fries and a drink for 2.25 more to your order which is actually a pretty good deal.\n\nOverall everything came out to 8.90, with drink and fries. Not bad, not bad at all~\n\nI have to say getting the 7inch was a smart move cause after devouring everything I realized I was quite full. Another two inches of Gyro would of probably killed me. The meat itself looked different like it was dry but tasted the opposite. The vegies were nice and crunchy refreshing and the sauce was good~ I was thinking that they might overdo on sauce but they actually did just right. \n\nThe fries were also quite good, seasoned with salt and pepper. Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. A good addition to the meal.\n\nSo for my first ever Gyro experience it was a success. Another place I can consider going out to lunch to. And now I can say that I have had a Gyro and it was such a good Gyro too~", "author": "phillip w."}

The whole office was ordering from here, so I decided to join in. I went for the Sparta Salad (greek salad with roasted chicken), hold the olives, extra feta. \n\nSo I get everyones order together, grab the menu and give them a call. 10 min later I show up at this location and found out that I had called their OTHER location on New Montgomery. Oh... No problem they said. They called over to that store, cancelled my order and then made everything here at this location. HOW AWESOME!! \n\nThe salad was amazing! Yes, a salad can be called amazing. The main thing I liked about it was the fact that the chicken was actually HOT. I have a thing against grilled chicken that has been chilled and put on salad. I hate it actually. This place keeps their chicken hot and fresh. And the dressing is great! \n\nI liked it so much, I went there again, the very next day! This time, I ordered from the right location. I must have mentioned to the guy that I was starving. It was a little after 2pm and I still hadn't eaten. So while I waited, he gave me some warm pita with a little hummus and that great slightly spicy green sauce that goes on top of the hummus, to much on. So nice! \n\nI love this place. GREAT food!

There's something about sweaty and then eating and then going back to an office that just doesn't jive with me.\n\nTemperature complaints aside, the food here is fabulous.  Those warm, soft pitas! They even use English cucumbers for the Greek salad and don't shy away from garnishing your plate with plenty of kalamata olives.  The spanakopita was yummy, especially when dunked in the creamy, minty tzatziki sauce.  Lastly, the egg plant salad is so rich and earthy, with little blasts of caper tartness.  \n\nThis is a great place if you want to go light with a flavorful salad or if you want to go cave man with a pile of meat- something for everyone, just wear layers so you can peal off your clothes as you mow though a heap of hummus.", "author": "Chalk A."}

I must have read through 20 reviews and no mention that their gyro meat is processed? \n\nWhile somewhat tasty, this knocks off a star off the bat. For traditional gyro and schwarma, head to Truly Mediterranean in the Mission. Lamb or chicken filets are stacked onto a vertical skewer and roasted for many hours to create something truly tasty. \n\nThe stuff at Ayola is likely provided by food supplier giant Kronos and comes preformed. \n\nIt was difficult to tell if they make their falafel from scratch but if they do, another point deduction is in order. \n\nAgain,  pretty tasty (well cooked fries, homemade hot sauce is excellent) but if the core part of their menu comes from a pre-processed tube, I can't see how one can give them 4 or 5 stars. \n\nDefinitely above average for your typical hole in the wall middle eastern/greek/turkish spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-09", "description": "So here's my two cents about the debate of the better lamb gyro between Ayola and Baladie.  If you like gyros that are made from freshly carved meat, fresh vegetables, and the kind of pita that is thick and soft (which, I do!), than Ayola is your place.  If you prefer your gyros with meat reheated in a microwave and in the thin pitas (that decrease the portability of the wraps because of pita sogginess), than go to Baladie.\n\nBoth are reasonably priced, but I prefer the gyros at Ayola for taste and for a choice between a 7\" and 9\" one.  My sister and I split the 9\", which with the addition of fries, was more than enough for both of us.  We ordered for lunch around 12:30 p.m., and though there was a line, it didn't take us very long to get our food.  In addition, the people behind the counter were very nice.\n\nThere is not much seating in the restaurant - just a few bar stools along a wall counter.

Then I found Ayola. I'm not a huge Mediterranean food fan, but this place is great. Got the gryo lunch special with fries and a drink for just under nine dollars. And the food is GOOD and FILLING. The meat is delicious, they give you a good portion of fries, and the hot sauce is legit. Add it all up and this is one of the best places to go for lunch in the FiDi.

Unfortunately, we never got together, but today when I was craving Greek food, I thought I'd go check it out. Imagine my delight when I discovered I wouldn't have to walk all the way down to NM, and could enjoy a location just 2 blocks from my office!\n\nI am currently in love with the Falafel. I've never been a fan, but thought I'd give theirs a try just in case I was proven wrong. I was. This is DELISH! Probably not on my diet, but who cares? Slightly spicy, not too dry, and the sauce that comes with them is divine. \n\nAnd the PITA!! Oh my heavenly PITA!! It's like little fancy clouds of love...super yummy to dip in both the sauce that came with the falafel and then the dressing - the mixture is fab!\n\nHaving a Greek Salad to go along with it - pretty standard combo of Romaine, olives, tomatoes, and feta - but the dressing is tasty and the combination of the falafel and salad make for a nice lunch. With a diet coke, I spent $11.21. Not terrible for a FiDi lunch! I'll definitely be coming back!!", "author": "Marissa M."}

Total cost: $9.42.\n\nGyros: Not too bad. Tasty meat, they didn't skimp on the sauce, and nice and filling. The only minor complaint is that the pita doesn't really close around everything, so when you get down towards the end, it becomes an exercise in keeping your pants clean. Still, very tasty, and that's what counts.\n\nFries: Pretty darn good. Salted and peppered just right.\n\nOverall, a pretty good experience. I'd definitely come back if I were in a gyro mood. They also have a few other things on the menu which looked good (falafel, chicken gyros, etc).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-15", "description": "This is probably an obvious tip for those of you who already work here, but when in the Financial District, avoid all food places from the hours of 12 noon-1pm. Which is why I always end up taking my lunch break at around 1:30-2 - it not only makes my day feel like it's going by faster when I get back, but the rush is just about beginning to dwindle at that time. When we got to Ayola today at around 1:45, the place was literally empty with maybe one or two lingering customers in the back.\n\nThe chicken shawarma is super tasty (all sandwiches have a small 7\" version or a large 9\" version for just a little more - the 7\" was more than enough for me, though). I ordered a value meal with fries and a drink and was so stuffed that I opted to take the five flights of stairs back up to the office later on. They crammed the pita to the brim with tender chunks of chicken meat - of the breast variety which I normally am not a fan of, but it was perfectly juicy and delicious with the homemade tzatziki sauce (not gonna lie I totally Googled the spelling of that) - creamy, cool, and extra tasty with the fresh chunks of tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. The whole thing was piled with fresh, crisp green leaf lettuce and enveloped in a huge hearty slab of pita that's warm, fluffy, thick and just a little crisp on the outside. Taking every bite was a little messy and as I sat outside on one of the sidewalk tables attractively wolfing my shawarma down, I didn't care at all because it was so good. Every bite was fulfilling and tasty. \n\nIf you order just a sandwich/main item, adding fries is $2 whereas making it a meal (fries and a drink) is adding on $2.25 so I obviously opted for that. Though it might help for some people to know that their sodas are canned and not of the fountain variety, which I prefer. No biggie, though. The fries were perfect! They were a little thicker cut than I'd normally prefer, me being a big fan of the McDonald's esque skinny fries, but I didn't mind so much this time when they were so crisp, delicious, and perfectly seasoned with a little bit of salt and pepper. Definitely recommended, though I couldn't finish my fries at all so I say that splitting them with a friend is a good idea.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try the beef and lamb gyro, which I also hear is excellent.\n\nAlso props to the lady behind the register who took pity upon me when I was short literally two cents and grabbed the change I needed from the tip jar and dropped them into my embarrassed hands. She also walked outside to give us the food and when I realized I forgot to grab a drink from the fridge, she offered to get it for me. Awesome service and delicious food.

Very fast and friendly service, which is always nice. The fries? Delicious! One of the best fries I've ever had. It was crispy with a small kick of spice. The chicken gyro was good, but I was slightly disappointed how the chicken was only lukewarm. I think it could have also used a little bit more flavoring... I don't know, something about it was a bit too bland. To compensate for that, I slathered it with the spicy sauce that they provide you on the side. The spicy sauce was GOOD. I can drink it straight out of a cup if I could. (Well, not really, but you get the point...) I will be back.

I love the warm fluffy pitas w/ generous amount of hummus, which is more portioned for a double order of pita.  The spanikopita is great and the fries are the bomb.  I have yet to try to the gyro, but it's on my to-eat list for sure!  Highly recommended for downtowners looking for a change up for lunch.", "author": "LT B."}
