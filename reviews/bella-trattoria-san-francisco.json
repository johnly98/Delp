Super cute date night spot with a very romantic atmosphere.\n\nWe came here on a Saturday night and made reservations at 8pm which wasn't too hard to do the day of.\n\nOrdered the 3 ingredient carbonara, braised pork pappardelle (a special that night), and the ostrich carpaccio.\n\nEverything was really good! We had never tried ostrich before and our waiter said it would be gamey but it didn't taste gamy at all. They put a decent amount of capers, greens, parmesan, and the ostrich was sliced very thin so it was very well balanced flavor wise.\n\nI think our fav pasta was the carbonara. Because they don't use butter or cream, it tasted very fresh and wasn't too heavy. They do put a decent amount of parmesan in it so it was still very flavorful. \n\nService was also on point. Our waiter was definitely italian which made the experience much more authentic :)\n\nAll in all, a great dinner and it wasn't super pricey either. I recommend this place if you want to have a pasta date.", "author": "Sheena N."}

Highly recommend for a date night! \n\nOur meals were served simultaneously within 15 minutes of wait time. I ordered the Tagliolini co' Salmone, which was topped with caviar. The caviar I received was orange; however, the photos I've seen from fellow Yelpers were black. The lack of consistency threw it off a little. Overall, the presentation was fantastic, the texture of the pasta was just right (chewy, but not undercooked), and the pasta sauce was just tasty enough so it wouldn't take away the rich flavor from the salmon.", "author": "Jamie P."}

So glad I made reservations bc it was pretty packed - side note I was able to get reservations on open table earlier that day. Probably because it was a weekday. Anywho, we got seated immediately. Wine list was great. Nice romantic mood - definitely do NOT bring your kids here. This is a date night spot for sure. Now for the good stuff - food:\n\nBruschetta - they brought this out for us complimentary. really good\nFried risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella - this was pretty good. There was something missing flavor wise though. Needed hot sauce or something\nCarbonara - yum yum yum\nGnocchi verde - wow. These are not your average gnocchi pieces. They are like little pillows that are so soft and melt in your mouth. The Gorgonzola cream sauce was delicious and paired perfectly with the spinach gnocchi\nTiramisu - topped with crushed almonds. Very interesting and I loved the crunch it added to each bite. Never had that before. The rest of it was so light and delicious\nHazelnut gelato - so good. Gelato was so creamy and delicious.

Although my sister was the only one running, I was there for moral support. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small, and since there was 10 of us, we made a reservation for 5:30 on a Saturday evening. We were a few minutes late but seated promptly. The restaurant had a few occupied tables but was filled to capacity by the end of our meal. The service was efficient although not particularly friendly. I don't think the guy smiled once the whole time but he was quick and on top of things which is what really matters, especially with such a large group. \n\nWe had a few bottles of wine and shared a few apps. The calamari was nice and crispy without being over breaded and chewy and the burratta was simple and delicious, but by far, my favorite was the manzo carpaccio. Arugula and a lemon, mushroom, caper salsa were the perfect accompaniments on the thin supple slices of beef tenderloin. Their complimentary house made bread with sun dried tomato olive oil was delicious as well. They also came around with a nice bruschetta amuse bouche. \n\nSince there were 10 of us, we pretty much ordered one of every entree. Everything was spectacular, no complaints from anyone. We were quiet for almost a full 10 min just enjoying the meal. (which is quite the feat for a Filipino family dinner!) \n\nOverall a solid authentic Italian restaurant.

The appetizers were very good, however the pastas were okay.\n- brussel sprouts: The mayo was a nice complement to the bacon flavor.\n- arancini: very cheesy and had a good crunch to it \n- calamari: this was a little different because it was almost like tempura instead of just calamari, and there was a side of sriracha mayo. This was definitely a nice twist to the calamari.\n- butternut squash gnocchi: I did not like this as much because it seemed like the flavors did not go together. The gnocchi itself was sweet, however the stir fry vegetables were a little too bitter/cheesy that it did not blend well in my opinion.\n- carbonara: I am a little biased because I do not like bacon that m much to begin with, so this pasta was just a little too salty for me.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Not sure how she is employed in the industry where you should have at bare minimum, some manners. \n\nAny who, onto the food.

Even though we didn't make a reservation, we walked in at 6:30 on a Tuesday and they sat us immediately. \n\nService/ambience was definitely the highlight. We received complimentary bruschetta to start and while our entire table was gluten free so couldn't eat it,  they returned quickly with an eggplant and cheese based appetizer instead. Throughout the evening, the chef came out to talk about the menu personally, deliver dishes, and explain our meals, and to finish, we received a complimentary panna cotta. All these things together simply made our table feel special, which really made the night for me. Feeling like a VIP makes eating out an entirely different experience, and Bella delivers this even to simple walk ins. It is always fun to feel really recognized by and engaged with the restaurant, and through these gifts and displays, the chef turned a casual dinner into a special dining experience.\n\nThe food was good too, but nothing amazing in my eyes. To start, we shared the warm spinach salad which was awesome and new, and the tri-color salad which was pretty typical of that type of dish. For mains, I had the smoked salmon tagliolini, which was good, relatively mild, a little sweet (the caviar an awesome, slightly sweet punch of flavor), and filling.. I ordered it with the gluten free pasta which was really good (the gnocchi is already all gluten free). I was happy with my meal but nothing I felt I need to have again soon. Someone else at the table ordered the orchiette which I might have actually preferred, as it was lighter and felt a bit more dynamic flavor wise. Plus, with the braised greens and lamb, it had quite a bit more going on and the flavor felt more robust, which is more my kind of dish.\n\n All in all good food, awesome service and dining experience, and great dinner out.", "author": "Tule H."}

I put our name down thinking this place is gonna be super packed only to discover that when we arrived the restaurant was empty! Literally no one at the bar and the second room was completely empty. \n- Several times I asked the waiter to bring out butter for the bread and he ignored me and the same thing happened for the check even though the restaurant was pretty quiet that night with about 4-5 other tables and several other waiters. \n\nFOOD:\n-  Squid Ink Pasta: There was no seafood at all in my squid in pasta and the sauce tasted like plain tomato paste. In addition my noodles were extremely al dente. I like al dente but these were borderline hard where even my friends noted it.

But other than him, I've had only nice waiters and waitresses 4/5\nFood: the complimentary bread and spread is so delicious. The sundries tomatoes in olive oil is such a good combo I always want two servings and they always happily oblige. My favorite pasta dish so far is the one with Italian sausage.

The water they have tastes so purified. It is definitely not gross tap water. We ordered the parmigiana and bruschetta for appetizers. The bruschetta was amazing. It had a perfect slice of mozzarella on top and when you bite into it the bread was the perfect crunch. It didn't hurt to bite into the bread, the tomatoes didn't fall off, the whole cheese isn't slide off the top. The parmigiana was good. I wish it had more cheese, but it was perfectly cooked. It wasn't mushy or too hard. I was beautifully made. \nI've never had pasta with salmon and roe until tonight, and it definitely was not a disappointment. We also order the frutt de mar and it was a tiny bit spicy and I was thrown off by the squid ink noodles, it was still so good. We also ordered pappardelle al burro and the truffle butter in it complimented the meat perfectly. We also had the tiramisu and the vaniglia affogato and they were both delicious. The service overall was amazing. They checked up on us frequently but not too often where it was a bother. I wish there were an option for 6/5 stars because that's what they would have gotten.

I did, multiple times. To absolutely no surprise I never heard back... so like I said about the service...\n\nI have been to Bella four times now so that should tell you that the food is good. The food is actually really good! The service is terrible unfortunately. I waited to write this review because I was hoping to give them a chance to redeem themselves but it's always the same - wonderful food, terrible service. If you can put up with the wait and the service, the food is worth it. \n\nOn my first visit we waited for two hours for two pasta dishes. They came to our table apologizing at the two hour mark saying that their pasta maker was broken. While unfortunate for a restaurant that makes mostly pasta, things happen. They made us dessert for our bad experience. Water under the bridge. \nThe second visit a few months later, the same thing. Seems a bit odd. The third visit after a half hour of waiting we had to get up and ask the hostess for a few menus, water, and a server. Took about 15 more minutes for that. So after about an hour of waiting we got service and placed our orders. We ended up getting our water and food but never did get the wine we had ordered with our meal despite our multiple requests as to if our wine was coming. Last night was the 4th time we went. We arrived, got seated and the server was right with us. Everything was overall better than our past experiences however, we had to ask her multiple times for silverware. We asked her twice for more bread and water which never came so we had to get up and go to the kitchen and ask someone over there to help us. \n\nSo again, all in all the food is amazing but they really can't seem to get it together with staff and service. Luckily we are very patient and the food has always been worth it in the end. I do have to say with this being the 4th time of really poor service we'll probably not go back. Maybe we'll just order take-out if we miss it. While the food is amazing, if you're looking for a good overall easy and enjoyable experience there are other places I'd recommend highly over Bella.", "author": "Lauren P."}

We decided to go to an Italian restaurant close to her grandmas house and we ended up here because the other Italian spot down the street was packed.\n\nThis place wasn't packed but it was a Monday night at around 7;30\n\nWe have all been through alot so we decided to order literally almost the entire menu.\n\nThe special pizza with pine nuts and gorgonzola, a pesto stuffed eggplant, carpaccio (wasn't the freshest), a few Cesar salads, and a few pastas; pesto, spinach and egg and the carbonara.\n\nThe pizza was decent, very bready and not enough topping.\n\nOut of the pastas, id recommend the carbonara, it had the most flavor, very rich sauce almost like a hollandaise carbonara, the sound of it may be off putting, but it was still tasty. The spinach and egg pasta was good too but I almost got an immediate stomach ache, and the pesto was very fresh and herbaceous but lacked complexity beyond the creamy herby flavor.\n\nThe carpaccio kind of tasted like the meat had previously been frozen, there was just a sharp iron taste, like a collection of iron in a specific bite I had. Once I covered the carpaccio in lemon, pepper, mustard and olive oil it tasted a bit better.\n\nId recommend the eggplant, it was just a pleasant small bite with pesto sandwiched between thin pieces of eggplant\n\nEverything was good overall, the only thing that wasn't amazing was the service, we couldn't really tell which one was our server and they seemed annoyed with us ordering damn near the whole menu, but we didn't care cause were happy to be alive, thriving and eating noodles in San Francisco.", "author": "Megan K."}

We had a reservation for 6 pm, which wasn't needed at the time, but I would recommend making a reservation if you plan to eat after 6:30 as the restaurant filled up quickly. Also, don't be alarmed when you arrive and the restaurant looks closed due to the worn down windows. \n\nThey started us off with a bread basket, which looks like your plain jane white soft bread, but omg it was so fresh and soft. It literally came straight from the kitchen and we devoured it instantly. Obviously when they asked us if we wanted a refill, we couldn't decline. In fact, we even wanted and could have ate a third basket had they not forgotten.. \n\nBetween 3 people, we shared the meatballs for an appetizer. To my surprise, they weren't your standard medium / large size meatballs - they were rather small (think IKEA meatball sizes), but they were so tender and delicious. Definitely one of the best I've had. The sauce was fantastic as well as we kept dipping our bread in. For entrees, we went with the thin noodle, which comes with pancetta and truffle oil; the pappardelle with ragu; and the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce. The thin noodle was an after thought order after I was informed that they ran out of the squid ink pasta that I really wanted, which was disappointing at first because the restaurant just opened.. FYI - the menu presented in person was completely different than the menu online; all of the pasta entrees online pretty much aren't on the menu in person. However, all of the pastas were delicious. I loved the thin noodle as the noodles were perfectly cooked, the pancetta wasn't too salty, and the truffle oil really came through. Then, I'd suggest the pappardelle as the ragu was yummy. The spinach gnocchi was good, but didn't really stand out to me. The gnocchi was made too small, so it lacked texture, and the sauce was too salty and much for me. \n\nAll in all, if you're craving pasta, stop by Bella.

Upon entering, we were asked if we had made a reservation. Seems like people normally make reservations here. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a fancy Italian restaurant on Geary Boulevard in the Richmond district. The ambience inside could be the best described as cozy and familiar, even though the owners seem to go to any lengths to make the restaurant as dim as possible. The restaurant also boasts a small bar with about four seats at the very back of the dining area.\n\nOnto the menu. Apparently it changes daily, and on this particular day, I ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and a pasta that prominently featured mussels and clams (but not the Frutti' 'E Mar). The brussels sprouts were extremely impressive, especially for such a simple vegetable. The outside was crispy but not overdone, and the inside was soft but not mushy, a perfect combination of textures. The pasta was also splendid; just like the brussels sprouts, the pasta was at the same point of perfection for texture and was accompanied by an aromatic white wine sauce. To top it all off, our waiter offered a complimentary Italian dessert, similar to a ricotta cheesecake.\n\nIf I were in the San Francisco area again, I would revisit this restaurant but will keep in mind to make a reservation.", "author": "Benjamin C."}

The next time around I was on a date and I ordered the Tagliolini Salmone which was pretty darn good. The salmon had a smoky taste to it. Personally it was a bit on the salty side but granted the waiter did tell me about this when I was asking for help choosing a plate so I was more than aware of it. My date ordered the Tagliata al Gorgonzola and oh my that steak was sooo delicious. I've always feared going on a date and liking my partner's plate more than mine but I gotta say it was pretty darn even this time.

They do take reservations but both times I went were on a weekday so I was able to sit down without a reservation and no wait time. If you're attending on a weekend I do recommend a reservation because I do live right next to the place and see how busy it gets with people standing around outside of it.", "author": "Melanie L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-10", "description": "TL DR; Overall Great food. Would recommend and come back again for the pasta. Always ask for recommendations as the food varies from day to day.\n\nFor my visit on 9/9/2017 I ordered/received the following:\n\nBread (Free):\nI was initially disappointed with the bread that was provided with tomato and olive oil. It tasted stale like it should tossed 1-2 days ago. There was way too much olive oil and it masked the taste of the sun-dried tomatoes. The flavor of the sun-dried tomatoes were absolutely amazing, but was too subtle. I lacks a robust taste that would have complimented the bread well. They brought another serving of bread, but it was burnt. Extremely disappointed that they were willing to serve burnt bread.\n\nBone Marrow ($14):\nIt was decent for the price. It was way too under cooked. It did not compliment well with the toast provided, but was actually a lot better when eaten with the free bread. I recommend eating it with the free bread as it will help absorb the salt and fat to not overload your taste buds.\n\nPasta:\nMaccarun Ca Salsiccia ($16):\nCompared to the La Vera Carvonara, this ranks lower, but is still superb. I normally do not like peas, but it goes well with this dish. \n\nLa Vera Carbonara ($17):\nThis is the star of my visit. Most places that do a La Vera Carbonara wait too long before adding the egg causing it to be not so creamy, but they made this perfectly. The flavors mixed will together and they were able to create a rich, deep taste with only 3 ingredients. Would come back just to eat this.\n\nBruschetta Mozzarella: \nThis made up for the very lacking bread with tomatoes and olive oil. The bread was fresh and not overly toasted. It had the attention to detail I was expecting and the tomatoes had the robust flavor I was looking for. Mozzarella was subtle and helped the tomatoes shine by enhancing the taste.\n\nDessert Panna Cotta:\nThis was very well made and they let us end our meal strong. Most of these are usually made with too much gelatin but this was not the case. It had a good combination of gelatin and cream. Fruits were fresh and sweet. No real complaint for the dessert.\n\nOverall: The meal started of weak and was not going very good, but they stepped up their game at the pasta and it changed my bad experience to a good one. The chef afterwards went the extra mile by coming out and talking to all the customers who were still there. I appreciate these small acts of ensuring customer service.", "author": "Jimmy I."}

The entrance is located at the corner of the street and is a tight entryway. We were swiftly seated even without a reservation on a Thursday night. I was glad the place wasn't too crowded. Although the venue space isn't that large, they did a good job arranging the tables to fit the most amount of customers in here without it being too cramped. \n\nOur server greeted us warmly and gave stellar service throughout the night. The other servers would also check in and help out with the dishes, and they were all very lovely waiters and waitresses. We ordered the Arrabiata Calabrese (squid ink pasta) and the Pasta Carbonara. They have a lot of off menu items so be sure to ask the waiter. We then received complimentary bread with sundried tomato oil which was surprisingly really good even though I don't like tomatoes. The pastas came and both looked very yummy and unique. I have to say that both were very good - the arrabiata had a kick to it that tasted like Korean food and the carbonara was very rich. However, both of them were on the saltier side so be prepared to drink lots of water. Another pro of this place is that they give complimentary panna cotta for dessert. This was delicious as well. I really enjoyed the complimentary dishes here and their pastas tasted very authentic!", "author": "Catherine S."}

Not sure why we deserved it, but we received complimentary bruschetta for an appetizer and a panna cotta for dessert - both were very good! Service was very friendly and attentive, although I wish there was more conversation about the restaurant. Still, we felt very welcomed.\n\nWe ordered several pasta dishes (Tajarin, Arrabbiata, Sorrentina and Carbonara) as well as the Sicilian Arancini. Overall, these were good, but missed on being great. In particular, the Carbonara was over-sauced and dark (see attached photo and compare to other photos of Carbonara for this restaurant) and the gnocchi in the Sorrentina was too soft (perhaps overcooked).

I've never seen that combo anywhere else but all three are delicious and worth a visit alone.\n\nTheir pasta is amazing, I've had almost all options and everyone it's a spiritual dilemma picking just one, throwing specials into the mix creates a civil war for the palate. If one day I give up on my health and decide to became the 400 pound man you will find me ordering and eating every pasta dish Bella offers. Their gnocchi is light and fluffy, combined with perfectly seasoned Italians sausage. Each bit is life a perfectly spicy pillow of pasta. The pasta puttanesca has more class and refinement than any royal family. I can think of no better way to clog your arteries than their carbonara.\n\nIncredibly Bella also has excellent non pasta entrees, I assume because the chef is some sort of food saint trying to guide humanity towards divinity through our taste buds. Their hanger steak will make you reevaluate what the best cut of meat is, I firmly believe that all trout view ending up in Bella's kitchen as Valhalla.\nIn short Bella Trattoria is one of the best Italian spots in the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-25", "description": "How to pretend like you went on vacation to Italy while in SF: dine at Bella for craft pastas with the backdrop of a gorgeous (and quite realistic) mural of docked gondolas overlooking the Venice waterfront. \n\nGood Italian food can be challenging to find in these days of cookie-cutter lasagna and fettuccine alfredo, and Bella Trattoria is a gem tucked away in a corner in the Inner Richmond. The neighborhood is a lot more calm than the crowded/semi-touristy/quasi-racy North Beach area, and parking is actually not impossible. \n\nBella's menu features an enticing selection of pastas, a handful of entrees, and some apps. The real star is the pastas, which are made fresh daily o__O If I lived closer, I would be inclined to adopt a mindset of gotta try 'em all.\n\n(+) Bread with sundried tomato dip (complimentary): Not the best bread and dip I've had, but does set you in the mood for Italian food. The bread is buttery than most breads, a bit heavy with olive oil-based dip. The sundried tomato did not have much of a wow factor; the highlight was the softness of the bread.  \n\n(++) House cocktail ($7; vermouth, prosecco, orange): Described as \"the negroni gone wrong\", this rogue cocktail takes all the bitterness and alcoholicness out of the classic negroni and makes this very drinkable. It borders on a girl drink, presented elegantly in what looks like a tall shot glass. Would recommend for the general population, though not necessarily for anyone hard-core about strong whiskey and the like.\n\n(++) Bruschetta (complimentary): Despite usually being underwhelmed by chopped tomatoes on bread... this is probably the best chopped tomatoes on bread I've ever had. The base was a delicious buttery toast, topped with garden-fresh juicy tomatoes and aromatic basil garnish. \n\n(+++) La Vera Carbonara ($17.5; pancetta, pecorino, egg; no cream or butter). I can't believe it's not butter!! A lighter but extremely satisfying rendition of carbonara. The construction of the sauce from purely pecorino and egg makes for a simple and classic, yet unique and novel flavors. I'm still fascinated by the 3-ingredient composition. My only gripe is that the pancetta is chewier than I would have liked. \n\n(+++) Gnocchi Verdi ($18; spinach gnocchi, shiitake mushrooms, raddichio, gorgonzola bechemel): Although I'm usually not a gnocchi fan (hence my frequent mispronunciation), these little green dumplings were the most memorable bites of the night. The gorgonzola bechemel and raddicchio created a savory sauce heavy with smoky dimensions.The addition of the mushrooms brought back childhood memories of cream of mushroom, only with complex fine-dining-esque flavors. As for the gnocchi itself, it featured the Goldilocks ratio of al dente and softness; the satisfaction of biting into just the right texture was like finding the perfect boba.\n\n(++) Panna cotta (complimentary): I like how it's not too sweet, very vanilla-y, and well complemented with berries. Nice ending to the meal when there isn't quite enough stomach space for tiramisu. (Oh first world problems...)\n\nAs Yelpers have mentioned, the ambiance is cute and intimate: you won't fail to impress whether for date night or a nice family dinner. The lighting is dim with modern pendant Edison bulbs, but not so dark that your food pictures look abominable. \n\nService was efficient and quite gracious, as they did not frown upon my mispronunciation of gnocchi nor my choice of clothing (hospital scrubs do not seem the most fitting in an upscale Italian restaurant). \n\nThe verdict? Excellent food at reasonable prices, and still cheaper than going to Italy. Ciao!", "author": "Edna C."}

Located in the Inner Richmond district, surrounded by Asian food options, we were pleasantly surprised to find this cute little restaurant serving tasty homemade Italian food. While Bella Trattoria isn't my favorite Italian restaurant in San Francisco, it's a solid option especially if you live nearby. I live near Delfina and Locanda, so I have high standards, but certainly enjoyed my meal that night.\n\nOur favorite dishes of the night were: \n* grilled meatballs with eggplant-tomato caponata (Purpett' a' Mammeta): While the meatballs were good but not spectacular -- they were a bit too dense and rubbery for our liking -- the sauce they came in was to die for. We were busy scraping up every bit of the delicious tomato cream sauce full of zucchini, eggplant and tomato which enrobed each little meatball.\n* the special osso bucco pasta with fettuccine: Luscious creamy sauce with mushrooms and carrots and chunks of tender osso bucco (veal shanks) coated each delicious al dente strand of fettuccine. It was by far our favorite dish of the night. I would highly recommend an order of that pasta if you can.\n\nSome other tips/notes: \n* Restaurant is small, with dark wood and dim lighting. Good for dates or intimate dinners with friends. \n* Reservations are recommended.\n* Skip the pesto gnocchi if you can. (lacked seasoning)\n* Service can be slow, be prepared. \n* Complimentary panna cotta at the end of the meal was a nice touch. \n\nFind a full review and photos on my blog: http://www.vcinthekitchen.com/bella-trattoria-sf/", "author": "Vic C."}

I have passed by Bella many times, but didn't know what to expect. Except for the sign written in cursive, the exterior reveals very little about what lies inside. It was pretty dark inside, but I could still make out a large picturesque painting of a dock. There is also small bar against the back with a wrought-iron Bella sign above it. Now I know what the term 'neighborhood gem' means. Who'd have thunk there would be an awesome little Italian restaurant across the street from a Burger King? \n\nThey started us off with some complimentary bread & tomato aioli. Then, as a small taster, they served us a little crostini with pesto. It was good, but I thought it was a little odd to offer bread on top of bread.\n\n$14 Bone Marrow, Roasted Veal Bone Marrow, Grilled Levain, Parsley Caper Salad:\nTwo halves of a bone were plated on a cutting bread. The server briefly instructed us to scoop some marrow on the bread and top it off with the parsley salad and eat it together. The marrow was rich like butter, and a crispy crust almost formed on top. The parsley added a lot of bitter flavor that helped cut through the richness, and came together nicely on the toasty levain.\nBetween Mr. Joy & I, the bone marrow felt pretty heavy. Then we began to chat with the very friendly owner and he pointed out one of his patrons, who goes for a double order of bone marrow on the regular. Just then, a server brought out 2 orders of bone marrow over to a table for one. Wow, I'm impressed.\n\n$17.50 Carbonara w/ Pancetta, Pecorino, Egg:\nCarbonara is one of my favorite pastas. I was pleased to see that they make theirs without cream or butter, not that I have anything against either of those awesome ingredients. I have dabbled a bit in amateur Italian cooking and I've learned that you can get a super creamy sauce with an egg & enough parmesan and/or pecorino. This was definitely super rich and creamy with a ton of cubed pancetta and cracked black pepper. The fettuccine noodles were cooked al dente. I was starting to get full from all the rich, heavy food, but I finished it because I couldn't stop eating it.\nWe also ordered a seafood pasta with mussels, clams, calamari, and a couple of scallops in a tomato sauce. That was very delicious too. \n\nWe were a little too full for dessert, but they brought us a complimentary panna cotta with sliced strawberries and blackberries, in some kind of strawberry sauce. Though gelatinous in form, the texture was super smooth and creamy, almost in a melt-in-your-mouth kind of way. The cold, sweet dessert was actually very refreshing after all the rich food.", "author": "Joy W."}

We had dinner reservations this evening to celebrate Mother's Day a little early. Quite difficult finding parking as it always is in this area. I was lucky to snag a spot two blocks away. The place itself is very tiny, but very cozy. I would recommend making a reservation since the seating is very limited.\n\nWe started off with bread and sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. The bread was soft, mm. We started off with the bruschetta as an appetizer. It had basil, olive oil, mozzarella and tomatoes. It was delish. Now, for entrees. I ordered the frutt' e' mar which was squid ink spaghetti, prawns, calamari, mussles, and manila clams in tomato sughetto. I felt adventurous tonight.. I don't think I would've tried something that had 'squid ink' in the description otherwise, but I don't regret it! It was AMAZING. Very unique how the noodles were black in color from the squid ink. The seafood was fantastic and full of flavor. The sauce wasn't heavy (which is usually the reason why I hate eating pasta) - it was flavorful and light. This is now my favorite pasta... but I never had a favorite to begin with, lol. \n\nOther things my family ordered were the pasta norcina, and some sort of seafood stew which was like the frutt' e' mar that I ordered, but without the noodles. The pasta norcina was pretty basic and the sauce was too heavy.\n\nI would come here again and again for that squid ink pasta....I seriously loved it! My tummy was very satisfied :)", "author": "Sydney C."}

Make sure you ask if you want it! The bread was soft, and I loved the sun-dried tomato dipping oil. Just wished that the bread was warm because it was cold when we got it :( Still good, but could've been great if they warmed up the bread.\n\nI love bone marrow, so we ordered that as an appetizer. The bone marrow by itself was on the salty side a little more so than the usual, but eaten with the bread and parsley salad, it was great. Super rich and buttery like good bone marrow shouldbe.\n\nAt this point, our server randomly gave us two pieces of bruschetta on the house. Nothing spectacular, but hey it was free! An unexpected small treat.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the smoked salmon tagliolini with black caviar (Tagliolini Salmone) and the squid ink spaghetti with seafood (Frutti Mar). I LOVED the squid ink spaghetti. Great amount of seafood, PERFECTLY cooked al dente pasta, and the tomato sauce was so good that I started eating it by the spoonful by itself towards the end. \n\nThe smoked salmon pasta was more subtle. The pasta sauce was a little bland by itself, unless you got a bite with the smoked salmon or caviar. It was good, but I ended up wishing that there was more smoked salmon (even though they didn't necessarily skimp), just to make every bite as good as the ones with the salmon.\n\nWe ordered the panna cotta for dessert, as per Yelper recommendation. They put a little candle in it for my birthday and also gave us two mini glasses of dessert wine to go with it--Another unexpected treat on the house. The panna cotta was creamy yet light, and it went well with the tartness of the berries. Didn't think it was as amazing as others made it to be, but still good.\n\nOverall, the stars of our meal were the bone marrow and squid ink spaghetti with seafood, plus the great service with unexpected items on the house. Well-deserving of 4 stars.", "author": "Sara L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "Update after the reply from the restaurant owner: I just had to now minus from 3 to 2 star because first of all since you know your place is small you shouldn't squeeze people in giving short dining experience if you care so much about customer service. You coordinate each reservations giving customers at lease 2hrs of dinning experience. 2hrs at lease gap between each RSVP. You should tell all your customers there is an 1 1/2 gap for dinning before the next group needs your table and you can not be late or you will loose your table than I would reserve it at a later time to insure my party serve to your restaurant rule. Oh by the way other restaurants with great customer service can accommodate customers with minimum of 2hrs dinning and yes I have been to restaurants that tell you a 2hrs dinning or lose of table but still was so good to still accommodate longer than 2hrs dinning and finding a table for those that are late. I'm honest and still recommend the restaurants to others that must be on time, 1 1/2hr dinning, no kids and small party of 4 or less since the place is small. \n\n\nLet's start with customer service. I did not appreciate the host telling me they have a large party waiting for our table at 9pm when our reservation was at 7:30pm. Minimum should be 2hrs especially for a party of 10 and 2 toddler overall large party. I know our party was late but we already started ordering which by the time food arrived my party arrived and ready to eat. Since it was almost 9p,  we rush to eat and order our dessert even though not everyone finish their main dish. Last we ask for the check at 9:15p is when the host came back and said we found another table for the 9pm party so we can stay. WTF, Now you tell us after we rush through eating and drinking because we are better people and considerate to considered their business even though it's wrong and rude on their part. I wanted to give them no stars which I can't, so I guess one star. I change it because the skinny waiter was so nice and friendly to us and the kids that I added an extra star. I hope they promote him and give him a raise. Last another  star was for the food. Food is ok but not the best compare to the restaurants at little Italy next to Chinatown. Now would I recommend this to others? Yes only if you don't have a large party no more than 4, no kids and must be on time since you only have an hour and half to order, eat and pay.", "author": "Christy V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-14", "description": "I don't often make it out to Italian restaurants because I'm not a fan of pasta and meatballs, but my coworkers were craving Italian food, so I decided to give it a shot. We made a reservation for 5:30pm on Wednesday and arrived at 5:25pm to the restaurant doors closed. This was very unusual, as the Yelp opening time said 5:15pm. We stood by the door and the employees inside could see that we were just a bit confused, so one of the employees came to open the door and acted somewhat shocked that we were surprised that they hadn't been open. He started telling us that they generally open by 5:30pm, but we notified him that they should adjust their Yelp so customers don't get confused when they arrive earlier. Nevertheless, we were the first ones there and were given the choice to sit wherever we pleased. Once we were seated, we were given the menus and served cold water and fresh bread with olive oil and sun dried tomatoes. \n\nWe proceeded to order two appetizers:\n\n1. Bruschetta Ca' Pummarola -- Crispy bread with olive oil with some freshly diced tomatoes and basil, topped with fresh mozzarella cheese. This was definitely a favorite of ours because it was extremely fresh and had you wanting more.\n2. Purpett' Della Mamma --Grilled meatballs in Eggplant-Tomato Caponata. This dish had great flavor and could definitely be ordered as a main course. There were a decent amount of meatballs, somewhere between 5-8. The veggies and sauce paired very well with the meatballs and the overall flavors were superb. \n\nMain Courses: \n2 of us ordered the La Vera Carbonara; which was hands down some of the best pasta that I've tried. It's really hard to impress me with a pasta dish, but I have to say, this dish did just that. It was really hard to believe that there was no butter or cream in this pasta, because it was VERY creamy and tasty. I'm not sure how it's prepared to taste this way, but it's definitely a must try.\nMy other friend had the Maccarun Ca Salsiccia, which was rigatoni pasta, with tomato cream sugo and Italian sausage with green peas. This pasta dish was overall tasty as well, but I wasn't as impressed as with the La Vera Carbonara, because I felt like there was too much of the tomato sauce, which I'm personally not a fan of. \n\nOnce we finished with our dinner, our server was nice enough to bring us Panna Cotta on the house. The Panna Cotta was very light and served with fresh cut fruits, making it very refreshing after our dinner. This was definitely a nice gesture after the initial encounter with the restaurant being closed when we arrived. I have to say that I was quite impressed with the entire meal. It very much felt as if it were home-cooked and made with love. \n\nI'll be coming back to try some more of their food items. Hopefully next time they will have bone marrow and the Papparedelle Ragu!", "author": "Julia K."}

Bella Trattoria is found on the busy street of Geary Blvd in San Francisco, where there are a number of businesses ranging from restaurants, retail shops, and even car dealerships.\n\nBella Trattoria is a quaint space that has an ambiance for the PERFECT first date. It is usually packed during the weekends, so I would suggest making reservations before arriving here - depending on the day that you come, of course. My experiences here have always been positive. With or without a reservation, the host in the front of the restuarant immediately greets our party the minute we step into the restaurant. After being poured a nice glass of wine by our waiter, we are offered an appetizer \"on the house\" by the chef. While enjoying our free appetizer, I have the opportunity to look over the menu. The food menu is just as extensive as the wine list they offer at Bella. With the variety of pasta dishes, they offer a number of Italian dishes such as gnocchi, lasagnas, and carpaccio.\n\nMy favorite dish would be Tagliatelle Ragu made with Salmon and Caviar. With the pasta handmade in their kitchen, the craft and time put into the dish is noticeable as you take your first bite. A second favorite I would recommend on trying would be their gnocchi. Again, their gnocchi is also handmade in their very own kitchen, which brings out the great quality taste. The softness of the dough and the house made sauce complements the two ingredients remarkably. \n\nThough with the glass of wine, appetizer, and your main dish may be filling, please try to save room for some dessert! Bella Trattoria serves an arrangement of desserts that delectable and a perfect way to end your meal. My all-time favorite dessert from Bella Trattoria would be their Panna Cotta, which at our first visit to the restaurant, was given to us for free as compliments from the chef. \n\nBella Trattoria is easily one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Bay Area.", "author": "Victoria K."}

I came in with my cousins and felt guilty when she asked us if we had a reservation and tried to squeeze us in when we said no.\n\nAside from that, this place was great! I thought it was really cool how there menu changes dependent on what they have and at the chef's discretion. The food was awesome by the way. We all felt that if we were at an Italian restaurant then we had to test their pasta dishes. All around we had a vegetarian, a seafood, and a gnocchi dish at our table, along with a bruschetta for an appetizer. I felt that the bruschetta could have used some sort of balsamic to help balance the olive oil used and keep the palate cleaned for the next dish. I also felt that the calamari in my seafood linguine dish was a little tough and lacking in flavor, although the mussels were wonderful and bursting with flavor. I think that the dish I had to tip my hat off too was the green gnocchi with mushrooms and parmesan flakes. My goodness! I have never had gnocchi like there's! They truly were like pillows; literally falling apart once you pushed them against the roof of your mouth. I'm quite picky of mushrooms as well and ended up being quite fond of them this time around, sliced to perfect thickness and hugging the pasta and providing a wonderful transition of consistency when you bite down.\n\nOverall, Bella Trattoria is a small, quiet place perfect for a date or just to sit down and talk... and enjoy the food of course.", "author": "Ian B."}

I prefer unpeeled eggplant because there is more flavor and it offers another texture to get through.\n\nService was just terrific--I felt like family.  What a nice group of people that help to run this restaurant.  What a relief to not have to experience the sometimes jaded and dismissive service that SF has become used to.  I can't wait to come back and practice my Italian again.\n\nAnother dish that I'll always order ( if I see it on a menu) is any pasta dish served with a pork ragu.\n\nTheir homemade papperdelle covered in pork ragu made me very happy.

Very very good.\n\nThe only reason this won't get 5 stars is simple. I don't do it often but that night I ordered a Diet Coke. Sometimes I just crave the fizz.

Well not sure I would call what transpired service. We were so happy to be celebrating the beginning of our new college life in NorCal but never expected to be dismissed at every turn. Let's start w the bread which they told us over the course of 30 min was in the oven. At a minimum we expected it to be warm. Nope, ours was pulled out of the .99 store bag and bypassed the oven entirely. Really? My friend and I are vegetarian so we ordered the eggplant veggie burgers. By this point all of us were starving. When our food came out oh I don't know like 45 min later, someone had sliced up some eggplant and each of the listed ingredients and slapped them on the cold .99 store dinner rolls and called that lunch. Our other friend got what looked like the lasagna from the sample menu and was charged $20. And not only were we dismissed and overlooked the entire time, we couldn't get anyone's attention if we'd stood on the table. Oh and is it a San Francisco thing to have your waitress walk out while you're mid-wait wo saying a word other than SEE YA! She was just miserable. I will say that they did take off the 2 farm to table burgers that missed the table part entirely. I'm hoping that we weren't dismissed for being young or diverse. Bc that doesn't feel right. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. This brought them up from zero to 1-Star. I'm very disappointed in your lack of customer service and total disregard for our desire to have chosen you for a special celebratory experience. Shame on you. Not ok on any level. And I'll leave it at that. I don't like writing negative reviews but everything about this experience was unacceptable.", "author": "Clara L."}

I have to say this is one of my favorite Italian places in the city. We had their polenta and antipasto Della Casa. The cheese and vegetables on the antipasto were perfectly fit. The hubby ate the cold cuts they were pretty decent. \n\nFor our main course we had the spinach gnocchi. I have to say this is the first place where the gnocchi is a perfect size and it's light. That never happens! The mushroom sauce was lightly drizzled though the gnocchi. \n\nParking can a little rough in the Clement/Geary area, but easily this is a little gem to keep coming back to.

Fortunately, the restaurant had available tables the day of and I conveniently made reservations via Open Table. \n\nWhat better way to keep a HANGRY (a term used to describe one who is angry and hungry) customer happy by giving complimentary appetizers. These \"on the house\" antipasto vary each time! On my first visit, my BF and I received bruschetta and on my most recent visit, they were croquettes. Both of which were delicious and satisfied the hunger pains. \n\nNow on to the main dishes--Gnocchi, Squid Ink Pasta, and Cioppino. The star of the show are the home made noodles. OH YES! Bella Trattoria offers some tasty carb strings. L O V E!\n\nNow on to the good stuff-- Customer Service. In general, each time i dine in at restaurants this could be a \"make it or break it\" type of deal. You can see where I am going with this. It's story time! My party of 4 each ordered a pasta dish, but only 3 were served to us. As we patiently waited and thought the order just took longer than expected we didn't flag down our server until 15 minutes later. At that point, it just seemed like they forgot to place our order or our order was given away to another table. With that being said, I talked to the server and inquired about the last pasta dish. He checked the kitchen and investigated. Within one minute, he came back with the pasta dish and was SOOO apologetic. There was miscommunication in the kitchen with the server and the chef. The dish was made, but it was just sitting on the counter top ready to be picked up.\n\nLast but not least, dessert. To our surprise, the server presented us a complimentary dessert to compensate for the delay of our order. It was such a sweet gesture (pun intended) and showed extraordinary service! The Panna Cotta was deliciously amazing and I highly recommend ordering this! It is a creamy pudding with strawberries and blackberries! Super light and not too sweet which makes this a great dessert to end a fantastic meal at Bella Trattoria!", "author": "Briana H."}

We walked into the restaurant to an empty hostess stand and waited awkwardly by the door for a few minutes before the busboy noticed us and seated us in the corner by the door after asking if we had a reservation (the restaurant was half empty it really didn't seem too hard to seat us quickly). We sit down and take in the ambiance, cute place and cool lighting, but got bored after almost 10 minutes of sitting there secluded from the rest of the people in the restaurant without menu's in front of us to browse at. I still couldn't get the attention of a waiter so the busboy, again, brought us menu's and we sat there for another 10 minutes before deciding to walk out and go down the street to the neighboring Italian restaurant Mescolanza and were immediately greeted and treated with the polar opposite level of service.", "author": "Melanie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-10", "description": "Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and thoroughly enjoyed it. We arrived about half an hour early for our reservation, so they led us to the bar and helped us choose a bottle of wine to share while we waited. As soon as we sat down, I knew it would be good, because the staff are actually Italian. And Italians don't mess around when it comes to their cuisine.\n\nWhen we got to our table, they brought out some yummy house-made bread (great texture, would have been even better if it had been warm, but still very good) with a SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS dip of oil with chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Multiple people in our group (myself included) remarked that we're usually not huge fans of sun-dried tomatoes, but this dip was the bomb. We got like 3 or 4 plates of it, and could have happily eaten more! Honestly, if that was all I had eaten, I still would have given this place 5 stars. I will dream about that oil.\n\nThe whole menu looked so delicious that we had a really tough time deciding what to order. We ended up sharing some appetizers:\n\n1) BURRATA: I pretty much always order this when I see it on a menu, and theirs was particularly creamy and delicious.\n\n2) BONE MARROW: two people in our group are huge bone marrow fans who usually get judged for their habits of cracking open bones like cavemen to suck out the delicious interior, so they felt vindicated to see it on such a classy menu, and obviously we ordered it. They gave us a pretty generous portion, served in the bone with some crostini and a parsley salad on the side. It was great!\n\n3) POLENTA: Not much to say here, other than it was very yummy!\n\nWe each ordered our own main dishes, but I tried some of all of them, including:\n\n 1) SORRENTINA GNOCCI: This is what I ordered. It was wonderful. I love gnocchi, and I keep hearing that this place has some of the best gnocchi in the city, so I had to try it, and I gotta say, I'd believe that superlative! It melted in my mouth. \n\n2) RAGU SPECIAL: I can't remember the name of the pasta, but I think it was either tagliatelle or pappardelle. The sauce wasn't as good as I had hoped (a bit on the salty side) but overall pretty good.\n\n3) FRUTT' 'E MAR: Very good! I only tried the pasta itself and the calamari in the bites I took (so I can't judge the shrimp or mussels), but both were great. You could definitely taste a hint of squid in the squid-ink pasta. The sauce was also very good.\n\nNext time I want to get the gnocchi verdi!\n\nFor dessert we shared the following:\n\n1) VANILLA AFFOGATO: So. Good. If you like coffee ice cream, get this. It's like what coffee ice cream dreams of being.\n\n2) PANNA COTTA: I loved the balsamic glaze. It added just a touch of tartness to the smooth and creamy dish.\n\n3) SPUMONI: Wonderful. Ice cream at its classiest.\n\nNot that many places do house-made pasta around here, and certainly not with the variety of this menu.

We chose a Barbera, a bright tangy red wine that was just delicious. The wait staff were responsive and upon request furnished interesting background information on the wine and good suggestions. My traditional complaint about Bella is that the chairs are not very comfortable, but the chairs have been replaced with passably comfortable chairs, and the velvet curtain around the doorway keeps out most of the cool night air (but could be doubled for more insulation). Last night we were extra lucky -- when we arrived at 9 pm the cozy booth was available in the front.\nFabulous. You won't be disappointed with this restaurant.

The veal cutlet was extremely good as well. \n\nWe didn't try the wines as we brought our own bottle but the list looked great. Corkage: $20/bottle with a two bottle maximum. The dessert was great as well! I got the vanilla gelato and wanted more. \n\nThe service was also great. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the foods being offered. We never had to ask for anything, they were all very on top of it. \n\nAll in all, we're really glad we gave this spot a try and we plan on going back very soon. One of the best Italian restaurants in the city! And it's even better that you don't have to be in the heart of the city to find it.", "author": "Kendra W."}

Our reservation was made through OpenTable and we were seated right when we arrived. \n\nTo start, we had their fluffy bread, bruschetta, and polenta. We were also served a plate of garbanzo beans with some light seasoning and sauce, which was refreshing. \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the gnocchi and hangar steak. Everything was great and we ended up leaving about a third of our main dishes because we were so full. Unfortunately, when we requested our food to be boxed up, the leftovers were accidentally tossed out in the kitchen. Our server was nice enough to offer us a fresh order of gnocchi to go, but now I am left yearning for that amazing steak. I'm no gnocchi expert, but it just seemed too soft - even with the sausage - to the point where I couldn't tell the difference between the mozzarella and gnocchi since they were so similar in texture. \n\nFor dessert, we had the panna cotta and afogato, which were both excellent. The birthday celeb also got complimentary panna cotta, which was nice. \n\nBella is a very cute, intimate place, though I wouldn't quite call it romantic. It is a small restaurant, so be sure to make those reservations. Something I do want to mention though is that the bench seating along the wall was a bit uncomfortable. The seat of the bench wasn't wide enough and I felt like I couldn't sit back comfortably.\n\nIn general, I enjoyed my first visit to Bella, and will definitely be coming back for that steak. I want to give their squid ink risotto when it's available as well.", "author": "Camille B."}

We were there early evening and were treated like old friends by the entire staff. We were given the menu and noticed there were no bone marrow for appetizers, which we were looking forward to having. When we asked about it, our waiter went to the kitchen and came back and said they would fix them for us! OMG, they were so good and so rich! My hubby had the special of lasagne, which is something of his specialty whenever he makes it at home and it was chock full of meat and so delicious! Equal to my husband's version. I ordered the Gnocchi verde with spinach gnocchi and a gorgonzola cremini mushroom sauce. Oh dear god, it was so rich, and the gnocchi melted on your tongue,not some chewy, tough gnocchi you usually get at lesser Italian restaurants. They really should charge the same and make it an appetizer. Brought half of it home.We asked for a wine suggestion and the Barbera our waiter chose was perfect.\nThe panna cotta they serve complimentary at the end of the meal is quite delicious as well.

The pasta here is fresh and slightly on the thin side so it does not have the chewiness (or gumminess) one might get at other restaurants.\n\nService here is excellent.

Come Saturday, my friend and I decided on having a dinner catch up here.  Making reservations was easy on Opentable.\n\nThe place is on the smaller side and seems like a local favorite, so reservations are recommended.  Her and I ended up getting a cute booth table by the door which allowed us to sit side by side..and more room for our handbags, score!  \n\nThe menu has a lot of attractive items, so it was a hard choice, but we shared: the bone marrow, carbonara and the squid ink amatricana pasta. The bone marrow was served with a parsley and caper salad with toasted crostinis.  This was my least favorite dish as it tasted flat.  It needed lots of garlic or more seasoning of some other sort.  My pick the carbonara was so good, even with just three ingredients (no cream no butter).  Served perfectly al dente and the pancetta was not overly salty at all like a lot of restaurants serve it.  I am not a squid person, but decided to give the black squid ink pasta a try, and I really enjoyed it.  It was a chunky spicy tomato sauce with the spicy n'duja sausage ground up in the sauce.  The pasta had a a toothsome bite to it and didn't taste \"seafoody\" at all which I was scared of.  I would definitely get this again.  And an added bonus, we didn't leave with black on our teeth!  All dishes were under $20.  \n\nService got better after we decided on what we wanted, and it partially could have done with us chatting to each other so much and them wanting to turn the table over.  I was honestly surprised at this cute place!  It's perfect for date night or friend date night.

But then I came here...and Bella has made me excited for good Italian food again! I've forgotten how good it can be.\n\nCame here on a double date last night after watching Book of Mormon in the city. (No, it's not close to the theater, sorry!) My boyfriend's friends recommended this place--one of their absolute favorites. And I can totally see why! Very romantic ambiance (a beautiful floor to ceiling painting of a night in Italy by the water) and dim-ish lighting with clear hanging lightbulbs. The restaurant is not big and not a looker from the outside, but the inside is cozy and cute! Reservations recommended. There were groups and couples and I can see how you might be pressed for space if u were a couple seated between other groups or couples, but the four of us got a table separate from everyone else. \n\nUnlimited bread and sundried tomato sauce (different from the usual sauces)! The bread is soft and goes great with the sauce, but I do wish it were a little warmed up. We started with appetizers: polentun a bella, guazetto, and salumi. \n\nThe polenta was baked polenta ($9.50) with gorgonzola and cremini mushrooms..be careful that it's really hot when it comes out! A good hearty appetizer that can hit the spot. But I'd say you'd have to like polenta. I'm not the BIGGEST fan of polenta because I tend to get sick of the texture or flavor or something after too much, but this was made well and I think the fact that there were mushrooms made it that much better. I may not order this again but try it!\n\nGuazetto ($16) was a yummy tomato bisque with zucchini, mussels, clams, calamari, and ours also had a fried tilapia on top..super DELISH with the sauce! I lovedddd this. And the bread does well in soaking up the soup. Would totally order this again!! Salami was okay but honestly I'm not good at critiquing cured meats so I'm gonna defer on that. I personally wouldn't order it on my own, but our friends say they always order it. \n\nI think our friends frequent so much that the owners know them and they sent over complimentary bruschetta! Quite yummy, lots of fresh basil and tomatoes soaked in vinegar topped with fresh mozzarella slices..and more sundried tomatoes. I think they really like sundried tomatoes here...haha\n\nFor Entrees, I got the butternut squash ravioli ($16) and my bf got the linguine with tiger prawns ($19). Our friends ordered sorrentino (gnocchi with sausage and mozzarella) and the lasagna. I loveddd the butter nut squash ravioli! It's kind of more sweet though...tastes like Thanksgiving candied yams wrapped in the dough and soaked in an olive oil, topped with browned butter fried sage and sundried tomatoes. The flavors form a real good mouthgasm. But...be warned, this only comes with 6 pieces. I wouldn't order this as your only entree. Luckily I was already really stuffed from all of our appetizers, that even finishing 6 raviolis was difficult for me...\n\nThe gnocchi were little pillows of goodness and the lasagna was not your typical doused in tomato sauce lasagna. The meat was clearly soaked in some kind of tomato essence though and I really liked the hearty flavors that didn't feel too rich at the same time. Nicely done! My bf was happy with his linguine with multiple giant shrimps. I thought it was decent, but honestly I think the only I didn't like from the night was his saffron bechamel sauce that seemed to have too much shrimpy flavors to it. Aside from that though, everything else was amazing!\n\nWe shared a panna cotta for dessert--fluffy and light yet rich and creamy. Not sure how THAT happens, but it was delicious. Even my super stuffed tummy had to make space for a few bites. It's not a big portion at $8, I have to say...but I think it was just right for the 4 of us. Oh, that and they also gave us complimentary spumoni. I'm not a huge spumoni fan, but I'll take free stuff! :P It was good, but I'd order the panna cotta over spumoni any day :D \n\nWonderful service and dining experience; great ambiance; delicious food!

We made reservations at 7:30 on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. I'm sure we may have received special treatment since they're regulars, but every staff member had a warm smile and a charming personality. They made excellent recommendations on dishes and wine pairings, water glasses were promptly filled, and the bread basket was never empty... a feat, considering it was served with that amazing olive oil and sun dried tomato dipping sauce. \n\nAs we were waiting on our permanently-late cousin Kelly, we started the meal with drinks and appetizers. I had a very generous pour of the house red, which was excellent. The bruschetta was one of the best I've ever had; it slightly edges out Postino in Phoenix, which is well known for bruschetta and wine. A well marinated medley of fresh tomatoes and basil sits atop perfectly toasted bread, followed by a thick slice of fresh mozzarella, which is then crowned by a drizzle of olive oil, a touch of sun dried tomatoes, and whole green olives. He also brought out a complimentary appetizer of their carpaccio: paper-thin slices of fresh raw (citrus \"cooked\") venison with a tasty horseradish/mustard drizzle, topped with baby arugula and shaved pecorino. I didn't even see this dish on the menu, but I would order it again in a heartbeat. \n\nI had the highly recommended carbonara originale - \"3 ingredients: pancetta, pecorino, egg - no cream, no butter.\" The fettuccini, which is made in-house daily, was perfectly al dente and topped with a good helping of cubed pancetta. I'm baffled as to the lack of cream or butter in the sauce; it was rich and creamy, with a pleasant sharpness from the pecorino romano. The serving size was more than generous, and the server graciously boxed up my leftovers to enjoy at home. I did catch red-handed Felicia licking her spoon; she did look guilty about it, though the sauce is so good that I didn't give her too much crap for it :)\n\nWe were all too stuffed to order dessert, but couldn't resist when our server brought out little sampler plates for our party. They came with a sizeable portion of delicious tiramisu (almost as good as Stella pastry), an above average spumoni, and a silky smooth panna cotta with fresh strawberries and blueberries. \n\nBottom line: despite all the well known Italian restaurants in North Beach, this is my new go-to place for Italian cuisine.

We were sitting at the bar so perhaps that explained the service - everyone was nice however our water was not refilled at all despite both glasses being empty, and we had to always flag them down for anything.\n\nThat being said, I would definitely return for the bruschetta and carbonara! And probably plan ahead to make a reservation for Fri/Sat nights as they seem to be pretty booked, so we can get a table with hopefully better service than at the bar.\n\nPS portions are a bit on the small side so plan accordingly!", "author": "Steph A."}

However, the food was something I had expected.  The specials were all very unique and gourmet, but I for some reason did not feel that extra kick to boost this restaurant to a 4/5 business.  \n\nFor the starters, the bread didn't come with the standard balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It came with a sun-dried tomato spread that I was hesitant to try at first, but then devoured by the end of dinner.  The bread was good, but really cold for some reason.  \n\nI ordered the butternut squash ravioli but my goodness, was the portion tiny!  I think all Italian restaurants do that with ravioli... why!?  The butternut squash was very strong, and the brown sugar topping the ravioli was so unique in taste.  I had just finished hiking north of SF, and I was ravenous by the time dinner came.  However, the portion was so tiny!  A baby could have eaten my plate (pics on yelp). Thankfully, my friend ordered the garlic pasta (unsure of the name), and I got to try some of her pasta, which was amazing!  It smelled amazing and tasted amazing.  The portion was more sufficient.\n\nSome improvements that could be made: fair portion sizes!  The pastas were great, but the ravioli was highly lacking.  The bread could also be warm!  It is REALLY cold in SF, and some warm bread would make the tummy happy. \n\nOverall, a good restaurant to go to on a date or catching up with old friends.  Not one to go to after doing some intense hiking or physically enduring event!  Note to self.\n\nPro-tip: The waiters are really nice!  Turns out one of them went to SCU for a semester!

For my pasta I ordered the 3 ingredient carbonara... It was honestly the most delicious plate I've ever had. The panna cotta was also great, it was the perfect way to end such a satisfying meal. I cannot wait to return and indulge again! Must try.", "author": "Reina C."}

I'm a foodie and have gone to many restaurants through out the city and Bella Trattoria is hands down the most delicious I have been to! Not to mention the service there is unlike any place I've been before. They truly care about your experience and make sure to go above and beyond. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went last Friday around 8:30 (make sure to make a reservation!). The ambiance was so romantic and felt like I entered a small restaurant in Italy. I loved the decor! So my style - unique lighting, small but cozy.\n\nWe started with a Caesar salad... My boyfriend doesn't even like Caesar salad and he ended up eating half!!! The shaved parmesan literally melted in your mouth. Then we had the bruschetta.... A MUST get to start. Again, melted in your mouth.\n\nFor our entrees, I got gnocchi with the Gorgonzola .... You guessed it. Melted in my mouth! I've had my fair share of gnocchi growing up in a big Italian fam and this plate literally blew any gnocchi I've ever had out of the water. FULL of flavor. I didn't even have any leftovers I ate it all :(\n\nBeing so far from the city in the Outer Richmond, it's a hike to get to restaurant. Luckily, this place is right around the corner :) I'll be sure to be back to visit and David is an amazing owner! Make sure to say hi, he'll make you feel right at home!\n\nThanks Bella Trattoria staff! One of the best dates we have been on!!!", "author": "Alesia V."}

I ordered the Frutti De Mar with the Squid ink pasta. Definitely in my top 2! The squid ink pasta is officially my favorite type of pasta after having it at Bella Trattoria!

I do love the special treatment of going with a regular - we got a special app, and a special dessert.\n\nWe split the gorgonzola gnocchi to share for he table and the carpaccio.

Huge too.\n\nSomeone else ordered the carbonara - one of the best I've had outside of Italy, and my bf got the bolognese with fresh noodles. My faves were the cutlet and the carbonara for sure.\n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert but they brought out a little marsacpone cream thing for dessert, even though I was stuffed it was amazing.\n\nMy bf never lets me be a \"regular\" anywhere since there are so many places I want to eat.

We're not familiar with the area so I called, made a reservation for 8pm..we  arrived after 730, was told to wait at the bar and then they send up to the back area to another bar and waited again which was fine. After we got seated we got a menu and never saw anyone again for at least 20mins, we were talking so we didn't noticed at first. A male waiter or maybe manager  (not sure what he was since he was walking outside a lot and texting) came by and took out drinks..waited another 15mins, we ordered our food and that's the last time we saw anyone for 45mins! Literally NO one came back to see how we were doing or anything. I did notice a lot of usuals and they got better service then us, I never leave bad reviews but I was very very upset! Suppose to a nice anniversary dinner and ended up being very frustrating evening..I felt bad for the waitress who ended up taking care of our table and seemed to be doing all the work, she ended up apologizing for all the trouble and gave us free dessert.. who wants free dessert when your that upset? 2 hour dinner (not by choice) and only checked on us 3 times is very upsetting..this is would be good for someone who knows the manger or else your screwed..", "author": "Amanda L."}

The tomatoes are so fresh, and the juices soak in to the bread perfectly.

Yes, it's called Bella Trattoria, but there's something about the excellent service that makes me want to sing Bella Notte, because you can really tell they're all about making your night special.\n\nFresh, handmade pasta. The boyfriend is half-Italian and is terribly proud of it (mainly from a food aspect), and has given his thumbs up for this place. We had ordered salmon from the carpaccio menu. I'm still new to the raw fish/meat game, but was quickly turned when this dish arrived. So, so good. So worth it. They also let us try a little sample of their bruschetta, which was equally delicious. My tastebuds didn't stand a chance.\n\nAnd then the entrees happened. Squid ink arrabbiata spaghetti is surprisingly delicious. Not that I know what squid ink actually tastes like. Not that it will matter because the lights are dimmed for that perfect ambiance. And I ordered a chicken bake with penne pasta. The boyfriend took a bite of that chicken, which was some of the most succulent chicken I've ever had, and said that this chicken was worth mentioning for people visiting from out of town.\n\nDessert-wise, we ordered a tiramisu despite being overly stuffed. To our surprise, they also served us their panna cotta on the house. After learning that their beautiful tiramisu was mainly made with custardy egg, which I couldn't have, I resigned myself to the panna cotta...which was so good I nearly cried. I've never had panna cotta before this, I don't think. And I'll certainly be ordering it again.\n\nThere was a bit of confusion as we had an online gift card that we hadn't printed (on the gift card it said we didn't need to print it, but then the restaurant did, so...not having a printer, the printing didn't happen). Despite that, the manager went out of his way to figure out what he could do for us. I generally don't like pushing for things like this, so I didn't, but he was kind and even offered to let us print it from their office via WiFi. Not to worry, sir. I'm sorry we had accidentally been \"those people\". We'll definitely be back, with or without a gift card. I need that panna cotta.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I got the carbonara, which was DELICIOUS (I would recommend... very simple, 3 ingredients, but the flavor was so amazing). This is a pricier restaurant were dishes are $17-25/plate before tax + tip, so I would consider this a more high-end, date night/special occasion place. With one entree and one sangria, my bill was almost $40 with tax + tip for myself alone. However, every single person at the table raved about their food, and since we had all gotten different items, I would agree that the price is worth the quality of food. \n\nMy only complaints are the small waiting space, which hey, it is SF right? Small spaces. And that the food took a long time to order.

The young Italian waiter was easy going and offered us tastings of 3 of his red wines. Lunch is very much an abbreviated menu with mostly soup, salads and pastas. There is one meat  and one fish dish only. None of those great sound veal dishes and the like that you'll find on the dinner menu. We all had a glass of wine with a complimentary  antipasti plate small but enough to keep us going till the food arrived 20 minutes later. Three dishes 1-  daily fish was trout with spinach, de-boned , easy to eat and clean, great for lean meal. 2- Seafood clams, squid, mussels, spaghetti simple, fresh ingredients, cooked just right 3- the hands down winner was the gnocchi in tomato sausage sauce, absolutely silky smooth just melted in your mouth. That alone is worth the visit and the 5 stars.\nDessert was panacotta ringed with berries also excellent as was the spumoni gelato.

First off, we were enjoying the bread and then one of the servers comes and takes away the plates we were eating the bread off of to make way for the entrees that he said were coming shortly but arrived 15 minutes later.  He failed to ask if we would like to keep the plates and retrieved them at lightening speed.  Then our entrees arrived and all was well until dessert.  We were celebrating a birthday and ordered a Panna Cotta.  They added a candle and sang happy birthday.  Then, we noticed the two tables surrounding us declined dessert and both received COMPLIMENTARY Panna Cottas while we were charged for ours! While I don't at all expect desserts to be complimentary for birthdays, this circumstance was completely ludicrous.  Why would you comp desserts for people who decline it but not for a table celebrating a birthday?  Even if we weren't celebrating anything, it is awfully unprofessional to openly give complimentary items to select tables in front of others who don't receive it. They sure know how to leave a horrible impression on their customers with such simple thoughtless acts.

Went perfect with the wine. Great way to start any meal.\n\nThen comes the why, why, why moment, they bring bread and a dipping sauce to the table, really bad bread, i could care less about a dipping sauce. Being Italian, bread is a religion, need a nice hard crust, crumbs, big holes in the middle, substantial. This was like white bread, soft, uninspiring crust, etc.\n\nNext up was our entrees, I like simple Italian food, real Italian food. I got a linguini plate with sausage, truffle butter/oil, and bread crumbs, it was great, just perfect. Across the table the lady had the papardelle with a pork ragu, sounds simple enough, but when something is made perfect, it is a wonderful thing. OUTSTANDING ENTREES\n\nDesert, we shared a pana cotta with a balsamic glaze and fresh fruit, man was that good, a perfect way to end a meal.

Being in a neighborhood where no one would expect to find a good Italian restaurant certainly helps. But free corkage if you bring your own bottle of wine on a Monday through Wednesday night? I know the Inner Richmond is a venture for some, but come on people... where ya gonna find a place like that in North Beach, huh?\n\nI've been here a handful of times and can vouch for the consistently good food and service. The staff are friendly and encourage slow-paced, leisurely dining. The menu seems very traditionally Italian (with the numerous course thing going on) and incorporates quality local ingredients. Last time I tried the San Marzano tomato soup (*brings fingers of right hand together and smooches them up, all Italian-like*) and the gluten free penne in a sausage cream sauce. The ravioli and gnocchi have also been delicious, and one day I have promised myself to try the risotto.\n\nFrom what I can recall, the interior of the place has undergone some changes over the years. It used to be a little kitschier, but more recently they've decided to play up a classier, trendier vibe--and the sexy ambiance works for sure! Finally, I'd say the prices are pretty reasonable for a nice Italian restaurant. Really, what more could you ask for?\n\nI'm still a bit surprised whenever I come here and there aren't more customers. Though I'd love to see this place blow up since they do such a great job, I suppose it's sort of nice to avoid the crowd.

I don't expect a restaurant to make substitutions for me...I go to have the experience they've worked hard to present to the world. Otherwise, it's a bit like buying a book and getting angry that the author won't edit it for you. \n\nCame here by accident as we were staying in a neighborhood airbnb location. It was on a weekend, even though we didn't have reservations, luckily it was a bit early in the evening and they were able to fit us in. The restaurant has that typically San Francisco feel, longer and a bit narrow with a banquet on one side and tables in the rest. With dark walls, a lovely mural and a small bar in the back, it's the perfect place for either a romantic dinner or a family night (assuming your kids are well behaved). Our waitress seemed italian and was well trained. \n\nAt most restaurants we usually just place our dinner orders and eat...but for some reason, we ended up slowly working our way through the menu starting with their aperitif cocktails - refreshing and a great way to start an evening. We then ordered the Antipasto plate which comes with veggies, meat, cheese and olives. Since then we've tried the warm Spinach salad (I'm not wild about spinach...but this was very tasty) and the meatballs which also were good. \n\nFor dinner I had to laugh at the \"La Vera Carbonara\" which proudly states \"no cream, no butter\" because I completely agree - Carbonara is not alfredo with bacon! The \"cream\" quality is supposed to come from cooking the raw egg with the warmth of the cooked pasta just as it comes out of the pot! So, I had to order it and it tasted great - strong comfort food. They don't make their own pasta, but they do have a place that makes it for them - it has a light, delicate quality to it. That first night my husband tried the Frutt E Mar, which is the squid ink spaghetti - for a foodie, I'm a bit of a wimp - but it was soooo good - tasted like the sea, fresh and a bit salty. We've since tried the Gnocchi and the Arribbiata, which were both very good. I suppose if we were doing a true italian dinner we would have then had a full Piatto Principale - but the pasta is always so good, we have never tried them. \n\nWe've gone back several times and had a lovely time each evening. I recommend reservations.", "author": "A M."}

We also ordered the mixed olives and I found them mushy. \nFor entrees my mom had the pork osso bucco special that she said was tender & delicious. My three year old had rigatoni with sausage & peas. She devoured it!  I had the clam dish with their gluten-free pasta. The clams & calamari were sweet & tender with a nice garlicky sauce and the pasta was cooked pretty well too. My only complaint is that the GF pasta was rotini (corkscrew) and not the best choice for the dish. If I'd known I'd likely have chosen something different. \nFor dessert we shared the gelato. The taste was good, but there were a few icy bits.   \nI'll give this place another try. The food pretty good and I think they have potential.", "author": "Heather S."}

There were 2 tables left but I'm assuming they were for reservations. So we made reservations on a weekday but to our avail, there were lots of empty tables so we probably didn't even need a reservation. \n\nThe restaurant is really small and cozy. With dim lighting and mini candles on your table.\n\nThey give you free bread with Olive oil and sun dried tomatoes dipping sauce. Pass on this because the bread was cold. It wasn't good. \n\nOnce we got seated we ordered some appetizers and our main pasta dish:\n-bruschetta was just okay. It looked pretty but it was lacking the special something. Nothing amazing. All you taste was tomatoes and Olive oil. Couldn't taste the cheese on this. \n-romance lettuce salad with anchovy lemon dressing. This tasted like a Caesar salad. Can't taste the anchovy or the lemon. All I tasted was Olive oil again.\n-bone marrow. This was hyped up so we got it. This is extremely oily as bone marrow already has oil in it but they put extra oil on top to cook this. Oil was oozing everywhere. Good but the excess oil disgusted me.\n\nI had the smoke salmon with caviar. Small portion sized. Extremely rich and creamy and good but I just wish it had a bigger portion. \n\nMy partner had the linguini with Manila clams and other seafood. Pasta was okay but the sauce was nonexistent. All you can taste again was the Olive oil in it. The portion size for this one was huge though.\n\nAt the end we had a complimentary panna cotta. We never had it but will definitely order one next time. This was so good! Absolutely amazing. It was rich and creamy and not too sweet but it hits the spot. Definitely my favorite and will be back for this. \n\nOverall, this place is a little pricey and too much oil used in their dishes. Will be back to try other items. Will update next time.", "author": "Jeanne Z."}

We arrived on-time, however, our table was not ready so we were advised we could go to the Buckshot for a drink until our table was ready around 9:30 PM by the friendly hostess from Italy.\n\nAfter sitting down --- our first course of the Risotto Cakes were served nearly immediately and were quite delicious.  Next we had the choice of our first course from our server David, who was on point --- which included appetizers, salads, or soup. We chose the Bone Marrow, Butter Nut Squash Ravioli and Caesar Salad to start with --- all three were prepared exceptionally.\n\nNext, for our entrees we got two (2) orders of the Osso Bucco along with the Veal Scallopini. Each entree had an extremely generous portion size --- with plenty to bring home. Followed by a dessert of the Marazpan and Spumoni Gelato which were served just right.\n\nOverall for the three dinners plus a bottle of Vino and one cocktail our bill was $290 plus tip or $350 overall which I thought was an excellent value. The evening even included free sparkling wine plus party favors for a 2014 New Years Countdown.", "author": "Brian D."}

The only bad thing about it is that if you're a party of 2, you can expect to be packed in a bit with other guests.  Originally we had a table that felt like it was basically floating in the center of the restaurant by itself, but we had them relocate us to a booth that was slightly less awkward.  \n\nThe food was great.  I had the Carbonara with a salad of fresh greens.  Both were delicious.  My date had the same salad, but with the yam dish.  She seemed like she enjoyed hers equally well.  They brought us some samples of this and that throughout the night.  When we didn't order dessert, they brought us some anyways (no charge).  This was probably better, since it was a smaller portion that we shared, versus ordering a legitimate-sized dessert, which probably would have been too much.  \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is excellent.  The waitstaff are all extremely nice and attentive.  It's a good place to have a conversation: cozy, and not too loud.  All in all, an enjoyable experience at the restaurant.\n\nOn another note, however, parking in the area is terrible.  Also of note, the service definitely IS pretty slow, but I believe that's by design.  It's a traditional Italian restaurant where your dinner isn't meant to be completed in 20 minutes.  They'll drag out the courses, and leave you time to talk and enjoy your company after your meal is complete.  This is not a bad thing by any means, but it's important to take note of going in, in case you have another engagement to attend following dinner.", "author": "Brian B."}

Although it is a small place and we were a party of 12, the service was pretty good and prompt. Not too loud so you can actually have a decent convo with friends. \n\nFirst off the complimentary bread here is to die for.  Don't get me wrong, it's not no fancy bread but rather the simple French baguette bread.  But wow it was so fresh and soft and went perfectly with the sun dried tomatoes & olive oil spread.  I swear I ate a whole loaf and was 80% full by the time we received our entrees.  Don't come here if you are on a low carb diet. \n\nWe started off with the bruschetta, polenta, bone marrow and Caesar salad.  Bruschetta was yummy..a must get. The bone marrow and Caesar were both OK.  Bone Marrow was a good portion but on the salty side and did not care for the side greens that it came with.  Caesar salad had too much cheese and dressing. If modified, it would have been yummy. Skip the polenta...didn't like the texture and for some reason it had a slight gamey taste. \n\nFor the entree I had the Frutt E Mar which is the squid ink spaghetti with mixed seafood-shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops. Not very saucy but rather a seafood broth with tomatoes. After the first bite I was a bit disappointed as I was expecting a strong fresh & sweet seafood taste.  But instead it was very light but still sweet and actually tasted better and better after each bite especially with the broth. Wish it came with more broth. But I very much enjoyed this dish. Something different. :) I would def come back for more carbs action.", "author": "Cathy M."}

However, when you're a big girl and you need to squeeze between two tables, it sucks when you nearly flatten someone's leftovers with your big ass. I don't blame the hostess, though. She didn't seem to want to seat me where I was -- she commented that this is not the favorite table she wanted to place me.\n\nThe complimentary bread they plunk down is barely even passable for an Italian restaurant that makes their pasta homemade. Considering they are in San Francisco, a city of glorious food options and amazing bakeries, I would expect that a place that has a high price on their pastas would serve a bread of better character, wherever they source it from.\n\nThe gnocchi itself seemed too salty in addition to the fact that there was a huge amount of cheese on it that had its own salty pungency. Now, I love cheese. I don't mind a lot of cheese, but if I'm visiting a quality restaurant, I don't want them to hide their work behind too much cheese. The mushrooms in my dish also seemed over-seasoned enough to help overpower the dish with, again, too much. I did use the table bread to mop up some of the sauce, but the sauce was still way exceedingly strong. \n\nThe gnocchi I ordered seemed to need something else, texture-wise, to balance out the soft pillows, and the answer was not mushrooms. There needed to be something to add more bite and chew.\n\nThe tiramisu is all right, but I've had better at lesser quality restaurants.\n\nNice Points:\nThe cocktails are lovely. \nThey keep your water filled. \nThey always check up on you.\nThey don't rush you out once they've closed.", "author": "Cate T."}

In San Francisco you can do a lot better for a nice Italian meal and for the price.  First off, the menu is not the most user-friendly one to navigate and has rather small print for such a dark room.  We had to use the flashlight on our iPhones to see what's on the menu.  Had a hard time finding something that looked good to us.  I chose a chicken pasta and my wife chose a seafood dish.  Our son ordered a salad and shared it and that was not bad.  But all of us had the same complaint about the main entrees, that everything was too salty.  My wife and I got very little substance (chicken or seafood) to our meals, and ended up with mostly tasteless noodles that we didn't bother finishing nor did we have any desire to take home.  For what we got, I thought everything was a bit overpriced and the quality lacking.  The one nice touch is that after passing up on dessert, the waiter did bring a little dessert to share along with the check.  That was the high point of the meal.

It was already 4:30PM and we were still contemplating on what were \"feeling\" for. After  moments of silence and arguing back and forth of how we weren't craving this or that, I suggested why not try Bella Trattoria -- this restaurant has been an eyeful for over a decade now [because I live VERY close by] and since I never dined here, why not?\n\nI made reservations for 8PM and considering it was in less than 3 hours later, I was pretty skeptical. We walked in at 7:30PM (to be on the safe side) and saw that all the tables were taken. However, one of the waiters confirmed my reservation and by 7:55PM sharp, we were seated. \n\nAppetizer -- \n\nComplimentary [Italian?] bread with sun dried tomatoes and olive oil: \n- very fresh, soft, and warm slices of bread.

It's not too expensive and is not a formal restaurant at all. It was a little nippy however since the window above the entrance was open but we didn't mind too much.

Bruschetta is a must, so fresh and flavorful! \n\nWe passed on the dessert menu, we were so full, but the server gave us a complimentary Panna cotta dessert topped with fresh fruits.. he said it was for the \"baby\" haha!! Nevertheless we finished it :) \n\nGreat Italian restaurant here in the Richmond!", "author": "J M."}

I went with the carbonara, my girlfriend the gnocchi.  Paired with the suggested Cabernet and we are still salivating at the thought!

Here's a breakdown of the night:\n\nAppetizers: 5/5 the polenta was unbelievable. It was incredibly light with Gorgonzola cheese and mushrooms. The Vension dish was out of this world as well. Salty, but it just melted in your mouth with arugala on top.\n\n\nDinner: 4/5 I had the Frutt E'Mar, which was good, but not incredible. The steak was incredible. The other dishes I tried had great flavors though the veal was a little tougher than it should have been. The Carbonara was the best I have ever tried. Most entree's were $18-24\n\nDessert: 5/5 almost everything was amazing. The Spumonte had great texture. The lemon tart gelato was right on the spot. I have incredibly high standards for tiramisu and while it did not quite measure up, it had very good flavor and is worth a try if you want a coffee flavor. Then we tried the Pana Cotta. Who ever thought that balsamic vinegar would be a flavor in a dessert? So strange. But it absolutely blew us away. It has a wonderful flavor that was balanced perfectly. \n\nService: 5/5. Service was prompt. In a large group there is bound to be a mixup. One of the orders was accidentally changed. They supplied the person with a complimentary dish while he waited for them to make his entree. \n\nAll in all 5/5. Bella is an excellent Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere. The lights are dim and it's a great place to sit and talk. I definitely will be going back for more.", "author": "Chris H."}

Just a warning: it is a small restaurant so it won't necessarily be a quick in and out dinner, but I loved that they let us take our time eating and didn't rush us out to turn the table.  \n\nFOOD\nApps:\nPurpett' A' Mammeta (grilled meatballs, eggplant-tomato caponata) \n\n Antipasto Della Cassa (grilled veggies, cold cuts, olives, cheese, and artichoke hearts).  The meatballs were fantastic!! LOVE.\n\nENTREES:\nTagliolini Salmone: This was my dish and it was so tasty!! It was composed of tagliolini, smoked salmon, black caviar, and a mascarpone bechamel. It was a nice portion, creamy, and very flavorful.\n\nAglio E Olio: My garlic addicted sister was addicted to this dish.  It was homemade spaghetti, with chili flakes, garlic confit, and Grana Padano (a cheese).  It was lighter than the tagliolini because it was oil based but it was still just as flavorful. \n\nCotoletta Piacentina: Breaded pork cutlet, potato puree, and sauteed spinach. This cutlet was huge; it took up probably 75% of the plate.  It was definitely enough for my dad for dinner.\n\nMaccarune Cu Salsiccia: Rigatoni in a tomato cream sugo with italian sausage.  The rigatoni was slightly under al dente but it was still good.  \n\nFrutt' 'E Mar: Squid ink tagliatelle, mussels, clams, calamari, tomato sughetto. This dish smelled great and tasted delicious. \n\nService:\nI had a reservation for a group of 7 for my grandmother's birthday.  Their credit card machine broke last night and they gave us a call earlier in the day to let us know that they would be cash only.  I definitely appreciated the warning called in advance rather than when we arrived.  \n\nThe two servers that were working tonight were so wonderful.  They were friendly and personable.  They talked to us and gave us recommendations as needed.  The Frutt' 'E Mar dish was messed up in the kitchen and took an extra 5-10 minutes to come out after the rest of the entrees.  I loved that the servers didn't try and lie and stall.  They came out, told the truth, and apologized for the delay.  After a couple of minutes, they even brought out my cousin a small portion of the spinach gnocchi to try as he waited for his dish.\n\nSince the server heard us wishing my grandmother a happy birthday, he brought out the panna cotta at the end of the meal with a candle in it.   The dessert was light and creamy.  \n\nLoved this place!  Recommended! (Sorry for the super long review, just wanted everyone to know this place was great!)", "author": "Nikki L."}

If you drop something on the floor, don't even bother trying to look for it. Anyways, overall I personally do not think the food was worth the price.

As we were leaving, he server checked the system and found us a table. YAY! \n\nGreat wine menu - I enjoyed the Rossi and boyfriend really liked the Lambrusco. Table bread was good, I just wish it was warmed up. We started off with the bruchetta - probably the best I've had - fresh mozzarella was bomb. \n\nMy main course was the rigatoni - can't go wrong. It was al dente, very flavorful. I also like the peas. Boyfriend got the pork shoulder and really enjoyed it. Fried, so it wasn't my thing, but I had a bite and it was tasteful. \n\nThe food took a while, but the server came by with complimentary refills of our wine due to the wait. It's always a great surprise when servers show their understanding, and small things really make customers really happy.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the complimentary panna cotta topped with strawberries. OMFG. I think I'll order this to-go one of these days. I can't even describe it - you must try it for yourself. \n\nOverall, I love this place. Great date-night restaurant and a place to unwind. \n\nAnother point about the great service - I asked the server where the (unisex) restroom was, he walked me to the door, tried to open the door and let me know it was occupied. When someone came out, the server appeared from nowhere and checked to make sure the restroom was decent before I went in. I was SHOCKED! I've never had anyone do that before... it was so caring! \n\nThe server ended our night by saying \"ciao bella,\" which totally put this place over the top.

My boyfriend and I came by for our second anniversary dinner yesterday and were quite impressed with the food and presentation here. The restaurant is very small so parking was a bit tricky, but there are definitely spaces within a couple blocks of the place. Inside, there's not much room and the tables are definitely squished together, but it feels very intimate and romantic - perfect for a special occasion.\n\nWe ordered the rusticanza to start (a delicious salad of field greens tossed with asparagus and endives in a truffled dressing) and it was sweet and refreshing. I particularly liked how the dressing was very sweet and tangy, but the truffle flavor still popped. For entrees, we opted for the squid ink spaghetti with shrimp, clams and mussels and the pasta with smoked salmon. I personally thought the salmon pasta was a bit underseasoned at first (boyfriend disagreed) but as I ate more, I realized that the mildness of the cream sauce balanced out the saltiness of the salmon and caviar. The squid ink spaghetti was amazing - cooked perfectly al dente - and the sauce that it was tossed in was perfect. I'm usually not a fan of tomato sauces, but this one was great in that it wasn't overwhelmingly tomato-y so the flavor of the seafood shone through. We finished with the panna cotta and it was SO good. The balsamic glaze added a new flavor dimension to the sweetness and the creaminess and the berries gave the dessert a nice acidic touch. \n\nOverall, it's a great place cooking up delicious Italian food!

I glanced at the reservations screen and I did not see our name. We were seated 10 minutes later. \n\nThe bread was mediocre at best. It was not warm or fresh. The dipping sauce was olive oil and and some sun-dried tomatoes. \n\nWe started off with the Wild Salmon Carpaccio, the portion was fairly small. For a $15 appetizer, I had maybe 2 bites of the salmon. \n\nI ordered the Linguine E Gamberi which was probably the best dish out of our entire experience. It was delicious. There was a decent number of tiger prawns and the saffron bechamel sauce was amazing.\n\nThe Frutt' 'E Mar was lacking in flavor. The appeal of the dish was probably the squid ink pasta. It was warm on the outside and a bit cold in the inside.\n\nWhile I was enjoying my entree, my water was not filled during the entire 25 minutes we had been there. It was not until I was nearly finished with the dish that I had realized all other tables were given water jugs so they could refill their cups themselves. Our waiter never asked us how the food was nor were we ever checked up on. After attempting to flag down a couple of the waitstaff and having been ignored while nearly almost all of them were walking around aimlessly, we waited maybe 10 minutes until someone came by and we were brought some water.\n\nWe had the tiramisu for desert and while it was a good, it was flat. The $8 price was unwarranted. \n\nAll in all, the service was absolutely lacking. The waitstaff didn't seem to care much at all.

It is a small establishment, but the Maitre d' was completely accommodating and seated us in no time at all. \n\nI was very impressed with the waitstaff. It seemed like most of them actually were Italian-speaking which created a very authentic Italian atmosphere. As far as it goes, the ambiance of the restaurant was also very pleasing. I especially enjoyed the vintage lighting fixtures and the screens they used to minimize the intrusion of the city street. This is a cozy restaurant with romantic lighting, a distinguished bar and atmosphere. The only thing I noted that hindered a completely romantic experience was that it was quite loud, between the music and other diners speaking loudly.\n\nThe most important part of any dining experience is the food, and I was not the least bit disappointed. Immediately we were served our own water carafe and hot bread with a plate of sun-dried tomatoes drizzled with olive oil for dipping. Both my dining companion and I ordered a glass of the house red wine which was very good. I ordered the Gnocchi Verdi which is house made spinach gnocchi with crimini mushrooms, radicchio, in a gorgonzola bechamel sauce. It was so rich, creamy, and savory in the most delightful way. The Gnocchi were cooked to perfection. My dining companion ordered the Cotoletta Alla Piccata which is the breaded pork cutlet with baby arugula, capers, and cacciocavalo. I managed to sneak a small bite and was impressed with his choice too. \n\nTalk about attentive, our server brought us wonderful morsels of house-made fried polenta to try. The only way I can describe it is heavenly! And even after we declined the dessert menu as we already splurged on chocolate truffles earlier, our server brought us two tiny glasses of that lovely Italian lemon liqueur, limoncello, and almond biscotti for dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-16", "description": "I don't know what to say...We had eaten here last summer and were really excited to come back after a long day at the California Academy of Sciences. I mean, I had been craving their food! I couldn't wait to come in.\n\nWe arrived pretty early, around 5:30, and were the first ones there. We got our choice of any seats, and sat by a window. We ordered our drinks and excitedly chattered about the menu.\n\nThen, a family with a little kid and a baby walk in. They have their choice of any seats in the place, and sit RIGHT next to us. \n\nFirst off, this is NOT a child/baby-friendly restuarant by any means (see my last review). White tablecloths, cozy date-night ambience... NOT for babies!\n\nAnd what I can't get past is that they had to sit RIGHT next to us! What's that about? You can see a couple having a nice date night, talking quietly, and you sit right next to them? I was hoping the waitress would direct them to the farthest table from us, like that big table in the front, but no, she told them to sit wherever.\n\nWe would have gotten up to move, but they were right in the middle so there wasn't really anywhere to go. So instead of enjoying fantastic Italian food in a nice restaurant, we spend the next hour listening to a baby beat the table, scream and cry. I mean, how rude can you get??\n\nWe kept giving them the LOOK, and they didn't really get it. I mean, if your baby is screaming, freaking take it outside.\n\nInstead of spending plenty of time there, ordering more wine and dessert, we got the heck out of there. The food was great as always but the evening was just totally ruined.\n\nThe last time we ate there had to have been at about 8pm, and a couple walked in with a crying baby then, too. So I'm not sure if Bella just attracts families and babies, or if San Francisco is just super baby-friendly and welcomes babies to  all their nice restaurants. Either way, I'm not sure that I'll go back. When you pay for dinner, you're also paying for ambience. Too bad because their butternut squash ravioli is about the best thing ever.", "author": "Jenny S."}

The interior is casual but very stylish (think Edison bulbs and ebony wood floors), and just spacious enough that they can accommodate a couple of larger groups as well as the usual 2 and 4 tops. The crowd was a real mix: couples on dates, multi-generational families, young ladies doing a girls' nite out, etc. Service is warm and very friendly. The complimentary house-made bread and tomato-y olive oil for dipping were delish. We had the burrata appetizer and a very fresh fennel salad -- both were divine. They also brought out an amuse bouche that was a crispy cracker topped off with an olive and tuna tapenade -- it was savory heaven.\n\nThe incredible pasta was the star of the show -- house-made with just the right springy texture.  Husband, son, and I had tonight's special, which was papardelle con sugo and it was to DIE for.  My daughter had the butternut squash ravioli with brown butter, which I tried and didn't want to give back to her, it was so flavorful and rich.  I'd describe the portions as \"just right\"...it was more than enough to fill us all up and then some. Dessert is a must. The panna cotta was silky and creamy, tiramisu was perfection, and they even bring you HOT milk with your coffee. I appreciated all of their great attention to detail. This was a wonderful experience and we'll definitely be back!", "author": "SfMom O."}

First of all, the place is super small so it's not a good place for groups. There is no place to wait inside, so we had to go to Burger King across the street while waiting for our table. Secondly, the food we ordered was so-so. From the reviews, I thought it was going to be amazing, but it was more average than anything. Maybe it was just what I got, which was the special for the day. Also, the place is so quiet! We felt extremely awkward singing happy birthday when the place was packed with people, yet completely silent. Server was great until we got the check. He didn't want to initially split the check, and gave us attitude about it, but eventually did. \n\nI think this place is better if you are on a date, or with a group no larger than 4.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-19", "description": "I had my birthday dinner here last month.  Great ambiance, service, food and overall experience = four stars!\n\nSince the reservation was for 8:00 p.m. and everyone got seated around 8:45 p.m. or so, we ended up being the only party in the restaurant (it's not that big).  This was great since we got three people (manager, waiter and another waitress) to ourselves and every need was met in a record time.  Plates and glasses were bussed quickly to our table, every glass had wine, cheese grated on pasta and all the orders were correct (including who they handed it to - I was impressed).  I couldn't have asked for better service.  \n\nThe place is very cute and clean (see pictures).  And the food is pretty good.  First, you have to order the combo antipasti dish.  It is THE mother lode of antipasti - olives, eggplant, zucchini, peppers, salami, and italian sandwich meat (what is that called again?).  It was huge.  The meatballs were not bad either.  See pictures of both that I posted!\n\nWe had three bottles of wine, but I only tried the chardonnay that was recommended by the manager.  It was very good, crispy and fresh.  Not too much of a lingering taste like I usually get and it was not overwhelming.  Hm, too bad I don't remember what it was called.\n\nMy 3 kinds of pasta dish was clean and the flavors weren't all \"mushed\" together as I expected it to taste.  I had spinach ravioli, gnocchi, and marinara penne.  All were great.  My bf had the bouillabaisse style pasta that had four clams and lots of fish as it should.  The sole gnocchi dishes looked a bit plain, but the spaghetti carbonara tasted good.  \n\nThe manager, I forgot his name, but he was very nice and sweet.  He was obliging to take pictures (always a plus! - especially when you're the last ones in the restaurant, it's late and he probably wants to go home).  I had a great time there and would definitely go back.  \n\nBeware:  The parking sucked as it normally does in this area.  Fortunately, everyone got there.  Also, since it was gay pride weekend and on a Saturday night, we could not grab taxis in this area either (or get a taxi to come pick us up!).", "author": "Chris L."}

He looked around and said..\"ok, 10 minutes\".  Did he forget about my reservation?  \n\nFortunately we were seated in 10, and then things kicked off with bread.  Unfortunately the bottom was burnt, so it felt like eating a marshmallow wedged between two pieces of cardboard.  Soft inside, hard / tasteless outside.\n\nFor main meal I had the gnocchi, but unfortunately it was just ok.  The sausage was flavorful, but the gnocchi was mushy and the cheese had no taste.\n\nAs I was eating, I noticed I wasn't the only reservation the host forgot about.  We were sitting near front, and overheard the host reacting the same way to each person who said they have a reservation.  \n\nI honestly think the host didn't take down the reservations, just thinking there'd be enough free tables. Then the front filled up with no tables open, and people started grumbling about how they had a reservation but no table.\n\nLastly, our waitress was about as talkative as a librarian: I had to start our conversation and get her to say anything.  I don't mind starting conversation, but when it's your job to do that, you're failing.", "author": "Charlie B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "My actual rating is 4.8 stars\n\nA year ago we walked by this restaurant and decided at some point we were going to try it. It was busy which is usually a good sign, small, not pretentious and the menu looked sound. We were slightly late for our reservation so we had to wait outside for a few mins, no problem, parking in this area can be slightly tricky and set us behind a bit. My group of four decided to order family style, in order to ensure a large variety of dishes. \nWe ordered the following:\nbrussel sprouts\nbutternut squash ravioli\ncarbonera\nmeatballs with eggplant sauce\ngnocchi\nveal scaloppine\nhanger steak\naffogato\npanna cotta\npaired with 2010 Clos Pegase Hommage Cabernet Sauvignon from home\n\nAppetizers:\nOne of the guests in our party is a vegetarian, they made the brussel sprouts without meat per request. The butternut squash ravioli was superb, delicate and sweet on the palate and very fresh. The carbonera is also fantastic, not heavy, just as described on the menu. The meatballs with eggplant sauce were also amazing, I somehow missed this dish on the menu but i'm very glad someone ordered it!\n\nEntrees:\nThe gnocchi was probably the softest I've ever eaten, a must order for sure. The veal was cooked to perfection and the b\u00e9chamel sauce was a nice touch, also highly recommended. The hanger steaks were enjoyed by the people who ordered them, personally I found the steaks just okay, maybe I just wasn't in a steak mood.\n\nDessert:\nThe affogoto was good, a nice touch to the end of the dinner. The panna cotta is worth the raving reviews found elsewhere on this site, even though I was very full I kept trying to eat it.\n\nService: Extremely friendly, personable, quick to laugh and almost had a \"you're family\" feel. At times our table felt slightly abandoned; I had to pour water and wine for the table twice, but that's me being VERY picky. The overall kindness, generosity and personality of the staff still won me over.\n\nIn conclusion: Exceptional dinner, will return, friendly service and I'm very surprised this restaurant doesn't have a michelin star behind it's name. \nHowever, I like the fact it's not well known or discussed in the popular food articles. keep it local, keep it friendly, and keep up the great work", "author": "R J."}

I ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood because I wanted to try their homemade pasta and their seafood stew.  It was good, but not great.  I think it was lacking a layer of flavor which I can't exactly pinpoint.  My friends got the pasta norcina and gnocchi and those were great!  Other pasta that was ordered were A-ok.  \nWe were so stuffed so we decided to not get dessert.  However, they give you complimentary panna cotta that we all shared.

We got there super early for our reservation (like 20 minutes) but they luckily had a table available that they let us take (it was SUPER windy outside) . We only had to park two blocks away and this was on a Friday at 8PM.\nThe entryway is a doorway which makes sense as the place is pretty small (15ish tables and like 2 seats at the bar) but it was warm inside and very cozy. We got water right away- small glasses but they give you a carafe for the table, bread with oil and a half carafe of house red - very tasty and inexpensive!\nFor an appetizer we had the Bone Marrow which was surprisingly tasty. It was really rich and buttery tasting and served on toast with Italian parsley. The bone was really clean cut. We also shared a house salad which was a decent sized regular salad.\nFor my bfs main, he had Rigatoni Salsiccia which was in a tomato cream sauce with sausage. He said it was very good and practically inhaled the whole plate.\nI had the Tagliolini Salmon E Caviale which was with salmon and caviar in a beschamel sauce, and was literally, THE BEST pasta I had every had in my entire life might I add. I was full near the end up I kept shoveling it in cause it was amazing. I almost ordered the Oso Buco which was on special but knew I would probably never finish it. Seriously though, this pasta was amazing. If you like salmon and don't mind a rich sauce- order this dish. The caviar adds a great crunch to the dish.\nAfter licking our plates clean, we ended with the night with Panna Cotta (almost the Zabaione) and all desserts were $2.50 for a pretty decent size of sweetness. Perfect to share with your sweetness (see what I did there...?) And OF COURSE the Panna Cotta was really great. It was topped with macerated berries and some balsamic.\nWhole bill came out to $107 before tip which was a really great deal considering the quality.  Would definitely recommend to all my friends and revisit soon!\nAlso it was pretty busy so definitely have a reservation for date nights!", "author": "Kajal G."}

Quaint and charming, the ambience sets just the right mood for a memorable night.  You are greeted with a staff that is welcoming and accomodating.

Your taste buds will be dancing as you are guaranteed to find a new Italian favorite.  Save room for dessert...the gelato is to die for!  I am certain to visit Bella's on my next trip to SF and tell all my friends about this hidden gem. \n\nOur group ordered Bruschetta, Parmigiana, Polentun a' Bella, Bone Marrow, Sorrentina, Burro E Salvia, Carbonara Originale, Cotoletta Alla Piccata, Tiramisu, Panna Cotta, and Gelato.", "author": "Jessica H."}

We got there a few minutes early, but we didn't experience the long waits as indicated by other reviewers, despite it being a Friday night. We were seated within 5 minutes of getting there. \n\nBella is a good size restaurant, and has a soft, and relaxed atmosphere. While nothing in the restaurant screams Italian, the place was comfortable enough for us to enjoy our meal. \n\nThey started us with the sun dried tomato olive oil and bread. The oil was delicious, but I found the bread to be a bit doughy for my liking. We then ordered the Bone Marrow and it was served with slightly burnt bread, although it did not deter us from loving the dish. My husband had their risotto; it was hearty and very good; I would have added a little bit less salt and not so much water, but that may just be a personal preference on how risotto should be cooked. I ordered the squid ink pasta... which MADE the meal. It is everything as delicious as everyone describes in their reviews. I would come back just for this dish! The clam to shrimp to pasta ratio was perfect. My husband was quite jealous he didn't order my dish. (Yes I shared a bit). We finished off with the tiramisu (no, we did not get the complimentary panna cotta), Dessert was fine, but nothing I would go back for.  \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place, especially if you live in the area. While I wouldn't rush back to find parking in Inner Richmond just for Bella, I would definitely go back if i'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Winny F."}

Free dessert was a plus.\n\nI came here on a Friday night at 7pm and surprisingly, we were seated immediately because the restaurant was half empty. Despite the high waiter-to-customer ratio (4 waiters, 5 tables), it took forever for our waiter to stop gossiping in the corner, meander by, introduce himself, and take our order. Don't get me wrong, all the waiters are really nice, but suck at their jobs.\n\nAs with any semi-nice Italian restaurant, we got free bread and olive oil with this tomato paste in it. While I thought the tomato olive oil was good, the bread tasted like those cold dinner rolls from Costco (ok I lie, because I would never eat Costco dinner rolls, but I can imagine that's what it would taste like), and Bella Tratoria has taken Black Angus' crown for the worst free bread ever.\n\nFor dinner, I got the Smoked Salmon Caviar pasta. The smoked salmon and caviar was the only highlight of my dish. The pasta wasn't my thing - it was too thick, dry, and quite flavorless. Still, I finished everything because the portions were pretty small. If a barely 5 ft. tall asian girl thinks the portions are small, I can only imagine what a normal size human being would think. \n\nI would've given this place 2 stars, except another waiter brought us free panna cotta with strawberries for dessert.

Along with the rain, it doesn't seem like we have a bright chance of a quiet dinner without the baby. We hopped from one location to other with stomachs grumbling and protesting when I made an executive decision to pick the final choice. Bella Trattoria came on top of our list and when we arrive, it almost felt like another fruitless choice. Thankfully, they were warmer than the cold rain and made arrangements to have a table ready for us.\n\nBella is quite a cozy little spot and definitely has a warm and romantic setting! Everything looked perfect for a birthday dinner!\n\nWe ordered the Minestrone (because hot soup tastes great in cold weather!) and the Baked Polenta for appetizers and the Squid Ink Pasta and Grilled Hanger Steak for entrees. The Minestrone had quite a flavorful broth and was soothing after being out in the rain! Good stuff! The Baked Polenta was good, but the gorgonzola that it had was really strong for me. \n\nThe Squid Ink pasta was my first ever and I've always wanted to try it! Honestly, I don't think the ink did much in flavor, but it was definitely cool to see a dish of black pasta! This wouldn't be something that I would stay away! The Grilled Hanger Steak was delicious too, but it had gorgonzola too! Now I have nothing against this amazing cheese! Just not something that I eat all the time. \n\nAs I mentioned, the staff was friendly, accommodating and warm! Maybe it's the Italian hospitality, but I would think that's a quality that everyone would have. Either way, my wife and I really appreciate it under our wet circumstances.

As busy as they were, we received outstanding service from Robert, a friend of the owner.  If you like pasta, Bella has a very good selection.   We immediately received our drinks and homemade bread with a tomato base spread.  We liked the bread so much, we got more to go.\n\nWe started with a small size anti pasta, which was ample.  It consisted of very nicely prepared veggies, cheeses, meats, olives, and a little salad.  Very good.  We ordered a dish of Penne Pasta with smoked chicken, cremini mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes. Delicious.  The Papadarelle ribbon pasta, pork, beef, and tomato base was wonderful.  The dishes are so generous we both took food to go and enjoyed a delicious lunch the next day.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Panna Cotta (a Italian type flan) simply delicious.

The Burro e Salvio was over butternut squash raviolis with just the right amount of sweetness.

That is fine, but the seats they gave us at the bar had menus scattered about on the seats and bar, plus their water pitcher. We had to move all the stuff so we could actually sit there (staff did nothing). Upon sitting no one asked us if we would like a drink/appetizer, so we were really just waiting for our table. After about 10 minutes (past 8PM), they sat us at a table.\n\nThe table they gave us was near the door, certainly some better tables open. A couple without reservations was given one of those tables soon after we sat. Okay, not great service, but that is alright.\n\nUpon sitting, we waited about 8 minutes for any amount of service. Finally they brought us water (told him we were ready to order, he blew me off). About 5 minutes after they brought us water the waiter finally comes over to take our order. We ordered four plates of food.\n\nIn general, portions are small and not so filling. Luckily there was free bread that helped to fill the void... Although no bread served with the meal (pasta dishes), waiter did not ask if we'd like more.\n\nApt/Dinner:\n- Eggplant Parm - Decent, not very crispy too much cheese, only comes with two pieces of eggplant for $9, seems like they could have done a bit more, presentation absolutely lacking.\n- Marinara Pizza - Not very large for the the price (doesn't even have cheese), toppings were seriously lacking, mostly looked like bread with sauce on it\n- Smoked Salmon Pasta - Not bad, the caviar didn't really mix well with the smoked salmon (too salty), absolutely too much use of cream just for cream sake. Seemed like a lack of effort to make a flavorful dish (small portion as well)\n- Butternut Squash Ravioli - Pretty good, but missing some flavor, comes with just small medium sized ravioli. Asked to see if they could add sausage to the dish (do a side or something), the waiter was kind of rude and said no way.\n\nDessert:\n- Tiramisu - Nothing thrilling about this whatsoever\n- Complimentary fruit/yogurt dish - Wasn't very good, fruit looked kind of old, said he gave it to us because of the wait... Oh, but the table next to us got one as well, not sure how that works out.\n\nOverall, the food isn't terrible, honestly I'd almost give them another shot, but the waiter that we had seemed like he simply didn't care about our table.

It was great in terms of ambiance, food, and service.\n\nThis place has the kind of ambiance I expect from an Italian restaurant. It is small, dark, and intimate, and stands in contrast to some other SF Italian joints in the more tourist-y areas like North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf. The paintings of Venice on the walls and bare Thomas Edison-style light bulbs add just the right touch. \n\nWe started off with drinks. My Prosecco was smooth, yet tart, while the taste of my husband's cocktail was too sweet for me. However, he seemed to enjoy it very much. As for appetizers, I had a Roman Salad - which was something I'd never tried before. It seemed like an Italian Caesar salad, with its tart, anchovy-containing dressing, romaine heart, shaved pecorino romano cheese, and croutons - which I removed, since I have celiac disease - they were not mentioned on the menu, but I know for next time. I had no bad reaction, thanks to the croutons not being crushed into the dressing at all. My husband ordered venison carpaccio, which came topped with arugula and croutons, and bathed in olive oil. The slice I had was deliciously game-y,  rich, and made me wish I was eating bread with it.\n\nMy main dish was Puttanesca served with gluten-free corn spaghetti. It was fittingly fishy, with albacore tuna and real green olives, served with shredded cheese. I usually wolf down my plate of food but I really tried to take my time with this one, to savor every moment. My husband ordered a ragu dish with wide egg noodles and Bolognese sauce, and a topping of shredded cheese as well. I did not get to try his for obvious reasons but he reported it being delicious as well. We were both so full when we finished our plates that we declined dessert, but we were brought a dish of panna cotta served with strawberries on the house, and wow, was it delicious as well.\n\nThe service was prompt, friendly, and there was a young woman with an Italian accent who I assume was the proprietor - she was very good at explaining the dishes we had never heard of before, and made sure we were enjoying our food.

The restaurant made sure to call Saturday early evening to confirm the reservation and make sure that they had all the correct information.\n\nWhen we arrived, we had to wait for our table to clear. We hung out at Buckshot, the bar next door. Once our table was ready, the host walked over and got us.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and accommodating, recommending us a good bottle of wine for the table and checking in with us often. He asked us the occasion and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had the best possible evening. All of us were comfortably seated and able to enjoy the meal. They let us share gnocchi as an appetizer - and it was unanimously declared to be the best gnocchi we had ever eaten. They were fine with a few sets of guests sharing entrees. We ordered everything from the risotto to the frutt' e mar and it was all delicious. The affogato was mindblowingly good...it tasted well-mixed and the ice cream tasted almost as if it were whipped into the espresso. I'm concerned that I'll never be able to properly enjoy another affogato again in comparison!\n\nThe atmosphere felt jovial. Throughout the night, there were many large tables of people catching up, celebrating, and just having a good time over a delicious meal. It feels like the restaurant thrives on these big get-togethers, and the staff feeds off the energy. \n\nMy one criticism would be that the service (however welcoming), was relatively slow. I understand that we were a very large group, but the general service did seem much slower than ordinary, even for a table of our size. We also had to wait a bit for our table to clear, although we arrived on time.\n\nNonetheless, I'm glad that we decided to have our dinner at Bella Trattoria. I could not have asked for a better evening to catch up with some dear friends.", "author": "Alyssa W."}

The atmosphere was great, sultry and low light with a great mix of jazz in the background.  The host and waiter were attentive and open to explaining the menu (as well as the Napoli Diego Maradona homage) and the food was... unreal.  The Gnocchi Verdi was verging on cheesegasmic.  Never have I had pasta so soft and perfectly complimented by such a creamy mushroom sauce.  My accompaniment for the evening quite enjoyed her gluten free red cream sauce pasta as well, which is difficult in itself to find!\n\nWine selection by the waiter was perfect, especially since my date and had contrasting meals and desert, but he selected two and had us taste before deciding... I loved the smokey oak taste of the first, but we opted for the smoother, sweeter taste for the lady.  I don't recall the names unfortunately.\n\nDesert.  The gelato was like eating a light lemon cloud.  It melted the instant it touched my mouth, and much like the gnocchi, I could swear the whole experience was a dream!\n\nIf we're in this part of the bay again, you can bet that I'll be sure to stop by again, and I recommend you do too.", "author": "Benjamin H."}

We enjoyed all the dishes. But nothing was very good to great. No \"you have to try this one!\" moments.  Gnocchi were probably the biggest letdown as we've recently found a place that makes the most incredible gnocchi - gnocchi worth waiting in line for (which by the way, we were forced to do here.  We showed up 20 minutes early for our reservation. Our table was ready 20 minutes late.)  These were bland and mushy, smothered in cream. The Burrata, which I've had exquisitely prepared with nothing but olive oil and sea salt, was a bore. There were no hints of spice anywhere - well, maybe a stray bay leaf or the occasional olive, caper, or parsley, but that's all. Brushetta with tomatoes was standard. Wine was good.  Perhaps the highlight of the meal was the not al dente, but still very yummy Pappardelle & very rich meaty Ragu. All in all, better than pizza. We won't be back.", "author": "Alex M."}

The staff is mostly native Italian, which is mainly a plus.  Service is warm and friendly, but can be a little disorganized. I find it helps to grab a table nearer the kitchen if possible so you stay on their radar.\n\nI have tried several different plates here, and have not been disappointed, which I cannot say about a lot of other Italian restaurants in SF. Also, they have a reasonable corkage fee  (~$15) if you want to bring a bottle from home.\n\nUseless addendum : I assume this place has southern Italian roots, given the various FC Napoli memorabilia on the walls. Napoli was Maradona's team during the 80s, and he really put them on the map. It was great to see homage paid to the little chubby genius...I found myself constantly staring at the posters & photos on the walls.", "author": "Tom M."}

I had the Carbonara (wow!), and my friends had the Frutt de Mar, the Puttanesca, and the Gnocchi Verdi.  We all thought our dishes were among the best we'd ever had, and they arrived piping hot.\n\nDesserts were good, though small and not particularly a value for the 8 bucks they charge.  Still, the Zabaglione was light and not too sweet.  Good service, nice atmosphere.  So why only 4 stars?

There's definitely been a noticeable change in the cooking and in the service. I ordered the same dish as last time (Tagliolini Salmone e Caviale) because it was that delicious and my friend also ordered that dish the second time I was here. When the food arrived the portions were obviously different: mine was half the size of my friend's dish even though we ordered the same thing. Also, the dish was tasteless: no flavor and had a strong fishy aftertaste that shouldn't be there. \n\nThe service was very disappointing. It took forever for the food to come out. One of our drinks never came and they only gave us the drink when we asked for it again. Last time we were here, my friends and I were very impressed and really appreciated how much time and effort the waiter took to explain the menu to us and present in detail the specials. The 2nd and 3rd times I was here, the presentation was lackluster and brief, it did not make me want to have whatever they were talking about. As a frequent restaurant goer, I appreciate the description of the food on the menu and personal interaction is extremely important. \n\nI would hesitate to come here again.\n\nStill, I would give Bella Trattoria 3 stars because the ambiance is cute and cozy. It's still a good spot for groups of friends to gather. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOne word: Charming. \n\nWhat makes all the difference here is that the wait staff is amazing! All of them are friendly, welcoming and have an engaging sense of humor. Throughout the night they would check on us to make sure we're having a good time and a good laugh and even strike up some conversations. One of them even made a fruity little cocktail for my friend on the house just for fun :) (and Cinco de Mayo) \n\nFood is tasty, fresh and beautifully presented. I tried: Tagliolini Salmone e Caviale (smoked salmon and caviar in a white sauce) \nAlso tried: Gnochhi Verdi (Spinach Gnocchi, Gorgonzola-Portabello Veschmel) so  soft and fresh!\n\nDecor simple yet elegant. Love the hanging lights and high ceiling and since they're on the corner they have large windows looking outside.\n\nIt was my friend's birthday and they surprised her by turning up the music, having the whole restaurant sing \"Happy Birthday\" to her and gave her some delicious panna cotta (so creamy and smooth) topped with fresh strawberries. \n\nWe felt like we were transported to charming Italy for an evening.

Got in, got our table, and went for an appetizer of bruschetta which also came with mozzarella. Best I've ever had. Usually I dread bruschetta and dread half slices of baby tomatoes too, but these were the best tomatoes I've ever had. Flavor was wondering (seriously, I really dislike tomatoes). Only minus is that they don't even out appetizers for the number in the group...as a result, we had to endure the awkward moments of not wanting to be rude and really insisting the other party members eat the remaining piece of bruschetta.\n\nThere was an order of butternut squash ravioli, portabello ravioli, carbonara pancetta, and I had a portabello chicken pasta of some sort. \nI tried the two types of ravioli and my pasta...I'd say, the butternut squash ravioli was the best and I really wish I'd gotten that. My pasta was great and lasted a couple meals, but the unique flavor of the ravioli was drool worthy.  Tiramisu looked great and it was quite painful to have to skip trying it. They do local ingredients, vegetarian, (maybe vegan), and meat dishes, price to food and quality ratio is right on par, and their drink selection was alright.

Aside from the slice of orange in our glass, it did not come with any other fruit nor did it have the fruity taste. It tasted like watered down wine. It did not give me a headache the next morning like some other places that use cheap wine, but I was not satisfied with the taste of the sangria here.\n\nFor appetizers, we all tried the tuna and beef carpaccio. They were sliced soooo thin that I could not really taste the flavor of the meat itself. I tasted more of the lemons, capers, cheese, and lettuce instead.\n\nThe two entrees I tried were my gnocchi and the BF's lasagna. I had never had gnocchi before but I had always wanted to try these potato dumplings. I imagined it to be a little starchier but the gnocchi at Bella was veryy soft, too soft.. it was like a savory marshmallow. I did not really like the lumps of mozzarella either. I'm very familiar with the texture of mozzarella  but for some reason this time it was very hard for me to chew. I did like the sausages though and overall it's a pretty filling dish.\n\nI did like the lasagna a lot. The meat sauce wasn't too tomatoey (just the way I like it) and the lasagna skin was cooked perfectly.

There was only table there, we got the table right the way.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant was very nice.  The ambiance is cozy, warm and intimate.  The service was very good too.  Very efficient, welcome and friendly.\n\nThey started off with a free appetizer (don't know what that is) but it was good.  The complimentary bread was so good.  Fresh and warm.  I especially like the Olive oil with the sun-dried tomato.  Good combination.  \n\nWe got the  Bruschetta as the appetizer.  It was toasted bread with chopped tomato, garlic, basil and olive oil.  It was so good.  The bread toasted so perfect, not too crunchy.  \n\nMy friend ordered a Smoke Salmon pasta and I got a chicken and mushroom pasta.  Both pasta were cream sauce.  The sauce was very creamy and flavorful.    Out of the two pasta, I like mine more.  The chicken was tender.  But the only thing was my pasta was slightly overcooked.  Overall, still very delicious.\n\nActually I wanted to try their dessert but too full.  And they were so nice to give us free dessert.  It was Panna Cotta topped with strawberries and blackberries.  The Panna Cotta was good.  Very smooth and creamy but not too sweet.  \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful at Bella.  I will go back there for sure.", "author": "Liza T."}

I came over here with my g/f to celebrate my birthday.  It was a little rowdy and noisy inside as far as the ambiance went.\n\nI ordered the spinach and cranberry salad and squid ink risotto, and my g/f had the chicken rigatoni.  Everything was really great except the squid ink risotto.  Had to wait 25+ minutes for it only to find out that it was a bit undercooked (it was a little hard and rough in texture), but I just ate it anyway because I didn't want to wait out another 25 minutes for another portion.  I will say however, the taste profile was spot on for the risotto and was actually tasty.\n\nThe upsides were they did give us free fried polenta, polenta with mushrooms, and even free dessert!  Based on previous reviews, this seemed like a pretty common theme amongst a lot of guests, so I can only say positive things about their service.\n\nOverall, this is a nice italian restaurant that has good flavor profiles and does give a lot of great customer service.  I think it is well worth a try if you are in the area.", "author": "Lawrence E."}

Two months before my graduation, I sought a restaurant that had parking, accepted reservations and provided a decent atmosphere for 10 people. By decent atmosphere, I mean I didn't want my group to seem too loud amongst other patrons, but also wanted it to be fairly quiet that I could converse with my guests. San Francisco is a hard place to find restaurants that meet all criteria, mainly due to the parking issue. \n\nBella Trattoria is on Geary, which offers somewhat more parking than a restaurant downtown. My ceremony ended at 7:30, so I made the reservation for 8:15. Even though the restaurant was basically one giant hill away, I wanted to give my guests (coming in 3 different cars) enough time to find the place and find parking (which is tricky on a Friday night because of things happening on Geary and Clement, respectively). We all showed up on time, but the restaurant wasn't ready. I was a little irked because it was cold, raining and small (meaning some of my family had to stand outside while waiting). Finally three tables were vacated and they seated us. I will say the server was patient and originally very attentive. He quickly asked what the occasion was and provided me a free glass of champagne.\n\nThe bread was cold, drinks took a while (no hard liquor, just wine) and the food took a while as well. I ate the squid puttanesca. I think the Sir had veal osso buco (delicious!). Most of my family members thought the portions were very small, but the food was good. They also provided free panna cotta and I mean free. Not skimpy free, but three plates-worth so everyone in my party could have a try. I think this was a peace offering for the wait time and it was much appreciated and not expected. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for. I don't think my party was loud, don't think anyone was even too annoyed by my party and the service was ok. I do think I may have went on a night where the entire restaurant was comprised of 3 large parties, but that just worked to our favor. Another thing I liked was that instead of tacking on the expected 18% gratuity for large parties, they provide a recommendation and let you write in your choice. I clearly appreciate the small things and eventually would go back.", "author": "Mae M."}

Made reservations just because of other reviews saying how crowded it gets.  The restaurant is on a corner so easy to spot....parking not so easy.  I actually spent 30 min finding parking on a Saturday at like 6pm so I guess it should of been expected.  \n\nWe got an appetizer of a beef carpaccio I believe?  For us we thought it was good but for the price and the amount of food it was, it just didn't do it for us.\n\nMy gf got the verde gnocchi which she just loved! Of course I had a bite and it was delicious, for me I could of used some meat but still really good.\n\nI myself got the hyped squid ink pasta because nowadays I always look at yelp to get an idea of what to get.  Looks really weird...tastes really good!  Definitely would get it again!\n\nFor dessert we ended up getting the panna cotta and that was just delicious as well.

Jube was our waiter and was incredibly friendly.  He made us feel very welcome and made great wine recommendations to go with our dinners.\n\nI had the squid ink pasta and my girlfriend had rigatoni with sausage.

We made reservations at 6:30 and no one was at the door to greet us or tell us what to do. My cousin was trying to find parking so I brought the kids into the restaurant and it was already 6:30. It was a very small restaurant with no space by the entrance. With no one telling us where our table was, the kids and I had to stand around for about 10 minutes before someone realized we were standing by small entrance by the door. Then it took them another 5 minutes to set up a table for us. There were already open seats but their seating process just took forever. We ordered a Gnocchi Verdi, Pasta Norcina, and a Frutt' 'E Mar. The food was decent. I didn't like the gnocchi verdi as much because the wine taste was very strong in that dish. The kids didn't enjoy it either. The Pasta Norcina was my favorite! We also asked for a 500 ml wine and they forgot about our wine order so we had to ask for it again. The waiter apologized for the misplacing our order. He was the best waiter that waited our table because he was responsive and apologetic when he forgot what we had ordered. There were at least 4 waiters/waitresses bussing our table. It just seemed very chaotic. If I were to visit SF again, I would most likely not come back or take people here unless I had a lot of time.

This is the former, and it's done just right. \n\nThe tuna app was great...super thin, with a drizzle of oil and melt in your mouth.  yum!  We also got the eggplant parm app, and it was good, but not anything to hit home about.\n\nOff to the mains...a smoked salmon pasta and a simple arrabiata.  First off the pasta was fresh, and fantastic...this is simple simple thing most places can't do right.  I could have actually eaten the pasta without the salmon and not complained at all.  The sidekick raved about her dish too, said it was spicy as balls, and perfect.  \n\nClosed off with a tiramisu (what better way to judge an Italian place?)...probably one of the best I've had.\n\nOK the service:  Gordan Ramsey would probably scream at the owner to either stay in the kitchen or work outside, I think he's doing both with staff helping.

I made the switch, asked for the spicy arrabiata with the GF pasta, done and done. The pasta came back in ONE BIG CLUMP. I had to just take some of the strings that were lose on top and give up on the rest. On the positive, the SAUCE was AMAZING, fresh, spicy, flavorful. I thought it was just the life of a GF girl but my friend ordered REGULAR PASTA and it was ALSO CLUMPY. My other friend ordered the pasta with chicken and mushrooms and there was HARDLY any CHICKEN. When they asked how the meal was, I showed them my clump and they said \"well that's what happens with Gluten-Free pasta\". Um no. I buy brown rice pasta from the grocery store and it never clumps up, I said in my own head. I just smiled and they took the plates away. They came back with some free desserts, PANNA COTTA and LEMON SORBET both of which were GLUTEN-FREE and amazing. \n\nOverall, I'm not impressed. This is a pretty high end place with homemade pasta... they should have a bit more pride in what they are serving. If you cannot execute the dish, don't serve it.

The restaurant itself small, quaint and homey with a very classy but down to earth feel to it. Dimmed lights, not too loud, very romantic setting. The ambience and atmosphere is perfectly conducive to the beginning of a very romantic evening. \n\nI don't even know how to get started on the food. Before appetizers, we got the bread and olive oil. We inhaled it. The oil was probably the best olive oil I've ever had! Then we got the bruschetta and OMG. Food-gasm. Absolutely the best best best I've ever had in my life. And believe me I've tried a lot of different bruschettas! Every ingredient was so fresh and made with so my TLC that it was absolutely incredible! I had just a simple spaghetti for my main meal and my special person had the seafood platter. I didn't try the seafood platter but he said it was YUM! Now my dish -- I'm not usually a fan of spaghetti, but for personal purposes I was vegetarian this day (thus the reason I didn't try the seafood platter) and the server suggested that I just pick something on the menu rather than customizing any dishes. So I settled for the simple spaghetti and to my surprise it was the absolute most incredible pasta I have ever had!!!!! The spaghetti was handmade by the chef and all the ingredients used were so incredibly fresh. It was also the perfect flavor!!! I was really full and had to take it home and ate it cold the next day and it was stilllll incredibly delicious. \n\nI can go on and on about this place. 5 stars is definitely not enough! The service there was also just amazing. When we got there we didn't have any reservations but they made a setting at the bar and made it very intimate and it turned out better than sitting at a table. Also every person there was so nice and very attentive to what we needed. At the end of our meal, they gave us a dessert on the house! We topped the meal off with an expresso and called it a night. \n\nThis place seriously did no wrong. And it did incredible amounts of right.

If only this ended there: the head chef personally came out with the \"remade dish\" and informed us that the it was meant to be spicy and they added something to make it less so since my boyfriend just couldn't handle it. Neither my boyfriend and I knew how to respond to this, not only did the wait staff not know an integral component of the dish, but we were also insulted by the chef. \n\nThis eating experience was not worth the two hour wait.

It came out to being around $35 a person including tax and tip. The portions were pretty small and each dish had to be shared amongst 3-4 people. These were my highlights:\n\nbruschetta - The pieces of bread were toasted just right and topped with fresh tomatoes and basil with mozzarella on the side. The cheese was really bland but everything else tasted great without it. I had 2 helpings of this! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/msT3LrLB4fhN04HYHuFsew?select=7v3PWQxrYMnD9dryVch5ig)\n\nbreaded pork loin - This was pretty much a breaded pork loin covered with tomato sauce and some parmesan cheese. Nothing that special but wasn't dry and tasted good. The size was skimpy though and could have been more substantial. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/msT3LrLB4fhN04HYHuFsew?select=XkUQNcQY5Mi1WuXnIvzjsA)\n\n4 mini desserts - I liked how they provided some variety with this. It included a mousse, ice cream, a mini slice of strawberry cheesecake, and a flan-like strawberry dessert. They weren't that bad nor too sweet  but were difficult to split up to share. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/msT3LrLB4fhN04HYHuFsew?select=rNtFK5p9tsISsqogBTbg3w)\n\nEverything else was mediocre at best and the service wasn't the greatest. We asked one of the servers for a spoon but he kinda gave us a rude look and never came back with one. They also didn't really come by to check up on how we were doing, just to take away empty plates and deal with the bill. Maybe it was because some of us were sitting on the far end of the room and we had a big party.\n\nThe ambiance was definitely romantic with the dim lighting and candles on each table.

Little did we know they were preparing to have the World Cup on TV with random people waltzing in and out of the restaurant cheering loudly while eating our meal. We came here to celebrate a birthday so it was not the ambiance we were expecting but everything was made up for by the service and food. \n\nThis place serves some legit Italian. You can taste it in the sauces especially. The gnocchi was awesome as gnocchi should be and all plates were licked clean. We were given free dessert at the end of our meal which made everyone's eyes light up. I think they felt bad about what happened with the reservations.

My mom, cousin, and I came here for dinner after walking the Golden Gate Bridge.  (My cousin's a San Fran firefighter, so he knows what's up, and all the good places.  This was his doing!)  Our basket was constantly refilled with sourdough bread that emitted steam when you tore it.  And it was so chewy!  Oh, wow.  Best bread experience.  For sure.\n\nThe wine selection here is quite extensive-- it didn't seem as if you could really go wrong.  We certainly didn't.\n\nEntrees were amazing.  I ordered spaghetti carbonara, and it was so simple and wonderful!  I must say, though, that my favorite carbonara was on my Tuscany trip last year, but I really can't hold that against them... theirs was a close second.  My cousin got the special of the day (I totally forgot what it was-- some ragu of some sort I think), and my mom got butternut squash ravioli.  All was delicious.  \n\nOf course we got dessert.  (Hey, it was vacation!)  I had some sort of affogato coffee thing, which rivaled my favorite dessert at Manhattan's Otto.  My mom and Steve split tiramisu, and I stole lots of bites.  Solid, all around, fantastic.\n\nAmbiance was perfect, too.  Good for an early-ish afternoon family dinner, but I can see that it would be a nice date spot, as well.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving them five stars (and maybe this is far too picky because I loved everything about this mean) is due to the olive oil for the bread.

The bruschetta was very delicious, cheese wasn't too overwhelming and the tomatoes give it this light and fresh taste. The meatballs were seasoned perfectly and the sauce was full of flavor. I had the Macaroni with ragu (tomato cream sauce) as my main and he had the infamous carbonara. Both were good dishes but he expected more from the carbonara. The reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the antipasti selection was mostly vegetarian dishes (wish we had more selections with meat).

It reminds me of that story, The Emperor's New Clothes. It seems like every other person thinks this place is great except me.\n\nIt tries desperately but fails miserably to be a fancy respectable restaurant. But then again, I might be the idiot here who chose to wait an hour and 17 minutes for a silver dollar-size portion of undercooked Tragliolini Salmone that I finished in two bites. I guess their idea of fancy is to serve a bite size portion on a large plate and charge $18 for it, while making you wait, and wait, and wait. In addition to the Tragliolini, I ordered a cup of Minestrone soup. I'd pass if I were you. - Bland would be an understatement. I still can't get over how long the wait was for our food to come out. If you have an appetite for bullshit, then this place will definitely satisfy you with a big hot smelly plate of it. No one ever came out to apologize for the delay or bothered giving an explanation as to what was keeping the food from coming out. All I kept getting was that it would be coming out in 15 minutes. When the waiter says \"15 more minutes\" three different times after you've already waited 32, I believe that qualifies as getting the runaround. Instead of owning up to their mistake, they tried to appease us by serving us some disgusting excuse for cake. First of all, why would anyone want cake before their pasta and after their soup? Also, when they came out with the cake, they served it to us with such arrogance, as if they were doing us such a huge favor. The cake was basically the size of two pieces of See's candies stuck together. \n\nWhat puzzled me was that the restaurant wasn't even busy that night. There were two other parties, but more empty chairs than occupied. I guess that should've been a sign to stay away since it was a Saturday evening. The second sign to cut our losses and just leave was when a couple came in after and left before us. Their food never made it out to their table. I don't know if they had a change of heart or just got sick of waiting. I will never go back to this place. I feel like a fool for putting up with them.", "author": "John S."}

I really enjoyed having 2 bites of her dish.. however it also became overwhelming after a few more bites. i had the pork cutlet ($19.00) and it came as only a large piece of breaded pork topped with melted cheese on marinara sauce. it was really good as well.. but also became extremely overwhelming upon further bites. neither of us were able to finish our entrees even though both dishes werent much in portion. with more than half of our food left.. we got the check. \n\nthe decor is really romantic, and the hostess and chefs are really nice, friendly folks. its quiet in there and a good place to wine and dine. however, i wouldnt say that the food is THE BEST ive ever tasted. it was way too overwhelming for everything. perhaps i am unfamiliar with the norms of italian food and my bias has overcome this yelp review, but i felt the food was too strong.. each bite felt like a meal in itself... i couldnt handle it, nor could my girlfriend.. too cheesy, too buttery, and too overwhelming! just my 2cents. other than that, wonderful place. i would suggest a glass of wine to help with the food.. perhaps it would have made the entrees better. to conclude this post: great first bites, but overwhelming 4th, 5th, 6th... etc bites.\n\n-wifive-", "author": "simon k."}

Fresh bread that is soft which compliments well with the olive oil and sun dried tomatoes.  The bread was honestly my favorite.  As for the pasta, everything was fresh and delicious, just as equivalent or even better than places where u may pay 20+ a plate.  As for the desserts, they are adequate.

As we ate the bread, one of the owners(?) was watching the soccer game cheering on Napoli, which just added to the authenticity of the food.\n\nFor a very good price of $15, we had the special which came with either a garden salad (with a very good vinaigrette) or tomato soup, the daily pasta (which fortunately was the carbonara), and a scoop of gelato (which was cherry napoletano.

I'm sure the service and food were great since I wanted bring my friend here for her birthday.\n\nWe made reservations in advance since it was for a special occasion.\n\nThe server was a little slow to seat us, but after a short wait we were shown to our table.\n\nAfter deciding what to order, we looked around for our server but he was no where to be found. We asked another server to find him for us but she instead said that she would help us (the best thing that happened to us that night). She was very friendly and made great suggestions for our appetizers.\n\nFor our menu:\n\nAppetizers - polenta w/ gorgonzola, brussels sprouts w/ panchetta and lemon zest\n\nVery delicious. Polenta was crispy yet very soft on the inside. It was even tastier since it was given to us on the house. =) The brussels sprouts were cooked very well and you could taste a hint of the lemon at the end.\n\nMain entrees - gnocchi w/ italian sausage, squid ink risotto, and fish special of the night (trout with spinach)\n\nGnocchi was nice a soft and the sauce was rich and delicious. The squid ink risotto was slightly too salty for my taste and the dark ink made it hard to see what I was eating, but the dish had a lot of fresh mussels and clams. The trout was very meaty and succulent. The skin on the outside was nice and crispy which gave it a nice balance. The spinach had great flavor as well.\n\nSince it was my friend's birthday, the servers brought a special dessert which was a platter with tiramisu, fresh strawberries, and panna cotta. The tiramisu was very moist and delicious. The panna cotta was smooth and creamy. The strawberries were a nice touch as well.\n\nAll in all, the food was great. The service was excellent (minus the hiccup in the beginning). I would come here again for the good, but the service made the meal that much better.

We showed up on time for our reservation, and she told us our table would be ready in \"two minutes\" and shooed us out the door. We ended up waiting 20, and when we finally sat down, she started to take away our wine glasses because she assumed we were underage. I guess it could've been flattering since we're all well over 21, but she did it without asking and was kind of rude when we stopped her. We ordered the house white, which came in a carafe, and the same hostess later tried to take the wine from our table when it was still 1/3 full because she \"thought it was water.\"\n\nService was slow. Took a while for us to get water, to order, and for our appetizer to come. The bruschetta was pretty good, but the gnocchi verdi I ordered for my entree was overcooked, lukewarm and incredibly salty. They seemed kind of understaffed that night, but I don't think that excuses the hostess's attitude or serving pasta that tastes like it came from a TV dinner.", "author": "C L."}

Secondly, they sold out of every red bottle of wine under $35, and told us, the kitchen was slammed so we might want to order an appetizer to hold us over.  We didnt, but our food literally came 10 minutes later. \n\nSpeed wasnt the problem.  THe gnocchi was too soft and salty, was a 1 star dish.  The Ragu was a 2 star dish, not to be mean, but it kind of tasted as if they used Ragu... and i had the sausage and portabella mushroom pasta. Mine was the best, but a 3.5 star at best.  Each of these dishes was $16.95.\n\nThe only nice thing they did was provide us with a free (tiny) appetizer and a small dessert to share.

We ordered the following:\n\nENTREE: \n*Butternut Squash Ravioli\n*Carbonara- Pasta of the day with crispy Pancetta\n*Acqua Pazza-Pan seared Tilapia\n*Squid ink Risotto di Seppia - it does take a while as they forewarn \n\nDESSERT:\nRicotta Tart with Strawberries\nTiramisu\nZabaione- custard with berries topped with amaretti cookies\n\nThe Ravioli was definitely full of flavor...  However one thing that we couldn't deal with was the oily texture of the ravioli...\n\nThe Carbonara was a bit on the chewy side for my friend however I enjoyed it a bit more than they did so I suppose it's a hit or miss based on personal taste.\n\nThe Acqua Pazza was by far our favorite dish and thankfully the entree ordered by our birthday girl! Everyone gave it rave reviews however could have been that much better if it had some pasta my friend recommended but definitely still great! \n\nThe Squid ink Risotto di Seppia was ok at best but a bit on the salty side for my friend... We understand it's part of the deal you get with squid ink but I've had this before and it wasn't as salty.\n\nThe dessert was a nice touch for our birthday girl as each had their own good (not amazing) qualities except for the tiramisu... Now that was delicious! \n\nOverall I'd have to rate this place a 3.5 stars but seeing that my only options are between  3 or 4 stars I would then have to choose 3 stars...

So many that I assumed that I'd Yelped it already. But somehow, it slipped through the cracks, so here goes:\n\nDark and cozy, the dining room accommodates small and large parties alike, despite it's small interior. I was able to book a table for 9 on Open Table; do you know how difficult that is to do? Most restaurants this size won't let you book anything larger than 6. \n\nService is always attentive and pleasant. When we first started coming here, they weren't that kid friendly. We had to make do with a stack of tablecloths for a high chair. These days, I don't need a high chair, but they broke out the crayons and activity sheets which I was surprised to see. They also offer pasta with marinara sauce or butter to appeal to kids' simpler tastes, along with stuffed pasta selections on their bambini menu. And there's always their solid spaghetti and meatballs. \n\nOn this last visit, we were celebrating a special occasion, so the fam was out en masse. Hands down the most outstanding, must-have dishes were the braised pork (cooked for hours) red sauce (I apologize that I don't remember the exact name) and the squid ink risotto or linguini offerings. So beautiful and flavorful...mmmmmm :D \n\nThe desserts are fine...nothing to write home about. I just like coming here, because it's comfortable, unassuming, and relaxing.

It's cold, white, and reminded me a lot of Iron Kids with a thicker crust.\n\nI got some kind of sampler pasta type thing, that included the gnocchi (which I typically love) and two other types. First, the portions were TINY. Probably 3-4 pieces of each kind of pasta. The gnocchi was so mushy and doughy that it wasn't edible.

We were greeted by friendly staff on our way in, but our table was not ready. There was barely any room to stand, so we were sent to the grungy bar next door for over 20 minutes (when we were told 10) to wait until they came over to get us. I was not too thrilled about this part, but we did get to play some skee ball in there while we waited. That was fun. Anyway, when the server finally brought us back in, we waited a bit more at a tiny bar in the back until we were finally seated. The waiting was a bit annoying, but the service was excellent otherwise. While looking through the menu, we were given complimentary cheese-stuffed mushrooms, which were delicious. Then we had bread with sundried tomato oil (SO GOOD) while waiting for our dishes. For the appetizer, we had the parmigiana (eggplant with melted mozzarella and tomato sauce), since they were not serving the bruschetta, but it was still very good. For the main dishes we ordered the carbonara and funghi risotto-- both were delicious. I think that risotto might just have been the best risotto I've ever had. The extra 25 minute wait was worth it! We were too full for dessert, but they gave us a complimentary blueberry panna cotta, which was the perfect amount for us and it was really yummy. This was a very nice date spot-- dim lighting, candlelit tables, excellent service, great food. The only complaint I have, which I also noticed in other reviews, is that they need better time management with their reservations.

We had a party of about 12-15, so certain expectations were naturally lowered.  The food was clean and tasty, and service was perfectly adequate for our experience.  Towards the end, it did feel like we were getting rushed a bit, but it was understandable since, with another large party in the back, they probably wanted to turn over the tables.\n\nThe second time I was here though went significantly worse than the first.  Since we only had a party of six, I thought their service would have been better given our party was half the size as before.  However, it was a total miss.  After we had ordered, it took what seemed like an eternity for the first few plates to show up.  We then waited another 5-10 minutes before asking where the rest of the dishes were.  The waiter promptly disappeared into the kitchen to check on them, and reappeared with plates in hand....for the table right next to us.  We were then informed that they had already been served to us...which was news to the half of us that were now chewing on our napkins in starvation.  Sadly, when our dishes were finally brought out, the plates were barely warm.  It's unfortunate that the service was a miss on this night, since the food portion didn't disappoint.\n\nSeeing all of those more positive reviews makes me feel like it just might have been an off night and that I should give them another chance.

We started out with their version of a \"negroni\" and it was tart and refreshing. We shared the beef carpaccio, warm spinach salad and mushroom and polenta with gorgonzola. They were all delicious and on point. The spinach salad had a nice balance of citrus and olive oil and was my fav. For dinner we had the special, pappardelle with pesto and shrimp and it was yum. We also had the pork osso bucco and it was served over fettuccine. It was creamy and good. The other girls had gnocchi and rigatoni with San marzano sauce and sausage. All dishes were tasty, and the pesto dish was my fav. We end our dinner with fresh brewed coffee and biscotti and vanilla affogato (not sure if I spelled it right but it was tasty). The service was perfect. This is a small neighborhood type venue. My only negative comment is that after we paid our bill we felt rushed and it did not appear that anyone was waiting for our table. We did stay for a couple of hours,  we did spend $200 so I am not sure what the hurry was.", "author": "Margo J."}

It was a great break to get some good Italian food. I had the tomato cream sauce rigatoni with italian sausage, and the sauce was absolutely perfect. Not too heavy, and perfectly tomato-y, like a thicker creamy tomato basil soup. My friend had the gruyere polenta, but the cheese flavor was a little bit too empowering for me. If you're all for the gruyere, then it's a good choice because it comes with a mushroom sauce, which was pretty complimentary. The pork ragu with gnocchi was a bit sweet, and the mushroom/chicken rigatoni was a bit too oily. My plate was my favorite. =) \n\nTo top things off, the service was GREAT, and dessert was divine. The panna cotta was so light (tasted like a realllly light, rich creme brulee), and the strawberry syrup was tangy and sweet. YUM. I'd go back just for the dessert. \n\nThe sundried tomato/olive oil/bread service is also delicious - the softest bread ever. I will definitely be back.", "author": "Lillian K."}

I don't know if we went on an off day, but all the food fell short of the mark.\n\nThe place has a cozy, romantic feel to it, and the complimentary bread is soft and buttery... but sadly, that about summarizes all the positives.\n\nWow, where to start? I don't want to bash the place, but I have to be honest about my experience. Service was friendly enough, but the pacing of the food was horribly off. A 20 minute wait in between our appetizers and entrees, as well as between entrees and presentation of dessert menu is unforgivable.\n\nBut, onto the food itself:\n- La polenta di bella (shitake mushroom and gorgonzola over polenta): overly salty and mushy to the point where all textures were lost.\n- Eggplant parmiggiana: solid, but overly salty.\n- a wheat spaghetti dish with mushrooms: very average and forgettable; overly salty.\n- a tomato sauce-based penne pasta dish with sausage: tasty, but salty; this dish came out cold.\n- veal dish with cheese, mushrooms, and wine sauce: the sauce was pretty nice, but the veal itself was dry (how do you dry out veal, especially a thin slice like what was served to us??)\n- Sugo di Abbacchio (spinach gnocchi with lamb ragu sauce): I am a HUGE gnocchi fan, and was very disappointed with the dish I had. The ragu was flavorful (but like everything else, overly salty) and rich, but the gnocchi was overcooked to mushiness - very unappetizing!\n\nThey offered our table (and a few others around us) free dessert for our inconvenience, which was a nice touch. The desserts were nice, and more enjoyable than the actual meal itself.\n\nWith so many other choices for Italian, even in the Richmond district, I can't see myself returning to this place...", "author": "Steve L."}

Dining around older couples and even families with newborns made it feel quite calming and comfortable. From the food to service, the experience at Bella was warm and memorable.  \n\nThe wait was a little long even though we made reservations and the food also took some time but the manager, knowing this, apologized and treated us to a very refreshing bruschetta. This along with the bread and sun-dried tomato olive oil did the trick until the entrees. The handmade pastas were quite a hit. The butternut squash ravioli tasted like a savory pumpkin pie with great kick of sage butter. My pasta Carbonara was eggy and velvetty with tad bits of salty fat in the Pancetta. I also tried the veal cutlet which was covered in a mushroom cream sauce. The veal meat itself was a little overcooked and a little tough but the sauce was awesome. \n\nTo wrap up the manager gave us a mini portion of the Tiramisu and again reiterated his apologies for the delay.

Easily located on the corner of Geary and 3rd, it was surprisingly next to Buckshot which I used to frequent when I was in the mood for cheap PBR and greasy fried bar food. Before even entering, the kind host opened the door and greeted the boyfriend and myself. We were seated immediately which made it seem reservations may have been unnecessary considering it was a Monday night. \n\nTogether the bf and I had ordered the house red and white wine, the bone marrow appetizer, the prawn linguine and the gnocchi with sausage. Because our bone marrow would take a while, the waiter generously gave us some bruschetta to nibble on. When we received the bone marrow, we found it perfectly seasoned and incredibly delectable. If I were to have an appetizer before I die, this would be it. Creamy, fatty and perfectly seasoned. It was accompanied with toast and a parsley and caper salad. Yum. When we got our entrees soon after we found that the gnocchi was as soft as pillows that melted in your mouth, and my linguine had a wonderfully mild sauce that I wasn't used to having for a seafood pasta. Too bad we were already filled up by the time our entrees came. We thought we were going to pass on dessert, but the waiter ended up bringing us a complimentary panna cotta.

They were both really good too!  The butternut squash was surprisingly sweet, almost like a dessert and there's really nothing else I can say about the Lobster besides, just do it.  We ended the night by ordering a tiramisu, and they were nice enough to give us a sample of two other desserts there were on the menu for the night.  Awesome!\n\nGreat recommendations with the wine to go with our dishes and consistently good food.  I'll definitely be back again.", "author": "Tom Y."}

I looked online at their menu and found they had a tuna puttanesca. Perfect! My husband and I quickly made a reservation and headed over. When we looked at the menu it turns out that the puttanesca was not on the menu anymore and all of the other options contained dairy. So I had to be a pain and ask for another option.

The Gnocci melted into my mouth, the cream was just right, and there was a hint of peppercorn with each bite.

Glad we did.  \n\nWhat we ate:\nAfter we ordered our appetizers, we were served this most amazing bite I've ever tasted; Fried Polenta cube!  The parmesan sprinkled atop infused  wonderfully into the piping hot crispy fried crust.\nThe Tomato Soup was good and the Antipasto dish was ok.\nThe real star of the evening was the Squid Ink Risotto (due to the amount of time it takes to prepare, it's only served Sunday through Thursday).  For the other dish, we had the Gnocchi and Sausage with Tomato Sauce (they have a spinach one in a cream-based sauce).  To my disappointment, the gnocchi was rather mush and overdone (probably b/c they worked to bring out the two dishes at the same time, but to the detriment of the gnocchi dish).\nAlthough we were too full and passed on dessert, they brought out the strawberry panna cotta which was light & fluffy and a great ending to the meal.\nGood wine selections.\n\nWhere we ate (well, yeah, at the restaurant, but...):\nFrom the light-yellow painted exterior to the small entrance, this cute corner restaurant invites those seeking a cozy environment.  The dimly lit and quiet ambiance makes for a worthy choice place to enjoy a set selection of food.  Perfect for dates, good for smaller gathering, and apparently they host group dinner as well...\nI simply adore the vibe and setting of this restaurant!\n\nRegrettably, the gnocchi experience was disappointing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-15", "description": "After eating here, my sister and I remarked on why we both like living in San Francisco: even in a densely Asian neighborhood like the Inner Richmond, some crazy person is going to try to open a slightly rustic, slightly casual, slightly nice Italian joint that has all the makings of a regular weekend dinner spot. It's not exactly tucked away, but Bella Trattoria is definitely not what you expect when you go down Geary into the avenues for food.\n\nNow, this isn't the BEST Italian food out there. But it's pretty darn good. Our meal started with bread and their house-made olive oil, infused with sun dried tomatoes. The bread was a little starchy and too similar to white bread for my liking, but my sister is a carb-o-maniac so it suited her just fine. I wasn't crazy about the oil either, but I did appreciate somebody trying to make bread and oil a little more special than it usually is. Miniature fried polenta bites followed and while interesting exercises in texture, they weren't anything remarkable. Our veal carpaccio was sliced superbly thin (I could actually see the plate underneath!) and the seasoning was just right.\n\nEntree-wise, this place tends towards the homey sort of Italian food that, every now and then, you just simply crave. Let's get one thing straight: this is no Incanto or Delfina. But that wasn't what we came here for anyway, so it hardly mattered. My spinach gnocchi were wonderfully light and in a rich (but not overly heavy) b\u00e9chamel while my sister's risotto was a little drier than she or I like it, but that did little to make it less delicious or enjoyable. A particular highlight for me was the vermouth cocktails that the house treats as their specialty drinks. I got the \"Il Ginger\" (dry vermouth, a touch of sugar, ginger ale, and a muddled lime) that was delicious, refreshing, and was great in cutting the creaminess of my gnocchi.\n\nBut if there's one thing I like about this place, it's the service. Too often, we're used to either having our waiters slavishly wait over us or go the do-it-yourself route. However, I can say that I never felt like my needs were left unattended or that someone wasn't making sure that we didn't have enough parmigiana on our plates or water in our glasses. The service with a smile and the copious free appetizers and desserts were more than enough to win me over. Eating well doesn't necessarily mean spending money, you know. Sometimes it's just about a tasty plate of pasta and a person smiling while they pour you a cocktail.", "author": "Marcus L."}

I needed the place to be quiet enough to talk, but the food had to be good, too.\n\nI was impressed.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite lovely.  Dimly lit, it is the perfect date restaurant.  The location leaves a bit to be desired as it's neither here nor there - and parking was a nightmare here if you absolutely do not like walking, like me - but other than that - no biggie.\n\nWe had brought our own wine, and I believe corkage was a reasonable $15 or $20 dollars.  They do, however, serve wine glasses made of glass, not crystal... bit of a downer when it comes to great wine.\n\nThe bread was good, and on this evening, we ordered the baked polenta w/ gorgonzola cheese and shitake mushrooms as an appetizer to share.  \n\nTHAT WAS ONE FINE DISH.\nThoughts of canceling my entree and ordering two more of these entered my mind.\nNo joke, I could eat at least three orders of this!  I tend to like polenta, but dare I say it - it was the best polenta I have had to date, with the perfect mixture of the cheese, and the mushrooms steered the dish straight into \"BEST EVER\" category.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered lasagna and the tagliatelle w/ chicken and mushroom, accompanied by a nice creamy sauce.  The lasagna was underwhelming - something about it just wasn't hitting high notes with me, but the tagliatelle was VERY good.\n\nTo my understanding - I truly missed out on this last visit because everyone has been telling me that I should have ordered the gnocchi here.  Not being a huge fan of gnocchi (probably because I never find a place that makes good gnocchi) - I am not determined to go back and try it.\n\nWe scanned the dessert menu but decided to pass.  Our server took our menus away and then brought us a dessert on the house anyway - a panna cotta!\n\nService was friendly - and bordered on a bit too attentive where our conversation was repeatedly interrupted.

This place provided one of the better dining experiences I have had in San Fran (and that says alot in the fine dining capital of the west)\n\nAhh Bella, the carpaccio (tenato vernatto?) had just the right mix of flavor and aesthetic appeal - like a Fellini film, haha.  I had the salmon with gluten-free penne pasta - a tasty dish without the gluten-guilt, a win-win!\n\nThe service was excellent, but to be fair, we got there early (7pm) on a Monday night, so the place wasn't very busy.  But I will give the Bella staff the benefit of the doubt and note that our table was constantly monitored by the staff (multiple refills on drinks, etc.) and they seemed genuinely concerned about our patronage - excellent work!\n\nI will definitely return to Bella, I just hope that things don't change during my return visit!", "author": "M P."}

The most notable differences: the price, the quantity, and the quality. \n\nMy uncle was in the bay area, so we decided to take him here for authentic Italian food. I made the reservation on yelp at 7 PM, and when we got there, the place was full and had a line going out the door. The place, at first glance, is at the corner of Geary and 3rd and is quite easy to miss if it wasn't for the yellow walls outside, since it had no clear sign in the front. The interior was cozy and intimate, despite the servers rushing around everywhere. We were seated as soon as our whole party arrived (they won't give you a table until everyone is present). And if you don't know your food terms, you're gonna have a hard time navigating through the menu, but if you ask the waiter, they'll explain to you how they make each dish. \n\nTo start off, we were served some bread and oil to dip it in, and man, that was the best bruschetta I've ever tasted! The sundried tomatoes in the oil was so flavorful and tangy, and the bread was light and soaked the oil right up. I ended up getting the Butter Nut Squash Ravioli as my entree, which was a sweet dish. Even though the dishes are pricey (the cheapest started at 14 dollars and went up to 28), it's totally worth it, considering the taste and the artsmanship of the dish. The butter nut squash ravioli had the perfect blend of flavors: the caramelized sugar went perfectly with the smooth texture of the pasta used to fill the creamy yet light butter squash filling, with the sundries tomatoes adding a slight tang of acidity. I would definitely recommend that dish, because everytime I think of that dish, I start to feel hungry again! I also got to taste the squid ink risotto, the Gorgonzola steak, and the spaghetti with the spicy meat (forgot the name of it) and they were all on point and delicious! It also doesn't hurt that they gave us free dessert at the end! I think they switch up their desserts, because we got the Panna Cotta, which was oh-so-light and creamy and delicious! \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for a date or any special occasion, since it is more expensive than typical Italian restaurants. The only reason why I gave this place four stars was because the service was definitely lacking. I'm not sure if they're understaffed or just too busy, but I felt like the slow service distracted me from truly enjoying my dining experience. Several times, I had to persistently flag down the waiter, and when they finally came, they were impatient and terse.", "author": "Kristi L."}

It was just a little too oily.\n\nI got the salad (as usual) and it was good (as usual) but they gave so much I just couldn't finish it all (not that I'm complaining)!!  I tried the rigatoni pasta with tomato, Italian sausage and cream sugo (unfortunately I can't remember the Italian name for it).  It was really good.  The sauce was light, but really tasty!  My friend had the steak, which he also said was really good and cooked to perfection.  \n\nOnce again, they gave us the fried polenta and panna cotta on the house and this time they also gave us a drink to enjoy.  I'm not sure what it was, but I could have drank wayyy more of that stuff!\n\nIn total, my friend and I had three courses each and our bill was only $60.

We were SO looking forward to trying their pastas and lobster ravioli, so we decided to try it for valentines day.\n\nI thought I had everything planned out, it was going to be perfect.\nAfter looking at their online menu, which said that there was going to be a prix fixe menu for valentines day, but it did not say it was the only thing we could order.  So i still wanted to go, but order from the regular menu that sounded way more appetizing than the fixed meal.  Which said it was $70/couple.  ONLINE it did, and i just thought it wasnt worth it.\n\nSo i made reservations.  They needed my creditcard number so that we wouldnt just not show up. They were going to charge you a fee if you didnt show.\n\nWe got there, and the waiting section of this place was outside, in the cold on these couches..When we were seated, we were sitting WAY too close to the other tables to even feel comfortable talking.  So when one table left, we moved our table over, and it became wobbly!\n\nAll that aside, we DID have to order from the prix fix menu.......which did not have anything we liked, and now it says its $70/PERSON.  I went online on my iphone, knowing it said $70/couple before, but the menu was taken down from their site already..\n\nSo, do we leave? But they have my creditcard down..were they going to charge me?  Do we leave? Or eat food we dont want to order? Shit.  Already a bad start.  So we stayed.\n\nWe started out with some wine on the house, because he said it was Chinese New Year, and that we should start out our meal with something sweet..that was pretty good.  Like grape soda with a hint of wine.  \n\nBread and olive oil with sun dried tomatoes, was the best thing we had here all night.\n\nNext a \"little treat from the kitchen\" polenta with some kind of ricotta and swiss cheese over it.  it was okay.\n\nGazpacho soup shots, OMGGGGG these were horrible.  Ive had gazpacho before and i liked it, but these...blah.  Tomato was way too salty, while the asparagus just tasted weird.  I forced hon to down the rest, because they were costing us at least $20.  Thank the lord they were only shots.\n\nOh, did i mention, even though it is prix fixe you cannot mix and match, there were choices, but we both must get the same thing and share it.\n\nCalamari salad was next.  Sounds simple and good, but nope.  Calamaris were soggy and mushy in texture.....wtheck mixed in a weird salty, soury sauce with oranges and olives..not my cup of mushy sauce drowned salad.\n\nMain course, Surf and Turf.  Skirt steak and \"prawns\" no.......those were shrimps...dont call them prawns when theyre not.  At least this item was fairly good.  The steak was raw and tender, and the amount of sauce was perfect.  The shrimp was okay.  We would have liked a little bit more of this please. Skip the rest.\n\nDessert, panna cotta, which cant be bad, and this other rum custard which had TOO much rum to be good, it was so bitter.  A bitter dessert?!\n\nTook the check an hour to come, when we desperately wanted to leave..i was seriously thinking about just leaving if it didnt come, but again, they had my creditcard number down. UGH. prior to this, we were going to pick up a wii to play with at home for the rest of valentines day, but the meal took all of our money to buy one that night.  We didnt feel like it anymore.\n\n$153 + tip, you do the math.  When I couldve ordered their Lobster ravioli, and been happy for $20. I dont mind spending the money, but lets be fair, was that really worth $70/person?  I couldve dined at Ruth Chris, or HOPR or fly to visit my friend in Michigan with that.. i will go cry now.", "author": "kim w."}

I liked that there was space between the tables - it seems a lot of places pack you in and then you spend the rest of dinner ducking and moving your chair - not an issue at all.   Complimentary bread and oil with sundried tomatoes - BF loved the bread, but I kinda wished it was warmed up and maybe a little crustier or rustic.    \nWe started with a salad (a version of a Caesar, but called something else...) and BF had the minestrone soup.  We shared a bit, but mostly hoarded our own tasty dishes.    BF had the gnocchi and I had the trout special with sauteed spinach.    I was very satisfied - I was able to mostly stick to my food plan and BF was able to indulge - he left feeling stuffed, something I try to avoid.  Again, we shared a bit, but stood greedily by our choices. \n\nThe service was great - attentive but not lingering.   They offered us dessert and we declined, but were treated to a mascarpone and strawberry dessert that let us know that next time, we need to leave room. \n\nA good spot for either a group of people or a romantic date place.", "author": "Maria C."}

After reading all the good reviews on Yelp for this place, we decided to give this place a try and have since been their twice now.\n\nFirst experience, we came in on a Saturday evening round 6 and were surprised to see the place deserted. The staff was super nice and friendly and they got us started with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious and in addition to their standard complimentary warm bread and olive oil and sundried tomato. \n\nI gave their  Norcina pasta a go (Italian sausage, portabello, porcini cream sugo, and pecorini romano). The bf had some veal deal that came with a side of fried potato sticks and sauteed spinach. Everything was amazingly delicious and the portions were super hardy (had to pack half of pasta to go, even as left overs it was yummy!). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/msT3LrLB4fhN04HYHuFsew?select=uqDQ0ymGDwUj1wSK71RZxw\n\nAfter stuffing our selves silly with the oh-so-good Italian grub, we had to decline the waiter's offer for desert (although we were seriously tempted after having a look at the desert menu). Although we declined and looked like we were aboutt o pass out from food coma, the waiter brought us their panna cotta di marscapone topped with fresh strawberries on the freakin house! Two complimentary dishes in one sitting? OUTRAGEOUS, but totally OUTSTANDING, free shit? Hell yeah, can I give them a bonus star? \n\nOk, second experience tonight was just as fantastic. We came in round 7, place was getting pretty packed (very happy to see that since they were deserted the first time) , we didnt have reservations, but that was no problem, they got some things sorted out and seated us within 5 minutes. Here's what we ordered tonight:\n\n1. For refreshments: Bellini- prosecco with peach pur\u00e9e- tasted like alcoholic Oringina! My god, if they served this up at bars, I'd be getting myself into much trouble.\n2. For starters: Nzalata romana with garlic anchovy dressing (caeser salad which was ok) and  Venato tonnato ( venison with tuna alioli sweet roasted peppers and pecorino) The venison was delicious but almost over powered by lemon flavor in the sauce on top.\n3. For main course: Agnolotti (pork shoulder ravioli pancetta green peas pork brodo)- delicious! Very fresh light pasta perfectly cooked  flavored really well by the pork brodo. The bf ordered the Valdostana (baked veal cutlet with  fontina and wild mushroom sugo with a side of   fried potato sticks and sauteed spinach)- oh my god, so fucking yummy, that's all I gotta say.\n4. To hit the sweet spot: Panna cotta- cooked mascapone topped with strawberries. This was complimentary from a Yelp Check In offer they had, just checked in on my new iPhone, and a coupon popped up  (again free shit, hell yeah, sign me up). Haha, I don't know if it was the manager or what, but one of the staffers came to our table to congratulate us on our check in, we were the first ones to use the coupon, we were all very excited!\n\nAll in all, one of the best places to come for free shit.... I mean, their fantastic customer service and super yummy Italian fare.", "author": "Pauline T."}

We decided that we have to try brushetta and carpaccio since my girl loves beef capaccio. We waited about 10 minutes for the server to come to our table. In the mean time a busser arrive with water. While he is akwardly smiling at my girlfriend and staring her breasts but I said to my self \"come on he wouldn't do that\". I didn't say anything, but our friend start to laugh because she saw exactly what I saw. \n\nI said to my self, \"calm down and just enjoy your meal\". Because I want to get up and do things to him that he can only see in his wildest nightmares. \n\nFinally our server arrives. We gave our appetizer orders which are bruschetta, beef carpaccio, tuna carpaccio and two more things that I can't remember. Also we gave our main course orders as well.\n\nI kid you not, after two glasses of wine, a 45 minutes wait I got up from my seat to ask him for an another glass of wine and if our appetizers are coming. His respond was \"yeah\". Yeah? 45 minutes of wait and your answer is \"yeah\"? By the way there is only 8 tables dining  at the restaurant. \n\nAnway after another 15 minutes our \"fried something\" appitizer came to the table which was cold. I don't know if that was supposed to be cold, the way it was but it was so small and no taste what so ever. We had no sharing plates. He said he'll be back with the plates but by the time he came back appetizer was finished. He brought the plates then bruschetta, carpaccio's arrive. We fininsh them the last appetizer comes on the table after a another 15 minutes wait. So far we spent 1 hour and 30 minutes. My friend tells him just fire our main courses. Literally, 5 minutes later he says that our main courses were on the table. Oh wait, where is my main course? I waited another 5 minutes for my food. This absoulty nightmare. \n\nHere comes the best part. After he lays my plate, he says sorry for the little delay!!!!!! Little delay? I got my main course in 1 hour and 45 minutes. \n\nBy the way the table next to us arrive 15 minutes after us when we were having our desserts he was still waiting his meal even though his party finish their meals.\n\nI don't know what's going on at that restaurant but either fire all your staff or closed down your business because that was the worst $ I spent ever at a restaurant.\n\nSome of the dishes were good but I don't bother to go into this because there is absouletly no way I can this torture one more time.\nDO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!", "author": "Refet T."}

We arrived for our reservation at 7pm about 10 mins early and was seated by our host right away.  The restaurant is much smaller inside then it seemed from outside and has a nice intimate feel.  \n\nFrom all the positive reviews, the gf and I was expecting the restaurant to be crowded but thought it was a lil weird that the place was nearly empty when we first arrived.  I'm usually a low carb dieter so it's not often that I go out for pasta but one of the things that I always look forward to most at Italian restaurants is the complimentary bread!  I already knew that coming to an Italian restaurant was basically death for my low carb diet but I pre-emtively  decided that I was going to eat carbs to my hearts desire that night. Muahaha.....time to get fat =)    \n\nSadly I was disappointed by the bread.  I absolutely love warm, crusty bread with butter or olive oil but the bread at Bella Trattoria is cold and uninspiring.  The olive oil they provided us was infused with tomato which was interesting but I tend to like the zing that balsamic vinegar adds.  The menu was pretty small, making it easy to choose an entree.  I decided on their Frutti di Mare while the gf got their smoked salmon pasta with black caviar.   The presentation of our plates were nice however I thought the portions were a little small.  I guess I'm used to seeing the portions at Italian places like Buca Di Beppo and was wondering if the pasta was going to be enough for the gf and I.  The Frutti di Mare was decent.  The pasta was nice and al dente and the flavors were nice however they could have been more generous with the seafood.  The smoked salmon pasta was also just okay.  The smoked salmon added a nice salty, smokey flavor to the dish and the black caviar added additional texture to the pasta which was nice.  However the pasta cream sauce was too rich and dense.  \n\nFood - 3 Stars\n\nService - The service would have been 2 stars because our waiter was never around but they gave us a complimentary dessert so 3 stars for service.  \n\nOverall, I would say this place is okay but I don't think I'll be coming back.

What's not to like?\n\nCame here on a whim last night, late-night-style. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly. I ordered the squid-ink seafood linguine, fiance ordered tomato soup and veggie lasagna. Delish! \n\nThey gave us bread with olive oil and sundried tomatoes. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread since it reminded me of overly soft white Wonder bread instead of the nice, crusty stuff you find at Acme. No matter, everything else was great. \n\nAt the end of the meal, we passed on dessert since we were stuffed but they were so sweet and gave us a panna cotta with strawberry puree on the house! I really enjoyed my meal here and felt like the staff treated like us like we'd been going there for 10 years, they were so nice! Highly recommend.", "author": "Jen P."}

I order it every time I eat at an Italian restaurant. Bella Trattoria on Geary makes THEE BEST gnocchi I have ever eaten. \n\nI ordered the green spinach gnocchi with mushrooms and a delish, albeit SUPER RICH cream sauce. They also offer a regular gnocchi with a pork sauce that I will be back to try asap. The gnocchi itself was homemade, hot, fresh and omg-- chew-free. Yes. It melted in my mouth. No teeth required. That's how I score all of my food btw ;)\n\nBut seriously-- great gnocchi. Wonderfully hot, homemade bread. Homey feel. Good desserts. Within a short walk from my house.

I hadn't been back in years and just tried it again recently.\n\nIt's okay. I won't say the quality is terrible, but it's also not particularly good, especially for the price. The bread is god-awful. The appetizers okay. The pasta also just good (not amazing). The dessert absolutely delicious.\n\nSo if you don't mind paying $17 or $18 for an okay to good pasta plate (as opposed to an amazing plate), go here. Otherwise, you can get much better pasta for cheaper at L'osteria del Forno. Unfortunately, that's in North Beach. Not much great Italian food in the Richmond.", "author": "Al Y."}

We also like its atmosphere and the bruschetta. But we were a little underwhelmed by the pasta dishes. We ordered the squid ink pasta and the clam linguine. We were expecting the squid ink pasta to have a wonderful squid ink sauce, but it turned out to be a black squid-ink pasta in a tomato-based sauce. It was still tasty, but since we love an authentic squid ink sauce so much, and have tried wonderful pasta in a squid-ink sauce, we were disappointed. The clam linguine was good, but nothing spectacular, just like any other good clam linguine I've tried in other lower grade restaurants. So I think it was a little overpriced. We were also expecting a great tiramisu, but it was only so so. I think it wasn't creamy and rich enough, and probably needed a little more sugar.", "author": "Clara L."}

Coming in from Oakland it seemed pretty distant however the little sweet corner Bella Trattoria has found a new fan in me.  The decor is dark and modest, with a mural on the wall where our family group sat.  The service was silent and perfect, as though we were surrounded by two soft-footed people in Harry Potter's invisibility cloak: they were present but did not make their presences prominent as the party evolved.  Amazing.  No one missed a beat, and the meals were remembered by our server to a person.  We enjoyed a variety of meals, from the Tri pasta, eggplant, and the butternut squash ravioli, caesar salads, spinach salads, bruschetta which was perfect, and squid and mussels.  Desserts included ricotta tart with strawberries, tiramisu and gelato.  Our group, from the ages of 22 up to 89, thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  \nAm I raving about the Trattoria? Yes I am.  Even though I am moving to LA and occasionally visit my family in SF, will I return? Oh yes.\nCheck it out, for you will find it a very delightful experience.

I've eaten and I can't get up!\"\n\nSo I was like, \"Hey honey let's do a date night\" \nAnd he was like, \"sure how about Italian\" \nThen I'm all, \"but I want something new and romantic\"\nAnd he was like \"......?\" \nAnd I was all, \"check this place out on Yelp\" \n\nThat was only the beginning. Yes I love food. In fact, I can't go a day without it. Being that I can cook and people will actually swallow with a smile, I want more when I go out to eat.  And when it comes to eating out on date night, there are certain things I expect. \n\n1) Service: great service! In fact, we called the waiter over to taste our \"no corkage fee\" wine. (Little did we know our waiter was the owner-Doh!)\n\n2) Atmosphere: Romantic but not intimidating. Nicely lit, good (non elevator or top 40's) music, not crowded (not too small or large). Very relaxing.  Good for dates and dinner parties but we didn't see any children!! +++ (yes, + means good thing) \n\n3)  Location: VERY close to the bus line, but we actually find parking too around there. (Though who wants to with they ability to drink so much wine!) \n\n4) Very reasonable for an Italian night out. \n\nFOOD\n\nAppetizers\n1) Beef and Tuna Carpaccio-Incredibly thin slices that melt in your mouth. \n\n2) Polenta- Soooo I USUALLY don't like polenta. THIS however was SUPER yum yum with the gorgonzola. (See my caps? That was to stress my point) \n\n3) Bruschetta: Ok so normally I wouldn't bother with adding bread to my meal because even though I may be the size of a bird, I prefer to peck at less expanding foods, BUT (yup, caps again) my husband loves it. We ate it. And then I ate more of it. And more. And now you are starting to see the beginning....\n\nPASTA\nGnocchi -The most melt in your mouth gnocchi I have ever had. At first I was a little weary, but then I couldn't stop eating it. Now I crave that creamy texture in my mouth. (Stop it you perverts!) \n\nLinguine Nere: \"I'm sorry you want to put what in my pasta?\" -Squid ink. Sounds weird, but tastes great. On the recommendation of David I gave it a shot and was glad I did. It tasted nothing like the pens that use to explode in my mouth after chewing on the ends. (I said pens people, pens) \n\nI don't eat beef or pork so you'll be on your own there, BUT, my husband has liked all his dishes. He's just not around for me to remember what. \n\nDOLCE! \nOK! Here is where it gets fun. I don't normally eat desert simply because I don't like spending the money to stuff myself. (Yup I said it, I am cheap) BUT (There's that but again) most all of these deserts are made in house and they are TO GET FAT FOR.  Yup, I will happily walk out 2 lbs heavier to stick that goodness in my mouth and swallow. Hell! I even ignore the fact that I am scary with dairy and I spoon fight with the hubby even over the ice cream. \n\nSo there you have it. 5 stars for a wonderful night out!", "author": "Kat M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-09-29", "description": "Once upon a time, this used to be my favorite little restaurant in SF. My roommates and I discovered this place way back in 2000. I distinctly remember the welcoming atmosphere, the attentive service, the delicious home-made pasta (pappardelle with rabbit), and just overall great ambiance. We used to always bring our out-of-town guests here for dinner, all along raving about the food, the service, the ambiance...everything. \n\nFast forward to this past weekend...I went to dinner at Bella's with my old roommate. We were so excited to have dinner at our mutually-favorite Italian restaurant. When we walked in, there were several open tables but they asked us to sit at the \"bar\" in the back of restaurant and wait 5 minutes. I use the term \"bar\" loosely as it is set up like a bar with 3 barstools but there is no bartender and apparently you can't order drinks there. At least no one ever asked us if we wanted to order. We waited approximately 10 minutes and then the waiter came to seat us at one of the several empty tables. I wonder why we had to wait? The tables were set when we arrived. Okay not a big deal...so far. \n\nThe olive oil/sun-dried tomatoes arrived but no bread or water....until later. Not a big deal as I can easily overlook this but coupled with what happened the rest of the night...\n\nMoving on, we decided to share a salad...some mixed greens with fennel and orange slices. Is it just me but shouldn't orange sections NOT have the skin/membrane still on them? And there shouldn't be seeds in the slices, right? In any case, when the waiter asked what we thought of the salad, my dinner companion said you know there are seeds in the orange slices. The waiter says (and I kid you not), \"our oranges are natural\" and then he walks away.  Later the waiter comes by and tells us that he's told the chef about the seeds. Um, okay, thanks. \n\nMy dinner companion ordered lasagna and as the waiter puts the plate down on the table, he says \"there are no seeds in that dish. haha\".  My dinner companion is eating his lasagna when all of a sudden, he gets a funny look on his face and he says, the lasagna is COLD in the middle. COLD! And then he says, \"look\"...lifts up his plate and there is a bug crawling around on the table. Ugh.\n\nAt that point, I am done eating but I still have about a third of my pasta left. The waiter comes by and without asking removes my plate. Rude! What if I wanted to take home the leftovers?\n\nThe waiter then asks my friend how his lasagna was and my friend decided to tell him that it was cold. The waiter looked at him like he was lying and says \"cold??!\" and then walks away. After a few minutes, he comes out and says, the chef is sorry about the cold lasagna. he is going to comp your lasagna\". He asks my companion if he would like coffee to which he said no. The waiter walks away without looking at me or asking me if I wanted coffee. \n\nA minute later, the waiter comes back out to drop off some complimentary panna cotta for dessert. I have no idea how the panna cotta was because I refused to eat it. I have no idea if it was a \"special\" panna cotta. As we were getting ready to leave, the waiter comes back, points to the panna cotta and says \"that should be cold\". \n\nAre you kidding me?! How stupid are you?? You reminded us of your mistakes - twice. And never once did you apologize for anything. Average food coupled with a stupid waiter and bad service equals no more for Bella's for us. We have crossed Bella's off our list forever. There are too many other GREAT restaurants in this city for us to waste money on Bella's. We are pretty sad about this as we seriously loved Bella's!

I was looking for ta little Italian place that had gnocchi for a date night and of course came to Yelp to find something.  I just searched: \"best gnocchi\" and this is the restaurant that caught my eye.\n\nI think another reviewer referred to them as pillows and maybe another referred to them as clouds.  Either way I was sold -- and they were right, like pillows made of potato clouds.\n\nSo my girlfriend and I set out for a little trek to Bella from the Mission. We took the 33, stopped along Haight to check out some vintage shops and then arrived for our reservation.  (They book reservations online, so it's a cinch to make a reservation).\n\nWe started with a delicious Anti-pasto plate that included super savory salted cured meats, olives, ingenious rolled and grilled veggies (eggplant and zucchini that was spiced perfectly).\n\nFor dinners we had a gnocchi in a vodka-cream sauce -- very decadent but light at the same time -- and a whole cooked white fish that was breaded and fried.  \n\nBoth dinners were portioned and plated elegantly and the waitress paired great wines with each (can't remember their names).\n\nThe staff was friendly, helpful, and made us both feel comfortable.  Definitely an A+.\n\nI highly recommend Bella for a little get away to the inner Richmond. Perfect after a day in Golden Gate Park, or at the DeYoung, or even vintage shopping on Haight.\n\nThe ambiance is perfect to set lil' bit of that romantic mood while not being staunch or intimidating.

Can't quite put my finger on the taste, but it's a nice change from the norm. \n\nAfter bread + appetizer + dinner + a glass of wine each, we were pretty stuffed and passed on dessert, but our awesome waiter couldn't resist and brought us their panna cotta which was heavenly.

I loved it so much that I opened up a yelp account and made it my first post! \n\nSummary: My boyfriend and I stopped in here for dinner after I saw good Yelp reviews. The ambiance is great, romantic, and quiet without feeling pretentious and stuffy. The staff is attentive and friendly, and the food is fantastic. For the detailed review, read on... :)\n\nThe staff here are so friendly, and the owner was actually our server! \n\nMy bf and I got the bruschetta (DELICIOUS!) as a starter. I had the trio of pasta (penne in pink sauce, gnocchi in marinara, and ravioli with tomato sauce). The ravioli were fantastic! Very delicate. I'm not a big fan of gnocchi, but there gnocchi is spot on. My bf and I commented that it tasted like eating a cloud. Fabulous. My boyfriend actually ordered the pasta with pink sauce and Italian sausage, but really wanted the lobster ravioli special (which he somehow forgot he wanted when the server asked him). I convinced him to order it anyway, in addition to his entree. When we placed the order, the owner was so concerned that we didn't like the penne, we assured him that it was delicious but that we really wanted to try the lobster ravioli. He told us he could do a half order just for us! (So nice of him!). When the lobster ravioli came out, and my boyfriend took the first bite, I think he transcended into nirvana for a short while. He absolutely loved it! We proceeded on to dessert to try panna cotta with strawberries (perfect!) and zabione (delicious!). The zabione tasted delightful, but was a little sweet by the end eating it by myself. The panna cotta was absolutely delicious though. Perfect balance of sweetness, wonderful texture. The staff was really great, took a picture for us, and let us sit on their couches (very comfortable) for awhile to digest. The staff actually asked us if we needed to call a cab since they saw us sitting on the couches.\n\nMy bf and I loved it so much, we went back again for lunch before he flew back to Florida. The owner remembered us and we talked with him for awhile, very nice man. I guess the restaurant has been there for 13 years, 11 with the current owner. My bf ordered the lobster ravioli special again, I had the butternut squash ravioli. We started with the polenta and mushrooms (very tasty, but I preferred the bruschetta) and had the panna cotta again for dessert. \n\nI think there are new owners now, but we went back and it was still delicious! Great spot in inner richmond!\n\nHIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "author": "Caroline D."}

We were looking all over yelp for a good Italian restaurant, and thank goodness that yelp pointed me in this direction earlier on (I actually wanted to go here for my birthday, but decided against it because I was feeling American food then lol). So we arrived at around 5ish and noticed that there weren't any people eating inside, so we were kinda skeptical. Was it really as good as yelp made it out to be?\n\nAnswer: HECK YES. The decor is sleek, modern, romantic, cozy...it was pure awesomeness. I LOVE decor that is woodsy and all of the adjectives described above, so I was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was super nice, really personable, and suggested a bunch of things for us to get. We ended up taking her suggestions. I don't remember exactly what the names of the dishes were, but I know we ordered:\n\nTrout with spinach: The trout was super fresh, however I do remember that the menu said it was boneless, but we encountered a bunch of tiny bones. But then again, trout is like one of those fish that really has a ton of bones in em (tee-hee), so the freshness of the trout made up for it. \n\nSquid ink seafood pasta: I never thought I would like squid ink pasta, ever. But I do now! The noodles were dark/grey, so it was an unusual sight for me (who is used to seeing regular pasta noodles). It was surrounded by a good amount of clams, scallops (I think), and mussels. Overall, good dish.\n\nSalmon with some sort of white sauce: Oh was this one of my FAVORITES. It was a little pricey, but then again it was a salmon dish. There were shreds of salmon over delicate noodles topped with this creamy white sauce that tasted sooooo delishhhhh! It had a very smoky taste to it, something I wasn't used to, but immediately liked. This one rocked!\n\nGnocchi: Everyone said I just HAD to get the gnocchi. And I did! Yumm-o x10000003934882378849397429asksksdjfd haha!!!!!! I LOVE gnocchi, and before I came here, I still hadn't found my gnocchi spot. They offer a generous serving of gnocchi in creamy white bechamel sauce...sooooo delicious! It was melt in your mouth heavenly. Still not as amazing as Casanova's gnocchi back in Monterey, but it comes a really close second (and I will SO not drive all the way out to Monterey for some gnocchi, so I will be more than happy to settle for this yumminess at Bella Trattoria).\n\nPanna Cotta: We told our waitress that it was my brother's birthday, and she said that they could probably fix something up in the back for him. And they did! I didn't know what Panna Cotta was before they served it...still don't really know what it's made out of (as I'm not a hardcore foodie, but love food nonetheless), but it was AMAZING!!!!! Tasted better cuz it was free, but I would have paid for this dessert. It was sooo creamy, but was almost like jello pudding or something, and was topped with a tart jam that was the perfect topping to this dish. It was also the perfect size for one person. We shared it though and all adored it! (Side note: We went to Candy Bar afterwards, and I will just say that this Panna Cotta rules supreme over Candy Bar's too sweet PBJ dessert/Apple a la Mode dessert any freakin' day!!!!)\n\nOh, and how can I forget? We got complimentary fried polenta!!! Oh so yummy!!! Thanks Bella Trattoria for a super yummylicious experience!!! ^.^", "author": "Jaye C."}

It's not like trying to figure out cash flow and profitability in accrual based accounting. Not at all. Ask yourself, \"how would I expect my dining experience to be\" and then provide that level of service. \n\nMy wife and I have avoided Bella for more than 1 year. One evening, while driving home from Oakland, I asked my wife, \"shall we allow redemption?\" I mean, if Vick can get a second chance, I can give one of my local economic producers a second chance.\n\nWell, well, well. It was comical. The service at this place is akin to 12 year olds trying to run a business.

It's like the Italian special olyimpics. \n\nJesus Christ.", "author": "ahern k."}

We had the worst dining experience in any food establishment we've ever been to!  The service was just awful!  We had to wait a long time not only to be seated but for every dish to be served, including bread, appetizers, wine and water!\n\nAs to the specifics of our dining experience, we waited so long to be seated we were really hungry by the time we were at our table so we ordered bruschetta for an appetizer.  It finally came after half an hour.  Fearing a long wait for dinner, we quickly figured out what we wanted and had to work to get the waiter's attention to place our order.  We waited an hour and 15 minutes for dinner to be served!  Our water was never refilled--we had to ask.  Our wine was never refilled--we helped ourselves.  I don't know why we bothered to take a chance on waiting a long time for dessert as well but we ordered Tiramisu when we were able to get their attention and they were out!!!  Dessert was the one thing we didn't have to wait for the entire evening!\n\nThis was about the worst dining experience we've ever had and I'm sorry we went on Valentine's Day!  One thing we noticed was how blatantly friendlier the wait staff seemed to be to large tables with a lot of Italian-looking men and women.  It seems you have to be Italian or look Italian to be served expediently and with courtesy--the usual Italian friendliness as one would expect while in Italy.  Except in Italy, they are friendly to everyone equally.\n\nIn summary, and to be fair, the food was good, not stellar, but pretty good and tasty. The portions were indeed small as posted by other Yelpers.  But unlike some of the raving reviews on service, in our experience as with others, the service was just terrible and needs improvement--at least treat everyone equally--not just those that look Italian!\n\nWe've been to this restaurant twice.  The first time was an average experience--at least the food was good and the service was average the first time--no real complaints about that experience--good enough that we opted to return a second time.  Unfortunately, this second experience was a deal-breaker.\n\nProviding excellent service to every customer equally is obviously not on their list.  If I owned a restaurant, providing excellent customer service would be at the TOP of my list--that's how you get repeat business and free word-of-mouth business from your own customers.  And it has to be excellent service provided equally to ALL customers.\n\nI certainly will not be giving Bella Trattoria my business again...unless I'm with a group of Italians...and even then, I will have to give it a lot of thought.  On second thought, no, I won't be returning to this establishment, period.  There are plenty of great Italian restaurants in San Francisco with better food and excellent service worth spending your money on.", "author": "Elle D."}

I like the spinach gnocchi - because it makes me feel as if I'm eating a little bit healthier, even though the creamy sauce is just filled with fattiness :)\n\nThe Butternut Squash Ravioli is another all-time favorite. The pasta skin is light and delicate, and the filling is just sooo good. With the brown suger, sage, and pine nuts, it's heavenly. Unfortunately, they skimp on the portions a bit here.

They also have a good lemoncello (that the owner raves about...\"it comes straight from Italy, blahblah\")\n\nI adore this place, but the service can be inconsistent.

This is a small - medium size restaurant with dark lighting, great for couples and small groups.\n\nFor starters, the misses and I got the antipesto salad, served on a chopping board (talk about being unique). The antipesto salad had everything you'd expected, but in a more friendly portion geared towards sharing for two. I was very impressed by the presentation and quality of taste. Although the salad had a few salty items, the bread (5 stars alone for this by the way) evened out the salt. \n\nAfter the antipesto salad, the owner went around the entire restaurant giving every table free sweet tomato bruschettas for free! \n\nFor entree, I got the spinach ricotta and the misses got the mushroom gnocchi. Both entrees were fantastic, but a little smaller in size - I strongly recommend ordering an appetizer before the entree, or else you'll be hungry. The spinach ricotta was well made, I was impressed by the taste and presentation. The mushroom gnocchi was very cute and tasty.\n\nAfter the entree, the waiter gave us the check along with on the house dessert for free once again!

Yet on this day, all I could think about was pasta drenched in a rich basil-y marinara and covered in cheese.  Mmmmm...  \n\nAfter stumbling upon Bella Trattoria's 4-star rating on Yelp, my dinner companion and I trekked to the Inner Richmond and excitedly braved the icy San Francisco air for the 2 blocks from the car to the restaurant.  \n\nWe entered this cute, dimly-lit little establishment with high hopes and serious pasta cravings.  But sadly, our pasta-cravings remained unfulfilled.  We ordered the Lobster Ravioli and the Squid Ink Linguine, upon recommendation from the waiter.  The Lobster Ravioli's creamy tomato-based sauce was exactly what I was looking for.  \n\nBut alas, the Linguine's strange, fishy flavor was not.  The Squid Ink Linguine was completely overpowered by fishiness.  It's like they marinated the linguine noodles in tuna-juice.  Moreover, the tomatoes on top were disturbingly soft and flavorless.  We both grudgingly ate the linguine, but only because we didn't want to leave the restaurant hungry, and we both made sure to end our meals with a bite of the delicious ravioli to rid our palates of our unexpected undersea adventure.  Needless to say, neither one of us wanted to take home the leftover linguine.  \n\nThough the ravioli was delicious, I must give Bella Tratoria 2 stars for the food.\n\nHowever, the service was wonderful and I would give it 4 stars.  Our waiter gave us complimentary polenta-cakes topped with jack cheese while we waited for our meals, and brought us a delicious complimentary panna cotta after we paid for our meal. \n\nThough it seems like others have enjoyed the other options on the menu, due to my post-linguine trauma, I think it's safe to say that I will skip any return visits to Bella Trattoria.", "author": "Julie S."}

All of them were well prepared in presentation and they all made with fresh ingredients.  \n\nMy entree was really interesting and I got to try something I never tried before.  The \"Squid Ink\" Linguine with Clams, Calamari and Eggplant.  When it came out, it was not what I expected.  I just thought it was going to be regular linguine and then \"Squid Ink\" was a sauce or something.  But the linguine was literally black in color.  Again, the pasta tasted really fresh.  I am not sure if they make it themselves but it sure seemed to be \"homemade\".  Also, the sauce that accompanied the dish was really buttery.  But it was more a brothlike texture.  The sauce was a lot like a lot of places where Manila Clams is the appetizer and you get it in a broth.\n\nMy wife got the Gnocci.  Again, it was really fresh but I didn't like it as much.  I haven't really ate gnocci much but there's seemed to be small like the size of a mini scallop.  I thought they are usually bigger.  But the sauce was still pretty good.  \n\nThe only other thing to comment about is the bread they give with the table.  It had this really distintive taste.  Not really my favorite distintive taste but I guess it's unique nonetheless.  \n\nNot your everyday Italian spot but they are different and unique so if you are ever in the neighborhood and want some Italian, try it out.

The penne wasn't as soft as I would've liked it though, but that's okay - different tastes. \n\nNow, here come the reasons for why I have to give this place an upgrade. Service was top notch. I mean, we're not the most quiet group of people but they were so friendly and had a great time with us. They sang happy birthday to my girl and gave me the honor of shaking the tambourine with it.

More free food which made me even happier!!\n\nNow moving on to the negatives....(the only negative)\n\nMy only complaint was that all the dishes were a little on the salty side.

I walked in without a reservation, and the waiter told me it will take about five to ten minutes for the next available table. The wait wasn't long, and we got seated right on time. The restaurant is very dim, which creates a more romantic feel to it. \n\nOur waiter brought out bread and olive oil while we were trying to decide on our orders. I love variety, so I ordered the assagini di bella, which had three types of pasta: penne, ravioli, and gnocchi. Waiting for our dishes to be made, our waiter asked us if we wanted any salad. We ordered caeser salad, not knowing it costed nearly as much as a pasta plate. It was literally just romaine lettuce with grated cheese. My order was very satisfying nonetheless. I usually don't like gnocchi, it always tasted like hardened pieces of dumplings, but their gnocchi here was just amazing. It was easy to chew and it didn't stick to your throat. \n\nBe cautious that they do urge you to order things like coffee, tea, desserts, etc after/before your meal. One of the waiters gave us the menus again to look at desserts without simply asking us. They also calculated our total incorrectly. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious and the waiters have pretty good manners.", "author": "Tina C."}

To say nothing of the seafood fare and the in-house prepared pasta, both excellent by the way, this restaurant really makes you appreciate how great fresh produce can taste.  They select their vegetables each day at the farmer's market, and the freshness is nothing like what you'll likely find on Safeway's regular isles.\n\nIf the ingredients are fantastic, the preparation of the food itself could use some polishing.  The bread was soft and chewy, but would've tasted better warm or hot, rather than cold.  The pasta we had could have used some more flavor.  \n\nThe service and the ambiance are both great.  The setting can be best described as intimate and cozy.  We went close to when the sun was setting, and they dimmed the lights gradually to match with the level of lighting outside.  Cheesy perhaps, but effective enough.  Definitely a friendly and unpretentious, but thoughtful atmosphere.\n\nIf I had the option, 4.5stars is what I would rate it.

I don't even like gnocchi, but the waitress/hostess said that it was nothing like I have ever had before. She was right. It melted in my mouth. Most often, gnocchi is gummy and chewy, but this would have been chewable if I hadn't had any teeth. The gorganzola sauce that it was in was equally delicious. I am cheese nut through and through, but it was very, very good. \n\nMy S/O had the three sauces/pastas entree and was also very pleased by it.  She liked the \"pink\" sauce the best, but enjoyed the gnocchi as the best pasta. The ravioli was also scrumptuous with a light white sauce.\n\nWe weren't going to have dessert, but we ended up getting a strawberry cheesecake like thing (I don't remember the name) which was served warmed and was a good ending.

Next I ordered the gorgonzola polenta. Pure heaven on a plate. Polenta infused with gorgonzola just enough to achieve a rich, decadent taste that lit up my mouth into little cheese-worshipping fireworks. I then had the eggplant parmigiana which stayed true to the classic but had a lightness of texture and taste that filled me up just perfectly. My s.o. had the lobster ravioli which blew both of us (normally non seafood eaters away).

I felt that your review was very constructive and was actually read to all of the staff before service this evening. Again, thanks for your review and  I wish you luck in your dinning adventures and if your ever back in the neighborhood please stop in for a quick hello. \nsincerely \nDavid Gonzalez \nManager\n\n________________________________________________\nI wish I could write a better review of this place....but I just can't!\n\nWe were greeted promptly and shown to a good table.  The space is pretty, with high ceilings, cool hanging lamps and a copper clad bar.  However, things started off badly when two of the wines we requested were not available.....the suggestions the waiter made were fine, and we settled in....and settled in....and finally had our orders taken.   They brought us some complimentary bruschetta - but it wasn't very good, albeit a nice touch.\n\nAs some yelpers have mentioned, the menu on the website is pretty different from the menu in the restaurant.  Some discrepancies are expected, but they really should update the on line menu.  \n\nMy hon of hons husband had the Caesar, while I opted for the clams in tomato basil sauce.  It took at least 15 minutes for those simple appetizers to arrive, and when they came, the waiter had to ask who got which dish, and set them down and left without offering pepper for the salad.  I didn't even get a seafood fork for my clams, and the tines of the fork I did have were so large I couldn't use them to pry out the tiny clams.  I finally flagged him over and got a salad fork, which was the smallest they had.  It did the job, but made me wonder why they don't have the proper cutlery.  The clams were devoid of flavor, and the portion was pretty stingy for $9.\n\nWe ordered a couple more glasses of wine, and they didn't come for nearly 20 minutes.  We had to flag down the waiter AGAIN and remind him.  When our entrees arrived, they were just delicious, even though once again we had to tell the waiter who got what. I had spinach gnocchi with a cream mushroom sauce and it was amazing.  My one complaint is that there was actually too much sauce on the dish.  My HOHH had whole wheat linguine with a mushroom sauce that worked perfectly - the combination really brought out the earthy flavors of the dish.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert since we had been there for nearly two hours.  The waiter brought out a small selection of delicious desserts on the house, which was very kind of him.\n\nIn conclusion, Bella Trattoria needs to get their act together.  Perhaps some additional staff would help.  The waits between courses, the forgetfulness of the existing staff, the lack of proper cutlery - were a big turn off for me, and I don't think we'll be back.  \n\nThe complimentary bruschetta and desserts were nice, but I'd rather just have good service than a bribe.", "author": ".Hon H."}

The experience was ok, but because I went with a group, I wasn't expecting top-notch anything.  Nothing was really disappointing, but nothing was really memorable either.  \n\nRecently, I went back with one other person, and found my experience to be disappointing.  I was expecting a bit more this time, as we went on an off-night and the restaurant was not busy. \n\nFirst, the bread came out; they were room temperature and burnt at the bottom.  Second, they didn't have a couple of items on the menu (it's not a big menu), which is understandable, but after about 5 minutes, we were told they just bought some ingredients and can now prepare the dish.  I'm not sure where they bought the ingredients, but it was late at night and it made me think twice about how fresh and/or \"local\" they were.  \n\nSo, my food came out, it was warm (plate was hot though).  The food was very average tasting, and a bit bland.  Again, nothing spectacular, not even above average I'd say.  However, I enjoyed the complimentary bruschetta (appetizer) and panna cotta (dessert).  The dessert could have used a mint leaf or berries on the side.  In general, the dishes just lacked taste and edge.  \n\nThe service was consistently below average.  One time, the waiter took the utensils away and forgot to bring us a new set.  Then, at the end, we had to remind them about our to-go boxes, which at this point, was getting annoying.  \n\nNot sure I'd go back again.  There are way too many good restaurants (italian and otherwise) in SF for just an ok experience.", "author": "Roger W."}

Very friendly, and provided great service.  My 2 friends  ordered the gnocchi with fennel sausage special, the three pasta dish (gnocchi, penne, and ravioli), and I ordered the griglia mista (wild salmon, the daily fish which was tilapia, and a huge prawn in a lemon butter sauce, served over a bed of arugula and spinach which were seared/sauteed in the lemon butter.  Really good stuff.  The Carpaccio we started with was probably the best carpaccio I've had in a couple years.\r\n\r\nTHe owner that was there that evening came by about midway through the meal.  My friend (a girl) already finished her tinily portioned 3 pastas, and was still hungry, and asked him for some more, because it wasn't enough.  He apologized profusely and tactfully, and asked which of the three she wanted, and he'll bring it out.  When I first got the salmon, I asked him if it was really wild (it wasn't the dark red orange inside that expected, and the flavor was rather weak), and he said it was.  This time, he just told me, \"I know.  you're not feeling the salmon.  I'll bring you something else.\"  He came out with some more penne for my friend (who was still hungry) and a bowl of large clams with cherry tomatoes and eggplant.  SO tasty.  I was totally satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe wine he chose to pair our 3 dishes was good, I can't remember the italian name, but it had a nice fruit nose, some spice, and earthy aftertaste.  Went perfectly with the carpaccio and some parts of my fish.\r\n\r\nAmbience was dark and romantic.  Not cramped, and decently spacious.  Only problem is a lack of waitstaff I think...everything was a little bit slow.  However, the owner's attentiveness and level of service more than made up for it.\r\n\r\nAnd the prices were reasonable too.

To their credit, there is a nice bench out there. It doesn't fit 12 though. They didn't really check on us, they just came out twice to confirm that we were a party of 12.

It took them another hour for us to be served our food, and when they brought that out, they had lost half the party's orders. \r\n\r\nThis was all rather disappointing, because others who had been there before clearly felt this wasn't their typical service.

We didn't want to spend too much that day and we weren't that hungry so we only ordered an entree each. Though it seemed to be a slow night, the waiters did not try to push us into ordering more or make us feel as though we were a waste of time. And despite the fact that our order was minimal, us first timers did not receive any less attention than the other patrons and regulars. Our glasses were constantly refilled with water and we were never interrupted during our meal/conversation, they had absolutely graceful manners.\n\nThe food was amazing, definitely worth the price. My bf ordered the seafood linguine dish and though the menu said it included clams, the waiter told us the chef replaced the old clams with fresh mussels instead, which came as a pleasant surprise to us because we're big on fresh food quality over quantity. The waiter did not lie, we could taste the salty fresh flavor of the mussels which definitely pleased the bf who was craving clams at the time. I would give this restaurant extra stars for this gesture because I'm tired of places taking advantage of us being young and not knowing any better.

Have driven by a million times, didn't think spending that type of money to eat on GEARY ST would be worth. Was I wrong...once inside you forget that you're on that busy street.  The atmosphere was cozy and dare I say romantic.  Nice dimmed lights and chill music set the mood.\n\nService was on point.  Very friendly and accommodating to our large birthday party.  We must have met every employee that night, even one tried to entertain our one-year old (my friend's...not me!) The food was very tasty.  I have to admit, we weren't the best customers.  Our party kept getting up to smoke outside or take shots at the bar next door, but the employees kept smiling and waited for people to return before serving. Sorry guys and thanks!!!\n\nRecommendation:  The duck gnocchi was incredible as was their meatball appetizer.", "author": "Ezduzit S."}

It had a hint of bubbles to it almost like there is still a little bit of fermentation going on in the bottle but after a couple of sips it smooths out and you can taste the complexity of the wine. For Starters we had the Brussel sprouts which were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful combination of olive oil and pancetta and were tender but still firm and just the right temp when they came out. We also tried a dish that had thinly sliced venison topped with arugula sprouts, olive oil and some sort of sauce that was a creamy red color the plating was very pretty :) Then for our entrees we had the Macarones Salchicha and the Tagliolini Salmon E Caviale which were both in a cream sauce the Macarones was in a red cream and the Salmon a white which just melted in your mouth very smooth not over the top rich but tasty. Then to top it off we had dessert Tiramisu and their sherbert and other chocolate ice cream thing, and Panna cotta all complimented nicely with a chilled glass of champagne and punctuated with a petite shot of limoncello.

It was on a Friday night and I was glad that we made early reservations at 6:30pm for the restaurant quickly filled up within 30 mins.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was nice with a rustic Italian feel.  \n\nI loved the complimentary bread they gave at the beginning of the dinner which was dipped in a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and sun dried tomatoes!  Yum!  \n\nThe best was when they gave my boyfriend and I the Zabaglione desert (Marsala wine whipped custard with strawberries) at the end of our dinner, on the house.  Not only was it absolutely delicious, but it only made me crave for more!  I was pleased that they offered us dessert even though we said we would pass. =)  \n\nPros:\n1) Reservations can be made through Open Table\n2) Nice decor and spacious restaurant\n3) Great for a romantic night out \n4) Very reasonably priced!\n\nCons:\n1) I wanted more Zabaglione!\n2) Street parking can take a while as there are many restaurants and shops around that area", "author": "A W."}

My boyfriend and I were sat right away. Our server, came by and after some of our questions it seemed that he expected us to know what all of the Italian meant and barely bothered to explain it to us. We started with the Polenta di Bella; I wasn't super familiar with Polenta or Gorgonzola cheese. The appetizer was tasty, but very strongly Gorgonzola-y. I ended up ordering a pasta with the gluten free spaghetti. The flavors were yummy, but the pasta was very stuck together and sort of mushy. My boyfriend's pasta was good, but nothing too special. We were served by the owner and wish he had been more helpful and welcoming.", "author": "Erin H."}

We ate here for my friend's birthday and I loved everything they put in front of me. I had the butternut squash ravioli. I was perfect....slightly buttery with just the right flavor and texture. You could tell the pasta was very fresh. My boyfriend had the risotto with truffle oil and mushrooms and I had some and it was excellent. It's rich though so order the butternut squash ravioli if you want something light. I also tried my friend's gnocchi with ragu and pork and it was sooo good! It was soft and a little chewy and it was just how gnocchi should be. \n\nYes, the service is a little slow. Also, I could barely understand a word the waiter said (not being mean) but I did think it was cool that he was actually Italian. However, I would say this place is definitely worth trying.

It was close to my apartment and they were gracious enough to take our reservation but they warned us that there would be a large party of people coming half an hour before us. I was surprise when getting there how small the restaurant but it had a very cozy, romantic atmosphere. The waiter was super friendly and nice. Our food took a bit longer than we wanted, but the waiter explained that they had a small kitchen and the orders were just put in for the big party before us. The waiter was very apologetic and nice enough to give us free appetizers as we waited. \n\nWhen the food came & we tasted it... oh man, was it was worth the wait! Some of he dishes we ordered was eggplant parmigiana, bruschetta, the melt in your mouth gnocchi, the veal parmigiana, to name a few.

(polenta at this restaurant is typically $8.95, eggplant parmiggana is typically $8.95, soup was probably $5 or $6, and the dessert $6.95). Conclusion - new years eve menu here is a rip off! Try the special prix fix menus at other places in the city for NYE\n*Dessert selection was unimpressive - we had the panna cotta and tiramisu and were not wowed by either\n*Eggplant parmiggana (two thinly sliced eggplant pieces with what tasted like canned tomato sauce) as a main course? It was a disappointment\n*Was not impressed by the wine selection - we ordered the most expensive chardonnay they had and were disappointed\n*Not good for groups larger than four (small restaurant) \n\nBottom line, in all I was not impressed by the prix fix options and was expecting a lot more.

The room has a high ceiling, well spaced tables, a cool yellow tone.  The young ladies who serve are well-meaning, a bit too familiar perhaps, but nice none-the-less.  \n\nThe food not so much.\n\n Lobster ricotta ravioli comes as four discs covered by a sauce that is cool at the perimeter of the plate and only slightly warmed by the ravioli in the center of the plate.  The ravioli are al dente but the taste of either lobster or ricotta is nowhere to be found.    \n\nA baked veal cutlet comes is topped with fontina cheese and what the menu describes as a porcini mushroom sugo.  The so-called sugo atop the  veal is actually a glop of a sauce, some tasteless mushrooms within it, that completely overwhelms the veal.  \n\nEverything about the food seemed amateurish.", "author": "David D."}

But to my surprise, this place wasn't bad at all.  Cute, small, intimate interior. We came right before the rush on a Friday night (a little after 6), and got seated quickly. The wait staff were all friendly, young and hip people.   \n\nThe bread is by far the best I've ever had; very, very soft and warm with a touch of sweetness to it. The olive oil dip with sun-dried tomato went well with the bread. I had the rigatoni pasta with Italian sausage in a red sauce and mascarpone cheese, which was enjoyable, but nothing too special.  I thought the portion was a good size, especially compared to my friend's Ravioli Di Pollo dish- homemade chicken ravioli in tomato & basil sauce.  I had a bite of the ravioli, which was interesting because it too had a sweetness to it.  Nonetheless, it was some good ravioli. \n\nOverall, good place to try once since I drive pass it all the time, but probably wouldn't be the first place that will come to mind if I'm ever craving Italian in the future.", "author": "Lisa C."}

I think they realized this afterwards and and only charged us for 14 instead of the 15 adults we had.\n\n I thought all the food was good.  The bruschetta was good, with really ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella on top of a garlicky crostini.  I like the really tender gnocchi, but some of our guests thought they were too soft.  The inguini carbonara was good, as was the pork cutlet.  I liked almost all of the dishes, butt most of their food tends to be on the salty side.  I could do with a little less salt in almost all of the dishes.  The desserts are good.  I like the panna cotta best which really cleanses the palate.\n\nService was great.

My guess is that their kitchen is tiny and can deal with a couple of tables at a time, so they want to stack their orders.  That really irks me, the way I look at it is, if you're going to have a restaurant that has, say, 15 tables, then be sure you can staff to serve 15 tables should everyone decide to show up at once.  As usual, tonight, they made us sit down to wait even though there were literally 3-4 empty tables there.\n\nThe food has slipped in quality in the past year.

Bella's struck me as being more home-style, more exquisite, and definitely a much more relaxed, quiet environment. For appetizer, we had the grilled bruschetta with spring tomatoes and mozarella on top - absolutely fantastic. At first we didn't think we'd get that dish, but as soon as we saw another waiter bring it past us to another table, the decision was simply point and done. That's how good it looked, and we did not regret our choice. For entree, I had the pasta trio (ravioli, rigatoni, and gnocchi i think).

Even my 22 year-old could tell that our waiter was ignoring us,   Another waiter noticed our annoyance, he came by to give us more bread and water and tried to explain the kitchen was taking a little bit more time to prepare our food.  We didn't even order anything special, just pasta.  We were there celebrating my child's 22nd birthday.  She didn't even want to order dessert afterward.  We couldn't wait to get out of there.  The pasta was just ok - nothing out of ordinary.  The nice waiter gave us a free dessert at the end.  I am giving one extra star just because of him.  How sad!!!", "author": "A Y."}

After a ridiculously long search for a parking space, we were treated to a wonderful meal in a surprisingly calm (perhaps, due us arriving late) yet romantic environment. Staff was patient yet attentive and the food was incredible. First, I'd kill for the Carbonara. Fresh, and flavorful. My friend had the Pasta a' Norcina. Perfectly prepared, hearty and rich.

I live near Bella, and I was excited to have a potential favorite Italian spot in my neighborhood. To my disappointment though, I was not impressed with Bella's food.\nThe menu is rather small, which is fine in normal circumstances. When I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, our server said \"oh, we ran out of that.\" Then, when my fiance ordered the Lasagne, she said \"oh, we're out of that too.\" Mind you, our reservation was at 7:30 pm on a Saturday... \nI ended up ordering the butternut squash ravioli, and it was decent. It was really sweet and buttery, and only had 5 raviolis on the plate. It was almost cold when they brought it out to me. My fiance ordered the pork cutlet, which came on a plate by itself (no pasta, no salad, etc) and was overwhelmingly greasy. We came with 2 other couples, and nobody seemed impressed with their dish. \n\nI'm giving this place 2 stars because of the ambiance (really cute) but I won't be going back for the food.", "author": "megan s."}

I yelped \"affordable, romantic\" and Bella came up. I made a reservation with ease, and when I needed to change the time because we ran late, they were completely accommodating and reassuring that we would get a table.\n\nFrom the minute we got there, we felt like pampered guests. They put us at  a window table, brought us a complimentary bruccetta, gave us the thumbs up when we ordered our beer in bottles (rather than glasses), and were just generally gracious and easy-going. Later, the waitress brought us a complimentary dessert - and we hadn't even told her it was my boyfriend's birthday! I think she just liked us (must have been the beer). I got the Spaghetti Tonno and Olive - delicious. My boyfriend ordered the gnocci and loved it. He was very happy with the evening overall. We even made it home in time for the \"Creepy KOFY Movie Show.\" Couldn't have been a better night.\n\nAnyway, if you want to impress your sweetie with some pampering and not break the bank, dinner here will put stars in your lover's eyes, and it's a good excuse to put on a snazzy outfit and go out. An excellent meal that is affordable with very romantic atmosphere, I think you'd do well to eat here. They make you feel like they appreciate your patronage.

My husband had the gnocchi with meatballs with tomato sauce--he almost passed out because the food was so good.

You will not find anything fancy, just straight forward Italian that you will enjoy.  My favorite is their Pansotti (large ravioli's).  Bella also serves a great three variety pasta dish so you can try a few different things.  The wine is decently priced and the tiramisu is good finisher.\n\nService:  I have always had great service from the folks at Bella.\n\nLocation:  It is not located in North Beach, however, I find this place benefits from being away from all of the buzz because its location adds to its secluded-ness.  Note, that I do enjoy the feel of North Beach, but if you are looking for something w/o the noise this is your place.\n\nAmbiance:  Bella is a bit small, but romantic.  It feels like your neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The tables are covered with white table cloths and one wall is painted with an Italian landscape.  The lighting also adds a romantic feel.\n\nPrice:  The prices are affordable and equals the food and experience.", "author": "Christian X."}

Had baby squids and mussels and clams.. so good.\n-Brickoven roasted game hen with whipped potatoes and brussel sprouts: Oh. My. God.  The hen was intact, but completely deboned. So cool. Had a nice crisp exterior, super juicy interior. Whipped potato was simple and salty, a gorgeous compliment to the hen. And the brussel sprouts!!! Best I've ever had ever. Sauteed with pancetta and honey.. still had a little bite to them. \n-House carbonara: You have to be brave to put something like Carbonara on the menu. It's simple, rustic, and easy to eff up. This was sublime. Perfectly cooked pasta, perfectly dressed with egg sugo. MMMMMM.\n-House Panna Cotta and Tiramisu: So good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-22", "description": "Came here for some friends' (twins!) birthday dinner on Saturday night. The place is a tiny hole in the wall that manages to be quiet enough even when you're sitting right next to some other party. I have to say that overall this place has some great points and some really low points. I should probably preface this with the fact that I lived in northeastern Italy for 6 months during my college days, so I have a general idea of what things are supposed to taste like.\n\nIt took a while for our party to get here and the waitstaff was fine with that. They even brought us olive oil + tomatoes for us...but neglected to bring out bread with which to eat the oil with until 15 minutes after the last person in our party had arrived. I hadn't eaten all day so I was starving and the tiniest bit annoyed, but I let it pass because I wanted to have a good evening. \n\nEveryone else loved the bread but I didn't particularly enjoy it. It wasn't super crusty (which made it hard to dip properly) and the inside was light and squishy...but also super super dense. I dunno how to explain it, perhaps it was some sort of quick-bread recipe? At any rate it pretty much tasted like fresh baked wonder bread to me. \n\nWe all pretty much got pastas and gnocchi cause a few of the people in our party were observing the weekly lenten meatless diet. As we ordered our entrees, the waiter asked if we wanted a salad with it...so without looking at the menu we said \"sure\" and all got one. Much to our surprise, they charged us for the salads on the bill. Okay okay maybe we shouldn't have been THAT surprised but it would have been nice for the waiter to remind us that there would be an extra charge...cause none of us thought the salad was worth NINE dollars. Just because the half-fistful of lettuce doesn't show signs of oxidation on it doesn't mean it should cost that much. I grew up in an agricultural community so I know how much lettuce costs and you can't say that the dressing and cheese were worth the remaining $8.50. That's right folks it was a plain caesar salad. Ugh. Anyways the salads weren't bad, just super pricey (I was thinking they'd be $6.)\n\nI ordered the gnocchi al ragu because a)I always get the squash ravioli wherever I can find it in a fairly good Italian restaurant and b) even though I really wanted carbonara (in the authentic style, sans cream) I know how ridiculously easy it is to make and figured I will just have to go buy some pancetta and make my own next week. Plus, the gnocchi is made in-house. They can't be too bad...and I was right. Super soft and tasty! My friend's gnocchi al gorgonzola was even better, the sauce wasn't tooooo heavy like most places do it and it was spinach-infused gnocchi...yum. Others raved about their squash ravioli. I didn't hear too many comments (good or bad) about the linguini con polpetti (although, isn't it usually spaghetti with meatballs?) or the risotto.\n\nThen it came time for dessert and because I had opted to have a sangria (pretty good at $7.50 per glass) I opted out of dessert even though I really really wanted a zabaione. Someone got an affogato and the birthday girls got a zabaione...and then the waiter brought us two free \"tastes\" of panna cotta which were more than enough for the remaining 4 of us to share!\n\nThen the bill came and it took forever to figure out how much extra we needed to pay (since we were splitting the cost of the twins' dinner) cause the bill just listed \"6 salads...53.70\" and so on rather than individual prices. Combined with the shock of the realization that the salads were very costoso and that last part of our evening didn't go so great. I hope that the twins didn't feel bad for making us all have to whip out our credit cards for them cause we were all happy to do it...just annoyed at the lack of transparency with the waitstaff.\n\n55 bucks later, I had paid for my dinner and roughly 1/3 of another person's meal plus tax and tip. The extra $10 meant I didn't have cash for cover at the lounge we headed to next!\n\nOverall, if I wasn't paying for this meal and the bread was better, I'd love this place. It's closer to my house and easy to get to and the food is pretty good. But since I did have to pay for meals I can't say I love this place very much. Extra star for the panna cotta and not trying to kick us out even though it was well past closing. Even though it's more of a chain, if you want an elegant Italian dinner...I'll head to Il Fornaio, which remains my favorite \"we're going out for a nice dinner\" place (even if everyone else in the place has some grey hair).", "author": "Katies F."}

Not only do they try to use local and sustainable ingredients but it always tastes delicious and with care like it was made just for you. I love their ravioli, whether it is the lobster or spinach and ricotta. Each bite is tender and melts in your mouth perfect. Same goes for their gnocchi. I think someone said they were like little puffs of clouds, soft, flavorful, fantastic and always with the right amount of sauce that is both creamy and savory. Even when I am beyond full, I get sad that my meal at Bella is about to end. The penna cotta served with strawberries is the most wonderful way to end your dining experience here. \n\nYes, I love Bella more than Edward.", "author": "Julia T."}

When I say authentic, I mean a contemplative, European experience.  Remember when we actually drank our wine, enjoyed our conversations and laughed the hours away?  This is the place to live those days again, or for the first time.  With all the hustle and bustle of our lives, why are we asking our restaurants to follow suit?  \n\nThe homemade gnocchi is lovely; the trout special is succulent; the game hen melts in your mouth.  \n\nDavid, co-owner, will charm you all night -- especially if you are a pretty woman in stylish shoes (preferably high heeled).\n\nThis is a truly lovely establishment, a throwback to easier times, a place to sit back and really enjoy your food and drink.

I stood at the door waiting to be seated, and finally by 7.30 he sat us. Apparently they had to move around some tables to make my reservation and one of 14 people work. I wasn't too happy about having to wait around for 30 minutes for a reservation I was supposed to have.\n\nOnce seated, it took the staff a little longer than I expected, to get some water.

When in his hood...do as the Roman's do? Err...maybe not...but whatev, you get the point.  We arrived early and were offered seats at the bar where they had an attractive and entirely edible display of cherries.  Mmmm...cherries are good m'kay.  Then we were given water and glasses of the house wine which comes in a keg.  Note to self: try and get one of those bad boys for the DYL B2B event.  We were seated at our table that overlooked the street and our waiter was humorous enough to point out our sweeping view of the lake and hills aka the Burger King.  We started out with the antipasta sampler and at our waiter's suggestion stuck with the small instead of the large we originally ordered.  It was perfect for two people and I appreciated the candor and honesty of our server.  We ordered a bottle of the Montalcino Lindo and our server made some recommendations of menu items that would be complimentary to that particular wine.  I went with the Gnocchi with duck ragout and my handsome squire went with the steak with gorgonzola cream sauce.  Both of our plates were cleaned.  Dessert for me was the ricotta tarte that had fresh strawberries and was delicious and the dessert sitting across from me had a very generous piece of tiramisu that I tried and found really fresh.  We washed said desserts down with glasses of port that were topped off gratis.\nI will definitely highly recommend this place due to the service alone which was personable, educated, and solicitous.  Seriously, some of the best service I've ever had.\nEven more kudos for putting me in the mood for romance with Prince Charming.", "author": "Jill D."}

We were waiting outside for Bella to open. The owner/server jumps out of a cab, runs into the restaurant, opens the restaurant. Fine. Girlfriend/wife/? sits at the bar the whole time, odd. Maybe she was the distraction.\nWe ordered the mixed antipasti plate. Grilled eggplant, sun dried tomato's, mozzarella, zucchini. Very good. When we were deciding on which gnocci to order the server suggested the Gorgonzola,  we ordered the calamari gnocci,  the Gorgonzola gnocci was served to us.  Huh, okay. It was delicious, we were happy, wanted the calamari, but the gnocci were excellent. Not gummy or chewy, little pillows of love.\nThen the dinners were served, steak over there, correct ,steak there, wrong, a plate of red sauce here, don't know what's hiding under it yet. Hmmm. Where's the seafood I ordered. The guy who brought out the plates could only say \"no\". Yes! No, is not the right answer. Yeah, go talk to the owner guy and find my fish please. We figured out the pork was hiding under the red sauce, that's what hubby ordered. So they took away the 2nd steak, owner comes over with the menu, this is what you ordered, no?  No! I don't have a great Italian accent, but the words were VERY different. He leaves, comes back, says the cook didn't understand him. Oh, that's nice. It must make for a lot of mistakes, I would imagine.\n So my dining partners start eating, and I sit waiting for my food. \nIt was great. Three grilled shrimp, 2 kinds of fish, over spinach, and yummy roasted potato's.  Lot's of apologies. Thanks.\nHad pistachio gelato, yummy. They were out of 2 of 4 after dinner drinks. \nThe check comes. Nothing is comp'ed?  I didn't ask, just sort of assumed.

I went on Opentable, and lo and behold, there was a 1000 point reservation here.  So, I booked it at the last minute and off we went.\nUpon arrival, I was very impressed.  The decor is very nicely done, somewhat muted, and lends to feeling relaxed and at home.  We were immediately brought this very delicious bread with a yummy, crispy crust and olive oil with sundried tomatoes.  The waiter was friendly, funny, and helpful.  He suggested a great Syrah and we chouse the Heirloom Tomato Caprese salad as our appetizer.  Unfortunately, the tomatoes were a bit underripe and hard, but the mozzeralla was tasty.  The waiter came by to check on us and truly was interested in how the tomatoes tasted since they were a new arrival to the restaurant.  I informed him that they were a bit too hard, and he immediately brought us bruchetta on the house.  And, that, was excellent.\nI had the gnocchi in a gorgonzola bechamel and my friend had the 3 pasta dinner.  The gnocchi was fluffy and light and, even though I finished a huge plate of it, I didnt feel like I had rocks in my stomach (as I have at other places).  My friend was very happy with his meal, as well.  Unfortunately, were were too full for dessert, but the menu looked incredible.  \nThe only drawback was that the service was a bit slow because there was only one waiter serving all the tables.  Despite the slowness, he was incredibly friendly and funny, so I can't really hold it against him.\nI think this is an excellent neighborhood gem and I plan to return over and over again.", "author": "Jessica L."}

We had decent sangria, and I really enjoyed the bread and dipping sauce.  We all ordered from the $60 prix fix menu--I enjoyed the ravioli appetizer and vegetable soup.  My main entree, the short ribs was very tender and delicious, and we all shared our desserts from the prix fix. . .but I was the only one in my group who enjoyed the meal.   My friends thought their osso buco was just so so not to mention one of them only had about 1/2 the amount of osso buco than my other friend. In all, we agreed that the $60 was waaaay overpriced. \n\nAnother thing that was annoying was that the waiter must've thought my friend was flirting with him because he was extremely attentive to her- and kept thinking she was making sexual jokes with him when she really wasn't.  She was merely pointing out that her portion was much smaller than others who ordered the same thing.  AND at the end of the meal when she said she wanted to take the bones home (for her dog), she shouldn't have to ask twice for a box.

Arrived and was greeted promptly. Asked for a nice quiet table, which they did accommodate, but then a chatty woman sat next to our table ( not enough distance between our tables that you could tune her out).  Ambiance is dark, yet warm and intimate. Others who have reviewed about the wait time from ordering to service of each dish (app., entree, dessert) being too long are spot on. (granted it did get a little busy and there were only two servers and one busboy).  The complimentary bread was soft and chewy. Like others have commented... Would have been even more better if the bread was warm.  My husband and I shared the spinach salad which was only okay.  We also share the crostini appetizer-- excellent.  Very fresh and loved how the crostini was toasted and crusty on the outside but still soft in the inside.  For our entrees, my husband enjoyed his tagliorini with salmon and black caviar in a light bechamel sauce. I, too enjoyed my entree-- sorrentina--gnocchi with sausage and fresh mozzarella in a tomato sugo.  The desserts were only okay. We shared a dish of the chocolate gelato and the tiramisu. The gelato was ok. For the $8 it cost, I would gladly pay for a pint of the devishly chocolate gelato at Holy Gelato over on 9th Avenue and Judah in the Sunset.  The tiramisu was rather skimpy, especially for $8. I would have liked and expected a larger layer of mascarpone.  Overall, the meal was good.

(being hungry, we ate the bread quickly and they brought more bread and tomatoes without us even thinking to ask.)  we were also treated to free bruschetta appetizers on the house!  crunchy bread, tasty fresh tomatoes and topped again by the delicious sun-dried tomato oil.\n\nmy boy got the house made gnocci in a gorgonzola sauce for his main course.  he loved it.  i got an entree that offered me a taste of three different things: a small portion of penne topped in a pink sauce, house made spinach ravioli in a white sauce and house made gnocci al ragu.  the gnocci was especially impressive.  normally, when you think of gnocci, it's very heavy and dense while theirs was light, airy and you could actually eat more than 5 without feeling super full.  the spinach ravioli was also to die for -- the sauce was a milk-based one that wasn't heavy like you expect white/cream sauces to be.  lastly, the penne portion was a perfect pink sauce on regular penne noodles.  i made sure to save a gnocci with the pink sauce for my last spectacular bite! :)\n\ndessert was also very pleasing to my taste buds -- plus, they threw in an extra dessert on the house!  \n\noverall, a great hands down 5-star experience.\n\nwill definitely go back again!  so many more things on the menu i'd LOVE to try!", "author": "Lily B."}

The food was great, and they had a fun wine and beer selection. All Italian wines, so it will test those without knowledge of international wines (namely, those like myself). \n\nThat said, the servers were very helpful, and funny without being obnoxious. We really enjoyed the appetizers and entrees. Only complaint was that my Arrabiatta (\"angry pasta\") was a little on the oily side, meaning there was a pool of oil on the plate. Nonetheless, it was very tasty.\n\nDesserts were awesome. Save some room for the zaballone (spelling?).", "author": "Scott D."}

After doing some research from fellow Yelpers, I was amazed by the rave reviews and picked Bella for my birthday dinner. Oh, I'm so glad I did. Bella is truly wonderful.\n\nComing from a discerning palette of East Coast Italian cuisine, Bella ranks right up there. However, I have to say I've never found softer, more deliciously prepared pasta ever. The texture is buttery, yet holds up very well in the various sauces - for very tender yet not overcooked pasta... come here. My room mate had the lobster ravioli, his tomato sagu sauce over the delicate raviolis was bliss. J is such a picky eater yet he was very impressed with the texture and well paired sauce. I had the three pasta sampler, I was not disappointed - the much reviewed gnocchi was not disappointing. I loved how they melted with every bite, not to much potato, and not to much flour with the addition of spinach - nice touch. As was the spinach ravioli in creme sauce - wow. Thin ravioli filled with fresh (not wilted) spinach and a light creme sauce, I loved it. The penne vodka was also a nice compliment between a creme and tomato sagu sauce. The pairing of these three pasta is genius, you don't get overwhelmed with too many tastes, but each one has it's on unique signature. My fiance had the mushroom risotto - rice simmered to perfection and mushrooms not overcooked as most often in a mushroom risotto. We also had the beef carpacci for apps, I loved it with the bread. We were thinking it was weird that italian bread not be crusty, but after eating two baskets we enjoyed the potato bread consistency of it. Made great for pasta sauce absorption. Does anyone else think it's potato bread?\n\nOverall the staff was very friendly and attentive, and atmosphere very intimate. Our conversation flowed and dinner went by so well, being seated by the window didn't matter because we were absorbed into our meal, and felt really comfortable. Again, my uber opinionated roomie even appreciated the details of his Trummer Pils glass. As there is a sense of detail in the service.\n\nEspecially when I was surprised with a complimentary panna cotta with a little candle in it for my birthday. I'm usually not a fan of panna cotta, but this was sweet with fresh strawberries on top. It does have this after hint like a strawberry Starburst. I loved it. And as much as the boys wanted to take credit for planning ahead, they both swore no one told the host. But Bella took care of me anyway, that's how attentive they are.\n\nThank you Bella for making my birthday so wonderful, you've made a fan out of me.", "author": "Jacquelyne L."}

I had the gnocci in tomato sauce. The gnocchi melted in your mouth.  the sauce was simple but tasty.  My super boyfriend had the butternut squash ravioli and that was REALLY good.  The house red wine was good, not dry but I prefer sweet.  I don't know what the wine was though. The  insalata mista was a waste of money. The tiramisu was really good.

We risked dining somewhere neither my dining companion nor I had ever been. We did not look at the menu prior- abnormal- but we were in a rush. I honestly just went with the name and because we wanted to be in the general neighborhood. \n\nThis wonderful restaurant is such because of the fantastic, attentive service, delicious food and ambience despite being in a Geary corner plot. \n\nWe felt like wine and were open to suggestion.  David, our server, suggested the perfect wine to accompany our meal. The taste offered only hinted at how much fun we'd have over the next few hours. The typical bread on the table at an Italian restaurant was elevated to a whole new level by the sun-dried tomatoes generously left sliced in olive oil. It was an enjoyable departure from the balsamic vinegar/ olive oil combo typically offered. We started with bruschetta and the carpaccio. The bruschetta should not be missed - it is perfection. \n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli in creamy marinara. Mmmm... I will be hard pressed not to order it every time I return. My friend ordered the tagliolini pork ragu and was very pleased as well. Hours passed and we were oblivious. \n\nWe decided to just glance at the dessert menu. Honestly, 9 times out of 10 I will pass, but I was tempted to try darn near every offering. We decided to split the tiramisu. Superb. As I briefly mentioned wanting to try the panna cotta with strawberries, I was generously offered a sample of that as well. \n\nThis place has a diner for life in me. If you're looking for a great Italian outside of North Beach, give this shocker of place a try. What a great night. The risk to try someplace out of the blue worked this time. Go with confidence- I hope you'll love it as well. If you don't, let me know, because I sincerely doubt it's possible.", "author": "Alix .."}

The food is carefully prepared and doesn't disappoint. The pasta and gnocchi are outstanding and housemade! The pastas vary from the traditional (best carbonara I've ever had) to innovative (lobster ravioli or squid ink linguine) and I haven't found a dish I didn't like. Also the menu does vary based on what is in season (I go there a lot) and that keeps things fresh and interesting. \n\nThe wine selection includes a lot of rare Italian gems that are specially imported for Bella and are not commercially available, so that is another major draw.\n\nI also can't say enough about the service, which is always attentive, even when the place is packed on weekend nights. The atmosphere is very classy and romantic, so it's great for a date or just a nice dinner with friends. Overall a fantastic experience! Don't miss it!", "author": "Diana Z."}

We were given water and some delicious home-baked bread with olive oil and sundried tomatoes. We ordered the three pasta meal and the butternut squash ravioli and the meatballs as an appetizer. The meatballs were divine! Just the right amount of garlic and olive oil. The butternut squash ravioli made me wish I was going again tonight! I also tasted my fiance's three pasta dish and was in love with the marinara sauce. The wine and beer were well-balanced and nice. While we were eating they brought us the polenta to taste for free.

The fish was fresh and had a good taste. It's fresh fishy flavor stood up to the strong avocado and other ingredients. We really enjoyed it. \n\nRabbit with housemade pasta and simple sauce with mustard seeds. Rabbit and mustard is my ultimate weakness when it comes to an entree. The rabbit was perfectly tender and the mustard seeds, though large in quantity, didnt overpower the rabbit or other components of the sauce. I was also very happy to see that they served the pasta perfectly twisted into kind of a ball shape. It kept  the pasta hot as I slowly pulled rabbit and pasta strands from the outer layers.\n\nAlso, in honor of my friends birthday, our wonderful server brought an assortment of their desserts for us to try and they were all great. The profiteroles were tasty, but we adored the pannacotta and the warm ricotta tart. They were rich tasting but light enough to finish our lunch meal with.

It started when the waitress brought us the wrong salad but one of our party accepted it as a substitute for what he'd ordered.  Then the appetizers came and two of the four of us were openly disappointed.  The albacore and avocado came without any avocado.  They had run out and the waiter never came to ask if we'd prefer a different dish......also the albacore was sliced paper thin.....almost like tuna prosciutto and seriously lacked the expected flavor and texture.   I had the meatballs which were rather bland and seemed to have more vegetable filling than meat and lacked any \"character\" to the flavor.  They were served on a bed of diced vegetables which didn't help the dish and were more bland than the meatballs.  Then came the main courses.  My wife's gnocchi verde was rather mushy and tasteless.  I know she doesn't like a dish right away when shortly after tasting it she offers to share it with me for some of what I had ordered.  Wrong move!  I had the \"famous\" carbonara with no creme and no butter.  This had to be the worst pasta I have ever had and I am 66 years old and frequent Italian restaurants.  It was dry and nearly tasteless......it reminded me of a lump of mashed potatoes which had been sitting overnight.  I thought the best dish was my friend's osso buco, but this was a little \"heavy\" as well and lacked any specific aroma of spices which would have improved it.  The story behind the owner and his success story is nice, but when I go to a restaurant, the company is first, but closely behind is the food and we found that Bella disappointed.......", "author": "Don L."}

I had the Tonno and Olive pasta which was perfectly al dente and delicious.  The rest of the party had the 3 pasta  and the baked penne, both of which were devoured.   Since we had cake at home we declined dessert, but the  server had overheard us talking about it being a birthday and brought out a complimentary panna cotta for dessert.

This was my second time at Bella's (last time I had some ravioli dish which was fine).  This time, I was shocked by a startling revelation-I kid you not, but the meat tasted EXACTLY like some frozen pre-made meatballs I bought at Safeway!  When I mentioned this to the waiter, he did admit the meatballs are made 3-4 days in advanced and are kept frozen,  He assured me they were hand-made but I know what I know.  There was definitely something wrong with their texture and taste/flavor.  So with that, BOOOO to Bella's.

This tactic can lead to a disaster in some restaurants, but at Bella it is always spot on. Tonight they inspired me to eat something I normally never would have (boar lasagna?!?) and it was outta sight. They also steered us away from two dishes, one because one of the ingredients wasn't as fresh tonight as they would like it to be and the other because it included raw egg, a no-no for the pregnant ladies like me. I think the awareness of the strengths of the menu, attention to seasonality of certain dishes and excellent customer service combine to make Bella a top choice.

My boyfriend and I had our first date there, and it was a great night. the time after was equally good. But then... one of the worst dining experiences ever. \nWe came on a night that was mildly busy, but were seated rather quickly. Then we were brought the wrong drinks and no bread. This was quickly sorted out. But then our order took almost an hour to get to us. By the time we had finished eating the restaurant was pretty much empty. Unfortunately we had come on a night when they were testing out a new hostess, and all the waiters were flirting with her like crazy. After 20 minutes of trying to get his attention from out table, I finally got up, walked over to him, tapped him on the shoulder and asked for the bill. Pretty sad when you consider we were the only table in the place!\nThe food was as usual, not great, but very good. Delicious sauces on their pastas, and the totellini is always on point.

The staff was extremely courteous and attentive, the food was on par with what I paid, and I feel as though the owners (who were kind enough to stop by my table both times I visited) are really trying hard to do the right thing.  Also, we as \"The City\" folk seem to relish in knowing about places that no one else knows about, and in that respect this place is right up your alley.

We were the first ones to arrive (admittedly a bit too early), but the staff was nice enough to let us chill for a bit until they were completely ready to open up. This early arrival was due to a mix up with our reservations from opentable. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our pre-dinner time because our server happily came over and gave us a great free ap\u00e9ritif. We toasted to a great night and not too much later ordered our meals. I ordered the prime rib. BIG MISTAKE! It was not good at all- very gross in fact. But the waiter was nice enough to let me switch up my dinner entree after I only had a few bites and let him know I was not enjoying the meat at all. I was able to get their ravioli dish. This dish was delicious! It sort of made up for the horrible prime rib (which they advertise on their website for some unknown reason) they served me. Overall it was pleasant, but I will only order Italian themed dishes from them. That common sense would have served me when I orginally went to the restaurant, but no matter. One bit of news for you all-  I looked on the city health boards website with respect to overall cleanliness and this restaurant did not have great grades.

After reading reviews and trying to find a good restaurant for a party of 14, I chose this place. They had the table waiting for us and water and bread were already out on the table. There were candles on the table and the ambiance of the place was perfect. As our party slowly rolled in, we began ordering. The hostess, who actually became our waitress, was so sweet. Her and her sister chatted with us and made us feel at home. When the food came out, it was delicious. VERY VERY GOOD. I ordered the dish with three different pastas and sauces. It totally hit the spot. After dinner was almost over, I was able to walk into the back kitchen to prepare the cake that they had been storing for me. As I stacked some cinderella figurines on the cake (yea i know, a 22nd birthday and still figurines, it was a joke!), we started to light the candles and bring the cake out.

This was their special valentines day event and it was so good I hardly know where to begin..  The mood was very romantic with cozy tables and candle light.  The atmosphere is warm and they have a beautiful mural of gondolas to gaze at.  We were greeted by an inviting host who we think is the owner he was hospitable, passionate about his food and perfect for the Italian experience.  Our meal was amazing with starters of beef carpaccio and a salad of baby squid and potatoes (kind of like a seafood potato salad).  Next the host provided a sampling from the chef of brushetta with hedgehog mushrooms and Gorgonzola... it was warm nutty and yummy, this was later followed by another sampling from the chef (we love these) of basil, tomato soup in a shot glass.  Our entrees were lobster ravioli and osso bucco.  Both knocked our socks off!  The ravioli had the most delicious tomato cream sauce and a scattering of sour squid rings just a perfect compliment to the richness of the dish.  We were told the Osso Bucco was going to be phenomenal and it was; so tender and flavorful served with very fresh tasting fettuccine.    We also had an amazing wine from Italy to accompany our meal.  Admittedly we were to full for desert but we went with it any how in the spirit of la Dolce Vida, for profiteroles that exploded with cream and a nutella sauce and the classic tiramisu (which was a little icey cold for our liking but good) was too tempting to resist.  Finally our meal was concluded with a champagne toast to our love and great dining experience!  This was a two hour extravaganza!  The place was packed but intimate conversation was achievable and they had a really wonderful guitarist who played all of our favorites.  The little trattoria was very busy and the service was a little scrambled but we were there not on a clock, so we were able to enjoy the mood, music and our time together.   We have been here a few times before on regular nights and were just as impressed.  We'll continue to go to enjoy our little piece of Italy right next door.", "author": "Lori T."}

Saturday we finally said the heck with it - dressed casual. We walked in and were instantly greeted - asked to wait at the bar and shortly thereafter were seated. Atmosphere is really relaxed - low lit - nice music and can be a little romantic if your in that kind of a mood. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took awhile before a server finally came over to tell us he'd be with us in a minute when we had already waited about 10 at the table. The good thing is while waiting we were given water and bread - and just enjoyed the vibe. Once our server introduced himself - it was consistent the rest of the time. Not the in your face every 5 minutes - but water glasses were kept full, plates cleared, and enough time to enjoy without feeling rushed. My BF is Italian - so he knows good Italian food - and he really liked it here as did I.  Our waiter spoken fluent Italian to the table behind us - so that was reassuring as well that we'd found a good place! Honestly it was a nice break from the normal Clement street food. The BF had the Linguine w/ clams, and I had the Spinach Ravioli. Melted in my mouth like butter. Good Salads but a little on the expensive side being that the entrees were from $10.95 - $19.95 and the salads (small) were $6.95-$7.95.  Great bottle of wine as well and desert to top it off.  2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and a bottle of wine - total 85.00 + tip which is a steal right?!

The lighting is very dim here, and it works, creating a hushed and intimate environment that helps to focus your attention on your food and your own party rather than the other patrons.  The food is not the best I've ever had but is certainly excellent--worth the medium/high-level prices you'll find on the menu.  It's not an incredible value, but despite the cost, you won't feel ripped off.  This is, as you'd imagine, a nice place for romantic dinners--not so hyped that it's ever been crowded (in my experience), and they definitely offer up fine Italian haute cuisine with a pretty decent selection of wines.

I loved the gnocchi with duck ragout.  Every once in a while I still get a craving.  The only downside (and the reason I don't eat as much duck ragout as I'd like) is that there are very few vegetarian options (Curses.  Damn you wife and your healthy ways!).", "author": "alan b."}

David and his team do an outstanding job at creating some of the best pasta dishes ever and the wines they have are amazing! This year we celebrated my daughters move into the double digits! I look forward to the day when we celebrate her graduation form 8th grade at Bella's!", "author": "isabella m."}

The staff is 100% Italian and completely unpretentious about it. They are more than willing to inform you the perfect bottle of Italian wine for your taste, and then send you a complimentary dessert. I've been there 3 times now and am always pleased. Their earthy plates are delicious, such as their special risotto with mushrooms and black truffle oil, as well as their vermicelli, but PLEASE don't pass on the penne, it sounds simple enough but once you taste the combination of their amazing Italian sausage and sweet sugo, you won't be upset. The prices are great and the ambiance and music transcend you. It's a great place for an intimate date on the weekend, try around 9pm after the crowd clears out and you'll feel alone, especially if you get the \"mafia\" table. They also have a few tables along the mural wall that is usually merged and saved for large groups, I would say for a party of 16 max. However, this is the one thing I don't like about the restaurant. Granted, it depends on the group, but from the groups I've seen they are rude and loud and completely take away from the ambiance. David, who seems to be the manager/owner is a personable and extremely likable man, just try it and I think you'll be very surprised to find such a great Italian restaurant so far away from the typical fare of North Beach.", "author": "Angie M."}

Ya...I roll in a huge gang...I actually hate large parties.  So luckily the resturant was pretty empty and we got our seats without a problem, no wait.   I ordered number 14...it came with three types of spaghetti.  I'd say it was pretty good....but not really filling.  I thought the service was pretty good, so I can't relate the other yelpers who complained about it.  I even got free dessert on the house.  Well ok it wasn't free.   The male waiter came up to me and somewhat whispered in my ear...\"here I'll make you a deal, we'll give you either a free glass of wine or dessert for your chair\" *points at my chair with my jacket hanging over it*  My friends thought he wanted my jacket....anyways I was about to tell him to take my chair anyways cuz i could easily scoot over and grab a seat next to my friend on the couch/bench.  But my female friend yells DESSERT!  So we got free dessert =).  Best deal ever...although all my friends ate my dessert.  Cuz you know, sharing is caring!", "author": "Nelson W."}

The place has a decent vibe (not great, but not bad); the space feels more Richmond than Italian Trattoria. But, none of that matters once you get settled in. We had a reservation via OpenTable, but rather than put us in a less than ideal table, the owner offered us a couple of complimentary glasses of wine while we waited for a prime spot. We were fine hanging out for ten minutes. We instantly felt like old friends of the owner and were quite happy to be there. When we got to our table, the owner made a point to identify the popular dishes for each course and made us feel completely at home. The service from our waiter was top notch all night. I guess I should talk about the food...it was awesome. My wife is quite picky about gnocchi, and said Bella's was the best in the city. My specialty pasta dish was also great. Prices are moderate and worth it. The only major drawback is no surprise, parking in the Richmond on a Friday night; we circled for about 15-20min.", "author": "Joe C."}

Small and intimate, low lighting, and wonderful music playing in the background at the perfect volume. The service was wonderful, I swear we had 3 people waiting on us! I had the lobster raviolis...wish I got more, they were GOOD! Hubby got their lasagna special that had a pork ragu...yum, yum and yum! Their bread is so good, it's not the typical cold, stale sourdough...this was warm, soft and made you feel warm and fuzzy inside. And they weren't stingy with it either! We got 2 baskets! Both of us had the merlot/red sangria, it was good, not the best, but good. Maybe next time I'll try the white one. They noticed we were celebrating and they sent over a complimentary plate of dessert (have no idea what it was, but it was goooood! There's a picture of it on their site under the menu section, last pic). To top it off, I let them know we had a show to go to and what time we needed to be out by and they hit it...with time to spare! Next time I'm in the city, I'm DEF going back!", "author": "vanessa m."}

I was skeptical. Like most people in SF, I like my own neighborhood spots, I'm a bit of a food snob, and with so much good food in the city it's hard to leave your favorites. Wow was I surprised! I've been back several times in the last few months and find that whether busy or mellow, the ambience is second to none. It's a perfect spot for a date, a conversation with an old friend or a place to make new friends. The service is incredibly warm and hospitable and the food is substantial italian cuisine that never fails to please not only in taste, but variety. The relaxed pace of the service keeps the ambient perfectly Italian and authentic only adding to your dining experience. And I love the fact that I'm supporting a local business owner.  Bella has become part of my regular repertoire. Enjoy!", "author": "Katie M."}

Everything from the decor to the authentic friendly wait staff and the very relaxed atmosphere makes you feel like you are very far away from Geary Blvd.   All that being said, I still think the best thing was the food.  I was able to try a couple of things since there were a couple of us sharing and the food was out of this world.  We had the Vermicelli ala Norcina which was fabulous, the Lasagna with meat sauce was amazing too, great texture combos and flavor. The best thing though was the gnochi. Its not like the Gnochi that you get at most restaurants. Instead of being heavy and filling it was light, fluffy and delicate, definitely tasted homemade, the gorgonzola cream sauce made this dish to die for.  My mom is 100% Italian and an excellent chef so when I say this place is good, I mean it. Highly recommended.", "author": "andy f."}
