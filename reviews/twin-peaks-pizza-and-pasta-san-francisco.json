You're probably laughing at me but once you get into your 30s, nothing sounds more alluring than plopping your hinny onto the couch after work and watching trashy reality tv. \"Thigh brows on fleek\", is the latest thing I learned. So it's cool to have bush sticking out of your panties from both sides?  \n\nAnyhow, we were debating what to have for dinner. \n\nMe: \"What do you want for dinner?\"\nMr. NSS: \"Something cheap.\"\n\nMe: \"I can cook but first I need to shop at the market.\"\nMr. NSS: \"Uhh, shopping and cooking, buzzed/drunk? You'll max out my card and chop off your fingers in the process...what about In-N-Out?\"\n\nMe: \"Umm, I guess--are you driving?\"\nMr. NSS *looks outside the bar to see rain*\n\nBoth of us: \"Pizza delivery!\"\n\nI hate doughy, thick crust pizzas so I came across Twin Peaks Pizza & Pasta on Yelp; they offer thin crust and corn meal crusts (+$1). You can order on their website (there's a $2 off $25 coupon code listed) or through GrubHub but neither offered the capability of ordering half & half specialty pizzas so I called in our order. The woman who took my order was very professional and surprisingly very friendly. I ordered an XL Pizza with Half Spicy Sausage & Honey (w/ mozzarella, mascarpone, parsley + red onion) and Half Twin Peaks (pepperoni, salami, sausage & mushrooms). An XL feeds 3-4 people but we always over order for leftovers. She said, the pizza would be delivered within an hour. It was delivered in 54 minutes. \n\nThe pizza arrived lukewarm so the crust was a bit too chewy but it was better than eating a doughy crusted pizza from other neighboring pizza joints: http://bit.ly/1UXpBDo. My half was the Spicy Sausage & Honey which was a good balance of spicy, salty, and sweet but they were skimpy on the sausage. One of the slices had just one sausage which was a bummer. Mr. NSS' enjoyed his Twin Peaks half which had more robust toppings. \n\nGood pizza aside, my biggest issue was the price. I know everything in SF is getting ridonkulously expensive but I've never paid so much for pizza delivery in my life. Usually, when you do half and half orders, they charge you for the more expensive half. Per their website, an XL Spicy Sausage & Honey is $30.67 and an XL Twin Peaks is $33.66. I was charged $33.66 plus $3.89 for ordering the Spicy Sausage & Honey which is the cheaper half. With tax and tip, our total was $47.84...for pizza! \n\nAhh the price you pay for being a lazy, drunk heffer.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I wouldn't have given this place a second glance if my husband hadn't ordered delivery once when I was out of town and sung it's praises.  I'm just kind of snobby I guess!  Point is, looks are deceiving, don't judge a book by its cover, etc.  The pizza is great and they have such interesting topping combinations.\n\nOur favorite is the Noe Valley: it has cheddar cheese, red onion, bacon, linguica, and cilantro.  Sounds weird AF, right?  It is SO GOOD.  These toppings come together to make the best flavor profile.  I would prefer if they sliced the linguica a little bit thinner, but seriously this pizza is amazing.  We also (almost) always order jalapeno poppers too (why not, right?) and they are very tasty, but can be a little inconsistent.  Sometimes they're better than others, but always tasty.\n\nWe usually order online which is really convenient; they just changed their ordering platform which seemed to erase my account, so that was kind of a pain.  \n\nAnyway, suspend your judgement of the crappy appearance of their store front, they are putting out quality pizzas at this place.

I usually opt to leave no review instead of a bad one, but this place treated me pretty badly, and the food was bad too. Seems like they have some serious ongoing issues. \n\nIf you don't have time to read this long thing, the summary is: the food took forever to get here, our order was wrong, they refused to fix it, they blamed it all on Grubhub, refused to apologize. The food was bad: wings were tasteless, lasagna was pretty gross. \n\nSo we order, and an hour and a half later the food arrives. I figure, wow they must be having a busy night, but I'm glad the food is here. But then I open it and realize they forgot the mozzarella sticks and a few of the wings. I call the restaurant and not only do they not apologize, they blame it on Grubhub! They say that they ran out of mozzarella sticks, but can't update that on Grubhub and their wings order actually comes with 8, not 10 like it says on Grubhub. I ask why they didn't call me when they received the order and let me know what was up (which I would have understood) so I could change my order. They say that it's not their job and that Grubhub should have told me. At this point I was just pretty confused, because they were blaming things on Grubhub that Grubhub is just not in charge of. They got extremely defensive and kept having me talk to different people who work there. My friends were hungry so I asked if we could get some food, like maybe a cheese pizza, to replace the missing wings and mozzarella sticks. They say that they can give me a pizza, but it will take an hour (!), and that I have to pay more because the cost of the mozzarella sticks is not enough to cover the pizza. So at this point they are asking me to pay an extra 5 dollars... and wait an hour for food... after I already waited an hour and a half for the wrong order!!\nAt this point I told them, hey, I'll pay those 5 dollars, and I'll even walk to the restaurant to pick up this food because it seems like the delivery drivers are swamped tonight, but I'm going to leave a bad review. if you are willing to help me out even a little bit, by fast-tracking my order, or refunding my order, I won't leave a bad review. Is it worth it to you? And they said, well it's actually not our fault, it's Grubhub's, and we can't help you. So there you have it, here's the review I said I would give you!", "author": "Maya E."}

In terms of toppings - good selection.\n\nTheir pastas are large and generous, good meatballs.  I love their garlic bread.  You can order beer and wine and have it delivered. The service is prompt and polite.  You can order online via their website.\n\nAlso - if you order on their website instead of eat24, they don't charge $2.00 for delivery and they have coupons.\n\nCons: The $$$.  High for a pizza.  You want more than one topping pretty soon you are looking at a $30 pie, plus tax and tip.  I wouldn't call them stingy with toppings, but given the price, they are certainly far from generous. \n\nSlightly inconsistent.  Of the say, 20 times I have ordered from them, about 5 times weren't as good.  Their pasta sauces can get oily sometimes.  And the free \"bread with butter\" that comes with any pasta dish is lousy.\n\naside:\n\nI wonder if ownership or chef has changed since the last 2 times in a row have been meh.  The Hawaiian pizza I ordered last time was heavy on the cheese and light on the ham and pineapple. \n\nBut tonight kind of took the cake:  Someone manning the kitchen is seriously stoned right now.  I ordered a meatball sub, no onions and peppers, extra sauce.  It came with onions.  And 2 golfball size meatballs.  For a 10 inch sub.  Also, something was wrong with the bread, it was doughy and soaked through, like someone had undercooked it then put it in a sauna.  It was genuinely inedible - too bad because I have gotten it several times before and definitely enjoyed it.\n\nPart of me wants to call and make a fuss, because I am a broke lady, and when I can order out it is kind of a big deal for me.  On the other hand, I don't want to be a dick.", "author": "M K."}

Their crust is the right thickness, and you can request thicker or thinner if that suites your preferences, and the fact you can order online, is AMAZING!  when will more take-out places catch on to how convenient it is to order via a website?  \n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that they have magnets they give you with your pizza's and once you collect 10 you are supposed to get a free pizza.  Well I order from here weekly and it seems like about 1 out of every 3 pizzas I get they actually remember to put a magnet on the box....it would be cool if I didn't have to order 30 pizzas to get 10 magnets.  A promotional deal is a promotional deal and it's something that I feel should should be a priority to make sure every order receives a magnet, if you are going to offer a perk you should be consistent about it.  \n\nAside from my gripe about the magnets this place has pretty good food, and is worth checking out if you haven't eaten there...and if you have well, it's probably pretty obvious why you keep going back.\nAlso, try my favorite!!

I simply shoveled the food into my body.\n\nAfter being open for a few months, and finding half an hour in the middle of my day to relax and eat at the pace of a normal human, I noticed that the pizza from Twin Peaks was really, very good.  The crust, sauce, cheese, toppings - they were all perfect.  I began to visit more often.\n\nDuring one of my visits, while standing at the counter waiting to sign my credit card receipt, I noticed the cook peeling tomatoes and stewing them.  I asked Bruno if what I was seeing was the norm, if they were indeed making their own sauce.  He confirmed that they make their sauce and dough from scratch, and that their cheese is freshly grated.  Their veggies are never frozen, and their meats are from high-quality and reputable ranches.\n\nIt doesn't get better than that.  Typically,  I had to travel to a North Beach Italian restaurant to find pizza of this quality.  Or stand in line for 30 minutes at the other couple of notable pizza joints.  Not anymore.  Now I traverse a couple of blocks and grab a slice from my favorite local Pizza spot.", "author": "Don S."}

Out of that many times it would be impossible for every single pizza and customer service experience to be perfect but I'm giving them a top score because 98% of our deliveries have been fabulous. \n\nYou also get 20% off an order after 10 deliveries. It used to be 25% but I can forgive that with the current economy climate. Let that cook keep his job!\n\nI should also mention that they were only late once BUT it was on a Friday eve after 9 pm.

Their pizzas always featured generous amounts of sauce and mozzarella, and usually arrived warm if not downright hot.  However, for at least the third delivery in a row now, the delivered X-Large pizza featured skimpy amounts of both sauce and cheese, at basically room temperature. They also failed to include one of their little yellow magnets (save 10 magnets for a $20 discount on a future order) with the latest delivery, but I won't be saving or using them anymore.  If anyone were to tell me that Twin Peaks is under new management / ownership, I wouldn't be at all surprised. What a shame - I considered Twin Peaks' the second best pizza in S.F. (after Tommaso's), but not any more.  If you like dry, room temperature pizza with little or no flavor, then Twin Peaks is the place for you!", "author": "Pizza X."}

It looked like a pizza that had been produced for an advertising shot or something -- y'know, like how a big mac in the commercial is totally done up, but the one you actually get at the drive-thru is a sad, messy version of it.  I mean, this pizza had a very definite line across the middle of it, and NONE of the toppings from either half were intermingled.  I was so impressed that I took a picture, which I will post once I download it from the camera.  It was beautiful!\n\nThe pizza itself was decent.  Not the best I've ever had, but good enough that it earns Twin Peaks Pizza a slot in the delivery rotation.

Got it, buddy?\n\nAlso notable:\n*I've ordered from them almost a dozen times with no complaint AND also tried pies from several other promising menus in the neighborhood and due to my focused research and their great track record I refuse to order anywhere else. The bad reviews here seem to be fluke disasters occurring to one-time customers. \n*The internet ordering is totally convenient, especially if you want to pay by card.

My small spinach and ricotta pie had nice fresh toppings, just not enough of them, and not quite enough sauce. \n\nI was glad the crust wasn't overly thick, greasy, and/or doughy like many of the pizzas here seem to be -- it had overall a nice chewy texture, wasn't too thin or thick -- but it could have been cooked a little longer. \n\nBasically, it was a decent enough pizza, and I think I would be more excited about this place if it were cheaper.

Now that clearly wasn't stated in the coupon or on the menu.  She claimed the old coupon had expired, but right there on our coupon it said \"good anytime\" with no expiration date.\n\nWe ordered anyway, but this put a bit of a damper on our excitement.\n\nCue to our doorbell, about 45 minutes later.  Money changed hands and we had dindin in our hot little hands.\n\nAs soon as we both smelled out pizza...well - our mood definitely improved.  We had ordered up a mostly meat pizza - sausage, pepperoni, linguica - and the scent was heavenly.\n\nThe pizza itself was interesting.  Very, very thin crust, which I wasn't quite sure about...until I took a bite.  Good stuff.  The sauce had a bit of zing, and the meat and dough were both cooked nicely.  And because the dough was so thin - I was able to stuff 6 slices down my gullet.\n\nNo joke.\n\nSo yeah - the coupon debacle aside, TP P&P turned out to be a nice little find.

Their salads are big and fresh, and the pizzas are delicious!  Our favorites are the Latina (lots of spicy sausage, jalapenos, and cilantro) and the hawaiian.  But the standbys like pepperoni are also delish.", "author": "Abby G."}

I might be one of the only people in SF who doesn't immediately recycle the menus rubber banded to the front door of my apartment building. Twin Peaks left just such a menu.\nI was very impressedwith their ingredients list- lots of meats, tons of veggies and a selection of cheeses and sauce options. most notable of these was hearts of palm, litterally one of my top 5 favorite food items and a rarity in salad bars as well as on menus- particularly of the pizza variety! \njd picked two meats, pepperoni and salami, while I handled the veggies- hearts of palm and capers with some feta for good measure. we ordered the thin crust as well as took advantage of the awesome make your own salad option- all for about 33 bucks. \nwe only waited about 40min for delivery and it smelled great! when we opened the box, though.... sadness. :(   there was only about the equivalent of 1 1/2 stalks of palm heart strewn about our quite large pizza. the capers were also so far and few between that there were whole slices of the pie which only had one or the other of my toppings on them.\nwhile that really was a major dissapointment, on the bright side, it still tasted good. the sauce was yummy and the crust was perfect (I love crust). also, the salad was fresh and totally loaded... what a refreshing treat, cuz let's face it- delivery salad from a pizza place? that has waaay more potential of going the opposite direction of well! \nI think we will certainly patronize TPP again, but kindly ask for a more appropriate dusting of ingredients!", "author": "saraH c."}

However, after having an impossible time finding good pizza in this town, I realize that Twin Peaks is a four star delivery place for San Francisco.  But in writing this I'm starting to feel that, after three years in this city, I'm losing my grip on pizza reality.  Help!  Anyway, Twin Peaks has solidly good: crust, cheese and toppings.  Nothing to blow you away but good for a night with your lady-friend on the couch watching DVDs.  I'm partial to their pizza with fresh tomato and basil on top.  When I had the pizza delivered, they had an average delivery time AND the pizza was still hot, which is more than I can say for the rest of the places from which I've ordered.", "author": "LF P."}

I really was waiting for that response but the guy who answered to phone decided to take our order. I told him he didn't have to if he didn't want to, I didn't mind and then I gave him a minute. He still wanted to deliver to me. I had just come home from a long day of work and then a bit of drinking with friends. Then I realize half an hour after he gave me a 35 minute wait that I didn't have enough cash and he didn't give me the total. I called back really scared because I though that I had just messed everything up but he was soooo nice and let me give him a credit card after I agreed to tip in cash.

We walked in, noted the almost-empty space, asked how long it would take for a slice, and were told 5 minutes. \"Perfect!,\" we said, knowing I had to be downtown for a rehearsal and was planning to hop on the J after a quick bite. We paid at the counter and sat down with our beverages.\n\n5 minutes go by, then 10...15...we ask if it'll be soon. \"Yup!\" 20...30... 45 minutes later we asked if we could have our slices to go. I wolfed mine in the car as my companion drove me to rehearsal. The staff apologized weakly but didn't seem concerned.\n\nWTF? A slice of pizza should never take 45 minutes.

A few bucks less expensive than the competition. But no bargain. We ordered a large pizza. It was scimpy on sauce, the cheese was minimal and the artichoke hearts had been pulled apart so that just a few single leaves were spead on the pie. All the ingredients including the pepperoni was applied stingily. The crust was not bad but very mediocre. We will stick with our usual Haystack, Nizario's, and Cybelle's in the future. There's a lot of good pizza in the neighborhood . Sadly, this establishment  just does not stack up.", "author": "Bob J."}
