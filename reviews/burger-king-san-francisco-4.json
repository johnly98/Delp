This place needs a serious makeover plus they need to figure out a way to keep the bums outside. I mean, if I could, I would help each one of these poor people but this needs to be done in a certain way that will keep them out. I mean this place has practically became a homeless shelter and I seriously didn't feel safe. Other reviews here say there is a security guard, I didn't see one or at least didn't feel the presence of one. I basically took my sandwich and went out because I didn't want to stay in there. Also, they gave me a receipt with just the total, not the items and I only found out when i was too far to come back. Please make sure you hand the right receipt.\nThere are very nice, clean and modern BK branches all over the world. Recently I happened to be in a BK branch in the Madrid airport which is even hard to believe is the same chain as this.", "author": "Gil S."}

After I ordered my food, I was standing next to the security guard waiting for my order to be called. The guard walks over to a cleaning station and uses one of the sanitized table rags to wipe down his boots. I could not believe what I was seeing, I was so disgusted and then he put the rag back in its place. \n\nAfter about 2 more minutes of waiting, the employee calls my number. I grabbed the rag he used from the table and took it with me to the counter while getting my food. I put the rag on the counter and told the employee what the security guard had done. She seemed a little confused; I don't know if she understood English very well. At that point, I was starting to get a little irritated so I just grabbed my food and left.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-30", "description": "This used to be the \"scary\" Burger King where the hobos hung out that no one went to when you were walking to Uniqlo to get some cheap shirts on the way from Bart. You always thought it was pretty cool since it had arcade games in there but you never wanted to go in since it looked hella sketch.\n\nThen things changed.\n\nSome time after, this Burger King got renovated, and now, it looks a lot cleaner, even if it has the same people plus or minus a few Asian families.\n\nI decided I was craving Burger King today, primarily because I've been on Facebook and all they kept showing me was Chicken Fries and the Dr. Pepper shake, and that had me really thinking, \"Can anyone do a Dr. Pepper Shake?\"\n\nI knew I had to find out.\n\nI went to order, and I saw that there was also an Angriest Burger. I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I decided to just order that plus the chicken fries and shake. The total came out to be $14.97. I just spent $15 on Burger King. That's basically how much I would spend on real food in San Francisco, or the equivalent of $15 McChickens back when they were $1 on the dollar menu give or take a McChicken because of tax. \n\nAnyway, before starting any good Burger King meal, I knew I had to locate the restrooms. I found the bathrooms, and noticed that you had to pay 25 cents to use it. As someone who refuses to carry cash, I was screwed. I guess it exists to dissuade hobos from building a fort or something in there. Luckily, right as I went to the door a nice Asian lady and her young son came out and held the door open for me, and it was one of those cosmic moments where you see someone in need and you know it's the right thing to help them out and she came in and helped me out. This gives me hope in this world.\n\nWhen I came out from the restroom, my meal was ready, and I was ready to eat. As I took my seat, to the left of me was an Asian family bickering about who to order, and the younger boy was like, \"I'm a kid I don't have to order. You're a teenager so you have to order.\" But the mother made her two kids order. They were probably staring at me like a strange human being since I had three huge items and I was by myself.\n\nI started with the Angriest Burger. I've gotta say it couldn't even be classified as an Angry Burger.\n\nThen I got to the chicken fries. They weren't as good as I remembered them in my youth, and I was basically stuffed with the so-called Angriest Burger.\n\nThen I grabbed the Dr. Pepper Shake for to-go. I was amazed that it tasted like Dr. Pepper, but it's one of those things where you'd rather have an actual Dr. Pepper. So on a scale from 1-10, I would rate it \"It tastes like Dr. Pepper but you'd rather have an actual Dr. Pepper.\"\n\nOverall, it was a good experience, and sometimes, it's not about the food, but the journey, that makes a restaurant memorable.\n\nTIP: Get the Dr. Pepper shake. It's interesting and worth giving a try if you consider yourself any sort of fan of Dr. Pepper.", "author": "Brian L."}

I was charged extra for pickles, while I asked for the lettuce and onion to be removed. So much for having it my way for the price they offered. Wasn't told it would cost more...in fact the woman barely spoke English. When I asked her what was on the Chicken Sandwich, she looked at me blankly. When I got my Whopper, it was smothered in white sauce...absolutely disgusting. We're talking extra extra...no standards whatsoever. So far apart from their parent company, it should even be called Burger King. The Chicken Sandwich was similarly disgusting. Overcooked. Tasted nothing like the sandwich it should have tasted like. The bun was stale...as if it had been out for over eight hours. It didn't taste like any sort of recognizable chicken and was a ruined sandwich. To top it off, they charged me for a bag when I told them I didn't want one AND they don't accept Burger King coupons...a true example of a place that has the logo, may purchase from the distributers, but says forget quality.

I really liked the croissan'wich a lot.  It tasted pretty good, comes with egg, cheddar cheese, sausage patty, and light croissant buns.  I'd say it's better than an egg mcmuffin.  The bun is a little on the soft side, but I still enjoyed it.  However, my gf says it's too soft and oily.  The croissant absorbs too much oil.  She rather have an egg mcmuffin.\n\nThe other coupon was for 1 order of french toast sticks with maple syrup for $1.  I didn't like the french toast.  The texture is good though - crispy outside and soft inside.  The syrup is on the runny side - not as thick as I would like.  There's a hint of cinnamon taste on the sticks which I really don't like.  It's too sweet and cinnamony.  My gf really liked it though, she recommends you guys try it out!\n\nThe newly rennovated place is nice looking.  Drinks are not self serve, but it's a nice big area.  The staff was friendly.

Then I ordered the tender grill chicken sandwich combo. Whopper (1)  ONLY had cheese and bacon on it. Whopper (2) HAD lettuce and cheese added to it. Instead of the tender grill sandwich, they gave us something called a \"Chicken Burger\".  When my wife called to speak to the manager concerning our order that we'd brought all the way home, the 'so called' manager tried to insinuate that we were being dishonest about the errors of our order. Basically, they felt we should get back out in the rain to bring them the food to prove our point. I live 1/2 mile from 35 Powell St. It's raining. If they can't take my word for stating the errors they made, I can just simply eat elsewhere next time.  I won't be going back here.", "author": "Damon W."}

And triple or quadruple your security until these elements get the message to stay out. This is a restaurant. Not a mental hospital or a shooting gallery for the area junkies.

All these things are fucking awful, but they don't compare to the biggest turd in this giant shit-pile: they don't have a fucking dollar menu!
