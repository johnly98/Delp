This one, across the street from the Hyatt Embarcadero, deserves a shout out for good service on September 15.\n\nWe had 30 minutes or so to kill while our room was being cleaned and wanted to avoid pricey drinks inside the hotel. Starbucks was the answer as I can always expect a certain standard -- and I had a gift card in my wallet.\n\nAll I wanted was a simple grande lemonade iced tea.  But they were out of lemonade.  The barista said he would substitute with mango pineapple (or was it mango papaya?). I was dubious, but thirsty.  It was surprisingly tasty.  When the barista saw I had finished and was lingering at the table he brought me a second one on the house.  Didn't get his name, but appreciate his friendly service.\n\nI imagine on a weekday this place is bustling.  Not very busy on a Saturday. It is a bit more airy than some Starbucks.  The old red brick wall on one side is a San Francisco touch as was the one oddly dressed gentleman who was talking to himself. I thought perhaps he was rehearsing lines for a play ... but don't think so.", "author": "Elaine P."}

My cousins and I came here before heading back to Bart, we had a very productive day in SF. We were in line for over 15 minutes and there were only 4 people in front of us, ridiculous. Then we waited 20 minutes for our drinks, and people who ordered after us started getting their drinks. We finally got 2 of our drinks (there were 4 of us) and we asked for our other two, and then the barista said she forgot to add our cups to the line of drinks to be made. Seriously unacceptable. On top of that, the baristas were rude and did not apologize to us. We just asked for our refund and left. I have never had such a terrible experience at Starbucks, and I will never return to this location.\n\nMy advice to management: hire people who actually care about their job, and properly train your employees. The employees there were just terrible. I didn't get names, but one was a short asian guy, a white girl with blonde hair, and a taller white guy, with dark, shoulder length hair - who was the most arrogant of them all. \n\nIf I could give this place negative stars. I really really would. \n\nYelpers, there is a Starbucks on almost every corner of San Francisco, avoid this location!", "author": "Kirstie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-09", "description": "Sigh... starbucks has really gone down hill in general.  The issues at this particular starbucks (the 1st 2 of which seem to affect most starbucks):\n\n(1) The iced coffee is watered down (seems like about half the starbucks out there don't know how to create proper iced coffee).\n\n(2) The internet is totally freaking unacceptably horrible.  I often have to tether to my mobile device to get reasonable connection latencies at starbucks.  Over wireless.  Part of the problem is that the provider (AT&T) backhauls the traffic through Texas.  So stupid.  Given the downfall of libraries in California, starbucks is often the only place in the evening to do work on my computer.  So it's pretty frustrating that their internet is totally useless.\n\n(3) The bathroom was closed for 30+ minutes within an hour of closing for \"cleaning\".  But the cleaning bucket was just sitting there, not being used.  Why can't they do that kinda stuff after they close?  When I worked a retail customer service job we were not allowed to kick people out, we had to let them complete their shopping and they had up to 30 minutes after the \"official\" closing time.  Now-a-days it seems I'm always being shooed out of places before the bell has even rung.  Here a basic facility was not available for many minutes before closing, which I'm assuming (I may be wrong) is because they wanted to do that work *before* closing so that they could leave as early as possible.  It's possible that someone destroyed the bathroom and hence they were doing us all a favor.  But given the overall slip in retail customer service, as well as the ridiculous amount of time they spent not finishing the work despite no customers being here, I believe my assumption is correct.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-06-17", "description": "I have been coming to this Starbucks sporadically over the years and the service and product have been acceptable until now. On Friday, June 14, 2013, I went with a coworker to pick up our regular drinks. I ordered a Grande Iced Coffee and she ordered a Chai Latte. Here are some bullet points to summarize our experience:\n\n- Cashier: Extremely slow with no sense of urgency.\n\n- Barista (Carlos): Rude with no attention to detail, no common courtesy, very poor customer service.\n\n- Product: Extremely poor quality.\n\n- Summary: When my iced coffee arrived, there were coffee grounds all over the lid; I thought nothing of it until I poured half & half in my coffee. To my surprise, there was a layer of coffee grounds at the bottom of my cup (about an inch thick). I promptly tossed the lid and handed my cup to the Barista (Carlos), politely pointing out the coffee grounds and requested a new one. He looked at me like I was inconveniencing him, took my cup to the sink and rinsed it out, poured iced coffee in it (didn't even apologize), and handed it to me (water all over the cup, because he didn't even dry it off). My new iced coffee was so light, it looked like iced tea. I tried to be positive and just poured some half & half in, and took a sip - it tasted like water with cream in it (basically no coffee whatsoever). At this point, I had already been away from my office for over 20 minutes, so I wasn't about to ask for a third one and sit around and wait for it. Instead, I asked for a comment card (Carlos said they were out), and went back to work and threw out the iced coffee. On a side note, my coworker's Chai Latte was poorly made as well.\n\nOverall, this experience was so negative that I have decided that I will no longer purchase coffee or any product of any kind at Starbucks until they make significant staffing improvements. There are so many hard-working, courteous people looking for jobs service and it seems as though the only ones that get them have absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever.", "author": "Holly A."}

Directly across the street from the Hyatt?? My husband and I, my brother and his significant other decided to stop by on our way from the hyatt to the Embarcadero parking garage... we walk in and immediately, my brother says he cant wait in the LONG line because they had to make it home to catch fireworks. We say our good byes while waiitng in line.  the line for the bathroom was as long as the line for the drinks.  Lucky for them peeing doesnt take as long as ordering your drink. \n\nThe only reason they are getting a 3 star rating is because I work for starbucks myself and I know what its like to be inundated with customers close to closing time and with not enough partners on the floor. with that said, it was pretty bad.  Messy spills all over the place, which were at this point dry and sticky because they had been sitting so long, I noticed that the person was emptying out the pastry case while i was still in line.. .(Oh Oh Oh . . . Dont dump that I was looking for something sweet to snack on... oh too late) and the line was to the door.  \n\nto top it off, i ordered a tea and i pay the 0.40 cents extra to get that extra tea bag and I didnt get it.  When i go to the front to ask them to give it to me, he did, but it seems like noone wanted to be there (honestly I dont blame them, but if you are grumpy, i am grumpy) \n\nthe person on bar did offer a bit of a smile, and he was very accomodating making sure that my caramel white mocha was made the way I wanted it.  \n\nI hope you all have a better day tomorrow!! :P", "author": "Jennifer S."}

A nice beverage, a good book, and I'm all set. The staff is very friendly and the manager really makes sure they provide good customer service.\n\nI remember one afternoon, someone - who I assumed was the manager - called every staff member one by one and discussed their work ethic and overall effectiveness of customer service. He pretty much gave them scenarios that may occur during the typical work day and asked how they would handle that particular situation, and then offered feedback. Not that I was eavesdropping, but they were sitting very close to me and I couldn't help myself but hear what they were talking about.\n\nI'm sure they chose to do this right in front of the customers so that people would know that they take customer service seriously. And...well...it worked. =) Customer service at this Starbucks is great and the cashiers strike up conversations with customers quite often, which is always nice and friendly on their part.\n\nI'm not going to review their beverages and food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-01-27", "description": "I know it seems silly to review a Starbucks, since they can't possibly deviate wildly from one to the next, but I have a special affinity for this particular location. Starbucks initially took over the world by exporting their comfy coffee shop atmosphere to even the most banal locales, but few of them actually retain that comfy feel like the Drumm St. one does. They actually have overstuffed couches and easy chairs, so there are almost always people in there reading, talking, or glued to their laptops. It's also a great neutral ground to meet someone you don't know (like potential roommates) for the first time. Kind of like a real coffee shop. \r\n\r\nIt's nicely located on one of my favorite wierd little blocks of the city, both around the corner from a bunch of office buildings and right across from the Hyatt and cable cars. So I think they do just as much tourist business as corporate slave business. \r\n\r\nPlus, if you know me, you know I'm a huge sucker for exposed brick.", "author": "Megan W."}

It starts with the staff, which is as good as any Mom and Pop store you will come across.  And because the staff is so good, the drinks come out better.  Never watered down, never too sweet or too bland.  Even when the lines are at the end of the store, the drinks are still made quickly and effeciently.  They also have a lot of chairs, which is something I love in coffee shops because I tend to roost and enjoy my caffeine.  I still have my favorite mom and pop coffee shops, but I have yet to find one in the Financial district in which I can sit down and not feel like I am sitting in a closet filled with people.  A great staff that takes what Starbucks can offer to the max combined with actual elbow room makes this the BEST Starbucks in the area.", "author": "Patrick F."}

It was the morning of the Bay to Breakers and there were only three employees.  This is, of course, the one Sunday morning that they could take in mind boggling revenue limited only by how fast they punch the register and pass out the goods.  Instead the line went all the way back to the door and I saw a constant parade of folks open the door, take one look at the line and move on.  It was like clockwork.  Every 10 seconds the door would open and a potential customer or group of customers would start to enter, notice the line and immediately exit.  The occasional die hard would join the line and so an equilibrium maintained the length of the line exactly equal to the distance from the counter to the door.\nSpeaking of die hards, when I arrived at 6:40AM the line was exactly at the door.  I squeezed in and began to examine the line to confirm that my running partner had not yet arrived.  As I got half way through the line my cell rang and I answered: \"May I take your order please?\"\nEven stressed by the throng of caffeine seekers, the employees were friendly and professional.  One took orders and wrote on the cups, one collected the moola and the third employee operated the caffeineOmatic machine.  As I place two napkins and two cups of coffee on a table my friend walked in right on cue.  The most amazing part of this experience was the music that was playing the whole time.  One of the aforementioned excellent employees had put on some lovely gospel music sung by Mahalia Jackson.  It reminded me that Bay to Breakers or not, it's still Sunday morning.  It also reminded me of my grandmother.  Thank you.", "author": "Ron R."}
