Our regular Indian place (which shall not be named... though if you look at my reviews you'd find it) betrayed us. They were amazing and then they were not, so we needed to find a new regular... and Lotus quickly became it.\n\nEverything is amazing. Saag panner for me is a staple and litmus test for a good Indian place. They do it exactly right here. The spinach is fluffy! FLUFFY! How do they do it? I don't know.\n\nOther stuff that's good: Bengan Bartha, Tikka Masala, Navrattan Korma, Coconut Shrimp, Tandoori Lamb. All amazing. They'll also make whatever you want that's not on the menu, so we requested Malai Kofta and they made it for us! And it was spectacular. Now it's one of our regular dishes we get.\n\nThe staff is very nice, and appreciative of our regular-ness. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice. It's not hole-in-the-wall, but not super fancy. Just a great place to have dinner any night of the week.\n\nOne thing I'll say is that \"Medium spicy\" is kinda spicy. We still like it this way but it catches us off guard sometimes. :)", "author": "Bonnie H."}

So the place was not busy whatsoever. When we arrived we were quickly greeted and sat down.\n\nFood: I ordered the Chapati and Bengan Bharta. The Bengan bharta was not vegan so I asked the server if he could make it vegan and he said yes. When I got my food, I was extremely excited to try it because it looked so delicious! I first tried it with my chapati bread and it was so delicious. I definitely loved the spices with the eggplant. The flavor was so exceptional! I also tried it with brown rice and again amazed because it genuinely tasted that good to me. I'm definitely glad I ordered the Benga Bertha! \nMy boyfriend ordered brown rice, fish tikka masala, and naan. He said his fish tikka masala was delicious. Overall, we really enjoyed our food. It was definitely a 5/5 for me!  \n\nService: From the beginning and end of our meal the service was spot on. Everyone was so helpful and kind. Especially when I asked for my dishes to be veganised. The servers were extremely spot on with the timing on asking us if we needed anything. It's such a small aspect but I really enjoy when they wait for all the food to be cooked and then serving it to us. Such a great experience with customer service!\n\nThe atmosphere of the place was quite relaxing! The decor and the look of the place was pleasing. Additionally, the whole restaurant is really clean!\n\nI definitely recommend this place because the food is just very delicious, the place is clean, and the customer service is spot on.

Places like Deccan Spice (review: http://bit.ly/2IvTrj2), Ritu (formerly DUM) Indian Soul Food (review: http://bit.ly/2Mx1i1Z), and Aslam's Rasoi (review: http://bit.ly/2tAeImW) impress with their diverse executions and tasty results. I came here for a quiet lunch after perusing appliances at Cherin's nearby and honestly didn't think Lotus SF was quite in the memorable category.\n\nThey have all the expected dishes on their menu - curries, biriyani, naans, tandoori - and they offer lunch specials worthy of attention. I decided to go for the reasonably priced $11.95 Tandoori Chicken Lunch Special  because it was dark meat only, definitely my preference. It certainly came with a lot of extras which in heftier days would have been a plus but now just seemed more like a carbalooza. First came a basket of naan that was enough for a family of four, none of whom could afford to be anorexic (photo: http://bit.ly/2yMAXv9).\n\nThen came the tandoori chicken leg and thigh, a medium-size portion though a bit over cooked as it lay sitting on a bed of saut\u00e9ed white onions (photo: http://bit.ly/2tBGtLT). This came with a cup of dal (photo: http://bit.ly/2KqiRnf). But wait, there was more. On another plate were a salad, a big helping of basmati rice, and a huge samosa, very crusty from its bath in the fryer (photo: http://bit.ly/2N4hw3K). It was a lot of food, and if you're looking for by-the-numbers execution, this place was as good as any. But portion didn't rule out everything else for me as I felt mixed on the results.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...lots to eat at lunch but it was light on poultry and way heavy on carbs\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the decor was quite nice in a traditional way\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...very quiet and efficient and a lot of guys on staff at once\nTOTAL - 3 stars...middle-of-the-road Indian food in a 'hood with a whole lotta strong South Asian choices", "author": "Ed U."}

The first (and least important) is its ambiance. The setting manages to combine many traditional Indian architectural designs in a way that's incredibly aesthetically pleasing, and sets a great tone for your meal. My Mango Lassi was served in a brass mug akin to what you find a Moscow Mule in, and the bowl of fragrances that dotted my table smelled fantastic.\n\nThe service was also phenomenal, the waiters moved with both smoothness and professionalism. I was very impressed by their ability to ensure that my meal ran smoothly without being intrusive or disruptive in any way. \n\nThe food however, was definitely the best part. I've been to quite a few different Indian restaurants in the city and Lotus is currently my favorite. (Current rankings: Lotus, Pakwan, Raavi, Shalimar, although they all do different things well between tandoor meats, curries and biryanis). My palak paneer had an amount of flavor that I don't traditionally find in a lot of Indian restaurants I go to. The spiciness was also appropriate, and I have no doubt that people who are chasing a truly fierce Indian curry could find their niche here. Overall, I was very impressed by the level of expertise and thought that went both into my food and the experience itself.", "author": "Samuel W."}

The best part about this restaurant is their attention to the different diet restrictions that people have and attention to where they source ingredients from. Everything here is organic and everything can be made vegan or gluten-free, which I find awesome even though I myself don't have these restrictions. The decor is warm and inviting, the food is nourishing and tasty, and service is friendly and attentive!\n\nWe ordered the chicken tikka masala ($13.95), lamb seekh kebab ($17.95) and garlic naan ($3.95). The chicken tikka masala was delicious! I loved that the sauce wasn't as creamy as at other restaurants and therefore tasted more like home-cooked Indian food. I just wish they gave a few more chicken pieces given the price you are paying. \nThe lamb kebabs were the absolute WINNER though. The meat was SO flavorful and perfectly cooked and came on a platter with yummy roasted onions and bell peppers. It was finger lickin good and I'd highly recommend this dish. Easily best kebab I've had. \nGarlic naan was also fantastic. It was the right level of thickness and crispness. \n\nI really enjoyed Lotus SF and can't wait to come back and try a few more dishes :).", "author": "Sabina S."}

We decided on Lotus SF after we both agreed we were hungry for some naan and curry. The interior is very pink and a little dim and kind of cute in a grandma's-living-room kind of way. It was kind of quiet and the decor may be a little bit confused, but the star of this review is the food. \n\nFirst off, the naan here is insanely good. They have so many different flavors of naan we ordered three because we couldn't decide haha. We got the garlic, pesto, and onion naan and they were all phenomenal. Hot and crispy and a just a little bit fluffy so you could soak up curry without it turning into a soggy mess. If you plan on getting any curry dish here, please don't play yourself by not ordering some of their naan. \n\nMy favorite dish we shared here was definitely the Chicken Tikka Masala. It is SO GOOD!! I have to admit, I don't remember the other dish we ordered because it has been shuttered out of my memory after the Chicken Tikka Masala took my mind and soul, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it haha. \n\nThis is a place I am definitely going to see myself back at in the near future!

For $12.95 you get a small portion of food and then you pay extra for rice. My friends and I got bengal bartha and Chana masala and honestly both dishes were pretty flavorless even after adding salt and side sauces. I'm actually surprised this place has such a high rating on yelp. It was the most underwhelming Indian food I've had in San Francisco and maybe ever. I don't like to leave bad reviews but hopefully this will inspire some improvement on the kitchens behalf.", "author": "Margaret D."}

If I was rating on service, it would be a 3.\n\nI get it just opened, and I forgive restaurants all the time when they first open IF they are crazy busy.  It was quiet.  We got here at 8:30, they close at 9:30.   Never asked if we wanted dessert, the bill just arrived.  Service was perfunctory.  I like friendly.  \n\nThe food - food was good!  It was great blends of spices, and it was nice to have non-gmo and organic offerings. (And if you choose, gluten free if that is a concern for you!). The portions are not precious but not abundant.  Figure a main per person and no leftovers.  We had the veg pakora for an appetizer, shared, and the Chicken Punjabi curry and Lamb roganjosh as mains.  We asked for spicy, and for many, it likely was, but for us, the spicy was a 6, when we really wanted an 8.   However, better to err on light than too heavy. \n\nThe decor is great!  Ambiance is great!  Pricing was very reasonable considering the rents I am sure they face.  We will go back, when we need a break from the repeats we already have, as we are regulars to 4 Indian restaurants already.  For us, a place really has to step up to replace our usuals. \n\nThey deserve your business, but I'd love to see them step up the service a bit to make it a little more special.  It has the potential for sure!", "author": "Todd M."}

My favorite thing by far is just the fact that they actually cater to us spicy-intolerant noobs who can't even handle hot cheetos by asking what level of spice you want when you order. I've only had the butter chicken here so far but I think it's super tasty! The pesto naan was interesting but I still prefer garlic. The naan is a bit chewier/stretchier than I'm used to / prefer, but again- not an expert on Indian food. I also really like that at least so far (since they've only opened recently), it's really easy to get seated right away.

Indian popped up as a top cuisine so I thought a quick walk to the Naan & Curry on 3rd & King would work. Then, I came across Lotus SF. Lots of stars and rave reviews. \n\nHopped in the car and headed towards the Mission at 8:30pm on a Thursday. Normally, parking is tough to find based on the time and day of week, but was plentiful and to our surprise. \n\nThe exterior is clean with big windows showing you these beautiful upholstered chairs and tables ready for you inside. A white stone elephant greets you next to the front door, as does a smiling server upon entry. We were surprised, and for a quiet night, we chose a window seat and was equally thrilled at seeing the deliciousness inside their menu.\n\nWe chose garlic naan, basmati rice, palak paneer and a organic chicken coconut curry (extra $1.50 for organic chicken), a cup of mango lassi and Sonoma Zinfandel. We were NOT disappointed. The food came out fast and filled our noses with the most delightful smells. It was beyond what we expected and I can easily say that their food is by far the best I've tasted in SF. Granted, this is based on ordering 4 dishes, but you can be damn sure I'll be back to try everything else on their menu moving forward. Server was super attentive with water and checking in on us. (Yay!)\n\nBut this review isn't just about the restaurant, food and service. While we waited for our food, a less fortunate man came in and was looking to dine. After listening to him talk, it was clear he was not sober; the service from the staff was heartwarming. After informing him they couldn't serve him, they sat and listened to him talk. About nothing and everything. My BF and I felt bad, so we asked the server to get him a soda and some food, and put it on our tab. The server went in the kitchen and came back with a box of chicken, rice and water. The gentleman thanked him and left. The server came over and thanked us for our generosity and said it was his duty to take care of the community they were in, but more importantly the patrons inside that supported them. Wow, human kindness DOES exist. I was touched. This made me appreciate the restaurant even more, and all happened before we got our food.\n\nI salute the server, restaurant and what it stands for. Love does conquer all, so get your ass out to Lotus SF and enjoy their savory and perfectly spiced dishes!!!!\n\nPS. You'll find a little surprise on the front of the menu re: Togo orders :) Happy eating!!!", "author": "Heather C."}

So no doubt worth it. \nThe only issue was some kind of spice, either in the rice or the Masala, it could have been a clove, not sure.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-17", "description": "OK, I am *really relieved* to see a new restaurant like *this* one come into my neighborhood! This is really a gem of a place! I loved everything about it - absolutely everything!\n\nWe'll start with the decor, because that's what strikes you first. It's just gorgeous in there, with its pinks and reds and sky-blue sky ceiling (yes, there are actual clouds painted on there!). Such a welcome relief from all the sad (in my opinion), yuppy, cookie-cutter restaurants with their drab, gray, box-y, cyber-y, minimalist decor. You won't find that here! Yes, this is a beautifully decorated place full of bright, happy colors that open your mind up and expand your mental and emotional horizons. The space used to belong to a tile company, so the whole floor is filled with colored tiles - it's so beautiful! All the art work comes from India and our waiter graciously explained all the different meanings and personalities contained in the works. It was really fascinating in itself!\n\nThen comes the food. It could not have been more perfect. First, for those who are gluten-free or have food allergies, you won't find a more welcoming menu. They have the option of gluten-free naan! When's the last time you were able to find *that*?! And they print right on their menu that they care about your health and are glad to make you any dish to order, including something that is your favorite Indian dish that you don't see on the menu! I was wildly excited to get to eat the vegetable pakoras appetizer because, being gluten-free, I don't get to indulge in fried food very often. But these are made with chick pea flour, so they are GF! And they were completely delicious. Our waiter also was careful to make all our dishes to our specifications, asking for us to tell him not just 'mild, medium or spicy' but, \"on a scale of 1-10, is 'medium' a 5 for you or is it a 7?\" We had the coconut chicken dish and the tikka masala (Yum! That was my favorite!) and they even offer brown rice for those who are more health conscious. Their vegetables are pesticide-free - they make a point of telling you that. It was very delicious, healthy food! You can't go wrong here.\n\nBut the most stellar, striking thing of all was the level of service we got. Amit was our server and he just had everything down perfectly! He had the perfect timing of knowing when to come refill our tea cups with yummy Masala chai and when to leave us alone to be engaged in deep conversation. When to bring the appetizer and when to bring the bill. He just could not have been nicer. He chatted with us and explained Indian history a little (brought about by our asking about the art on the walls). He was so knowledgeable and polite. He could not have been nicer and more welcoming.\n\nAnd so I say, \"Three cheers for this new neighborhood restaurant!\" They are open for lunch Tuesday - Sunday which is a plus since there aren't too many healthy, affordable lunch options around here. And yes, I forgot to mention that it is a restaurant that you can still eat at if you're not a millionaire. Very exciting for people like me. And, again, that decor! I'm just soooo thankful to see something new here that isn't black and gray and minimalist and boring! Reminded me of the old San Francisco, when everything had character.

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place from all the great Yelp reviews so we decided to come here for dinner on a Friday night. Upon our arrival we put out names down because it was so busy, but no surprise to us. We patiently waited until it was it turn to be seated. This is when things took a turn for the worst. We were seated and served water and then nothing. No one approached us. We watched tables around us being brought food, orders being taken, and then there was us. My boyfriend and I are pretty understanding, especially since it's a new restaurant, we get that they are still trying to workout a good system. After a 20 minute wait at our table my boyfriend called a server over and asked if we could put in our order & was told that someone would be right over and again we waited & waited. Keep in mind, it is busy, so all around us people are being waited, we did try to flag people down but we were simply ignored as they would just walk past us. Another 20 minutes go by, and if course at this point we have been contemplating walking out, but all the food around us makes us stay. I get up this time and go over to the host and let them know that we have been sitting at out table for 40 minutes and we would like to order. He goes and tells one of the waiters and points at our table. At this point we're thinking finally, so excited to put in our order and get some of that food, but the waiter doesn't come. The host noticed and actually came over and took it order himself. We were happy that things were finally moving along. About 20 minutes later we get out appetizer, and at this point we actually start seeing people leave that we're seated when we were. Boyfriend and I are happy to be eating. Then we sit and wait some more. I understand that the food I being freshly prepared, so we expected to wait, especially with it being so busy, but we were not expecting this. It took almost another 40 minutes for or main dishes to come out & they did not bring out that naan to us until about halfway through the meal. I know we could have left, and honestly we should have. I wish the food would have been worth wait, but it wasn't. The chicken was dry, that rice was cold. Completely disappointed. What made this experience worst was the service. I've never been completely ignored in a restaurant while others around me are being served and waited on. It was as though we weren't there, but when we asked a server for the check they were very quick to get someone to grab that for us and charge. Terrible service with mediocre food.", "author": "Alejandra C."}

I totally go for new and up in coming neighborhood restaurants! This is adorable, cozy, romantically and beautifully decorated. A bit chic too to be honest! Great atmosphere, but above all, amazing service and DELICIOUS FOOD!!! I definitely recommend this place! Their Butter Chicken Masala and Paneer Tikka Masala is to die for!!! Their starters- Chicken Pakoras and Vegetable Samosas are too, as well as the dessert Gulab Jamun! It's honestly like fine dining status, but a fraction of the cost and again, the service is sooooo nice and friendly. I hope they continue to serve us their amazing food for decades to come! If you're like me who supports your neighborhood mom and pop shops, this is absolutely fantastic and you'll love it-I guarantee!!! It's better than those \"hot and trendy restaurants\" that already have a tremendous amount of success. \n\n\nThank you Lotus for your humble and kind service and delicious and memorable dishes!!! We'll definitely be back and spread the word to all our friends and colleagues! By the way, Amit and Binod were our servers and they were SO kind and super attentive and professional! THANK YOU!!! :)", "author": "Bridgette P."}

As someone who eats a mostly vegan/plant based diet, I appreciate that they were up front about wanting to appeal to different dietary needs. I had the vegetarian curry which was delicious. Lots of different veggies and they were cooked very well - not overly mushy or greasy like at some places. My partner really enjoyed the lamb biryani and a chai tea. The service was excellent, and the prices were great considering the high quality of the food and service. We would definitely come back!", "author": "S E."}

I nearly broke out in Hallelujahs when I discovered that they did NOT sweeten their chai. I took home leftovers in the box they so graciously provided, as even I couldn't eat so much food in one sitting.\nALL THIS for $12 (plus a generous tip, which they so richly deserve)!\nOf course, there were other vegetarian options at that price (next time, I'll try the chana masala) as well as meat dishes (chicken, lamb) and fish & seafood (for about $1 to $4 more). I did not explore desserts (but will try the gulab jamon). This is the real deal in Northern Indian cuisine and ambience. (I bet that was the owner I saw standing by.) I can hardly wait to go back for more!", "author": "Patricia K."}
