Neither of us really cared for these. I'm used to Dharmas (capitola, ca) spring rolls and so far no one can beat their product. \nShaking beef bahn mi - excellent \nMeatball bahn mi - extremely delicious \nPork special bahn mi - good but probably wouldn't order this again.

However, size is no judgment factor for Dinosaurs because the sandwiches and spring rolls are all churned out efficiently, are generous in portion, and look rather appetizing. And trust me when I say that this place felt like a literal godsend to me. I don't exactly have positive experiences in this area (woo car break-in!) so I definitely didn't want to wander far. So finding this place just half a block away? Hallelujah!\n\nBut let's talk sandwich. The baguette is toasted perfectly - golden brown with a symphony of crackles. I opted for the special, of course, and found it very filling with its pate, fancy pork, special ham, and all the goods (cilantro, pickled carrots/radish, jalapenos, cucumbers). It hit all the notes of savory, creamy, crunchy, and slightly spicy. Really good. \n\nI do wish there were some tables to sit at though.

I pulled most of it out of my sandwich after a few bites, and that made the sandwich a lot better. If not for this meat, maybe I'd bump this place up to 4 stars.\n\nLocation is also a bit hidden, making parking very difficult.

Finally, I decided to give this little spot a try today during lunch and was super surprised by how great it was! \n\nDinosaurs is located in a little ally across from the Hall of Justice, so a great option if you're on jury duty or (eeek) for some reason over at the county jail.  Walking in, this place is VERY small.  No seating, but for some reason they have a giant pin ball machine taking up a great deal of space, boxes of chips stacked in the corner and enough room for maybe 5 people to stand while waiting on their food.  The menu is fairly simple, a selection of Banh Mi including tofu, mushrooms, chicken, beef, pork, tuna and spring rolls with tofu, shrimp, and pork.  There are fountain sodas as well as interesting smoothies such as avocado and some kettle chips for a side.  \n\nI went for the Tofu and Taro spring rolls with choice of dipping sauce (hoisin).  WIth the 10% off your order from yelp check in they were under $7, which is a great price for the fairly large portion of 3 rolls per order.  The wait time was under 5 minutes for my food, so a great option if you're in a rush at work.  \n\nThe spring rolls were fresh and flavorful.  They were full of tofu, rice noodles, lettuce, cilantro, and mint.  I didn't love the shredded tofu strips - a bit of a weird consistency, but overall good flavors.  Also, I was given the peanut sauce instead of my requested hoisin... I did like the peanut sauce but this isn't what I requested and I could see this being an issue if someone has an allergy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-10", "description": "When it comes to eating Vietnamese sandwiches I'm generally pretty easy to please.  As long as the bread is good and the components are fresh I'll have very few complaints.  That said I was quite thrilled when I found out through Yelp of course that Dinosaurs had opened their 4th shop less than two blocks away from my work.\n\nI've long been a fan of Dinosaurs and I frequented their original location in the Castro quite a bit from 2010 when they opened until 2012; however, subsequent changes to my work schedule have limited my visits since.  The meatball sandwich had been my favorite of their sandwiches.  I don't know what it is about ground meat formed into balls but no matter the type of cuisine I love meatballs.\n\nNot having been to any Dinosaurs location in over a year I was excited to see a larger menu than I remembered featuring 2 types of salads, 3 types of spring rolls, 8 types of sandwiches and 5 specialty drinks.  \n\nOn my first visit I had, of course, the Meatball sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#9iQ1jK28yQla-xm1-CDDrw).  The French baguette they use here was toasted perfectly exhibiting a nice exterior crunch and the softness of fresh bread on the inside.  Piled high with pickled carrot and daikon, slices of crisp jalapenos, fresh cilantro and a crisp cucumber spear with just a smear of mayo and ground pepper the meatballs were every bit as tasty as I remembered with just the right amount of firmness to hold it all together.\n\nOne Vietnamese sandwich rarely fills me up, and at most places I go it takes about two sandwiches to do the job.  So far on my many visits to this Dinosaurs I've found that one and a half would be perfect for my midday appetite.\n\nIn addition to the Meatball sandwich I've also ordered:\n\nThe Special (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#8hobLrGDKjnRZgrgoquC7Q) with three types of pork products piled high.\nShaking Beef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#x1xOCLNQ7n7SzU0amEaX9w) with its super tasty beef sauteed with chopped onions.\nGrilled Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#49fnAJPwAuTXuSY6iZd6PA) with a lemongrass infused chicken thigh.\n\nThe Roasted Portobello (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#vnBkk2FLuCBaPP32c1jJxg) comes with veganaise instead of mayo, but a check of the ingredients found that it was soy based.  That's something I can't have in my diet so the kind folks here have omitted it and given me the regular mayo at my request.  I'm a big fan of mushrooms so it's no surprise that this is probably my second favorite sandwich here.\n\nI've enjoyed the fresh spring rolls also.  The spring rolls come 3 to an order and you can have it with a choice of 3 sauces - peanut, hoisin or lime fish sauce.  My go to sauce is the peanut which has bits of peanut in it, doesn't have an oily residue like some places and has a mild spicyness to it.  The spring rolls are mostly pre-made and chilled, but sometimes when they're out of the pre-made ones they will make fresh ones for you.  I've had both the Pork & Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#iNgoIvKWTna9EMbQTACEXA) and the Chicken & Shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#I6XM9Nsr9_dad3VN_0jt4w) and both are delicious and filling.\n\nThe Shrimp Papaya Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2?select=Yr371eBYQJ23h0jnnL1KQw#Yr371eBYQJ23h0jnnL1KQw) combines shrimp, crunchy daikon, carrots and green papaya with grape tomatoes and a little Thai basil.  Crushed peanuts, deep-fried scallions and a lime fish sauce dressing are included separately to add onto your salad.\n\nTo date I've tried only one of their specialty drinks.  The Watermelon Litchi Smoothie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinosaurs-4-san-francisco-2#SxxF4uow0P2EfBwKixkKEQ) is a blend of fresh watermelon, crushed ice and possibly a sweetener served over bits of fragrant lychee jelly.  The frozen concoction freezes the jelly just enough so what is normally a soft jelly comes up slightly firm.  It's a refreshing drink that I've enjoyed on multiple visits.\n\nIn an area of the City where good eats is very limited I'm so happy to have Dinosaurs 4 so close by.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I drove to Pacifica from Hayward because I'm a foodie and anytime I hear about places I should try, I do it. I don't regret driving far for a sandwich though, well for this sandwich because it was bomb!! Only one thing I wasn't pleased with, I had the grilled chicken and there was some fat on the meat that I wish wasn't in the sandwich but it's not going to kill me especially if the flavor was there. I usually am picky with bones and fat, I took a look inside the sandwich before biting it, and took off all of the fat from the chicken. Anyways, let's not make a big deal of something so small because I'll be driving back to Pacifica to have more next weekend. I'm officially hooked. Both my significant other and I enjoyed our first time there today. The food & their drinks were spot on. Their watermelon litchi smoothie was so refreshing and I seen the girl make it, she used fresh watermelon chunks to make it. My significant other ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and he enjoyed it a lot but after finishing it he also tried the Thai tea which was also very good. We ordered a couple of extra sandwiches for family to go, my significant other ordered another sandwich for himself for dinner too haha.", "author": "Elizabeth A."}

I kid, I kid, I can never get enough Vietnamese food, so I went for a long walk under my green umbrella and finally made up my mind to grab a bahn mi. I was considering Grab 'n Go but felt like splurging a little at Dinos. \n\nThe place is very tiny so you just order to go. The menu, basic but with everything one would need from a Vietnamese sando place. I considered the Grilled Pork bahn mi, but the kindly cashier suggested the Special ($7.39), which is roast pork, fancy pork loaf, lots of pate (yummm), and the usual veggies. I got extra jalapenos which I recommend to anyone who likes four or more slices for your whole sandi.  Loaded up on the Sriracha and napkins, nestled into my new favorite coffee spot, Roma, down the block, and tucked right into my massive meat morsel of magic (like that?). \n\nWhile Dinos is on the pricey side for banh mi, I think it's totally worth it. I was full all day from this meal, my tastebuds were satisfied, all was well in the mini world of my lunch hour. Also, if you check in on your Yelp app, you get 10% off, which I didn't notice until after I paid, but I will be using in the coming days.", "author": "Crystal C."}

Pinball machine is cool too, although, you may bump in to everyone waiting in line if you decide to play it.", "author": "chinyere w."}

I got the grilled pork sandwich, which is like a banh mi sandwich. It was the best I've ever had, and I like to think I've become kind of a banh mi expert in the past couple years. All spots have the traditional ingredients, but the difference is the meat and bread. This wasn't the best bread I've had, it was a bit too crunchy,but the pork...oh the pork. Wow. The flavor and crispness was outstanding. Everything worked together magnificently. Too bad I live 2 hours away. Btw, its tucked in a small hole in an alley right across from the police department hall of justice building. What a great spot!", "author": "Mike S."}

The place is cramped but I go in when there was no line, by the time I left the line was out the door (good timing). I had a special Filipino sandwich and it was delicious. I hope to come back at least every month for lunch, nice new spot!.", "author": "Stu H."}

Service is fairly fast, and the chicken & shrimp rolls with peanut sauce were good/fresh.  I recommend this place if you have jury duty and don't want to eat at McDonald's for lunch ...since you probably got your egg mcmuffin with coffee there in the morning.

Good flavor in the roasted pork; excellent combo with plenty of each type of meat. Both heavy on the mayo sauce and light on the veggies so order appropriately. The vietnamese coffee was strong. Off the beaten path, with no seating.", "author": "Norman H."}

Their salads are super small in size--although I am used to BunMee's gigantic salads, so maybe not a fair comparison. Takeaway only at this location because they opted for a super annoying pinball game that disrupts the line and pick up area when in use. ***Lose the game, put in some tables.*** I love dinosaurs but they are the masters of the odd location.", "author": "James S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-03", "description": "I tried Dinosaurs twice now. The first time I went it was okay, but I said to myself I would never go back because it was so much more expensive than most other bahn mi places in San Francisco. I understand running a business in San Francisco is expensive and most new businesses can't afford to sell lunch for $4.50, but when I go to a place like Dinosaurs that is a less traditional than its ethnic food origin roots I'd like to be more excited by the menu, give me a reason to choose this place over a cheaper more \"authentic\" (I hate this description, but for lack of a better work) option. However, about a year later I was interested in giving it another try - I think everywhere deserves at least two chances! I wasn't disappointed with my shaken beef bahn mi, but I won't be back. There are much better bahn mi options for cheaper, including two places within a block (Turtle Tower and the Vietnamese Grab-and-Go). The dressing was too tangy for my taste and there was way too much mayonnaise. The ice coffee is pretty good :) Its worth a try if you're in the area, I'm sure some people will enjoy it more than myself, just not my preference.", "author": "Asia H."}
