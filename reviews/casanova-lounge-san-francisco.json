I am writing to you with regard to a small establishment of questionable ilk called the Casanova Lounge. I have been on assignment as what is known as a \"secret shopper\" for the past 16 years. I must update you on a small matter of growing concern - the beard of Chris. It has become quite unruly and I see fit to report it to the Better Business Beard-o (see what I did there?). I give his beard 3 of 5 stars, but 2 of those are pity stars. So please adjust my rating according. Good day to you, Yelp. \n\nPS. I am back on assignment as a secret shopper. After roughly twelve dozen visits I missed provide an addendum to my earlier review. \n\nFirst, Chris Campasi \"Make me week in he knees-y\" is definitely the go to barkeep. Dude can duck, jive, crossover, and isn't afraid to take the shot. I've seen this dude drain 3 pointers with a broken clavicle and fractured ribs on a Tuesday. A TUESDAY. Yep.

It's dark and has very cool decor (lanterns, black velvet paintings, couches.) There isn't much seating relative to the amount of people there, and there's also not much standing room. It says you can make a reservation, but I called several times over a 3-day period, left a message, and sent 2 emails. I did not hear back from them until well after I gave up and already went there. They say reservations are for groups of 8+, but I was told that a group of ten was too much for one reservation. It was a very opaque and confusing process that I didn't even hear back about until several days later. I'd say don't bother with a reservation, just show up and wait around until you can swoop a table. The well drinks were really overpriced and it was unclear how to request drinks with higher quality liquor. It was challenging for a first time visitor.

Ah yes, with the grape cluster light fixtures and the naked ladies on velvet, this feels like home to me. \n\nI think I spent most of my time there trying to decide if the lounging nymphet in the painting in the back was Pamela Tiffin, Sharon Tate, or Jane Fonda in \"Barbarella\". The DJ the afternoon Jamie W. and I were there was rad. He played a record of a Mexican mariachi band playing a particularly toe-tapping version of \"The Age of Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\", while they were showing \"Harold and Maude\" on the wall. \n\nWe didn't sit on one of the several naugahyde couches in the back, but they did look inviting in a hallucinogenic orgy kind of a way. The drinks are a buck off during happy hour, so if you're in a particularly psychedelic mood in a hazy shade of winter, I say check out Casanova for the good-time ambiance. Peace out, man. \n\nDRINKS - 3.5 stars...tall ones in highball glasses \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...is that Jim Morrison, man?

However, it was not so crowded that you couldn't get a spot at the bar to order, if it weren't for the pretentious bartenders. \n\nMy boyfriend had started a tab at the bar at 9:30 PM, and at 10 PM, I decided to get another drink. 20 minutes of standing at the bar and trying to catch the bartender's eyes resulted in nothing (the bartenders always seemed to be busy stacking glasses when I tried to catch their eyes, and when I turned to another bartender, they would magically be serving someone else who had just arrived at the bar). After joking with another girl about this problem, I asked my boyfriend to take my spot and try ordering a drink. He was told repeatedly to wait his turn while the bartenders served others who just arrived at the bar. We spent a good chunk of our night 1) trying to order drinks 2) trying to close the tab. \n\nThe drinks weren't too expensive, if you could manage to order them ($6-8 for a cocktail).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-19", "description": "I waited quite a while to write this review.  My apologies if i go all over the place.\n\nMy friends and I started the night off at another venue, but after a subpar experience there, we moved to the Casanova.  My time at Casanova was pretty damn good.  Granted, it became incredibly heated towards the end of it, but the way Mike--i believe the owner?  manager?  someone in charge--resolved my problem, was amazing.  He's a damn good guy.\n\nAs other people have stated, the bathroom is no joke hilarious.  Tons of writing over the wall, and my experience was made even weirder by two guys in the stall yelling to each other in spanish.  I didn't start peeing because they were yelling obscenities and, to be honest, the whole thing was pretty hilarious.  And when i was about to start peeing...they started yelling at me--in spanish, mind you--to zip up my pants and to walk away.  Of course, their statements were... graphic. Suffice it to say, i didn't really listen to them.\n\nAfterwards, the drink i ordered--a red bull/sprite...i don't drink--was decently mixed.  My friends liked their drinks for the most part.  I don't think i can really make any other comments with regard to drinks.\n\nAmbiance though?  Definitely.\n\nCasanova was fairly dive-y, but i really enjoyed the lighting and the burgundy/maroon/brown and reddish tones in the bar.  The paintings on the wall were distracting...but obviously in a good way haha.  My friends and I moved to the back of the bar and sat down on the big, incredibly comfortable, red couch.\n\nThis couch deserves it's own paragraph because it is just SO badass.  It's amazingly comfortable and it is quite big.  I remember sitting down and sinking into the couch--not too much, and not little...the perfect amount.  After immediately sitting down, we all noticed how bouncy it was.  OMG is it bouncy.  I think I was bouncing and dancing to music the entire time we were there (3+ hours maybe?).  My friends and I had numerous conversations about how amazing it is and we started hatching an Ocean's 11 type plan to steal it.  Man, I love that couch.\n\nThe music was awesome too.  There were a whole bunch of classic rock, oldies, and other tunes that one could really dance/groove to.  I reallllly enjoyed the music and I wish i had a track listing of everything played that night.\n\nThe only problem i had though was when i misplaced my hat--i believe behind the couch in the back?--and i couldn't find it when it came time to closing.  The hat was ~$70, but it has an incredible amount of sentimental value to me.  Suffice it to say, things got heated when i asked for more time to search for my hat or if i could just wait inside as they cleaned up/closed, but i wouldn't really let the whole hat thing go.  And when my friends and the staff started talking about how someone could have stolen the hat, i started to lose my cool.\n\nAnyway, i waited outside of the bar for about 30 minutes with my friends, and my homie Mike came outside after he found my hat.  Man, i was so upset and frustrated at the thought of losing my hat/getting it stolen, but Mike took the time to look for my hat after I made things very difficult for him.  He knew how important the hat was for me and--maybe this is one of the reasons why he went out of his way to help me?--we exchanged a few words about Spider-Man.\n\nNext time in SF, i hope to visit this bar and say what's up to Mike.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a chill night with friends and fun music.", "author": "Fai Z."}

As others have mentioned, it's got strange framed naked girl 'art' (that term being very loosely used) all around the walls and is very dimly lit.\n\nBut the type of crowd that comes here on a Friday or Saturday night leaves something to be desired. It gets full of your typical mission weekender, which I find very annoying to be around. But i guess this is probably the case for most bars in the mission on the weekend.\n\nBeer's reasonably priced ($4 for anchor, my go-to), though it sucks that it's cash only.

A good bar IDs at the door. It's how many of the bars do it in California and how all bars do it in more conservative states. We're adults. We understand the need to ID. That's not the issue. The issue is that a group of 30-year-olds were treated like criminals trying to buy alcohol for kids when only two of us wanted a drink. The entire party was made to parade up to the bar from the back where we'd settled in, to show all of our IDs. I cannot repeat this enough - so only two of us could get beer. And all because the owners of Casanova clearly don't understand that most bars successfully comply to all laws by posting someone at the door.

Rather than making me feel I should be looking out for backwards-speaking dwarfs, I felt like I was in the mood for a good dose of cool.  \n\nIt is a divey bar, so there are some precautions you should take.  1.) drink your alcohol out of bottles.  I don't care what kind of drink specials you offer, I am a crazy-@ss germaphobe.  I'm not trusting my lips to your glass washing.  It's nothing personal.  Bottle choices: cider and Pacifico.  I drank Pacifico.  If I were more secure in my manhood, I would have had the cider.  2.) Pictures of boobies on the wall.  It's art, not porn.  3.) The bathroom was a bit of a nightmare.  I'd suggest going when you REALLY have to go and not any time before.  \n\nThat said, I had a great evening here with one of my best, oldest friends and a new, Hawaiian mama jama amiga.  We had great conversations, childish giggles, plastic couches and good drinks/cheers all around.  No matter how old you get, spending a night drinking good brew and talking with good people will make you feel as though everything you're doing right then, right now...is right.  I felt 'right' here.  Like my girl Dusty said, \"you don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand.\"  This place is close at hand.  I think you'll like it.", "author": "Johnny T."}

If that's a problem for you, run back to Walnut Creek. (Sick burn!) However, if that's not a problem and you enjoy $1.50 PBR pints and $6 PBR pitchers at Happy Hour (4-7pm, bitches!), cool and random music coming from the jukebox, and 70s pornish velvet paintings of naked ladies (really, who doesn't?), then the Casanova Lounge is the right place for you. The couches are awesome, the decor is disarming, amusing, and kind of indulgent all at once, and the bartenders are fun, if a little loopy. It's not overtly pretentious, in spite of the street it's on, and, as with so many hipster-infused things and places, if one can shed one's prejudice, it's actually a really awesome, fun, cool bar.\n\nI prefer to get weekday happy hour drinks here, when it's a little hoppin', but I still have a chance of snagging a couch or even a spot in the wikid little \"VIP\" alcove in the back (I loves to sit under that one naked lady velvet painting, oh yeah). On weekends, it's very crowded and standing room only, and that isn't really what I'm looking for in a place called a \"lounge\"--or in any bar, for that matter. But the Casanova is still a fun, cool little spot.  \n\nThat said, I'm more than happy to brave the inevitable headache from drinking happy hour draft PBR, which, for the price, is worth the immediate regret that you feel in your mouth and brain. $6 pitchers don't make it taste any better, and, in true hipster style, the Casanova is too good for Bud Light, which is clearly superior to PBR (as is everything this side of Natty Ice and Steel Reserve), but proud of their Pabst. Go figure. \n\nThis would be a 5-star place if it weren't for the excessive crowding that almost always occurs, as well as the fact that they've recently painted over all of the really cool graffiti in the bathroom, which has long been one of my favorite features of this bar.", "author": "Ashley M."}

When we first arrived it was crowded with a big group, but they left not too long after we arrived (I'd like to think we drove them out) which made the ambiance a little better. After they left, the remaining amount of people left was just right. Definitely your typical Mission crowd, but I was okay with that (good people watching.) \nAfter the Moet, we had a few beers and I personally sampled the Moscow Mule. I have had a few of these in my day, and I liked the version here very much. Some Moscow Mules will kick you in the face with the ginger and then in the back with lime, but I found the one here only really kicks you in the face, and that's how I like it.

As I hadn't seen him in awhile, and never when he's not working, I said okay, I'll go.  \n\nAlthough they probably hate me now, I dragged FOUR OTHER PEOPLE with me, saying that \"hey, something new to Yelp.\"  Funny how the word Yelp turns people into sheep.\n\nAlthough my \"friend\" never showed up (despite assurances from first him via a telephone call and then later from friends of his), we did manage to do a little exploring.

On weeknights, it's a somewhat low-key place for a beer with friends. But on the weekends, it's glutted with tourists, some locals, and people from other neighborhoods or the East Bay. \n\nMy friend djs here once a month on Fridays, and I'm usually hit on by recent grads who want to know where I went to school, or out-of-towners who are looking for a good time. There's a tiny \"dancefloor\" by the jukebox and dj booth that is really just populated with people standing around because all the seats are taken. But that's on a Friday night, when it's absolutely packed, when people walking down Valencia will wander in and out.\n\nOn the plus side, the drinks are usually pretty cheap, with some great deals on beer on tap. And it's conveniently located, right around the corner from where my friend lives and where I can meet friends coming from nearby neighborhoods.\n\nOn the downside: for a dj night, you must know that the speaker system sucks. The sound gets muffled and lost among the din of the crowd that i can almost never identify what song my friend is playing unless I strain to hear it. There's only one stall for the ladies' bathroom, and it ain't pretty. And if you don't like cheesy velvet paintings of naked women all over the walls, you'll feel really uncomfortable here.", "author": "Robin L."}

Yes, the past weekend saw SF and the surrounding Bay Area wrapped in a blanket of lovely, steamy 90 degree love. Ice cold beers were in demand and clothes got sparse. We were celebrating B's birthin' day and by the time we got to Casanova there were plenty of friends there waiting to pour her  the liquid-age-reverser of her choice.\n\nI'll give her this, the girl can drink. She got shit-housed and kept em' coming. The thing is, she hates heels but wore these 5 inch calf-killing monsters the whole night and her 6'2\" ass hadn't toppled over once by Midnight. I made some bets to see who'd be the person that \"bought the shot that brought down the rock.\" But hell no! That girl's liver is made of granite! Goddamn if she didn't Sum-bitchin' drink all those damn drinks and titter-todder home under her own steam. \n\nBack to the bar. Casanova is a hipster hang-out. Mother-Hefer me timbers .....  if every mop-headed bastard in the place was wearing a plaid print shirt with dumb ass tattoos and boa-constrictor tight pants legs stickin' out everywhere. Whatever .... at least most of the people there smelled like they had bathed recently. Thank you hipsters for embracing the concept of western hygiene on a Friday night. \n\nWe did have one bad experience. A big Rasta dude got totally messed up  ..... walked over to our table and basically fell, or rather passed out, on my friend Anna. Poor girl. All I saw were little wiggly hands and feet sticking out from under this huge pile of dreadlocks. Thank God, I was sober enough to pick up this heavy Bob Marley looking bastard and walk him out the door. There is no doorman of which to speak of so I play bouncer and set this weed-smelling mess against the wall outside where he can drool and jibber-jabber to himself to his heart's content. I walk inside and inquire at the bar... \"Where's the doorman?\"  The tiny cute bartender gives me a blank look. OK .... self serve bouncer night it shall be! \nPoor Anna, for the remainder of the night she's totally gun shy and inches away from anyone that teeters close to her.\n\nThe rear of Casanova has lounge type seats and tables in the back. There is a semi-circular bar in the front area. It's not a big place ... but definitely somewhere you and some hipster friends can hang out and yell at one another over the music. Beers are mostly tap, and they only carry one bottle brand, can't remember what though (hee hee). Shots being the mainstay of the day. Beware the smokers outside and the bathrooms inside, both stink worse than a huge freakin' dump, covered in a big ol' pile of crap, soaked in a jug of week old farts. and lit on fire.\n\nOther than that, laugh at the table cloth shirt mafia, and avoid the leaning tower of Rasta .....

The general ambience is loungey, sofas and chairs, naked lady paintings, velvet, dim lighting, what have you.

Nice bartenders, good beer selection and enough black velvet paintings to make a collection.  Best of all a breezy window seat looking out onto Valencia for a pleasant afternoon beer. All ruined by bad fashion, bad pick up lines, and leg humping.\n\nCasanova is a perfect example of why 16th and Valencia can't have nice things.", "author": "Gustie L."}

My friends call this The Chupacabra Incident.\n\nIt was a busy weekend night, the place is packed.  My two friends and I find a spot by the bar, and I claim the only available bar stool.  We hang out chatting for a while when this rather large woman with a little tiny straw hat perched on her head walks up and stops next to us.  I make some comment about how that hat would look comical on my friend.  She smiles and kind of stares off into the distance.  I resume my conversation.\n\nA few minutes later I feel someone pressing into my back (I'm sitting sideways to the bar).  I figure it's just because of how packed the place is, and ignore it.  The pressing increases, and now she's completely behind me when she starts rubbing my back...and slipping an arm around my waist.  My friends finally notice and start cracking up.  I'm trying to maintain composure with no clear escape route in sight, I turn around and ask \"may I help you?\".  I guess she interprets this as me turning around to kiss her, and I dodge that bullet by mere inches.\n\nMy friends, meanwhile, being such the good buddies that they are, decide to leave for the bathroom and leave me alone with the Chupacabra.  I don't even remember what I mumbled as I ran out of that bar.\n\nGreat drinks and atmosphere though.  Maybe I'll come back once the scars of my molestation heal.", "author": "Eugene F."}

We all found it odd that they were doing last call 30 minutes before closing time. But okay whatever, thanks for the warning. At 1:39AM an employee started walking around telling everyone it was time to go. I asked him what time Casanova closed and he said \"We close now\". hmm funny, i thought 2AM was closing time? I was offended that I wasn't given a straight up answer. And they obviously were trying to close early so they could go home. A total No-No in my book, especially on a saturday night when the place is packed. \n\nHe came over to our table and addressed us again saying we had to leave. We had friends in the bathroom so they let us stay for a second.  Minutes later a female bartender came and took our  barely touched drinks away, all before 1:45! I could understand getting the boot if it was 2:15.....\n\nAt that point I asked the rude guy again what time they close. He said \"I know what you're doing man, I know your type, time for you to leave\"\n\nWhat type? The type that asks when an establishment closes? The type that goes to a bar and expects to be able to drink there until somewhere around 2AM? \n\nSo we shuffled out of the door.

Well, the multiple times I've been here, I never seem to really run into any hipsters. They're always over at delirium. You get a much older crowd here, so instead of early 20s, late 20s to mid 30s. There really isn't a lot of interesting people here when I have gone but I'm a fan of this place because our bartender was really nice to my buddy. My buddy had flown in from the east coast and thought it was a good idea to walk through mission late at night to get to his hostel. Bartender suggested he get a cab because it just wasn't a good idea. \n\nAnd my friend who was jet-lagged kept on falling asleep on the couch. Bouncer could have kicked us out but he just kept on telling my friend to stop it. Well, who told you to get such comfy couches?", "author": "James L."}

So we went to the Mission after going to 111 Minna, which was awesome but closes too early.  So after going to the Elbow Room my Misson staple, we decided to hop on over to the Casanova.\n\nAt first I thought it was the Make out Room with a new name because the decor and set up was so similar.  I realized the differences between it and the Make Out Room when I interacted with the bartender who I will call Bruce.  Bruce took our orders, poured our beers, handed over said beers, and then asked for our ids.  After already having given us our drinks he stared at our ID's like he was staring into someone's eyes, after about three minutes he looked over and said he didn't believe our id's were real.   Mine was fine because it's a Cali license, but my two male companions were in question because they were out of state.\n\nAfter telling my friend that he didn't sound like he was from Missouri he said he wouldn't serve us again.  Just like that no more beers at this bar. This would of been ok if our ID's were fake, but they aren't! \n\nOur interactions with Bruce didn't end here either, no he decided he was going to walk past us \"to get something\" and then glare at us while we attempted to enjoy our beers.\n\nFinal thought, Bruce sucks, this was my friend's first trip to SF and it was the night before my birthday...

On occassion Casanova will bring in a live band.\n\nThat all aside, I love the place.  I don't mind the hipster doofs, the decore, or the music.  The drinks are cheep and strong, comparitively speaking, and I really enjoy the large leather couches and the comfort level of this bar.

The decor is fabulous red and black paint meets velvet naked lady paintings from the 70's.

The cocktails are good and the bar staff are usually friendly.\nI love hanging out after work during the week here but tend to avoid it on the weekends as it quickly becomes a hipster and bike fag hangout after 8pm on fridays.

There is something that's changed about this place. I used to live close to the Mission, and it was my favourite bar. It was perfect for what I call active socializing - talking to strangers, flirting with women and water it all down with copious amounts of Hoegaarden.\n\nNow, it is still very busy. But the crowd has gone a little awry. It's a weird mixture of angry Mission locals (try living here, you'd be angry too), and out-of-town visitors. The locals normally congregate upfront  or at the tables far at the back, while the tourists and occasional visitors caucus in the middle, causing traffic jams and other fire hazards. \n\nThe best place to position oneself is right at the semicircular bar, if you can get a seat there. Then you'd get adequate bartender's attention and, if you drink solo, you can rest assured that an attractive member of an opposite, contradictory gender will squeeze by your side to get a drink in no time. \n\nIf you do venture out in the tables area, you will no doubt notice mildly erotic paintings of perfectly-buxom women, nude. They are good conversation starters, although they probably make many women feel self-conscious. \n\nOn weeknights, this place is definitely more or a locals hangout, with loud indie-rock music (or is it classic rock? I am so out of date) spun by bartenders doubling as DJs. \n\nMake no mistake - Casanova is NOT a lounge by any means. Nor would I order any cocktails here apart from Jack and Coke. It is somewhat a dive, although relatively trendy one. Oh, and it has cool lanterns.", "author": "Evg R."}

I liked that they had a decent beer selection (yes, I'm a beer snob) because it seems like an SF bar with a decent beer selection is a rare commodity.(if you think having Sierra and Fat Tire as the best things on tap equals a good beer selection, don't even talk to me, k?)\nSo we had a good time having a couple drinks there, but the thing that irked me the most about this joint was that the music was REALLY FRACKIN LOUD. It was a Sunday night, and NO ONE was dancing. Turn it down for chrissakes. Maybe I'm getting old, but why would a bar want to make it impossible to have a conversation without going hoarse? How the hell is anyone supposed to mack on each other, or chill and have a good time with friends, when they cannot communicate without hand signals?", "author": "Melissa L."}

I have never been so insulted by someone I'm giving good money for booze to! \n\nWe left the bar after the bartender insinuated something to the effect that my friend and I might not be planning to pay for our drinks. This was based on the fact that my friend got up to use the bathroom after she ordered. The bartender screamed at me to go get my friend out of the bathroom to pay for her drink. I thought he was kidding at first. Then I realized he was actually being serious. What a psycho. She came back and asked for her drink. He made some more snide comments to the effect of \"You want a new drink or the one I already poured for you?\" I guess the bartender ended up thwarting our malicious female plans as we *did* end up paying for our drinks only to receive more assholic comments. I wanted to order something else but the bartender took the drink menu away from me and then proceeded to ignore me for the next 20 minutes (not that he was busy, no, just busy being a dickhole). \n\nWe were so insulted that we didn't even finish our drinks and we won't be going back. Seriously a shame because the bar itself seemed pretty cool (good decor, decent vibe if a bit snooty, dimly lit, my kinda thing for sure) and the other female bartender wasn't particularly nice but definitely seemed okay (and way more mentally stable than mr. fuckhead). Ah well, if he hadn't been a jerk to us we probably would have stayed and given him another 10 bucks in tips or so, so I guess it's money well saved!\n\nMy advice: Go to this bar when he isn't working.

A lot of times this is a ladies joint if you go to late or too early with less sausage than a vegetarian pizza unless you count my bf who really doesn't count for y'all.

A dive with some attempt at interesting design (quirky 70s pendant lamps, velvet sofas, and a handful of nude paintings), that reminds me a lot of New Orleans, which I love. A good mix of people, mostly a young crowd, and an occasional sketchball. People seem to be coming in and out all night, which is fun. It's also not too expensive. At times it's too packed, which is a bummer. But if you can snag a seat or bar stool, or a few square feet of personal space to stand, you're likely to enjoy yourself.", "author": "Julia W."}

Just as the europeans set sail in clipper ships on their way to colonize the South Americans and the rest of the southern hemisphere during the 17th and 18th centuries, so go the Marina-ites of the 21st century, launching themselves in late model A4's and BMW's on exciting voyages to the Mission (also largely South American) on weekend nights to pilage, colonize and exploit the Southern Hemisphere of San Francisco.  Remarkably similar cultures, neither the Europeans or the Marina-ites are capable of staying in their own territory or country.  Did the indigenous people of Africa and South America try to colonize Europe? (Well, they certainly didn't go back happily or voluntarily.)

I went here recently on a night of bar hopping with friends, and we stopped in here briefly because apparantly someone really liked the place. It pissed me off for several reasons. Once I got to a certain point in the bar, it was impossible to move in any direction. Not a good thing, since I REALLY had to pee. When I finally headed in the direction of the bathroom after feeling like I was in some sort of a twisted jigsaw puzzle, there was a line of 7 women outside the door. With no choice but to stand in said line, I did, only to find out that once you actually get in the door, there are 3 or 4 MORE women inside waiting. Horseshit. Once I finally got to go and get the hell out of there, I returned to my friends and attempted to jostle my way through to the bar (to no avail). Thankfully, my friends decided to migrate shortly after. Sheesh. The place is decorated pretty well, and it did warrant a pretty funny comment out of a fairly drunk friend of mine when we were there. Thus the extra star. Maybe on our next night bar hopping on Valencia, I'll check this place out again. Maybe.", "author": "Lindsey S."}

They had pint size & strong margaritas for $5 that hit the spot : )  We were able to snag a tabletop near the window for our group so we had to chance to watch everyone saunter in.  I honestly think I found my favorite hood that night, because everyone walking in or walking by was stellar.  The men were polite, kept the ogling to a minimum, and seemed to actually be digging their companions convos and not just looking for ass.  The women were beautiful, as their outfits all had a touch of spunk, a bit of class, and they carried themselves with a confidence that didn't come from how expensive their \"tote\" was.  I actually had the coolest thing happen to me in the restroom:  I was waiting in line and a chick came out with a tallboy Tecate.  I was shocked and asked if they were selling those but she said they just couldn't wait for the bartender, who I admit was slow and snooty.  I told her how cool that was and entered the stall.  All of a sudden, she slipped an unopened tallboy under the door and told me to enjoy!!  I was completely floored!!  I mean, who does that??  It totally made my night and I had to hunt her down to let her know.  Of course, it didn't take long for the bouncer to take it away because of my lack of covertness but I was on a humanity high all night long regardless.

Not available, not safe, not eco-friendly.  So don't.  Beyond that I can walk here, so I don't need to drive!  I don't know what all the fuss is about but most people seem to like it, it's good if you have a group of people around 6-8, but much more than that the feng-shui gets bad.  It's one of the few places that likes to pride itself on being a \"lounge\" so music-wise they try to stick to this theme.  And the red plush environs mixed with the provocative scantily clad portraits of women help it live up to it's name.  The drinks are good, nothing fancy or complicated.

I am not big on DJs either but this is the only place I have found where the DJ's ACTUALLY have real taste and play pretty obscure garage and psych because they love it- NOT because they think it's the hip thing to do (NOTE: I think it depends on whose DJing on a particular night though, too be fair). Now some people are turned off by Cassanova, convinced its some kind of hipster bar!? That is crazy, this place is just a fun spot of regular folks who dig the same kind of bar vibe and there is absolutely no pretentiousness in the air.

Back in the mid to late nineties, I was educated on rock n roll from what continues to be the most amazing jukebox in the city, and it consistently has the best, most passionate rock n roll djs. The fact that on the weekends you have this clueless bridge and tunnel crowd just kind of makes it more interesting. Seeing Fast Eddy on a cigarette break trying to pick up on bubbly blonde girls who look like they just stepped out of Wet Seal is a sight to behold. Dylan profoundly stated to his love in a song \"I can't help it if you think I am odd, if I say I'm lovin' you not for what you are but what you're not.\" Maybe in the same way I love this place because of what it is not. It's not a Marina frat party filled with investment bankers, and it's not the Zeitgeist, which tries so hard to be punk it alienates it's own patrons (Fast, Friendly, Service...pick one?).
