In conjunction with the Exploratorium these artists created a granite hidden treasure that sparks the imagination. This lovely short walk to a truly one of a kind place in all of San Francisco, deserves credit.\n\nI enjoy the walk out, the smell of the sea air. Vista Skylines to the south, sand bars, little beaches, Bay Views, Alcatraz, and the wonders of the Pacific wildlife. At the end you reach a little park made of old building capitols and abandon gravestones. Emerging from them are PVC Piping that meets the waters edge. At special times of the day as the tides change, different pipes are slapped by water and a sound is carried to the seating area. Brilliant. Sit and enjoy this heavenly symphony.\n\nIt is worth the walk and trip to point to view it. I love this place. Extreme chill zone where people from all over the world visit.", "author": "Thomas B."}

Basically the rougher the seas, the better the music! Something Jack Sparrow once taught me! Having said that it's hard to predict the tides, or the surf report, unless you're an avid surfer, or use a thing called \"google\", but hey, it's ok, I came over not knowing the ocean conditions, too. And yes, I surf & google lol. \n\nThe Wave Organ is kinda sorta on the cusp of being urban legend. Some hate on it, some adore it. Others, like me, is somewhere in between. Yet, I'm sure if I did my tide homework I would have had a better experience. The location is in the Marina District on Yacht Road. Since it's where the yachts park, parking can be anyone's guess, unless you're Thurston Howell the III, therefore I'd suggest biking or bus/walking it. To me, half the journey was checking out the sites walking over. It's not that far from Marina Blvd. and the views of Golden Gate Bridge & Fort Mason... simply breathtaking!\n\nI had nothing to do on a quiet Sunday, so decided to do some urban hiking. After walking up to Coit Tower, the Maritime Park, and other spontaneous stops along the way, I decide to take a walk to the Wave Organ. If walking or biking I'd suggest taking the coastal route through Fort Mason. Thank me later! On weekends the Marina can get super busy and crowded, so take your time and watch traffic of all sorts coming and going. Once you reach Yacht Road it's only a short walk over. Keep walking...\n\nFinally, you'll see it at the very end of Yacht Road. Basically large pipes protruding from the ground. Maybe something from the pages of One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Pretty rad actually. Someone as curious as you, or as lost as you, will also be there. For me, I had the honors of sharing time with tourists speaking French, Mandain, and Hindi! Probably more locals during the weekdays, but don't expect a solo trip with Sir Elton John! \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend the Wave Organ, but I'd also suggest coming during higher tides if possible for the fullest effect. Lower your expectations too... although it's considered urban art gifted to San Francisco by the SF Exploratorium back in 1986, it's basically 25 PVC organ pipes that make funny gurgling sounds. The Wave Organ is dedicated to Frank Oppenheimer, the founding director of the Exploratorium, who sadly passed away months before construction began. Another tidbit, is that most of the foundation is salvaged from the old pre-civil war cemetery, Laurel Hill. Perhaps there's some truth to the urban legend here... \n\nOhh, lastly, after sitting in the middle of all those tourists I found out the best way \"to listen\" to the waves was closing my eyes, ears to the pipes, and simply chilling! Maybe this is what's it all about!", "author": "Eric R."}

I took my friend who was visiting and had heard good things about it. The walk over from the parking lot took about 10 minutes, but I can't complain because the views were incredible. We were lucky enough to go on a clear and sunny day so it was beautiful next to the bay, otherwise I don't know if I would be so positive. \n\nWe got to the Wave Organ itself and it was a little disappointing - just a collection of different pipes. We didn't really hear any noises, but it was a nice place to relax and look out at the city and enjoy the water hitting the land. \n\nI looked into it a little more afterwards, and it seems like you have to go during high tide to actually hear the 'music of the sea,' which we must have missed.

On 10/8/2017, when I was heading back to San Francisco from Sacramento, I upon a special place of this interesting hidden gem located within in the Pacific Ocean called, \"Wave Organ.\" This sculpture (made back in 1986) conveys the sounds of ocean waves crashing by hearing various of sound effects at different stations of organs. Tides are pouring in giving various of sounds like rumbling, gurgling, hisses etc. no matter how big or small it is.\n\nLocated far east from the Golden Gate Yacht Club, this centerpiece was part of a possible construction until it got halted and salvaged because they decided to keep the stones forever of the former Laurel Hill Cemetery. The organ designer and exploratorium, Peter Richards created this centerpiece by resembling the designs of Wave Organ with the help of sculptor George Gonzales to complete this project. As of today, it still lives here giving it a fantastic panoramic view of the Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Mason, Crissy Field even the Marina Greens.\n\nI was ecstatic that I was enjoying the whole view of Wave Organ. It's much calming and relaxing as I was roaming around for few hours by showing various of yachts, boats, cruise ships and ship porters as well as sea creatures, seagulls and airplanes. Fascinating!\n\nParking at Wave Organ can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking lot if it's available. Since walking is a good option, riding a bike is the best choice to trek to Wave Organ faster in half of time. Also, you can carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Wave Organ is the most fantastic historic landmark that I've ever visited in years right in the north west side of San Francisco.

This one is built in the affluent Marina District by the shore of the bay just past the Golden Gate Yacht Club. It's got an ocean front view of the bay, Golden Gate Bridge, Angel Island and Alcatraz. \n\nThis structure was constructed on a strip of man-made land in 1986 by the Exploratorium when it was still located by the Palace of Fine Arts on Baker St. It's at at the very tip of the the harbor and I would suggest parking between the St. Francis Yacht Club and Golden Gate Yacht Club. You can park on Marina Green, but there's no land bridge that connect you from the parking lot straight to this location. Unless you don't mind walking at least half a mile or more do get to this place and you are not in a rush and it could a nice leisurely stroll, especially if you bring your four-legged family member along. \n\nI remember exploring this place when I was a kid back in the 80's and it reminded me so much of an old Roman city ruin with all the stones and marbles stacked on top of one another. Years later, I find out that most of the marble used was salvaged from an old cemetery in the city. Gee, I wonder if some of those inhabitants disturbed by the move came along and moved her permanently. \n\nThe organs are made from PVC pipes that connects to the bottom of the bay that creates different sounds of splashes and splishes when the waves hits these instruments. Suffice to say that the San Francisco Symphony is safe from their jobs, but you do get to hear a free \"musical\" orchestra with an assist from Mother Nature. I'm sure the little ones will get a kick out of it, unless they have their phones with 'em and are hunting for Pokemon. If I see one playing Pokemon here, I might grab their device and throw it in the bay. Hearing it plop in the water will be music to my ears. \n\nIf the sound of the pipes are not doing it for you, at least the panoramic views of this place is gorgeous.

We added it to one of the stops on our family bike ride. \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nThe Wave Organ is an acoustic sculpture constructed on the shore of San Francisco Bay in May 1986 by the Exploratorium. Through a series of pipes, the wave organ interacts with the waves of the bay and conveys their sound to listeners at several different stations. The effects produced vary depending on the level of the tide but include rumbles, gurgles, sloshes, hisses, and other more typical wave sounds. The structure incorporates stone platforms and benches where visitors may sit near the mouths of pipes, listening.\n\nThe Wave Organ is located at the end of a spit of land extending from the Golden Gate Yacht Club. The stone pieces used in its construction were salvaged from the demolition of the Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco. Exploratorium artist in residence Peter Richards conceived and designed the organ, working with sculptor and mason George Gonzales.\n\nThere is a panoramic view of the city across the narrow channel into the St.Francis and Golden Gate yacht clubs, bounded on the left by the Fort Mason piers and to the right by a towering eucalyptus grove bordering Crissy Field. The Marina Green park lies directly across, just beyond a stone sea wall.[citation needed]\n\nThe Wave Organ includes 25 PVC organ pipes and is dedicated to Frank Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was the Founding Director of the Exploratorium, led the fundraising efforts for the Wave Organ, and he died seven months before construction started.", "author": "David S."}

If you are driving, go down Yacht Road and be careful where you park in the lot, some spaces are marked only for members. After that, just keep walking straight to the end of the road to find intriguingly unique cement sculptures. While they look very abstract and formless, during high tide their true purpose can be heard, bellowing out different octaves of a mimicked \"organ\" sound. Of course this is only functional during high tide, so planning and timing to hear it in its full potential can be difficult, making it frustrating to walk all the way down and not hear anything- that's how the hype burned out for me..\nHowever it is still a cool find and you'll have fun exploring through all the different cement fixtures!", "author": "Kyrie S."}

When we actually DID get to the organ itself,  was sad to see graffiti all over the place and no sounds like I was expecting or hoping for.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "I must call BS on \"music\" coming from the Wave Organ.\n\nI'm not sure what I was supposed to hear. I'm still not. I figured the water would push air through a narrowing fluted pipe much like the bellows of a pipe organ. The result would be similar to a grunting organ or at worst, someone with a sinus problem wheezing to breathe.\n\nWhat I ended up hearing were a couple water-gulping chugs and feedback like holding a seashell to the ear. You can easily recreate this lackluster experience at home by buying 4-inch PVC drainage pipe from Home Depot and dipping the end into a bucket of water. For more entertainment, tap the side of the pipe with a stick to pretend you're a member of the Blue Man Group.\n\nBuilt in 1986, some write that it is no longer working, but that's hard to believe because it was restored in 2010. Some write to come at high tide for the greatest effect. We came at 3:00pm - which we confirmed the next day at the Exploratorium it was close to high tide. Just looking at the height of the water compared to the breakwater, the level was high, but it didn't seem to create much sound. The hum of seaplanes flying around the bay created more noise than the Wave Organ.\n\nThat location has a wonderful view, but there are plenty of those in San Francisco and what makes the city one of the prettiest in the world. If you still dare to go, park next to the St. Francis Yacht Club and take the half-mile walk to the peninsula.", "author": "Brian U."}

I know it was a long, long time ago.  Another lifetime, really.  And from the steps and benches that haven't changed I could look back over at what could have been.  The color of the sky fit my occasional mood.\n\nThe Wave Organ is the Yin to Chestnut Street's Yang.  At the end of the jetty that points at Fort Mason from Bay it doesn't look like much more than a jumble of rocks.  Which is excellent, for as if it did more of what stays on Bay would fill the jetty, and it's that absence that takes you out there in the first place.\n\nThe Organ is made of pipes run to different depths into the space between the tides.  At high tide they're mostl all submerged.  The pressure of the wave action moves water up and down, forcing air in and out of the end nearest your ear, making wave music.  The stones are from a cemetary that used to live where Laurel Village lives now.  With luck the inhabitants were disinterred and redeposited someplace safer.  That, or this explains why the LV Starbucks always felt a little odd.\n\nEarly morning is the best time to come if your preference is just you and your solitude.  Weekday afternoons are nice as well.  At night I'd expect you could find somebody to stone you, if that was your pleasure.  Parking is ample along Bay and in Fort Mason and a few public spots near the volleyball fields.\n\nDo go.  I really think you'll like it.", "author": "Markus N."}

I love the brilliance and creativity that enabled someone to conceive it and the DIY ethic that motivated them to turn their vision into reality. Things like this are part of the many things that I love about San Francisco.\n\nThat being said, this doesn't quite fulfill its potential as far as being an instrument played by nature. Maybe it did before I started coming here approx. 20 years ago, but the pipes have gotten silted up, so they don't make much of a sound regardless of whether it's high or low tide. Still, you can sometimes hear a bit through the pipes, and it does sound both pleasant and interesting.\n\nWhat I enjoy most about the Wave Organ is the beautiful view of the Bay and the secluded vantage point that it offers to relax, meditate, and imbibe the wonder of the environment. I've enjoyed many picnics, dates and lazy afternoons here. It's probably illegal, but this would be a great place to smoke a cigar.\n\nThis is also a great place to watch the 4th of July fireworks.

Peculiar pipes emerge like periscopes from behind the grey granite walls. Carefully carved stones create sheltered seats, surrounding a small courtyard that sinks into the sea. As waves wander through the space starts to perform for you. A symphony of strange sea sounds  sing from each pipe. The unusual notes range from high to low, each pipe gives a mighty blow.  Where can you enjoy unbeatable views of the sea while listening to this interesting harmony?\n\nThe one. The only. San Francisco Wave Organ. \n\nThis wondrous  work is a piece of environmental art created by Peter Richards and George Gonzales in 1986. Sponsored by the Exploratorium, this structure was designed to observe and enjoy sounds made by water moving through the space. Built using old cemetery stones and PVC pipes, everything was carefully designed with sea sounds in mind. The result? A masterpiece of physics, engineering and design. And the sound? Is like listening to the largest seashell in the Bay. \n\nMagical music and breathtaking views, will make a journey out to the Wave Organ worth it for you.

( i was doing experimental music at the time). Anyway, when I first moved to SF one of the first things I tracked down was the Wave Organ.\n\nIts at the tippy tip end of a think strip of land opposite the Marina Green. you can ony get to ti by driving in toward the SF Yacht Club or Harbor Club, etc... it's a cool little walk out there, a nice view -- but the magic is/was, when the sound was happening.\n\nThe problem now, is that so many people know about and that spot has been a hang now for beer drinking and vandalism, that its in bad disrepair. There are tubes, columns/pipes that emerge all around the sculpture garden. People have thrown trash and stuff down there clogging it up. As well, after 25 or more years, there are cracks in the concrete tubes that go out in the water, and I suspect things are growing inside. It needs a gian Roter-Rooter-ing. Most people think its just a matter of Low Tide, but it's not. When the thing was fully working, you didn't even have to lean your ear in to tube. You could just sit and stand in the sculpture area and it was amazing. It doesn't merely make rusing water gurgly sounds. I've heard sounds that sounded like Bass being plucked, voices, clarinet and guitar amongst others... probably 15 or so years ago I brought my grandmother there and it was high tide and it was working really nicely... I still enjoy just being there, but between fishermen skunking it up and vandals it needs some work... still worth checking out though! And its FREE.", "author": "R A."}

Great little nook to sit in and enjoy the view and be serenaded by the gentle sounds of the 'organ'.   It's almost like a little secret spot in San Francisco.  Turn around and enjoy a view of the entire Golden Gate Bridge (when it's not foggy).", "author": "Denise M."}

But if you come at high tide (last night at 10:30 worked out pretty perfectly), you will be able to hear the difference in tones that each pipe can make when the waves are hitting it. You can also sit in the stereo booth, smoke a bowl and listen to the reflection of sound through the holes in the stone wall. I suggest go with a friend that can appreciate it, enjoy the scenery and the sound which I can only describe as calm and serene.", "author": "Megan P."}

The artist partially submerged the ends of large organ pipes in the water with the other ends protruding from the alcoves at various intervals.  If you put your ear to the pipes you can hear the distorted lapping of the waves.  This is a great place to read, take a date, or reflect on how lucky you are to live in San Francisco.", "author": "Kevin G."}

It seems some reviewers find the burblings and gluggings of the water in the organ pedestrian, but I never fail to be amazed by their variety and uniqueness.  Plus, I love the fact that it was constructed from the remains of a Gold Rush-era cemetary near the city. It's a wonderful place to picnic, smooch, and watch the sailboats.", "author": "Esther H."}

Very pretty and interesting installation. Unfortunately, there were not much waves today hence no loud sounds from the pipes but the views from this point is just amazing.

The fact that the place was partially built with tombstones creeped me out a little.   There was a black & white picture of a parent and a child.  I'm pretty sure it's not a real photograph of dead persons.  But still.... *shudders* Interesting looking pipes.  All I heard was not the waves, but the water hitting the metal pipes.  I went on a foggy day, so the view wasn't that great.  I will love to visit there again on a sunny day if the painting is erased.  Eeek.", "author": "Jessica N."}

After having lived here for several months, I realized I have walked and jogged in the marina area, but had never stopped at the Wave Organ. It is a little out of the way, but it is worth visiting at least once. I didn't visit during high tide, so I may have to go back. But there are great views from here to take pictures of the bridge, the little patches of sand on either side of the jetty, and the organ itself.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

The place has a nice view of the city and of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAnd about the organs, it was so cool sounding and relaxing.. and funny for some reason. \n\nThe area over all is just a really chill place to relax .. perhaps some \"reflection time\" to yourself.  \n\nLike Cade P. said, it's kind of a secret place and something you would never really expect to find.", "author": "Mila B."}

I read about the Peter Richard's Wave Organ when I picked up a copy of art-SITES San Francisco from Zinc Details on Fillmore, and was in total aw and had to go at once.  I asked my San Francisco native roommate if he had ever been. He said no, so I thought \"wow this would be so awesome if not many people know about this place\". It could be a douchebag free haven to sit and relax and enjoy the Wave Organ's awsomeness! Not the case. After following art-SITES detailed directions, my roommate and I almost gave up hope, but alas we found the not so glorious Wave Organ.

I went to it for the first time last week and went back the next night.  It's sort of hard to find, especially at night and half drunk, but if you have faith in the wave organ, you'll find it.  Second of all, its not exactly a great geological achievement to put tubes in water and hear the waves.  However, its a great thing to be among the bay with a view of the city, both bridges, with some friends, maybe a flask of rum, or whatever keeps you warm.  There are benches and seating areas around the tubes, and the space if big enough so that if you and your friend are marvelling at the awesomeness of our city by the bay, and a couple come by who want to catch some face time, you don't disturb each other too much.  As far as the actual wave organ, its neat.  You can hear the water.  Its much better at high tide.  I personally recommend the two tubes down closest to the water, especially the one on the left.  So, great for a date, great for friends, great for smoking herb, great for solemn relfection.  Just one of those things that can warm your heart as you freeze your face off in this San Fran Cisco of ours.", "author": "Mike C."}
