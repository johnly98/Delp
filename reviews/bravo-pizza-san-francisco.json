I knew parking was going to be hard so I arrived early which made things easier. I had never ate here before but my family had. \nThe prices were very reasonable . We ordered wings which were amazing & xl pizzas of all different types. \nWe are big eaters/people but our appetite was fully satisfied. The xl are slices are huge . Pizza was not greasy either which is our preference. \n\nIf you want a fancy place where you will pay $50 and up for a large/xl but actually get a medium then this isn't your place. But if you want filling great tasting reasonable price pizza with great staff and a chill atmosphere then this is where you want to go. \nIf your bothered by traffic or scare easily from your average weirdos then stay in your comfort zone but if you live life fully and want to taste amazing pizza then Bravo pizza is the place.", "author": "Rita C."}

We ordered a medium pizza - half #1 bravo's special and half pepperoni, sausage and pineapple. \n\nThe pizza was delivered in about 45 minutes, which was nice - I was expecting longer. We didn't receive any Parmesan cheese/red pepper or utensils so that was a bummer :/ I was super excited for the pizza, but I was not very impressed and it didn't satisfy my cravings :( I like cheese, but the pizza was way too cheesy and not saucy or flavorful enough. The pizza wasn't horrible, but it was just too cheesy and not saucy enough for my liking. If you like cheese, this is the spot for you, but unfortunately, I will probably not order from here again.", "author": "Bailey L."}

Ordered 3 XLs for delivery (the #1, #2, and chicken/mushroom). Definitely not cheap at $98, which also included 9 cans of coke thrown in. The weight of each pizza is pretty substantial.\n\nHowever, there were 2 major issues with the pizzas: \n1) Way too much dough. No one in our party even attempted to eat the crust as it was too overwhelming and not tasty enough to waste stomach capacity on.\n2) We could not hold a slice as it was too soggy. It was so soggy it completely soaked the paper under the pizza, causing it to stick to the dough and almost impossible to separate from one another. I had to use a spatula to scoop a slice onto a plate and then use a knife and fork to eat it. \n\nThere seemed to be a good amount of cheese, which is not bad in my book. But I found myself eating a glob of cheese and meat and then picking up the soggy remains of the dough with a fork. \n\nIf you like doughy, soggy pizza with gobs of cheese, this is a must try.\n\nThe only way I would give this place another shot is if it was free, but would still do so reluctantly.", "author": "Alex C."}

In the 1970's, there weren't many pizza delivery companies around.  Imagine a 13-year old dialing his rotary phone and ordering Italian food delivery.  My older brother certainly didn't mind those numerous shared pizzas that left us wondering, \"Did we really eat the WHOLE THING?!\"  (reference to Alka Seltzer commercial (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFKifpMtlNs))\nFast forward forty years later and... oops, did that slip out?\nWanting old fashioned Italian food (no, I haven't tried Capo's yet), I have been ordering here on a regular basis in the past year.

One HUGE box filled with three large meatballs, plenty of spinach and cheese filled ravioli, a pile of spaghetti noodles, drowned in a hearty marinara sauce.

My delivered order came out to just under $30.00 before tip, reasonable since it lasted me four meals.

This place has been serving up piping hot pizza's since as long as my family has been in the city. Walk on in and let them know what you are craving and 15-20 minutes later you will be sitting in front of one heck of a pizza. \n\nThey pile on the cheese like the Splash Brothers rain 3's (#DubNation)! The crust is thicker than most pizza joints so some people aren't a fan of it but I know I am!  it's soft and great to dip in the sauce of your choice (nudge, nudge... get the ranch!). They have everything from  Wings to Spaghetti and Meatballs, Ravioli's, Steaks, Pasta's and Salads.\n\nDon't hesitate to give it a whirl, you will be pleasantly surprise on the variety of dishes and pies available.

No problem, I figure they're busy. \n8p rolls around. Where's my order? I call the shop. No answer. I'm looking at Yelp and they're closing by 9p. They wouldn't forget about us would they?\n8:30p arrives and I'm like where's my pizza? I call the shop. No answer. I call repeatedly for the next ten minutes. No answer. Well, now I'm hosed. Most other pizza joints are closing soon!\nOk, now it's 8:40p, forget this, I have to go down there and see what's going on. I hop in my car and race to the shop, but I also dial the shop one last time. I put it on speaker and listen to the sweet, sweet sounds of ringing and ringing all the way there. \nI bounce out of my car with my phone still on speaker, still dialing. They're closing up shop and sweeping, clearly ready to call it a night. \nI told them I've been waiting for my pizza since 6:30p, been calling for the last hour with no answer, I even show them my phone THAT IS CALLING THEM RIGHT NOW what's happening!!??\nThe two guys scramble to figure this out and are perplexed: turns out the delivery guy left with our order a LONG time ago. Well, where is this guy cruising around with our order? As they hustle to figure it out, my wife calls and tells me it finally arrived. \nThe dudes at the shop apologize, but I'm like, the heck is going on??\nSo I go home pretty annoyed, and find the pizza and the wings cold (clearly been cruising around SF for way too long). My wife tells me the driver was apologetic and promised next time would be faster.\nBut here's the interesting part: the driver's car had an uber sticker. \nHmmmmm...\nCould it be our delivery guy may have been picking up fares too? We really don't live far from the pizza and it did take TWO AND A HALF HOURS to arrive cold. Maybe. \nI called Bravo to complain about my pizza and they apologized again...just kidding, I called and they didn't answer and it just kept ringing and ringing. \nGet. Your. Business.

I've traveled a lot for my age and I've done so for school mostly. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy meals from other states (especially PIZZA my fav), but when I came here for the first time I literally felt my taste buds die and go to food heaven. Chicago, New York, Italy, whatever I don't care. This place here in my own backyard has the best pizza I have ever had. Such a nice family vibe in the store itself as well. It was a little cramped for me, but the pizza was WAY too worth it for me. Literally, I had to buy two larges to keep my fix on for it. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that I'm trying to be a dietitian? That's how good it is! Super yummy I just love the right combination of sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. The right combo of chew and crunch, the ranch, the SF vibe, it was all beyond perfect. I'm definitely coming back here ASAP.", "author": "Ericka R."}

Bad sign because there is a chance we might have to wait for our pie behind all the delivery/phone orders. \n\nWe were sat in a timely manner and had menus in hand in no time.

Each time I've come here it's been myself and another very hungry co-diner and we can barely put a dent in an antipasto salad ($9- served in a king-size serving bowl big enough for 6 ppl) and a small pizza. I am not exaggerating people. The small pizza is way too much for two extremely hungry people. \n\nSo if the gigantic portions and tiny prices haven't convinced you, let me talk about the quality. \n\nH o m e m a d e   B r e a d\nThey serve fresh out of the oven, homemade bread in a modest basket lined with paper towel. I smelled it and was shocked and asked the server \"is this....is this...homemade?!?\" Yes. The answer is yes. It's phenomenal. \n\nI cannot recommend the antipasto salad enough, it has EVERYTHING, beans, salami, ham, cheese, bell peppers, onions, olives, tomatoes and homemade salad dressings! One of my very favorite ranch salad dressings ever! \n\nThe pizzas are so huge and heavy the servers often carry them with two hands! This is a thick crust pizza with tons of cheese, a great tomato sauce not too bitter or sweet, and the perfect amount of toppings. \n\nThis little family owned and operated spot is my new go-to dinner.  For under $30 I can have a plentiful meal for two plus enough leftovers for 4 lunches after. \n\nNever change, Bravos! You're doing it right!", "author": "Emma H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-31", "description": "With so many four and five star ratings for Bravo Pizza, I had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, the two times I've had their pizzas, I was disappointed, but for different reasons.\n\nThe first time, I ordered a #3 \"Almost Everything\" for delivery, which took an outrageous 90 minutes!! Maybe I'm very impatient, but generally 60 minutes is the longest I'd wait for pizza delivery. The \"Almost Everything\" has pepperoni, salami, sausage, beef, olives, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The pizza was a delicious, cheesy mess that was difficult to enjoy because toppings were so abundant that even the thick dough couldn't hold it all. Bravo's pizzas have a really thick and powdery crust, and the dough is too chewy. Personally, I prefer thin crust pizzas.\n\nThe second time, I ordered a #1 \"World Famous Bravo\" for pick-up, which took a reasonably-timed 25 minutes. The pizza has pepperoni, salami, sausage, mushrooms, onions. There was plenty of pepperoni and sausage, but salami was lacking a bit. The way the salami was layered beneath the cheese made it difficult to judge whether or not they skimped with that delicious nitrate-ridden meat. What's worse was the mushrooms, as if they forgot them! The mushrooms were in tiny pieces, and there wasn't a lot either. I would've felt less insulted if they had just forgotten the mushrooms all together.\n\nThe restaurant is small, old, and looks a bit rundown. I believe this a more of a takeout or delivery kind of place. I can't speak for dining in, but when you order for takeout or delivery, you're given complimentary soda (Coca Cola). If I'm craving pizza while in this neighborhood, Bravo's will still be an option, even though there's at least another ten or more pizza places within a mile radius.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

My cousin said it felt like we had been transported to the middle of no where and it was the only pizza place in a 40 mile radius.

I always see a Facebook post or conversations about the Real Housewives.  A lot of women watch it, even a couple guys I know that I'll leave nameless for fear their manhood will come into question. \n\nSo apparently this show is about Rich, Collagen filled, dramatic women.  So what does this show on Bravo have to do with Bravo Pizza?  Absolutely nothing.\n\nIn fact it's the opposite.  The most friendly group of people work here.  Man sized portions where you are guaranteed to be bringing home leftovers for the next day.  A very comfortable pizza parlor, filled with booths to sit at.  High carb, saturated fat filled, drama free Italian comfort food.\n\nThe utility pizza served here has a thicker than usual crust, so if you expect thin crust, you're at the wrong place.  This pizza comes with thick crust, heavy cheese, heavy on the toppings, and a nice sauce.  \n\nWhat I enjoy more than the pizza is the entrees served at Bravo.  Veal Scaloppini, spaghetti w/meatballs, and my favorite is Chicken Parmigiana.  Entrees served with a side of pasta and salad can be added for a couple dollars more.  \n\nAlso I'll order buffalo wings on most occasions.  And fresh house-made bread is served.  All meals are easy on the pocket book as well, usually around $12 a person. \n\nSo when I hear the word Bravo, I don't think of Real Housewives.  I think of real friendly people, real comfort, real pizza, and real good food.  Always leaving me real full and satisfied.", "author": "Michael L."}

I wasn't sure if this place would be crowded as I had never been, so I called ahead to see if there was a wait and got put on hold. A little weird but then the guy came back on the line within a minute and said the location was a first-come-first-serve with currently no wait. After actually coming to the location, I wondered if he put me on hold to laugh.. =/ \n\nThe location is right on the corner of Mission St and Geneva Ave. There's street metered parking that can be sometimes hard to find (depending on the time), or you can go a little further and if you're lucky, find residential parking. Very dive-y feel to the place with very worn booths and dim lighting. My friend's side of the booth was actually sunken in and the upholstery torn up. Can't really expect much from this area though. The menu is catered to serve families as they had lots of options for family sized orders (even a pitcher of soda!). Don't expect to find any fancy menu items here. None of the Spring, Spinach, or Arugula Salad. No Provolone, Brie, or Pepper-jack Cheese. They have bottled beer and a very small selection of cheap wines if you really had to have wine.\n\nOur Order:\nLarge #3 Almost Everything: ($28.30) Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Beef, Olives, Bell peppers, Mushrooms, Onions\nFamily Sized Salad: ($7.25) Lettuce, tomatoes, beans & salami\n\nThe salad came out in a salad bowl topped with large slices of salami. The beans in the salad were garbanzo and kidney beans. Even though not stated on the menu, it also came with thin slices of raw onions and green bell peppers. Options of dressing: Ranch, Italian, Thousand Island or Oil & Vinegar. Not my choice of salad as I'm not a fan Romaine lettuce but that's all they have here.\n\nThe large on the menu says it's 16\" but when it came out.. OMG it was huge! Looked larger than the 16\" that was listed. We had ordered a large because my friend said he was starving (and he's one of those gym rats that eats a lot) but after the pizza came out.. we were pretty sure we weren't going to finish it. In the end, we managed to finish half (which was a major feat) but we also had been talking for over 2 hours so we were munching as we talked. The bottom of the pizza and the crust were crispy but since it is a thick pizza, the center was slightly on the doughy side. Ingredients were ample and the cheese very elastic but soft.\n\nThe staff was helpful and constantly checked-in on us. Our waitress was so friendly and had the sweetest smile!

Such a gem with delicious food and down to earth unpretentious vibe. We come here or order take-out every other week atleast and it has failed to disappoint us, actually maybe left us unsatisfied once, but that's okay! Pizza's are delicious, and the pasta's are HUGE although the pesto was a little bland, the wings are awesome probably some of the better wings I've had. I also love that they do these little half pitchers of Lagunitas for only $6, perfect drink portion size for someone who has a good thirst.

But maybe I just happen to be the fortunate one who's never experienced that with Bravo Pizza. \n\nMy dad grew up in the area and I have family that still lives nearby, so whenever my dad and I are close, we'll pick up a pizza from Bravo. \n\nNever got the name of whoever picks up my calls, but they were very welcoming and very helpful. They even told me that I'd be getting three cans of coke with my order of a large pizza, not sure if that's a promotion or just standard, but it was pretty awesome to not have to pay a bit more for drinks. \n\nParking in this area SUCKS, so if you have someone else with you, send them to get the pizza while you fill up at the chevron gas station across the street. The area does seem pretty sketchy at times, so it'd be best to be aware of your surroundings. \n\nAnyways, back to the ordering. The employee who took my order said it'd be ready in 25 minutes. I went in a little under 25 minutes and our pizza was ready. Workers were friendly, greeted me at the door, handled the pizza/cash exchange, and sent me off with a few sodas. \n\nThe pizza is BOMB. I can see why even after 40 years, my dad will still throw down a $20 spot to pick up a pizza from here rather than Little Caesars. The pizza can be really hot initially, but once it cools a little then that'll be the perfect time to dig in. We got a sausage and pepperoni pizza. Though it can be a little bit oily, the pizza was cooked perfectly. There was a perfect balance of ingredients, and even the crust was almost like a breadstick. We went through 3/4ths of the pizza and were stuffed. Reheated, the pizza is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you got friends or family over, a craving for some pizza, and some extra cash to throw down, this is the spot you're looking for.", "author": "Robee A."}

The appearance of the restaurant put together with the area it's in would usually steer me away immediately, but my girlfriend's family has been coming here for years since they used to live nearby so she dragged me along. We took a seat and I decided to just give it a shot. The waitress was very nice, a little on the slow and forgetful (she was elderly, so understandable), but nice nonetheless.\n\nAfter getting our appetizer I had to use the restroom...very glad I didn't have to sit down because...well, if you don't like gas station bathrooms, then yeah. Self explanatory. The restrooms would be the only bad thing about this place. Yes, the dining area could use a little restoration, but it's fine.\n\nWhen we got our pizza, I dug right in. Kinda hot, really hot, but I got through it. Unfortunately I could only eat 2 slices because they're HUGE. We took the rest home with us, after trying to flag down the waitress unsuccessfully for 30 minutes...\n\nIf you're ever in the area, give it a try.

Bravo is easily my favorite among these because it is well cooked (not soggy/runny which has sometimes happened with Di Napoli), the crust is thick but not bread-y (Seniore's), and they are generous with the toppings. I also like that I get cokes with my order when I pick up, it's a nice bonus (something Toto's doesn't have).

The pizza is delicious; layers of flavor, ingredients and hefty portions of cheese. They don't skimp on the pizza. The pasta is great, their marinara sauce in particular is addicting. I highly recommend the shrimp marinara. Meatballs are the bomb. Large and consistently juicy, not dried out like other restaurants I've been to. Eggplant parmesan is always good, cooked perfectly and layered nicely with that awesome marinara sauce and gooey cheese in there. Their minestrone soup is the best I've ever had. I've found out that they've had the same recipe for over 50 years and it's hella good. It has a slightly thicker texture than other minestrone soups and is chunky with veggies and noodles. The hot wings are great but can be spicy. Be sure to get a side of their house-made ranch with it. I'm still working my way through the menu but I'm looking forward to ordering more from Bravo.\n\nIn terms of delivery, I've never had an issue. I think I may be a bit more understanding since I've worked in the restaurant industry too though. But if the meal is delicious, I don't mind waiting in order to allow time for my food to be prepared and cooked properly. If you want pizza in 20 minutes, cook a frozen one at home. In terms of wait time though, I haven't had to wait for more than 1 hour - 1 hour 15 min. Some dishes take longer than others, but if you order during off peak hours, then it can arrive in less than an hour.

The girlfriend and I are hungry after a long day of her studying for finals, and my finalizing some paper work from an overly elongated work week. We both come to the conclusion that we want pasta, but not just any pasta. \n\nWe both were crazing something calorie ridden, that would leave us fat, happy, and likely bed bound due to our arteries deciding to clog up with nothing more than pure fat, in it's elemental form.\n\nWe chose Bravo Pizza, and in no uncertain terms was this a bad decision. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken, while she ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, both with a side salad. To accent it, a pitcher of Barqs Root Beer. I particularly enjoyed the latter bit, as I'm a Louisiana native and frankly, Barqs might as well be a supplement for water back in the NOLA.\n\nTo our surprise, a \"side\" salad that was about the size of an entree in of itself, arrived before us. It wasn't entirely complex, but good nonetheless. Fresh iceberg, wonderfully firm tomato quarters, sliced salami, and a few other goodies between. If the size of the \"side\" salad was any clue as to what our entree would be like, we were certainly prepared for greatness.\n\nDespite that, we were still shocked at the size of the entree. My Alfredo literally ended up feeding me that night (despite my best efforts at finishing it, I could only tackle half of it as it was quite literally a few POUNDS of pasta...) as well as for the subsequent day's, lunch and dinner. Large strips of all white meat chicken strewn through a battlefield of noodles and creamy Alfredo sauce. Admittedly, the sauce was a bit too fluid, but this is no five star restaurant and at the end of the day what I wanted was not something that appealed aesthetically (though it did in it's own macabre way), but instead I sought out a meal that would appeal to the sense of taste. Needless to say, it did that and then some, a sense of satisfaction that lasted quite literally, days. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the feel of the place is pretty damn nice. Not in a ritzy, classy way. But in a more, divey, Mama's kitchen kind of way. The natural wood coating the walls and ceiling, numerous bits of nostalgia covering the walls, and just the atmosphere of the place were all splendid. It's definitely a very \"warm and homey\" feeling place. I'd see no better environment to sit, chow down on food, while watching the game with a big group of friends.", "author": "Kenneth M."}

I had never tried Bravo Pizza in the neighborhood, but I had heard some very good things about their food.  If you like thick, bready crusts and large servings of toppings, Bravo may be the pizza for you too.  We had a couple of large pizzas delivered, one with ground beef, sausage, mushrooms and olives and another with chicken, pesto and garlic, and when these arrived they must have been two of the heaviest large pizzas I've ever handled.\n\nThe crust was baked fairly crispy on the bottoms but nice and chewy up top and inside.  There must have been an additional half inch of toppings and cheese on each.  The tomato sauce was not too tangy and not too sweet.  The chicken was all white meat, and the pesto was quite good but just a bit on the oily side.  I would easily have given this pizza four and a half stars, but it arrived in just about 35 minutes even though the order taker told us it'd be an hour and they threw in a free six pack of icy cold Coke.  My friends and I thought it was a killer deal.  I will order from them again.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

After me and a friend picked up with pizza and settled home, we opened the pizza box and did not see any pesto sauce. We automatically assumed the pesto sauce was probably spread under all the toppings. I take a bite there's no pesto but marinara. WHAT THE HELL!? So we called but no one answered. We had to drive all the way back and told the guy we ordered the pesto pizza but there's no pesto sauce! These were his exact words. \"Usually it's marinara sauce and pesto sauce topped together, but it seems like our chef completely forgot the pesto sauce. Sorry, we're closed. There's nothing I can do unless you want the pesto sauce on the side or I give you a $10 off your next visit. We already turned off everything.\" \n\nI'm already irritated the fact that they didn't pick up their phone when I called 25 minutes before they closed. And the fact that I had to waste MY gas and MY time to drive all the way back there for their mistake and all I get is side of pesto sauce or $10 off my next visit. Another factor is, I haven't had pizza for at least 2 years and for me to give this place a try because of their 4 star ratings, total disappointment. My first experience here was a major disappointment although he gave us two free cokes. I don't even drink soda. I ended up asking for the side of pesto because I am not coming back here. I don't mind spending a lot of money when it comes to good food and good service. But I'd say this was my waste of $26.00 I have spent. \n\nSorry, me thinks not.", "author": "Ella A."}

Him & his family have came here for years it being (1) of there favorite pizza places & I can see why.\n\nNow, this place looks like your average vintage pizzeria. Leather seats, booths dim lighting, a warm inviting family friendly environment. Once you taste there food you can see why they are way beyond average.This place honestly rivals my Zachary's Chicago style Pizza in Berkeley. They are just (2) different style pizza's. This is traditional & Zachary's are deep dish. This is the only Pizza I can say I like as much as Zachary's. \n\nHere is why they are so great. The pizza's cheese stretches on to your plate, the dough is made just right. It is soft but not gooey & a little crispy on the bottom.  It's marinara dance in your mouth & is pleasure every bite. So much spice & flavor in (1) slice of pizza. If you can believe it the crust even has a flavor in it, its not just a flavorless hard crunchy dough like most places. It is soft & actually has a taste. There is nothing bland about this pizza every inch of it is packed with flavor. I am so in love. lol\n\n\nAnother (1) of my favorite dishes that is worth adding on to your meal is the Pesto Ravioli. This is how it should be made. I swear they need to patent it. the raviolis are smothered in a creamy Pesto Sauce & oh is it so good.. I have been to Italian Restaurants that specialize in Pesto Pasta & they wish it was as good as this. This is hands down the best Pesto Pasta I have ever had in my life. i have yet to find any competition for this Pesto work of art.\n\n\nI've never been to a Restaurant where they perfected everything but seem to have everything down packed.

After reading reviews, I decided to try Bravo pizza delivery.  My medium pizza with pepperoni and red onions arrived within one hour and was still warm - so the delivery itself was fine.  Yet, the taste of the pizza was lacking.  The pizza is a not thin crust and is kinda doughy - which is fine and I expected this from reviews and pictures.  But the taste of the dough/crust was bland - without thinking about it, I stopped eating each slice when I got to the crust, and there was plenty of crust since the toppings stopped an inch or so from each edge.  The sauce and cheese were also so-so....nothing offensive, but just okay.  I have no idea what people are raving about, but I'll continue to search for a great tasting pizza with home delivery.", "author": "Ray S."}

Approximately every Wednesday night I stay in and gorge myself while watching Netflix (in particular my favorite TV show Reno 911).  Anyway, I worked really hard today and decided I would reward myself with pizza.  In my neighborhood its Little Joe's or Bravo.  I've had relatively basic food at both of these joints before.  \nBut as I said, tonight was magic.  \nI ordered a veggie pizza (no onions, no cheese, extra red sauce) and a greek salad for delivery. I asked for the feta and blue cheese dressing on the side.  I waited for my order while watching a show I'd never seen before called Bob's Burgers.  I called my mom.  I let my hunger build.\nSuddenly, there was the doorbell and Mr. Bravo was waiting downstairs with a box of pizza, covered by another box top full of salad/bread/(free)soda/dressing/cheese/etc.  I laughed right away, and he started laughing too, because we both knew damn well that this fatty feast was a meal for one.  Anyway, without shame I forked over $30, and without shame I went right into the feta on my way back upstairs.  \nWith glee in my heart I delved into mouthwatering homemade bread, which I promptly dipped into the homemade blue cheese dressing.  I am always glad I live alone, but never more in that tender moment.  Then I went straight for my first bite of hot veggie pizza, which I had ordered with fresh garlic added.  Mamma Mia!  Where is my boyfriend when I need to lay a sloppy wet one on him?  With hands shaking and heart racing I managed to get pizza, bread, and salad onto a plate, which was truly an olympic feat since both hands and mouth were busy stuffing food down my face.  I finally made it back to my seat so I could do my favorite thing in the whole world: eat an amazing meal while watching Netflix.  Some might call it a vice, but I call it a festival of carnal pleasure.  \nThank you, Bravo, for not only getting my order 100% correct over the phone, but also for the free soda, which, although I probably won't drink it, made me feel like I was a sweepstakes winner.

There is no difference. None. Zippo. I had flashbacks.\n\nWe decided to eat in and was treated very well by the waitress. She was sweet and attentive, and even call us \"young ladies\" as we drank our 1/2 pitcher of beer. yay!  \n\nWe ordered, 1/2 order of spaghetti + meat sauce, small Bravo combo, & garlic bread.  Food to table was fast -- spaghetti & bread came first, while the pizza arrived 10 minutes later.  As I mentioned, this is a very similar pie to Haystack--which if you read my reviews is not my favorite.\n\nInterior of the place is old school family pizza parlor. Think red, white, & green themes, coloring book dinosaur themed placemats, red vinyl booths & family dining. Bravo is a throwback to your youth. There is 1 TV ( not a sports bar) that had the giants pre-season game.\n\nThis is a CASH ONLY place and cell phone use is prohibited.\n\nAnd about the neighborhood-- It's not sketchy. You don't deserve to live in a city if you can't handle a colorful 'hood.", "author": "Pea H."}

They have a bunch of other pizzas, but this is the best one. They also sell a lot of other italian dishes, none of which i care for. This is the best pizza in the city. Geneva pizza, Roma Pizza, not even Blondie's off Market can compare. The inside is kind of old though, i dont know why , considering how many people eat there.

I grew up with the city and never looked back.  Well thanks to yelp and a friend of mine who is a transplant, she asked me about Bravo's one day.  I told her it was an old school pizza place but haven't been in years.   She looked on yelp and said we have to try it, this place gets great reviews.   So we go one night after work in our uptight work clothes, and when I walk in I can't believe that the place looks exactly like it did in the 70s and 80s.  The booths are all taped up and the walls and pictures have seen better days.   However that doesn't turn me off it.  We sit in a booth that is so old my friend says there is a pole going up her butt.  You have to position yourself just the right way to find padding on the seat.   A nice young boy/man takes our order which is the Greek Salad and the World Famous Pizza.   Since it's a Thursday night the place isn't that busy so the waiter is very attentive.  He brings us warm bread (why can't all restaurants warm their bread), butter, extra plates and napkins, and the Greek Salad with 2 different dressings we requested.  The salad is huge and they are not cheap with any of the ingredients.  It was EXCELLENT.  The salad was so big we had a lot left over to take home.   Then the pizza comes....piping hot - again not cheap with the ingredients - lots of cheese, sausage, etc.  The first bite is pure heaven.   I'm thinking what a dumbass I've been for waiting over 20 years to come back to Bravos.    I bring the left overs to my Mom who was born and raised in North Beach and she tells me how delicious everything is and wants to know where it come from.  I tell her Bravo's and she can't believe it \"That hole in the wall on Mission St\"  Yup the same one.    I go to many pizza places in the city, Little Star, Defina, Flour and Water, North Beach Pizza, Paradise in West Portal, etc.  I also travel a lot for work and pleasure and have had pizza in New York City, Brooklyn, Chicago, Spain, Italy, etc.    Not all pizzas are created equal and each has its own crust, style etc.   But Bravo's is definitely in my top 5 list and considering I still live in the city and they will deliver to my home I'm definitely not going to wait another 20 years to go back.   Bravo's is old school, good home cooking!!", "author": "P S."}

Located right at the junction of Geneva and Mission, this place is not hard to find.\n\nParking can very well be a challege if driving. You'll solely have to depend on street parking. And along Mission, sometimes that can be bummer.\n\nIts so inviting once inside. You lose all that tension and stress once the smell of the pizza's slowly cooking away in the ovens attacks your nostrils which just furthers your hunger, LOL. No really. \n\nIt feels \"Homey\". Like you can order then sit down and chop it up with whoever you are there with and just relax. I don't know but I find the booths seating extremely comfortable. The seat sinks in and cradles your bum almost like a Tempur Pedic mattress, but that's probably because they are old, LOL!\n\nThe pizza is great. Full of flavor, fluffy, and plenty to go around. They don't hold back on the toppings either. They'll fill that sucker up!\n\nI need to come back.

If anything, Ray's pizza is a thinner slice but was just as good as Bravo's.\n\nIf you're looking for gourmet style pizza, Bravo's is not the place for you. Their menu is kept simple and you don't have to worry about having a complex in deciding what to order. It's either pizza or choose from a small selection of their pastas and barbecue. I have had their bbcue chicken plate and it's huge. It's half a chicken w/pasta and vegetables enough for two people.\n\nThe only set back that comes to mind is that the parking is that great. You have to circle the block to find metered parking. The ambience is very homey and casual. It's definitely not a 5 star upscale type setting.

I'm not a thick crust pizza person at all, but if you are, I think you'll really like this pizza. I'm more of a thin crust guy, but regardless, the crust was tasty, there was a good sauce/cheese ratio and the toppings were good quality as well. i ordered a side salad and their blue cheese dressing tasted homemade to me. very good. they also threw in a few enormous pieces of delicious bread, which i also think was homemade, and a few sodas for free. plus, everyone was super friendly. the ambiance is definitely old school, but i think next time, i'll eat in and maybe try a pasta. these guys really seem like they aim to please.", "author": "Steve S."}

Its good drunk food but my only complaint would be that they put onions on the bottom of the cheese and I don't like onions. Other then that their pizza is pretty good and a decent price and is delivered quick. I should also add that their ranch is delicious...if you like ranch sauce with your pizza then make sure you order some from Bravos.", "author": "Shirley E."}

The interior is very much like a sports bar. Families eat here while watching the games, and there may be a few slightly intoxicated dudes.

Bravo was around the area and it was like a dream come true when I called at about 11pm and they said they will deliver! I ordered the small almost everything pizza, and it probably arrived almost an hour later. That was fine, since I was in no hurry. The delivery guy seemed to be super nice (he was an older man). \n\nThey charge $2 for delivery, but be sure to tip the man on top of that =) It came with a free can of coca cola as well.\n\nMy first thought when I opened up the box was \"YES, its a very CHEESY pizza\". And I was right. Mounds of cheese came ripping apart, but not all the way when I pulled. The one bad thing about this pizza is that the toppings along with the mounds of cheese separates from the actual dough/base of the pizza, which can be annoying. I didn't have that problem when I ate it cold the next morning though. I thought that for a pizza called ALMOST EVERYTHING, it didn't have much but pepperoni, salami, olives and onions on top. But I was wrong. The pizza was made with marinara sauce (a very specific taste b/c they added a touch of something), then topped with a coat of cheese, stuffed with bell peppers, mushrooms that looked hidden BECAUSE there was another THICK layer of cheese on top of that! That was why I didn't see the GREENS! I don't know if that's how they make it, or they were trying to be lazy and quick. But either way, it wasn't bad pizza. I'd definitely order TO GO from them again, especially if its late at night.", "author": "Elaine H."}

I always have the baked chicken...not the best but good enough for me to want to have a plate of it while my kids are enjoying their slice of pizza.  The atmosphere is low key.  Always have a game going on tv and the service from the same lady there makes you feel right at home.

I ended up going to Irving Cafe to eat and I passed by Bravo's and it appeared no one was inside when clearly they should have been open.
