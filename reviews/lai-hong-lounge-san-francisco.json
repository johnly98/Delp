An hour and a half later, I'm still waiting. Just not worth it.\n\nEvening update - after abandoning brunch, I was determined to come in and judge the quality of their food.  I came really early (10 minutes before the start of their dinner service) and was the first one in line.  One minute before they opened, a family (including Chinese grandma in tow) just cuts in line in front of me. OMG - they really need a better system than this antiquated waiting game (other places have waitlist systems via yelp or others where they text you when you are almost at the head of the line).  \n\nHaving entered the restaurant, I ordered the beef with broccoli, steamed rice and the dim sum platter.  The food was OK. They brought out the beef/broccoli first and forgot the rice. I had to try to get their attention to ask for the rice (there were like 2 tables seated at this time).  When the dim sum platter came out, the big dumpling was deformed - just basically sums up my experience at this place today. \n\nWith tax and tip, this meal was $50. Not cheap and certainly not worth the aggravation. I am confused as to how this place got on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list.  Not recommended.", "author": "Andrew S."}

But if you want dim sum for dinner, they serve it all day... the only non-Chinese table in the restaurant was having a full on dim sum feast during dinner service. \n\nService was lacking, even for Chinese standards. Save your breath if your table is missing a set of chopsticks or if you want some white pepper, they will tell you they are too busy to help you, and you'll end up having to get up and grab it yourself. Don't ask them about any food allergies, they don't care. Manager was the only person who smiled. \n\nSo the food... it was ok. My relatives who live in Chinatown called it passable. They had some aesthetic upgrades on some classic dishes (e.g. fried shrimp balls crusted in sliced almonds; fish shaped mango pudding), so presentation is above average. Portions are slightly below average, but still adequate - it was actually kind of nice leaving a 10-course meal without being stuffed. Nothing was particularly good, but nothing was gross either.

Instead of typical dim sum pricing of S/M/L, you order everything from a pictured menu (great!) each with their respective prices. They offer anything fro dim sum (steamed, baked, pan fried, deep fried), porridge, rice/noodles, wok specials, bbq, and dessert - the selection is huge. One of their selling points are the unique unconventional items - red rice rolls, bunny dumplings, colorful steamed dim sum etc. \n\nWe came at 1pm on Saturday afternoon and thankfully there wasn't a line. The food took 15-30m to arrive. \n\nBaked pork buns - dissapointed. so hyped by Yelp, but it was average. Ours was served room temp..... The shell was decent and would've been delicious if it was freshly baked. Filling was good too. \n\nBBQ pork noodle roll - Good! Great skin (not soggy or falling apart), generous pork filling with great seasoning & cilantro.\n\nShrimp Dumpling - meh. the skin was unusually chewy, almost like mochi. Filling was average. \n\nFried pork puff - GREAT! One of our favorite. It was super fresh, deep fried to perfection, with a nice crust, chewy mochi, and good filling. Served HOT. \n\nSteamed pork rib - Not bad. great staple.\n\nPork & Shrimp Sui Mai - Not bad. great staple.\n\nChiu Zhou Dumpling - Interesting, I've never had it before. It's huge - with tons of filling. \n\nClam w/ black bean sauce - Good. The clams were fresh and I liked the green bell peppers (there were a lot)\n\nStuffed mushroom w/ shrimp - Interesting. Mushroom were good but the shrimp stuffing was a bit to mushy...I hoped it was more textured or had actual shrimp pieces.\n\nSeafood pan fried noodle - Took 40+ minutes to arrive, at the very very end of our meal....it was pretty good though. Noodles were decent, not \"yellow\" as most places but definitely crispy. Seafood was good too.\n\nDeep fried egg puff - BADDD. We waited 20m for this dessert as it was \"freshly made\", uhhh no. It was served COLD, flavorless, undercooked, and just straight-up disappointing. We asked the server why it was cold and he said it was supposed to be that way.... no it is not. \n\nHonestly, the food was just normal/sub-par with a higher price point.

It's basically not much different than any of the other multitude of restaurants in Chinatown. Absolutely nothing sets it apart. What you'll get here is what you'll find all over Chinatown - decent food at a decent price (hence the three stars), curt, unhelpful service (better know what you want without asking a lot of questions), and nothing atmospheric worthy to speak of (dated furniture with carpet that could've used a deep cleaning years ago).  Chinese Americans have been to hundreds of these. It is what it is, but it's NO Michelin Star type of place! Just setting realistic expectations and don't want to mislead Yelpers. Keepin' it real!\n\nI dined here for dinner with a party of 15. Oddly, they were out of several items we tried to order. They have a very limited dim sum menu in the evening - so limited that I'm not sure why they even serve it. No steamed rice rolls with beef, pea shoot dumplings, or live fish of any kind (now every respectable Chinese restaurant has at least a couple of these swimming around somewhere), and the list went on. \n\nOne dish that did stand out was the Fook Kinh (spelling?)steamed tofu dish which I have pictured. That was tasty, and is a regional dish. All else was frankly just ok.\n\nThis isn't a spot I'd choose to return to, but I wouldn't balk if I were part of a group that wanted to come here.

The shrimp dumplings and steamed pork ribs were also good. I would skip both the radish cake and saut\u00e9ed water spinach. The radish cakes are okay but definitely not the best and a bit bland. The saut\u00e9ed water spinach was very spicy which was unexpected. If you can handle a lot of spice then it may be okay for you.\n\nService: They move quite fast but there's definitely a long line.

Normally this wouldn't bother if the food is good and the service honest. \n\nHowever, that's not the case at this greedy, money hungry establishment, where they can't even be bothered to print the receipts in English. Can't list ingredients in their menu properly for people who are vegetarian or can't eat certain meats.\n\nIt all started when I ordered a dish called 'chive dumpling', it was only afterwards I understood that (v) denotes that the dish is vegetarian on these menus. Regardless, I think they should have listed that these dumplings are PORK and chive. I made a mistake, did these money-hungry people understand? A restaurant with more integrity would have made some veg ones to replace the inedible dish. Not this place, they took our money even though we could not eat pork. This all fine and good, this was partially my fault, but it still irritated me. \n\nThat irritation did not dissipate when the food arrived, which was quickly. Quite the opposite, we were not impressed. While some of the dishes like the duck were quite good, most were full of salt. As if someone had gone in with a salt shaker and dumped it all over our food. Salt does not equal flavor. The food was not worth the money or hassle. \n\nBut the real problem occured when we got our bill, all in Chinese by the way, there was a charge with the number 4 by it. After asking about it, we were told that there was a charge for sitting in the restaurant.This sounds like a gratuity, so obviously we were not going to pay tip. \n\nSo, we left after paying out bill with the 'gratuity' charge, as we were walking out they demanded my brother pay the tip, even though, my dad had paid the bill. Which is just unbelievable! The service was poor, the restaurant stingy and not caring if you are vegetarian, charging a gratuity, that is written in very SMALL print on their menu, is demanding a TIP? Tips are not demanded, entitled, they are earned based on the customers prerogative. Needless to say, I will never return to this sodium filled, money pit, again. \n\nThe whole experience left me angry and feeling ripped off. I get SF's price of food is expensive but this restaurant is just trying to rob people. Pay your servers accordingly and stop demanding tip on top of a seating fee, like it is your right. Because it's not. I suggest going to another restaurant, there are many good ones nearby, that are not charging people merely to just sit down in their restaurant.", "author": "A K."}

This was the first restaurant my roommate and I stopped by for lunch while visiting San Francisco China Town. The wait was somewhat lengthy between 30-45 minutes. The food was very good and the staff were very patient and helpful while we chose our food. We ordered steamed pork buns, vegetarian dumplings, and tea to start. For the Main Course, we ordered a large dish of Garlic Shrimp Noodles, which was delicious. Our waiter recommended we order just one dish of the Noodles since it was a large portion. We finished with Coconut Dumpling which we were unable to eat because my roommate suffers from Peanut Allergies. Luckily we had been experimenting and poking at the dumpling prior to eating it. \n\n**If you have any food allergies, please make sure to notify your waiter/waitress prior to ordering your food.** \n\nWhat sort of ruined the experience was the bathroom situation prior to leaving the restaurant. It was dark, cold, and unclean. I heard someone coughing very badly and decided to skip out on using the bathroom altogether. If the bathroom looked like that, I do not want to imagine what the kitchen is like, especially since I had just finished eating there :( LESSON LEARNED - Check the bathrooms first", "author": "Lisnel V."}

Their selection - which you mark with a marker on a laminated menu - is pretty varied, so you can get most of the popular items, plus some stir-fry or rice and noodles, all from the same menu. \n\nI think the food is decent, but nothing to rave about. Just good ol' dim sum that won't disappoint. Some dishes are on par with the best (like the \u9e79\u6c34\u89d2, fried dumpling with pork), whereas the others are passable. \n\nAlthough, I'm beginning to think that there are so many dim sum places all over the Bay Area that it's probably best to stick to a decent one close to home, rather than to travel and wait in line for something that might be marginally better.", "author": "Alice C."}

Large portions, but their classic dim sum dishes were a bit off.\n\nBe sure to either come early or towards the tail end of dim sum if you want to avoid the wait. They also offer shared tables if you don't mind sharing with other diners. We waited about 30ish minutes for a table for 2.\n\nThey have laminated menus here--check off what you want and wait for the food to come out. Personally, I thought the menu was a bit confusing. There were 2 full pages of food items, but they all sounded really similar. We ordered a ton of dishes--so many that the waitress told us it was too many for 2 people (lol woops) but decided to keep the order as it was. \n\nThe food came out fairly quickly and portions here are on the bigger side. They're not as fancy looking as a lot of other dim sum spots so everything looks a bit more homemade.\n\nOnto the food: dumpling wrappers here are way too chewy and thick. It was almost like I was chewing gum. The shrimp and chinese donut rice rolls were also on the thicker side.\n\nI was really excited to try the BBQ buns, but they were served lukewarm. The almond puffs with egg yolk were also really greasy and disappointing. Turnip cake was mushy. Dan tats were forgettable.

I've had better dim sum in divey places in The San Gabriel Valley and better service in Applebee's. And nothing gets me more riled up than rude, unprofessional service esp. from the management. \n\nTHE EXPERIENCE\n\nIf you:  \n\n- Like passable, soggy and/or room temperature dim sum\n- Like your meal spaced out in a span of 1:15 hours\n- Get water after asking 4 times by 3 people at your table\n- get aggressively challenged by the manager when pointing out the terribly slow and poor quality service and food\n- get chastised out loud to the point other customers have that \"WTF is a manager yelling at customers for?\" Look on their faces?\n\nYes, Lai Hong Lounge is the place for YOU!\n\nOk I just gotta get this off my chest: this has been one of the shittiest dining experiences I've ever had in my lifetime. All seemed normal enough: when we walked up to the restaurant we saw there was a crowd outside so we knew the reviews meant something. We waited approximately 30 mins before we agreed to split our table with a family of four (non Asian).  \n\nSo their party and my wife and I sat at this big table and ordered separately. And that when the waiting began. The first dish that arrived was theirs. That arrived in 30 minutes. Ours followed about 5 mins later. It was the XO Turnip cake. It was soggy beyond belief but we were so hungry that we ate it. \n\nThen more waiting.  And more waiting. Our mutual frustration with the family became bonding time for us like two wimmin' scorned by the same guy. They father was so frustrated the he said he was tempted to drop a $20 and leave.  He even mentioned that we all sat down at 10 til and we all had only received one dish. Then our next dish came out. It was yo tiao wrapped in rice paper. The yo tiao is supposed to be crispy and airy. Ours was undercooked and dense. The edges like a well cooked yo tiao are crispy. This crappy plate of soggy sadness should've never been served. We only at one a piece. \n\nThen we waited some more. The family's adult kids were about to fall asleep. Numerous times they asked for water. We did on their behalf too. Mercifully they got their tea water refilled but only because I wrangled the lady with the hot water pot when she was rushing by. \n\nThen finally after about one hour we all got our food. Our tofu beef roll was above average. Our braised black bean pork was lukewarm and rubbery. I swear you can't make this up. Then the final straw that broke the camel's back was the room temp do hua (soybean dessert). My wife was pissed. So I went over to the register to complain  about the food and then the manager got aggressive with me and raised her voice to say \"WHAT DISH?  You tell me!!\" So I said \"Well why don't you come to our table?\"  So she did. As we pointed them out, the lady became very dismissive and defensive and then my wife's Chinese side came out and they were taking in Chinese. My wife told me later that the lady mgr kept saying these dishes are meant to be served lukewarm or not fully hot. ARE YOU F'G KIDDING ME?  So I could tell my wife was exasperated talking to an idiot so she gave up. The last thing the manager asked is if we wanted anything packed up. Since we didn't touch the do hua, my wife told her to pack that up but I told the manager no to everything else. \n\nWhile this was going on, everyone within sight was staring at the scene this manager was making. The nice Caucasian family's father started their quick exit out and wished us a \"happy holiday\" and a \"good luck\" lol. We made eye contact and chuckled about that. \n\nIt would be one thing if the manager apologized for the slow service and the crappy cold food and I'd give them another chance. Maybe. But because of that rude manager, this place makes it into the very few places that I've given a one star to.", "author": "Bob K."}

This was my first experience of Dim Sum & loved it.\n\nThis is a popular place & the wait is usually quite long. We were able to share a table w/ another party which shortened our wait time. I told my friends that I was vegan & a strict vegetarian so they help navigate the menu that was written in Cantonese w/ English translation. It was a new experience for me so glad I had them help navigate the menu. They are omnivores yet to simplify things we ordered vegetarian & family style to share.\n\nEverything is fresh & made to order. You mark the menu w/ an erasable marker for how much quantity of each item you want than the orders are brought out to the table. The menu has highlighted in green which items are vegetarian yet am glad they were with me to help decipher what to order.\n\nWe ordered:\nPea Sprout Dumpling\nChives Noodle Roll\nVegetarian Dumpling\nMixed Mushroom Bun\nHomemade Mugwort Dumpling\nSteamed Sesame Balls\nDry Fried String Beans\nMixed Veggie Chow Fun\nSalt & Pepper Tofu\n\nIt was an exceptional feast & a unique experience.

Unfortunately there are no photos on the menu, so you will have to rely on the plate descriptions (and Yelp photos).\n\nThis place opens at 10 and I would highly recommend arriving when they open, otherwise you'll probably be waiting a good 45 minutes or longer. I got here for 11 on a Friday and was quoted a 30 minute wait for a table of two. We ended up being seated 45 minutes later. If you're willing to share a table with other guests, you may be seated sooner. \n\nLet's start off with the bad: this place is a madhouse. It's very chaotic and loud with tons of people waiting by the door both inside and outside the restaurant. The crowd today spilled onto the street and the whole pick-a-number-and-wait-to-be-seated process did not seem organized at all. I think they went out of order a couple of times, so be sure to pay attention to your ticket number. The food also took a while to come out, and when it did, it came out individually instead of all at once. There were also long intervals between each dish.\n\nNow on to the pros: the food is delicious. We tried:\n\n-Pan fried taro cake\n-Shrimp dumplings\n-Pork xiu mai \n-Stir fried water spinach with garlic\n-Stuffed crab claws\n-Clams in black bean sauce \n-Pork spare ribs \n-BBQ pork steamed buns\n\nPortions are huge! We probably had enough food to feed a table of four. The clams in black bean sauce were small and disappointing but they did give us a lot. I'd say my favorites were the water spinach, surprisingly, and the steamed buns. I'd return but I would definitely come early next time.", "author": "Jessica N."}

That definitely upped the expectations I had of this place. There was a mad rush in when the place opened, but everyone ended up getting a table with some room to spare. \n\nOrdering here was a bit confusing for my first time. Apparently, you were supposed to mark on the menus what item you wanted using a marker, but we never got that marker, so we just sat there wondering what to do. The waiters were all bringing tea out to the other tables (I presume, after they'd ordered), so we just didn't know what was going on until I flagged a waiter down to get a marker. \n\nFood:\n- Steamed pork ribs: They were alright, but the meat was a bit tough and the pieces were gigantic\n- Bunny shrimp dumplings: They didn't really look like bunnies by the time they got to me....\n- Custard piglet buns: These did look like pigs though! And tasted alright\n- P/f chive dumplings: these were gigantic for some reason and drenched in oil and did not look appetizing in real life.

While it isn't unusual to have to wait a long time for dim sum in SF, Lai Hong Lounge makes the experience absolutely unbearable with their poor numbering system. Our group of 3 had to wait over 1 hour and 45 minutes, but the most frustrating part was that the host calling out the tables frequently jumped between numbers. In particular, there was a group of 2 that was somehow able to skip the line when they arrived, and when we asked the host about it, she just gave a lame excuse. There's an additional server who pops out whenever a table is available, and she calls out numbers so quickly that most parties don't have time to react before she completely just glosses over them and gives their table away.\n\nThe food is fairly average compared to other dim sum places in SF.

I don't expect to get seated at a table for 6 or 8, but surely a 4 top would be fair. Especially, when we've been waiting for so long and yet groups of 4 who have only waited 10 minutes can start enjoying their food. When we were finally called they called about 7 more A numbers (tickets for parties of 2) and most all left because the wait was outrageous. I also noticed that the hostess would quote an approximate time, but it was always way shorter than what the real wait time actually was. \n\nOnce you're lucky enough to be seated you are given a menu that you mark up and a waiter takes it to the back, a printed receipt gets dropped off at your table and then the dishes slowly start trickling out.

You really have to pay attention to them because they read your number really fast and skip over any parties that don't respond within the first 2 calls lol.\n\nThe setup isn't like most dim sum places where you wait for a cart you want and order from it. They give you a laminated menu and sharpie and you mark the amount you want for each item (which I think is very efficient). Just remember at places like this you want to get the waiter's attention if you need service so don't be shy to call someone over.\n\nAs for the food, I'll start with what I didn't like: the shu mai and the XLB.

My party of 2 ordered shrimp stuffed tamago, baked pork buns (more of a BBQ pork bun/pineapple bun lovechild), deep-fried taro pork buns, shrimp dumplings, shrimp noodle rolls, pork shumai, pan-fried chive dumplings, and tofu skin pork rolls. We were stuffed about five dishes in, but we kept eating because the food was so delicious. I enjoyed every dish we had, the standouts were the baked pork buns, deep-fried taro pork buns, and the shrimp stuffed tamago. The baked pork buns were the work of pure culinary genius--the majority of the bun was impossibly soft and fluffy, and yet the top was deliciously crunchy. \n\nThere might be a bit of a wait on weekend mornings, but if you're willing to sit at a communal table, stay near the hostess for an opportunity to get seated sooner. Also, it's worth noting that Lai Hong Lounge is probably one of the most vegetarian friendly dim sum places I've seen, and they have handy green notations on their menu to help you figure out what'll work for you or your vegetarian friends.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Of course when we got there the question was now where do we go? There's only about 509 dim sum places. 217 on one block. Enter the Dragon....errr the Yelper. People completed raved about this place. We figured at worst if we didn't like what we saw there were still 508 to choose from in Chinatown. \nGood sign as we walked up. People walking out were clearly Chinese. In fact when we actually stepped in I scanned and saw we were the only non-Chinese people. I sincerely have no problem with that. I did have a problem though with the following. We're told to wait 30minutes. I see two groups ahead of us totaling 5 people. I see several empty tables that could easily us four. Okay I'll let it go. Maybe they are short staffed and don't want to spread themselves out too thin. The next thing I had a problem with was a few minutes later aniyher family of four walked in. They were Caucasian hailing from LA. Suddenly we have a table! But wait! We we were asked to share the table with the family??? What the flying cluck? Not even 30 minutes of wait time. Clearly they didn't want to give my family of four our own table. If this is standard practice then why didn't they ask us to share with one of the groups ahead of us? Okay so I'm hungry and again the Yelp reviews were good. I bite my tongue and sit down. Awkward.....I'm here to eat and spend time with my family. Not have to play polite and wonder what kind of topics I should bring up to engage in conversation. I wasn't hosting a dinner party for dumpling's sake. Mercifully our dim sum counterparts were nice and to note, they also thought it strange that as the only non-Chinese customers here that we got clumped together.\nThen I missed out on the part where it's not push cart dim sum. So basically I have to read a laminated non-picture menu, look at Yelp pictures for clarification, Sharpie my order in and pray for the best. Was this the futhermucking SAT? \nI'm hoping that the food itself can save the day. Sadly it didn't. We didn't order a whole lot because we felt we could order more if we were still hungry. So initially we got some turnip cake, shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pan fried green beans, salt and pepper tofu, and potstickers. All were \"good.\" But that seems like a let down considering how much I was looking forward to some \"authentic\" Chinese cuisine. Am I I'm heading in thinking with too high a bar here? It's freaking Chinatown San Francisco! Frankly I don't think this was any better than the dim sum I've had in San Diego. I know I've had WAY better experiences in previous trips to this area. Exit the still hungry Yelper from this place.", "author": "Jeff R."}

First, it's chaotic. There are always waiters and waitresses running around the restaurant and you usually have to wave them down if you want something. It's not rude, it's just how it works. Secondly, don't be surprised if there are a lot of people in a small space. Dim sum is not an intimate gathering, it's usually with the whole family. Third, know what you want to order before you walk in. Remember how I said you might have to flag the wait staff to get their attention? If you don't want to be hungry while you're waiting at the table then be ready! (Lai Hong makes this last step easy because they give you menus outside while you wait so that you can decide more quickly).\n\nOverall, I was very happy with the taste of the dimsum. My favorites are always shumai (port dumpling), charsiu bao (steamed pork bun), fried green beans, wugok (deep fried taro dumpling), and haam sui gau (fried glutinous rice dumplings).

My friend and I grabbed a menu and marker while we were in line so we could hand it off to the waiter as soon as we were seated.\n\nINSIDE:\nThe majority of tables seated 8-10 people, leaving table suitable for small families and pairs scarce. It was also no air conditioned, which I assume is typically not a problem since SF is not exactly known for the heat. However, on this particular weekend, it was in the 100s by 11 and it felt like there was no ventilation or anything in the restaurant.\n\nSEATING:\nAfter being told we would be seated in 30 mins, it wasn't until 1 hour later that we had to literally fight to share a table with 2 other parties. Hostess took volunteers to share a table and thankfully my friend was directly in front of the hostess when she made the announcement. Thus, we were led to a large table and shared with 2 other parties (1 party of 2 and one party of 3)\n\nFOOD:\nThis was the best part and the reason for 3 stars. If our experience leading up to the food and environment while eating was mediocre I would have given 4 or 5 stars. The shrimp har gow were HUGE! Not your typical dinky ones. The crab claw and deep fried shrimp balls were also cute! Not sure what it's called in Chinese, but in the shrimp banh cuon (Shrimp rolled in rice paper) was a HUGE plate and also so good. Peking Duck was very crispy on top but soft on the inside. Delicious!\n\nETC:\nComplimentary tea and water, though they didn't give us a refill even though it was scorching hot outside! The kitchen's generator blew while we were eating and lights went out shortly after. It lasted for about 15-20 mins, but was fixed.\n\nTL;DR -\u00a0don't come on a full stomach but definitely come ready for a good meal! Pro Tip - Portions are fairly large. it's better to under order then order more than to over order and be unable to finish! :)", "author": "Lily N."}

The wait on a Sunday around 11 wasn't bad, we waited maybe 10-15 minutes before getting seated. I heard about this spot from a couple friends as a pretty decent spot in Chinatown for dimsum, so I had been wanting to try it out for a while.\n\nThe way ordering works here is they give you a laminated menu with a marker, and you're supposed to mark what you want on the menu. We were a little bit hesitant since the marker was a permanent one, but since we didn't have any other options, we went ahead and used it.\n\nWe were only two people, so we weren't able to order a ton, but what we did was really good and hit the spot on a cold and wet rainy day. Some of the standouts for the meal for me were their sliced fish porridge, chicken feet, and shrimp rice noodle roll.\n\nService was slow, but I don't know if it was because of our spot off to the side instead of in the main dining area. Every time we needed to get the attention of our server, it took a while to flag someone down.\n\nParking took a little bit to find but it's doable. I was able to snag a spot on Columbus Ave a couple blocks away.\n\nPaid about $20 for this meal including tax and tip.", "author": "Dianna H."}

On the first day in SF, we checked out Yank Sing nearby the hotel we were staying at but weren't hungry enough to order as many dim sum dishes as we could get for a proper KenScale review (overall, pretty solid though). On the third day of our trip, Jun said she wanted to check out another place and we got a recommendation from a friend to check out Lai Hong Lounge. When we got there at around noon, the line was already huge and we were quoted over an hour-long wait. We initially debated whether we should check another place but decided to just wait despite the chilly San Francisco weather. Our friend who recommended the place eventually joined us too so we were able to sample more variety of dishes and the dim sum brunch turned out to be a pretty satisfying meal. \n\nUnlike the system where servers bring around dim sum carts, you can just mark on the menu which and how many plates you would like to get. Jun and I were giddy with the generous portion of shrimp dumpling, with the warm crunchy shrimp inside that was very satisfying to our palate. I wouldn't say steamed pork soup dumpling was the best I've ever had, but it was definitely above-average too. Our friend ordered a gigantic sliced fish porridge that I was a bit wary of trying at first, but the warm porridge turned out to be a perfect antidote to the chilly weather we had to withstand. Pork siu mai was also quite delicious. The best dish for me personally was the sticky rice in lotus leaf. I don't usually get this dish since the level of stickiness can get to an unmanageable level, but in this case the texture of the sticky rice was outstanding and worked so beautifully with the pork filling inside the lotus leaf. Combine all of these delicious dishes with a side of garlic pea sprout that displayed very nice balance of flavor, and you would easily conclude that the hour-long wait was actually worthwhile. \n\nThe restaurant doesn't take reservations and unfortunately doesn't text you once your table is ready. In other words, if they call out your name and you're not there, your table will be gone! The best path forward seems to be try to get there as early as possible or, if you're quoted hour-long waits, just put your name down and hang out nearby the area for a bit before heading back to the queue. Lai Hong looks like a typical Chinese dim sum restaurant (definitely more authentic than Yank Sing) where you may face some language barriers but overall the service was relatively efficient. It is definitely a place Jun and I wouldn't mind visiting again on our next visit to SF.", "author": "Ken S."}

They handed us a number, which they do call in order except if there is a table of 8 that can seat multiple parties and if you don't mind sharing, you can skip the line and go in. However, we opted out because we'd rather wait to dine in privacy. And you better make your way to the counter fast to get your number or else people will cut you! Lol.\n\nWe ordered the tripe, steamed shrimp dumplings, shu mai, shrimp rice roll, shrimp dumpling, sticky rice, walnut shrimp, and chicken feet. Walnut shrimp came out first. For 9.50, the size was disheartening. Everything else was bland and I want to contribute it to the later hour that we arrived, but it couldn't be all because of that. The chicken feet lacked flavor. The only thing that was right for us was the shrimp dumpling and shrimp rice roll. You can't mess that up. Shu mai was missing the spot. Was hoping it would be more savory. The saddest thing of all was that they didn't have chili oil, which I don't expect all dim sum places to have but that addition would have been so nice!

The quantity that comes with each item is marked in parentheses. Because it was our first time here we didn't realize that and ordered far too much for two people (probably selected 12-15 items), so the nice young girl's eyes grew wide when she saw our selections. \"TOO MUCH!\" she exclaimed, then proceeded to tell us how many choices we should order for us two, and she told us if we were still hungry we could always get more. \n\nWe made our order, put dessert for last on hold, and after a few minutes they began bringing our orders out in steaming little bamboo steamers, hot stone pots, and decorated plates.

The rice flour wrapper tasted like uncooked flour.  Inside, the shrimp tasted like shrimp sashimi.  I looked at the filling and it was grey, the color of raw shrimp.  I like shrimp sashimi, however knowing that this restaurant has low scores from the health department makes me hesitant to eat raw shrimp here.\n\nAfter we flagged down a server, we showed her the shrimp.  She said she would bring new har gow.  It took about 20 minutes and she brought cooked ones.  \n\nI think we will skip the har gow in the future.  Everything else was good, especially the shu mai and chicken feet.  \n\nIt's also hard to order because they don't push the food carts here.

Was in town for business for a week and my business partner is not a fan, so I knew I would have to go for dim sum the first day in SF.\n\nWalked my luggage up the hill and found the place and waited only about 10 minutes before I was seated.  Like many dim sum places I've been to, you write on the menu the amount of each item you want.  And there are a lot of items to choose from, so it can take a while.  I picked out a few items I was familiar with, such as steamed pork buns and honey walnut prawns and a few more I had not tried, such as the duck feet.  Everything I tried was flavorful and ample in size; I had way too much food but wanted to keep trying things.  All in all I was very pleased.  It may take a few minutes to get your server to pay attention to you, but that's typical for dim sum I've found.\n\nAll in all it was my favorite spot in San Francisco and would definitely like to go back with more people next time to try more things.", "author": "Tim B."}

While we were considering Mama's as it wasn't wrapped around the block, and Mo's as that grill looked good, we stopped off at Caffe Trieste and then figured dim sum would be a nice change to brunch.\n\nLike with every place around noon, there was a line, but we quickly got our number and told a 20 minute wait. We decided to walk around the block and when we arrived they had overestimated and we had to wait at least another 10 minutes to get back into the queue. The place is large but expect smaller parties to share larger tables. Definitely favors coming with a larger group.\n\nI had done my research so I had an idea of what I wanted, while my date focused on chicken and veggie items. We got:\n\nBaked Pork Buns - There is a reason these are in almost every review as they are unlike anything I've had before. HUGE pork buns in a bit more flaky bun than the more doughy or pie like contemporaries. Filled with bbq pork, these were really good, but again HUGE.\n\nBBQ Pork Puff - Also called \"Chinese Footballs\" these are my favorite at Kon Chau back in Miami. To date Kon Chau is the only one who does it the way I like (they call it deep fried minced meat balls). Wouldn't get these again.\n\nP/F Turnip Cake - I love turnip cake and would have tried the P/F Turnip Cake w/ XO sauce but didn't know if this would have shrimp and pork and wanted my date to try it. It had both. I am bad. These were good.\n\nSteamed Chicken Buns - As my date was concentrating on chicken dishes, I mentioned the chicken feat. She got these instead and liked them.\n\nSalt & Pepper Chicken Wings - Who doesn't like chicken wings? These were good, at 5 pieces on the plate. I got at least one, maybe two.\n\nDried Fried String Beans - We needed a green and these were really good. With a bit of heat!\n\nI enjoyed the place, but this place definitely favors groups.

The fact that the locals were eating here seemed a recommendation of sorts to me.  \n\nHoney glazed BBQ pork arrived first.  And it was terrible.  The honey glaze was absent.  Not absent however was a thick layer of chewy fat beneath each too thick slice of pork.  This plate of food never should have left the kitchen.\n\nPork and shrimp siu mai were much better.  They arrived table side piping hot and were filled with bits of shrimp interspersed between the pork filling. \n\nAt this point I ordered a main course of honey walnut prawns.  Within two minutes the food arrived, leading me to worry that it must have been prepared ahead of time.  But no, the lightly coated prawns were hot and fresh and not copiously smeared with mayonnaise.  The walnuts likewise were fresh, as they had that crunch that only fresh nuts have.  And they were sweet but not overly so.  \n\nSo the kitchen here can do some very good things and some things that are not good at all.

I've had my fair share of dim sum around the U.S., and this was so worth the (supposedly) higher prices. My grandma and I stopped in around 11:30 A.M.  There was already a short 5 - 10 minute wait. (And this was with a downpour outside!) It looked like locals frequented this place. \n\nFOOD (4/5): They have laminated menus that you write your order on with a whiteboard marker. (There are no pictures on the menus.). We ordered a pot of jasmine tea, which was promptly plopped on our table. We ordered our food, which consisted of a shrimp roll, fried shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp ball, siu mai, sticky rice, and fried sesame seed ball.  Oh delicious!  (Sorry! There's no carts here. There are too many tables crammed in.) The food came out as prepared, and each dish was hot. The only reason I docked a star was because they left the shell on my shrimp in the shrimp ball. At least it's homemade and fresh! But man... I was so surprised to find the shell still on. Other than that, it was superb! My grandma even raved that it was better than the last dim sum place she went to in San Francisco.\n\nSERVICE (5/5): Our server was attentive. The manager went out of her way to be helpful for my grandma, who couldn't eat well with chopsticks. Better service than you typically get at dim sum places!\n\nATMOSPHERE (5/5): Authentic. This isn't Americanized dim sum. The crowd eating at Lai Hong were Asians. You know a place is good when it's packed well before lunch rush. It's a pod atmosphere, so don't expect a quiet meal. \n\nHighly recommend! Will definitely come back.", "author": "Vanessa B."}

Even when stepping into the restaurant it felt very dank and smelled of urine. However, I figured a restaurant filled to the brim on a Monday must have great food at least. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we placed our order quickly using the fill-in menu and waited patiently for our food to arrive. To our dismay, it took over 20 minutes if not more for our first dish to arrive: the beef stew with noodles in a clay pot. At over $7, it was filled with noodles coated in duck sauce and a few pieces of meat. Our next few dishes of spareribs, chicken feet were only ok and my beef meatballs did not even come with worchester sauce! The only highlights were the beef and shrimp crepe noodles which were skillfully wrapped though could've used more soy sauce. \n\nService is brusque and slow, though our tea was refilled promptly and frequently. \n\nValue was poor at almost $40 for two for dimsum.

After a long Yelp search, we decided to try Lai Hong Lounge. When we arrived around 1:40pm, we were told there was a 15 or so minute wait. Their estimate was pretty accurate, which is always nice. There isn't much close by though so we just waited patiently near the entrance. \n\nOnce inside, we were met with a printed menu that you mark on with a marker to place your order. We ordered shrimp dumplings, shrimp chive dumplings, pork buns, chicken buns, garlic pea sprouts, sticky rice, vegetable dumplings, turnip cake, and sesame balls. Total cost was about $46, which is pretty good considering the deluge of food that arrived at our table. Each dumpling and turnip cake order is min 4 items, each bun order is 3 items, and each sticky rice order is two items. The vegetable was the most expensive dish at $8 but it was definitely worth it. They were out of water spinach sadly, so we went with the pea shoots but they satisfied our need for greens. Next time I'd order more greens and fewer different kinds of dumplings. \n\nOf all the dishes, my favorites were the pea shoots, the shrimp dumplings, and the chicken buns. The buns were fantastic. The wrappers on some of the dumplings were a little thick at the edges, but not so much so that they were an off-putting ratio of casing to contents.

The lines outside seemed like a good sign that we were making the right decision to try this place, although not good news for my ever-increasing hunger. When we finally got seated, we noticed a faint mildew smell, which was a little overpowering when we first entered, but kinda faded as we got used to it.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice is that they don't have carts here, and that you'll order with a dry-erase marker on a laminated menu. We kinda went for broke and ordered all the good stuff: shrimp dumplings, both baked and steamed BBQ pork buns, deep-fried taro dumplings, pan fried turnip cakes, pork shu mai, long rice noodle shrimp rolls, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, pork wrapped in tofu skin, along with a side of pea shoots, dry fry green beans, and scallion pancakes. Hoo boy. My favorites were the shrimp dumplings, the taro dumplings, and the baked pork buns. I would definitely get the baked pork buns again, especially since they are near impossible to find in New York and Philly, for some reason. Also, the shrimp dumplings (har gow), are huge compared to the ones I find on the East coast, so that's a plus.\n\nService was actually pretty good, relative to the very disaffected service I've gotten at dim sum joints all over the country. We got our water and tea refills pretty quickly, although the last couple dim sum dishes did take a while to come out. They were very apologetic, however, so I guess that is worth something. The prices were pretty decent, as I ordered pretty much two of everything, and it still only came out to $20 per person, which included tax and tip. Pretty good for brunch in this city.\n\nI would definitely come back, perhaps on the earlier side, for a good sit-down dim sum experience. Hopefully, they can get rid of that mildew smell sometime in the near future, but I guess that's wishful thinking.", "author": "Eric J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-25", "description": "When people ask me, \"Where's a good place in Chinatown to eat?\", I often shrug my shoulders. Unless you live in the area, most locals don't go to Chinatown for good Chinese food with the exception of take out from Kam Po (Chinese BBQ), Golden Daisy (crack chicken wangz), and Golden Gate Bakey (egg tarts). Getting to Chinatown and navigating through the area is worse than watching 80s porn with bush.  \n\nGetting back to the point...\n\nAfter dim summing it at Lai Hong Lounge, I now finally have a dim sum recommendation in Chinatown. Sorry, Obama but Great Eastern are for tourists. \n\nWe had time to kill during Tater Tot's grooming appointment nearby so we decided to stop by Lai Hong to see how long the wait was. It was a 10 minute wait at 11:15 am which is less than their sister restaurants, HK Lounge and HK Lounge II in Richmond (reservations taken for party of 8 or more only). When we left an hour later, there was a huge crowd waiting so come early! Parking is an even bigger nightmare in that location so I would recommend Lai Hong because at least they have nearby parking garages. \n\nThere's no dim sum carts at Lai Hong. Instead, you're given a menu and marker to make your dim sum selection. The menu is vast with every dim sum item you can imagine. The English translations were whacked for some dishes so do ask your server for the correct translations. Most dishes are $3-$6 with rice and noodle dishes $10-$12. MSG usage is minimal [in the dishes we ordered] as I didn't have a bad reaction as I usually do with other dim sum places. There's a $1 pp charge for tea, whether you drink it or not. They accept 1 credit card max per a table so bring cash if you're dining in a group. Expect to spend about $20-25 pp including tip. \n\nSince it was just the two us, we were only able to order a limited amount of items: http://bit.ly/1MRsFBE\n*Baked Pork Bun ($3.95)\n*Shrimp Noodle ($4.95)\n*\"Peanut Chicken Feet\" was actually steamed chicken feet w/ ginseng, ginger, and peanuts ($6.95)\n*Steamed Pork Dumplings ($3.75)\n*Pig Feet in Candy Plum Sauce ($4.95)\n*Steamed Pork Spareribs w/ black bean sauce ($3.50)\n*Steamed Shrimp Dumplings ($4.75)\n*Deep Fried Taro Dumpling ($3.50)\n*Durian Puffs ($4.95)\n\nEverything is made to order so it did take about 10-15 minutes before we received the first dish. \n\nFor the most part, everything was solid and on-par with HK Lounge and HK Lounge II which I also gave 4 stars. Standouts were the Shrimp Noodle Roll, Steamed Shrimp Dumplings, and Deep Fried Taro Dumplings. The Shrimp Noodle Roll was the best I've had, each piece had a large, tender shrimp blanketed with a silky soft layer of rice noodles. So good. The Shrimp Dumplings also had large pieces of tender shrimp encased with a glutionously chewy wrapper (not too thick). The Taro Dumplings were hot from the fryer. The exterior had an airy crunch while the fluffy taro center was filled with a deliciously savory pork filling. \n\nUsually I love their Baked Pork Bun (same as HK Lounge's) which has a pineapple bun like buttery crown but it was off that day. The filling was sparse and a funky aftertaste. I love durian and there was no shortage of stinky durian filling in the puffs but the exterior was really dry. I favor Koi Palace's rendition. \n\nThe Pig's Feet was nostalgic as I use to eat this growing up during Chinese New Year. The Pork Spareribs didn't have much meat and neither did the Peanut Chicken Feet so I would skip these next time. \n\nService was the typical Chinesey service. The hostess was really nice but if you want something from the wait staff, you have to wave them down.  \n\nLai Hong is half the size of HK Lounge but still can accommodate a good amount of large groups. It's loud and boisterous with no tourists in sight.\n\nAfter dim summing it, we headed down the block to The Boardroom for a digestive. We met a hilariously funny dude (read: drunk) who line danced to Tupac then shouted, \"I want to have sex...I need to find someone to have sex with!\" Oh San Francisco, how I love you!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

At 9:40, my friend and I got the option of joining an existing table and decided to go for it, despite the awkwardness of sitting across a table from strangers. We sat there from 9:40 to 10:30 (almost a full hour) with ZERO interactions with any waiters/waitresses, minus our completed menu getting randomly collected. Best part was that the two rando people sitting across from us got all of their food and finished it, before we had been served a single dish.\n\nFinally at 10:30, I manage to flag down a waiter and ask where our food was. Hello? Hi? He started bringing food over soon after. Still no water, until we explicitly asked. The food also came in random intervals, with\u00a0our dessert arriving as the second or third dish.\n\nThe food is great, don't get me wrong, but the service...

The food is definitely 5 stars, they lose a star more for the ambiance. I think Dim Sum is normally for bigger groups, but we were visiting so it was just the 2 of us and that was hard. It took a LONG time to get seated (over an hour) and when we finally did we had to share a table with a woman who was by herself because their smallest tables are for 4 people. So that was awkward....And even though no one spoke English, or barely spoke English, you could feel how stressed out the staff was. This was a Monday holiday, so maybe they weren't prepared for the weekend-like crowd. \n\n100% I would go again, but suggest going with a group. Or wish we would have put our name in and then gone and walked around and come back. Waiting outside in the cold was not enjoyable. Also, they only accept 1 credit card per table, which seems crazy for something that is usually done in big groups.\n\nEverything is also made to order, which I've never experienced before. I was used to them going around with everything on carts, this was not that. Perhaps that is why everything was so delicious!", "author": "Stacy H."}

For example, today I brought my brother and his girlfriend who were visiting from out of town. After we were seated, the waiter all but disappeared. He pretty much never came back. The dishes are all ancient and chipped, the restaurant is old and kind of dirty...Then during our meal, a fight broke out in the kitchen and the disgruntled chef screamed and yelled in Cantonese both in the back, and at one point came out into the restaurant to yell more at all of the patrons sitting there eating....we finish our meal, (which by the way their food quality has gone down which is super unfortunate because their dim sum used to be my favorite) and finally manage to flag down the manager after waiting for thirty minutes for a waiter to get us our bill. We ask if she can split between two cards and she gets super weird about it, like it was super inconvenient before finally just doing it. After we paid, my brother's girlfriend asked what the tip should be and at the bottom of my receipt it said $3. I didn't think to do the math, and I didn't realize that the tip had been split up on the two receipts so I told her $3. We get up to leave, and the manager comes over to grab the receipts, pulls out the money, quickly counts it and demands more tip. She straight up demanded that we tip her more. First of all, it was an honest mistake we weren't trying to be stingy, second she didn't even deserve the tip because the food sucked and the service was worse!! She made a scene and treated us like we short changed the bill. It was super embarrassing and everyone was staring because she made it seem like we didn't pay for our meal and kept saying we owed her more money. So tacky.

I marked it down to 4 stars just because of how disorganized and chaotic it felt. But this truly is a hotspot. It's packed for a reason.

That's all thanks to my dad for earning his stars and stripes as an elite dim sum connoisseur, who frequented these places even on the weekdays.\n\nAnyway, since I moved to SF, I don't have my dad around to utilize his VIP status. I knew I needed to arrive early. Early means 10:30am or earlier! Well, shit happened and I arrived at 11:10am. I thought, \"maybe I'll get lucky since it's still before 11:30am.\" WRONG!!!\n\nGot my # at 11:10am, and got seated an hour and a half later. Was it worth the wait? HELL NO. The lady in charge of calling #'s is seriously incompetent. Her voice is whisper soft, no one could hear her, and she skipping #'s, including mine. A ridiculous fight broke out between her and a cantonese customer who claimed her # kept getting overlooked. They were going at it, it was crazy!!!\n\nThe food was definitely good, especially the baked pork buns, which has a \"bolo bao\" exterior. Other things we ordered that were good were the garlic pea shoots, shrimp balls, beef noodle rolls, etc. Some things I won't order here again: sesame balls and pancake.\n\nSince I was already in the area, I walked over to Golden Gate Bakery to get me some egg tarts.

So it's understandable that service might not be as fast, nonetheless, the service was way too slow in serving our food. There were barely any waiters in sight to ask for napkins, extra plate, or refill of water/tea. It didn't help that they also forgot our orders. \n\nFood - The abalone with pea leaves was good, but got a little salty as you eat more of it. The yellow feathered chicken was delicious, especially with the ginger scallion oil. Usually in other restaurants, the ginger scallion oil is too salty, but the one they offered was just perfect. Our order also came with rice, which was filled with different type of grains.

If you are a small party, be prepared to share a table, like you would in the Hong Kong dim sum \"palaces\".  It's a great way to see and ask what to order as there are no pictures of the dim sum on the laminated ordering card (you use a marker to indicate how many orders you want then hand it to the waiter) and the English name that is listed (along with the Chinese characters) is pretty generic...I know the Chinese pronunciations but couldn't tell you what the Chinese characters are and they don't use the old fashioned rolling carts. \n\nThe Siu Mai (steamed pork dumplings), pan fried shrimp and chives dumplings and the Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) were  good...the fillings were flavorful and substantial. The shrimp noodles (whole shrimp wrapped in flat rice noodles and steamed, served in a pool of sweet soy sauce) were excellent! The sheet noodles are silky and delicate and doesn't feel heavy, so all you taste is the shrimp.  If I had had more sense, I should have ordered the pork noodles or the fish and chives one, as they would have been an interesting comparison. \n\nI would recommend letting any of the steamed dumplings rest for a few minutes before trying to pick them up. The wrappers are so delicate that they literally disintegrate...when allowed to cool just a bit, they will be much easier to handle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-03", "description": "TL;DR: Food - 5 stars; service - 2 stars; rounding up to 4 stars on average.\n\nI was so excited to finally try this place, because I saw that they have some of my favorite dim sum dishes that can be a little harder to find (in particular, sticky fried rice and fried shredded taro + shrimp cakes; I've noticed that places with smaller dim sum menus often skip those in favor of their cousins, the lotus leaf-wrapped sticky rice and fried taro balls. This place has tons and tons of options!). Anyway, I showed up with a small group on a Saturday morning at 10:30, and although there was a line out the door, we actually didn't have to wait as long as we expected - only about 20 minutes. The number calling system was very organized and efficient.\n\nWhen we were seated and given the menu, they didn't give us a pen to mark our choices with, and it took forever to flag someone down to fix that. Not a huge problem, but annoying. \n\nOk, onto the food. We ordered a TON. Definitely too much, but, hey, leftovers! We got:\n\nSTICKY FRIED RICE (duh, one of my favorite things ever): Pretty good. Large portion (but not overwhelming), and comes with peanuts on top (rather than herbs, which is what I've seen before), but good. \n\nSALTY MEAT PORRIDGE: Hilariously unappetizing description, but very delicious dish. The scallions served on the side were fresh and yummy as well. \n\nXO RICE NOODLES: Delicious! One of my favorite dishes of the meal. Just the right amount of spicy. Note to future self: absolutely order this again, no excuses!\n\nCHICKEN FEET WITH PEANUTS: This was my first time eating chicken feet, so I don't have anything to compare them to and was a little nervous, but it was good! The logistics of eating a chicken foot were tough to figure out (again, first time), and I didn't really get any peanut flavor, but they tasted pretty good and were super juicy. Overall a success, though I'm not sure that I enjoyed the flavor enough to order them again, given how hard they were to eat. \n\nFRIED SESAME BALLS: Nothing special, but ticked all the right marks. This is one of my husband's favorite treats, and it hit the spot. \n\nEGG CUSTARD TARTS: Ditto the sesame balls, but this time it's one of MY favorite treats :-) Nice and flaky and warm and custardy. Good ratio of filling to crust. \n\nSTICKY RICE IN LOTUS LEAF: Also one of my favorite dim sum dishes in general. They make a good one!\n\nSTUFFED TOFU: The tofu and shrimp were really tasty, but I thought the sauce was a little heavy and overpowered the delicate taste of the tofu a bit. I scarfed these babies down happily, but left most of the sauce behind.\n\nSHRIMP NOODLE ROLL: Perfectly good dish, and I enjoyed the presentation (the waiter put the dish on the table, then cut the noodles in half with scissors, then poured the sauce on top), but not super special. \n\nFRIED SHREDDED TARO CAKE: This was a bit disappointing - as I mentioned earlier, a craving for this dish was one of the main reasons for coming here in the first place. However, the cakes weren't crispy, and were actually kind of soggy. I was hoping for some crunch!\n\nBAKED PORK BUNS: These were a revelation. OMG. Usually I prefer steamed pork buns to baked, but I had heard such good things about these particular baked ones that I had to give them a shot, and I'm SO glad I did. Absolutely delicious. The outside of the bun had this wonderful delicate crisp that contrasted so well to the soft interior. Not too chewy, not to sweet, but just the right amount of bold flavor. I was beyond full by the time these came out, but it was so good that I enjoyed every bite nonetheless! \n\nSERVICE: Left something to be desired. We ordered another dish that never came out (the donut noodle roll), and towards the end of the meal the staff seemed to have forgotten our entire corner of the restaurant - our tea stopped being filled, and we wanted to ask for some water and the check but no one was coming around. Several people from different tables around us got so impatient that they actually went over to the waiters' area and took their own soup bowls/take out boxes because no one was helping them! They shouldn't have needed to do that. By the time we flagged someone down, we told them to just cancel the last dish and bring the check, so the meal ended on a bit of a downer, unfortunately.\n\nHOWEVER, nearly all the dishes that we did eat were really really really delicious! And I'm super excited to dig into those leftovers tomorrow :-)", "author": "Liz F."}

Fantastic!\n-Fish and chive rice noodle roll - usually I order the shrimp version of this dish but the fish version was decent. I do wish it had a bit more filling to balance out the tender rice noodle part.

The sauce is good too!\n-Stuffed eggplant - great flavor with four large pieces of eggplant and a modest chunk of meat in the middle. A bit oily as most Chinese eggplant dishes are.\n-Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf - Exactly how it sounds, this dish resembles a tamale where you unwrap the leaf and enjoy the flavored rice inside.

Lai Hong Lounge needs to convert its tables quickly, so the food comes out quickly, so you should also not eat slowly. Lai Hong is popular so service might be a bit pushy. You'll probably wait 30 minutes for a table by noon on a weekday.\n\nA downside to dim sum with two people is that you can't order too much. My friend and I ordered 7 dishes and the bill came to 30 dollars total. The quality is good and the portion sizes are great. Now, let me tell you what we ordered. You get a laminated piece of paper and a marker where you write the quantity you want to order next to the item name.\n\n1. Taro Cake- 3 stars because it was just okay and not piping hot when it arrived. Also it was dry. Must eat with tea. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#EvJn4edjuwdkTOA-Ynk2wQ\n\n2. Shrimp dumplings (haar gaau) - 4 stars came really hot, which is good. Had soup inside like the Shanghainese xiaolongbao. Beware how you eat it so the soup doesn't spill onto your plate and make a mess. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#s4-p63wzPFE49yJnURjMmQ\n\n3. Char siu bao (steamed pork buns) - 4.5 stars. A staple. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#53peXgDQix9opGC91pZOVQ\n\n4. beef coeng fan (beef rice paper roll) - 4.5 stars. The rice paper wrapping had great texture. The sweet soy sauce was a nice touch. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#dncgdFhATm6d7aXzCPWDvQ\n\n5. Chicken feet - 4 stars. Of course you have to eat around the bone and spit it out, but that's to be expected. Great seasoning. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#b9EnhAk4YnkUPBi4iMbRkA\n\n6. Shrimp in fried tofu skin - 3 stars. It was crispy, but tepid. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#vdEWNmM_J3C3UKYg5kDtJA\n\n7. coconut red bean jelly - 3.5 stars. Sweet dessert for a satisfying ending. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#Q-MymS7jcWQlQyWAxzHB8Q\n\n8. Jasmine tea- yes, they charge for tea, but not having it while you eat dim sum negates the definition of yumcha.\n\nI hope that helped. You should pick the dishes your family enjoys too. I went off Julianna I.'s review to get ideas about what to order. And bring a Cantonese speaker! That is very important.\n\nHere's everything we ordered, in Chinese so you can order the same thing when you see the menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lai-hong-lounge-san-francisco?userid=mytKvjicBhxKbwbSWSIWrA#-uqROiv-bQavE3OveGyDmg", "author": "John J."}

Either they forgot us or we were skipped, but we checked in with them as soon as we heard they passed our number and they let us in. (We were also standing right in front of the check-in desk the whole time, though.)\n\nService:\nWe had to ask them to give us water. They served us tea automatically but I think there was an extra charge for this. We had to flag someone down to get the check (on the plus side, once you're in, they don't rush you). Place seemed pretty clean, but I didn't get a look at the bathrooms. The menu has names of items in Chinese and English, but the receipt is only in Chinese.\n\nFood:\nOrdered vegetable dumplings, shrimp dumplings, deep fried taro, some sort of pork pastry, savory pancakes, sticky rice in banana leaf, and egg tart. I can't speak to the authenticity, but it was all delicious, and the deep fried taro in particular was excellent. Nothing was overly salty and the portions of filling were solid.\n\nPrice:\n$37 before tip for 3 people, and everyone was full.\n\nRecommendation:\nI would come back here.

We were given tea right away, which was a $1 charge per person (this actually isn't uncommon at dim sum). I'm used to being asked what type of tea I wanted but their default seemed to be jasmine, which is my preference anyway.\n\nFor the two of us, I ordered a sticky rice, shrimp crepe, shrimp dumpling (har gow), pork dumpling (siu mai), baked bbq buns, almond egg yolk balls, fried shrimp egg rolls, and stuffed eggplant. We devoured everything minus 1 bun and 1 almond egg yolk ball, because I would have vomited if I ate any more.\n\nFood came out in a timely manner. BBQ pork buns came last and rightfully so, as these baked bad boys (which I don't see in Chi-town) were to die for! I'm not even big into sweet pork but the buns itself were airy and light af! These were beyond amazing! Get them!!! There were 3 buns to an order and each were massive. The almond yolk balls were also amazing and also something I don't find in Chicago. They were glutinous but delicious!!! Get these too! The stuffed eggplant were very large and yummy. These are stuffed with a fish/shrimp paste. The shrimp crepe was divine and unforgettable. Best I've ever had. Shrimp were huge and fresh, crepe was nice and thin. The sticky rice was also a standout. My boo who isn't a foodie like I am and who hasn't had much ethnic food in his life right away noticed that this was much better than what we've had before in other places. Their sticky rice here used a thin paper wrap over the lotus leaf, which was the first time I saw this. This must be part of what made this so great. Also, they used fresh shrimp inside, instead of dried shrimp. Everything else was very good too.\n\nService was good. Everyone was helpful and efficient. Prices were comparable to Chicago...obviously more expensive than L.A. and NY but quality of food can't be beat!\n\nIt's been two weeks and I'm still thinking about dim sum at Lai Hong...specifically the shrimp crepe, sticky rice, almond egg yolk balls, and baked BBQ buns!\n\nNo lie, I would come back to SF just so I can get dim sum here.", "author": "Amanda M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-25", "description": "So my quest for the best dim sum in the West Coast of North America brings me to San Francisco this time. I was there to check out a relatively new place highly recommended to me by several of my Bay Area Yelp friends.\n\nOwned and operated by the same ownership as the famed Hong Kong Lounge and Hong Kong Lounge II, the quality of the dim sum at Lai Hong Lounge was a notch above its predecessors.\n\nAt around 10:30AM on a Saturday morning, we waited for about an hour for a table.  I never complain or worry about the wait at a good dim sum place.  In fact, I am puzzled by people's complaints in their reviews.  A lot of people waiting means the food is good.  If there is no wait, I won't even eat there.  However, on weekends the wait could be really long as the place is rather small and its fame is drawing a really large crowd.  Next time I'll go there on a weekday.\n\nAll the basic staples like har gow, siu mai, rice noodle, etc. were yummy and authentic.  This really justifies the big crowd and the long wait.  The rice noodle was thin and soft just like it's supposed to be.  The filling was delicious.  Har gow skin was thin and perfectly slightly chewy.  The texture and taste of the siu mai were legit.\n\nOne dish in particular that I highly recommend is the stuffed mushrooms in black bean sauce.  It was definitely one of the best stuffed mushrooms from all the dim sum places that I've been to.  The mushrooms were fresh and juicy, and the black bean sauce was da bomb.  I will definitely order this dish every time I go there.\n\nThere were no carts so every dish was freshly made and served piping hot - exactly the way dim sum should be served.  They were served so hot that I had to wait for the steam to escape before taking my pictures.  KUDOS for that!\n\nService was just like most typical Chinese restaurants - adequate but nothing above or beyond.  Place is small so tables are very close to each other and there's somewhat of a cramped feeling there.  But if you go there for the food and you are used to cramped Chinese restaurants, this probably will not bother you.\n\nOverall a very solid 4-star dim sum experience, and I am glad that I am adding Lai Hong Lounge to my short list of the best dim sum restaurants in the West Coast of North America.", "author": "Rob L."}

I can't imagine a worse plight than to be stuck with an amorphous pile of mashed potatoes, or a heap of monotonous spaghetti. I need variety, excitement, diversity. That's why, my dear ones, I love Tapas, and mostly, Dim Sum. Every dish is different! Prices are low! Experiment! Try things you wouldn't usually order! Live a little!\n\nMy first experiences with dim sum have been in small stores along china town like Wing Sing Bakery, with winding lines out the door, and pink boxes filled with tantalizing sweets, and savory morsels. Unfortunately, where I live has no Dim Sum worth eating, so it's to San Rafael to House of Lee, or down to SF where it all began. \n\nAfter getting the Dim Sum jones from seeing my SF yelp friends eating it on the daily, I jealously persuaded my extended family to meet in SF. For the what seemed like a long two hours, we were the only Caucasians in the entire restaurant. I took this as a good sign, that they weren't editing their food for the masses to be Americanized, that they were traditional, culturally accurate, and worth taking your family there to eat (whether or not this is accurate, you can decide).\n\nWe ordered the Walnut Prawns to start, which were delicate, lightly flavored, and not overcooked.  The Tamago Tofu was one of the most interesting foods I've had in awhile, steamed, topped with a shrimp apiece, and then dipped in a gravy and sprinkled in green onions. Pine nut chicken lettuce wraps were good, but mostly average, with the obligatory hoisin sauce and chopped mushrooms.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed eggplant was both Amazing and Terrible, some pieces were cooked enough, and others were still too al dente, but the ones that were fully cooked were delightful, soft, and salty. Bok Choi with pork bone broth was an interesting take on a veggie dish, I was expecting something a little more bone marrow-y but it was closer to joints than bones whole.  Sesame bean balls were not fully cooked, so the mochi inside was still starchy, which was unappealing to me, but the overall flavor was good.\n\nMy favorite item was the steamed pork buns, which I hesitate to admit I'd never had before. They were pillowy mountains of dough, surrounding sweet, tangy, and salty bbq pork. I was sad to see my dad polish off the last one, and I am already planning my next trip to get my hands on more. \n\nOverall, I was excited for a sit-down dim sum experience, and even more excited to try things I hadn't in the past. I'm super looking forward to going there soon, but this time for lunch, as their dim sum lunch menu is HUGE, and has things that feed my soul like black sesame sweets, and fried goodies galore.", "author": "Leah S."}

My bf and I came here on a sunday night at 7:30 pm. When we got here, we were seated after a 5 minute wait. Next when we sat down we got the laminated menu.  The hostess gave us a tea pot that was filthy on the outside, marks and stains, not sure from where. It was filthy. Next, we ordered the food we ordered one lemon chicken, one honey walnut shrimp, one mushroom stuffed shrimp, and one preserved duck egg with pork porridge. The porridge came first, in a bowl that make it appear half empty. The taste was pretty bland, if you've had good porridge you know that even though it is porridge, it's not supposed to taste bland. Rather there is supposed to be a savory taste to it. Next came the mushroom shrimp. The shrimp was not fresh within the mushroom, the sauce on top was very bland they added a little of the black beans in there, but it wasn't tastey at all. The mushroom was okay, when you bite into it, you would expect there to be a stronger taste. It was not great at all. Next came the honey walnut shrimp, it was $15 for the dish, a good amount of shrimp but the sauce again failed. They need to add more honey, and lemon into it for a better taste. I've made honey walnut shrimp myself and I know what it should taste like. Next, came the lemon chicken. That was the worst. The chicken was so dry and it was hard to bite the chunks into pieces. The chicken was thinned out, fried with too much batter that was to dry. The sauce was way below standards. The ratio of sauce to chicken was probably 4:1. Overall it was a dissapointing experience when it comes to service, food, and quality. I definitely would not come back. This place is not worth it. Before we were done, the waiter kept standing there cleaning the dishes while we were trying to eat. They pulled the plates away from us while we were still finishing..with food on it. And then, to top it off, she kept standing there looking at what tip I was going to give her. Never in the 30 minutes that we were there did anyone come by to check on us. No extra napkins, no refills on drinks. When I gave her the tip, she told me I tipped her too low and that I needed to add more. No, there is no way. That is just rude, and disrespectful.

Not bad. \n\nWe had my son's favorite Crystal Shrimp which had candied walnuts. He loves the walnuts. Nice big shrimp soaked in a white cream sauce. Not bad. Also had the Peking Duck. Little biscuits with duck skin with some duck meat. You open the biscuit and put the duck skin and put this sauce on it. Really good but not that healthy.

I prefer the ones at Yank Sing. I would try the custard buns next time. \n* Deep fried crab shrimp claw. Good but would skip next time. \n* Baked pork buns\n* XLB - not as good here. The wrapper is too thick. \n\nThe not so good:\n* Steamed egg custard dumplings\n* PF tofu skin\n\nOther items looked good too, but unfortunately I never bring enough people with me to order more food.", "author": "Vivian H."}

Obviously, the number of options for dim sum in SF are overwhelming, but I wanted more authentic Cantonese dim sum at a place that wasn't too overrun with tourists. So after checking with the Yelposphere, I rolled the dice and settled on Lai Hong Lounge. That gamble paid off. BIG TIME. \n\nArrived around 1:30 pm on a Friday, and while there weren't any tourists, there was a myriad of locals out the door also waiting for a table. Even though the wait was lengthy (about an hour), it's a testament to the quality of a place when even the locals are willing to endure the wait, so my friends and I stuck around until our table was called. In term of aesthetics, nothing out of the ordinary -- fairly small space, a few pictures lining the walls, mostly large round tables for bigger parties. But you don't come to a dim sum joint for the aesthetics. And as you've probably already read, they don't have service carts here and you mark your orders on a laminated menu. \n\nSo how a'bao we get to the good stuff? The fooooood. Thankfully, like me, my friends also have a weakness for all things shrimp dim sum so we ordered several plates of the shrimp dumplings and shrimp long roll. To round out our proteins, the pork siu mai, pork long roll, and beef chow fun. Oh yea, and the turnip cake (because this counts as veggies, right?). Everything was tasty and totally hit spot, but of course the standouts for me were the shrimp -- much larger than ones I've had at places in Chi-town or NYC. Just so plump, sweet, and juicy. Add a little soy sauce, and damn...such a perfect bite.\n\nThe service was decent, and it helped that all the staff spoke some English. The food came out fairly quickly, but it took a while to try to get refills on our waters. The prices were more than fair (especially for SF standards), came out to about $15 per person. Given the amount of food we ate, it was really such a steal. Overall, an awesome experience. Definitely worth a try if you're in the Bay area. And even if you're not a fan, remember... you dim sum, you lose some... Okay, I'm done now.", "author": "Joel P."}

When you're seated you order, and they put a tag with your order on the table (it will match your number.) Soon, the food will begin arriving all perfectly staggered. and it will be piping hot as it was made to order (as far as I can tell.). The har gow, taro, and siu mai were excellent. I liked the taste of the rice rolls, but the noodles were a little gummy. XLBs were ok with nice thin skins, but a little grisly. Definitely there was ton of chemical contaminant (msg) on everything, so if you're sensitive to msg this is probably not the place for you.\n\nThe waitstaff were all lovely and didn't even laugh when I attempted to order something in Cantonese. \n\nTotal bill for three with some leftovers was about $40.\n\nPS While you're waiting for a table go across the street and get a haircut at Super Performance, and after you're done eating wander into North Beach for an espresso. \nAlltogether it made for a nice afternoon....", "author": "El B."}

We saw plenty of dim sum restaurants but either the line was too long or the place was empty. Unable to choose, we opened the Yelp app to help determine where the best dim sum was. Somehow, we decided on Lai Hong Lounge. \n\nWhen first walking up, the place doesn't seem like much. The overhang is fading and the menus outside are hard to read. When you walk in, it seems like a banquet room. The place is so much larger than it appears on the outside! Tons of folks were inside eating and waiting for a table. It was loud and busy, but the hostess was all smiles as she took down our name and told us it would be about a 15 minute wait. In less than 10 minutes, we were seated. They brought us water and a pot of tea. I'm not sure what type of tea it was, but it was delicious. It also really added to the experience. In addition to our drinks, they gave us a large laminated menu with a Crayola marker to choose the items we wanted to order. \n\nI don't remember half the names of the items we got, but we definitely ordered too much food! I know we got a mixed meat pot which had some delicious squid in it. We also got two varieties of dumplings - one steamed and the other fried. These were good, but the steamed buns we ordered were the best. We ordered both steamed pork buns and steamed custard buns. Oh, these were to die for. The pork buns were soft and savory. Definitely one of my favorites. The steamed custard buns were an amazing sweet treat. The custard inside was sweet, creamy, and all around delicious. My husband said it was the best bun he had. For dessert, we ordered a coconut red bean dessert - sort of a jelly dessert. I didn't care for it, but my husband liked it. \n\nOverall, it was a fun and unique experience. I'd definitely recommend it if you are in the area and craving dim sum.", "author": "Nicole B."}

(#sorrynotsorry)\n\nAfter reading through countless reviews and scrolling through so many delicious-looking pictures, I decided Lai Hong Lounge would be a great place to get authentic dim sum in San Francsico.  \n\nWe came here shortly after it opened (9:30) on Saturday and were lucky enough to avoid any lines. We were seated right away and given a laminated menu and a marker.  This is where you can get in big trouble if your eyes are bigger than your stomach!  You read through the menu items and mark off how many orders of each particular item.  Warning: these aren't little dinky tiny dumplings.  These are decently sized orders and anything that has shrimp comes with huge pieces of shrimp.  \n\nWe ordered Shrimp Dumplings, Pork Shrimp Siu Mai, (2) Shrimp Noodle Roll, Chinese Doughnut Noodle Roll, Beef Short Rib, Steamed Pork Buns, Broccoli w/ Oyster Sauce, Tofu Skin Roll w/ Pork & Shrimp, Stuffed Tamago Tofu w/ Shrimp, and Singapore Style Noodles.  #noragrets   \nThe orders take a little bit of time (they don't come out all at once), but I was fine with that because that made it seem like each order was made and brought out fresh from the kitchen.\n\nI would say the shrimp noodle roll and the Chinese Doughnut roll are a definite MUST! The Singapore style noodles and tofu skin roll w/ pork and shrimp were ok (could've done without especially because we ordered so much).

I am writing this review is to share with others my bad experience due to my stupidity. When they served the first course meal, I already noticed that something is not correct, but at that moment, I was reluctant to complaint because in our culture we don't like to make a scandal during a happy occasion because that is so embarrasing to the guest. I should have double check with them that we will be getting the exact correct foods that I ordered. But since I trusted them, I missed to double check. The following are the menu they messed up; Crabmeat with Fish Maw, instead of crabmeat, they gave scrambled egg white, instead of Fish Maw, they gave us fried pork skin. For the Scallop and Squid with sweet peas, I only see squid ( cheaper )and no Scallop (more expensive) at all. I ordered Shrimp noodle, they gave us canned button mushroom (cheaper).

Something, I work hard to earn. My company doesn't simply give me more incentive, just for doing my job. The better I perform, with more effort - the more I get paid.

This is because on our way out, the waitress asked my dad for \"$1 extra dollar for tip\"... WHO DOES THAT?!?!?! So ridiculously rude!

I thought a 15% tip with good food, minus the inattentive service, was plenty for lunch. \n\nIt just leaves you in a crappy mood for the rest of the afternoon. It turns my smile, upside down.

I have been fortunate enough to travel the world and live in Los Angeles with a sea of countless dim sum restaurants and I can easily say nothing compares to Lai Hong Lounge. \n\nWhile the wait can be daunting, if you are willing to share a table with possibly one or two other parties it will greatly reduce your wait. i.e. we arrived and were told it would be a one hour+ wait for three people, twenty minutes later we were offered space at a shared table with a party of two college students and few young professionals. The experience was extremely pleasant and a highlight of the dining and made for some delightful conversation.\n\nIf you are looking for a dim sum cart experience this is not the place for you. You order from an extensive menu of selections that are cooked to order in typical dim sum portions. For those of you that are vegetarians you will not go hungry as they have a large selection of meat free options, which is not typical of a dim sum restaurant.\n\nHead to Lai Hong Lounge and you will not be disappointed.

This place may is on par to being authentic tastes and flavors of what dim sum should be.  The only problem is I grew up in Seattle and ate a lot of dim sum there as well as Vancouver, B.C. So I became very accustomed to a certain style.  \nIt's kind of like eating Pho is the US - it's very different tasting in Vietnam.\n\nThis place was packed - I was extremely hungry and hoping it was worth the wait.  It wasn't the same style of serving that I'm used to, which is having the hot carts being pushed around with stacks of steamers with the dim sum inside.  They will open each one and you can visually see what you're ordering.  At LHL, it's just a laminated menu and you mark what you want.  The problem for me is that I know what it's called in Chinese but the menu was in Chinese (which I can't read) but it was also translated into english (which I didn't know the translations).  So we were guessing what we normally eat to try it.\n\nEverything was pretty fresh but the flavors were a little bland to me and the hot sauce at the table was very vinegary and not very spicy.  The chicken feet skin wasn't flavorful and very tough.  Congee was bland and my favorite are shrimp balls but there were steamed so much there was a bunch of water inside the ball itself (which led me to believe it was frozen shrimp) and the pork dumplings are my absolute favorite but they too were a bit bland and fell apart too easily.\n\nNothing there was bad... but it was far from good or hitting my craving for dim sum.", "author": "Nam N."}

Well, as a sign of the times, Great Eastern has priced themselves off the neighborhood locals' dining list, hence there is often no wait for lunch there.  The overflow of locals now flock here as their quality is decent and prices are reasonable.   \nThen, why only two stars? \nWell, I don't believe it's good business for someone to answer a telephone call from a potential customer, ask him to hold, and place the telephone down without ever picking it back up.  After hearing ten minutes of conversations between staff and regular customers (how would I know they were regular?) intermittently interrupted by silence, I hung up the phone.  Still wanting to place my takeout order, I waited about thirty minutes and called again to the wonderful sound of a busy signal.  I called every five minutes for the next half hour to hear that sound... perhaps, you decided to leave the phone off the hook (intentional or not)?!\nLet's just say that's not the best way to draw much less keep customers.  \nAs mentioned, the saving grace is that food and cost are decent and reasonable.  \nLet's hope that you pay as much attention to the third aspect... service... and earn those stars back!", "author": "Mike C."}

Just look at the picture...it was only about 2/3 of our total order!\n\nFor a total party of six, we did the best/worst job ever of ordering food - roughly 19 different things, with multiples for a few of them (we cancelled a couple too!).  You know, a light breakfast to start the day:\n\nPork Siu Mai, Chinese Donut Wrapped in Rice Noodle, Lotus Leaf Wrapped Sticky Rice, Chicken Feet, Potstickers, Pork Spareribs, Egg Tart (Dahn Tat), Steamed Custard Bun, Steamed Custard and Egg Yolk Bun, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, Veggie Dumpling, Shrimp and Chive Dumpling, Peppered Beef Spareribs, Shrimp Wrapped Rice Noodle, Soup Dumplings, Fried Turnip, Pork Buns, Coconut and Red Bean Cake, and Lotus Sesame Balls.\n\nIndividual pictures?  Sorry, but no.  At one point, they even had to pop up our table's extender just to accommodate the last few dishes after we ran out of space.  I blame their ordering system instead of ourselves though - it's harder to gauge the size of dishes and to pace ourselves when picking dishes off a sheet rather than the carts dim sum places used to have.  Yeah, that was why...\n\nFor the most part, everything was pretty good, but there were a few highlights - Chicken Feet, Egg Tart (Dahn Tat), Lotus Leaf Wrapped Sticky Rice, and the Pork Siu Mai.  The worst?  The Peppered Beef Spareribs (straight up gross) and the Veggie Dumpling (ugh...cilantro).\n\nConsidering we were able to get all that food for about $140 and how there wasn't much of a wait, Lai Hong just might become my go to dim sum joint.  Kind of a bummer that it's in Chinatown, where street parking is as easy to get as a date with Kate Upton, but at least there's a parking garage around the corner.

There was a bit of a line outside, but no worries - the actual interior is quite spacious, with plenty of seating for all (at least initially - it was filled up by the time we left almost an hour later). Ordering is quite simple - you have a laminated menu that you mark your choices on, and each dish comes out as it is done. Service is pretty straightforward for a Chinese joint - you get your food brought out and items on your receipt crossed off.\n\nYou'll have to wait a bit to get your first bite, instead of grabbing plates of a cart - everything is cooked back in the kitchen. That said, definitely get some of the pork puns; the bread, which seems to be a crunchier version of brioche but not quite as fluffy, is really good. Everything else is very solid for dim sum, from the dumplings to the lotus rice to the crispy tofu skin, but the standout was definitely the buns. The eyes were definitely bigger than the stomach; we struggled pretty hard to finish up the lotus rice, which was very warm and stuffed with delicious bites of pork. This place isn't going to win awards for looking did up or having the best facilities, but it's reasonably priced for dim sum (if not as super-cheap as some spots I've been to), and the food was all what one would expect from a proper Chinese brunch.", "author": "Asuka N."}

That's a pretty amazing deal, but my party of three decided to do things a la carte. They also offer yummy sounding entrees like Clay Pot Rice, which apparently takes 30 minutes to prepare, so we decided not to get it. But, if I had more time to dine, I'd definitely check that out next time. \n\nWe had (see pictures):\n\nMixed Mushroom w/ Tomago Tofu Chow Fun ($14) - Thick flour noodles served with large pieces of king mushroom and my absolute favorite kind of tofu. I've never heard it referred to as Tomago Tofu, but it is silky and eggy and braised and SO good. I really liked the flavors and concept of this dish, but it was just too oily :[. \n\nSauteed Garlic Pea Shoots ($14) - Dou miao is always delicious, especially over rice. The veggies were fresh and sufficiently garlicky. However, again, it was just too oily for my taste.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Rex Sole Fish with Greens ($14) - Sauteed white fish tossed with leeks and peapods. I liked this dish quite a bit.

I would suggest going for the siu mai (pork dumplings), radish/turnip cake, \u6d41\u6c99\u5305 (steam salted egg yolk buns) and \u714e\u5806 (deep fried sesame balls with red bean filling). We also had a teochew dumpling (cannot remember the name on the menu) and it was delightfully satisfying. Would minus half a star for the xiao long bao but then again, it was overall a very delicious, pleasant and cheap dining experience!", "author": "Soraya L."}

The shumai was over cooked, (steamed) tripe was too oily, and the Chinese bread/dough wrapped in noodle was soggy as if left out for too long. We asked the server if we could have a freshly made, crunchier one and she basically dismissed us saying it's fresh and meant to be soggy... uh, no it's not.

The minimum price for a dim sum entree is like $4.95. Granted, I didn't have to pay the bill, but nonetheless, it still shocked me that 5 people spent nearly a bill on dim sum alone. The place is not too big, so there's a bit of a wait. Luckily, we didn't have to wait too long. The service was okay. Our server wasn't the most friendliest person, but I should seriously know better than to expect servers at Chinese restaurants treating me as if I was dining at a five star restaurant. \n\nIf you're driving in, you're better off parking in the parking structures on Vallejo St.", "author": "Jackie T."}

There was no wait which was nice and my first impression of the venue was that it was clean, with lots of older chinese people (which is always a good sign, indicating potential for authentic, not Americanized Chinese food). \n\nIt was hard to communicate with the waitress because she neither spoke english or mandarin. I THINK she spoke cantonese, but unlike most cantonese people, she did not understand much of mandarin, so my friends and I had to indicate what we want by a mixture of chenglish and direct pointing on the menu.\n\nThe dishes we ordered had 1 thing in common - everything was OVERLY greasy. We ordered 1) pan-friend sole dish with green beans / mushrooms, 2)  pea sprouts with garlic, and 3) tofu / mushroom chowfun\n\nOverall, not that impressed - thank god for rice to soak up all the oil the food was swimming in!!! When the check came, I was suprised that the food was not cheap for Chinatown. Since they only accept 1 credit card or cash, we put down 1 credit card only to find out after they came back with our receipt that they accidentally swiped it twice and charged us double. After pointing this out, they revoked the initial transaction. The food came out to ~$20 per person, which was by no means cheap for Chinatown. \n\nWould I come back again? Yes purely because it's a convenient, couple blocks from my house but it's definitely not somewhere I'd take my family for quality chinese food.", "author": "Heather Y."}

They also have a large variety of vegetarian options, which is hard to find at dim sum restaurants. The mushroom noodle roll, mushroom bun, vegetable dumpling, red bean buns, all delicious. The mushroom bun was pan-fried and pretty oily, though. My favorite was definitely the mushroom noodle roll, with the red bean bun in close second. \n\nThey don't come around with the carts, you circle what you want on the menu, which I think is really fun so that was a little disappointing, but the food was tasty and much fresher. One downside, and maybe this is just because we couldn't read the menu, but they didn't have the sesame balls filled with red bean paste.  Or if they did, they told us they didn't. :(\n\nOur meal came to $11 per person, without tip. While I didn't overstuff myself like usual, I felt content after the meal.

I ordered the cow tripe, shrimp noodle roll, yellow custard buns, chinese donut noodle roll, and the pan fried shrimp and chives dumplings. The dishes were tasty and just so much better than Yank Sing. I was probably being biased after that experience but I paid just the same amount at Lai Hong Lounge as I did at Yank Sing, even a couple dollars less, and I got almost twice as much food at Lai Hong Lounge. Compared to Yank Sing, there were a BUNCH of Asian ethnicities seated at Lai Hong Lounge so you know it caters to a more authentic cuisine versus the Americanized Chinese dim sum restaurant Yank Sing.

I have to say, surprisingly, I was more impressed with the dinner than the dim sum.\n\nAt dinner, there a nice set meal deal, where for $80 for 4 people, you get a soup, a choice of either peking duck or lobster, and your choice of 4 dishes from a generous list of dishes. We opted for:\n\nSoup - the daily special soup was out, so we got the Westlake Soup. Pretty good rendition.\n\nPeking Duck - This was really really good! I liked that this was served with buns (I prefer buns over the more \"authentic\" pancakes) and the crispy skin was already detached from the duck. The duck meat itself was very flavorful and juicy. My only wish was that they had given us more sauce and spring onions to pair with the duck. But overall, stellar preparation. \n\nSea Cucumber and Duck Feet - This was the most disappointing dish of the entire dinner. The duck feet was dry and the sea cucumber tasted dry and overcooked.\n\nBBQ Platter - The platter came with five spice beef, char siu, and jellyfish. The jellyfish was very good, very tender and fresh. The char siu was also outstanding, very soft and flavorful. I liked the five spice beef as well, although it wasn't quite as exceptional as the other 2 items. \n\nMushroom and Tofu - This was very nicely executed, with lots of delicious mushrooms on top, and perfectly lightly fried tofu underneath the mushrooms. A huge hit at our table. \n\nCoffee pork ribs - This was underwhelming to me, just a standard ribs and I found the fried outer coating to be a bit too hard. \n\n----\n\nAs for dim sum, I was disappointed. Perhaps because I've been spoiled by Hong Kong but I thought a lot of the execution was lacking. I got:\n\nChiu Chow Dumpling - The dumpling was way too massive to eat, causing the fillings to often spill out. Also the skin a bit too thick. I didn't think the filling was anything special either.\n\nShrimp Rice Roll - I was very disappointed by this version. Shrimp rice rolls are one of my favorite things at dim sum, but the version here, the rice roll is not slippery smooth like others, here it was too thick and a bit chunky. \n\nDurian Pastry - I've never tried a durian pastry so I was pleasantly surprised by this. It's nicely balanced with the pungent flavor of durian with the flaky crust.\n\nBBQ Pork Bun - I know that this is popular here, but I thought this version was underwhelming. I guess it's because I've had the far superior versions in Hong Kong at Tim Ho Wan, so this pales greatly in comparison. The pork inside seems to be both too fatty and too sweet, and somehow the entire thing just doesn't quite come together the way it does at Tim Ho Wan. \n\nAlmond Egg Yolk Ball - I've never seen this before, so I had to try it. Turns out it's kind of like a sesame ball, with the sesame seeds replaced by almond flakes, married a salted egg yolk bun. I thought that there was too much of the sticky rice and it took me a long time to get to the filling (a bit unevenly distributed).\n\nAll in all, I found the dim sum very average, to say the least. \n\nSo I guess, contrary to all these other reviews, I'm recommend trying the dinner over the dim sum!", "author": "Jenny W."}

I felt like I was at a family gathering with a bunch of aunties and uncles I barely know.  I half expected one of the ladies around me to lean across to my table and ask me what college I went to, where I am working, and how much money I make. \n\nOverall the food was very good.  We had:\n\nSticky rice - moist with pork and shrimp. It could have used some Chinese sausage. Chinese sausage is included in the east coast but maybe not west coast? \n\nPan fried Chive dumplings - Pork, shrimp and Chive filling - nicely seasoned. Very good\n\nChicken congee - comes with scallions a few slices of fried dough. I love me my fried dough.  Very good congee with real pieces of bite size chopped steamed chicken - on the bone. Not shredded chicken. \n\nChinese sausage in a bun - like Asian pig in a blanket. The bun and the sausage was dry.  We love Chinese sausage but could only eat 1 out of 3.  \n\nTurnip cakes - with pork bits. Moist and flavorful \n\nSnow pea sprouts - very good. But it's hard to ruin this dish\n\nShrimp rice rolls - excellent. Big juicy shrimp \n\nPuff pastry with roast pork - weird and greasy. It was like taking the crust from egg tart and putting in roast pork. It was a wierd combo of sweet, savory, and greasy. \n\nPan fried bean curd rolls - stuffed with oil and shrimp. Very yummy. Crispy outside and flavorful inside.  \n\nThey charge for tea - but it was good jasmine tea. \n\nLadies room was scary.", "author": "A C."}

Given that I'd kind of just picked Lai Hong on a whim and chosen to completely disregard the health score advisory (ignorance is bliss, even when feigned), I wasn't all too sure what to expect. The tl;dr summary: mad dec dim sum sans carts.\n\nI personally love the thrill of steam cart dim sum. There's a certain strategic element to it that requires commanding eye contact and superior posturing to really let the servers know that you mean business. It brings out the best (and worst) in my competitive streak. But I also get the lax appeal of just marking up a sheet and ordering from the comfort of your seat, which is exactly how Lai Hong works. The mark of a great non-cart dim sum restaurant is a steely, mechanical system, and this place has it down pat. Once you're seated (which is half the battle considering the standard half hour wait), all you need to do is parse through the menu, mark what you want and wait patiently for your feast to come to you. The staff is so much more organized than other spots in the area, and they cross off the orders on your receipt as they drop them off, which lets you and them both keep track of what has and hasn't been squared away. No wandering carts to fulfill any spur of the moment hunger pangs, so make sure you map out your plan of attack in the first order to save yourself another round of waiting.\n\nThe actual food quality, for me, varied from pretty damn good to top notch. The staples -- siu mai, har gow, pork buns -- were all great. All things salt-and-pepper, calamari and fish especially, offered up salty fried deliciousness; not to be missed! The yangzhou fried rice really hit the spot. I was hoping for lapcheong instead of char siu in the mix, BUT the extra saltiness was a fair trade off. Love the beef chow fun. Always a sinfully greasy order, and the leftovers made for a fantastic drunk snack later that night. The only thing that I didn't love were the steamed chive dumplings, but if someone were to offer them to me again, I sure as hell wouldn't say no. Since everything is made to order, everything comes out piping hot, on top of already being pretty frickin' tasty. Guaranteed one way ticket to a happy afternoon food coma.\n\nAs with any dim sum place, either know your shit or bring someone who does. The menu here is pretty sprawling, so it's easy to get lost in the sea of tiny text, especially without the benefit of being able to eye the food as it rolls past you. Also be warned that it can be a challenge to flag down a waiter. Sneaking in another order may take a pretty long while, and waiting for a refill can be a real bitch. Dim sum isn't about stellar service, though: it's all about gratuitous quantities of good food. On that front, Lai Hong is more than successful. I'll most definitely be back ASAP... with a bigger appetite and stretchier pants.", "author": "Rei R."}

The wait is ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT at Lai Hong Lounge because the people working there will give tables to their friends without ticket or waiting time, no matter others waited for an hour already. When we asked the host why the available tables gave others with later #, the waitress just bullshit & the waiter made an eye signal to the friend to get the available table. The host requests all people must be there to get a table, but they allow their friends to occupy 2  big tables (seats 8 -10 people each) with only 1 &  3 persons seating there  respectively for  at  least 15 minutes. Their  numbering system is unbearable & frustrating, whenever a table is available, the host calls out numbers so quickly on purpose that most parties don't have time to react before, then the tables will be given away.

I find most dim sum to be heavy, starchy, greasy and not even that flavorful. A mutual friend of ours calls it a perpetual disappointment, and I'm usually inclined to agree.\n\nSince we can't get any sort of dim sum in our hometown, a trip to SF Chinatown was a great opportunity for DLW to get a fix. We looked at lots of Yelp reviews and checked out a few places. Most are either little holes in the wall with grungy atmosphere, or big black boxes where the food is not highly rated. This place was an exception, a real sit-down restaurant that also gets good reviews. We went on a Sunday afternoon and fortunately only had a 20 minute wait for a table. Some have noted an hour or longer waits at peak, so we felt happy going in.\n\nThe interior is nice but generic Chinese. At least half the customers were Chinese. Waitstaff is all Chinese, some of whom have only a little English. The receipt showing your order for the food runners is printed entirely in Chinese. These are all good signs that your dim sum will be authentic and good.\n\nYou order from a laminated card, and everything comes straight from the kitchen, no steam carts, which is one thing I dislike about most dim sum. Too often steaming turns the food into mushy glop. Fried items especially must be served as soon as they are ready, or they suffer in quality. When the kitchen cooks items to order, the food is so much better.\n\nSoup dumplings are an easy call on dim sum menus, and these were good, but they weren't served with spoons, forcing us to eat them in one bite with chopsticks, which is not ideal. Shrimp in rice noodle wrap had that combination of textures and flavors that Chinese value so much. Pork buns had nuts in them, which we both liked. Salt and pepper tofu was an item neither of us had ever seen, but I love salt and pepper squid, so we tried it, and wow! Vegetation to cut down on the richness was provided by taro cakes and Chinese broccoli.\n\nIt was more expensive than those little places, but the experience was worth it to us.

The wait is ok if you're lucky, but today on a friday at 11:30 am after xmas, we waited 1.5 hours for four people.  Although not a large restaurant, it's also not a hole in the wall. Even though its Chinatown, there are 2 parking garages around the corner. \n\nMy favs: durian puffs...flakey and buttery with good amount of durian, tofu stuffed tomago (basically stuffed tofu with egg and shrimp paste, light and fluffy), and salted egg yolk steamed buns (sweet and salty center that's a little runny), try it. Also really good here are xao long bao (shanghai dumplings) right amount of porkiness with broth intact on the inside.  Also I recommend stuffed mushrooms with shrimp paste. Earthy, salty, and yet light at the same time with right amount of sauce. \n\nThe shrimp dumplings were plump with just the right amount of garlic. The eggrolls were decent, hot and crispy with sweet and sour sauce. Steamed beef rice noodle rolls were not not my fav here because beef wasn't tenderized correctly and texture became grissly. Hoping this is a one time offense.  Steamed beef balls are good and they tenderized these correctly.  The salt and pepper deep fried tofu is different here in that they formed seasoned soft tofu into ovals, battered, and deep fried them with salt and pepper outside. Different, but I like it.

There are some other dim sum places in SF (ahem, HK Lounge II) and South Bay where the wait would be twice that at noon. \n\nPretty good venue for people who want to venture out and try dim sum, but don't know the names of all the dishes. They give you a bilingual menu (in English and Chinese) on which you directly mark off the dim sum dishes you want. The menu also includes full sized dishes like fried rice and plates of vegetables. \n\nI was impressed that all the wait staff that served us were able to communicate in English, albeit broken English, but still operational. They were very efficient with refilling our tea and dealing with a slight change in our order. There was a bit of hand waving to get their attention at times, but not as bad as I've experienced elsewhere.\n\nThe highlight dim sum was definitely the BAKED BBQ PORK BUNS.\n\nLai Hong still doesn't beat Koi Palace down in Daly City, but it's a decent choice if you're looking to stay in SF or Downtown/Chinatown area.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Boy was I wrong.\nThe outside decor is pretty unflattering.  Perhaps that was probably why I really didn't expect much from the food.  When we tasted the food though...wow!  I figured this place was pretty legit given the number of locals we saw while we were waiting for our table.  On a weekday, we had about a 15-20 minute wait during lunch time for a table for 3.  Not too bad.  Back in socal, it probably would have been between a 25-30 minute wait at any of the local good dim sum places.\nThe har gow, shu mai, egg tarts, etc were all so delicious.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Too bad they're not local to me.

Because the pork buns here not only have a delicious, meaty center that is to die for, but also have a pineapple bun top (sweet and sugary) that makes each bite so satisfying you'll be calling out expletives. \n\nTo be honest I don't even care that much about the other dishes here, though I do want to give a shoutout to the delicious glutinous rice dumpling (zhong zi) that is well stuffed with assorted meats.

My first sit down dim sum experience was pretty disappointing, but luckily, I found Lai Hong!\n\nFood:\n\n-CHANG FEN: These were hands down the best I've ever had! The rice noodle tasted like they were handmade - firm and not mushy like most others I've had. They also put cilantro in their beef filling which I really appreciate. \n-Steamed BBQ pork bun: I've only recently started ordering this since I didn't used to be a huge fan of them. These also tasted like they were homemade and not straight from a frozen bag. Kudos for that.\n-Coconut red bean pudding: I'm a sucker for sweets, especially when I eat dim sum. Coconut red bean pudding isn't a staple dim sum dish that everyone offers so points added just for having it on the menu. More points added for its deliciousness. I love red bean and coconut separately and even more together.\n-Chicken feet: unfortunately, points deducted. I've had wayyy better chicken feet elsewhere. It's a shame since this is a pretty uniquely dim sum dish. \n-Shrimp dumplings and shui mai: both pretty fair. My boyfriend and I still have yet to find better shrimp dumplings than the ones at Delicious Dim Sum. Those are legit.\n\nService:\n\n-Expect to a line, especially on the weekends. Luckily, we were told that our wait would be 30 minutes and we only waited 15.\n-The food takes forever and a day to come out. I was getting pretty grumpy.\n\nTea:\n\n-The chrysanthemum tea sucks. They put like 2 flowers in the entire pot. I really should take off another star just for that, but dat chang fen and coconut red bean pudding doe. \n\nOverall, I can't say I was absolutely blown away by this place, but I'd definitely come here again if I wanted to go up to Chinatown for dim sum.", "author": "Betty W."}

Don't waste your time on XLB here; they seemed oversteamed and the bottoms will break more easily. I think they have a few items that are not always seen on other dim sum places' menus. Possibly the best item was the baked pork buns with the crumbly cookie top. Sort of like a lightly baked bolobao but white colored, with a light crispy almost fried bottom since they must use more oil to keep it from sticking to the pan (they don't appear to use paper or foil).

Since he moved over from China and has quite pretty good taste in food, I trusted him to choose a good dim sum place. After an almost 2 hour long wait, we got to eat a very satisfying dim sum lunch! I reviewed the following items:\n\nFried Radish Cake \n--This was probably the best radish dish I have ever had for dim sum. The radish cakes were cut into small cubes that had a thin fried outside layer. Eaten with the soy sauce (and some chili sauce), the radish cake was too good! \n\nFried Taro Cake\n--I didn't like how they cut up the taro pieces into little sticks and then fried it like a big taro pancake. The dish overall didn't have much taro flavor and I basically tasted just the fried batter. \n\nPork Ribs with Black Beans\n--This was made quite well. The meat was flavorful and I have always been a fan of this dish at dim sum restaurants. Yay it didn't disappoint!\n\nRice Noodle with Pork and Mushroom\n--Instead of dipping this into the sauce provided for this dish, I dipped it into the soy sauce and chili sauce I made, because it is a bit bland. However, I enjoyed the contrast of texture of the fried second outer layer (similar to the Chinese donuts) and the soft rice noodle outermost layer. \n\nFried Potstickers\n--These were your typical potstickers. The filling was a bit plain though. \n\nLeafed Sticky Rice\n--The sticky rice was very chewy and the right amount of stickiness. The filling was pretty yummy. What I liked about this dish was that the rice and filling tasted fresh. At other dim sum places, they sometimes just premake, freeze, and reheat them to serve to customers. But at this place, I don't think so! \n\nEgg Yolk Steamed Bun\n--The bun part was fluffy and soft. The filling wasn't too overwhelmingly egg yolk flavored and was sweetened nicely.", "author": "Katelyn P."}

I think I prefer City View in the Financial District, both for the majority of dim sum items and ambiance. \n\nWhat was special here: \n-Beef meatball (\u5c71\u7af9\u725b\u8089\u7403). Definitely not something I would order myself, but a friend ordered it and I was surprisingly pleased. In the meatball, there was something that provided a nice crunch...I think it was the purple mangosteen. Not sure I've had it as a fruit. Meatballs were not too salty either, and complimented well with spicy mustard and soy sauce. \n-Fish w/chives in noodle roll (\u97ed\u7687\u9b5a\u7247\u8178\u7c89). Not my favorite, but definitely unique. I've never had fish in my noodle rolls before, but the rest of the party really liked it. I didn't like how soft the roll was, as it separated and broke apart easily. \n-Pork shu mai (\u8354\u9999\u71d2\u8ce3). Good, and I was pleased. End of story.\n-Baked pork buns (\u7117\u53c9\u71d2\u98e7\u98fd). Definitely not something I would even know to order myself. Usually, I stick to the basics during dim sum. This was not within my normal scope of taste buds, but something I could enjoy. The baked buns were very soft to bite into and fresh, and the sweet and savory mix of the pork and sauce inside was very unique. \n\nWhat I didn't like: \n-XLB/soup dumplings (\u5c0f\u7c60\u5305). The dumpling part was too thick, and the semi-metal container it came in seemed more for baking miniature cupcakes than to hold XLB. My soup definitely spilled out before I got to consume it. \n-Awkward seating. Our party of three were seated in a corner adjacent to the restroom, and random landline phone, and the kitchen. This meant lots of foot traffic and the random landline ringing multiple times throughout lunch. Not the most preferred ambiance. \n\nIn sum, I think the above items are special and definitely worth a try.

The corresponding photo only shows about 2/3 of the food we ordered and received.\n\nHighlights: coconut and red bean cake, egg tart (dan tat), custard and egg yolk bun, lotus-leaf-wrapped sticky rice, chicken feet, pork spareribs, potstickers\n\nMediocre: assorted dumplings, steamed pork buns (they were pretty salty and didn't have the sweetness of regular BBQ), Chinese donut wrapped with rice noodle (too salty)\n\nPass: beef spareribs\n\nGrand total for all the food?  $140.\n\nBottom line: good prices, good food (for the most part), not as crowded as Great Eastern, food coma.", "author": "Tori S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-18", "description": "I usually never try to give restaurants a 1-star review, but honestly, I would give this place 0 stars if I could after my experience today. Sadly, I think it will be the last time I ever visit Lai Hong Lounge after having gone quite a few times before. \n\nThe biggest reason for my low rating is service. I know that the service here has never been spectacular, but we got to the restaurant at around 10:40am today and was told the wait would be about 20 minutes for a party of 2. Needless to say, we waited an hour. Now, I'm usually pretty understanding if the wait goes 10, even 15, minutes over what was told because I understand that restaurants can't always control the pace at which customers stay at their tables. But if you've been in business for a while now, you should know at this point how to estimate your time better and not give me an unrealistic wait time. The fact that I was given a 20 minutes wait time, and afterwards given another 20 minute wait time, and STILL got seated way past both wait times given was really frustrating and unprofessional on their end. Even with the ridiculous wait estimate, there was no apologies, sympathy, or anything to make up for the fact that they messed up BIG time on their wait estimate. RUDE. \n\nSecondly, I honestly feel that their quality has gone downhill since the last few times I've been here. Maybe it was because it was Sunday morning and really busy, but all the steamed dimsum seemed over-steamed, with water dripping everywhere and dumpling skins ripping apart before I can even get it on my plate. Even the baked bbq pork bun was white, when it should be golden brown and that just requires the kitchen staff to leave it under the oven a little longer, which I believe is really minimal but a necessary detail to see. \n\nTheir only saving grace is the fact that they're one of the few dimsum restaurants that have the egg yolk custard bun. But, I think I'd rather make the trip further to inner Richmond for Hong Kong Lounge II, where the quality is better and service is much more professional for the same exact price range. \n\nBye, Lai Hong Lounge, see you never.", "author": "Judy B."}

The first time I came was on a weekday which was early in the morning at around 10AM which I thought was a good idea to get a table first being the first one to find parking in Chinatown. Well I walked into a nearly empty restaurant and asked the manager for a table for five, which led to him giving me attitude saying that if my full party if not present then I cannot get a table so a few minutes later my aunt came in which he still refused since it's less than half the party. Luckily my aunt works in the restaurant business and decided to give a call to the owner Mr. So which he was in the restaurant at the time helped resolve the problem and apologized for his employees behavior. \n\nSo after a long fuss we finally got our table with our party of 5 and got the usual spare ribs, siu mai, har gow, xiao long bao, beef balls, beef and shrimp rice rolls, and the clay pot beef and tendon noodle. I would recommend the \"dan san\" which is fried egg with a bit of sweetness. Overall the food was very good but was a little bit on the pricier side comparing to other restaurants in the Chinatown so they get two stars for that. \n\n2nd Visit:\nBut as I decided to make another visit for dinner, they just lost me as a customer after my last experience. Came in a little past 7:30PM with my parents and was not even greeted by anyone this time where the waitstaff decided to just stand around in the middle of the restaurant doing nothing. So we decided to seat ourselves. Then a waiter decides to walks over and decides to yell at us in Chinese for coming in that they are closing soon which by the fact they actually close at 8:30PM. I saw it as an excuse to tell us to leave probably because the workers wanted to get off work early and did not want to deal waiting another table. Sorry Lai Hong Lounge, but you just lost a customer for being unprofessional and rude, I just really feel uncomfortable eating here. I really hope the owner decides to train his employees to be more professional when it comes to customer service. I work in the service sector too and the way the employees behave to customers are way beyond unacceptable. I would just stick with Hong Kong Lounge I & II in the Richmond and I might give them another try later on and hopefully they improve.", "author": "Peter C."}

This works well if you want to see what the possibilities are but can be dangerous if you are hungry and over order. \n\nTurnip cake - the best turnip cake I ever had. I'm not sure what it was... maybe it was fresh? Every bite was pure happiness. \n\nSiu Mai - actually wasn't that great to me. It may have been overcooked but it tasted pretty bland\n\nHa Cow - very good. Be careful when picking it up, it can break apart really easily.\n\nShrimp Noodle Roll - or how i would call it \"shrimps in a blanket\" and \"best stuff ever\" was really really good. \n\nCoconut Red Bean Cake - we got this as a dessert after seeing some yelp images and it lives up to the hype. Very refreshing without feeling heavy. \n\nI'm not an expert of dim sum so I am not sure if I will ever give 5 stars for a place but I can definitely say that this place is really good. It pretty much beats most places in SD hands down. If I were to come back though.. it would definitely be the turnip cake.", "author": "Alan T."}

There wasn't a wait, which was nice, but the people kept coming in after we sat down.  \n\nWe got a lot of food for two people, including shrimp dumplings, sui mai, almond sticky rice balls with salted egg yolk, stuffed eggplant, shrimp rice crepe, steamed Malaysian sponge cake, chicken feet, pan fried turnip cake, pan fried chive dumplings, and steamed red bean bun with walnut.  Everything met my standards, with the minor exception that the shrimp dumplings seemed to contain an odd amount of water inside, which I haven't experienced before - perhaps they were oversteamed or the shrimp weren't particularly fresh?  The steamed red bean buns I likely would not order again - although they each contained a walnut inside, I didn't find the buns that great (of note that the red bean paste they likely make in house because it didn't taste very sweet).  \n\nThe siu mai, stuffed eggplant, and shrimp rice crepe - just like at its sister institution - were delicious and I'd definitely order them all again.\n\nService:  Decent for a Chinese restaurant.  You don't have to flag people down and they're diligent about making sure your tea pot is refilled.\n\nBottom line:  Come here for dim sum in Chinatown - finally there's a decently authentic and well-priced option.", "author": "Denny C."}

Normally I tip from 15+% depending on the service. But the service was poor. When we asked them to refill our tea pot they ignored our request. Most of their servers avoided eye contact and when we did make eye contact and we gestured for them they looked away and continued to chat with their co-worker. \n\nDespite all of this I still left about a 9% tip. When we left one of the server ran out into the street tell us that we needed to pay a minimum 10% gratuity, restaurant policy.

Ordered the usual dimsum dishes of shiu mai, chicken feet, steam pork buns, etc. The wait for the food was actually a lot longer than what I have experienced in HK lounge so at least you know its fresh but it seriously took forever.

Because it's not located in the \"touristy\" center of Chinatown is why this place is a hidden gem. How can you tell? Well, two ways. 1) Almost all the customers speak Cantonese and/or Mandarin and 2) there is a LONG line... I went around lunchtime and waited an hour before I finally got a spot.\n\nThe portion sizes are HUGE, so definitely only order 0.75x of what you were originally planning to order. You will have leftovers. \n\nEvery dish is delicious! I really liked their porridge, buns and scallion pancake. Stay away from the chicken's feet. It's boiled rather than seasoned with sweetness-- frankly I thought the texture without the dough layer was strange, but if this is your thing, then by all means order it. \n\nService was fast-- you sit down, look at a menu and order from the menu. Waiters bring the food to you as they would in a restaurant.

Most of them in the area are old style and lack the quality and taste that most of us hipsters are looking for. I know I don't always want to be served by old ladies pushing carts with a hearing complex. \n\nFood. It's good if unremarkable. Doesn't really stand out but also doesn't disappoint. Their baked BBQ buns are somewhat unique, has a crusty top reminiscent of a pineapple bun but not. Recommend that, but some of their other dishes fall a bit short sometimes. For the most part is good to very good. \n\nService. Very hit or miss. Was quick with our water/tea refills but was slow with our dim sum on several occasions. Took 45 minutes to an hour to get our Sui Mai and Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf....and never apologized for the wait. Also waiter was a bit argumentative when we asked for something on the menu, and she insisted it wasn't there.....only to come back 10 minutes later and say that it was. Okay...so we order it and they made it wrong, missing the preserved vegetables that were part of the order...but we already left so this was annoying...paid for an order that wasn't complete. \n\nAlso, make sure when marking down dim sum, do not make a mistake. Once they bring it to you, you're stuck with it; they refuse to take anything back. This is compounded by the price; this is not a cheap dim sum place. There are plenty of those in Chinatown but if you go here be prepared to pay above what most charge in the area for dim sum. \n\nNot worth a special trip but if you're in the area, worth a lunch visit.", "author": "Alfred D."}

Of course expecting a wait and long lines, you must think this place is good. Truth be...its tolerable. By looking at their menu, it caters to tourists and ABCs (American born Chinese). List of fried food and lesser native/traditional dishes. You also have to order through a sheet rather than waiters carrying food and announcing it to people. \n\nDishes are quite expensive especially on the edge of Chinatown SF. The price of a plate of pea sprout veggies ($8.50) is half the quantity you can get at dinner for a $1.50 more at another restaurant. Flavor was good. But knowing I cant eat something for steal of a price is unsettling. Tofu was $6 for 6 pieces, overly salted and didn't look like the chef had enough experience to make tofu silky instead of lumpy. \n\nThe manager is a young male, 30s maybe and lack of experience. He directs waiters to break down and set up tables to fit the proceeding waiting party, and strike it down again when the number of people have changed. Within that hour, I saw 4 tables strike down. \n\nPoints for not charging for tea, as it should be when you order over $30 worth of food. Drinks (tea and water) SHOULD be complementary. But the fault is...their tea was never hot enough where I flinch when I touch my tea cup. \n\nThe quality of food is ok. Hit or miss based on what you ordered...as if I'll come back again?

I am all for tipping a handsome amount for exceptional service, but I found them to be a bit ridiculous. Here's an example of just how ridiculous they are:\n\nOur bill came out to be $33.30 (tax included). The person who paid for it went to the restroom after he left the tip and the waiter came to collect it while we were still at the table. After walking a few steps, he immediately checked the tipped and darted back to our table at the speed of light to ask for more. Thinking the friend had undertipped, we pulled out our wallets and opened the check holder. $3.20. It's not the most generous tip, but it most certainly is at least 10% pretax (not to mention only 13 cents away from the posttax amount). As the waiter stood there waiting for us to tip, I stared at him in disbelief. He had no qualms staring back and waiting for his \"entitled\" tip. I personally think tip should be earned.

Hong Kong Lounge steams up really good siu mai.  Lai Hong has good ones too.  No matter how you spell it, shu mai, siu mai, or just want to call it pork dumplings, you can't go wrong with them here.  (I have a feeling I have written that last sentence in another review)  If you didn't know already, yes, a touch of chili oil makes a siu mai 100% better.\n\n*Pan fried taro cakes - Unlike the thicker ones you'd usually see, they offer thinly layered taro cakes that are pan fried.  These come out in a form reminiscent of a green onion pancake armored with a crispy texture.  This will have anyone licking their chops for more (or licking the glistening grease from it).  I don't think they have this in HK Lounge, but I could be wrong.\n\n*Chinese tamale, \"zongzi\" or \"ZONG!\" - Yes, Chinese tamale, share it.  I doubt anyone can finish this $8 behemoth alone.  This is a special item order.  Inside the tamale is packed full of all kinds of ingredients from mung bean, Chinese sausage, and of course, that good o' slab of fat for extra flavor.  Like any Chinese tamale, it's wrapped in leaves, Lai Hong's version are made for Yao Ming sized.  It is prepared like the one at Hong Kong Lounge.  So if you tried it there, similarities between the two are fairly noticeable.        \n   \nAs The Dark Knight Rises is arguably the second best movie in Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, Lai Hong is also the distant second to Hong Kong Lounge.  Quality levels are shades apart from HK Lounge.  As a standalone unbiased restaurant, they shovel out good dim sum.  While it has just opened not too long ago, they bring a strong competitor to the SF Chinatown options for dim sum.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Otherwise the wait time is over an hour. Ok, on with the food.\n\nI will say that the majority of the food I have had here are 5 stars but I have also had some that totally bombed out.

They are not your normal baked pork buns, I know they have another name but I don't know what it is.

When i got the news that there's going to be a new dim sum place, I must check it out. \n\nDecor:\nThey definitely \"updated\" the place a bit. Painted the walls, some new paintings on the wall, fixed up the entrance to the kitchen, got rid of the fish tanks, and looks like they installed some new lights. However, besides that, it looks pretty much the same-- even the chairs/tables look like the ones from before. \n\nFood:\nI came here for dim sum so I'm commenting on the dim sum. They have one piece of paper only. No more trays/carts where you can point at what you want. They also don't have the typical small/medium/large dishes. The prices are listed next to the dish. Definitely a little bit more expensive than other places in ctown, but quality wasn't too bad, but it took FOREVER for the food to come. We also ordered a noodle dish. Usually the noodles would come last, but not today! We finished the entire noodle dish before our first order of dim sum came. Kind of dissapointed. \n\nService:\nNot good. First of all, instead of allowing you to wait inside, you have to wait outside. I understand why they did it-- it definitely did not disturb your dining experience and kept the restaurant quiet, but if there is a long line, be ready to wait for an hour in the COLD. You know how it gets in san francisco, those wind can send shivers down your spine, now imagine waiting in the rain? Oh boy. Next, they placed a podium on the stairs to take care of the seating. She wasn't friendly, thats probably because she was cold and many people kept asking her when their turn was. Here is another bad thing-- she would call your number and you'd still have to wait outside for 5 minutes. Why not call you when someone is ready to seat you? When we got called for table for 4, she asked if we want to sit in a table for 2. Why even ask when you know we wouldn't fit? That was a stupid question.\n\nOverall, I've tried it, and it's only meh.

The server demanded more...\"AT LEAST 10% TIP,\" so we asked her if there was proof of this in fine print somewhere. She said no and proceeded to explain that San Francisco is an expensive city to be in and continued to demand for at least 10% tip.

Nice system where you get your item and they stamp what you've eaten. Not to be a snob, but I didn't find it very appealing that the same food on carts drift by until they are ordered. Makes me wonder how long it takes for people to get the non preferred item. Price for the food is decent and good and for two people, you get a sufficient amount of food for a great price. \n     Food was good but nothing really stood out. Kinda felt a bit overwhelmed.

The hostess quoted us for a 45-minute wait and it took exactly that long to get us seated. You would assume that they would push their dim sum carts around the restaurant since you're in China Town and it should be authentic, right? No, I was wrong. We put our order in for about 6 items and after about 15 minutes, the first item arrived. 10 minutes later, another dish arrived. It took about 45 minutes for our last dish to come out. A few minutes prior to that, I had my bf go up to the front counter and cancel the last item because we did not want to wait anymore. The lady in the front said that it was fine but another lady rushed the sticky rice out and made us take it. Her excuse was that it was already made.. OK? How about you take it back and use it for another table's order? My bf insisted on just boxing it up and taking it home. I listened because I knew that if I argued my way with the server, I'd be in a bad mood and that was the last thing I wanted for myself. I'm giving a few stars because the food was actually good but the service and wait was unpleasant. Also, what is the deal with handing us our receipts in Chinese? I couldn't even read what they charged us for. At the top of our receipt was a charge of $2.50x2 and I'm wondering if it was for hot tea because we did not order any. We also did not order 2 of anything. So, either they charged us tea for two or they charged us $5 to dine in.. I didn't even ask the staff because I was over it and wanted to leave at this point. Go elsewhere unless you have the time and patience to wait forever for your food served by rude staff members.", "author": "Angel N."}

And so were the pepper fried Chicken Wings! It's not black pepper like I thought it would be. I forgot, CHINA RULES. LOL pepper on a menu in China means actual chili peppers lmao not black pepper like we use for everything here in the states XD. So the wings were toped with fried garlic, tiny diced red chilies, and scallions. SO, SO good! We also loved our meatballs and potstickers. The only downside (and the reason I always want to go for dim sum) were their xlb (Shanghai Soup Dumpling). Do not misunderstand, they were GOOD. But they were not GREAT. I have been lucky enough to have been spoiled with the most epic Xiao Long Bao known to man (OK, known to me lmao) but they were earth shattering. These were just good. I did love how they put their xlb in tiny cupcake-cups to save your juices from leaking out. That was AWESOME. \nSeeing your soup leak out of your delicious dumpling before you can eat it, is equivalent to taking one bite of an amazing piece of pie, and then having it fall unto the dirty floor. Simply tragic. So good call Lai Hong, I approve.", "author": "Awesomeness S."}

Not too difficult to make after all.\n\nGarlic Veges - Typical, nothing outstanding.\n\nMayo Prawns - Decent, had a nice texture and wasn't too mayo-ey.

No joke. \n\nMy Dad was visiting from out of town and I was anxious to find a good dim sum place for him to try. He's that, \"Not a lot of food can impress me\" kind of guy so I knew I had to get this right. There's a lot of dim sum places in Chinatown, but they're really just the greasy dim sum to-go that is going to make you feel bloated and gross (totally not what we were going for). I did a lot of searching but once I found out that this place was the sister restaurant to HK Lounge, I knew that this was it. \n\nWe arrived not too long after 10AM and we got seated pretty quickly. It was still pretty empty in the morning but people were steadily filling up the seats (duly noted: come early because this place gets PACKED). Similar to HK Lounge, you gotta write your order on a sheet and then flag down the waiter to have it picked up. We ordered their: baked pork buns, crispy pan fried taro, sweet tofu soup, egg tarts, and a fish/chives noodle roll. It doesn't seem like a lot but it really really is. First, what is awesome about these dishes is that it's NOT greasy. Second, are the portions! This place is admittedly a little more expensive than others, but you really get what you pay for. The sweet tofu soup came in a MASSIVE bowl, the buns were huge, and our taro was seriously enough to feed a table of 4. My Dad, who is usually finding something to criticize, thought this place was goooood. I should've learned my lesson after having been to HK Lounge but at least I got some good leftovers. YUM!\n\nTotally excited about this place and can't wait to take my other friends and family here if they come to visit!

We knocked a couple dollars off the tip b/c of the poor service (10 minute wait to serve tea/take our prefilled dim sum slip - which we've had AN HOUR to work on out on the sidewalk before being seated, no smile, no refills), and the waitress literally followed us out of the restaurant, onto the sidewalk, demanding $2 more.

On the other hand, I dock for terrible service. Next.\n\nFinal complaint: Why are Chinese people so penny wise but pound foolish? (I'm Chinese, so I can say this, haha.)

It is good for family meals because there are hardly any waits and you will never feel rushed through your meal so at least the dining environment is mellow and comfortable. The food is very hit or miss, and by hit I do not mean spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-08", "description": "Lai Hong Lounge is the reincarnation of the old Lichee Garden that's been around for many years. Unfortunately, over time Lichee Garden's business began to dwindle especially after they stopped serving dim sum. The owners sold it,  the restaurant has been remodeled, and reborn as Lai Hong Lounge.\n\nMy parents and I live across the street from this place and saw the \"Grand Opening\" flower pots outside and the new name and saw they were once again serving dim sum! So we decided to try it out for lunch on its opening day. The inside was packed and redesigned from the old, outdated Lichee Garden. Instead of having old ladies push around clanking trays filled with dim sum, they hand you a menu listing all of their dim sum options and prices. You put down the quantity of the items you want, hand it to a server, and wait. The orders come out fairly quickly and the server told us that most items are made fresh. This method of dim sum has its pros and cons, I believe. The pros are that your items come out piping hot instead of being lukewarm from sitting stagnant in a cart. Also, you can request any item you want instead of waiting for it to come to you. The downside is that it takes the fun out of going to dimsum. You don't get the same experience as visually looking at the food and pointing to what you want.\n\nAll of the things we ordered were really delicious. They did indeed come out piping hot and in a timely manner. They are also priced very reasonably, too. \n\nThe one thing that did turn me off was that there is no waiting area. So if the restaurant gets packed (and it should) and there are no tables open, you'll be stuck waiting outside in the cold San Francisco breeze. The hostess has a podium set up outside on the stairs and hands out numbers from there. I've heard her tell patrons who wanted to wait inside away from the cold that they are not allowed to. After a few more minutes, they left visibly upset. Hopefully management will find a better alternative for waiting. \n\nOverall, this is probably one of the best dim sum places in Chinatown. They are also the most modern, as they use digital POS systems to print out your bill. Definitely worth a try!", "author": "Steven L."}

Okay, NOT everything: the restrooms are the same dingy yeechy restrooms as before. The restaurant appears so clean and new, as compared with what one remembers of the previous restaurant! New paint, carpeting and even lights give this place new life, and the dim sum has people returning! The place was completely completely crowded and just 3-4 small tables available. Service was very quick, when I consider the mass of people sitting and dining. WOW!! what a change from the old place! When I saw Salted & Peppered Calamari on the menu I had to try that and it was delicious as I expected! I also thought - now with a few years with Chinatown BIG dim dum restaurants under my belt - that their prices were very reasonable and not as expensive at other places. The rice soup was very hot and tasty and filling! No passing carts which ensures your items are fresh when delivered, instead of how many hours has that item been sitting on the wheeled cart pushed around like in other big dim sum restaurants?

We were looking to have dim sum in SF's Chinatown because we were in town from LA and how could we not? We headed there when we thought they were just opening and faced a huge crowd and long wait because they opened early for the holiday. Go figure. Lots of immigrant Chinese and their lack of patience and courtesy. Everyone talking to the hostess at once. However she spotted my husband and I waiting patiently and made sure to hand us a wait stub despite all the people all up in her grill. Food did not disappoint. I think I went overboard cause I think I ordered like 7 or 9 dishes between the two of us! o.o haha piggy. Anyways we had leftovers for our drive from SF to Monterey Bay. We had shrimp rolls, chicken's feet, chicken wings, har gow, shu mai, egg custard buns, and tripe. The egg custard was really different from any I've had in LA because the filling was runny instead of squishy. Weird texture but still delicious. The tripe was tasty but really big pieces and served with a sweet soy sauce instead of the smaller pieces in a spiced sauce I'm used to in LA. Still good but I would have appreciated smaller pieces because they were slipping from the chopsticks due to their weight. I would eat here again if in town, for sure!", "author": "Rose C."}
