The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor is actually still inside the shopping center so there is a cover and you can bring your pets.\n\n\nThe menu offers a wide variety of ramen, rice dishes and other noodle dishes.  I ordered the combination which included the hot udon noodle and a small bowl of chicken curry donburi.   The soup broth of the udon is probably one of the best I ever had in the city.   Great for a cold San Francisco day or when you are trying to recover from a cold.....so tasty.

The wait wasn't too bad at around 10-15 minutes upon putting our name down. \n\nThe quantity is prime here. I ordered the Kanakui. That fat bowl of ramen could have filled me up for two meals because I had difficulty eating it 1/3rd of the way through. The broth comes out piping hot so be careful. Not a huge fan of the noodles since it gives off a very instant noodle taste to it. The broth was mediocre and I did not really like the pork belly. Another thing that peeved me was that all of our eggs were hard boiled. Usually, ramen places serve their ramen with a soft boiled egg. This egg looked like it's been cooked three times over. \n\nOverall if you're looking to get full, this is the place. Otherwise, come earlier for the better ramen upstairs.", "author": "Elvis N."}

Without a variety of options, including where we wanted to dine (Marafuku), we came to Suzu despite the \"warning\" on the front of the Yelp listing. (I'd never seen that before.)\n\nAfter a brief wait, we were seated at an outside-of-the restaurant table.   Service was pretty fast and after a quick decision, we ordered straightforward items - Karaage, Hayashi Chuka, Gyoza and Shoyu Ramen. \n\nThe karaage (fried chicken) was pretty good though I prefer a bit more crispy cooked.  It is dark meat so it already has a pinkish hue but the flavor and texture made me at least wonder if it was still raw.  Overall, we ate it and were fine. :)     Gyoza were perfectly cooked and the accompanying sauce was tasty.\n\nI only had a little bit but what I ate of the ramen, I was pleased!  The very generous serving wasn't overly salty, was full of veggies and chicken, and had enough flavor to standalone.  I scored everyone's veggie fritters too.  Those were a fun addition and reminiscent of a memorable lunch in Japan.   \n\nHayashi Chuka is a traditional summer salad in Japan that I've ordered, and made, countless times.  Like a lot of salads, the dressing has to pull it all together and this definitely fell short.  It was a let down.  Sorry.\n\nSo, we came here by default. Some hits, some misses.

Ordered the Spicy Ramen with combo option and selected the Karaage. Karaage was good portion but not as crispy as most places I've eaten it at. Maybe because these pieces were bigger chunks. Spicy Ramen broth with miso flavor was spicy but not too spicy. It's at about the spiciness level that I can comfortably handle. I'm not sure if I liked the broth. Rather than a refreshing feeling while eating it, I felt like it was a little heavy handed on the flavoring. It felt thick but not physically if you get what I mean. Anyway, it had me feeling that I should have chosen shoyu flavor instead but that prolly would've make it taste too salty. \n\nBiting into the dish and sipping on the broth some more, I began to appreciate the flavor and texture of the broth. It balanced out the strong and succulent pickled bamboo flavor and evened out the sweetness of the pork. The bok choy was a nice touch of flavor that didn't over compete with the other ingredients because there were only two pieces (just enough). I love bean sprouts but only if they're cooked, so once my ramen arrived I immediately submerged them into the hot steaming broth. \n\nI guess if you come here with certain expectations then maybe you'd give this a bad review but if you cone here open to receive whatever is plated for you then I think you just might appreciate the complex simplicity of this particular ramen. There are no gimmicks attached to this one. She's straight up and gives no fucks if you like her or not. She comes as she is and its on you if you want to build a relationship with her. If you want to continue to learn the different ingredients about her that you may have missed or revisit certain ingredients that you were not quite sure of but will to give it another try.

It's kind of nice because regardless of whether you sit \"outside\" or inside the restaurant, you're still basically indoors (aka not the cold). The outside tables are kind of nicer anyways because they're less claustrophobic though people to walk around the mall. \n\nMy friend wasn't too hungry, so I ended up ordering  a Chashu Shoyu-Flavored Ramen ($11.25) with a extra small bowl side of Curry Chicken Rice ($3.25) for her...so pretty economical! The Shoyu Ramen was pretty tasty--The broth was light, warm, and savory, and the ramen noodles were cooked well. The only thing that disappointed me was the chashu--it was dry and not that flavorful, which made me extra sad because I actually paid extra for more of it thinking it would be better.\n\nOther than that, service was pretty good. It was pretty packed by the time we were eating but we didn't have to wait too long to flag down a waitress. I noticed the low health food rating after eating here, but like other people, I didn't get sick I guess. Hopefully they are improving with cleanliness...

I was down to try the much talked about ramen upstairs (Marafuku) but due to a dead battery, I lost my place in line. \n\nSuzu opts for a clear broth with neither the complexity nor the flavor to hold the dish up. I selected my broth - shio - a salt based broth that lacks any of the punches that comes with shoyu (soy sauce) or miso based broths. While my broth was definitely light and salty, it was also lacking in depth with barely any hints of the typical ramen components or flavor profiles. \n\nMy ramen came with spicy green onions which likely would've helped the broth give it some much needed kick. Unfortunately, the spicy sauce neither enhanced the flavor nor did it make the ramen any better. It was there, along with a ton of green onions, which I can at least attest to tasted like green onions.\n\nNext up were the noodles - thin and springy - but ultimately better suited to Chinese noodle soups. Ramen noodles tend to be firmer and chewier, without much bounce to the texture or the bite. These noodles would go well with wonton noodle soup, but I wouldn't pair it with ramen.\n\nFinally, I was given a tough, chewy SINGLE piece of chashu in my soup. Talk about disappointed.

The one thing I absolutely hate about this area is the ridiculously expensive parking, even for the metered ones. It costs $4 for ONE HOUR. Are you kidding? My poor hubby had to run out multiple times just to add a few more quarters.\n\nLuckily, our lunch at Suzu Noodle House made up for it. Because we were going on a weekday, there wasn't too much of a crowd, but they did have a full house. The space itself is very small, so we opted to have a table outside (keep in mind the restaurant itself is located in a larger building, so it's not REALLY outside). The menu has a lot of variety in terms of ramen and the prices were quite reasonable.\n\nThe hubby chose Suzu Ramen with a shoyu broth that came with karaage (fried chicken), gyoza, and corn while I chose the Kakuni ramen with a miso broth that came with braised pork belly. Each ramen bowl is always served with green onions, bamboo shoots, BBQ pork, and half a boiled egg. For mine, I requested spicy paste on the side for an additional dollar. Our ramen came out in massive, black bowls with beautifully layered toppings. I will say that I was highly disappointed with the boiled egg, seeing a yolk that was fully cooked instead of that delicious golden ooze.\n\nBut the minute we both took a sip of our broths, our disappointment instantly melted away as our astonishment of how tasty the broth took over. After adding the spicy paste, my miso soup had a fragrant undertone that cleared my sinuses with every slurp. The pork belly was undeniably tender, but I definitely had to forgo those inches of fat. I'm sure my arteries thanked me for that. As for my hubby's ramen, his miso soup reminded us a lot of instant ramen, but in the best possible way. It tasted comforting and familiar without all that heavy salt. This was one of the few bowls where he actually almost finished the soup. Surprisingly, the skin of the karaage retained most of its crispy texture, although near the end it did get soggy, and the gyoza had a delicious filling.\n\nWe were both super full by the end of our lunch and practically had to roll ourselves out of there. We're sure Suzu Noodle House is always competing with its fellow ramen parlors, but with quality like this, we think it's doing just fine. In fact, it's probably doing great.", "author": "Quyen L."}

I'm glad he took me here because I really enjoyed every dish we ordered!\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered a bowl of Spicy Chashu Ramen and the Chicken Katsu Curry. The Curry was amazing and best I've had yet in San Francisco, even better than Volcano Curry House in the Inner Richmond. I couldn't get enough and it was my favorite dish of the night. The Ramen was also tasty and good for a cold day in SF, but overall I got tired of it after a few bites and found the broth to be pretty oily.\n\nI definitely will be coming back just for the Curry and perhaps will give the Udon noodles a try too!", "author": "MyTien P."}

The sliced and breaded chicken breast was moist and full of flavor.\nMy \"little brother\" ordered the Suzu ramen and loved it--just a note here --it is presented in a miso broth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-05", "description": "Whenever I come here, I think I actually spend more time browsing the wares at the bonsai store next door while waiting for a table than I do in the actual restaurant. But I don't blame Suzu for that -- it's a hole-in-the-wall with very limited seating and there's a bench next to the front door where customers can wait, which was very thoughtful.\n\nBut I just don't understand why people wait so long for Suzu when there are a plethora of ramen alternatives in the neighborhood. I will admit that I am a sucker for the suzu ramen, which comes with karaage (Japanese fried chicken), gyoza, and corn. Truthfully, when it boils down to it, I think the suzu ramen is just trying too hard because both the karaage/gyoza and the ramen would taste much better separately. The chicken and gyoza get a bit soggy in the broth and the broth suffers from the additional grease. The biggest drawback of the ramen here is definitely the broth -- everyone I come here with comments that it's a little too salty.\n\nSuzu is the place for you if you want 2-in-1 ramen that combines your appetizer with your entree.", "author": "Amy C."}

It wasn't awful food, but I wouldn't call it the best.  \nIt simply satisfied our craving for ramen.... And also made my father-in-law happy since Suzu was his choice for an early Father's Day lunch.\nTo start, we ordered chicken karaage, gyoza, and mixed tempura.  We must have been starving because the four of us scarfed down those apps real quick!\nAs for our ramen, I ordered the Kakuni Ramen in the shio broth, my husband and MIL both ordered the Chasu Ramen in the shoyu broth, and my FIL ordered the Chicken katsu ramen in the shio broth.\n\nSince I rarely leave my tri-valley bubble..... I was excitedly awaiting for this day to arrive because I have been badly craving ramen. \nAlthough I must admit that I was disappointed Suzu does not serve tonkatsu (pork broth), but that's neither here nor there at this point =)\nI think my eyes briefly leaped out of my head when the kind server placed that big, steaming bowl of goodness right in front of me!  I quickly dipped my soup spoon in for a taste of the broth.... And...... it was all right.  \nObviously, the shio broth is much lighter than tonkatsu broth.... But I was, at the very least, expecting a bit of flavor.  The noodles were pretty good, and boy, I had plenty of noodles!  The pork belly in my ramen was tasty as well.\n\nIn short, Suzu provided a hunger satiating, but forgettable, bowl of ramen.  \nThe service is quick, the servers are friendly, and do note that Suzu is quite small therefore expect a wait during the busy lunch / dinner hour(s).", "author": "Marie W."}

The only saving grace was the noodles, which were perfectly chewy and delicious.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nIt was $10-12 per bowl, without any add-ons. I thought this would be a steal, but for the portion size (small, topping almost non-existent), you're really better off paying $2-3 extra and going somewhere else.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nWe put our names down on the waitlist but were pretty much seated right away during lunchtime on a Friday.

The noodles came with a whole big thing of fried onion, sliced cucumbers, sliced something red (probably radish?), bamboo shoots, 2 pieces of fried chicken, and a half a hard boiled egg. The dipping sauce didn't look fat (+1), but was very under flavored and really watery. I was not a big fan of the fried onion, but the rest of the toppings were okay. The most important, but the most disappointing parts were the ramen and dipping broth/soup. The ramen noodles ended being all clumped together and I couldn't dip them into the dipping soup properly. The broth was so under flavored, I ended putting half a jar of chili flakes in the soup. In the very end, I just gave up and poured the broth in the ramen noodles. It didn't really feel like dipping ramen, but more like regular ramen that got separated from its broth.\n\nAlso tried the chicken curry ramen, it was ok.\n\nThe layout of the restaurant is ok, kinda cramped.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-22", "description": "My millennial mindset gravitates towards hip-looking places... possibly because photogenic ramen in a minimalist backdrop makes a good Instagram. (My willingness to pay $$$ for pretty food pictures is my downfall.) I thus did not have high expectations for Suzu Noodle House, a cozy traditional-looking noodle shop in the Japantown mall plaza, but it turned out to be a very satisfying dinner. And despite my biases, the menu wasn't all too oldschool; there were interesting items such as tsukemen and pork belly ramen.\n\nEven though it's called a noodle place, the highlight of our visit was the CURRY. The flavors were nuanced with a blend of spices, overlaying a richly umami base with a creamy consistency. It wasn't too salty and didn't taste out-of-the-box; from my Japanese curry memories I think this rivals Muracci's and surpasses Volcano. It's also clever that they serve it in this curved bowl, because it allows the curry to mix well with the rice while the kaarage and vegetable crisp are placed uphill and don't get soggy. \n\nThe fried items were Japanese comfort food indulgence. The kaarage was meaty (though I still find Iza the juiciest), and the vegetable crisp was a novel spin on tempura (reminded me of Korean pajeon/vegetable pancakes).\n\nThe TSUKEMEN came with the same delicious kaarage and vegetable crisp, but unfortunately nothing much to rave about beyond that. I was most disappointed by the dipping ramen broth, which tasted essentially like miso soup--I want to give the benefit of the doubt and say they mixed it up, because I would be flipping tables if they gave me miso soup for ramen broth. The noodles were alright, al dente but clumpy and somewhat bland... which obviously was not rectified by the non-ramen-broth dipping soup.\n\nService is quite efficient, and the food came out in no time. The downside is that the food only seemed lukewarm, so be warned if you're picky about steamy hot bowls of noodle soup (which is generally highly preferable in SF weather).\n\nIt's a small space and you can expect to wait during peak hours, but it's not as crazy as the ramen scene can get (*cough cough* Mensho). The waitlist moves quickly, because people tend to sign in and walk around elsewhere, and if you're not present they go to the next party down the list. We came around 7pm on a Friday night, a time that would typically be formidable in SF, and we snagged a table in 5 minutes.\n\nAs most of their items are ~$11-12, the prices are very reasonable. The total after tax and tip came out to $15 per person. We had actually intended to just take a few bites and take the rest home for leftovers, so that we could check out Fat Angel afterwards. For better or for worse, we couldn't stop eating the yummy curry, kaarage, and noodles at Suzu and ended up finishing our plates P: P: P:", "author": "Edna C."}

The miso ramen soup tasted a little dull and the pieces of meat they added looked sad.

Takoyaki was ok. The red ginger provided was too salty spicy, personally would prefer the ones that have a bit more tart and sweet too. Also never saw it served with green onions [which looked really old and dry]\n\n2. Suza ramen eh. Never had \"ramen\" with gyoza and karaage[maybe as a side dish but not inside]. It comes with bok choy, corn, chashu, half an egg, karaage, and gyoza. So the gyoza was too soggy and ...tbh didnt really taste the filling inside. Karaage I thought was not bad, probably cause the gyoza already setting the bar pretty low. Chashu was ok too. nothing amazing. The noodles, personally, I would not call it \"ramen\" reminds me of when you go to hong kong restaurants and you order the wonton noodle soup. It basically was like that but a SMINGE thicker/chewier. Also bokchoy is usually in hk style noodles not...ramen.. Broth was ok too. Again nothing amazing but was a decent place for my friends and I to hang out for a quick meal. \n\nSOoo you ask why the 1 star? well , let. me. tell. you. cringes hard* So the interiors to this place is super tiny and their cashier behind the counter allows you to see the dishwashing area but not kitchen.

To my horror, after he applied the soap, he picked up the rack and what was resting under it, was raw meat [pork im assuming] . He put the rack away and proceeded to , again , sloppily rinse the soap and water off the meat. dude. that is effin disgusting and unhygienic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "description": "I've returned to Suzu Noodle House a couple times since my last review, which I wrote almost six years ago. According to Joseph L, this place has changed owners, but I haven't noticed a difference. It doesn't seem like this restaurant has skipped a beat as it's been consistently busy the times I've visited or passed by walking around Japan Center. You still have to write your name on a waiting list outside. A server will call your party when an appropriate-sized table is ready.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous review, Suzu is located inside Miyako Mall at Japan Center in Japantown. It's just inside the Post St entrance near Webster St, on the ground level. The restaurant is small with seating for about 30 inside and about a half-dozen outside (in the mall) at three two-tops. I wouldn't come here with a group larger than 4 to 6 people. Even a party of 6 could be pushing it. Note there's an automatic 18% gratuity applied for parties of 5 or more. Reservations are not accepted.\n\nSuzu offers 17 different types of ramen, priced at $9.50 to $12.95 per bowl, and 4 different types of soba and udon noodles, priced at $8.95 to $11.95 per bowl. In addition, they have $11.95 nabeyaki udon hot pots. Nabeyaki udon is served inside a hot pot with ingredients like vegetables, tofu, seaweed, and egg. Aside from noodles, you can also get Japanese appetizers like agedashi tofu and takoyaki (fried octopus balls), most for about $6 or less per plate; various rice bowls (don) added as a side for $3-5 per bowl; and $10.95 plates of Japanese curry. Beverage-wise, a limited selection of beer, wine, and sake are available.\n\nGenerally, this is a quick, casual, and reliable Japanese restaurant. The food isn't going to knock your socks off, but it's been good every time I've had it. I consider it comfort food. This is one of my sister's favorite places to eat in Japantown.\n\nI noticed Suzu no longer has \"Tokyo Ramen\" on the menu, but it could've just been renamed. Two ramen have been marked off the menu. I tried the \"Suzu Ramen\" ($12.95, their most expensive ramen) on my last visit. It comes with two pieces of karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and gyoza (dumplings) plus corn, greens, chashu (braised pork), and half a boiled egg.\n\nYou can choose the broth on any of the ramen. They offer shoyu (soy sauce), miso, and shio (salt). They do not have tonkotsu. I had the shoyu broth with my Suzu ramen and the bowl was A-OK. The ingredients were fresh and the bowl was filling. It was far from the tastiest bowls of ramen I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The pieces of karaage and gyoza were nice and big. I'm not used to having pieces of karaage and gyoza floating around in my ramen soup and it worked out better than I expected. The outside of the karaage did get expectedly soggy though. Ultimately, I was satisfied.\n\nSince my original review, I've also tried the tonkatsu don add-on ($3) and it was delicious. It's a small version of tonkatsu (Japanese fried pork cutlet) with tonkatsu sauce on top, laid atop a bed of white rice inside a bowl. The tonkatsu was delectably crispy. It's kind of like schnitzel. The tonkatsu sauce is similar to Worcestershire sauce. Too bad they don't have a full-sized tonkatsu entree. I bet it'd be good.\n\nMy sister really likes the udon noodles served soba-style, meaning cold and with the dipping sauce on the side. The thick noodles are served on a plate topped with shredded seaweed with a tiny clump of wasabi. She's been getting this dish for years. You can get udon or soba noodles served hot or cold and with sides like tempura.\n\nService is speedy. Orders come out from the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time and waiting for a table still doesn't take more than 10 to 15 minutes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-18", "description": "TL;DR: slightly disappointing ramen, underwhelming broth, good service, small space\n\nSuzu Noodle House is a well-known and popular ramen spot in Japantown, but lacks the wow factor of a quality ramen establishment. The vibe and look of the restaurant adds to the feeling of Japantown, but I would research other options in the area for dining.\n\nI came here with a group of friends on a Friday for lunch. There was a bit of a wait, but luckily, there's a lot of shops to check out around. I think one of the biggest problems this restaurant has is the space constraint. I felt very cramped during our meal. The service at this place is really great. The servers were attentive and cared about how our meal was going. All of our dishes came out at relatively similar times and really quickly.\n\nI ordered the Chasu Ramen with Shoyu flavoring. My bowl wasn't all that special. I didn't find much presentation value out of it, even though that's not what I came for. My meal as a whole wasn't anything to write home about; it was just typical ramen. I was hoping for something phenomenal or more authentic. The chasu was flavored well and the noodles were plentiful. I feel that the broth was a little lacking in flavor or impact on the dish. I added chili powder to the broth, but I didn't feel it made that much impact. I would say I was a little disappointed with my meal, but it's worth a shot if you're looking for ramen in Japantown.\n\nI feel as if I'm reviewing very negatively for a business that is well-known in the area. Take my opinion with a grain of salt, as ramen isn't exactly my area of expertise. I'm not sure if I'll be coming back to Suzu in the future. I hope this opinion helps your foodie adventures out.", "author": "Calvin T."}

The bowls were huge, and the broth was good with the help of the spicy sauce. Only complaint I have is the chashu, where were incredibly lean and dry tasting. I ordered the spicy ramen and I was a little hesitant, because based on many reviews they mentioned that it was incredibly spicy. It only come in one spicy level, but I was able to get the spicy sauce onto the side and just add it into my broth to my taste. And boy, am I glad that I did that. I was given two different kinds of spicy sauce and I added less than 1/4 to my bowl and it was spicyy! To give you an idea, I usually order medium spicy everywhere I go.

We got to Suzu Noodle House at about 11:30 pm and we were the second ones to sign up on the list. We sat near the stairs (that were directly in front of the restaurant) since the bench next to the restaurant entrance was full, but as we waited for our name to be called we noticed more people signing up and other people going in. I looked at the list and noticed my name was crossed off and they went through about 5 other groups that had signed up before me. I told the waitress who called the names and all she did was circle our name back. When she did call our name she said to us in the quietest voice ever, \"Next time you should sit closer.\" Seriously? That was rude of her especially considering she didn't even apologize for skipping us. And it's no wonder we couldn't hear her because you could barely hear her from 1 foot away.\nWe ordered the ebi tempura ramen with miso broth, the cha shu ramen with shoyu ramen, and takoyaki as an appetizer. Service got bad and weird again when we got our food. First, they gave my boyfriend his order, waited a minute or so until the same waitress from earlier brought me what I thought was mine. Turns out she was about to give me a different table's ramen. On top of that they brought out our takoyaki (the appetizer I might add) last. The takoyaki was pretty decent considering it was my first time having it. The octopus inside wasn't overcooked or anything and it was nice and soft inside. The ebi ramen consisted of ebi tempura, one large piece of bok choy (just a leaf not even a whole bok choy), a few pieces of bamboo shoot, half an egg, and green onions. I expected the tempura to be soggy since it was in the broth but it was still pretty flavorful and the shrimp was cooked well. My boyfriend's cha shu also consisted of the same ingredients besides the meat substance. The cha shu was actually pretty soft but there wasn't enough flavoring in the meat. The ramen noodles in both of our orders could have been cooked a little more as it was a little too al dente to me. \nOverall, Suzu is alright. I've gone to cheaper places and ordered more \"colorful\" bowl of ramen where they included fish cakes and more than one vegetable.

While the servings are pretty generous, they leave a lot to be desired in the taste department.\n\nDown to the actual food:\n- Chicken Karaage (3 stars): 5 bulky pieces of chicken that I was not entirely sure whether they were cooked long enough (would have preferred them much smaller) and the side salad was drenched in dressing.  A lemon slice on side would have been nice.\n- Gyoza (2 stars): 4 pieces of super bland, oily, misshapen gyoza and weak dipping sauce.  Very likely that these were previously frozen.\n- Ramen (miso): I'm a huge ramen aficionado, so I have fairly high standards.  The way I think of it, I'm downing something pretty unhealthy so I might as well really enjoy it!\n-- broth (1 star): wow where to start. the broth was super duper oily and lacked any sort of flavor. I barely sipped any of it, and even the spicy sauce on the side didn't help.  You could look at the bowl from the top and see a thin layer of oil across the top.\n-- pork belly (4 stars): the saving grace of this ramen place.

I feel like an authentic ramen shop would at least pay attention to the egg, to make sure they cook it soft boiled! The soft boiled egg is the best part! In all, the place was just OK. I would probably venture to other locations if I want a true bowl of ramen.", "author": "Amanda T."}

Since I'm not a big fan of ramen, i was prepared to order gyoza as my meal since ramen places usually don't serve much more than ramen. \n\nI was happy to know there was a variety of rice bowls here, and even happier to know that with your ramen or noodles, you could order an extra rice bowl with some meat for just $3.50! Ok, for most people that bowl of rice wouldn't be enough for a full meal, but I happen to eat less than the average American so it was perfect size with me,plus my bf shared a couple spoons of his ramen.\n\nThe rice bowl I got was the kakunidon, a bowl of rice with 2 big pieces of wuhuarou (the fatty pork belly, quite common in Chinese cuisine, i didnt know Japanese also ate it), some ginger, green onion and mustard. It was really delicious! Smelled sweet, since the sauce you usually cook this meat in has both soy sauce (salty) and brown sugar (sweet) and it was also very tender. I just wished there was more meat because I tend to avoid the fattier parts of that cut and then end up with too little meat.\n\nThe ramen was also good, my bf loved it because the broth was thick and rich. It comes with pork, green onions, bamboo shots and a boiled egg. He got extra noodles for +$2 and then couldn't finish it. Noodles were soft but firm, tasty as well. \n\nService was attentive, the server brought a small bowl with the ramen because she supposed we were sharing it.\n\nThe bill came for $16.50 plus tip, pretty decent for SF.

The two people who were seated first next to us had their food before we even were asked if we want water. \n\nThen when we got the food, finally, there was a bug in my friends ramen. It looked like some kind of larvae squirming on the bok choy. It completely put us off our appetite, and even when we didn't finish what we ordered we had to ask for any compensation. The waitress said the fact they made a new ramen should be enough but she'll take off 10% total bill. On top of that, the food itself was very poor quality. The gyoza was not made correctly nor was the ramen. The pork slice was so tough to eat. I've had my fair share of Japanese food since I've lived in Tokyo for half a year and I'm half Japanese myself.

They had a bunch of different choices which made deciding that much harder for us.\n\nI decided to get the Spicy Miso Ramen without a don because the noodle portions already looked really big to me. I'm glad I made that choice because I could barely finish all my food and everyone else who ordered dons ended not being able to finish everything. \n\nPrices were very reasonable, especially for the quantity and quality of food offered. I had read that the place was really cheap and I was afraid that the noodles would be really sad and lackluster. My one complaint would be that the Ramen I got had A LOT of oil in it. Probably mostly from the spicy oil.

I'm from Sacramento, and I enjoy a few places for ramen there... but I had high expectations for the ramen in SF. We were at Japan Town and selected Suzu because it had pretty positive reviews on Yelp and looked like a fine place to eat.\n\nSuzu offered up a good bowl or ramen, but I have to say that there are places in Sacramento that can best Suzu. The food at Suzu is certainly good, but it's just missing a little bit to take it over the top and be great.\n\nFor dinner, we had three ramen noodle bowls and a small mapo (tofu) rice bowl. The rice bowl came first. While the portion was good for the price, the tofu was a bit heavy handed in terms of the taste. The tofu wasn't as silken as it should have been, and the sauce was a bit over-thick for me.\n\nFor ramen, we ordered the pork belly ramen, vegetarian, and wonton. I personally had the pork belly ramen, and I think it was the best of the three we had. The pork belly paired very well with the ramen. The bowl came with a hard boiled egg - which tasted fine, but I prefer the soft boiled gooey egg that other places serve. The ramen noodles themselves were a little al dente. They had a nice chew to them that was satisfying.\n\nI had a chance to try both of the other ramen bowls. The wonton was good, but lacked the flavor punch of the pork belly, and the vegetarian ramen was a bit bland. It did seem to have the most ingredients in it though. We were surprised at how big the vegetarian ramen was compared to the others... in fact, it was so much we had to take it home in a to-go container.\n\nIn terms of service, Suzu was excellent. We were very well taken care of, and the servers were extremely friendly. The servers came at appropriate times and provided everything we needed with a smile. I cannot fault anything about this aspect of Suzu.\n\nOverall, Suzu is a good place to get a bowl of ramen - I'd definitely go again, but I do think there are other noodle houses that can have a better bowl of ramen. If you find yourself in Japan Town and want some ramen, this might be your best bet!", "author": "Luke C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "I came in a hot, fine Saturday afternoon when the store opened, and saw the pictures of what items they sell at their restaurant. Ramen, soba and was enticed by the Tsukemen. Tsukemen is ramen noodles accompanied with a deep fried vegetable fritter, 2 karaage topped with bamboo shots, pickled ginger, shaved leeks with a mild spicy miso dipping sauce on the side. I was so excited when I received my meal... it looks delicious and cannot wait to dig in.\nSo I was trying to get some of the ramen noodles and dip it. But I was having a hard time because it was so long, and decided to cut with my chopsticks. To no avail, I decided to put some dipping sauce onto the noodles. Mmmm... this was spicy but salty in a good way. Then ate the karaage - not too greasy and it was hot. Great filler and the chicken was cooked right. Then I mixed the pickled ginger, bamboo shots and some shaved leeks.It was becoming more of a smorgasbord of flavors... crunchy, sweet, savory, umami, sour, and spicy. It was getting to the point where my tastebuds wanted more. On my third bites decided to dip my ramen with the mild spicy miso. It was an amazing experience, and was definitely better in terms of food experience and taste.\nLessons learned: try to cut your noodles first with a soup spoon provided for you. Then dip the ramen noodles into the miso dipping sauce. Then eat the karaage and the vegetable fritter to have a more filling meal. This item was thumbs up = 3.5/5.\nI also ordered the Kanuki - so it is a braised sweet soy sauce pork belly with a small dollop of yellow mustard, pickled ginger, and had some Japanese leeks on top. The braised pork belly was seasoned well. This was really great appetizer, and also a great side dish that can go with any ramen, tsukemen (in may case) or a rice bowl. The yellow mustard was first unusual combo because I said,\"what is mustard doing here? That's an odd combination. So I cut up a small piece of the pork belly, and dip some with yellow mustard and little bit of pork ginger. I tasted and it goes well together. So the fatty and well braised soy sauce pork belly and the yellow mustard cuts out the fattiness and greasiness and richness of the pork belly. It also heightens my tastebuds to eat more of the tsukemen, and definitely goes well together. Kakuni is 4.3/5.\nI was satisfied with my meal but thought they give you too much in terms of portion size. Sometimes, your eyes fool you how the food is presented, in terms of portion size. Later on you realize you cannot finish it. That's a bummer for me. A person with a small appetite but loves to try out new dishes and cuisines of discovering new food experiences and expanding a grand food experience whether it travelling locally, by region or travel abroad.\nCustomer service is 5. They really care whether your food experience has been met, and all of the servers are knowledgeable, nice. 5/5.\nAmbience - it is a very small restaurant but they have outdoor seating. This restaurant fills up very quickly once it opened its doors. Wait times are 15 minutes or longer. 3/5. Otherwise, place is clean and organized. You can see the kitchen is small but very well organized. Food comes out very fast.\nSuzu Noodle house serves ramen, soba, zaru soba, few rice bowls and interesting array of appetizers and tsukemen. They also have Sapporo beer, sake, hot tea and other cold beverages to go with your meal. I had a great experience trying out a new item which is tsukemen which is chewy ramen noodles dipping with a savory, umami and mildly spiced miso sauce. These are accompanied by a deep fried vegetable fritter which is nice and not too greasy. it was crunchy yet satisfying great with carrots, cucumbers and some taro. Then the karaage gave me a filler to eat with my tsukemen. The killer Kakuni is a sweet soy sauce braised pork belly that has been fried first, then braised with a sweet soy sauce. Then it served with a small dollop of yellow mustard, pickled ginger and leek shavings on top. This appetizer should be tried with your meal whether it is a piping hot ramen, soba, tsukemen or maybe a donburi. This dish was a game changer because of the odd combination of yellow mustard that is sweet, slight of horseradish accent with yellow mustard condiment and pork belly. it cuts out the fattiness and richness of the pork belly, and heightens to eat more of your complementing meal of the day. I would order this next time with either donburi next time. I enjoyed my time here, yet it was a satisfying lunch which is different. I guess I was remembering some moments watching Kodome No Gurume or The Solitary Gourmet, how the food taste so amazing.

The restaurant is fairly small, but they have a couple of tables around the outside as well. I got to try both the chashu ramen and the special spicy tsukemen here. I personally find the ramen to taste better here as the tsukemen broth was slightly lacking in flavor and spiciness, and it tasted fairly similar to the ramen broth. However, the tsukemen came with a neat mixed vegetable tempura thingie that had nice crisp and flavor to it. The chashu ramen is simply great with all that great melt in your mouth slices of pork. The noodles are somewhere towards the middle of the scale of soft-firm ramen noodles and have a nice consistency to them. The only thing I wish they could change in their ramen is having soft boiled eggs rather than hard boiled eggs as that is the last step to take to make it supah sugoi! :3", "author": "Joshua M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-06-26", "description": "Prior to our last two visits (the most recent one just this past Sunday on June 23rd), I had rated this place as 4 stars for the very same reasons from other Yelper's review. \n\nHowever, after our last two visits, I have to notch off a couple of stars and rank them below par. \n\nTwo main reasons:\n\nFirst - \n\nThey always get confused on who is next on the reservations list. Even when you marked your name way before other patrons, they always call patrons that have arrived way after you first. I understand that these patrons are a party of two, but couldn't you wait for two tables to open up and combine them together to meet our group? C'mon now! This doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this flaw out. \n\nIt gets frustrating to see group after group after group get tables knowing that you had been there way, way, way before them. This past Sunday, there was a group of five waiting patiently as their name was on the waiting list forever and they called a group of four that had recently arrived prior to them and they had to call them back as soon as the group of five threw a hissy fit. \n\nTalk about awkward. I would have done the same, too. \n\nSecond - \n\nI can no longer order extra pork for my Ramen. Are. You. Kidding. Me?!\n\nWhy have a section of extra add-ons on the menu and exempt one dish? You mean to tell me I can order extra shrimp, extra noodles, extra etc.. except the pork. Where is the disclosure? You should at least have that written on the menu. For two bucks, I opted for the \"extra\" shrimp and what I got was one measly, overly fried, oily and dead shrimp tempura that could have substituted as a fly on my Ramen. This does not make sense for a Ramen joint. \n\nAnd now that I got my blood boiling and got me rolling, I'm gonna add a third reason:\n\nThat server with a snarly, b*tchy attitude. You shouldn't be working as a server and you have no skills in customer service. You are good at slamming orders at the guest's tables and you look miserable while you're there. Is it always that time of the month with you? Wow, you should start your own training program for servers on how to delicately offend customers and get away with it because you don't give a damn attitude.

I don't know how much effort was made but just FYI it was appreciated. \n\nYou may have heard of the food here already, or maybe you've noticed that they're always full up, but let me just confirm that the food is delicious.

The noodles seemed more reminiscent of instant ramen than the homemade noodles they were known for.

You get a lot of ramen, and if THAT isn't enough, make your meal a combo for an additional $3-5 and you'll be stuffed!", "author": "Denise L."}

Broth was lukewarm when it arrived at the table. I would honest to god prefer to eat a packet of ramen at home over this. \n\nMoreover service was particularly bad. Waitress gave us an unbelievable amount of attitude for asking questions about the ramen flavor.

Maybe this is a particular style of ramen that I don't understand, but the ramen and the broth are literally nothing special. However, they do serve huge portions of ramen. I also got the karage don as a side $3.50, which was 3 small pieces of chicken over rice. It's not crispy, tasted like it's been sitting out. \n\nI would not wait over 5 minutes for this place when there are a handful of way better tasting ramen choices within 2 block radius (i.e. Waraku or  Yamadaya - I am not endorsed in any way by them).", "author": "Irene S."}

There were a few names in front of ours but we had only about a 10-15 minute wait. \n\nI decided to go with the spicy ramen ($9.95) which I found only average.  Suzu's standard ramen is typically served in a chicken and pork broth and LIMITED amount of toppings: green onions, bamboo shoots, 1 piece of pork and half a boiled egg.  In addition to the standard ramen, the spicy ramen came with chili pork slices and bean sprouts.  It seemed like only chili oil was added to my broth which took away the hearty chicken and pork flavor I was expecting.  The egg noodles were ok, not too chewey.  Though you're given a decent amount of noodles, the lack of toppings and lack of flavoring of the broth is enough for me to probably not return.\n\nSERVICE:\nI guess service here is a hit or miss.

I gotta say 2 things about Suzu: SALTY and LONG WAIT.\n\nThe wait is almost as long as Ramen Dojo in San Mateo. The difference? Dojo is FIVE STARS and Suzu is TWO! The taste is maybe a 3, but the wait made it a 2.\n\nWAIT: Sunday for lunch we waited for 45 minutes. Usually a wait means it's good, right? Not this place! Overrated. Probably just a long wait because it's in the infamous Japantown.\n\nWHAT: various types of ramen, and from reading a bunch of the reviews during my lovely 45 minute wait, it looked like miso, tokyo (now called shoyu), tonkatsu, and spicy ramen were among the favorites. \n\n-- I tried miso [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gPUXFQkf4koX8CmWJR7wMg?select=3Fbqp51BPddALKvkLiU9EQ#k8G8yxv3qd8dQR-hJbTcYw], and it was ok, but a bit salty, as I expected from all the Yelpers. My routine was noodle, soup, tea. Noodle, soup, tea. Nonstop. My friend got the spicy ramen and said he liked it, but it was way too spicy for my taste. \n\n-- Noodles were a bit chewy, apparently the newsletter in the front of their restaurant (yes, I was really trying to entertain myself during the 45 min wait) said they make hand made noodles every day and hand pick their own bamboo shoots. If only their soup wasn't so salty! Work on that Suzu!! Yelpers think this place either has really salty or bland broth! \n\n-- Good note: order their karaage.  That was actually pretty good. \n\n-- I like how they give you free hard boiled (not soft boiled) egg and free tea. But tea is necessary since it's so salty haha\n\nPRICE: $8-12 depending what you get. Miso ramen was $8.95, spicy ramen was $9.95. \n\nWORTH IT?: No. In SF area, I would recommend Saiwaii Ramen for their spicy garlic miso. But best ramen in the bay is Ramen Dojo.

It must be good.\"\n*Walks in Suzu Noodle House*\n\n*Sees a crowd outside Suzu\"\n\"Yo, that place looks CRACKIN'!\"\n\"Yah, bro we're only in SF once so let's check it out.\"\n*Puts name on waitlist*\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nOne of my friends was craving ramen but he didn't want to drive down to San Mateo so we ended up at Suzu. There's always a crowd outside Suzu so I thought it had to be good. For me, a tale-tell sign of a good Asian restaurant is if you see native patrons. There was zero at Suzu. \n\nSuzu specializes in ramen, udon and soba with house-made noodles. There are also various dons (rice bowls) and curries on the menu. Can't decide? They have combos were you can mix and match ramen, udon or soba with a don of your choice. \n\nOk, ok so I know ordering a don in a noodle house is like ordering fish at a steakhouse but let me explain. I'm allergic to MSG so I try to stay away from soupy/saucy Asian foods. Also, I was eyeing the other table's ramen and the portion of noodles seemed very large which immediately set off in my head that it's probably \"quantity\" over \"quality\". If I'm going to get a MSG attack, it better be worth it and this case it didn't look to be. \n\nCHICKEN KATSU DON - $10.95\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gPUXFQkf4koX8CmWJR7wMg?select=p_01XBxOX6m_4WGs0DBv1w\nOne breaded chicken cutlet was sliced and placed top of a Mount Everest mountain of rice and drizzled with tonkatsu sauce. The katsu was crisp and tender but very bland. The tonkatsu sauce tasted straight from a bottle as it had that syrupy consistency. It was nothing that I couldn't get at Nijiya Market down the block in the pre-packed food section for half the price.\n \nMy friend, the human vacuum (but never gains weight) ordered the ramen combo with a katsu don. He normally inhales his food and finishes our leftovers. This time he didn't even finish his own food. My other friend ordered the curry don which she didn't like. I tried a sip of the broth and it was awful. The broth was ALL salt with no depth of flavor or spice. It tasted like it was made from a powder packet. You can actually still taste the raw curry powder in the broth like it wasn't cooked long enough in the broth. \n\nService was equally as bad. The rude waitresses passed our table over 10 times without coming to take our order. It wasn't a big deal at first since we were busy chatting. We had to wave our hands in the air to get their attention. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. \n\n2.5 STARS rounded up to 3 STARS for filling my tummy without an MSG attack. \n\nJust because a restaurant has a crowd outside does NOT mean it's good. Thanks for the lesson, Suzu. \n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Small restaurant with 30 seats\n*It's always crowded even on non-peak hours\n*Expect a 30-45 minute wait during peak hours on weekends \n*CC's Accepted", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

There's little things here and there I would nit pick about, but overall a good place to grab ramen if you're in jtown. \n\nFirst of all, on my second visit it had a horrible smell on the corner booth that I had to move to the table by the door to move away from it. The odor smelled a lot like piss, which made no sense since we literally walked in when it opened and was the first few customers to arrive. I don't know if it's the water they use to wipe down the table or its been there, but the odor was so strong I moved over to the table by the door for fresh air. But there was another couple behind us, who stayed at their table so I'm not sure if it was just the table I was at. Either way, horrible representation of the restaurant to be smelling like piss inside the facility.\n\nThe bowls here are pretty big, really satisfying. I really love the broth here. It's not too salty and doesn't taste like a bowl of sodium. I love drinking the broth on its own even without the noodles. The first time I got the spicy miso ramen which I think is just extra bean spourts in the bowl and second time I had the one with spicy miso with spicy green onion in it, whichever that was. I'm a little disappointed that they serve a hard boiled egg oppose to a soft boiled one. Overall, the broth and the noodles are good. I'm not too big of a fan of the extra toppings I had chose, but I could bypass that factor. Nothing really special though. They have all these \"different\" types of ramen, but its really just an extra topping in it that makes it \"different\". Expected more in the bowl. A few of the selections definitely could be combined with other ones to make one kind of bowl. For that, it loses a star and another one for their bad smell in the restaurant.

Since my bf & I had an appointment for a massage at nearby Therapeia we decided to dine in at Suzu.  We got there no later than 10 minutes after it's 11:30 opening on Sunday & though it's a small restaurant, it was already packed.  We did however luck out because one of the two tables outside were free.  \n\nI liked their extensive menu, I'm used to not seeing so many choices for Ramen.  And I have to admit that their rice dishes looked good too.  I settled on the Suzu Ramen ($12.95) and he got the Chicken Karaage Ramen ($10.95).  We waited awhile for our food, about 20-25 minutes, usually ramen is pretty quick!  My Suzu Ramen had chicken karaage, two pieces of pork and two fried gyoza.  Plenty of the juicy chicken and the gyoza still remained fairly crispy.  The pork was so tasty, probably the tastiest pork that I've had in my ramen!  They give plenty of al dente noodles.  Both our ramen came with an egg, green onions and bamboo shoots.  The bamboo shoots needed to be cooked longer however.  \n\nAfter bf finished his bowl he said two words that totally shocked me, I'm full!  He was shocked himself too because he's never full from ramen or pho.  So, Suzu must give bigger portions!  \n\nI can't wait to get another bowl of ramen here!

When you pick a ramen flavor, you also specify which type of broth you want (out of shio, miso, and shoyu). I got the shio flavor. What I like about the soup is that it is not very salty and I can taste the chicken stock. My favorite part about the ramen is actually the two pieces of gyoza they put in it.

Each type of ramen has incredibly flavorful broth, and I love that they put egg and seaweed in it. The addition of corn never hurts either! My favorite has always been the Chicken Karaage ramen since the karaage they make is great and goes well with the broth. I'm also a big fan of their curry ramen. It's a bit oily, but it has a nice kick to it and the broth has lots of flavor. It's definitely a nice change of pace when you don't feel like getting \"normal\" ramen such as miso, tonkatsu, etc...\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small, which explains why the line can get pretty long at times.

(I'll allot another for the friendly service and overall cleanliness of the place.)\n\nI mean, that's why I came here: for the ramen. I'm in Japantown. I don't want any old ramen. I want good, solid Japanese-style ramen. The kind that gives you a facial when it's placed in front of you. The kind that has a chewy bite to its noodles, with a soft-boiled egg that adds creaminess to the pork-bone broth. The kind that has flavorful and moist chashu (pork slices), with bamboo and green onion added for flavor and texture contrast.\n\nYeah, the ramen here had none of that. With too-salty a broth, an overcooked (and cold) hard-boiled half-egg, sinewy pieces of pork, and bamboo that overpowered the broth, I nearly cried into my bowl of soup. But I didn't, as that would only make it saltier than I could already handle.

It came with a generous helping of kakuni (pork belly), green onion, bamboo, and half of a hard-boiled egg. The bowls are giant and mostly filled with broth. Although the broth is flavorful and I have not yet felt a desperate thirst after eating here, it did not stand out to me compared to the other ramen spots I've tried (Orenchi, Ramen Dojo, Santouka, etc).

Tasted like it was made with water from the Dead Sea.  In other words, it was true to its origin in being Japanese by being way too salty.  On my trip to Japan in 2008, Momma Lim and I had stopped by a local street ramen store that appeared to be pretty popular by the amount of locals that were eating in it.  The ramen was so salty that we had to pour iced green tea (served complimentary) into our soup to eat the ramen.  They did say that colon cancer is 2nd (or was it 1st) cause of death in the country.  Lung cancer actually may top that being that Japanese people love their cigarettes.  But I digress... the Tokio ramen at Suzu was equivalent to that soup base in Tokyo.  Would it have been different if it was a different ramen like miso ramen? Perhaps, but salty ramen is still salty ramen! And salt is not good as an overdose!\n\nTempura Udon: was not exceptional either.  I've had others that were equivalent if not better than what I tasted that night.  For one, there seemed to be a lack of sustenance in the dish.  After you put in your tempura shrimp which was served separately (and for good reason otherwise they would've become super soggy), there was only a few pieces of actual seaweed and kamaboko pieces.  The majority of the dish was udon noodle and soup!\n\nEel and Avocado roll: fresh avocado slices with unagi (bbq eel) wrapped in nori and rice.  Nothing extraordinary.

The takoyaki had way too much sauce than needed, making the exterior more mushy than it should be. The chicken kaarage was good, but to me, it just tasted like Taiwan popcorn chicken. In my opinion, chicken kaarage should be pretty different in taste than popcorn chicken, even considering the fact that they are both seasoned fried chicken. \n\nAs for the ramen, I decided to try the Shio Ramen, which had excellent broth, but the noodles surely needed some serious work. I understand that the noodles were not hand made, but maybe with a different brand of store-bought-noodles, this noodle would have jumped from 3-stars to a 4 or maybe even 5. In a bowl of ramen, the noodles are as important as the broth, and although I was a huge fan of the light and clean taste of the Shio, the noodles' lack of uniqueness just didn't quite do it for me. \n\nI haven't tried the other ramen shops in Japan Town, so I really dont have much to compare to other than the ramen restaurants in LA.

They have some interesting flavours like the Suzu which is ramen topped with gyoza and chicken kara-age and the usual goodies, or mabo (mapo) tofu items, hiyashi chuka (cold noodles chinese style) and quite a few donburis.\n\nI opted for the Mabo Ramen (who thought of putting my favourite Chinese dish on ramen!! It's a brilliant idea). The noodles came out a bit undercooked and I could taste the flour. However, let sit in the broth and it becomes pretty yummy. The broth is pretty standard. I guess it didn't wow me. The Mabo topping was a bit disappointing too -- while the spicy Japanese-style flavours are there, I barely found any meat, and the flavour got way too diluted with the broth. More sauce, more meat would've made this a better bowl of ramen.\n\nAlso, the Mabo bowl lacked any other condiments. Another disappointment there (some menma/bamboo shoots wouldn't hurt). Maybe their Mabo donburis would be better?\n\nI stole a piece of chicken kara-age from the mister, and that tasted great. Although, fried chicken is fried chicken, and is hard to mess up too much.\n\nWe went during dinner rush but didn't have to wait too long for a table. The turnover is fast for tables of 2. I'd say, if there are less than 10 names on the list, you can safely put your name down.

I used to adore this place, by far the best place to eat in Japantown SF. Their broths were a bit salty but was so on point back then. I can easily gulp the whole bowl down. Now all I get are mediocre tasting broth served to me luke warm and little accompaniments (which i didn't mind back then because their broth and ramen was so perfectly delicious).\n\nI went to Suzu last Saturday for my friend's birthday and waited a bit to get seated, no surprise there. I never minded the wait, as Suzu was worth it to me. I quickly realized my usual Suzu special was not there anymore, super sad face. So i settled for the pork belly ramen. Which you guessed it, came with half an egg...a few pieces of pork belly,...and ramen. And then you think to yourself...hmm not that bad...i can live with this, until you tasted the pork belly! What is this? Weird tasting sweet marinade covering this over cook piece of porkbelly. Even my imaginary friend could've cooked a juicier piece of pork belly. I was utterly disappointed. \n\nFor everyone who have been going to Suzu for a long time, please go there again and let me know that i'm not tripping. That the great tasting ramen/udon changed.

After speaking with the owner ( btw she was offended when I asked about the strange taste... what I didn't say is it was actually disgusting!!) she said it was probably the bamboo shoots, she said next time........ ask them not to put the bamboo shoots in..... She gave us no compensation for several large bowl of noodles we could not eat as I took two taste just to give it a chance!!!  So it was a very large bowl left that I NEVER ATE....

When I first ate at this restaurant it was a Monday, mid-day, in the summertime. This place was the only business in the whole mall that actually had more than two tables filled so we decided to try it out. Two of us ordered the kimchi-ramen, and someone else ordered the tuna don with a bowl of ramen. The fish was very high-quality and the ramen noodles were the best, much better than most ramen noodles I've had elsewhere. I enjoyed the meal so much I vowed to come back and eat here again. I constantly thought about returning for years. I did not get the opportunity to do so until now because every other time I have visited Japantown, this place is packed and the wait time is about forty-five minutes (for good reason,) and when you are famished from walking around in the foggy S.F. summers in a big coat, anything quick is good. \nMy father and I were in the city together and decided to have dinner at a restaurant in Japantown around seven on a Saturday night--probably the busiest time of the week for this mall. Every restaurant was filled with lines extending into the halls, but we both decided we needed to have the amazing noodles at Suzu again, no matter the wait. My father ordered the udon and tempura vegetables + shrimp combo, and I ordered the miso broth kimchi nabeyaki with tempura vegetables. I had no idea what nabeyaki was, but I recognized kimchi and udon so I ordered it anyway. It's basically a big hot pot full of chewy, delicious udon noodles topped with tons of vegetables and tofu, and maybe even a hard boiled egg! The kimchi was just right, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I couldn't finish it all (too much food,) but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Especially the egg! I don't like to eat raw eggs at restaurants so the fact that it was hard boiled put me at ease. The tempura vegetables were equally enjoyable (tempura eggplant is my favorite, it was cooked so well.) I will say the barely tea was too weak, but at least it's a healthy and cleanly option as opposed to a soda or alcohol. If you don't think you can last the long wait time, grab a little snack and put your name on the list, it's totally worth it. I don't understand why the wait time is such a bad thing, it's not the restaurant's fault. It's surprisingly quiet for a place with glass walls (the wood frames insulate it well.) It's a cozy, intimate place with good soups and noodles. The portions aren't small either, or perhaps my stomach is just little.

The bowl came filled with green onions, bamboo shoots, baby bok choy and I also added corn.  \nOver all the pork belly with miso bowl was very good. The biggest negatives were that they dashed the top of the bowl (and my spoon) with some sort of salty (msg?) seasoning. The broth didn't need it.

The thing about Suzu that distinguishes it from other ramen shops is that their noodles are the freshest.  I mean Katana-Ya has theirs made fresh daily too, but I think Suzu actually makes them in house...it's that fresh.  Also, their broth is clear and clean.  Yes, I like miso broth or salt broth, but for something different, Suzu really delivers.\n\nHere's a bit of news:\n\nThey used to be closed Monday or Tuesday, but I recently found out that they're open 7-days a week.  They also no longer break between lunch and dinner, which means you can go at 4pm and get ramen while beating the crowds!  Their menu has also changed.  Katana-Ya had their \"Katana-Ya Ramen\" which had pork, fried gyoza, and karaage.  Now, Suzu also has a version called \"Suzu Ramen\"...surprise.

Mr. Suzu sir, you are no Tanpopo.\"\n(Cheers and wild applause ensues.)\nJudy Woodruff: \"Please, please, you are only taking time away from your own ramen house.\"\n\n...but the election was lost at that moment, and Tanpopo defeats Suzu in a landslide. So does Santa Ramen down in San Mateo for that matter. What a shame since I pass by this little noodle house any time I go to the Kabuki and need one of Sophie's Crepes to tie me over until I really have dinner. OK OK, I can be a pig...\n\nWell, Jamie W. and I went here after seeing \"Dan in Real Life\" at the AMC Van Ness (loved it...read my review on Amazon, will ya?). There was a wait of ten minutes or so, which I interpreted to be a good sign that this place was the choice of noodle connoisseurs. As we were seated in front of the clean-up sink, we perused the menu and decided on two ramen bowls, both $8.50. Jamie went for the Kaarage Ramen, which was their standard ramen bowl with a little side bowl of Japanese fried chicken. It became confusing to us whether he was supposed to put it on top of the broth or just eat it separately between slurps. We needed more explicit directions.\n\nI went for the house specialty, the Mabo Ramen, which was a bit more straightforward since it contained the standard broth with tofu cubes and allegedly ground pork bits. I say allegedly because I couldn't make out the bits of pork in the broth. I was also a bit bummed that no attempt was made to separate the ramen noodles from its packaged state. I had to separate them manually by spearing them apart with my chopsticks. On the plus side, mine had a spicy kick that helped considerably.\n\nWe both thought the ramen was rather overpriced given the paucity of ingredients, and the broth was somewhat saltier than I like. Service was on the perfunctory side, but in their defense, they had several tables to serve at the same time. Oh well, it's back to Tanpopo for me...or even more audaciously, getting a frozen package of saimin noodles from the Aloha Warehouse and making it at home.\n\nSuzu: \"That was really uncalled for, Ed U.\" \nEd U: \"You are the one that was making the comparison, Mr. Suzu -- and I'm the one who eats at Tanpopo. And frankly, I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.\"\nSuzu: \"Say what?\"\n\nRAMEN - 3 stars...meh\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice ceramic bowls, nice noodle house vibe, very Shibuya Station-like\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast but kinda by-the-numbers if you ask me\nTOTAL - 3 stars...just barely...marginally disappointed, so I should try other dishes if the mood strikes me again", "author": "Ed U."}

The broth and veggies were nothing to write home about (and in fact, I think I make a better udon soup at home in that regard), but the consistency of their udon is what would bring me back here again. Soft, but with that sort of al dente chew to it that can be called \"QQ\" (in the good/Asian sense).

Of the waitresses that stopped by to take our orders, bring our food, or refill our cups, I think exactly one smiled once.

There were a couple parties already seated so my friend and I decided to give it a try. My mistake.\n\nThe service was kind of slow from the beginning. I ordered the chasu ramen (because it said it came with 3 slices of it!) and so did my friend. Our ramens came out probably 10 minutes later. I took a sip of the soup, stirred my noodles a bit, pulled a bit up with my chopsticks, and saw a hair tangled between the noodles.\n\nI told the waitress and she stared at it closely before bringing it back to the kitchen. Another waitress came back and apologized, asking if I'd like them to remake it. At that point, I didn't even want it but my friend and I were super hungry so I said sure. While I waited for my food, I drank all of my tea. No refills during our visit whatsoever.\n\n10 minutes later my ramen came out. My friend was trying to eat slowly but he was so hungry he couldn't wait for mine to be remade so he was almost done by the time mine came out. About 2 minutes after my ramen came out, the waitress had the nerve to drop the check for our table while I was clearly still eating. The broth was so plain and boring, it tasted like watered down soy sauce. The only plus about it was that the chashu wasn't super fatty like normal places.\n\nBottom line, terrible service. I don't know why some of my Yelp friends liked this place. I'm appalled.", "author": "Valerie T."}

After a 15 minute wait, we were seated and I decided to order the Shio ramen which has sea salt and some pork slices.\n\nThe order came pretty quickly, but at first glance I was already disappointed and craving my own instant noodle ramen I make at home.

Normally, I don't drink much broth when it comes to eating noodles but Suzu makes me finish more than half of the broth. \nThe price for the portions are what I like to call \"normal SF Japantown prices\". If you don't normally eat in Japantown you would consider this as \"expensive\" for the portions. \nService is a bit slow, but I can't blame them when normally I have a big party.

The noodles had no flavor and neither did the broth. it was fucking gross. 15 bucks down the drain. I took maybe 3/4 bites.

I was craving something hot due to the chilly and foggy weather (ie. summer in SF). I had been here a few times before and knew the ramen was standard, so it was an easy decision.\n\nWe didn't have to wait long considering it was a Saturday night (even though the place is pretty tiny). It's located right inside the Japantown mall so I imagine it gets a lot of traffic. My friend and I don't eat pork so we asked if there was a chicken broth available instead. The waitress told us only with the udon. This actually makes no sense to me - if they have chicken broth for the Udon, why can't they use it for ramen? Anyway, we both just gave in and settled for the pork broth. You have to choose a broth flavor as well - soy sauce, miso, or salt. My friend who got the soy said it was a bit bland, but my friend with the miso really liked it. I got the soy as well but I ordered the spicy ramen, so in the end all I could taste was spice! I'll be honest, it was a tad too spicy for me - the noodles were good but there was so much spice I had trouble sipping the broth. It was also an unnaturally bright red color and I ended up doing a napkin bib to avoid staining my shirt! The space can get really stuffy and hot inside, add in the hot tea and hot soup and I was sweating by the end of the meal.\n\nOverall I think this place can be good, but there are a lot of choices and you have to know what to order.", "author": "Lindsey B."}

But compared to other ramen places in Japantown, I have to say Suzu is pretty darn good.  I've tried SapporoYa and some of the ramen at the other \"traditional\" Japanese restaurants in the shopping center, and this is definitely the best of the bunch.  The wait on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm was about 25 minutes.\n\nThe prices are really good for ramen in SF.  Our tea came out immediately after we ordered our food.  Service was fairly attentive, considering we were sitting outside the restaurant on the side by the windows.  I got the Karaage Ramen ($8.95ish?) with the karaage on the side ($.50 extra, WTF?! Is it b/c of the extra dish to wash?) and my sister got the Tempura lunch set (a really good deal at $10.95, lots of food!).  We were both pleasantly surprised at the size of the bowls.  Her vegetable and shrimp tempura came out first, piping hot.  It was a full tempura bowl with sauce drizzled on the pieces on top of rice.  Then my dish of maybe 6 good sized karaage pieces came out (no lemon).  Then our two separate bowls of ramen arrived.  We basically got the same thing, same size, but in different looking bowls.  Mine was flat and wide, while hers was taller and deeper.  Both bowls came with copious amounts of negi, seaweed, bamboo, and half a boiled egg.  Hers also came with a few slices of pork.  \n\nUnfortunately, I was not blown away by the broth, which I think should have been pork based, but mostly just tasted like salt water.  It didn't have any richness or depth to the flavor.  I dumped on the powdered pepper/salt/garlic/onion stuff, but it didn't really help.  I may try the Tokyo Ramen next time, as the picture shows it comes with a deeper looking broth.  I would return here if I were in the mood for ramen while in SF, but there are definitely better places along the Penninsula and in the South Bay.  Santouka is definitely my new fave!", "author": "Leslie H."}

So this time, I opted for the kare katsu don. You really can't go wrong with this dish because it's your basic flavorful curry with don katsu and rice in a bowl. Apparently, since Suzu is known for its ramen, other food items on their menu aren't as great, even though their ramen tastes gross and bland. The curry sauce tasted like crap and the pork cutlet was so hard to chew.

The noodles are great, they have a nice bouncy texture when you chew them. \n\nThe broth however isn't the best. It's not cloudy... and it lacks any sort of depth. I think they also use too much pickled bamboo shoots as well. The egg is hard boiled and not soft boiled, which is unfortunate. The chiashu is very lean and a little on the dry side.\n\nAs for appetizers, the potato croquette is nice due to it's nice crispy outside and creamy center, the vegetable tempura is a good choice as well since it has a variety of items, however the agedashi tofu wasn't too great.\n\nOver all this place is convenient if you're going to the other shops in the konikuniya shopping mall or the movies, but probably not worth making a trip just to try it alone.", "author": "Patrick L."}

Since my last visit, their basic menu is mostly the same, but with additional types of ramen to choose from and more items for their ramen combo meals.  I'm not sure if it's one of the newer additions or if it had always been there, but I noticed that they have a house ramen now (Suzu Ramen) that's very similar to KatanaYa's house ramen - fried potsticker, chicken karaage, roast pork, seaweed, and bamboo (just missing the corn I believe).  Obviously intrigued, I ordered it just to compare, and it was pretty good!  It's not quite as good  as KatanaYa's (they give a choice of spiciness and broth), but it's a solid alternative considering the wait at Suzu is generally shorter for a table, parking is (relatively) easier and cheaper, and at least you're waiting indoors for a table rather than on the street in the cold.\n\nService varies based on who your server is, but it can range from adequate to good.  One server we had wasn't very friendly but did a good job at taking care of our table, while another was really friendly.

Another example of this is how differently you will get treated if you are alone vs. out with a group.

The broth was very salty today too. That plus the wait plus the cost versus what you get and I don't know if I will be back anytime soon. \n\nSo our table got three combos (ramen/soba/udon + a donburi). I specifically asked (since I didn't remember) which ramen the combo comes with; I asked if I can pick any of the ramen flavors. The waitress said I can pick any one of the ones on top;  just not the ones around $12. \n\nSo I ordered one Tokyo ramen and two cha-shu ramen. When the first one came out, I looked at it and I thought it was cha-shu so I gave it too my nephew, than the next two came out and they all look identical. I asked the waitress which one was the Tokyo ramen and she didn't know. Then she said 'oh wait', two of those are tokyo and the other is cha-shu. And I looked carefully and the cha-shu one has two extra pieces of cha-shu. So I asked what's the difference? And where is my egg? I was told that the combo size ramen doesn't come with egg! Which ticks me off (even though this happened last time I ate here but I guess I had a better experience so I didn't remember that part) because nowhere on the menu does it say that. So we tell the waitress we what we really ordered and she was nice enough to bring us several extra pieces of cha-shu. Little did I know that the there is an extra $2 surcharge for this. So the combo costs $13 for a small bowl of ramen and a smaller bowl of donburi plus a $2 surcharge. That's $15 per person. For ramen. Yikes!\n\nWe also ordered two plates of gyoza which definitely wasn't as good as last time. First they came out as soon as I ordered them - which I feared made them not freshly made. My fears were confirmed when they were not crunchy on the bottom at all and they were lukewarm at best.

Everything was really delicious and there was a perfect amount of ramen in each bowl. The ramen had a good, chewy texture and the broth was extremely flavorful - although one could say the Miso ramen was a tad salty but that's the flavor of miso! I enjoyed the hardboiled egg, seaweed, bamboo shoots and pork that was included on the bowl. The chicken curry was also delicious - sweet and savory like most Japanese curries are.

The small rice bowl can be very filling, so don't eat everything. The ramen was really good as well - the broth was clean, hot and not too salty.

So, I sat down, and checked out the menu.\n\nI tried to order Tan Tan Ramen, however, it wasn't on the menu - but they had a similar looking dish, which sounded good, Mabo Ramen (spicy tofu with ground pork ramen).  The waitress and I couldn't understand one another, and her return from my table to the kitchen numerous times, and the conversation she was having with the chef (in English) made it clear she had no idea what I'd ordered.  Finally, a nice guy came out of the kitchen and clarified my order and shortly a large bowl of Mabo Ramen arrived.\n\nI don't think I could have been more disappointed with the food.  First, it wasn't spicy.  I realize I'm white, but I actually wanted something with some heat - no luck.  Second, the noodles were disgusting.  They were clumped together like they'd been laying around all night in the bottom of the pot.  The broth didn't taste good and the Mabo didn't have visible pork located anywhere in it.  AND it cost $12.  Without exaggeration, I could have gone to Nijiya Market, bought the ingredients for Tan Tan, and come out with more cash leftover.  The boiled egg I ordered (for $1) was actually the best part, which earned it the one star depicted above.\n\nThe waitstaff closed the doors at 15 minutes before 9pm, and handed out the bills, explaining they were closing the register, we were welcome to finish eating (thanks!) but we needed to pay now.

There would always be a line massive line to get in here, and I would sit at the table with my dad and enjoy a hearty bowl of ramen, with noodles that they prided as being hand made and the broth flavorful broth and the steaming wafting into my face and some freshly cooked, crispy skinned gyoza.\n\nRecently, I have returned with my father and wanted to relieve a little bit of my childhood.  Initially things were looking promising, there was a little bit of a lunch line and it looked quite busy.  We ate our meal and sadly we left a little disappointed, the bowl of ramen was smaller then I remember and maybe I'm much bigger from back then, but the bigger issue I had was the noodles, they were overcooked, thus eliminating any of the benefits of enjoying hand made noodles.  The gyoza I had was still pretty good, it still had a nice hot filling and a crispy char on the skin.  \n\nNow I'm not sure if maybe my taste buds have matured, or maybe I have been spoiled as newer ramen places have emerged over the years, but considering the price per hour that you are paying to use the associated parking lot, it's hard to justify coming here as there are plenty of alternatives elsewhere that I can go to that are a bit closer, cheaper prices, and no parking fees.

I read some of the reviews for that place and thought to myself, \"What are all these people bitching about? It's just a bowl of ramen.\"\n\nMy, how things have changed. While I've never been to Japan for some real authentic ramen, I've been to a few places in Vancouver, New York, Honolulu, and Southern California that have really opened up my eyes to what good ramen can taste like. RIch broth. Tender cuts of fatty chashu. Al dente hand cut noodles. And all of it has to come together perfectly, the temperature, the toppings, the savoriness, all in one harmonized note.\n\nSuzu provided a similar experience before, but I'm guessing the ownership may have changed. Now they have combo menus much like the new menus at Katana-Ya. Personally, I think it's a crock. You don't need a combo meal with your ramen to make a good meal. You just need good ramen.\n\nAnd to that end, to say that Suzu delivers the best ramen a) in J-Town--would be accurate, b) in the City--would be debatable (we could really use some good Ramen around here), and c) in the Bay Area--keep looking, there is certainly better ramen out there.

To be honest, I've tried several of the ramen choices and combinations here, but I don't think any of them are particularly good. The gold standard that I measure all my ramen experiences to is Santouka Ramen and this place doesn't even come close. The noodles don't have that al dente firmness or chewiness and the meat isn't juicy enough, tender enough, or fatty enough for me. As you can tell, I am extremely picky about my ramen and pretty unforgiving about any perceived flaws. Also, it's pretty obvious, especially for ramen, whether or not quality ingredients were used and you can instantly taste the difference e.g. the soup base richness. I would discourage getting the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen since the portion size is relatively small and not worth it. I really had high hopes for a consistent Japantown ramen joint and even after my initial disappointment, I returned several more times to give this place another chance.

I don't get what the hype is over a restaurant with a grotesque wait over what's effectively Japanese fast food.  This isn't haute cuisine, people.\n\nStopped by there tonight since there were a couple of tables already open.  I had the chashu ramen, my wife had the tokyo ramen (shoyu ramen).  My noodles came out firmer than al dente, and the soup was not hot enough to cook them further.  I have a hard time believing that these guys make their own noodles with how firm and glutenous these were.  There were 6 slices of chashu in my ramen, and the portions and were good so they get at least two stars for that.  However, the pork was overly fatty and overly salty.  The bamboo shoots were bland.  \n\nTotal check for two bowls of ramen & a soda, about $22.50.  12 minutes from order to food on our table.  It's decent, but not worth waiting on the hostess's sign-up list.", "author": "Chris A."}

When it comes to noodles it all boils down (no pun intended) to texture and flavor, and the Suzo ramen noodles failed on both fronts...and were generally just lacking.\n\nAs for the broth, it's \"ok\" (I got the Suza ramen with the stock / base broth). It just wasn't as aromatic and lacked the hearty, meaty, porkiness, that I was hoping for. I did try the miso broth as well which was definitely an upgrade, but shouldn't a good broth be able to stand on it's own?\n\nHowever I will say that most, not all, of the various add-ons to the Suzo ramen are pretty stinking good in particular the chicken karaage which was seriously tasty (juicy, tender, crispy - perfect) as were the fried gyoza.

In addition, we ordered the dumpling appetizers which were homemade as well and if they didn't cost $6 for five tiny ones, I'd recommend them.  Service was rather slow as they had only two waitresses attending to all of the tables, cleaning, and seating guests.\n\nI can not recommend this place.  There are so many better places to eat in Japantown so don't waste your time here unless you like wasting time and eating mediocre, overpriced ramen.", "author": "June P."}

The noodles were good; the broth lacked a little flavor (we had one Tokyo Ramen, one Miso Ramen). Toppings on both were rather paltry.  Service was friendly and prompt.

The overall experience had some issues.\n\nFirst, we showed up near closing time and put our name on the clipboard list after the entry called \"closed\".  (Now I know what they meant--that they were projecting that anybody below the \"closed\" entry would not be guaranteed being served.)  We got in anyway.  \n\nWhile we waited for our ramen, I noticed that the (young) servers were a bit inefficient in their movements. They served someone a wrong bowl, but did not realize it until after the customer picked up a spoon and started to swirl the soup in preparation to take a mouthful.  The server quickly grabbed the bowl and returned it to the kitchen prep.  I watched as the prep staffer changed spoons and rearranged the ramen back into the original presentation--noodles straight and neatly packed into a bundle in the middle of the bowl of broth.  This bowl was then brought back out to the correct table.  The customer snickered, suspecting what really happened in the kitchen, but was probably too hungry from waiting to complain.\n\nThe chefs labored too long preparing a bowl of ramen.  This of course precipitates into harried servers and impatient customers at the tables and wait line.  Perhaps the chefs are trying to achieve \"zen\" in every bowl of ramen.  (hey, it rhymes!)  Whatever... if they sped up their delivery, more people could experience their delicious ramen and they would make more money!\n\nNotwithstanding their operational issues, my char siu ramen was perfectly prepared.  There were six slices of pork and the broth was seasoned just right.  The ramen noodles were straight rather than curly, but done al dente as I like it.\n\nI believe ramen is getting popular, since at least five J-town mall restaurants were offering it in the $9-10 range.  I will have to do a comparison test one of these days.

This is the service business and incredibly bad service to do this.\nIf the food had been amazingly awesome, I might think about going back, but after this...nope.", "author": "Chris I."}

Each time I come, the quality of the ramen noodles continue to get worse and worse. It was my favorite ramen place three years ago so I continue to come hoping that each time it would redeem itself. But each time, I am disappointed by its karaage chicken, which has significant fat attached, as well as its ramen noodles. This past Saturday, it was more of the same mediocrity yet the lines are still as long as ever. Go figure. It may be a shadow of its former self from three years ago, but it still is a decent place for consistently okay ramen. Of the ramen bowls at Suzu, my favorite is the Ma Po Tofu Ramen.", "author": "Rich M."}

If you want sushi or other types of Japanese fare, please, save your reviews for another place that specializes in that. People seem to complain about the line, but hey, lines are there for a reason: this place is good. Opt for a school night, especially in the beginning of the week, and the only lines you'll see will be your chopsticks eagerly awaiting to be used. The several times I've been, I seem to always get the Tokyo Ramen. Although not as good as the top ramen houses in Tokyo, this place is authentic enough, the noodles are supple and not overcooked, the broth is tasty and not too salty, and I always leave happy. Most recently I complimented with a delicate tofu side dish. My main complaint is that they give only one slice of pork chashu in the Tokyo Ramen, where nearby Tampopo gives about four to five pieces. However, the ramen and chashu are a bit more elegant here, so I can deal the quality and lack of quantity. I haven't conjured up the guts yet to slurp freely here, but perhaps one day I'll order a beer and give them the true compliment, slurps and a burp! Enjoy! Itadakimasu!", "author": "Brian J."}

Will update as I continue - hope there's a good item at the end..\n\n10-pt scale rating + descriptors on broth, noodles, bonuses.  I also note wait times and such.  I used to review commercial products, so hopefully this will be standardized.  I will get the most popular item there if I can, otherwise whatever I like.\n\n10/10 is Daikokuya (LA).  Ratings lower than a 5/10 - I won't return.\n\nReviewed so far:\nSuzu Noodle House (SF) - 8.5/10\nRamen Dojo (San Mateo) - 8/10\nMaru Ichi (Mountain View) - 6.5/10\nRyowa (Mountain View) - 3.5/10\nHimawari (san Mateo) - 3/10\n\nTo try:\nTanpopo\nIzakaya Sozai\nSanta Ramen\nRamen Parlor\nOrenchi Ramen\n\nSUZU NOODLE HOUSE (SF) - 8.5/10, Chashu shio Ramen.\nOverall: My favorite ramen in the BA so far.  Traditional ramen shop size, feel, and ramen style.  They also have udon and other stuff I may try later.  I'm told the mapuo ramen is good.  I will be back, many, many times.  I prefer this place over the Dojo so far because I like the traditional ramen more than the crazy Dojo-style... it's not as oily, and I think the noodles are better here.\nBroth: Really deep flavor, a tad oily, but really flavorful.  Seriously, close to Daikokuya level.\nNoodles: Best noodles I've had so far, possibly ever in the US.  \nOther: bamboo shoots, green onions, konbu in generous portions.  Chashu is tasty and not fatty.  I would've liked options to add more stuff, but this was quite good.\nBonus: free green tea\nTips: Expect a 30 minute wait, small ramen shop.  But its indoors in a Japanese mall of sorts.  Don't sit on the patio side unless you like slower service.\n\nRamen Dojo (San Mateo) - 8/10, Garlic pork ramen, mild spicy.\nOverall: Garlic pork ramen, oh my goodness this is good.  This place has a VERY unique style, unique for kuro ramen even.  They specialize in spicy ramen... personally speaking, mild is enough for me, and I have high spice tolerance.  Medium was my limit and was pushing it (about 4/5 at a korean place).  Generous portions, customization, delicious broth, HOT soup... this is worth the wait.  I've been there twice, and probably will go more.\nBroth: REALLY TASTY with a long-lasting flavor.  It's a bit oily, but so good!!  It's kuro ramen, so it's blackish, but don't be put off by that.  IT IS SO GOOD.  And they gives you a LOT.  \nNoodles: Really great texture, generous portions.  \nOther: Comes with bean sprouts, lettuce, chives (great addition btw), quail egg, mushrooms, whole fried garlic.  Chashu among the best I've had in ramen.  There is little fat compared to other places, great texture, great taste.  I highly recommend getting extra chashu for $1.50 (cheap compared to the other additions - which are questionable in price).\nBonus: Great customization options, appetizers are pretty good.\nTips: Be prepared to wait BEFORE they open.  They have exactly 24 seats.  Line up and be one of the first 24 people.  If you're 25th, leave or wait another 30-40 minutes.  I recommend getting there 30 minutes early on a weekday dinner (maybe 20) or 45 minutes early for weekends.  Being #18 is the same as #1 in seating.  They will come out with a clipboard and ask for party size before opening - better have your whole party there.  Also, if you're there late, they can run out of garlic pork broth...\n\nMaru Ichi (Mountain View) - 6.5/10.  Kuro ramen with bamboo shoots.\nOverall: Quite filling with a great portion size.  No real wait if you can find parking.  \nBroth:  Not as tasty as the Dojo but not as oily either.  Pretty flavorful but not the best, but good size and price.  And no wait.\nNoodles: The noodles are a bit thinner than other places.  Texture-wise, they were spot on - chewy, great texture, and definitely good ramen noodles.  \nOther: Bean sprouts, scallions.  Options to add more.\nBonus: Kimchi to snack on while you wait - good quality too.  Free tea.  I like that you can see the dude making the noodles in the window - pretty killer machine he's using.  \nTips: Not much of a wait, this place is huge inside.  Great for quick ramen in MTV area.  I'd go back.\n\nRyowa (Mountain View) 3.5/10 - Tonkatsu ramen with gyoza and rice.\nOverall: Filling portions, not terrible.  Cool decor with Japanese TV shows and ramen bar feel.  $0.50 gets you 3 gyoza and rice.  \nBroth: Watery, not that great.  I wouldn't get this again.\nNoodles: Noodles were great texture, thin\nOther: Gyoza were really quite good, but I don't go to a ramen place for gyoza.  \nBonus: Free kimchi to snack on\nTips: Short to no wait, def get the combo for $0.50 more.  But Maru Ichi is way better.\n\nHimawri (San Mateo) - 3/10.  Miso ramen.\nOverall: Honestly not impressed.  It's not terrible, but for west coast this was not passing.  My bowl had lots of stuff, but eh..\nBroth: not flavorful, watered down\nNoodles: Noodles ok, I can make better\nOther: lots of stuff, forget what\nBonus: empty place, no lines\nTips: It was cheap and fast..", "author": "Jeffrey Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-26", "description": "If there is one thing that we really look for in our favorite ramen houses, and any restaurant, really, it's consistency. Without it, experiences would be dictated by the luck of the draw, and that provides little confidence to diners. I bring up this issue because it seems to be particularly troublesome in recent times for Suzu, unless you count the unfailingly long wait list. So why do I keep coming back? Because on a good day, they are really on top of their game, and I've been willing to take a risk for such a reward.\n\nIn the past 4 years that I have been frequenting Suzu, I have tried nearly every ramen on the menu: the tasty Karaage Ramen, the Mapu Tofu Ramen, and the Spicy Negi Ramen, to name a few.  Today, I am reviewing two bowls of ramen from my recent visit to Suzu: one of their staples, the Tokyo Ramen, and one of their new offerings, the Beef and Vegetable Ramen.\n\nOne thing I noticed right away during this recent visit was the new menu cover. It highlights a new approach Suzu appears to be now taking (perhaps due to pressures from other bay area ramen houses): handmade noodles daily. I was excited to see how Suzu's handmade noodles faired next to Maru Ichi who also makes their noodles in-house. (check my posting on my blog)\n\nThe presentation of the Tokyo Ramen told me that today looked like a \"good day\" for Suzu as the noodles were neatly folded under the other ingredients as opposed to loosely strewn about in the bowl on days when the main chef appears to be taking vacation. Topping the noodles are the chasu, egg, nori, and bamboo shoots. The broth looked light, mostly clear with enough oils floating on top to keep me interested. The Beef and Vegetable Ramen, on the other hand, did not give the most impressive first impression. The light color of the soup seemed to be mostly chicken broth, making me wonder if the broth would have any depth to it at all.  The vegetables included zucchini, cabbage, carrots, and mushroom.  For $1.50 extra, I had customized this ramen with some spicy negi on top to give it a little kick just in case the ramen started getting boring.\n\nOn to the taste test! Despite its nice presentation, a sip of the Tokyo Ramen's broth was enough to realize that the main chef was still missing from the kitchen. It was lukewarm (cardinal ramen sin!), a bit too overpowered by the chicken broth component, and did not have enough depth to keep me interested the whole way through.  The chashu was tender and tasty, but there was only one piece. Compared to other bay area ramen shops, the chasu was also not a standout. The noodles, the only factor that gave real plus points to this bowl, were al dente and had a nice sheen to it.\n\nSurprisingly, the Beef and Vegetable Ramen broth, though not much to look at, had a good flavor and was complex enough for me to enjoy during its entire consumption. Moreover, the broth came out much hotter than the Tokyo Ramen, and I could not taste the overpowering chicken flavor in this one.  The vegetables added a nice element to the ramen because it made me feel like I was eating a healthier ramen, and there were plenty strips of thinly sliced beef in the ramen to make me feel like I got my money's worth.  The handmade noodles were the same texture and appearance as the Tokyo Ramen.\n\nWe know everyone can't look their absolute best every single day. The same goes for a ramen restaurant. While I wouldn't recommend this as one of the best in the bay area, it remains a good pick for San Francisco simply because there are not that many options available on days when the Peninsula or the South Bay seems too far. One can only hope to catch Suzu on a good day because, if they do, I certainly believe they are guaranteed an above average ramen.  For others that aren't willing to roll the dice every time, perhaps it's time to leave Suzu for those ramen lovers willing to take the risk.  Plus, it will shorten the wait list next time I go.", "author": "Ramen S."}

The waitresses and most of the clientele seemed to be Japanese.  When we finally got seated 30 minutes later, we each ordered a ramen and decided to share a sashimi platter.  The sashimi was 4 pieces of tuna and 4 pieces of salmon and although small, were super fresh and fantastic!  I got the spicy ramen and it was definitely spicier than most Japanese versions of spicy soup which I loved so it was perfect.  Ended up only costing like $15 per person so well worth it.  I liked it so much that I made the hubby take me back here for dinner!  Sadly, I got the exact same thing because I was already craving it again.\n\nUpdate:  last week when I was at a movie at the kabuki theatre, I called the restaurant afterwards to see if they were still open.  Nobody picked up so I assumed they were closed and we spent another 15 minutes deciding where to go.  We happened to walk by on our way to the other restaurant and peered in to see people eating there so we ran in.  The waitress told us that we were too late since it was 9:27 and they close at 9:30.  Jeez I was annoyed!  Pick up the phone and we would have been there on time!  Anyways, one thing to note was even on a Thursday night when they were about to close, they were pretty full.

We didn't mind, since we could walk around the mall and stuff. We went back to check about 20 mins later and saw that we were next!\n\nAfter we were seated, we were pretty much set to order since we've been eyeing the menu from the window. I got the Mapo Tofu Ramen combo, bf got the unagi roll ramen combo. I opted for the spicy soup and added a boiled egg for an extra $1 each. Bf kept his traditional. We also ordered the edamame, which came with salt added on the top. That, I wasn't too big a of a fan for. The unagi rolls came and they were very fresh and tasty. My mapo tofu came in a little bowl with rice. I was a little shocked since I was hoping the tofu and stuff came in my ramen...yeah I don't know why I thought that. But, o wells, it was still good, I'm just not a fan of white rice. \n\nThe ramen finally arrived and I had to taste the soup first. It was very good, not too salty and enough spice to kick you in the mouth! I, of course needed MORE SPICE, so I added that spicy ramen flake stuff they have on the side of your tables. I added ALOT. It made my ramen more exciting to eat! The noodles had a perfect texture. It was chewy and not super soft, I like them with a little bit of \"raw-ness\".

The staff will hide in the kitchen until the last possible moment, and only run food out when it's getting cold. (i have had lukewarm soup and gyoza...)\n3. With at least 5 names on the list, clearing the tables and moving customers in and out doesn't seem to be a priority, I have watched tables sit with bowls for over 11:00 minutes.

I own a business that depends on service, and the staff at Suzu would not last a week with my staff.\n5. If  you think service is slow inside the main dining room, just wait and enjoy the special joy that is being completely ignored sitting in the outside tables.  \n\nOkay, so that's it. But lastly, a note to the owner: \n\n I see that you care as much for your  customers as much as you care for your ramen.  You have a gift.  But please make it more fun for your people to work there, or help them find some sort of happiness while they work there.

Suzu comes really close to the ramen I had in Tokyo,  nice aldente ramen noodle, just the right amount of broth flavor to each bowl and just right amount of meat and veggies to fill you up.  I eaten almost everything on the menu and to date my favorite has been the mabo ramen,  just the right amount of heat and great spicy broth.  The other thing I don't ever pass up here is their agedashi (fried tofu).  They are probably the best agedashi I had here in SF.    \n\nService can be spotty at times but for the most part it is nice enough but I mainly come here for the ramen and willing to deal with spotty service.

At approximately 2 pm, there was one table for four available, and we took it.  \n\nNow, keep in mind that my friend W is  the one who I have repeatedly claimed has no taste buds.  He eats virtually anything, and if it's food, he'll consider it to be anywhere from \"decent\" to \"good\".   A taste of the most wonderful thing - and he'd nod and simply comment, \"Yeah, it's alright.\"  Give him a taste of something awful, and he'd nod his head and state, \"I like it fine.\" \nLike I've said, when we're on our way to a new restaurant that I heard about, and he says it's really good there, I usually have an overwhelming urge to screech into a U-turn.\n\nThat said, I am not the quickest cookie in the jar, and on this afternoon, not having a specific craving for anything, I let him pick.  It was only at the entrance that it struck me - -  I did it again, I let him pick the restaurant.  \n\nWhen will I ever LEARN?\n\nWell, folks, even a broken clock is right twice a day.\nSuffice to say, I was quite pleased w/ Suzu.\n\nWe ordered two bowls of \"spicy scallion\" ramen and he suggested that we request EXTRA PORK.  We also ordered a plate of Gyoza.\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the Gyoza - it was just typical, but the ramen was actually really good!\n\nFirst, the extra pork slices were not just tender but extremely flavorful.  I'd definitely recommend requesting extra to almost any of the ramens available here.  The scallions were not super-spicy, but notably spicy enough to make a difference.  For Koreans, it was the taste of \"Pa-Kimchi\", laid atop your noodles.  The noodles were cooked nicely, and the broth, while still a bit on the oily side, was outstanding.  The only ding, perhaps, was the size.  For a bowl of ramen, it was on the smaller side, at least compared to some other joints.\n\nOur ramen was $8 each, give or take some cents - and it was well worth the price - and while I don't know how much the extra pork or gyoza cost, the total bill came to $27 or so by the time tip was included.\n\nIn my eternal quest of a good bowl of ramen in San Francisco - - Suzu rates up there for the moment.

Yesterday our order consisted of two different ramen bowls and an order of tenpura.\n\nAll the food was fantastic: The ramen was perfectly done, with just the right amount of bite to the noodles, and the tenpura we ordered was cooked exceptionally well.  I notice quite a few reviewers complaining that the broth doesn't have enough punch, but I appreciated the fact that the broth was very clean and light, with clear, wakame-hued flavors -- not the usual salt-fest most ramen-ya fill your bowl with.\n\nThe portions were a bit smaller than for the same dishes at Sapporo-ya upstairs, but they were also more than a couple of dollars cheaper and the execution of the dishes were several notches better.  This is the first Japanese place in a while that I've been to where even the tenpura impressed me; whoever's cooking in the back is doing a fantastic job.\n\n(Why I'm not giving five stars: They were a bit stingy with my dining companion's ramen, giving him only one tiny slice of chashu.  I appreciate a place that gives proper portions and doesn't supersize everything, but this was just plain stingy.  Also, we had barely finished the last of our ramen when the waitresses descended, quickly began snatching away all our dishes, and robotically intoned \"thankyouokaythankyoubyebye\" before we could even blink.  It's a small space with people waiting outside and so I know they want prompt turnover, but it was a bit much.  If you want to linger in the restaurant, eat slowly.)\n\nOverall I'm definitely happy with this place and will be going back for sure.", "author": "James L."}

Nowhere in the restaurant had it said that parties of 5 or more had to pay 18% of gratitude. The 18% of gratitude was added onto the grand total, which made the total $89.72 instead of $76.04 (before tips). In the state of California only with parties of 6 or more is a 18% gratitude asked. We only had a party of 5. The server gave us no choice but to pay the gratitude along with our total before tips.

In fact, I will not be able to recommend this little joint anymore because it is very clear that they do not value their loyal customers.\n\nLonger story if you're interested..I have a gluten allergy and had been advised (for a year of going to Suzu) that I could sub in soba noodles and enjoy the ramen broth. This worked out nicely because I am not able to eat the fish sauce that the soba noodles come with, and actually like the ramen broth better anyway. They were always so kind about it and made me feel like it was no problem to make the change. The last time I went in (a week ago) I was informed that they would no longer make any substitutions, regardless of food allergy. I gently asked to speak to the manager, just to see if we could strike a deal, and they came back to the table to say that they would make an exception \"this one time, but never again\". So, I got set to have the last bowl of soba ramen at Suzu, when another waitress came out to say that the owner's wife disagreed with her husband's response and they would not make an exception and would not serve me what I'd ordered. \n\nThis in itself was a poor experience, but the waitress proceeded to tell us all about the owners and how they always disagree on things, and were particularly cranky on this day - all of which did not make me feel any better. She told me that the way I ate the soba noodles with ramen broth was actually wrong and didn't taste good, and then accused that I probably didn't care about Japanese custom (which I do! I just CAN'T eat gluten). She then said she'd be more than happy if we decided to leave, which we did. Its was the most blatant disregard for a gluten allergy that I have seen in SF, or anywhere I've ever traveled (even outside the US!). Not going back.", "author": "Rachael S."}

We picked Suzu because we'd both never been there, and we were both in a ramen mood.\n\nTheir dinner specials are a LOT of food - a hefty bowl of ramen (only a bit smaller than the regular bowls) plus something with rice and a choice of unagi, tuna sashimi, etc.  I ordered the maguro don combo, which was the fish, rice, and ramen (not.. combined in a bowl).  My friend ordered their Tokyo ramen, going off the theory that the first listing is usually their \"signature\" dish.\n\nThe ramen was pretty good - not as good as Tanpopo, but for the price (a meal around $20) + both of us really full = a good place to go back.", "author": "Tori S."}

We walked up to her, but the waitress, instead of guiding us to our seat, just looked at us, turned, and walked back inside and all the way into the kitchen. My boyfriend and I weren't even sure if we were supposed to follow her in or what!\n\nAfter awkwardly standing around in the middle of the dining area for a minute or two, the waitress came back out so I asked her where we were supposed to be seated. She gave me a suspicious look, like she thought I was trying to cut in line or something. \"Are you James?\" she asked me. I pointed to my bf. She nodded curtly towards one of the tables, so we sat.\n\nThe same waitress then went outside again, brought another party in to be seated, handed them menus, brought them water and began taking their order... all before she'd even bothered to give my bf and me OUR menus! wtf! I ended up having to grab our own menus, since it was so difficult to get that dumb waitress's attention. \n\nOnce my bf and I were ready to order, we once again had trouble getting our waitress's attention. She returned to the other party several more times as they added more food to their original order (twice!), and still we couldn't even get a glass of water or anything. By this time, I was trying to decide what would be more insulting to them--if we walked out, or if we stayed but left a $0 tip. \n\nI was beginning to lean towards the latter, when another waitress noticed us getting impatient and rushed over, apologetically thanking us for our patience. After that, I noticed this new waitress took some pains to give us proper attention, probably to make up for her associate's neglect, so I decided to forget the whole no-tip thing and enjoy the meal.\n\nWhich I very much did! I ordered the karaage curry, and my bf had the shio ramen. Both excellent. \n\nI liked that the karaage was very obviously homemade--and very hot and crispy too!--not like the frozen storebought kind that Shabu-sen peddles for a 200% markup. The chicken pieces were big too. One of them was as big as my hand. The portion size on the curry was good too. Combined with the salad and soup that came as part of the meal set, I couldn't even finish 2/3 of it. And my bf enjoyed his ramen. =) \n\nIf there didn't always seem to be a line for this place, I'd definitely prefer this place over Sapporo-ya, for the karaage curry alone.

We ventured in because it was abnormally hot day and the rest of the complex with stuffy and unventilated.\n\nFirst off, service was extremely slow.  How long does it take to cook two bowls of ramen?  \n\nWhat is even more shocking is when you see the contents of the bowls of ramen.  We had one order of the Shio Ramen where there was 1 tiny slice of pork, half an egg, half of a bok choy, and a few pieces of bamboo shoots.  The other order was for the Karaage Ramen which came with 3 pieces of chicken that were soggy despite being in a separate bowl and it also had the fried fatty parts that i wouldn't even feed to a dog.  Seriously though, how much does the other half of an egg or bok choy leaf cost? They can't spare enough to put in another piece of pork or chicken?  I seriously doubt the noodles cost a lot to produce....\n\nI also noticed how many people have raved about the ramen.  Well our noodles came out all clumpy making it very obvious that it was not fresh.  The msg soup was also SO salty that I suffered from thirst for quite a while after I had the meal. I usually prefer the cloudy, natural broths.\n\nWhen we finished the meal, i also felt the feeling of being rushed out.  I barely even had the chance to put my chopsticks down and the waitress was already clearing my bowls away. \n\nOne little side note, we noticed there was a sink in the corner of the dining room.  It seemed very out of place being out in the open so close to a dining table.... but yes... this will be our first and only visit.

We passed by this \"noodle house\" because it was cheap and empty. We both ordered this iron pot dish with udon and fish cake galore. The picture in the menu was so enticing. But the flavor was not so much. Aside from the noodles being incredibly overcooked (seemed like those cheap packets of udon you can buy for $0.50 cents), there was this one fish cake with a gooey white inside that reminded me of a man's orgasm wrapped with tofu skin. It coated my mouth in a very unsatisfactory manner. Not even semi-luke warm tea could wash it away. Sure, the iron pot dish offered a variety of fish cakes but that was all it offered. \n\nNow to the worst dish of all. I ordered some \"steamed shrimp dumplings\" and instead got store bought and over cooked chewy dime sized dumplings.

They charged you $6.00 for 5 little tiny dumplings.\n\nI won't go into the terrible service because the food says it all.\n\nAfter we sat down and started eating, we noticed a huge line outside.

However, it remains 3 stars, for many reasons.\n\n1) I went there around 12:30, on a weekday and I had to wait almost 25 minutes.  There were 2 girls waiting the tables, and somehow, considering how small this place is, they seemed to be overwhelmed and having a hard time keeping up with the turnover of the tables.\n\n2) There were many party of 1s and 2s... however they would seat a party of 2 on a 4 ppl table and would not ask or offer to share the table with another couple.  It's a pretty common thing to do in many small and busy eateries, but not here... you gotta wait in frustration as you stare at the old ladies chatting and sitting there 20 minutes after they finished eating.\n\n3) I accidentally left my cell phone on the windowsill of one of their \"outside\" tables.  I noticed and headed right back, and asked one of the waitresses if they've seen it.  She goes \"what kind? Oh, no, sorry\" without checking with the other girl, the table I was at, or in the back.  I looked around myself, emptied my purse to confirm I didn't have it, and went over to her again so I can at least leave my contact info in case they found it.  The other waitress overhears this and she goes, \"oh, cell phone?\" and pulls my phone right out of their security/lost and found box.  You'd think the other girl could've been nicer and at least followed protocols and check in that box? Duhhh.\n\n4) I ordered ramen & tuna bowl combo lunch.  When I ordered, I asked the waitress if the rice for tuna bowl was seasoned or not.  She said that she thinks that they use seasoned rice for tuna bowl... which is why I ordered this set.  WRONG!  Ramen was pretty good, but tuna bowl was a tiny bowl of steamed, somewhat mashed up rice (NOT seasoned/sushi rice) with pieces of tuna (and they had the stringy part of the fish) with soy/mirin \"sauce\" drizzled on it.  \n\nNow, as a Japanese, I have some pet peeves about the way they serve these tuna bowls.  Plain steamed rice is sometimes used... but mostly when we make them at home in busy households when they don't feel like seasoning it or don't have the time to.  If you get good tekka-don at good restaurants, the rice is seasoned.  Just like sushi.  Even if it's not seasoned, we Japanese (at least Japanese from Japan) are really anal about the quality of rice.  It needs to be not too hard, not too soft, and we should be able to see each grain of rice  all shiny and perked up in the bowl.  So when I get a bowl of rice with some mashed up parts, it makes me cringe... because it means that they either do not understand the nature of rice, do not respect or take pride in what they are presenting, or, they do not know how to fluff the rice properly once they're steamed.\n\nThen, the whole pieces of tuna with sauce on top thing... in my book, tekka don is made of soy/mirin marinaded tuna called \"zuke\".  Literally means \"to soak\".  Tuna is supposed to sit in the marinade for a bit so they have good saltiness of the soy sauce and sweetness of mirin infused in the fish before they put them over rice.  Marinade for a couple of hours would be great, but even 30 minutes will really make a difference.  So when I got pieces of tuna with some \"sauce\" on top, it felt lazy to me.  Also the tuna pieces... You know how there are yummy, perfect textured tuna that's all red, and then occasionally, there are those that have more stringy/fibrous look?  Well, this on was the latter.  When I shop for tuna, I specifically look for ones that don't have these white striped look, as they can often be chewy and not as good as the consistent looking ones. I only care to buy the striped looking ones if I was gonna cook it, i.e. a tuna steak.  So having this quality of tuna served raw up in a bowl was a no-no for me.\n\nIn short, I will come back here if I am in J-town, craving ramen, and willing to wait a long time for it.  But I will not recommend getting their dons involving raw fish... and if I weren't in J-town, I would be going to Katana-ya in downtown instead and would not bother coming to J-town just for the food at Suzu.", "author": "Sascha O."}

He ordered the Buttered Corn Ramen. I don't even have to say anything about that. Just look at all the other past reviews & you'll see what all the hype is about. Buttered Corn Ramen. Just the name sounds delicious. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which is the one with the creamy broth. This was super tasty. Comparable to Shin Sen Gumi (which i love!). The serving was a good size, too. Alongside our ramen, the gent suggested the Mabo Tofu Donburi. I've never had this before, but I am so glad I did. I love spicy food, so this really hit the spot. It's basically spicy tofu w/ minced pork in chili sauce served over rice. Agh! I could really go for some of that right now.", "author": "Krystal A."}

You ran out of beef... didn't know that would be possible given that it is one of the main toppings offered.  The bamboo shoots... someone tell me that I'm wrong because I swear the bamboo shoots looked rather rotten... black?!?!  And there was a horrid stench.

I'm sure that's enough to have you skip over my review but ya know, whatever.\n\nRamen-fest 2008 kicked off here before forging its way down to the South Bay but that's a whole other story, so just follow along.\n\nSuzu is the only ramen place that I've eaten at in San Francisco. I know, I know, how does this qualify as Ramen-fest then? The fest is still in continuation, that's how.\n\nANYWAY, Suzu's strongest point are their noodles. They're thick, fresh, and lovely to eat. I believe they're homemade and it shows. Perfectly cooked and not mushy. Nice and hearty. Some of the best ramen noodles I've ever tasted. 9 points. \n\nThe broth is definitely their weak link but it's not bad. At least it has some flavor and is pleasant to put in my mouth from a spoon filled with noodles and seaweed (also known as an \"ultimate bite\"). 7 points.\n\nThe meat is delicious but perhaps because the economy is bad, they now only give you one skimpy piece. ONE! What a joke. So sad.\n\nExtras... The gyoza is ok, nothing particularly spectacular. Same goes for the karaage. Small portions.\n\nValue... I LOVE the combinations! You get a small bowl of goodness (usually rice / sashimi or katsu) plus a bowl of regular ramen! Only $1 extra to sub any of the other ramens. Good deal, in my opinion. I am always filled to the max. Although, I should mention they used to give you a FULL bowl of ramen, now it's just slightly smaller. Probably a good thing for me. As if I need any more carbs.\n\nThe service is decent and the ladies are nice. A little bit slow and forgetful at times but always friendly.

Not many places still take the effort to hand make this stuff anymore.  Most manju is usually imported from out of the country or made in factories with funky preservatives and chemicals to extend shelf-life (nasty).  On a tangent, one of the few places in SF still hand-making manju is Benkyodo (also in J-town).  As much as I like Benkyodo now, I never used to visit it very often because my loyalties always went to the mochi nazi.\n\nShe was an ancient Japanese lady who ran a manju shop where Suzu sits currently.  I would describe her as 4-foot nuthin', aged somewhere between 90 and 120, and all business.  Usually wifey and I would walk into her shop an order very quickly before that stone-cold glare would penetrate our skulls.  Typically, we'd have no idea what we ordered because we didn't want to dilly-dally in her presence and suffer her wrath.  She'd carefully hand-wrap our morsels in a plain cardboard box and send us off before we bothered the others in line.\n\nI miss that dear nazi!!\n\nWhat? Oh yeah, Suzu.\nWent here a few months ago and then again recently.  They have a spicy tofu ramen on the menu and that combo always gets my juices going.  My first impression of Suzu was okay, that's why I came again to confirm.\nNoodle consistency and quality is good.  Broth is a bit of a disappointment though.  Too salty and lacks complexity.  Their spicy tofu ramen is much too oily, a few slurps and my cholesterol shot up 30 points...\n\nIn short, Suzu might have scored higher if they hadn't displaced my beloved mochi nazi.\nYou heartless bastards!!!!!!", "author": "Gracie-C Y."}

Not  being overly fond of ramen in the first place, a little adventurousness on a seemingly unadventurous day does go a long way....\n\nI had a ramen revelation -  the noodles were fresh and al dente-ish; the broth (I'd chosen miso) was delectable, complex and had different layers of flavor. The juicy slice of pork had a flavor distinct from that of the broth - it was so good that I ordered more pork (5 slices for $2) to have with my soup. I kept on lapping up the broth till there was none... but all yummy things must come to an end. I was tempted to ask for more but my sense of propriety held, even under such circumstances.\n\nWith my ramen I had tendon - tempura over rice - which was delightful. Perfectly crisp (for my fondness for fried food: see review of Ocean) pieces of shrimp and vegetables lightly slathered with a thick sweet soy sauce. Perfect counterpoint to the liquid goodness of the ramen.\n\nI've since gone back two more times and each experience was just as tasty and satisfying as the first. The Chicken Kara-age (side of crisp and juicy chicken morsels and not served over rice)/ramen combo is great if you want to put the brakes on the carb intake; a companion had unagi over rice with hers (loved it - and this coming from an unagi fiend). The price for this ramen with side/over-rice combination? $8.95, or $9.95 if you opt for the miso broth  (otherwise they serve it with shoyu-based broth).  I suggest the miso upgrade with the extra pork (which you can share) for $2. \n\nThe gals running the place are very warm - if not wholly efficient  - and are always willing to explain the selections on offer. Again, maybe it's just me, but I don't expect a whole lot on this front from a mom-and-pop establishment, just as long as they're generally warm and if the food's good.\n\nNote: I've been salivating the entire time I was writing this.

The food was OK. Not the worst and certainly not the best ramen I've had (I have Ippudo in NYC). I ordered the char-shiu ramen with a tiny bowl of katsu-don. I got a LOT of noodles, and enough pork to satisfy me. The pork was a bit too salty (and trust me, I love salt). The broth wasn't as rich as I would have liked.

It was surprisingly great ramen, and I finished the whole bowl, including all of the broth - perfect size.  They forgot the additional chashu - right when the bowl arrived, I swirled my chopsticks in it to count the pieces of pork and alerted the waitress when there was only the default 2 pieces.  She apologized and quickly brought me the 3 extra pieces on a plate.  I wish the egg was medium boiled instead of hard boiled, but all of the ramen joints in the bay area that I've been to like to use a hard boiled egg.  The tempura don wasn't that great...it came with the sticky sweet sauce poured on it.  I'm used to being able to dip my tempura vegetables in sauce, so that I can control how much I use.  Also, the rice didn't taste that great.  If I go back, I'll still probably get the miso ramen by itself with kakuni for an appetizer.

Tempura was beautiful, almost text book looking picture perfect. The komoro (batter) was light, fluffy, and retained its crunch even after sometime.\n\nWhy do I speak so highly of the place and only give it two stars? I go back and the tempura was not the same.

We tried one zaru soba with tempura, and one of their ramen.\n\nSoba was a little on the cold side, not done \"al dente\" like good fresh pasta. In fact Mifune upstairs does much better soba (they probably use dry packets to start as well). Fresh soba is out of this world, especially if made in house from scratch (Yabusoba in Waikiki did this but they closed, but according to Dan V there is a new business in that location that does the same thing). But we don't have that luxury of FRESHLY made soba here. All we can hope is that some competent chef takes the dry packet, boils the water and cooks the soba for long enough time, and here's the next important step...take the noodles and dunk it in cold water or a mix of mostly ice and some water, then DRAIN that water away. There may be other steps but these are the bare minimum to get the soba to have a bouncy texture towards the teeth. Timing is also critical. Miss any of these steps and you have ugly brown noodles that don't taste good.\n\nThe worst was the ramen. It had some weird ammonia taste to it, like a cheap bowl of Hong Kong style won ton egg noodle soup off the streets (those usually have some ammonia taste to it too), and to top it off that bowl of ramen costs more than won ton noodle soup!!!\nI bet I got charged extra for the Windex solution they poured in. \n\nThis place would fail the Japanese department store basement food quality test, in Japan, Hong Kong or Taiwan.

I passed by several times but never gave it a try.....until last week.  I was not disappointed at all.  I ordered the beloved spicy negi ramen.  It's a little smaller than other ramen, and i wasn't very impressed by the soup base; but texture of ramen is VERY good, and it was VERY fresh. I also tried the cha-shu ramen, and that was delicious!  It has a LOT of tasty cha-shu, and yummy ramen in a bigger bowl, and the soup base is very good.  I find bay area people tend to consider Santa ramen has the best ramen, but during our trip in Japan, we found out fatty soup base is not determination of good ramen.  The best ramen i went to in Tokyo in 2008 was seafood based.  Suzu make all their noodles fresh daily.  If you consider yourself as a hardcore ramen fan, you should give Suzu a try.", "author": "Sophia L."}

The staff is very friendly and is knowledgable as far as helping me to sort out the menu.  It is not that it is that complicated, just new to me.  The key is that the Ramen noodles are house made and are excellent.  I highly receommend the spicy broth - it is rich and peppery but does not overpower the other flavors.    I have not tried nearly enough on the menu, but have enjoyed the things I have had.  The BIG surpsie is how excellent the little bit of sushi they offer is.  This is not a sushi restaurant - and yet the tuna roll is outstanding!!  Get the dinner combo with noodles and a roll and enjoy.  Also the time spent waiting allows for a trip to the funny Manga bookstore on the same floor.", "author": "Bill G."}

It was 4 of us having fun, walking around. Eventually we did get hungry and went in kintetsu mall to see where we should eat. Most of the restaurant were packed and we went downstairs and waited at Suzu's. None of us went there before but the food looked good.\n\nWe were starving so the wait seemed like forever but probably was only 10-15 minutes. We were seated, gotten our menu, and the waitress gave us water. Suzu is best for couples/dates, not really groups. For Suzu, the max you should have in your group is 4, that's how many there biggest table can fit. The waitresses are nice, not grumpy or very impatient.\nNever had Japanese food before so I didn't know what to get and just thought I'd wait to get crepe.\n\n1. My girlfriend ordered Karage ramen, which was ramen in a miso broth(?), and it had fried chicken in it. My girlfriend liked it and said it was good. It was only $9.50(?)\n2. My friend ordered (I think) spicy ramen. It was a big bowl, looked spicy, however she said it wasn't spicy at all. We each took a bit and 1 of my friend said it was, but me and my girlfriend said it wasn't spicy at all. There's a kick but it wasn't spicy. A disappointment. $???\n3. My other friend ordered Udon with unagi over rice. She got a bowl of udon in a reasonable size bowl that does fill you up. She also got a nice small bowl of unagi over rice. She liked her meal. $10.50\n4. I saw my friend get the udon and realized I wanted the same except karage over rice. In my opinion, I like there udon the best here at Suzu's. The fried karage over rice I like a lot. The sauce they used was really good. $10.50\n+ 2 sodas (soda i think is $1.50 (?))\n\nTotal + tax =about $50\n\nI come back.

The wait for lunch is loooong...so don't go here if you are in a hurry. Here's how to handle the wait. Put down your name on the list and then wander around in the Japan center, browse through the antique shops (if you break, you buy) and the bookstore and the flower shop next door. And then when you get back to waiting outside the restaurant because you are scared they will have called your name already, spend another 20 minutes staring at the people eating inside trying to get them to leave. And then, your turn finally arrives and you get seated in the small space. By this time, you have read the menu posted outside 5 times already and have decided what you want and changed your mind 4 times as well. So you are ready to order as soon as they bring your hot tea. I got the ramen and the mabo don combo - the food is definitely good. I spent a lot of time perfecting my ramen eating technique, sneaking looks at more experienced veterans and using my chopsticks and soup spoon to get the right ratio of noodle and soup into each mouthful.

Well, it's hard to be positive on a restaurant that consistently closes upon their discretion and without communication of that decision to people waiting in line.  Many other posters have commented that Suzu consistently has a line but what most do not mention is Suzu's arbitrary cut off times when they decide they don't want to do anymore business but don't tell the people waiting.  The simply write something on the list and if you're unlucky enough to put your name down below someone else who didn't notice it, well then too bad for you.  Bottom line is that they have don't seem to have any interest in honoring the opening times they post on their door.\n\nThis has happened twice where, like idiots, we arrived 30-60 mins before the designated closing time only to wait for 5-10 mins with our name on the list before they had the \"courtesy\" to brush us off and tell us they were closed -- including 8:30 on a Friday night!\n\nThe catch here is that the ramen is very good but the service is generally very slow and unfriendly - as if you're intruding on them to be there.

But I guess I chose a bad night to come back. The person who does the seating had our group of three squeeze into a two person table since they had a four person group coming in but when that group didn't show  I asked if we could move to that table the hostess said they had already seated the next group. Okay that was fine. But then when another 4 person group didn't show and the next was a group of two and the host seated them at that table it was just the last straw. And when someone from our group asked the hostess a second time she refused us again! And who do you think had the heart to help us out? The group of two who they seated at the 4 person table overheard my friend talking to the hostess and they told the host that they would be happy to exchange with our group. (whoever those two girls are, thank you thank you very much! You are angels that made a bad night and a bad mood turn around! Peace and love to you!) And then not even a hint of an apology from the hostess. I have to be fair though Suzu's food is top rate it's just the horrible customer service that ruined the whole dining experience. It will definitely be a long while or when that hostess is not on duty until I try Suzu or even recommend it to anyone.

Our search had not been fruitful, and we found the worst at Suzu. \nWe judge ramen according to several criteria: broth, noodle, cha-shu, garnishes and overall balance. \nWe ordered 2 bowls of Cha-shu ramen (which was the closest thing to a shoyu ramen) and 1 bowl of shio ramen. The first sip of our respective broths showed promise, but I know something was wrong. It seemed the broth was very very well seasoned, which was an indication of whatever you were eating would turn out to be too salty in the end. It turned out the problem was not the broth but the cha-shu. The meat slices were super salty; so salty that they made everything else salty. Forget about other criteria, the saltiness was bad enough to ruin everything! Now here is our problem with the service. Never once did the servers come by the check on the tables. Never once did the servers do anything when I told them about the food was overly salty. I am not the type that will find a flaw in a meal, complain about it and except to be comped. This is not my style, but I DO expect some sort of, \"dude, we are sorry, we screwed up.\" Maybe I am just sick of poorly ran restaurants where the managements are nonchalant about complaints, and servers are afraid to apologize for the kitchen. But worst of all I had to continue my search for the next best ramen house. \nBy the way, two of us ran to the bathroom about 8 hours after our meal and nothing solid came out, which is a sign of at least a mild case of food poising, and the only person did not run to the restroom had not touched the cha-shu.", "author": "Marco C."}

We got there at 4pm so we had an hour before they would reopen for dinner. We walked around Japantown and came back around 5pm. There were a few empty tables so we got to sit right away. There was the option to sit outside but we decided to sit inside. We waitress was quick to take our order and the food came pretty quickly too. The ramen on the menu pretty much comes with pork and a choice of a side dish. I thought that was pretty neat since no other place that I know of does that. My friend highly recommended the potato croquettes so we ordered that and shared a tempera pork ramen ($10 something). The potato croquettes were pretty good but not amazing. I noticed the ramen only came with one slice of pork. Just one and a thin one at that! Come on...and the broth was not too good either. What determines a good bowl of ramen is mainly the broth and this place did not cut it. I was disappointed. Take your business to Tanpopo instead. I also realized later that they did not offer any broth options - salt, soy sauce, miso, etc. So that's another thing I did not like.", "author": "Helen L."}

(The only other miso ramen we crave is at Miso-ya in front of Nagano station in Japan using Shinshu miso.) \n\nThe tempura in the donburi has a good variety of veggies,plus shrimp for such a small bowl, and a drizzle of their signature sauce rather than the traditional broth, which we like, though a tad too salty.

I go for the basic Tokyo ramen.  I'm no nonsense about ramen.  After all, ramen is all about the noodles.

Whenever we are in the mood for ramen, this is the place for us.  We just moved from NYC where there is arguably some of the best ramen in the country and this place stacks up nicely without some of the hullabaloo that is involved with the popular ramen joints in NYC (I'm talking to you Ippudo).  Although there is usually a wait, it is worth it and usually not more than 20 minutes.", "author": "bill l."}

No more of that 10 cent instant MSG rush in a little plastic bag that comes with bits of noodle chips.  This place has the best ramen ever!  Even Naruto would love this place!  It also won't dent his frog wallet much either.  The ramen is about 7.50-9 bucks.  I got the spicy Negi ramen (which wasn't spicy at all).  Ya that's right, they have a ramen that sounds like Neji... the naruto character.  This place is pretty tiny and it barely sits 20 people or so.  My friend suggested giving this place 1 star to prevent people from coming here....but I can't.  This place deserves 5 stars hands down.  The brooth and their noodles were spectacular.  I liked this place much better than Kitana Ya in downtown Geary.", "author": "Nelson W."}

If you find yourself in Japan Town and wanting a bowl of Ramen, this is the place.  The Ramen texture is chewy and the broth is yummy.  My husband tried the Udon and like it as well.  The menu is limited but I think they added on a little more variety now of the way you can order your Ramen or Udon.  The wait is often very long and service could be slow at time.

The tempura was pretty good.  Nice, crisp veggies, nothing to complain about there.  The unagi was pretty standard, was not disappointed with that either.  My ramen noodles were pretty good.  They had that certain chewiness that I feel really distinguishes well-made ramen.  It could have been a little bit firmer, but I should have asked the waitress for that.  The broth was a little bit disappointing.  It lacked complexity.  I can't even remember what else was served with the ramen.  All I remember about it was the noodles.  The cold udon was probably my favorite thing there.  It was chewy and firm and the dipping sauce was simple and delicious.  I would definitely come back for the noodles, but maybe try a different kind of broth for ramen (like maybe miso instead of shio) or just go straight for the really simple stuff that focuses mainly on the noodles.", "author": "Linh N."}

But since they have been good to me, I am giving them five stars.  They're always friendly and conversational, and they always remember me and what my dad wants, though I guess it would be hard not to, since we go there almost twice a week.  My favorites: vegetarian udon (I get that in ramen form, though), salmon sashimi, salmon don, vegetable tempura, unagi don, and their ramen--all y'all who don't like their ramen are CRAZY.  This is the only ramen in town I'll eat (though someone mentioned that there was egg in their noodles, so that would explain everything since i am an egg lover).  It's nice and al dente, and I love the soup (my dad says it tastes bitter, though, and prefers Sapporo-Ya upstairs).  I often get it as part of their lunch combo (some kind of rice bowl + ramen) because it's so cheap I'd feel stupid ordering just one item for almost the same price, but I really shouldn't because there's just too much food and somebody else has to finish my ramen every time.  What else...oh, they're always coming around with hot tea refills.  I have never had to ask.  And there's a little sink in the corner for you to wash your hands before you eat.  They've been closed now for the past week, though, and won't be open again until the 18th.  What is going on??  If anybody knows, please message me, thanks.", "author": "Janice C."}

I've had freshly made ramen before and this comes pretty close.  The place is pretty small and luckily we got there before the crowds.  We were 2nd on the list and still had to wait about 10 min to get a table.  I would give the ramen a 4 star rating.  It was decent and the chicken was cooked well but it just didn't seem all that flavorful.  It wasn't too salty so that's a big plus.  The noodles seemed like they were frozen after they were made.  Just didn't seem as fresh as the ramen I've had before.  Overall still a good bowl of ramen.  The pork and eggs over rice was alright.  It was too salty.  The taste was a salty, sweet mixture that worked well if only it were less salty.  I would only give it 3 stars.  The service was decent.  Very professional but not overly friendly.  They were there to give you food, tea and the check.  I've also been to ramen club in burlingame and that place is better.  The service is about the same but the ramen tastes fresher and the soup more flavorful.  Also, it took quite a while for the food to come out.  You would think at such a small place with a line you would want to get people in and out asap but they didn't care too much.", "author": "Ken W."}

Now I'm not a picky eater nor do I know anything about ramen but it was pretty decent. Two dishes for $10 is pretty cheap. I was full and satisfied.

It was closed until 5pm, so we decided to wait 15 minutes. They were a few people standing around waiting already so I suggested that we wait there too. (BF wanted to go look at the bookstore and come back at 5). Thank goodness we waited because a line formed behind us. We were 3rd to enter the restauarant. They seated us right next to the sink thats in the dining room (which is weird in itself, and possibly unsanitary). Luckily, the waitress took our order first and we were first to get our food. I had the karage rame and BF had the mabo tofu ramen because he likes spicy. Since this was technically our late lunch and we were eating dinner later, we decided not to get a combo or any appetizers. I liked my karage and BF's was pretty spice (which he likes). I like the noodles, which are supposedly home-made. We even paid and left before some people who were seated at the same time as us got their food. I guess you can say we got pretty lucky.\n\nI would definitely come back again to try some of the other dishes. I heard the nabe udon was supposed to be yummy too.", "author": "T C."}

The problem with good ramen seems to be the same with this place. A professional ramen cook can only cook for about 6-9 ramen dishes at a time since it is about not letting the noodles sit in the broth too long. hence the long wait and small number of customers at a time. when the shop first opens, all the orders pretty much come in at the same time so it can take a while to make all the dishes. overall, the place had a nice atmosphere, ok price and tasty ramen. will definately have to try some of the other dishes. Tokyo ramen was yummy but would have liked maybe 2 or 3 slices of the tasty cha shu pork. bamboo shoots were very good.", "author": "tomohisa w."}

Well, the service has always been neutral to indifferent, so that's the same. Tried to order the Chashu Ramen and was told they were out of Chashu (odd, since that's like one of the main varieties of ramen noodles, but OK) so ordered the Spicy Ramen. Holy Mother of Ramen! The broth was so spicy, it was inedible! Diners at next table noticed that I was STRUGGLING with the soup and commented! Did the kitchen accidentally give me double dose of spicy?! I can handle spicy, but not this one. I should have said something, but sometimes I wimp out and hate myself for wimping out. But, that's what I did. (OK, maybe I could have said something but just got the feeling the waitress wouldn't really care. That's my interpretation though.)  I don't think I will return. Oh, had the Agedashi as a starter, and it was OK. As I was fleeing the restaurant, I noticed that Bushi-Tei Bistro next door serves ramen with a choice of side dish for much less $ than Suzu. This was such a negative experience that I joined yelp to review the place and to save others from the mouth burning torture.", "author": "Dedicated E."}

The food was okay, but I was very disappointed with the service. I had ordered one of their lunch specials, curry rice with ramen, but when it came out, I noticed that they had instead given me tonkatsu over rice. I asked the waitress about the order, and she went and brought out the bill which indicated that she wrote down the incorrect order.  However, instead of correcting the order, she emphasized that she had repeated the order and would not do anything about my food.  Now, I may have misheard her when she repeated the order, but I was very surprised that she would not do anything about the situation.  I even asked for some curry so I could eat my rice, but she refused to do so.  After reading some of the other reviews on the site, I definitely agree that customer service is not one of this restaurant's strengths.", "author": "leo k."}
