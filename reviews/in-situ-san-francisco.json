I was a little worried to return as our first meal was so flawless the first time that I feared that our return visit could not live up to the hype. I'm happy to report that I've now had two amazing dinners at In Situ.\n\nAs others have mentioned, in Situ is unique in that it builds relationships with famous restaurants around the world. They take time learning in their restaurant and then have someone help them master the technique of their restaurant specific dish. The menu rotates often. They have about four cocktails to choose from, and have every dish paired by letter to help you choose the correct wine for every selection.\n\nWe started with the the small cups of carrot coconut soup. The flavor profile of the soup is out of this world. It is rich and complex with layers of coconut and rich carrots.\n\nWe then shared the tapioca and cheese bites as well as the vegetable tempura. Although the cheese bites were fun to look at, the taste was a little flat. It's only saving grace was the tangy punch of the sauce. The vegetable tempura was cooked to perfection and served with a hummus tips sauce that was seasoned well. The star of the starters was the cuddle fish. It was rich, creamy, slightly salty paired with rich creamy buttered potatoes and squid ink. A very European dish, and absolutely heavenly.\n\nWe then had the wasabi rice cereal crusted lobster. Similar flavor provide to walnut prawns, with a mayonnaise and crunchy outer layer and cooked seafood underneath. Sounds odd, but works beautifully. I must note that the presentation with star shaped marshmallows is super fun.\n\nAnother star of the show is the halibut cooked with an egg yolk. The egg adds a rich and cream dimension that balances out with the light halibut and airy sauce. We've ordered it both visits and have taken bread to soak up every last bit of the sauce. Note that bread and butter is $2 for two slices, but love that the money paid for bread goes to a food based charity.\n\nNow head my warning now, you must order the cheesecake dessert. I repeat, do not leave the restaurant without ordering the cheesecake dessert. To not be frightened away by the $22 price tag. It is worth every one if the 2,200 pennies. It is a rich Spanish cheese covered in a sweet hazelnut shell served with butter crisp cookies that act as a cracker to create a similar flavor profile to a graham cracker crust. It is the most magical bite you will ever put in your mouth. It is AMAZING!\n\nWe also ordered the green apple shell dessert in honor of the Magritte exhibit currently on exhibition. It was certainly social media worthy for photo oops, but didn't hold a candle to the cheesecake dessert. However still happy that we ordered it for the novelty of it. It had an white chocolate mouse similar to ice cream with a green apple white chocolate shell covering it to look like the apple Magritte is so famously known for.\n\nI must note that the setting is a little underwhelming compared to how fantastic and truly unique the menu offerings are. I wish that they had put the restaurant up in Moma outside the sculpture garden and put the casual dining cafe on the first floor off the street. The location doesn't seem like an appropriate fit. I also must nite that that the wooden seats are rather uncomfortable. \n\nI was also disappointed that they stopped offering their child menu. When asked about it, apparently it was only offered in the summer. Not sure why a child option would only be offered saeasonally. \n\nThe price tag is pretty hefty for dishes, alcohol and 20 percent tip already included. You probably could visit for less then $100 a person, but it would be hard. The two times we've gone it has been $300 for two people. You could probably be more selective when ordering, but with a meal as phenomenal as theirs, I say skimp somewhere else. Enjoy all the dishes that your budget will allow.", "author": "Victoria O."}

Another Michelin restaurant to try again for me (one star).\nIn Situ is located inside the SF MOMA, the dishes are work of art from famous chefs around the world.\n\nHaving looked at In Situ World's Most Iconic Dishes online, read great news about what's it all about, UNFORTUNATELY I didn't feel that the food and service are that great. It was probably not my lucky day, in my opinion the food are not that impressive especially in terms of the taste.\nService was very slow.\n\nThe menu, folded and fastened with a metal museum admission tag, looks like a guide to a gallery exhibition of works on temporary loan.\nThe dinner menu itself is unique which tell you the master creator for each dish, the location (America & Europe) and the year. On the left side there's a list of alphabets which suggest the drinks that go well with each dish.\n\nWe had Halibut Stuffed with Egg Yolk and Lamb Carrot for the Large Dishes. Both of the dish are disappointing, especially the Lamb Carrot's portion is very small (and it is put under the 'Large' section in the menu),  ridiculously very little braised lamb on top of a thin carrot. The only great thing is the bread (dinner rolls) stuffed with lamb.\nWhat a JOKE.\n\nThe Halibut Stuffed with Egg Yolk tasted weird, having egg yolk with fish really taste weird.\nThe Cuttlefish Cappuccino taste unique, very small portion served in a cup, which has potato, braised cuttlefish cut in small pieces, ink.\nThe Wasabi Lobster was beautifully presented, small portion, with the lobster is barely there, served with mango jelly, Thai vinaigrette, wasabi marshmallow.\n\nThe best thing to try in the restaurants are the cocktails and the dessert, not the food. \nThe Margritte, which contain of saison, bourbon, gentian amaro, egg whites and lemon is very tasty. The egg white at the top is decorated like a beehives, make it looks very unique.\nThe Jungle Bird is also very beautifully presented, it is a refreshing drink.\n\nOur dessert was called 'Ame - Sound of Rain' which is quite impressive. It is a mixed of green grapes, sake, citrus plus the pop rocks candy that make it sounds like the rain. The taste is very refreshing. \nI think this is the best dish at the night (sadly).\n\nIn summary, I think this restaurant is worth to try for the experience, but I will only go here once. I'd recommend to not have a high expectation for the food and be ready to pay big bucks at the end of the meal.", "author": "Irene X."}

It was a good experience overall!\n\nI guess my overall takeaway was that all the food sounded super interesting on the menu, and was beautifully presented, but I didn't LOVE anything I tried once we actually began eating it. My favorite dish of the bunch was the Wasabi Lobster, which had puffed cereal on the outside, a good ratio of sauce to other components of the dish, and a decent portion of lobster. The flavors and textures came together well into something unusual and interesting. The star-shaped wasabi marshmallows were a cool visual element but didn't taste much different from a normal marshmallow. \n\nFor mains, my boyfriend really enjoyed the Halibut Stuffed with Egg Yolk, which was tasty and rich (and also a cool and pretty presentation!). I had the Farro Piccolo Risotto which was basically a large portion of Farro topped with grated ricotta salata cheese, surrounded by an oil-based sauce. It was also pretty to look at and the first few bits were tasty, but it became a bit boring to eat as there was no variety on the plate. \n\nFor desserts we tried the Sage Smoked Dark Chocolate Brownie and the Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake (yes, the $22 dessert!). The herbal notes of the sage combined with the dark chocolate were interesting for a bite or two - others in our group really liked this, but it wasn't really my taste. I enjoyed the cheesecake more; it managed to be both sweet and savory at the same time, and I enjoyed the rich butter cookies it was served with. \n\nThey also had a great wine selection with some excellent local selections. The cocktails were decent as well (they have a rotating one themed to the exhibit of the moment, and some staples), but also not really memorable. Overall, at this price point (~$300 per couple), this was a fine experience, but there are many more enjoyable and delicious foodie experiences in SF!", "author": "Christine G."}

However, after eating, I think I know why. \n\n\nLet's start with the POSITIVE: \n\nMenu options from different chefs all over the world.\n\nThe ambiance is really cool. Loved the tables, chairs, design, & setup. \n\nThey charge an automatic 20% gratuity to all checks, so all the waitstaff seem to help all tables. Kinda cool. Great service. \n\n\n\nNow for the NEGATIVE:\n\nCompletely underwhelmed.\n\nDifferent menu options from different chefs all over the word sounds great until you're ordering and the waitstaff tells you all these fancy schmancy names and explanations. Then they plop it in front of you and you're like ... ughhh what's that?!?! Or, \"ohhh you could've just said it's like a pizza but on a croissant-like crust\".\n\nI appreciate creativity when it comes to food, and I totally respect the chef game. However, I need flavors to sing in my mouth. The worst thing ever is to go in expecting the best and end up leaving disappointed beyond belief. \n\nDoubt I'll be back.", "author": "Ali R."}

There were only a few people in, so don't worry if you haven't made a reservation.\n\nThe menu looks very tantalizing and is drummed up by a multitude of famous chefs. I'd wanted to try the lemon tart but that wasn't available anymore, so I ordered the Green Apple, which was inspired by the current Magritte exhibition. My friend also ordered some bread and butter because she was starving. \n\nThe apple indeed looks like an apple, but the novelty stops there. Upon cracking it open, the inside is full of fluffy, buttery mousse with some pine nuts in between. I didn't really understand what the pine nuts were trying to accomplish. The mousse was good but also tasted like any ordinary mousse that you could make by mixing a ton of butter and sugar together. I shouldn't expect too much from bread and butter, but I was a bit disappointed that the bread wasn't warm or toasted. \n\nThe interior echoes the design of the MoMA with some funnily folded menus and really nice quality napkins.", "author": "Sophie W."}

Borderline dessert because of the amount of coconut cream, very thick and heavy. Leeks with potato and sorrel. The presentation was gorgeous, the potato in this sort of cage a-top small white pebbles, and the leek-sorrel in a separate dish for dipping. It was tasty but a bit too thick, slightly reminded me of pancake batter. Risotto for my main was tasty, sorrel again and wild mushrooms. The serving size is too large as this is a heavy dish. Finished with the Ame, a great end to a heavy meal. \n\n In-general this felt like a winter meal not late Summer/Autumn. \n\nWith tax and tip + four drinks, $220 total. On-par I guess however didn't seem worth it.\n\nThe experiential aspect and design is great, a fun place for out of town guests or a lovely date. The food + service is good, with dozens of restaurants doing it better all over SF.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-02", "description": "No way! That's was I was thinking when they brought our cocktails to the table. We had ordered two Last Word cocktails from their \"bar\" area and what we received honestly shocked me. For $14 a cocktail, we received a glass full of ice with barely an 1.5\" of liquid. At first, I thought the server misunderstood our order and split a cocktail in half and severed it in two glasses. No, it was a \"full\" size cocktail at this place. I couldn't believe it. We've ordered this particular cocktail countless times over the years in countless bars and restaurants and this was the smallest pour we've ever received. It was a complete ripoff! \n\nI'm still mad about this now and it happened 4 days ago (visit date 9/29/18 at 2pm). The server never came back to the table but someone who looked like a manager was cleaning a table nearby (we had finished the cocktail by this point - 4 small sips finished the drink btw). I got his attention and described our situation. At first he said that sounds like your cocktail was right, that was until I showed him the picture of my finger next to the glass for scale. Please note that this was before I took a drink out of the glass - that was what showed up to the table (this picture is part of my review). He then said \"that looks a little light\". My wife's drink had at least another .25\" of liquid in it so I knew the portions were off, her's was still far too little. The manager offered to remove one of the cocktails and I told him I wasn't looking for a free drink but he should know how bad this was, especially in SF which is known for great cocktails. He came back to the table with the bill and he had removed one of the drinks anyway (our original server never came back to the table). \n\nEven with the one cocktail removed from the bill, I still overpaid. I didn't even get a chance to address how bad the cocktails tasted. Watery, flat with no flavor. It was a terrible experience and I would strongly suggest that anyone reading this review should avoid this place for cocktails, whether your visiting SFMOMA like we were or just in that area coming in for a drink, it's not worth your time.", "author": "Theart P."}

It was nice to enjoy the cocktail after a few hours at the MOMA and people watch on the street. I took off one star because I don't like it went places automatically add gratuity, especially when there are only two of us. Also, our server asked if we wanted another one and we said that was it.

We were seated right away and the waiter explained the menu. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Cuttlefish Cappuccino: really good! we were told this dish is small, but it's very creamy, we were able to share this between us and feels like it's a good portion to share. \n- Wasabi Lobster: if you like wasabi, you definitely have to try this. comes with wasabi marshmallow too!\n- Halibut Stuffed with Egg Yolk: good, the egg yolk made a good sauce for this dish!\n- Lamb Carrot: good, but very small portion for an entree.\n- Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake: very good! must get! the cheesecake is amazing! the best out of everything we got.

The two of us tried the small dishes of carrot soup, cuttlefish, the medium dishes of farm egg, wasabi crusted lobster and a large dish of lamb carrot. We hardly have room left for the green apple dessert. Every dish was a delight to look at and a joy to taste. Since their menu do change regularly, one should come back often and experience the creativities of all the international chefs. The bonus would be visiting the museum before dinner.

It's beautiful. Completely melts in your mouth with a kick of lemon. \n-Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake: I liked the consistency, but the aftertaste was not great for me.

As other Yelpers have mentioned, if you are aware of what is served at other international restaurants and know servings don't come with the usual American serving sizes then you'll be ok. Also, listen to the server who explains the size of the dishes for the small, medium and large and you'll be just fine. It's recommended that you order one small dish to yourself, share a medium and then get a large - then save room for dessert if you're still hungry - which we definitely weren't.\n\nShowing which wines correspond best with the food you're ordering is a great idea. I went with the Tempranillo. From the small plates I ordered the tempura fish cake - beautifully light and delicate flavors. Medium dish I shared with my Dad - the wasabi lobster. Perfect balance of wasabi, not over powering at all, sweet, delicious lobster. From the large plates I ordered the Farro Risotto. The large amount of dry ricotta balanced perfectly to cut through the risotto. The sorrel sauce on the side perfectly complimented the dish. \n\nAlso on the table we got the bread - love that the profits are donated to charity - that brown butter on the side, YUM!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-17", "description": "As many reviewers had already pointed out, I'm just as confused as everyone else as to why In Situ has such a wide discrepancy between its Yelp ratings after being named 2016 Chronicle's Restaurant of the Year and recently earning its first Michelin star. I've been wanting to try Corey Lee's Benu for quite some time, but cost had remained a restriction. After reading reviews since In Situ opened a couple of years ago, it has been on my radar for restaurants to try.\n\nUnlike restaurants that have a theme, In Situ's concept of featuring the signature dishes of the world's top chefs is definitely unique. Although my dad didn't like that none of the dishes tied together, I enjoyed trying recreations of such a diverse menu. I would juxtapose it to the different styles of art that are within the walls of the SFMOMA - you may not enjoy all of it, but there's certainly something for everyone. \n\nWe stopped by for lunch service shortly after visiting the SFMOMA. The lunch menu is the same as dinner and reservations were easy to come by on OpenTable. The menu is divided into small, medium, and large dishes. I would recommend ordering a few of each, and sharing amongst the table. Some of the dishes we tried are as follows:\n\nSmall:\nHomemade Kamaboko Tempura ($10) - two fried fish cakes per skewer (2), well flavored with ginger scallion.\n\nMedium:\nWasabi Lobster ($28) - this piece of lobster tail decorated with mango jelly, wasabi marshmallows and Thai vinaigrette is well worth the price. If you are a fan of wasabi, this dish is for you. \n\nLarge:\nCreole BBQ Shrimp and Grits ($24) - probably one of my favorite shrimp and grits dishes I've tried. The shrimp was well cooked and that sauce was just perfect.\n\nJokbal Ssam ($26) - my least favorite dish. It was typical Korean food that was marked up with perfect pieces of lettuce. I was least impressed with this dish because there was really nothing special about it that you couldn't find from any Korean restaurant.\n\nFarro Piccolo Risotto ($26) - my favorite out of the large entrees, this was one of the best risottos I've ever had. Everything from the earthiness of the hen of the wood mushrooms to the smoked and dried ricotta on top that is supposed to emulate the Colorado snowfall, from which this dish was born, is perfect. The sorrel puree gives it its bright green appearance. \n\nBeef and Pumpkin Mole ($34) - very tender beef, well-placed radish, cashews, and cranberry beans for texture, but the mole itself lacked the depth of flavor that you usually get from traditional Mexican mole.\n\nCountry Bread, Butter, Sesame seed ($2) - as this is San Francisco, bread is no longer free, but if it makes you feel any better, 100% of the profits from the bread is donated to charities. \n\nDessert:\nJasper Hill Farm Cheesecake ($22) - don't scoff at the price of this cheesecake. It is well worth it. If there was one dish you could get here, this is it. I was fooled that we had ordered just a wheel of cheese, but the hazelnut \"rind\" is ridiculously good when paired with the cheese and cookie. It encompassed everything that a perfect dessert should have including sweetness, saltiness, rich nuttiness, crunch, and a satisfying flavor. I loved that the irony of eating the cheesecake is that this wheel is cut and placed on cookies like we were eating cheese and crackers. Very well-thought out and a fun experience. MUST TRY!\n\nOverall, I loved the ambiance and well-lit interior. The service was excellent and I was a bit shocked that between four people, after sharing our dishes, we were all full and ended up paying around $60 with tax and service fees included. That's a great deal for a Michelin starred restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-24", "description": "The food is great here. They serve recreations of famous chefs' signature dishes, a lot of which look like art and taste like heaven. However, the downside is how pricey each dish is. A small plate is literally sized like an amuse bouche - one bite or so. A medium plate is shareable but won't fill you up. You can easily share something like 1 large plate and 2-3 small and medium plates amongst 2 people. \n\nTheir menu changes often, but some items might stay longer. Some of my favorites included the Apocalypse burger (hard to share and so tiny though!), Into the Forest (the moss looking sponge and the greens are so interesting), and the cheese cake that's shaped like a wheel of cheese.\n\nI do wish they have more of a theme when they change up their menu, or do tastings. I find it difficult to taste certain dishes side by side when one is subtle and the other very loud and spicy.\n\nThe wine selection is decent, the waitstaff, on the other hand, are nice but trained more like cafe staff. \n\nI certainly like this place and will probably keep coming back, but there are so many little things that make it not quite the best curated experience.", "author": "Alice C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "As others have said, I was curious about the juxtaposition of In Situ's Michelin star and it's subpar Yelp ratings, although I can understand where some diners are coming from. \n\nI made a reservation here one day during a busy business trip week and was seated after only a few minutes. I had had my eye on In Situ after visiting SFMOMA a few months ago, and I definitely think it feels like it is a part of the museum (in a good way) while defining its own space, all at once. Having a menu that is completely recreated from other chefs' menus is simultaneously inventive and unoriginal, which is one of the characteristics that draws people here.\n\nWhen I was seated, the menu came folded asymmetrically (intentionally) with a little note explaining that the restaurant works \"directly with leading chefs from around the world to bring their recipes to SFMOMA.\" There is then a menu listing each of the currently featured chefs, their restaurant, and a description of their guiding principles. I really enjoyed reading through each one and learning more about the chefs who supplied the base for this menu. \n\nI asked the friendly server for a drink recommendation, and she offered the French 75, a gin-based libation with lemon, brut champagne, and Calvados apple brandy. It was nice, light, and refreshing, with just enough gin to be present without being overpowering. I perused the menu for quite a while and figured out the small/medium/large dish arrangement--which the server shortly explained to me--and started with the caramelized carrot soup. \n\nThis is the point where I would recommend consulting the staff when ordering because portion sizes here are...different. The \"small\" dishes are just that, and I don't mean like tapas. The \"large\" plates are basically entr\u00e9es.\n\n The carrot soup came in a cappuccino glass and I was told that it was intended to be drunk like a cappuccino. While I didn't expect it to be quite that shot-sized, I LOVED the soup. It smelled like walking into an old-school Indian restaurant, with the chaat masala. The coconut foam is nice precisely because it does not taste like coconut. This was a great palate prepper with the texture of a rich but pillowy cloud. \n\nCourse 2: Lamb shank manti. I learned that manti is a Turkish dish where dumplings are stuffed with lamb and topped with a trio of yogurt, brown butter, and tomato sauces. Yum! The lamb was cooked just as it should have been, and I enjoyed diving through the flavors in this dish. \n\n*At this point, I was still hungry, so I added the Apocolypse Burger.*\n\nThis was definitely the most basic, average dish. The default preparation comes with squid ink, and due to my allergy, they subbed in a lettuce leaf. It is a 2 oz. burger patty with lettuce, pickles, red onion, cheese, and an interesting mustardy side sauce. Honestly, it was a burger slider--nothing more, nothing less. I will say I don't like pickles but intentionally left them on this dish and sort of enjoyed them, so props for that, In Situ. Again, this is a small slider and is absolutely meant to be coursed with a couple of other dishes, so keep that in mind. \n\nI loved being able to sit here and watch the foot traffic while enjoying the 50 framed photos on the wall by artist Tucker Nichols. \n\nAll in all, In Situ is cool. It is marked precisely by its lack of an attempt to create a \"cohesive\" menu, which results in a unique menu with flavors from around the world. I think they pull it off well. Plus, everything in this place is a little artistic, and who among us couldn't use a bit more of that?", "author": "Willie R."}

It had a creative menu, aesthetically pleasing dining room in MOMA, and a wonderful staff. \n\nUpon arriving to dinner, I almost missed the location from the outside because the sign was so small. But, when I checked in with the hostess, I was seated in a very modernly designed restaurant. It seemed more of like an art gallery and not even a restaurant because the kitchen was completely out of sight. \n\nMy table had a very unique menu where it was folded in an asymmetrical way. The menu itself was structured in categories by relative size ranging from small to large plates; however, each item on the menu was inspired by a different restaurant from famous chef's restaurants around the world. I started off with the country bread in the small section of the menu. And the more interesting dishes started when medium dish came out, the directors salad. The salad had the chicken hidden under a pile of lettuce. I thought this salad was a scavengers hunt because I almost forgot that the chicken was even there. The food was almost playful in a way. This playfulness came to light in the large dish course which I ordered the beef lettuce cups. The waiters had to come in two waves to bring out all of the components of the diy item because of the 5+ small plates they had to bring out. And finally, the main highlight of the meal was the green apple mousse dessert. The mousse was hidden in a green casing of an apple that looked too much like an actual apple. \n\nOverall, the items on the menu displayed creativity on another level that some restaurants seem to lack. I was happy to not let negative reviews persuade me from not trying out the food for myself and judge.", "author": "Ricardo R."}

Also, they automatically add 20% gratuity which is great because the last thing I want to do after eating is to do math.\n\nIt is pretty easy to walk-in as their space is large and there always seems to be some extra seating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-09", "description": "The most apt justification of an In Situ review is to quickly peruse Rotten Tomatoes, where you'll often find a stark dichotomy between critic and user reviews. In short, In Situ is naturally designed to appeal to the food critic. A quick perusal of professional reviews justify its lofty ranking as it transports the writer to ghosts of dishes past; these are dishes the proletariat Yelp reviewer has likely never eaten, let alone heard of. I'd argue we are more concerned about the pure food, and its corresponding taste to cost ratio.\n\nNevertheless, I'll post a split the baby review and look at both sides. The best one sentence review I can offer is Pete Wells' lede: \"By avoiding originality, In Situ is the most original new restaurant in the country.\" Truly, the menu is an experience like no other. In Situ looks to recreate famous dishes from other restaurants and other times, with a relatively sparse menu rich with history. Opening the menu and reading the paragraphs is arguably the funnest part of this dining experience, if not marveling at the dishes as they arrive.\n\nThe fundamental issue I have from my experience is that the food just isn't spectacular. Part of that is perhaps by design; it's hard to build a cohesive meal when all the dishes are so disparate to start with. Nevertheless, I'd still argue that the dishes we ordered, when taken in silo, should have simply tasted as good as they looked.\n\nA detailed review of the dishes is foolhardy, as the menu is forever rotating. That said, my personal favorite was the Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake, a take on Albert Adria's famed Tickets dessert. To me, it was rich, salty, sweet, gooey, crunchy, and delicious, a perfect harmonization of all things flavor. My wife was less impressed. On the other hand, my wife loved the Voyage from the Indies, a thoroughly simple fish dish that I felt was bland (I remarked the mango-apple compote tasted like baby food) but she deemed impeccable.\n\nThat out of the way, the concept of In Situ is indeed breathtakingly original and commendable. Given that one of my favorite reasons for making my travels all (mostly?) about eating is that I strongly feel local food is the most direct route to understanding a city's culture, history, and it's soul. In Situ is dedicated to doing exactly that, only transporting it into a museum environment and showcasing it to the masses (or those who can afford it, anyhow). That, in itself, is five-star worthy.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "In a very casual setting, you wouldn't expect this attachment to the front of the MOMA to be such a highly rated restaurant. Sleek and simple, the dining room seems a little bland but the more I sat there the more I appreciated it's minimalism. I think it's interesting that there are so many influences on the menu, but I fear it may take away a bit from its cohesiveness. Still, everything I had was extremely well done.\n\n I started with the Trousseau Gris which was one of the most phenomenal California wines I've ever had, especially for about 15 a glass, so clean yet complex, something you'd expect from Provence or Loire. Paired that with their lobster appetizer from Tim Raue which lives up to his hype. Bombastic flavor that builds wasabi on wasabi on wasabi without becoming overwhelming. Perfectly balanced by the mango and the sweetness of the lobster. One of the best things I've ever eaten. \n\nNext I went for the Farro Risotto with wood ear and maitake mushrooms. I was worried that the flavor of the appetizer was so intense that it would overshadow the main and discussed this with my waiter, and he led me to this dish which was definitely very well done. Extremely complex and beautiful in both it's presentation and it's layering of flavors, warm and hearty without becoming overly rich, but still failed to impress me in the way that the appetizer had which left me wanting the entire way through. I don't want to take away from my 5 stars because I think it was worth the money I paid for it and I was so happy with the wine of the lobster and my cocktail that I got in lieu of dessert, but as I said earlier, they may want to think about the cohesiveness of the menu a little bit more.\n\nWhat I like the most is that the serve staff are also the cooks who have rotating shifts in the kitchen and front of house. As someone in the industry I think this is a very awesome and modern way of running a restaurant. Thanks In Situ! I will be back.", "author": "Jonny P."}

Surprisingly, they were able to accommodate us on the spot! We were elated. As we sat down and reviewed the menu, only certain items really popped out at us. The prices hovered at around $8-$12 for small bites, to $18-$25 for medium sized plates (think 4 bites) and then $30+ for entree sized items.  It did seem a bit expensive, but for the ambience and service, I think that's what one should expect when dining out in SF, especially in the downtown areas.  What TOTALLY caught us off guard was the fact that the portions were SO TINY!\n\nI had read a review earlier on in the day right before we stepped in, saying something about how they were still hungry after their meal.  We were right along the same wavelength about 4 dishes into our meal.  We ordered the Apocalypse Burger (It's really a 2-bite wonder that we couldn't share between the 2 of us because it wasn't enough), Cheese Fritters (5 little cubes) Glazed Chicken Thighs with Egg (This dish was pretty bomb, all the flavors went really well), Wasabi Lobster (TOOOOO much Wasabi. It totally masked the flavors of anything else on the pretty plate. What a waste of $28) The highlight of the meal was definitely the Cheesecake.  Their play on cheesecake was clever, a type of triple creme cheese melted to a smooth velvety consistency, the cheese coated with white chocolate and hints of hazelnut in the crust. It was A+ and totally worth the $22. \n\nService was great and attentive, but I didn't like the fact that they included a 20% mandatory charge for gratuity.  It just feels stuck-up and leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially since you just paid $150 for 2 people. We didn't order any alcohol. 4 Dishes (small bites) + 1 Dessert = $150? And the worst part was, we were still hungry! We ended up walking over to Delarosa for pasta and appetizers.  We spent $50 for that and were finally full! \n\nBut you know, we wanted to experience In Situ, and we did. We were impressed by the decor, the service, and the general ambience and presentation of dishes.  The food though, some had high points, and most were just middle of the road for me.  I would probably come back for the Cheesecake and refer people for that one dish, but nothing else.

This modern little restaurant is located to the right of the entrance into the SF MOMA. It's a cute little place that emphasizes minimalistic modernism.\n\n* Sea Urchin in a Lobster Jello-o *\nI've never ate anything as extravagant as this before in my entire life. Its got a sweet and light cauliflower puree, a layer of the freshest uni I've ever tasted, a salty lobster jello layer on top, and a mound of caviar topped with gold flakes. This dish also comes with a side of seaweed rice crackers (which are absolutely delightful). I tried spreading the cauliflower puree and lobster jello onto the rice cracker but to be honest I prefer them separate. This dish tastes like the ocean! The ingredients within this dish are one of the few things where you can really taste the quality of fresh ingredients. I've never tasted uni so fresh before. The combination of ingredients are so perfectly well balanced that it's as if your palate is diving into the deep blue sea. \n\n* Apocalypse Burger *\nThis is a very interesting take on a burger. I would describe it as a mini burger with a black tortilla chip as a bun. But I'm pretty sure I ate this dish wrong because the menu calls it a lettuce wrap (and I shredded the lettuce to put inside the tiny burger). Overall I wasn't too impressed by anything but it was worth a try.\n\n* Dadinhos de Tapioca *\nThis dish comes with six pieces of tater-tot looking cubes and a little saucer of tangy dipping sauce. The tots are made with tapioca flour and then deep fried, giving it a crispy outer layer but a nice chewy texture on the inside. You can taste the faint pieces of cheese on the inside but overall there isn't much flavor (hence the dipping sauce probably). Overall this dish didn't leave me yearning for more.\n\n* Wasabi Lobster *\nFor those who dislike wasabi, be warned! This dish is actually very strong of wasabi (which I actually love, call me weird). The lobster is coated in crispy wasabi flakes and rests on this tangy mango sauce.\nThe texture of the lobster is amazing; its got this delightfully fun bounce to it when you bite down. I absolutely enjoyed this dish! \n\n* Farro Piccolo Risotto *\nOf all the dishes I've had here today, this was my least favorite. Its presentation is that of a patty sprinkled with dried flakes of ricotta; to be frank it didn't look that appealing. The taste is that heavily of mushrooms and you can smell the smokiness of the dried ricotta. But overall, the texture and flavor were not up my alley.\n\n* Country Bread *\nThis order came with two slices of bread and a dish of creamed butter topped with sesame seeds. It's literally just a dense slice of bread but by golly this was delicious (have I mentioned that I really love to eat carbs).\n\n* Interpretation of Vanity *\nThis is their most popular dessert. It's an unbelievably moist mousse chocolate cake that's enveloped by chocolate bubbles. When the bubbles pop, it forms a chocolate sauce on the bottom that you can eat with the cake to make it even more MOIST. This was delicious. I'm normally not a big fan of chocolate desserts but this was absolutely delicious because the chocolate is of a higher percentage of cocoa so it had a good balance between sweetness and bitterness.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

However, the presentation and \"science\" that went into this dish was 5 star worthy. Definitely worth a try.\nx Fine Herb Salad (avocado, lemon spice, lavash) - 5/5 So simple, yet so delicious. Everything I love in a salad.\nx The Voyage from the Indies (wild John Dory, cabbage, turmeric, mango-apple compote) - 2.5/5 Our least favorite of the night. I've had John Dory only once before, but it wasn't as tough as the one here. I'm not a huge fan of turmeric either so that may have turned me off but overall this dish was a bit bland. \nx Farro Piccolo Risotto (hen of the wood mushrooms, smoked and dried ricotta, sorrel) - 5/5 YOU MUST GET THIS.

Probably the quietest place I've dined. Service is fine.\n\nSo, the good. This is probably the only place in town where you can drop $200 for two people and still leave hungry. We had the quite mediocre risotto and tapioca cheese fritters. The former was an interesting take on risotto that was about as much of a departure you can make from the original and still get away with calling it risotto. The latter were what one would expect, and fun and different, but nothing amazing.\n\nWe also had the octopus (spicy, Peru), and it was quite delicious and the smallest portion for its price. If I were to crave octopus I'd probably go have the setup at Piccino instead.\n\nAnd we had the wasabi lobster, which was by far the most delicious and interesting of the 4.

Some 100 recipes were collected for the venture, and about 20 are on the menu at any one time.  All are executed exactly as they would be in the originating restaurant and no substitutions can be made.  San Francisco Chronicle restaurant critic, Michael Bauer, named In Situ the Bay Area's top new restaurant of the year.  \n\nThe experience of In Situ is interesting.  A friend and I compared notes and agreed on this:\n\n*  The restaurant itself isn't much of a destination so it's best combined with a visit to MOMA (in which it is located); and  \n\n*  The concept behind In Situ could only work here, inside an art museum.  \n\nBut does it work?  \n\nIf you want to sample top dishes from Earth's destination restaurants, yes.

We knew coming in that it wasn't going to be cheap, but my goodness, it was SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE. \n\nWe ordered:\n1. Tartare ($22)\n2. Sasaki ($22)\n3. Cebiche ($24)\n4. Cheese cake ($22)\n\nOn the menu, there is a pie chart that indicates the size of the dish. I really wanted to get the burger, but when I saw that if was only a quarter of the pie chart at 20-something dollars, I said no thanks. I LOVE tartare so I ordered that. Ehhhhhh, how do I say it, the meat looked like it just came out of the meat grinder and the portion was tiny. When I say the meat looked like it just came out of the meat grinder, it looked like meat that came right out of the Safeway ground meat package. There was also far TOO MUCH horseradish cream. I couldn't remove it as it was sandwiched in between my tartare. It was also far too salty, so I ended up not finishing my dish. \n\nMy co-worker's dish was basically meat cubes on top of a bed of romaine lettuce. Also a small portion. He finished it, but he didn't rave about it. After finishing our dishes, I decided that we needed to order more because that was just not enough food. We went with the cebiche. It was a bit spicy, but had halibut, scallop, shrimp, and crab. I thought that for the money, this was probably your best bang for your buck out of the dishes we ordered. \n\nWe finished our lunch with the cheese cake. Not cheesecake, but cheese cake (2 words). The story behind this dish was that my co-worker recently came back from Spain. He had wanted to eat at the restaurant that makes the actual cheese cake, but was unable to go. So when he saw this on the menu, he really wanted to get it. It is a mini cheese wheel, coated in some white chocolate. It was really weird and none of us have ever eaten anything like that before. It came with these little cookies and they gave you, essentially, a butter knife, and you could just spread the cheese on your cookie. The cheese was a bit stinky, but it was cool. My co-worker really loved it and said he would come back just for this 1 dessert.\n\nIn Situ is one of those SF restaurants that require that you pay 20% for tip. The service wasn't bad, so I don't have any feelings about that. However, what I do have feelings about was the price of the actual food. We both walked out barely full, and lunch cost $117.18 (tax and tip).  For that amount of money, would could have stuffed ourselves and walked out super full at any other restaurant in the city for lunch. The food quality and taste definitely wasn't worth that amount of money. I'm glad I came so that I could say I have been here, but I will not recommend this place to any of my friends. Save your money and go to a real quality Michelin star restaurant. Remember, not all Michelin star restaurants are good, so choose wisely.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-14", "description": "I  read a rave food review by San Francisco's local food critic, Michael Bauer, and was anxious to try it out. I had been on my feet for five hours in the Museum of Modern Art and didn't want to sit in the high bar stools for singles (me). The hostess kindly let me sit at a low table for six with comfy seats. \n\nThe concept is very clever. It is presented as a group show by chefs around the world. The menu serves as the label one would see on the wall next to a work of art. A really nice touch, which even my young waiter didn't get, was the clip holding the menus together was the type they used to give to wear to museum goers to show they had paid. Young folks wouldn't know about this as they haven't been in use for many years. My server was excellent and he explained the concept very clearly. \n\nI ordered a Pimm's Cup cocktail which was beautiful and delicious. I ordered carrot soup with coconut foam and was instructed to drink it like an espresso. It was rich and extraordinarily good. The small portion was appropriate. It was so thick and rich I don't think I would have wanted a bigger portion. Finally I had the most delicious version of beans on toast I have ever had. It was garlicky and unctuous. I was full!  \n\nThis restaurant can be entered from the street or the museum. It is everything Michael Bauer said it was. A lovely homage to the museum experience and a statement about food as art. It is a little expensive, but so is art.", "author": "Jane F."}

Don't get me wrong - the service was courteous and helpful enough - and maybe it's my own biases. I've had my share of Michelin-starred and high-priced fare, but it's mostly been in appropriately rarefied settings, as opposed to a place that looks like a modern cafeteria.\n\nThe \"Apocalypse Burger,\" for example, was quite the dainty, canape-sized little thing, featuring a tiny serving of beef and cheese inside a nifty, crispy, tortilla-like clam shell. It also came with what appeared to be aioli on the side, plus some small tomato, pickle, and onion slices, all of which you could wrap with a leaf of lettuce. A nice little bite? Yes. Was it worth the $14, even for the chi-chi kitschiness of it alll? No.\n\nThe wasabi lobster was a bit more satisfying in its complexity. The lobster came encrusted with a beautiful wasabi marshmallow coating, with the sharp wasabi flavor offset somewhat by dashes of mango jelly and Thai vinaigrette.  Again, however, a bit premium-priced for such a small serving.\n\nService was courteous and helpful, and it looked like there was an army of people working in the partially exposed kitchen. I fully understand how much it costs to put together haute cuisine, and I also know that this is a museum setting. Alas, I still feel that the overall price-value tradeoff is a bit out of whack.", "author": "Vincent L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-18", "description": "Wait - Reservation\n\nValue - $24 / dish.\n\nDish Size: Small. \n\nWasabi Lobster - I probably could eat at least 10 of these dishes. The pairing of wasabi and lobster works quite well and gives the overall dish an Asian influence. A must order. \n\nShrimp Grits - Having had this before WD-50 closed, I must say that it tastes very close to the original Shrimp Grits by Wylie. Essentially it's shrimp meat made into grits, how cool is that. \n\nLettuce Sandwich - Robbery, $12 for literally two slices of lettuce. Are you kidding me? I don't care how avant-garde or conceptual the restaurant is. I'm still upset about this.\n\nSpicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes - This dish is a good introduction to the world of Momofuku. I'm not sure how they are able to get the Rice cakes so crispy on the outside but still chewy on the inside. The spicy pork sausage is flavorful with a base of saltiness offset by some spice and sweet tanginess. This dish has everything, you can't go wrong by ordering it. \n\nJasper Farm Hill Cheesecake - This is not your traditional cheesecake. Having said that, traditional cheesecake should start being made like the Jasper Farm Hill Cheesecake. Every bite feels like gluttonous sin.  \n\nInterpretation of Vanity - If you love chocolate then this is your dish. It's chocolate on top of chocolate with chocolate bubbles. The dish looks like if the chocolate caked farted out chocolate bubbles. No joke. \n\nWood Sorrel & Sheep's Milk Yogurt - I'm still not exactly not what I had but it was amazing. The sorrel ice was an interesting flavor that I can say that I haven't had before. The sheep's milk was simply out of this world. \n\n\nThe strength of In Situ is the concept - it's simple and genius. For those who don't know the concept, In Situ curates a rotating menu by replicating signature dishes from Chef's all around the world. Essentially meaning, In Situ does not have any of their own original dishes, releasing them from blame if a dish tastes bad. Just kidding. This idea is great because it allows people to taste a bit of these world renowned restaurants without planning a whole vacation.\n\nIn Situ feels as if it's one of the art galleries of the SF MOMA, instead of room full of art it's a room for a conceptual dining experience. Just as you would expect anything located inside a modern art museum, a lot of care went into the design of In Situ. Everything from the undulating wood lattice ceiling, to the drift wood dining tables, and paint brush style spoon and forks have been designed. You must be thinking, this place sounds pretentious. Yes it is. \n\nUsually with pretension comes with small plates and a large price tag. In Situ doesn't stray far from the pretension norm, so be prepared to spend money. To be fair, each dish is looks like it's a work of art. I can only venture the heavy price tag includes royalties paid back to the original chef?  \n\nThe curation of the menu seems a bit hap hazard. There really isn't a strong concept driving the overall offering of dishes. Some of the dishes are great and some just okay but they all don't really work together. You come to In Situ to have an unique dining experience. It's great place to take anyone who likes an adventure or seriously into food.", "author": "Julian L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-10", "description": "As someone who 1) loves hoarding Michelin stars, 2) is a not-so-wanderlust who puts up with the travel planning/hassles/expenses primarily for food, and 3) curious for fine dining but doesn't want to splurge $$$$$ on one meal, In Situ is godsend. \n\nLocated in SF MOMA, In Situ is a bit of a hidden gem--it doesn't make many lists (whether for tourists or locals), and initially people seemed discontent with their visit not being up to par with the expectations/pricetag. But when craft coffee plus manicured avo toast costs ~$15, paying $20-30 for famous fine dining dishes from around the world is a steal.\n\nThe menu changes according to seasonal ingredient availabilities, and they rotate in dishes from well-known local places like French Laundry and Manresa, as well as their equivalents from around the world. The variety of options can be simultaneously exhilarating and overwhelming, so I did some research on the menu ahead of time. Essentially, I selected dishes from Michelin star places from Europe to get the most bang for my buck.\n\n(+++) Cuttlefish Cappuccino ($18; potato, braised cuttlefish, ink / Massamiliano Alajmo, Le Calandre / Rubano, Italy, 1996): ...sublime. Warm, molten potato is infused with umami ink and deep shellfish taste of the cuttlefish. The result is a familiar yet novel \"cappuccino\" brimming with nostalgia, kindling memories of pureed potato soup and fresh seafood. I'm particularly impressed that it maintained its warm despite the time I took for my obsessive food photos.\n\n(++) Wasabi Lobster ($26; mango jelly, Thai vinaigrette, wasabi marshmallow / Tim Raue, Restaurant Tim Raue / Berlin, Germany, 2013): I was skeptical because it sounded like a tiny piece of lobster adorned with wasabi so as to be dubbed haute fusion, but the bold flavors and textures blew us away. The wasabi is unrestrained, eliciting unique dimensions from the lobster and leaving a masochist satisfaction of pungent nasal spice sensations. I also appreciated the playful touch of the star-shaped wasabi marshmallow, the concept of which was intriguing in itself, and the frivolous presentation like a breath of fresh air amidst the seriousness of fine dining.\n\n(+++) The Forest ($28; quinoa risotto, mushrooms, parsley \"moss\" / Mauro Colagreco, Mirazur / Menton, France, 2011): Perhaps the most memorable aspect of the dining experience during our visit was looking for the different types of mushrooms in this artsy dish as if we were foraging on the forest floor. The adventurous recreation employs a subtle parsley sponge cake \"moss\", crispy sunchoke \"bark\", fresh and colorful \"leaves\", a delicious nutty quinoa risotto \"dirt floor\", and topped with edible flowers (no parentheses needed for this one). I cannot begin to describe the complex nuances and aromatic tones of the morels. Overall, the array of mushrooms braised in a flavorful earthy broth felt very true to the farm-to-table concept. \n\n(+++) Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake ($22; hazelnut, white chocolate, cookie / Albert Adri\u00e0, Tickets / Barcelona, Spain, 2015): The presentation of the cheesecake taking the form of a block of cheese and crackers is fascinating and whimsical. They even replicated the little tag with the name of the original restaurant. It's possibly the most you'll ever spend on a cheesecake, but it really is that good--lusciously soft and creamy, airy light and mildly sweet. The composition was inverted with a top outer coating of hazelnut and white chocolate (reminiscent of Ferrero Rocher), with the \"crust\" on the side as vanilla wafer cookies. \n\nAt first, I was slightly disappointed by the setting because it seemed rather plain. Walking past the bar area, I actually found that more ambiancey than the actual restaurant. I was also momentarily taken aback by the chipped paint on the table surface which does not bode well for food photos. However, I came to appreciate the minimalist touches meant to imitate a modern art museum: the abstract-looking silverware, the modern angled rectangular plate, the theme of neutral shades. I think my only gripe is that the tables seemed a bit too close; I totally felt like the older couple next to us was judging me for taking food photos.\n\nTips:\n*20% gratuity is automatically included--hefty, but reasonable and makes things easier. They also don't charge extra for SF mandate like most upscale places.\n*They take reservations, but requires a credit card and there is a charge for flaking. \n*The menu includes a description of the originating restaurant. Apparently the chefs either send detailed instructions, or In Situ chefs fly there to learn how to recreate the dish.\n*The menu also indicates if dishes are small/med/large portion sizes. In any case, Chipotle is close by.\n*Our meal totaled to $125 for 2 (and I was full).\n\nPro tip: The names of the dishes are interesting and a good way to drop hints that don't make sense until after the fact. I surprised boo by saying that we're going somewhere to eat a forest and cappuccino.", "author": "Edna C."}

The presentation was lovely - I'll give it that. I'm not sure if my server failed to give me utensils or I was supposed to eat it without them but that definitely didn't help matters much. To say the crepe was paper-thin would be generous. It was definitely burnt, oily, and flavorless. The spread almost saved it.

Mocoto, San Paulo, Brazil, Le Catandre, Rubano, Italy, Les Maison's de Bricourt, St Metoir des Ondes, France...among others. Small, medium, & large dishes with, please be advised, not so small prices. We started with the Homemade Kamaboko Tempura, 2 skewers, done to perfection & an ideal split for 2. I had the Wasabi Lobster, rolled in a light batter, topped with wasabi panko crunch w/a mango relish, (they call it jelly...) if you like spice & wasabi, this is for you! This is a medium dish, but was surprisingly filling. (Adapted from Tim Raue, Berlin, Germany.) I loved it!!!! More!!! Paired perfectly w/Sequioa, Coastal, Junmai Ginjo, Sake, SF.

Checked it out because it was featured in SF Chronicle's 100 Best Restaurants of 2017. \n\nIt's on the first floor of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), street level, and has a great view of the street side, as one of the walls is entirely glass, with automated shades they can lower at peak points of the day.\n\nI didn't call in a reservation, but we popped in during lunch, around 2 pm, and it wasn't terribly crowded. They offered us either a \"cafeteria style\" long communal table, or a 1-5 minute wait for a table farther from the window. We took the wait, and it was just as short as they had said.\n\nThe cups were of a lovely minimal white ceramic, and the waiter gave us a run-down on the restaurant's concept while he poured. Each dish is chosen from a top chef in the world, and they come from all over. A common complaint on Yelp is that the dishes don't match, or follow each other in a very logical manner, but this isn't really the case, because they're not supposed to.\n\nOrdered a lemon lime kombucha ($8 for a small bottle--fills up about one wine glass)--it was very light and refreshing. Started lunch off with the caramelized carrot soup, which was served in a little double walled espresso shot glass, but was so thick, creamy, and downright delicious that the small size of the soup didn't matter much. Started using the bread we ordered to scoop out the dregs of soup, it was that good.\n\nThe apocalypse burger lettuce wrap was a bit of a let down--the burger was tiny, and served in this coal-looking cracker. Was not too wow-ed with the flavor. The tapioca cheese fritters were a perfect appetizer though. They were light and chewy.\n\nAlso ordered the lamb shank and it was heavenly. I'm not a fan of lamb, but this lamb was seasoned and cooked quite well. The lamb was encased in some kind of noodle-dumpling kind of wrapper (I ought to have read the description more thoroughly), and it was also perfectly cooked--not too chewy and not too soft. It paired well with the greek yogurt and the red sauce on the plate.\n\nFinally, we ordered the \"forest\" risotto. It was so filling, and most definitely a large dish.

Our server was really nice, I wish I got his name, but he had worked his way up from the dishroom to the line/front of house!

She had the carrot soup, the tapioca/cheese fritter, and the risotto. The carrot soup was probably her favorite, as it was PACKED with flavor. The tapioca/cheese fritter was from Brazil and was super casual but delicious. Her risotto was her least favorite, as it was a little dense and very mushroomy. \n\nBecause it was my birthday, I opted for the pricey caviar/lobster/uni small plate.

It was really tasty, but was a little small in portion.\n\nFor the dessert, we had the cheesecake, which was NOT like a cheesecake you have had before.

My husband was still talking about the lamb the next day.  The \"Large\" are the main dishes, and we indulged  in the Risotto - a must for you mushroom lovers (hen of the wood) and the Jokbal Ssam, which is a lettuce wrap with pig trotter.

They also graciously tie into the museum by adding a little blurb of the special exhibits that are currently on display.  Great concept all the way around but I would expect nothing less from Corey Lee.", "author": "Heather D."}

I'm sure if I came on a day where the menu aligns with food preferences, I would've given it more stars, but unfortunately that was not the case for this visit. \n\nI ordered the burger and the glazed chicken thigh dish. They were pretty good but the portions were so small and so expensive.. I'm not usually a stickler for price, but it just wasn't worth it. I literally got a few pieces of chicken and an egg on ice burg lettuce.... the burger was good but SO small.. like two bites small (they did tell us beforehand that it's not shareable). \n\nMy bf got the wasabi lobster and the waiter had told us that it wasn't that \"wasabi-tasting,\" but that's sooo wrong. It was QUITE potent. But the lobster was well cooked, so mixed feelings about that. \n\nMain annoyance was that their iced tea was 9$ (or 6? I forget) but it came in the tiniest glass filled with ice... and guess what... it was not refillable LOL. If you go there, don't order the iced tea.\n\nDespite the disappointing mains, the cheesecake was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten!! It was not a typical cheesecake by all means. It was more like a spreadable sweetish cheese that they served with vanilla cookies. I ate the whole thing. \n\nService was pretty okay and they gave me a mini cake with a candle for my bday which was a plus! However, I did not think the 20% service fee was warranted for a lunch or the service lol.... \n\nI think I'd like to try it again at one point if I'm at MoMa to see if they have different food offerings that I would like.. the menu was just not that great this time.. so sad :(", "author": "Rina P."}

Enjoyed it very much but I can also see why some people don't like it. The restaurant assembled a menu of replicated dishes from famous restaurants and chefs across time and geography (with the chefs permission) sort by size of dish and present it a la carte. We actually researched the menu from the web site in advance and planned what what to order knowing the nature of the dishes, adjusted it with the waiter and it was great.  If I were to sit down and just try to order by the description of the menu, it would get frustrating because some of the price/size ratio is off unless you know how rare some the ingredients is from and how much work it takes to make.   Definitely a food nerd place to eat.  The dishes are not small if you pick the right ones and ask the questions.  Expecting a small dish to be large based on the price doesn't work here because the ingredients and labor on some of small dishes is amazing.", "author": "Kenneth L."}

These tiny dishes can be tasty, but for the most part I thought this place was overhyped. I love the creativity of the dishes, and the way they incorporate different chefs from all over the world into different dishes. However, for the price, I didn't think this was an outstanding meal. \n\nThe only dish that really blew me away were the cheese fritters. The rest of the dishes were pretty good, but really nothing I would NEED in my life. The service was really good, but at that price it better be! Overall, would not come here for an expensive tasting menu (or if you do, hit up in n out afterwards because you will still be hungry and you will be broke).\n\nThe food:\n-coconut foam, caramelized carrot soup($7). This was delicious but served in a tiny little shot glass. I felt this was a bit stingy (come on, it's soup).\n-tapioca and cheese fritters ($14). OMG these were amazing. I'd order these over and over again. Worth a million stars.\n-pine chicken (no longer on menu). Pretty good, well cooked. Quite average though- nothing special about this besides the presentation.\n-crispy crepe with smelt(no longer on menu). Neither of us loved this. Honestly unless you're a smelt lover, just skip this\n-Apocalypse Burger (no longer on menu). We were really curious about this because of the squid ink infused burger \"bun.\" We felt it was OK, but it was gone in about two bites, just not really worth the money.\n-wasabi lobster ($28). This dish is pretty special, and great for wasabi/lobster lovers. The wasabi marshmallows were cool and this dish was beautiful. Probably the only dish that was worth the price.\n-Cheesecake($22). We were probably most excited to try this dish because of the great reviews. However, both of us thought it tasted a little... off? It really didn't taste like cheesecake at all (which is what we were expecting), so maybe we just weren't prepared, but we weren't crazy about it.", "author": "Hannah S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-21", "description": "After reading a newspaper review about this relatively new entry to the SF food scene, I bookmarked it for quite a while.  The combination of the chef/owner (Corey Lee, formerly of dining shrine French Laundry and presently Benu and Monsieur Benjamin) and the innovative theme piqued my interest.  We secured a 545 pm reservation on a recent Friday evening at a cozy two seat table against the left wall.  As my friend used the facilities, my eyes widened in scanning the dining room, then our place settings.  The room has the feel of a creative workshop more than as a restaurant, brightly lit with high ceilings.  After we studied the interestingly designed menus, here's what I tried:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Maine sea scallops \"Black Tie\", shared (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_9ixfePZFVu0wNww5I61tg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - black truffle, puff pastry - Daniel Boulud\nIngenious execution, presentation, and flavor.  At $46.00 for two halves of the largest scallop I've eaten, this is no bargain but certainly worth a try.\n\n\n2) Glazed chicken thigh (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OU6wQ6wLTMvO9qdOdIRWNg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - onsen egg, lettuce, sansho, teriyaki - Hiroshi Sasaki\nBrought me back to my July trip where my horizons broadened in Japan.  Fresh, clean distinct flavors.  Wish the lettuce was more interesting but trust them in preserving the integrity of the dish.\n\nMain\n3)  Piogue a Champlain with foie gras (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Uve2UkrGJyIl4Q4w401vEw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - cheddar, bacon, egg, maple, buckwheat pancake - Martin Picard\nDecadently rich brought me memories of fine dining cuisine.\n\nDessert\n4) Interpretation of variety, shared (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jgr3_kiGWFJV65OpGJV_BQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - moist chocolate cake, cold almond cream, bubbles, and cocoa - Adoni Luis Aduriz\nEye catching, great closer to our meal.\n\nCertainly not a place for large appetites as the portions are relatively modest.  Our waitress was helpful in guiding us through the menu and offering order suggestions.  Water glasses were filled and empty plates quickly removed.  \n\nMy best description is awkward for dining hear.  The cuisine is along the lines of fine dining but in a casual atmosphere.  I get that this restaurant is in an art museum hence the food is presented as works of art.  Maybe it's a generational thing with me, expecting an upscale atmosphere to match the upscale food.  The concept is great in giving locals the opportunity to enjoy various staple dishes from prominent chefs around the globe.

We made a reservation beforehand and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  We decided to order the caramelized carrot soup, the lamb shank manti, the farro piccolo risotto, and the cheesecake for dessert.\n\nThe caramelized carrot soup ($7) was really small (about the size of a shot glass), but it was really delicious.  It was sweet, creamy and had a really nice blend of flavors all around.  \n\nThe lamb shank manti ($18) came with four lamb dumplings with a sauce made of yogurt and tomato sauce.  This wasn't my favorite dish, as I found the flavors to be a bit more generic and lackluster.  \n\nThe farro piccolo risotto ($26) was probably my favorite dish.  It was super flavorful and it was also pretty filling.  It's on the heavier side of things, but this would make a great dish to share for two people!\n\nLastly, the chessecake ($22) was something else.  When I put my utensil into it, I was expecting something hard, but it cut right through the cheesecake really easily.  They have tiny crackers you can put the cheesecake on, and it was such a great experience.  It was kind of like eating cheese and crackers, except way better.  We split a cake amongst three people, so I would highly recommend sharing this dessert with your group.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal that left me satisfied in every way.  Service was super great, the restaurant looked really nice, and the presentation of all the food was great as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "In situ: 1) situated in place or position, 2) synergizing and interacting collaboratively within a context.\n\nIn Situ is not your typical fine dining establishment. One, it resides with SFMOMA, which makes it an exhibition restaurant within an art museum. Two, its aim is to dually showcase the dishes of chefs and restaurants from around the world while subtly highlighting the strength of Benu chef Corey Lee's culinary team to replicate such dishes. For a poetic read on the entire endeavor, I would recommend SF Eater Bill Addison's article (http://www.eater.com/2016/10/6/13187818/the-artistic-genius-of-in-situ). If you were a skeptic, I think he'll change your mind.\n\nMany of the Yelpers I follow are quick to mention the steep price tags, and I can't disagree with them. Most entrees will run you $20-30 easily, with a few hitting $40 something. But, from a logistical standpoint, I wonder if the prices are on the high side because of royalties paid to the original chef or to cover the cost of unique ingredients that these worldly dishes require. The solution may be to go in a small group, no larger than 4 (because the portions are petite, and you want to make sure everyone can taste everything), and not be ravenous when stepping through the door.\n\nThe menu not only lists the food items but also the chef, restaurant, location, and year of the item's conception. Our group's goal was to choose menu items that weren't easily accessible, the exception being the creole BBQ shrimp and grits from Brown Sugar Kitchen in Oakland because we needed another entree but were picky about the wasabi lobster and the foie gras options. Among the 4 of us, we shared an appetizer, 5 entrees, and 1 dessert. I wasn't that hungry, so the portions were just right for me. As for the guys, I'm not sure if it would have been enough ahaha. Without drinks, the meal cost me $50 after tax and tip (20% tip is automatic).\n\n(Appetizer) Crispy crepe, $12, with grilled green garlic jam and preserved smelt from chef Blaine Wetzel and The Willows Inn in Lummi Island, Washington, 2013.\n-We were instructed to smear the jam atop the crepe. The crepe is paper thin but well-accompanied by the flavors in the jam and the crepe toppings. A good duo of flavor and texture.\n\n(Entree) Anis marinated salmon, $28, caviar of flying fish, cucumber jelly, affila cress, pickled ginger from chef Harald Woflfahrt and Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube in Baiersbronn, Germany, 2010.\n-All I remember is that there's a lot going on here hahaha.\n\n(Entree) Creole BBQ shrimp and grits, $24, from chef Tanya Holland and Brown Sugar Kitchen in Oakland, California, 2008.\n-Our heartiest entree for sure. A handful of savory shrimp and sauce served atop a mound of creamy grits. Satisfying, but not mind-blowing.\n\n(Entree) Kalbi jjim, $34, braised beef short rib stew from chef Roy Choi and L.A. Son in Los Angeles, California, 2013.\n-The portion is petite for the price, but the short ribs are oh so tender.\n\n(Entree) Glazed chicken thigh, $22, with onsen egg, lettuce, sansho, and teriyaki from chef Hiroshi Sasaki and Gion Sasaki in Kyoto, Japan, 2015.\n-The raw onsen egg is an interesting touch, but I wasn't impressed overall.\n\n(Entree) The Forest, $28, with quinoa risotto, mushrooms, and parsley \"moss\" from chef Mauro Colagreco and Mirazur in Menton, France, 2011.\n-Gorgeous in presentation and fun to eat. Lots of textural and flavor dimensions.\n\n(Dessert) Jasper Hill Farm cheesecake, $22, with hazelnut, white chocolate, and cookies, from Albert Adri\u00e0 and Tickets in Barcelona, Spain, 2015.\n-Totally unexpected but true to its name. The cheesecake is a mound of soft cheese (brie?) from a creamery in Vermont that is placed atop a crunchy white chocolate base and coated with a layer of hazelnut on top. Dig into that cake of cheese with your knife and spread it on a vanilla wafer. Very curious!\n\nMy highlights? The crispy crepe, the forest, and the Jasper Hill Farm cheesecake. Flavor and texture fo' days.\n\nAs Bill Addison mentions, \"the restaurant affords diners the opportunities to try many dishes that, in their natural habitat, are part of expensive and lengthy tasting menus -- or, in some cases, would require a trip to another country.\" Truly, I can't think of a better \"foodie\" restaurant that fits in the culinary hub that is San Francisco. As for me, this first visit was a spontaneous trip to hang out with our good friends. Next time, I'll do diligent research and aim to hunt for star dishes from around the world.", "author": "Adele F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Dining at In Situ was originally unplanned and unexpected during our SFMOMA visit, but it turned out to be a pleasant and enjoyable experience. A former student from Japan happened to be in town and wanted to spend some time catching up with us in the city. Her Japanese guidebook recommended the SFMOMA as a tourist attraction and highlighted In Situ for its concept of dining around the world in one place. I had been meaning to visit the SFMOMA since it reopened last year, so we made plans to go. I don't normally like to dine at museums, but it seems the in-house restaurants at museums here are getting better. I had been looking up nearby places to eat, but was able to make lunch reservations for the three of us at In Situ so we decided to go for it.\n\nOur server was extremely nice and went over the restaurant concept with us, as well as described each dish. The menu includes a pie chart guide to portion sizes: small, medium, and large (shareable). I had sifted through some of the photos here on Yelp already and had mentally prepared myself for overall tiny portion sizes. (I had packed some trail mix and fruit in my purse just in case I left the restaurant still hungry or needed to refuel after touring the 7 floors of art.) We all decided to each order one dish each, and share desserts.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n* Kalbi Jjim (braised beef short rib stew), $34.00, large/shareable and served with a small bowl of white rice\n* Creole BBQ Shrimp and Grits, $24.00, large/shareable\n* Glazed Chicken Thigh (with onsen egg served over lettuce), $22.00, medium\n* Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart, $16.00, medium\n* Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake served with small cookies, $22.00, large/shareable\n\nMy decision to go with the Kalbi Jjim was based on two things: I love braised short rib, and it seemed like the highest protein/calorie to dollar ratio. The bowl of rice was a welcome surprise, and made the dish feel like a complete and filling meal. I was satisfied but not overly full after eating this dish and my third of the two desserts. My husband enjoyed the shrimp and grits very much, describing it as \"the best he's ever had\". He said it was a hint spicy, and it was filling. Our former student, from Japan, opted for the Japanese dish and said it tasted authentic. I shared some of my rice with her so that her meal would feel more substantial.\n\nYes, portion sizes are small. However, everything we ordered was larger than expected. None of us ate from my snack back until the end of our museum visit.\n\nThe lemon tart was delicious but was more of an ice cream and biscuit type of dish. About the size of 5 bites maybe. The cheesecake was the better of the two, and so creamy!! It is meant to be spread into the cookies. I'm salivating just thinking of the cheesecake. It takes 15 minutes to prepare, so if you want it, let your server know ahead of time.\n\nA 20% service charge is automatically added to the bill. Makes math easy as I did not have to calculate a separate tip. Our total for lunch came out to approximately $150, so $50 per person if you do not order beverages and eat light. A fourth dish if shared amongst us would have probably made the meal feel more complete, and I am sure the dishes would have paired wonderfully with wine. If you go that route, then my estimate is $70-80 per person.\n\nFive stars for service, atmosphere/ambiance, experience, and flavor of food.\n\nThree stars for variety of dishes (the menu is quite small; there are no options to order side dishes, soups or salads; and as others have mentioned, there is no bread service before the meal); portion sizes are also small, but we just so happened to order their larger options; and price per person is a bit much considering the amount of food provided.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe if I wasn't the one paying. ;) It was enjoyable but not a place I'm likely to return to anytime soon. I think for the price per person, I could have eaten at a tapas restaurant and tried more dishes and/or ate more calories.", "author": "Shar M."}

Don't come here if you're looking for large diner size options, but if you're in it for the michelin star allure and value, In Situ lives up to its expectations!\n\nThe restaurant is attached the moma and for a quick glance you'd think it was a upscale coffee shop with its sleek wood tables and minimal decor. \n\nThe restaurant touts the best dishes from chefs/restaurant's all over the world. The menu is broken up into small, medium and large plates. Think palate cleanser, appetizer, and meal sized entrees. They also offer bread for $2 which is donated to charity. It's two pieces of a thick crust wheat bread with soft butter dusted with sesame seeds. If you're dropping a couple hundred for the meal, what's another $2 for the bread? Also, they include a 20% gratuity automatically regardless of service. The waitress was nice, but we did have to wait for a quite a bit when we needed something.\n\nLet's start with the food. We opted for 2 medium sized plates, and 2 entrees. We started with the scallop and pig. Which seems like a odd combination but it works beautifully. The pork was tenderly cooked and the scallops were like butter. The two dances beautifully together with each bite.\n\nNow for the next dish, the lobster with wasabi marshmallow which was by far my favorite dish of the night. Think of a Japanese style shrimp tempura, but replaced with a juicy lobster, incrusted with wasabi and tempura flakes on a mango jelly. The wasabi was extremely powerful but the sting goes away fairly fast. You're in for a explosion of flavor with each bite. \n\nFor the entrees we opted for the lamb shank and risotto. The lamb shank came in momo style dumplings which were a bit on the salty end and served with a tomato puree and yogurt foam. The risotto was a farro taste with a heaping of shaved cheese on top. It was quite earthy and filling.\n\nFinally for dessert we got the chocolate bar with bubbles. It was quite tiny and not very sweet, but more of the taste of the cocoa. If you're not a huge choco lover, I'd skip it. \n\nSince it was my birthday they also gave us a mini coconut vanilla cake with a candle which was quite a treat..\n\nOverall, it was a fun night with a intriguing play on food.", "author": "Bevi K."}

Chef Corey Lee did an amazing job with curating well-known dishes from all over the world.  My understanding is that the menu changes quite often, which is another aspect I can appreciate.  \n\nIt wasn't super difficult for us to get a reservation on a Saturday for lunch.\n\nService was good, but I'd imagine definitely not on-par with some of the Michelin Star restaurants these recipes are curated from (understandable based on this price point).  The server was helpful in providing some of his recommendations.  There were so many dishes we wanted to try on the menu, but narrowed it down the the following:\n\n- Wasabi Lobster- Not for the faint of heart.  The lobster definitely packed a punch of wasabi, which instantly cleared our sinuses.  If you like wasabi, definitely a must-order!  I loved the creativity of the dish, from the lightly fried lobster to the star shaped wasabi marshmallows.\n\n- The Forest- Such a beautiful dish.  Each item on the plate was strategically placed and had its own purpose.  I absolutely love mushrooms and risotto, so this was amazing!\n\n- Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes- Definitely my favorite dish.  I typically do not enjoy Dukbokki, as I think it's a bit too heavy, but the crispiness on the rice cakes made this dish so balanced and perfect!  The minced pork was so flavorful and delicious.  Momofuku Ssam will be a must-visit on our next trip to New York because of this dish.\n\n-Oops I Dropped the Lemon Tart- We watched Chef's Table on Netflix recently, so this dish was on our must-try list.  Massimo Bottura's story behind the dessert was very charming, but I actually didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would.  It was basically a cookie-like crust with some ice cream and lemon curd.  Very good, but not something I would order again.\n\nI'll definitely be returning and am hoping that they'll feature Eric Ripert at some point in the future.", "author": "Michelle M."}

The presentation was impeccable, as was the service. I would come here if you're really excited about a certain dish on the menu, but don't if the price seems a stretch to you.\n\nTHE SPACE\nAn appropriately modern space. Minimalist, clean decor. \n\nTHE SERVICE\nVery professional. The type of place where they make sure every entree is brought out at the same time, where each staff member is very polite. \n\nRESERVATIONS\nMade online for New Year's Eve just a couple weeks in advance. We were a group of 8, dining at 5:30pm. They actually weren't booked up - there were a few empty tables for dinner. For this large of a group, you are in a communal table. \n\nCOST\nAbout $80 a person total, including tax/tip. This came out to an average of 1 drink, 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and almost 1 dessert per person.\n\nMUST-HAVES\nThe Liberty Duck Breast was a popular dish, and the smoky flavor was amazing - again though, note the $32 price tag. Every main that people got was really good. On the desserts, people loved the \"Oops! I dropped the Lemon Tart\" and the Cheesecake. \n\nTHE FOOD\n* Apocalypse Burger ($14) - 4 stars\nEveryone was intrigued by this. It didn't look appetizing, but the meat was great. \n\n* Liberty Duck Breast ($32) - 4 stars\nAmazing smoky flavor to the duck. Just quite overpriced for what it is! \n\n* The Forest ($28) - 4 stars\nMy one bite was great! \n\n* Creole BBQ Shrimp & Grits ($24) - 4 stars\nHad 1 bite: beautifully creamy grits & a big kick of flavor w/ the shrimp. \n\n* Kalbi Jjim ($34) - 4 stars\nIncredibly tender beef. Probably the best plain white rice I've had. Again, just pricey! \n\nDESSERT\n* Oops! I dropped the Lemon Tart ($16) - 4 stars\nVery delicious. The spread of spices is interesting to taste w/ this! \n\n* Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake ($22) - 4 stars\nThe biggest surprise of the desserts. This cheesecake was amazing! Soft, dense texture, and a good balance of sweet & savory. No one could quite put their finger on what made it so good, but we all agreed we really liked it.\n\n* Interpretation of Vanity ($16) - 3.5 stars\nThis is about 70% aesthetics. The rest is good - tasty, velvety chocolate.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-10", "description": "The idea of In Situ is great. You get to try dishes from chefs from all around the world and you're still sitting there in a restaurant inside a museum in gloomy ol' SF. The place looks like some coffee shop but without the music and background noises. If the idea of this restaurant is executed correctly, you're paying a small fee to eat around the globe, in lieu of all these airfare and hotel costs. Nonetheless, the bill gets pretty hefty at this place, star chef here, collaboration there, 20% service charge here, BOOM.\n\nI came here an hour before closing with my home girl, we didn't get seated at the restaurant area, only the lounge area was available at that time. The menu at the lounge was small, with 4 appetizers and 2 main dishes. Lots of drinks available but I wasn't in the mood for any when I was still nursing my cough. \n\nWe ended up ordering buttermilk fried chicken with pine salt and spicy pork sausage rice cake. The fried chicken dish was from London. Plating was just gorgeous, but it's hard to justify 5 pieces of chicken nuggets laying in a basket with pine leaves and cone. But these little nuggets were well prepared. Crispy yet tender with a soft aroma of pine sweeping up to your nose. It's like Christmas part 2, but I'm not convinced how this dish is marked as medium sized and shareable. I dropped my expectations then.\n\nThe rice cake from Momofuku Ssam came along, picture will not do this dish any justice, It's minced pork over some white cube looking things. Usually rice cake are straight up chewy, like Shanhainese rice cakes stir fried like a noodle dish or Dukbokki. I didn't expect the rice cake to be a bit hard on the outside like it was toasted, then chewy in the inside. It was bomb. The sausage wasn't too salty, there's a good kick to it. I wasn't sure if it was really spicy or my throat was just being sensitive at that time. Makes me want to plan a trip to NY and try this place out ASAP. This dish looked small for a \"large\" course, but was definitely filling. \n\nWhat I did not like is the forced 20% service charge. It's a high percentage and I did not feel like the service was worth it. Perhaps it was near end of the day, the attention was sparse. If they want to charge the 20%, they have to make it up for the customers to feel neglected. Although the place closed for last orders, visitors from the museum still walked in and no staffs were on the floor to let them know restaurant was closed for the day. \n\nStill, I would go back especially when their menu changes.", "author": "Connie C."}

Alas, as I have come to the realization that I am more of a serendipitous diner, I will make a review of what I ordered the last time, and proceed accordingly. Thank goodness I wrote some preliminary notes.  \n\nNote that the premise of In Situ is to extend the art concept into food. Each offering on the menu is a dish chosen from a Michelin-starred restaurant somewhere in the world, and I'll indicate the restaurant of the dish I ordered for your perusal. Anyway, if you're into optimizing value when it comes to food, this place is not for you.\n\n\"Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Pine Salt\", $12, 5pcs, basket of pine leaves and two pinecones. Isaac McHale, The Clove Club: The arrangement of pine leaves and pinecones serve as a nest for 5 small pieces of fried chicken in place of eggs. Visually, it's stunning. I almost thought it was Christmastime with the way it was arranged. From a food perspective, it was alright. Buttermilk and seasoning were on point, but in the end, I just can't get my mind around the fact that it is essentially royally glorified chicken nuggets.\n\n\"Ice Cream of Salted Butter\", $8, hazelnut, molasses. Esben Holboe Bang, Maaemo, Oslo, Norway 2010: Again, visuals are perfect. There was enough molasses to provide a sweet twist to the vanilla ice cream. It could do without the hazelnut dust on it though, but that's just my preference. \n\n20% service fee automatically added.\n\nI definitely want to come back here for a dinner session one of these days.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-26", "description": "Prelude:\n\nIn Situ does not present itself with a smiley face.  After reading reviews on Yelp and glowing reports like the Mercury News's article http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/16/review-is-in-situ-the-most-high-concept-restaurant-in-san-francisco/ , I went to Opentable to make a reservation for a get-together that I was planning with three friends.  When Situ requested a credit card number to hold the reservation, I typed in the required digits after only a few moments of hesitation.  Two nights before our planned dinner, I discovered that I'd inadvertently reserved for two people instead of four.  I attempted to rectify the situation by phoning the restaurant.\n\nMajor fail: As I learned by phoning the number listed for In Situ, the only way to communicate with the restaurant is via email.  I was thus faced with the stressful possibility of incurring a late-cancellation fee on my credit card and could not learn immediately whether or not my reservation could be modified, or at least cancelled without penalty.  I tried to modify my reservation on Opentable but was directed by the Opentable screen to send email to info@insitusf.com.  My sense of stress increased after my two messages to info@insitusf.com bounced!  I then consulted In Situ's web site and learned that the correct address is info@insitusf.org, rather than info@insitusf.com.  (I was then able to inform the restaurant by email that Opentable had their address wrong.  I hope that the problem has now been corrected.)\n\nAfter writing to the correct address, I waited for about 20 hours before getting a reply to the effect that these people would modify my reservation.  OK, so we were on, but shouldn't restaurants always be willing to speak with their customers?  Isn't communication supposed to be a big part of the fine dining scene?  Don't chefs claim to want a dialog with their diners?  In this situation, things did get resolved via email -- we were able to come as a group of four -- but In Situ's refusal to answer the phone made me worry that I wouldn't be well received when I walked in the door.  And, seriously, there's no way to phone the host when you're on your way to In Situ but your BART train is stopped for a police action?\n\nAnother thing that stood out for me before I arrived is that In Situ's 248 Yelp reviews included only two from my Yelp friends.  Actually, one of those friends is Nish N., who isn't exactly my BFF: He was described in 2010 (when he left Yelp) as \"one of the earliest upper-level hires at Yelp and the ostensible social `face' of the company.\"  He has 4450 friends on Yelp, and I happen to be among them.  So who dines at In Situ?  Apparently not very many local foodies.  I viewed this as a bad sign -- strike two!\n\nI found their web site -- http://insitu.sfmoma.org -- to be pretentious, uninformative and hard to navigate.  I learned, at least, that \"$1 from each [apocalypse] burger goes towards food related carbon offsets through ZeroFoodprint.\"  (Editorial comment: use a hyphen in \"food-related.\")  The web site was strike three, and I hadn't even set foot in the restaurant!\n\nThe meal:\n\nWhen I arrived at In Situ, I detected immediately that it was not a happening place.  There were lots of empty tables, and no buzz or energy.  It's true that the decor is cheery, elegant and subdued, and the personnel were very accommodating.  Nonetheless, I did not feel the excitement that characterizes a happening restaurant.  The menus that we were handed were paper versions of the online menu that I had seen.  Each dish on the menu has one or two letters next to it -- the letters correspond to the wines that are listed alongside.  In other words, there are suggested pairings for each dish; for example, sake is the beverage that goes with the cuttlefish cappuccino.\n\nMy dinner consisted of the Glazed Chicken Thigh and the Kalbi Jjim.  In addition, I was able to taste the profiteroles and the wasabi lobster that my dining companions had ordered.  I drank the unique ros\u00e9 and the unique grenache that were on the menu.  The chicken thigh did take me out of my usual loop, and I liked both of my dishes -- within limits.  But neither sent my senses soaring.\n\nThe wines average around $17 a glass, as other reviewers have pointed out.  My two dishes added up to $56.  Taking into account the ~10% tax and the 20% charge in lieu of a gratuity, you'll see that I spent around $117 for my dinner.\n\nIn Situ is thus no great bargain.  It's very comfortable and has a pleasant ambiance.  I'm sort of glad that I tried it, but I am not eager to return.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

In that respect, In Situ inside San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art sounded almost too good to be true. Led by the acclaimed chef Corey Lee from the three-Michelin star institution Benu, the concept of this constantly evolving project that opened last year is to aggregate dishes from chefs around the world. In a way, you may argue there is no originality if what In Situ does is merely copycat dishes. I beg to differ; the kitchen still needs to execute the recipes they receive from others and put them into a coherent meal. For that, I'm happy to report that the dinner my wife Jun and I had before the end of our Bay Area trip had a lot of pleasant surprises.\n\nThe portion of dishes at In Situ is on the smaller side and meant for sharing. Perhaps too small so that our dining party of four (which included and I and another couple from one of my longtime friends) had to mostly order two dishes each. That didn't mean I didn't enjoy the creamy cuttlefish cappuccino with potato and braised cuttlefish buried inside squid ink (a product of an acclaimed restaurant in Italy called Le Calandre). I absolutely loved sharing this appetizer dish that came in a little jar with Jun, and the complexity of flavor led me to believe our dinner would be a good one. Jun was initially hesitant to try the crispy crepe of grilled scallion jam and preserved smelt (from The Willows Inn at a remote island in the State of Washington) thinking the smelt would give too salty sensation but it actually turned out that the seasoning was not overpowering so we gladly nibbled at the dish too. The marinated salmon with caviar of flying fish from Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube in Germany was forgettable, but I can't stop thinking about the wasabi lobster from the famed chef Tim Raue in Berlin (who was also recently featured in Netflix Chef's Table documentary series). Initially, the kick of wasabi seemed to be overpowering, but over time the wasabi seamlessly blended into the crunchy lobster to give a very addictive flavor that was very much hard to stop. This dish, I think I would've gladly eaten by myself without sharing with Jun! For the last savory course, a plate called the \"forest\" (a combination of quinoa risotto, mushrooms and parsley \"moss\") from the famed Mirazur restaurant in France offered quite a nice end to the meal with its delicate texture and great balance of flavor. For desserts, the most disappointing one was this fancy looking dish called \"interpretation of vanity\" from Spain's trailblazer Mugaritz known for pushing the envelope in gastronomy. The amorphous combination of moist chocolate cake with bubble and cocoa didn't add up much. On the other hand, eton mess was predictably delicious and I was very glad to find out that the best dessert came from a restaurant that I absolutely enjoyed when I visited Barcelona. Tickets' farm cheesecake with hazelnut, white chocolate and cookie not only looked pretty but it really gave such a delightfully sweet flavor that I couldn't stop digging at the dish while everyone else was becoming full!\n\nGetting a reservation at In Situ didn't seem too difficult, which was surprising given the high profile of the chef leading the kitchen and the novel concept of the restaurant. One principal issue that I had with the restaurant was the wine list, which unfortunately consists exclusively of natural and organic varieties to my great shock and disappointment (with all these great dishes, why not have some normal wines!). I liked the light, open dining space that was playful and fitting for a restaurant inside a museum. I would love to come back to In Situ to see how the kitchen evolves over time. It's almost like a treasure hunt where you don't know what you expect to see with the constantly changing dishes from different culinary influences around the world. Perhaps New York can come up with a creative model like this in the near future?", "author": "Ken S."}

And it's not because I'm blind when it comes to his creations, but the results are just that good. In case you don't know, In Situ is Corey's third restaurant. It's part of the newly renovated SF MOMA and the theme is museum within a restaurant. \n\nInstead of filling the menu with his original concoctions, he recreates famous dishes from across the world. Famous chefs such as David Chang, Thomas Keller, and Rene Redzepi have contributed to In Situ's decorated menu.\n\nThe dining room is reservation only and the lounge is first come, first serve. The menus are different (with the lounge menu being on the cheaper end), so you'll still be able to experience what In Situ has to offer without shelling out a lot of money. Also, reservations can be hard to come by, but on a Sunday night, the lounge was mostly empty. So that's a good option.\n\nThe decor is very modern and minimalist. Service, however, is warmer and more approachable. With the exception of our server (she was kind of aloof and inattentive), everyone else was impeccable. That seems like an outlier, so I won't fault them too much for it.\n\nAs for food, here is what we got:\n\nCarrot, Sour Curd, Pickled Pine: The carrot was amazing! With the sour curd and pickled pine, the umami of the carrot was further enhanced. Fascinating dish!\n\nShrimp Grits, Pickled Jalapeno: This was extremely delicious. The use of the shrimp heads for the oil was awesome. We do that a lot in Chinese cuisine to coax more flavor out of the shrimp. The grits was full of umami flavor!\n\nLiberty Duck Breast: It's hard not to get something from Thomas Keller. Although the execution was perfect, this was the most lackluster dish of the night... and that's only because everything else was spectacular. There was nothing wrong with this dish -- for all intents and purposes, it was delicious. But it didn't surprise me like the other ones.\n\nThe Forest: I would've never gotten this if it was my choice, based on the description. But I'm glad I tried it. It looked, smelled, and tasted like the forest. I never knew so many green things could be so delicious and evoke forest imagery solely based on taste. I highly recommend this to try!\n\nSpicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes: This was delicious as well. The rice cakes were slightly crispy, which was awesome because it made the dish so much more interesting. The meat, of course, was delicious. And the use of szechuan peppercorns was ingenious. Not only did it make the dish slightly spicy, the numbing effect was an interesting textural experience as well.\n\nChocolate Cake with Cocao Bubbles: This was an amazing dessert. It wasn't super sweet, as you'd expect a chocolate dessert to be. It was actually slightly savory, which contrasted the sweetness and richness very well. It went great with the wine pairing that is suggested by the menu.", "author": "Sherry L."}

He explained to me that In Situ is Corey Lee's (from Benu-3 Michelin stars) new eclectic menu restaurant and how it was like a rotating collection of menu items from some of the best restaurants around the world! It was like you could sample some of many different restaurants, some that you may not even be able to visit. I was definitely intrigued.\n\nWe opted for lunch, though I want to come back and try the bar now. We got the shrimp grits, which Morris told me he tried at his last meal and was one of his favorites. It definitely has heavy shrimp flavor in the grits and a little bit of jalapeno paired nicely with it. I liked the texture and savory flavors and I would probably order this again. \n\nNext we got the glazed chicken thigh with the onsen egg. Honestly, slightly underwhelming and tasted just kind of like teriyaki chicken with a very well cooked soft boiled egg along with it. \n\nThomas Keller's Liberty Duck Breast from TFL was the star and honestly AMAZING. I'd order this again and not share with anyone haha. The duck was moist, succulent and had a little crunch to the skin. \n\nAnd to fill up, we got David Chang's spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. It had a lot of szechuan flavors and was pretty spicy actually. A lot of interesting crunchy and chewy textures as the rice cakes were browned to some crispy degree. I enjoyed this dish minus having to dig out some rice cake pieces stuck to my back teeth.\n\nLunch was pretty easy to snag a spot and you can try the lunch menu or bar menu, which are different and probably both worth trying. The bar menu is slightly cheaper. The menu comes with little diagrams of portion size, advising you how shareable it is as some of these are tapas-ish.

Just like museums bring art, science, and history from all over the world, Corey Lee of Benu fame strives to do the same through food.  Every dish on the menu pays homage to another famous chef.  I came here for lunch without reservations and was lucky to find an open spot in the Dining room.  The restaurant has both Dining and Lounge area, both with different menus. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to mix and match!  Guess they want you to come back to try both!\n\nI ordered a 3-course lunch for $80 (including tip and tax).  Definitely pricey, but its a nice light lunch and a nice culinary adventure.  My two mains are from NYC, while I went to Italy for dessert.  Speaking of NYC, If you are willing to fly to there, $80 will give you a wonderful 3-course lunch at 3-Michelin Star Le Bernardin.  \n\nShrimp Grits: From Wylie Dufresne - smooth grits with some strong shrimp oil and jalape\u00f1os.  Guess they liquefied the shrimp since the texture was all grits.  I actually liked the flavors.\n\nSpicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes - excellent dish from David Chang of Momofuku Ssam Bar.  The Sichuan peppercorns added some serious heat.  I also liked the rice cakes - nice crusty seared exterior, and soft and chewy interior.  \n\nLemon Tart - This dessert looked like it was dropped on the plate with lemon curd leaking out.  That's all by design of course.  Pretty good dessert to neutralize the spiciness from my main course.  Ice Cream and Lemon Curd go well together.  \n\nOverall, 3.5 stars rounding up to four.  Pretty good service and the restaurant concept is cool.  I liked how the Lounge has complementary dishes to the Dining Room.  For example, Nathan Myhrvokd's carrot soup and Roy Choi's Ketchup fried rice.", "author": "Daniel C."}

We had made an earlier reservation for the restaurant - I believe for the Lounge, a reservation is not necessary. The restaurant layout is rather stark but like modern decor.  This is an interesting concept insofar as they have partnered with about 15 famous (Michelin star) chefs from around the world featuring their specific dishes. \n\nWe ordered the Wasabi Lobster ($24) created by Tim Rauhe of the Restaurant Tim Rauhe in Berlin. My wife really did enjoy this dish - it was prepared with mango jelly, Thai vinaigrette and pieces of marshmallow. Visually beautiful and an explosion of flavors - highly recommended. \n\nI took the Umami Soup ($38)  by Hisato Nakahigashi at the Miyamasou in Kyoto prepared with miso marinated wagyu and inaniwa udon. The menu description also called for asparagus butI could not detect it. Overall an Ok dish but I found the broth to be somewhat flavorless and not memorable. The wagyu was delicious and clearly this accounted for the rather heft price of this dish. We also ordered two of their Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale which, although expensive at$13 for  a bottle, was delicious - beer lovers should take advantage of this.\n\nThe service was prompt but impersonal and should have focused more on explaining the rather complicated menu layout to first time visitors. I can understand why some guests have taken exception to the automatic 20% tip which may explain the somewhat cavalier attitude by our server. As an aside, our meal took about 40 minutes even though we did not feel rushed. Another observation, the tables are quite close together, so much that we asked to be seated at another table because the couple next to ours were annoyingly loud.\n\nIn summary:\nFood  - 4.5\nAmbience - 3\nService- 4\nOverall - 4\n\nAnd we will be back, considering that this venture is new and hopefully is still working out its kinks.\n\nUpdate \nYou can see that we do love this place as we visited for a third time on March 2, 2017. We both shared the Crispy Crepe with preserved smelt and green garlic jam and enjoyed it so much that we started discussing how soon we should make a trip to the Willows Inn on Lummi Island, WA. My wife then ordered the Kalbi Jim from Roy Choi which she enjoyed but was surprised that it lacked sufficient seasoning. \n\nI am a fan of Foie Gras and therefore opted for the Plogue a Champlain with Foie Gras which disappointed me somewhat. The Foie Gras was exceptional but I would say less is more - the addition of the bacon, cheese, egg and buckwheat pancake takes away from the simplicity of the Foie Gras. Lastly, and this is the icing on the proverbial cake, we ordered the Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake by Albert  Adria of Tickets in Barcelona which we had visited last year. Do not miss this! I am generally not a fan of cakes or sweets but this blew me away - by the way, it takes at least 20 minutes to prepare so, make up your mind early!\n\nOverall, as before, excellent service and a memorable meal. \n\nWe had our monthly In Situ fix - August has brought a slightly changed menu. I had the Cebiche Del Armor - a very delicious ceviche - highly recommended. This was followed by the Summery Warm Tomato and Basil tart and my usual- highly recommended - Jasper Hill Cheesecake from Tickets. My wife had the Jokbal Ssam - lettuce wrap with pig's trotter  which was great tasting! Again, an enjoyable visit.", "author": "Thomas C K."}

A big part of the appeal of this restaurant is the experience--from the unique design of the menus to the place setting and silverware. And of course--the food is definitely a hit as well! I came for dinner with a group of three and we were seated with our reservation in the dining room.\n\nWe started off with an order of the apocalypse burger, which was basically a cheeseburger in a hollowed-out black shell, encased in a lettuce wrap with tomato, onion, and aioli. While the plating was definitely unique, I didn't find the flavor of the dish particularly interesting or memorable. But then we moved on to the entrees--the braised short rib stew was savory and delicious; it was served with a bowl of rice, and the tender short rib simply fell apart in the dark broth (though the portion size was pretty small for the price). My favorite dish of all was the Forest, which was a mixture of sauteed mushrooms (mostly maitakes and king trumpets), a savory quinoa risotto, and parsley \"moss\" (basically foam). Every bite of this dish was delicious--the mushrooms added so many different textures, and the flavors exploded in your mouth!\n\nAnd then came the desserts. These dishes definitely had the best, most beautiful plating (each was a work of art!), and I was so impressed by the creativity displayed. We started with the Oops I Dropped the Lemon Tart, which was a cold lemon-flavored sherbet covered with a tart-like wafer and a lemony syrup. This was my favorite dessert, as the flavors were deliciously light and refreshing! The cheesecake was shaped as a small wheel of cheese, and just like a wheel of cheese, you cut a wedge and ate it on a little cookie! So creative! Finally, we had the Interpretation of Vanity, a moist chocolate cake covered with chocolate bubbles. While this dish looked quite impressive, the chocolate flavor was a bit overpowering and heavy. Yes, if you're counting, we ordered all three desserts on the menu, and I'm definitely glad we did!\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic restaurant with unique, delicious, and above all, creative dishes. The service was nice, and the decor was beautiful. The prices, however, were definitely a little high for the portion sizes (especially given the automatic 20% service charge), but certainly worth the experience.", "author": "David K."}

Not to say it's the same, but why not taste test first. Benu would be a much lengthier dinner. In Situ did not disappoint. Everything carefully crafted. Beautiful dinnerware, menu, ceilings and floors... gender inclusive restrooms...wine list... each plate intentionally designed. \n\nI choose the dishes from chefs I've eaten at and enjoyed. There were several that sounded intriguing but I didn't really enjoy the chef's style at their original establishment. \n\nThe shrimp and grits from WD50 had amazing shrimp flavor. I'm a big seafood fan so this dish was heavenly. It's not really grits but shrimp and corn made to taste and have texture like grits. Fun!\n\nThe French Laundry Liberty Duck breast with lentils. Really well executed, meaning the duck was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. Nothing overpowering so you taste the rich meaty duck. The skin was not a crispy skin but a softer skin, but did not feel greasy and mushy. The perfect bite is with all the savory components. \n\nBoth dishes were decadent and on point. Michelin star just won some brownie points back. \n\nThe service though. They charge a 20% but are so deserving of it. Many fine dining restaurants are charging the mandatory 20 nowadays.

One Michelin star(so weird how a French tire company rose to be arbiter of what's cool in restrauntdom!). Blah Blah Blah, but does it live up to the hype? Yes, but not because any one particular dish rises to the level of religious experience, but because of a multitude of factors. \n\nOn the 1st floor of SF MOMA, it's a nice basecamp for exploring the SOMA museums(MOAD, Jewish contemporary, Berggruen gallery, Yerba Buena Gardens etc.) and Union Square. It's near BART and has it's own parking garage on Minna st. It serves lunch when most of the high end SOMA restaurants do not. It's just so damn convenient when visiting the beyond awesome SF MOMA. In Situ has huge windows and very comfortable seating. Reservations were easy on open table. Service was friendly and prompt. Waitress was knowledgeable.\n\nOn to the food. The menu is pretty cool. Its like a scantron with a wine paring marked with a letter or letters with dishes that correspond with wines on the back of the menu. There's also a blurb about what restaurant each of dishes came from along with info about the chef.\nI started with the carmelized carrot soup with chaat masala. The portion was small...about the size of a lungo, but damn was it good. I didn't have a spoon so I started to lick the bowl/cup clean after drinking all the soup.  Next came the Turkish lamb dumplings with tomato sauce and some type of cream and sumac. These were amazing and sizable(4 dumplings) for a minimalist restaurant. Main dish was a Korean lettuce wrap of pig trotter. Sounds bad, but they've already removed the meat and fat from the hoof and all you have to do is wrap it in the lettuce. It came with a fermented barley and a pickled sesame leaf to put on the the pork. Definitely a good combo. The dessert was the star of the show. I had a parsnip mousse with apples with a candied/crispy parsnip skin. Outstanding flavor combo.\n\n*Don't order the apocalypse burger lettuce wrap. It's tiny like a burger bite.

You'd have to travel the world to get all these things but instead you can come enjoy them all in one. \n\nI have a few things I can't stop thinking about: Apocalypse burger. It's the best because it has no buns. Instead it's this charcoal crispy cracker thing that has a meat and cheese inside, the rest is outside sitting in a piece of lettuce that you take and wrap up the entire thing in. So it's a bit of a lettuce wrap but still much better because of the crisp cracker inside. It's served with a side of aioli and it's just great. \nAnother thing I can't stop thinking about is the carrot coconut soup that is served espresso sized. I could drink a bowling ball of that stuff. It's so perfectly well rounded and comforting. Pretty sure I licked the very tiny cup clean. \nNext, the tapioca and cheese fritters. I could eat those all day long. Chewy and crispy at the same time, and served piping hot. So wonderful. \n\nStaff is amazing there. The ambiance is wonderfully chic, with the perfect art on the walls.

In one night, you get to try dishes from acclaimed chefs from all over the world. Did it rock my world?  Like any rock festival, there's the VIP seating (the main dining room) and the rest of the area for the plebs (the lounge area) who jealously stare at all of the dishes we can't eat. My experience is only limited to the lounge area, so it wasn't as good as it could have been. But I will be back for the main stage soon. \n\nThe only upside to the lounge menu is that it's short enough where you can almost try everything in one seating. My only gripe is the chilly wind tunnel that occurs every single time the front door is open. A little distracting, but not a deal killer. \n\nPlates are meant to be shared for the most part.  The only exception is the caramelized carrot soup which is the size of a shot glass. It is very, very thick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-02", "description": "When I heard the concept for this restaurant, I knew I had to try it! Basically, they work in collaboration with famous chefs all around the world to recreate and serve their dishes, all in one convenient location on the ground floor of the MOMA in SF.\n\nSeeing it, the design of the restaurant is right at home in the MOMA. From the huge tree-like door to the sleek lines of the furnishing and light fixtures, everything looks like art itself. Everything from the plates and silverware, to the menu, to the furniture breathed modern art.\n\nThe wait staff seemed pretty attentive as well. All were trained on the background of each dish as well recommendations. Our waitress even informed us about which dishes were finger food, saving us the embarrassment of awkward silverware handling.\n\nNow the food. Every time a new dish came out, it was greeted with a chorus of awed \"wooooooow...\"s from our table. Normally I don't review each item I order, but I feel like it would be criminal not to for this place.\n\nCrispy Crepe -\nLike all the dishes, the presentation was gorgeous! Taste-wise, the crepe was salty and yoi could definitely taste the garlic in the spread that came on the side. All together, REALLY good flavor, and definitely the perfect way to start our meal. \n\nApocalypse Burger - \nOur waitress recommended that we order one each of this, as it wasn't a very large bite. We took her advice, and definitely don't regret it. When it came out, we noticed the presentation immediately. Instead of a bun, the burger is served in a small black shell - meant to look like a piece of charcoal - resting in a lettuce leaf with cherry tomatoes and pickle slices. It all made sense after the waiter explained the story behind the dish. The chef is apparently a huge advocate for the environment, and specifically focuses on reducing restaurant carbon emissions. Every time one of these burger is ordered, $1 of the proceeds go to a charity organization fighting excess carbon emissions. The dish, mimicking a piece of charcoal, is meant to remind the customer of these critical issues. The social statement struck me pretty strong. I'm a strong supporter of environment conservation, and the idea that someone was using his talents towards bettering the world like that, in any way he could, is really moving. \n\nAs for the taste, the burger patty was A+. The sauce served on the side was incredibly creamy and buttery. What really brought the dish together for me were the sweet pickles and the tomatoes. The sweetness of those elements was the perfect harmony to the the deliciously juicy melody of the burger.  Although the dish was a bit messy, I highly recommend it!\n\nKalbi Jjim - \nthe Kalbi Jjim was essentially a beef bone broth served with rice. This dish had the most lackluster plating of the dishes we chose, but it made up for all of that by being the most delicious of the night. First off, the rice was cooked perfectly - not too dry, not too sticky. But the broth. The broth was packed with so much flavor, I hardly thought it was possible! It was super savory and my party drank it to the last drop. The beef was super tender and fell apart easily. I'm not a huge beef fan, but I found myself going back for more after the first bite. There were also chestnuts and mushrooms in the broth, but I feel like they didn't add very much to the dish. \n\nThe Forest-\nFirst off, this dish was probably the most immersive experience of the night. With sprigs of thin mushroom acting as wild grass, potatoes as stones, and parsley moss, it's obvious why the dish is called The Forest. I thought the forest magic would end there, but I was dead wrong. The cream sauce in the risotto was wow. Just wow. The mushrooms and potatoes seasoned to perfection. I didn't know what to think about the parsley. It had a weird texture that I'm still not sure about. However, the strangest thing about the dish was just how FOREST-y it tasted. My whole table agreed that we could see the trees and smell the moss with every bite. You have to like mushrooms if you're going to go for this dish, but honestly, even if you don't like mushrooms, it's almost worth trying just for the magical forest adventure that comes with the dish. \n\nOops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart! - \nVisually, this dish was gorgeous! I had heard of deconstructed desserts earlier this year, and was pretty excited that I would get to try it. The dessert is served with an array of savory spices, which was strange. Even after eating them the way that our waitress recommended, I was not a fan. The lemon custard, however, was delicious, although started to taste a bit bitter towards the end. I still don't know what flavor the ice cream was, unfortunately. I probably won't be ordering this the next time I come, but the others I came with loved it, so it might be a personal preference. \n\nGreat experience!

Luckily, I gave the the dining room a shot and enjoyed my second visit greatly. I loved six of the seven dishes I tasted, and the cocktails were excellent.\n\nUni, Fresh Nori, Panko - Yum. Wonderful texture contrast of the uni and panko. There was something bright, perhaps yuzu, that meshed beautifully with the other flavors.\n\nShrimp Grits - One of my favorite Southern dishes, and this version did not disappoint. Great texture - creamy, but still defined grits. Hearty shrimp flavor with pickled jalape\u00f1os being a nice touch.\n\nOctopus and the Coral - Came with a side of broth that we poured into the dish. The broth was my favorite part and had good heat. The braised octopus was tender. I could have done without the shrimp chip like cracker which became gummy.\n\nSpicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes - I love rice cakes. This was next level rice cakes! Seared on the top and bottom, the cakes were so satisfying to chew on. Good level of spice on this dish.\n\nGuinea Fowl Larp Chiang Mai - My favorite of the meal. Super spicy, yet still distinctly complex in flavor. Served with raw veggies to help cool the palate. That heat is no joke.\n\nMeyer Lemon Ice Cream and Sherbet - I prefered the sherbet slightly more, but my dining partner preferred the ice cream. Both had a velvety smooth texture and bright lemon flavor. Came with a tasty gingersnap.\n\nInterpretation of Vanity - The only let down. The interesting presentation was reminiscent of something you might find in a biology textbook. Unfortunately the chocolate cake itself was forgettable.\n\nTake Note:\n-Service was slow, both our drinks and food took a while to arrive.\n-Plan to spend $100+ to be full, with 20% gratuity automatically included.\n-The table didn't get the cocktail menu by default, we had to ask for it. Wine, beer, and liquor are listed in the dining menu.\n\nLOUNGE REVIEW\n\nI made dining room reservations one month in advance to secure a weekend lunch. One month is a long time to wait though, so I tried the walk-in lounge first. The lounge features a separate menu of small bites between $6-$16, with the $32 Croque Astrance being the splurge. The affordable prices are misleading, because you'll need 3-4 of these dishes to fill up.\n\nFor a $50 lunch without drinks, I want to be satisfied. But I was disappointed at the lounge menu. I was surprised because I'm a Corey Lee fan, and I really wanted to love In Situ. With the exception of the Caramelized Carrot Soup, the other dishes lacked the wow factor I expect at this caliber of dining.\n\nThe good: \nCaramelized Carrot Soup - The shot glass was a perfect size to showcase this decadent soup.

This is first and foremost a unique culinary adventure traveling around the world. This is important to understand - you're not here just to eat, you're here for a small glimpse into the mind of the chefs who created these culinary masterpieces. Each dish has a story behind it, a theme to its ingredients and presentation, all woven together. While not every dish had components or flavors that suited my own tastes, In Situ deserves a well-earned 5/5. Come here if you're a foodie, adventorous, or interested in appreciating food as ART. Do NOT come here if the only thing you're looking for is to fill your stomach (prices are rather high).  Oh ya, not to overlook this but - service was excellent. Hopefully they receive one Michelin star next year!\n\nI felt everything was prepared to absolute perfection, and I assume, exactly to what that chef intended it to taste like and appear as. \n\nThe Forest - sooooo good. This is a must order. You must try it before they take it off the menu!!!!!! Definitely feels like a walk through the forest. A gorgeous variety of mushrooms cooked to perfection to bring out each individual flavor over a lovely quinoa risotto. Parsley moss was a clever addition and also nice. This dish feels like the forest floor after a rain shower. Yup. You heard right.\n\nOops! I dropped a lemon tart - playful presentation, you should order it for the experience. Flavor-changing condiments on the side was creative and pretty cool. The \"tart\" actually contains a lemongrass gelato which is a nice refreshing flavor. By the way, the little things on the side actually DO change the flavor, my favorites were the chili oil and the candied lemon with beramot. \n\nChocolate cake - the most special part of this was the visual presentation with cocoa bubbles.\n\nCheesecake - this was some hybrid of savory and sweet together. The cookies were soooo good but I personally didn't like the cheesecake itself, it's like a brief cheese encased in hazelnut white chocolate. I suppose if you're the type who likes cheese to round off your meal, this'll be the perfect post-meal dish!\n\nCappuccino came in a cute glass plate+cup. Order! Nice bold, dark flavor \n\nNote to those with celiac: they do have quite a few gluten free dishes! They try their best to accommodate even though no modifications alllowed. Some are naturally gluten free while some others you can eat around the gluten-containing ingredient", "author": "Melody L."}

The idea behind this is to recreate dishes from the worlds great chefs! I love it!!! It's like traveling the world dish by dish. Again I'm surprised by the low rating on Yelp. I've heard enough elsewhere to know this would be great & it was. Very elegant casual setting again showcasing the food. Very attentive service, not at all pretentious. Now for the food aaah just thinking about it makes me want to go again. It's a seasonal type menu. Started with a daiquiri :) We got some plates to share. I had to try the shrimp grits as I've been watching Wylie Dufresne for years on TV the guy is a mad food genius. His recipe delivered. There was jalape\u00f1o & I think scallions to balance the rich shrimp oil. I'm not a big seafood lover but this, I loved. Ok next it was the apocalypse burger, I didn't really know what to expect & honestly when it was put before me didn't quite know what to do with it. There was lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle on the dish & a charcoal briquette???? What? What? The server said to open it and put the aoli on the burger, what. The briquette was a cracker housing one of the best burgers ever!!!! This was my favorite dish of the evening. Next up The forest OMG it's a salad but so rich (thanks mushrooms & risotto) and how do they make that parsley moss. So so so so good! Then onto the wasabi lobster. Oh God it was fantastic!!! Buttery rich lobster surrounded by a crisp wasabi marshmallow. I can't even. Summery warm tomato & basil tart which left room for 3 desserts yep that's right all 3 go big or go home. Eton mess strawberry yumminess then Jasper farm cheesecake, yep it looks exactly like a cheese wheel & it's quite savory, creamy,melty brie encased in a shortbread cookie crust. There are no words. And how could I not get interpretation of vanity, of course I had to get it. They call it a cake it was more like a semi sweet chocolate almond candy covered by chocolate bubbles.

I was here for dinner by myself, and for what I received (relatively small plates) it was way too expensive: a medium bowl of short rib stew, a strawberry dessert, and a glass of wine: $88! (See my pix.)\n\nFirst, I love the concept: you choose relatively small dishes from restaurants around the world! The menu lists small, medium, and large dishes, but you could take each of those categories and knock them one size smaller. For example, a large is really a medium sized dish in most restaurants.\n\nI ordered the short rib stew from Roy Choi's LA restaurant: $34. Delicious, but I could get this in Chinatown, albeit less quality, for 1/4 of the price. Choi is famous for starting the Korean taco food truck craze... but halfway through the meal, I realized that I really oughta be eating his tacos (and not his beef stew), since that's what made him famous.\n\nI ordered the strawberry dessert (Eton Mess) from a London restaurant: $16. Delicious, particularly during this time when strawberries are in season.\n\n The glass of cab was $18.\n\nWhen I received my bill, 20% had already been charged for the tip, bringing my total to $88: think, 1 small and 1 medium dish and glass of wine!\n\nIn the end, what you are paying for is the concept and opportunity to have \"world restaurants\" come to you. However, in the end, it simply wasn't worth 88 bucks... at least for dinner.  The atmosphere is more in line with a lunch than dinner setting: hard seats, paper napkins, etc.\n\nSo, my verdict for In Situ is that you come here for a nice lunch, coupled with a nice visit to the great museum next-door. Save your money (or spend the same amount of money) for other restaurants that offer you more for a formal dinner setting.", "author": "Randy M."}

My husband came here with a group of co-workers before we went, so he was well-versed in the menu.  We shared everything and here's what went down:\n\n- Octopus and the Coral: braised octopus and seaweed from Virgilio Martinez, Central\nLima, Peru, 2014\n\n- The Forest, quinoa risotto, mushrooms, parsley \"moss\" from Mauro Colagreco, Mirazur\nMenton, France, 2011\n\n- Umami Soup, miso-marinated wagyu, asparagus, Inaniwa udon from Hisato Nakahigashi, Miyamasou Kyoto, Japan, 2015\n\n- Spicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes, sichuan peppercorn, yu choy from David Chang, Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar New York City, 2007\n\n- Wood Sorrel & Sheep Milk's Yogurt from Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, Noma Copenhagen, Denmark, 2005\n\nOf all the things we ate, I think The Forest was my favorite. The most innovative thing I ate was the Spicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes! I really enjoyed the Umami Soup, especially the broth. I was OK on the Octopus, and I wasn't overly keen on the Sheep MIlk's Yogurt from Noma.  In any case, lunch was a little pricey for all of this, so coming here will certainly be for special occasions only.

I can't even remember what I did yesterday but I can remember the shenanigans we partook at and after dinner that night...\n\nAs we were leaving from a satiated dinner, we hid behind the bushes and kept peering into the kitchen to get a look at Corey Lee (my gf had a crush on him and I was along for the view). I mean that's what a glass exhibition kitchen is for right? \n\nOk, I'll stop now before I make myself sound like stage 11 creeper.\n\nI've been anticipating the opening of In Situ, Three-Michelin Star Chef Corey Lee's third restaurant in San Francisco. In Situ has a very unique concept: Lee collaborated with some of the world's best chefs and everything on the menu is a reproduction of signature dishes from these chefs and their Michelin-starred/award winning restaurants like Thomas Keller (The French Laundry), Alice Waters (Chez Panisse), Hisato Nakahigashi (Miyamasou), Ren\u00e9 Redzepi (Noma), Dominique Ansel (Dominique Ansel Kitchen), etc. \n\nCurrently, there's 12 items in the dining room menu: share plates ($14-$38) and 3 desserts ($10-$14), etc. There's a separate lounge menu with smaller bites. To accurately represent these dishes, no modifications/substitutions can be made. There's an mandatory 20% service charge added to the bill. Without drinks, expect to spend about $80 pp.\n\nOn my two lunch visits (currently no dinner service), I tried 13 of the 15 dishes from the global menu:\n\n*Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Pine Salt, (Isaac McHale, The Clove Club, London) | $12 - 3 STARS\nbit.ly/1tphjgL\n\n*Guotie w/ pork, shrimp, cabbage (Cecilia Chang, The Mandarin, SF) | $12 - 3 STARS\nbit.ly/1sFdVOM\n\n*Shrimp Grits w/ pickled jalape\u00f1o, shrimp oil (Wylie Dufresne, wd~50, NYC) | $14 - 4.5 STARS\nbit.ly/1UbjlgD\n\n*Celeriac and Goat Cheese Profiterole w/ tomato and parsley (David McMillan & Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin, Joe Beef Montreal, Canada) | $14 - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28Mhv58\n\n*Octopus and the Coral w/ braised octopus and seaweed (Virgilio Martinez, Central Lima, Peru) | $28 - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28LIYmS\n\n*Guinea Fowl Larp Chiang Mai w/ raw vegetables and herbs (David Thompson, Nahm, Bangkok, Thailand) | $24 - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28MCCCd\n\n*Spicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes (David Chang, Momofuku Ssam Bar, NYC) | $22 - 4 STARS\nbit.ly/21kW0b4\n\n*Duck Breast w/ French green lentils, apples, aged red wine vinegar sauce (Thomas Keller, The French Laundry, Yountville, California) | $34 - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28MCIKd\n\n*Brown Oyster Stew w/ benne and Charleston ice cream (Sean Brock, Husk, Charleston, South Carolina) | $28 - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28LkA2B\n\n*Umami Soup w/ miso marinated wagyu, asparagus, inaniwa udon (Hisato Nakahigashi's, Miyamasou, Kyoto) | $38 - 3 STARS\nbit.ly/1U7lkwX\n\n*Interpretation of Vanity: Moist chocolate cake, cold almond cream, bubbles, cocoa (Andoni Aduriz, Mugaritz, Spain) | $14 - 3 STARS\nbit.ly/1Xo0HlV\n\n*Sorrel & Sheep Milk's Yogurt (Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, Noma Copenhagen, Denmark) | $14 - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28Pj7a0\n\n*Meyer Lemon Ice Cream and Sherbet (Alice Waters, Chez Panisse, Berkeley, California) | $10 - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/28Mt8aN\n\nMy favorite dishes were the Shrimp Grits (deliciously creamy with intense shrimp flavor), Profiterole (savory and subtly sweet from the carrot puree), Octopus & Coral (perfectly tender with a great crunchy contrast and hit of spice), Larp (addictingly spicy with complex layers of flavor and coolness from the chilled veggies), the Rice Cakes (fantastic toothsome chew but beware of those numbing sichuan peppercorns), and the Liberty Duck Breast (perfectly cooked to a medium rare, very flavorful with a pleasant sweetness from the lentils BUT the skin was not crispy).\n\nThe other dishes like the Fried Chicken (refined chicken mcnuggets), Goutie (ordinary), Brown Oyster Stew (rice was undercooked), and Umami Soup (too salty) weren't bad but not something I would order again.\n\nAs for the desserts, the Sheep Milk's Yogurt was interesting but the flavor was very subtle. Didn't care for the Chocolate Cake or the Meyer Lemon Ice Cream and Sherbet (ordinary). \n\nFor grand opening week, the service and staff were on point - professional, refined, and attentive. Food service was very quick and we were in/out in less than hour which makes it ideal for a nice, splurgey lunch without having long drawn out lags between courses (a la tasting menu). \n\nThe minimalist dining room was spacious and tables were well-spaced apart which I appreciated. The lounge area (different menu) has couches, and there's several large communal tables for larger parties.\n\nParking...you may want to take an Uber or Lyft because garage parking is $$$$ ($4-$5 for 30 minutes). If you drive everywhere but hate overpaying for parking like me, there's non-yellow meters (avoid yellow meters: 30 minute limit) in the alleyways off 2nd Street.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It is too pricey for me to bring my twins here for a snack.  \n\nCorey Lee, a Michelin multi-starred chef has a real winner.  He collaborated with an amazing array of top international chefs to create a very unusual rotating menu.  Each chef contributed one menu item, but only about 15 items are available on any given day.

I have so many allergies, including dairy and lentils, which made it hard to choose.  We also wanted the dishes to complement each other.\n\nWe started with the octopus and crispy seaweed from Peru.  It was delectable.  The octopus was cooked perfectly, not chewy or tough.  The sauce was spicy but really flavorful, complex and well balanced.  There was also a small cup of broth.\n\nOur main was the rice cakes with pork sausage from Momofuku. Very interesting and tasty.  We thought it was very good, but not as outstanding as the octopus.\n\nWe ended with the lemon ice cream and sherbet from Chez Panisse.

Not super busy and not hard to get a table compared to some other Michelin star restaurants in the area. Very modern interior designs, quite fitting given that it's technically in SF MoMA. Loved their simple and unique plates and utensils - thought about purchasing some for my own place if they ever become on sale. In terms of food, loved their wasabi lobster roll, which even had wasabi flavored marshmallow stars. The texture was perfectly soft and melt instantly in your mouth. Wasabi accompanying lobster seemed non-imposing and rather flavorful. Definitely a hit amongst my friends. We liked our shrimp with grits as well, but was not blown away. The foam chocolate cake was just so-so, definitely had it better elsewhere before. I'm personally not a big big fan of foam/bubbles with food, but can see the appeal of popping them in the bowl.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-14", "description": "tldr; great way to try some amazing dishes from around the world, I'm a fan\n\nA good start. SO and I are big fans of Corey Lee, so when In Situ opened, we knew we needed to give them a try. Reservations are harder than you would expect to get (though not impossible), since this place probably has the cheapest price relative to Lee's other restaurants, though the bill still ends up adding up pretty quickly. We went during opening week because we love food too much. We ended up snagging a last minute (read: literally the hour before the res) reservation at 2pm on a Saturday. We looked for other weekend prime time dining spots, but they were already taken, so hopefully the hype dies down a bit so I can go there more!\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the concept, Lee is basically taking dishes from other famous chefs around the world and paying homage to them in a rotating menu in SF. Pretty neat way to try the best dishes in the world without leaving the city. You could argue that maybe it's not authentic bla bla, but I think it's awesome. And the fact that it's located honestly feels all the more fitting and appropriate. \n\nIn Situ is architecturally similar to Lee's other establishments as well -- simple, clean no frills. Decorations are on the sparser side but elegant. They have two sections, a dining room and a lounge -- there are a ton of seats in the lounge, and it very much feels like an almost more upscale museum cafe place -- despite it being right next to the dining room, the dining room somehow ends up still being intimate and quiet enough for patrons there.\n\nThe menu is short and simple. We ordered the following dishes:\n\nBrown oyster stew -- this was delicious. Great seasoning, oysters were not super high quality, but the flavors in the stew base complemented the oysters very well. It's served with a brown rice like base, which offers a nice contrast to the otherwise creamy stew and oysters themselves. \n\nGuotie - Cecilia Chang is really such a badass. Guotie are simple and extremely traditionally Chinese. Definitely overpriced, but we were just thrilled to try the mother of Chinese food's food :) Super tasty\n\nUmami soup -- the most expensive bowl of noodle soup you'll ever eat. The wagyu beef was rare and well prepared in the soup. I didn't love the noodle style -- thin and flat, but the broth was delicious. Only quip is at the end of the day, you're paying for a few thin cuts of delicious wagyu though the price is high\n\nLibetry duck breast -- great way to try some Thomas Keller without pulling out the $$$$ for French Laundry. Wonderfully executed tender, juicy duck breast -- lots of places do duck, but the duck is too dry. This was delicious. I didn't love the lentil base, but that's not really Lee's fault\n\nWood sorrel and sheep milk's yogurt -- possibly the only way I'm ever going to try Noma. This was an excellent, creative alternative dessert option. It sounds kind of funny, but the sorrel is actually quite light and refreshing when complemented with the creamier texture of the sheep milk's yogurt. We were fans.\n\nThe final price for lunch for two was about $170 (gratuity included). Which is pretty absurd for a lunch and we were still a bit hungry afterwards. So while this is cheaper than Benu and maybe Monsieur Benjamin (though as I'm looking at that total, it's probably about the same as Monsieur Benjamin), I think to pay a bit more for the opportunity to try food from all over the world is a really awesome, worthwhile experience.\n\nWhat's holding me back from a 5 -- the service game was really week when we came. Maybe it's just because it was week one, I will update if we come back in the future. But servers were extremely awkward, clunky, dropped things, couldn't decide where to place things, forget utensils, etc. It wasn't a big deal, but it just made for a really bumpy experience while dining.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

The restaurant sits inside the beautifully redone SFMOMA and has a really great street front.  As soon as you wander in past the vacant high top tables and inquire about seating, the hostess will tell you they're all booked up. You can't see into the dining room but seeing half of the restaurant vacant is perplexing. She won't tell you that the expansive high top tables are open, she'll just leave you hanging.  I witnessed this at least 4 times over the course of my meal. Want to eat there anyway? Sit in the open seating. It's always empty and they serve the whole menu. \n\nI was really intrigued by the concept for In Situ. A variety of globe trotting  dishes by world renowned chefs in a fantastic museum? It seems can't miss but it feels can't win. If this is going to take advantage of its location it needs to encourage guests to be there. If it's going for high-end fine dining it should just go tasting menu only. The food seems almost unfit to order al a carte because you're still going to be hungry and you're going to miss something really cool if you order reasonably. Order unreasonably and you're probably still hungry and you could've been at State Bird Provisions pulling everything off of the food carts for the same amount of money and having way more fun. \n\nMy food was good. The service (minus that hostess) was great.  But the concept doesn't work. It runs off walk-ins and it doesn't serve hungry eaters.  Next time I'm hungry at the Moma I'll just walk around the corner to the Henrys Hunan on Natomas. Order some scallion cakes and harvest pork tax/tip / etc and still be out for less than the cost of one 'entree' at In Situ.", "author": "Sam K."}

The pickled jalapenos with the shrimp was to die for. If I could eat a huge bowl of this I would die happy. This is a must!\n\nCeleriac and Goat Cheese Profiterole - I really enjoyed how the intense flavor of the goat cheese went well with the sweet tomato sauce and made it refreshing. Overall a nicely balanced dish. \n\nOctopus and the Coral - our least favorite dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly but the sauce was too salty. It came with a broth on the side that I'm guessing was to off set the saltiness, but I didn't find it that helpful. \n\nLiberty Duck Breast - I was most excited for this dish, and I think because I had such high expectations I was let down. The duck didn't have a crispy sear on the skin, and pieces of it were chewy. The lentils and sauce were good, but nothing life changing. \n\nWood Sorrel and Sheep Milk's Yogurt - I wasn't expecting much from this dessert, mainly because it didn't sound very appealing to me. However, I did want to try a Noma dish so I decided to order it. WOWWWWW. Completely blew our socks off. The wood sorrel is a sweet granita type that's refreshing, and went perfectly with the sheep's milk's yogurt. I thought this might be a more savory dish but it was indeed a dessert. A definite must!\n\nInterpretation of Vanity - such pretty presentation! The chocolate cake was more like a mousse. The dark chocolate wasn't very sweet, which I liked. But if you're not an intense chocolate fan, you might not be as thrilled about it. \n\nService was extremely attentive. The check includes 20% gratuity but they definitely earned it. \n\nPortions are small, but you're eating works of art!", "author": "Noelle H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-27", "description": "Jules Verne might rethink his book if he could come to a meal at In Situ and call it \"Around the World in 90 Plates.\" \n\nThat's the concept behind this amazing new restaurant by Corey Lee. With the simple motion of raising a fork to your mouth, you can visit the far east via Manhattan, wander through a French forest, or play in the bubbles on a Spanish beach. Chef Lee and his team have worked closely with a number of chefs to carefully recreate some of the most famous dishes at the most respected and treasured restaurants from around the world.\n\nWhat a perfect concept in a museum. He has built an impressive 'collection' of chefs from all over the world and brought that same experience of seeing a Matisse, a Picasso, and a Lichtenstein in just a few rooms to the arena of food.\n\nThe space, in many ways is like a gallery, the walls and tables are simple, the utensils and plates are minimalistic, but bringing them together creates a canvas that the artists in the kitchen are able to paint upon. The menu, about 25 items at any given time, like any good exhibit, changes regularly. \n\nOur meal:\n- \"Celeriac and Goat Cheese Profiterole\"; David McMillan and Frederick Morin, from Joe Beef (Montreal) (note that each dish, like any painting or sculpture deserves, and got full credit with a short bio on each chef on why they were revolutionary in their own way), was one of the 'older' menu items. This was first made in the 90s, and the idea of the profiterole is a bit outdated in most hands. However the intensity of flavor of the celeriac and parsley, the creamy whip of goat cheese, and the meal worthy tomato 'soup' that the dish rested in raised it above a mere puff pastry. \n\n- \"Spicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes\"; David Chang, from Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar (New York City). The rice cakes were akin to gnocchi. They were almost crunchy on the outside, perfectly chewy on the inside. Each bit was smothered in the pork sausage. Lemongrass, toasted peppers, and just a hint of spicy red pepper would assert themselves in any given bite as the interplay of food was enjoyed. \n\nThis would be a good time to talk about the cocktail I had, the \"Algonquin\". It was a scotch based drink with pineapple juice, vermouth and thyme. The scotch was just smoky enough to come to the fore in each sip, but the sweetness, to the point of being sour would linger and almost cleanse the palate creating that sense of urgency to have another taste. With the spiciness of the Rice Cakes, it was a perfect match, probably better suited than to some of the other dishes on the menu, but it was never completely out of place with the meal.\n\n- \"The Forest\"; Mauro Colagreco, from Mirazur (Menton, France). This was hands down the most sensuous plate of food I have ever had. The bed of quinoa risotto was piled high with a medley of mushrooms, potatoes, and parsley that had somehow turned into the texture of moss. One minute you smell the aroma of the fungi, the next you feel that soft, delicate moss, the next the bark of a tree. If you close your eyes you are in the middle of a forest, but your only way to experience it is through your taste buds and the thoughtful interplay of textures that are so visceral it can literally bring tears to your eyes. \n\n- \"Carrot, Sour Curd, Pickled Pine\"; Matt Orlando, from Amass (Copenhagen) \n- \"Liberty Duck Breast\"; Thomas Keller from The French Laundry (Napa). The carrots were great, a perfect compliment to the duck, but not much can compare to this duck. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and is really the centerpiece of this menu. The skin was crispy, but the meat was perfectly tender and flavorful; in a word, perfect! Paired with the lentils and onions, carrots, green apple, and pickled onion the whole meal was a perfect balance of sweet and savory. Each bite delighted the palate with perfect contrasts, but nothing overwhelming the flavor of the exquisite duck.\n\n- Dessert: \"The Interpretation of Vanity\"; Andoni Luis Aduriz, from Mugaritz (Errenteria, Spain). This was a sweet milk chocolate cake swimming in a pool of chocolate bubbles. Every time you popped the bubbles you had more chocolate sauce to drizzle on the cake. Paired with an almond cream, this tasted like the most decadent Hershey's chocolate bar with almonds that you'll ever have.\n\nThe service was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and able to answer any questions.\n\nThis is definitely a splurge, but if you're feeling like you want to taste flavors from all over the world, this is the perfect opportunity to do just that. They have created something utterly unique and special and it is a perfect dining experience tied to the newly reopened SF MOMA.", "author": "Seneca G."}

Where else can you go from Spain, France, Italy to Turkey, Brazil then back to Colorado & New York  while sitting in Cali?  Interesting... unfortunately In Situ needs some help. Portions are small. Very small and pricey. Dishes don't exactly match each other which since dishes are so small you're ordering more dishes thus the flavors become all over the place.  We had a party of 4+ and decided to share all of the dishes. We ordered 2 smalls, all 4 mediums and all 3 large dishes, bread at a $1 a slice plus the famous cheese cake as suggested by our server. After 11 dishes I can say I enjoyed the Momofuku spicy sausage mocha balls and the cheese cake was like a sweet yet savory epiosses cheese on lighter vanilla wafers. Amazing. Which brings me to this 3 1/2 star rating.  My suggestion for this restaurant is 1) make the portions bigger, I mean bigger and 2) maybe a prix fixe with choices might work better with dishes that can match in flavors as an option. 3) give the bread free. Overall I'd return for the cheese cake alone as when I'm thinking about a flavor the next morning is a good sign.", "author": "Rob B."}

From the service to the quiet and respectful ambiance, but most of all: the incredible food. We had 4 dishes and a dessert.  \n\nThe Forest ($28)\nquinoa risotto, mushrooms, parsley \"moss\"\nBy Chef Mauro Colagreco, Mirazur restaurant in France. The bowl used to serve this dish was flown from Colagreco's restaurant in France. This dish was just extraordinary. I'm just going to address the elephant in the room: quinoa risotto? Well I don't know how they managed but it was the best risotto I've ever had in my life and I can't stop thinking about it: it was a luscious and creamy and flavorful. The variety of gorgeous wild mushrooms, each one prepared differently to highlight their respective flavors was just one of the best experiences I've ever had eating because I love mushrooms so much and it was so amazing to be able to try so many different varieties that you don't often see on menus and have them prepared in the most thoughtful delicious ways. The hen of the woods mushroom that was in this dish was just a showstopper I could eat a huge bowl of just those every day for the rest of my life and be satisfied over and over again.  I think sometimes people shy away from dishes that look like this because it looks so froufrou and like you're going to take a bite of something that could taste like the floor of a forest, but what so incredible is that it looks so beautiful and so much like the floor of the forest, but yet it tasted like a hearty, sumptuous, incredible, delicious dreamdish.\n\nPlogue \u00e0 Champlain with Foie Gras ($46)\ncheddar, bacon, egg, maple, buckwheat pancake\nMartin Picard, Au Pied de Cochon\nMontreal, Canada, 2004\nThis dish was fabulous but not my favorite. I would order it again but it was definitely the most straight forward dish we had. It was sort of like a high-end breakfast dish with a buckwheat pancake topped with cheddar and thick bacon and then a maple sauce all over it and then that sexy little slice of seared foie gras resting on top. This was my friend Justin's favorite dish. I think I would have liked it with a little less sauce to be honest but my co-diners were licking the plate so that's not to say it wasn't a fabulous sauce. \n\nWasabi Lobster ($26)\nmango jelly, Thai vinaigrette, wasabi Marshmallow\nTim Raue, Restaurant Tim Raue\nBerlin, Germany, 2013\nThis was my second favorite dish. It was a large chunk of lobster which had been tempura fried, covered in what my friends and I were describing as wasabi fruity pebbles. There were two wasabi marshmallows on the side and then this incredible wasabi aioli. I know that sounds like wasabi overload but each application was so subtle and so different. It was never over powering or too much. The dish was extremely complex but when you ate it it just tasted so simple and so glorious.\n\nGlazed Chicken Thigh ($22)\nonsen egg, lettuce, sansho, teriyaki\nHiroshi Sasaki, Gion Sasaki\nKyoto, Japan\nThis was my third favorite dish (let me just reiterate that all of these dishes were first-favorite worthy). When the dish was on its way to the table my friend Justin said that he thought iceberg lettuce was strange to include in this dish and he said something like is in iceberg lettuce considered to be on the lower end of the culinary totem pole? The iceberg lettuce made the dish. It comes in a shallow bowl which was shipped here from Gion Sasaki in Japan, it's like a bed of chunks of iceberg lettuce, with pieces of glazed chicken thighs nestled on top but our server let us know that we should \"look for the hidden onsen egg underneath\". I asked what an onsen egg was and he told me it sous vide to the exact temperature of the hot springs in Kyoto Japan *foodgasm*. You're meant to toss the whole dish together, which felt naughty and risky, but we did it and it was just incredible. Silky, luscious, tender and crisp all in one bite. I said this to my friends in confidence but I'll say it to you guys too: think about if a McChicken had a sexier Japanese older sister.  The iceburg/chicken/sauce combo just did me so right. \n\nOops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart ($16)\nMassimo Bottura, Osteria Francescana\nModena, Italy\nThe story behind this tart is that his pastry chef dropped a lemon tart and it was the last one they had so they served it as \"deconstructed\" and it was a hit. It has limoncello zabaione, lemongrass gelato, and a smashed tart crust. The dish was served with all of these tiny little bits on the side such as candied lemon rind, a caper, chili oil, mint oil, and the pastry chef explained that Bottura feels if u have each of these flavors, you've tested the essence of Modena cuisine. The plate itself looks like a shattered piece of stoneware but has the texture/appearance of meringue (at least that was my observation). \n\nShout out to our amazing server Charles.

Texture was great and the meat was so tender that it came off easily; just a tad salty for my friend (though my salt tolerance level is a bit higher and I thought it was ok)\n- Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake (hazelnut, white chocolate, cookie)- one of the best dishes we had taste-wise and concept-wise.  Shaped like a wheel of cheese that you spread on a cookie, this isn't your average cheesecake; in fact it tastes more like cheese than dessert.  \n\nAll in all, I liked how they thought out of the box with most of their dishes and they tasted great.

Creative idea to replicate some of the most exquisite dishes from some of the world's most famous chefs.  We tried a variety of selections and the one we enjoyed most was \"The Forest\".   The dish literally looked like a mini forest with parsley moss on the mushroom trees atop a bed of quinoa risotto.  We felt like evil green giants destroying the forest, and loved every bite.   Surprisingly filling considering some of the other dishes are not as substantial.   The glazed chicken thigh was flavorful with teriyaki and egg on lettuce, but quite a small dish and plated very plainly.  Would not recommend.   We also enjoyed the carrot, sour curd and pickled pine.  The plating was elegant and differentiated each of the ingredients, and when combined paired surprisingly well.  Loved the light, refreshing chilled hibiscus infusion with honey and lime inspired by Egypt.   For dessert we had the Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake and it was like non other I have ever tried; in fact it was the best ever!  The cheese was coated in a hazelnut and white chocolate crust with cookies to spread the gooey fresh cheese.  Very satisfying and unique preparation.  Although at $22 and not inexpensive, it was definitely worth the experience. \n\nEnjoyed the clean, modern, elegant, but not pretentious atmosphere.  Wait staff helpful, but a bit disjointed at times as we had multiple servers which at times was problematic with service.   \n \nTips: can order off of the bar and/or dining room menus.  Reservations strongly advised for the dining room up to one month in advance.  If you get there early for lunch you can sit in the common dining area, but the bar menu is limited to four items plus dessert.

It was a somewhat quiet atmosphere yet I still interpreted it as more casual than the typical \"high end\" dining experience. The staff were all very friendly, but i was thrown a bit off guard here. It felt like there was no true wait staff but more or less people from the kitchen and such running out food and doing other wait related tasks. Which is completely fine. There wasn't a ton of upfront explaining of things, but when asked questions, everyone was very helpful\nand friendly (eg. do we use our hands?, what do the letters correspond to?, etc).

I know I was in for a good time.\n\nI ordered all the dishes that I've eaten at these chefs creations before. \n\n- Shrimp Grits - pickled jalape\u00f1o, shrimp oil, Wylie Dufresne, WD~50, New York City 2013\n\n- Apocalypse Burger, Anthony Myint, Mission Street Food, San Francisco, 2016 - ($1 from each burger goes towards food related carbon offsets through ZeroFootprint.)\n\n- Liberty Duck Breast - Thomas Keller, The French Laundry, Yountville, 1995 - I've been to TFL a dozen of times in 2 years straight.

Of course I can't compare as if these legendary chefs were actually cooking for me nor I thought the ingredients were the same. However, for having the memories brought back, it was as good as it gets without me traveling anywhere.\n\nReading the story of each chef on the menu and what they are good at with their experience, technique, passion, and where they are from. Once can only wish to travel there some days. \n\nI enjoy the concept, the wine, the good service and the chill ambiance here. I can't wait to come back for the Mentor BKB dinner event. \n\nIn Situ is a must try restaurant if you have the palate for finer taste in life.", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

I opted for the $34 liberty duck breast instead which is a collaboration with The French Laundry. \n\nThe duck is not too rare but easy to cut and not too chewy. It's well flavored and relatively lean. The apple was sweet and the onions are perfectly cooked. Overall a fantastic dish that I wouldn't hesitate to try again if there weren't so many other dishes here that looks appetizing.\n\nOur group also split the celerlac and goat cheese profiterole, which came with 3 pieces.

Great concept of bringing together high end small plates from around the world, but dishes were a combination of bland, not cook properly, small, just plain bizarre, and again way overpriced.  The only thing going for this place is the decor.  Service was spotty, and like other reviewers have stated, prepare to wait a good 10 minutes between dishes.  I also had to flag someone down to get an extra glass of sake, and then again to pay as our bill was just sitting there.  Certainly not what I expect when paying top dollar.  \n\nI had the Manti dish from Turkey as I love Manti and used to live in Turkey.  I specifically asked the waiter if it was like traditional Manti and he assured me it was.  It wasn't.  The individual Manti (4) were huge, taste was bland, and the pasta wasn't al dente, it was uncooked.  The tomato sauce that came with it tasted like Prego. The yogurt sauce was OK.  \n\nThe \"fired chicken\" is just chicken nuggets which were placed in a basket full of pine branches from at least 3 different pine trees, and a large pine cone.  Oddly enough I don't find it fun to dig in a nest of pine branches to find my food.  The pine smell and flavor completely overrode the spices on the nuggets and there was no sauce to compliment it....just dried chicken nuggets which tasted of pine.  \n\nThe chicken from Kyoto, Japan was oddly flavored and left a tingling sensation on my tongue.  The fried (quail?) egg that came with it was completely unnecessary.\n\nThe beer and sake pourings were ridiculously small, but expensive.  \n\nOn top of all that they include a 20% tip automatically.  \n\nAfter about $140 for lunch my husband and I went home still hungry and ordered a pizza...we enjoyed our pizza! :)", "author": "Sean M."}

The partitioned menu is cleverly designed and makes it easy to understand which dishes are small, medium, large, shareable and vegetarian and to find a perfectly paired wine.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. There were 11 main dishes available for lunch, and three desserts. My sister and I had the Wasabi Lobster with mango jelly, thai vinaigrette, wasabi marshmallow and my niece had The Forest a dish that featured quinoa risotto, mushrooms, and parsley moss. I personally felt the wasabi was a little over powering for the lobster, but appreciated the range of textures and treatments. The Forest was the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance as it was so artfully presented on the dish you didn't even want to eat it.\n\nWe shared The interpretation of vanity, which was a moist echolocate cake with cold cream, bubble and cocoa. Simply WOW!! The bubbles were AMAZING and so creative.\n\nWe enjoyed a couple of glasses of the Wind Gap, Trousseau Gris 2015 from the Fannucci-Wod Road Vineyard in the Russian River. It was delicate and delicious. So good that I'm going to try and hunt down some bottles for home consumption.\n\nThe decor was sparse and modern, as one would expect at the MOMA. A 20% service charge is included, which is good, as I think it should be standard at all restaurants and was well earned as the service was excellent.\n\nI would highly recommend the restaurant and hope to go back again soon.", "author": "Emily C."}

We pretty much order everything on the menu since the menu was rather limited:\n\n1. Carrot soup - It came in a shot glass, and yes, you will finish in 3 spoonfuls. The soup tasted okay. However, I had better curried carrot soup that cost less than half and gave you three times more soup, go figure.\n2. Cuttlefish Cappuccino -What in the world is this? It could be a home made dish if you know how to dice a cooked cuttlefish, add squid ink and add tons of cream.\n3. Burger - If you are hungry do not order this.......this is a one bite, lettuce-wrapped, so-called burger. The beef patty is about 1\"x1\". I don't see how they could justify the price, $14.\n4. Sea Urchin in a Lobster Jello, about 3 spoonfuls. Tasted good but for  $85? \n5. Fresh Stone Crab Claw - I got a chance to taste this dish in Hong Kong. The taste of this dish didn't even come close! The wine in the egg overpowered the whole dish to a point that it tasted bitter. The crab meat was overcooked and stone crab is a bad choice because the meat is quite tough. \n6. Smoked Confet Pig Jowl - This two-bite dish was tasty but again, for $ 24?. \n7. Wasabi Lobster - The only thing memorable about this dish is the two- star shaped marshmallows on the plate.\n8. Jokbal Ssam - Do yourself a favor, order this dish in an authentic Korean restaurant. That's all I have to say about this dish.\n9. Risotto - This was by far the best dish of the meal. Portion was good with a distinct smoky taste. \nWe ordered the 3 kinds of desserts on the menu. The only one that worth my calories was the Cheesecake. \n\nBy the way, some of us ordered coffee and they came out lukewarm, unbelievable!!!  \n\nI don't understand the theme of this restaurant. It definitely charges five-star prices but offers a school cafeteria ambience. Service was only okay. We found a hair in one of the dishes.  The server took it back but the manager never came by to apologize. Just happens St. Regis Hotel is located right next door.  I wish we went there instead.

Just like how SFMOMA features modern art from artists all over the world, In Situ features modern cuisine from culinary artists all over the world (prepared by Corey Lee's kitchen). It is a very interesting idea as you get to sample cuisine inspired by great restaurants in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, South America, and more.\n\nI started with the shrimp grits from Wylie Dufresne's now closed wd~50 (New York). This dish featured grits made from shrimp in a sweet corn and cheese sauce. There was also shrimp oil as well as nice heat from pickled jalapenos. It was a fun dish (especially given how the texture of the shrimp was so similar to grits) even if it was just a good but not excellent dish.\n\nNext up was the wasabi tempura fried lobster with wasabi cream, wasbi marshmallow, mango, mango jelly, carrot, and Thai vinaigrette from Tim Raue (Berlin). This was one of the true standouts of the experience here with fun textures and intense flavors. The lobster was incredibly moist and soft, and it was nicely contrasted by the rice crispie-like crunch from the wasabi dusted outside.  The wasabi throughout the dish provided an exceptional horseradish-like heat.\n\nBraised and coral crusted octopus with spicy seaweed and seafood broth from Virgilio Martinez (Peru) followed. The octopus was great and tender (very meaty too). The garnishes all provided a nice mix of salty and heat.\n\nA dish from Thomas Keller (The French Laundry in Yountville) was my main. It was Liberty Farms duck breast over a bed of French green lentils, glazed carrots, onions and turnips. The dish also featured an aged red wine vinegar sauce. This was a very classic French dish with rich flavors. It was not too heavy. I enjoyed the savory lentils, and the duck meat was juicy and tender. Unfortunately, the duck skin was disappointingly soft.\n\nBoth desserts were in the just okay range. There was a chocolate and cold almond cream bar from Andoni Luis Aduriz (Spain). It had a nice chocolate flavor, but it was very simple and not that complex in terms of flavors or textures. I also had the wood sorrel granita, which was accompanied by sheep milk's yogurt from Rene Redzepi (Denmark). This dessert was refreshing and had a nice tanginess from the yogurt, but this dessert like the chocolate dessert was a little too simple.\n\nService was personable and quick. Prices are high with some dishes representing better values than others depending on the portion sizes. It should come as no surprise that the d\u00e9cor is very minimalist and maybe even a little cold given that it is housed in a modern art museum.\n\nIn Situ is a perfect match for the museum that holds it. Corey Lee's In Situ can be a great spot for lunch to try delicious and fun savory dishes that are also quite beautiful on the plate. Some dishes definitely shine more than others, but if you order right here, you could be in for a very memorable dining experience.\n\nParking in this area is hard to find though there are a few paid lots and structures close by.", "author": "Anthony N."}

At the receiving end of a re-creating process, we can only comment on the actual execution, not the original design. \n\n - Glazed Chicken Thigh was perfect in terms of taste and texture. There must be immense craftsmanship behind these small bites. But the presentation made it hard to believe that it was a kaiseki dish, let alone a dish from Gion Sasaki. \n\n - Lamb Shank dish looked exactly like the original (based on Mikla's website). Unfortunately, the dumpling wrappers were unevenly and not thoroughly cooked. Flavors of the lamb and the sauce were memorable, though.\n\n - Anis Marinated Salmon was German haute cuisine: ambitious yet thoughtful with a touch of the international and disciplined plating with squares, rounds, cubes and dots. Anis (anise) seemed missing in this dish. Wasabi flavor however was strong. In Germany, marinated or smoked salmon is often accompanied by Meerrettich (horseradish). Wasabi is in the same plant family, but has a higher status in the seasoning department. The recipe was created in 2010. Back then using wasabi flavor caviar of flying fish in lieu of Meerrettich must have been a carefully-planned touch of the international. The menu at In Situ should have described the flavor of the caviar.\n\n - Crispy Crepe was our favourite. It reminded us those simple, intelligent and passionate dishes served at the now-closed Curious Kumquat (Silver City, NM).  If it was expressive of its creator, our discovery was The Willows Inn (Lummi Island, Washington). \n\nSize doesn't matter, sharing does. We shared two small, three medium, one large dishes plus one large dessert. Independent of size, each dish has its own breadth and depth of flavors. Sharing maximises tasting experience without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThings - the ambiance, the atmosphere, the water and the wine - were a little cold in the beginning.

The numerous courses and very meticulous dishes left me hungry and wanting more (especially the Xiao long Bao).  While I understand the acclaim and appraise, that style of dining isn't really for me (or my wallet). \n\nBut when I heard about his concept for In Situ, I admit I was more than intrigued.  Taking famous dishes from around the world, learning them from the chefs behind those dishes themselves, and bringing them all to SF and the beautiful MoMA of all places?   Yes, please. \n\nOf course, I tempered the great concept with worries about portion size, price, and accessibility.  Luckily, with proper expectations, I think In Situ is the perfect fit for the MoMA.  So my concerns one by one:\n\nAccessibility: while the main dining room is \"committed\" as the lovely hostesses shared with us, a good portion of the restaurant is meant for drop in and more casual dining.  \n\nPricing: these bite sized items can be shared but a very useful menu illustrates size, suitability for sharing and more. Prices ranged from $10-$32 with most being under $15.  Given the MoMA location, very reasonable. Service was just as professional as Benu. \n\nPortion size:  nothing was enormous but the portions are doable for sharing and you'd probably be full ordering 2-3 dishes.  Given the 3 Michelin star background of Lee, that's fair.  \n\nOur order:the Fried Chicken was served on a bed of pine trees and more like delicious chicken nuggets.  The tapioca and cheese tater tots were delicious and Roy Choi's Ketchup (and kimchee) fried rice was a crowd pleaser. \n\nOverall, a great and appropriate addition to the SF dining scene and a perfect companion to MoMA. \n\nNot sure I'll check out the main dining room, but given what we could see, the more substantial items were not too much bigger and I've gotten a good idea of the concept. I'll just keep wandering the lovely MoMA. \n\nIn Situ accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

Some items are exactly what you expect them to be and others are out of this world different. The wasabi lobster is definitely a dish that is totally outside of the box-is it everyone's favorite? Maybe not, but I sure enjoyed it. The creativity and play they offer with their dishes are just fun and exciting to see and taste. If you can enjoy it then maybe you're just not creative enough with your palate. I hear some dishes are added or different on the weekend so we'll have to try that sometime but to have this type of restaurant in the museum is a real treat.", "author": "Guisela L."}

I love the concept of bringing together the best food creations and crediting the original chef, but the execution was lacking.  While I loved the minimalist design and wood decor, it was just too big and open.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a mix-up, we ended up in the lounge, not the dining room.  This was a disappointment.  Although the lounge was entirely empty (except us), they refused to let us order off the dining room menu. The lounge menu is very minimal with only 4-5 dishes.  The lounge is much more casual, so I felt like we missed out on the service.  The server didn't tell us anything about the various dishes.  Later in the evening, I think our server was busy and one of the main dining room servers delivered our dishes, and it was a night-and-day difference; she told us all about the dish, who created it, what the main ingredients are, etc.  I'm eager to return to try the dining room - unfortunately the lounge was a miss.", "author": "Greg B."}

They also list suggested wine pairings in the menu and provide descriptions about the inspiration for the different dishes including portion size guidance. \n\nWe ended up deciding to split a few things \n\nCuttlefish cappuccino - this was pretty good, it tasted mostly like potato foam with a unique texture from the fish. Probably my favorite of the night \n\nTomato velvet and shrimp - this came with three shrimp and 3 small pieces of toast in a tomato velvet sauce. Seemed almost like a tomato soup as a thin layer on the plate. This was second favorite of the night and best if eaten T the same time as the toast. \n\nThe forest - this is a mushroom risotto. I'm not a huge mushroom fan but this was highly recommended. It looked amazing when it was served. Presentation was awesome.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-03", "description": "The idea of food as art fits perfectly with In Situ's location in a museum - The Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco. Think of walking into a gallery to see the works of artists then you get the idea of the restaurant, exhibiting the works of famous chefs from around the world, except in In Situ's case, part of the sensory experience is eating and savoring each particular work of art.\n\nThere's a whole lot of great food prepared by master chefs but instead of traveling around the world to taste the dishes, In Situ brings the plates to you in one locale. The chefs give their special recipes to the kitchen staff and spend some time at the restaurant as to make sure that the staff has mastered the techniques in preparing their dish.\n\nChef/owner Corey Lee is the \"curator\" of this gallery of worldwide cuisine. \n\nUnlike some restaurants that are easy to categorize, ie. Asian fusion, California, Chinese, French, Italian, there is not guiding light here. Be prepared to be bounced around the world. For instance, here are some of the dishes that we tried:\n\n*Crispy Crepe, a seemingly simple creation but a perfect way to prepare you for what's to come, by Blaine Wetzel of The Willows Inn on Lummi Island Washington\n*Anis Marinated Salmon, an amazing explosion of so many different flavors that blend in your mouth, by Harald Wohlfahrt of Restaurant Schwarzwaldstube in Balersbronn, Germany;\n*Liberty Duck Breast, so tender and what you would expect from famed Tomas Kellor of The French Laundry, Napa Valley, California;\n*Wasabi Lobster, a surprise combination that works, by Tim Raue, Restaurant Tim Raue of Berline, Germany;\n*The Voyage from the Indies, a hint of curry sauce under a filet of John Dory with a compote of mango and apple, by Olivier Roellinger, Les Maisons de Bricourt of Saint-Memoir-des-Ondes, France;\n*The Forest, a surprisingly flavorful and filling vegetarian creation by Mauro Colagreco, Miramar of Menton, France\n*Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart, exactly what the name implies, by Masimo Bottura, Osteria Franciscan in Modena, Italy\n*Interpretation of Vanity, a must for chocolate lovers, by Andoni Luis Aduriz,Mugaritz of Errenteria, Spain\n\nWait staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and not at all snooty. They took the time to explain each dish and its origins, acting as guides on our gastronomic adventure. They were accommodating to our party who wanted to share all the dishes with each other, providing extra utensils and plates when necessary. They were on \"our\" time as we leisurely savored and discussed each preparation and didn't bother us until we were all done at each phase of our meal so we could \"travel\" together.\n\nDespite the 5-star service and quality, the restaurant is comfortable and casual. Jeans and t-shirts fit in quite well. We were there for an early evening meal and I didn't see a single coat and tie.\n\nThe dishes aren't meant to replicate the complete meal experience that you would have at each particular restaurant but it does give you an idea of the culinary artistry of each chef. Some of the dishes conjure up old sensory memories of familiar comfort food while others introduce completely new flavors to surprise your palate.\n\nSome diners might chafe at the lack of sensible progression one would expect in a traditional meal. Upstairs, in the different galleries, you might find groupings of photographs separated from the next gallery that might have an exhibit of pop art.  For me, I didn't mind being bounced around. It was like having a Frieda Kahlo next to an Andy Warhol. Each can be appreciated in its own context. I was here for the journey and the surprises I might encounter along the way.\n\nA word of caution: Some of the dishes mentioned here might not be on the menu when you go because of the seasonality of some of the dishes and Chef Lee's intention to introduce new chefs and their creations to customers.", "author": "Ed D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-02", "description": "4.50 stars.  I would explain In Situ like this: Imagine a world class artist taking 20 classic songs he absolutely loved and replicating them to the best of his ability.  While the replication might not be exact, you can certainly appreciate the concept and the effort involved to create the masterpiece.  In Situ is essentially a replication of some of the best dishes on the entire globe served under one roof under the tutelage of Michelin starred chef Corey Lee.  This undertaking could not be handled by most people, but in the hands of one of the world's greatest chefs, In Situ works splendidly.  \n\nWhile In Situ's menu plays to the globe, I stayed in North America and Europe for my voyage in an attempt to properly balance my meal.  \n\nFIRST COURSE: Shrimp Grits (NYC: wd-50): Here, the shrimp is somewhat hidden in plain sight as the \"grits' are actually ground shrimp with a grit consistency.  The shrimp is combined within a corn sauce to recreate the Southern delicacy.  Tiny half crescents of pickled jalapeno jut upward from the dish and a scallion ribbon adorns the plate to create an aesthetically pleasing view.  \n\nSECOND COURSE: \"The Forest\" (Menton, FR: Mirazur): This absolutely dazzling display of mushrooms, risotto, parsley, and potatoes can only be fully appreciated upon ordering.  As the name suggests, the dish itself presents like a forest.  Each mushroom has a different shape, taste, color, structure, and cooking technique.  The parsley moss creates rich greens, the mushrooms are wood, the potatoes are trunks, and the risotto creates trailways underneath the forest.  If the presentation (which, in my travels, is the most incredible I've ever seen out of a vegetarian dish) wasn't enough, the taste is unparalleled.  And while the dish itself appears to be visually somewhat different from the French inspiration, it is undoubtedly a magnificent piece that should be ordered while dining at In Situ.   \n\nTHIRD COURSE: Liberty Duck Breast (Napa Valley, CA: French Laundry): It's hard not to order a dish that is a Michelin 3 star chef's interpretation of duck breast from what is considered by many to be the world's finest restaurant.  While I haven't tried the inspiration, Chef Lee's work is brilliant in its own respect with a ravishingly savory lentil base accented with sugary cubes of apple, tiny cipollini onions, and squares of carrot.  Shockingly, I had one piece of duck breast that was a bit rough which served as the one momentary error in an otherwise wonderful execution.  \n\nFOURTH COURSE: Interpretation of Vanity (Errentaria, SP: Mugaritz): Frankly, this is the dish that convinced me to eat here in the first place.  While there are a handful of restaurants across the globe who execute molecular gastronomy to perfection, it was the interesting bubbly foam adorning Chef Aduriz's dessert that caught my eye while glancing through photos from In Situ.  While the almond cream is somewhat buried underneath the chocolate cake in this recreation by Chef Lee, the dish is still a brilliant play for the eye and your taste buds won't be disappointed either.   \n\nWhile there are some on here stating that they ate pretty much the entire menu in 2 visits, I would recommend restraint.  At four courses, I was quite full.  I would suggest five courses maximum and three will suffice.  Overall, this is an excellent addition to the San Francisco Museum of Fine Art and creates a global culinary art exhibit that only strengthens the reputation of the museum.  It's worth seeking out for locals and visitors alike, and hopefully, it will continue to be an experience that doesn't require two months in advance to book.", "author": "Yelper N."}

My friend's chicken was quite good and my stew was well executed and came with a small bowl of rice, though really just a stew and didn't blow my socks off.  My tea came in a lovely glass cup which the server poured in front of me from a tiny matching glass tea pot.  The leaves were beautiful bright green and yellow colors.

Every single dish is so beautiful and delicious.\n\nI always start with \"Apocalypse Burger\" (because it's so tasty and beautiful), and my partner (who is vegetarian) always takes \"Forest\".  My current favorite are \"Spring Tidal Pool\" and \"Wasabi Lobster\".  They are shockingly delicious.  In the past, I enjoyed \"Inaniwa Udon\".  Also \"Sea urchin in lobster gelee\" was absolutely exquisite and heavenly. \n\nHostesses, servers, everybody is nice and friendly.  But one mystery about In Situ is that a wait for seating is ALWAYS quite long (10 mins or so) even though we are always on time for a reservation and there are actually empty tables.", "author": "Akiko O."}

We had the shrimp & grits, which had intense shrimp taste and wonderful texture, the Guinea fowl larp chiang mai was authentically spicy and the amazing The Forest, with wild mushrooms, quinoa, fingerling potatoes and parsley moss. The Forest was one of the best dishes I have ever had. \n\nIn Situ is a bit pricey, but a lot of care is put into composing each dish. The service was just mediocre . . . with an automatic 20% service charge included, the servers did not seem particularly motivated.", "author": "Stacey L."}

Plenty of other people will give you long reviews, so I will keep it relatively brief.\n\nI am more than happy to spend a ton of money on a fabulous meal.  I've eaten at Manresa and other Michelin rated restaurants and I've never complained.  However, I am not willing to spend a lot of money on a just-OK meal, so I won't be going back, and I will tell everyone I know that In Situ is fine if you don't mind overpriced restaurants.  $350 for 4 people to have lunch is just bizarre and unreasonable, even if Thomas Keller's name is on one of the dishes.  For example: a side plate of some roasted carrots is $18.  Other medium/small-ish plates we ordered ranged from $22-$32 each.  The cheesecake is $22.  \n\nThe concept is interesting and unique but soon becomes a little gimicky.  The menu is over-stylized... just trying too hard to be modern and avant garde.\n\nThe service was professional; however, I prefer human servers to robots (I mean that figuratively) but I think for some people if your server doesn't smile and says everything very methodically it means you are in a high-end place, so whatever.\n\nDrinks were above average for sure.  I would go back for a cocktail, but that's it.\n\nSan Francisco has so much to offer.  Please eat at State Bird Provisions if you want to have an outrageously great experience.  You get super high quality food and unique flavors at a reasonable price, served by warm and friendly servers.  But if you like meh food for high prices then try In Situ, you might just love it.

The restaurant is smallish, and the lounge area open to the bustling MoMA lobby. The dining room is immediately adjacent, and as my dining companion said, \"I feel like I'm at IKEA.\" The menu itself is interesting but somewhat hard to use -- imagine an origami museum map with no legend to define its various marking and letters. \n\nI would be fine enough with the quirks if the meal's execution was flawless. We ordered the chicken thigh to start, pork sausage and duck breast as entrees, and \"Vanity\" chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was, in a word, underwhelming. The chicken thigh needed at least a touch of searing to give it texture -- I simply refuse to accept little squares of iceberg lettuce as a substitute -- and a pinch of salt to wake it up. A lightly poached egg with a rich yolk was the dish's saving grace. My duck breast, a thing that should be tender, was tough to the point of having trouble cutting it with a knife and still bore a sliver of tendon. Our waiter did not inquire as to how well I wanted the duck cooked, so I presume there was no option. Again just a few flakes of salt would have helped save the two little bland pieces of meat, thought the dish's lentil and vegetable base was nice. My companion described his pork sausage dish, though spicy, as flat. The taste seemed mostly vinegar and Chinese Five Spice. I held out hope for dessert. Anything named \"An Interpretation of Vanity\" really ought to deliver. Describing it as chocolate cake is almost criminally deceptive. The brown log with bubbles was soft and squishy (appetizing much?) and left a momentary gelatinous film on the tongue. At least the hibiscus infusion and coffee were good. Service was non offensive but added nothing to the experience. \n\nI can say I've been there and done that, but I have no real interest in going back.", "author": "Sarah K."}

The only problem is how do we know it is as good? \n\nMy friends and I came to the restaurant 10 minutes before the kitchen's closed, so we had to order quickly and leave. I must say they definitely deserve 5 stars for customer service, the host was prompt and polite, while the waitress was respectful, quick to take orders and serve, and always attentive with our needs. \n\nThe food didn't wow me though. Everything was cooked to perfection, but the flavors were just okay. I order the Jokbal Ssam (lettuce wraps with pig's trotter) created by the Korean Chef Byung Jin Kim in South Korean. I absolutely adore Korean food and ate it a lot growing up, Korean food just has all these unique flavors to it that not everyone likes. That was definitely true of this dish, especially since I prefer the acquired taste. The trotter was cooked perfectly, too, but the flavor of it was too much like herbal medicine. For the Sage Smoked Dark Chocolate Brownie recreated from Dominique Ansel in NYC, it was good and moist - the fudged type of brownie. They baked the brownie, used a slightly thick cardboard paper to wrap it, and grilled the sides for a more intense flavor. You would think that the flavor would be amazing since they also add sage on the top and bottom of the brownie slice, but no... not really. It just tasted like regular good brownie (no sage flavoring and the grilling did nothing). \n\nFor the price and hype, I don't think it is worth it. I really like the concept, so I would be willing to give this place another try. \n\nP.S. There are always two menu - the bar and the restaurant. When you walk-in, without reservations, you only have the options to eat from the bar menu, which is a smaller selection. Always make reservations before coming to see and taste everything. The portions are very small, but some are filling. Bring a small group, 4-6 people, and order everything to try. You'll save a bills by doing that.", "author": "Lily V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "I came with 7 friends to share the culinary pleasure (and financial pain) of sampling a greatest hits compilation of various Michelin Star-awarded restaurants. A few notes:\n-The decor felt a little sterile, between the white walls and light wood table and chairs, not a particularly romantic place for a date if you care about ambiance\n-Food service is fast; we waited probably less than 2 minutes between courses. If you come and don't really care to talk to any of your dining companion(s), you could be in and out in under an hour\n-Attire is casual but I mistakenly wore a T-shirt and felt majorly under-dressed\n-You get hit with the 20% gratuity up front which may be why our server had a little bit of RBF (and also mixed up our chicken thighs for apocalypse burgers)\n\nFood:\nNo more profiteroles?! NOOOO!!!\n\nShrimp and grits: Between the shrimp oil and the bits of shrimp, it's essentially eating the essence of shrimp with the consistency of grits. Only thing missing was a little bit of heat which the pickled jalapenos did not provide. 5/5\n\nChicken thighs: be sure to pop the spa egg before you start this dish. This dish screams comfort, as it's basically tender pieces of chicken thighs served in teriyaki sauce, served on a bed of really unsightly iceberg lettuce. The chicken thigh is a throwback to Japanese food court stalls (Sakkio Japan, anyone?) which is comfort food from my childhood, really. It loses a point on creativity and the accompanying veg, but I can't deny that eating this dish made me feel good inside. 4/5\n\nWasabi lobster: kudos to whoever invented this dish, it's whimsical and pretty delicious. A long sliver of lobster tail, battered, fried and then covered in wasabi rice crispies, then served over a mix of the jelly and vinagrette together to give it a somewhat sticky consistency. The wasabi doesn't overwhelm the lobster flavor, and the sweet and sour of the jelly-vinagrette combo go well with the sweet meat. The flavors are all there, bouncing around in different places in your mouth; my only complaints were that it didn't taste freshly fried as the crust lacked crisp and the lobster interior tasted only warm, if not cool. 4.5/5\n\nOctopus: I wanted to love this dish, but maybe there's something about really tender octopus that I have a hard time with...I probably miss the little bit of bouncy resistance that I'm accustomed to when eating cephalopods. The seaweed flavor permeates all parts of this dish and, combined with the octopus, is an umami overload in a slightly unpleasant way; I wish there was a slight vinegar element to cut through the richness. To compound things, it's served with a broth that offers, surprise, more umami - please follow their advice and sip it slowly. That being said, I can see why others might would love this dish. 3/5\n\nDuck breast: on the subject of texture and consistency, I love the flavor of duck but usually find it hard to stomach when duck breast is cooked perfectly but served as a large slab: the flesh is extremely dense and intense by nature, it's like eating a meat-brick. I know, they give you a knife for this reason, but still. In other disappointing news, it tasted like just about any other (decently-executed) duck breast dish, nothing particularly noteworthy. 2.5/5\n\nThe forest: I could consider becoming vegetarian for dishes like this. The flavors are earthy and rich, with a variety of textures between the mushrooms to the grainy quinoa and whatever tasty mousse that comes with it. I had heard good things about this dish and it met if not exceeded expectation. 4.5/5\n\nUmami soup: The umami depth of this dish doesn't compare to the octopus. Also, having wagyu in this format is really strange, as the consistency of tender waygu with soft noodles results in a mouthful of mush. This was my first time having thin Inaniwa udon so I have no basis for comparison, but the noodles were like typical dry white noodles you can buy in a huge 5 lbs box for $7 at your local Asian grocer. Most expensive AND disappointing dish of the night. 2/5\n\nGuinea fowl larp: very herbaceous, this tasted like Vietnamese b\u00f2 t\u00e1i chanh minus the beef carpaccio and lime juice. It was billed as very spicy which half of our table agreed with and the other half felt was barely spicy at all, so either the chilies are spread inconsistently or a few of us are just extremely resistant to this form of heat. 4/5\n\nInterpretation of vanity: aptly named because we kept repeating, \"[it looks pretty but] there's nothing there!!!\" The cake tasted like standard chocolate mousse, and I didn't taste the almond. Meh face. 2/5\n\nWood sorrel: money. Just a touch sweet, a little tart from the yogurt, and super refreshing, a palate cleanser and dessert in one. 4.5/5\n\nLemon tart: what a tasty mess. I wish the tart was more thick/custardy. The presentation leaves you eating cookie crust dipped in lemon curd.

And a little bit too much so. I never quite felt comfortable and relaxed in it. That is not to say that the design is not beautiful. The details are clearly well thought out, including the cutlery sets, which I would gladly adopt for my own place (and the signatory around SF Heath Ceramics). \n\nI assume if you're reading this that you're familiar with the concept -- the restaurant recreates the signature dishes of upscale restaurants around the world. The most familiar one would probably be \"Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart\". I didn't have a chance to inquire about this, but I would imagine to be able to put dishes of such iconic gravity, the chefs at In Situ are required to spend sometime training in the kitchens of the dishes' origins, under the creators themselves. \n\nOk, to the food:\nMy absolute favorite was The Forest, which I would come back to the restaurant for anytime, and is pretty much the main reason I'm writing this review. I'm not a vegetarian, and naturally tend to stray away from meatless dishes. This one blew my mind. First of all, the presentation itself is worthy of a plaque in Moma, a pleasant arrangement that truly does convey a patch of foliage in a forest. The flavor packed in this dish is simply unbelievable, and is accentuated by the textures. There are at least six different types of mushrooms in there, all incredible aromatic. The dish tastes of earth, but not in a dirty way. There was a crunchy mushroom in there that had the texture of what I would imagine biting into a crunchy leaf would feel like, and it tasted like heaven. Perfectly complemented by the creamy quinoa risotto, to which the quinoa itself brought a similar earthiness. It was all uplifted by a tangy cream sauce and the parsley sponges that brought a nice greenery to the surface. 10/10 would do again and again and again. It's worth mentioning, that I imagine this dish easily costing far more anywhere else, and if you want to try upscale cuisine without this pretense, this is the place. \n\nOther noteworthy mentions are the wasabi lobster, and the glazed chicken. Note: I almost ate the glazed chicken wrong, and was interrupted by a distant \"no! drop the chicken! put down the fork\". The waiter came over the explain that there was an egg hidden in there that must be mixed together to give the dish its full essence. He wasn't wrong, and the gesture was deeply appreciated. \n\nI'll also give great props to the Kalbi dish. The short ribs were as tender as can be, and falling off the bone into a deeply flavorful broth. The rice with this dish, too, was for lack of a better expression, on point. \n\nThe lemon tart was good. Definitely aesthetically appealing and playful, the plate adding to the feel of brokenness. That being said, I think I prefer my lemon tarts in one piece.", "author": "Rita K."}

Expensive, but every dish is different and pretty good. Minor improvements on some dishes.  \n\nFresh Stone Crab Claw-steamed with egg white and Chinese wine-beautiful presentation. Good amount of crab and the egg was so smooth, but just a little too much Chinese wine for me. \n\nOctopus and the Coral braised octopus and seaweed (spicy)-never been a huge fan of octopus, but this was super good. Not over chewy and great flavors. Only the seaweed had a little kick to it. \n\nLiberty Duck Breast-French green lentils, apples, aged red wine vinegar sauce-had to try because this is from French Laundry. It was cooked perfectly and it was yummy, but I felt that I had better duck else where. For this being from FL-I expected to be super amazed. \n\nThe Forest-quinoa risotto, mushrooms, parsley \"moss\"-the presentation really looks like a forest, but it was delicious. Love the flavors and textures of everything. \n\nSpicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes-sichuan peppercorn, yu choy-the rice cakes were perfect, but a bit too much peppercorn. Starting numbing my mouth and had to drink a ton of water. Don't eat too much of the other stuff with it. That's where the peppercorn is overkill. \n\nOops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart-presentation is NOT nice at all. Looks like a blob, but it was very yummy. They give about 6 different sauces to try with it to see how the different flavors mend together, BUT it's only a drop of each sauce. It was too hard to share that part.

One option at In Situ was to sit in the lounge--but only at high counters & stools. To sit low, I had to agree to eat in the restaurant and order two courses.\n\n(I eventually came to find In Situ ISN'T the museum cafe - Cafe 5 on the fifth floor IS.

That's it. Five pellets of chicken thigh totaling maybe 6 ounces, (billed as a medium-sized dish) served in a bed of inedible cedar branch tips with a child's-fist sized pine cone, in a basket. It was tasty--for all of the three minutes it took to eat.\n\nI work in the wine industry and have eaten at many Michelin restaurants and have never felt like I was flat out angry or betrayed at what was presented to me.

For me, the stand out dishes were Noma's wood sorrel and sheep's milk yoghurt and the French Laundry's liberty duck breast. My only complaint about the food is that many of the dishes do not complement others. For example, the guinea foul larb's spicyness will pretty much overpower any subsequent dish. The meal lacked flow and cohesion.\n\nOur near-perfect meal was undermined by Timothy's subpar service. Given the mandatory 20 percent gratuity, I would expect him to, at the very least, be polite. His conduct reminded me of waitstaff from a neglected Chinatown joint: Banging of glasses and utensils, passive-aggressive tone. Not once during the meal did he have the courtesy to ask if we wanted more beverages, were done with the dishes or wanted dessert. These things should be common sense to waitstaff a restaurant of this caliber. Perhaps Timothy knew but did not give a flying fuck. After we were done with dessert, he slapped the bill onto the table and walked off without mere eye-contact. We intended to have tea, but he clearly wanted us out.

And I really didn't like In Situ, though I guess I came short of outright hating it.\n\nI ate in the lounge, since dining room reservations are tough to come by. The menu is stripped down but there are still quite a few different options. And each one of them feels like it has reached Peak Precious and isn't about to turn back. Soup in a shot glass. Fried chicken in pine salt comes in a little basket of pine boughs with a pine cone. A tiny single-layer tomato tort that feels gossamer thin. \n\nI get that they're small plates and I get that they're doing \"food as art,\" but food also needs to be food. I walked out unhappy at spending $50 for lunch, ordering the heaviest things on the menu, and still feeling hungry. I was grumpy about it until I got a giant BBQ pork bun in chinatown for $1.20 and felt better about life.\n\nI'm not sure if I regret eating at In Situ or not, but I am sure that I didn't really enjoy the meal or the experience; didn't like the art I suppose.

SFMOMA used to have a slightly expensive but good restaurant, like The deYoung and the Legion of Honor. We didn't realize what we were getting into. We should have stuck in the lounge where I noticed the highest prices for a glass of wine outside New York,and had a few bites that were pricey but not outrageous. By the time we had waited for a table and were seated in the restaurant, we came to realize that the $14 burger was going to be one bite, at most. Oh well, we're here.\n\nI've eaten at a lot of top notch restaurants, and at a 2 start Michelin in Caceres, Spain just a year ago. This is not a top restaurant. I thought the atmosphere was sterile, the timing and attentiveness of the wait staff a bit better than your average downhome restaurant, though they were dressed better. Overall, I would say, from the hostess to the staff, we were not made to feel appreciated or comfortable.\n\nThe food was good, the dishes interesting in the eclecticism, but nothing spectacular. And so teeney you had to order more in order to not go hungry.\n\nThey try to make you think it is a Michelin starred restaurant because the chef once worked at the French Laundry, but they have not been awarded a star. The food was interesting in its flavors, the wines good - better be for $20 a glass - but something was lacking.\n\nI would not waste my money here again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-08", "description": "3.5/5\n\nWandered into In Situ for a bite during an SFMOMA visit. We were presented with two menus-- one for a dining area and another that was more lounge/cafe oriented. Despite the menu distinction, which was described to us as differing in plate size and price, there was no significant spatial separation between the two dining areas. We chose the cafe.\n\nFood (and its price): The food selections are from chefs of different cuisines and geographies, both of which make for a very eclectic menu. All of the dishes were delicious and thoughtfully created, although the clear stand out was the Caramelized Carrot Soup, which I would insist very diner order because it really is THAT good. Don't worry about getting filled up, though; it comes in the size of a shot glass. For $6, at a dollar a bite it was worth every single penny (maybe more, but ssh don't give them any ideas). I wish I could give the same feedback for the other two dishes we tried-- at $16 the Summery Warm Tomato and Basil Tart is very good, but overpriced. It might also be 6 inches in diameter, another dollar per bite scenario. The Creole BBQ Shrimp and Grits was lovely and a great combination of flavors, however I found the shrimp to be a little too chewy for my taste. And while $22 still seemed high, the filling nature of the dish and portion size made it worth it.  \n\nWine: A comprehensive selection, however, I didn't care for the overwhelming preference of serving carafes instead of glasses. \n\nService: No complaints. Our waitress made good suggestions, but the service experience wasn't particularly memorable. \n\nAtmosphere: For the lounge area, there is a lot of communal seating, perhaps more than is necessary. Would like to see a few smaller seating areas. \n\nConcept: A very fitting restaurant for SFMOMA-- innovative concept, wonderful opportunity to read about the chefs who designed these dishes and their backgrounds. A merger between art and food. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're in SFMOMA and need a small bite, stop in for a few \"shots\" of Caramelized Carrot Soup and a carafe of wine, and read about the food creations and their histories. Then head out and do a proper dinner at another one of the neighborhood's many restaurants which will be lighter on your wallet and much more filling.", "author": "Sam H."}

We've really enjoyed it in the past, but this latest visit was somewhat disappointing, mainly the service.  We were in very early for dinner - hardly anyone in the restaurant.  A server came to take our wine order - then we waited for 10 or 15 minutes, with no one even saying anything to us, including the server who provided our wine.  Finally, a completely different person came to take our order.  We had questions about the menu, which were not answered very completely.  In fact, one of the dishes, which had been on the menu for awhile, had \"cheese\" in its title, obviously a main ingredient.  We asked her what kind of cheese - she had no idea and had to ask the kitchen.  Obviously, there is very little communication between the kitchen and waitstaff.  Throughout the meal, someone different came by with every course - we had to wave in the air if we had a question or needed something, because there was no regular server for us.  It made the meal very uncomfortable.  By the way, some of the waitstaff were very accomplished and knowledgeable, as we heard them explain things at other tables.  Why they have these servers who ignore you and know nothing is beyond me.  Food was okay - the cheese starter had no flavor unless you used the accompanying chili sauce (sauce was not even mentioned on the menu).  Main course was good, but not as creative as we've had in the past.  The dessert, a Brie cheesecake, originated by Adria, was beyond wonderful!  It reminded me of our previous visits with the excellent food and service.  With the service questions at issue, the 20% mandatory \"tip\" seemed ridiculous, at least for some of the staff.  In Situ should make sure its service lives up to that.  It would also be helpful if there were some written descriptions of the dishes, as some servers don't seem to know.", "author": "Sharon B."}

The overall TLDR is you get decent food at absurd prices where there is not a lot of value. Additionally, the wine selection and pricing was laughable.\n\nWe attended in Situ this weekend and were seated promptly for our reservation. The front of the house staff was attentive. The first thing you notice when you walk into the space, is that while the ambiance is clearly meant to make you feel like you are in the MOMA, there is a austere starkness to the decor. It lacks character and is a bit stale for my tastes.\n\nIn terms of the food, overall I would give it a 3.5-4 star rating.\n\nShrimp and Grits were the highlight of the meal. The creamy grits were balanced with a jalapeno tang and a softness that made it mouth watering.\n\nThe Octopus was overcooked and for $28 and all this fuss, you'd expect more.\n\nThe Duck and the Forest were both well prepared. The Forest was impressive and innovative with mushrooms that made us want to come back for more. The Duck could have been seasoned a bit more, but no major complaint.\n\nThe major gripe of this place is the value (food and wine) and the portions. For a table of 2, we ordered 4 dishes and had a carafe of wine ($29 for a 7oz pour), so with an included gratuity of 20%, the meal was $220 and we were both still hungry. The wine list is priced in an intentional way to get you to buy a wildly over-priced bottle. Charging $22+ for a 7oz carafe and not providing wines by the glass, is clearly meant to push the guest to opt for the bottles, which by my searching were marked up 1-2x more than a normal restaurant. \n\nI'll happily pay $200+ for a great meal, great service, great ambiance, but this place falls short for the price tag.\n\nOverall, In Situ wants to be a fancy destination but lacks the gravitas and the performance to back it up.", "author": "Justin O."}

But the service was too spotty to make it a dining experience worthy of the quality of food (and prices!) \n\n\nFull Review: When you serve Michelin level food (and at Michelin level prices), one expects Michelin level service. Unfortunately, In Situ didn't bring it. The truth is, delicious food does not automatically equal a great and memorable dining experience. Although many of the dishes were cooked to near perfection, that alone wasn't enough to save the meal.    \n\nWhile I love the concept of the restaurant, the timing and flow of the meal was a bit jarring at times.  We were only halfway done with our Shrimp Grits when the server plopped down our next course of Octopus and the Coral. We ended up quickly scarfing down the rest of the grits so we could start the Octopus, but the rice crackers were still not crisp anymore when we got to them. Afterward, they brought out both the Umami Soup and The Forest at the same time. Not wanting the beef to become overdone or the noodles to get soggy, we ate the Soup first. When we finally got to The Forest, everything was a bit wilted and cold. All the effort the chefs put into recreating these great dishes ended up being a bit wasted because we couldn't really savor the food.\n\nIn regards to the service, there weren't any specific glaring problems, just a series of small things that made me feel like they wanted us to leave as soon as possible - being unapologetically asked to wait 15+ minutes after we arrived on time for a reservation, a rude look from a server when I asked a question, empty wine glasses that sat on the table for the entire meal without anyone asking if we wanted another, an attempt to engage with a server about a dish only to receive a brisk reply as if they couldn't be bothered to talk about the food they were giving us, etc. I realize these are all minor grievances and at a typical restaurant would be too nit picky. But when you're paying over $100 per person for a light lunch, and a 20% tip is automatically included, you expect a bit more than the typical.  I find that when a restaurant has poor service, it's never a problem with a specific server but rather an issue from the top-down. I am sure that at all the amazing restaurants where the dishes come from, equal emphasis is placed on quality of service as it is on quality of food. \n\nMaybe the problem is In Situ needs to figure out what kind of restaurant it wants to be. Do they want to give people a truly great dining experience, and be a top SF destination?  Or do they just want to serve some good food to tourists and have that be that? If it is the former, they should realize that the dining experience starts when you walk through the door, and can live or die by how welcome (or unwelcome) the staff makes you feel.  If it's the latter, they might as well serve a Shake Shack burger and save the chefs all their time, talent, and effort.", "author": "Cat M."}

And you are not really wrong for wanting that, you are just in the wrong place.\nIt is absolutely ok to crave for a big, satisfying plate, but you can't blame a high-end restaurant with a superb cuisine that aims to something completely different if you are disappointed.\nThis is most definitely one of the best restaurants in California, their food is impeccable, the concept they support is splendid (find out), the place they are in is truly enjoyable, their attention to design in every possible regard is highly commendable, so please, know where you are going before you dare to write. \nWe were in SF for four days. \nWe ate there once.\nAnd then again.\nAnd then we went for thirds. We gladly cancelled other reservations because nothing we ever ate before in SF was comparable to this quality and concept-wise.\nWe couldn't have enough of it, and we come from LA where there is no shortage of cutting edge, high-end cuisine. AND THIS IS AMONG THE BEST WE EXPERIENCED.\nWe tried, literally, everything in their menu, some items more than once.\nOur interactions with everyone were so informative, unpretentious, charming, upbeat and warm that we had learn the names of the staff, so thanks Bob, Kim, Kyu, Emily, Samantha and all there, and of course our utmost gratitude to the people behind the scenes.\nYou know what you are doing, and it is deeply appreciated.\nThe sound level is heaven, no thumping loud non-music, no trying to create \"ambience\" blasting your eardrums, so completely grateful for that.\nAs said, every detail: the carved wood comunal tables, the cutlery, the sculptural ceiling, the walls, the artwork, the plates, the cups, the light features, I can go on and on about the amount of thinking that all has in, from decor to plating to service to concept.\nThey are brilliant. Period.\nEnjoy, knowing where you are, and knowing why you are there.\n\nIt's not their fault if you wanted a pizza or steak frites and thought this was the museum cafeteria. Or if you wanted to spend just a ten bill. There are perfectly adequate places to do that. This is something else, in the extended meaning of the phrase.\n\nDear In Situ: we'll be back!!!!\nPeace", "author": "Gabriel S."}

The server was attentive and was available for any questions. However, service was extremely slow. Both the dining room and lounge area weren't packed by any means, but we waited a good 20 minutes between each plate of food. We arrived at noon and didn't leave until 1:15pm.\n\nFood: 3/5\n- Spicy Pork Sausage Rice Cakes ($22): We had the original one at Momofuku Ssam Bar @ NYC and although it was a while since we had it, we definitely remember the original being much better. This was probably our favorite dish of the meal, however, since we've had better, it was still a letdown. We loved the crispy rice cakes, but there didn't seem too much sausage or veggies. I also didn't like the random peppercorns that were sprinkled around because once you got unlucky and bit into one, the flavor profile that came out definitely didn't match anything else in the dish.\n\n- Liberty Duck Breast ($34): Overall, this dish wasn't bad, but it didn't wow us. We've also had much better duck breast at other places around town. The skin wasn't crispy except for some edges and although the lentils were cooked well and the sauce was really rich, it was pretty one note. We haven't been to The French Laundry so we can't say whether this did Thomas Keller justice.\n \n- Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart ($16): We got this because we saw the dish on a food show somewhere. It took a good 30 minutes of waiting to get this dish despite ordering it with our entrees. It was a pretty big let down to be honest. The only thing going for it is the presentation. You get a splash of lemon curd, ice cream, and a broken cookie along with tiny pieces of random samples to eat with the tart. The curd was warm and when mixed with the cold ice cream, it ended up being really weird in your mouth. I also found that if you were unlucky and just got the curd and no ice cream, it had a pretty bad bitter aftertaste.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nThe restaurant was modern, clean, and matched SF MOMA. Despite the Dining Room being fairly full, it was really quiet in the room and you could easily have a conversation.\n\nValue: 1/5\nFor 2 entrees and 1 dessert, we ended up spending nearly $100 for two people. We also weren't stuffed. In terms of value, it was really bad. We felt the food to be average and what you're really paying for is presentation, the ability to say that you've tried out dishes from some Michelin starred or world renowned restaurants, and the convenience of eating at MOMA before/after going into the exhibits. We would really recommend you save your money, walk a few blocks and eat at the Metreon area. Take that money you saved and actually go to one of those restaurants instead.", "author": "NoonNarin N."}

You go through the galleries, get stimulated through visuals and sounds, admire the architecture of the new building and the living wall, and then enter In Situ.  Again, admire the design of the tables and chairs, plates and silverware, and travel through cities and countries to get a flavor of different restaurants around the world, through different dishes and flavors.  \n\nEven the menu was more interesting in its design and concept than in its practicality and user-friendliness.  It's almost like some sort of info-graphic puzzle. \n\nThe dishes were good, but disjointed, unsurprisingly.  In any other upscale restaurant, you wouldn't necessarily start with a shrimp grit dish with some heat and follow by rich earthy quinoas and finish with light goat cheese dessert from Noma.  \n\nMaybe the meal is more for your brain than for your belly.  \n\nI still think it's a cool concept though.

The atmosphere is really bright and airy, and (unlike what some of the other reviews say) the service we got was very attentive and helpful.  The food, however, was the star:\n- Shrimp grits (4/5) - Buttery shrimp formed into grits, which goes really well with the few slices of pickled jalapeno.  The dish is sprinkled with concentrated shrimp oil that tastes like it just came out of a shrimp head.\n- Wasabi lobster (5/5) - A perfectly cooked piece of lobster meat covered with tiny, crispy wasabi chips, resting on some mango jelly and vinaigrette.  All of the ingredients are very intensely flavored in their own rights but come together perfectly to make something better than the sum of their parts.  Incredible.\n- The forest (3.5/5) - It's vegetarian.\n- Spicy pork sausage and rice cakes (5/5) - Whereas everything else we had here was clearly \"fine dining,\" this was just a pretty basic (by comparison) dish executed perfectly.  The Sichuan peppercorn, green onions, and garlic were perfectly in balance, and the firm yet chewy rice cakes were great for soaking up all the great flavors.  Also a decent portion size.\n- Wood sorrel and sheep's milk yogurt (4/5) - A unique blend of sheep's milk yogurt, some sugar, and wood sorrel granita that just works great together.\n\nOverall, the meal was delicious and expensive, although not THAT expensive compared to how much you would spend at other fancy restaurants in the area for food that's not this good.  For the two of us, our bill came out to $150 including tip (no drinks), and we were comfortably full.", "author": "Simon L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-26", "description": "Overhyped and over priced.  \n\nThe Good:  Great concept and the design & food was esthetically pleasing.  The restaurant was very accommodating bc our flight arrived late and they pushed our reservation back a few times which was very nice and appreciated.  It didn't seem that a reservation was necessary as we found the restaurant less than half full at 8:30pm on a Friday night.  Nice compilation of world renowned Michelin star rchefs. Gorgeous presentation of dishes done masterfully and most were delicious. Great service- server was clear in her presentation and explanation of somewhat complicated sounding/looking dishes.  \n\nThe OK:   It was incredibly over priced for one-two bite dishes.  Most would suffice as an amuse bouche. For the price of each dish and small portions, we left feeling meh and hungry.  We were automatically charged 20% gratuity without having the option to leave less or more.  The server was deserving of the 20% gratuity, though it would have been nice to have been cleared of courses before the following course was brought out.  Also, courses were brought out before we were finished which we felt should have been held until we finished our course.  \n\nWe ordered just about everything on the menu, excluding the tomato velvet and shrimp, the burger and the pig trotter.  \n1. Cuttlefish Cappuccino ($18):  Yummy considering the off-putting name.  It tasted like a chowder.  Creamy, savory, and yummy tender morsels of cuttlefish. (some didn't like the consistency)\n2. Tapioca cheese fritters ($12) (Dadinhos de Tapioca) were interesting cubes of something similar to a  hash brown. It was different, not really awe inspiring.  5- 1 inch cubes.\n3. Butter Chicken Wings ($18) - Also in cubed form.  Tasty cubes of deboned chicken wings. The butter sauce was velvety and filled with umami.  Not sure why they messed with the very perfect chicken wing though.  Also weird that it was in a cube like the tapioca from a different chef.  6- one inch cubes\n4. Red Ravioli ($12)- Heaven our mouths. Tender pillow filled with liquid gold. A true highlight of the night!   Wish there were more than just 1 ravioli per order!  \n5. Summery Warm Tomato & Basil Tart ($18) - Honestly, I would not order this again. Unfortunately, underwhelming and crazy expensive for a 5\" disk of bland puff pastry and unforgettable tomatoes. Just did not tickle the palate.\n6. Wasabi Lobster ($26) - OMG!!  A favorite of the night! The lobster was tender, succulent; all accompaniments made a harmonious dish.  The wasabi marshmallow was a treat.  I'd order this again. Yuumm!  Tim Raue is a genius. One small tail and a claw.\n7. Glazed Chicken Thigh ($22) -This dish was good. There are better dishes.  If you want chicken, order the butter chicken wings.  I was confused by the random iceberg type lettuce serving as a moat around the chicken thigh pieces resembling samples you would get at a mall food court.  7ish pieces of chicken.\n8. Lamb Shank Mant\u0131 ($30) - Eyes widened when our table saw this on the menu.  I don't eat lamb, but the general consensus was that it was gamey.  Not good with my group.  5 nice size (2\") dumpling/tortellini.\n9. The Forest ($32) - The most beautiful and delicious dish of the night. Gorgeous presentation left us in awe as we meandered through the dish, savoring each bite of each variety of mushroom bursting with deep flavors.  Quinoa risotto, a first for our table. We ate slowly, savored each bite filled with tender and crunchy morsels of goodness. The \"Moss\" was captivating, interesting, and unique. We're still perplexed by it.  \n10. Jasper Hill Farm Cheesecake ($22) - The finale of our In Situ experience.  Our server told us in the beginning of our meal that they need to be ordered 15 minutes in advance.  Eager to try it, we ordered it right then and there.  When it arrived at our table we looked at it perplexed.  It honestly looked like a wheel of brie that was baked in the oven.  We dug in and again we were confused.  Was it brie?  It tasted like a semi-sweet brie with a graham cracker crust.   Unfortunately it was lost on us.  It was also absurd that it was $22.  \n\nOverall it was a nice experience.  I don't mind spending the cash on a nice dinner, but I do mind when we paid close to $400 and left hungry.", "author": "Chita P."}

The menu had changed, but we were excited to try new things anyway. The stone crab, served in a huge puddle of congealed egg whites, was gross. The caramelized carrot soup was a favorite of my friend, but even though it was a teeny tiny portion, it was way too rich for me to finish. \n\nThe buttermilk fried chicken (basically chicken fingers) was too salty, but the chicken was silky and I loved the texture of the breading. The creole shrimp was fine, but nowhere near as exciting as the shrimp grits that was on the menu a few weeks ago. The Forest is just stunning to look at, full of interesting textures and flavors...fun to try once but you won't exactly be craving it.\n\nI understand the experimental, artistic nature of a restaurant like this and appreciate that there will be hits and misses.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-25", "description": "First of all, the ambience is beautiful, as the restaurant is located inside MOMA. Not since I've been to Picasso in Vegas have I had so much art so near my meal! Service was friendly and helpful although a bit inexperienced. Wine was excellent.\n\nHighlight of this meal was Guinea fowl larp chiang mai, a spicy mixture of guinea fowl and various vegetables. This was superior to any other larp type dishes I have eaten, and although spicy was interesting and fresh. \n\nFor me the meal was ruined by the duck, \"Liberty duck breast\" with lentils and apples in red wine sauce. The duck was overcooked to where it was gray (see picture). It was tough and dry. \n\nParticularly offensive is that In Situ claims this dish is from The French Laundry. The French Laundry, like all great restaurants, cooks their duck with a red or dark pink interior, getting a moist, rich flavor. For In Situ to claim they are using Keller's recipe when they cook their duck much longer than he does is misrepresentation. (If you cannot get to the French Laundry to try their duck easily, google image  \"French Laundry duck\" to see how duck is served there). \n\nEven a good restaurant will sometimes overcook a dish. But this dish was actually plated with the duck already cut. The chef and the waiter HAD TO HAVE KNOWN that the duck was cooked to a gray color at the time it was served, because the duck interior was plainly visible. (For some dishes, like steak served whole, possibly the chef might not know the dish was overcooked). \n\nSo there are two possibilities. Either (a) the chef and waiter knew the duck was overcooked and were hoping the diner wouldn't have the nerve to send it back; or (b) the chef and waiter actually believe duck should be served gray.\n\nIf (a) is true, maybe there is hope. It's easy for the owner to explain to the employees that the restaurant loses more business from a cheated diner than it gains by recooking overcooked dishes properly.\n\nOn the other hand, if (b) is true - if the chef and waiter believe that duck should be cooked grey in this dish - then there may be no remedy. If (b) is true, it would mean the employees lack experience with good food. There is no simple, timely fix for that. Since the employees and owner think they are doing the right thing by serving duck cooked grey, they have no reason to think they need to change.", "author": "Hungry S."}

Although I haven't been to the new SFMOMA yet, I knew I had to check out this restaurant ASAP. We snagged ressies for a Sat afternoon around 2 pm. Our table was ready when we arrived. The space is minimalist and very modern. It's also very open and they don't cram as many tables in there as possible, lending it an air of privacy despite the vastness. I had read up on the restaurant before arriving so I knew there would be a mish mash of selected and curated dishes from renowned chefs all over the world! Where else would you get to try all these dishes under 1 roof??? The food was delicious. We weren't too hungry so 2 large dishes (the forest and guinea fowl larp) and a dessert (wood sorrel and sheep's milk yogurt) was sufficient. Everything was delicious!!! The Forest resembled a delicate piece of art on your dish and the guinea fowl was spicy (they include fresh herbs and greens to help you out!) For me the highlight was the dessert by Noma. The wood sorrel (a plant) was frozen into little pieces and the sheep's milk yogurt was covered by a thin layer of crystallized sugar! The meal for 2 was $110+. I personally loved the experience. If you are here just to get a bite to eat, you will likely walk away very disappointed, hungry, and broke, but if you want an amazing experience and the ability to try dishes from world renowned chefs under 1 roof, this is the place! \n\nOne flaw was that service was pretty slow and lagging, which makes sense when I realized that a 20% service fee automatically added onto your bill.

I had the buttermilk fried chicken and pine salt for $14, which came out like overcooked, dry McNuggets on pine branches which made the food taste like an oily Christmas tree. I was still hungry. The caramelized carrot soup was yummy, but the size of a small espresso cup. Not very filling at 6. Finally, we also had the Dadinhos de Tapioca, $12 which had only six small cubes on the plate.

Ok, I get it, the menu is complex, and even has a graphical semiotic guide to wine pairings, and the prices are, not low. And its feng shui is hard to pin down between communal tables and low-slung banquettes and a more traditional setting in the back. Look, here's the deal: the food is amazing, the wines are the best curated all-California list I've seen in quite some time, and most of all the service ethic is Michelin-class (perhaps knowing they will get a fair tip in the automatic 20% helps, especially in a venue with so many low-tipping foreign tourists). Here's the additional ingredient to why great service + great wine = five stars:  you get fine dining from Barcelona, Seoul, Istanbul, Provence, Berlin, Sao Paolo, and oh yeah, NYC.  The curated menu idea is brilliant, but its only going to work if you have a kitchen team with the requisite technical skills and ingredients, and wow, under Corey Lee that is in place. Please, when you go, understand the menu -- those people who complain about portion size and leaving hungry have only themselves to blame as it is all shown in the menu -- what other resto gives you that?

I ordered the fried chicken which came on a bed of plastic pine needles surrounding a large pine cone. Maybe this was to make this $14.00 dish look like you're getting more than what your getting which is 6 or 7 very very small chicken nuggets with no flavor. Well to be fair they had a flavor: unpleasant. My husband had a hot dog which was nothing special. I had a cup of tea and he had some juice. The bill came to $47 dollars!!! The shtick here is that they tell you which chef dreamed up the dish-- chicken was a chef from Barcelona. The hot dog from a London chef. It's a gimmick that unfortunately just makes you disappointed when you actually taste the unexceptional food.\n\nIt got stranger though when after we paid the bill, the server asked if we had her pen? We realized we accidentally had taken it and handed it back to her. She then said she needed it because if the servers lose a pen they have to reimburse the restaurant for it!  The crazy thing was that the pen was one of those pens you get for 10 in a packet at Walgreens. Maybe In Situ needs to spend some of their huge profits on pens in bulk.", "author": "Maxine S."}

But after we sat down and really looked at the finishes, you can see all the care that went into the space, and how well it fits with the Moma. That said, the bar/lounge is not a happy/convivial place. We much preferred the dining area, where we had a good seat and were able to peer into the kitchen.\n\nThe menu was a work of art in itself, with some very good hints on wine pairing. We ordered and shared the following:\n\n- The Forest\n- The French Laundry Duck\n- The Szechuan rice cakes\n\nAll were delicious, with the standout being the Forest. It was probably one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. All the mushrooms and the farro risotto and the sauce - such distinct flavors and textures!! Now we want to go to France just to eat at Mirazur. The duck was delicious and extremely well made, but more conventional. The rice cake had amazing texture and real szechuan peppercorns with the numbing quality. It was so much fun to go around the world in a single meal!\n\nWine list was on the expensive side, but it was nice that they offered 200ml mini-carafes, so you could do your own pairing. We got a bottle of the Rhone red to go with the mushrooms and the duck, and a mini-carafe of Albarino for the rice cake. Both were on the less expensive end but went very well with the food.\n\nAll in all, about $150 for 2, including the 20% mandatory service charge.

The concept here is something I had thought would be great - it's essentially a chefs idea of a cover band - replicating signature dishes from famous chefs around the world (with their permission) so you get a chance to try some things you may never even see in your life.\nAmbience: Very up-scale, bordering on pretentious. Did not really appreciate the hard wooden seating in the restaurant. For the price it should be a little more comfortable, rather than the obvious emphasis on modern chic. The menu was very pretentious - much explanation about the vision of each chef featured for each dish.\nService: Very professional. \nFood: Disappointing. The menu was very limited and half the dishes were only a few bites in size (and if you've read my reviews I'm usually complaining about portions being way too big). Sure, they were marvelous tasting bites, but after two entrees I was still hungry and ended up going elsewhere for more food. The wine menu was also very limited. Back to the food - I tried the lobster which was barely the size of two nigiri. Wonderful flavors but you'll be left wanting more. The other dish I tried was the shrimp and grits (even after being warned, like all the diners, that it was spicy - it wasn't). This was a least a reasonable portion and once again very flavorful. \nPrice: Way over the top for what you get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-07", "description": "Glad that In Situ is in situ!\nWife and I made reservations at In Situ for 5:30 PM on a Saturday to follow our viewing of the Munch exhibition that afternoon.  We had some apprehension about this considering the very mixed reviews In Situ received and the reservation required a credit card, too.  Wife thought the negative reviews were probably more accurate and the positive ones were probably from the owner Corey Lee's friends.  I thought the originality of In Situ's concept was worth a try- the concept of recreating flagship dishes of famous chefs from around the world, all in situ.  After a very satisfying but tiring afternoon of Munch's works and other wonderful modern art including multimedia and our favorites like Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Magritte, Miro, etc., we entered In Situ from the museum entrance (it has two entrances, one from the museum lobby and another directly from the street).  The restaurant seemed to be an extension of the lobby, a large area with high ceiling, with a slightly upper and lower area at street level with very large windows (or glass walls) to the street.  The tables were wooden, and the upper area had wooden chairs while the lower area had more comfortable black cushioned ones.  At 5:10 PM, the restaurant was not crowded and we requested to be seated in the lower area with more comfortable seats though they seemed to veer most customers to the upper area.  We were promptly seated comfortably near the glass wall with full view of the street outside.  The menu was indeed interesting - each dish had short descriptions and the chef's name and restaurant showcasing it.  Each dish also had symbols indicating the whether it was small, medium, or large, as well as whether vegetarian or spicy.  Each dish was sharable, and could be either appetizer or main course.  There were several separate dessert entries. We decided on the following: Apocalypse Burger (San Francisco), Cebiche del Amor (Spain), Summery Warm Tomato & Bail Tart (France), Wasabi Lobster (Berlin), and Jokbal Ssam (South Korea).  For beverage, wife had Schramberg blanc de noirs, brut ($19/glass) and I had Pisco Sour ($14) and a Fort Point red ale ($9/glass).  We shared most of the above, though I had most of the burger and wife had most of the Cebische, and we had half each of the lobster and the Jokbal Ssam- a Korean lettuce wrap of pork, vegetables, rice, and sauce that you wrap yourself putting each ingredient to your taste.  The results: in a word, OUTSTANDINGLY DELICIOUS and CREATIVE!  Each dish was presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner worthy of the museum. The tart was thin, small (about 5 \" in diameter), and delicious. The burger, the size of a large dumpling, was lettuce wrapped, and wonderfully juicy and bursting with taste.  The Cebiche, a larger dish, was very fresh, also bursting with flavor, and absolutely delicious.  So was the lobster- a rather small lobster tail, wonderfully flavored, succulent, and very satisfying.  The Korean lettuce of pork and vegetables was the largest dish, and was also very satisfying as we made our own versions with varying amounts of ingredients.  By this time, we were rather full, and wound up leaving most of the rice.  Contrary to the reviews that complain of small portion sizes and leaving the restaurant hungry, we were quite satiated by this time and skipped the dessert.   I had my usual black coffee, which was served in a glass cup.  Very flavorful.  The service was prompt, solicitous, friendly, and professional.  The wines were good but on the expensive side, the pisco was excellent, and red ale was satisfying.  In Situ automatically charges a 20% service charge (before the taxes, as it should be), which is convenient and fair.  The overall total bill came to approximately $210, which is certainly reasonable considering the quality of the restaurant.  In sum, In Situ and the food it serves are works of art, well deserving a place in the SF Museum of Modern Art.  Any discerning foodie should try this restaurant. We will definitely come back, especially when we visit SFMOMA.  My wife (who had a lot of apprehension before experiencing it) and I agree: We are glad In Situ is in situ!", "author": "Hoyle L."}

But it's super convenient and where else are you able to try this much diversity in one meal? It's a meal that provokes conversation and deep discussion of the dishes.\n\nMenu: Pretty limited. I won't explain the concept because it's pretty obvious by now. Just don't expect a long list and maybe call first to make sure there's stuff you like. (Pro tip: ask for the lounge menu at dinner. There are additional food items on that list you might want to order and they'll gladly serve them in the dining room.)\n\nCockail: I ordered one on the waiter's suggestion. \"Widow's kiss\". Very tasty.\nWine: Short list, lots of obscure wines. The glass we got was tasty and unusual.\nFood: Best dish of the night was the vegetarian one (\"The Forest\"). Superb in all respects. One of the best veggie entrees I've had and I'm still dreaming about those mushrooms.\nOther standouts: Fried tapioca/cheese things from Brazil, Octopus from Peru, Carrot Soup from Modernist Cuisine.\nThe Duck from French Laundry was fine, but nothing original. It's not why you came to a place like this. \nDesserts: The \"Cheesecake\" was amazing. Arrived dressed up as a tiny wheel of soft cheese. You just need to try it. Very rich so share with a few people. Oops-I-dropped-the-lemon-tart was also excellent. Very interesting flavors and textures. Well worth tasting.\n\n\nPrice: Overall, very expensive for a dinner in a casual dining room and for the amount of food you get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "Possibly my fave new restaurant in SF this year. We were floored by the amazing food we got in the dining room. You could tell why these dishes are wildly acclaimed. I recommend the Amass carrot dish, the Mirazur forest, and the Momofuku rice cakes. The carrots had a wonderful buttery delicious flavor- it was almost like a dessert, but just savory enough to be a perfect appetizer.  The forest stunned me with the meticulous execution, and the phenomenal flavor to boot. The rice cakes are crunchy on the outside and truly delicious- heads up, it's very Szechuan spicy, so perhaps plan to share. We also had the Noma yogurt (like a sweet kale smoothie), the Osteria Francescana lemon tart (wonderfully done, very lemony, just like what you see in Netflix's Chef's Table), and the WD-50 grits (perhaps the one disappointing part, particularly relative to other dishes. Very good and I'm sure true to the original flavor, but not as flavor-unique like the other dishes- a good safe bet for an unadventurous eater).\n\nThe service was efficient, helpful, and kind. The decor was modern, refined, and beautiful. I wish we had more room in our stomachs to try more! It's a great place to take picky people with diverse interests, because everyone will find something they'll like.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience that's a perfect fit for an international art museum- it's like an international flavor museum. I can't wait to go back.\n\nNote: To set expectations correctly, looking at In Situ as a casual \"museum cafe\" is sorta like expecting teriyaki chicken at Jiro's. Instead, it's more of an extra special dining experience, something to save up for, and anticipate for days ahead of time- more for birthdays or anniversaries than a quick sandwich or soup. (I imagine the lunchtime hours also throws off expectations because that's usually the cheaper meal- not so here).", "author": "Cyn K."}

The one dish that kept me from actually being angry with the experience of dining at In Situ was the Wasabi Lobster. Pricey - but innovative and delicious.

But something didn't work for me. It's as if it is a kitchen that thinks its a museum, or wants to be one too much. By being such a great \"museum of the culinary, it's become a stifled restaurant. That's not to say the food isn't good. It's very good. The wines are excellent. The staff is highly knowledgeable and professional. Service is high caliber. \n\nBut the vibe and mood feels like that moment in the museum when you find yourself sitting on a small bench before a white canvas attached to a large white wall and tasked with deciphering its meaning. It's laborious, it's forced, it's uncomfortable. \n\nIn many ways, so is In Situ. From the ultra minimalist silver wear to the austere furniture and cubic white environment to the staff members who carry themselves like they should be wearing lab coats, the entire experience is drained of the very humanism that makes dining out essential and good. \n\nI suppose this is a natural progression of a restaurant trend in this country that has probably gone on too long. That is, to make the restaurant about the kitchen's capability rather than the customer's experience.  We're going through an American period where we are obsessed with good craft, and thus with the crafts people behind that craft. It's a good thing. I for one like high quality, and we all benefit when talented people bring us the great things they create, but let's stop turning the whole system on its head and making the customer an audience member. \n\nIf you would like to go, my advice is to visit for lunch during museum hours and to make it part of the museum experience. see some art, then grab lunch, and then go back for more art. It will flow better that way. My wife and I made the mistake of going at 8:30 at night when the museum was closed and the concept just works less well then. \n\nFor the food: \n*Liberty Duck Breast: simple but delicious and perfectly cooked. Small serving. \n*Octopus Coral: Pretty good. Had a hard time cutting it with the small silver wear and it kept sliding off the dish when I tried. \n*The Forest: excellent. Probably the best of the three dishes we had. \n*Oops I dropped the lemon tart: if you like lemon tart, this is an interesting take on one, with like an ice cream sherbet in the middle.", "author": "Alex H."}

I ate lunch here with several others who are not vegan and their dishes looked incredible. The concept is great--but only for non-vegans.\n\nAs of December 2016, there was not a single vegan item on the menu. Given the dishes are representations of existing dishes from other restaurants, there are understandably no modifications accepted. They did have an off-menu vegan menu with three items and a dessert, which I was impressed with at the time. However, the food on the vegan menu was completely uninspired. I ate an Asian style carrot salad and a mushroom-pine soup. Both were incredibly pedestrian; I felt completely insulted at the effort put into conceiving and executing these dishes. The carrot salad was not something I would expect from the restaurant of a Michelin star chef; it was like something I would eat out of a paper carton from a Seamless order, at best. The mushroom-pine soup was basically a broth; it was one-dimensional and flavorless. I've had broths that are rich, complex, and nuanced--this was not that. I felt like I had a plate of carrots and a bowl of mushroom water. \n\nAs a vegan, In Situ provides an uninspired and effortless menu. I left feeling hungry and unsatisfied AND I overpaid. It was made worse considering how elegant, thoughtful, and satisfying the other dishes were for the other diners. I felt insulted being given food that was an obvious afterthought. Just because I am vegan does not mean I do not have discerning taste. I've dined at many of San Francisco's top restaurants and have had excellent experiences eating vegan. It's a shame that In Situ did not put forth its best effort for an entire audience, especially considering the number of vegans in the Bay Area.

Wine program is slightly less interesting, although still good - the riesling stood up to the spice of our dishes, and a gruner recommended by the som was really lovely with our desserts.\n\nAlthough I've never tasted the original dishes in their original settings, I thought everything tasted great, individually.  Although In Situ is much like a fancy tasting menu kind of place, since you're going a la carte with no obvious theme available, the overall dining experience is much more random and jarring from dish to dish.  No quibbling with that, but it is a different expectation when having a meal here.  Execution of each dish was superb (we left no crumbs or sauce on those plates) - my only tiny criticism would be the larb.  Having had real-deal larb in Thailand, the larb was as great as it should have been, with the fish sauce overpowering the sweet/sour/salty/spicy balance that Thai cuisine prides itself on.\n\nAll in all, In Situ is a great meal - perhaps the epitomization of Silicon Valley's \"bring it to me where I am now\" egotism - and a perfect complement to a stimulating day at the museum.  Look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes in the kitchen's rotating repertoire.", "author": "Audrey L."}

You get an idiotic menu claiming that each item is designed by an artist. The food choices make up 5% of the menu with 90% being insanely overpriced wines and beers. I ordered fried chicken. I got a basket of pine needles and four micro mcnugget size chicken balls.  Price $30 out of my pocket. This was an embarrassment for SF MOMA and was the cause for me to NOT join as a member today.  They add a 20% service charge regardless of the indifferent service.  I received no service except a ' here is your chicken' by A.G.   I cannot overstate how bad this restaurant is compared to other gallery restaurants in the world. It is a museum trying to be hip and meaningless with insanely small offerings at insanely high prices. Don't waste your money or your time.  Shame on SF MOMA for this.

I guess this is why the chefs of these original dishes were masters, and their masterwork can't just be easily copied. \n\nWith that said, I definitely think Cory Lee is a genius chef and master in his own right, as evidenced by the delicious and refined food at Benu.

From reading other reviews, I see I'm not alone here. I won't comment on the food because I didn't end up eating at In Situ. My friend made a reservation several weeks in advance, but when we arrived, we were told they couldn't seat us. The whole situation could have been avoided if someone on their staff just called us ahead of time to let us know about the conflict. Instead, no one reached out to us, so our whole party showed up at the restaurant to learn that they couldn't seat us. The most frustrating part was how unapologetic the manager was about this. It was their mistake, and you would expect at least an apology. He was a total snob and argued with us! Anyway, we left and won't be going back.", "author": "Kate M."}

We asked for a table for 3 adults and we had a one year old in the stroller that the hostess saw. After waiting for a few minutes (needless to say this was at 2:00 pm, so not a busy time and the restaurant was half full only) we were directed to sit in the dining area (vs. Lounge i guess). I over heard the hostess telling another customer about the soup, so I excitedly asked our waitress what was the soup that day, to which she responded: You can have soup in the lounge or go upstairs to our 5th floor cafe. We don't serve soup here. Then as we are looking at the yummy sounding menu trying to decide what to order ( we were starving), the manager tells us to give up the stroller. We couldn't because we had stuff in the stroller that we needed for the child. I offered to go sit in a corner table but manager was not happy about it. We got up and left. All good riddance, because we walked to a near by restaurant and had a lovely and friendly time. In Situ: You are awful.You are rude and customer service is lost on you.

I have been a SFMOMA member for about 15 years and have seen a variety of incarnations of the museum cafe come and go.  The most recent version (pre-remodel) was a little overpriced (natch!) but at least had a decent variety of offerings served cafeteria style, including some tasty soups and sandwiches that the average art lover could enjoy.  The lounge part of In Situ, by contrast, is a gallery snob's wet dream. For the price, the portions were laughably small. ie: Soup served in a shot glass? REALLY? A tomato and basil tart the size of my fist?  for $16? Really?!? After this meager \"snack\" which set my dining companion and I back $60, we were actually hungrier than when we arrived.

That said, I'm concerned that, like so many restaurants with highly conceptual food, the presentation dominated and flavors were disappointing.  But the $38 bowl of noodle soup, the most expensive item on the menu, didn't even have presentation going for it.  Yes, the asparagus \"noodles\" were elegant but at that price in that restaurant, I expect a rich and complex broth unlike anything I've experienced.  Instead, it was delicate to a fault.  My husband liked the duck although it was a little too sweet to my taste, and I didn't find the dense texture very appealing. The best items were the desserts, particularly the chocolate one.

The food itself was well prepared and presented, and if served in a different ambiance (e.g. some place like Bar Agricole, RN71, etc.), the overall review would have been 4-5 stars.   However, at In Situ we felt we were eating great food in an overly-lit museum cafeteria with cold, hard surfaces that amplified the noise.  This would have been fine if the prices were coherent with other museum restaurants but at $250 for dinner for two with $29 glasses of wine, it doesn't work.   It was worth eating there once and experiencing the food but we won't be back there again.  We'd rather spend our dining budget on restaurants that have more of a total experience. \n\nCould I suggest a few minor changes to the architectural design that would add at least a star:  dim the bright spot lights, add floor or wall lights, place some cushions or lumbar throw pillows on the hard 90-degree benches, put a large carpet on the concrete floor of the restaurant area to help absorb noise, add window treatments to the large plate-glass windows (see the St. Regis next door for inspiration) and add a vestibule around the front door so cold air doesn't draft around the restaurant each time it opens.  I would consider eliminating the school food-hall style lounge at the front completely since it was empty on a Saturday night and not working on any level.  It felt disconcerting to sit in the restaurant and see an empty lounge right in front of you, and a very conspicuous line of valets dressed in white in front of the large, bare windows with nothing to do.\n\nThe service was pleasant enough, but the timing needs big improvement  We ordered cocktails but our first course came out less than five minutes after placing our order, well before the cocktails arrived.  On a Saturday night, you need to be able to relax with your cocktail and catch your breath, and clearly the first course was not cooked to order.  We then ordered wine by the glass, but the empty glasses sat there for at least ten minutes into the main course until we reminded them.  Although, the little wine carafes make a generous pour, I personally think there should be a few affordable glasses of red wine on the menu, maybe a starting point of $12-14 instead of the $20s.  I also think that if you impose a 20% service charge, it should be noted in all the individual prices, rather than tacked on at the end.  That was just tacky.  Finally, I noticed that other reviewers commented that they were hungry after they left, which I can understand because the portions are small, and I think making bread available at the beginning could address that somewhat.  Maybe some gorgeous Josey Baker bread with homemade butter?", "author": "Bill O."}

Restaurant space stark and cold but our initial waiter was fantastic. Food variable: chicken and guinea hen dishes outstanding; stone crab bland and disappointing. The octopus, which was described as \"very tender,\" simply was not, although the chili sauce with it was outstanding. When a friend came late and we asked if she could be seated with us as we finished, we were refused. When one of us offered to give our seat to her so she could eat, this was refused. I guess having 5 people seated at a very large table for 4 in this restaurant is not okay, but having the guy seated next to us speaking loudly on his cell phone throughout our meal was somehow acceptable. So we were then relegated to a \"communal table\" in the bar area and then all of our service completely fell apart. We had to ask again for water, table settings, napkins, and to order dessert. Overall the food and service was uneven, stiff, and generally unwelcoming and inflexible - particularly the hostess. We eat at great restaurants all over the world but this restaurant - essentially a cafe in a museum - takes itself far too seriously.  We got a kick that after viewing the museum and walking by the restaurant again on exit, there were 2 guys seated at our initial table with baseball caps on and T-shirts. So what gives? If this restaurant loosened up a bit and had more fun with its food - it would be a far more enjoyable experience! We really wanted to like this place but we certainly didn't have the same experience as our friend Pete Wells when he did his NYT review in July.

The room is Ok, nothing special, minimal, but that's whats happening. \nWithout commenting on the concept of great dishes by great chefs which may appeal or not, the designer of the menu must have been on acid. It comes folded with a lapel button holding it together. I guess they want you to wear the button as advertising. I would rather wear an \"I voted\" or \"Beat cancer\" sticker. Then there are symbols for small (understatement) medium and L for large dishes and an S for ones that can be shared. I saw nothing that could conceivably be shared. \nThe service was fine except our server had nails with terribly chipped and peeling nail polish. Yuck!

My husband and I were shocked to see it named top restaurant by the Chronicle.  We ate there with his sister after visiting the museum.  We knew we'd be spending a little extra at a museum caf\u00e9/restaurant.  Fine.  But we looked over the menu (with supposedly fabulous dishes from big name chefs around the world-as if restaurants don't inspire each others' dishes on a regular basis) and didn't see much that appealed.  A chicken leg for $34.  My sister in law ordered the hamburger, but was warned by the waiter that it was tiny (I guess he'd had complaints).  So we all ended up with the lettuce and goat cheese sandwich.  Was it tasty?  Yes.  The goat cheese was delicious, and all five leaves of the baby romaine were crispy fresh.  That was it.  Five or six leaves of lettuce sandwiched with goat cheese.  Presented on a large plate to convince us we were eating art.  $14.  The restaurant is urban chic, which to me is just ugly and unwelcoming.  The food is pretentious and overpriced.  We were very hungry and it would have cost a fortune to actually have a reasonable sized meal.  We all thought the whole thing was asinine.  My advice would be to take a ten minute walk over to Belden Alley in the financial district where you half a dozen good restaurants to choose from.
