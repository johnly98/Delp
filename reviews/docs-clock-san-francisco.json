They have a long bar area and some small tables good for 2-4 people in the back. They do play music but it's not so loud that you can't hear yourself when trying to have a conversation.\n\nSo why my 3 star review? There are no servers working and only had one bartender working the bar even on a Friday night, so that means 1) you have to get your drink at the bar, which is fine, but also 2) the service is incredibly *incredibly* slow... \n\nWe grabbed a table when we first arrived and two of us stayed there to hold it while one friend went off to the bar area with our drink requests. Since there was only one bartender working, it was really hard for my friend to get her attention, only to be told that he needed to show the IDs for everyone drinking. He went back with our IDs and *cue another round of waiting* had to wait a while before she was free to take his order.\n\nI think the bartender must have felt bad about making my friend wait so long, since she ended up charging him only 20 bucks for our 3 drinks. I went with my go-to which was an amaretto sour, and those usually set me back at least 10 bucks at a bar, so there was definitely a heavy discount in there somewhere. \n\nWe ended up chilling here for a good 1.5-2 hours though, so it was a pretty chill way to pass a Friday night in the Mission. There's also a shuffleboard table in the back so different groups of people were taking turns playing on it which was fun to watch.

There was one named the \"[Something] Prohibition Highball,\" which I ordered. (First part of the name was illegible where I was sitting.)\n\nFemale bartender (must be the one others said is very unpleasant) laughed at me, acting confused and annoyed, and asked what I was talking about. I was baffled and explained I read it off their board. She goes, \"ha, a Prohibition is a beer... a highball is a highball\" and gesticulated dramatically, demanding I tell her which board I'd read it on.  Meanwhile she's making a big production out of scrutinizing my PA drivers license. I explain again, pointing at the board, and she finally turns and looks at it, the cocktail name staring her in the face. Without missing a beat she goes \"well that's completely wrong. You know what, why don't you try another bar.\"\n\nHer explanation was that my ID and my order were \"weird.\" I'm in my mid 20s and have never gotten denied at a bar, at home or abroad.

It was starting to get busy plus the bartender was announcing to people to have their cash out and ready, so I decided to make things easier on him by ordering off the mixed drink menu on the chalkboard hanging behind the bar. He immediately snapped at me \"I don't know what that is.\" Taken aback I told him it was on his board behind the bar. He turned his back to me and shrugged me off as if he didn't care and couldn't be bothered to mix a drink. I was so dumbfounded and felt so unwelcome that I walked out. He started yelling after me that it wasn't his fault because he's not been at work for a few days, but I didn't care. If this place is trying to be one with the kind of hardcore reputation where actual hospitality doesn't matter -- and that style of bar is a thing -- then they are a complete success.

She also snidely remarked about me not tipping her when my friends purchased my drinks and between them tipped her $8 for three drinks equally $9 (greedy much). \n\nThe peak of this ill-mannered thunderstorm that was passed off as service occurred when the bartender decided to go on break mid-service. She stepped out to get a cigarette and my friends decided to innocently pose behind the bar. One of the bartender's friend came and yelled at us asking what we were doing accusing us of stealing and ran off to find the bartender. When the bartender came back instead of asking us what happened, she starting going off on us accusing us of stealing and cursing and just being a level 10 bitch for no reason.

I ordered a beer and the bartender told me I should try a sample first, I told her I didn't need to (since I've had the beer before), but she put one in front of me anyway.  \"Oh she's making me\" I said to my friends and we laughed.  The bartender didn't think it was as funny and said \"Yeah, SHE is making you.\"  I got really nervous that I maybe called her a \"he\" and spent the next few minutes feeling awful for offending her.  Ordered another round and it was a beer that reminded me of the first time I hung out with the two friends I was with. Figured it was a chance to connect with her and told the anecdote when she brought the beer over.  \"Wow, that's great. You owe me four bucks.\"\n\nWhen she wasn't treating me like a dickhead, she was yelling at other paying customers for not being gentle enough with the jukebox or something. \n\nIt was just off putting and really strange.  I've been to divey places where the bartenders don't take any shit, but this woman seemed to be seeking out altercations the whole night.    \n\nOne of my friends spent the majority of his time buttering her up and was able to do it effectively by letting her know he recognized her from coming into his bar.

I was completely mortified last night when the bouncer did not allow one of our friends to come in reasoning that she was \"too brown\" in her ID picture. She was the last in our group of eight people to enter when the bouncer denied her entrance. Unfortunately everyone who entered before her was white and there was no problem with anyone else's ID. Honestly, not being let into the bar was whatever we just took our business somewhere else. However, the fact that the bouncers reasoning for denying her entrance was because of her race was absolutely unacceptable. If he thought the ID was fake he could have said something else, asked her a question about the ID, or called the cops and let them decide if it was a fake ID or not but instead he decided to deny her based on race. I didn't know people like that existed in San Francisco but after last night I was proven wrong. \nAfter the situation occurred I wanted to read other reviews of the bar to see what others had to say. The place has pretty good reviews however the bad reviews all dealt with different racial slurs and commentary made by the bouncer and some bartenders. I think reading that others have been denied entrance based on race, told to \"go back to Compton\", or that there have been multiple times that they have denied darker Asian women from coming in, makes the situation a million times worse. Because now it just proves that racism is an underlying theme of this bar and that the bouncer didn't just accidentally use the wrong terminology when denying her entrance.

Not because of the sign, that's clearly fantastic. Mostly because they were screening an independent movie that seemed to consist only of shots of a passing train, a man tearing apart a chicken with his hands, and various rodeo activities. This would not have been a problem if it was not accompanied by a score comprised of DEAFENING mooing.\n\nWhen I yelled over the mooing, \"What the FUCK is this bullshit?\" The guy to my left kindly informed me that the \"filmmaker\" was sitting on the other side of him. Luckily, she didn't hear because of her absurdly loud soundtrack choices.\n\nDoc's Clock improved dramatically after that screening ended. The bartender is appealingly grumpy, they serve up $2 pints of PBR which are ideal for a chugging relay race (that my team won, of course), and the next film featured women in lingerie involved in a lot of spanking and eventually, dildo-sucking. Which could still be construed as offensive to some, but I found it to be marginally more palatable, as I could hear what my friends were saying.\n\nI didn't even have to make any of that up. \n_________\n\n*Actually...yes.

There was a big group of us, probably 10 - 12 people, a mixture of english, irish  and american, with at least half of us all bartenders. It can be daunting when that many people want served at the one time, but we were organized and had the money and drink order already together. it was all shots and only two of us(one english, one irish) actually went to the bar to place the order, to make it easier. Pretty straight forward. \n\nBut the bartender had serious attitude. After he had mispoured a drink (and acted like it was our fault,. - don julio gold instead of blanco, which any good bartender knows, you always ask dark/white when you have both types of a brand) poured a drink we didnt ask for, and missed one completely, we paid our $50+ tab, left a $10 tip and did our shots. \nAs we turn around to leave, he leans over the bar and says \"Just so you know, in this country, its customary to tip the bartender\". \nSeriously??\nAt this point am too shocked by his rude behavior to say anything other than \"but i just left you $10\". His response - \"oh, that was you.... ok.  ....thanks\" \n\nThere was nobody else around us!!! who else do you think left it????? \n\nI dont know what this guys problem was, but next time i think we.ll just keep walking to the next bar instead.\nAnd now, that's at least 7 bars in the neighborhood that will not be recommending Doc's Clock to anybody.", "author": "J F."}

Seriously, PBR paraphernalia all up in the whole bar, your \"drink special\" chalk board outside says PBR... so where the hell is it? Lame.\n\nLast night came to the conclusion with a group of folks that at night, when the bar closes, ghost cats take over the place to party. Like a ghost cat after hours. They show up, get hammered, do lines of catnip, and then pee all over the back of the bar. There has to be some logical, scientific reason for why it smells like cat pee everywhere, and this is what we came up with. Sorry Doc's, but maybe you should put out some ghost cat litter boxes or something. Doc's used to just smell like feet, but it's somehow morphed to cat pee. Not sure if that's an upgrade. \n\nOn the positive side, rocked some serious Lord of the Rings pinball. I love pinball because no one really knows how the scoring works. Sometime special sounds or lights go off, a ramp opens, or the score board says something like \"Secret Cave Adventure Bonus x200!!!\". Everyone agrees, you just \"try and hit stuff\". So I have no clue what all the Lord of the Rings stuff is really, but I'm all drunk like \"Yeaaa, Gimli bonus woooo!\" or \"Oh man, did you see that 'Ent War' ramp bonus? So sweet.\" Had an entertaining conversation about what the full name is of the Elf chick played by Liv Tyler and we settled on Arwen Sexyface. Her face is like smack under the right paddle and she's staring straight up at you. Kinda creepy if you're drunk enough.\n\nBetween pinball, board games, table shuffleboard and PBR specials (when they aren't out of it), I do like Doc's. I ignore whatever the funky smell of the month is and always end up having a good time. Mellow crowd too, very social. Plus, it's the only bar I know of where I can yell things like \"Oh man, I whooped that Balrog's ass\" and not be looked at like I'm mental.", "author": "Justin N."}

One of the supportors, a woman that was well dressed and about 40 something, went out side.....4 steps outside the door to calm a dog that was tied up. Apparently she had a glass of wine in her hand and the bartender, Lisa I believe, started screaming at this poor woman about bringing her drink outside the bar. The woman looked shocked and brought the drink back in the bar and apologized. The woman behind the bar went of on her....calling her a F-ing asshole and a f-ing C word. People at the bar were mortified including the dog rescue group she was attending with. Then she would not drop it.....she threw the woman out of the bar. The woman was crying, she was with a group of shocked friends and the bartender is still going off on her. I felt so bad for her....the majority of us left at that point. I am thankful to Docs for supporting dog rescue groups but will never go back there again with that unstable person behind the bar. To bad, seems like a decent dive bar minus the staff.", "author": "Shawn K."}

Hot Drinks :) Like a Hot Toddy, which is basically hot tea with whiskey and lemon. Or a \"Snuggler\" which is basically hot cocoa and peppermint schnapps (very good festive on a cold SF night).

The place is fucking cool. The bartenders aren't pretentious, they have games including a shuffleboard that is rarely not used, and on some nights, they project B movies on the wall near the bathroom. Of course you can't hear anything when the bar is crowded, but whatever... it's not like it's the main reason why people come to this bar.\n\nThere's only a couple of problems I have with this place... the bathrooms could be way better, and if someone is using the Ms. Pac Man game as a table, you're probably not going to get to play... unless you have a nice group of people sitting at the table. Other than that, this place is great.\n\nIf I was hanging out in the Mission with friends and we wanted to go to a bar, I'm totally suggesting this place. Their prices for drinks are really cheap compared to most bars in the City that charge way too much, the atmosphere is great for groups, there's entertainment, they make Hot Toddies, and even when it gets busy, it's not all that bad.

Water is self serve, bathrooms are moderately clean though don't think you will do your disco drugs in there. There's consistently a squirrely traffic of hipsters brimming with PBR coming in and out.\n\nNow my girlfriend and I usually go to Doc's to drink the 5$ Chimayo tequila on hand and drunkenly grope each other in the leather padded booths in the back. If you're adventurerous you can get away with more. The jukebox will only play dirty music from a bygone-era, and the shuffleboard sometimes leaves some patrons in a frothy competitive frenzy.

(Or just think $2 a drink...If it's a simple squirt of soda, $1 is good, because it still takes the same amount of energy and time to squirt the soda button as it does to pour from tap....but don't stiff them just because you aren't drinking a beverage with alcohol! They are still working for you!) If you're too broke to tip your bartender, then you can't afford to go to a bar, and need to stay home and drink.

The Mission is always busy on Friday nights but I've never seen it quite like this! Crowds of people of all ages cruised up and down the sidewalks. Parents escorted their costumed kids from storefront to storefront trick r' treating, which a motley flow of folks dressed in work attire or their Halloween best zipped up the 24th Street BART station's escalators on their way home or ready to hit some Halloween festivities. The mood on the street was both spooky and joyous on this windy autumn night.\n\nThe bar de jour turned out to be Doc's Clock and I knew right away that it was a good find. I was greeted at Doc's Clock by two women dressed in black handing out candy to the continuous stream of kids. With knickknacks and tchotkies adorning the walls, Doc's had a distinct trailer park feel with an extra layer of Halloween d\u00e9cor. Settling into my seat I selected a Big Daddy as my beverage of choice.\n\nFor more check out http://www.missiononmission.com/2008/11/docs-clock-2575-mission-street.html", "author": "Gadiel M."}

Doc's Clock has that calm and friendly vibe to it which I like. It doesn't get overly packed and the crowd ranges from young adults to the middle aged. Every time I've gone, everyone is extremely friendly.. including the bartenders. They are always cheerful and attentive. Their sort of like specialty drink is the trailer park punch.. it's a must try. It's only $4 bucks and it's super delicious. \n\nThe first thing I remember noticing about this bar was the four foot tall unicorn head bottle of booze... with the sign referring to it as \"unicorn pee.\" Where can you see that at?? It's awesome. Not to mention the shuffle board and the old school video arcade games. This is definitely by far the best dive bar I've been to. \n\nLast thing, if you get the munchies for some bomb-ass mexican food, El Farolito is literally two blocks down. Booze + Burritos = A good time. :)", "author": "Rosa L."}

She was curious about me, having never seen me there before and wanted to chat with me about myself and what I was doing in town etc. even though she got busy. She seemed to make time for all the solo drinkers. But she was completely genuine with every single person. She also insisted I help her \"test\" some whiskey and bought me a shot.

The inside of the bar is long and skinny (reminds me of someone I know :-)) but a little bit kind of dingy. Not that it has to be all foo foo or anything, it's just a neighborhood bar. But the thing I really loved about it is they sponsor screenings of new films in the back part of the room. That's why I went in the first place, to see Kurt Weitzmann's new film \"Last Call.\" There was also another documentary being screened and although there were technical difficulties, the staff was \"on it.\" I really appreciate a place that will support local artists. I have to admit that I had nothing to drink at all because I was driving, but they did seem to have a full selection of the usual suspects.
