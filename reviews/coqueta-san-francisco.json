Great spot on Embarcadero by the bay, with a huge line outside when we arrived. Luckily we had reservations and got seated right away.\n\nWe tried four tapas, the octopus, prawns, egg-chorizo-potato-shrimp dish, and the razor clam special. All four were pretty dang good. The octopus was my favorite. It was grilled, and the slight char contrasted with the rich and luxurious octopus. The octopus itself was tender and tasted almost like lobster. My wife's favorite was the prawns, which came in a black acidic sauce and bread to soak up all the goodness.\n\nI also tried a SF inspired cocktail that had whiskey, vermouth, and a bit of coffee liqueur with a glass smoked in anise. The coffee liqueur left a bitter finish that I didn't enjoy, but I could tell all of the components were good.", "author": "Matt H."}

I usually opt for the outside tent seating more which is great for conversation, libations, and a cool casual tapas flair. Although during peak time the tent can get packed with hungry and thirsty ppl and they usually don't cut off a capacity early on, so highly recommend inside for more space and peace of mind. REGARDLESS service/food/drinks has always been consistent and great inside or out, no matter how busy. \n\nFood talk: overall I'd say some of the dishes may have been a tad bit salty but I feel like that is something given in this style of cuisine. All were still very tasty and memorable in every way. \n\n(1) Patatas Bravas - such an amazing super crispy exterior!!! While super warm and soft inside. The sauce was a unique mixture of flavors and spices. \n\n(2) Croquette de pollo - filled with a creamy tasty shredded chicken filling. Nice crunchy bite, and rich tasty center = addictive. \n\n(3) Octopus - perfectly charred and yet oh so tender! The flavor had a nice kick to it, although was a bit salty.\n\n(4) Sunny Side Up Huevos & Shrimp - one of their House specials highly recommended and DEF. lived up to its hype. Yes I can say, it was a tad bit salty...but still so unique and tasty in every flavorful way. Also there were amazing texture combos at each bite - would order again for sure!\n\nLibations: legit, WELL crafted cocktails at its best. Unique twist and so very tasty...there were some drinks I didn't actually favor - but it's def. more so a preference on the kind of liquor (and how potent you like it) the quality of cocktails was def. on another level here.\n\n(1) Salt Air Margarita - the salt air was actually a sea salt foam which was freakn amazing!!! Such a different and unique approach to the classic margarita. The drink itself was light and very refreshing, while the sea salt foam added a nice kick to it!\n\n(2) Infamous Gin & Tonic - strong as hell!! The strongest freakn gin & tonic I've ever had. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was def. very potent for that gin & tonic lover, but just a little too bold for me personally.", "author": "Saleen L."}

A wonderful choice for inviting a client you want to impress, or for a date to up the stakes, or for a gratuitous blowout meal for a random occasion. Reservations can still be had at the last minute surprisingly often, especially on weekends as it's somewhat FiDi-connected, especially if you're agnostic about seating options. Tables, bar, and patio are all fine choices, and this is one of the most consistently attractive restaurants I've experienced wherever you wind up, plus the water views alone justify a good share of the pricetag.\n\nI've heard positively filthy things about the pork shoulder, hosannahs talking about steak, only the softest, chewiest steak on earth, infused with bacon. And the octopus is a generous portion and as straightforward and wonderful a presentation as I've seen outside of Spain.\n\nFor some more guilt-free options I'll offer full-throated endorsement for the wild mushrooms.

Anyways, came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. Bar area is separated from the main dining room. My friend suggested we sit in the bar area and it was decorated really nicely. \n\nDrinks are strong and good! They're known for their gin and tonic and I loved the Galleon! So refreshing and barely tasted like alcohol. White sangria was a little too sweet to my liking. \n\nMy favorite was the salmon ahumado. They call it an open face sandwich but it kinda just looks like salmon bagel. But don't let that fool ya. It is to die for even though it's a tiny little thing. They add truffle honey and I have had nothing like it! \nThe sunny side up huevo was really interesting. Mix it all up and the potato crisps are like French fries. \nCroquetas de pollo were melt in your mouth yummy. \nThe only thing I could've passed on was the uni open faced sandwich. It tasted too fishy and didn't pair well together with the bread. \n\nAll in all, this was a nice place for Sunday brunch and it's right along the Embarcadero.

The bite size skewers of the Boquerones (white anchovie, campo real olives, pearl onion and piparra pepper) and Manchego (jamon serrano and apricot-sherry conserva) were a nice start.  I love manchego cheese and gobbled that up quickly.\n\nThe Mar y montana, \"sea and mountain\" (Iberico lardo gently mented over sea urchin with Lomo Iberico) was so amazing we had to order a second.  I crave anything with sea urchin in it.\n\nThe croquetas de pollo were gently crusted and paired well with the english pea filling.  As for the \"Bikini\" (brioche of roasted eggplant and apply jalea), I wished they would have mentioned on the menu it had goat cheese as my wife is allergic to goat cheese and I usually bypass ordering anything with goat cheese as well since I don't like the taste of it.  Goat cheese aside, the eggplant was delicious and I slathered honey all over the brioche to take away the goat cheese flavor.  The Gambas Negras was a nice concept of prawns with black garlic but I felt they overcooked the prawns a little bit but it has great promise if they can execute better next time.\n\nWe had to order the paella right away when we were seated since it took 30-40 minutes to prepare.  I don't know if it was because it was missing saffron or if I was getting full, but this turned out to be a disappointing dish.  I wasn't feeling the mixture of romano beans and pickled yellow beans in the paella. The clams were fresh and the bomba rice was cooked nicely but there was just something missing I couldn't pinpoint from being able to say WOW about the dish. \n\nWe ended the night with some bite size desserts.  The manchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn is a MUST ORDER and the Trio de Pintxos (salted caramel with pimenton, passion fruit gelatina & thyme sugar and chocolate fuet) was a nice way to end lunch on a sweet note.", "author": "Johnny N."}

As you are probably aware, they have a lot of small dishes to choose from and that was exactly the reason we came. However, word of caution - they are extremely small dishes. So, if you are used to getting 4-5 tapas dishes for two people at other tapas restaurants, that's not going to be enough here. We had about 6 dishes for the two of us, plus dessert, and quite frankly I probably could have had a few more easily.\n\nI won't give a dish by dish recap, as that would ruin the fun of you trying them all yourself, but I was not disappointed with any of them! They all had a great taste and a flavor that you would want to eat more of.  I would probably have a few more dishes next time and skip the dessert (Bizcocho de Arroz), as that was the only one that didn't truly stand out to me.\n\nOverall a great meal.", "author": "Marc K."}

The gaucho, although it is pricey, is so worth it, and massive!! It's a really good dish if there's 4+ of you and you want to try multiple items on the menu, but it's also good for two people if y'all are very hungry.\n\nWe started with the croquettes, four different skewers (chorizo, Manchego, anchovy, and quail egg), and the octopus appetizer. Although they are small, the skewers are packed with flavor, my favorite were the chorizo and quail egg! The croquettes were also fantastic and loaded with delicious gooey cheese. And the octopus was also very good!\n\nThis place is perfect for a date night, but definitely make a reservation in advance, as it was busy up until they closed!

There is indoor seating, outdoor seating, and sort of a \"greenhouse-looking\" sort of seating area - which is in a smaller space but protected by glass.  We were sat inside the main area, which was absolutely beautiful.  We were all enamored by the very rustic/Spanish decor.\n\nI highly recommend trying out the cocktails - we were literally impressed by every cocktail we tried.  My favorites (and if you like pretty drinks, like I do): \"Barca Gintonic\", \"Spanish Holiday\", and \"The Sun Never Sets.\"  The Barca Gintonic and the Spanish Holiday are both very refreshing and decorated with beautiful flowers.  The Sun Never Sets is like a beautiful dessert with a toasted top - like a merengue!  \n\nWe shared the \"Plat Cap\" to start, which is the Chef's selection of cured meats & we added all 3 cheeses.  This was amazing, and I would definitely recommend.\n\nThe \"Salmon Ahumado,\" which means smoked salmon - was great.  This was perfect because the dish offered 4 pieces, and each piece of bread had a great portion of lox on it.  Really delicious.\n\nNow the \"Pulpo a La Parilla\" - holy smokes.  We had two people in our group who were not huge octopus fans, and were hesitant to try it...but I'm telling you - GET IT.  It's cooked so perfectly, that it's the perfect texture (not rubbery), and it has a deliciously charred flavor to it.  We all ended up fighting over this dish. \n\nIf we thought nothing could top that, we then tried the \"Pluma,\" which is acorn fed, Spanish Iberico de Bellota pork shoulder loin - and GOOD LAWD IN HEAVEN - this was PHENOMENAL.  I can't even begin to describe to you how perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, and flavorful this dish was.  It has a delicious honey flavor to it, and I'm telling you - GET THIS.\n\nLastly, we did share a bunch of desserts.  We tried the \"Tres Chocolates,\" \"Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche,\" \"Carajillo,\" and the \"Manchego Cheesecake.\"  Honestly, they were all delicious.  My personal favorite was the cheesecake. \n\nThe service is PHENOMENAL.  Honestly, we went in there and basically told the server we would like to try his recommendations of the best dishes - and he did not disappoint.  He was very knowledgeable and informed and was very helpful.   \n\nOverall - I'd say DEFINITELY COME HERE.  The venue is gorgeous.  The service is unmatched.  The food is delicious.

Well done!\n\nOf course, I ordered the octopus I'm a sucker for some good tentacles. I enjoyed the dish and all of the flavor components that went with it. I've had better, but this was definitely a tender piece of octopus. \n\nOverall: I highly recommend this place, the view of the mountains and the bay is fantastic, plus service was great. The setting at the restaurant had a very comfortable feeling and the food came out promptly. Everything I ordered did not disappoint and I highly suggest dining here if you're in San Francisco.", "author": "Brian B."}

Starting with the negatives, Coqueta is not a place you'd leave full and heartily satisfied.  You get small tapas sized portions for large entree prices.  You may find yourself at Burger King after spending $100 for a few small plates.\n\nBut the food, aww gawd, it's good.  We tried a variety of dishes, all of which were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Pork Shoulder was amazing, even if you don't add a drizzle of the honey glaze.  (Again, you get a paltry 7 slices for $38).  It's the kind of good that will make your eyes close.  Octopus was also very tender, plus it had just the right amount of char.  \n\nI love it here.  Absolutely delicious food.

So far, I only came here to enjoy a cocktail or two.\n\nIf you come here for a proper meal, I'd recommend to make a reservation in advance. Otherwise, for some after hour snacks or an appetizer combined with Spanish inspired cocktails, you can walk in and most likely find a spot by the bar. The view to the Bay Bridge is simply stunning.\n\nMy favorite cocktails so far are the Bar\u00e7a Gin & Tonic ($14.50) which is served with Spanish Indi Tonic and incredibly beautiful flowers. Further, I'd also recommend the Sangria ($9 per glass/$36 per carafe) - it has a very distinct flavor you easily can fall in love with!", "author": "Stefani K."}

We came here after a rather long day of walking around the city. Our reservations were at 5 pm but we got here around 4:15 pm. They seated us in a tent/bar area while we waited.  I wanted something non-alcoholic and the J&T tonic did the trick for me.  \n\nOnce seated, the server walked us through the menu and suggested great options for a party of three who don't want any seafood.  This fantastic meal included Manchego and chorizo skewers (4/5), Jamon Iberrico (5/5), kale salad (4/5), pan con tomate (4/5), patatas bravas (5/5) and the gaucho (5/5).  It was enough food for all of us but we did not have room for desserts. \n\nThe restaurant is a bit loud but I really appreciate the tent lounge area before guests are seated.  Service was good.  This place is a bit pricey - it's about $90 per person including tax and tip. Highly recommended and I can't wait to come here with some of my seafood eating friends.", "author": "Andrew S."}

It's an intimate and fun place to hang out for a date or small group of friends looking for delicious food and yummy cocktails. Happy hour is a great way to try out their drinks, but it won't be enough to enjoy the seafood dishes here. That might be best on the weekend, when they have bigger shipments of fresh caught seafood. \n\nTo decide how to order, my recommendation per party of 2 is 5-6 tapas without entrees, or 3-4 tapas with one larger entree. \n\nFor the cocktails, everything is solid. I personally like the Barca Gintonic ($14.50). It's gorgeous with floating flowers, paired with London dry gin, special Indi tonic (this stuff is amazing), grapefruit, thyme and lots of beautiful flower blooms. It's a great palate openers and smooth.\n\nAs for tapa's I suggest a few of these: \nFor prosciutto lovers, you have to explore Jamon Iberico if you haven't already ($29). I swear it will change your life. Different texture, flavor profile of aging. Mar y Montana open faced toast made with iberico lardo gently melted over Santa Barbara Uni (sea urchin) is unique and fireworks in the mouth ($15 for 2 toasts). Patatas bravas ($10) are little morsels of crispy balls of heirloom potatoes that are lightly smoked and served with a lovely bravas and garlic aioli sauce. It's a great way to round out the meal with a few carbs to fill the stomach. I think Gambas Negras ($15) are a must here- olive oil poached gulf prawns grilled with black olive and chili sauce, perfected prepared for you to suck the head and eat straight off without peeling. The prawns are big, tender, sweet and absolutely perfect. Razor Clams ($15/20) are a MUST if they are available as a special. They are freshly caught, so sweet with the texture of raw sweet scallops with delicious drizzle of Meyer lemon rind, herbs and perfect evvo!\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong a delicious cocktails and plates of seafood here. Excellent breeze and view of the bay through the looking glass. I highly recommend coming here when you can during the warm summer season!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

It really comes to me as a surprise that I was walking out of this restaurant today with a half-full stomach and disappointment. \n\nMy husband and I planned ahead a week ago to make a reservation on Opentable. We got a reservation at 5:45 on a Friday. When we got there we were told they are overbooked because of Opentable (reminds me of United airline). They still managed to reserve the bar area for us. We were seated at the bar table that was at the center of the glass house. It was supposed to be a weekend treat and we ended up getting the most crowded area of the restaurant. Okay. So we said to ourselves we could tolerate this if the food is brilliant. \n\nWe've ordered 3 tapas and 1 entree. Patatas Bravas and the sunny-side up Huevo are great not phenomenal. It goes really well with cocktail but we are not drinkers. For the entree we had Pluma and the meat is juicy and tender. The sweat sauce that came with me makes it even tastier. Yet, we never had our 3 tapas came. We ordered the octopus tapas and the chorizo in skewer but they never came. In fact, they messed up our order and gave us the sliced chorizo. It also took a long time for the food to arrive. We talked about getting dessert like churros but we ended up leaving feeling half-full because we waited for too long. \n\nIf it wasn't we were seated at the bar area, they might have taken our order correctly.

We were seated immediately, and had friendly service throughout the night that was both casual/laid-back but attentive and polished at the same time. If you leave to use the restroom, you'll return to find your napkin folded in front of your chair. Nice little touches like that. \n\nWe made good use of the cocktail menu throughout the night - me digging the gin-and-tonics (each one is completely unique and all that I tried were great, especially the Galleon), him with the drinks that came with lime or rose-jalepeno \"air\" on top. Very ephemeral and light, but delicious! None of the drinks were especially strong, but you could get a solid buzz going if you're just stopping in for cocktails. We were mainly there to grub down. \n\nNot that this is a great place for that. If you're \"fasted-all-day\" hungry, you might want to pick another place unless you're looking to drop $300 on tapas. \n\nWould Order Again: The padron peppers, Albondigas, and mushroom dish. Each of these were uniquely prepared and brought in interesting elements, like little strips of pork with the peppers or the tiny wild mushrooms sauteed with garlic. The Churros are unanimously how every meal here should end - dipping them into the tiny cup of hot chocolate was a pretty fun craft after a few drinks.\n\nWould Pass: The broccoli dish and the pork shoulder, while both delicious, didn't bring a lot of value to the table considering their price tags. $40 for a light serving of pork shoulder for each person is a little steep, but I'd be willing to come back and try the paella. The dessert pintxos were adorable, but pretty underwhelming. \n\nIn all, I'd come back for cocktails and some light tapas, but would skip the larger dishes (short of trying the paella).

Cutting open the bizcocho to a flow of arroz con leche seemed almost perverse, but isn't that what dessert should be?

I have had the paella here two or three times and I don't think it is that great...and it is expensive.\n\nThe appetizers I would recommend are: \n\nPatatas Bravas- freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli.\n\nCroquetas De Pollo- chicharon crusted chicken and english pea croquetas with cured valencia orange\n\nAlbondigas A La Feria- grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots\n\nTrio De Salchichas- grilled sausages glazed with cider, fresh apple, and mojo verde \n\nAnd most importantly the \"El Gran Plat Cap\" chef's grand selection of cured meats and cheeses. served with membrillo, marcona almonds, extra virgin olive oil tortas, and pan de cristal con tomate.\n\nDefinitely order a lovely bottle of wine or one of their House specialty Cocktails to wash it all down with.\n\nI must tell you it is quite expensive ( funny how all tapas places are i.e, Bellota!) and all these small bites can add up fast.\n\nHowever for a fun and festive evening with superb service in a warm and inviting atmosphere check out Coqueta.", "author": "David G."}

We made reservations for a Saturday afternoon lunch. We knew going in that it would be pricey but the pricey to portion and taste ratio was disappointing. \n\nI ordered the Bar\u00e7a gintonic ($14.50) since it seemed to be what they were known for. Calvin wanted a Bloody Mary but with Mezcal (upcharge of $2 to $14). My drink was beautiful and the best part of the whole dining experience. I like how that give you a small bottle of tonic water to refill. The presentation of the drink was beautifully crafted. \n\nWe decided to order two of the Huevos de Cordoniz (quail egg with pickled mustard seed and jam\u00f3n serrano) ($2.25 an egg/skewer), Mar y Monta\u00f1a (ib\u00e9rico lardo melted over sea urchin with lomo ib\u00e9rico, $14), Gambas Negras (prawns with black garlic and chili sauce, $14), Alb\u00f3ndigas a la F\u00e9ria (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot, $14) and we ended with the Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche (warm molten arroz con leche cake with huckleberries and arroz con leche ice cream, $9). \n\nThe quail eggs came first and unfortunately fell short of tasting anything more than just a tiny egg yolk. \n\nThe ib\u00e9rico over sea urchin was nicely plated and the sea urchin was fresh but the thick toasted bread made it hard to take a bite and the bread overpowered the taste of the ingredients sitting on top of it. \n\nOut of all the food dishes, the prawns were my favorite. They were a little on the saltier side but came with three little toast slices that paired well with the prawns and the sauce. $14 though is a bit pricey for 3 prawns and 3 slices of toast. \n\nThe pork and duck meatballs were our greatest disappointment. We weren't sure if the meatballs were just extremely tender or really undercooked. For some reason, they just didn't taste right and looked mushy. \n\nThe con leche cake was beautiful to look at as the waiter cut it in half and the rice pudding just poured out but the cake tasted stale and a bit hard. \n\nCoqueta is a beautiful place to grab a drink and maybe one bite but I don't think I'd return for a meal. The 3 stars are only because of my drink and the wonderful service we were given. $95 for a so-so lunch but I'd come back for a drink.", "author": "Olivia C."}

Beautiful view of the water (sadly behind bar, not where seating/standing for happy hour is). \n\nTheir hours are weird and misleading online. 3/4 of the menu is only available at 5 which on a Friday is weird to me given the happy hour setting. \n\nI was excited for my olives and almond sides to pair with my BEAUTIFUL gin and tonic, but they were both certainly not worth the two dollar signs. In fact, all the olives had the same flavor profile, which I didn't like at all.. oddly nutty but not in a good way. The almonds were good for snacking but there wasn't much to them.. I was definitely expecting some seasoning or something.\n\nSalmon toast was good, interesting flavor combination with the truffle honey. We really didn't enjoy the deviled eggs.. the picketed potato base really throws the whole thing off in the wrong direction.. though it was pretty to look at. \n\nOctopus was ok.. chewy though. The potato bravas were my favorite tapas item we tried, absolutely delicious, moist and hearty. \n\nDrinks were delicious and strong which is always what you want when you're spending the money. The gin + tonic is decorated with flowers and fruit. Our waiter was a little all over the place but that is to be expected at hh. \n\nGood experience, fun vibes, food needs some cohesive love.", "author": "Tash B."}

The flavors were spot on. The toast was a little too hard and crunchy for me, the rest made up for it.\n\nChicharron Crusted Croquetas de Pollo-crispy little bundles of yum\n\n\"Bikini\" Brioche- not sure why they call it \"bikini\", but it's an eggplant and goat cheese brioche sandwich to die for. The temperature was so that it melded everything together perfectly.\n\nAlbondigas- pork and duck meatballs, my entire party loved them.\n\nPulpo a la Parilla-octopus grilled over wood. This is the dish that brought me to Coqueta.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "The best way to describe Coqueta along San Francisco's beautiful waterfront: Delectable and interesting Spanish tapas and pretty exorbitant prices. But you're in San Francisco should this is the new reality and with a stunning destination like the reclaimed Pier that Coqueta makes its home, you better believe you are paying for the ambiance in addition to the food they serve. I went to Coqueta only once before, when Chef Michael Chiarello first opening his newest jewel a few years ago and I remembered seeing him cook in the small open kitchen and then walk around and greet his diners. Those days are long gone, but what isn't gone is the large crowds that arrive night in and night out. \n\nThis time around, a friend asked where would I like to eat, and knowing it was a Saturday night, and I was taking BART across the bay, one of the easiest places to get a unique meal was back at Coqueta. With a 7:30pm reservation in hand, we made our way there, once again forgetting that their small entrance is right where the glass of their interior bar meets the cement blocks of where their main dining room and open kitchen resides. With our 7:30pm reservation, the best we could do is get two seats at the bar and I really liked sitting there as opposed to a small two top table because we could see all the cooking going on and you could see some of their handmade Pintxos, otherwise known as bite-size skewers, up close ready to be cooked over a flame. And judging by the size of those small little skewers we already knew we did not want to order those!\n\nBut first we knew we were deciding on cocktails as the bar makes some of the most unique drinks along the bay, with mojitos and margaritas in check filled with lots of visually tantalizing things like edible wildflowers you couldn't go wrong. My dining companion wanted something summery and was thrilled with the price of their Sangria made with red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile and local apples at 9 dollars a glass you couldn't beat this house recipe. I was looking for something more exotic, so I decided to go with the Beso de Carca made with Pueblo Viejo Blanco, lime, raspberry-jalapeno sugar Rose \"Air\" it was a smooth and spicy cocktail that went down just right at an affordable 12 dollars a glass.\n\nFor our dinner, they have a lot of choices on the menu at Coqueta that perfectly encompass what it's like to dine in Spain, from sliced cured meats to Iberian cheeses to Pintxos otherwise known as bite-size skewers they seem to be a fully realized concept that takes you to Spain and back. From their Hot Tapas menu we decided to go with the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts and topped with chili de arbol and chorizo dressing and the Albondigas a la Feria which were duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots. Both dishes were prepared with such detail, the sunny side up huevo was a rich breakfast dish made especially for dinner and the meatballs were tart yet tasty. For our entree, my dining mate and I decided to split the Lubina a la Brasa which is a wood grilled and semi-boneless Branzino with Manzanilla olive and preserved meyer lemon salsa paired with the Ensalada de Kale which had Lacinto Kale, cana de Cabra, pistachio, tangerine confitura, pickled green strawberries with warm fresh fava and English pea dressing. The branzino was seasoned so well and cooked to perfection and the saltiness of the fish went well with the tartness of the lemon salsa and it paired perfectly with the kale salad. In fact, it was one of the best salads I have ever tasted, yes it was that good.\n\nCoqueta lives up the billing as a unique places for authentic tapas on San Francisco's Embarcadero. For a Saturday night in the freezing cold of winter, the place was packed. We loved sitting on the counter, although we didn't get a great view of the open kitchen, as we literally looked at raw skewers in a glass case, they still had a great energy with all those people inside. It was a little hard to move around but a fun experience nonetheless. I would consider returning for a special occasion as the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get on your dish. But the menu is well-conceived and prepared with a lot of flavor and for that I think Coqueta is the jewel along San Francisco Bay.", "author": "Jason F."}

These same two friends decided to take us and enlighten us to the magnificence of Coqueta during their most recent trip to the Bay.\n\nWe made a reservation for a party of 4. We were a bit early, so we just grabbed a couple of drinks -- all of the mojitos are excellent -- and relaxed in the bar area. (There are also a couple of outdoor tables that appear to be first come, first served if you're willing to brave some of the strong ocean breezes.)\n\nWhen we were seated, we mulled over the menu and decided upon\n- El Gran Plat Cap - chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses\n- Huevos de Codorniz - quail egg \"diablo\", pickled mustard seed and jam\u00f3n serrano\n- Pulpo a la Parrilla - wood grilled Mediterranean octopus\n- \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo\n- Paella (which takes 30-40 minutes to prepare, so order as soon as you sit down if possible)\n- Churros \"fantasia\" - churros with hot drinking chocolate\n- Sangria\n- A bottle of white wine whose name is escaping my head at the moment\n\nEverything, seriously EVERYTHING, was on point. My favorites were the grilled octopus, paella, and the churros. Flavors are so perfectly balanced in everything, and the portions are perfect for sharing.

It's on the expensive side for tapas, which is the only caveat, in my opinion. (There are cheaper places in the Mission.) But it's a classy on the San Francisco Embarcadero, so what do you expect?\n\nIt's recommended to make a reservation as this restaurant can get VERY busy, especially on weekend nights. While waiting to be seated, feel free to grab a drink in the bar area and consult the friendly and knowledgeable bar staff if you're unsure of what to get (or if you'd like to switch out the gin to something in their drinks as the majority of their specialty cocktails use gin).\n\nMy biggest recommendations for the tapas dishes are the patatas bravas (fried potato dressed with garlic aioli on top and plated in a cute, circular fashion around a hearty tomato-like brava salsa), padron peppers (green shishito-like peppers covered served with tiny strips of jamon with a delectable vinegar and seasoning to give it a bright, lightly spicy flavor), and pulpo (grilled octopus served with fresh potato and covered with a delicious olive oil to complement the pulpo's flavor).\n\nOverall, highly recommend Coqueta if you're able to make a reservation and afford the high price.

There were just so many little things wrong with that meal that added up to a culmination of pure disappointment. It's that feeling you get when you go to an obviously tourist-trap, price-gouging restaurant in a foreign country.. except this time, it was in my own hometown, with the extra cost funding the rent for the tourist-hotbed location, or perhaps the chef's legal fees from some appalling sexual harassment claims.\n\nPintxos were okay. Drinks were average but expensive. Patatas bravas were great, and the pulpos (octopus) tender but tiny. The gambas negras (shrimp) was good, but it comes out to $5 a shrimp. The \"large format\", \"family style\" dishes that come in at $35-45 were single-person servings. Seriously. We didn't order the paella but saw it on the table adjacent to us and man, was it tiny. Many other Spanish restaurants in the area (Duende, for example) will serve 2-3x the portions at that price point. Our pork shoulder dish, as good as it was, was enough to feed one of us. We each got one small sliver, and no more.\n\nService was amiss, and a bit shady. Wine was spilled. A sauce bottle was accidentally thrown in the lap of one person at our table. Never once did they mention that they'll be charging us additional $$$$ by adding an extra $5 shrimp to our meal or any other additions to satisfy a 4-top. We didn't consent to any of the additional charges.

Location is great, the restaurant itself has a nice unique vibe... And they actually have pretty good food!\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because we had one of the worst experiences we've had at a restaurant in a really long time.  \n\nWe made a reservation well in advance during busy saturday dinner hours and we showed 15 min early... The hostess who was very friendly asked us to chill at the bar until our table was ready.... So we chilled at the bar, had a few drinks (which were amazing by the way) and just hung out... The bartenders were super friendly and helpful...\n\n15 minutes later, our hostess told us our table was ready so we get seated... After reviewing our menu for a few minutes, our waiter (W.A.) comes to take our order... We ordered a few tapas to start off and his response was:  \"THAT'S IT?  THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING?\"  I responded as nicely as I possibly could and said \"Uhhhh... this is just what we want... FOR NOW... Is that ok?\"  He seemed like he was having a really bad day and went away...\n\n20 minutes later, our first plate comes and it's the wrong order... We tell the person who delivers our food that we did not order that plate and 5 minutes later, our server comes to us asking why we did not eat the WRONG ORDER that was delivered to our table LOL!  \n\nI politely told W.A. that we did not order that plate and so that's why we sent it back...

My whole dining experience, I was literally blown away by how yummy most of the dishes were.\n\nHad finished going to the Exploratorium After Dark with the bf and we were in the mood for some quick bites and drink before heading back home. Then we stumbled upon Coquette! First impression: damn... this place looks small... we're probably not gonna get a walk-in table... but heck.. i had this place bookmarked for a while and their food looks BOMB AF on yelp. After walking in, the place is actually bigger than it appears and is divided into two areas. The room on the right is for reservations and the patio/bar seating on the left is for first come first serve (self-seat). At 7:45pm, the place was packed but after fishing around for ~5 mins, a party got up and we snagged their table !! woo hoo !\n\nThe seatings in the bar area is so weirdly cute. We were literally eating off a vertical tree log! The vibe was cozy and casual. Not necessarily warm so layer up!\n\nThe GRUBBS:\n\n- Jamon Iberia de Bellota ($29): The bf really like his meats so when he saw this imported cured meat appetizer, he was ecstatic. The app came out in this tiny cute wooden board with slices of thin cured meat imported from Spain. It also came with these cone looking crackers to wrap our meat around. The meat was so flavorful and delicious. Had me licking my fingers after each bite.\u00a0\n\n- Salmon Ahumado ($8): Came in 2 lox bagels topped with smoked salmon, quest fresco and truffle honey. This is by far my MOST FAVORITE dish of the night! Super tasty!!! Never had I thought to eat smoked salmon with truffle honey; the combination of smokey and sweetness was just crazy. I was sooo in love with this dish I had to get seconds!! MUST TRY!\n\n- Mar y Montana ($14): darnns.... This was the one dish that captured my attention the most.... cause of the sea urchin! but it wasn't as great as I'd hope it to be. Pretty bland and boring. The uni was a bit bitter. Definitely prefer the salmon ahumado more. won't order again.\u00a0\n\n- Pulpo a la Parilla ($14): wood grilled Mediterranean octopus with fingerling potatoes. YUMM. The octopus was so tender and slightly chewy! The herbs brought out the taste and paired with the fingerling potatoes was divine.\u00a0\n\n- Pluma ($38): Pork shoulder loin with honey-chilled glaze. OMG. fantastic flavors! Made medium rare, the meat was flavored unbelievably good. Could even do without the honey-chilled glaze! The meat was so juicy and charred with a hint of spice to it. This was the best finishing touch to our meal. left us super satisfied and craving our next return already.\u00a0\n\nDRINKS:\n\n- Barca Gintonic ($13): London dry gin with fever tree tonic grapefruit and thyme. wow. the presentation was so beautiful. Literally looked like a pretty flower garden in a cup. Citrusy, refreshing, and delicious!\n\n- Spanish Holiday ($13): Technically vodka, lemon, and soda. Nothing too special and kinda watered down and not strong.\u00a0\n\nOverall, a great dining experience. Loved the atmosphere and the food. Perfect date spot for couples or a girls night out for drinks and catching up. I advise making a reservation.\n\nIn total, our bill was ~$153 pre-tip. A bit pricy for the small portion but this is a tapas place. Everything was just the right amount for two from what we ordered. We left satisfied.", "author": "Anissa D."}

The food is good but not amazing, and really way too overpriced for what it is.  Two main issues were the price gouging and the poor service.  \n\nEverything was way too overpriced. Most things appear to be an average of $5 per bite.  Most restaurants that have large format items actually give you a large portion that is meant to be shared with multiple people.  However here the large format is probably meant for one person but with the price of a typical large format item.  Literally the large format pork is probably the size of my hand, laid flat (and I'm a petite Asian girl).  \n\nAlso there's the poor service, which doesn't seem terrible but it's barely passable.  The waiter 1) dropped a hot sauce bottle on our table 2) spilled our wine 3) forgot some of the items we ordered and we had to remind him 4) gave us the wrong check 5) We had a party of four and most of the dishes have 3 pieces, so there's an extra charge to have 4 items, but he didn't inform us (seeing this on the bill quite a surprise).\n\nMaybe their rent is ridiculous due to the location and it's designed for tourists.

Yes, the Coqueta offers a solid take on traditional tapas dishes. But - also - yes, the ever-so-slightly-spendy prices and the ever-so-slightly-tiny portions (even for tapas) reflect its unbeatable waterfront location.\n\nTo start, a selection of pintxos (bite-sized skewers) at $2.75 each (see pictures below) was an interesting way to taste several different things at once, but let's be honest, from a sizing perspective these would barely pass for acceptable hors d'oeuvres at a reception. Indeed, the sizing was so small that it was hard to taste anything to begin with before it all went down. \n\nMore savory dishes like croquetas, albongidas (meatballs), and open-faced salmon sandwiches were far more satisfying, whether from a taste, quality, or value perspective. But let's hope this doesn't give Croqueta an opportunity to raise what are fairly reasonable prices any further for these items.\n\nService at the bar was decent enough. The crowd appeared to skew more towards less-knowledgeable tourists and business folks with healthy expense accounts. Would the whole experience be as compelling if it were located somewhere sleepier? Hmmmmm... I'll have to get back to you on that one.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I was nervous that the albondigas would be served in a soup or have a lot of rice in them, but that was definitely not the case. I was excited about the patatas bravas and croquettes. They were good.

He made reservations for us to sit at the chef's table. The interior of this restaurant is beautifully rustic with very tall ceilings to create that open roominess to it. My boyfriend and I sat inside but I bet sitting outside on the piers is stunningly beautiful. \n\n* Bar\u00e7a Gin & Tonic *\nThis is perhaps the most beautiful gin and tonic I've ever seen of had in my life. It has a strong floral smell and the lightest, most refreshing taste. \n\n* Spanish Holiday *\nThis is a gin and tonic with very citrusy and lemony tones. Not as beautiful as the one mentioned above but I personally liked this one better in terms of taste (I love hints of lemon and cucumber). \n\n* Mar y Monta\u00f1a *\nThis appetizer includes two pieces of uni resting on toasted bread, topped with thinly sliced slivers, to the point there's spots of transparency, of melt-in-your-mouth pork. The flavor of the pork masks any taste that the uni has to offer but the texture of the uni makes it feel as though it were a buttery spread. Nothing too special about this dish for me, but if you love uni go for it!\n\n* Pulpo a la Parrilla *\nI've never had octopus taste and feel so much like meat before until I had this dish. The octopus is tender without losing its classic chewiness. You can actually taste the smokiness from when it is wood grilled; SO GOOD! It comes with the most tender and buttery fingerling potatoes that actually taste like legit potatoes; this is a nice contrast to the chewy and flavorful octopus. \n\n* Alb\u00f3ndigas a la Feria *\nThis dish comes with three ginormous, moist meatballs that are absolutely packed with flavor. Each meatball is topped with crispy shallots resting in a tangy sauce that is reminiscent of wine. This is the most delicious (and fancy) meatball I have ever had in my life. Not sure if I would get it again but it was definitely worth experiencing once. \n\n* Pluma *\nThis was my favorite dish of the night. I've never had pork that tasted so sweet and moist on its own. You can drizzle on a honey-chili sauce for even more flavor but it's definitely delicious on its own as well. The meat is unbelievably tender and it's almost like you can taste the acorn-diet of the pig as well; absolutely stunning. I can see myself ordering this dish every time with no regrets.\n\n* Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche *\nThis dessert was recommended by our waitress but unfortunately I don't really see the appeal. The cake is very dry and if it were not for the ice cream on top, I probably wouldn't have been able to eat the cake. I don't think the rice pudding in the center of the cake makes this dessert that special. However, the huckleberry sauce that the cake rests is pretty good.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

The toppings in the paella were filled with amazing flavor, very distinct from each other but worked well together.  Did the rice lack the rich flavor so the toppings could shine?  I don't know, but the star for me is always the rice--making that simple ingredient shine.  It almost did, but since it didn't it reminded me of other places in sf that might not be as fancy but had a better paella and better red sauce.

We sat near the door which we had to request the staff to try to keep closed. The door was open for the first 10 minutes we sat down and I'm not exaggerating, it was like sitting in a wind tunnel and getting your body fully blow dried at a car wash. I sincerely hope that coqueta can build a wind-blocking wall, awning, or anything to try to remedy this problem. We were not the only table discomforted by this issue and it put a big damper on our otherwise flawless meal. At the end of the dinner, 2 out of 6 of our diners felt as if they caught a cold. \n\nBut even with the wind issue, coqueta deserves its accolades and is still an excellent experience. The food and drinks will speak for themselves.", "author": "Charmaine L."}

Skeptical at first, since I am not a fan of Gin and never was, I took a chance and ordered a gin and tonic. Presentation of gin and tonic was appealing to my eyes; the cocktail comprised of a slice of lemon, a sprig of thyme, and botanicals. The cocktail itself was refreshing and I wondered why I disliked gin before? Definitely will be back and order another refreshing glass of gin and tonic at Coqueta. Cheers~", "author": "Minji K."}

I've been here twice now, and both times have been very consistent. My favorites here are definitely the lox and bagel and the octopus. A lot of restaurants tend to overcook octopus, but not here! It's extremely well flavored and cooked perfectly. Although, you only get one tentacle per serving...\n\nOther small bites here are also good such as the assortment of mini skewers, prawns, etc. I did want to try out the paella but didn't get a chance to, so perhaps next time. But like I said before, the bill will probably be well over $100 for 2 if you're planning to be full and have drinks as well. Speaking of drinks, the gin&tonics here are very good and the presentation is pretty spot on (for the IG fame).\n\nAs far as the bad goes, there's not really a bad thing about coqueta besides the aforementioned slightly overpriced menu and occasional long wait times. So remember to book ahead for bigger parties and prepare to order A LOT if you're planning to get full. Other than that, this is a solid establishment!", "author": "Marco M."}

Orange slices are a nice complement.\n\nGambas Negras: Perfectly charred prawns that you don't have to shell and the head just falls off. Soap up all that truffle sauz on the plate with some bread!\n\nPulpo a la Parilla: Everything about this dish is great. Most importantly, the octopus is extremely tender and everything else complements it well. \n\nSetas al Ajillo: A must order item. Delicious mushrooms cooked in a oil with ample amounts of garlic\n\nGaucho Bistec: Just a good old classic steak cooked just right.\n\nIf you're vegan (like my friend I went with), the menu is tough since half of the menu has pork in it.

The drinks were fantastic. She got the gin and tonic, and it was so pretty with a flower in it and some other plant type things haha. Tasted good too! I got the spicy margarita, which was excellent. Not too sweet and the pepper in it was pickled, which was gross at first and then perfect.\n\nWe tried the mushrooms, the duck and pork meatballs, the octopus, and the egg and shrimp potato thing.\n\nMy favorite was the mushrooms. They were cooked so perfectly with a smoky sear. I really loved the mix of different mushroom textures. I also liked the octopus, which was tender, but had a little less flavor. The potatoes in that dish seemed a little undercooked to me, but I like mushy potatoes, so that could just be me. The meatballs were good too, though I feel like they were less weird than the menu made them seem. The eggs and shrimp was my least favorite. It had potato strings and baby shrimp that were kind of flavorless.\n\nOverall a fun meal, and especially for this area, I was pleasantly surprised with it.

You can ask your waiter to bring the whole pintxos board, and you just pick whatever you want. If they leave the whole board on your table, don't feel tempted/obligated to finish all of them. The pintxos is not expensive at $2.75 per skewer but they could add up. \n\nTheir patatas bravas is the best one I've had in the city. It's lightly smoked and perfectly crispy. They are individual potatoes (small round yellow and purple) unlike the patatas bravas at other places.\n\nThe sunny side up eggs with chorizo, shrimp and fries shoe string potatoes are also great and fun to eat. Just mix them up all together and enjoy the salty crispy goodness! \n\nI've tried all of the large plates and they are all awesome.

And it would be better if it's warmed. \n\n - Paella [5/5]: highlight of the dinner! Plenty of seafood and the rice was just cooked perfectly. I had always found paella was too salty, but this one was not! \n\n We got too full to try some desserts. Probably gonna try their churro next time here!", "author": "Susan C."}

What's more, its a Michael Chiarello restaurant and usually celebrity chef fame tends to lead to overhyped food. That said, reviews were good and so...came in with some lofty expectations.\n\nBottom line  - the place is awesome. Every dish except for the acorn squash(not my choice) was brilliant. Here I mean, the items were cooked beautifully and had interesting and amazing flavors. Sometimes, you want to give a place more than 5 stars when it makes such a memorable impression on you. Few places do and not all are necessarily four and five dollar sign restaurants. In fact, the more expensive the place, the more it takes to beat expectations. This place did.", "author": "Ajit K."}

Since I'm a big fans of wood-grilled seafood and meat, my friend Anna recommended this restaurant to me. \n\nService: i called and made a dinner reservation in the morning on the same day, the hostess was apologetic and told me they only had availability at 5:30pm. Of course i wouldn't mind and was impressed with her nice attitude! \n\nI was blown away with their tapas, entrees and beverages!!\n\n1. Mar Y Montana ($14): toasted bread with parma ham and sea urchin. It was a good start but wasn't as great compared to the rest \n\n2. Pulpo a la Parilla ($14): this grilled octopus with potato was one of my favorites! Octopus was so so so tendered and juicy!! A must try! \n\n3. Pluma ($38): wood-grilled pork shoulder with honey-chilled glaze. Holy moly this was my another favorite! The meat was super juicy and flavored; never imagined pork shoulder could be that soft when i've had pork shoulder so many times in my life. I'd also recommend other yelpers can try it without the sauce - still amazing!! Literally to die for. This dish also reminds me of thai pork shoulder! \n\n4. Paella ($45): Spanish rice with assorted seafood, lemon aioli and thyme. We ordered this at beginning of dinner, since it'd take 40 minutes. A little of dry side, but fresh seafood especially prawns. I guess the pork shoulder was too impressive and we were pretty full when paella came; i'd still recommend yelpers to give it a try - generous portion with fresh seafood! \n\n5. Beverage - Barca Gin-tonic ($13): recommended by the waitress. Light, refreshing with a hint of grapefruit and pine! I loved how light it was, so it wouldn't outshine delicious tapas and wood grilled food! My friend ordered sangria and she loved it too! \n\nIt was a great dinner experience! I look forward to trying wood-grilled steak, toasted bagel with smoked salmon and truffle honey and beautiful skewers. I'll definitely come back with more friends!!", "author": "Lily M."}

Coqueta had been on the list a long time. I am a sucker for tapas because it lets me really delve into a menu. That and all the cheese. I LOVE cheese. My experience started with a brief wait at the hostess stand. I was fortunate enough to catch an early BART train, but it meant I was a 1/2 hour early for the reservation. I was expecting to cool my heels in a very crowded bar. Instead, they seated me right away. As soon as I was situated, my server brought me water and asked if I wanted a drink while I waited. I have looked over the menu on line and was delighted to see it was current. I ordered the Sutter Smash which had caught my eye. Knowing I was alone for the moment, my server kept checking in with me. One of the things she asked was if there were any food restriction or allergies. I told here I didn't have any but that my friend was vegetarian. She promised to mark up a menu for her that highlighted t dishes that were already vegetarian or could easily be made so. When she delivered my cocktail, my waitress asked if I wanted to order a meat dish before my dinner companion arrived. Normally, I would wait, but sometimes I feel guilty eating meat with my veggies friends. The server recommended the chicken croquettes, which would be quick and (of course) delicious. I did, and they were. They were three, two bite bits of cheesy, fried,  chicken deliciousness that were served with slices of orange and slivers of pepper. Yum! Shortly after polishing them off my dish was whisked away and my friend arrived. Just based on that part of my experience, I would say that the service is worth 5 stars. The excellent service continued though out the dinner. Water was poured, new dishes were brought out (great pacing) and empty dishes were whisked away to make room.  Everything we tried (please check out the photos) was delicious. My only real disappointment was the asparagus dish (not sure of the official name).  The Romesco sauce and Manchego that were part of the dish were delicious. The micro greens and the vegetable itself were just OK. The Bikini (brioche a la plancha with ca\u00f1a de cabra, roasted eggplant and Quince Jalea) and Pan con tomate were both particularly good, I think in part because the bread was so wonderful. The dessert was good, but not amazing. I think that and the asparagus are why I can't give 5 stars. If I could I would lean to 4.25 or 4.5. I really wish I had tried the Gambas Negras and Setas al ajillo (sherry laced mushrooms). Both of those are tapas staples for me, but it would have been way too much food. Maybe next time. I also want to try the paella. I typically either go straight for that or have tapas, not both.  I was happy with the cocktails, but for a more traditional experience, go for the wine or one of the wine cocktails. The couple next two us tried two and they both looked really refreshing.", "author": "Nicole M."}

He told my friend he promised he would make her a better drink than the one she originally wanted to try (he told her she \"didn't want that\"). When she didn't like the one he ordered for her all that much, she regretted not getting what she requested from the start (we let him know but he still charged us).

We asked to try 2 different red wines and she brought the tiniest drop for 3 of us to taste.

We stopped here on the rave reviews of wonderful tapas bites. \n\nThe reviews surely were not wrong! We had machego skewers, quail egg tasters, a LOT of tasty cocktails. I mean, everything was fantastic. The only reason why it wasn't 5 stars was the snobbery. So if you're reading this looking for excellent food, ignore the rest of this review; it's worth it! \n\nAlright, we're the average millennial couple. Well-off, but by no means in the typical SF way. We eat moderate portions and try to spend responsibly since we don't make millions. Well we made a late night reservation, came 15 min early, and as I was checking in, after noticing some empty seats, asked if there was a chance to be seated early. The waitress literally laughed in my face. \"People don't cancel reservations here! Don't think you'll be seated early!\" I will say, we didn't bring umbrellas, and it was pouring.. maybe our soaked jackets pointed to \"POOR\" status. \n\nOk. Just asking! We can wait 15 minutes. Choked back a laugh when another waiter came up a few seconds later and was like, \"some people cancelled; would you like to be seated a bit early at the bar?\" Ha! The look they exchanged was horrific. \n\nSo we're seated, ordered cocktails and about 7 tapas. Everything is fantastic, this new waiter was great! He asks if we want more drinks, we oblige. Fast forward to many tapas and 2 drinks later, he asks if we want another round or drinks (3rd), we decline. BAM. It was if a switch turned off. We couldn't flag him down for ANYTHING after that. No water refills, no more tapas orders. We still had 5 or more tapas to go through with no water. Had to get up to get the bill. Still paid over $150 for drinks and snacks.. I know people can drop thousands.. but being treated like the poor people was humiliating and put a sour note to the end of the night.

Located north of the Ferry Building along the Embarcadero, the restaurant has a bar and dining area in an outside covered patio.  The main dining room also has a bar counter in front of the open kitchen.  We were seated here and had a nice view of the kitchen staff preparing the various dishes.  \n\nOur server welcomed us and since this was our first visit, he gave a run-down on how the dishes were laid out in the menu.  He happily answered our menu questions and opined on some of his favorites.  We tried to get a varied selection and ended with:\n\nJamon Iberico de Bellota.  What more can I say about Iberico Jamon? Had this is Spain and ever time dining at Spanish restaurants here. It's simply the tastiest cured meat. \n\nCroquetas de Pollo - 3 skewers of Chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured seasonal citrus. You complement the croqueta with the citrus.  It looked simple, but it was delicious.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - 12 lightly smoked, crispy potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic aioli.   I love potatoes and this was an interesting creation.  They were lightly coated, fried and topped with a dap of aioli. I liked it without dipping it into the salsa. \n\nSalmon Ahumado - 2 smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey on bread. Generous amount of salmon on each bread.  Though this might not appear t to be a Spanish dish, it was never the less, quite tasty.   \n\nPluma - acorn fed Spanish Iberico de Bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze.  Wow! The Iberico was so moist and tasty.  I could have eaten a lot more of this. \n\nChurros \"Fantasia\" - 4 crispy Spanish doughnuts with drinking chocolate and mixed berry powder.  You dunk your square shaped churros into the chocolate, which was not think or overly sweet. You can dap some concentrated berry powder on it for a contrasting taste. \n\nThis was one of the best Spanish meals that I've had Stateside where the tapas reminded me of ones I had in Spain.

Their kitchen closes at 3PM for one hour, and then opens up again at 4PM for dinner. I sat at the bar, and I usually prefer sitting here since it's always a more fun experience watching your drinks being made. I tried out three tapas plates, and three different cocktails. I don't believe this place has anything on the menu that you'd regret ordering. And trust me, I don't tend to make the best choices when it comes to trying new food because I always order the most daring options, and sometimes, not every place gets it right.\n \nFor tapas, I got the Chicken Croquetas, Grilled Octopus, and potato chips. Of these three, my favorite was the octopus, it was very tender compared to the chewy pieces I've tried in the past. The only downside of tapas is that they're gone so quickly. The trick is to eat slowly, and enjoy them with a drink.\n \nLos c\u00f3cteles!\nFirst of all, I had the most charming bartender, Mickey, who helped me pick out the best cocktails for my tangy taste. Because it's a Spanish bar, they have a wide selection of gin, ranging in price and rarity, but gin isn't my cup of tea, so I passed. I tried three different drinks: Mojito \"Costa brava\", Sutter Smash, and their house Sangria. Each cocktail is unique, and I'm definitely not a spirits snob, but I can appreciate the science of it all. The mojito, has lime \"air\", which is really just lime foam. It might seem a little pompous for a drink, but it compliments it perfectly. The Sutter Smash was probably my favorite cocktail I've ever had, and it had bourbon in it, which isn't even my drink of choice. What made this drink so special, is that it's topped with ground cinnamon and mint leaves, which combined make the most pleasurable sensory experience when going in for a sip. The house sangria was the perfect dessert cocktail, since it was sweeter than the rest of the drinks. \n\nOverall, great first experience!

We put in our order for paella first since it takes 45 minutes to make, but so worth the wait! We started with a pitcher of Mexican Sangria, which was cinnamon-y but surprisingly it didn't bother me. Very light in flavor, which made it tasty. The glass cups it came in was super beautiful too. We had a bunch of tapas before our paella course:\n\n- house charcuterie plate: my colleagues loved the sheep and blue cheese but i enjoyed the nuts, manchego cheese and the crispy bread and meats! Perfect amount for five people to share.\n- Salmon Ahumado: the Salmon on this mini crispy bagel was surprisingly fresh and tasty! Full of flavor but not over smoked. The caviar was a nice touch to draw in all flavors along with the truffle!\n- Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs - this was put together so beautifully. Not my favorite dish, because it had a different taste to it that was soured with a pickled slice of potato underneath. But if you're a deviled egg lover - Try it!\n- Patatas Bravas: crispy potatoes on the outside and soft on the inside! As a potatoes lover, this dish was so yummy, especially with the tomato dip.\n- Pimientos de Padron: these are like shishito peppers where 1/8 are spicy. My favorite part has got to be the tiny thin slices of cured meat sprinkled all over the peppers, yum!\n- Gambas Negras: this shrimp dish with crispy bread was delicious. Slight unfreshness in the shrimp but the flavor they masked it with was really good. The black garlic chili sauce was super good to keep around after so you can dip your bread in it too.\n- Pulpo a la Parrilla: grilled octopus goodness! I ordered this each time i came. A fan of the soft octopus texture in every bite. \n- Paella: my favorite and a must-order dish! The crispy rice on the edges of the pan is my favorite with such a rich aroma and taste in every bite. Clams and shrimps - yum! 45 mins is so worth waiting for.\n-complimentary caramel cheesecake dessert with caramel popcorn on top: unique and cute!\n\nFood was great!

It was the best place to celebrate my milestone birthday, and could not have asked for better food, service, and ambiance. \n\nFirst off, always make reservations here! Thankfully, my girls did so a few weeks to a month in advance to secure a prime Saturday evening reservation. It was a perfect SF evening, and the views were spectacular since it was a clear and fogless night. The interior is sexy and inviting, but not pretentious. Our table had a view of the kitchen, and they were hustling. Hillary, our amazing server, was outstanding as she's friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and wish ever server could be like her! Fabulous drink menu, from mezcal to gins, and they are just so pretty! (see pics). They even surprised me with a take on my favorite Moscow Mule. Later on, we also ordered a pitcher of white sangria. Sweet, fruity liquid gold!\n\nOk, here's what we ordered:\nEl Plat Cap - chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses. Si si!\nPatatas bravas - spanish staple, and is excellent! Definite must order. \nCroquetas - another spanish staple, and a must order. Fried perfection.\nAlbondigas a la feria - duck and pork meatballs. Absolutely delish and flavorful.\nSunny side up huevo - ordered two of these because it was a favorite of everyone. The flavors and the textures of the egg, shrimp, crispy potato! OH MYLANTA!\nPaella - YES! Must order! Of course, it took about 30-40 minutes, but we had enough drinks and tapas to keep us busy. \n\nAnd for the finale, the gals surprised me again with a ginormous dessert platter. It's basically everything on their dessert menu served on this wooden board that's longer than our server Hillary's arm. The churros were my favorite.\n\nMany thanks to my galpals, Hillary and staff at Coqueta. It was a memorable birthday celebration, and cannot wait to return. \n\nPS There are only 2 bathrooms and are actually both unisex. \nPSS Pay attention to the small plates as they are all Spanish themed and made locally by an Oakland artist.", "author": "Gill C."}

In fact, all I will likely get when I come back is this dish. Perfect. Don't even bother with the honey.\n\n2) the bread - yes, I value bread. I know most people could care less about the bread at restaurants but I think the bread quality is important and here it is very good - nice and crunchy on the outsides with a softer interior\n\n3) Drinks - the gin drinks were great. I had the Tarif which was very refreshing and simultaneously delicious. I'm sure the other ones are equally great\n\nSo yeah - verdict is it was great. Here's the caveat: service was quite slow. I mean like 20 min to get an extra order of bread slow. 10+ min to get a drink replenished. Was not super impressed by that especially considering that we were in the middle of the room.

The Kale salad was delicious and had all the right textures by having a few of the leaves fried; the octopus was out of this world and very tender and the croquetas totally like my mom's, and that is a huge compliment coming from me!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-21", "description": "My husband and I went here last night for a laid back date night. Coqueta had been recommended to me by a coworker about a month ago after I had mentioned that I had never experienced true tapas. Her husband is from Spain and she is very well travelled so I trusted her recommendation for an authentic experience. Reservations for a reasonable dinner time for two people was about 3 weeks out, but boy was it worth the wait.\n\nFirst before you read a long winded review, let me cut to the chase. Get the plumas!!! Just get it, don't rethink it! Literally the BEST grilled pork I have had in my life. It was grilled perfection with melt in your mouth unctuous-ness that takes a delicate hand that only a truly adept grill master can achieve. Hats off to whoever made that piece of meaty perfection for us last night. It will be a meal we talk about for the rest of our lives, so thank you to whoever you are!\n\nOkay, so now that I have that out of the way, for the small plates, we started with the bread with iberico ham. Then we got chicken croquettes that were breaded in pork rinds. The next items we ate were grilled octopus on potatoes and manchego cheese with that delicious ham. All of the small plates beautifully composed and each bite was a nicely built flavor composition. \n\nFor dessert, my husband got the churros with hot chocolate and I got the cheesecake bites. While both were delicious, the churros were special. The outside was crispy and the interior was so soft it was creamy. Anyway, every plate went back to the kitchen clean with not even a speck of food, so you really do need to order quite a few plates to be full at the end. It was really fun to receive each plate to enjoy each one in its own time.\n\nThe wait staff was great and the timing of the plates coming to the table had a nice rhythm. All in all a great experience. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice night out. We will definitely be back.", "author": "Carla K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-13", "description": "If my friend (who dreams of tapas in her sleep) called this place one of the best tapas spots she's been to, we certainly made the right decision coming here.  \n\nWe came after making a reservation during lunch rush at 6:30 and were seated at the bar seats looking into the kitchen.  We usually don't mind these type of seats, especially since you can watch the chefs prepare the food and, if something looks particularly delicious, order that. \n Note that it can get really crowded in peak hours; even the hostess had a hard time getting back to the front after sitting us down.  Dark interior but lot of windows with a view of the water.\n\nService was good- maybe because we were sitting next to the kitchen, we got our food relatively quickly and waters refilled.  Pace was good so that they generally brought out dishes one at a time, with time to digest in between.  \n\nFood:\n*Pan con tomate with jamon serrano ($10)- bread was crispy enough to give texture but not so hard that you would break your teeth.  There was a lot of bread, though, vs the tomato and jamon but still all tasty together nevertheless\n*Patatas bravas ($8)- love how they used whole fingerling potatoes rather than cut up big ones into smaller pieces.  Just enough seasoning and the sauce was tasty- most places I've been will overseason their potatoes / put too many condiments on them\n*Setas al ajillo ($10)- we ordered this as a side; it's rather a lot of mushrooms for two people.  However, we both loved the garlic chips in the mushrooms (warning to those who somehow don't like garlic)\n*Croquetas de Pollo ($9)- this was one of our favorites of the night.  My friend lovingly described them as chicken pot pie in croquette form; rich, decadent, and lot of homey flavors in bite-sized form\n*BIKINI ($10)- hands down my favorite bite!  Great balance of sweetness (from the bread and quince jalea) with the salty roasted eggplant and not too heavy\n*Ablondigas a la Ferria ($14) - can never go wrong with a duck and pork meatball!  Actually I'vd tasted some really bland or dry meatballs but thank god this wasn't.  Super moist (but not falling apart) and the combo of duck and pork meat together gives you a super rich meatball.  This was probably the heaviest thing we had for dinner, so probs want to save this as one of the last tapas.\n\nAs a tapas lover, I was very satisfied with Coqueta and am looking for the next opportunity to come back!", "author": "Audrey H."}

Rib eye was cooked perfectly and had really good flavors, but at $84 it was not quite worth it IMO)\n-Pluma (tender pork with a touch of sweetness from the glaze)\n\nOverall, don't think I'd come back due to small portions and high prices for what you get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "Among the best meals I have ever had. Really. \n\nDetails to follow, but first, a couple of quick tips. First, know that it's best to make reservations weeks ahead. We went on a rainy weekday and it was packed. Second, know that if you can't get a table, everything on the menu is available at the bar or outside on the small patio in front. \n\nLet's start with the ambience. It's busy, fairly noisy but I had no trouble hearing my companions. Great vibe and we loved the decor, clean and warm. Notice the painting on the wall which used cracks and such to make animals and figures in the Spanish theme. \n\nService was great. Our server was available whenever we needed her and knew the menu items perfectly. \n\nNot an inexpensive place but for food this good, on the wharf, and this well known, it was very reasonable. We ordered a lot, stayed for a couple of hours, and left for about $75 each -- with 12 items plus drinks, dessert, coffee (for five people). Portions are quite decent -- you certainly do not need to sample as many as we did! You could have a very nice meal for $40 each. \n\nOK, the food. Ahhh, the food! Overall, every dish was at least good and most were excellent, with several standouts. Flavors were complex but never muddled, everything was prepared perfectly, and the balance of interesting flavors was flawless. Start with top-quality Spanish ingredients like iberian ham and overlay the smoky, hot touch from their open fire grill, sauce it right, and you get the idea. If you appreciate the design of a perfect bite, you will be delighted and surprised in dish after dish. \n\nHighlights:\n\nThe charcuterie plate is amazing. A $38 splurge but a fair value, with probably a dozen meats and cheeses, everything top quality. \n\nIberico lardo served atop sea urchin roe (uni). Wow. Had this again on my second visit and it was even better than I remembered. The uni melds with the hot, smoky fat from the lardo so it doesn't taste particularly like unit -- instead you get the creamy texture, the richness, the fresh umami, and an afterrush of briny sea. This is such a perfect bite.\n\nPatatas bravas are tiny potatoes (\"freshly dug,\" says the menu in a rare bit of ostentation), coated and fried to be crispy shelled and creamy inside, served in a ring with a wonderful salsa in the middle and topped with aioli. \n\nCurly mustard and chard with plumped raisins, pine nuts, and a caper-raisin puree. Bitter greens and sweet bits for balance. Rather oily but I liked it that way. \n\nShrimp served with crispy potato garlic chips and a sunny-side up egg: Mix it all up before serving.\n\nI was blown away with the seemingly-simple smoked salmon made spectacular with truffled honey! Truffles and honey did not seem like the perfect pairing that it was. Smart.\n\nAnother surprise was the chicharron-crusted chicken which was bursting with juiciness, meaty and bold. Served with lively citrus skewers.\n\nOh, and the albondigas (meatballs). I love ordering albondigas because it's fun to say, all the better when they're so rich and meaty. Duck and pork with crispy shallots and a rich sauce.\n\nSave room, because the desserts are terrific. \n\nFlan del rey with caramelized apple pur\u00e9e, sherry-poached little spheres of apple with blue cheese. Whoa. \n\nSpanish brandy ice cream with hot espresso pour on top.\n\nAnd this was amazing: Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche: Warm molten arroz con leche cake with huckleberries and arroz con leche ice cream. The huckleberries, reduced to a jam, were a standout to me, playing off the cream and the cake, richly fruity. \n\nEven the coffee was standout-rich. \n\nOh, and I almost forgot the cocktails. Love a cocktail that has a blend of ingredients so well-balanced that the flavors are distinct but it's hard to identify what's there. The one I loved the best was De Copas con Dali with white vermouth, campari, orange, lemon, cava rose. And on my second visit, there was another cocktail from bourbon finished with mint that was great; sorry I don't have better notes on this one. \n\nWell, if you read this far, thank you. Now go to Coqueta and be happy.", "author": "Moe R."}

It's perfectly chic, yet intimate, and the bar seating gives you a front row seat to what looks like Project Runway for cooking -- the backstage step-by-step of how all this gorgeous food gets beautifully prepped and plated. \n\nAfter a month of traveling in Spain, my palette was about 98% Spanish and craving croquetas, jam\u00f3n, manchego, and a nice, crisp gin tonic. Enter...Coqueta. Ok, you'd be hard pressed to find anything outside of Spain that exactly replicates the gastronomy there, but Coqueta gives it a fair shot. The croquetas, jam\u00f3n serrano, and chorizo were pretty spot-on, but most other fare here is more Spanish-inspired, rather than sticking purely to authentic replication. \n\nA little breakdown of the delectable goodies:\n\n+ The Sunny-side up Huevo -- shrimp, crispy potato, chorizo sauce (yes, that's right, CHORIZO SAUCE) - One of the best dishes here, that combines a whole lot of different flavors and textures in one. Apparently, the chef's son-in-law is from Barcelona, and this dish was inspired by the flavors of a dish he had while visiting BCN. \n\n+ Pulpo a la parilla - Octopus grilled to perfection, a must-try.\n\n+ Croquetas de pollo - Delicious, crispy breaded perfection on the outside, deliciously melt-in-your-mouth english peas and chicken on the inside.\n\n+ Pintxos - Huevos de Codorniz (Quail Egg), Manchego - These were actually my least favorite here. Pintxos in Spain are traditionally even larger than tapas, but these \"pintxos\" were just a piece of cheese on a toothpick, and a quail egg on a toothpick, more or less. Not quite creative, nor really what pintxos are meant to be, which are generally more creative combinations. The toothpick is usually used to hold together all the food;).\n\nOverall, this is a great place for a fancy night out for Spanish-inspired fare.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "I read an interesting opinion piece+poll on NPR entitled \"When Is It OK To Profit From Cooking Other Cultures' Food?\" It was an engaging and insightful discussion-- a discussion that would've been cut short had they accepted my write-in answer: \"When you're motherf***in Michael Chiarello! That's when!\"\n\n~3 years ago, the [charming] Italian Food Network personality opened this Spanish tapas restaurant on the Embarcadero waterfront. They serve many Spanish staples, including Spanish cured meats and cheeses, pintxos, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, croquetas, and paella. Trust a renowned chef like Michael Chiarello to wonderfully elevate Spanish flavors with his own delicious flare.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing here: PLUMA, which is a honey-chili glazed, acorn-fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin (aka the creme de la creme of Spanish piggies). It's so unbelievably tender and juicy that you would hardly even recognize that it's pork. It's so good that I probably only dine at Coqueta when I'm craving this dish. I'm even obsessed with the bottle of extra HONEY-CHILI GLAZE that it's served with. It is really so fantastic that if I could I would regularly pair it with the many, many steaks that I eat.\n\nThe pulpo a la parilla is also worth ordering, as it's executed just as perfectly as the wood-grilled octopus at Bottega (aka my favorite octopus) with the additional pleasure of that pimenton oil. Yum!\n\nPutting my fangirl enthusiasm aside, Coqueta is good but not good enough to be on my regular rotation of Spanish restaurants. For one, it's a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're not in a big group and want to sample everything (or on a date, for instance). Case in point: It's $38 for the plate of cured meats and cheeses. While the pan de cristal is perfecto, I find that it's only worth ordering \"El Gran Plat Cap\" if you're with a group or plan to only stick to cheese & charcuterie to pair with drinks.\n\nI more often come to Coqueta for cocktails than actual food to be honest. The Barca gintonic is arguably the best gin & tonic in the city. It's such a beautiful drink with vibrant flavors to match. I was also pleasantly surprised that you can order a porron of wine, which is SUCH a Spanish novelty. I have a porron from Spanish relatives just collecting dust at my house, but seeing it at Coqueta makes me want to bring back the joy of spilling wine everywhere.\n\nOther notes:\n-Open late\n-Front area is nice for hanging out but can get really competitive for space\n-Olives are from the Chiarello Vineyards, not Spain", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

It's a bit pricey and it's best to visit when you don't have to open your own wallet. I suggested *ahem, tricked* my date into taking me there. Even on a weeknight, I could only get a 9pm reservation. We arrived a few minutes early and grabbed some drinks at the bar. I am not a gin & tonic type of girl but the Barca G&T is just too pretty to pass up. If you don't like botanicals, then it's not for you but I love the light and refreshing flavors. It's perfect for summer (or spring, winter, and fall).\n\nWe were seated at a cozy two-top and went about ordering our dinner. We had:\n-Mar y Montana (open faced sandwich) - Iberico ham draped over creamy uni. The portion only came with two small bagel bite sized pieces but it was a party in my mouth.\n-Albondigas a la Feria - The meatballs are made with both duck and pork and I love the contrast between the soft texture of the meatballs and the crunchiness of the crispy fried shallots.\n-Pulpo a la Parrilla - I always find myself ordering the octopus dish at tapas places. This one was very solid. It wasn't as special as the other dishes though.\n-Pluma - The \"main\" dish was pork shoulder served with honey-chili glaze. We had to do a double take as it clearly looked and tasted like steak. It was juicy and cooked to medium perfection. We could not get over how amazing this was.\n\nLight dinner and one round of drinks was ~$140.", "author": "Yi Z."}

Upon arriving the place was jammed but we did get seating within 10 minutes of our arrival which was great.  The bar area was packed so we just waited to get a drink at our table.\n\nWe were promptly greeted for water and then our server arrived asking us for drinks. She was fantastic, friendly, and funny with a great sense of humor.  So, after looking at the menu, it was time to dig into the ordering.\n\nSeveral at the table decided to share a set of dishes and three others (including me) decided to order our own set to share.\n\nDISHES:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap which is the chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses served with homemade membrillo, Marcona almond, extra virgin olive oil torta, pan de crista and tomaquet.  The plate came with a generous amount of cheeses (3 types) and 3 different means including some salumi and sausage which was slightly spicy with great lingering flavor.  Put some of the goat cheese or blue cheese on a piece of that spicy sausage and your mouth would water in excitement. Good for 3-4 to share but only a few bites of each.  If you love this and have 5-6 people I would order two of these.\n\nCroquetas de Pollo which is Chicharron crusted chicken and English Pea Croquetas with cured citrus (tangelo).  This was a great dish with that crisp Chicarron outer crispy exterior which when eaten breaks into that soft and hot center with the chicken and English pea filling.  Came 6 to the order so this could be shared by at least 3-4 people.\n\nThe most unique dish of the evening was the \"Sunny Side-Up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts, Chile de Arbol, and chorizo dressing. This was WOW in your mouth.  Everything was mixed together (see my video) by the server and then turned over for consumption...very fast consumption I may add.  This is a do not miss dish!\n\nGambas Negras was the next dish which was ordered by the other group at the table. This was olive oil poached head on gulf prawns with black garlic and chile sauce. This was outstanding as I did taste this as well.  Very rich in flavor and not too heavy on the garlic but just enough to push the flavor through the entire shrimp.\n\nAlbondiga a la Feria was next up which were the duck and pork meatballs. DUCK? PORK? MEATBALL?  YEEESSSSSS!!!!!!  This was an interesting meat ball. Not very firm yet very flavorful. Pick this one up with your finger or slide your fork under each because sticking it will lead to them being broken.  A good dish but it wasn't my favorite, but worth a try for sure.\n\nFAVORITE DISH:\n\nPulpo a la Parrilla. This was wood grilled Mediterranean Octopus, with fresh fingerling potoatos and Pimenton Olive Oil.  I get octopus whenever I can especially when I can get a big fat tentacle with a little charring going on. This is exactly what we got.  You could cut this with a fork barely pressing down it was so tender.  The flavor here with the wood smoke impregnated throughout ever piece of the octopus was fantastic. This was definitely my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nTo finish for the evening, we decided to get an order of the Churro's with drinking Mexican Chocolate.  To the guy who sat next to me with his girlfriend (if he reads this), thanks again for sharing those Churro's.  He insisted we take the two they weren't going to eat and so we tried them.  After trying them we had to order a full order for the table. Dipping that Churro into the Mexican chocolate was heavenly but picking up the chocolate and drinking it to the finish was an awesome way to finish off with an espresso.  Talk about caffeine buzz!\n\nBecause of the incredible service, acknowledged the birthday gal, great sense of humor and keeping me laughing, I'm going with:\n\n5 stars", "author": "Jay G."}

I doubt the owners of this superficially Spanish restaurant have been to Spain, where even at the best restaurants one can pay a reasonable price for a great Rioja. This is is fabricated exclusivity attempting to disguise a cash grab. \n\nThe food is fine, again not worth the price. The waiters are pushy - after asking for a moment to look at the wine list they will come back every 2-3 minutes to ask what you want impatiently. The interior is nice but overdone, not in line with my experiences with modern Spanish dining. \n\nHowever, I now realize that I was the fool for coming to this place. It's on the pier! I should have known... They can understandably fool tourists, don't let them fool locals. Much better choices for Spanish cuisine in the city.", "author": "Lou S."}

Located on the Embarcadero, Coqueta is in a picturesque spot in SF and makes a great spot for dinner. Make reservations in advance as they do fill up fairly quickly. \n\nEven though we had reservations, we were seated at the bar. Not a problem for us, as we're easy going and enjoyed staring at all the food  (maybe that's why we ordered so much lol) \n\nWe started with two cocktails- I'm not sure what she had, but I had their house Gin & Tonic- which was outstanding! For dinner, we ordered a bottle of a Spanish Grenache wine that was amazing! \n\nFor food, we ordered:\n-Boquerones Pintxos (white anchovie, campo real olives, pearl onion and piparra pepper)\n-Manchego  Pintxos (jamon serrano and apricot-sherry conserva)\n-Tortilla de Espinacas (spinach tortilla with cana de cabra, raisin, and pinenut)\n-Pan con tomate montaditos (bread and tomatoe confirtura) \n-Salmon Ahumado (moked salmon, queso fresco, and truffle honey) SO GOOD!\n-Croquetas de Pollo (chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with seasonal citrus)\n-Gambas Negras (olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce)\n-Pulo al la Parilla (wood grilled Mediterranean octopus, fingerling potatoes, and pimento olive oil)\n\nFrom beginning to end, Coqueta exceeded my expectations.

I have never been to Coqueta before but I have seen how beautiful their drinks are here, so I took the opportunity to come here for lunch and we were so glad we came! \n\nThe first impression I had when I walked into this place was it gets rather stuffy on a warm day. The cheeses and cured meats didn't act as a air freshener either, so I was first quite surprised but later adjusted to the smell. We opted to set at the bar to admire their open kitchen. My friend and I settled on ordering a few tapas along with drinks for lunch. Our waitress was a delight and she recommended that for a party of two, it's best to order 4 - 5 tapas to be full for lunch. \n\nWe ordered their famous Gin & Tonics. I got their Barca Gintonic and my friend got their Galleon (both $13) to start. Their drinks are absolutely beautiful with floral pieces floating and the drinks were strong. I liked how our waitress only poured half of the tonic water into the gin to make it strong! The Barca Gintonic was citrusy, refreshing, and delicious. My friend also enjoyed her Galleon but did say it does not taste as strong as the Barca. \n\nFor our tapas, we ordered the following:\n- Croquetas de Pollo ($9) - crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty, packed with chicken flavor deliciousness on the inside. They paired very well with the refreshing gintonics. \n- Sunny side-up Huevo ($13) - a little bit too oily and salty for our taste but it was still good. Our waiter first served it prior to mixing then proceeded to mix it in front of us at the table.\n- Pulpo de Parilla ($14) - Yum! the octopus was super tender and soft. It was also very fresh since the octopus had a strong taste of the ocean. haha.\n- Albondigas a la Feria ($14) - the meatballs were super flavorful and tender. It was served with some caramelized onions for that salty and sweet flavor that was wonderful.\n- Salmon Alhumado ($8) - Absolutely DELICIOUS! Winner of the day!! Sad that it was $4 for each bite. The smoked salmon was at excellent quality and the truffle honey was mind blowing. The flavor contrast from the salty smoked salmon and the truffle honey paired super well together and the truffle enhanced all of the flavors and blended them together. It was like a flavor explosion in the mouth. Encore!!!\n\nWe were stuffed at the end of the meal and were happy to say the dishes were all very good! Our bill came to be $125 plus tax for two, which definitely is not your normal daily lunch! I highly recommend coming here and just try their gintonics and a few tapas, you will for sure not be disappointed! Definitely order their smoked salmon tapa!!", "author": "Hoyan L."}

The service was ridiculously slow.  I had to ask the hostess for everything because the waiter was just gone.  And he kept walking past us without acknowledging us.  It was late-lunch time, like 2pm.  It was not really busy.  There were empty tables and chairs.  \n\nWe ordered the shrimp, octopus, ham-and-uni-open-face-sandwich, potatoes, and paella.  We were not sure if we should order the paella because we were like, \"oh, this is going to be so much food.\"  But it's a good thing we got the paella because it was not much food at all and without the paella, we would have gone to McDonalds for cheeseburgers after.\n\nThe shrimp was tasty though there was not enough.  I liked how they removed the tail but not the head.  I like sucking down a few shrimp heads every once in a while.  I've been really craving shrimp and shellfish lately.  As in I want to eat it at least once a day.\n\nOctopus was amazing.  But small.  Just one skinny tentacle.  \n\nHam-and-uni open face \"sandwich\" - was a joke.  It was at the size of a canap\u00e9.  More than one bite but less than two mouthfuls.  The ham was not good.  I could have done without the ham.  The uni was tasty but I've been deprived of uni so of course I liked it.\n\nPotatoes - other than having an absurdly crispy outside, just fried potatoes and not very many.\n\nPaella - disgusting.  We ended up eating the toppings off the top (shrimp, sausage, beans) and not much of the rice.  The rice was not entirely cooked through and was slightly burnt around the edges.  No saffron anywhere.  There were not many seafood toppings either.  So disappointing.  \n\nAll in all, I didn't realize \"Coqueta\" was Spanish for \"not worth it at all, just throw your money into the sea.\"  Such a pithy language.", "author": "Christina C."}

While I'm giving a four star rating for the quality of the food, I can't honestly give the same score for the value. I understand that part of what I'm paying for is the location and the view.\n\nService was good so far as explaining the menu, checking back frequently, keeping our water full and answering questions. The one negative factor might be the pacing of the dishes. \n\nWe started with a pitcher of Sangria and the El Gran Plat Cap (Chef's Grand Selection of Cured Meats and Cheeses). We added on the imported Jamon Iberico de Bellota. Also on the wood platter was Pan con Tomate, which I was surprised to find we were charge for. Before we were 1/2 way finished with this appetizer, we were served the Broccolini with Romesco Sauce. We opted to finish our meats and cheeses before digging into the now cold Broccolini.\n\nThe other tapas came out in a way that made sense except for the Pulpo which didn't come out until I asked for it after the Paella was served. \n\nThe best dishes of the evening were the Patatas Bravas, Albondigas (Duck & Pork Meatballs) and Setas al Ajillo (Wild & Culitivated Mushrooms with Garlic, Chilli and Sherry. \n\nThe Paella was okay.

It was so tender and the herbs complimented it so well.\n\"Sunny side-up\" Huevo: Loved this esp the sunny side up egg, definitely a great dish you can't miss out! Love the crunchiness!\nPaella: I was pretty surprised how good this was. BEWARE it does take 30-45 minutes to cook. It was delicious and they have a lemon aioli sauce and pepper on the side, loved it!\nChurro 'Fantasia': So I thought this will be SUPER sweet, but it was just perfect. They have a side of chocolate for dipping and some berry powder. It was SO good and unique!\nBarca gin and tonics: MUST ORDER drinks! It was so pretty and the gin and tonic was very fruity, no taste of alcohol at all.\nQuail Eggs: Pretty good, they garnish the quail eggs with herbs, which made the taste even better.\n\nOverall, definitely a great tapas place! I love how unique the dishes are and how much work they put into presentation. I just wish the service was better. I would come again if I didn't have to sit at the bar with those uncomfy chairs!", "author": "Natalie L."}

The ambiance is . Lots of marble, wood tables, red curtains and low hanging chandeliers. \n\nFirst, I started with the famous Barca gin & tonic and the husband had sangria. We both really liked our drinks. The Barca was the prettiest drink I've ever had (and tasted amazing!) \n\nWe had a half sized portion of the meat and cheese plate which was the perfect amount for the two of us. Lots of variety. It included meats like Serrano ham and chorizo and cheeses like manchego, some kind of cow cheese, and a Spanish blue cheese. There was also pan con tomate, nuts and jellies. \n\nSince we had come just the two of us, we decided to get a ton of tapas instead of the family style mains. We got the patatas bravas (different from all others I've had before, as they were baby fingerling potatoes), octopus  (highly recommend), egg/chorizo/shrimp/string potato dish (twist on what seemed like a reminiscent brunch dish but fancier - and unfortunately slightly saltier), and the chicken croquettes (definitely a must try). We ended on the churros which was the best way to end the night. Very unique with chocolate and a berry powder to dip the churros in. \n\nNext time, we'll come back with a bigger group as I can't wait to try the bistec. This place is amazing nonetheless and now one of my favorite places in the city.", "author": "Sally C."}

However, we just couldn't resist when we were in San Francisco. We took the opportunity to dine at Top Chef Master Michael Chiarello's restaurant and for the most part walked out very pleased. I highly recommend making a reservation. We arrived earlier than our reservation time hoping we could sit earlier (our reservation was around 9pm) and we barely sat earlier. However, service was excellent all throughout our meal which was a huge plus. We ordered the following things:\n\nSalm\u00f3n Ahumado (Smoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey): This was the first thing we ate and probably my favorite bite of the night. It wasn't the first time that I've had smoked salmon on toast but this was a masterpiece. Perfectly soft and seasoned just right.The truffle honey added such depth and a pleasant taste that we instantly wished that we had just ordered a bunch more of this to eat. \n\nPan con Tomate (Cristal bread, tomate confitura, house Cured Jam\u00f3n Serrano): It was basically bread with this tomato jelly. I've never had tomato jelly quite like this and it was tasty! Different. My husband didn't really care for it too much though and found the cured jam\u00f3n serrano way too salty. I agreed that this whole dish was just a tad on the salty side but I still found the dish enjoyable. \n\nSunny side-up Huevo With Shrimp (crispy potato, chorizo dressing): Shrimp and eggs! This looked delicious but once our server mixed everything together for us, it became very clear that the dish was just drowning in oil. It was so heavy and there was nothing to cut through that greasy tasty and honestly it was very unpleasant. We did not want to finish this and had to drink a lot of wine to get rid of that oily coating inside our mouth. \n\nPaella ( bomba rice, jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo with thumbelina carrots, pickled garlic scapes, lemon alioli): Paella is honestly one of my favorite foods in the whole world. With that said, Coqueta did not have the best paella. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty. But I found the rice to be slightly under and that crispy bottom that makes a good paella was a little too burnt. However, I absolutely enjoyed the large shrimps that came with this dish and it was definitely a good portion for us to share. \n\nBizcocho de Arroz con Leche Salvador Dal\u00ed (warm molton arroz con leche cake, huckleberries, arroz con leche ice cream): This was such a pleasant surprise! I've never liked rice in my dessert but we ordered this because my husband likes sweetened rice. This dessert was absolutely delicious. The cake wasn't all that sweet but it was the perfect accompaniment to their rice ice cream. Unique and fantastic. I would order this again and again!\n\nTrio de Pintxos (salted caramel with pimenton, blood orange gelatina with bergamot black tea sugar, olives dulces with chocolate glaze): Everything was made in house which was pretty impressive. I really appreciated the fact that Coqueta opened me up to different flavor combinations. This was a nice way to taste a variety of gourmet candy and it was really fun to try something new. We especially enjoyed the salted caramel with pimenton. \n\nManchego Cheesecake (with caramel popcorn): This was just a small bite and it was a good finish to our meal. We enjoyed the texture, and the caramel popcorn that provided the right bite to the creamy cheesecake. It was good but I think it's perfect as a small bite. I don't think I could eat a whole slice because it was very sweet and very rich. \n\nOverall, this was a solid Spanish tapas restaurant. We walked out and a little buzzed from the bottle of wine we had. Of course we paid more than we would ideally like but we were on vacation and it was worth the splurge for us.

This restaurant lives up to its reviews. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our two year anniversary. When you walk up to the restaurant, it looks like a little shack, but that area was just the bar. To the right of the entrance is the actual restaurant for dining.\n\nOur waiter was awesome. He gave us great suggestions on how to order from the menu. He said typically, people usually order one big entree with three tapas or they order three tapas each. Their most popular entree is the paella, and since I'm not that fond of paella, we opted to order three tapas each. \n\n* Patatas bravas \n* Coles de Bruselas (crispy brussel sprouts)\n* \"Sunny side up\" huevo\n* Albondigas a la feria (duck and pork meatballs)\n* Jamon Iberico de Bellota\n* Pluma (pork shoulder)\n\nI really liked how our waiter paired our tapas together in the order of bringing out the dishes! They're such small dishes that you think you won't be full, but by the 5th dish, you're struggling to eat even just a bite. But SOOO GOOD. \n\nThe potatoes had the right amount of crisp that I like. All their meats are thoroughly marinated and full of LIFE! I was a little hesitant on eating the pork shoulder because it was still somewhat red, but it had enough sauce and flavor that I didn't taste the medium rare-ness of it.\n\nMy boyfriend told our waiter that it was our anniversary so he said he would work something out for us. (Bf told him while I was in the bathroom.) He ordered the bizcocho de arroz. When our dessert was brought out, our waiter threw in two caramel cheesecake bites for free. The bizcocho had a piece of chocolate that said \"Feliz cumpleanos\" haha but hey, it's the thought that counts. OMG as if the food couldn't get any better. As I've said in many reviews, I've got quite the sweet tooth and both desserts didn't disappoint.\nOh! How could I forget the drinks that we ordered?! I got a galleon and bf ordered the barca gintonic. My drink was sweet with strawberries and didn't taste like gin at all. My bf's was terrible, but he seemed to like how strong the gin was.\n\nWe will most definitely come back.

I'd like to see some reassurance on the menu that their seafood and meat is sustainably sourced and cruelty-free. (I looked, but if any such reassurance is there, I missed it.) Sure, tapas ain't usually cheap, but this is just overpriced. If it's going to be expensive, the food should ethically sourced. I just hope that the expense means the workers are paid well. \n\nSomething I value most regardless of a restaurant's fanciness factor is when a place makes an effort to be accessible to everybody including poor, working, and middle class people. Coqueta caters to the city's gentrifiers with its tech and financial industry diners conversing tersely at the bar or \"bonding\" with awkward, noticeable artifice over group lunches. Everybody looked and sounded tense and uncomfortable. No community vibe or sharing here. It felt like walking into an exclusive club that you don't want to be in. Anybody looking to support something that feels welcoming and relatable in the way we like to be here in the Bay will be disappointed. This place feels surprisingly cold for a tapas bar, which, when done right, should be a hub of social warmth. Coqueta needs to invite more diversity to make its groove more friendly.\n\nWith a few alterations, Coqueta could be a happier dining experience, but I won't be back until I see changes to their social commitments and menu.", "author": "Chris Z."}

(Sorry that doesn't sound articulate, lol.. then again, I started my review with: HELLA FANCE. So there goes that.)\n\nThe only thing to note is that it's very loud in here. I don't know what it is with the acoustics but I felt like I was straining to hear my friend across the table from me.\n\nAnyway, on to the food and drinks.\n\nCocktails start at about $14, typical of the area. High quality ingredients and beautifully garnished. I got the Barca Gintonic and my friend got the Sutter Splash. Both were very well balanced and it was worth the price tag.\n\nFOOD.\n\nHUEVOS NACIONAL $7 - 3 STARS - $7 for one whole egg? It's only two halves. $3.5 per bite. Even ignoring the price tag, I didn't feel like it was all that great?!?!? Maybe I'm just not a fan of deviled eggs, and PAYING that much for a deviled egg. The flavors were very complex with the bonito and the pickled saffron potato. I appreciated the complexity, but I was still sad that it cost seven freakin' dollars and it didn't rock my socks off.\n\nABONDIGAS, $14 - 4.5 STARS - 3 small meatballs. But, very rich. I cut my meatball into 4 pieces because it was that rich! This is something you want to savor and eat slow. Very rich in duck flavor, extremely soft & tender. Borderline almost falling apart even when moving it over to my plate! The cherry salsa and shallots on top were a perfect complement.\n\nPLUMA, $38 - 3.5 STARS - Everyone RAVED about this, so I ordered it.. and yeah... it was good pork and very tender. BUT IT WAS ALSO ONLY LIKE 8 PIECES. I don't mean to compare with House of Prime Rib.. but it's $50 over there, for a full slab of meat, plus a second slice, AND sides, soo..... it was hard for me to justify this. The honey chili glaze was interesting, but I would have preferred a more savory/heavy sauce. Tasted a bit bland on its own but i guess they wanted the meat to speak for itself.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO (mushrooms), $10 - 5 STARS - SHIZ. Now these, I can justify paying more for. Perfectly roasted, extremely garlicky, and not too soft. I ate these with the pork shoulder and it made it 100% better, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nOverall, I put down $125 after tax and tip for a satisfying meal.. 2x higher than I'd like but I guess I can check this place off the list since I had been curious about it for a while now.\nDon't think I would return unless a friend picked this place and it was for an occasion!", "author": "Emily C."}

I had some amazing mouth-watering bites that I would definitely go back for. All of their tapas are very small and ordering a few of these can really break the bank. For example, their skewers are delicious. My favorite was definitely the chorizo. However, when they came out..they were more so on toothpicks and the size of a quarter. Eh, definitely did not want to share that with my partner.\n\nAfter trying their Salmon Ahumado, I had to immediately place another order. DELICIOUS! This smoke salmon had honey and truffle oil placed on top of baked bread. One of the best things to eat in San Francisco for sure. I also had their Jamon iberico as an appetizer. Nothing but good things to say about this meat. Not a lot in the portion but it was worth the high price tag of $29 or so. We also tried the Mar y Montana (uni with Jamon Iberico added on top of it) - 2 pieces for $14, Patatas Bravas (potatoes), the octopus, and duck & pork meatballs. I'm definitely a fan as the food did not take long to hit the table. Quickest was about 5 minutes for the skewers to be delivered.", "author": "Emily T."}

He knows how much I love Spain and tapas, and how much I've been dying to go back, so this was a perfect date. \n\nIt was packed when we got there on a Saturday night, but of course, we had a reservation. We sat at the bar and it was awesome because we could see the cooks in kitchen in our view. It would have been nice to see the view of the pier, but I love watching people make food too lol! \n\nWe ordered 3 different tapas. Salmon ahumado, pan con tomate, y sunny side huevo. I loved the salmon ahumado, it's exactly like the salmon bagels you get in a cafe. My boyfriend is from Ecuador and always raves about pan con tomate, so I'm glad I got to try it. It was good!! The bread was nice and crunchy, while the tomate was a nice acidity and you could add sea salt to it. The sunny side huevo is what I didn't picture, because I didn't really enjoy it. It was too oily for my taste, but my boyfriend finished it all up.\n\nWe also ordered the paella and pluma. I've had paella in Spain, and it definitely doesn't compare- a little too dry, but still good flavors. The pluma was too die for!! My boyfriend and I literally fell in love. The sauce and tenderness were decadent. I can just think about how good it was and my mouth starts to salivate. \n\nI also had a yellow sangria, which was okay. I should've definitely just stuck to the red. \n\nWe got the carajillo for dessert. Brandy ice cream with espresso poured over- so lovely! Perfect way to end our meal. \n\nSide note: you definitely want to be on the trendier side when dressed. Also, this is not a cheap place, but well worth the money.", "author": "Tryshna M."}

The one on the menu stated 32oz, and there was no way we were going to finish a 32oz steak and 4 tapas.  The servers were very attentive, constantly busing dishes and bringing out our food.

I made a reservation for 2pm but showed up around 10 minutes early.

I mean, how can you go wrong with fried potatoes topped with a dab of aioli? The meat and cheese platter was pretty good, too, but I didn't like the bread they provided, they had two overly crispy slices of bread and these little bread sticks. Wish they give you more stuff like honey or compote. The meat and cheese selection were very good, though, although highly over priced for the portion size.\n\nThe kale salad was just meh, the same for the meatballs, which tasted organ-y, although I liked the glaze on top. The octopus was a bit tough, which was disappointing. The best part of that octopus was the potatoes that came with it.\n\nI asked for extra bread for the cheese and meat platter several times, and none came. The service is basically what you can expect from restaurants like these - sufficient and impersonal, basically a study in sufficiency. The total bill, including tip, came out to be around $110 for brunch with one drink.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "description": "It was one of my friend's birthday and she made a reservation at this place. Our reservation was for 8 and only 2 of us get to the restaurant on time. But the restaurant was nice enough to seated us instead of crossing off our reservation. \n\nAs we walked into the restaurant, we were not quite impressed by the decor and the environment. Because it was just not that special. But as we were seated, the waiter came right up to us (Even just 2 out of 8 people) he started to explained the menu and the drink to us. We were quite surprised and felt welcomed. As our group continued to walk into the door, we started to have a full table. Then the waiter explained the entire menu again to us. But guess what!!?? 8 people deciding what to order for tapas were not an easy thing to do. So we gave the waiter the full power to constructed the dinner menu for us. If I recalled correctly, we have about 12 course meals for that night.\n\n1. We had 2 plates of Cheese plates with some meat (Sorry I cannot name the cheese and the meat, because i forgot what was the names LOL).\n     There are 3 different types of cheese (Blue, Smoked Cheddar, and goat cheese?). I loved all 3 of these cheeses, but the blue cheese was too strong for me. The cheese itself have a really strong aroma the just spread through your entire palate. The strong creamy texture goes really well with the cracker provided with the cheese plate. Overall it kind of give you a mouth-gasm if you love cheese! As for the meat, I believed there are porchetta and 2 other types of meat that I don't remember. The meats were great, but not as memorable when compared to the Cheese. But if you LOVE CHEESE. Give the cheese plate a shot! \n\n2. Razor Clams & Chicken pot pie roll and grape fruit & Egg, Shrimp, Meat, fried potato thingy (Sorry I just don't remember what it called), Meatball\n     a. The razor clams was simply served with sea salt and half of a lemon. You sprinkle the salt by yourself and add the lemon juice by yourself as well. To be honest, i believed it will be better if the clams were about the same size. Overall, the taste was fresh but then it's not really a memorable dish. Could give it a shot or not.\n\n     b. It's basically a chicken pot pie inside a roll LOL... it was great but it's pretty much just a chicken pot pie inside the roll and that's pretty much it. The grape fruit slice was to help you to clean your palate.\n\n     c. You basically can only taste the meat under the egg and the flavor from the shrimp. Otherwise it wasn't quite memorable at all\n\n     d. The meat ball was only okay, it's really heavy and it's quite blend in my opinion. Wouldn't really recommend this dish to anyone.\n\n3. Shrimp & Bread\n     The grilled shrimps were fantastic! It's a bit spicy but the flavor was awesome. The plate looks a bit greasy, but you can't really feel the grease when you are eating this dish. The bread with the sauce on the plate was also a good combination!\n\n4. Steak\n     This is basically their \"MAIN Course\" The steak was tender and the seasoning was just right. The seasoned the steak with seasalt, but the salt was not overpowering the nature flavor of the steak! Overall, this is an amazing dish! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH\n\n5. Paella\n     This is a great disappointment in my opinion. Everything else are all flavorful and super good for your taste bud, but the Paella was a let down. The rice was not seasoned it was really blend and it was greasy. As you take a bite of the rice, it's super oily and heavy and I wouldn't really want to take a second bite. The shrimp was perfectly executed and the flavor was great. The clams were tiny but the taste was great as well. But the rice itself was a really big disappointment.... \n\n6. Grilled Octopus \n     This is another HIGHLY RECOMMENDED dish. It's small plate garnished with some potato. You will probably get 3 tentacles from this dish but the tentacles were pretty big. The seasoning was great and the octopus was not over cooked. It was not rubbery at all it was tender!! I'll highly rate this course. \n\n7. Dessert \n     The dessert was a small cheesecake wrapped by camel. If you don't like your dessert way too sweet. I wouldn't recommend this at all. But if you enjoy your dessert with lots of sugar! This is the plate to go. \n\nOverall, the experience was great! But Only the Steak and Octopus were the most memorable dishes. Not saying other dishes were bad, it was just not as memorable as these 2. If you want to try Paella (Spanish Rice with Seafood) I would not recommend this at all, since the rice was really blend and under seasoned. \n\nWe gave the waiter the power to construct our menu and it was a great experience. But if you have a strict budget, I WOULD NOT recommend you to perform such act, cause it will hurt your wallet LOL....", "author": "Jeff H."}

It was 5 girls and we ordered skewer platter, 8 appetizers, 3 pitchers of some kind of coke drink and a pallela which ended up being a $325 total. From the beginning W was a complete douche bag  He suggested we order the beef steak for another $88 and another pallela for the 5 of us...do we look fat??? Why r you trying to increase our tab??? Then when we tried to order 2 more octopus left appetizer, he said \"no.\" Wtf??? He said he thought if we were asking if we had ordered those appetizer and he was answering  no we haven't ordered them...really??? He was very unprofessional and just seemed like he wanted to gtfo there. Maybe he had a bad day, maybe it was a long busy shift. But it doesn't give you any excuse to be unprofessional and a completely disassociated waiter. Toward the end, I think he got the clue that we were very unhappy with our service and tried to be \"nice\" but at that point the damage had already been done. This night was for one of our best friends who just had  baby few months ago  and hasn't  had a girls night out in forever. She is post partum, hormonal and didn't need a snatchy, snarky waiter to tell her to keep ordering  more food and drinks. To top it off, he charged us for 2 sangria pitchers which ended up being $76 dollars which we didn't order. The management was very nice and took this off our tab immediately.

Right off the Embarcadero at the end of the Financial District, you can meet said friend for a nice drink or dinner.   \n\nBecause it's tapas style, you don't necessary need a table to share a meal, but if you would prefer to do a sit down dig, make sure you make a reservation ahead of time as they are really busy and all their tables are filled most nights. \n\nThey are known for their delicious Gin drinks, but they also make some great other varieties.  I picked up a very delicious Mojito and my partner in crime ordered basically their version of an espresso martini.  Their wine selections are also really good. \n\nFood wise, if you ignore the hype, it's fairly decent.  We did a tapas night and ordered the following: \n\n** Manchego Cheese Plate with Jamon   - Pretty good, though the cheese tasted stale.  Jamon was good. \n\n** Chicken croquettes - Creamy and delicious.  Each plate comes with 3. \n\n** Pork and Duck Meatballs - Falls apart a bit, but still tastes delicious.  Again comes with 3 per plate. \n\n** Roast assorted vegetables  - Delicious, I thought it would be actually more like turnips and stuff, but it was actually mostly greens like Mustard leaves. \n\n** Grilled octopus -  A little over cooked.  Not as awesome as their sister restaurant Bottega's version.   \n\n** Flan with poached apples for desserts - F**king amazing.

The place was crowded even on a rainy Sunday night. I felt a bit out of place because my denim was soaked and my boots were filled with water. Nonetheless, we sat at the chef's table, which is more or less a second bar area.  I actually enjoyed it because we got to see the sous chefs putting together a lot of the pastry dishes, which was cool. I can see how this type of seating arrangement might be a turn off to the more elegant crowd. But I'm one to rough it through.\n\nWe went by the waitress' recommendations and got 3 tapas and a main dish. Tapas arrived in this particular order; brussels sprouts, octopus, prawns.  I got the brussels sprouts mainly to have some veggies but they came deep fried and honestly tasted like potatoes and were presented similarly to the patatas bravas that I see so much on here.  This is a nice to have item.  The must have items are the octopus with fingerling potatoes and head-on prawns.  These were grilled and you could taste the smokey flavor.  With the prawns, you could suck on the head (that's what she said!) after you eat the meat to get some more value out of your money.  I decided against it because my friend would have judged me and left. \n\nMain dish was the Paella. A little pricey for rice and seafood but the presentation was pretty killer.  I think Coqueta's specialty is prawns because they I ended up eating like 6 of them throughout the night in various dishes.  There's also some salty pork goodness in there that reminded me of Chinese sausage.  However, the experience was worth it to me. Its shareable and I highly recommend for the couples out there looking for something to split. \n\nGet the gin and tonic if you're drinking. It's nice and fresh to start and looks great in Yelp photos!", "author": "Quoc N."}

We just stopped in for drinks, so we went for the bar area, pleasantly shielded from the bitter cold of San Francisco at night.  We got the \"Sun Never Sets,\" which was pleasantly sweet but mild, and the Beso de Barca, which I absolutely LOVED.  It was sweet, but balanced to start, then was followed by a kick of jalapeno sugar created surprising depth and a treat for my tongue.  We also picked up a few small tapas, the Patatas Bravas, a simple yet starchy treat of smoked new potatoes, garlic aioli, and salt (yum), and their Boquerones, white anchovies skewered with fresh fall vegetables, which went superbly with the sweet cocktails.\n\nTo be fair, everything was a bit on the pricey side, but what isn't these days in San Francisco?

They definitely up the game on traditional Spanish tapas with some delightful spins.  It was a little uneven, but the highlights really make it worth the visit.\n\nPatatas Bravas: Delicious! Little potatoes that were soft on the inside and crispy fried on the outside.  A nice dollop of aioli on top and tons of smoky pepper sauce to dip it in.  Much better than the unimaginative diced potatoes so many tapas places serve.\n\nAlbodingas: Duck and pork meatballs with a tart cherry salsa on top.  A lot less dense than typical meatballs.  They pretty much fall apart when you dig your fork in.  So tender!\n\nPaella: It was good, but not great.  Kinda small for serving 2-3 people.  The rice was either burnt (like well beyond crispy) or a tad soggy.  I was really hoping for a nice layer of crispy (but not burnt) rice.  The shrimp probably could have been cooked a little more; it wasn't raw but it wasn't very firm either.  The chorizo was tasty and generously portioned, dominating most of the dish.  The clams were standard.\n\nChurros: The mixed berry powder was AMAZING!  I've eaten a lot of desserts, but never had this before.  It's like fruit in cocaine form.  The chocolate was a little disappointing though.  It was thicker than hot cocoa but not as thick as European melted hot chocolate.  The churros themselves were fine.", "author": "Adam B."}

Definitely not what the pictures you see from here. When I asked the waiter, he said the chef had extra pieces so he used them. So I'm paying for scraps!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-15", "description": "When I went to Coqueta twice a couple years ago during my birthday week, I had thought that I tried a good sampling of their menu.  But with my recent couple of visits, I realized that what food I had there before barely even scratched the surface.  I got try a bunch of stuff I didn't have, and they were some of the best items on their menu.\n\nOne thing to note is that their bar is pretty cool.  I never actually hung out there before, but when I had dinner there with a few friends, I arrived early to try their famous Bar\u00e7a Gintonic.\n\nBar\u00e7a Gintonic -- http://bit.ly/1KzsPZL\nBloom London dry gin, Fever Tree tonic with grapefruit and pine.\nA very fragrant, refreshing cocktail that's visually appealing.  Okay it looks like a fish bowl, but still looks awesome.  I'd surely order this again.\n\nIt's also good to know that when you're at the bar, you can also order anything on the menu.  So you can enjoy a few small plates and pair it with some wine or a fancy cocktail.  I still think my favorite drink there is their Porron Kalimotxo that I had before.\n\nWhen it came to dinner time, even though I had been there before, we pretty let our waiter decide what to get on their menu for the most part.  And he hit it out of the park with all his selections.  Here are some of my favorite highlights from our dinner:\n\nGambas al Negro -- http://bit.ly/1FQNqHP\nOlive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce.\nNicely cooked prawns and the garlic flavor was pretty strong.\n\nSalmon Ahumado -- http://bit.ly/1Jlagdh\nSmoked salmon, queso fresco, truffle honey\nThese were like little fancy lox bagels.  The truffle honey really made them super rich and delicious.  I actually liked these better than their Mar y Montana, but they're not that far off.\n\nPluma -- http://bit.ly/1GTMAfF\nIberico de Belotta Pork Shoulder Loin with Honey Chili Glaze\nMy favorite item of the night.  I think out of all the things I wanted to try, this was my most anticipated.  The pork was so tender, moist, and flavorful, that it really didn't need the Honey Chili Glaze, but the glaze was a great sweet flavor enhancement when drizzled on.  This is a must order!\n\nPaella -- http://bit.ly/1BEIXnH\nBomba rice, Jamon Serrano-Shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, cauliflower and lemon aioli.\nThis Paella is awesome!  Visually and substantially!  You'd think that even though you're at a fancy restaurant, the portion would be small, but this was a perfectly portioned paella for my group.  It came with huge shrimp and was loaded everything listed above.  Why didn't I order this before???\n\nOverall the dinner was a great experience.  Everyone at the table enjoyed our waiter's personal selections.  When I came back again with another group of friends about a month later for lunch, we pretty much ordered the same things above, plus a few things I had from my past visits like their Duck and Pork Albondigas and Patatas Bravas.  All was good and they didn't miss a beat with any of this things we ordered.\n\nAfter having dinner and lunch here again, it's no wonder why Coqueta is still one of my favorite places to dine in the city.  So much variety on their menu, a great place to dine with group of friends or dining solo, and their bar is a great spot to hangout.  Still highly recommended!!", "author": "Rodney H."}

I really needed a break from my non-airconditioned, tiny hovel in San Jose and a tasty dinner on the bay was just the ticket.  \n\nAt Coqueta, celebrity chef Michael Chiarello, showcases his take on Spanish tapas with a nod to bountiful California produce.  The food was fresh and care had been taken in the preparation, but they don't waste time of making it look fancy.  \n\nDefinitely start with a cocktail here, the gin and tonics are amazing and this is coming from a self confessed gin hater!  I started with The Flaca, which had gin, lemon tonic and hard cider. It was a refreshing and served in a champagne glass.  Just what I needed to start with on a hot night. \n\nBeing housed in an old ferry building, gives the place high, beautiful ceilings with large windows for letting that bay breeze inside to cool things down.  They also have a small outside patio and a bar that is enclosed, that is first come first served if you don't have a reservation, a nice thing to know if you show up with out reseses.  \n\nWe started with the meat and cheese plate and how can you go wrong with freshly shaved Iberico ham and Serrano.  Yum!  From there we split a 4-5 tapas, which was perfect for our group of 4.  We stayed away from the three large plates, opting to sample more variety than waste money on an expensive main course.    The stand outs were the Patatas Bravas, perfectly salty crispy tiny round potatoes with garlic aioli.  Duck and pork meatballs were also a favorite, with the tangy sweet cherry salsa.  Definitely have 1 or 5 of the skewers, I especially loved the pickled quail egg with serrano.  Mmm, serrano.  \n\nThe star of dessert time was the Carajillo, a Spanish brandy ice cream with hot espresso poured on top.  Wow!\n\nDefinitely recommend this one to friends, would be best in a small group, so you can try more things.  \nParking is sometimes expensive in this very touristy park of SF, but we found street parking a few blocks away, so check the meters before you spring for a lot, especially if you don't mind a stroll!", "author": "Sharon W."}

The octopus was incredible the seasoning and the sauce was very flavorful and not too much, it was perfect. The potatoes were given to us on the house,  it was my tied for my favorite dish of the night. It was marvelous light fried giving the potatoes a crunch with a soft inside and the aioli droplet added to the flavor. The tomato based sauce one the middle just gave it the savory flavor I wanted. The loch bites were more on the sweet side than savory but were tied with the potatoes for my favorite. The smoked salmon on top had a sweet honey glaze over them which was tremendous. The bagel bites that salmon was resting in was toasted to perfection, giving it a crunch to the softness of the salmon. The paella was admirable the chorizo was flavorful and had a small kick. The shrimp was heavenly. However it was burnt on the bottom which made it not as enjoyable as it could have been. The food overall the spectacular and I would definitely come back for the food. The drinks were amazing and very exotic. \n\nThe service was impeccable! They were quick to pick up our empty cups and dirty dishes and bring out our next round of food or drinks. They were exceedingly friendly and nice. You couple obviously see them working together and as a unified unit. The ambience was very modern and a step up from casual, about collard shirt dressing.

I figured wine, fruit juice, not too potent. Turns out the cocktail was not as innocent as I thought, and I developed a sneaking suspicion I had consumed it too quickly. \n\nThey brought three tiny bites on a plate, tortilla, manchego cheese with quince paste and I forget the other one (was it the cocktail?), but all were good. Asparagus had not been on line but was on menu with romescu sauce, I ordered as a starter, dropped some sauce onto the table and then dipped a corner of the magazine I was reading into it. (Memo to self: water is for quenching thirst, cocktails for sipping). They had a couple of specials that both sounded good (clams, sausage); I ordered the sausage along with the meatballs. \n\nAsparagus was great. Sausage good but not really special. Meatballs really good, could have eaten twice as much. A lot of things on menu look good, the group next to me seem to have ordered nearly everything!\n\nTres chocolates for dessert and manchego cheesecake bites.

What's not to like about this place?\n\nLocated in the Pier 5 building, I expected this to be one of those overpriced, trendy tapas restaurants where the prime waterfront location would draw customers, more so than the food. But as attractive as the interior was with their eclectic mix of rustic and chic, the dishes that we ordered were well prepared and simply delicious.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n-Croquetas de pollo. Recommended by our server as the 'best croquetas you've ever had', the crispy chicharon crust paired with the smooth and creamy chicken and pea filling was savory and texturally perfect.\n \n-Setas al ajillo. A beautiful mix of wild and cultivated mushrooms coated lightly with sherry, garlic and chili. The flavors were mild but interesting and a sure hit for any mushroom lover.\n\n-Pulpo a la Parilla. A classic dish of wood-grilled octopus. Cooked perfectly to a nice bouncy texture,retaining a nice subtle smoky flavor. Presented simply to enjoy the flavor of the octopus. Excellent.\n\n-Albondigas a la Feria. These duck and pork meatballs were simply the best albondigas I've had. The sweetness of the duck paired with the saltiness of the pork created an absolutely addicting flavor.\n\n-Gambas al Negro. Perfectly cooked gulf prawns w/ garlic chili sauce. Head suckingly delicious. Easily the best dish of the day.\n\n-The Classic Paella. Well balanced and seasoned with shellfish broth and a good mix of seafood and jamon serrano. Not the best paella I've ever had, but certainly a solid version.\n\n-Churro 'Fantasia'. Crispy little churros with a side of drinking chocolate. How can this possibly be bad?\n\n -Manchego Cheescake bite w/ caramel popcorn. Our server gave us a couple of these on the house. The manchego keeps it from being too sweet. Nice way to finish a meal.\n\nI've rarely been to a tapas restaurant where each dish we ordered was so thoughtfully prepared and had me anxiously anticipating the next one. Maybe not every dish on their menu is a hit, but I was seriously impressed with each one that we ordered. And considering that you can easily rack up a hefty bill when enjoying some tapas and drinks, the consistency of quality was appreciated. Add to that a pleasant outdoor patio, friendly and attentive service, and an efficient reservation system, and you have yourself a mighty fine dining experience.

I actually rate this 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4 because of the drinks and good service. The flavorful cocktails are beautifully presented with flowers and herbs, and are pretty strong too. I enjoyed the \"El Gran Plat Cap\", as it was a great way to start to the meal. It was interesting to taste the varieties of cured meats and cheeses. The Salm\u00f3n Ahumado open faced sandwich, crusted chicken and English pea croquetas, and bikini brioche are my favorite hot tapas here. \n\nThe restaurant's signature paella was pretty average to me. The seafood in the dish was noticeably frozen and the rice was also slightly overcooked. I don't recommend the skewers; they taste boring and really aren't worth it at all. The churros didn't meet my expectations and were not nearly as good as the $1 ones at Costco.\n\nThe ambience is very unique; it is a lively and loud environment where the interior reminds me of a Spanish aristocrat's dining room. The music was a little too loud in my opinion, but tolerable. It's probably better to come with a bigger group of people so you can order a variety of dishes.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy sitting at the bar, but that's typically when dining alone or you don't have a reservation.\n\nThe Embarcadero location of Coqueta is awesome! The food was pretty good, not the best I've had, but pretty good. We started with El Plat Cap, an assortment of meat and cheese, marcona almonds and membrillo. Our gin cocktails and red wine were great! We moved on to Mar Y Montaa, who knew that you could combine uni with lomo? It was tasty. Of course, as this is a Spanish restaurant we had to have the Pulpo a la Parilla, which was also quite nice. We also tried an heirloom tomato salad that has dried octopus shaved on top. Not on the menu, but were told about it and we enjoyed it. Seemed a bit more Italian than Spanish, but tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe best part of the evening was when our server asked (don't quote me verbatim), if we had had enough. Strange. Are you upset that we ordered multiple tapas and beverages as opposed to entrees? Maybe we looked like we needed to portion control our meal? I could probably stand to lose a handful of pounds, but never had my server tell me so. ha ha. Or maybe they were just trying to turn over the table to seat another couple at 10:30 PM?

Our friend was able to garner a noon reservation at Coqueta, since he wanted to treat us to his his favorite restaurant and their huge Rib Eye steak. \n\nLocated on the San Francisco waterfront right at the Embarcadero and Broadway, the restaurant has a rustic industrial feel. It's a Spanish tapas / small plates establishment with a wood fired grille. Parking right across the street is expensive $23 but it is convenient. We were seated promptly and the White Wine Sangria was excellent. \n\nOur friend ordered a bunch of small dishes along with extremely large Rib Eye steak. The following dishes came one after another not all at once. \n\nBread with a tomato spread\nSerrano Ham\nSmoked Salmon with cheese and honey on toast.\nGrilled Octopus\nSauteed Shrimp\nEggplant with a cheese on a bun.\nCoquetas\nRoot Vegetable Salad\nSauteed  baby mushrooms\nRib Eye Steak. \n\nAll of the dishes were excellent. They do have a heavy hand on the salt but that's what tapas is about (to drink more drinks). The service spot on, dishes came, empty plates were cleared, new silverware were placed. The Rib Eye came out whole and was then taken back and sliced. $230. before tip. Highly recommend.", "author": "George F."}

It was so hard to get reservations but they accept walk-ins for their bar area, which is quite sizable so we found a place to sit quite easily. \n\nWe started out with deviled eggs. They had some tuna on top, which is different from the usual deviled eggs. It was a good start, nothing mind blowing but good. Next came the pulpo (octopus) and the grilled mushrooms with garlic. The pulpo was really good, nicely chewy but not too chewy that you can't stop chewing it before swallowing it. The mushrooms were the BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT! I love garlic so this was right up my alley. I could have this mushroom dish over some rice and just have that as a meal. Yum! The next few dishes were just average...peppers, sunny side up with shrimp and chorizo, and gambas (shrimp) negro. Maybe we came in with such high expectations that these dishes just fell short of it. Without alcohol the bill came out to be ~$45/person. Pretty pricy for average dishes.

We barely saw him during service and we had to ask the waiters around us for water and other drinks etc. We sat down to order approximately at 745... knowing clearly what we want. The apps and smaller plates came out beautiful! But then it went downhill. My friend and I sat there for the next 25-30 min wondering where our mains were. We had to ask several times to several different people and would get, \"just a few minutes.\" The manager came over to offer us free dessert and tried to explain that the paella takes 45 min. Sure, but if we put our order in at 745 and it's now 915, how do you explain that? Well, I'll be back regardless, but it's so disappointing when the service is not on par with the food.

I love that they have quite a variety of cocktails using gin. Love the Conquistador.  We also ordered the churros which was good but again I have had the same dessert somewhere else that was executed a little better than here. This could be a place you would want to try and if you do get the Brussels sprouts and their charcuterie. The salmon with truffle honey was good but on the sweeter side.

Usually when I frequent a new place, I never know what I want to order in terms of drinks. Do I want a beer? Nah. Then I noticed most of the patrons had this kick ass glass pitcher that I had never seen before in my life- *I'll post a pic soon* We looked at the menu, found out which drinks our served in them and decided upon the Agua de Valencia. The waiter said it's like a Spanish mimosa...only there is vodka and some other liquor in it. For $19, it did seem a bit high, but I was game to try it. Soooo glad we did. So refreshing, so tasty, not too strong...and the best part about it? We got a total of 4 drinks out of it. Score! \nIf you're ever in the Embarcadero, seek this joint out.

For drinks, the cocktail menu has a selection of signature cocktails, specialty gin and tonics as well as local and international beers, wines and ciders. The two cocktails I tried were marvelous - superb flavors, beautiful presentation and fairly priced for the area. \n\nThe first cocktail, a mojotio, made with arehucas rum, lime, minted cane sugar and tarragonlime \"air\" (essentially some foam on top). It was amazing. I would make this at home if I could, but I am certain it would not turn out the same. The second drink I tried was one of their Spanish Gin & Tonics, named the Spanish Holiday. This cocktail was crafted with Square One Botanical Vodka, Bonal Gentianequina, Lemon And Soda - served with a fresh flower.\n\nIn terms of food, drinks and venue Coqueta has got it goin' on. The only downfall was the service. On the two occasions that I have been here, servers are unable to prioritize and serve clients in a timely matter.

But we found ourselves here yesterday and kind of enjoyed it. My girlfriend rave about their drinks being amazing. And she was right. We came during an afternoon but they were closed for an event. Worried not, we waited! \n\nThey have a bar area outdoor and a small patio as well a full dining room. The patio was full of course so we opted for the bar seats. Super high outdoor bar seats. It gets very hot in there. But you can see the stunning bay behind the bar, sip cocktails and just feel like you're outside. \n\nDrinks \nSangria ~ you can get a whole carafe or enjoy them by a glass. It had just the right amount of wine, ice and fruit. I like it. \n\nGin cocktails!! These are the star attractions here for me. They bring out your choice of cocktail minus the gin.

Our reservation was right at opening and it got pretty busy immediately.\n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed. It's expensive but worth a visit.\n\nFOOD: Most everything on the menu looked pretty delicious to me. I'd recommend coming with a bigger group so that you can order and try more dishes without going bankrupt. Highlights for me were the MAR Y MONTANA (sea urchin sandwich) and the SALMON AHUMADO (smoked salmon sandwich). On the other hand, the pintxos were rather disappointing.For $2.50 per bite-sized skewer, I was expecting something more impressive, and while they were pretty tasty, they weren't particularly unique in flavor.\n\nPRICE: Expensive! But it's tapas so there shouldn't be any surprises there. They recommend getting 3 tapas per person, so it can easily add up to $50+ per person, but my friend and I found 4 tapas and 3 skewers to be enough. \n\nSERVICE: Solid and attentive. The waiters checked in on us now and then refilled our water frequently, though they did mess up and refill my friend's water with sparkling water instead of normal water. Food comes out quickly.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Pretty lively and trendy restaurant. There's a nice view of the bay and LOTS of natural lighting during the day (always of fan of well-lit places). There's table seating, high table seating and bar seating, but the place isn't super big so all the tables are rather close together.\n\n=======================================\n\n-PINTXOS ($2.50 each) - 3/5\n[bite-sized skewers]\nThe pintxos are on 7x7's Big Eat list for 2015, but I wasn't particularly impressed. I tried 3 skewers: the BOQUERONES (white anchovie), CHORIZO, and HUEVOS DE CODORNIZ (quail egg). The skewer combinations/pairings were actually pretty good, but just not that special and not really worth $2.50 per bite. My favorite of the 3 was the white anchovie, so I'd recommend that if you really want to try one. The chorizo was tasty but not unique. The quail egg was the most disappointing - just tasted like a normal egg.\n\n-MAR Y MONTANA, sea and mountain ($14) - 5/5\n[Ib\u00e9rico lardo gently melted over sea urchin with lomo ib\u00e9rico]\nMMMM a must try! The sea urchin was soo soft and creamy. Basically melts in your mouth. The bread was incredibly hard and crunchy, which I normally wouldn't like, but I think it was a good contrast to the texture of the uni. GET THIS.\n\n-SALMON AHUMADO ($8) - 5/5\n[Smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey]\nYUM. I could probably eat a million of these! If you like smoked salmon, you'll LOVE this. The salmon had an amazing soft texture that was contrasted nicely with the hard/crunchy bread. The truffle honey was delicious! Subtle and lightly sweet, and paired really well with the salmon and cheese.\n\n-GAMBAS AL NEGRO ($14) - 4/5\n[Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce]\nThe shrimp was cooked perfectly tender, and the sauce was pretty flavorful but lacking in the \"chili\" aspect. I'd recommend sucking on the prawn head - it's full of flavor! The dish comes with 3 prawns and 3 slices of toasted bread/baguette that's good for sauce-dipping.\n\n-PULPO A LA PARILLA ($14) - 3.5/5\n[Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil]\nTender and nicely grilled with a slight smokiness, but honestly, the texture was probably much more memorable than the flavors. The potatoes were pretty bland and didn't really add anything to the dish.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The restaurant tends to be a little overpriced for tapas, but I am writing this review mostly for the purpose of criticizing the poor customer service I received.\n\nI work as an admin and event coordinator, and I had a group holiday dinner for 10 people for my work. I had emailed and called Scotty Kennedy several weeks ago to arrange for this event. Originally, I inquired about the availability for a dinner and he said yes. Then he came back and said that the dinner could start at 8:15pm. I said no, that's too late. I was planning to go with a different restaurant. But he said that my team could arrive at 7pm and have an area reserved at the bar. He said we could start with appetizers and cocktails, and then we would move to the main table at 8:15pm for entrees.  So... although I had misgivings, I signed the contract.\n\nMy team arrived even earlier than expected before 7pm. I checked in with the hostess and we found a spot to stand at the bar. The center table in the bar was occupied, but I assumed that she would clear an area for us to eat when it was closer to 7pm. \n\nWe stood and ordered a few pitchers of sangria. But no one came with food or offered a food menu. By 7:15pm, I was confused and upset. So I went to the hostess and demanded her attention. She looked annoyed with me, and asked me which party I was. I looked at her screen and pointed-- \"There-- party of 10 at 8:15pm.\"\n\nSo she clicked on the reservation and then saw the notes that Scotty had made about having an area reserved for appetizers at 7pm. Just the look on her face made me realize that she had not seen this before. I was furious.\n\nAt that point, the hostess realized her mistake and spoke to her manager on duty. He came to me and tried to apologize, but I just kept shaking my head. I don't know what he was thinking he could do to \"make it up\" to me. My team had already waited an hour, some people were really hungry and tired, and the servers in the bar area didn't even offer us food menus. I said to him, \"Just make sure that we get seated as early as possible.\"\n\nWe were seated at our main table at 7:55pm, and from that point, the rest of the dinner was fine. My team is full of gracious and forgiving people who ended up having a good time. But I am still seriously disappointed with our event.\n\nI sent an email during the fiasco to Scotty and asked him to call me. So far, no call back.\n\nAlso, when I received the tab, nothing had been given to us as a complimentary gift. They charged us for every drink, every dish, every piece of overpriced cheese on a toothpick skewer.\n\nSo, overall, I would say that Coqueta's food is fine but I won't go back. They just don't care anymore about meeting basic expectations of their customers. They overbook their tables, act annoyed, and don't reply to emails. I don't know where their communication broke down, but clearly they just don't care enough to follow up with me.\n\nAnd really-- There are so many great restaurants in SF, and Coqueta isn't even the best for Spanish tapas!!! There's Contigo, Bellota, Aaatxe... Go anywhere but here. Go to La Mar Cebicher\u00eda Peruana next door. Go to The CHEESECAKE FACTORY.

The albondigas is good, though a little too sweet for my tastes. The paella is okay. I would have expected better from a Michael Chiarello restaurant, but the other dishes make up for it. \n\nFor dessert, the churros aren't bad. The pan con chocolate ice cream sandwich is good.

The bf and I were craving some lunch, so we went to Coqueta (before we realized this was Michael Chiarello's place. Celebrity chefs are cool, but it's not worth going to the restaurant just for the name). Overall, pretty much but there were a few standouts:\n\nOctopus: Really good. Can't put my finger on why, but it's just delish. The fingerling potatoes that came with it were bomb.\n\nThe sunnyside up eggs with chorizo: By far, the FAVORITE. It's sooooo good together. I'm not a culinary expert, just someone who spends way too much $$ on food but you must, must get this dish. \n\nLemonade: Yeah, I said it. As someone who has the beverage choice of a 12 year old, I enjoy a business that doesn't think they're too bougie to sell a yummy non-alcholic beverage that's not seltzer. \n\nGood/average:\n\nThe albondigas: Unexpectedly sweet, with a sweet savory glaze. Meatballs felt that they could have been cooked a little further on the inside. Would recommend if you like sweetness.\n\nMushrooms: Not memorable. Kinda burnt tasting.\n\nThe deviled eggs: Presented beautifully, but was just OK. \n\nOverall, service was good.

Starting there, everything about Coqueta therefore needed to be even more spot-on spectacular for my partner and I to celebrate with him.\n\nWill first outline our brunch order:\n-Pintxos: Bite-Size Skewers\n--Boquerones: White Anchovoe, Campo Real Olives, Pearl Onion and Piparra Pepper\n--Chorizo: Roasted Artichoke and Piquillo Pepper\n--Manchego: Jam\u00f3n Serrano and Apricot-Sherry Conserva\n--Huevos de Codorniz: Quails Egg \"Diablo\", Pickled Mustard Seed and Jam\u00f3n Serrano\n-Alb\u00f3ndigas a la Feria: Duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry-tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot\n-Chorizo\n-Salm\u00f3n Ahumado: Smoked Salmon, Queso Fresco and Truffle Honey\n-Mar y monta\u00f1a, \"sea and mountain\": Ib\u00e9rico lardo gently melted over sea urchin with lomo ib\u00e9rico\n-Pluma: Acorn-fed, Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze\n-Paella / Spanish Rice: The classic, made with bomba rice, jam\u00f3n serra-shellfish broth, gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo with thumbelina carrots, pickled garlic scapes and lemon alioli\n-Churros\n-White Sangria\n-Coffee\n\nDefinitely glad we had a reservation. Once inside -- and it's a lot bigger inside than one might think from just the windows -- the interior fills up quickly.\n\nImmediately, I must say, come here for at least two items: both their Pluma and their Pintxos! The former takes at least a half hour's preparation time, but is so savory and delicate, served upon a wooden platter with the glaze aside, that every bite is drool-worthy. The Pintxos are each creative and fantastic as well, always a tasty summation of ingredients on a large toothpick or mini skewer. My favorite of those (of course!) was chorizo, although the Quail Egg gets a close 2nd place.\n\nI did enjoy the content atop the Duck meatballs and Salm\u00f3n Ahumado, though I would have preferred the breaded item that was applied on to be much less crispy. I think a softer bagel texture might fit better, just my preference.\n\nThe Paella was also grand, and was served in a sizzling pan atop a rolled out type of cork platter. Lots of shrimp, clams and other flavors of the bay inside this delight. The pickled garlic and thumbelina carrots helped mold the different spin on the flavor.\n\nThis Embarcadero pier location was very close to another my other half and I were used to visiting somewhat often, La Mar, so I was happy to get to show my dad that as well.\n\nChurro topped it all off for us -- as if we weren't already full! Everything tasted delicious, though, and great service. Should order less items on a non-birthday occasion to avoid being \"pleasantly plump,\" but their flavors demand your presence.\n\nFinal Rating: 4.5, rounded up", "author": "Garett T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-18", "description": "Such a disappointment. We came here while scoping out places on Embarcadero for a private dining event, so I guess the upside is that this was an easy one to cross right off our list... \n\nWhen we arrived, the front area (tented bar and small entryway) were totally swamped with people and we could barely get in the door. We waited around for a few minutes, smushed between people exiting the restaurant and what I assume was a private event spilling out into the entryway from the tented bar. Eventually we decide to enter the main dining area and see if the host(ess) stand was there. We were about 10 minutes early for our reservation and were asked to wait - fine, no big deal, but we were rather harshly told not to wait in the main dining area...so basically we had to wait either among this huge, rowdy party in the other room or out in the freezing cold? Thanks. \n\nWhen our reservation time came, we were seated at the bar. I often ASK to sit at the bar, but I was somewhat shocked that we had a reservation and were seated at the bar without warning or even a polite \"I hope it's ok.\" The stools were very uncomfortable and there wasn't much space for dining. You are served from behind, which is also a nuisance at a tapas place where there are many dishes coming and going. All in all it's just not a nice bar to eat at, which makes it even worse that we were simply seated there without being asked. It was also one of those rare winter-jacket-necessary days in SF, and no one offered to take our jackets, leaving us to stuff them under the bar. No one came to take our order until we'd been seated for about 15 minutes, and our drinks came 10 minutes after our food. Meanwhile, a couple who came in minutes after us was seated at a table immediately and had cocktails before we'd even ordered, and two tables right behind us remained empty the rest of the evening. Not sure what's up with that, though I will mention that my dining partner was the only person of color in the whole restaurant - take that as you will. \n\nOur waitress was a lot more pleasant than the front-of-house staff and gave us a thorough run-down of the menu. Since we were checking out other places, we opted for just cocktails and a few snacks. The pintxos were great, particularly the quail eggs. Everything else was lackluster - the chorizo could have been from Trader Joe's and the Pulpo was salty and...meh. One cocktail (from the SF-inspired list) was great, but the cocktail from the G&T list literally tasted like oversweetened lemonade. \n\nOther negatives: Long, cramped line for the bathrooms (there appears to be two single-gender bathrooms; not cutting it given the number of people in the bar/private dining area), uninspiring view considering the location, loud/drunk patrons (though to be fair, it was 10-11pm on a Saturday).", "author": "Lindsay B."}

I am a huge fan of grilled octopus done right. It was delicious. We also had the paella, with grilled corn and micro greens. It was surprisingly rich and decadent.

This is the gem of Spanish tapas! The Jamon Iberico is thin, delicate, salty, and literally melts in your mouth.\n- Pan Con Tomate: It's simple. Bread slices that are lightly toasted and spread with tomate. We always order this and layer a couple slices of the Jamon Iberico on top. Delish!\n- Patatas Bravas: If you like french fries, you'll love this dish! It's like the better, more sophisticated version of french fries! The patatas bravas are crispy and have a hint of smokiness. Each piece has a dollop of garlic aioli on top and a side of bravas salsa to dip in. Perfect finger food for sharing!\n- Albondigas a la Feria: Hands down some of the best meatballs I have ever had! The duck and pork mixed together give such rich flavor. And the salsa on top sort of tastes like a quality barbecue sauce. A must at this restaurant!\n- Pluma: My family and I about fell off of our seats when we tried this dish!

Not really seasoned except flavor of the grill and a spicy oil they drizzle over top and fingerling potatoes.

It's tomate-y and smoke-y and something else that I can't quite pinpoint. It's amazing and not salty at all, just packed with flavor. \nSunny-side huveos - 5/5. Some reviewers said this was too salty but I found that it wasn't salty at all! In fact, I don't think the crispy potato has any salt on it, and if it is, it's only lightly salted. The chorizo dressing is amazing with just enough spice to make the dish lively. \n\n\nDessert\nCarajillo - 6/5. DAM. Spanish brandy ice cream with espresso over top (affogato essentially). Some sort of magic happens when you mix espresso and ice cream. You get the super fragrant aroma of espresso that pops right out at you. Highly recommend ordering this, even if you're full -- it's a small dessert.", "author": "Melody L."}

As is the common recommendation with San Francisco - make a reservation.  I did about a week beforehand for 5 and at that point they were almost full already.  And it was PACKED on a Wednesday at 7:30.  We even had to wait an extra 10 min for our table.  \n\nWhere to start? The most important place: The food!  \n\nI lived in Spain for a year and learned to LOVE Spanish food and am on a continual mission to find good Spanish food in the USA. And these guys did pretty well.\n\nThe best thing we had: The Albondigas.  They were so good we ordered more.  5.5 stars. \n\nAlso good: The Croquetas - nice and crispy. The Pimientos de patron. The Tres Salchicas - The Morcilla was even good and I didn't like Morcilla when I lived in Spain! The Gambas al Aljilio. The Cheese plate - surprisingly good size for a cheese plate and with yummy almonds.  The Patatas Bravas - nice and crispy, good sauce. \n\nDisappointing: The tortilla - which is really too bad cause tortilla along with Paella are pretty much THE Spanish dishes.  \n\nWe decided to just go with tapas and more tapas, cause really, that's what the Spanish do anyways.  \n\nThe Sangria was decent. Not the best I've ever had but decent.\n\nFor dessert the churros and chocolate hit the spot.  The cheesecakes were too rich for me, but others in my group enjoyed them.  \n\nOur server was a super nice guy.  Very laid back and a little silly - but we enjoyed him (even though he forgot to order or second pitcher of Sangria until we reminded him).  \n\nClean, well staffed, good lighting - lots of windows.  Nice presentation of the good and the drinks.  \n\nNot cheap, but not so bad you can't afford it from time to time when you need to celebrate. (So nothing like the cost of Spanish food in Spain, but we are not in Spain).", "author": "Sarah C."}

Croqueta is located on the Embarcadero at the 5th pier, and there is patio seating as well as two sections of seating inside. My friend and I sat in the main seating area, and it was beautiful with the high ceilings and Spanish decor. \n\nMy friend and I got different types of Gin & Tonics that they offered, and I really enjoyed it. Although the alcohol was strong, the flavors were immaculate. We decided to order tapas to share for the table as well as an entree to finish off.\n\nHuevos Nacional- Deviled eggs with english pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato- This was by far more interesting than a typical deviled egg as Croqueta combined really strong flavors to make this dish. The pickled mustard seed added a nice tang, and I really enjoyed it. I didn't really think the potato on the bottom matched, so I ate that separately.\n\nMar y monta\u00f1a, \"sea and mountain\"- Ib\u00e9rico lardo over sea urchin with lomo Ib\u00e9rico- This tapa was my absolute favorite. Who would imagine pairing sea urchin with proscuitto!? The salty and sweet of the two really complemented each other, and I was surprised at how amazing it tasted. My friend did not really like the combo, but I absolutely loved it. \n\nCroquetas de Pollo- Chicharron crusted Chicken and English pea croquetas with cured seasonal citrus- another fantastic dish. The croquetas reminded me of Jose Andre's but less salty, and the inside was so soft and creamy. The citrus added a nice touch on top as well.\n\nPulpo a la Plancha- mediterranean octopus, freshly dug fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil- The octopus had a nice charred taste to it, and it was textured nicely on the outside and really soft in the inside which tasted amazing to me. The potatoes were good, but I wish there was more octopus!\n\nPluma- Acorn fed, Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze- This was another highlight of the night. The pork shoulder was medium rare and it was so juicy, tender, and flavorful. I was shocked at how fantastic this dish was! Possibly the best pork shoulder I've had. The honey chili glaze added a really nice sweet touch to it, and I was surprised at how well it went together. Damn.. wish I had some more of this!\n\nSetas al ajillo- Wild and cultivated mushrooms with garlic, chilli and sherry- Great compliment to the pork dish. I love mushrooms, and this was yummy!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the small bites at $4 which were super cute.\n\nManchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn- Super interesting.. it tasted like manchego cheese but in cheesecake form. I liked the outer coating and the popcorn that went with it as well.\n\nPan con chocolate, ice cream sandwich with olive oil ice cream- I love olive oil ice cream, and this dish did not disappoint! I would recommend ordering this.\n\nI had a phenomenal experience at Croqueta, as the food, service, and decor was spectacular. I'm so glad I decided to eat here as I now know how delicious this restaurant is! Will be back the next time around hopefully to try the other dishes that are available. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in SF.", "author": "Celine L."}

Love the ambiance and the interior especially the open kitchen.\n\nWe ordered several tapas and a main dish. The server recommended that we go with 2-3 tapas a person and to share a main dish and it was more than enough food. \n\nChicken croquetas: 5/5: these were delicious. It tasted very similar to a chicken pot pie rolled in bread crumbs and fried. If you like chicken pot pie, you will like this. It just sucked that they were so small and they only give 3 an order :( had to share the last one with my boyfriend.\n\nDeviled eggs: 3/5: these were perfect bite sized tapas but they didn't really stand out flavor wise. I was thinking. They would have a good flavor but they were just ok.\n\nGrilled octopus: 3/5: the octopus was grilled to perfection except that it was overly salty. Even eating it with a potato it was still really salty. Not sure if it was suppose to be that way but I probably wouldn't get this dish again.\n\nWe were suppose to get the sunny heuvo which the server recommended but that tapa never came out instead they took it off the check and brought out our paella.\n\nPaella:4/5: I actually liked this dish. Sit was flavorful and tasty. It looks like a lot of toppings are on top but not really, it's actually more rice than toppings. I did enjoy the shrimp, clams and veggies on top. \n\nThis place was just ok, I probably wouldn't come back anytime soon.

Tonight was a miss.\n\nHave gone here several times for business lunches, casual corporate dinners and for social time with friends. The menu has good variety, and the food is pretty good, not James Beard, but tasty. They have a decent cocktails, beer and wine selection. I like the ambience on the Embarcadero, the shared concept, and usually the service is good, so I usually have a fun time here. I have always had a nice lunch or dinner here and leave happy and have turned several people on to this restaurant. \n\nHowever, tonight, it was very disappointing. Had a 5:30PM early dinner res.  The check was dropped despite we had not asked for it, and ordered another drink.  Not an issue, we were served, but then shortly asked to move. What restaurant moves you at the tail end of your dining experience from the restaurant to the dark, cold bar section on the other end? Again, we had a reservation, which were 2 barstool seats at the bar in the restaurant (yes, NOT EVEN a table). We both found it odd that we were asked to move to the back bar, even though there were 4-5 other barstool seats open in the restaurant. We were very civilized and we assumed it was for a future seating, but we did see other open spots....\n\nWhen we followed the instruction of our wait server we moved to the Bar which was a different section of the restaurant. As we were about to grab a stool, they told us we can't sit there. \nIt was actually still early after 7, but dinner was still in full swing. It was awkward, disruptive and rude to go from enjoying dinner to having nowhere to sit to finish the meal.  \n\nThey sloppily grabbed two stools and placed it by the door in the entry way as a solution. Mind you, it's December on the Embarcadero and we're on the Bay, it's freezing cold! My coat was in coat check and isn't that a fire marshall code violation to have people finishing their meal in the walk way/entry way by the door? We both were so confused and felt that this had to be a mix up and there had to be a different solution. Luckily after realizing what was done, the gentlemen who might have been the manager \"allowed us\" to sit at the bar after all to complete our dining experience, which went from lovely to awkward. \n\nI rarely Yelp when I get bad service, however, this was just awkward and a total downer on what was supposed to be a lovely night.  Had to share with others to be aware that this may happen to you.  This is a place where many locals, tourists and nearby folks from East Bay BART in for, or from Marin take the Ferry in to enjoy a meal with friends.

The location is fantastic and the view beautiful of the bay. You definitely need reservations, this place was packed on a Thursday night! We got here early and had a drink at the bar. What a fantastic selection of gin cocktails! I got the conquistador and my husband the cocktail with Iberico infused gin. Mine was very light and fresh with notes of fennel and anise, and his savory with ham and citrus. So different and delicious. We were seated and decided to start with the meat and cheese board. Fantastic selection! It had tomato sauce, marcona almonds, some breads, and an amazing sugar crusted thin bread. We then proceeded to the quail eggs bites that were pickled and had mustard seeds. Freaking delicious. We also had the croquettes and meatballs- both were recommended and both delicious. The duck and pork meatballs were so juicy and had an amazing cherry sauce with bits of fried shallots on top. We shared the pluma- an Iberico pork shoulder loin with honey chili glaze. It was cooked to perfection! Our server recommended the wild mushrooms with chili and garlic. Sooo good. They were perfect alongside the Pluma. It was my husband's birthday, which I mentioned and they brought out the manchego cheesecake bites. It was so amazing. Bits of cheesecake and and carmel corn were fantastic. The only strange thing is, they charged us for it, and we actually didn't order it. We thought they just brought it out on the house. A bit strange, but it was $4 so we shrugged. We ordered the churro donuts with chocolate sauce for our actual dessert. They were chewy and moist! The chocolate sauce was not too rich and added the right amount of sweetness to the donuts.

And the first time SUCKING SHRIMP BRAINS OUT OF THE HEAD!\n\nWe came here without reservations (on a week night) but it was only just the two of us so it was easy to get a seat. We sat at the bar area which had a nice view of the waterfront and bay bridge. There's something special about breaking bread with those that you are un-explainable connected too. It's one thing to get into deep conversation and then having one teach me how to suck shrimp brains LOL.\n\nBARCA GINTONIC ($13) - bloom London dry gin, fever tree tonic, grapefruit. The presentation is beautiful, tastes good and garnished with flowers. Highly recommend if you looking for something not too sweet.\n\nHOUSE CURED BORQUERONES ($2.50/skewer) - white anchovies, olives, pearl onion, guindilla peppers. This was the tiniest skewer I had in my life but the tastiest. Flavorful to the palate, one can taste each layer and then the anchovy towards the end. Recommend if you want a quick bite of saltiness.\n\nHUEVOS NACIONAL ($7) - devils eggs filled with spring pea, smoked pimento aioli, on pickled saffron potatoes and olive oil pouched bonito. Literally, how fancy can you get with a devils egg?! I've had many variations of a devils egg but nothing like this. We ordered another serving because it was very good. Highly recommend.\n\nGAMBAS EL NEGRO ($14) - olive oil pouched head-on gulf prawns with black and garlic chilli sauce. WOW!!! This was the best dish of the night. The sauce drizzled over the prawns did not look anything special but it was. The was the shrimp was prepared was perfect, not under or over cooked. They say the shrimp head has all the juice and flavor. Was never my thing to peal my own shrimp, let alone, suck a shrimp head. I was missing out all my life. Shrimp head is SO good, it was packed with flavor. The texture reminded me of a very thin pur\u00e9e. The the color was a tan color. Highly recommend!!!!!!\n\n\"FANTASIA\" de FIDEAU ($15) - puffed vermicelli with gulf prawns, crispy baby octopus, jamon gamba broth en gel, lemon aioli. This was also delicious, however the gulf prawns weren't as exciting as the Gambas el Negro. It was enjoyable to have more than one seafood in the dish. I actually enjoyed the crispy baby squid over the prawns, it picked up the other flavors and added a different flavor to the bite. Recommend.\n\nALBONDIGAS AL LA FERIA ($14) - grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and temprannilo salsa, and crispy shallots. Didn't take a bite, I don't eat duck. But from what I've heard, it's delicious!!!! \n\nPULPO A LA PARILLA ($14) - wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potatoes, pimento olive oil. I'm more into baby octopus than regular octopus. I'm not into anything tentacles but this was a large tentacle. It was very soft to cut into and it has less flavor than a baby octopus but it was still good. Highly recommend.\n\nWill I be back?! Yes!\n\nUntil the next review.....", "author": "Jane A."}

We picked a few hot plates to share and decided to skip the cold snack style plates.  \n\nThe octopus and fingerling potatoes were cooked to near perfection.  I commented that the dish could have had more salt, but of course that's an easy fix.  The patatas bravas are essentially uber fancy homemade potato chips.  They were a nice break in the action before the next plate!  The grilled steak (I believe this was a chef special, not a mainstay on the menu) was juicy, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfect medium rare. The verdure a la catalana salad accompanied the steak dish very well.  We finished our meal with the apple pie dessert.  The pie is not a traditional pie slice, rather a small tart.  Nonetheless, the treat was a sweet finish to a fascinating meal.  \n\nI also must mention the drinks!  Ah, the drinks, the glorious drinks!  The cocktail menu contains a robust selection of sweet, spicy, and boozy drinks.  Highlights for me were the Castro and Spanish Holiday-- I took several pictures of our cocktails as they were almost too pretty to drink! \n\nThe plating of all dishes was sublime.

The grilled octopus had little flavor; The Albondigas duck and pork meatballs was severely undercooked (I almost gagged eating it) and too salty, the salad was so-so.\n\nFeeling very disappointed that one of my favorite places has deteriorated so much - I hope that the chef will come back to revive this place (otherwise the business will start to dwindle given enough time) if this was a representative night. There are just many other excellent restaurants to flock to in SF to take mediocracy here.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Really enjoyed the ambiance - it was not spanish at all though, more like a rustic mountain cabin. Maybe it was inherited from the previous restaurant's decor. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and were put at the bar area. We ordered some smaller plates to snack on there, then was seated when the table was ready. Some people next to us had their kids with them, and it very quickly became annoying with the kids talking loud next to us. I guess this is not a kid friendly place. \n\nI posted some food pictures - cauliflower steak was tasty. The pulpo (octopus) was very nicely cooked - smoky on the outside and tender inside. We didn't get the paella though. \n\nI have to mention the desserts - they were definitely the highlights on the meal! Especially this blue cheese ice cream, it was soooooo good. We just got a scoop of it as a side and it was heaven.", "author": "Wendy K."}

Call me girly but I am a sucker for pretty little flowers garnishing my beverages. And it's not just aesthetically pleasing, the drinks taste good too. \n\nThe first time I came here was to catch up with a BFF for happy hour. I suggested we go to Coqueta after seeing an IG post of a flower drink. We both LOVED it. A lot of San Franciscans do too, it was jam packed on a Friday night. I ordered the Spanish Holiday, my friend ordered the \"famous flower drink\" which happened to be a gin & tonic (Coqueta version of course), and we shared a cheese platter. Afterwards, we also ordered a party pitcher between the two of us. After we completely devoured and drank every sip of everything, we paid ~$35-40 each (tax and tips included). \n\nThe second time I went to Coqueta, it was to get a quick bite just before my first ever Elite Event (yay!) which was just yesterday. Anyway, I couldn't figure out where to get a quick bite to eat and I really wanted that gin & tonic, so I had to come back. I got bite-sized items to go with my gin & tonic and I ended up ordering a Tariff too. Surprisingly, I think I like the tariff more. But it might be because I'm getting bored of gin tonics recently. I am a million percent certain that I will come to Coqueta again. \n\nI cannot wait to try the food at the actual restaurant part, and the service is truly exceptional.", "author": "Denise L."}

It simply sets the mood and ambiance on having a splendid time here!  \n\nTheir gin and tonics cocktails are so colorfully vibrant and pleasant on sipping while admiring the view of the bay!  You can tell that they put effort in their drinks here!\n\nI do suggest reservations, otherwise, it may take awhile for limited seating and precisely ask for chair support compared to no back support.  It's just uncomfortable without support.  There is a side indoor patio with a bar, which you are more than welcome to dine at as well.  It's open seating so whatever pops up, is available.\n\nWe ordered aplenty and to start out, we ordered hot tapas, such as the Patatas Bravas (crispy potatoes with garlic alioli), Pulpo a la Parilla (grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes), Albondigas a la Feria (grilled duck and pork meatballs with crispy shallots all meshed together) and Croquetas de Pollo (like bite sized chicken pot pies served with cured orange).  The presentation for all of their dishes were impressive and displayed the restaurant's name, Coqueta, accurately.  I would say I like the duck and pork meatballs the most and the grilled octopus tapa.\n\nAs for their Arroz Cremoso de Verano, which was cooked with saffron bomba rice mixed with tomatoes, squash and corn, was a filler and may feed well over 3 people (counting that you will be ordering up other dishes as well). Do order it up with their mushrooms tapa with grilled seasoning.  It complimented well with the Spanish rice.\n\nLast, but not least, their freshly tossed and fun take on a fruity sorbet, which was made on the spot by a refined expert was eye-entertainment.  The cold steam that was exuding from the Gazpacho iciness was catchy and the sorbet, itself, tasted tarty, delicate and refreshing.\n\nService was on point and I love the homely Spanish decor of this place!   \n\nCoqueta does offer up a charm that makes you feel giddy inside!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

If you're looking for small bites that won't break the bank, read no more--this is not it. \n\nService here is excellent. We chanced the opportunity to eat here as a walk-in at 6pm on a Friday night. They were fully booked but due to a last minute cancellation, the hostess seated us immefiately as long as we agreed to be done in time for an 8pm rezo. Our water cups never went empty, wait staff periodically checked in, and we received a complimentary birthday dish- delectable, little manchego cheesecake bites to share, which were actually really tasty.\n\nTapas normally add up, especially these, being a few dollars a bite. A few standout dishes include the salmon ahumado with truffle honey --perfect balance of sweet and savory smoked salmon on two slices of crisp baquette and the paella! Oh the four gulf shrimp were so sweet and juicy! That's some pricey shrimp, but the paella was cooked with just the right amount of smokiness and crunchy rice stuck to the bottom of the pan. \n\nI'm not sure I would be back on a regular basis, but it was worth the visit. Located at the Embarcadero on Pier 5, it has a great view of the water and the rustic interior with the high beam ceilings give an inviting feel. A hip place to take your out of town visitors for drinks and apps after a day at the Wharf.\n\nOverall, I would give it a 3.75, but due to such awesome service, I'll round up to a 4.", "author": "Amy L."}

However, this time the service was better, and the urban legend of excellent food became a reality.\n\nWe chose a seat outside in the sunshine, indulging in our tapas, sipping on sangria and people watching.  We kicked off our feast with the chef's selection of cheeses and cured meats.  I wish I had taken a picture of this plate in all its varietal glory, but I assure you this is one of the best meat and cheese plates ever.  It came with some bri, bleu cheese, a couple slices of bread, tiny bread sticks, bits of  flat bread, fancy Marcona almonds, chorizo, prosciutto and quince cheese or membrillo.  \n\nNext, we ordered the deviled eggs which were an interesting, delectable concoction filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n aioli, topped with tuna on a pickled saffron\npotato.  The Abondigas a la Feria (duck & pork meatballs) were pretty good too but not one of my faves.  The tart cherry tempranillo salsa it came with made the meatballs somewhat sweet.  If you're not a fan of sweet meat, this won't be a hit.  The best for us was hands down was the grilled octopus and fingerling potatoes.  The pliability of the octopus made for blissful bites.  We enjoyed this dish so much we ordered another.\n\nOverall, the food totally makes this place and even the ambiance is great with hip lounge music, but the service still needs help.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't consistent.  The busser was probably the most attentive in keeping our water glasses full and switching out our plates.  Our waitress was personable and nice enough but came out to the tiny patio which wasn't at full capacity multiple times and failed to see our attention directed her way despite the visibility of our empty glasses and pitcher.\n\nTowards the end, the service seemed to improve with various servers coming to our table to ask if we needed anything, but by then, we were finished and tapped out.  That will be our last time there.  It was too much  work to keep having to get a server's attention to order more and have our drinks refilled.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

What do people do in the City where they can have happy hour so early. So I decided to go somewhere else instead and make reservations online instead. \n\nEven reservations for one were hard to make, but alas I found a day that worked with my schedule and headed out to the beautiful Embarcadero restaurant for dinner. I was offered a seat at the chef's counter - amazing!\n\nI started with the Castro (fitting since I live in the neighborhood and love tequila). It was like a spicy margarita which I actually really enjoyed. It wasn't a hard spice that was on your palate all the time; it was more light and refreshing with a sprinkle of spice from the pepper which I enjoyed. \n\nFoodwise I decided to go with their recommended 2-3 tapas per person. I started with the pinxto which are these small bar bites that were recommended highly. I ordered all 5 that were available since I wanted to try everything. My two favorite were probably the one with the quail egg because it had this great flavor and felt bigger than the other bites and the chorizo with artichokes and peppers. The other three weren't bad, just not my favorites. \n\nI ended up getting two more tapas since the above were really just 5 small bites. I got the meatballs and the croquetas based on the suggestions of yelp. The meatballs were so delicious. After having these meatballs that were mostly made with duck and some pork now I realize I must have all meatballs that have duck in it. It's so juicy and the little bit of cherry salsa they had on top was such a great counterpoint to cut into the fattiness. The croquetas were mini chicken pot pies and I've had some bad ones before but these were so good. Breaded and fried, the inside was still so moist and had a bit of that chicken pot pie broth that everyone loves. \n\nI ended up having to get dessert because the churros just looked so good. The kitchen staff/my waitress was so sweet and also gave me two additions (the strawberry gelatina and the manchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn). They were interesting and the strawberry was definitely my favorite. I'm all for mixing a bit of savory into my sweet but the cheese in the cheesecake bite was just slightly too pungent for me. Overall though so kind for them to add those to my dish!\n\nAt the end of the night, it was a wonderful meal (slightly on the pricy side), and I had a great experience with the staff. \n\nProtip: Pinxtos and sit at the chef's counter if you can. It's amazing to watch them work and be able to converse with the chef as well.", "author": "Nina Y."}

The one dish everyone was looking forward to, and I highly recommended,  was of course the pork shoulder so we ordered 2. When it arrived, everyone grabbed a piece quickly and were super excited. Sadly, the meat was cold. We're guessing it had been sitting out for about 20 mins longer than it needed to. Cold meat is just not delicious no matter how good the quality is. Everyone was disappointed but at that point, we couldn't send it back since it was mostly eaten already. The prawns were overcooked and mushy and the bread/toast that came under the uni was way too hard and stale. The paella was not that impressive as it didn't have much flavor. The only good dishes were the peppers, croquetas, and the octopus. Then when the meal was done and the table was cleared, our server (who everyone at our table thought had the fakest smile ever) came to our table to double check that we were aware of the $5/pp cake cutting fee. My girlfriend was mortified. She had went through all the trouble of trying to make the cake a surprise, and the hostess had already made her aware of the fee when the cake was secretly given to them, our server still managed to ruin everything. When dining in restaurants, most birthday cakes and desserts come out as a surprise, so I would think someone who works in the service industry should know this?!

The charcuterie and cheese board we started with was delicious with my favorite being the aged bleu cheese. Best cheese I've ever had! We also had the heirloom tomato salad (fresh), the octopus tapas plate (delicious), and the huevos rancheros tapa plate (tasty). For our entree, we split the rib eye steak which was prepared medium rare and was amazing! We also ordered 2 plates of paella which was good.

After bringing some friends to the Ferry Building to check stuff out we took out our handy Yelp machines and brought up this place.  So happy to have came--everything was amazingly beautiful.  Food was really great.  And the service was amazing!--the place was full but every waitress and server was so polite and happy, and even encouraged me to take more photos! (and I soooo did!  it was so easy to make everything look great--check my pics out!)\n\n1. Sangria (White Win, Roasted Apples, Spices, House Recipe) 750ml Porron $36:  Despite the involved craft, the taste was not as complex as I was hoping.  It was of course good tasting as expected, but probably not as amazing as the description.  5/10.\n\n2. Salmon Ahumado $8:  Ha ha, so they called this an \"open face sandwich\" but seriously, just call it an hors d oeuvre!  Anyway, these will probably be some of the best smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres you've ever seen.  The honey makes it taste a lot more special.  7/10.\n\n3. Huevos Nacional $7:  Like many of the others, this is a masterfully re-envisioned version of a traditional dish.  Never had any deviled eggs like this!  Stuffed with spring peas and smoked pimenton alioli they say.  Very unique.  8/10.\n\n4. Patatas Bravas $8:  Hmmm, very interesting one here.  I would say this would kinda be like an ultra fancy version of tater tots, you know, if you used purple potatoes, smoked them, and made up a fancy dip.  You do taste the special taste of the fresh and fancy potatoes, but personally to me I'd go for a bit more kick.  Sauce is very slightly hot, but barely--could use a bit more heat.  The meat looks beautiful though!  7/10.\n\n5. Croquetas de Pollo $9:  Mmmmmm.... kinda reminds me of similar creations from Porto's in Glendale, but for 2x the price, ha ha.  Probably would fall in the \"comfort food\" category.  Tastes yummy though!  7/10.\n\n6. Albondigas a la Feria $14:  The most unique and complex meatballs I've ever had.  The meat is very soft and juicy on the inside, and though does resemble an Italian meatball, somehow manages to taste and feel totally different!  The outside flavor and sauce is quite strong and distinct.  I think for my personal taste I could use a slightly toned-down version so I could taste the amazing and delicate meat inside, but as is, still amazing.  And of course, they looked spectacular--never seen meatballs look so amazing!  10/10\n\n7. \"Bikini\" Brioche $10:  Like an ultra-fancy vegetarian grilled-cheese sandwich, cooked to perfection.  The bread was perfect--lightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft in the middle, with the eggplant adding a soft but comforting texture.  And of course all the cheesy goodness.  Mmm.  Unfortunately I totally forgot about the cooked peaches on the side 'till I finished the sandwich, so I ate them separately, which were great too.  8/10.\n\n8. Mar y montana, sea and mountain $14:  Holy crap.  I've never seen sea urchin (uni) outside of Japanese and other Asian cuisines.  I'm so glad we tried this--totally beats the pants of typical uni sushi.  The uni is great--maybe not the very fanciest and freshest out there, but definite quite good quality.  But the fact that they somehow incorporated their fancy house-shaved cured meat along with some other melty-goody stuff, man, this is a totally uniquely top-notch dish!  10/10\n\n9. Paella (vegetarian + seafood on the side) $45:  This a seafood paella but my friend doesn't like shellfish so the waitress was very quick to suggest they could make a vegetarian version and then put all the whole shrimps, clams, and pork sausage on the side.  It wasn't on the menu, but I get the impression they can modify any of the dishes as needed since they also made some adjustments on the previous orders in respect to portions.  That's really great of them.  Anyway, as for the paella, I haven't had too many over my life, but maybe it's the fact that they separated all the meat, but I feel there could be more flavor in the main rice.  The shrimp however was amazing!--so much char flavor and completely perfectly cooked such that the meat is cooked JUST enough to not be raw, and wish some good brains left for you to suck.  Maybe some of the best shrimp I've ever had!  Clams were a little meh though.  Sausage was dense artisan type.  I dunno... I think the vegetarian thing really hurt them, so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that if cooked properly it would have been better.  7/10.\n\n10. Churro \"Fantasia\" $8:  Of course, you guessed it, churros done fancy.  Unfortunately, I didnt't quite like the texture.  The outside is wonderfully crisped, but the core was kinda overly soft.  Flavor was great though, but unlike the others maybe somewhat traditional.  The drinking chocolate was good but could use more spice.  The sour powder was badass though--great kick.  5/10.\n\nWorks of art to eat.  Wonderful service.  Totally amazing experience.\n\n5/5\n\n#tapas #spanish", "author": "Dean C."}

Refreshing and delightful!\n\nWe started with the Patatas Bravas, which were the best I've ever had. Little potatoes  lightly smoked, encrusted with salt crystals, and served with a garlic alioli and smoked paprika sauce. The Croquetas de Pollo were served with a sliver of cara cara orange.  Very tasty, like nothing I've had before. The \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo With Shrimp were in a sauce that had lots of little chunks of chorizo, topped with a sunny side egg that oozed over the whole dish. \n\nThe Arroz Cremoso really stood out to me. It was a saffron rice in a cauliflower-corn sauce -- think soupy risotto where the cauliflower has been pureed and with sweet summer corn swimming in it. Absolutely heavenly!\n\nSkip the deviled eggs and \"bite sized\" Chorizo Skewer. The chorizo was cold and the skewer was teeny tiny.\n\nFor dessert the Churro 'Fantasia' was freshly made, rolled in cinnamon sugar, and served with a side of melted chocolate.  OMG so good.  I didn't care for the Flan Espa\u00f1ola; it was so creamy and rich, but I expect my flan to be more egg-y.  \n\nReservations are not too difficult to get if you're willing to eat a little early.

It's also conveniently located next to the Waterfront restaurant, which is a great place for a pre-dinner cocktail.\n\nThe menu features Spanish inspired tapas and family style offerings.

Upon arrival, we were brought to our seats... at the bar.    I was a bit surprised when the hostess explained that tables are assigned by priority, based on the order of which they receive the reservation.   In other words, if you make don't make your reservation early enough, you might be seated at the bar!    I think Coqueta may be slightly misunderstanding the purpose of OpenTable....as in Open \"Table\".  In my experience, bar seating is never included in the OpenTable inventory.   If having a table is part of the romance/ambiance you are trying to establish, you may want to confirm this detail upon making your reservation. \n\nBut I'm over it.

If she has no intention of giving us a table, then she have been honest to begin with vs. LYING that she would give us a table. \n\nThe manager basically said it was our fault the hostess lied because my husband pressured her.  Really?  Is she a child or an adult? Then the manager told us we are not welcome if we kept calling her staff liars.

As it was Valentines day weekend, it wasn't easy getting a reservation but luckily managed to get one.  \n\nCoqueta is a waterfront Spanish tapas bar located right on the Embarcadero pier with a semi-enclosed outdoor patio/bar area and of course the dining area inside. I loved everything about the restaurant including the atmosphere, food and service.  \n\nbite size skewers: tried the chorizo, jamon serrano and the quail egg skewer.  My favorite was the jamon serrano with manchego and apricot sherry preserves.  Such a great flavor combination of sweet, salty, savory :)\n\nsalmon ahumado: open face sandwich with smoked salmon, queso freso and truffle honey: Perfect balance of the saltiness from the smoked salmon and sweetness off the honey with a hint of the fragrant truffle :) So simple yet delicious.  I could literally have like 10 of these :)\n\nsunny side up egg with shrimp: crispy julienned potatoes,  sunny side up egg, shrimps with a chorizo dressing.  You mix it all up, take a bite and it will be an explosion of different flavors and textures in your mouth! Perfect combination :)\n\ncroquetas de Pollo: chicharon crusted Chicken and English pea croquetas with cured citrus.  Another winner but I was a bit disappointed by the extremely small portion size! The croquetas were literally as thin as my pinky but flavor wise, they were a winner.  \n\nensalada de kale: loved the lacinato kale salad with roasted butternut squash, pomegranate seeds and a warm garbanzo dressing! Subtle flavors but still very good.  \n\npulpo a la parilla: grilled octopus was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.  They were tender and definitely not chewy or hard in a bad way.

I come from a much smaller city, and reservations aren't really necessary. So I didn't think I'd actually be able to eat at Coqueta when a friend and I flipped a coin (tails: Coqueta; heads: Foreign Cinema) and came here. Upon arrival - let's say it was 7:30ish - they couldn't seat us in the restaurant (which was - of course! - full of people who had made actual reservations for the evening) or in the side room area because there was a private party until 8pm. At 8pm they suggested we could \"come back and try our luck.\"\n\nAt about 8:30 we came back and squeezed into two spots at the middle raised bar area in that side room. We found it slightly weird that all the private party's food was still out... especially when the servers made it a point to pull it away from us. Which, let's face it, is kind of weird. Take it away entirely or let the public pick at it, too. Mmmkay?\n\nOur first server clearly hated us and so we were thrilled when we suddenly got a new one - short, tattooed, and thoughtful about how loud and how packed it was. When I ordered the first plate I asked her if it was vegetarian. Without being prompted she suddenly ran through everything on the menu that was safe for me to eat and what they could alter - this was SO accommodating and made it so much easier on me. Usually I order something, ask if it's vegetarian. Order something, ask if it's a vegetarian. All servers everywhere should take a lesson from this woman. She also informed us - totally randomly but so serendipitously - that their food was cooked in peanut oil. Wouldn't you know, my dining companion has a peanut allergy. They then re-tailored the tailored options to suit her needs, too.\n\nDamn. Fine. Service.\n(After that first miserable dude.)\n\nThe food was okay:\n+Huevos Nacional: deviled eggs filled with spring pea and smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potato with olive oil and poached bonito, $7 - (sans bonito) this was definitely the most memorable thing. I could have probably just eaten these all night long and been entirely satisfied. Loved the different textures, loved the different flavors, loved the different colors. Perfection!\n+/- Coliflor con Romescu: yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha with coal roasted romescu sauce, $11 - this was very good, don't get me wrong, but I felt like the cauliflower could have been trimmed down a bit more. Not sure it was worth the price.\n- Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo: smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo-Vermouth vinegar, $4 - I actually ate one and then didn't touch the rest. Just a little underwhelming for me compared to everything else we got. I really wanted a bit more punch here, but it was kind of all one note.\n- Patatas Bravas: freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa and garlic alioli, $8 - again, kind of just \"meh\"; we didn't finish it and I nothing about it really sang to me.\n\nOh, and our drinks were fabulous:\n+ Sangria: red wine, manzanilla sherry, citrus, ginger berries, chamomile, and local apples, $9: This is one of the best glasses of sangria I've ever had in my life. Fruity, refreshing, flavorful, interesting, diverse... maybe next time I'll just order a pitcher (#formyself). Oh, it also came in this amazing glass that reminded us both of something our grandmothers would have kept on a shelf as a tchotchke (we mean this in the BEST way possible, trust me).\n+ \"Costa Brava\": arehucas rum, lime, minted cane sugar, tarragon, lime, $12: my friend's drink was lovely as well, strong and delicious.", "author": "Steff D."}

If you want to up the ante with happy hour or date night, Coqueta is the place to do it. \n\nThe gin & tonics are legendary here, with little bits of herbs and flowers added for botanical bonus points.

After we looked at the menu and made our choices, he picked and chose the order of our food and he was spot on! \n\nUnfortunately, I really wanted to try the \"Mar y Montana\", but they were sold out of the sea urchin (this gives me the perfect excuse to come back!).\n\nThe patatas bravas (freshly dug, crispy new potatoes, lightly smoked, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli). It was flavorful and the potatoes are perfect bite size pieces. The garlic alioli and salsa help brought out the flavor of the smoked potatoes. There was a great balance of salty and sweet.\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas (served alongside with cured cara-cara orange) (3 pieces). These puppies were like mini pot pies, bursting with richness in flavor! Super creamy and packed with great seasoning. The cured orange was served alongside with the croquetas, but I didn't try them. \n\nGambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on Gulf prawns with black garlic and chili). This was an amazing dish. Super delicious and the portion was perfect. The prawns were big and succulent. Dipping the prawns in the olive oil with the bread was heaven! This is a definite dish that deserve another round!\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp (served with crispy potato, and chorizo dressing). I was so involved in my conversation with Lowell, that I forgot to take a picture before he mixed the sunny side-up egg with the chili pepper! I was only able to take a photo once he served it onto my plate. You get to choose how spicy you want this dish to be. Lowell sliced a small piece of the pepper and infused it into the yolk and mixed it into the crispy potato and chorizo dressing. The yolk definitely added a creamy texture and flavor to the dressing and onto the shrimp. It was a thumbs up!\n\nWhole Monterey calamari on the plancha (with onion jam and squid ink alioli). We are so used to having calamari fried...this was an exceptional dish and the ink alioli was delicious. The onion jam was sweet and help balanced the flavor of the calamari and alioli. Delicious!\n\nWood grilled octopus (with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil). This octopus was super tender! I was really surprised at how well the octopus was prepared. It was made simple but full bodied flavor.\n\nGrilled albondigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo puree and crisp shallots). Easily another favorite!! This dish was exploding in flavor! I think the mixture of the duck and pork added such amazing flavor. From the fat of the pork and the flavor of the duck, it was soooo good. It was perfectly portioned as anymore than what we had would have been too much because it was rich in flavor!\n\nWhole grilled branzino (green olive oil and preserved meyer lemon salsa). Branzino is my favorite fish dish! It couldn't have been served better! The branzino was so moist and the meyer lemon salsa was perfection. I can eat the whole thing by myself. It was perfectly grilled and the smokiness from the grill added another component to the dish.\n\nPluma (Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze). This dish was also served with freeze dried pepper strings....it was interesting. It reminded me of saffron but it did carry a lot of flavor. The pork shoulder loin was cooked perfect. Moist, tender, and flavorful. The honey glaze chili paired well with the shoulder loin.\n\nIn between the meal, Lowell came by and brought a tray with an array of bite-size skewers. It ranged from house cured boquerones (white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guinoilla peppers), chorizo (roasted artichokes and piquillo peppers), jamon serrano (manchego and apricot-sherry conserva), baby beets (cana de cabra cheese, citrus, and spring onion a la pancha), and quails egg \"diablo\" (pickled mustard seed and jamon serrano). We tried the quail egg (yummy) and chorizo. It was tasty!!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros with dipping chocolate. The churro wasn't over done with cinnamon and sugar, they allowed the dipping chocolate to enhance the flavor of the churros. We sat by a couple who ordered the liquid nitrogen dessert. I had to sneak a photo op! They said it was really good.", "author": "Jane H."}

Coqueta is not cheap but it's a fun environment to be with good drinks and food.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it's a small place and on the pricier side but I think this makes the perfect date spot if you make reservations.

While I normally love to overlook the kitchen, the tall stools are unstable and uncomfortable and I periodically had to stand up to keep my legs from falling asleep.  The restaurant is already quite noisy, and sitting in front of the expeditor made it even noisier.\n\nI was very excited to try their twist on a martini, which was described as containing \"modernized spheres of 2 different coloured olives\".  When asked if they could do it with vodka instead of gin, the wait discouraged me and said the vodka wouldn't mix well with the olives, which I assumed meant some kind of molecular gastronomy spheres.  I was confused/surprised when I received a gin martini with 2 normal olives in it...  At this point our waiters changed and when I inquired, she told me that the description is wrong and they don't do the molecular olives any longer.  (So why did waiter #1 discourage me from getting vodka?!)  To her credit, she brought me a vodka martini and didn't charge me for the gin one, but it was still disappointing. They really ought to update the menu, or at least warn you when you order that drink.\n\nAll of the food presents beautifully. And its tasty, though not exceptional (and some was just weird).  The cauliflower \"steak\" with fantastic - perfectly grilled cauliflower with a small dish of sauce and some chopped almonds on the side. The pan con tomate came assemble-it-yourself style, but it was such a tiny amount of tomatoes compared to the bread, which seemed overly toasted. The cheeses were nice, but the flatbread came with some kind of membrillo drizzled on it which made everything overly sweet.\n\nWe opted for the little bites of desserts, which looked adorable but didn't taste great.  The manchego cheesecake had a pretty funky flavour, and the ice cream \"sandwich\" was a scoop of ice cream on top of a dry, chocolate cake.\n\nOur second waitress was incredibly nice but overall the restaurant seemed short-staffed.  We sat for long periods without water or trying to get someone's attention, which is particularly bad considering we were sitting right in front of the kitchen where all the waiters collect the food.\n\nThere are other places that are just as good with better service and better prices - I won't be going back here.", "author": "Rachel R."}

You can easily get a sample of a lot of things on the menu or pass onto others what you don't like. ;-)  But be careful, an experience at Coqueta is what I call ... \"upscale grazing.\"\n\nDefinitely bring a fat wad of cashola. Come for delicious staples like jamon serrano, pan con tomate, albondigas and patatas bravas. You can also find traditional dishes like paella or try the arroz con seta, basically a super yummy risotto with earthy mushrooms and candied satsumas.

I wanted to try again.    We ordered for appetizer the \"Chef's Grand Selection of Cured meats and cheeses\" for $38.   It had two pieces of cheese and a few almonds. For that amount of money you could go to  Costco and buy enough proscuitto and cheeses for a table of 12 people.   We ordered the paella again, priced at $45. for two.   The first time it seemed quite nice with a lot of different seafoods with the rice.  This time there were 6 prawns and a few very small claims and some chorizo pieces.    No mussels, no calamari.  A couple of waxed beans sitting in it.    In today's world, there is a lot of competition.   I have ordered paella at other Spanish restaurants with very nice results and for less money.   Another thing this time, there was no wine by the glass:   You had to order either a full bottle or order sangria.    I really preferred a glass of red wine, but had to order sangria, which was good, but not what I wanted. The service was acceptable but not note worthy.  Next time I want Spanish cuisine, I will head for one of their competitors, and there are a number of possibilities now in San Francisco.  Just want to add, and I've seen this happen before a different places, when a good reputation is beginning and a restaurant starts making money, they often start to cut back on their expenses, i.e., cut down on the amount of seafood, for example.   Make smaller portions.   But the price remains the same or is even raised.    That was the impression I got at Coqueta.  In all fairness, I should add that the people at nearby tables, seemed quite content with everything.", "author": "Charles L."}

Seriously, they could not stop talking about how much they loved the restaurant. And as the one who was tasked with picking the venue, I couldn't have been happier with the decision to eat here, because Coqueta came through for me. \n\nWhy so good? To be honest, I really thought this was going to be another one of those fancy, overpriced, uppity restaurants that are littered throughout FiDi. I was wrong. \n\nFor starters, the menu is fantastic and incredibly diverse. This is the rare place where it seems you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. And that's rare. \n\nSo as far as the food goes, I would recommend everything we had. A few highlights are below:\n\n1) Eggplant Brioche Sliders\n\nWhile everything here is good, the eggplant sliders were the real MVP. They must sprinkle fairy dust on them before they bring them out, because these eggplant things take you places you never thought you could go before. And I don't even like eggplant!!! You just simply can't deny that melt-in-your-mouth-ooey-gooey deliciousness that they bring tot the table. \n\n2) Patatas Bravas\n\nThese were also reeeallly good (however, if you come across the reviews that claim these are the \"best ever\" you may need to adjust your expectations, because while they are certainly high-level they are nothing like the real thing you'll get in Spain). But nonetheless, these are quite tasty indeed.\n\n3) Coquettas\n\nThese were pretty tiny size-wise, but flavor-wise very, very awesome. Absolutely packed with flavor, calling the Coquettas \"little chicken pot pie bites\" would not be inaccurate, and these also melted in your mouth. Definitely recommend. \n\n4) Gaucho Bistec\n\nExpensive? Yes. Absolutely f***ing worth it? Yes. This is basically a bone-in Ribeye steak made by the Gods. \n\nBesides ordering almost everything on the menu, we also took a stab at choosing some cocktails as well, and the one I saw come across the table were all really cool. There's definitely something on the drink menu for everyone. \n\nHowever, fair warning to all G&T fans out there - they serve their gin and tonics in a round fishbowl-like glass with grapefruit slice, pine stems, and brightly colored flower. Lovely presentation -- but they really know how to emasculate a dude. I mean, nothing says \"tough guy\" like a cocktail with a flower in it, right?\n\nThe super-colorful Gin and Tonic aside, Coqueta is a terrific place for a special occasion, and an even better place when you're not footing the bill!

My wife and I will definitely will come back ( with no kids), and sit at the bar contemplating the bay view. We also had the luck to sit and chat with the owner Chef Michael Chierello, what charming man, and down to earth kind of guy. We will come back soon.", "author": "Ben P."}

Arriving on a recent Sunday evening, the bar was packed, but the dining room was just filling up.  By the time we left, the restaurant was pretty much full.  Knowing it was close to the Ferry Building, I did not know the location until after driving around the block searching for a parking space.  It's actually closer to the end of Broadway than the Ferry Building.  The reception person was clearly organized in dispatching diners with reservation to various locations.  We were seated at a table near the one-bite station and open kitchen.  Our server was very kind in explaining the menu and giving recommendations.  After a short deliberation, here's what we ordered:\n\nApps\n1) One bite skewers (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tbcHWormA0lh3ONQXvYYQQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My choices were the chorizo with roasted artichokes and Piquillo peppers and quail egg Diablo respectively.  Chorizo was bolder flavor wise while the quail egg, likened to deviled egg by our waiter, was nondescript.  \n\n2) Wood grilled octopus (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_zYv9GF48YSlqDboDl5hbg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Had a difficult time distinguishing the fingerling potatoes from the octopus pieces.  \n\n3) Grilled beef short ribs (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0AfsjZ6uI0XpW7t8m9mdxA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Liken this to Korean kalbi without the sweet barbecue sauce, but with a chocolate sauce and pomegranate seeds.  Again, didn't really stand out.\n\n4) Grilled Albondigas (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=v6MIbT2IA0LAZ0riy10GdQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Three meatballs were perfectly apportioned for the three of us.  Good savory taste.\n\n5) Gambas -  Head on Gulf prawns, poached in olive oil with black garlic and chili.  Wasn't bad and even crunched on the heads, but wasn't anything special.\n\nShared large plates\n6) Pluma (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=liXPgFbmYwr39AWrR-T8gA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Roasted pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze cooked medium rare, a first for me with pork meat.  If I had a few drinks, might have mistaken this for a nicely done steak.\n\n7) Arroz Cremosa (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-vAeq_lBdaM6wMyJFB2fzQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Risotto like dish touted as Chef Michael's personal favorite, garnished with chopped dayboat scallop pieces and squash with blossoms pieces.  \n\nDessert\n8) Churros with chocolate sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=abFvOlOuuJgo4kdDZb3X6g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -  Served slightly warmer than warm, there were four pieces.\n\nMy dining companions, knowing how I enjoy Yelping restaurants, asked me what I thought.  After a few seconds, I blurted three and a half stars; startled, one friend interjected, \"Me TOO!\"  The other dining companion joked (at least I hope so) about, \"Where should we go for wonton noodle soup after this meal?\"", "author": "Mike C."}

YOND!\n\nWe went to Coqueta for lunch today, we being myself, my husband and our teenage kids. We ordered a solid number of dishes:\n\n1- Patatas chips\n2- Esp\u00e1rragos con salsa romesc\u00fa\n3- Brocoli con salsa romesc\u00fa\n4- Verduras a la catalana\n5- Pulpo \n6- Setas al ajillo\n7- Queso Manchego\n8- Patatas bravas\n\nA fact that must be known before I delve in. I grew up in Spain, M\u00e1laga to be exact. Spanish food is in my veins. I know it inside and out. I know what is customarily served in restaurants and HOW and what is must taste like.\n\nThis place? This place does NOT serve Spanish food! If ever I were to bring a fellow Spaniard to this place they would never speak to me again, insulted beyond what words can convey that I would be stupid enough to even so much as suggest that the abominations served there are Spanish food. It was THAT bad. Horrible. Bad, Disgusting. Nasty. So, SO nasty!\n\nThe portions were insanely tiny. ALL the above overpriced food together would constitute one full dinner plate's worth of food. The manchego cheese was a mere few cubes of cheese (who on earth serves Manchego in cubes?!?!?!?) with some tiny slivers of dried, pita-like bread. The patatas bravas? Meh. The pulpo, my husband informed me (and I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian) was tasteless and bland and just bad. So, SO bad. The esp\u00e1rragos, br\u00f3coli, verduras a la catalana and setas all ajillo all might as well have been the same dish. Taste? Burned. Bitter. Crunchy because it was THAT burned. Charred. Disgusting. Overly chewy. Bad. So, SO bad. Did I say disgusting? Bitter? Burned? Charred? And bad? So, SO bad? Because it bears repeating it was THAT bad!\n\nA typical Spanish restaurant will serve a nice slab of sliced French bread with butter or olive oil as something to munch on until the appetizers and the food arrive but there was no bread to be had. The patatas chips (or just plain ol' chips with some manchego on top) are NOT a Spanish dish served at restaurants! Believe it or not, we buy chips and eat them out of bags there too and don't pretend to grab some cheap ass chips, sprinkle manchego on them and call it a dish! But it was the closest thing to anything appetizing for the kids to eat and, in all honesty, was probably the ONLY thing that did not make us want to smash our heads up against a wall because THAT would be more delightful than having to take one more bite of the atrocious, charred, bitter and plain disgusting food served at Coqueta.\n\nIn the almost twenty years I have lived here in San Francisco, this is by far THE worse dining experience we have EVER had EVER, ANYWHERE! And that is baaaaad if you factor in the fact that I am well traveled and have lived abroad, in different countries for many years and, Coqueta? Worst food I have ever had ANYWHERE globally speaking. \n\nEVER.\n\nANYWHERE\n\nBecause, again, it bears repeating in case you didn't quite get it.\n\nAnd all those teeny tiny portions that barely made up one full dinner plate's worth of food? $90. Robbery if you ask me. If you are on the fence about this place, don't be any more. It is pretentious, and plain baaaad. So, SO bad. Never the f*** again!\n\nAnd PS- We are still hungry but have been left with the bonus of stomach cramps and spending most of our Sunday running to the bathroom in sheer agony! Screw you Coqueta!\n\nPPS- The service was good. The staff was lovely.", "author": "Leila R."}

I imagined unwrapping each dish with my fork and giving the best presents to my taste buds.\n\nBut the food was as disappointing as unwrapping Hooked on Phonics on Xmas morning.\n\nThe dishes were either too bland or too salty. The texture on the Octopus was great, but we couldn't taste the slightest hint of the octopus due to the overpowering saltiness. In contrast, the Razor Clams just didn't taste like anything at all lol.\n\nAnd then there were the blatant ripoffs. For $9, we got get three fancy little Croquettes a.k.a mini-Hotpockets. Their resemblance to the frozen goodies was uncanny. The Paella was $40. That equates each spoonful of the insipid rice to around $3. Highway robbery on the Embarcadero.\n\nFor our moderately filling meal, the bill ran us for around 145 McChickens. And in Coqueta's case, it was hard to argue \"Quality over Quantity\".\n\nOn the bright side, the drinks were stellar. The drinks alone would place Coqueta as a Gem of Embarcadero.

As people who have both lived in Spain, my wife and I get excited about finding the real deal on this side of the Atlantic, but Coqueta was definitely not it. \n\nThis restaurant seems to be going for modern Spanish cuisine. It's modern in that it's ridiculously overpriced (I actually mean laughably so), and the portions are general ridiculously small. It's also modern in that things are presented in a different way (like pintxos on a stick, or patatas bravas not actually in their sauce). But nothing about it is inventive, which is pretty essential to pulling off modern cuisine. \n\nThe place is Spanish in that the ideas all come from Spanish foods. I have to admit that the croquetas were actually very authentic. The rest was sort-of authentic at best. \n\nSo the food, while generally tasty (even if lacking salt at all times, which is the most inauthentic part of the restaurant), is only barely modern and barely Spanish, which is disappointing. Waaaaaay too expensive. And I had to ask for everything twice (like all 4 times I needed more water and no one noticed, or getting the check).\n\nLucky for me, I don't live in the area, so I won't be frequently reminded of that time I wasted money thinking I'd have good Spanish food.", "author": "Clayton C."}

The vibe / decor is really great. \nI've only been with small groups, and they do take reservations, but I've seen large groups here and they make it work despite the small-ish space they are working with! I've sat near the counter/bar area and you can see them put together the tapas right there. Kind of like a sushi bar!\n\n2. The food is delicious and easy to share...the perfect kind of food.\nBased on my visits, I'd say having a group of 4 would be perfect to try a wide variety of food here. Their charcuterie is a great way to kick of your meal, and everything I tried was so good. You really cannot go wrong. Loved the Gambas Negras in particular. We did get the Sunny Side Up Huevo that we ate all wrong (apparently you mix first?? nobody told us!), so if the dish isn't super straight forward, ask your waiter/waitress for a little guidance. The only thing I didn't love were the meatballs - the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste.\n\n3. Their cocktails (especially gin & tonics) are perfect and beautiful.\nThe Barca Gintonic and Galleon are both delicious. Galleon is a little more fruity than the Barca Gintonic, but both really great options. The Castro is also good if you want a tequila drink, but it is spicy!", "author": "Stephanie K."}

It was a little after 7 when were seated and Sandra notified us as soon as were able to be seated. Our server was Rachel, aside from taking our orders and giving us the check, she did minimal to serve us during our dining experience. Alex came by to check up on us periodically and so did the manager, who was the one who refilled our wine glasses since we had ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. My sister and I both shared the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (delicious), pork shoulder (a must try), albondigas (juicy deliciousness), and the paella (best I've had).

My friend ordered a drink that was SO BEAUTIFUL and the top tasted like creme brulee. It had that wonderful crunchy top. It was a feast for the eyes. the mouth, and the liver. \n\nI had all of the pinxitos except the one with anchovies. They were all pretty good but at 2.50 a pop, it was a bit much for biteful. The chorizo one was the most outstanding from the little bites.\n\nPatatas Bravas: So smokey. The exterior is so crispy and well salted. There's a dipping sauce that goes well with them and they're so adorable! Tiny little purple bites!\n\nChicken and English pea croquetas: It was like a deep fried chicken pot pie. I've had some wonderful croquetas in Spain but this was nothing like it. To me, it was a very Americanized twist.\n\nWood-grilled octopus: Yum! They were so tender and subtle. The potatoes in this dish were unfortunately shaded by the patatas bravas, but the dish had a great harmony.\n\nGrilled alb\u00f3ndigas: The duck and pork meatballs were definitely the star of the night. It was very heavy on the flavors and sauce which is fine by me! When duck is involved, you can't expect much anything else but rich savory goodness. Highly recommend this!\n\nRed kale ensalada: our attempt to make healthy decisions. Very fresh and delicious and was a nice balance to our other choices\n\nWhole grilled branzino: THe skin was very crispy and the preserved lemons on the fish was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of eating a whole fish but this fish was great (aside the attached whole head. I know... i'm a terrible asian for not being able to handle this) \n\nOlive oil icecream sandwiches: just enough to satisfy your sweet need at the end of the meal.

Iberico Laredo over sea urchin and Jamon Iberico de Ballota. Delicious. One thing SF is dependable on is good sea urchin. One of my favorite dishes here. \n\nThe wood grilled octopus was my favorite dish. It's cut into small pieces and the increased surface area really picked up the olive oil and pimenton. Definitely my favorite. \n\nSunny side up egg and shrimp. Great presentation and fun to eat. Break the egg and mix with the shrimp and crispy potato. Runny eggs are the key to my heart\n\nGrilled albondigas. Duck and pork. Good. Heavy. Filling. I always end up with albondigas at the end of tapas and I'm always full. It's not fair to the albondigas. Nevertheless it was good. Maybe ask for it earlier\n\nNow...  About the cocktails. Championship Policy has gold in it. Seriously, an amazing visual effect. The main flavor that stands out is the Vermouth carpano antica and the smoke. Raisins at the bottom collect the gold for further visual effect. \n\nHighly recommended. I'd love to come back to try the group friendly dishes like the paella and pluma", "author": "Duy N."}

I was so excited to get to pick and chose Coqueta.  I made the reservations at Opentable.  I also got a call from someone at Coqueta confirming my reservation. \n\nWe arrive at Coqueta and the hostess leads us to the bar.  I specifically asked for a table by the window with a weeks reservations in advance and she sits me & my boss at the bar.  We see an open table for two close enough to the window and ask why we can't be seated there.  My boss seeing I was upset said the young lady asked for a table by the window and we see that table is free.  Grumpily the hostess leads us there.  Ok not a good start.\n\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful . Two separate, and very different, rooms provided a nice union -- Bar 5, a glass-enclosed terrace has an outdoor/indoor feel, with window-filled walls featuring views of the San Francisco Bay. The restaurant has an intimate feel with the wooden tables, stone walls, flickering candles with most of the tables  having a view of the kitchen.\n\nWith the glowing reviews that I read from other Yelpers I really wanted to give Coqueta an amazing review,  I can look past the hohum service if the food was good. Was my taste buds failing me while other Yelpers praised the food while I was left wanting more, not satisfied.  After having just eaten at Lolo and Esperpento and loving the tapas there I was ready to get blown away but I did not. \n\nThe Pintxos ~ one of each bite skewer of chorizo, jamon Serrano and boquerones  the bite was so small I would have thought I was serving it to a 5 year old.\n\nTattas Bravas ~ glamorized tater tots w salsa and alioli was as forgettable as my first grade teacher's name. Really can you not have been more creative than tater tots for a Michael Chiarello restaurant?\n\nRoasted Padron Peppers ~ my least favorite, the sherry vinegar drowning out the crisp pepper taste could barely even taste the jamon serrano. I was getting really sad!\n\nSmoked salmon ~ open -faced with queso fresco with truffle honey, a play on bagels and lox but the salmon was overpowered by the honey. Interesting though I liked it. It was ok not spectacular.\n\nWood-grilled octopus ~ the most interesting dish I ate at Coqueta.  Smoky, tender, charry, wonderful. I did not understand the purpose of the potatoes on the plate because they detracted from the octopus flavor and the portion was tiny even for a tapas.\n \nGrilled Iberico Secreto ~ Despite being pork, it tasted like beef, didn't stand out. For $24 I was better off ordering a steak and getting full someplace else.\n\nGambas al negro ~ lacked flavor and spice that gambas usually has, and with a measly three pieces of prawns for $14 I was really getting depressed on how this meal was turning out to be.\n\nI was too embarrassed to show how displeased I was to my boss who was clearly eager to show his appreciation for my work for the company.  Walking back to the office I asked him what he thought of the meal. He said it was ok, he expected it to be pricey for it being at The Embarcadero, but the portions were too small and he has had exactly the same types of dishes in other tapas places that tasted way better than what we ordered and had bigger \"tapas portions.\"   \n\nWell that sums it up.  So I hope no one thinks I was being snooty for giving this place only two stars. I would like to remember Michael Chiarello for Bottega in Napa which is amazing and not for this one.", "author": "Maria M."}

We tried (and failed) for months to get a Dinner reservation on the one or two weekends a month that I am off, so we made a Lunch one instead. Normally I'm not a Lunch person, seeing as it's usually just a watered down version of Dinner, we settled because the Lunch and Dinner menus were very similar, and we wouldn't be missing out. \n\nWe got a pretty good selection. we ordered two sets of Pintxos, the whole grilled Branzino, a charcuterie plate, meatballs, calamri, and two cocktails and desserts. Overall, the most memorable items were the manchego and the branzino. The branzino stayed with us for so long, we ordered a whole grilled branzino at Chef Chiarello's other restaurant, Bottega a year later. Just as good as we remembered. \n\nNow that the hype has died down and getting reservations aren't impossible anymore, I would definitely come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-12", "description": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in SF because of how nicely put together everything is - the atmosphere and food. \n\nRestaurants like this convince me that tapas is the best style of dinner there is. The atmosphere is lively with background music, has a nice view of the pier, and has a bougie sense of decor.  Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion (or a casual dinner too if you're like me and food is your life). \n\nI came with a friend and ordered 7 items - here's what we got:\n-*Gin and Tonic (Galleon) - tastes like strawberry lemonade. Not the most beautiful drink here, but great to get if you're not a fan of the taste of alcohol. \n-**Ensalada de Kale - a great way to start the dinner. The kale is prepared in multiple ways so there's contrast in texture but is pretty acidic and a definitely readies your palate for dishes to come!\n-Patatas Bravas - Smoky and lightly crisp potatoes. They're nice to look at and fun to eat!\n-***Pulpo a la Parilla (Octopus) - My favorite of the night. The most flavorful, tender, and meaty octopus I've ever had!\n-*Pulma (Pork) - I've never had pork that was serve med-rare and it was fantastic! Made me think of a Spanish version of Char Siu or Cantonese roast pork. Do yourself a favor and give in to your temptations by eating the pieces whole - it's so much more satisfying.\n-Setas al ajillo (Mushrooms) - garlicky mushrooms that were slightly bitter. Was a good side dish to the pork, but could do without.\n-Crema Catalana al Fuego y Hielo (Crema Catalana that's SET ON FIRE) - very pretty and it's a bit of a show to see it on fire (great if you're trying to impress the people you're with!) but the bitterness was borderline overpowering. Get it depending on your tolerance for bitterness!\n\nWithout a doubt, this was one of my best dining experience in the city. Didn't try for a walk-in, but check out opentable to make reservations if you're coming here! All in all, it came out to about $75/person. \n\nCoqueta is a verb in Spanish that translates to: to behave amorously without serious intent (AKA a flirt).

I am so glad we stumbled across this place because our experience was excellent.  I loved the interior.  It was very rustic but hip and modern - something I would expect from SF.  We did not have a reservation and the restaurant was a tad crowded, so we decided to just take seats at the bar.  First off, the drinks were absolutely phenomenal.  Both of the drinks we ordered were so artfully crafted, the flavors were bursting in my mouth.  The food also did not disappoint. We had read no reviews or had heard of this place before we spotted it along the pier. Having no clue on what to order, the waitress asked us about our tastes and recommended some plates.  Because it was tapas, we ordered 5 dishes to share between the two of us (also boyfriend's stomach capacity has no limit).  \n\nOur favorites were the salmon ahumado, the \"sunny side-up\" huevo with shrimp and the Lubina a la Brasa which was a whole grilled Branzino fish.  Their prep and display of food was also very interesting and artistic. Our dishes were placed on wood plate slabs with newspaper cutouts and cast iron skillets.  I'm a sucker for those small touches that make a place unique and special! These details added to the rustic but new age feel of the restaurant.  \n\nAs for the food, the egg was perfect as well as the shrimp and the fish was tender and cooked just right.  The open faced salmon ahumado was so smooth and creamy with a perfect bread crunch! We were sad that were only two per order. \n\nThe servers were very diligent, quick and knowledgeable as well as friendly.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those wanting to try a place in SF with some flare and character.  \n\nAmbiance: 5/5\nFood: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nOverall experience: 5/5 We had a lovely dinner night out in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-30", "description": "Oh. My. God. wow wow wow . . . I cannot rave enough about this place. It's hands down the best Spanish food I've ever had (though I've not been to Spain yet :-(  Incredibly polished, sophisticated meticulously cooked dishes. We don't drink but ordered the non-alcoholic lemonade, only because it had rosemary. Yes, that's what I said: 'rosemary' as in the fresh sprig of green + fresh blueberries. I'm not a huge beverage person, I mainly drink only water, but was intrigued by the description of rosemary. It lived up to the description, and was fantastic. The water, btw, is served in brass cups with steel insides, reminiscent of villages in Asia and Europe, and with the rustic yet polished cutlery, I had to take a photo. We started with the boquerones (anchovy), which so simple in theory, just a little skewer with green olive, pepper bit, and Spanish white anchovy--but an explosion of flavor, with the taste lingering. And then the Octopus with fingerling potatoes, smoky and charred, tons of textures and a rounded complexity on my tongue. I'm about to describe their kale salad, and I almost hesitate because there's just no way for me to do justice to it with words. When I initially told my husband that I wanted to order it, he demurred a bit, because after all, it's kale, right? Not to mention we have salad every single night. And I could see him thinking, \"Did we drive to S.F. to eat a heap of kale?\" But I said, \"Look at the menu description, it looks like there's a lot going on in it.\" So the salad arrives, and we both dig a fork into it. We unanimously declared it to be hands down the best kale salad we've ever eaten--and I pretty much force feed my husband salad year round, kale included--lacinato included. It's seems absurd to get this excited about kale but I kid you not: this was a revelation--with kumquats, and steamed garbanzo beans, a tangy earthy dressing, with tiny bits of flash fried kale \"chips\" as garnish . . . the flavors kept coming and coming, every forkful was somehow bold and different; normally I don't like sweetness in a dressing, and though this was technically \"sweet,\" it managed to have just a hint of sweet, a welcome mat for the palate, an introduction of sweet to the ensuing tang of kumquat and earthiness of garbanzo. It balanced out the salty of the dressing and the intrinsic bitterness of the kale leaves. It was bite after bite of the perfect mix of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty to make it more than the sum of each of these four parts. Yes, I know they call it umami--but let me go out on a limb and say it was more than this--this kale salad merits a place in the pantheon of flavors :-) I told my husband, \"Next time we come here, I'm gonna get a kale salad all to myself and build my entire meal around it.\" We got the deviled eggs, which as hackneyed as it sounds, it's worth ordering--a piquancy is different and unique, not your typical devil :-) Than of course, how could we not have their Paella? Stuffed full of humungous buttery prawns, clams, chorizo with a bite, tender spears of asparagus, snap peas that actually snapped with freshness, mustard florets . . . and heaven knows what else they managed to put in there, for a virtual symphony in skillet. The rice stuck to the edges, for that perfect charred bit where you must scrape it off and (if you don't give a crap about table manners, which I don't), lick fingers. It's a bit on the salty side, which I love and the lemon aioli  is the perfect finishing touch. My husband didn't go for the aioli and instead, loved the little peppers they gave with it. It's also gorgeous to look at, prompting me to take a photo. Do you think we had enough? Not! We had the manchego cheese bite size cheesecake with caramel popcorn and churros with drinking chocolate, which comes with a crushed intensely flavored berry powder--holy goodness, I loooved it, because who would've thought that dipping a churro into a tangy berry powder and then dunking it into dark hot drinking chocolate--this is yet another example of opposing flavors, e.g. sweet, tangy and tart, savory--all seamlessly blend together and play off each other, almost like jazz musicians spontaneously riff of each other. There's lots of terrific little Spanish places in S.F., and I like almost all of them, but the food here was an experience of a different caliber, hitting high notes all over the place. I wish only that the acoustics were better, because it's deafening, brick and hard ceilings everywhere, but that seems to be de rigueur these days :-( The service was warm, welcoming, professional, responsive. What a welcome place in the city, and how lucky we are to have at it :-) I cannot wait to go back.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

Reservations were hard to come by, thus we snagged an early 5:00 pm dinner. \n\nDinner started with complimentary sparkling water (my favorite!) and an offering of pintxos or bite-size skewers. I tried the house cured boquerones with white anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guindilla peppers. It was full of flavor and set the tone for an amazing meal. We shared everything family-style with the following:\n\nChicken and English peas croquetas - these were wonderful and rich. They reminded me of fancy jalapeno poppers. The cured cara-cara orange was a nice contrast in flavor and as a palette cleanser. \n\nGambas al negro - great flavor from the gulf prawns and masterfully done with the black garlic and chili.\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing - probably my favorite dish of the night. Everything blended well together. It was very reminiscent of a Spanish-style breakfast. \n\nGrilled beef shortribs - this was my least favorite dish. The ribs were nothing special. They tasted texturally like Korean shortribs, but lacked the flavor. The glaze, pomegranate, and seville orange didn't add anything.\n\nPaella - this was the star entree of dinner. Made to be shared for two, there was easily enough to split amongst a party of three. If you like crispy bomba rice and seafood, this is the best.\n\nFor dessert, we opted to try the warm pimenton chocolate cake and the churros.  I really liked the churros servied with raspberry powder and chocolate sauce. It was excellent with a cup of Four Barrel french-pressed coffee. \n\nCoqueta was a joy to dine in. It's the perfect location for a nice date or a special occasion. They have a seasonal menu so I'm definitely excited to see some of the new offerings when spring or summer rolls around!", "author": "Bailey Z."}

You get one bite of everything they have in the restaurant. You can ask for more but with so many things to try you don't get a chance to or have the space in the tummy. There were some exotic seafood and good desert. Make sure you order a 2nd plate of what you like because you may leave hungry or wanting more. The key here is to enjoy every bite and feel the taste rather than just eating a big plate of one thing.", "author": "Mu H."}

I froze up and nearly keeled over when I met him, not once BUT three times. Then, there was Ryan Scott. He was taking my order at his food truck when I got tongue tied and blurted something that wasn't even on the menu. When I went to his pop-up restaurant, I sat there mesmerized. Like a Kelly Kapowski-Jeff crush, I had a silly grin on my face while batting my lashes the entire time during brunch as he sat at the table next to us. \n\nAnd, then there's Michael Chiarello. I grew up watching him along with Yan Can Cook on PBS and followed him on the Food Network while rooting for him on Top Chef Masters and The Next Iron Chef. He's like the Richard Gere in the foodie world with a charismatic personality that's super lovable. So naturally, when I read he was opening a new restaurant in SF, I JUST had to go.\n\nAlthough Chef Chiarello specializes in Italian influenced Californian cuisine, his new baby, Coqueta focuses on Basque cuisine (Spanish tapas). Considering it's located in a prime real estate location, expect prices to be high because you're paying for the ambiance and the waterfront view after all. The menu is quite extensive with small bites, cold tapas, hot tapas, and larger family style plates: http://www.scribd.com/doc/136022919/Coqueta-Final-Opening-Menu. Two to three dishes per a person is recommended but portions are small so if you have a large appetite, definitely skip the skewers and open faced sandwiches (they can easily rack up $$$) and get a rice or pasta dish as a filler.   \n\nThere was some mixed reviews so we were conservative with our order. I'm glad we didn't over-order as we usually do because the food was good but not as spectacular as Lolinda and Contigo (my two favorite higher end tapas restaurants in SF). I expected a bit more from Chef Chiarello in terms of flavor and execution but the creative menu, presentation, amazing cocktails and impeccable service more than made up for it.\n\nC O C K T A I L S:\nHats off to the mixologist for making AHHHH-MAZING cocktails. I started off with the Tariff Cocktail ($12) made with jamon iberico infused gin which had a delicious smokiness: http://bit.ly/13kNED8. But the remarkable Barca GinTonic ($12) is what will bring me back to Coqueta: http://bit.ly/ZCb3vM. Who would have thought something as simple as gin, tonic, and grapefruit would be so ahhh-mazing? Seriously, it was one of the best and most simple cocktails I've ever had. \n\nF O O D \n*Chorizo & Grilled Artichoke Skewers ($2.50 each): http://bit.ly/17rOjmv\n*Smoked Salmon Open Faced Sammie w/ Queso Fresco & Truffle Honey ($5): http://bit.ly/Z62duu\n*Chicken & English Pea Croquettes ($9): http://bit.ly/XTnwAH\n*Wood-Grilled Octopus w/ Fingerling Potatoes ($12): http://bit.ly/13kHmU2\n*Vineyard Greens w/ Golden Raisins & Pine Nuts ($6): http://bit.ly/15iqwsx\n*Pluma: Pork Shoulder Loin w/ a Honey-Chile Glaze ($38): http://bit.ly/11D42yn\n*Sangria Popsicle w/ Pop Rocks ($4): http://bit.ly/15iqHnV\n*Manchego Cheesecake Pops w/ Caramel Corn (two pops - $4): http://bit.ly/ZC0qsA\n\nThe best dishes of the night were the chicken & english pea croquettes and the pluma: pork shoulder loin. The croquettes which were like fried pieces of chicken pot pie; super mouthwatering with a decadent creaminess. As one of my favorite cuts of meat, the pork shoulder was rich, fatty, and full of intense porkiness. I absolutely adored the glass honey jar it was presented with. The vineyard greens were a good dose of fiber with a lovely sweetness from the raisins and the nutty crunch from the pine nuts. The chorizo was like cold salami chunks and the too smoky octopus needed a citrus punch so skip these. And, while the smoked salmon open faced sammie was delectable, $5 was excessive for an amuse bouche sized sammie. Dessert was wildly creative. The sangria popsicle with nostalgic pop rocks definitely won me over the too pungent manchego cheesecake pops.  \n\nS E R V I C E\nMichelin-star quality service, the genuinely warm staff are well-seasoned and run a tight ship. You would have never known that last night was only their fourth opening night. Special shout-out to our waiter, Kyle. He was super personable, down-to-earth, and attentive. He knew that menu like the back of his hand and even went as far as explaining some of the ingredients. Very impressive. Restaurant Stakeout's Willie Degel would be proud.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nHigh ceilings, rich woods, and an open kitchen makes this one warm and inviting restaurant. With a choice of counter seating, dining room seating, and an enclosed outdoor patio, definitely ask for a table near the window to bask in that waterfront view.  \n\nP A R K I N G\nParking meters are enforced until 11 pm. \n\nThankfully, the delightful hostess sat us at a window table with a picturesque view. Otherwise, there's no telling what CelebrityChefStarStruck Cherylynn would have done...especially after 'em ahhh-mazing cocktails.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-22", "description": "I was ready to be all jaded about Michael Chiarello's new waterfront restaurant since it is an intensely tourist-centric location run by a Food Network celebrity chef who sells his own set of cookware. Need I say more. However, my cynicism was tempered somewhat by a distant memory of a fine meal I had at Tra Vigne soon after he opened that restaurant in Napa back in the late 1980's. Now I've never been to Bottega, and with so many dining options in Yountville, it never hit my must-try list. But the buzz around Coqueta, his first foray into Spanish cuisine, piqued my curiosity enough for me to see if a reservation could be secured at the last minute on Friday. \n\nSure enough, there was one at 5:30, so I grabbed it even if it meant Jamie W. and I had to hustle our butts out of work to get there on time. I'm familiar with the high-ceiling space since Lafitte served my favorite Pimm's Cup in the city, no small feat and alas only the Pimm's 74 at RN74 is left to salve my wounded liver. The decor doesn't look hugely different, but the heavy wood tables and colorful Fiesta ware definitely felt Madrile\u00f1o to me (photo: http://bit.ly/ZInaY5). The menu of small and large bites was still on a folded piece of paper and included their cocktails as well (7 photos starting with: http://bit.ly/13rgn9m). Waiting for Jamie, I wasted no time in ordering the $12 Engine Co. #5 (photo: http://bit.ly/121Tw3Z).\n\nIt was a smooth mix of Dancing Pines Bourbon, Tobacco-Infused Sherry, Lemon and Zurracapote (a sangria-like drink). Refreshing and gone so quickly as the weather is starting to warm finally. I was convinced by a passing server to try a trio of the Pintxos at $2.50 a pop. After all, she was carrying a plank with all of the different selections organized like little soldiers with their sabers bolted into the wood (photo: http://bit.ly/XQxMaR). I chose the Quail's Egg 'Diablo' with Pickled Mustard Seed and Jam\u00f3n Serrano, the Chorizo with Roasted Artichoke and Piquillo Peppers, and the Jam\u00f3n Serrano with Mancheco and Apricot-Sherry Conserva (photo: http://bit.ly/15yzu5c).\n\nThey were delicious but almost too quick to appreciate the creation behind them. Also on the small side was the $5 Smoked Salmon Montadito with Queso Fresco and Truffle Honey (see photo). It was really a glamorously Catalan version of a bagel with cream cheese, and my only regret is that it wasn't a bigger nosh. The $8 \"Tattas\" Bravas were upscale tater tots made all the more alluring with Jam\u00f3n and Bravas Salsa and Aioli (photo: http://bit.ly/15yzRNd). They simply melted in our mouths with little effort. The $12 Wood-Grilled Octopus was succulent with just the right amount of char as the pieces were accompanied by Fingerling Potatoes, Piment\u00f3n and Olive Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/ZDdq5l). Octopus has never tasted so savory good, and the main events had yet to arrive.\n\nThe $22 Arroz Cremosa was a wondrously luxuriant risotto with Slow Cooked Bomba Rice and Day Boat Scallops that were meltably tender accompanied by English peas (photo: http://bit.ly/ZImRMO). But the centerpiece of the evening was the $38 Pluma, incredibly tender slices of Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota Pork Shoulder Loin which you drizzle with the Honey-Chili Glaze (photo: http://bit.ly/XQy1Tm). Even though the price was a bit mind-boggling for the portion, we wouldn't hesitate to order that dish again. What was nice was that Chiarello served it himself and told us he had to serve what is easily his favorite dish. He barely stayed to chat, but I was able to tell him I think he made the transition from Italy to Spain with ease. The $6 Catalan-Style Vineyard Greens with a Caper Raisin Puree made an excellent side dish among the excessive carnivery.\n\nI was working my way through my second cocktail, the $12 Castro, a refreshing mix of Espolon Tequila Blanco, Curacao, Fina Sherry, Fresno Pepper and Lime (photo: http://bit.ly/ZDdBOf), when we decided to share the $8 Asturian Apple Pie, a rather Viennese-looking pastry with apples sliced on top and with a canela of Cabrales Blue Cheese Ice Cream (photo: http://bit.ly/17HBHIh). Tasty sweetness, but we couldn't stop there as there were $4 Dessert Bites to try. There was the Pan con Chocolate, a self-described ice cream sandwich drizzled in olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/XQye99), and a pair of the Sangria Pop-Rocksicles, push-up pops topped with a sweetened crumble (photo: http://bit.ly/Zg6ywi). It was a mostly exquisite series of plates well worth a try.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...creative, authentic and rather pricey takes on tapas with the pluma the platinum standout (photo: http://bit.ly/17RtRyA) \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still the same cavernous look of Lafitte with the loud bar tent but with even more tables to satisfy the masses\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...quite terrific and accommodating\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Chiarello strikes gold in Spain and should stick around", "author": "Ed U."}

We ordered grilled octopus, pimientos padr\u00f3n, chicken croquettes, potatoes, mejillones and paella (and drinks).  The paella, as featured in the menu, is for 2-3 people.  But there is a catch.  It's only good for 2-3 people IF each person also orders 2-3 tapas dishes as well.  So yes, people, do the math.\n\nWe were also asked to move out of the dining room so that the servers prepare for the dining crowd (past 5 PM already).  Their website and Open Table don't disclose closure times between services, to we were taken aback, specially since we were celebrating a birthday.\n\nThe first time we came here it was lovely, exciting.  I was pretty underwhelmed by this last visit.  I would recommend going to B44, excellent paella (and generous servings of it), as well as quality crafted food.", "author": "Carolina Q."}

I am sometimes weary of these restaurants conceived by celebrity chefs, but Mr. Chiarello has a grand-slam on his hands. It's also worth a quick note to say that my friend and I were simultaneously attempting to get a res. I called. They had nothing. She looked on Open Table and there were PLENTY of tables. What the heck?\n\nThe atmosphere transported me to some places I remember in Barcelona. It's fairly cramped, but you're not going to feel it once your dishes and cocktails begin arriving. The house was packed, but the staff was able to deliver pretty consistent service. I appreciate how they did not hurry us so our table could be turned over. \n\nEvery single cocktail we had (and there were several) were absolute smash hits. The gintonics are ethereal, especially if you dig gin. They're almost too pretty to drink. The grey salt margarita was exquisite as was The Castro. I'd come here just to drink. \n\nWhile I cannot recall everything we ordered (it was a lot), we loved every single thing we ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-17", "description": "This restaurant was high on my list to try after a Spaniard recommended it to me. He said it was the closest flavors to what he experiences in Spain. He lives in Barcelona six months out of the year. My wife and I visited Spain about 17 months ago and fell in love with the people as well as the food. I also cook Spanish food and paella is one of my specialties. With that being said, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I brought my wife and my mom on this special trip. We arrived 16 April on a Saturday shortly after they opened at 11:30am. We didn't have reservations so they sat us in the bar, which is where we usually prefer to sit anyway. The first thing we noticed was the infestation of flies flying overhead. I mean there must have been close to a couple dozen flying in a group. My mother had a hard time getting up on the bar stool and with the flies near us we decided to sit outside on the bench and picnic table where not a single fly bothered us. I immediately ordered the seafood paella since I knew this would take some time to cook. We also ordered one each of white wine and red wine Sangrias. Both were excellent, but the white was my favorite. We started with El Plat Cap a Chef's selection of cured meats. It consisted of house cured chorizo, fu\u00e9t, and Jam\u00f3n Serrano. First of all the portions were minuscule. For $26 I expected a little more on the platter. The slightly larger than a match stick sized and rectangular shaped salami was underwhelming. The chorizo had little flavor, was not bad, but no wow factor. The Jam\u00f3n Serrano was also underwhelming. All three lacked saltiness and more fat content. Next we ordered hot tapas. Patatas Bravas: very good with hints of smokiness and flash fried crisp served with Bravas salsa and garlic aioli, Pulpo a la Parilla: Wood grilled Mediterranean octopus served with fingerling potatoes and piment\u00f3n olive oil which was cooked perfectly. Although we weren't served a single tentacle, which is my favorite part of the octopus, but what was served was very good. Our last tapas was Alb\u00f3ndigas a la feria, duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry Tempranillo salsa and crispy shallot. These were slightly sweet, tart, tender, and moist. Good, but no wow factor here either. Lastly our paella was served. This was probably our biggest disappointment. I am use to saffron in my paella, which is synonymous with paella. Not a hint was detected. Not enough seafood broth was used either. First of all I couldn't detect any flavors of seafood. The paella had primarily tomato based flavors instead. As a result of not enough broth being used. the paella was dry. The clams were cooked nicely, but the shrimp was kind of mushy in texture, not firm. The house cured chorizo lacked flavor and probably did not belong in this dish. It provided a waxy tasteless texture. For $45 this was a huge failure. I had Mexican (Spanish) rice in a Mexican restaurant more flavorful than this. For $164 total bill including  a $20 tip, I am very disappointed.", "author": "Victor H."}

Service was fast and attentive, I think because we went on a Saturday right when it opened for lunch (we had come from the Ferry Plaza farmer's market) at 11:30am. \n\n\nWhat we GOT AND ENJOYED: \n- Sunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potatoes, and chorizo sauce (really tasty eaten with all components and extra pop of flavor with the pine nuts; shrimp was cooked perfectly)\n- Grilled Albondigas (duck and pork meatballs) with tempranillo & cherry puree & shallots\n- Olive Oil Poached Salmon Salad (simple, clean, stands on its own)\n\nWhat else we got but was...MEH:\n- chicken & pea croquetas (we didn't think this was absolutely amazing with the flavor, but the texture of the crispy outside with the creamy inside was nice)\n\nDRINKS:\n- barca gintonic: very pretty to look at...but for $12? Not sure if it's worth getting again.\n- limonada (roasted sparkling lemonade with rosemary and seasonal fruit--blueberries): my sister and I love this non-alcoholic \"soft libation\". Very refreshing.\n\nWe all agree we would definitely come back to try more things on their menu...we were just there for a bite to eat because we had snacked on so many things throughout our morning at the farmer's market.\n\nAll in all, good enough to get me to come back to try more!\n\nSERVICE:\nVery good. Our waiter was very attentive to us, the runners got our empty plates out of the way when needed, and filled our glasses with water without having to ask or wait for us to run our glasses dry. \n\nCompared to other reviews about service, I think the reason why we had a good dining experience is because we were one of first parties to walk in the door when it opened, so it was definitely less busy than I would expect for a dinner or normal lunch time.", "author": "Shannon N."}

You just can't go wrong at coqueta. \n\nLets start out with drinks, they have 4 versions of their Gin and Tonic. You can't go wrong with any of them. They're both good looking and delicious -- A perfect instagram moment :P \n\nI'd love to come to coqueta with a small group of 2-3 friends. Each of their tapas com with 2-3 bites which doesn't get very sharable with a larger group. The most recent time I visited, I came with one of my girl friends. The table next to us got the steak which is a 32oz bone-in ribeye meant to serve 3-4. It looked amazing and we were ambitious so we ordered that preparing to take some home. We also ordered the egg bites, the coqueta, the jumbo prawn, and uni open-face sandwich. I loved all of our tapas and I'm not even a huge fan of prawns! (Oh, I guess with the exception of the egg-- the egg was just okay. I wouldn't order it again) \n\nNow for the steak, that steak was amazing! Super juicy and fatty and perfectly seasoned. The only surprise was that it was actually quite small. If we ordered the steak alone, it probably wouldn't have filled the 2 of us up. :( I'd definitely recommend the steak, it definitely also on the pricier side at $84 pre tip and tax. \n\nFinally for dessert, we ordered the chocolate lava cake. I can't eat much chocolate since I'm slightly allergic but I had parts of the crust with the milky sauce. I would recommend it if you like chocolate lava cakes :) \n\nCoqueta can definitely get pricey pretty quickly if you have a big appetite and love a variety.

Maybe it's the combination of exceedingly small portions and typically high prices, but I have never been a fan and usually try to weasel out of social engagements at tapas spots.\n\nI now realize that my lack of excitement over tapas was actually due to the fact that I had not experienced the \"right\" tapas place...that is until now!\n\nWe had the pleasure of dining at Michael Chiarello's Coqueta on a beautiful sunny SF Saturday.  Despite the hundreds of cars circling the Embarcadero, I scored primo parking right across the street from Pier 5...I should of known that this was a sign of good things to come.  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated to our reserved table.  The actual restaurant space is modern, stylish and airy.  The adjoining bar area is particularly cool with its breathtaking views of the Bay. \n\nWe started things off with some drinks.  I had the Almond Joy which was a very tasty sans-alcohol concoction of almond, honey, fig and tonic.  My better half had a latte made with Four Barrel.  For an app, we opened with the cheese platter which featured 3 different cheeses, jam, almonds and bread.  This was quite good.\n\nFor tapas, we tried the Mar Y Montana (Sea Urchin Toast), Crispy Shrimp quesadilla, Croquettes, Duck & Pork meatballs and the Sunny Side Up Egg.  Every single dish was perfectly prepared and delicious.  If I had to pick one highlight, the Sunny Side Up Egg's artful combination of rich flavors with contrasting soft/crunchy textures made this the craze amaze dish of our meal.\n\nFor desserts, we went with the cheesecake and the sangria poprocksicle.  Of the two, I would recommend trying the sangria pop.  On a hot day, this is refreshingly unique.\n\nCoqueta has single-handedly changed my take on tapas and for this I am grateful :)  We will definitely plan on coming back for more.", "author": "Justin L."}

I chose this restaurant due to the proximity to the Bay Bride Light Show and the Pier for an evening walk afterwards. However, I found the experience below average. I had made reservations and we arrived early only to find out that our seats had been given away and we were given the option to wait for a table or sit at the bar. Because we had been sight-seeing all day and were tired and hungry (and it was late- 9:30PM) we chose to just grab a seat at the bar. The restaurant itself was packed and bustling. Tables were crammed together and it seems like a hot Friday night spot. I chose a pinot noir which was terrible. I rarely ever ask for an exchange but I simply could not down this wine. I switched to a merlot which was fine. The food came out quickly and was just average. I will say that despite it being crowded and having to navigate through the throngs of people everywhere waiting to be seated, our server was exceptionally pleasant.

We ate at the bar, wanting a more informal setting, and it was quite nice (albeit a small area). The only thing is to remember that you ARE ordering tapas, so no looks of disappointment when the things you order aren't served as mountains of food.\n\nWe started with the baby beets with watercress, vinagreta, some chopped nuts, and a dusting of bleu cheese. Presentation-wise, absolutely gorgeous. The beets were flavorful and cooked to perfection, and it was a delight to eat the dish (leaving us wanting more, really).\n\nAfter that, we wanted the AMAZING sounding Mar y Montana, but of course, they weren't serving it that day, so we settled for the pan con tomate with crispy bread and tomato fresco - very refreshing, and definitely worth trying for its simple deliciousness.\n\nNext were the tattas bravas (one of my favorites) - crispy potato and jamon nuggets with an aioil - yet another dish leaving you wishing there was more, each succulent potato was topped with a drop of a creamy white sauce, and ready to be dipped in the creamy orange sauce in the center of the plate.\n\nFinally, we had the wood-grilled octopus, with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, and olive oil. It came beautifully presented, everything was still warm, and it was fun stabbing up little delicious bites with the elongated toothpicks provided.\n\nAll in all, a delicious, light meal, at a location I would most certainly return to.

Service was overall pretty prompt. \nMy husband and I dined here for our second anniversary and I was hoping as the location is on the water that we would get some romantic setting which we really didn't. There weren't very many seats to be had that had window views at all. The atmosphere is trendy but the tall ceilings made it very loud.\nI husband ordered the Mojito which was nothing like a typical Mojito in all the best ways imaginable.i had the brut bubbly which was perfect.\nOnce we were seated over 40 minutes late when we had a reservation we were crammed into a very tiny space. The table was centered so that the person seating along the fabric benched side of the table was seating in the crack. The waitress did help us move the table but there were only about 4 inches to move it. The sitting part of my dining experience wasn't lovely :/\n\nOur dinner began with the fuet which was fantastic.\nWe next received the Ensalada de Achicoria & Coliflor con Romescu- they were both good but the cauliflower dish was definitely our favorite. If I were dining there again I would probably only order the cauliflower dish.\nAt coqueta they bring around small bite-size bites on Toothpicks called and pintxos.  We were only able to try to of them and one was decent the other was horrible.\n\nOne of the Pintxos- Tortilla de Espinacas - i'm so glad they only had 1left it was disgusting I wish Ihadn't taken a single bite\n\n\nThe Jamn  serano pinto- manchego & apricot- sherry conserva- pretty good\n\nNext we were brought the octopus which had been recommended to us- I'm so glad it was! One of the best octopus I've ever had. \n\nDuck & pork meatballs- they were a little sweet/ my favorite dish of the evening \nOur last item of the meal was the Lubina a la Brasa which is served with the head & with a large wedge of grilled lemon, flake salt, & a green olive & preserved Meyer lemon salsa on the side with a little salsa on top. I I understand this concept however I felt like we were doing a lot of the dishes work by seasoning it. I understand that sometimes people like to season it to their own tasting but it actually got a little messy and I really would have preferred for the kitchen to season our fish. This was my husband's favorite dish of the night I wished we had stopped at the meatballs. \nWe chose churros for dessert & they were pretty good but not the best I've ever had. The berry powder was a nice touch.\nOverall, I'm giving them 3 out of 5 stars due to our wait on a Wednesday night, the noisy environment and the fact that all not all of their dishes were 100% spot on.

The restaurant is located on the Embarcadero with some partial views of the bay. The dining room is a lot more cozy and intimate than I thought it would be which gave a warm, comforting ambiance. \n\nWe ordered a carafe of sangria which was delicious and refreshing; bonus points for it being served in an awesome looking vessel. I was eyeballing the gin and tonics our neighbors were sipping on as they looked quite interesting with lots of floral components thrown in. If I ever get the chance to come back here, I'm probably getting one of those. We each got some of the bitesize skewers that they brought around. I got the quail egg diablo, chorizo and artichoke, and the serrano ham and cheese. I would advise to skip these as I didn't think any of them were particularly impressive and overpriced in my opinion at $2.50 a pop. I did appreciate the concept of the small bites and the beautiful platter on which they were presented and served.\n\nWe ordered 3 small dishes and a paella. The grilled razor clams were a special that day. I think this was the first time I've had razor clams; they were quite tender and the sauce added some nice acidity.  The sunny side up huevo with shrimp was probably my favorite dish; the crispy potato strings gave the dish great texture and the chorizo dressing added some good heat. Next up, were the grilled duck and pork meatballs were solid and had great texture and flavor. Then came the paella which was quite massive, it probably could've fed a family of four. The flavors were excellent but I thought the rice ratio was a bit high compared to the proteins and veggies. If you know you're planning on getting this dish, order it first as it takes around 30-40 minutes for it to come out.\n\nWe capped things off with a decadent flan, they added a chocolate birthday card on the top of it for the birthday girl. This was the first restaurant of Michael Chiarello that I have dined at. I've heard good things about his restaurant in Napa but I thought this one fell a bit short.

The food was not really to my taste, but I recognize that it was interesting and probably pretty good.  I think they overused the sweet in the sweet and savory combinations, but I think I'm in the minority there.

Just note that the yelp photos make the food items look A LOT bigger than it is. \n\nWe had reservations for 2 and was seated on time, although, service was slow. It was expected because it was about 6PM on a friday night, but still, it took like 10-15 minutes till we were even greeted by our waitress and another 10-15 minutes to get us water. \n\nThe food was delicious, I recommend the Pluma (Pork shoulder loin). It was amazing. There were these red stripes of chili or something that you would put on the pieces of pork and it would add a spicy crunch to the meat, heavenly. The other dish I really enjoyed was the duck and pork meatballs. \n\nI could recommend that you go with a larger group, at least 6 people, then you can take advantage and get the larger dishes like the beef rib eye and the paella.", "author": "Allen C."}

For me, the high point of the meal. The gambas al negro (poached whole prawns) were delicious. \n\nEverything else we ordered - the patatas bravas, the padron peppers, some pinxtos, arroz cremoso, churros, two drinks -- were just okay. Nothing was bad.\n\nSo why the 83%? The arroz cremoso (saffron bomba rice) was under seasoned. The pinxtos (mini skewers) didn't have much flavor. The portions were particularly small, even for tapas. The bill for 2 was $100+ not including tip.\n\nThe restaurant and the bar are situated on a beautiful strip of the embarcadero.  The decor, the place settings and dining room are well chosen for the theme of the restaurant. Ambience on a weekday afternoon (first seating with a reservation), is bustling but not rushed or suffocating. \n\nI'd come again, but wouldn't go out of my way unless they switched up the menu.", "author": "Kay C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-09", "description": "If you want to sit at a real table, make a reservation ahead of time! Honestly, I have never had tapas before, and I had no idea what to expect. Also, I must note that I have never had a gin and tonic before - weirdly enough - and the Bar\u00e7a gin and tonic was so amazing!!! I will forever have a high bar for a gin and tonic for the rest of my life. (Their sangria was...okay, I guess...)\n\nSince OpenTable and the receptionist made me very aware of how there were no reservations/tables available on a Saturday, my friend and I sat at the patio. It was so tiny, and the high chair was not very good for my back -- totally our bad for wanting to eat here for weekend brunch. Anyway, tapas - small dishes, also pricey here. \n\nWe had (copying straight from the Winter 2014 menu):\n1) \"El Plat Cap\" (Chef's selection of cured meats, $26) -- this was an \"OK\" starter. Having been spoiled with amazing French charcuterie at other restaurants, I was not impressed.\n2) Patatas Xips y Salsa Aperitivo (House made smokey potato chips with shaved manchego and membrillo Vermouth vinegar, $4) -- the chips alone were delicious and had very nice textures. I did not enjoy the \"salsa\" though, as I found it too vinegar-y.\n3) Patatas Bravas (Freshly dug, lightly smoked, crispy new potatoes, bravas salsa, and garlic alioli, $8) -- I am not a big fan of potatoes (trust me, it is hard to believe, especially since I've lived in Germany), and found this to be too hot (temperature-wise) at first, but it was yummy.\n4) Gambas al negro (Olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili sauce, $14) -- OK, honestly, aside from the gin and tonic, THIS was my favourite thing!!!! It was SO flavourful and delicious. Sadly, there are only three prawns and three slices of bread, but the sauce is plentiful.\n5) Pintxos (Bite-size skewers, $2.50 each):\n5a) House cured boquerones (White anchovies, olives, pearl onions, and guindilla peppers) -- cold, but it was pretty good, a lot better than I expected.\n5b) Huevos de Codorniz (Quails egg \"Diablo\", pickled mustard seed, and jam\u00f3n Serrano) -- also cold, and was not what I expected, I preferred the other skewer I ordered.\n\nVERDICT: Maybe Spanish tapas are not for me, or the Californian touch on some of the dishes threw me off, but I was definitely not on the same page as my friend. I will say, though: the gin and tonic and prawn dishes are enough to make me want to come back. All the other foods I ordered: I could care less. Because I sat at the patio, I felt really cramped, and there was no real nice view of the waterfront.\n\nThe service here was so-so. Never connected with the server, and it was fairly slow, but, whatever, I'll just enjoy my alcohol.", "author": "Kelley L."}

They also have an amazing menu of Gin & Tonic cocktails. Im not a gin & tonic drinker, Im more of a bourbon drinker, but I still enjoy their cocktails. I have dined here before for dinner but today was the first time for brunch. They open at 11:30 am on Saturdays and I was able to make an 11:30 reservation at 11:00 am through Open Table. By 12:45pm, the entire restaurant was packed. Its also very hot inside because there are only 2 small windows that open to ventilate this restaurant. Luckily, we sat right next to these 2 windows. \n\nToday my dining experience was great but the only downfall is that they didnt have the Pork Shoulder today (and just to mention again we arrived when the restaurant opened at 11:30am). This is the second time this has happened to me so thats why Im not willing to\ngive this place a whole 5 stars. If its that popular why cant they have it?\n\nFor drinks I highly recommend the famous gin & tonic and the galleon. For food the croquetas, grilled octopus, the sunny side up, the duck & pork meatballs,  paella, and cheesecake pops. These items will not disappoint. I would recommend that pork shoulder but they probably wouldnt have it anyways. Just saying.", "author": "Sarina A."}

On a spontaneous sunny Saturday, we were walking our dog in the area and decided to stop by for a mid-day snack.\n\nSince we had a dog with us, our only option was to sit outside at one of two available communal tables.  There were tons of bussers coming and going to refill water, but our server was nowhere to be found.  It took us almost 30 minutes to find our server so we decided to order everything at once, knowing they might not be back until we were ready to pay. [minus 1 star for slow service]\n\nWhat we got:\n\nKalimotxo - Sangria mixed with coke and cinnamon that comes in a Spanish party pitcher.  The coke made it bubbly, which was a refreshing spin on the typical sangria.\n\nBite Sized Skewers - the menu says \"offered at tableside\", which we found out later, meant that they will pre-make a bunch of skewers and bring you the whole board to pick out the skewers you want.  I don't prefer it served this way, since I feel like the food isn't as fresh when it's been \"chillin\" on the board for who knows how long.  The 5 skewer options were: house cured boquerones, chorizo, jamon serrano, tortilla de espinacas, huevos de codorniz.  My favorite was  the tortilla de espinacas because the cana de cabra cheese was delicious.  \n\nSunny Side-Up Huevo - this dish BLEW MY SOCKS OFF, we were shamelessly scraping the very last bits off the plate.  The dish comes with 4 medium sized shrimps, crispy potato strings, a sunny-side egg and chorizo dressing.  The chorizo dressing, which is basically chorizo oil with crumbled chorizo, really makes the dish.   After combining the egg and the potato, the dish is spicy marriage of flavors and textures.\n\nAround 5pm, the sun was beginning to wane, and the pier suddenly got REALLY windy and cold.  My advice would be to find seating indoors if you're able to.  Overall, the food was pretty good, I wouldn't say the skewers lived up to the hype, but I'd come back for the egg dish.", "author": "Michelle W."}

I rather eat uni by itself.\n\nChicken coquette - hot cheesiness inside with thin strips of chicken was by far the best tapa of the night.\n\nI went here during the thanksgiving break and the place was still very pack. \n\nThe service was great and the waitress was very charming and friendly.

We had a ton of assorted tapas and plates that we all thoroughly enjoyed. The drinks were fantastic (took awhile to come out) and the overall vibe and setup made it a very welcoming environment. The only thing that my guests and I weren't too crazy about was our server. She seemed to start off okay. Her demeanor seemed friendly and welcoming. But as the evening progressed I was beginning to wish that we had a different server more and more. Bad service makes good food taste bad, it's as simple as that. We weren't greeted by her to begin with. Her extremely friendly and capable neighbor (awesome flamboyant guy with perfect hair) greeted us and made us feel welcome and comfortable from the beginning. But when she took over she took forever to come back to the table and take our actual food order. I understand that sometimes it's awkward to come back and take a food order when the drinks haven't come out yet and it's been a while...but if that's ever the case all you have to do is say your drinks should be out shortly but in the meantime may I get an order started for you? That's all you have to do. And throughout our experience her attitude just got worse and worse and she just dropped the pretense of caring at all and she was acting as if it was a hindrance to serve us. I never give yelp reviews less than 5 stars but in this case I feel that three is appropriate. If it had been solely based on our server (Sarah or something?) this would be a 1-2 star review. She only perked up when she dropped off the check realizing that oh yeah they have to tip me based off my SERVICE. The two other gentleman and I all work in the industry so for us tipping 15% is really not typical. But because it was so bad and affected our experience we really didn't feel that bad about it.", "author": "Jessica F."}

Unfortunately, we were running late, and although we called ahead, they had to give away our table so we had to wait another 25 minutes once we arrived at the restaurant. The worst part about having to wait for a table was that the bar area is small (slightly smaller than the restaurant side), and they also have people dining there, so there really isn't much room to sit or stand around.

I ordered their version of a gin and tonic, since it was highly recommended by our server. The drink itself was aesthetically pretty with an orchid and berries floating around in it, but it also tasted great (and this is coming from a girl that rarely drinks gin). \n\nThe first dish up, pulpo a la plancha was super tender grilled octopus with a perfect char on the outside. The pluma (pork shoulder) was up next and was paired with an order of the setas al ajillo (wild mushrooms). The pork shoulder came with these interesting chili twig-like bits for spice, but I was indifferent to the honey-chili glaze that came with it. The mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The paella came last and was legit. Loved the flavors and seafood on top. \n\nOverall, I was highly impressed with the quality of food and service at Coqueta and I have added it to my list of favorite restaurants in SF.

It is on the mild side though, so for those of you who want a strong one, this might not be for you\n\n-Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota: this is similar to a charcuterie plate. It's a good one to order to share with more people. \n\nSince it's a tapas restaurant, the portion of each dish is definitely on a smaller side, so if you have a large party, make sure you adjust your order accordingly.

Finally made it here.\n\nLike the feel of the inside of the restaurant.  Right on the water obviously, but the inside is nicely decorated.  High ceiling, comfortable and clean. Server was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.\n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nSUNNY SIDE UP EGGS WITH CHORIZO, SHRIMP AND MORE - My favorite dish, although slightly over salted. Even with the saltiness, I liked it.  If I were the chef, I would serve this dish over some seriously crispy fried rice.  It needed more starch for balance.  Would have been perfect with crispy fried rice!  Inspired to do this at home! \n\nPORK SHOULDER - Served pretty rare for pork, even though I know pork can be eaten this way, still made me a little nervous.  But it was good, and I understand that many reviews think this is the bomb, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\nENGLISH PEA RISOTTO - Nicely done.  My wife and daughter said this was their favorite, calling it \"light and refreshing\".  I thought it was good too, but again, not GREAT.\n\nWILD MUSHROOM SAUTEE - Wow.  This dish shouldn't be on the menu. Overcooked, over seasoned, over caramelized (slightly burnt).  Undersized portion.  I've done wild mushroom saut\u00e9s at home that outshine this by a mile.  That's not good news for the chef in a Michael Chiardello restaurant.\n\nCRISPY ROUND POTATOES - Nice idea.  Crispy round little potato bites.  Wish the sauce was something more.  It was neither here nor there.\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS - Decent, but nothing to ooh about.\n\nKALE SALAD - Just OK, nothing special.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the theme of this review...Just OK, nothing special.\n\nI didn't LOVE any of these dishes.  In fact the only one I *might* order again is the SUNNY SIDE UP egg dish.  \n\nIn closing, I will say the cocktail (Gin and Tonic) was very good.  Really liked the look of that drink, with this floating flower in it.  Very cool.\n\nI might come back to explore other things on the menu, but with a huge list of bookmarked restaurants, I don't think I'll be back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "KenScale: 8.0/10\n\nCoqueta is a Spanish restaurant from chef Michael Chiarello. Since its opening, it has been considered one of the best newcomers, with authentic Spanish cuisine that had North California touch. I went on a Sunday brunch and agree that Coqueta is a very solid restaurant.\n\nAny meal at Coqueta should start with pintxos, or bite-size skewers with various ingredients. I sampled all of the pintxos available, and all of them were tasty with a variety of ingredients from chorizo to anchovie to quails egg to pepper. You could tell that the North California focus on freshness of ingredients is also reflected in each bite. I proceeded to order a couple of tapas. \"Sunny side-up\" huevo with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing was a delicious dish that could work pretty well for brunch as well. I wished duck and pork meatballs were slightly less sweet, but there was nothing wrong with the absolutely crispy yellow cauliflower steak a la plancha accompanied by coal roasted romesco sauce. For the main dish, I had to try paella (serving 2-3 persons) that came with a variety of seafood, chorizo and broccolini. I was a fan of the hearty dish, with fresh shrimp and clams going very well with the bomba rice in jamon Serrano-shellfish broth. For dessert, apple pie with blue cheese ice cream, despite its intriguing combination, somewhat felt flat, but I liked the skewer of manchego cheesecake with caramel popcorn.\n\nThe restaurant, located nearby Pier 5, is a perfect place for a brunch on a nice sunny day, with a casual dining area where you can look at the open kitchen in action while also enjoying the view of the bay. I don't know how crowded the restaurant gets during dinner time, but getting a reservation for brunch wasn't too difficult. The restaurant has a full bar menu, and for brunch a glass of sangria is probably the way to go. Coqueta is definitely a worth place visiting for a taste of Spanish cuisine in the Bay Area.", "author": "Ken S."}

I have no idea what they put in their gin- flower oranges and some spices, but whatever it is it makes it amazing!!My husband tried a couple other cocktails all of which were yummy. \n\nOnce we were finally seated I was kind of disappointed, we were sitting at bar stools in the smallest table possible.

I cant remember it all but heres some of the stand outs:\n\nSalmon, honey, bread- Very tasty and a great way to start the meal.  The salmon is delicious and the cheese on the bread goes great with it.\n\nLand and Sea- Sea urchin and ham...YUM!!! I really loved this dish, again quite small portion but a great way to start out a meal.\n\nChicken croquettes- Really delicious, I cant explain it, but somehow they make chicken amazing.  You only get a few in an order though.\n\nWatermelon salad- this was quite a surprise, they put like a ham/bacon garnish on it that is totally out of this world!  I would get it again.\n\nOctopus- least favorite dish of the night, very bland\n\nBlack garlic shrimp-2nd least favorite dish of the night...this was boring and kinda gross, the sauce on here was awful.\n\npork shoulder (main entr\u00e9e)- AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, in fact, this was the third time she's treated us to Coqueta since my first review back in September. And I will also say that I'm not the only one from my team who thought things were not up to par, or at least not as good at the first time we went as a group. Something has definitely changed in the kitchen, and it's showing. \n\nBack to the matter at hand: I walked down to the restaurant around 1:30PM and my party was sitting at the middle long table in the main dining room. Our waitress was helpful and attentive, wishing me a happy birthday since my boss had told everyone of my upcoming day of birth. \n\nI had the Engine Co. #5 for my cocktail which was tart and strong, just how I like it. \n\nWe ordered three of the *El Gran Plat Cap* (assorted meats / nuts / cheeses) - this is always a good choice as there's a lot of variety and it's cured meats and great cheeses, you can't eff this up\n\n\n~Some of our Tapas~\n \n*Pimientos de Padron* - a favorite and also difficult to eff up, roasted peppers with Jamon Serrano, sherry vinegar, and coarse sea salt\n\n*Albondigas a la Feria* - meh, these duck / pork meatballs were super oniony, with crunchy onions inside and more caramelized on top. Also I got a tendon kind of texture that ruined the meatball for me, I took one bite and didn't have any more\n\n*Patatas Bravas* - ugh, I was so disappointed in the little fried potatoes both last time and this time getting them. In September they were heavenly: light and crispy. But each time since then, they've been oily and dense\n\n*Croquettes de Pollo* - another let down, and sadly so, as they were a favorite in the past. The filling of chicken and peas had a curdled texture and an overly oniony after taste and was not hot inside the breaded casings\n\n*Salmon Ahumado* - little open-faced salmon sandwiches. Sooo fishy. And way too cheesy. The Queso Fresca was piled high and the salmon was slimy and gooey with truffle honey. The bread it was served on reminded me of an old toasted Bagel Bite and was a harsh pairing for the softer ingredients matched with it\n\nWe had other Tapas too, but they were nothing to say much about, good or bad.\n\n~Our Entr\u00e9es~\n\n*Paella* - I was very excited to try this as it's a classic dish, and supposedly one of the star plates at Coqueta. Unfortunately it was not as good as it could have been, and I can honestly say that my friend's mother who has little cooking experience makes a better paella\n\n*Pluma* - I thought this was a tender and delicious pork shoulder cut, I have no complaints about it\n\nMost of our desserts were fine, my favorite is the mini churro with dipping chocolate and berry powder. I had a bite of the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream and was not enthused by the bitter, moldy taste. \n\nI hope we go again so Coqueta can get out of this slump and show us all that same great food we experienced just a few months ago.", "author": "Crystal C."}

I've been wanting to eat here because the food selection reminded me of our honeymoon in Barcelona. A last minute reservation is hard to come by, so I definitely suggest reserving more than a week in a advance.\n\nThere really wasn't anything that disappointed us, overall the food, drink, atmosphere, service, were all fantastic; the hubby and I really enjoyed ourselves. If I were to be really picky, the only thing that would probably bother me is the size of the pintxos; they were much smaller than we were expecting for $2.50 each. They were more like a nibble than a bite. I'd also like to point out that don't expect authentic spanish tapas, the dishes were definitely elevated but nonetheless very delicious.\n\nFor a about $120 we actually ate A LOT of food!\n\nWHAT WE DRANK:\nBarca Gintonic\nGlass of Red\n\nWHAT WE ATE:\nBoquerones (olives)\nPintxos: 1 Boquerones, 1 Cohrizo, 2 Huevos de Codorniz\nPan con Tomato (bread with tomato)\nHuevos Nacional (deviled eggs)\nPimientos de Padron (roasted peppers topped with jamon)\nPulpo a la Parilla (grilled octopus with potatos)\nTrio de Salchichas (grilled sausages)\nVerduras a la Catalana (greens with raisins and pine nuts)\n\nDESSERT:\nManchego Cheesecake dessert bites\n\nSo we started off with with drinks! The Barca Gintonic was definitely the highlight, it was gorgeous! It's a must have when you go there!\n\nThe hubby's highlight were the roasted peppers, they had a lot of flavor especially with the slivers of jamon on top. The octopus was nice and soft and the grilled sausages were also very flavorful; I especially enjoyed the blood sausage. Believe it or not my most favorite thing to eat were the greens, they came in a nice bown and were bitter, yet sweet; they went well with everything.\n\nNow, I'm a big coffee and dessert person but by the end of our meal we were the last ones in the restaurant and I could tell the staff were preparing to close. I got shy and didn't end up ordering dessert even though our server suggested we still could. The reason for the five stars is that she ended up bringing us dessert anyway which were the cheesecake bites! I was so delighted that I got my little dessert at the end of the meal; for free! HUGE thank you to our waitress for that!\n\nAgain, a solid great place to eat with a menu I honestly haven't experienced anywhere in the bay area. The atmosphere was eclectic and the energy was great! I'll definitely be heading back to try their bigger plates, dessert and the uni open sandwich that they were out of by the end of the night!", "author": "April B."}

You assume it's not a big deal, so you cross the street and you get a big surprise.\n\nIt's a big pot hole and your foot is wet up to past your ankle.\n\nThat's the feeling I got when a Tariff Gin Tonic was ordered for me.

Water for the rest of the evening for me.\n\nThe tapas concept is a great one; you order a lot of small plates and share.  My favorite was the Tortilla de Camaron, which is a chickpea flour pancake stuffed with pieces of shrimp.   I'll pass on the Arroz de Primavera, which I thought was supposed to be more paella and less risotto, but I was wrong.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-27", "description": "My friend, D, is tenacious.  She's charged with making reservations for an annual birthday dinner for four and once location has been decided upon she's on it like a pit bull on a turkey leg.  For dinner at Coqueta she was up at the crack of dawn to be the first to secure reservations the moment they supposedly became available.  And then.  Well.  Things didn't go as planned.  Despite more than adequate prep work, D found that there were no reservations to be had and I'm understating it when I say that she had a problem with that.  \n\nBeing resourceful and forceful D called Coqueta directly to lodge her complaint.  When a restaurant says that reservations open for a particular date on a particular date and you phone the moment those reservations supposedly open up there oughta be some reservations available.  That's essentially what she told the hostess then the manager then, I don't know, Michael Chiarello?  Anyhow, she made her point: she'd played by the rules, they had not, and we got our Saturday evening reservations for 4 as we should have without having had to take extraordinary steps.  \n\nSome might assume that such a tactic would result in a stink-eye greeting and food that's been sauced by generally inedible bodily fluids.  As far as I could discern, this didn't happen.  When we walked in the hostess greeted us with such cordial familiarity that I turned to D and asked \"Do you know her?\".  It was truly a GREETING.  Maybe word had gotten out not to mess with this party or maybe this hostess is always this enthusiastic.  Whatever; it was wonderful. \n\nMichael Chiarello restaurants are always beautiful.  It's a given.  Sometimes I've not cared as much for the food as I do for the interior (Tra Vigne), but such wasn't the case at Coqueta.  The menu was as gorgeous as the decor which was ridiculously special.  The illuminated Bay Bridge sits outside the windows, bone-in jamon sits drying on countertops (ala Barcelona), and the place just zings with energy.  Patrons here are having fun.  You can feel it in the electric air.  \n\nOur beautiful server reminded me of Project Runway winner Anya Ayoung Chee in both voice and looks.  It turns out she was from Mexico, not Trinidad, but was no less lovely as a result.  Her service was gracious and professional and helpful and warm.  What a special place.\n\nCoqueta has the type of interesting menu that makes me eager to try as many offerings as possible, making it an especially excellent place to come with a small group of people who don't mind sharing.  We'd brought our own wine (which our server helpfully decanted), but that didn't keep us from beginning with cocktails as this is something in which Coqueta specializes.  Four uniquely different offerings were chosen, all epically named, and passed around like appetizers for each of us to sample from.  Don't miss the cocktails here.\n\nWe moved onto a wide assortment of menu offerings including a variety of \"bite-sized skewers\", cold tapas, hot tapas, sliced cured meats, Iberian cheeses, and a shared paella which was the best I've ever sampled.  We had studied Michael Bauer's review in advance of our meal and ordered well, based on many of his recommendations, even avoiding the open-faced sandwiches which he'd not found too special.  \n\nWe closed out with a variety of desserts including the crazily creative \"gazpacho\" which sent dry ice skirting across the table.  A wow-moment indeed, and a creative and fun way to close out a perfect meal.  \n\nDespite a dubious reservation experience, I found Coqueta to be first class from the moment I walked in until the moment I left.  There aren't a whole lot of high-end restaurants that I'm eager to go back to.  Coqueta is one I'd return to in an instant.  Here's hoping I can land a reservation.", "author": "Tracey A."}

We didn't have reservations so we were directed to the bar area which was moderately full. After finding seats, I decided to talk to the hostess about a table in the dining room and to my surprise they were able to give us a table! \n\nAll of our dishes were tasty and nicely presented, but the highlights were:\nSalmon Ahumado - salmon was soft and smoky. That with honey and cheese was so savory.\nSunny side-up Huevo - mix the egg, shrimp, and potato crisps together for a delicious hash-like salad.\nPulpo a la Parilla - never had octopus this soft! Nice kick to it.\nCroquetas de Pollo - well made, softness was just right.\n\nDefinitely try one of the gin and tonics! They are so refreshing and aromatic you'll want to keep your nose over the glass the entire night.\n\nThe decor reminds of a cross between Napa and a lodge because of the wood accents and high ceilings. One drawback was seeing the shadows of the gnats/flies hovering above our table. Also, one of the wine bottles being used as a centerpiece had some tagging on it... wasn't tasteful to see that.

Having to wave your waiter(waitress) down everytime you need or want something probably means service can use improving.\n\nNow let's go through the dishes - \n\n1. Kale salad: First time I had it, it was DELICIOUS.  I loved the different textures of kale especially the crispy pieces (kind of like a seawead crunchy texture). Second time, it was okay.  There were only maybe two pieces of the crispy textured kale, then for some odd reason some of the fruit seasoning paste was stuck to the bottom of the bowl.  I think they may have tossed the salad (haha) incorrectly.  Kind of a bummer because we didn't get the full effect of the salad untilt he end.  Overall there's a pretty tart taste to this salad, so something to keep in mind.\n\n2. Chicken Coqueta: YUM! I looveeed this dish. It's very delicious and I would highly recommend it.\n\n3. The meat dish with the sunny side egg on top (forgot the name): This is tasty too.  I liked this one, BUT it's quite oily. \n\n4. Churros: OVERRATED.  The churros are deep fried with not enough sugar to cover it so it literally tastes like a bland deep friend batter.  The two sauces it comes with .. really? I don't get it.  One is a coffee/chocolate sauce - more bitter than sweet I would sad.  The other is a pink powdered VERY tart textured dipping thing lol.

Ambience was nice, and service was decent. Food was satisfying as a whole, but some dishes didn't seem worth the price. The bill came up to $132 excluding tip for 3 people, so it was pretty pricey.\n\nWe got: \n\n- Pulpo a la Parilla Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potato and piment\u00f3n olive oil $14 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coqueta-san-francisco?select=6Rvy0egPa9cf1ZgLKAv_Sg#8eGuADk5bTmwkGmZPdfe0Q): Best hot tapas amongst our dishes, in my opinion.

It was our girlfriend's birthday and she was moving so we wanted to have a good experience. Let me first say that I have eaten at Coqueta several other times in the past and generally it was a nice time. Good food and service was fine. \nOne of the girls arrived early and wanted to sample a few bottles of rose/sparkling wine before committing to a bottle. She tipped well and didn't intend for it to set a precedent but normally this naturally would. Below I will describe some of the bad service we experienced during our dinner.\n\n-Once everyone had arrived and we were deciding what to order we asked for some help in recommending top items as the menu housed a lot of options. Our waiter was no help and said \"everything is good\". After someone else asked a third time he then pointed out a few things. \n-We asked to try the sangria because often it is on the sweeter side and he said no its not sugary. We asked again to sample so he said \"fine\" and brought it over. It in fact was way too sweet to we didn't order and he made a face.\n-After ordering the payaya he said \"okay but you can't order anything after that. It takes a long time to prepare and I have a party after yours I need to seat.\"\n-We were chatting how some places in SF charge for every extra, such as chips and salsa. He chimed in on our convo and said yes you have to pay for bread here too.\n-They brought a dessert and it had no candle so we asked another waiter if we could get one for the occasion and he left with the desert. Our waiter came back with it and said, no we don't have any candles. \n\nWe still tipped because we aren't jerks even though our waiter was and he deserved nothing. I wish we had gotten his name but he was hispanic, shorter, has slick back longer hair and works Wednesday dinner shift in the dining room.

Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't as amazing.\n\nThe first visit...\nWe strolled in there w/no reservations around 1 PM on a wknd.  Of course we had to sit at the bar, even though there were open spots in the dining area.  OK, we get it, no reservations = no table.  Any who, we were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar, in front of the bartenders.  \n\nBartenders were super friendly and provided great suggestions.  Our meal consisted of:\n*  RED SANGRIA :: 5/5 stars, 2nd best sangria I've had (next to julian serrano's)\n\n*  BITE SIZE SKEWERS :: 3/5 stars, you only got one of each (3 total) and they were TINY!  the definitely succeeded in the bite size portion.  these are also given to VIP guests at no charge. IMHO, it should provided to all patrons as an amuse bouche.\n\n*  PATATAS BRAVAS :: 5/5 stars, crispy on the outside, yummy on the inside and garlic alioli had so much flavor.  I wanted to lick it up!\n\n*  SUNNY SIDE UP :: 5/5 party in my mouth flavor!  love the different textures and who doesn't love a perfectly cooked sunny side egg?  bartender prepared this for us.  some guest may think this dish is too salty, but it worked for me.\n\n*  PLUMA (pork shoulder loin) :: 5/5 stars, loved loved this dish!  I think I had dreams about it for several nights afterwards.  Just the right amount of salt and cooked perfectly.  It was sooooo tender!  Can't remember what the little red spicy things were (they look like longer saffron strings), surprisingly they had decent flavor and spice kick.  Glaze was a bit sweet for me, so I didn't dip again.  I tried making a reservation for the following wknd, because of this dish.... but of course i got side tracked and didn't make the reservations.\n\n\nSecond trip to Coqueta\n*  We had reservations = we had a table = yay\n-  We had to share the table with this really pretentious couple = boo\norder included:\n*  RED SANGRIA :: 3/5 stars, this time there was a funky metallic taste to it, after we were done with the pitcher we ordered a bottle of wine (can't recall which one we ordered, it wasn't memorable enough to make an effort to remember)\n\n*  ENSALADA DE KALE :: 3/5 stars, it was ok.  perhaps i was expecting too much?  my sister highly recommended it, telling me about how fresh it was and how it had crispy pieces of kale on top, etc... I didn't have any crispy kale, at least it wasn't crispy when it arrived at our table.  I also didn't prefer the cheese, too strong IMO for a salad\n\n*  SUNNY SIDE UP :: 5/5 still a party in my mouth and still salty\n\n*  PLUMA (pork shoulder loin) :: 3.5/5 stars, not even close to how good it was last time.  This time the pork was too sweet.  The waitress said they must have put too much sauce on it.  We didn't even pour any on!  Additionally, it seemed way too rare, which wasn't that big of a deal.  Pork was still tender though.\n\n*  GAUCHO BISTEC :: 4/5 stars, good but not OMG great.  It did have a good char on it... something I miss from our cooking, since we're not allowed to have grill at our place.  sorry big green egg, you will be in use again some day! Menu states it serves 4 ppl, Coqueta does reserve smaller portions but quantities are limited, ask your server for availability \n\nservice wasn't as good the second time around.\n\nhappy eating!", "author": "Tina F."}

I've been waiting to go there for the longest time, finally, my friend and I made reservations (about 10 days prior to the actual visit). We arrived on time, and were escorted to the bar. I asked, why the bar, since we had a reservation made, and the hosted told us that since the reservation was made recently (again, 10 (ten!!!) days prior to the event), all of their tables were already reserved! \nWe started with a cocktail (gin and peach with tonic) and a glass of wine. The drinks were wonderful, but this is where the \"good part\" ended...\nTapas: Shrimp - tasted too \"fishy\", octopus (too rubbery), chicken croquet (tasted like a fast food deep fried appetizer), mushrooms (was OK, nothing special, kind of fungy), cheese plate (seriously, for $16 3, only 3 kinds of cheese, totaling about 2 oz, and the cheese was nothing special as well), jamon and cheese screwer, bite size, which was ok, but you can barely see jamon in it, it was sliced way too thinly. Open face salmon sandwich was ok, and the eggplant and goat cheese tapas was ok, again very small portion, and the eggplant slice is too thin.\nOverall, we had enough food for 2 people, but spending $180 (including tip) is way too much for food we did not enjoy.", "author": "Alla S."}

I had heard good things from Coqueta, and it had 4 stars, but to be honest, I have had better spanish food in the worst tourist traps in Spain than here.\n\nChef Dominick Maietta clearly has no idea about spanish cuisine, and as a spaniard I found some of the food in this place culturally offensive.\n\nI should have known better when I saw what they consider \"paella\". The moment you see chorizo as a paella ingredient you know that you are not in the right place, but in one of those that thinks that yellow rice with multiple meats and seafoods is paella. However, I thought that if I avoided the paella and just order tapas it would be ok. I was mistaken.\n\nThe pintxos are what I would call a scam. If chef Dominick Maietta has never tried them at least he could google them, and he would see that they are served over bread. $2.5 for a boiled quail egg and a piece of pepper without bread, is not just a scam, is simply disgusting. If he had ever visited a restaurant in Spain he would also know that the moment you sit down, there should be bread on the table.\n\nThe \"house cured\" serrano ham gives bad name to what serrano ham should be. It was really bland, with not enough taste and the texture was too soft. By the way, you do not put pepper on serrano ham.\n\nOne of the most surprising failures in the menu was the Pan con tomate. This is a traditional snack that even as a little children I could prepare by myself. You take a piece of bread, toast it, you rub half a tomato into it, add olive oil and salt, and you got it. Simple, cheap and delicious!... apparently even that is too complicated for the chef. His concept of pan con tomate is bringing a piece of toasted bread and a little bowl of what looks like a can tomato sauce.\n\nThe octopus was ok, slightly overcooked, and way too small for a $14 tapa, but given the previous failures I was happy to have something decent.\n\nThe bikini was good, again a bit too small, but tasty and warm. I did enjoy it while it lasted.\n\nThe sangria is decent, I like them a bit more juicy but it was good, and I recommend it given that this place does not seem to know what kalimotxo is. Again, if the chef has not tried it himself, at least he could google it.\n\nThe service was nice, and the building and decor are great.\n\nI would have to get my spanish food fix somewhere else.", "author": "Pablo M."}

Oh my Yelp friends, we did exactly that.\n\nWe sat down and right away we were asked what we wanted to drink. If it wasn't for that fact I need to get back to the office later that day, I would have order one of their drinks. They all looked so intriguing and delicous. I will back to try those some time soon. I will side track for a second and talk about the bar, they have a really nice bar in the middle of the restaurant. Very welcoming bar and atmosphere. Love how it was central point, to give point of welcome for all! \n\nAs for the food, we order the patatas bravas, wood grilled octopus, gelatin gazapacho and heirloom tomatoes. They were all devine, but the octopus was so delicous, perfectly grilled, and tender, loved it. Must try!\n\nThen on to the dessert. We got the flan and the fruit gelato gapacho. Amazing. Getting those two and sharing were great combo. The flan was right amount of rich, and the fruit gazapacho was a great refreshing send off, especially how they presented the dessert (get it and you will see, I won't \"spoil\" it for you, lol!) \n\nIf you read my other reviews, I don't usually go back to the same place, as there are so many great eats in SF....but oh yes, I will be back here.

Went here on a date night and it was such a great date night place.\n\nWine: Their wine is pretty expensive. We picked a random Spanish red that was only $44 because that was my price range. It was pretty good, but not as deep as I usually like my reds. It was kind of light and spicy, but I still enjoyed it.\n\nFood: We started with the sea urchin open faced sandwich (Mar y monta\u00f1a, \"sea and mountain\" ). It was good, but honestly nothing special. It didn't have much of a flavor, and was $14, so I wouldn't order it again (3/5). Then we got the \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo which was AMAZING (5/5). I was kind of hesitant because the egg seemed random, but everyone had recommended it to me. It was SO good, the sauce especially. If you mix everything together- potatoes, egg, sauce, shrimp- YUM. Would for sure order it again. Lastly, we got the paella. For this I would say (4.5/5). It was really good and very filling, definitely for 3 people so we took some home. The shrimp was delicious. The chorizo was also surprisingly good. The lemon aioli to put on top was a little too much for me, so we asked for a side of lemon to squeeze over it.

The ambience, the food, the service, physical venue....everything exceeded my expectations. \n\nFrom start to finish my dining experience at Coqueta was impeccable. I made a reservation on opentable for lunch on a weekday and on the morning of, I realized I was running about 30 mins late. I called in to see if it would be possible to push back the reservation, and the hostess said it was not a problem but I would possibly get seated at the bar if there were no seats. I was fine with that, and when I got to the restaurant there was seating availability and we were seated immediately. \n\nI started with the Bar\u00e7a Gintonic (Bloom london dry gin, fever tree tonic, grapefruit). This was unlike any average gin & tonic I've ever had. First of all, it was the prettiest drink I've ever seen (please refer to picture). In terms of taste, You could taste the high quality in every single ingredient, each mixed in together so perfectly -- I wouldn't change a single thing about it. It was a cup of deliciousness. \n\nWe then had the Ensalada de Kale Lacinato Kale (fresh garbanzos, grilled strawberries, Cana de Cabra cheese, cocoa croutons and warm Sherry vinegar dressing). This was the most delicious salad I've ever had. It was the perfect sweetness--almost like a dessert salad--with the strawberry, cocoa croutons and Sherry vinegar dressing mixed together, but the garbanzo beans and croutons gave it the perfect texture as well.\n\nWe also had the grilled octopus, croquetas de pollo (chicaron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured cara-cara orange) and wild mushrooms dishes. Those were also amazing. The octopus was fresh and refreshing with a chewy yet light lemon-y taste. The croquetas were good but didn't blow me away (pretty standard), and I loved the mushroom dish mostly b/c I'm a huge fan of mushrooms. \n\nLastly, we had the churros for dessert and they were phenomenal. The perfect fried crunchiness dipped in melted cocoa...couldn't have asked for a better meal.\n\nOn top of the food, the service and venue were awesome as well.

Coming from Chicago which has some pretty decent tapas places, coqueta just brought my tapas standard to a new level. Everything is rich and super flavourful. \n\nWe ordered the dishes that were recommended by the server, namely the sunny side up, the duck meat balls. I am a huge fan of roast mushroom when it comes to tapas, so I got the roast garlic and wild mushroom. We also got the pork shoulder. I was not terribly hungry so we opt out on the paella since the serving size is 2-3 ppl. I did ask for the paella since it is usually 30 wait for one. However, they do pre-hook some ahead of time, so if you are in a mood for paella, make sure that's the first thing that you order.\n\nEverything is very delicious and you can tell the chef tried to include all flavors, savory, sweet etc. Sunny side up came the first and i was amazed by the flavour of the chorizo. Everything was perfectly cooked. \n\nThe pork came the next. It looked a little raw so I was kinda worried. However, it was super tender and juicy with the perfectly crusted outside.\n\nThe mushroom is my staple tapas dish and the one at coqueta didn't fail me at all. \n\nI was not super impressed by the duck meatball as the duck flavor was not as strong as i expected.\n\nWe also got the dessert trio.

Well it is always busy and you need a reservation or highly recommended. Which I understand because it's a small place. In fact I feel like I am on top of the table and people next to me. The atmosphere and decor is really nice and rustic. We were earlier then our reservation and lucked out and got seated within 5 min. Our waiter was nice and explained the menu cocktails and gave good suggestions. \n\nThe food..... Was ok. I have had better and for cheaper. I loved the quail egg pickled skewer and the marinated octopus. We ordered the paella and I found it dry and had a burnt tomato after taste which thank god I had their specialty Gin tonic that cleared my palette. Or I thought. Burnt tomato followed me the rest of the night. The dessert we ordered the caramel popcorn cheesecake which was good but left much to be desired. However I think I am being biased because I really wanted the Austrian apple pie with blue cheese ice cream but it was sold out. \n\nLast but not least. The female bathroom was disgusting. Someone needed to attend to that and ASAP!! The garbage was overflowing. The mirror was splattered, toilet paper was on the floor and the towel dispenser was out and there was hand wipes on a wooden table but far away from the darn sink. For a higher end restaurant the bathroom should be maintained.", "author": "Marcella H."}

I saw it on the Cooking Channel. (I suppose it could've been worse. It could've been like... on the Food Network via Guy Fieri... Ick!) I was watching an episode of \"Kelsey's Essentials.\" She was boasting about her recent food trip to San Francisco and observed that \"Spanish cuisine is all the rage there right now!\" Was it ever *not* the rage? I assumed Spanish food has been en vogue for some time... Anyway, she recreated a dish that she said was inspired by a meal at Coqueta. I was so intrigued I attempted to book a reservation ASAP... Alas, I didn't realize how popular Coqueta was/is and had to wait it out. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the red kale ensalada ($11). I enjoyed this and felt this was necessary given the amount of meat we anticipated eating that night. It was refreshing and somewhat substantive. The hazelnuts and squash added a nice textural dimension and bite. The chicken and English pea croquetas were lovely ($9). Nicely fried, hearty, and paired well with the cara-cara orange on the side. It was presented interestingly... three croquetas with three orange slices on a stick. I assumed it was meant to be eaten together at once on a skewer? So I tried doing that... eh, it wasn't very efficient so I stuck to the fork. Anyway, my favorite small plate of the night was the Sunny Side-Up Egg ($13). The accompanying shrimp were perfectly cooked --- plump, juicy, and just warm enough. Our server presented the dish and like a painter. She mixed all the flavors, ingredients, and colors together. Lovely. Our two meat-heavy plates - short ribs ($15) and albondigas ($12) - were also delicious. I will say, however, that the albondigas were common and they didn't look very appetizing. Nevertheless, if you want something hearty, order one of those. Another surprising winner of the night was dessert. The churros with drinking chocolate and dried berry dust ended the meal on a high note. It was fried, but also didn't make us feel immobile afterward. Dipping the churros in the chocolate sauce with some of the berry dust was fun and even more importantly, flavorful. \n\nOur server was a vibrant woman with a good sense of humor. She was very attentive, friendly, and thoroughly answered my questions. She was also a great promoter of Coqueta telling us of other dishes to try in the future. Coqueta's interior evokes warmth and intimacy... rich colors, dramatic yet suggestive furniture, and seductive art. The clientele were mostly out-of-towners, \"girls' night out\" pairings (a la Carrie Bradshaw), and the Financial District types. Coqueta made having a meal approximate to \"tourists' central\" worthwhile!", "author": "James Z."}

You can pair the plates with selections from a strong wine list, or one of their many creative cocktails. The service was also top-notch. Everyone we encountered was fast, friendly, and made great recommendations based on our interests. \n\nSituated on the waterfront near the Ferry Building, Coqueta has mostly glass on the walls facing the Bay.

I called right away to confirm, no sweat. My group of four shows up at 7:56 pm for an 8 pm reservation and we are told to wait in the bar. 20 minutes later and our cocktails haven't arrived yet but our table is finally ready. The hostess was all bent out of shape for having to split the cocktail tab after she demanded we tab out before being seated. I didn't feel bad at all after we were made to wait for 20 minutes with no explanation or apology for a reservation that they threatened to cancel two days earlier.\n\nThe service during dinner was spotty at best. Our server was knowledgable and sassy in a fun way, but not very available for us. Cocktails continued to take way too long to arrive during dinner and we sat for a stupid amount of time after our entire table was cleared of food/bev before the check arrived. Also a pain is the bathroom set-up - one toilet for each gender so there was typically a line. Not cool. \n\nThe food was good. A couple of the dishes were great, and some were inedible. We ordered a large charcuterie board per our server's recommendation and then one of each of the hot tapas. The meats and cheeses were great but not surprising in any way, but the bit of bread that came with was outstanding. The serrano pepper dish was far too spicy for even the spicy-lovers at our table - we had them take it away after a few tastes. The prawns were straight up not good and the octopus was tough. We very much enjoyed the Bikini Brioche, Sunny Side Up Huevo and the Croquetas. We sampled a good portion of the gin cocktails and would give a thumbs up to them all. \n\nIf you can look past the unfortunate service there are gems to be found here.

I definitely recommend these three dishes, unless you aren't a fan of sea urchin (which I know a lot of people are not).  I personally love sea urchin though, so I was excited to see this on the menu, and was not disappointed.  I also highly recommend the gin and tonic, which is not only delicious, but one of the prettiest drinks I have ever seen.

Coqueta definitely did both the former and the latter. \n\nWhen I heard that the famous Michael Chiarello from Napa opened up a hot new tapas spot on the Embarcadero, I shed a tear of joy, went to Opentable and tried to acquire a reservation. However, Coqueta only accepts reservations a month in advance and was completely booked except in the most inopportune times for me. Since I hate rejection, I had given up on my dream for quenching my Chiarello thirst for the time being.\n\nBut having heard an overwhelming amount of raves about this place from friends and acquaintances, I decided to try again. The trick is to skip Opentable and actually call the restaurant! They have some highly coveted secret spots that don't show up on Opentable. So I managed to snag the bf and me a reservation for a fine Saturday evening with the anticipation of having my taste buds tantalized. And tantalized they were...\n\nThe food is simply incredible from start to finish. I highly recommend ordering about 2-3 tapas and 1 main entree per person as the portions are quite meager. I highly recommend the following: \n\n1. Melt in your mouth chicken and english pea croquetas\n2. Bursting with flavor sunny side up egg with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing\n3. Intense gambas al negro with gulf prawns, black garlic & chilli\n4. Tender and juicy pluma pork shoulder loin with honey chilli glaze\n5. Silky smooth arroz cremosa (slowly cooked bomba rice with day boat scallops and summer squash & blossoms)\n6. Drool inducing churro fantasia dessert\n7. Classic flan espanola dessert \n\nBut don't stop with just the food. Please try some of the delicious hand crafted libations from the fabulous mixologists. The cocktails here are simply to die for! Tell the waiter/waitress what you're in the mood for and you'll get the perfect recommendations! Also, don't forget to pair your dessert with a dessert wine - the ports here taste like spiked honey. \n\nAnd of course, the ambiance is classy & trendy and the views are great. \n\nSo if you're lucky enough to snag a reservation, definitely check out Coqueta.

Lately, we've been having Spanish/tapas style food and it just so happens that Coqueta was also one of those restaurants. Anyways, we booked reservations about two weeks in advance for a lovely Saturday lunch. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately at one of the corner booths. The 4 of us each got our own drinks and shared these 8 dishes:\n\nBarca Gintonic: A really beautiful drink. I'm actually not a big fan of gin in general because of its taste, but after having Coqueta's, I really liked it. It was very refreshing with a bit of a floral/fruity taste. A bit expensive for a drink though.\n\nChorizo: Just OK. The chorizo came as bite-size skewers with roasted artichokes and piquillo pepper. For the portion size, it was quite expensive and not worth it. Least impressive dish. \n\nSunny side-up egg with Shrimp and Crispy Potato: YUM. One of my favorite dishes even though it was a bit oily... The server would burst the egg yolk and mix it with the shrimp and crispy potatoes. The potatoes were really crispy, so when you eat all three together in a mixture, it had the perfect crunch to it. Nice texture to it. I think this dish would be perfect for brunch. \n\nWhole Monterey Calamari on the Plancha: Not your normal crispy calamari. Really liked the squid ink alioli with the calamari. Calamari was fresh and chewy. \n\nPaella: I have had paella at several other restaurants before. Honestly, it was just OK. The paella came with root vegetables, chorizo, prawns, clams, and lemon alioli. The lemon alioli paired well with the paella. Otherwise, nothing really stood out. Some of the seafood tasted a bit too fishy for me. :/\n\nPluma (Pork Shoulder Loin): Just OK... It was pretty tender, but nothing too special. It was already flavorful enough without having to pair it with the honey-chili glaze.\n\nSetas al ajillo: My other favorite dish of the night! Loved the flavors to the mushrooms. I felt healthy just eating it. It wasn't too heavy nor too oily. \n\nGrilled Albondigas: Duck and pork meatballs. At first bite, the texture was a bit weird for me.. It was a bit mushy, yet bursted with flavor... but past that, it was really delicious. A bit heavy, hearty, yet juicy.\n\nChurros with drinking hot chocolate and mixed berry powder: Dip the churro first into the mixed berry powder and then into the hot chocolate. It tasted very yummy! I really liked the combination of the two. A good way to end a delicious meal.\n\nWhat really bugged me was that there were quite a few flies at our table. Every time we tried to eat or drink, there was always at least one buzzing around. It was quite annoying.. :( Anyways, service was excellent. Our water cups were always refilled and our plates were changed each time we got a new dish. The overall meal was quite expensive as it added up. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food and I would say that Coqueta is one of the better restaurants for tapas style/Spanish food.", "author": "Philana C."}

I still have not found a place with better churros than XOCO in Chicago.  D bar in San Diego, and Mesa Grill in Las Vegas are distant second.  Prices tend to be quite expensive, and this is the part where I think some of the competitors have the upper hand.  My second complain is the uncomfortable seats at the bar.  \n\nWe wanted to try the Paella, but opted to go with variety instead.

It feels like it's separated into 2 different rooms both daily small; one it's just sitting area with the kitchen in front of you if you're sitting around the counter area and another seating area, you have a bar. They have a wide range of liquor sand also pretty interesting cocktails. We made a reservation and got there 10 minutes before but still had to wait 20 minutes for a table because they happened to have a huge group that's seated. The service was actually pretty decent. \n\nThere's so many options in tapas whether it's hot or cold. They also have a few selections on cured meats, cheese platters, and the bite size skewers. They do have big plates (family/entree size). We were about to order the bite size skewers but none of them have meat in them so we passed on that. We wanted to try a lot of items on their menu so we didn't order any big/entree plates. \n\nWe ordered the deviled eggs and it's pretty creamy, but I think they can do a little better on the toppings. The croquetas de pollo is a MUST try dish! It's deep fried and crispy on the outside but very flavorful and creamy on the inside. They also give you little orange  slices which I guess it's to cleanse your palettes. The patatas bravas is a little different. It's mini fried potato balls that has a smokey taste, but I do love the dipping sauce and it does make a difference in terms of taste. The gambas al negro (prawns in olive oil and garlic sauce with toasted French bread, is okay because you can eat this anywhere. The sunny side up surprisingly tasted a little like kimchi fried rice without the kimchi and rice and it's actually pretty good. It also comes with crispy thinly sliced potatoes which reminds me of very fresh hash browns. Our last tapas was the duck and pork meatballs. It's a little on the sweeter side, wish it's more savory.\n\nOf course we ordered desserts too. We ordered the flan and the bite size cheesecake. The flan was perfect in texture and taste, not too sweet, and it has fresh blackberries with it so it's more healthy. On the other hand, the bite size cheesecake was way too sweet and heavy. It also comes with caramel popcorn and it's also pretty sweet. \n\nThis restaurant is good with their drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) and savory dishes. Next time I'll come back and try other dishes and drinks.", "author": "Cindy W."}

The cherried are the killer in them, devil eggs. Creamy, smoky, nice presentation, tomato bread( pan con tomate)  a different aproach since in spain is serve toasted bread with fresh tomato kind of salsa, here they cooked the tomatoes and puree then so is more enfasis on the flavor, and the bread is nice crunchy, moist still.

I would go back just for the sunny side up egg over crispy potatoes and shrimp with chorizo dressing (however, I would tell them to hold the shrimp, which made no sense in this dish.) The whole appeal of pan con tomate is the raw freshness of the tomato and garlic, but this had a thick, stewed tomato sauce to spread on the bread...odd. The \"black shrimp\" were cooked perfectly, plain but good, and salted well. Valde\u00f3n cheese, well, you can't really go wrong with Spanish cheese, and the membrillo that came with it was excellent. The croquettes were also excellent, but lacked salt.\n\nNow, the paella...likely the worst paella I have ever had. It had this weird tomato (?) sauce on top of the rice. The alioli (served on the side) was bland, flavored with lemon, not garlic (a sin, in my opinion) and who the hell puts huge chunks of (almost raw) cauliflower and broccoli in a seafood paella? 6 clams and 4 shrimp was the total seafood count in a paella for 3...very stingy.  I could have probably overlooked much of this except the rice, which should always be the star of the paella, was flavorless, overcooked and mushy. A very sad state of affairs when the waitress brags that paella is their specialty.\n\nThe little manchego cheesecake bites, no charge, were awesome.\n\nCome here for a drink at the bar and a couple of tapas, but do not get the paella.", "author": "Elisa C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "description": "The short of it: Try Coqueta once or twice. They deserve at least that much, and hopefully you catch them on a good night. The good news is, there's a lot of options to choose from and something is bound to strike your fancy.\n\n\"It must have been a bad night.\" \"Maybe they were short staffed tonight.\" \"Well ,we did eat late, so that must have something to do with it.\" \"Chiarello must not come around much.\" I find myself looking for reasons to give Coqueta a higher rating, but for now, I don't have one.\n\nNeed more info? Read on.\n\n----\n\n\nHere's what I took from this experience:\n\nThe Space and Staff.\nThere is an air of Chiarello's aesthetic all over the place; You'll recognize the Napa Style (his retail endeavor) merchandise all over the place. Animal hides on the walls. Hammered copper tumblers. Rustic wood tables. There is nothing unapproachable or intimidating about it.\n\nThe host and waitress were very sweet, but the waitress forgot an order and didn't check on us as frequently as we'd hoped so we could place another order before the kitchen closed. Though she asked just before this time came, we felt pressured not to order when she finally asked because the kitchen closed in one minute. We would have ordered more otherwise.\n\nThe Pricing.\nReasonable and expected. Some items were insanely overpriced, some were right on target. I'm not afraid to pay good money for a tiny, one-bite wonder, but not for something lackluster and ordinary. We ordered 2 alcoholic drinks, 4 skewers, 1 cold tapas plate, 1 hot plate, 1 vegetable plate, and 2 dessert items for about $100 with tip.\n\n---\n\nThe Food.\nIt's hard to say anything other than \"confused\" here. There are some traditional combinations as well as some unusual pairings, but they didn't always deliver.\n\nThe Highs\n\nCroquetas de Pollo\nThese were heavenly, and as many reviewers said, like chicken pot pie in a bite.\nVery creamy interior, crispy exterior. The cured oranges on the side were a nice palette cleanser and were nice combined when combined with the Croquetas as well, but seem sort of haphazard on the side of the plate.\n\nChurros\nI'm happy that this was the last thing I had before leaving. The order came with four small-sized churros, served with a small cup of drinking chocolate and crushed mixed berry powder. This powder, while seeming to be nothing more than a garnish, really makes the dish. The acidity from the berries cuts right through the heavy body of the chocolate, and compliments the cinnamon and sugar on the churro. Spot on in flavor, but could have been warmer. They didn't seem fresh.\n\nManchego Cheesecake Pops\nA smart combination and delicious. As a sheepsmilk cheese, Manchego has a small amount of tang that is reminiscent of cream cheese -- I think that's why these work and where the sweet and savory happily come together. The pops are served on a stick and with small bits of caramel corn on the platter to bring back the sweet side of things. Probably the highlight of the night.\n\n----\nThe (Really Low) Lows--\n\nPintxos - Bite Size Skewers\nThese are a joke. We had 4 of the 5 options available, there were all forgettable and left me saying, \"$2.50 for that?\" It wasn't an issue of size by any means, but of flavor. Maybe our skewers had been sitting around for a while, and they certainly tasted that way. None of the flavors really stood out for how simple the ingredients were. I wouldn't order any of these again.\n\nSeta de Ajillo\nThis was a tragedy. This should have been a simple, wonderful dish and was by far the biggest disappointment. I absolutely love mushrooms, and had to choke this down because of how insanely over seasoned and oily they was. Was it supposed to be like this? I should have sent it back.\n\n----\n\nThe experience was pleasant overall, but there is a lot of room for improvement. What I was served wasn't a true reflection of what Chef Chiarello is capable of, and it's an issue of execution. I didn't love anything and the lows really put a damper on the entire meal.  I'm under the impression that this is a side project doesn't get much of the chef's attention. \n\nWith some attentiveness and focus to the vision of Coqueta, I think this would have been a much better experience. Regardless, I'm curious enough about what went wrong to try again.", "author": "Panda B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-03", "description": "\"OMG, Ken K is not eating Chinese or Japanese!!!\" Apparently I gave at least one person an almost heart attack or something over the weekend when I checked in here.\n\nYeah I know, big shocker eh? Sometimes a brutha has to cross international boundary lines with the FOB palette. There's only so much Chinese and Japanese one can handle.  \n\nSince \"izakaya\" has been remarketed as \"Japanese tapas\", it was high time to try the original Spanish version at a place that's been picking up steam...or shall I say Spanish Izakaya. Or Spanish \"dim sum\" meant to be drowned with alcohol and cocktails. As you can see I still have the FOB judge hat on!\n\nAnd Coqueta is a pretty fancy one at that. Made a reservation via opentable about 5 hours prior and got seated at the counter. Other than the pretty uncomfortable seating arrangement, the upside was getting a full view of the action, and some interaction with the friendly kitchen staff which was really cool. Have no clue who Mike Chiarello is other than what I've read, and don't think he was there last night. But no matter, I was there for food and company, not for fawning. \n\nThere are far more experienced Spanish food and tapas eaters who know this stuff hot and cold better than I do. \n\nKing of FOB food was once again put in charge of ordering, which in foreign territory can be a bit daunting, but fun at the same time. With a little Yelp from my friends (thanks Cherylynn N!) I took the reins and ordered a bit too much food.\n\nJamon Iberico de bellota - F**K Kobe beef BS! This is it! Not to say that A5 Wagyu is bad...but a premium slice of pedigree Spanish ham is one of those must try before you croak experiences, particularly if you are a huge pork fan. One kitchen staffer described it as \"Kobe pork\" (word bleh) but yeah I am well aware of what this stuff can do to you and your wallet. Nutty (from the free range Iberico black pig being fed a steady diet of acorn), the right balance of salt, fat, umami, with a slight hint of sweetness...the paper thin slices are delicate and put so many other kinds of ham to shame. They say YOLO, I say try this! \n\nJamon Serrano - this is a much cheaper ham that Coqueta cures in house. It's quite salty but otherwise good, and a staffer was kind enough to offer us a slice to sample. \n\nBeet salad - Good. If you mess up a simple salad using quality ingredients from down the street (Ferry Building Farmers Market) don't even bother.\n\nHouse cure white anchovies (cold tapas) - The biggest downer of the evening. Super duper trooper SALTY. At least the sour accent shined. If it wasn't salty this could have been pretty decent. \n\nCrispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake with saffron alioli - fried stuff may always taste better, but is not easy to nail down which these guys did. Not greasy...and good quality shrimp. I doubt you can even find good regional Cantonese fried lotus root slices stuffed with shrimp paste renditions in town, and this trumps most Korean style pajeons around. Bravo!\n\nWood grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, pimento, and olive oil - Sweet fingerling potatoes, and a perfectly tender octopus with a delightful chew/bite. Only certain European (and Japanese preps) of octopus are truly noteworthy. Loved it.\n\nPluma - Iberico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey chili glaze. Yes, 8 pieces for $38 is not cheap...but it's acorn fed Iberico free range black pig, shoulder cut. Plus woodfire grilling done right. Phenomenal texture and control of the flame, a little salt rub and it has a delightful juice bite with a smooth tender chew. It's not fatty, but it's not dry and skinny either (well marbled but you can't tell). It's basically Spanish version of cha siu (Cantonese BBQ pork, shoulder cut is used too), especially with the honey chili glaze you can squirt over. If anyone travels to Hong Kong, Tin Lung Heen does an Iberico pork cha siu\n\nhttp://www.foodspotting.com/places/311881-tin-lung-heen-restaurant-hong-kong/items/342-chinese-roast-pork\n\nTo try next time: grilled branzino!\n\nVineyard greens - Catalan style, Caper raisin puree, with raisins, pine nuts, and garlic. Quite bitter and a touch salty with interesting textures and tastes from the other things inside. Probably needs to be washed down with alcohol.\n\nDessert: \n\nChurro Fantasia - crispy Spanish doughnuts with drinking chocolate and mixed berry powder. Solid, very nice and toasty. After this I don't want Costco, Flea Market, or County Fair churros ever again.\n\nStrawberry plum gazpacho with liquid nitrogen frozen blood peach neblina. Pictures\ndescribe it better than I can. Very nice.\n\nToo full...all that was food for two. Had to cancel the skewers/Pintxos.\n\nLots of photography opportunities here...staff preparing appetizers with uni and lardo, desserts, cheese platters, the big ass jamon iberico leg to the side, good looking people eating around, the Pintxos tray, good looking people.

We were seated at a long table along a window.  It was relatively comfortable, but it was a bit of a struggle getting up on the bench by the window.  The table is set really close to the bench, and if I was just one month more pregnant (or on the heftier side), I don't think I would have been able to squeeze through onto the bench.  The high chairs on the other side of the table were also a bit awkward.  You basically couldn't get in or out of the high chair without hitting a chair and/or person next to you.\n\nAnyway, after getting ourselves situated, we shared and enjoyed several tapas:\n\nChef's Grand Selection of Cured Meats and Cheeses - Compared to the meat and cheese plates of other restaurants, I didn't feel that we got $38 of value.  I admit my value perception may be a bit tainted by the fact my preggers state meant I couldn't enjoy any of the cured meats or the manchego cheese since it was made with raw goat's milk.  I loved the Valdeon blue cheese, but it overpowered my palette, so I couldn't really taste any distinctive flavor with the Cana de Cabra soft goat cheese.\n\nCrispy Shrimp & Chickpea Flour Pancake - I love all things deep fried, and this did not disappoint.  I like my citrus, so I probably would have enjoyed a bit more of the roaster meyer lemon to squeeze on top.\n\nWood Grilled Octopus - Super tender (not overcooked and rubbery), well-seasoned, and a delightful recommendation from someone else that insisted we order it.\n\nDuck & Pork Albondigas and Beef Shortribs - Both good, but unremarkable.\n\nIf I come again, I'd skip the Apple and Pear Ensalada and Patatas Bravas.", "author": "Christina L."}

I decided to go on a Friday after work and try my lock to snap some seats in the bar area as it's first come, first served. I totally lucked out and got one of the two big picnic tables outside, it was a killer day in SF! I ordered the gin and tonic, not generally a big person but had to try it after hearing so much about it. It was definitely good but the presentation is what made it great. It was honestly the prettiest drink I've ever had. \n\nWe got a bunch of tapas to start -- there was four of us total, I would definitely recommend going with a group of at least four so you can try more things. The meatballs were hoenstly the best I've ever had in my life, we ended up ordering a second round because they were that good. The patatas bravas, chicken and pea croqettes and warm chocolate cake were there other all stars of the meal. The paella was really good but still wasn't my favorite, next time I think I'll just get tapas as those were my favorite. \n\nThe restaurant itself is cute inside, not as big as I thought it'd be but has a very comfortable vibe. The bar inside is pretty small and super crowded post work which is to be expected. Sitting outside was perfect for us since we had plenty of space. Our server was a total doll, I spaced on getting her name but it seemed like all the servers were top notch. Add this to your list of must tries in San Francisco!", "author": "Lizzy U."}

Long story short, we ended up with a bill that was twice as much as we anticipated. \n\nThe food was good, not great. Nothing stood out or blew my mind. It's expensive for what it is. Portions are really small (I know they're tapas but it's smaller than the usual tapas) so you'll need about 3 tapas plus an entree per person to feel satiated. \n\nThe Pluma was $38 which is expensive for an entree to begin with. On top of that it's just 6 oz of pork (no sides). Yes, it's iberico. Yes, it's good but it was not $38 dollars good. It's more like $25 dollars good.\n\nWe had one of each of the pintxos ($2.50 each) none of them were any good.\n\nAlmond Joy ($4) drink was not good. \nThe Castro (margarita, $12) was good.\nMini Manchego Cheesecake Pop ($4) was too salty.

The chefs counter puts a whole different perspective   on the way a restaurant with pure passion is driven to create every single dish to perfection! The service is so incredible EVERYONE checks up on you. To the point to where you don't even have to worry about ordering another drink if you are due for one because when you sip the remainder bit of wine , there is more coming! Should try the Chiarello Family Vineyard pairs Zinfandel.. It pairs beautifully  with the Pluma Acorn fed Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze. The chili Glaze is there, but try it with out the Extra Chili sauce to indulge in the flavor of the Pork. I swear  to god you will just taste pure raw talent! Next up is the Brotes de broccoli con romescu broccoli di ciccio a la parilla with coal roasted romescu sauce. HA! Im not going to explain how awesome that is, you just have to try it out!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-27", "description": "So, I'll admit to something: I haven't been this excited about a place since State Bird Provisions.  At the same time, I mean, how could you not be excited about Coqueta?  Add Michael Chiarello, a prime location on the Embarcadero, a beautifully crafted menu, and of course, Iberico pork, things are going to shake out pretty nicely.  I made a reservation for an early Sunday dinner about a month ago (after constantly checking and finally succumbing to a 5:15pm rez on Sunday).  After torturing myself with all of the amazing Yelp pics, I saved all my calories for this and it was going to a be a no holding back experience.  The results were as follows:\n\nCocktails:\nBarca Gintonic: I chose this after seeing all of the beautiful pictures of it on Yelp!  This G&T is a little sweeter than what I'm used to, but I still drank all of it.\nTariff: Greg selected this after reading that the gin used was infused with Iberico jamon. After trying it, I couldn't really taste an essence of pork, but there was a strong flavor of apricots and orange.  A creative and new take on the G&T!\nEngine Co. #5: Greg also selected this after finishing the Tariff since he enjoys bourbon, and was interested in trying tobacco infused cream sherry.  The drink was definitely strong, and I will say that to enjoy it, you must really love bourbon.\n\nOk, and now my friends, on to the food!\n\nTapas:\nChicken and English pea coquetas: The cheese to everything else was great, but was lacking a little bit of salt. The best way to describe this is a mini chicken pot pie inside a tater tot.  We were so-so on this.\n\nSerrano ham & Manchego cheese: We elected this since pork is an absolute must here, and Greg's a fan of Manchego cheese.  Both items we selected were delicious, and the portions of both cheese and jamon were just right.  What was also great about this is that we selected these two items separately and it came out presented beautifully paired with some olive oil crackers, a fig paste, and some salted toasted nuts.  Absolutely delicious and would highly recommend.\n\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizon dressing: I selected this dish because I really enjoy my fair share of camaron y huevo y chorizo.  Greg wasn't a huge fan of this dish mostly because he wasn't sure how all of the elements on the plate fit together, but I was sold on it.  The chorizon dressing on it really nailed it, and the runny egg added to the flavor of the sauce.  I recommend ordering this.\n\nDuck and pork meatball: Definitely a unique flavor profile, the duck added some fattiness, the cherries were sour but added a great taste, and the crispy shallot on top added texture to the overall meatball.  This isn't your standard meatball you get - THIS IS A MEATBALL. Greg and I agreed that this would be a dish we'd order again.\n\nPluma: If you're only going to have one meal, make it this. Actually, if you're only going to go out for a fancy dinner and absolutely must have pork, you must eat this.  Of all the places I've been to (and I'd like to think I've been to a lot of places), I've never been blown away like this by a first bite.  First off, let's talk about the exterior. The crust of the pork is absolutely perfect and comes served with a light dusting of salt.  On top of that, the honey chili glaze, which comes with a warm bottle of extra in case you want more, gives it a little bit of sweetness to go alongside the juicy meat.  Next, the interior: If you were to look at this, you wouldn't know it's pork.  In fact, the juiciness and the beautifully cooked meat is similar to that of what you'd find in a prime cut steak.  And when I mean it's cooked perfectly, I mean, it is absolutely cooked perfectly.  Big ups to Coqueta for creating such a beautiful and delicious dish! Greg admits that he'd come back here just for this, and wouldn't share it with me.  #sorryimnotsorry\n\nAnd of course, what is a beautiful Spanish meal without dessert!\n\nManchego cheesecake lollipops with caramel popcorn: Delicious (and was given to us on the house) but incredibly rich in cheese taste.  Having had the Manchego earlier, both of us were on cheese overload.  But we ate it anyway.  I do enjoy caramel popcorn, so the two combined were delicious.  I think if we had our choice, we'd opt for a different dessert, but wasn't upset about getting it.\n\nChurros with chocolate sauce/berry powder: So, what about this combination seems odd to you?  Berry powder?  How does that work?  Surprisingly, it's an interesting way to eat a traditional dessert like a churro.  Accompanied with a chocolate sauce, the berry powder is meant to be used with the churro.  Like I said, really interesting stuff, and very thought-provoking concept.  The churro itself was just OK, Gitane's donuts are still one of my favorite items I've had recently.\n\nOk so, if you couldn't tell, I love this place and will be coming back. And you should go try it. Like ASAP. The End.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Some of the food items we had were: jamon Iberico de bellota (true acorn fed pig from Iberico), a classic paella, open faced salmon sandwiches, boquerones.\n\nOne word of warning: If you don't watch out, just like with any good tapas place, you may end up ordering more and more food and drinks, then at the end of the meal you will find to your horror that you had run up the bill.

Not sure what the occasion was or who was playing, but everyone in the entire restaurant stopped eating to watch. Some kind of eclectic drum-based new world music. Now that does sound weird or hoity-toity but it actually made for a great vibe in the place.", "author": "Gail S."}

The food was outstanding, the drinks were well proportioned and of high caliber, and most importantly, our waiter provided us with impeccable service. Tapas are tricky; you (or at least I) rely on suggestions as to what small plates compliment one another along the road towards a great full dinner experience. That being said, my visit last night to celebrate my two year anniversary was a disaster. It began well enough as we enjoyed a drink at the bar, but after we were given a table it was as if we had been cast away on a desert island, never to see our wait staff again. I literally had to flag down our waitress every step of the way: to place our initial drink order; to order first plates; to even get a glass of water. The waitress seemed to have minimal knowledge of the menu, and didn't take the time to recommend anything, except if you count the fava bean special that she apparently forgot we ordered after 20 minutes, when she told us that it was \"on its way\" only to retract her statement after another 10 to let us know they were out of fava beans. By the end of this meal my fianc\u00e9 and I were sharing a single glass of red wine because no one bothered to check how things were going. Lastly, I don't know if it was the service that soured our meal, the the quality just wasn't there this time around--especially the tiger prawns that were offensively fishy tasting. All in all, a $150 mistake. Will not be back. Bummer because I was raving about this place 5 months ago.", "author": "Kip C."}

After ordering over $250 of food and drinks for four people we were unceremoniously asked by the assistant manager in a very sardonic fashion to hurry up and get out because they had another reservation coming up.. \"you understand don't you?\" He asked. This after less than two hours? Of course this put a sour taste on the enjoyable experience we were having. Even our great waiter was bothered when he asked if we wanted dessert and I told him \"well, we were asked to hurry the hell up\".

I hadn't been to Coqueta before so this was a first for me. We had a 10:30pm reservation, which was all I could get for a saturday night, but it was fine, we got there around 9pm and sat outside to have cocktails while we waited. The drinks were fantastic. I had a Mojito and my date had a campari cocktail, not sure what the name was but they were both refreshing and yummy. By the way the weather in SF was beautiful and balmy, just like a night in Barcelona. I noticed the bar menu was the same as the main menu so you could easily sit inside or outside on the Embarcadero and have a lovely tapas meal. The wait staff was very good and attentive. We finally got to our table, which wasn't a bad wait since we were both chatting each other up. We ordered a cheese and meat plater to start, El Gran Plat Cap, which was yummy and had a fantastic variety of meats and cheese. We then received the Huevos National which was deviled eggs with a stack of delicious ingredients. I should mention that we ordered a number of tapas and the waitress was very good about seeing where we were at and bringing the next dish as we were finishing the first ones. The meal was nicely paced. We followed the eggs with  Croquetas de Pollo, Patatas Bravas, and ended with Albondigas a la Feria (duck and pork meatballs). We also added two glasses of Tempernillo Rioja, which was perfect with the food. My only complaint was with the meatballs; the duck and pork was way too rich together flavor wise and also they were a bit mushy. Might be a personal preference, not really a huge duck fan, but my date agreed they were very rich, almost too much so.\nWe didn't do dessert, too full from all the yummy food.

After a month of it opening we finally got to last night.  I tend to feel a little lukewarm towards tapas restaurants, but Coqueta blew us away.  The food was excellent and the service was knowledgeable and as top notch to match. I loved how we got a big round table to sit (table size for four), so he and I could sit next to each other making it easier to share.Since bf was so eager about being at Coqueta, we went a little crazy with our ordering.  \n\n*White wine sangria ($9): Probably the best sangria I've ever had.  So light and refreshing, you don't really taste the wine much, but it's not sweet either..if that makes sense?\n*He got a red..forgot which one!\n*Chorizo & roasted artichoke & piquillo pepper bite ($2.50/each): How can you not like sausage?  The chorizo was a little milder than what I'm used to so the artichoke & pepper stood out more.  But all-in-all, a nice bite.\n*Jamon Serrano bite ($2.50): Serrano ham with manchego cheese & apricot.  I loved this & generally I'm not too big on ham or apricot.  The cheese was mild yet distinct enough and everything tied well together.\n*Smoked Salmon open faced sandwich ($5):  OMG this was one of my absolute favorites here & I usually don't like salmon because I find the \"fishy\" taste to be strong every time I've had it.  I absolutely loved the creamy queso fresca and the truffle and honey were divine.\n*Chicken & English Pea Croquettes ($9): How do you not like something breaded and fried?  Our waiter perfectly put it, \"it's like chicken pot pie filling.\"  And he was so right!  Creamy chicken and pea filling!  So good!\n*Tattas bravas ($8): crispy potato and ham nuggets with aioli.  It was our least favorite, but still good nonetheless.  I liked how it was the perfect ratio of potato, ham, and crispiness.  \n*Tortilla Andres ($6): Mix of sweet onion, potato, asparagus topped with piquillo pepper aioli.  This is a cold tapas.  I loved this.  Good carby but veggie filled tapa to fill you up.  The aioli was what this cold dish needed as well.\n*Crispy Shrimp ($10): Little shrimps fried with chickpea flour to make a crisp pancake served with saffron aioli.  Some of the shrimps tasted a little seafoody, otherwise this dish worked.  Again, anything fried crisp is pretty much a winner.\n*Pluma ($38): Our waiter described it kobe-like pork.  And it pretty much was!  It's a pork shoulder loin served with a honey chile sauce on the side.  The pork was so tender, juicy and had a wonderful nutty texture to it.  It was charred nicely too.  It looked more like steak than pork.  We wish there was more pieces of pork though of course!\n*Churros: These were mini churros \"u\" shapped and came with a chocolate dipping sauce served alonside with a berry powder.  Fine with just the chocolate dipping sauce, the powder was a little on the sweet side.  They weren't greasy either.\n\nAfter a visit to Coqueta, you'll be like Cha Cha who?

The add on bar outside is definitely new,  communal tables, only 4 seats at the bar facing the beautiful view of the water if you come here at 5 PM! Other than that, you will facing a jam packed bar with view of people head. \n\n        Impossible for servers and busboys to navigate with food, I sort of feel bad for them. Although each time, our servers and bus boys were so nice and tried very hard. It's crowded by 6 PM, an almost impossible to look for your server when you needed something, because it's so loud, and packed like sardines! \n\n        I know, I know it's a new spot, so I need to come back a few months later to see if it gets better.

If you come a few friends, MUST TRY this dish!\n\nRACIONES Y VERDURAS - family style and market vegetables.\n- Whole grilled Branzino with green olive and preserved rangpur lime salsa -  beautifully done, moist, sweet, buttery texture, really nice dish to share.\n\nDESSERT\n- Asturian Apple pie with Cabrales blue cheese ice cream - enough to share for 2 people, my BFF loves it. \n\n- Strawberry- rhubarb gazbacho, frozen blood peach neblina,  with berries - love\n\nCOCKTAILS - fascinating list from ingredients to presentation. \n\n- Silky Sangria - modern frozen red sangria, raspberry fizzy, apple gelee, blueberries - nice and you probably need at least 3!\n\n- Pyreness Snowball - frozen sdra, gin meringue, pine, anise, yogurt, micro flowers, honey lace - about 3 tea spoons, I can do at least 5 of this, very good!\n\n- The Powell Line - Isla canarias ron arehuca, orange luqueur, fresh apple, juice, lemon juice, refreshing and nice for a warm afternoon by the Bay.\n\n- Tariff - Jamon Iberico infused gin, acorn & apricot tonic, orange, cava was quite nice! \n\n        Since it's a tapas place, your bills can add up if you eat like my BFF and I, but we enjoyed the food very much.

We've all been there).\n\nThey serve a a modern interpretation of traditional Spanish tapas with a twist of northern California flavors. The menu features cured meats & iberian cheeses; cold tapas; open-face sandwiches; a dozen hot tapas; and family-style shared plates.\n\nPretty much, everything I ordered was a winner and there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy. The only thing I regret is not having room for more food (insert: crying emoji).\n\n+ Croquetas de Pollo ($9)\n\nOkay. Hands down... these are my favorite things here. It comes with three chichar\u00f3n-crusted chicken and English pea croquetas with cured cara-cara oranges. Once you bite through the crispy outer layer, you get a creamy consistency with tender chucks of chicken inside.\n\n+Salmon Ahumado ($8). Omg... that truffle honey... I die.\n\nThis was a nice little palate opener and my 2nd favorite thing here (I'm a huge fan of lox bagels). The combination of the sweet honey + the saltiness of the salmon + the crunch of the crispy bread made it a perfect bite.\n\n+Albondigas a la Feria ($14)\n\nSo bomb. These are grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots.  The meatballs were juicy and tender with a deep brown sear on the exterior.\n\n+Paella: The classic ($45/ serves 2-3)\n\nI can't even right now... (currently: writing this blog post while starving)\n\nHonestly, it's one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThis version is made with bomba rice that nicely soaks up all the flavors of the jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, topped with gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, and broccolini.\n\nWhile all that^ was already bomb, it wasn't until I tasted the lemon aioli till I was REALLY blown away.\n\nSo to sum it all up:\n\nCoqueta is perfect for a nice brunch or dinner date (especially since it's located at Pier 5 along the embarcadero). I'd recommend coming here with friends so you can share everything and order more food. The paella is a MUST (you could prob split that between 4 people) and order more tapas to share. And since it takes about 30-40min to make, place your order right when you sit down!\n\nVisit the blog for pics: http://cyneats.com/", "author": "Cynthia L."}

We had tapas and drinks. \n\nSo here are the details -\n- We managed to get a spot at the bar on short notice - so we got a same day reservation for two.\n- All the tapas were wonderful. My absolute favorite dish was the plate of chicken croquettes. The fry was perfect - they came to us nice and warm. The fry batter included chichirones. It held together perfectly until you put one in your mouth and then they crumbled in a savory explosion.\n- The cheese plate came with traditional quince paste. There was a lot of variety, and all the cheeses were tasty.\n- The cocktails are expensive but very good and creative. I had one with gin infused with Iberico ham.\n- We met the manager, and he's a nice fellow - he and I waxed nostalgic about the wonders of Cuban food in Tampa, where we've both lived.\n\nSo it was a great meal. And at the end I forgot my credit card and our waiter sprinted down the Embarcadero to catch me and return it to me! Talk about above and beyond the call of duty!\n\nGreat food, great staff.

Yes, tapas makes it possible to try lots of menu items, which is all kinds of fun.  However, tapas sometimes takes small plates to a level where you spend a lot of money to get just a little food, and leave feeling unsatisfied.  Such was the case at Coqueta.  \n\nService was pleasant throughout our meal.  Or should I say, \"meal.\"  The host and our server were friendly and helpful.  The interior of the restaurant is small but lovely, with soaring ceilings and decor reminiscent of a hipster-style vintage barn-inspired loft.  I dug it.  The issue here was the food.  Some plates were good, some were a little less interesting, but at the end of our lunch we'd spent $65 on little bites and were both still hungry.  And I am not someone who normally likes big portions.  Like, I am not a Cheesecake Factory aficionado who doesn't get the concept of tapas.  I get it.  But the plates at Coqueta are too small.\n\nThe best food item, in my book, is the Jamon Serrano Pintxos.  A small skewer of manchego topped with a touch of apricot preserve a tiny bit of serrano ham.  Wonderful taste, incredibly flavorful.  Absolutely miniscule.  I also liked the new potatoes with mojos verde and the churros with chocolate sauce that we had for dessert.  Less inspiring was a small salad with pears and a touch of ham, which was really underwhelming.  I don't actually see it on the current menu, which is a good thing.\n\nThis is really not a good place for vegetarians.  There aren't enough vegetarian options, and the ones that are available are just okay.  My lunch companion was a vegetarian, and he was bummed.  Maybe we should have looked at the menu more carefully before we arrived, but in San Francisco, you can eat well as a vegetarian just about anywhere.  Not at Coqueta.\n\nI told a friend about my experience and she nodded her head and said, \"Oh yeah, don't even bother going there for a meal.  Coqueta is all about the cocktails and a small bite or two before moving on to dinner elsewhere.\"  Interesting.  We didn't try the cocktails, although they did look pretty good.  I'd be willing to give Coqueta another shot for some cocktails and more of the jamon serrano pintxos.  Otherwise, though, it just didn't work for me.", "author": "Erin L."}

Orders a ton of food:\n\nStarted off with the el plat cap - a selection of meat and cheese -   everything was delicious and paired together nicely\n\nThe second dish was the chicken & english pea croquetas with pickled tomatoes.   This tastes like chicken pot pie but the tomatoes were amazing!   I have never tasted tomatoes like that before.\n\nThird tapas was the sunny side up egg.   I love the mix of textures and flavors in my mouth (crunchy shoe string potatoes with egg, shrimp and a lot of spice)\n The server offered to mix it up for us (which I suggest - its just easier\nthat way).  If you don't like spice, you can take out the pepper before the server mixes it.\n\nThe next course of the meal was the pluma.   Since its pork shoulder, I thought it would be pretty tough but the meat was soooo tender.   It was flavored just right.  \n\nThe finale was the paella and dayuuuum just when I thought the food couldn't get better.

This was a restaurant we all looked forward to coming. Food was nice, drinks were good but the service wasn't impressive. (Our waitress was nice and I have nothing to complain there.)\n\nFirst, we had 5pm reservation but the restaurant wasn't ready so we had to wait a bit to be seated, which was fine, not a big deal. Once we were seated, we waited awhile for our drinks to come. We ordered a total of 5 dishes and two drinks each among the three of us. \n\nBut as the evening went on, different servers kept coming to our table asking if we were still working on our dishes. First, I thought they were attentive. Then at one point, 3 different servers came within like 5min of each other, and asked if we were still working on our dishes as if to say hurry up. It was almost obnoxious. \n\nFinally, the manager looking guy came to our table saying \"I don't mean to be rude but other people are waiting for the table\" and basically told us because we had been there for about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs we needed to finish and vacate the table. Well, his communication was rather rude and brash. Immediately after, another server came asking us if we cared for any desserts which we said no to since we had just been asked to leave.\n\nI understand it is a busy Friday night. We would have been mindful of time, had they communicated upfront that the table needed to be vacated after a certain amount of time due to high volume of customers. Or they could have communicated it in a way that wasn't so unpleasant. It wasn't as if we were nursing one drink and one dish. \n\nInstead, they were passive aggressive, and left us feeling as if we were inconveniencing them. They could have handled it in a more professional way for sure. Moreover, when the manager came, the place wasn't particularly busy. We saw a bunch of open tables. Unfortunately, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I probably won't be coming back here.", "author": "C S."}

However we were definitely not disappointed! First off, the drinks are colorful, fun and delicious. Many times non alcoholic drinks are pretty similar or for the most part not very special but that is definitely not the case here. There is a nice little selection of fun drinks and they're all very pretty!  We were super impressed with the paella and felt that it was the perfect portion for our small family of three.

It was such a NorCal interpretation of a classic Spanish tapa, that I felt that this was a pitiful representation of the superior no-frills versions that you can find at either Picaro Cafe or Contigo.\nKale & Persimmon Salad: again, this is not a Spanish dish. But holy shit, this was one of the best salads I've ever had. I wanted more. This is a must, no doubt.\nGrilled Octopus: NorCalifornianized. Such a shame because the dish could have been great.

We had made reservations through OpenTable and somehow I canceled it and never re-reserved a table. Fortunately the hostess was extremely nice and helpful over the phone and told me they can accommodate us at the bar seating -- fine with us. It was a great first impression for us. When we got there, however, it went downhill. \n\nWe were seated in the bar area as the hostess had informed us. The bar tables are very tiny and cramped but whatever. Not a big deal. We were given paper menus in which you open and presented with a bunch of drinks. I politely asked our server for the food menu and he replied in a condescending tone, \"Open it\". MAI BAD. I didn't know. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n\"Sunny side-up\" Huevo ($13): I love me some eggs, I love me some shrimps, and I love me some crispy potatoes. I would've loved this dish more if it wasn't so incredibly salty! I think they went overboard with the chorizo dressing. However, the egg did help balance out the saltiness a little bit but once that egg was finished, I think I felt my blood pressure rising. Still good nonetheless.\n\nAlbondigas a la Feria ($14): Three pieces of duck and pork meatballs topped with crispy shallots. The crispy shallots complimented the meatballs quite well but that may be a biased opinion because I just loveeeee fried shallots. The meatball was a little overcooked but still enjoyable.\n\nPulpo a la Parilla ($14): A wood fire grilled octopus that was actually really good, I just wish it was more grilled throughout the octopus and not just at the tip of the tentacle. \n\nThen the paella....\n\nThe menu, as well as our server, informed us that it would take about 30 minutes for it to come out which was fine. Lo and behold it only took 1.5 hours, guys. It had already taken almost an hour for our three tapas plates to come out and our octopus was almost forgotten about and our server never knew we haven't received it. Why? Because he never checked up on us to see how we were doing. Great service, right?\n\nWhen paella came out, it was lukewarm like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The rice was straight up burnt and hard to chew and shallow. All the ingredients within the paella was burnt and the sausage tasted like rubber. I called our the server to let him know about the paella and he said, \"let me get my manager\". The manager comes over and asks us what's wrong with it. I said nicely said, \"all the dishes we had was really good except the paella. Everything is just burnt and it's difficult to eat.\" He says, \"Oh really? Did you want another one?\" And we said we didn't want to wait another hour and a half for it. He insists that it won't take that long but we said no. Then he left. Never once did we get an apology from either the server or the manager for the bad execution of the paella. \n\nThe entire time service was incredibly slow and our server rude and had a bad attitude. We never complained about the service or asked where our food was. We waited patiently. And still the guy treated us like lower tier customers. After we had sent away the paella did he FINALLY smile and treat us like royalty. It was so incredibly fake and posh. He gave us complimentary dessert that consisted of cheesecake pops dipped in caramel. Whatever milk they used was so sour and rancid that I almost gagged it out on the table but immediately remembered that I was in public so I held it in. \n\nI rarely experience bad service (minus your hole in the wall Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant -- they don't count) and never have I sent back a dish no matter how bad it was...until this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-06", "description": "I've been hearing about this place for a while and made reservations 2 weeks in advance.  The place is definitely popular given how crowded it was on a Wednesday night.  We had 6 tapas between 2 people and it was more than enough.  Felt a little pressured by our waiter to get the 6th dish which we ended up taking home.  \n\nI would definitely recommend:\n\n- Sea and Mountain open face sandwich if you love sea urchin as much as I do.  Very generous portion of sea urchin!\n- Wood-Grilled Octopus is absolutely stunning.  A huge piece of octopus made to perfection.  We've never tasted octopus that was so flavorful and so easy to bite into.  \n\nThe other dishes we got were just OK:\n\n- Bikini brioche is definitely delicious, but also very rich and filling.  It really makes it hard to eat anything else after you've had it. \n- Sunny side-up huervo is an interesting dish in theory, but I felt that it was drenched in oil and made it less enjoyable to eat as a small dish.  I also expected more complex flavors, but I was just mostly tasting the \"crispy potato\" or as I like to call, shoestring fries.\n- Duck and pork meatballs were again very tasty, but nothing too memorable.  It was also our 6th dish, so by then, we really had no stomach to enjoy it.  \n- Yellow cauliflower steak lacked flavor.  I felt that the \"coal roasted romescu sauce\" would be much better on an actual steak, felt a little wasted on cauliflower.  \n\nLastly, the place is quite loud and can get pretty touristy.  However, the view is amazing and the food is definitely worth checking out.", "author": "Yue X."}

Each time I am surprised this level of service is allowed.  The waiters are cold and disinterested, often to the point where it makes the group uneasy.  When I went for dinner, it was for a group of five.  The dishes ordered sometimes only had 3 or 4 of each item, and we were fine with adding some so everyone got a piece for some dishes, whereas on other dishes we were fine with it as is. Later, as we continued to order, the waiter no longer asked us and simply added items to each dish and charged us accordingly.  As we didn't know how many each dish came with and we were fine with sharing, we had no idea until we received the bill. \n\nThis is unacceptable.  We ordered a fairly large amount of items so was the waiter simply trying to pad the bill more?  Strange and tacky for this supposed caliber of restaurant.", "author": "whatever I."}

You want to love it - it's Michael Chiarello, after all. I'm sure if Michael himself was back there cooking, it would be 5 stars, but the execution both times we've been here was below what we get at many lesser-known, less expensive places in the city. For example, we recently ordered the paella. Compared to your average paella, I would expect a Chiarello-inspired paella to have that extra something that just puts it in a master-chef category. Instead, it was barely average. The rice was cooked perfectly - crunchy on top and on the bottom of the pan, but the seafood was dry. It even looked dry when it came out. Given how expensive it is, I'd be willing to pay the little extra for something hard to find as good anywhere else, but that's just not the case.", "author": "Bib G."}

There are other seating choices, I'd ask for them next time.\n\nThat folded piece of paper is your menu. Not easy to read, tres trendoid , and a bit like a cheap place. The book is a wine list, and it has some very interesting and good wines at not great prices, but, what the hey, you're out for some fun, eh?\n\nThe food, some of which is great, costs about $2.50 per bite.\nThat's the price for the cute little skewers that come out on a board, and they're so cute, and tasty, too, as Lucy said years ago. \n\nThe wine comes in these complicated/clever beakers, and at $12 and way up per glass, the Dishwasher is welcome. Good wines, however. \n\nLast year in Spain I wondered when the cuisine would blow up, and here it is. This place is not less than 4-5 star pricing. The raw cost of the items presented gives you an idea of what it costs to open a place like this thesedays. At these prices, one might be better off saving ones funds and going to Spain. Or eating in other SF Spanish tapas places.\n\nSure, the rent's expensive, Michael Chiarello is around, and it's new.

It's sure to be a long-standing hit in San Francisco as Michael Chiarello knows how to orchestrate a wonderfully tasty menu of Spanish tapas in an elegant setting with a strong cooking team and servers.\n\nWe were lucky to be seated at the counter in front of the kitchen as the chef and his team turned out dish after dish, meal after meal impeccably.  I couldn't stop staring at Michael Chiarello as I was totally star-struck!  But we got to drink wine with him through these hand-crafted glass thinly fluted flasks (I was a little scared because you have to hold it up at an angle while it thinly streams to your mouth, it was red wine, I had a white cardigan on, you get the picture - but I did fine, woo!).  He gave us good food choice recommendations and we chatted a bit (nevertheless, I was still star-struck and could not staring at him, ha!).  \n\nWe ordered a number of small dishes, but these were the definite highlights of the night:\n\n* Sunny Side-Up Egg with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing\n\n*  Grilled Razor Clams with meyer lemon and wild ramps\n\n*  Cured Cod Crudo with tomato fresco, hearts of palm, arugula, and whole citrus dressing\n\nClassy great-tasting dishes with that extra touch of something special.  I will definitely come back!  In fact, my friend are making plans to come back very soon because we want to try everything on the menu!  \n\nNote: I would have given Coqueta 5 stars, but I was very turned off by the unprofessional hostess (I didn't catch her name, but by the time she reads this, she will know who she is and I hope she learns from her mistakes).  I make tons of reservations on Open Table, and I made my first Coqueta reservation on a Thursday evening at 5:30.  I checked OT that morning and yes, it was still there and confirmed.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess said she did not see my reservation and that she saw that I supposedly changed it to the following Thursday.  No, no I didn't.  After \"investigating\" for a full second, she threw her hands up like there was nothing she could do and when my full party arrived that she could try to fit me in for a table but it would be a 45 minute wait (she cancelled the switched reservation for the following Thursday, I knew there must've been some kind of mistake and she probably cancelled somebody else's reservation).  \n\nWhat?  Unheard of.  My friend was late so it wasn't like I could argue yet.  When she arrived, I explained my situation to a kind waitress who then went back to the hostess and then came back with the same answer.  I was already thinking about what I was going to write in my Yelp review regarding this.  But then! - the manager came up to me and apologized, said our drinks while we were waiting for our table were complimentary as a restaurant staff member had inavertently changed my reservation for someone who coincidentally had my same last name.  I guess there is some way that they can track changes made on OT.  So, the manager got us our awesome seating in front of Michael Chiarello and all was forgotten as I appreciated how he handled the situation and took the time to see what actually happened.  But!  I hope that hostess learns from this and realizes how unprofessional she was.  People remember how good the food was, but bad service, including *bad hostessing*, kind of stays with you longer.  Also, I had to follow up with OT to receive my 100 points for my reservation since she cancelled it in the system.  \n\nOther than that whole experience, I would give Coqueta 5 stars for the food, the manager who handled the situation well and for Mr. Chiarello of course!!

Went here on a whim and saw Coqueta with an almost empty bar -- miracles do happen.  No reservations -- just walked in with 3 adults and 2 young kids and were seated very promptly.  Wouldn't have guessed that this is a popular restaurant with tough-to-snag, 1 month-in-advance Opentable reservations. Mum is definitely a lucky charm!\n\nDefinitely had high expectations, considering that not only is this Michael Chiarello's first foray into Spanish cuisine, it also won him Esquire's Chef of the Year.  At the bar, service was unpretentious but very friendly.  Our server recommended the chicken and English pea croquetas and patatas bravas for the kids -- it disappeared in minutes (blame the adults); we ordered a second round!  The baby beets with watercress and blue cheese was artfully displayed, also gone in 60 seconds.  My husband and mom loved the grilled beef shortribs with sherry-chocolate glaze. We also ordered 2 of Michael's favorites -- the Whole Monterey calamari was soft and tasty, but the star of the show for me was the \"Mar y montana -- sea and mountain\".  This dish consisted of toast with iberico lardo and jamon iberico, gently melted over -- get this -- sea urchin. If there is one dish to define the chef's menu, I would choose this. I'm still dreaming about it.\n\nTop that off with a great bar menu (we had the sangria and margarita), and we can conclude that Coqueta is worth the hype!

I would not suggest coming to this restaurant without a reservation...or ANY hot SF restaurant for that matter. The bar is okay to sit at, but you wont get the full Coqueta experience.  \n\nSometimes Celebrity Chef restaurants can be a little iffy. Michael Chiarello, on the other hand, is a GENIUS! This place is phenomenal. \n\nBefore the restaurant opened, I waited and waited for reservation announcements - especially because the restaurant was going to feature PAELLA! When they were finally announced, I was lucky enough to score a reservation on a Sat night at 9pm one week after they opened! Not going to lie, I felt like I hit the lottery.\n\nIt is located on Pier 5, waterfront, with one of the best views in all of SF. When you walk in, the bar is to the left and the restaurant to the right. It is dim lit, and a lot of wood decor. They took us a while to seat us, which sucked a little bit because I was hungry. Excuse me; STARVING! The manager made it up to us by buying rounds of drinks as we waited. A gesture like that from a manager goes a long way to me. That is what you call GREAT customer service.\n\nThe food is AMAZING! Even though I am a meat lover the item you should not miss out on is the CRISPY SHRIMP! We ended up ordering several of these plates. Wood-grilled octopus is a close second! All in all, everything we tried was great. The sunny side up egg, patatas bravas, and even the Pluma - Iberico Pork! I have been to Spain and must say this place is pretty damn good. Remember, this is a Tapas restaurant...which means small plates. But it is more about the quality rather than the quantity.\n\nAs If the food wasn't enough wait until you try the drinks! They have house-made gin and tonics!! I would have never thought you could get a hand crafted drink on the Pier! Think Bourbon and Branch, Novela, Bergerac, and/or Alembic. I would start with the Bar\u00e7a Gintonic and Tariff! Then move on to the Death of the Summer Love & Engine No 5! Instead of dessert, top of your stay with a Liquid Nitrogen Sangria! There is no where else in SF where you can get that!\n\nWhat did disappoint me was they told me they had ran out of Paella!! That was the MAIN REASON why I came. Instead, the waitress suggested the Arroz Cremosa. That too was good, but my heart was set on having Paella. Regardless, the food was great and HAVE to be back to try the paella.

I'm not sure if they have them on the regular menu but the little donuts with raspberry sprinkle were like nothing I've ever tasted before! I love sugar donuts and the raspberry were such a perfect combination to give it a sweet flavor. \n\nThe only reason I couldn't give five stars was because I was there for a private event but I have a feeling I will be updating this post to a five star in my future!  I really want to go back to San Fran just to go back to Coqueta! \n\nPs I love the name! Flirt is how I felt about everything at Coqueta.

It is hard to get a table in the dining room and, unless you get there early, the small bar seating area is usually packed as well.  It's a bit hard to eat in the bar area, especially at the seats that line the perimeter.  \n\nThe drinks menu is quite interesting, with cocktails I'd never seen before.  There is also a section devoted solely to gin libations, which I found surprising since I don't associate this particular spirit with Spain.  One such drink was a small batch gin and artisanal grapefruit tonic water, served in a huge squat glass with juniper berries, flowers and wedge of pink grapefruit.  It was beautifully presented and actually quite tasty, especially considering that I generally dislike gin. \n\nWanting to try the house Sangria, which had a very appealing description in the menu, I was disappointed to learn that they were out.  Mind you, this was at 4:30 on a Thursday.  How can a Spanish restaurant not have Sangria?  Particularly when they make it ahead of time and keg it.\n\nGetting past that disappointment, it was time to focus on the food.  This is what was ordered for 3 people:\n\n--Cheese and cured meat platter\n--Beef and duck meatballs\n--Tatas Bravas\n--Pluma (heirloom pork loin, roasted and served with a chili glaze)\n\nEverything was very tasty, although I found the tatas lacking.  They were prepared like tater tots, but not very crispy or flavorful.  The dipping sauce made up for this, at least partially.  I found the meatballs to be the best dish ordered.  They were incredibly juicy and loaded with flavor.  The crispy shallots on top and the cherry Tempranillo sauce providing an excellent complement.\n\nI'd definitely like to come here again and hopefully eat in the beautifully rustic dining room with open kitchen.", "author": "Bryce B."}

The menu has an extensive array of hot and cold tapas as well as larger entrees, which makes choosing that much more difficult since the prices are not exactly friendly.\n\nWe started with the famous gin and tonic, which comes in a beautiful glass decorated with flowers and grapefruit. The drink is mixed really well, so I barely tasted the gin and instead got fragrant floral and fruity notes. Next, we ordered both the smoked salmon and sea urchin open-faced sandwiches. These were essentially like crostini, and the better of the two was definitely the smoked salmon. The salmon was paired perfectly with goat cheese, which was then drizzled with a sweet truffle honey that brought it all together. The sea urchin was supposed to be a land and sea pairing, layered with thinly sliced prosciutto. The urchin was a little overpowering for me, with a disproportionate amount of briney flavor that wasn't exactly counterbalanced by the meat. We also had the English pea and chicken croquettes, which had a great flavor and was perfectly crispy on the outside. The dish that I liked the least was probably the shrimp and sunny side up egg over crispy potatoes and chorizo dressing. The chorizo was too salty for me, and the crispy potatoes along with the fried egg made the dish greasy and heavy. \n\nHowever, the meal as a whole was fun and unique. Coqueta is definitely a great spot to have drinks and snack on quality tapas, and I'll definitely be back to try their other dishes.", "author": "Ashley T."}

That was tasty too, although we asked our waiter for whatever cocktail they were making with liquid nitrogen over there, and the drinks were not cold so we are not sure if he understood what we meant because there was nothing liquid nitrogeny about them.  Either way, they were really good.\n\nFor food we had the shishito peppers with the serrano ham.  They were good, but I felt that the dish was more about the ham than the peppers, which may have been what they were going for.  Either way, I felt the shishitos were too mushy, and not turgid enough.  They were not toothsome.  Flavor combo was good as long as you had ham and peppers in the same bite, but the only problem was that there were more peppers than pieces of ham, so that was kind of hard to achieve.\n\nWe also had the manchego bites for a dessert dish and those were FAB!  I think they may have been coated in carmel or something sweet, and the manchego was nice and supple inside.  The saltiness of the cheese was cut nicely by the sugary coating.  They were served on a stick kind of like a lollipop that you didn't lick.  Totally unique dish.

(NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE BARTENDER AND MANAGER)\n\nI made reservations for Saturday, Oct 11 for my wife's 40th Birthday.  We arrived about 30 minutes early to have some drinks and quickly made our way to the bar.  I had read about the \"Championship Policy\" and wanted to try it while my wife had a \"Galleon.\"  \n\nWhen I received my drink it seemed like there was BARELY 2 oz in the glass which was disappointing considering it was $13.  I immediately questioned why people made good reviews about it.  My wife's drink was a watered down gin and tonic at best.\n\nWe were sat a bit early at our table next to three gals who were celebrating a birthday as well.  They immediately struck up conversation with us and wanted to show us their \"glistening\" drink.  I asked what it was and it turns out it was also a \"Championship Policy.\"  I was confused as to why they had triple the pour and as I looked a table to my left I noticed another drink similar to theirs.  The girls said my drink was weak because I didn't show up in a short skirt, maybe they knew something I didn't...  \n\nI called our server over and asked why such a drastic difference in how the drink was made.  I got a \"beat-around-the-bush\" answer and she returned later with a drink similar to the others I had seen.  I also ordered a \"Sun Never Goes Down\" for my wife which once again seemed short on the pour.  I now regretted the good tip I had left the bartender.  (Taller bald guy)\n\nThe food overall was great.   We both tried each of the bite size skewers - we probably could have ate a platter of them.  The \"Sunny Side Up Huevo\" was good enough to punch someone in the face or fight over, we should have ordered two.  We also shared the albondigas and gambas al negro which were very good as well.  My wife really enjoyed the salmon ahumado which I didn't think would be much but turned out to be outstanding.  (Another dish we should have ordered twice)  I was able to have the mar y montana dish to myself since my wife isn't a huge fan of uni.  To finish the manchego cheesecake is everything the reviews say it is and the churro was great as well.\n\nWhen our check arrived I was about to sign it and add tip without even looking at it.  As I checked for the tax to help me calculate tip I noticed a number of drinks added to our bill that we didn't order which added up to an ADDITIONAL $95!\n\nI called the server over and she told me the bartender had transferred those drinks to our tab.  I explained that I had closed my tab after my first order of drinks and showed her the receipt.  At that point the table next to us was listening in and offering their condolences as our server returned with our adjusted tab with little more than a \"sorry about that.\"  The manager (blonde lady in all black) walked by right after that and I explained what had occurred from our initial drinks to the discrepancy in our tab.  She seemed to be bothered that I was sharing our experience and asked \"well, did you get it fixed?\"  I responded \"yes\" and she replied \"great, hope to see you again.\"\n\nI'd expect that type of experience at an Olive Garden.....", "author": "R K."}

Was far and away one of the best tapas dining experiences I've ever had! If you can't get a reservation, they also do walk-ins, but you risk a pretty long wait depending on how busy the night is, and they are constantly packed.\n\nOrdered: cured Serrano meats, Mar y montana open face sandwiches, Huevos Nacional, Coliflor con Romescu, \"Bikini\", \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo, and Pulpo a la Parilla\n\nHighlights included:\n- Beautiful gin and tonics (I ordered three of them and thoroughly enjoyed all of them)\n- Mar y montana open face sandwiches were to die for: essentially an open-faced uni sandwich and probably one of the most mouthwatering things I've ever eaten\n- Coliflor con Romescu: a cauliflower steak accompanied by Romescu sauce.. never had cauliflower with such explosive flavors! It was definitely one of my favorite dishes that night\n- Pulpo a la Parilla: the grilled octopus was tender and juicy and had great flavoring to it\n\nI thought the Sunny Side-up Huevo was a little too salty, and everything else, though delicious, I could do without ordering again (just based on personal preference; they were still excellent dishes).\n\nWe wanted to try the Spanish rice dish but were told it takes a long time to prepare and that they had to free up our table for the next party. I believe they have a limit of 90 minutes when you're dining there and it's easy to see why. We had stayed for 2 hours at that point and were still trying to order the rest of the menu... haha. The ambiance is elegant but casual; perfect for some nibbles and drinks after a day of work.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that portion sizes are SMALL. These are tapas and are not meant to fill you up or serve as an entire main dinner. If you're looking for that, try some of their larger-sized items. The party next to us ordered a paella and it looked absolutely fantastic.\n\nTotal bill came out to $146 before tip for 2 people, inclusive of 5 cocktails between the two of us, and I thought it was well, well spent.

I had to ask my fiance to not drink the chocolate dipping sauce and try to maintain what dignity we had left after plowing through all the great food.

The restaurant is quite beautiful especially with the ocean view, tall buildings, and night lights from the bridge.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 PM and waited 20 minutes on a Friday night which was not bad at all considering it's the prime time on the prime day to eat out. Our seat was not bad and was actually quite desirable and much to everyone's liking.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nEL PLAT CAP ($26): This is the chef's selection of cured meats. This was excellent, I'll have to say but not that interesting. The meats specially selected were salami, prosciutto, and one that resembled salami but with a tinge of red orange. They gave 18 pieces, six of each type. The presentation was spot on with a piece of menu cut up and the wooden board it was served on giving a rustic feel. Though the quality was top notch, for $26 it wasn't worth it.\n\nSUNNY SIDE-UP EGG ($12): This was very innovative if you ask me. I love the idea of shoestring crispy potatoes piled high with fried egg, shrimp, and chorizo dressing. I don't know why or what it so special but the combination worked. This reminded me of a breakfast item since there were hash browns (crispy potato) and fried egg.\n\nGRILLED RAZOR CLAMS ($14): This was amazing and was one of the best dishes of the night. This is a very rare find and cannot be found at any place I can think of. The clams had the perfect consistency, were juicy, and given in a generous portion. Highly recommended!\n\nWOOD-GRILLED OCTOPUS OCTOPUS ($12): This was amazing and the version at Evvia in Palo Alto was comparable. It was so simplistic yet so delicious. It wasn't rubbery and was tender and very moist. \n\nGAUCHO ($80): This was probably my least favorite dish of the night but was great for meat lovers. It was a special and was basically a hunk of steak cut up. It was cooked perfectly; not too done or too rare. However, it was filling and boring since meat I can go elsewhere for. They gave a generous portion of six pieces but again I wouldn't pay $80 for something I'm not too keen on. \n\nPAELLA ($40): This was so good in every aspect. They gave a great portion and the flavors from the shellfish seeped into the paella which made it tasty. The ingredients added, asparagus, chorizo, gulf prawns, clams, and lemon aioli, made sense with the dish. The concept was new to me and the moment I ate it I fell in love and have tried to find places that serve it let alone replicate it. The closest I've found was Jaleo in Las Vegas but that didn't even compare to the quality I found here.\n\nJAMON PINTXO ($2.50): This was prosciutto wrapped around two pieces of manchego cheese topped with apricot jam. I never thought that a combination like this would taste so good. It was innovative, sweet (from the apricot jam), and salty (from the cheese and prosciutto).\n\nWARM CHOCOLATE CAKE ($10): For any chocolate lovers, I recommend ordering a couple of these. It was very good and the assorted nuts on the side were a great touch to the overall presentation, which was beautiful as always. There was some sauce on the top; a perfect finish to the perfect presentation of the perfect dessert.\n\nMANCHEGO CHEESECAKE ($4): I didn't try this but it looked very innovative yet a bit sweet for my taste. The addition of caramel popcorn was nice. My brother confirmed it was sweet but enjoyed it nonetheless. They provided two smaller pieces which was fair for the price.\n\nPAN CON CHOCOLATE ($4): This had ice cream cookie on the bottom with olive oil ice cream on the top. It paired quite nicely and was delicious. My only gripe was that parts of the olive oil ice cream were saltier. It kind of threw me off but nevertheless it was a brilliant combination.\n\nCOFFEE ($6): They serve Four Barrel coffee which is top notch. Though, I didn't sample this, my dad enjoyed it. The cup they provided it in was very innovative because the glass around the cup prevented customers from burning themselves. \n\nSERVICE: They were really courteous which was expected. They paced everything out very well and made our night an unforgettable one. \n\nDECOR: There are two sides of the restaurant whereas one side is more of a wine bar where the exterior is reminiscent of a green house with beautiful glass windows. Another side is more like a formal dining hall and is for those hoping for a proper meal. Though a bit loud, it adds to the overall experience. No matter which side you get, you should make the most out of your experience because everything from the service to the atmosphere to the innovative creations courtesy of chef Michael Chiarello, is like none you've had before and truly is a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".\n\nWill I return? Yes please! Though the experience is over and it came out to $50 per person it was well worth it because as I said it's a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".

There didn't seem to be any tables that were away from the hustle and bustle of this restaurant that is constantly in motion. Almost doubling the square footage is an outdoor atrium area with communal tables, small bar tables and the bar. While it felt like we were in a perpetually busy SF bar, a few cocktails got us focused on the menu...\nTo start was the lamb/pork meatballs, branzino and the grilled mushrooms. The meatballs were crazy good. They had a sweet finish on the top that made these truly unique. I have never had branzino before but this fish was cooked perfectly. It seemed to lack a little seasoning but tasted fantastic nonetheless. I didn't know that so much flavor could be extracted from cooked mushrooms. I wasn't super excited for this course but it ended up being one of the best dishes of the night. Some awesome flavors going on there. \nAfter a couple more of their famous gin and tonics it was off to the cheese selection and the croquettes. The croquettes were a perfectly crispy mouthful of pot pie heaven. Finally the cheese was just eh. Nothing super unique. There was a manchego and a blue cheese. Probably the only dish I coulda done without. \nI somehow didn't have room for the churro that we were food porning all dinner but that just gives me a reason to go back soon.  The setup seemed a little clunky but as long as ur not looking for an ultra quiet date spot, coqueta hit all the points for a fantastic taste of some Spanish tapas.", "author": "Mark N."}

We didn't have reservations for a Tuesday night but luckily quickly got an outside table (bar and outside seating are first-come, first-served). \n\nThe cocktail menu is impressive on account of its extensive and creative combinations. I ordered the \"Dirty by the Sea\" martini, and the server immediately remarked, 'you know, it's very briny.\" I should have heeded his warning, as the drink, while beautiful, was essentially like drinking seawater. Is this drink intended to be enjoyed, or even consumed (I literally imagined a scorecard in back where they track who actually orders/drinks this drink). I ended up finishing it for the sake of my own pride, not in the least bit to complement any of our food (what goes with seaweed juice anyway?). My sister tried \"In the Haight,\" which had far too many strong, complex flavors going on to truly appreciate it. Thumbs down on the drinks. I couldn't help but think they skipped the focus group part of testing out their cocktail menu. In retrospect, it's not a good sign if the staff is warning you against ordering something.\n\nThe food came out quickly and was presented nicely. They were out of uni, so we couldn't try the lardo/uni open-face sandwich. The chicken croquets and \"fantasia de fideua\" were nice and flavorful. The smoked salmon open-face sandwich was tasty, but my sister pointed it out it was much like eating a fancy bagel (the montaditos are curiously served atop what are akin to mini-bagels). Anchovy skewers, pimientos de pardon and the trio of grilled sausages were just ok. Sideways thumbs on the food.\n\nThe service - ugh - was on the brusque side. If it was possible for a server to smirk simultaneously at you and your order, that happens here.\n\nI was expecting robust (perhaps even unique) flavors and tempting bites that left me wanting more. I was underwhelmed. They say \"coqueta\"means \"flirt\" in Spanish; needless to say, I won't be pursuing this relationship.", "author": "Janet W."}

The food and bar menu is unique but a hit or miss.\n\nThe order:\n\nLiminada - refreshing & surprising with rosemary sprig & blueberries. Hit.\n\nHard apple cider Tilted Shed - awesome pairing with the food. Hit.\n\n$40 paella! - totally not worth it.  Salty, burnt, and dry rice with overcooked sausage and clams.  The peppers served on the side & 4 prawns on the dish were good.  $40?!?!\n\nPatatas bravas - crispy potato balls served with a dollop of aioli and a nice sauce.  Hit. \n\nThe whole monterey Calamari was the best tapas dish we ordered.  It's served whole and seasoned with something that makes your taste buds want more.  Big hit.\n\nDuck meatballs - soft tender juicy served medium.  Pretty good.\n\nSmoked salmon open faced sandwhich - smoked salmon served with queso fresco and a touch of truffle honey on a crunchy toasted piece of bread, x2 mini bagel sized bites; twas was ok.\n\nChurro fantasy - best dessert ever!  I wish it came with a dozen little churros.\n\nThe paella was unfortunately one big miss, big enough to make me NOT want to go back. Despite the other good dishes & drinks we had, I left feeling unsatisfied and that's  pretty disappointing after paying a $$$ bill.  If it wasn't for the $40!? paella this rating would have been a decent 4 stars.  \n\nWhen it comes down to Chiarello's restaurants, I would rather go to Bottega in Napa.

That and the food and drinks are actually delicious.\n\nThe biggest problem with this place is the service. This review is specifically for the evening service on Saturday, Oct 4.\n\nWe opted for outdoor seating. The service out there is horrendous. It took us forever to even get someone's attention to take our order. I actually had to go inside and ask someone if anyone was taking care of the outdoor area (after which I was told 'someone would be there soon'). \n\nMarco ended up taking care of us. He wasn't even a server or supposed to be out there, but he was helping out because it was so busy. He ended up taking our order, serving us, and handling our bill for the entire night. He was SO nice and apologetic and provided some really great service -- thank you Marco! It's awesome when people step up and do more than what's asked to help a team get the job done.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the team didn't have the same mindset. There was a tall waiter with a ponytail/bun who was extremely unhelpful. The host that night was also really unhelpful -- we went to him to try to settle our bill since no one was coming to take it. All he said was \"Uh, I think you should do that through your waiter.\" Umm... well, we didn't actually HAVE a waiter, and if someone comes to you and says that, that probably means that something is wrong with the service, and you should try to help us.\n\nOh, and another thing -- there were a few other servers who kept serving us the wrong dishes -- which was not a problem at all, we just had to tell them it wasn't for us. They were clearly exasperated with something and weren't happy with the service that night either. One actually rolled his eyes and sighed heavily when we told him the dish wasn't ours. \n\nWhoever is the manager of this place needs to get this act together. Staff better, train better, do something. It's such a shame because the actual food and drinks were great, as was the ambiance. Too bad the restaurant is just poorly managed.\n\nIn case you're curious, food we ate:\n\nSunny-side huevos - awesome\nPulpo - good\nUni open face sandwich - awesome\nCroquetas - awesome\nArroz cremosa - meh, extremely under-seasoned\nAlbondigas - super awesome", "author": "Rhea K."}

This was my first visit so I had no idea if a reservation is needed, so I made one just in case. \n\nWe decided to split a bunch of tapas. Chicken & English Pea Croquetas, Wood-Grilled Octopus w/ Fingerling Potatoes, Tattas Bravas, Sunny Side up eggs with shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing, Mar y montana (sea urchin and jamon on bread). Each dish is small (probably around 3-4 bites per person split between two...for us at least). Out of these dished, I would definitely order the sunny side up egg and the octopus again. These two are the memorable dishes for me and I would come back for those. \n\nWe also ended up getting the flan and churros for dessert after. The flan was rich and creamy and the churros were great with a dark chocolate dipping sauce. All this, plus a mojito and 250 ml of wine came out to just over $100. Expensive? Absolutely.  Would I come back? Probably, but only once in a while since my wallet can't afford a $100 lunch frequently.", "author": "Janny N."}

Grilled sausages glazed with isastegi cider, apple and mojo verde. Very, very good if you are into sausages and blood sausage to be more specific.

It was still buzzing with diners and revelers at the bar attached outdoors.  Enjoyed our late night tapa tasting, however, felt everything was overprice for what you get:\n\n- uni/iberico ham combo open sandwich -- sandwich is a misnomer. It's pretty much an amuse bouche of 2 bite sized nibbles.  Flavor was great and uni was very fresh. My favorite dish of the night.\n- Crispy shrimp was too oily, consisted mostly of dough and was hard pressed to find shrimp in the oily mess. Prefer the shrimp cake at Delica in the Ferry Building\n- Woodfired grill octopus -- really tender and enjoyed the dish. However, for $12, we only had 8 tiny pieces that were roughly half the size of my thumb. =( Other posts had much larger portions.

I tried all summer and had to settle on a Monday at 5:30pm, which was the last table. Friends of mine say to just show up and ask how long the wait is and then wait a moment at the bar. The restaurant reserves some tables for walk ups. Well, we were on a date night with a sitter watching our kids at home so we didn't have that kind of time! We need certainty. \n\nPerfect ambiance. Great location by the Pier. \n\nWe started off with the Barca Gin Tonic - very good and refreshing. Highly recommend. Then I had the Galleon which was a little more citrusy but refreshing. My least favorite was the Tariff a little too intense for me. \n\nEl Plat Cap de Queso which are Chef's selection of cheeses was outstanding and served with olive oil tortas and marcona almonds (yum)\n\nGazpacho Gelatina - this was good as I had never had a dish like this. Sweet tomatoes with gelee of gazpacho consome. \n\nPatatas Bravas - crisy new potatoes in a salsa and garlic alioli.  This was ok. My husband said this was his least favorite. I guess he doesn't jump for joy for potatoes.\n\nCroquetas de Pollo - my favorite dish. So crunchy on the outside and creamy inside. Delightful!\n\nPimientos de Padron- roasted peppers with Jamon Serrano. I really like this dish. Not spicy. \n\nGambas al Negros - gulf prawns (head on) with black garlic and chili sauce. This was soo yummy. They serve with three little toasts.\n\nSunny side-up Huevo - basically an sunny side up egg, shrimp, and string potatoes which they mix table side. This was a little salty for me but my husband liked it. \n\nOur evening ended with Churro Fantasia which was a crispy Spanish donut (there are four bite size) with hot chocolate to dip and berry powder. The Manchego cheesecake was my favorite. Small and bite size and served with caramel popcorn. I love anything caramel popcorn. \n\nFabulous dinner. Highly recommend.", "author": "Lauren W."}

It lost two stars from me for the following reasons:\n\nWe made a reservation at 7pm, and didn't got to sit down til 7:30pm. Understand that it's a popular restaurant, but not good enough for 5 stars on Yelp. \n\nWe wanted to order the uni burger, but it was sold out. Really? The most popular item on the menu was sold out by 7:30pm on a Saturday night? You need to improve your inventory management! \n\nLast but not least, our waiter spent the entire night socializing and sharing his personal stories with the table sitting right next to us. The other table was only a foot away, and we heard everyone of course. TMI! He paid so much attention to the other table that he forgot to check on us...\n\nAll in all, I liked the food we ordered, and would recommend it to people who like Tapas.

I treated my boyfriend out here recently, using our anniversary as an excuse. \n\nReservations was relatively easy as I booked only a month in advance. Parking is easy now that on Sunday's, meters are free. \n\nWe were seated at an awkward table - we kept falling off our table but that might have been due to our own clumsiness. ;)\n\nWe ordered the huevo with shrimp, pork & duck meatballs, and the gaucho steak. The huevo was delicious. The pork & duck meatballs were very underwhelming and I regretted the order. \n\nThe steak was very, very good! They brought out the slab of rib eye and asked if we wanted to have it cut. We did request to have it sliced. While it took a long time to bring it back sliced, it was done excellently and topped with cilantro. \n\nI was very touched that at the end of our meal, the staff was nice enough to give us complimentary dessert: cheesecake bites with handwritten \"congratulations\" on chocolate. \n\nOverall, I felt the food was lacking for the menu prices.

We opted to do a 10:15 reservation since we were going to get a few drinks at a new bar afterwards. \n\nWe had the option for a table or at the chef's bar and since Michael Chiarello was in the kitchen, it was a no brainer to opt for the bar! He greeted us as we sat and chatted with him for a few min. Great guy, humble and easy to talk to. The place was buzzing and crowded as it should be! \n\nService was great and impeccable.

I'm on a business trip and went there without a reservation to grab a bite at the \"bar\" by the kitchen.  The waitress was so nice and accommodating, I rarely have been treated so well when seated as a single patron in a restaurant.  \n\nThe food was delicious and creative while not trying too hard to be fancy (see Bellota which was over the top ridiculous - how many ingredients can fit in one dish?).  Back to Coqueta - simple, fresh ingredients done just right.  The grilled octopus was the best I've ever had.  Could use a little more flavor from the accompanying infused olive oil, but the tender meat was good enough to satisfy without anything else added.  The chicken croquetas were crispy on the outside, gooey in the middle - like a bite of fried chicken pot pie, but better.\n\nThe deviled eggs were good, although the yolk mixture seemed a bit thick and heavy, maybe a skip on this one next time.  At the end of the meal, a yummy bite of manchego cheesecake was perfect combination of sweet, salty and richness.  I can't wait to go back.\n\nWhy the missing star?

I plan to return to try the paella and grilled steak. But here was my dinner:\n\nChicken Croquettes - they look like like tater tots: crispy and delicious but way better. 3 croquettes come in each order.\n\nRoasted Padron Peppers with Jamon Serrano - this is mainly a pepper dish, with just a few slivers of jamon sprinkled on top. It was one of my favorites. Simple and slightly lemony.\n\nGulf Prawns with black garlic and chili sauce - MUST ORDER if you're a shrimp freak like me. The head-on prawns were soft and super flavorful because of the sauce, which you can dip the accompanying 3 slices of toasted bread into. 3 prawns come in each order. \n\nSunny Side up Huevo w/ Shrimp - by far the most unusual dish but really delicious. A small platter of shrimp, sunny side up fried egg, and slivers of shoe string potatoes (?) arrives at your table. The waitress then promptly mixes it all together so that the egg yolk blends into the dish, like a casserole. Really yummy. \n\nWood grilled octopus w/ fingerling potatoes - this was good but not as spectacular as the others. \n\nBikini - Best way to describe this: think small round warm flatbread, with roasted eggplant, cheese, and preserved fruit in the middle, then wrapped up like a taco.  It's a fun little dish that tastes surprisingly rich and decadent. 2 'tacos' come in each order. \n\nArroz Cremoso de Verano - I think this is the spanish version of risotto. It's creamy and has chopped squash on top, with a sprinkle of some green herbs on top. Very good. \n\nAnd last but not least, churros for dessert. Light and crispy, it comes with a small side of warm chocolate sauce for dipping. \n\nI left Coqueta extremely satisfied.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-23", "description": "What an amazing experience here at Coqueta. Coqueta is a modern styles Resturant that now has a refreshing and tasteful new menu introduced to us by top chef Michael Chiarello. You may know him from many popular tv shows on the food network. Mr. Chiarello delivers to you, with every plate an adventure for you're taste buds. A worth wild experience, one that my wife and I truly enjoyed.\n\nThis Restuarant specializes in high-end Spanish cuisine. There servings are styled in the form of Tapas, meaning small plates. This comes in handy because most of the entr\u00e9es are in bite-size forms which allows the customers to experience and taste more items on the menu. It's refreshing and a welcomed break then the standard style, which is a singular dish with your traditional starter and appetizers.\n\nMy first bit of advice is to always make a reservation for this restaurant. Regardless of what day of the week or time it is, this Resturant is consistently packed and always busy. Although my wife and I made our reservation two weeks in advance, we still had a 45 minute wait time to be seated. Normally this would be the formula for disaster that would make anybody frustrated. But with the beautiful views it allowed us to relax and take in the beauty of the pier area. What made it even better was the fact that the host at the time (I wish I got his name) gave us a complimentary glass of champagne on the house. This was his way of apologizing for the long wait. That gesture alone speaks volumes of how they see there clientele. A definite great first impression.\n\nWhen we finally were seated we were introduced to a young lady name Brooklyn. Her energy and knowledge of the menu was outstanding and one that I definitely tip my hat off to her for. She was professional and very attentive to my wife and I. She even catered to our needs (including photos with chef Michael Chiarello). She constantly made sure to check on us and ask if there was anything we needed. It propelled our experience from a fun dinner date to a great an enjoyable one. Now back to our meal, we enjoyed a 12 course dinner with all the fixings. Choosing from the cold plates menu of: chorizo roasted artichokes with and peppers, to the open faced sandwich menu of: smoke salmon cover with caso fresco and a truffle honey topping. We then ordered from the hot tapas menu. we ordered a couple of my personal favorites which are: the Sunny Side-up Huevo with shrimp, and the crispy potato with chorizo dressing. the grilled duck and pork meatballs with a tart cherry salsa is definite one of my favorite tapas of all time. After all these small dishes we then ordered the extremely popular Paello dish. We were full already but we had to because of its popularity. Poor us!! Haha\n\nIt is extremely important to know that this dish serves two to three people, and takes 30 to 40 minutes to prepare. Meaning if you know you're going to get it, make sure you order it early so that way you have enough time to eat it without waiting. The Paello has: culf shrimp, clams, chorizo with broccoli and a few other items that I won't list here. When you combine that with some of the more popular cocktail drinks it really all adds up to a pleasant and fulfilling evening. we certainly left the restaurant stuffed and happy.\n\nHere's another little secret in case you don't want to take BART, taxi or even walk to the restaurant. It's $0.50 and hour for parking after 7 PM. This is a great break from the normal parking costs in San Francisco. Which normally will cost you up to $4.00 dollars for an hours worth of parking in certain areas in the city. To wrap up this review my experience here was amazing and delightful. The only downside I had was the long wait time, despite my reservation. But the way that the staff handled themselves made up for it and then some. The food is remarkable and I will say this has become one of my favorite restaurants to dine at.", "author": "Donald W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-09", "description": "This was the best meal we had in San Francisco, and one of the best meals I have ever had frankly. The cocktails are AMAZING. My favorites were the Farmers Market Punch (tequila, roasted pumpkin, white chocolate and Mallorca salt) and the margarita made with salt \"air\". It was superior to anything I've ever had with a salted rim. The salty foam was just perfect.\n\nThe gambas al negro (olive oil poached head-on gulf prawns with black garlic and chili) were delicious and the server brought us more bread to sop up the decadent sauce left in the pan. Crispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake with saffron alioli reminded us of okonomiyaki. Grilled alb\u00f3ndigas (duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo pure\u00e9 and crisp shallots) were amazing, and I do wish we had just shared the order of 3 between us instead of allowing ourselves to be upsold to an extra one as suggested by the server because they were pretty big and I was getting full. The vineyard greens catalan style with caper-raisin puree with raisins, pine nuts, and garlic was a nice vegetable break among all the meat and yummy fatty goodness.\n\nI'm taking away a star for two reasons. One, the pintxos are an absolute rip-off and I can't believe this restaurant has the cojones to charge $7 for a miserly bite of food on a toothpick. I found the menu listing for it confusing as well. Since it lists \"One Of Each Bite-Size Skewer\" and then describes three different skewers I thought one order (for $7 mind you) would include one of each skewer. Nope. I don't mind a hefty pricetag on great food when it is warranted, but this just felt like a sucker punch. Second, the shortribs should have been tender and falling off the bone. Instead they were tough and almost inedible. It was the only disappointing dish. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu. Just watching the food being delivered to other tables was also a treat.", "author": "S A."}

We made reservations over a month ago and had the corner round table for our party of four.   It's a crowded and loud restaurant, and the tables were really close to each other, but our corner table was the best.   Our reservation was on Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to find street parking nearby.  Since the meters were only required until 6pm, we only had to pay $1.50 for half an hour on the meter.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\nSUNNY SIDE-UP HUEVO:  Very good.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  It was like really thin shoestring potatoes with a few shrimp and a sunny side-up egg on top.  Our waitress came and mixed it all up for us.\n\nCROQUETA DE POLLO:  This comes with 3 pieces, but the waitress recommended that we add one more.  Looked like tater tots, with a crunchy outside and tender inside.   It was very tasty.\n\nPANTATAS BRAVAS:  Not too special.  Tasted just like plain thumb-size potatoes.    The sauce had little taste.\n\nCALAMARES A LA PLANCHA:  Four small squid with a dab of squid ink.  This was just ok, nothing special.\n\nSETAS AL AJILLO:  Wild mushrooms with a hint of chili.  This was pretty good.\n\nESPARRAGOS TRIGEROS CON ROMESCO:  Not sure what the green was, but it tasted like spinach.  Loved it!  \n\nPAELLA:  We ordered this as soon as we got there because it takes 30-40 minutes to prepare.  This was the last dish that they brought out and it was a good size serving.  The four of us couldn't finish it.  It was average.\n\nLIMONADA:  This was sooo good.  Lemonade with a couple of blueberries inside and a rosemary twig.\n\nThe portions are really small.  For four of us, we only got like a couple of bites from each dish, except for the Paella.\n\nFor Dessert, we shared the Churros.  There were 4 small pieces served with \"drinking chocolate\" and berry powder.  We dipped the churros in the chocolate and then dipped it in the powder.  The combination tasted like a cherry filled donut.\n\nThe staff were really friendly and did a great job explaining the dishes to us.  They refilled our water constantly.  Our bill was about $50 per person.  It would be worth coming again to try some of the other dishes because they have such a wide variety and each dish is so unique.", "author": "P G."}

However this time, we had a 5pm reservation and enjoyed getting there before dusk so we could enjoy the view of the bay and the bridge. We started the chorizo and Manchego cheese bites, which literally are one bite so order two because these aren't for sharing. Then we had the Brussel sprouts which were uniquely spiced, battered and flash fried - delectable! We also had the octopus which came with more potato than octopus but still had great char and flavor. The prawns came with amazing sauce which we dipped the smoky toast in to savor ever last drop. The chicken chicharron croquettes were gooey and steaming - definitely our favorite until...the paella and the duck and pork meatballs. The meatballs were the tastiest and moistest meatballs we've had. And the paella was well worth waiting 40 minutes for. We had the churros with Mexican chocolate and Manchego cheesecake bites. Perfect for the little amount of space left after a wonderful meal!", "author": "NJ A."}

Amazingly they had a table for 3 available. Score! However, when we got there, they seated us at a table with 2 other people. It would make sense if the restaurant was packed, but there were many empty tables all around us. \n\nThe food was just okay. Their food is supposed to be a modern twist on Spanish tapas, but nothing tasted quite right. All the flavors were toned down, maybe to appeal to a wider audience? Not to mention that their portions were TINY. I know that tapas are supposed to be small, but these were literally bite-sized. The best dish that I had was their wood-fired octopus. \n\nI also ordered sangria, and it was very sour and cinnamon-y tasting. Bleh.

Literally saut\u00e9ed peppers.\n-Calamares a la Pancha - these were pretty tasty\n-Pulpo a la Parilla - may have been good, but not a fan of the texture of octopus.\n\nBeyond the mediocre dinner, the drinks and dessert were pretty amazing.

Probably not much with so many who've already been raving about this place, but here's my two cents: \n\nI've been to Coqueta twice,lunch & dinner, and I have enjoyed both visits immensely.  Although the menus aren't different at either times, you'll find that the dishes are delicious whether the sun is up or down.\n\nCoqueta is well known for their Gin Tonics, so I had to try the Barca Gin Tonic, and as pretty as it looked, it was just as tasty!  I've also had the chance to try the Kalimotxo, a Coca-cola Sangria mix, for the very first time, I'm so glad someone in the group suggested it - very interesting and very delicious!  And onto the main attraction, the food!  As Coqueta is a tapas restaurant, a majority of the food at the table will be shared.  Both times, we started out with the meats and & cheeses plate, never the wrong route to go down (unless you're lactose intolerant or vegetarian), and it was great, our server explained what was going on on our plate, but pretty sure no one remembered as we dug right into it - lots of delicious vvarities.  And after that starter, there was a blur of: octopus, razor clams, smoked salmon, duck & pork meatballs, chicken croquettes, \"Brave Potatoes\", and you get the picture... But the stand out dishes for me were definitely the wood-grilled octopus, smoked salmon with queso fresco & truffle honey, and the CHURROS. Goodness, do NOT forget the dessert here - both the churros and flan I had were incredible!\n\nAnd the atmosphere here is great as well, whether at the tables or at the bar watching the magic happen.  Walking in, you'll see that Happy Hour is where it's at. Can't wait for my next visit!

Highly recommend the delicious Manchego Cheesecake with Caramel Popcorn for dessert (think 2 very small cake pops). Just be aware, the portions are on the smaller side for the price.

Really 2.5 stars because the primavera rice was really good, though not particularly spanish.\n\nAtmosphere/Service: Did not feel sophisticated. When the server started with \"Welcome to Coqueta, we offer a Spanish menu...\" we maybe should have know something was up, like this was going to be the TGI Friday's of something. Sitting at the bar facing the kitchen is great because you get to see the food come out. It loses some of that shine because the server always comes up from behind and startles you or has to reach around with dishes/flatware/water/etc. while the food comes from in front. Would be much better if there was just a server behind the bar taking orders, which might be a little tight but much better experience.\n\nFood: The pintxos were good, but slicing manchego and chorizo for $2.50 each isn't a big accomplishment. The blue cow cheese was good. The salads we tried were very bland and I'm not sure I've seen a kale salad with strawberries and chunks of cheese masquerading as butter in spain before. Shrimp were a bit dry but ok, could use a little bit of sauce. As noted earlier the rice was good, with asparagus and peas, and again, more italian summer than spanish. The paella looked good but we were dissuaded by the 30-40 min wait.\n\nDesserts looked great but the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream was a bit too much after the food we had.\n\nOverall, maybe a bit too much anticipation based on past Bottega experiences but not in a real hurry to go back. The scene was a bit confusing between tourists clearly struggling to understand the menu and some bro-whatevers getting pretty drunk. Odd that many of the dishes didn't evoke much of Spain.", "author": "A K."}

I walked im here after I decided to treat myself to a delicious cocktail after a long week at work and law school applications. I ordered the pan con tomate with the jam\u00f3n serrano on the side and I was not disappointed. The serving sizes are small but I'm not shocked given the food scene in my home town. I sat at the first come, first serve area under the canopy and I can honestly say that I would have ordered 4 more drinks had I felt more valued as a client. I was checked on one time by my server and a few times by another person refilling water in the hour and a half time I was there. This was a major bummer because I really wanted to like this place. I meet with a number of clients from out of town and I would have happily recommended this place if I had had a better experience. I guess I'll recommend Coqueta but with a fair warning about the service. I have no issue paying premium price for a product when the service matches it's expectation but this was definitely not the case. I hate to think this was the case because I am Latina and it may be assumed that my voice does not matter but if this is the case then maybe employees need some additional training on diversity and fair treatment. That type of mindset isn't cool and it especially doesnt have a place in a city as diverse as San Francisco.\n\nThe ONLY reason I would come back is because Sexy Luis came up to me and checked in with me. Another gentleman also checked in with me, his name is Marcos. Luis is a bartender and yet he left his position after noticing me and asking me how I was feeling and how my experience had been thus far. He has such a positive energy to him that totally rubbed off and pulled me to the bar. I had been waiting on my boyfriend to finish up meeting with a client and I asked him to meet up with me here. I want nothing to do with my server, who happens to be Latina (my peeps, wtf?) but I will happily come back to see and be served by Luis. He is attentive, high energy, and funny.

We arrived at 5:45 and were immediately able to be seated at the bar, which is our favorite place because we get to overlook everything in the kitchen. We immediately noticed a happy, efficient kitchen crew and were greeted by our knowledgeable waitress. We were all to happy to admit we knew absolutely nothing about tapas and needed her assistance. She was very helpful in making drink recommendations that were deliciously smooth and paired well with our meal. The head Chef was all too eager to introduce himself to us and sent us a few items on the house to ensure we had an excellent Coqueta dining experience! We started off with the large cheese board and loved the salted smoked meets as well as their yummy house made jams that made everything pop in your mouth. We also had the crispy kale salad, which will make you dream of this yumminess for days. It's not just any Kale salad! We had the roasted potato aioli and the Paella. Their paella is spot on with the creamy clams & mouth watering prawns! Everything tastes so fresh and nothing overpowered each other in this signature dish. Of course we had desert and we asked our waitress to surprise us! She brought out the most delicious ginger cake that was plated with a huckleberry sauce and topped with a vanilla ice cream.

When we heard he's opening a Spanish restaurant we knew we had to try it.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there's a dearth of good tapas restaurants in N California. Thank you Michael for opening Coqueta! The restaurant offers what I would consider \"nouvelle tapas\" - with its non-traditional menu items. We love the chef's inventiveness - the sunny-side up huevo seems so simple but the execution and taste were impeccable (let the waiter mix it for you at the table). Anything with padron peppers - when they are in season - is delicious. I think the wood-grilled octopus has become a signature dish as I now see it on the menu everytime.\n\nThe first few times we ate at Coqueta we were so enamored by their cocktails we completely overlooked their wines. Big mistake! They carry many unique wines - I don't know much about Spanish reds but our waiter expertly guided us through the selections.\n\nThe service is always quick and efficient. On the weekends when the place is super busy we bypass the crowd by coming in for a late lunch.", "author": "Patrick W."}

You enter the restaurant through the bar where you can check in with the host and grab a drink if you'd like.\n\nI enjoyed the most beautiful gin and tonic I've ever had. It's called the Bar\u00e7a Gintonic which is Bloom London Dry Gin, Fever Tree Tonic and a wedge of grapefruit. Served in a large stemless wine glass it's stunning to look at, and I found myself staring at its beauty with each sip.\n\nThere was a private event in the bar that night, and they asked everyone waiting to be seated to \"stay out,\" which was hard to do with trays heaping with cheese and prosciutto flew past us hungry guests writhing with anticipation. It was painful to say the least, but all was forgotten once seated.\n\nWe'd been hearing only good things about the food at Coqueta, all of which is a subtle twist on traditional Spanish cuisine. Staying true to flavors of Spain, Coqueta brings a San Francisco locavore's breath of fresh air into the true flavors of Iberian cuisine, all within a restaurant that feels like a giant jewel box of floor-to-ceiling windows, thick wood support beams, and hearty cast iron accents, fixtures, moldings, nuts, and bolts. \n\nMy only complaint is with the service. It was non-existent at times, and our waiter didn't seem to know the menu as well as he should for the caliber experience the price-point and media blitz eluded us to. Come to think of it, the entire restaurant staff's timing felt off that night, but I'm assuming it was all just \"new restaurant kinks\" that have been ironed out by now.\n\nyou can see photos of all the food we ordered on our food and travel website at the following URL:\n\nhttp://eatsporkjew.com/restaurants/coqueta-san-francisco-hoa/", "author": "Philip H."}

There's always something missing. However, this was one of my favorite paellas so far. They do not skimp on the seafood. The shrimp and clams are huge.

Seeing as we always enjoy ourselves at Bottega I couldn't wait to try out Coqueta! And it being his take on tapas was a major plus as I've been to Spain and absolutely adore Spanish cuisine. My friend was leaving for Cabo that weekend so we decided to have lunch before she left. I made reservations for 3 through opentable for a late lunch at 2:00pm on Friday the 28th of February. \nWe arrived just before 2 and stood around awkwardly for about 4 minutes. We didn't know if we should ask the at least 4 people who walked by if there was anyone who could seat us. I understand it's not a server's job to seat customers but it would have been nice if one of them would have let someone know there were people waiting in the front. At last, a man came and uninvitingly asked if he could help I said yes I had reservations. He immediately found my name on his computer and I confirmed that was us. He told us he'd check if our table was set up yet. We waited a while longer and we're then lead to a table and given menus. Now comes the most uncomfortable part. We sat there for about 8 mins without ANYONE coming to our table to greet us, ask if we had questions, wanted anything to drink and I kept track because it just got plain old ridiculous. We all sat there in amazement as servers, hosts, and MANAGERS walked past us and just had to laugh because what else can you really do without getting angry and ruining what was supposed to be a great lunch with friends. I understand we look young and we are but really, is it acceptable for a restaurant of such stature to be treating customers like this? There was a server who was helping a table RIGHT next to us (the tables are very close together so its not like he didn't see us) and he wouldn't even look at us as he brought out a plate for his table, came back to take their dessert order, AND bring them a to go box. Now I've worked at a restaurant before and usually everyone helps each other out. If a server doesn't realize they've got a new table or forgets about a table another will help them out and at least let them know. A runner came over and peered into my glass, seeing that it was empty he asks confused if I wanted water. Oh finally someone realizes we exist! Yes, thank you. Some time later our waitress (Sara G., I only know because it says on my receipt) arrives and doesn't even apologize, which is fine, it wasn't like she was helping the table to our left, the whole time or anything! She asks if we've ever been here before and we all say no and she starts to explain to us what tapas is and by this point my friend is very annoyed and was like why is she talking to us like that, acting like we don't know what tapas is! She was very unenthusiastic and you could tell she wasn't thrilled she had us as a table. Anyways we ordered the jam\u00f3n serrano and manchego skewers, roasted Padron peppers, calamari, wood-grilled octopus and the chorizo sandwiches as well as the Castro and another cocktail with cava in it to drink. Standouts were the calamari and octopus. My bf never eats seafood but we convinced him to try the octopus and he was shocked at how good it was . Everything else was alright. My friend liked her drink and mine was fine but I had seen pictures of it before on yelp served with a skewer of colorful fruit but it arrived with a limp carrot slice in it which visually was unappetizing (honestly, we all laughed at how gross it looked). My friend ordered the croquetas because she saw the group next to us get them and had to have them. She didn't know what they were called and I couldn't see what she was pointing to to help her out and the waitress annoyingly said they were the chicken and pea croquetas as if my friend should have known. jam\u00f3n croquetas were my favorite tapas in Barcelona so I knew these would not live up to them, and of course they did not. By this time my friend wanted to order another drink and we knew they are known for their gin and tonics so she was waiting for our waitress to come by to order the barca. She made herself scarce and after failing to flag her down my friend eventually asked the guy pouring our water \"can I just order a drink from you?\" Yeah, we had to from the bus boy. We ordered dessert, mine was whatever but my friend kept raving about the manchego cheesecake pops saying they were THE best thing she had ever tasted. The bill came out to just under $120 after both taxes and we left undeserving Sara a $20 tip with hopes that she will treat everyone with the respect they deserve and not discriminate based on age.\nI'm giving Coqueta one star because I have been a loyal customer to chef Chiarello's restaurants and the way we were treated was absolutely unacceptable!

In a vaguely descending order of my favorites (but again I liked it all), we ordered: \n\n- Tortillita de Camaron- Crispy shrimp chickpea flour pancake with saffron aioli - surprisingly good, crispy \n- Paella - bomba rice, jam\u00f3n serrano-shellfish broth, Gulf shrimp, clams, chorizo, with broccolini , asparagus, and lemon aioli - rice was so tasty with the shellfish broth, the shrimp was perfectly cooked (they add enough shrimp to make sure each person got one), and the clams were huge. \n- \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo With Shrimp, crispy potato, and chorizo dressing - this was a bit oily from the dressing but was very tasty when all mixed together.  It consisted of small shrimp, thin crispy potato sticks, and chorizo with a chili oil. \n- Salmon Ahumado open faced sandwich - small portions of Smoked salmon queso fresco and truffle honey on bread - super fresh.  \n- Pimientos de Padron - padron peppers with tiny strips of jamon \n- Ensalada de Remolacha - Roasted baby beets with Sausalito watercress, beet vinaigreta, tierra and cabrales blue cheese snow \n- Setas al ajillo - Wild and cultivated mushrooms with garlic,chilli,and sherry  - this was probably a bit too oily but good. \n- Jamon serrano (house cured) \n- Croquetas de Pollo -  Chicharon crusted Chicken and English pea croquetas with cured cara-caraorange - I always find croquetas a bit too mushy but it's a classic. \n- Pulpo a la Parilla Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling potatoes, piment\u00f3 olive oil\n- Albondigas a la Feria - Grilled duck and pork meatballs with tart cherry and tempranillo salsa and crispy shallots (to be fair, I didn't try these). \n\nI also ordered their Tariff cocktail which was delicious - it was the equivalent of a slightly fruity gin and tonic, with a rough hewn ice slab. \n\nEverything came to about $45 per person before tip.  \n\nGreat job Coqueta!", "author": "Vivian W."}

Finally happened last night.  Yes, I know it's been 9 months.  Easy now.  I'm just one person.  There are a lot of restaurants in this town.\nSo...\nWhile I can appreciate a converted warehouse just as much as the next person, I didn't appreciate the exposed stacks of boxes.  Eye sore.  If you've been, you know.  If you haven't, you will right away.  At this price point, and when you're packed every friggin night of the week...?  Since a glass of red wine averages $16 bucks, it seems reasonable to surmise that they have the budget that would afford said boxes to be concealed.  I understand that there is a spatial challenge to consider...just cover them up.  Next, about the service.  Our server was helpful & \u00fcber informed.  Nice.  But my man selected a bottle of wine after some deliberation, and he was the victim of a swift up sell attempt.  Hey.  We know you gotta make money.  But hey.  Everybody does.  Up selling is totally fine while the deliberating is in progress, but once a selection has been specified and actually ordered, it's bordering on disrespectful.  My man chose another bottle, so it all worked out in the end.  But now our experience has stepped out of the realm of perfection.  Ok.  Onto the food.  The pintxos: chorizo, quail egg, & the jamon serrano...all delicious.  The smoked salmon with queso fresco & truffle honey...so tasty.  The albondigas...those were knocked right outta the park.  I mean, it will be hard for me to have \"regular\" meatballs from now on.  Like, forever.  The sunny side up egg with crispy potato & shrimp & a spicy tomato tapenade (that I'm pretty sure my man could eat on top of anything & by the jarful)...mouth watering.  Order it.  The pork shoulder entree was absolutely divine.  My man commented on the small portion (given the price of $38 bucks), something along the line of \"I could put all of it in a burrito...\" and I realized I could have easily polished it off by myself.  Being that I'm petite & don't eat a lot, I have to agree w him.  It's the size of an appetizer.  More than happy to pay big bucks for food.  As long as it's worth it.  No one, and I do mean no one, likes to feel ripped off.  Now dessert.  How could I not order a dessert that includes liquid nitrogen?  It is a show stopper.  Just mad sick.  Order it.\nAll in all, food was outstanding, and the service was attentive & efficient, despite the wine issue.  Definitely worth checking out.  4 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

There were a few misses that ultimately made me take off a star, but overall we had a wonderful dinner with friends.\n\nWe had made a reservation for dinner several weeks in advance. Upon arriving, the hostess informed us they were running 30-45 mins behind. Ughs. Normally, I'm ok with this, even with having a reservation, so long as I can wait comfortably and order a drink to kill time.  There was a company holiday party consuming the bar area, so the hostess told us we couldn't wait there, and she'd send a bartender our way. Ok, no biggie, but what got me was her attitude. You honestly would have thought we were bothering her.  There's hardly any room to \"wait\" if you're not in the actual bar area, so we were forced to sit/stand awkwardly in the tiny entrance area.  She really just wasn't friendly or helpful. \n\nLuckily the wait wasn't too bad and we were seated in about 20 minutes. What set things immediately back on track were the cocktails.  Definitely some of the most inventive, tasty, and well-presented drinks I've had in the bay!  Service was a little slow from the start but improved as we started ordering.  We ordered too many dishes to name, but in particular, the table agreed that the standouts were the salmon open-faced sandwich and the sunny side up shrimp.  We also really enjoyed the cheese/meat board as well as the meatballs - absolutely delicious and so moist. We were stuffed, but sprung for dessert - the apple pie with blue cheese ice ream, and left no crumb behind.\n\nOverall food was easily 5/5, and our waiter was fantastic, too.  Chiarello was in house this evening, and even though he promised he'd \"come back by\" for a picture after we asked..he never showed up :(  I get he has other matters to tend to, but I was eager to pay him a compliment and maybeeeee get a picture. He promised! \n\nDefinitely worth a stop in - be prepared for a fun night of tasty cocktails, shared plates, and a buzzing ambiance.", "author": "Brianna M."}

At 9:50, we were told that the party had just ordered dessert, and that there was no way of telling when they would be finished.  There were no apologies from either of the two seemingly unconcerned (if not downright rude) hostesses.

I was uncertain about how the menu would work for me, but it ended up being GREAT.\n\nWe started with cocktails. Everyone got something different (I got an extra spicy Castro, which was a great idea!), and the gin and tonic menu was awesome. The Conquistador, with the fennel salt, was another standout of creative and delicious cocktailery.\n\nFor our dining, we shared an array of items. The padron peppers were a real standout for me (they had no problem putting the ham on the side so that my dining companions could have their peppers with meat, and I could have it without). They were flavorful and perfect! We also got the greens and the mushrooms, and both were excellent, though the mushrooms stood out the most to me. The patatas bravas were good enough, but I prefer the ones at Duende in Oakland.\n\nI would have liked to have tried the gazpacho, but not this time!\n\nMy dining companions RAVED about the manchego cheesecakes, and they did look insanely tasty.\n\nOur waitress was great with guiding us to dessert wines, and overall, taking excellent care of us all night.\n\nWe went on a whim and were seated promptly in the bar with no reservation.

Check\" as in check this one off!\n\nLately I have been wondering if we are just now old and cranky or just plain spoiled.  We dine out at least 3 times a week; enjoying both dives as well as all the Michelin starred restaurants as well as all those in between.  I make all the reservations so my husband always looks at me with disdain when I pick one that does not thrill.  I counter with it had rave reviews on Yelp or by Michael Bauer which makes him double down on his disdain. LOL\n\nWe got there early for our 5:15 reservations so sat in the bar for a cocktail but soon were moved into their amazingly very small restaurant.  I got a Galleon $12 which tasted like strawberry water, no alcohol.  A young man asked what I thought of it so I told him.  A minute later our waitress with concern came by offering me a substitute.  At first I waved her off but she said she wanted me to be happy and suggested their Barca Gintonic so how could I say no to being made happy?  And so our service continued thru out the night with everyone we came in contact with being kind, accommodating and gracious.\n\nWe ordered a lot.  I was so looking forward to their *Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota IMported $29 paired with their Manchego Crudo firm sheep, Spain, raw $6 which turned out to be a bit under whelming.  We were expecting stellar but got OK.  Next was their Huevos Nacional Deviled eggs filled with spring pea, smoked piment\u00f3n alioli, on pickled saffron potatos and olive oil poached Bonito $7 which was 2 half eggs.  I loved it and got to eat both as my husband does not share my deviled egg fetish.\n\nWe each enjoyed 3 skewers each, Pintxos Bite-size Skewers\n$2.50 each.  \n1.  House cured boquerones White anchovies, olives, pearl\nonions, and guindilla peppers\n2.  Chorizo roasted artichokes, and piquillo peppers\n3.  Huevos de Codorniz Quails egg \"Diablo\", pickled\nmustard seed, and jam\u00f3n Serrano\n\nWe got a special here which was 2 skewers of what seemed like prechewed, marinated overnight lamb bites though oddly a bit tough in a tasty oily curry.  It was accompanied by a watermelon and onion salad which was the best part of the dish.\n\n*Pulpo a la Parilla Wood-grilled octopus, fingerling\npotatos,piment\u00f3n olive oil $14  was my husband's favorite dish.  Great grilled flavor but almost too tender.  Very much like Kokkari's which we had last week.\n\nCalamares a la Plancha Whole Monterey calamari on the\nplancha with onion jam and squid ink alioli $10.  3 whole calamari whose taste was delicate, a bit oily but enjoyable.\n\nOur last dish was the Pluma Acorn fed, Spanish Ib\u00e9rico de bellota\npork shoulder loin with honey-chili glaze $38.  Well................ yes it was fatty, moist and tasty but the serving is really, really small.  Did it knock our socks off?  NO!  We also got the Setas al ajillo Wild and cultivated mushrooms with garlic, chilli, and sherry $10 to go with it.  It was good but was swimming in way too much oil.\n\nTotal was $240+ plus tip which included 2 cocktails and a $50 bottle of wine.\n\nWe were full!  \n\nService was excellent, wall seats comfortable though others not as much, fun venue, decent food.  I can see why this place is popular especially with the younger crowd.  It is fun to order a bunch of plates and a few drinks.  I would go back but since my husband will not, I am out of luck.

The 3 stars is for the consideration of the prior visits. This was a 2 star visit really. She wanted to bring her Dad there who flew out for the night form NY for her birthday.  Unfortunately we waited over 1/2 hour in the bar for a 7 PM reservation without apology and spent over $40 on cocktails as we waited. It was only 30 min later after we asked about when the table would be ready they \"found\" the table which was a table for 2 set for 3 in the middle of a traffic area with constant bumping and tripping of the wait staff behind us. We asked to move but nothing available and no apologies. Since it is tapas they did time it well enough with a \"stripped down\" table so we were not stacking dishes on top of each other but it was tight! The tapas as usual was good and we enjoyed a lovely RIoja reserva. However they delivered a cheesecake happy birthday dessert which we did not order in addition to our ordered chocolate churros (which are delicious). The bill was confusing as they added the cheesecake to the bill then took it away. Initially they took the bottle of wine off the bill as well which was confusing. When we asked to speak to the manager he pointed that the cheesecake was not really billed which in the end was just an annoyance. But we didn't care about the bill-really the experience was very underwhelming, not special and lackluster enthusiasm from the staff. They did take a $6 tapas off for us for good will, and added the wine back in but it was not about the money as we wanted a better experience.  This place gives a vibe of really not caring about your experience so if that is not important don't worry the food is pretty good. Not sure we will return though as we very much felt like an afterthought. Which is a shame as we previously had good experiences.", "author": "Kathy H."}

The waitress did warn us about taking 20 min to make, but she failed to tell us that at some point during the evening, the special oven they use for that was going to be used for making their bread instead, therefore not allowing for any more chocolate cakes.

We (my dining partner and I) entered in right after the restaurant had opened and were barely given a glance by the hostess, let alone a hello. She was busy tapping away on her screen and when I approached to ask if we could sit at the bar she briskly told us that the main dining room wasn't opened yet and we could sit at the bar in the entry room if we wanted. We decided to hold off and wait for the main room to open, and in the meantime grabbed a menu to look at (without an offer of one, we had to just grab some from behind the hostess stand).\n\nWhen the room was opened we were sat right in the middle of the bar in front of the kitchen. Where the front service lacked, the server we mainly had (a few seemed to help around the same areas) made up for 10x over with a great smile and a wonderfully helpful attitude about her.\n\nUnfortunately, the food that followed barely perked us up any more. We both had a couple of pintxos (the spinach tortilla was by far my favorite!), the beet salad, brussels sprouts, and the grilled octopus. The beet salad was the winner of the few dishes we had, but only because the brussels sprouts were so charred you could not taste anything but smoke. The octopus had a few great bites but for the most part had, again, too much char to get anything but smoke flavor from.\n\nI would possibly come back to try a few more small plates before I completely write this place off, but hopefully the next time will bring with it much more welcoming service.", "author": "Amy S."}

Yummy in my tummy.\n\nMy boyfriend wanted me to choose a place for a date night. I produced a list, this place included, and gave it to him. He decided here. I tried to get reservations last minute, but the earliest they could offer was 9:30.. So I decided to follow the advice of other yelpers and attempt to arrive between 6:00 and 6:30. We got there around 6:20, and the host was super nice. We're chill, we don't care where we sit as long as we get a place. The host gave us the option to sit at the bar or kitchen side. We're like, \"Uhh.. Whatever is easiest for you?\" Then the host made sure to ask whatever is easiest for us, so we both said,\"Um.. kitchen please?\" and immediately he gave us two seats at the kitchen bar and we're ecstatic! We got into a place that was rumored to be hard to get into! Sure, the bare stool has no back support, but whateves'.\n\nSo we're chilling with the menu, trying to figure out what to drink and eat. We were greeted by the bar waiter, and given water. He came back for our drink order while deciding on what to eat. In this time period, we figured out what tapas we wanted for the night and gave a full order. BTW go for their popular gin drink. Tastes awesome, looks beautiful, and convince whomever you're going with to get it otherwise they WILL STEAL SIPS FROM YOU (looking at you boyfriend).\n\nEl Capo Cheese plate: Huge cheese portions!! Seriously! Fat wedge of blue cheese, fat wedge of goat cheese, and then cubes of monchego(?) However, these kind of spoiled the appetite for the potential great things ahead. Also, we're cheese spoiled from Willi's Wine Bar three cheese selection plate (our old anniversary stop).\n\nDeviled eggs: Meh for me, but I've never liked deviled eggs. So to receive a meh from me is an accomplishment. My boyfriend, who is a deviled egg fiend, loves them. The best he has ever had (sorry mom, you're now second).\n\nSea and mountain: Our first time trying sea urchin! My goodness! We can get why sea urchin is a hard flavor to describe! So creamy, with all the good, sweet flavors of seafood without it being gross, dingy seafood flavor! Our minds were BLOWN! GET AT LEAST TWO ORDERS OF THEM! THANK ME LATER!\n\nGrilled octopus: Holy crap baskets.. this is the most tender cephalopod I have ever had with a smokey flavor. Like.. first octopus that melted in the mouth. Wat? I'm used to chewy stuff! Octopus can be freakin tender!?\n\nAlbondigas: I'm not into rich fatty meats, but oh man.. That was delicious. Fall apart on your plate, further fall apart in your mouth. The tangy sauces totally compliment the fat. GOOD. STUFF.\n\nDessert Churros: Meh. I prefer the fair churros. The berry powder was neat though. Go for another round of sea and mountain open sandwiches. Or any other savory tapas.", "author": "Heather H."}

The view is spectacular, as it sits right on the water. We got reservations simply by calling the restaurant. The hostess wasn't the friendliest when we arrived, but that was my biggest disappointment of the evening. Don't be snotty. You lost a star for it. \n\nOur server (Brooklyn) was fantastic. She explained the menu, described different offerings, and made suggestions when we asked for them. We had the sangria (good but I've had better), and we tried a ton of items on the menu (gotta love tapas!). The food was exceptional. I would highly recommend the croquettes and the sunny side up egg with shrimp. The octopus at Wayfare Tavern was better (IMHO), but this wasn't too far off. The paella was amazing - probably the best I've ever had, and everyone at the table thought the same. The menu suggests it's for two people, but we split it among four and were perfectly sated. \n\nWhatever you do at Coqueta, save room for the churros!!!! These little gems are so yummy; we ordered four servings of them, and I could have eaten at least another round or three! They are light, have the perfect crunch, and are paired with chocolate sauce and raspberry dust for dipping. Oh. My. Goodness. Days later, I'm still dreaming about them.", "author": "Jenn C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-31", "description": "Let's set aside the fact that this is a Michael Chiarello place, and examine it on three separate topics: Food, Service, Environment.\n\nFOOD\nThe cocktails here are amazing. We ordered the Galleon ($12) and the special punch ($12), which was essentially the Farmer's Market Punch with a few tweaks. They also serve wine in the Porron, the traditional Spanish wine pitcher with a spout. We saw a few people trying to drink directly from the Porron, which is always entertaining.\n\nWe started our meal with one chorizo bite-size skewer ($2.50 for one), which my boyfriend loved. I had the Pan con Tomate y Jamon ($10 - the server totally upselled me on this one, dammit), which was fine. Instead of fresh tomato, the bread was served with some kind of tomato jam/chutney, which was decent.\n\nNext came the Red Kale Ensalada ($11) with roasted squash, persimmons, pumpkin seeds, and a warm, Rancho Gordo garbanzo bean dressing. That was, hands down, our favorite dish of the evening. I'm all about kale salads, and I could have eaten about two more orders of this. Fantastic.\n\nThen came the Chicken and English Pea Croquetas ($9 for three --- why is it always in threes?), which to be honest, were quite unremarkable. Crunchy outside and mushy inside, but I've never met a croqueta in my life that I've liked. The croquetas also came with the Wood-Grilled Octopus ($12), which was amazing. The texture of the octopus was perfect; soft, and not rubbery. The fingerling potatoes that accompanied it were properly cooked, creamy, and (naturally) buttery.\n\nAfter that, arrived THE dish that made me want to come here in the first place: The Pluma ($38), which is Iberico pork shoulder served with a honey-chili glaze that comes in a bottle alongside, so that you can glaze to your heart's content. You can tell that this pig, this pata negra, lived a great life. The meat was sweet, although pork shoulder can be a bit tough, which this was. Slightly. The glaze itself is tasty, and I'm sure people love to slather their pork with it, but I used it a bit sparingly. I would have loved to have a side of Maldon/sea/kosher salt. I like my meat simple. I'm kinda like a cavewoman in that way.\n\nI was pretty full by this point, but I *had* to have dessert. You know, for research purposes. We had all of the dessert pinxtos: Manchego cheesecake (YES!) skewer (BOO!) with caramel popcorn, salted caramel skewer (meh -- you've had one salted caramel, you've had them all), pate de fruit skewer (tasty, but you gotta be in the mood for pate de fruit), and two white and dark chocolate-covered olives (this is never a good idea, ever). We also had an amazing apple tart (OMG) served with some Cabrales blue cheese ice cream, which we devoured. I don't remember the prices, but they're in the $4-10 range.\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was a fantastic Latina woman with jet-black, lovely hair. She was fantastic. The rest of the team was also on point, making sure our water glasses were always filled, our napkins were folded upon returning to our chairs, clearing away empty dishes promptly, etc. We showed our appreciation by leaving them more than 20%.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nI really love what they did to that space. The architects and designers managed to create a warm, casual and modern atmosphere out of essentially an old pier in a cold and foggy city. One would think that with all the diners in the room, with all this concrete and huge space, that it would be noisy. It wasn't too bad (and my boyfriend's kind of a low-talker sometimes, and I'm kinda deaf sometimes, and we managed to have a great conversation!). \n\nHowever, the kitchen looked disorganized: Boxes and boxes of I don't know what, stacked 5 high on top of this seemingly 2-story shelf behind the chef's counter, bottles of wine and mezcal on the shelves, mixed with huge jars of pimenton, Asturian beans, and other kitchen staples; behind that, the prep area, with bulk bins, unattended food being prepped (persimmons, peels, etc.) and various supplies. I'm already paying $38 for 8 slices of Iberico pork shoulder. Why do I have to look at this disconnected, disorganized shit? I'm big on details, and they totally missed this one.\n\nAll in all, if you haven't been, definitely go and check it out, whether you like Chiarello or not. I long for the days when the Bay Area can have true tapas bars that are casual, where one can linger with great drinks and nice tapas to nibble on, instead of the bougie \"tapas restaurants\" we're currently stuck with.", "author": "Cheryl M."}

Just to be clear, I'm more than happy to pay $150+ a person for a Spanish tapas restaurant, but there has to be a reason why a dish is so expensive -- a Celebrity chef shouldn't automatically skyrocket the price of 8 slices of grilled pork to $38. The pork should taste like it's $38, or maybe at least $30 with an $8 \"Celebrity chef\" tax. \n\nHonestly, though, as long as you know that you will be overpaying and you are content with knowing that you will be overpaying, Coqueta really is a solid Spanish restaurant in SF. There are many millionaires in SF who use $100 bills like Charmin Ultra sheets, so there will definitely be people who don't care, and for those people, Coqueta is great.\n\n----------------\nFOOD:\n\nPluma (Grilled Pork with Honey) =\nNicely grilled, but definitely under-seasoned without the honey. The honey gives the pork a wonderful, subtle sweetness, but the pork itself just isn't worth $38 for 8 slices. I don't care if there was an incredible scientific breakthrough that managed to reincarnate Julia Child and zombie Julia Child cooked up this meal for me, no celebrity chef should be charging this much for 8 pieces of bland pork that has to be drenched with honey.\n\nSerrano Ham w/ Manchego Cheese Pintxo =\nGood ham, good cheese -- the bite was the size of a tic tac, but it was a satisfying bite.\n\nEnglish Pea Croquettes =\nDelicious chicken pot pie croquettes -- nicely fried with a strong, creamy flavor.\n\nPaella =\nVery good paella -- excellent texture of the rice, subtly spiced, and with lots of crispy rice to give it a great overall consistency. Goes amazingly well with the peppers and aioli they give you on the side.\n\nGrilled Octopus =\nThe octopus was a bit too mushy, and not tender like how grilled octopus is supposed to be. The fingerling potatoes were tasteless -- I think this dish would go better with a puree or at least something with a bit more flavor.\n\nFig Tart with Blue Cheese Ice Cream =\nFig tart was just okay -- tasted like a stale pop tart. BUT the Blue Cheese Ice Cream was INCREDIBLE. Honestly, we spent about 10 minutes contemplating if we should try the Blue Cheese Ice Cream, because it sounded horrific but it definitely piqued our curiosity. Best decision of the night. Subtle blue cheese flavor, but the perfect amount of sweetness that ended with a satisfying end. This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors ever and I wish the fig tart wasn't there in the way.\n\nChurros =\nPerfectly fried churros. The chocolate sauce wasn't strong enough to do anything of substance, but the churros themselves were excellent. Again -- not sure if it's worth the $8 price tag, though.\n----------------\n\nCoqueta is an excellent addition to the Embarcadero and it definitely has its spectacular moments (Blue Cheese Ice Cream, Paella) but I was just expecting more, given the prices and the hype.", "author": "Roy C."}

My favorite was definitely the papas bravas. how can you go wrong with fried potatoes with aioli?! at it's customary for me to order paella everytime i go to a spanish restaurant, so of course i did but honestly wasn't that thrilled. certainly not the best paella i've tasted, though passable. the cocktails were good, but definitely on the sweeter side. \n\nall in all, i had a good time as i went with an amazingly fun crowd on the sunniest sf day this year, and the vibe was just perfect. but thankfully i wasn't paying because i'm sure we broke the bank! gotta love expense accounts lol. Will be back for another fun gals biz lunch though probably never on my own accord.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

First off, great location...on the water and next to a long pier you can walk down and see the Bay Bridge lights. Their bar area is a bit cramped  (there can be a lot of people eating there along the sides and at the community table since the dining room is usually booked), but their drinks are tasty and beautiful looking. The Barca is their gin and tonic that I always seem to get. \n\nAs for their food, I always seem to leave satisfied. Their paella for two is tasty and the portion size was on the larger side. I thought I would like their sea urchin open face sandwich, but I liked the smoked salmon one more. I can't get enough of their honey chile glaze on their Pluma (pork shoulder dish). The ribeye is very flavorful, though a bit fatty. The sunny-side egg with shrimp (a bit greasy), gambas, and albondigas are all solid dishes as well, and provide some great sauces for dipping some bread.", "author": "Rick T."}

I thought the short ribs were good but the calarmi was great.  Don't expect sliced rings of calarmi.  Instead, you get the whole body separated from the tentacles.  \n\nWe also split the paella.  After reading reviews (both on Yelp and professional restaurant critics), I was expecting the holy grail of paellas.  Maybe it was the hype or maybe it was just an off day, but I didn't think the paella was special.  I think the reason I wasn't blown away by the paella is there wasn't any crispy/crunchy rice layer on the bottom of the pan.  \n\nI'll probably come back with a larger group so we can try more dishes and give the paella another shot.", "author": "Larry L."}

Albondigas are tender, almost to the degree of falling apart. Duck and pork get lost in the sauce, tastes more Southwestern than Spanish. I definitely couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. Mushrooms were burnt, had to forage for the larger pieces that weren't overdone and didn't finish 3/4 of the dish. \n\nI was sold on those mushrooms by my rad server, and let him know how they tasted, and was bummed when they didn't get taken off my bill.\n\nIt's not that I expected it, or again, maybe I did.

We were sat at the Chef's counter both times, the first time was fine because we were in front of the action and the staff bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of....it was like a family affair.  Last night however was a totally different experience, we basically got a view of a staff member portioning ENDLESS amounts of meatballs.  When I mean endless...during our two hour meal he just barely finished when we were signing the check.  I think we were around meatball 60 when our server had a moment to come over and take our drink order.  I have a feeling she was stretched thin, very nice, but I felt like she was busy and I didn't want to have to take up her time to ask questions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-25", "description": "I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. I know this place has great reviews and high status, but I left annoyed and feeling like what a waste of money and with a promise that I would never go back. I was meeting a few girlfriends after work for drinks and dinner, and we had made a reservation a week and a half in advance. After the waiter had suggested that we get 3 tapas each (wayyyyy too much and wayyyy too pricey for a $20 bite of okay food), and were there for about an hour and 10 minutes he told us that they had reserved this table for another party and asked us if we would like to move to the bar....\nFor a nice restaurant who regards itself with quality food and service I have NEVER had a waiter tell us to move because they reserved this table for another party. How rude!! I would understand maybe if we were a party of eight and were there for 2 hours but there were 3 of us, and were barely sitting for an hour when he asked us to move. He mentioned in a quiet voice that he set up dessert for us in the bar \"on the house\". We were moved to a tiny area of the bar with a stump like table which didn't even hold the 3 of our drinks. After about 40 minutes, we asked a different waiter if we could inquire about this dessert we were told was waiting for us at our new spot. He was very nice and brought us dessert quickly. About 20 minutes later our first waiter came over and \"apologized about our dessert being so late\" and claimed it was ready for us when he originally set it up but \"someone must have swooped on the dessert and taken it.\" Hmm. That seems very interesting that he conveniently didn't notice that our dessert wasn't there when he sat us there OR when he came to swoop on our bill that we hadn't even touched yet with our full drinks.\nOverall - the bus boys and servers were very attentive and polite, but our waiter was very pushy and untrustworthy. The food was good, but not worth the experience. I've had much better food out of a food truck and the service was much better.\nI expected much more out of a top rated restaurant in SF...", "author": "Jennifer C."}

I've been really wanting to try this place out since I work right next to the ferry building. I finally got the opportunity to dine here for lunch with my team.\n\nWe were able to get reservations right when they opened up on a Friday. Upon arrival, the hosts were very accommodating and pleasant, as expected at a place like this. Once we were seated, we all order our drinks (non-alcoholic, not one of those lunches). I had the housemade J & T tonic drink which was super refreshing and great for a nice summer day.\n\nBeing a tapas restaurant, and specializing in their small plates, we basically ordered everything from the hot tapas section of the menu. The most notable/plates I would definitely order again include: Chicken and English Pea Croquetas, Sunny side-up egg w/Shrimp, Shrimp Pancake, and Calamari.\n\nWe also ordered some of the bigger dishes, including the Pluma and Paella.\n\nPluma (Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota Pork Shoulder Loin with Honey-Chili Glaze) - Let me start by saying this was probably my favorite thing on the menu at Coqueta. The pork was just so tender and juicy. It just kind of melts in your mouth and you can't help but smile. Although it's $38 for 8 pieces, this is a must have! With the honey glaze that you coat the pork, you will not regret this decision at all. Enough said. \n\nPaella - All that yelp buzz for the Paella made it easy for us to cop an order of this. I have to say I'm glad we got it. The Paella consisted of razor clams, chorizo, and prawns. I mean really you can't go wrong with this. It's one of the staples of this restaurant, so just get it. Great mix of flavors and a fantastic way to top off the meal before dessert.\n\nSpeaking of dessert, we were able to try a few of the unique desserts that Coqueta had to offer. We chose the chocolate and olive oil ice cream sandwich and the manchego cheese cake served with caramel popcorn. They were both very interesting, but tasty nonetheless!\n\nOlive oil ice cream sandwich - Very refreshing! Surprisingly light and paired well with the chocolate!\n\nManchego cheese cake - This thing is straight up cheese (at least it seemed like it), definitely a very strong taste. Popcorn is necessary to subdue some of that kick from the cheese cake. Again, magical pairing of flavors!\n\nOur experience at Coqueta was very enjoyable, food/service was great and the overall vibe was very relaxing/homey.

Waiting an additional thirty minutes for a simple glass of water or the cocktails we ordered might be pushing things a bit far, though.  Overhearing our neighbors discuss similar issues - and worse - kind of put us on edge at the start.\n\nThe cocktail list is long and complex, but the cocktails we sampled tended to be overly sweet and overly savory, with somewhat muddied flavors brought on by the sheer number of ingredients.  We had a hard time finding something simply refreshing, which would have worked well as a foil to the generally salty, savory food.\n\nSpeaking of the food - it's good.  Others have laid it out in exquisite detail, but a few notes:  The squid dish was overly salty and inferior to a couple others we chanced upon that week.  Three spears of fresh delta asparagus with a *fuchsia* sauce glopped on one end might be considered by some to be excessively priced at $8.  The paella looked good, if a little overdone, at the next table over.  We opted for Arroz dish, which tasted better than the paella looked.\n\nService ranged from okay to strange to inattentive.  The bar was exceptionally slow.  The kitchen was decently fast, until we tried to order another round of tapas.  We should have known the snide comment from the waiter about our addition was going to point to trouble.  I mean - it's tapas.  In what universe do you just place an initial order for this stuff and not go back for more when you see the portion sizes?\n\nSo - the food is good, if perhaps a bit small for the price.  The cocktail list leaves something to be desired unless you happen to love the house flavor.  And the service would be maddening if the place wasn't so popular.  So why is it that we kind of want to go back for the paella, huh?", "author": "Albert H."}

We were looking for a place for lunch on Sunday when we saw the bright & airy little bar area overlooking the bay.  We completely missed the actual restaurant, which is through the bar & inside the attached building, so you have to actually know where you're going to find this place.  The menu looked good so we decided to give it a try.\n\nUnfortunately all of the tables were booked, so we were seated on precariously small stools at \"the chef's table\", which is basically the bar overlooking the kitchen.  It felt a little weird staring at the chefs plating & cooking but I suppose they are used to it.  I was able to watch our food being cooked which was pretty cool.\n\nThe menu is Spanish tapas, so we ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Most of the menu was foreign to me so I let my sis do the ordering.  I only insisted that we order the wood grilled octopus.  This was the most amazing octopus dish I have ever had, and I have eaten my fair share of octopus!  I didn't think it was possible to get it that soft and the smoky flavor was incredible.  We also ordered some jamon (cured ham) with manchego, small toasted uni crostini, razor clams, & beet salad.  Everything was delicious but being tapas, they were gobbled up much too quickly.  We ended our meal with an order of the house made churros with warm chocolate sauce.  Yum.\n\nI still don't know who Michael Chiarello is, but I can see why he has so many loyal fans.

We also had a tapas where they had some very burned bread - the manager came by and asked if we wanted more. We were feeling agreeable and said yes. Four thin slices of charred bread wasn't very good, but we ate it anyway. \n\nThen comes the bill, but it was so close to 7 we didn't look at it closely as we had to get going. When we got home we were suspicious of extra charges. They charged us for TWO sangria pitchers, when we only ordered one. I am so angry. They even charged us for the damn bread - which was way too burned to eat any way. \n\nIf you want to blow $150 - $200 be my guest. But be wary of any \"extra\" service - it will show up on your bill. Our bill was $250.00 - two cocktails, tapas and \"two\" pitchers of sangria. I think I can do better elsewhere.", "author": "Bonilee P."}

The place is nice but not stuffy, and the food is just excellent. I also really like their sangria, which is very light and refreshing.\n\nYou can start with your cured meats, cheeses, and bite-sized skewers, if you're so inclined, though there is so much other good stuff on the menu we usually just do the jamon iberico, if anything, and then dive right into the good stuff, pretty much making our way down the hot tapas list. We like the roasted padron peppers, gambas al negro, calamari, and duck and pork albondigas. I also liked the smoked salmon sandwich which I tried on the last visit; though it was pretty much your standard smoked salmon on bread, the truffle honey added a little extra something. And next visit I plan to try the mar y montana -- sea urchin and jamon iberico, which sounds really great.\n\nNow, onto the main event! You can of course make a light meal out of the appetizer and tapas dishes, and many people do, but the main dishes should not be missed. If I had to choose, I'd skip all of the the other stuff (as good as it all is), in favor of their seafood paella. It says it's for two, but split it'd be a smallish portion. If you have enough people (or a big enough appetite), also try the \"gaucho\" bone-in 32 oz ribeye -- it's recommended for four people, and our group of four did both with no problems, even after a bunch of tapas. The paella also makes for great leftovers, so don't worry about over-ordering. In fact, my only complaint was that on our last visit, there was a miscommunication and half of our paella, which we'd wanted boxed to-go, got tossed! The horror!! But everyone was very apologetic, and there's no point in crying over spilt milk and all that, right? Even if the milk is a big portion of delicious paella that would've been great reheated the next day...", "author": "Shing H."}

I know you're a new restaurant and there might be people camping out but when you keep someone waiting that long who has a reservation it might be a nice gesture to offer a cocktail or appetizer, anything actually to acknowledge the wait. One of the hostesses seemed very sympathetic but the rest of the staff came across very nonplussed.\n\n-The restaurant had a serious wind tunnel going on, every time the door opened up there was a freezing breeze felt from the hostess stand throughout the restaurant.\n\n-We tried ordering a number of items that they ended up being out of. I get the fact that you run out of something but tell us as we're looking over the menu so we don't get our hearts set on something that you no longer have.\n\n-Some of the food items were laughably small when it came to portion size. I'm looking at you calamari and you baby beets pintxos.\n\nOverall, I was pleased that I was able to try Coqueta so soon after opening but I won't be rushing back until the buzz has died down and the restaurant finds itself in a better groove.", "author": "phil h."}

The location is great for the downtown working set, and the views are lovely. With a famous chef and all of these amazing reviews, I was surprised we had such a different experience. \n\nOur waiter handed out our menu's, and didn't take the time to explain anything. When we did have questions, he was good about answering them if we were very specific, but he seemed more interested in just getting us to add items to our bill. There was no conversation around the things we were interested in enjoying as diners, and just a push to get us to order the more expensive items. \n\nWe ordered a handful of different small plates, and honestly, with the exception of the croquettes, none of them wowed us. Our group loves cocktails and we ordered a variety and passed them around for tasting. We universally agreed that none of them tasted like they really nailed the mix of ingredients. I found myself leaving half of my second cocktail because it was so lackluster... and I am not the person who leaves expensive cocktails in my glass. \n\nWe received the bill which included gratuity even though we were only five people, and it came out to $55 per person for 1.5 cocktails each, and what seriously felt like five bites of food per mouth. \n\nMy suggestion, save your money and head to another amazing Embarcadero location like La Mar, Hard Water or Chaya.", "author": "Lauren K."}

The atmosphere was chill and our server was very friendly. \nWe started with the meat and cheese plate. There were manchego, goat, and blue for cheese, chorizo, salumi(?), and prosciutto for meat. The plate came with quince jam, tomato preserve, marcona almonds and some crackers on the side. The goat cheese was soooo goood! Potatas bravas had aioli and salsa/marinara. Salty and creamy. We then had the wonderful chicory salad and uni with iberico open face sandwich. The sandwich was more like a tartlet. Very tiny albeit delicious. The olive oil that came with the bread was excellent. We even asked for a second round.\nFor desserts we had the churros and the ice cream and chocolate cookie. I liked the churros here a lot more than the ones at Contigo. They were crunchy and cinnamony. The dish also came with some dehydrated raspberry powder which made the dish. They should start selling those in jars. \nI liked everything about this restaurant. The paella from the couple sitting across from us looked delicious. Will definitely come back for that alone.

The menu has enough interesting dishes and there were enough hits that I would go back but I don't think I'll bother with getting a reservation or be in a rush.\n\nWe had an 8:45 reservation. When we got there at 8:45 we were told our table wasn't really so we could wait in the bar. No problem but then two different servers tried to give us food menus and when we said we were waiting for our reservation one of them said that we clearly had arrived too early. Then the host came out an said that our table was lingering and was there anyway we would want to eat at the bar. If I had wanted to eat at bar I wouldn't have made a reservation for a table. I didn't mind waiting but the lack of communication and snide comments weren't appreciated.\n\nThey did give us two non-alcoholic beverages and a couple small bites for our trouble while we waited. We didn't ask for that and didn't expect it but I think it was nice and appreciated it.\n\nWhat was odd was that once we were seated there were at least 4 two-top free and the chef himself was presenting dishes to some industry folks. That was the only time we saw him but it's nice to see a celeb chef in his restaurants.\n\nFrom there the service was pretty good with our main server being informative and helpful. We also had three other people bringing out our dishes and drinks.\n\nThe dishes we had:\nPintxos-which are tiny bar snacks that are almost always free in Spain but are $2.50\n1.Qual egg Diablo with Jamon was delicious\n\n2.boquerones,anchovies also tasty\n\nCold tapas\n3. house-cured Chiarello Manzailla olives $3-tasty and a good portion with a nice mix\n\n4. Olive oil-poached Delta asparagus with idiazabal cheese and a sangria holandaisse $8\nThis was good if rather odd with the sangria holandaisse and it was only four spears of asparagus\n\nMontaditos ie. open faced sandwiches although these were smaller than the ones common in spain and were more like canapes\n\n5.Smoked salmon with queso fresco with truffle honey, $8 a play on bagels and lox but the salmon was overpowered by the honey\n\n6.sea urchin with melted lardo with a slice of jamon iberico $14 this was an interesting combo but not exceptional\n\nHot Tapas\n7. Potato Bravas $8 a dish that is literally at every place in Barcelona, the version here is nothing like what you get in Spain, instead of a creamy inside, it's shredded like a tater tot and the sauce is too sweet\n\n8. Grilled Razor Clams with grilled wild ramps and meyer lemon $14 one of the best dishes we had, the clams were cooked perfectly, the ramps and lemon were excellent counterpoints.\n\n9. wod-grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, pimenton and olive oil $12, this dish was the most similar to it's inspiration. Perfectly cooked octopus and delicous potatoes, it was a bit heavy on the pimenton and the portion was tiny even for a tapas. In Barcelona it would have been twice the portion for a tapas.\n\n10. Grilled Iberico Secreto $22 probably the most disappointing dish. I found the pork overcooked but the tximi-txurri was ok and the watercress salad was dressed very well.\n\n11. Arroz cremosa $22 rice with scallops and english peas. This was a very satisfying dish with lots of flavour, a good portion and nicely seared scallops.\n\nWe finished with two desserts. The dessert come in two sizes with smaller single serving treats and larger shared ones.\nWe got the Sangria Poprocksicles $4, which was basically a sangria granita with poprocks through out the pop. It was very fun to eat but one note in taste not surprisely.\n\nThe other dish was a strawberry and rhubarb nitrous frozen ice cream with a rich deep berry sauce. The server had to crack it open and it went everywhere but was a ton of fun to eat and the texture of the frozen treat with the deep flavours of the sauce made it a really interesting dessert.\n\nThere is a wide selection of cocktails, a highlighted section of sherry cocktails as well as spanish gin based ones and there was nice selection of non-alcoholic drinks too.\n\nThe space is beautiful and surprisingly not very noisy. The lighting is good for the sight impaired and the HOH/deaf and the space was wheelchair accessible. \n\nWhen we got there the bar area was less than half full, during dinner the chef's counter was mostly empty and there were empty table in the dining room. On open table there was almost no reservations from 6-8:30 most night which makes me think they are holding tables for walk-ins or doing some reservations by phone only.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

So I walked into this joint with the expectation that I was going to be wow'ed again - hence the 1-star off. \n\nI've been dying to try this restaurant for years and what better excuse to blow hundreds of dollars than for my 25th birthday?  I made reservations weeks in advance and even made a note that I was celebrating my birthday in the OpenTable comments box.  \n\nI arrived before my reservation on a Sunday afternoon- the dining room was beautiful and rustic and it was awesome that they had an area away from the bar space I walk by every day.  At first, I had no idea if I was approaching a hostess - she wasn't wearing any sort of uniform (she was dressed even more casually than I was) and she didn't say anything to me - so after a few seconds of staring at each other, I took a leap of faith and told her that I had a reservation.  Thankfully, I was correct but it was a little odd to me that she didn't say anything first - if you don't have a uniform or dress code, how am I suppose to know that you're a hostess if you don't say anything?  Strange.  \n\nMy family and I were shown to our table promptly - truthfully, I was disappointed.  If you make reservations weeks in advance, you'd think that they'd have one of the best tables set aside for you....we were seated by the door in the middle of a high traffic zone - flies kept buzzing around our food and drinks.  When I went to Bottega for my birthday last year, the staff selected a wonderful table on their patio and even had a little card with a birthday greeting - it was seriously awesome.  Coqueta had neither of those.  A smidge disappointing... \n\nWhile the staff offered water promptly - it was awhile before we were acknowledged by our server.  But, thankfully, it was all up hill from here - our server was very sweet and helpful.  She took our drink order quickly, had great suggestions for the menu and made sure that we all had a serving of each tapa even though they're usually only three bites.  \n\nThe food excelled in some places and left us wanting more in others.  \n\nThe El Gran Plat Cap, patatas bravas, and croquetas were AMAZING.  Seriously, I could eat the patatas bravas for the rest of my life.  The albondigas and paella were flavorful, but just didn't wow like we were expecting.  \n\nDrinks were phenomenal - I had the barca gin and tonic and the table had a white sangria that was probably one of the best I've ever had.  \n\nTo top of our meal, our waitress surprised me with manchego cheesecake bites for everyone - a really nice touch on a meal that started off a little rocky.\n\nSo 1-star off for questionable customer service, but in general, we had a great time and it was a surprisingly filling meal.", "author": "Jess A."}

Wandered in during a recent crawl of the Embarcadero, and could not have had a better experience!\n\nFirst, the food is fabulous.  We tried three of the tapas, their pork and duck albondigas (meat balls), the pulpo, and the sunny side up egg.  The albondigas were excellent, very tender and moist, one of the best I have had in a very long time.  The pulpo was beautifully grilled and served with fingerling potatoes, not tough and with a lovely smoky taste.  But the show stopper was the egg, a fried egg served on a gravy made with chorizo, and topped with very thin and crispy shoe string potatoes. I could have eaten at least two of this dish!  Fabulous!!!  There are probably 40 different tapas on the menu, so we will definitely be back to sample the others too!\n\nAlthough we stuck with some very good Spanish red wine from Toro, we were parked at the bar, so had a ringside seat to watch the bartenders do their magic, and the cocktails looked wonderful and skillfully made ... the assortment of ingredients lining the bar could have made a meal themselves.\n\nFinally, the service was fantastic!

It is as if a vinophile had a hand in the  execution of the drinks. The infusion of favors were taken to a new height with the addition of said favors in the glass, such as star anise.\n\nTaking that one step further, the glasses used, appeared to be a stemless Pinot Noir glass. A large bowl with a smaller rim, to encourage you to waft in the aromatics of the drink before you ever taste it, all my senses were alive, eyes, nose and mouth by these two very different drinks we ordered.\n\nIt did not matter which drinks, I noticed everyone's drinks appeared in the same fashion.\n\nA second star for the drinks.\n\nWe should have left at this point.\n\nThis is a seen and be seen place, way too over run with 'top drawer people'.\n\nCompared to the perfectly executed, Peruvian food at Limon the night before, this restaurant falls short.\n\nHaving read many reviews I knew I was looking for the more aggressive items on the menu. We started with the sea urchin with Jamon and breathtakingly thin lardo almost melted on top, you would think this would have been spot on, but it wasn't. The thick, dense and way to dry bread item (something Spanish) it was on did not allow you to enjoy the sea urchin's creaminess, you were far to taken with chewing the bread.\n\nWe than ordered the house cured anchovies, let me emphasize, HOUSE Cured.That is why we ordered them, they came right out of the package, bought for $10 a lb. at gourmet food stores, or now Costco.\n\nWhen I asked about this, I was told they don't always have the fresh anchovies, and these were not fresh.\n\nSo that's two down, the pardon peppers were and are a staple, the sliced Jamon really added something, but the menu can't rely on padron's for their review.\n\nThe razor clam were a new one to me, and we enjoyed this dish, but the  whole octopus with squid ink aioli, left a lot to your imagination, the squid ink was for color only, it had no flavor, and brought nothing to you're palette. Another poorly executed dish.\n\nWe were given desert, because of the anchovies not being as claimed, I would have preferred they just took it off the bill.\n\nService was good, and the silverware is simply beautiful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-14", "description": "We'd come into Coqueta full of high hopes. Spanish cuisine is our favorite. We've traveled extensively in Catalonia and have eaten at most of the great restaurants as well as many neighborhood Tapas places from Barcelona to San Sebastien. Additionally we are big fans of Michael Chiarrello's Bodega in Yountville. We were excited to get in on opening night. Now, we've been to many restaurant openings (and soft openings) and expect some rough edges. So, this past Saturday night we were not expecting perfection but rather a promise of a great Spanish restaurant. We have several good but no great Spanish places in SF.\n\nBeing walk-ins, we were, understandably, relegated to the enclosed, outdoor patio area. Unfortunately we were against the far wall. The bar/table was very narrow and maneuvering plates was tricky. The stools (no chairs in this spot) were small and hard...perhaps one step better than sitting on upwardly protruding nails. I stood for dinner. This space consists of parallel walls of glass and hard surfaces. This is the ideal area for an obscenely loud, a screamingly loud, environment. After a few drinks a lot of the younger gals at the bar just shrieked to be heard. It was on the verge of actual physical pain. Why in the world don't restaurant designers think about these things. The main room, on the other hand, had a far more relaxed, civilized environment...lacking none of the buzz but also allowing for conversation. \n\nThe service was just a bit rough...totally to be expected and maybe a bit better than I was hoping for. The waiter was patient and good natured. On the other hand, another waiter brought me an order of razor clams when I'd ordered the savory Manila clams and tried to convince me that what he was giving me was what I'd ordered. We both knew better. \n\nNow for the food. The phrase that comes to mind is \"tourist trade.\"  The food was so very disappointing both in preparation and conception. The Savory clams arrived barely warm. The Jamon Iberico de Bellota was sliced too thick and served with croutons rather than bread. The portion size was *far* too small for $30. I know what this kind of jamon costs it ain't cheap. However, there is no excuse for the meager portion of the lack of art in slicing it. The marcona almonds were fine. The Chicken and English pea croquets with cured cara-cara oranges was the best dish of the evening. Very good...the oranges made the dish. The Roasted Padron peppers with Jamon Serrano was OK. The peppers a bit mushy. The \"Tatta\" Bravas were a joke...watery tater tots. How do you screw up an iconic dish so badly? Why screw with patatas bravas like this? Ego?\n\nHow did this place wind up like this? I can forgive the opening night jitters and rough edges and the outside space need a dramatic rethink. The menu...at least what we had...was such a major disappointment that I don't think we'll bother coming back.\n\n1.5 stars", "author": "Gary C."}

State Bird really made me appreciate the small-plate / tapas style of restaurant.  It's exciting trying lots of different dishes with your friends, the plates come out faster, and the meal is more evenly paced.  Coqueta is a fantastic restaurant, and between the location (Embarcadero is really nice, and it's convenient for me) and the excellent drinks it's really won me over. \n\nFirst, the drinks... the Revolution gintonic ($12) is the one to pick if it's your first time.  Some of their drinks are hit-or-miss, and this one is a hit.  Engine Co. #5 ($13) is also good if you like Manhattans; it's very similar to one.  I didn't enjoy the Championship \"Policy\" ($12) much, so I wouldn't get that.\n\nMost of the food is good; you really can't go wrong.  They bring around a platter of toothpick-skewers ($2.50 ea.) (you might want to explicitly request it to get your meal started while you order).  The Quail Egg \"Diablo\" on the platter is a must-try, and I also enjoyed the Boquerones, even though I don't usually like olives.  They've had the Paella (don't remember the price) as a special each time I've gone and it's also good if you want to get filled up at the end.  You need to order it at the beginning of your meal though because it takes 40 minutes to make.  Beyond that, try a bunch of stuff!\n\nThe last thing I want to say is I've really enjoyed the wait staff, or one in particular.  We had Brook (dunno if I'm spelling her name right) our first visit, and since then I've always tried getting one of her tables.", "author": "Steve D."}

My cousin recommended this place since she had just eaten it for dinner over the weekend and loved it. Good call cousin, good call.\n\nAmbiance: Beautiful! So much natural light (esp on a sunny day) and it's so open. There's a bar area and the dining area but both are so casual yet really modern. I think people would like this place just for that.\n\nService: Friendly, attentive\n\nFOOD: It's tapas-style with most dishes being pretty small portioned but a few being a bigger size. I recommend ordering a bunch of small plates and ordering a larger entree (the pasta, etc.) as a filler. If you're a stickler on cash, then this place is a little more pricey but it's along the price range of all the other Embarcadero restaurants.\n\n-Mar y montana, sea and mountain: Sea urchin on a baguette to me. Pretty huge slice of uni and while the taste is really subtle, still good. \n\n-Sunny side up egg: I loved this. It's got a ton of crispy crunch on the top that added great texture.\n\n-Asparagus: Okay it's 3 freakin' pieces of asparagus with some light pink sauce but it was actually pretty good! Worth ordering? I don't know but I was surprised by how much I liked such a simple dish. \n\n-The vermecelli pasta - This was the biggest dish we ordered and while it's good, it looked & almost tasted just like the sunny sideup egg dish. So....meh\n\n-Limonada (non-alcoholic) - Big fan.\n\nLunch for 2 came out to roughly $71 before tip to give you an idea of how much lunch is.

The restaurant is right on the embarcadero with plenty of parking (albeit expensive) around. It's a very unassuming place from the outside, but the inside is very nicely decorated and sets a napa valley like mood right in the heart of the city. \n\nWe started our meals by trying the quail egg skewers as well as the sunny side up egg and wood grilled octopus. Each dish was very well balanced and gave you enough to fill your need while keeping your pallet intrigued. Now for tapas, some complain that while you get to taste a variety of flavors you'll leave hungry and with a large bill. However, we ordered the paella and steak/pork shoulder and we were more than full. \n\nMoreover, the staff was extremely enthusiastic and helpful throughout the night. Whether it's wine pairings or what dishes are popular they always offered advice and honest opinions about the dishes. \n\nMy only regret is not being able to try their cocktails, but hopefully I'll be back!\n\n***Tip: Reservations are hard to come by, but if you book on a Sunday or Monday you can usually swipe a table.", "author": "Robert T."}

I even went out of my comfort zone and ordered a cocktail, and it was just delightful.\n\nI see how some people might think it's a bit overpriced, but hey, if you want to dine around Embarcadero, you're also paying for the view (and the colossal amount of rent that comes with it).. and the artistry of the food.

The Spanish tortilla -- which is the benchmark I use for whether or not a Spanish restaurant is really as good as it says it is -- was good.

It also didn't hurt that Chef Chiarello was there for nearly the entire night making sure that the food was spot on and that the dining experience was warm, exciting and entertaining.  He seemed to spend at least a few minutes conversing with every table, and even, personally picked out a bottle of rioja to go with our meal.  The wine was delicious (Allende 2006 Rioja), as was the food.\n\nThere were lots of hits.  The Ensalade Resorte, Vineyard Greens, wood-grilled octopus, Pluma (pork shoulder loin with honey glaze), and dessert were all excellent.  Not all the dishes quite hit the mark.  The croquetas were a little heavy (though the orange with hot pepper was awesome), some of the potatoes we had weren't seasoned, and the gin and tonics were a great idea but not completely balanced (one was a over-limey, the other was just a little muted).\n\nService was warm and helpful throughout the evening.  So, probably a 4 if I were to grade just on food, but combined with the service and ambience and the fact that this was something like their third night in operation, Coqueta deserves all 5 stars.\n\nPro tip #1:  The Pluma is unlike any pork you've had, reminiscent of kobe if it were steak or toro if it were tuna.  \n\nPro tip #2: For the love of god, get dessert.  We had a little bite of caramel cheesecake on a popsicle stick served with warm caramel corn, oh and, a warm apple tart with (light) blue cheese ice cream just to finish things off.

Our waterfront is home to a jewel of a ball park, the new Exploratorium, a state of the art cruise terminal, and the excitement of the America's Cup. And now, without much fanfare, a very special restaurant has landed in our neighborhood: Michael Chiarello's, Coqueta. \n\nChef Michael comes to San Francisco on the heels of his successful wine country restaurant, Bottega, which was awarded a place on the Chronicle list of top 100 restaurants in its first year of operation. This was only the most recent of Chef Michael's accolades. Shortly after graduating from the Culinary Institute in New York, after opening a restaurant in Miami, he was named Chef of the Year by Food and Wine Magazine. Ten years later the Culinary Institute of America awarded him the same honor. The chef has ventured into television on PBS and The Food Network, his shows garnering three straight Emmy awards. He also writes cookbooks. Perusing one, I learned more about cooking in the first 20 pages than I have ever learned from a cookbook.  Reading it, I became aware of the chefs philosophy of cooking: \"Food should tell a story with a sense of taste and place.\"\n\nBut at this time in his life Chef Michael has come back to his first love:  running a restaurant.  He is doing it by covering all the bases. He owns a sustainable 20 acre farm in the wine country which supplies much of the produce needed at his ventures.  Referring to Coqueta, he told me, \"Spanish Cuisine is more challenging than my Italian cuisine at Bottega, as I have been more careful about keeping to true tradition.\" Though,\" he admits, \"I have added some vegetables for Californians, as you have to practically beg for a vegetable in Spain.\" \n\nThe restaurant is divided into two sections.  Michael acquired the small building next to Pier 5, a dilapidated awninged structure, and turned it into a glass-enclosed room with views of the Bay and The Embarcadero. The room houses Coqueta's bar as well as space for casual dining. The main dining room, entered through this area, is located in the bulkhead building itself and features a seating bar where one can watch the goings on in the kitchen.\n\nThe menu is uncomplicated but intense. The first option is one of the beautifully presented sliced, in-house cured meat and Iberian cheese plates. Although we didn't try one of these platters, on a next trip, we will go with friends and order the large, El Plat Cap that comes with olive oil tortas and pan de cristal con tomate, the only bread Coqueta serves (the chef explained that bread is not traditionally served in Spain). This bread is made locally by Panorama Bakery for Coqueta. The only other bakery making it is in Barcelona. \n\nChef Michael has an innovative winner in his \"minis\". These one bite offerings are ordered or taken from a beautiful board, passed around by a server. Of the five offered, I found the Chorizo, roasted artichoke and piquillo peppers delectable, with the artichoke and peppers providing a creamy, rich texture that buffered the chewy but tender chorizo. Another favorite was the Quail egg Diablo. The delicate tiny egg paired beautifully with the pickled mustard seed and small piece of Serrano ham. \n\nKeeping with tradition, the restaurant serves both hot and cold tapas.  Of the cold tapas, two really stand out. Hands down the restaurant's most winning dish is Ensalada resorte.  The preparation comes in a glass with a vibrant and silky English green pea emulsion at the bottom layered with spring vegetables, sieved egg and Serrano ham croutons.  Another favorite, the Delta asparagus, is both beautiful and flavorful. The large stalks are trimmed back to the delicate white and are poached in olive oil, topped with grated smoky Idiazabal firm goat cheese and Serrano ham bits and accompanied by piquillo pepper aioli. \n\nOf the hot tapas, the wood grilled octopus is scrumptious. It is fired on the grill, with the body firm but tender, the tentacles crispy. This dish is served with roasted fingerling potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and dusted with pimento powder.  Another standout: the Sunny side-up egg dish, with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing. As Chef Michael says, \"I've always believed anything goes for breakfast, so breakfast should go at anytime, too.\" I believe him. \n\nAmong the entr\u00e9es, the winner is the mouth-watering Pluma, a pork shoulder loin imported from Spain especially for Chef Michael. This is the most expensive dish on the menu but easily shared, which makes it the least expensive of the entrees. The preparation time is 30 minutes but the time goes by quickly when you are eating tapas. This tender loin, easily cut with your fork, has a honey-chili glaze. \n\nWe have a super star chef and a super star restaurant at a super star location. The Embarcadero just keeps getting better and better.", "author": "Carol P."}

Each of the tapas was lovely, an assortment of flavors that excited my tongue and left me wanting more. The tapas kept coming to the table, we kept eating, and before you know it, I'm getting full.  \n\nThen the paella arrived. I felt a little hungry again. The rice was moist with a good bite, the seasoning, the chorizo, shellfish all combined to make a fantastic dish. Oh, and the crispy edges of the paella that were crusty and sticking the pan - we fought over those. Crunchy, tasty... I think we all wanted more. \n\nThis place is on Pier 5, with comfortable cozy d\u00e9cor. It was very full, and I saw people waiting to be seated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-29", "description": "I was disappointed in my meal here and I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that we ate at the bar (Bar Five) versus the restaurant but I believe the menu is the same at both so I would hope the quality of the food and the service shouldn't be vastly different.  \n\nThere were some meal highs - the croquetas and \"Fantasia\" de Fideua were really excellent and I have a feeling if it was available the Mar y monta\u00f1a, sea and mountain was going to be outstanding (they ran out of sea urchin that night unfortunately).  However, I thought the other things I tried were good but not really noteworthy (boquerones, salmon and truffle honey open faced sandwich, sausage, and pimientos).  \n\nThe areas where this place really disappointed were in the service and the cocktails. The service was....cold, a little snide, and dare I say borderline bitchy.  I was really surprised because Coqueta is a nice place and I usually find service in San Francisco to be really great (when thinking of east coast vs west coast service).  But the servers came across as haughty and rude and like they couldn't be bothered to check on us.  Again, I'm not sure if this is a bar vs restaurant situation but if you get bad service at the bar, why would you ever want to come back and eat at the restaurant?  At one point, we asked a server who delivered one of our tapas if we could order an additional dish from her or if we should wait for our original waiter and her tone and response was basically akin to I've kinda got my hands full, don't bother me which was really off putting.  One server was friendly and enthusiastic but after at least 2 servers with attitude, I wasn't really pleased with the service.  As for the drinks, there are a lot of interesting and unique cocktails on the menu.  They are described in vivid detail and I was quite excited to try some of these drinks.  However, I think Coqueta suffers from incredible creative cocktails that I don't think work at all with the food on the menu or maybe even by themselves.  I'm all for trying something new when it comes to cocktail combinations but I don't understand why these two cocktails were even on the menu; the flavors are so overwhelming that I cannot imagine them working well with any of the tapas.  The Dirty by the Sea was a seaweed influenced vodka with a sea anemone and it looked wonderful with the sea anemone but it was so incredibly briny that it tasted exactly like when you go snorkeling and accidentally swallow sea water, it's honestly that salty and briny.  It was overwhelming to the palate and I could only see it working if you ate a plate of boiled potatoes with no seasonings.  I also tried In the Haight which I ordered primarily for the description of its \"patchouli memory\".  I mean, how can you resist a description like that?  However, the only memory that lingered was the smoky flavor of my vodka that while not as off putting as the Dirty by the Sea, it was still so strong that it bordered on palate destroying.  I felt like someone locked me in a meat smoker after drinking this thing.  I really don't understand the place of such strong drinks on a menu filled with pretty flavorful tapas.  \n\nEven though the food was probably a three star experience, I was so disappointed by the service and the cocktails that I have to give this a two star review because I was really excited to try this place due to the stellar reviews and this was a real let down for me.", "author": "Lisa W."}

When I poked my head in they politely said that they would be open after 5:00 pm. \n\nI returned at 6:00 pm to get a drink.  I was greeted most pleasantly by the hostess and Michal Iglesias, the manager.  They kindly explained that it was opening night and they had no available tables.  Not surprised, I told them that I only wanted to have a drink and look inside.  I went to the bar and said I liked bourbon and asked for their best drink.  As a long time bourbon drinker from the South, I was most surprised by the drink they served which was one of the most unique and exquisite drinks I have had in a long time. The ingredients were unusual and the taste surprising.\n\nWithin 10 minutes I was approached by the hostess who asked if my date and I would like to eat at the bar.  We of course accepted the invitation, and were seated with a great view of the kitchen.  We immediately noticed the decor accentuated by the beautiful painting on the walls.\n\nI was first introduced and fell in love with Tapas in a random bar in Pamplona.  Ever since I have experimented with different Tapas restaurants in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  This was the first place I have been to that captured the authenticity of what I was familiar with in Pamplona, with added elegance and much better service.  \n\nMo, our server, was knowledgeable and creative.  I looked at the menu once to order, and afterwards I trusted his judgment.  After inquiring about what I basically liked, he continually surprised me with food I probably would not have ordered, but that I loved.  His explanations were thorough without being over the top.

We also ran into Michael Chiarello when we were there as he walks around talking to the guests while managing the restaurant!\n\nFOOD:\nChicken & English Pea Croquettes: Crisp, warm and exactly described similar to a miniature home made chicken pot pie.\n\nWood Grilled Octopus: Soft, juicy, and flavorful. The octopus tastes fresh and the grill flavor definitely adds to the taste. It comes with small potato pieces which makes it a great pairing.\n\nPORK SHOULDER: This is definitely the highlight dish of the restaurant. I was about 7/8 full when this came out, and I was still able to eat a lot of it as it was that GOOD. The pork and honey flavor is amazing and the pork is cooked to the perfect texture.\n\nCheesecake: Best dessert in the restaurant. I tried the Sangria Pop rocks but it was okay as it tastes just like a raspberry ice pop. The cheesecake was soft and creamy perfect fit with the caramel.\n\nGin and Tonic: Probably the most refreshing drink I have had. The Gin and grapefruit go perfectly well together and the presentation of the drink is amazing! Must try.\n\nSERVICE:\nGreat service overall. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending both wine and dishes, as well as accommodating when food would be served.\n\nOverall: This is a must try restaurant for any occasion. I'll definitely be making my way here after work next time for a quick drink.", "author": "Stephen C."}

A large section of the bar was \"reserved\" but we managed to find some standing room and get drinks.  The cocktails were very good, but no better than other restaurant/bars in SF.  The bar waitstaff was good and many people had ordered food too.\n\nWe were seated 20 minutes late and were told about a yummy special salad with pork belly.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria to get started.\n\nOur waitress returned at 7:28 to tell us that they were out of sangria.  Already out at 7:28pm on a Tuesday?!?  She recommended the Rebujito which tasted like cold mulled cider :( We ordered and then she came back to let us know that the special was sold out...disappointed again....\n\nMy favorites were the escabeche, padrone peppers, and the secret pork.  The vineyard greens were very salty and the patatas bravas were very similar to tator tots.  The frozen strawberry-rhubarb gazpacho dessert was underwhelming.  I would have liked something chocolate, but that was not on the menu.  Dinner for 2 was very reasonable at $120.\n\nMaybe we will go back for the escabeche and eat in the bar.\n\nI have enjoyed Botega and also attended the Harvest dinner at the winery.  The atmosphere at both of those locations was very friendly, not just with the staff, but between the patrons.  The atmosphere at Coqueta was disappointing.  In part, having different members of the waitstaff deliver each dish contributes to the feeling that you are just one of many people who will pass through the table during the night.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

The service was great, and the interior was nice although not that creative, but the food lacked a wow factor.\n\nThe drinks were very good and served with a massive block of ice for interesting affect but they barely had any alcohol in them.  The tapas we had were good but the only thing very memorable was the octopus, it was perfectly charred with a nice smokey flavor.\n\nNothing else really stood out, the paella was OK but nothing jaw dropping.  Same could be said for the beat salad, and the soft egg over shrimp and potatoes.  \n\nThe one thing that was exceptional was the service.  Our waiter warned us that a wine selection may overpower our paella and suggested an amazing lighter red for us and everyone staff member was very friendly.\n\nI most likely won't be coming back here for dinner but I can see myself stopping by for drinks and an appetizer every now and then.", "author": "Ryan J."}

In a nutshell, the food is pretty good, but it is expensive.  And wines by the glass seemed ridiculously priced.  The cheapest, on tap, glass of wine was $14.  From there it went to $17 and then over $20.  That doesn't seem to mesh with a tapas, small bites, place.\n\nI was seated along the wall where a cushion goes from one table to the next.  When a patron bounced down at the table next to me I bounced as well.  More serious was that the table seemed a few inches high in relation to the seating.  I came to feel that they didn't want me to get too comfortable.  Get in, get some food, and get out as quickly as possible.  Turn the table.\n\nI started with ensalate resorte which was english pea puree topped with a mince of spring vegetables and accompanied by a slice of ham.  The ham didn't add anything to the dish but I liked the puree and vegetables together.  A nice, small plate of food.\n\nChicken and english pea croquets surprised me as I was expecting something a bit more substantial that what filled the croquets. It was a puree in which the chicken did little to announce its presence.  Still, I liked this dish.\n\nFinally, Pluma, pork shoulder with a honey-chili glaze.  This was five ounces of loveliness.  And well it might be at $38.  Since I was dining alone, and given the price, it would have been nice if there was something more on the plate.  Some greens.  Olives.  Onions.  Something to make it a course for one person.  But if you are sharing, I can assure you that everyone will fight for every last bit of this.\n\nMy server was a bit inexperienced but got the job done.", "author": "David D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-12", "description": "So, full disclosure, I am a Sommelier at a pretty damn good restaurant here in SF.  So, naturally, I have higher expectations for what I want when I go out to eat and drink, especially since I work around 60 hours a week and NEVER have time to go out. \n\nLast night, Sunday, a friend recommended I go to Coqueta for a very special dinner I had planned. I typically shy away from the Embarcadero for anything at all, but figured I would give it a try. \n\nIn open table, I left a notation in the reservation statg how special the night was, why and that I also worked in restaurants, so I was expecting, given how wonderful Bottega is, that this place would live up to the hype. \n\nSadly, I was gravely mistaken. First, neither the host, the server, any manager or any person at all mentioned my special night, not one bit. I even tried to tell our waitress about it, but she simply talked over me, saying to order a 19$ glass of Not Champagne. \nThen, still no acknowledgement of my night or anything, our preliminary order is taken and we proceed. \n\nOur server told us that the House cured Jamon Serrano came with around 7 slices, and that we should upgrade by adding, with outrageous sur charge of course, the Manchego. Let me just say, while the flavors were great, we recieved 3 slices of Jamon, and when we mentioned it, the server simply walked away, with ZERO mention of the mistake. \n\nThen, Croquets. Again, solid flavors, and a great counter point was the supremed citrus, beatifully sweet, sour and savory combo here. However, in each of the 3 (very small portions) there was a small, completely inedible part of the croquet that was as hard as a rock. Almost cracked a tooth! As an aside, they didnt quite understand the concept of clearing before bringing more plates. Had to stack them ourselves.\n\nNext, the uni and jamon lardo open faced \"sandwitch\", again, all the flavors were there, but it was ruined by how crunchy (near inedible) the mini bagel looking thing could have been a great combo if it was soft and maybe a little salty. But alas, another great idea, poorly executed. \n\nLastly, the pulpo or grilled octopus. This was the one bright spot. Not a single problem with this dish. Absolutely perfect. \n\nAll things considered, food could be much better. But my biggest issue is with service and how little acknowledgement we recieved for choosing them the ONE NIGHT we had off to celebrate. I really hope management takes this review seriously. I had not joined yelp for a long time, sad to say it was this experience that provided the impetus to do so.", "author": "Conor C."}

Even wiith a reservation we were seated at the bar, which is fine. But holy hell, those have got to be the most uncomfortable stools I've parked my ass on. If it was just for a quick drink then fine but for an expensive 2+ hour meal? Not cool. \n\nOn the plus side - \nThe pintxos were excellent and a good way to start off - I would recommend the chorizo or the anchovie ones in particular. nice little bites packed with flavor. \n\nI can barely remember which of the tapas we had, which isn't really a resounding testimonial. What I do remember: \nAlbondigas were a standout. I didn't want to share. \nThe asparagus was ridiculous. I know they've got high rent, but 3 stalks for $8 is crazy. And the red sangria salsa added nothing. \n\nBranzino (one of the larger dishes) was cooked perfectly and very tasty. It rounded out our small plates very well. \n\nConquistador cocktail was incredible. I will have to go back to try more cocktails as many of them sounded very intriguing. Also appreciate them having of wine on tap and plenty of price options. \n\nFinally, even if you're too full for dessert you should do yourself a favor and have one of the little cheesecake pops. That's the one thing I will be dreaming about for weeks to come.", "author": "Mo S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-10", "description": "Lunch today produced two of the most memorable dishes I have had in more than recent memory.  The Paella was a breathtaking mixture of perfectly cooked rice (just a bit burned on the bottom to make it caramelized but not overdone, not an easy task) and a lovely combination of meat and seafood on top.  It could not be improved on at all.  \n Dessert was also as good as it gets with the warm molton arroz con leech cake with huckleberries, and arroz con leech ice cream.  Once again, cooked to perfection (any more would be starting to burn) but it was perhaps the best dessert I have experienced in years.  \n  We also had the Verduras a la Catalana (curly mustard, green chard Catalan style with caper-raisin puree, pine nuts, raisins and garlic) and thought  it was excellent.  The Pulpo a la Parilla wood grilled mediterranean octopus lost a few points in that the smaller parts of the octopus were so over grilled as to give it a prominent taste of charcoal over everything else.  It's the only thing I would not repeat.  \n  Service was friendly, helpful, and professional.  \n  More than worth a detour.", "author": "William F."}

First of all, the waterfront location is so charming. But there's a wonderful warm sophistication to the interior that makes it feel even more special. Tall wood beams, lovely leather seats in the bar area. My favorite visual touches were the actual ingredients displayed for all to see from near the kitchen on tall shelving. \n\nEach dish that arrived was presented so beautifully that it really added to the experience of eating them. The grilled octopus and potatoes was served on a plank wood board and arrived hot and perfectly prepared. Mid-meal Chef Michael personally came by with a wildly fun and unexpected treat - some sort of grilled onions wrapped in parchment paper. He told us to peel off the top layer and dip it the sauce and enjoy. It was a memorable part of our night, laughing over the surprise dish and then savoring how good the onions were paired with this AMAZING romesco  sauce. We shared the spiced grilled crab, and got a bit messy only to have the staff bring us perfectly timed hot towels to clean off with. \n\nMichael, in between working in the open kitchen, really took the time to see how each table was enjoying their meals. He put in our dessert order for us and we ended up sharing a goat cheese cheesecake, playfully served on a wooden stick with a sprinkle of caramel popcorn. We are still talking about the amazing berry gazpacho dessert - a must-have. Lastly we had the churros - delicious.\n\nBesides the amazing meal, we left feeling so well cared for.

I've been twice; the first time the service was quite attentive.... but I can only give 2 stars because of the absolutely AWFUL service my husband and I got last night (Valentine's) at dinner.\n\nTwo very egregious errors of service were made:\n1. Our drinks (a cocktail from their suggested list and a glass of wine) took 30 minutes to come out.  We had already received 3 separate dishes in this time.  We asked our waiter about the drinks after 15 minutes (when our first dish arrived) and he said they'd be right out.  Around 15 minutes later, we also asked the person who delivered the third dish.  At this time, our waiter actually went to check on the drinks and they soon came out.  And the couple seated next to us (had the same server and placed their order not one minute after us) received not one but TWO rounds of drinks during this time.  Our waiter's response to the situation was to explain three separate times that it \"wasn't [his] fault because [he] doesn't make the drinks.\"  Of course this is true, but doesn't help the situation at all and definitely does not need to be mentioned three times.  Also, they had a two hour limit for Valentine's Day so it's pretty unacceptable to have a 30 minute wait for drinks.\n2. Our waiter brought out a dish, sat it down on our table, came back a few minutes later and removed the dish, saying \"Sorry, I brought this to the wrong table,\" then brought it BACK AGAIN a few minutes later saying \"I was right the first time, it's yours!\"  So weird!  I hope none of the dishes we ate sat on other people's tables for several minutes!\n\nSome other smaller issues happened that bothered me in light of the above two errors:\n1. The hostesses asked for the name on our reservation three separate times, including once several minutes AFTER WE HAD ALREADY BEEN SEATED.\n2. Our waiter asked as he was clearing a plate away \"That was the dish I suggested to you, wasn't it?  Wasn't it a good recommendation?\"  We were like \"Nope, you didn't suggest it!\"  He didn't suggest any dishes to us the entire night.  Weird.\n3. When we ordered dessert, we ordered one full size dessert and three \"dessert bites.\"  Our server was like, \"Oh no, I do not suggest getting bite ABC, definitely not\"  but offered no alternative.  We were like \"......ok, just the one full dessert and the two good dessert bites then.\" WEIRD.\n\nI totally understand that eating out on Valentine's means crowded restaurants and overwhelmed servers but this stuff is unacceptable on any night.", "author": "Amanda M."}

This restaurant is sexy through and through from the space, the design, the staff, the drinks and of course the food. \n\nBefore dining in the restaurant a drink or two in the outdoor \"fishbowl\" bar is a must, get there early to enjoy a bit of sunlight. This space is perched perfectly on the Embarcadero, ocean front with full view of the Bay --- a light and bright space, beautiful design, great energy and they have a wonderful Sauvignon Blanc on the menu \"Duckhorn\" need I say more and then there are the cocktails... they have mastered a cocktail menu not only of the most beautifully esthetically crafted drinks, but the best tasting. I am in awe with these cocktails in big globe glasses and oversized chunky ice cubes accompanied by exotic fruits, herbs and other garnishes --- you can not go wrong with the \"Spanish Holiday\". If you like global top shelf gins this is the place for you. Joe is an outstanding bar manager who crafted the entire bar menu.\n\nMichael the GM is stellar - welcoming, knowledable and accomodating. I would want him at the helm of my own restaurant - \"it\" would get done. \n\nNow to the main event - the dining experience. I personally know the Interior Designer Caroline so I am biased, but this restaurant is stunning. Take it all in, the hanging lights, the leather chairs, the bar, the wood grains, the utensils, the tableware - but do not neglect to examine the walls closely. The most beautiful Venetian plaster I have seen yet. The color is so dramatic. Just love this space, I could sit in the corner booth for days. \n\nMichael Chiarello in the kitchen is never a bad view. He is one of the most handsome charming people on the planet and to boot offers some of the best fresh culinary dishes I've had. Which leads me to The Gaucho... hands down one of the best steaks. I have heard this from dozens of others as well in concert. The wooden platter it arrives on is spectacular in its own right, but this steak is above and beyond seasoned and cooked to perfection. I won't even describe it for you because you must try this for yourself. Accompanied by the pepper dish, asparagus and various house cured jamon plates are a sure thing. Do not neglect to order the house churros with pot stirred chocolate. \n\nCoqueta is an experience that I hope all will have the opportunity to experience and I look forward to returning again and again.", "author": "Tsuni S."}

We walked from our hotel and found the bar to be overflowing with guests waiting for tables and they kept coming and coming. It was a circus - forget romantic dinner. We were seated close to our reservation time. The dining room d\u00e9cor was sparse and the flooring did not absorb the noise - not my style. Our waitress was quick to remind us that the plates were very small and we should order three each for sharing. My husband mentioned that we do not like the same types of food, so we would each be ordering our own. She went on to say that the chef decides when plates go out and they probably would not come out at the same time. (I guess you can't have it your way here.) Sure enough my two tapas dishes came out andwe sat and sat waiting for my husband's food and we were again reminded by our condescending waitress that the chef decides when a plate goes out, not her. Finally his came out. He had the Spanish sausage dish which he did not like. I had the tomato sandwich which was several pieces of bread with salsa - not what I expected. I also had the chicken croquette which had very little chicken mixed in an herb cream cheese. It was not very good but the cream cheese on the bread. I went to the ladies room and there was a line but the door had a sign that said if you didn't want to wait you could walk down to the public restroom at pier 3 (we were on pier 5).\n\nAll in all a big disappointment and we will not be returning the next time we are in SF, nor would we recommend it.", "author": "MC B."}

We ordered mostly seafood - squid (best dish), papas bravas, whole sea bass fish, and shrimp.  \n\nWe tried the sangria made of red wine and Coca Cola (sounds weird but is good), sherry-based.   Then I switched to some Spanish reds that I haven't tried before.  Lovely!  \n\nThe only thing is that this is a pricey place, and with tapas, the $'s add up quick so be ready to spend.

She has also ran with the bulls.\n\nWe basically ordered everything on the menu. I love the meatballs, the salmon, and the Pluma the best, but every single item was sensational. \n\nThe cocktails were also amazing. I had the Castro and the Revolution. Both incredible. The Revolution has white peppercorns and a cinnamon stick in it. Ridiculous. Don't get the Sangria, though. It sucks. That is the only thing not impressive about Coqueta. It just tastes like super dry, chilled red wine, there's no true fruit essence or sweetness to it.\n\nThe restaurant is absolutely beautiful.

I'm not sure where we went wrong...\n\nThere were only two of us so we couldn't get the ribeye and I have a shellfish allergy so I opted to not OD on a 3 person serving of paella. That being said, I think we tried all the recommended favorites.\n \n// Anchovy skewer - I needed the bill to remind me that I ate this. It was quite salty, with the olive and pickled pepper stealing the show for me. I much prefer the anchovy toast from Contigo.\n// Quail egg skewer - Again, a forgettable bite.\n//Chicory salad with apple and pear - Maybe my favorite dish. The brightness of the fruit was quite nice and I also enjoyed the vinaigrette. \n//Peppers with ham - I prefer more of a char with some salt crystals on mine personally. Good portion for 2-4 though.\n//Chicken and pea croquette - I did enjoy this, I mean who wouldn't like a deep fried chicken pot pie bite, but I was hoping for more complex flavors and textures.\n//Fried egg with potato sticks, chorizo and shrimp - Quite greasy with uninspired potato sticks (Girl Scout snack style) and completely flavorless shrimp. It was hearty though. \n//Octopus - Tender but tasteless. It was up in my against the octopus from La Ciccia, some tough competition.\n//Pork and duck meatballs - Oh yay, these have some flavor! The meatball was moist, which gave it some trouble holding together, but tasty with a hint of sweetness that was unexpected but welcomed.\n\nWhile I may not have enjoyed the food, the service and decor are on point! The dining room is cozy and beautiful, successfully transporting you out of the Embarcadero. I'd say it might be worth a try if you get to host someone on the company dime. The tables are very close to each other, so don't disclose company secrets, but revel in your company and variety of food choices.", "author": "Krystle S."}

The reservationist said they sometimes fill up by 4:30.  We got there at 4 and there were plenty of seats available in the bar area, but it did fill up before 5.  \n\nThe dinner menu did not start until 5, so we had a little chorizo and cheese sandwich  and patatas bravas while we waited.  The patatas were good, but I would have liked some salt on the table for more seasoning.  We really wanted to try to paella, so we had to go light on apps after the 5 o'clock menu was available.  We got the sea urchin and lardo montadito and the whole calamari on the plancha.  The urchin app might seem expensive, but the urchin was generous and it was delicious.  They cut the legs off of the calamari on the plate and so I ate those first.  They were so intensely flavored, I wished that I could get an entire plate of just the legs.  \n\nThe paella was gorgeous, but too much food for us after what we had already consumed.  It is a very generous portion that could easily serve four people.\n\nI traveled through the main dining room on the way to the ladies room and it is such a great space.  I definitely want to go back with a proper reservation and eat in that room, but the bar is a great option for those without the foresight to make a res!\n\nDrinks are on the pricey side.", "author": "Amber B."}

We've been to Coqueta previously and also Bottega in Yountville, two of Michael Chiarello's restaurants. We haven't always had servers that helped us settle in for an enjoyable dinner at Bottega. Coqueta hit its marks again for tasty offerings with delicious food and refreshing cocktails. However, it was Brooklyn, our server, who gets all the praise for a fun evening on Sunday, April 24. Not familiar with Spanish food, Coqueta's menu can be challenging. Brooklyn helped us select several offerings that proved to be yummy. The \"Sunny-side up\" Huevo with shrimp, crispy potato and chorizo dressing was delicious as well as the \"Patatas Brava\" - freshly dug, lightly smoked crispy new potatoes with brava salsa and garlic aioli. The duck and pork meatballs were just okay. Two of us are Italian and can claim tasty meatballs of our own. We're tough meatball critics. Finally, we enjoyed the tender and well-seasoned pork shoulder and it hit high marks. Delicious margaritas, Spanish wine and Rye Whiskey satisfied our drink needs as well. Brooklyn, thanks for a wonderful evening. Love your style, sense of humor and ease of serving. We'll return and request to be in your section.", "author": "Kathy H."}

I could taste Barcelona at Coqueta and that was very pleasurable.\nThe ambience and service are also first rate.\nBut, and isn't there always a but. They didn't find my reservation when I arrived. It wasn't under my name. I was offered the bar. No-no! When I gave them my phone number, they did find the reservation at the right time but booked for exactly one week later than I had chosen. Okay.

Now I feel I have him within arms-reach. Welcome to THE CITY chef.\nI was at Coqueta on opening night with a group of eight friends.  We had cocktails at the bar with a spectacular view of the bay. I don't believe I ever had a better tasting gin and tonic as I had that night. \n\nThe restaurant reminds me of a European brasserie. It has an uncomplicated menu,\nyou don't have to follow the normal rule of choosing an appetizer, a dish from main course, and a dish from dessert.  You can choose your courses from anything that is on the menu and share it freely around the table. It creates a casual dining experience in an upscale restaurant.\n\nOur server was from Spain (basque) and was very knowledgeable about the dishes. I have had many variations of paella, since I spend a lot of time in Catalonia; the Fideua variant was elegant and packed with rich flavors. Once you had the roasted padron peppers, it is hard to imagine ever going back to chips and salsa... The Chicken and English pea croquets croquettes are a must have, crunchy on the outside and oozing with warm flavor on the inside. \n\nCoqueta is the perfect place to have a cocktail and a few appetizers after work or sit down in the restaurant and dig in on tapas and entrees.\nThe staff was great and the place already feels like it has been there forever.

The space is gorgeous, the drinks ARE AMAZING and the servers are professional and warm. But, it is absolutely ludicrous to me that when you arrive for your reservation that you booked a month in advance, the table isn't close to ready and there is literally no relaxed place to wait and enjoy a drink while you wait. The bar area is so so cramped and crowded and between the servers barking at you to move out of the way and the other patrons drunkenly threatening you if you try to take the barstool they've been stalking for an hour, even after you explain calmly that you're waiting for your table, it's incredibly stressful and not an awesome way to start a meal that to be honest is crazy overpriced. The food ranges from okay to excellent and once you are seated they are super nice, but they are rushed and overworked as well so even once you are seated the wait for a drink is 10-30 min. And I think all of this could be manageable but the cost makes it outrageous. We travel to Spain annually and I feel like our favorite restaurant managers/servers in Spain would pass out from shock if we told them what the service looked like and how much we paid.

We had a bunch of small plates and they were all good. We split the pork large plate which was good too and so were the deserts and coffee. They also have a huge selection of bite sized appetizers and deserts (on a tooth pick) for a couple of bucks.\n\nI almost want to take half a star away for the very small portions. They just need to double all their portions and charge more. The small plates are REALLY small, e.g. patata bravas literally has 8 tiny potato pieces in it.\n\nI had the Chiarello family wine and it was great!\n\nWill definitely go back.\n\nP.S. not a place for kids.", "author": "Hari B."}

Wonderful food.\n\nSituated a couple buildings from the Ferry Building, Coqueta is right by the water on the Embarcadero.  It's not a big place, there's a bar area for those who are walk ins or just want to sit and chat with fellow strangers and then there is the dining room which is small but cozy.\n\nWe ordered a variety of things as usual and seeing as how they were tapas, we ordered a bit more.  Some of the tapas included uni and lardo over toast, iberico ham, salmon and cheese over toast, calamari, octopus, duck and pork meatballs and more.  Entrees included branzino, quail and paella.  Some stood out more than others such as the branzino, octopus and salmon over toast.  Paella was decent but I felt it was missing something and that something might have been the aioli that came with it.  My fiancee ordered the modern take of sangria and was it good.  It was more like two scoops of sorbet with some fruit and gelee but definitely pretty cool.  I definitely like the idea they had some modern takes on cocktails which makes it fun.  \n\nDessert was okay, too much of a salty sweet thing going on for our liking.  Service for the most part was good except for in the beginning it took them nearly 20 minutes before they took our food order and they never brought out a candle or anything even though I reminded the waiter it was my brother's birthday.  Luckily he didn't care since we had a Humphrey ice cream cake waiting for him.\n\nThere aren't a lot of great tapa places around so it's a good thing Chef Chiarello opened one because it is definitely worth trying and coming back.", "author": "Pierre L."}

We ordered the octopus, potatoes, uni crostini like dish, and razor clams.  My favorites were the potatoes (although prepared differently than what I'm used to...almost like a tator tot) and the razor clams.  The uni was very fresh and good too but I felt like it needed a touch of salt to contrast and bring flavors out.  The octopus dish was pretty good too.  Pretty tender but not to sound snotty I have had it another place a lot better.  \n\nFor dessert my friend ordered the sangria popsicle while I ordered the churro.  The popsicle was pretty tasty.  There was this poprock like sprinkles on top that when you eat with the popsicle pops in your mouth and gets it tingly.  Kind of fun.  I enjoyed my churros.  I like that they have the chocolate dip for it.  \n\nOverall experience here is great.  Even when busy the server tried to make sure she checked on us.

Got seated 1/2 hour after our reservation and was told it was a 'fabulous' table- we were wedged between two tables with literally 3 inches apart. The music was loud and we could not even hear ourselves. The Chiarrello Bianca wine was lovely- sangria 'ok' but was only infused with fruit- no fruit in the glass. Cheese plate and olives were tasty but only came with three tiny overdone homemade crackers. And the paialla was stone cold. Our waitress barely addressed us and forgot one tapa and shoved it next to the paella as if it were an afterthought.\n No mussels, just overdone dried clams with paper thin slivers of chorizo that were literally like shoe leather. The broccoli chard was without florets and were reminiscent of dried bitter parsley bits. The four jumbo prawns looked good, but when you picked them up they were cold, and the heads just fell off. Mushy, cold and LAYERED with salt. The rice was mushy on the outside and firm on the inside- not cooked, and unpalatable. Mr.Chairello, very,very disappointing for $200. Didn't bother with dessert.

Last Saturday was the second time I've gone and I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars because not every dish was a hit and your wallet takes a hit when the bill comes. Granted this shouldn't be a huge shock considering the location, and the view/ambiance is awesome. The interior of the restaurant is really interesting and the outside bar area is a great place for cocktails before dinner.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our reservation and were a little disappointed that they tried to seat us at the bar. Since we made the reservation far in advance and asked if there was a table available, they were nice enough to accommodate but had to wait an extra 35 minutes in the packed bar/tent area.  The outside bar had some of the best and most interesting cocktails I've had. A++ for the conquistador and also high scores for the Revolution. We tried a few others as well and they were good. \n\nAs for food, most of our selections were outstanding but a few were pretty average. We tried the chorizo pinxtos which were fun, bite-sized piece of meat, but at 2.50$ each it's tough to get too many. We also started with the open faced smoked salmon sandwich, a great choice. Another hit was the meatballs. The wood grilled octopus was hit or miss, some in the party loved it, others thought just ok. It wasn't tough, I just think some people don't like octopus. We tried the paella which was a huge portion and it was good to try, but didn't knock our socks off which was a bit of a disappointment. The pork loin dishes are must tries. The pluma is fantastic and has a great sauce with it, but at 38$ for a few bites your left feeling unsatisfied. We got churros for dessert which were forgettable.\n\nThe service was good, very helpful, especially giving advice with cocktail options. We will surely be back but dinner wasn't cheap, total bill around 220$ for two. We ordered lots of food because we wanted to try so many things, next time we'll go a bit lighter.", "author": "Kate N."}

Settling for a reservation at 11:30am (a dinner reservation was out of the question unless procured weeks in advance) we went with an open mind and best intentions. \nThe drink menu was unusual and exciting and did not disappoint! The waitress patiently helped us in choosing great cocktails. From there, things went downhill. While I realize Iberico ham is expensive,  the minuscule portion and ridiculously inflated price left us feeling robbed. The gaspacho was average and the serving thimble sized. Tater Tots are not Patatas Bravas. Call them something else. The house cured anchovies were good as were the croquettes. \nThey did remember to bring the birthday desert, which was decorated nicely, but the person who set it down said he would be bringing his coworkers over to sing to us. So we waited. And waited. Did he forget he just left us there? We never found out. \nI do have to mention the Churros con chocolate was the best dessert item. The raspberry powder was a clever twist. \nService slowed at the end and the crowning blow was that we left the restaurant hungry after paying over $400 for six people. We ordered a LOT of tapas but the portions were tiny. \nFinally, you don't have to go to Spain to get your wallet jacked. Just go to Coqueta!", "author": "Madelaine H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-13", "description": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I'm having a very difficult time remembering all the dishes I sampled at Coqueta, however, I do remember it being impressive. Unlike my other reviews, I'll write about my overall experience and not mention/elaborate on specific menu items. \n\nCoqueta, situated just a stone's throw away from The Ferry Building, is a hip and rowdy establishment. Lunch on a cloudy Saturday? Crowded. Reservations are highly recommended during all hours. A great place to eat and drink, Coqueta has the makings to be a true player in the dating scene. If you're single, check this place out. If you're casually dating, take your girl/guy here. If you're tied down by the old ball and chain, go anyway, the food is delicious. \n\nUpon arrival, you'll immediately notice their mixologists whipping up specialty cocktails at the bar. Gin and tonics dressed with aromatics like orchids and rosemary stems. Sangria garnished with fresh fruit. Mojitos with a modern twist that would make any Cuban proud. These bartenders know their stuff and they put their skills on full display with each glass. Like a deadly woman, Croqueta's drinks are sinfully beautiful and deceptively strong enough to bring you to your knees once you get close enough. If you're not careful, she'll (the drinks) will burn a whole in your wallet. \n\nThe atmosphere is sexy, rustic and charming all rolled into one. The bar area is surrounded by windows, which gives you a clear 360-degree view of the surrounding area which includes the bay. The main dining room has super high ceilings. With the whole place decked out with beautiful wood and dark tones, it provides a very sultry vibe... I imagine it's even more so when night falls. \n\nService is what you expect. Although it's excellent, the staff is a little \"firm\", almost robotic, with very calculated and precise movements that probably stemmed from formal training. Everything from the way they conversed with us, to delivering our food, to setting down our drinks, everything was done like they rehearsed it a million times. Responses to our questions were always calm and borderline monotone, but clear and to the point. Hand gestures were very proper, almost like a conductor commanding an orchestra. Coqueta's service is great but I prefer a more laid back approach. However, I do appreciate the obvious attention they put into it. \n\nThe food... The undisputed star of the whole production. With everything going on at Croqueta, from the specialty cocktails to the decor to the service, they do an amazing job of letting their food shine brighter than everything else. Small plates. Tapas. Prepared and cooked to perfection. Everything is made to be shared. One order of any menu item will satisfy 3-4 people. Eating here is much like speed dating. It's dish after dish, bite after bite with little time during and in between each one. My party and I probably went through 12 different menu items. Everything from mouthwatering cured meats to duck and cherry meatballs to oilve oil poached prawns to wood-grilled octopus to a watermelon and ham salad to... to... to... can't remember the rest. All I know is that by the time the bill came, we were all very satisfied with our experience. At about $50/person pre-tip, it was a little steep for lunch (this is my one knock on the place).\n\nA restaurant running like a super oiled machine, spitting out incredible food at precision pace, Croqueta won't disappoint. Everything on their menu, including the things we didn't try, are and sound delicious. Eating tapas, to me, is best described as going backpacking in a foreign land without a map - with unexpected twists and turns that lead you to all sorts of pleasant surprises and first experiences. Each stop (dish) is different than the last and keeps you wondering what lies ahead. When you reach your final destination (paying the bill), you can't help but look back on your travels and reminisce your favorite moments. \n\nAnd like all great getaways, you can't wait to go back.", "author": "Bruce C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-25", "description": "The space at Coqueta is divided into two parts at Pier 5: a semi-outdoor bar area and an indoor dining room. We started our evening waiting for our table at the bar area and had a pre-dinner cocktail there (more about that later.) It was definitely crowded, but there was a nice ocean breeze blowing through. We were then seated at a 5 person table in the dining room. The room has a warm, really jovial feel to it with a beautiful open kitchen. The next time I come, I'd like to sit at the bar seats facing the kitchen so I can watch Chef Michael cook. That would be super fun!\n\nThe drinks:\n1. Barca Gin & Tonic- Now I am NOT a gin girl, but this drink was absolutely amazing. It was so crisp and refreshing and went down incredibly smooth. I would come back just for this cocktail alone.\n2. Tariff Gin & Tonic (minus the iberico)- This just didn't do it for me. I normally love blood orange anything, but this drink was nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe the iberico ham is the x factor that I was missing (since I don't eat red meat.)\n\nTapas Frias (cold tapas):\n3. Baby Beets- this salad with watercress, beet vinaigrette, beet tierra, and blue cheese snow (yes, snow) was really delicious.\n4. White Gazpacho- I am not a huge fan of gazpacho, but this one was creamy, rich, and incredibly flavorful. The almonds really came through each bite.\n\nMontaditos (open-faced sandwiches):\n5. Pan con tomate- this never arrived \n6. Smoked Salmon- I tend to find smoky flavors a little too meaty, but I thoroughly enjoyed the queso fresco truffle honey spread on this dish.\n 7. House-cured chorizo- I don't eat chorizo, but those who did loved this dish so much that they ordered a second round. Must have been pretty great!\n\nTapas Calientes (hot tapas): \n8. \"Tattas\" bravas without ham- these were probably my least favorite item of the night. Vaguely glorified tator-tots. I usually love patatas bravas, so this was a bit disappointing.\n9. Gambas al negro- these head on prawns came in an amazing olive oil, black garlic, chili sauce that was to die for. They seriously need to bottle and sell this sauce alone as a bread-dipping condiment. YUM.\n10. Grilled razor clams- The clams were a little chewy, but the meyer lemon & ramps \"salsa\" mixture on top was super flavorful.\n11. Whole Calamari- These were really fresh and delicious.\n12. Crispy shrimp & chickpea pancake- Definitely one of the highlights of the night. The texture was great and the flavor didn't overpower the shrimp. SO good!\n\nRaciones (family-style):\n13. Arroz con Vieira- This grilled tomato rice was cooked to perfection and the scallops on top were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wish I could have this alone for dinner once a week. YUM!\n\nDessert\n14. Churros with chocolate sauce- SO amazing! I really really loved the warm flaky churro (and definitely ordered a second round.) Several people at my table may have even been seen eating the chocolate sauce after the churros were finished. \n15. The apple pie- the apples were sliced in a beautiful thin presentation that fun to look at and eat. It was served with a cold blue cheese ice cream.\n16. The cheesecake- they were out of cheesecake which hurt my heart a little bit.\n\n\nA few lows points of the meal:\n\n1. The wait staff was amazingly kind and friendly and incredibly helpful. They seemed to be having some trouble with getting things out or items getting lost between the kitchen and our table. Our first food items came out before our drinks which I found a bit odd. At one point we had only eaten about 4 of the many items we ordered, and we were told we only had 1 item left to come out- very confusing. We had to clarify the long list of dishes that had not yet arrived. Fortunately, our waitress handled all of this in the best way she possibly could- she was incredibly apologetic and helpful. I'm sure these kinks will be worked out in no time.\n\n2. The cana de cobre cheese and pan con tomate never arrived.\n\n3. At two points during the meal I asked Chef Chiarello to take a picture with me.  The first time we were at the bar waiting for our table and I shook his hand and asked and he said he \"would come right back.\" He never returned. I did have a quick 20 second chat with him outside the bathroom though! The second time was about half way through our dinner and he was taking a picture with a neighboring table and my cousin asked on my behalf again and he said \"Sure! Let me just take something off the grill.\" Now I don't think it is necessary for a chef to take pictures with the diners, but given that both times he said he would, I was disappointed. This was especially true because a) I drove 45 minutes each way to eat dinner there because I'm a fan of his and b)  I saw him drinking wine, taking pictures, and chatting with a bunch of other diners, and I felt excluded. Granted, some of them were friends of Chef Chiarello, but still there was no way I'd ask a third time because that would just be lame. Sadface.", "author": "Vinitha R."}

It takes forever and a day to wave down a server, and then you wait some more for them to bring you your drinks... then it's another painfully slow wait for them to take your food order. The bill can also be quite high. Yes, i know it's Tapas, but still.. $150 for two and we were merely standing by the bar and munching (or are we really fatties??) \n\nBut in reality, I have such a damn good time every time that I'm there, that I feel obligated to give this place a 5-star review. \n\nThe adult beverages are not only good, they are beautiful to look at. Perhaps we ordered one too many gin & tonic because of all the pretty flowers that come with them. The service may be slow, but it is because they are usually swamped. I mean, who doesn't love to sip on a pretty drink in a chic space right on the Embarcadero? Anyone who's swanky needs to stop by here right after work with your red-bottom heels and name-brand bags. (ok, too far but you get my point.)\n\nThe food is wonderful too. Everything we ordered was flavorful, and hence you don't really need THAT much food. I suggest going with a few people and trying a few dishes from each section of the menu to get the full experience of what Coqueta offers. \n\nSo all in all, well-crafted drinks and a well thought out menu.

The food, service, ambience, etc.  all, spectacular!\n\nGreeted by friendly staff, sat promptly, and immediately welcomed by our server.  The first recommendation was their gin & tonic. I'm not a gin or tonic person at all. It is basically my least favorite drink of all time.  But this came highly recommended, so I went for it:\n\nBar\u00e7a Gintonic $12\nbloom london dry gin, fever tree mediterranean tonic, grapefruit, juniper, and local pine \n\nWow. No joke, this drink was amazing. I loved it so much, now every morning I wake up and immediately have a glass full of gin waiting for me next to my bed.  Ok, that part isn't true, and I doubt I'll ever order another gin & tonic as my drink of choice, but when I return to Coqueta, that is a different story.  It was just flat out delicious and crazy refreshing.

(please allow 30-40 minutes to prepare)  (serves 2):  $40.00\n\nWe were very happy to have our server recommend each of these dishes along the way.  Everything paired extremely well with the following selection.  I was incredibly impressed all the way through.  The only thing that fell short was the Paella in my mind.  Compared to everything, just didn't hold up. And was also pretty full by that point, which played a factor.  And it was a lot of food.\n\nBut that last bit is minor, and doesn't detract from my rating. Because Coqueta is awesome. I will definitely be back.

Hubby loves Paella, so we went a different route this time and did more of a traditional dinner with a couple of tapas as appetizers and a couple of the larger dishes as entrees. We had a lovely and enthusiastic server who sang the praises of a pork shoulder \"Pluma\" dish with honey chili glaze and a side of mushrooms. I took her suggestion for my own dinner and it was delicious. Hubby loved his paella and has dinner now for the next couple of days since it's a serving intended for 2-3 people and he was eating it all by himself (I'm not a fan of paella). We had the yummy, smoky patatas bravas again and they were just as good as I remembered. We also had this yummy brioche with apple and goat cheese inside it and a side of quince honey. Our server described it as \"a little bit sweet, a little bit savory. It's delicious!\" She was right on again with her recommendation. It was delicious.

The food is innovative and every dish is presented with pizzazz. At first glance, the menu is a bit confusing to get around; it is mainly designed for you to order small plates called tapas, which allow you to order several different dishes on the menu, which is perfect for someone like me who often wants to try many items on a menu-or if you can't make up your mind. The flavors of the various foods we tried were spectacular! I suppose if I had to pick a favorite dish it would be the wood-grilled octopus, but it's a very tough call!  For a non-alcoholic drink, the J & T Referesco (Juniper, Lime, Fever Tree Mediterranean Tonic.) is the way to go; it has the sophistication of an alcoholic beverage, and most importantly, tastes amazing-it's refreshing-and is presented superbly, but I won't spoil the surprise and tell you how. \n\nThe service is exceptional. The staff is incredibly astute.  As an example, at one point, my husband got up from the table and the wait staff slyly folded his messy looking napkin. Searching hard for downfalls, the tables are too close together and it took me some time to get acclimated to the music which is on the loud side, but it's only because it was unexpected, and before long it was just part of the scene and I hardly noticed it. The vibe in the restaurant is like you are at a happening spot (Which you are!), but it does not have to try too hard to be that cool place, it just is.\n\nFor two people, expect to pay around $100 for enough food/beverage to satisfy your hunger pangs-and that's if you don't order an entree (which is not necessary), but every dollar is well worth the money. I can't wait to go back here and have some repeats and try a few more dishes and get another J & T. Go if you can, you won't regret it. Oh, and save room for dessert!", "author": "Karen L."}

You're officially one of my favorite restaurants ever now, though you're way above my pocketbook level.\n\nMy elderly Mom was visiting from out of town, and I had planned to take her to a different restaurant on fourth street. After waiting for a bus for about an hour, some kind soul told us the street was closed, and the buses had been rerouted due to a demonstration. We attempted to go to both the left and right side street for a work-around bus: both streets ran in the wrong direction. By then my Mom was getting tired and it was getting late. She was just tired and was looking longingly in the direction of McDonalds.\n\nEating at McDonalds while in SAN FRANCISCO?!!! Not on my watch!!!\n\nThank you whichever mayor is responsible for universal wifi, because I was able to check back-up plan restaurant directions on yelp on my Kindle (I don't have a cellphone). from Market street. \n\nOne such back-up plan was Coqueta. It was on the original list because it contained some Basque items, and Mom wanted to try Basque food. I had crossed it off the list because it seemed way too trendy, seemed to require reservations, seemed to involve communal tables, and seemed to be out of our price range. But it was located near the BART station (enabling us to go home soon after eating), and we were only blocks away. It was our best option.\n\nWhen we straggled in, Coqueta had less than an hour left open. They asked us if we had a reservation. Coqueta gets 5 stars just for what happened next.\n\nAt most 5 star restaurants the host/hostess will then assess you for how rich you are, how many drinks you will most likely buy, how big your party is, how you are dressed, how big a tip you are likely to leave. These guys didn't even hesitate (and there were two - no dispute between them): they saw a moderately (poorly?) dressed woman dragging in her exhausted elderly mother, and they found us a table. No reservations necessary. \n\nWe got our own table - not the communal table. It had a great view of the Bay Bridge with its fantastic light show! I actually did want to order a cocktail out of gratitude, but they were out of the one I tried to order. D:\n\nBut the kind service we got is not the best part. The best part was the food! We ordered 4 plates of tapas that turned out to be so generously proportioned, we needed a to-go box later. And it was DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS!!!\n\nThe very best thing was the duck and sour cherry meatballs. Heavenly scrumptious. Possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted. I'm so glad that's the dish Mom and I were wise enough to get 2 of. We also had a crispy shrimp griddlecake, and the crispy potatoes). I had coffee - I can't remember whether my Mom had anything else to drink. The bill ran us in the $50 range, which I swear just ONE of those duck/cherry meatballs was worth!\n\nThe next day I was happy to mention Coqueta by name when I described the little misadventure with the closing of fourth street to friends.

My date thought I brought her here, so she can shed a few pounds with the small amount of food they offer. After I bought her some booze she started to mellow out a bit and we both enjoyed the remainder of our date. Anyway, we both had the pleasure to enjoy the beet salad, grilled octopus, and the paella for two, which was more for one person.

It was the most tender and well seasoned octopus I've ever had. The duck and pork meatballs were very flavorful as well. For the main dish, we got the paella to share. It took about 30-40 minutes because they make each one individually but the timing worked out perfectly with the tapas.

We were excited to taste for ourselves what the hype was about, hearing it was great from a friend who'd been twice in one week already.  \n\nWhen we sat down, we were greeted by our server who seemed to have trouble annunciating, which made it hard to understand her though out the evening.  Strange.  Anywho, after perusing the menu and having a hard time deciding because everything sounded so good, we started with the chef's selection of meats and cheeses.  It was a pretty great board with lots to choose from.  Next came the grilled octopus, which was done as well as I've ever had it, but then the disappointing papas fritas, which were basically 8 fancy \"tots\" at about a buck a piece.  We also tried the asparagus (don't bother) and pallela, which was yummy though with overly greasy rice. \n\nRight around this time, Michael C himself sauntered into the joint and we soon discovered it was because some of San Francisco society socialites (BARF!) had just walked in.  Note to self, if you want any special attention from the exec chef, be a Traina.  We requested MC swing by our table to say hello, but in the 20 minutes that transpired afterwards, he never bothered.  Too bad because one of the people I was dining with buys out fancy restaurants for a living.  Just goes to show you never know who you are snubbing off.\n\nWe tried a couple desserts and decided, overall, with or without MC in the building, the food was good, not great.  Maybe people are star struck by having a brand new celeb chef destination in SF, but we are not in a rush to return.

Dress code is casual - walking in in jeans and sneakers is no problem, but dressing up for fun is fine too.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful in guiding us on what to order, how much for our group, etc.  We did get a pitcher of sangria and a pitcher of sherry mojito - light, fruity, and refreshing - our group is not much for drinking, but everyone enjoyed it.\n\nIt seemed like almost everything we ordered was really delicious - the sunny-side up huevos with shrimp, the chicken and pea croquettes, the grilled octopus were our favorite tapas and a must-try. The kale salad and chard - were just OK. The uni open faced sandwich was good too  - but when considering how expensive it was it was two tiny circles of toast with uni and proscitto, just a bit bigger than a bagel bite, I don't think I would order that one again! We ordered two plates of each tapa so our group of 8 could try everything. Our main entrees were the 1) ribeye - so juicy and amazing, they bring out the ginormous gorgeous meat before cutting it so we can see it in it's full glory, a showstopper entree, 2) the pork pluma with honey-chili glaze - my favorite but the bigger pieces were just too rare for me and we sent half of it back to be seared which they did with a smile (thankful the waitstaff was down to earth and did not try to shame us for not digging extra rare pork - no matter what the pig's pedigree), and 3) the paella  - beautiful but at that point we were all stuffed and don't think we could really appreciate how good it was.\n\nFor dessert we got the churros and flan. Maybe I am crazy but I liked the flan more! I just don't know if these fancy churros with chocolate dipping sauce are really better than Disneyland churros...It was good - but again, may not have been able to really appreciate it since I was so stuffed.\n\nIn short - amazing food, beautiful restaurant, and a perfect place to celebrate with friends.

The restaurant is beautiful - located right on the water with a cute little bar area in what looks like a converted greenhouse. Between three people, we shared the following: \n\nJamon serrano: Really good, comes with little biscuits as well. The perfect balance of smoky and salty\nHouse-cured white anchovies: Not a fan. My brother loves anchovies, so he really enjoyed the dish. I never really like anchovies, so my review on this dish is definitely skewed\nPan con tomate: good, but not spectacular. It was basically two small slices of bread with an oil/tomato paste. \nSmoked salmon: My favorite dish! I would describe these as mini bagel bites. They are little round crispy bagels (basically) smothered with fresh cheese, drizzled with honey, and topped with layers of delicious smoked salmon. I could eat 20 of these. \nPatatas bravas: Deep fried potatoes...what else do you really need to know? It's hard to mess these up\nChicken and English pea croquetas: These were my second favorite. Imagine chicken pot pie, but instead of a pastry shell you have a breadcrumb/fried coating\nWood-grilled octopus: Super tender octopus with fingerling potatoes. This was a great dish, but by this point I had eaten so many potatoes. \nFlan: So delicious :D I love flan! This was a super rich and creamy flan topped with huckleberry compote. I would definitely recommend this as the finishing touch to your meal\n\nOverall, I would have given Coqueta 5 stars but the portions are just too tiny! I understand that this is tapas style, but I would have liked to receive a bit more per plate.", "author": "Anna N."}

Then we were told they were also out of calamari.How can you be out of 3 dishes in one night?\nThen we tried the gambas which unfortunately tasted slightly chemical. The vegetable side dish was ok but nothing noteworthy.\nCheeses were also fine but the slightly sweetened cracker with it was not to my liking.We asked for extra toast and were charged 2.00 for it.\nThe chocolate dessert takes 20 min to make..It was also just ok.\nNice and hip interior, great job on that. Great bar  area ,too.\n\nService was fine. The Spanish whites we had were excellent (250ml ,not by the glass) but then I asked for red wine, my friend for another white. The server must not have been thinking and poured the new white in my old white which still had some in it(diff variety). After I told him( he didn't even notice) the mistake was quickly corrected and I got some more of my old white back.\n\nA bit of a nightmare.

Having dined there on numerous occasions and previously enjoyed good food and attentive service, we were astonished by the poor treatment we experienced on our last visit.\n \nWe reserved a table a month in advance and after traveling a great distance, upon arrival we were escorted to the counter. My girlfriend was in a full leg brace and it was obvious she couldn't sit on a tall stool up against counter without room for her leg. When I pointed out to Antonio that I didn't ask for a counter seat and needed my reservation for a table honored to allow her to sit down, he simply informed me \"This is all there is.\"  That was the extent of his interest and his attempts to resolve the situation and accommodate our needs. When I emphasized that she was unable to bend her knee and needed a chair, not the cramped counter, Antonio responded \"I don't have a table for you.\" His arrogance and insensitivity was shocking. \n \nNeedless to say, we did not dine there and left the restaurant very frustrated with the way we were treated and how badly this was handled.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-04", "description": "3.5 stars.  5 for atmosphere / 4.5 for staff (aside from waitress) / 3 for food / 2 for prices.  Being huge fans of Bottega (where we ate the night before), we had high expectations for Coqueta, but have to say food was just okay for the money.  Being right on the water the space has a great feel and the staff in general was great, but from the second you walk in you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for everything (which is the opposite of Bottega).  We went expecting to drop a bomb on food as that was kind of the point of this splurge trip to San Francisco, so didn't mind the high menu prices, but rather the way things were forced on you.  For instance, as soon as you sit down they bring you a tray with about 2 dozen \"bite sized skewers\" (Pintxos) which they present as an amuse-bouche (which is almost expected at nicer restaurants these days); however, once you take one, waitress explains they are $2.50 each (really not worth it for food that has just been sitting out and visited every table in restaurant...ick....and yes, I have spent time in Spain, where this is done at bars, but this just feels wrong). \nMoving on, we each ordered about 2 Tapas plates (there were 4 of us) and Paella....we were going to add on more but waitress said it would be plenty of food.  Since on the topic of pricing, I have to jump forward to our bill before covering food flavor.  When we got our bill we were surprised to to see that we had been charged extra for every single dish...presumably to make it split-able for 4 people....the problem is that the waitress made no mention of this and we did not tell her we wanted to split the dishes (in fact some of the dishes were for certain people as other people at table had food issues and could not split).  It would have been totally been fine if she mentioned this, but instead just decided to add this to our bill which just seemed slimy.\nOkay, so onto the food.\nCroquetas De Pollo:  Tasty fried croquettes....hard to screw up something like this so obviously good.\nGambas al Negor:  Very good and has a nice kick to it with the pepper.\nTotillita de Camaron: Everyone felt this was okay but not great.\nPulpo a la Parilla:  The grilled octopus was highlight of entire meal and wish I just ordered several plates of it.  It was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth.\nAlbondigas a la Feria: The duck meatballs just felt kind felt kind of flat.  Maybe it was that the cherry sauce was too weak....raspberry would make it a million times better.\nPatatas Xips e Salsa Apertivo: The chips are great, but $7 for 6 small potato chips is just ridiculous (this should be something they just include with the meal).\nHuevos Nacional: Great presentation and overall taste, but the bonito essentially tastes like chicken of the sea.\nEsparrago Trigeros con Remesco: excellent flavor and taste.\nEnsalada de Remolacha:  good, but ridiculously small serving size.\nPaella: Says it serves 2-3, but really the seafood is about enough for 1.5, and the rice is for 3.  It was okay, but dry and really not any better than any standard corner Spanish restaurant (which we have a lot of in NYC).\n\nBy the way, the Sangria is really nice and light and refreshing.\n\nIn summary, it is good and has a great atmosphere, but we weren't blown away and while we expected to spend a lot, felt deceived by how hidden costs were added to the bill.\n\nFinally, I have to say that  I am impressed with how present Michael Chiarello is at his restaurants.  He was at Coqueta greeting people when we were there, and has been doing the same thing at Bottega 3 of the 4 times we have been there....I rarely see the owners at the big name restaurants in NYC.", "author": "Jonathan H."}

There's been a lot of hype surrounding this place on pier 5. The bar area is actually pretty big and had open seats when we arrived for our 8:30pm reservation on a Monday. Unfortunately, as the dining room is small and the previous party was lingering, we waited an additional 30 min for our table (some other people waiting way past the reservation time actually just took seats at the bar).\n\nDrinks: loved their cocktails and also pitchers\n- Tarriff: probably my favorite of the night - iberico ham infused gin, cava, acorn and apricot tonic\n- Conquistador: fennel salt rim is a good match for the apple flavor\n- Sun never sets: torched meringue and pineapple!\n- Sangria pitcher: traditional, not too sweet\n- Rebujito pitcher: not a huge cinnamon fan, but interesting\n* The pitchers are fun because you can actually pour them directly into your mouth.  Drinks are pretty strong\n\nSmall plates:\n- Stone fruit salad: loved the peach with queso fresco, crunch from the nuts\n- Croquetas: warm, deep fried goodness that was crisp on the outside and basically like a chicken pot pie inside.  The heirloom tomatoes are a nice, sweet complement.\n- Grilled octopus: wonderful charred flavor, tender, served with potatoes\n- Sunny side up egg: with shrimp, potato, and chorizo dressing.  The yolk was nice and runny.. this would be awesome at brunch!\n- Calamari: grilled whole with squid ink aioli and onion jam\n- Gambas: head on, plump and super sweet, great flavor, and it came with toasted bread slices to soak up extra sauce \n- Crispy shrimp: a crisp deep fried pancake with lots I shrimp and topped with a yellow saffron aioli\n- Albondigas: pork and duck meatballs, moist, loved the tart cherry puree on top\n- Mar y montana: open faced iberico and uni sandwich: like an open faced slider, very rich with iberico and uni\n\nLarger dishes:\n- Pluma: pork shoulder, loved the sweet glaze, actually leaner than I expected \n- Paella: sort of had a crust, served in the traditional pan, takes 30-40 min to prepare, so you should order it early on\n\nDesserts:\n- They were able to make me affogato with a blue cheese ice cream, which was awesome \n- I can't really remember the last dessert we got... something with fruit..?  blame it on the drinks\n\nIt's a fun place for a group of 4-6 so that you can share pitchers and try lots of different dishes.

We started with a bottle of the 7 Fuentes wine, which was great. I've been wanting to try paella since I first learned of it as a child in my Spanish class. They prepare it a la carte and so you need to order it at the start of your visit. We ordered a few cheeses -- a goat cheese and a sheep cheese. It came served with some quince (I haven't found that anywhere! Last time I had it was in Europe), almonds and these beautiful sugar-crusted crispy flat breads. Everything tasted so beautiful together! Next came the mushrooms, which were such the perfect blend of a few, seasoned with garlic and just the right amount of heat, as well as these chicken and cheese bites. I think we were expecting a chicken \"nugget\" but were delightfully surprised at how they had shaped the chicken and bread crumbs around the cheese, which was perfectly melted and gooey inside. The orange pieces it was served with gave such a smooth and not-too-sweet finish to the bites. And then the paella came out. The rice was perfectly al dente and a beautiful gold from the saffron. The chorizo and seafood in it blended so beautifully together. We finished the evening with an order of churros (served with such a beautiful cacao sauce -- not too sweet, which we LOVED!) and an order of the manchego cheesecake lollipops. So much awesomeness! Our waiter was so great about making recommendations and he was incredibly sweet :) We will definitely be coming back here! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.

I found them to be consistently rude, from when I called to make a reservation, to the matre'd, to everyone in the place.  It feels like a typical hot restaurant that does not care about the patrons, but once they are not the newest greatest thing they will be kissing everyone's ass.\nIf you want to be treated like you do not matter and they are doing you a favor serving you.

When we got seated, we were in a table clearly meant for 3, when we were 4.  Due to this, the ENTIRE remainder of the night the waitstaff kicked my chair EVERY SINGLE TIME they came to table....and not one of them even once apologized.  (I was slightly annoyed that we were not given a proper table for four since I had made the reservations 11am the first day I could.  I expect to be shoved into a corner as a 'walk-in').\n\nWe ordered:  \n\nEl Gran Plat Cap ($38), very good\nHuevos Nacional ($7/two pieces, essentially paying $7 one egg), yuck!  Tasted like tuna/fish.\nColiflor con Romescu ($11), very good!\nPimientos de Padron ($10), good, just peppers with seasoning (can make at home)\nPulpo a la Parilla ($14), recommended by waitress, was ok.\nAlbondigas a la Feria ($14), good\nArroz Cremoso de Verano ($19), I enjoyed, friends did not.  Sizable portion.\nPluma ($38) - good but COMPLETELY overpriced.  We got 7 thin teeny slices, not like the pics other posted.  \n\nChurro 'Fantasia, ($10), good\nManchego cheesecake ($4), very good\n\nPlus we ordered some drinks, some wine and coffee.  Our bill was easily $250 (I was treated to dinner).\n\nOverall not at all impressed with food or waitstaff.  It reminded me of restaurant week in NYC.  The service is terrible because the waitstaff knows the gratuity is included in bill.  \n\nI also felt that the waitstaff provided different treatment to each table.  For instance the table next to us was told about every single plate that came out, we got maybe two explanations.\n\nNot sure why this is the 'place to go', as I was not at all impressed.

Is it casual dining as tapa places usually are, where you can chill and relax after work. grab some food on a decent budget?  Or is this fine dining, where everything is impeccable and can justify the prices on the menu?  Hopefully they find it's identity soon.\n\n3 gals enjoying a friday night out, we definitely planned to be there for awhile, so we ordered just a few tapas to start and the paella since that took a long time to cook.  We were going to just add to the order as the evening went on.  Sadly, after the first 2 tapas, we were so majorly disappointed, we had to make alternative plans afterwards.  we ordered the beet salad, you would think at that price, it wouldn't be just a spoon full of beets on a plate of nothingness.  wood grilled octopus - 6 minuscule pieces dotted with maybe half a fingerling potato cut into 4-5 pieces, those toothpicks are there for a reason, there's no way a fork can pick up such tiny pieces.   i understand the concept of small plate tapas, i was in Madrid/Barcelona just not too long ago.  But portion size does not justify the price.  Iberco Jamon...it's basically $10 per slice.  You get 3 paper thin slices cut into little tiny pieces on a square of newspaper.  Ouch!  Lastly, paella...at $40, you would think they would put a little more effort into this.  4 head-on shrimps, 5 small clams and 6 slices of root vegetable. The seafood was overcooked and the rice was overdone, someone left this under the broiler too long?  The one saving grace was the pork and duck meatballs, at least there were 3 meatballs so we didn't have to cut those little down to share, and the flavor was spot on.  Unfortunately, the overall meal left us hungry, unsatisfied and extremely disappointed.", "author": "Ames K."}

I wish I could report glowing reviews about Coqueta but unfortunately I cannot. \n\nArrived a bit early for our reservation so we sat in the bar area. Server in this area passed me twice without offering to show us a drink menu. Finally when he deigned it time to offer us a menu, he wasn't very hospitable or helpful in suggesting a drink for my friend. She chose a gin and tonic that had junipers in it and I had a taste of it. We were not impressed by amount of alcohol in it and my friend felt like the ornamental flowers kept getting in the way of drinking it. Points for effort but my drink is not where I would want the decoration. I don't like herbaceous beverages bec/ it tastes like I took a swig of a man's aftershave so I opted for the sangria. How could that be bad, right? Pretty watered down and not great. Would have died for some sangria from another veteran establishment in the Mission. Anyhoo... when it was time to dine, I did like the decor and the open feeling of the dining area. But hey, we are here for the food, right?? \n\nStarted with some jamon and deviled eggs. So-so on both. \n\nI had the \"salt air\" margarita which is salt infused foam as the air and an excuse to give me less margarita so it's 60% foam and 40% liquid. The glass is already a small so felt more like some sips of margarita with your foam. My friend had a spicy margarita with chili pepper in it but she requested a bit mild on the spice side and was just ok. \n\nThen we had the grilled octopus which was very good - tender on the inside, charred on the outside. The duck/pork meatballs were a tad gamey but tasty (3 included). We had another dish with squid and shrimp with puffed vermicelli. The shrimp were fabulous (2) but the other parts of the dish were not very notable. Finally, we had patatas bravas and they were cute little round balls with aioli on them.  \n\nOverall, pretty disappointed for the hype and left hungry so we went across the way for some fresh seafood which never lets us down. \n\nOur server in the dining area was great though and she was very helpful and warm but overall just couldn't make up for the rest of the experience.

All the cocktails were impeccably made and a craft of their own. Cups of garnishes filled the bar, and I just waited to see what the bartenders would do with them. My drink had a layer of meringue on top and torched for a crispy shell right before my eyes. I got the frozen gazpacho for dessert, which looked like it was freeze dried, so they had us try a piece before the sauce was poured on and we got to breathe \"smoke\" out of our noses which was a fun touch.

After she completed her lengthy conversation she told a fellow employee that the cards were currently unavailable because they were under a chair or box or something. By the way, this day manager, who clearly realized that I was waiting for her never acknowledged my presence.\n\nAnyway, I paid for a gift card, provided an address that the card should be mailed to and left. Interestingly, my credit card was charged two days later and after another five days passed I called to inquire about my gift card. Getting through to a live person via telephone was difficult at best and I finally reached someone at a sister restaurant called Bottega Napa Valley and ultimately I received apologies about my experience from the director of communications when I asked them to refund my money. The director of communications insisted on sending me a complimentary dining card or voucher and ultimately someone at Coqueta called and insisted on personally delivering the card. I really did not want to go through this and asked him, politely, to mail it and that I would try Coqueta and again consider purchasing gift cards for client referrals. I have been waiting for that card since May 10th so somehow, I don't think it is coming. \n\nI have never been a chef in life but here is an open suggestion to the restaurant owner Michael Chiarello.

IMHO the the bar/patio area is not suitable for customers with reservations and instead should be used strictly for walk-ins and waiting customers.  I requested with our host that we be moved to the main area but was told that it was not possible as \"those tables are also reserved.\"  This statement clearly made me feel like a 2nd rate diner as I was never given the option of choosing between the bar and the main room when making our reservation.   In fact, I feel we were regulated to the bar area based on our lack of \"star power\" or political eliteness.  Among our hundreds of fine dining experiences (which includes several Michelin Star restaurants), my wife and I have never been made to feel like this, especially with proper reservations.  However, based on my Coqueta experience and after reading other negative reviews on this newly opened celebrity restaurant, it is clear to me that Chef Chiarello is more concerned with entertaining celebrities and the SF political elite than operating a restaurant of fine dining quality (during our visit, we personally observed Chef Chiarello greet and take a few pics with some main room diners including Tour de France announcer Bob Roll.  My wife and I were standing near the exit as he walked out, and he didn't even bother to look our way).\n\nThe food itself was good but not absolutely great.  The best dish (out of the seven tapas we ordered) was between the Ibirico Secreto Pork or the honey-glazed Pluma pork shoulder.  And the wood grilled octopus???  We had better at a pizza joint in Philly (see Osteria).\n\nThe single highlight of the night was our friendly waitress Christin.  Based on the tools (or lack of) provided by her management, I believe she went above and beyond her duty to see that our experience was tolerable.  At one point, she even shoo'd away some waiting patrons who were leaning on our dining table.  The one star of this review solely belongs to her.....Thank you.", "author": "Adonis M."}

They either love or hate him. Not much in between. I happen to love Bottega and I had good feelings for what Coqueta had in store. I had been hanging out with friends in the earlier part of the day, had  a business meeting and by the time early evening rolled around, I wasnt ready to leave yet. So I headed to the bar at Coqueta. Low and behold a couple of other friends were sitting near by. So I joined them at their table. Got the Fideua, Gambas Negro, Iberico de Bellota, and the boquerones. All very tasty. Now the waterfront property means prices are up there, and Id say thats the only real drawback here. Our server knew my friends from another restaurant so I got taken care of by association. Id like to have a full large meal here and see how it compares to Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and the Basque Country but for snacks it's pretty solid.", "author": "Kim N."}

I've been wanting to try this place for a while, upon a friend's recommendation.  And, I'm so glad I did!  The only disappointments were the servers lack of any type of emotion: minus 1 star, and the patatas bravas were VERY different than the ones shown in users photos.  The ones we had were just small purple potatoes.  This version to me, wasn't even restaurant worthy: minus 1 star.  Everything else was pretty tasty.  Whenever I'm with my husband he tends to order a boatload of food.  Here is what the 3 of us had:\n* croquetas de pollo : MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT\n* grilled octopus: good, flavorful, not memorable\n* duck & pork meatball: Rarely eat meat, this tasted like a \"fauncy\" meatloaf, quite delicious\n* paella: Meh.  Wouldn't recommend; I've had better elsewhere\n* patatas bravas: not worth mentioning\n* ensalada de kale: good, loved the fresh garbanzo beans and strawberries, would want a slightly less acidic dressing\n* setas al ajillo: mushrooms!  tasty, but a little too oily, not really memorable\n* gambas al negro: MEH. took as recommendation from server - not worth the $14. \n\nMay come back to try other dishes.

We had heard good things about it and she had never had Spanish food so I thought it would be a god idea to go. I do NOT regret it\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is kinda hard to describe its a sort of like a small industrial hanger meets cowboy/Spanish ranch. I know that sounds silly but its the best I can do... Despite having the kitchen in the same room the place was fairly quiet even when it was packed. I just felt so cool eating at this place. Also its comfy and in a BEAUTIFUL location.\n\nStaff:\nThe staff was professional but incredibly laid back. They were so comfortable with each other and making little jokes left and right. My only complaint was that there were lots of staff members which just seemed excessive to me, considering they tended to leave us alone for the most part.\n\nFood:\n-We got: Pan con tomate (with ham), an organic tomato salad (special), patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, the \"Bakini\" (basically an eggplant sandwich), Chesecake, Chocolate fantasia and the pan con chocolate. \n\nNOTE this was about $75 before the tip if youre hungry id expect to pay about 30 to 40 a person.\n\nSo we ordered what seems like a lot of food but the portions here are small! I feel dumb saying this but, I do not recommend coming here if you're starving.\nThe food was all delicious but  our favorites were: the chicken croquettes, the special salad and the potatoes (honorable mention to the bread though, that was great too). My only complaint was with the \"bikini\"; although it was still a yummy bite, I thought the blue cheese was just too overpowering. Even the sweet sauce it comes with had to take a back seat to the cheese flavor, and you can forget about tasting anything else they say is in the sandwich. Other than that the dinner courses were top-notch and from what I remember of Spanish food very authentic, though the chef does have his interpretation of things.\nAs for dessert we both enjoyed it but I felt it was of SLIGHTLY lesser quality than the main courses. That being said, if youre coming here I recommend getting at least the Curros and chocolate dish, if you like cheesy cheesecake then youll like theirs. As for the pan con chocolate I wouldnt really recommend it, the ice cream is bland and the chocolate cake is not chocolaty... in fact I found it salty if anything.\n\nConclusions:\nThough I may have sounded harsh at times we both loved eating here and once I save up enough money I would be happy to go back again! Definitely the best and most authentic Spanish food in the bay, probably even in all northern California. This is really as good as it gets.\nOne last thing. If you have a \"party\" larger than 2 or 3 people I highly recommend getting a reservation a couple days in advance they get pretty busy.", "author": "Josh L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-16", "description": "I had really high hopes for this Spanish restaurant, but unfortunately the food just was not that good.\n\nWhat's great: the service and view of the bay. My husband and I received a very warm greeting as soon as we arrived. We sat in the bar area, and we had constant attention from various staff when it came to ordering/refilling of water cups/asking for more drinks/etc. \n\nWhat's also good: the decor. The bar area where we sat had some great seating, and I really appreciated that my bar chair had a back to lean on, as I noticed some people were using stools, which probably would not be as comfortable for long periods of time.  \n\nWhat's not so good: the food, oh no! I wanted this so badly to be yummy. My husband and I spent approx. $194 (w/tip) on dinner, and it was so lackluster. Here's what we had - \n\n** Mar y montana, sea and mountain ($12): small, just one bite, of iberico meat over sea urchin on toast. Too small of a taste to really appreciate anything. \n** Sopa de ajo ($6): small bowl of bread and garlic soup, with egg. It was good, my husband thought it had a heavy, oil flavor. I thought presentation could be better.\n** Gambas al negro ($14): 3 prawns. no flavor at all, and in fact, it tasted old to me (like that freezer burnt, defrosted flavor). Not a winner.\n** Whole Monterey calamari ($10): 3 calamari pieces. It came out tepid, so that was a bummer. Texture was nice, flavor was ok.\n** Grilled razor clams ($14): 3 clams with some wild ramps inside. This was a little smokey, but it worked well with the lemon.\n** Wood-grilled octopus ($12): we got to try this twice, as the chef sent out a first batch that he thought was too small and then subsequently sent out a little more. The first batch was not good - too chewy, tough and way too smokey (I think it's the paprika).  It came with little slices of potatoes, but it added nothing to the overall flavor. The second batch of octopus that came out was better: hot, good texture, not as smokey. So it may be hit or miss with this one.\n** Grilled albondigas ($11): 3 meatballs of duck/pork. It was coated with what tasted like BBQ sauce, so the meat could have been anything, and I wouldn't be able to tell because of the sauce. The sauce is too smokey.\n**  Vineyard greens ($6): GET THIS ONE! If you get anything on the menu, then get these mustard greens. I know, the simplest thing here on the menu, but the flavors of raisins, pine nuts and garlic are amazing. \n** Grilled Iberico Secreto ($22): Pork slices with watercress. The pork was good, a little tepid, but solid flavor with the simple spices for seasoning. I might get this one again.\n\nFinal tally: Out of 9 plates, just 1 stood out. :(\n\nDrinks: Tried 3 - Andalucia $10 (sherry cocktail, very very sweet), Kalimotxo $17 (wine/cola, sweet), Tariff $12 (gin/orange/cava, slips right down!).\n\nWhat's random: I thought the music didn't really match (for example, I heard a mix of the Fugees, then some Spanish music, then some hip hop).\n\nI wanted to like this place, but the menu needs some adjustment (read: less smokey!). Service and decor is great though, hopefully I'll be able to come back with a small group of friends.", "author": "Michelle S."}

If not for the horrific experience I endured at the hostess stand, this review would have definitely gotten five stars. The two ladies are covered from head to toe in some retro get up (that did not match the brilliant spanish ambience one bit). I walk into this gorgeous spanish restaurant delighted, feeling as if I was stepping into a piece of spain and I look up to see the hostess' dressed as cashiers from Ross a couple streets away in Union Square. This caused me quite some hesitancy. I approach the two ladies who cannot seem to look me in the eyes, one of my biggest peeves. I let them know that I am just walking in and they try for about ten minutes to find my reservation. As I am slightly confused I try to re-iterate that I have no reservation but it seems as though the hostess could not figure out her seating software and was more engaged in trying to sort that out than to get me seated. Terrible. After ten minutes she directed us to the bar area, not informing us if we can have a table in the dining room, or the bar, or anywhere! It did not matter! We just wanted to eat some food! We stood there waiting around for what felt like a half an hour before I checked back in to get a rude - \"sit at the bar there, right there\".  I was floored. I almost left.\n\nThough - I was glad I stayed.\n\nWhat made up for the horrific hostess? The server. The bussboy. The bartender. The food. The server was incredibly informative, sweet, and always there when we needed her. The bussboy never let my water glass get less than halfway empty and made sure to check that everything was running smoothly. The food was beyond incredible taking me back to Spain with each bite. The tapas style is definitely a favorite of mine. \n\nAfter finishing the meal off with one of the best dishes, the churros, I paid the bill (making sure to give a hefty tip to quite an extraordinary server) and made sure not to even glance at the hostess stand as the ending to the meal was too amazing to ruin.", "author": "Jon M."}

However, the service is super poor! We went here during the week for a quick dinner as it's within walking distance from our apt. We asked the staff if they can seat us quickly or not because we needed to pick up someone from the airport and we were in rush. The waiter told us that it should be less than 10 minutes. He gave us a menu and said why don't you wait here. I would take care of you as soon as the table outside becomes available. We did as he had asked us. \n\nThe first problem is that because the restaurant has a nice view people continue seating there for over 30+ minutes after paying their bills. The bigger problem is that the waiters are not trained enough to turn around the tables quickly. I have never been a waiter, but I presume you can ask the guests if they need anything else, take all the glasses and paid bill from their table to signal that you need to empty the table. We didn't witness any of these while we were waiting at Coqueta. \n\nSince the place is tiny and the waiter pretended that all the tables are managed by him, we presumed that all the tables are seated by the waiter and are not first come, first served. So we politely waited on the side until we would be seated by him. While waiting, we saw that different people are trying to push and get some seats. I walked to the waiter a few times and said it's more than 20 minutes we were waiting here and I saw different people grabbed some seats. Are you sure you are opening up a table for us soon? He said yes, yes. Anyways, after 40 minutes of waiting there, no table and no signs that any table would open up soon. I saw a couple standing at the table we were supposed to be seated at like two eagles giving bad looks to the ladies who paid their bill 40 minutes ago and yet hanging out at that table. At that point, I was sure that these tables should be first come, first served. I walked to the waiter and described the situation. I said, \"It seems this couple also are keen for the same table. Are you sure you will seat us there and this is not first come, first served?\" He said no no! That table IS first come, first served. I had smokes coming out of my head!!! He started apologizing, but it was too late! We were there for over 40 minutes while he was supposed to seat us in 10 minutes. Poor and deceiving service!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-15", "description": "As a fan of Bottega in Yountville, I've been excited to try Coqueta since I first heard about Michael Chiarello's plans to take over the Pier 5 space.  While there are several Spanish restaurants in San Francisco, there are few that are remarkable.\n\nIn an ideal location in one of the historical Pier buildings along the San Francisco waterfront, Coqueta offers a unique dining environment.  There are two distinct spaces offering a choice of dining experiences.  The bar or patio room is a glass-enclosed space that offers stunning views of the bay and busy waterfront.  With only counter space and a bar-height communal table in a room of floor-to-ceiling glass and iron, this is a high energy, lively and perhaps a little cramped cocktail and dining area.  But what you give up in creature comforts, you gain in a true San Francisco Embarcadero waterfront experience with some of the most inventive and tasty cocktails I've found, even with the current mixology craze.  Traditional cocktails and unique San Francisco inspired cocktails are found along side some truly Spanish traditions with a unique range of gin and tonics and sherry cocktails and a sangria that's on it's own level.  \n\nMoving into the main dining room you'll find a beautiful, warm, and very sexy dining room with the kitchen at its heart.  Deep rich colors, exposed wood beams, soaring ceilings, artfully done rich plaster walls, fire-scorched wooden tables, classic marble counters and a kitchen that doubles as theater for those lucky enough to be seated at the bar, all create an immersive experience that you don't find in may new restaurant spaces these days.  When we were taken to our table (on time by the way, which was a surprise given that they have just opened and are already booked up) there was Michael at the center of the kitchen behind the bar counter like a captain steering a ship.  It's comforting and unique these days to see someone with as much public presence as Michael Chiarello, still very hands on in every detail and every dish.\n\nNow for the food and service.  Given the tapas format, we were able to try a wide range of dishes.  And I must say that all but one were excellent!   A few were standouts.  The pinxtos or small one-bite tapas are artfully skewered and served vertically on a tray with the perfect combination and balance of flavors to highlight the main ingredient of quail egg, anchovy, or chorizo.  While the white gazpacho might be easy to skip over on the menu, please don't!  It's a traditional Spanish soup that you can't find here in San Francisco and it's outstanding.  Also the grilled octopus and grilled pork were exceptional.  Both were fresh, tender and with the flavor of the wood fire grill.  And while I cannot remember the name of the dish, there was dish served with shrimp, a fried egg, and fried potatoes that will be number one on my brunch list the next time I wake up with a hangover!  And finally, for dessert, again there were a wide range of excellent options but two that stood out were the Sangria popsicles with pop rocks (just try them), cheesecake bites served with caramel corn and the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream.\nAnd for a restaurant that has just opened, the service was outstanding from the hostess at the front to the waiter, buss staff and bartender. \n\nI can't wait to go back to try many of the dishes we missed.  And in addition to a destination location for dinner or lunch, Coqueta seems like the perfect place to stop off when a casual cocktail and a quick bite or two are in order when you're down along the waterfront.", "author": "Jeff H."}

Menus were still being printed upon arrival.  Michael Chiarello actually in the kitchen tonight making sure everything ran as well as it could.  For an opening night, I am confident in giving this restaurant five stars.  Chef Chiarello outdid himself with his new San Francisco outpost.  The menu is a wonderful combination of comfort and excitement.  Husband and I started with a variety of pinxtos (one bite tapas), the best one being the house cured boquerones (white anchovies with olives and peppers).  We then proceeded to order our fair share of tapas including, roasted padron peppers, patatas bravas, tortilla spagnola (called \"Andres\" here), crispy shrimp in a chickpea flour pancake, grilled albondigas, chicken & english pea croquettes -- each tapas was well seasoned, beautifully presented and more importantly so full of umami with a nod to authentic Catalan cuisine with the freshness of California produce.  Cal Pep would be proud of this place.\n\nWe ended our meal by sharing the Fideua, a traditional Catalan noodle dish similar to paella.  The dish came with a number of large tender shrimp and Iberico ham.  It was a really good version, almost as good as the one hubby and I had in Stiges at a fabulous beachside restaurant called La Santa Maria (but perhaps the setting played a part in why their fideua is still so memorable to me today).\n\nService was impeccable -- hats off to the maitre d' for running a tight ship.  Our server, Moe, was congenial, efficient and balanced the right amount of friendliness with professionalism.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful to look at and I love the bar seating to table ratio -- any restaurants with a pintxos bar needs a large bar!\n\nI have never done this before to an opening night, but I am so excited with this restaurant that it truly deserves five stars.", "author": "Hannah H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-05", "description": "The original incarnation of this location (Lafitte) holds a special place in my heart, but I was curious to see what Michael Chiarello had done with the joint.  It's lovely, though I feel like the waterfront location and soaring ceilings were better suited to the light and open look it had previously, versus this cozy Spanish vibe they were aiming for.  Maybe because it's summer, and we were there for dinner fairly early so it was quite \"daytime\" - it may work better when it's dark out.  The servers uniforms are cool, but just this side of costumey.  The staff seems very knowledgable, especially for not having been open very long.\nAn unexpected Chiarello sighting (being swarmed by excited, middle aged women) was a fun perk.  \nThe tortilla was good, as were some of the pintxos, and the board of meats and cheeses.  The chicken and pea croquetas were a standout - they were basically little chicken pot pies.  The octopus was tender, the gigantic steak was delicious (though gritty - I imagine that was pepper, but it felt like rocks), and the pan con tomate, while not traditional at all, was delicious.  A word of caution - pass the glass jar of tomato separately or it might slide off the board and shatter all over the table and everyone's food.  And that's where they lost me.\nCocktails were so-so to completely watered down (don't get me started on the nearly flavorless sangria).  The gambas were super fishy and unappetizing, as was the paella, but I'm not a fan of strong fish flavors, so maybe you'll be more impressed (I felt the same way about the anchovies, which I know I don't like but tried anyway, and the razor clams, which I skipped on account of knowing for certain that I don't like - though neither did anyone else at the table).  The tattas bravas tasted oddly chemical, the beet salad was okay but nothing special.  I liked the addition of raisins and pine nuts to the vineyard greens, but they weren't great.  I didn't try the churros (donuts are donuts), but I snagged a bite of one of the cheesecakes - eh.\nThere is better, more affordable Spanish food elsewhere in the city, but if you're a fan of MC, or looking for a swanky waterfront locale, it's worth a try.  Just don't come expecting great sangria.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

I'm a Michael Chiarello fan (although this review remains unbiased!) and didn't find the food as great as at Bottega, but it was still good nonetheless.  I really liked the decor of the dining room and high ceilings...the bar area was also nice if you can't get a reservation.  They actually have a bar island in the middle where you can sit across from your company so it's easier to chit-chat.  \n\nI had the grilled octopus, which I really enjoyed b/c it had a crispy char to it and was soft at the same time.  The star of the night though was definitely the \"gaucho\"...so tender & juicy!  It's $20/person for the dish and the serving is quite small (think 2-3 tiny thick slices per person and a big bone), but still very good!  I also tried the roasted green peppers, calamari, tomato appetizer, and potato side - in general, all the vegetarian dishes weren't as good.  As for drinks, I had some sort of melon, honeydew special that was very light and refreshing - think of something that's a mix between vitamin water and a melon gatorade.  The pitcher of sangria is a pretty good deal (4-6 glasses)...I really liked the fact that they put all the fresh fruit into a brand new cup and then poured the sangria, so I was able to eat the fruit at the end w/o it being all bitter from being soaked in wine for really long.  The goat cheese ice cream with apricot tart was very interesting to try, but I don't think I'd order it again.  \n\nGreat place to go w/ a group of 3-4 so that you get to try a little bit of everything!", "author": "Chinh T."}

The chorizo was just spicy enough to interest us, then came the potatoes, egg and shrimp. The egg was hot and the yolk was perfect and runny. Mixed with the crispy potatoes and shrimp, it was so full of different flavors I wanted to taste more. The meatballs came next - what a surprise. Just the right balance of salty and savory with the mix of lamb,  duck and spices. A little treat before the most impressive meat dish ever. The gaucho rib eye was a sight; enormous, yet appetizing and overwhelming at the same time, It was amazing. Too much meat for us but we really enjoyed the medium rare steak cooked perfectly with a slight char and a fleshy texture that was buttery and tender. The most perfectly cooked meat I've ever had. The veggies were super tasty too. Greens cooked with pinenuts, raisins and garlic. Not too tender, but sauteed with a slight crunch. A nice partner to the meat. The chance for a perfect 5 was missed only for the fact that after waiting a month for a table, we were seated at the bar. It was cool, but would have preferred a table. Maybe next time.

Service, though, is a different story. \n\nWe walked in, and the hostess was charming and accommodating. We were seated in the bar area, and were excited to try Michael Chiarello's San Francisco establishment. Waterfront location with a view of the Bay Bridge and the Bay Bridge Lights for the next two years. Can't go wrong. Our waitress approached us, took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to decide on our tapas choices. We ordered the House-cured chorizo sandwiches, Chicken and English pea croquettes, Whole Monterey calamari on the plancha, and the Warm Pimenton chocolate cake with tamarind crema for dessert. \n\nIt was noticeable there was some confusion with the front of the house. Another party's drinks were brought to us minutes after we received our drinks. Afterward, our chorizo sandwiches walked by us as a food runner approached each group sitting in the bar area asking if they had ordered the sandwiches. We had to politely flag him down and let him know it was our order. Next, our waitress brought us a dish we did not even order while the dishes we did order were 'walking around' the same way our chorizo sandwiches did until our waitress grabbed them. Lastly, we were presented with the wrong bill.\n\nOverall, it was an okay first experience. The food is amazing, although slightly over priced. The bread for the chorizo sandwiches had a nice crunch, and the chorizo itself had great flavor. The croquettes were a little hot at first. But once they cooled, they were tasty. The piece of grapefruit after was a nice finish. The calamari had to be my favorite of the savory dishes we ordered that night. The squid ink aioli and greens on the side balanced the dish nicely. The chocolate cake - I would definitely come back for that. You need to give the kitchen notice as it does say on the menu it takes about 220 minutes to make the dessert. But it's well worth it. The drinks were good - we ordered the Presidio and the Spanish Holiday. Again, you can't go wrong with loving the ambiance and location. But the one downfall this time was the service. I would still come back and try to sit in the main dining area. The food is too good to completely say no to this place. Try it for yourself at least once :)", "author": "Mogi D."}

Both the bar and the dining room (reservations needed for the dining room) have the same fantastic menu. I've been here a handful of times and loved every single thing I've tried. The octopus, the albondigas, all the cocktails and wines- delicious. But the other night we came here and decided to try a bigger dish- the paella- which we assumed would have been absolutely fantastic given the restaurant's theme and our previous experience there. It was mediocre to say the least. The clams were tiny (there were like 5), the prawns were barely seasoned, and the sort of sausage or chorizo they put in there was dry. The rice was poorly cooked and seasoning overall was pretty bland. We've had much better paella on the east coast in non-spanish-themed restaurants, so this was a big disappointment.

Also, I am a server and , in general, don't like to dabble in giving reviews because even a crummy experience holds so many unknowns. For example , you don't know why your food is late but in the kitchen they have a broken stove . I know it sounds silly but all too often a horrible dining experience is often a comedy of errors happening behind the curtain. That being said ill go on. I found out about coqueta from a customer it seemed exciting so we made reservations ( which is a must) . Such an amazing experience! All around wonderful atmosphere , service and the food is heavenly. I wish I could remember our servers name : a young man with a bun in his hair and glasses who was enthusiastic and friendly . He didn't tell us what to choose which he would have If we would have asked but he happily cheered on some of our choices . He was lovely. We are big eaters that enjoy our cocktails so we had many of their gin drinks ( a must) we passed them around the table to try them all. Their wine list is no joke everything for every price range I was impressed by their nickel and nickel Cabernet merlot blend and their duckhorn selection. Ok the food: we ate everything. The octopus and calamari are to die for as well as the razor clams. Ordinarily I wouldn't order these dishes because they are so temperamental and when poorly executed you are eating a leather boot. Not the case all wAs cooked to perfection and a squid ink aioli that I'd punch a family member for. The duck and sausage meatballs are not only a creative mix they were fantastic. We ordered so much more but ill move to the dessert portion. A fig tart with olive oil ice cream was so yummy they are two such delicate flavors that work so well. My personal favorite was the manchego cheesecake. We had dessert along with some port  and sherry. Delightful. This place is fun and exciting the service is great without feeling smothered . Plenty of wine, bubbles, beer ( even a sour ale, amen) , dessert wine and cocktails to die for. Perhaps this isn't the place for your meat and potatoes type although they do have a steak the size of a body builders forearm . I'm sorry for the person who wrote one crappy review about the small portions and price. First off I dare anyone to find inexpensive eats in that area in general and the price is beyond reasonable based on quality alone not to mention atmosphere an area and SERVICE . We love food and aren't afraid to spend on a worthy meal . We had a 400 bill for 5 people who had a few drinks each and most of the menu. Ill call it a steal.

Unfortunately, our experience last night was underwhelming.\n\n1) Service: 2 stars. We had 7:15 reservations and were kept waiting for nearly an hour. We were offered either seats at the counter or in the bar when the delay got to 30 minutes. Usually, we would've taken these options with no problem, but at this restaurant both these options are problematic. The seats at the chef counter were the most uncomfortable wobbly wooden stools. It's an unpadded rectangle of 8x12 inches. I had perched painfully in this seat at the bar while having drinks (my husband abandoned it and stood). It would have been unpleasant to have an entire meal this way. The bar had better chairs at the communal table, but given that it's a semi-open space, was really cold and drafty. So we opted to wait. Once seated, the service was fine and our waitress had great recommendations. But keep in mind that at this restaurant, you don't REALLY have a reservation unless you're willing to go into these sub-optimal overflow areas. That is just their policy.\n\n2) Drinks: 5 stars. The cocktail menu was wonderful. It had a big selection of gin and tonics all made with special flavor tonic. I had the Barca and it was delicious. One can definitely make a habit of this for happy hour! Wine list also nice, with a good selection of reasonably priced Spanish wines.\n\n3) Food: 3 stars. We *SOOO* wanted to love the food here. Unfortunately it was just OK. Between the 2 of us, we had 6 tapas (duck/pork meatball, asparagus torta, octupus, smoked salmon bocadillo, chicken/pea croquet, and fried egg with shrimp in chorizo sauce). Of these, only the egg/shrimp really knocked it out of the park (unbelievably flavorful and well cooked). The rest were fine but nothing special, the kind of thing you could get at just about every neighborhood tapas place in Barcelona, and of average or below average quality. I was especially disappointed in the octopus, since the ones at Bottega was the best I've ever had. But this version was tough and flavorless. Portions were small. We are not big eaters, and you really need at least 3 each to make a meal.\n\nSo, if you've never had tapas in Spain and would like to try it, I would say this is a good choice and I think you will enjoy the food. But if you are familiar with this style of cuisine, the food here is very average, and I think not up to Chirarello's normal high standards. I hope this is just growing pains of a new restaurant, and it improves in the future. And please, buy some proper chairs/stools for the chef's counter!", "author": "Judy D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-17", "description": "I think I'm in love. The boyfriend and I came here for lunch today on a random excursion to San Francisco. We got seated at the chef's table, which I loved because we got to see all of the action going on behind the counter. My first impression was that the overall the decor of the whole place gives the restaurant a nice feel, except those bar stools were pretty rickety and could do to be more sturdy. Onto the food:\n\nThe smoked salmon montadito had some amazing layers of flavor. The uni montadito was delicious as well, with surprisingly delicate flavors and nothing overpowering the other. Melting the lardo over the uni was a great touch. \nWe also ordered the olive oil poached shrimp, which I can say I would be able to eat a whole pound of probably. Not only were the shrimp cooked perfectly, but then you had all that goodness inside the head. The olive oil with black garlic added a nice hint of garlic flavor to the shrimp whilst allowing the natural sweetness of the shrimp to shine through. \nOur favorite dish of the meal was the grilled razor clams. We've never had these clams before but I think we've found our new addiction. My boyfriend was quite literally blown away by this dish, and I mean he swayed backwards in disbelief at how amazing the texture and flavor of this clam was. A few parties around us had ordered this dish as well and we were tempted to steal one from their plates. \n\nOf everything we ordered, there was only one dish that didn't really stand out - the albondigas. It wasn't that the dish wasn't good, it just didn't taste as good as the description. The flavors reminded me a bit of chinese cha shiu pork, but extremely tender and juicy. \n\nMy compliments to the chef for creating such wonderful dishes and definitely props to the kitchen staff for their excellent coordination and composure. It was a pleasure and great entertainment to see everyone working in such great unison in the kitchen and to eat food carefully crafted by them. I can't wait to come back again for my next meal.", "author": "Grace C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-21", "description": "A vibrant, celebratory restaurant that walks a very fine line between being a neighborhood focused, locals place and a special occasion \"destination\" restaurant. Michael Chiarello generally is able to pull this dual requirement off rather well (his Bottega in Yountville is a sterling example) and this somewhat unimpressive-looking joint does the trick. \nThe creators of this restaurant made some very bold decisions with this locale that will either work out nicely or may potentially backfire. Time will tell. \nThe first thing that strikes you is just how small the space is. The Embarcadero has a very spacious, expansive feel to it, but this restaurant feels much more cozy, controlled, focused, and intimate relative to its environs. The entry space is phone-booth tiny and the main dining area is not much bigger--a far cry from the often cavernous tapas bars that predominate in this country. There will be no rollicking, boisterous good cheer at this otherwise sunny-bronzed and energetic space. It is simply too small. Even the greenhouse-like bar area feels a bit cramped and it has a rather hurried, wedding-tent-rental feel to it., even it if it is dazzling in its burnt orange hue (a nod to Bottega).\nAnother decision (and one that adds to the feeling of feeling somewhat constrained) was to not make this a \"view\" restaurant. While it has a very strong sense of place what with requisite skaters and joggers passing by as if on TV, there is a decidedly detached feeling one gets when seated inside. There are windows, but there is a kind of privacy to the interior that seems somewhat jarring. One does not feel a part of the scene of the Embarcadero when dining here. You are indoors and yet feel like you should be outdoors.\nThis may not be a bad thing. First off, the Embarcaero is not a good place for an outdoor cafe (too blustery and, frankly, too much bird poop). Second, view restaurants are famous for distracting you from mediocre food and this place is nothing like a view restaurant. The food is sumptuous, lovingly and expertly prepared, and has hits aplenty. The menu has been carefully crafted with several strong renditions of Spanish classics that anchor the menu, with some truly inspired flavor combinations delivered in a playful, almost whimsical way that allow the diner to get creative.\nThe best view in the house is at the bar itself where the full menu is available. The scene feels more like a farmers market than a cocktail dispensary, what with all of the insanely fresh fruits and vegetables that combine with locally sourced, top-shelf, and artisanal liquors and mixers. This may be the only place on earth to get very intoxicated and feel like you are getting healthier in the process. \nI highly recommend the octopus and anything with shrimp in it. The Sangria is delicious as well. \nI recommend taking your time here. Michael Chiarello's restaurants operate on a different time frame than other restaurants. So many people come to his outposts after going to great lengths to get reservations only to become frustrated if they are not served or waited on immediately. People need to relax and take in the scene like they do in Europe. Watch the highly trained servers do their thing with confidence and unhurried brilliance. Your food will come, my friend. And at just the right time. You have not been forgotten, I assure you. Take time to read the wonderfully detailed wine list, which is clearly a labor of love in its assemblage. There are stories and informative tidbits about the wines of Spain that make you want to order everything on the menu. Shut up and learn something about Sherry or Cava, for example.\nA final note: pay attention to how full you are getting. The portions were a bit bigger than I was expecting after reading some other reviews on here about poor bang for the buck and I got quite full after splitting four tapas with my wife without any mains. A disciplined diner should be able to get out with your belly full for 70 dollars sans booze and about 150 with an extremely solid buzz. Not bad for such a great meal.", "author": "Blue B."}

I'm a HUGE fan of Bottega and was excited to celebrate my birthday dinner last nite at Michael Chiarello's latest venture.\nOn the plus side, our waiter was terrific,...he was expert at his knowledge of the food and drinks.  Ambiance was cozy and we had a wonderful corner booth.\nAnd the drinks were really interesting and delicious.\nAs for the food, the only item that had my table-mates licking their plates was the Monterey Calamari.  We  enjoyed the Chicken & English Pea Croquetas and the Grilled Albondigas, but that was about it.\nOn the \"meh\" side were; Jamon Serano (what's the big deal?), a good yet not amazing Branzino, and pretty common roasted Padron Peppers.\nThe worst item was the Crispy Shrimp Chickpea Flour Pancake.  Not \"meh\"...it was \"feh\"...overcooked and greasy.\nWhile I liked the Manchego Cheesecake pops and Churros, they weren't memorable endings to our meal.\nOne really annoying part of our dining experience was the music.  There was a large speaker over our table and the tunes sounded like something out of an old \"Loveboat\" episode.  C'mon,..how about some Spanish guitar?\nAll in all, a disappointing birthday dinner.

We had a quail egg skewer that was way too savory, a pea salad - same thing - too savory, needed some salt / acid (even though it was so fresh I swear they must have just harvested the ingredients themselves twenty minutes ago). There was one pork dish with herbs that was tasty, but for the price? Not what I'd order again.\n\nThe one REMARKABLE dish was the apple pie with blue cheese ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-05", "description": "True Basque food has been sadly missing from the Bay Area dining scene - until the past year when three spots: Coqueta in San Francisco, Donostia in Los Gatos, and Mundaka in Carmel have (thankfully) opened to introduce some pretty authentic riffs on this under-represented cuisine. \n\nCoqueta is a fun, quality and idealized version of a tapas tavern, and a definite recommendation for anyone interested in testing the waters of Spanish cuisine. Michael Chiarello brought his A-game with this hip, inviting and exciting space that is no way intimidating or pretentious. Bring an appetite, and plan to test drive a lot of different flavors.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a big fan of Chef Chiarello (Bottega every Mother's Day and the owner of all his cookbooks), so it was super exciting to see him working the line the night we visited.The man did not disappoint. He was his usual charming, gracious and oh-so-brilliantly smiling self. He posed for photos, inspected almost every dish exiting his kitchen, personally plated and served an enormous paella to a large party, chatted us up about the new space and even shared plates of a special paella AND offered two complimentary glasses of Syrah from his family's vineyard. The man is an exceptional host - fun and charismatic. I absolutely adore this guy.  \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:15 with Open Table reservations. Here's our experience.\n\nThe space: waterfront with a clear view of the Bay Bridge. The d\u00e9cor: NapaStyle all the way. You can't fault the guy for using the space as an advertisement for his housewares chain - but he pulled it off with style. Vaulted ceilings and huge picture windows let in light and the water view, with the interior decked out in warm, rustic fashion. Hightops perforate the walls, a huge communal table - which probably seats 20 (but I believe can be broken into smaller sections) is stationed in the center of the space, and a open-air kitchen with a wood-fire oven is flanked by a long, marble-topped bar. Chiarello was savvy enough to install a \"pintxos\" display bar, mimicking the way tapas is laid out on bar counters in San Sebastian. There's also an outdoor space that - in the summer / warm days - looks like a great spot for a cocktail and small plate. \n\nThe food. We tried: \n* House-cured boquerones: Fun presentation (in an anchovy can) and bright pop of flavor. Served with lightly dressed greens. Well done. \n* White gazpacho w/ marcona almonds and grapes: Sweeter than what I've experienced in Spain. Interesting concept, but fell a little flat on flavor and more almond-centric than I expected. But will give it another shot. \n* Olive-oil poached asparagus: Beautifully cooked asparagus, but the red wine \"aioli\" was lost on us. Again - interesting concept, but the flavor seems muted. \n* Pan con Tomate: The bread is stellar - like a cross between ciabatta and lavash - is airy and crisply. Traditional pan con tomate is simply tomato rubbed on warm bread, perhaps with olive oil and a sprinkle of sale. Coqueta's version is more like a sofrito on the bread, a mixture of cooked down garlic, onions and tomatoes.  \n* Roasted pardon peppers: Perfectly cooked, but a slightly heavy on the sherry vinegar, which wasn't evenly distributed across the dish.\n* Whole Monterey calamari: Excellent. \n* Grilled razor clams: 100% delightful and we could have ordered them all evening. \n* Wood-grilled octopus: Nicely charred. Good flavor. \n* Grilled albondigas: Nice flavor, slightly mealy texture. \n* \"Tattas\" Bravas: Artistically plated. The bravas salsa was bright and sweet and spicy. \n* Vineyard greens: Hands-down FAVORITE dish of the night. A must try. \n\nDrinks: My partner had a gin and tonic - which must be the unofficial cocktail of Spain. He ordered the Spanish Holiday, which was beautiful and extremely refreshing. Like the razor clams, Coqueta is only a handful of other restaurants in the area (Donostia) that serves authentic Basque cidre (cider) - the Isastegi label. Fresh, dry, a perfect apertif. The wine menu is fair - but I thought the by-the-glass list a little lacking in European style whites and reds. \n\nService: We couldn't take a sip of water without our glasses refilled, the service was so hyper-attentive. Plates were removed quickly, our space repeatedly cleaned up, and we never had to search for a server. Hats off to the staff for being incredibly friendly and observant. \n\nSeriously though, Coqueta has all the qualities of an exciting food-find: hip but in no way intimidating, rustic decor with a modern edge, old school without the kitsch, welcoming without the forged frenzy and a wonderful, fully approachable selection of tapas. \n\nA great date place and a fun, utopian, semi Wine-Country-ized version of a tapas bar. Definitely recommended", "author": "Gigi G."}

They took a while to seat us, but I didn't coordinate the event so I have no idea whose fault that was. Once we got seated, the food was heavenly and the service was extremely attentive. I could tell they were working their tails off to keep us happy. My favorite was the smoked salmon. It had a little something extra in terms of flavor, even more so than most good smoked salmon. The gaucho steak was mouth watering. The cheese was so rich and flavorful. Pickled garbanzo beans in the kale salad. Espinacas was somehow the least exciting thing I tried, and even that was more than passable. I know this is a serious crime, but I was too full and approaching food-coma levels of incoherence to try the paella. But seriously, A+ on the food.

As a fan of Michael Chiarello, this doesn't surprise me one bit. His charm in the kitchen and behind the camera eludes just that, Coqueta. However, in relation to his new Spanish style tapas, it's easy to imagine how this would pertain to his many playful tapas. Having been to Michael Chiarello's Bottega in Yontville several times, this is a step away from his familiar farm to table Italian roots. \n\nAlthough I had planned on visiting Coqueta soon after they opened, I actually ended up walking by during my lunch break. Why not? Since it was in the middle of the day, Michael wasn't there, although one would get a sense of him through the food, open kitchen, and slightly off the norm outside bar area. When you walk through the bar area to go through to the restaurant, you almost feel as if you're being transported from a coastal European bistro, to a secret underground dining club. Not in the literal sense, but once you transport yourself from the bar into the dining area with a small open kitchen, it's as if anything can happen. From the coarse wooded columns to the eccentric wine decanters, it feels like a supper club, anyone would want to immerse themselves into.\n\nI indulged in 4 different tapas. From the cold tapas, I started out with the white gazpacho, and from the hot tapas I chose the crispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake, the wood-grilled octopus, and grilled albondigas made of duck and pork meatballs with a tart cherry and tempranillo pur\u00e9e.  Every dish was served to perfection. It was an art how each plate was presented in a new and unique way.  The anticipation just continued to grow from dish to dish, but the white gazpacho intrigued me the most.\n\nVisually, the white gazpacho with macron almonds, grapes, syrah reduction and syrah-grapeseed oil was almost too pretty to eat. It was beautifully served in glass, filled about half way with the gazpacho, crowned in an array of color. The gazpacho itself was white, like a blank canvas. The presentation was a visually stunning culinary experience. The surface was painted with a splash of colors from the red wine reduction accompanied by carefully placed drops of golden oil. And finally, the center of the gazpacho was strewn with almonds adorned with a delicate, edible yellow flower. The flavor profile was equally enticing. The cold, velvety consistency of the gazpacho itself was delicate and light. The flavor was unique, combining a soft balance between savory and sweet. Hiding at the bottom of the gazpacho were thinly sliced grapes that added a sweet bite that balanced out the marcona profile. To round off the perfect taste, the spoon does all the work as it gently lifts all the flavor profiles into one flawless bite. This is coqueta.", "author": "Holly W."}

The servers were very accommodating, facilitating our moves from the main dining room to the side bar area over to our final destination outside, where we feasted on calamari a la plancha, grilled octopus, arroz cremosa (with scallops) and a side of vineyard greens.  The seafood was all perfectly cooked (I've experienced a lot of gross rubbery octopus in past, but this was anything but), and wonderfully seasoned.  We also tried two of the small bite desserts - cheesecake pops with salted caramel popcorn, and the three pintxos.  Each bite was a creatively scrumptious combo of sweet and salty.  The chocolate covered olives were a particularly interesting dessert.

The service that we have from our main server was that of benign neglect.  On to the food:  My favorite was the razor blade clam, cooked tender-crisp, giving a slight resistance on the initial bite but otherwise very easily chewable and tastily digested.  But at $14 for 3, it is a rather steep taste.  The next dish that I very much enjoyed was the grilled squid, richly flavored, very tender baby mollusks.  We ordered a total of 6 tapas, tried all of the 1-bite skewers, and the apple pie with bleu cheese ice cream.  The one dish that I won't order again is their version of Tortilla Espanola.  Though prettily adorned with edible flowers, it is a totally bland potato pie.  On to service:  Because our main server is so inattentive to us, we have to hail different servers/other staff to order a second round of tapas, check on our drinks, etc. Good thing the others are better at their jobs.  \n\nSo, in summary, we'll probably end up here again in the future.

The food did not disappoint.  \n\nHouse cured ham was delicious (came in 4 pieces.)\nThe plate of olives kept us busy while waiting on our dishes and the green ones were my favorite.\nWhite gazpacho with almond, grape and syrah was not only visually stunning but tasty too, with a wonderful and subtle blend of nuttiness and sweetness.  Definitely something to enjoy at a restaurant and difficult to replicate at home.\nRazor clams were good and not rubbery at all.  My husband thought it was fun to try but didn't seem to care to ever eat it again.\nWe both loved the octopus.  He claimed it was the best octopus he's had.  I wasn't about to draw the same conclusion but fail to come up with a good contender.  The flavor was savory with a hint of spice and the meat was so tender. \nI loved the garlic shrimps.  For $14, you get three (no dishes here come cheap of course).  They were giant, but not over cooked. The blend of spice and olive oil was so perfect.  \nFor dessert, we had the manchego ice cream bite which was really fun, really cute and really tasty (think salted caramel with a cheesecake flavor.)  The churros were good, but didn't beat the ones I had recently at Padrecito.\n\nOther elements of the restaurant like the decor and service were a mixed bag.  I get the rustic look, and the meat and wine bottles stacking up looked very fitting, but the boxes sitting on top of the wine cabinet just makes me think of possible earthquake scenarios. Plus, I don't get the aesthetic appeal of these boxes.  Or the giant printer next to the bathroom. \n\nThe server was cordial and did what she had to do. But the whole time I felt like she didn't want to be there. And she quietly gave us our check without any of us having asked for it or explaining something like \"hey, my shift is over, so here is the check, take your time, blahblahblah.\" And then she never came to pick up the credit card and someone else had to come to get it.  I am usually not that picky about service ---I mean, I know I am not sitting at Gary Danko, but still, plenty of SF restaurants have friendly servers that make you feel like they are happy to see you, or at least they don't hate their jobs.  \n\nAnyway, despite the service, I will definitely come back.

I asked for a bar seat and was told to wait for a spot....apparently all the indoor bar seat, while empty were reserved as with all the empty tables. I was asked to stand in the outside bar area to wait while people were enjoying themselves and servers were bustling along. There was no room and I felt pretty weird standing there. It seemed the hosts really did not know how to handle people waiting? They were polite and all, it was just awkward... I felt like I was at a party I wasn't invited to.

Meatballs were interesting, but otherwise the stuff that was great, they didn't make, like the chorizo or the cheese. That's not the only reason for a lowered rating. I made a reservation for two,  weeks in advance and had never been there before. Nothing on open table indicated that I had to say no I can't sit on a barstool that is 3 1/2 inches in depth, with no back. We arrived, excited as I love his other restaurant in Yountville. The hostess took us to the bar with the seats I described and never moved asked, is it okay to seat you at the bar. We get there and my guest knew I have a back condition and couldn't sit on seats they showed us to, and frankly, neither could she as they were quite uncomfortable. I immediately told the hostess who shrugged it off as whatever- it's all they had, not even a bs I'm sorry. I pointed out another area, an actual table for two and said, I have an injury, may I sit there. She said no it's for others arriving later. I always bring pillows with me to make it more comfortable and can usually make do, but not with the bar they offered us. The hostess said no that's for another but you can wait. Wait at 9:10 for a table, after making a reservation  weeks back and only 9 pm on a Sunday was available? My guest had the idea, could we start there and move over to other location when it became available. She reluctantly said okay. Then she came back about 10 minutes later and said you're in luck, you can move  to the table you pointed to earlier. I said, great because I'm in so much pain here. She never said she was sorry, and instead, blocked my ability to get up while she retrieved our glassware, which they swapped out at the new table. Then as I'm trying to get off  the stools and out of the area, a busboy cuts me off almost knocking me over.  So I let him pass, and then I tried again and he did it again!  I told this hostess that I was shocked they placed us at the bar without asking, and her snarky response 3 times was that open table tells me we may be seated together. I assume she meant with others. But as I told her- how does that tell a patron that they could be seated at a bar and that if they can't sit on a 3 1/2 inch seat that is heighten and ungodly uncomfortable with no back? She just kept hostilely repeating open table says you may be seated together and that I should have told them in open table.  I take issue with placing the burden on someone with a disability to know your restaurants layout. In my opinion that's a violation of the ADA and Unruh Acr.\nThey placed us at the other table and then every time someone passed by our table they kicked my chair hard.  (The whole night!)  I want to believe the latter stuff wasn't intentional, but no one said I'm sorry or excuse me, even the server who said he knew of back problems.  It's sad because the tables are so on top of each other and with it being tapas, the staff makes 4-6 more time the trips to each table then they would for a regular meal so, they are constantly (I assume unless their bumps and kicks to me were intentional) hitting folks' chairs. I won't go back.   I did say something to the other hostess who told me the first gal was young, as if to suggest manners cannot be trained. I won't be back.

The space is very open - he did a good job with the aesthetics of it. We sat at a \"family\" style table with another couple, but most tables looked like two-tops. I also think the bar seating was by reservation, which I would make sure to say I didn't want when making a reso (just better to have a table with backs on our chairs). I think the outside area is first come/first serve, but I didn't ask. Ok, now on to the food. We really enjoyed each of our dishes and would definitely return, but we aren't in any hurry. I think it would be a great place for apps & drinks after work though, so maybe I'll try it out sooner than I think. The two of us spent $100 and left full, so that's great:) Everything was bite size, so keep that in mind...\n\n- Chicken & English Pea Croquettes, 3 of them to an order. So yummy, seriously a melt-in-your-mouth chicken pot pie!\n- Tattas Bravas - little friend tater tots, with melt-in-your-mouth mash potatoes inside (maybe 7 to an order). Great little dipping sauce too.\n- Wood-grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes, pimenton, olive oil. The grill flavor really made this dish.\n- Pork and duck albondigas with dried cherry and tempranillo, 3 of them to an order. These were sweet, and a little crunchy with fried onions on top. Was Canada's favorite.\n- Arroz Cremosa with Slow Cooked Bomba Rice, Day Boat Scallops and squash with squash blossoms. I really liked the squash and scallops, but otherwise was probably our least favorite dish (and was our \"main\"). Just tasted quite fishy to me (others around us ordered the paella, which looked bomb).\n- Manchego Cheesecake bits w/ Caramel Corn, 2 to an order - these were just so yummy, and I never order cheesecake. The people next to us ordered them, so I had too...\n- Molten chocolate cake. This again was good, interesting flavors with the tamarindo spices, but I preferred the cheesecake bites.\n\nOverall I would recommend it bc it's the new hot restaurant and I am glad we hit it up.", "author": "Jenn D."}

The bar was full of people. He asked if we were having dinner and I said that two people would have full dinner and two people would have drinks and appetizers. HE said I should sit at the bar and I explained that I have a sleeping baby and I need a table as I don't have a stroller, he said he didn't have a table for THAT. I left and will never return.

They gave us the table with the comment that someone else deserved the table after having made a reservation over a month ago.  Trying to guilt us out of the table I guess.  Let the games begin.  Clearly, they intended to serve us and get us off the table as soon as possible.  Our cheese plate came with a few crackers, and then they brought the entree, paella, within 15 minutes, before bringing our next tapa.  All our food within 20 minutes, in a tapas restaurant, and on a tiny table.  We asked for more crackers, and when the bill came, they charged $6.00 for five or six extra crackers.  The paella was burned, seemed to be reheated, and had four mushy shrimp, and Serrano ham that was overcooked, and as tough as jerky, with an abundance of overcooked rice.  The waiter was patronizing, and told us their orders were to keep things moving.  Shame on you Michael.

Coqueta had great reviews online so we decided to give it a shot. First, the ambiance is wonderful. It's a really cool atmosphere and reminiscent of some of the tapas joints in Spain. Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow, which I didn't mind too much given I was prepared to spend a good deal of time there and enjoy the atmosphere. However, after 15 minutes spent waiting for something to drink, it became frustrating and not enjoyable. Now, on to the food. Food was decent but horribly over priced for the portion sizes. Yes, I understand they are tapas, but what you get for the money is way less than what you get at tapas restaurants in other cities (I haven't been to any other tapas places in SF, solely comparing to NY, Philadelphia, and Chicago). Also, in my opinion none of the food had any flavor, it was all very bland. The manchego was delicious. My recommendation would be to come for 1 drink (wine seemed to be a good deal - 1 glass was a big portion) and 1 tapa per person as an appetizer and enjoy the ambiance then head out and get your dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Katie K."}

I went with a friend I haven't seen for years, and my husband. We were there on a Friday night. Joe Cleveland was behind the bar, Michael Chiarello was in the kitchen and roaming the floor. Joe and his bar staff really provided wonderful service and I would go back in a heartbeat. I'm sure the restaurant proper is great, but if Joe was behind the bar (and probably even if he wasn't), I'd still choose to sit in the bar. \n\nThe Drinks\nI started the night not drinking... so I had a \"J&T\" - juniper and tonic. It's amazing. The best non-alcoholic cocktails I've ever had. Things moved on from there and we ended up trying quite a few of the alcoholic cocktails. Not surprisingly I can't remember their names nearly as well, but they were inventive and fresh without being pretentious or silly, and were a joy to experience. \n\nThe Food\nWe weren't that hungry so ordered only tasting bites, though you can order from the full menu at the bar during meal service times. My only gripe was that the small skewers that cost $2.50 each, are really small. Like, tiny. Truly it's a half a bite of food. Other than that, the food that we did have was great (Patatas Bravas and beet salad). The Patatas Bravas were amazing. Smokey and crisp. \n\nService\nTruly wonderful. Even though we were sitting at the bar on a Friday night, and not spending a particularly huge amount of cash, we were never once rushed out, or made to feel like perhaps we should move on. Service was unobtrusive when we were obviously engaged in conversation, and chatty when we weren't. We actually had to ask for our bill at the end of the night, and they let us sit there and chat and catch up for as long as we wanted. Which was a long time, as we were the last to leave and closed up the bar with the staff. \n\nGo here. Take a friend. You'll love it.", "author": "Samantha W."}

For some reason A is terribly unimpressed with the Slanted Door - my first suggestion - so instead we agreed on Coqueta.  A was ecstatic to add to her treasure trove of open table points ....  Sometimes I let A get away with too much but that story is for another day.  The space is near Pier 5 and has an open airy feel both indoors and on the deck.  It struck me as a sophisticated girls night out type of a establishment with craft cocktails - wine and sangria offerings - as well as tapas to share.  The name meaning flirt in Spanish is appropriate.  We were seated at a communal table with a group of 40 something ladies enjoying cocktails and small bites.  We started with a gin and tonic.  The presentation and balance were the most impressive I have seen to date.  There are several pictures of the cocktails in other reviews - simply magical.  Having lived in Spain for some time I was excited to try the food.  All of the Pintxos were wonderful - my favorites being the Chorizo and Tortilla de Espinacas.  I also enjoyed the duck and pork meatballs to a lesser degree.  The prawn dishes were my least favorite due to texture and consistency.  While I could not help but look into A's eyes for most of our time at Coqueta - it is a great place to people watch with an exceptional gin and tonic.", "author": "Andrew L."}

Sometimes a dish comes out too oily and the next time it is perfect, so that is why I rated it four stars. But when it is perfect, it is very very good! The Chef's selection of cured meats is a wonderful appetizer, especially with friends around the table. We order lots of dishes - mostly tapas- and then happily dive in. Some of our favorites:\n\nMy all-time favorite - and it is always perfect - the sliced pork loin with the honey-chilli drizzle sauce. Incredible and I am not usually a pork fan! Fabulous. You MUST order this dish.\nThe octopus - so fresh it practically walks up the dock and throws itself on your plate, all dressed in wonderful.\nThe manchego skewers - divine, and interesting.\nThe calamari with squid ink and yummy onion jam.\nThe duck and pork meatballs - more wonderful. Very tasty.\n\nThe ambience couldn't be better, lovelier or more interesting. The bay views are exceptional and you're right on the water, almost like a stable boat. The decor is all about texture and textural contrasts: glossy glass with nubby sack cloth. Polished and hammered metals, chunky woods and steel. If you just want a great bar, this is separate from the restaurant but accessed through the same glass vestibule and hostess. It is a small bar, and instantly crowded when they open.

This is place is way too pricey, ridiculously high on concept and pretension and disappointingly low on execution.   The flavor combinations and palette are meh at best.  In a city known for its stunning cuisine, this place has no place.  If you are dropping the duckets on fine cuisine in San Francisco, put them on real cuisine, not the essence of foam of cuisine.  \n\nOn a rare sunny SF day I was drawn to the new glass box on the Embarcadero.  My friends and I stopped into the lounge.  We had speciality cocktails and our \"tapas\" consisted of what were passed off as skewers, but were really toothpicks with half a quarter sized pieces of salami, some mediocre patatas bravas, and forgettable shrimp dish with somewhat mealy shrimp.  The point of tapas, especially at the size they serve them, is exquisite ingredients or fresh and superb flavors.  These tapas deliver none of that.  Plus the sangria tastes like wine water, the tequila cocktail with egg is just a bad idea, and the mojito is more than disappointing with its essence of mint with no actual mint.  \n\nSkip it people, that good money could be well spent on seriously fantastic food.

We sat at the bar and he was working right there. A gracious and enthusiastic guy, that's for sure. He made some suggestions and we loved every one: had the tortilla Andres, Delta asparagus (my goodness), tattas bravas, roasted Padron peppers, wood-grilled octopus (super), grilled albondigas (meatballs), ribeye bocadillo (sandwich and yum), and sopa de ajo (which Mr. Chiarello insisted needed to be eaten with a splash of hard cider, and he then provided it. Wonderful).  Each dish was memorable. Service was fine. \n\nCame back for a birthday celebration. Couldn't get the time we wanted, but I was desperate to try everything else on the menu! So we ate dinner on a Sunday at 5:30. Had a lovely, comfortable booth in the corner. Great, I mean great, service. Again, the meal was memorable. Our bill was sky-high, but that might have been because I asked the server to bring us everything on the small-plates menu...This is what we had and what we loved:\n\nEl Gran Plat Cap, a plate of cured meats and cheeses, some pan de cristal bread with a tomato spread, almonds, quince gel, oh it was very nice. Served four of us nicely, too.\nGrilled razor clams. Perhaps our only disappointment. Somewhat bland.\nSome pintxos. Everyone tried something different. Nice idea. One member of our party thought the quails egg Diablo was to die for.\nHouse-cured white anchovies, some loved them, some though they were a bit too pickled.\nClam and mussel escabeche, another pickled item, served with a shaved fennel salad. We fought over this one.\nTattas Bravas, a soft tater tot, but on a whole different level. Love this one, too.\nChicken and English pea croquetas. Think the best chicken pot pie you will ever taste.\nSunny side-up egg with shrimp, crispy potato strings and chorizo dressing. OMG, this looked somewhat pathetic when served, but our waiter mixed it up for us and it has to be the best tapa I've ever had anywhere. Don't miss this one.\nCrispy shrimp and chickpea flour pancake. Wait. Maybe this is the best tapa I've ever had.\nWood-grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes. Another one to fight over. The octopus was meaty, tender and had just enough wood fire on it. \nGrilled albondigas, these duck and pork meatballs were wonderful.\nWhole grilled branzino. Everyone enjoyed this one, juicy, done just right -- it was somewhat small, which didn't matter to us since we were just interested in tasting it, but I think it might have disappointed if this was the only entree someone ordered.\nAt this point we had to cry \"uncle\" and tell our server to stop!\n\nWe had sangria and a couple of bottles of a well-priced Tempranillo, too.\n\nWe also had two desserts, but no one remembers what they were because the four of us finished off all that sangria and wine.\n\nThinking about our meal, I'm hopping on Open Table right now to get back for another meal as soon as possible. I can't wait to try the paella, which smelled so good passing by I almost went over to ask the party if I could, please, have just one spoon of it.", "author": "Diane K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-25", "description": "I was excited to see how the space of the former Lafitte was transformed into Coqueta, and get a taste of how Chef Chiarello interprets Spanish tapas.  I've never been to Spain, and I can't say I have much experience dining in Spanish resturants beyond Jose Andres' Jaelo.  I've eaten at Bottega numerous times and have a fondness for Chef Chiarello's ability to cook great food and with his celebrity status from being on TV its always refreshing to see him on the line in his restaurants plating, cooking and doing service tasks while posing for photos and talking with googly eyed patrons.  \n\nLast night was no exception. From the moment I was seated at the bar in front of the open kitchen, I was close witness to Chef Chiarello's charm and care he puts into his restaurants and his food.  Starting off with a glass of wine and some cheese, I made a few plate choices based on my likes and the cost.  I was trying to try a number of plates without breaking the bank.  I ordered the squid with onion jam and the octopus plates.  The freshness of the plates were great, but I feel like they could have been a little more seasoned to pop.  So since I was seated all night on the other side of the bar from Chef Chiarello, I decided, why not ask the Chef himself what he suggests, which made his eyes light up and he began throwing suggestions at me.  I went with his suggestion and my gut but getting the egg and shrimp dish, which was topped with peppers and fried onions.  I could have had that dish over and over all night.  Well seasoned, spicy peppers and great egg made for a wonderful dish.  \n\nNext I tried a little cold dish of Iberico ham and sea urchin uni on a toasted mini-bagel.  That was quite good.  There were a number of little toothpick items passed my way, which started elevating the evening past my first two dishes. I noticed on the menu that the items that were very good were also listed under \"What the Chef is eating\", so for those looking to try Coqueta and get the best of it, I suggest going with those.\n\nOverall, the space is still very much like Lafitte, but  with a number of color and style touches that makes the space more homey.  Chef Chiarello was very charming and open to chatting with his patrons, me being one of them, which made for a great look into his love of his craft.  Its also great watching him run his kitchen while chatting it up, cause on a number of occasions he had me thinking he had eyes in the back of his head with his quick turns to correct plates leaving the pass and getting his wait staff to get the items from the pass before they died without missing a beat of the conversation he was having.\n\nWait staff was great, attentive and friendly.\n\nI'm expecting that they have numerous wrinkles to iron out of the restaurant, and so far its off to a great start.", "author": "Andrew H."}

It's a busy place.  No issue there.  That's par for the course with trendy SF spots.  I waited almost 40 minutes for someone to get up from the bar.  (I was by myself). Again, not their issue.

It took 25-30 minutes just to get our first food item, and 5 more minutes to get our drinks. Our server apologized, but clearly no effort was made to remedy the situation because we ordered about 5 tapas and 3 drinks and we were there for 2 hours. We would have ordered more, and dessert, if they actually paid any attention to us. They weren't even that busy for a Sat. night; the table next to us was empty for half the time we were seated there.

Once we were seated, we had a number of great small plates, including Brussels sprouts, the cheese plate, octopus,  the seafood fantasia and the paella.

My husband and I have been to Bottega in Napa (another one of Michael Chiarello's restaurants), but I must say, I enjoyed the food here better, maybe because my palate is used to more Spanish style food than Italian dishes. My husband got their Magnolia IPA to start. We then ordered some tapas (Fantasia de Fidua and Coquetas de Pollo) and they were both very good. We sampled some Pintxos or skewers and they were all good as well! We also ordered their Paella wth alioli and we were more than satisfied. It says that it serves 2 to 3 people I think, but it was enough for me and my husband since we finished everything! The only thing I noticed was that the chorizo was a little bit on the hard side (looks like we got the skin or outer part of the chorizo) but it was good as well. I noticed because I had just gotten braces and it was actually difficult to bite at first. Maybe my teeth are just sensitive. For dessert, we sampled the Manchego Cheesecake paired with some caramel popcorn and it as sooo good that I wanted more! We definitely had a very wonderful experience, the staff and even some chef's by the chef's table (where we sat) were very attentive and cordial (and it is a very busy place too). I also couldn't believe we were able to make a reservation the day before Valentine's Day and get seated right away. The parking was street parking but we didn't have problems as well (maybe because our reservation was a little later during the night). The prices aren't bad at all. We will definitely come back to try their other dishes.", "author": "Cindy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-30", "description": "I went to Coqueta for my 24th birthday dinner with 4 girlfriends; reservations can be made up to a month in advance and reservations of more than 3 people automatically are placed at a table, as opposed to the bar.  \n\nSo I called a month in advance, and the guy who took down my reservation completely butchered it.  First of all, I called when it opened for lunch exactly a month before the day I wanted to dine, but was told it was only possible for me to make a reservation at 5:00 PM or much later in the evening, since most tables stay occupied between 6:00 and 8:00 PM...  Okay, 5:00 PM was fine with me.  Then it seemed like he completely butchered my phone number, name, and number of guests.  (It really bothered me, so I called the next day to reconfirm and to make sure everything was correct, which it wasn't; thankfully, the woman who answered this time was MUCH more helpful.  After she finally figured out which reservation was actually mine...)  Unfortunately, this experience made me apprehensive.\n\nFortunately, when we arrived at the pier, we were quickly taken to our table, which was right next to the kitchen.  For the meal we tried:\n\n- Pintxos: The quail egg was my favorite; I probably could have sat there the entire night just eating those.  The combinations were definitely spot on.\n- Patatas bravas: Such a simple dish, yet SOO DELICIOUS!  The garlic aioli that came with it was UHHHMAZING.\n- Gambas al negro: I thought they were perfectly cooked and super juicy.  My girlfriends let me have all the shrimp heads, so that was a bonus for me!\n- Monterey calamari: Pretty good, but I'm a huge fan of squid and felt like I've had better.\n- Octopus: SO UNEXPECTEDLY TENDER!  We loved it, the flavoring was on point too.\n- Duck and pork meatballs: We all thought it was interesting...; definitely did not expect it to be sweet, so I guess that threw us off.  Probably wouldn't order it again.\n- Paella: SOOO, I had expectations for the paella, and it did not reach my expectations.  There was nothing outstanding about it.  We shared 1 order of the paella between 5 people and that was enough.\n- Churros: DELISH. The raspberry dusting was a great combination.\n\nOur waitress also was very informative and was accommodating in adjusting each dish so that each of us had at least one serving of everything.  We really wanted to try to uni open-faced sandwich, but was told they weren't able to acquire any uni for that day.  The drinks were also great; definitely stand out and interesting.\n\nBUT THE SERVICE. The service started off really well.  Our waitress was attentive, but a quarter through our meal, she stopped serving us without explanation even though she was still serving other tables, and we got another server, who checked in very little.  It seems once we placed our orders they were just waiting for us to finish.  For the price of the meal, the service was definitely not on par and not what I expected.\n\nIn conclusion, it was definitely a must on my list of restaurants to try in San Francisco.  Not a fan of the price tag of each plate for the amount of food you are getting and the service, but the dishes were delicious and I could tell each component of each dish was well thought out.  I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but the flavor combinations were on point and I'm a sucker for tapas, so 4 stars.", "author": "Becca T."}

The restaurant is rustic inside and reminded me of a lodge or cabin feel. It is in a great location with gorgeous views of the water. My husband and I had a 9:30PM reservation on a Monday night in July. The restaurant was packed as if it was a Saturday evening in DC (I found this the case at both dinners we went to in San Francisco during the week). We sat at the chef's counter and to begin, we ordered the El Grand Plat Cap (chef's selection of cured meats and cheeses). It never showed up at our table. When I finally asked the waitress she basically said she forgot and then I said forget it. We tried a few other dishes and our favorite was the Sunny Side Up Huevo. We also enjoyed the kale salad with grilled strawberries. The other dishes were just ok, not good enough to mention. For dessert we had the manchego cheesecake pops. They were fantastic; especially for someone like me who doesn't love dessert. The waitress took the dessert off our bill to apologize for the lapse in our first order.

We told hostesses we had to be gone in under 2 hrs when we checked in with them and went back to them a few times to ask how much longer the table would be. We kept being told \" the people on your table are paying  \".  Now I do understand that tables can get backed up, and although I was not pleased with the delay they could have redeemed themselves somewhat by buying us a drink ( we bought our own ), or even by sending us over an appetizer to tide us over. Any gesture to let us know they felt badly and realized we were still there waiting. The cost to the restaurant would be a few dollars and they could have won us back. Instead I feel compelled to tell you that by the time we got any food we had been there over an hour, and for this reason I will not be going back. Food was good, but there are too many other restaurants in SF that have good food AND are professional enough to know how to turn a negative situation into a positive one.", "author": "Dusty J."}

Luckily for me, I read about it on a flight from Detroit to Phoenix. I was on my way to meet up with my French relatives for a grueling \"vacation\" from Phoenix to San Francisco, visiting all national parks in between and spending 6+ hours per day in the car. As a Food Network fan and foodie, Coqueta was my light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nCoqueta was a fantastic experience. Despite the fact that my online reservations hadn't gone through-Bryce Canyon is not reliable for internet service-the staff were able to accomodate the nine of us, including three children, at the last minute.\n\nOur server and service were impeccable. Despite the fact that only my boyfriend and I spoke English, they managed to make the whole table feel welcome. As an added bonus, Chef Chiarello was there. He signed menus for us, took a picture with us and even demonstrated making the strawberry rhubarb dessert for the kids. Excellent!\n\nAnd then there's the food. Given that there were nine of us, we ordered practically everything on the menu and it was fantastic. The only thing that we weren't crazy about were the razor clams. Having never had them before, I can't say if they were good or bad, only that I didn't care for them.\n\nIf you find yourself in San Francisco, be sure to eat here. It is well worth the trip.", "author": "Leslie S."}

When we arrived (just before the reservation) the host ignored us then brushed us off.  So there we are trying to find somewhere to stand while waiting for our friends and table, getting shoulder butted by one busser, then another, and forcefully told to clear a path so he could set a \"reserved\" bar table.\nOnce seated, the actual service was great: attentive, informed and gracious, though half our party froze since our table was directly adjacent to the door which they kept open all evening.  \nThe food was interesting and mostly delicious but overly salted across the board.\nCrispy shrimp pancake was great but derivative of many similar apps around town (think thai shrimp corn cake).\nI will say the gazpacho was maybe the best I've had and not at all ordinary.\nVery good paella.  Wonderful cheesecake pops with caramel corn desert.\nIn the end, it is a concrete space in a pier.

I made a reservation a month in advance. We were running a bit late, and called to let them know. We were under the impression that they would hold our table for us. By the time we arrived, we were greeted by a host who coldly told us that they had to give our table away, however, another table would be made available very soon. We wandered over to the bar to wait  for our table and browsed through the cocktail menu. A server rushed over to the bar to grab his drink orders, but dropped his tray, spraying beer all over my legs. He didnt acknowledge me until he saw me trying to find something to wipe my legs clean. He then offered to grab a towel, but never fulfilled his promise. I periodically checked in with the host, but was constantly brushed off. Finally, our table was ready, but it took awhile for our server to greet us. After taking down our order, food and drinks arrived quickly. Overall, food was creative, but did not impress me enough to justify the high price of each dish. Service was disappointing, perhaps I came on an off night, but I wont be back to give it another shot any time soon.", "author": "Kellie C."}

I can't imagine why anyone would choose this one.\n\nThe place has more of a club than a restaurant vibe.  Like so many other reviewers for this restaurant, we waited in the packed bar 20+ minutes after arriving a couple minutes after our reservation-time.  We were then escorted to the bar in the restaurant. by someone who looked more like he should be standing at a velvet rope than working in a restaurant.  While waiting we saw some other couples  who arrived later directly seated.\n\nMaybe it was just my mood at the time, but the restaurant also also didn't seem to be that enjoyable a place.  It felt to be a lot of tourists and people who didn't look all that happy.. It's not just the crowd.  Park Tavern for example is crowded and fun.\n\nThe food I guess is OK, but the food's OK in lots of places where spending a couple hours is much more pleasant.\n\nI guess this place is doing well right now, but you can add me to the list of people who will never return and hope it's someday replaced with a place that treats its diners better.", "author": "Michael E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-25", "description": "BEWARE.\n\nCouple of disclaimers (which will make sense as you read further into the review- if you choose to):\n1.  This restaurant was undoubtedly one of the worst I've ever experienced. So much so that it converted me from a simple lurker to reviewer status on Yelp (this is my first review).\n2. I am black\n3. I have had better service in Bulgaria where people were neither used to seeing black people nor too eager to serve them.\n\nSo my friend and I made reservations for an 8:30 dinner on a Wednesday. Nice, right? Figured it'd be relaxed enough as it's not too close to the weekend. We made it at about 8:33, checked in by the front little area, and were told wait a bit for a table. We asked if we could grab drinks by the bar and proceeded to the bar area. My friend attempted to order our drinks, was ignored, and we figured, hey, they're probably busy and don't want to be bothered by two people who don't have a table or a tab yet. That's OK. We settled for water, grabbed a glass, and continued to wait. Our hostess relayed that we had the option of two counter seats or a table. We opted for the counter and sat down to look at the menus. I would guess that it is about 9 pm at that point. We were served water and begin patiently waiting for our server. We keep looking around, smiling, and politely nodding and gesturing for servers to come over. No one came for about 15 minutes. At that point, my friend motioned over to the center kitchen staff and asked if someone could call a server over to take our orders- it made sense, we were seated right there anyway. I could tell they weren't too happy about being disrupted but they called over a server for us. \nAbout 10 minutes later, someone arrives. We order a glass of white wine and mineral water. He does a speedy walk through of a dish we asked for information about and vanishes. Fast forward to 20 minutes later, we are still patiently waiting, but were not even served our drinks. We both keep looking around, seeing if our server is maybe close by. At this point, I start getting a bit annoyed and details that weren't as noticeable become apparent. I notice that we are the only people of color visible in the dining area, I notice that folks next to us (left and right) are being served drinks, food, are being asked questions and talked to. I try to shrug it off, engage in some lively chatter but I can't help but feel annoyed, peeved, uncomfortable, and insulted. So I ask the center kitchen staff AGAIN (third polite attempt), if we could get our beverages and if someone, could take our order. Right at this point, the Chef  (Michael) decides to come out and we engage in a short chit chat about the restaurant. We thought this was a good sign that someone may actually notice we needed service. He leaves, no one else comes for about another 15-20 minutes and it's about 10 pm- more than an hour into our arrival.\nNo drinks, no food, and no one to take our food order.\nAt this point, the general manager or maitre d comes over, asks about what\nwe ordered and takes our order AGAIN.  We re-ordered our wine for the millionth\ntime and proceeded to wait. It took another 15-20 minutes before I decided that I really did not want to dine in a place that seemed to take pleasure in deliberately ignoring us. I use the word ignore because nothing else describes having this targeted experience while everyone else is being attended to. And please spare me the \"what if it wasn't what you think it is? what if it was just busy?\". Unless you've had the pleasure (read sarcasm) of deliberately being ignored, followed, watched, or any of that in a place where you just want to pay to get services, you do not know how any of this feels. At that point, we got up proceeded to the front waiting area, offered to pay for the glass of wine, and relayed that we would no longer be dining there. Even then, they simply brushed us off, did not ask what was wrong, did not offer any apologies, nothing whatsoever. It was almost as if they were pleased to not be dealing with us anymore. So clearly I am upset, insulted, angry, and more than that, just horribly disappointed. I did a quick scan of social media reviews which all shed light on the sub-par service people have come to expect however, it is a much different feel when no one around us seemed to be having the challenges we were experiencing.\n\nDespite the hype and grandeur that surrounds the dining experience at Coqueta, the minimum acceptable treatment is courteous, respectful, and timely. And to be quite honest, there's no need to dance around the issue but yesterday's experience, was one that fell into a specific category that begs the question: are certain groups of people not welcome at this establishment? Because the palpable feeling is that, no, some people are not welcomed and will be treated differently. I'd be curious to know if other folks of color have experienced the same or if this is just \"business as usual\".\n\nWouldn't go if you paid me.", "author": "Moget G."}

We're not big dessert people but we followed the server's recommendations to try some of the \"bite-size\" desserts, including a chocolate and olive oil ice cream sandwich and a manchego cheese cake served with popcorn. Both were heavenly and not too sweet or heavy.  \n\nCoqueta did not serve its paella option that night so we'll have to come back.  Just a lovely evening overall, with a beautiful view of the Bay.

A group of five of us came on a Sunday night. The place was active but not packed. We were seated and orders taken but it was clear pretty early our waitress had little to no sense of humor or real interest in our table. I started with their red sangria. I love sangria and did enjoy their's but you must LOVE cinnamon as it had a ton. We then split about 10 dishes including the paella, which the waitress hyped when we first arrived. I'd say 2 dishes were very good, 6 were just okay including the paella (basic flavors, undercooked shrimp) and 2 were just plain bad. My favorite was their meatball tapas. That was delicious. They were out of half their desserts so we skipped that final touch. The oddest and most upsetting part I must say was the service. The waitress was quite absent. They were very focused with removing dishes but when does a waitress remove an empty drink glass and not ask if you'd like another. I had to practically hunt her down to order a 2nd sangria. My friend wanted some advice on wine and she seemed totally clueless yet didn't bother to go find someone who might know better.

The traditional cocktail art has returned in force in San Francisco, London, New York and many other places. I particularly enjoy the old fashioned recipes, but it's the new twists that take the palette to far away places. Last night I had one that was particularly wonderful and timely for the season. There was roasted pumpkin, white chocolate and many other delights with cava and gin. It is an unbelievable place. If you enjoy Spanish tapas, then you have to try this place. If you have been to Spain, and dream of a return, then you need to visit Coqueta. For now, it's our little Spanish gem on the bay.", "author": "Darin A."}

And it was bite-sized\n\nThe fates were kind to me when I lucked into a reservation for Sunday night at Coqueta. My anticipation was at effervescing level by the time Sunday rolled around. I'd walked by the place twice, peering into to catch a glimpse of something. \n\nI'm so excited, that I make my dining partner arrive 15 minutes early for our 9:15 reservation. Oh, those sweet fates; our table had just been set up. Only when they led us through from the bar, did I realize that actual restaurant was larger than just the space I'd been trying to see. I had been looking just the bar side. The bigger space takes up the former LaFitte space. And it's gorgeous.\n\nNow, believe me, I'm not a gusher. I'm usually not  impressed by celebrity. (There is a point to this). I'm sitting perusing the menu thinking \"It would be kind of great if Michael Chiarello was actually here tonight. But it's late and Sunday...I doubt it\". The words are still hanging in my bourbon-infused airspace when a hand is thrust into my menu's general area. \"Good evening and welcome.\" It is Chef Chiarello personally thanking me and my dinner guest for coming tonight. I regale him of my anticipation and ask what he suggests. He patiently and graciously reviews a number of items he suggests, including the Tatta tots \"They are a pain in the ass to make, but they're delicious\". It is only after he has left the table, that my guest leans in and says \"you just peed a little, didn't you?\". I am loathe to admit, I did. He also communicates that I have asked the chef what he recommends while the menu CLEARLY says \"Here's what the chef recommends\".  Tourist.\n\nAfter our incredibly lovely server brings us a bottle of Spanish rose, we begin to think about tucking in. The Chef had recommended the iberico pork, so that was already settled, but we reviewed the list of his recommendations. Here's how they played out: \n\n* Asparagus with sangria hollandaise: Mother of Pearl, this was good. I know what you're thinking. Sangria? Hollandaise? Believe me. It works. The hollandaise is light, fluffy and so balanced. It's not sweet, but has the perfect note of red wine. \n* Tattas Brava: Fancy schmancy tater tots. Creamy, crispy with some aioli. Fantastic\n* Chicken/Spring pea croquetas: Gorgeous, crispy. Like a chicken pot pie in finger-food form. \n* Crispy egg over shrimp and polenta with chorizo sauce: hands down my favorite. A perfect sunny-side up egg, shrimp and spicy chorizo. This could possibly the last meal I ask for. \n* Grilled iberico pork: Just typing this makes my mouth water. Simply put, this is one of the best things I've ever tasted. Apparently, these porcine pals are fed a diet of acorns, making them taste like nothing I've tasted; the perfect grilling didn't hurt, either! \n\nService was without a flaw. Attentive, yet non-intrusive; always knowledgeable. I get the distinct impression that people actually like working there. Everyone seems relaxed and really enthused over what they're doing. \n\nMy bill came and I actually thought it was a mistake. No, hold on. In a  good way. It was far less than I had anticipated and, in my humble opinion, worth every single cent.", "author": "Patrick R."}

We started out with Wood-grilled octopus that was so great I ordered another and while we were waiting, the bartender apparently had some extra time to devote to us and started a free 'wine tasting' for us of some obscure but wonderful Spanish wines. This extra attention (and wine) started us off on a very long and wonderful lunch of several dishes - all fantastic. So the food, coupled with the wonderful wine and the amazing service by the bartender made this repast worthy of five stars. However, as the noon hour approached, the place became a zoo; loud, cramped and hectic. That would be my only complaint.

This is an incredible remake of the Lafitte space on Embarcadero with decor that does justice to the menu. The staff accommodated a late reservation for 10 at lunch (the boss wanted to take our group out) and we arrived at 11:30. The waitstaff was very helpful in getting us settled in with the appropriate drinks and suggesting many great food options. They had suggested 2 or 3 tapas per guest on top of a main dish, but we basically did one each with a couple of paella (vegetarian and regular) and the whole grilled branzino (from the dinner menu, but they did it for us at lunch on request). The tapas were shared and we had several - each was unique. Olive oil-poached prawns, Monterey calamari with squid ink aoili, fried shrmp cakes, poached asparagus with Idiazabal cheese and jamon Serrano, they just kept coming. There was hesitation on the paella (vegetarian), but the server offered a vegetarian version - both were delicious. However, the winning dish of the day for me was the branzino. I'm not usually a drinker, but the server suggested a galleon which was perfect. The only slight hitch was that tapas were ordered by individuals and the runners kept plopping them randomly on the table. The dishes are so exotic it took us a minute to realize, but it all worked out and every single thing was so delicious no one seemed to mind.

We came here for an anniversary lunch (I wasn't able to get dinner reservations a week ahead), and Coqueta made the celebration really special.  We opted to sit at the bar to watch the chefs in action, and the staff could not be more friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  Even though it was 2pm, the restaurant was packed, and the staff was incredibly busy, but they took the time to explain things to us and patiently answer our questions.  You can tell their intention is to make each patron's dining experience a positive one.  We asked one waitress about the house-cured Fuet dish as she was plating it, and not only did she explain the dish, but gave us a free sample as well.  Watching the staff execute and plate each dish was an entertaining show in itself and made us want to order everything.  Coqueta was great for a luxurious leisurely tapas meal, where you take your time to savor each small dish.  It's definitely not a place to go if you have kids with you and you are in a rush.  The staff was amazing.  At one point, I noticed a hair in my Almond Joy drink and the waiter not only brought a new one, but deducted that drink, as well as dessert from our bill. Completely above and beyond what's expected, and very much appreciated.  Some stand out dishes were the Grilled Razor Clams, Churro Fantasia, Wood-Grilled Octopus, and Grilled Iberico Secreto (pork) dishes, but honestly, every dish looked amazing.

We followed the anchovies and the roasted padron peppers - which had a nice fresh pepper flavor - definitely not spicy.

The ambiance is its greatest asset, the food is good but not great, and the service is generally strong but varies greatly within the team.  To be fair, my husband and 10-year-old son think am being a little too harsh in my assessment.\n\nThe Food:  The menu is a high point, from its design to the wide range of tapas and other options and their descriptions.  We ordered six tapas, and all were good to very good, but none were to-die-for-I-must-have-it-again.  The dishes are creative and presented well.  The house cured boquerones were delish, as were the house-cured white anchovies.  My son's fave was the Sunny side-up egg with shrimp.  The crispy shrimp pancake was interesting and crunchy, but I am always turned off when I see sauce that has been applied through a squeeze bottle.  It screams \"bulk food\" no matter how haute.  Lukewarm on the grilled albondigas, but to be fair the eaters are more used to ground beef.  We went for the paella, which was something of a letdown after all the tapas.  It should have been the piece de resistance, but was under inspired.  I would definitely skip it next time, and spend the $40 on more tapas.\n\nThe Ambiance:  Great, very comfortable, rustic yet open, perfect size crowd, spacious.  I'm looking forward to a cocktail in the pop-out, heated bar next time.\n\nThe Service:  It was good, but there was a noticeable inconstancy in the runner staff.  Some of our tapas was plunked on the table, and announced as the runner turned and scuttled back to the kitchen for the next service.   No presentation or time for questions.   Other tapas was presented, stirred, mixed, or served with a smile and interest.  Please train all of your staff to do that!\n\nIn sum, the food lacked the like-water-for-chocolate excitement I would expect from celebrity-chef Spanish cuisine.  However, the setting and restaurant itself are great spaces, and I would go back again for just a cocktail and a few tapas with friends.", "author": "Julie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-02", "description": "Was really really looking forward to this place when I made our reservation over a week ago. Im a big foodie and love trying new restaurants in SF. Had a reservation set for Jardiniere, Spruce, and Coqueta. Opted on Coqueta for several reasons: new restaurant, famous chef, great location (pier 5), fun atmosphere, and solid reviews  on Yelp. Took about 7-8 clients out for a celebratory dinner and when I called to make the reservation I requested the best table that is available and she said it would be no problem. So...we get there at 7:45 for our 8:00 reservation. I checked in with the hostess and walked to the lovely but very busy bar area to get a cocktail.  It was IMPOSSIBLE to get a drink. There were only TWO bartenders for the bar area and dining room....from what I counted. That is ridic! When I did get the bartenders attention he looked at me like \"what do you want\"...and said he was trying to get the attention of the hostess so he never took my order. He was rude. Next, I asked a nice waitress I saw walking around for a cocktail list and ordered with her. Around 8:15 the hostess pointed out a communal bar stool long thin type table in the bar area would be \"ready for us soon.\" Ummm....a communal...can't even have a conversation bc it's so loud table is the best you can do for a reservation?? I told her this just wouldn't work. So the manager, whom was very pleasant and tried his best to be helpful told us a table in the \"dining room\" would be available in 35 minutes approximately. So we asked if we could order a bunch of apps and cocktails at this so called table they were initially going to seat us at. They were cool with this and happy to make us comfortable until our table was ready. In the meantime, we STILL have not gotten our cocktails...holy crap, really? It was almost 8:30 and we have yet to get a drink. We were trying to spend some money and it was difficult to do! We literally received about 4 apps before a DRINK! In my opinion, this is unacceptable. Hire more bartenders, Coqueta. You're going to be a busy restaurant!! So after trying about 10 different apps, 2 pitchers of Sangria, and a few cocktails, our table was finally ready at 9:15...9:15. I know they did their best on the table thing, but they should ALWAYS let people know ahead of time of this table that is located in the bar area, bc it is very casual and a very small table. And the fact that its communal for a work dinner is not cool. So now on to the important part...the food. Food was good...some plates very good...some decent. Obviously, this is tapas style so easy to share. I think we literally ordered everything on the menu. Spent almost $1,000 and didn't leave super full. Cocktails were yummy, and the desert was super yummy. I will definitely give this restaurant another shot, especially once they have outdoor tables, but if they don't hire more bartenders they will not be worth the wait. There are tons of great restaurants in SF that mix up some wonderful stuff so I hope Coqueta steps it up a bit. They really could be a great place once the odds and ends get worked out.

I consider myself to have a sophisticated palette, having been to some of the best restaurants in the Bay Area, including Napa and Sonoma.  I pass Coqueta every day on my way to work so I thought I would finally give it a try.  My friend and I ordered the Sangria which was pretty tasteless and seemed watered down.  The waitress asked if we were ready to order and we said we did not get menus.  She said we had to open the drink menu all the way.  The menu is on a piece of paper folded in half and half again.  The food menu is on the inside.  She said everyone asks the same thing.  Really?  OK, if this is a problem, perhaps it should be addressed?  My friend and I both thought the menu was hard to navigate with way too much crammed on one page.  We ordered four small plates to share.  The beet salad, chicken croquettes, duck and pork meatballs and the crispy shrimp pancake.  All portions were ridiculously small.  I've been to many Tapas restaurants where the small plates were worth sharing.  Not the case here.  The beet salad, although tasty, was so small it was laughable.  The only other dish that was tasty were the chicken croquettes.  The meatballs were greasy and the shrimp pancake was just a mound of fried dough--could not taste the shrimp at all.  Dessert was a disappointment as well.  Greasy donuts and bite size cheesecakes not worth the effort.  My cappuccino was served in what I consider to be an espresso sized cup.  My friend's regular coffee was also served in the same size cup.  When he asked for more coffee the waitress said \"our French press is broken.\"  What?  Really?  Speaking of our waitress, she seemed tired, bored and not interested in waiting on us.  The rest of the staff removed our dirty dishes so fast, we felt rushed throughout the entire meal.  After spending over $100.00 on dinner, I feel I should not leave a restaurant hungry.  The only thing I did appreciate was the design.  As a Designer, its not bad.  The animal skins glued to the floor is a trip hazard and a law suit waiting to happen.  I was leaning against heavy drapery on the back of the seat bench which was getting annoying after awhile.  One of the staff members came up to our table to reach behind me to open the shade.  This was ackward and rude during dinner.\n\nThis place is trying WAY too hard to be cool and hip but in my opinion is failing miserably.

Anyway, the host and hostesses were not friendly, they were condescending.. not helpful.  The service was slow slow slow, our waitress was nice but slowwww and she ended up forgetting one of our plates (the one they pushed on us) and never apologized for it.  The food was nothing spectacular, very un-exciting.  The best plate was their duck/pork meatballs despite the hard sell for their pepper dish that every last employee came to our table to tell us how delicious it was.  It became very uncomfortable to have so many people try to push a dish.  . I've never experienced any restaurant push so hard to sell a dish.  When we got it, it was just \"ok\".\nSuffice to say, I doubt I will go back to Coqueta.", "author": "Kelly B."}

Small portions of average food at a high price.  Having said that, the ambiance and service were above average. Food just didn't live up to some of the rave reviews. Will keep looking for good Spanish food.", "author": "Karen T."}

Among other things, we ordered the pinxtos--ham and manchego cheese.  At $7 each, for 3/4 inch squares, these were the biggest culinary ripoffs ever.   $2 would have been more like it.  The service was great.  If they can rationalize their food servings/costs, it would be highly recommended.", "author": "Susan K."}

We disregarded several of the other tripadvisor reviews and wanted to form our own opinions. While your food remains quite delicious (stars were the smoked salmon, the sunny side up egg, and the albondigas) it did seem to be a bit overpriced (don't bother with the pinxtos or razor clams while the paella and octopus are just so-so). The biggest surprise on our visit was the service, or rather the lack of service. The restaurant was packed and we were seated promptly but waited at least 5 minutes before receiving water. After we finally ordered cocktails our server forgot to put our order in correctly and my cousin didn't receive her drink (it should be noted that the server was apologetic and did end up providing the drink on the house which was a nice and appreciated touch). Another disappointing note was the fact that it was a rather hot day in he city and we were all looking forward to a pitcher of sangria but were informed that they were out of it by our 6:45 reservation. Overall experience was that the restaurant was in an awesome location on the water, the food was hit or miss depending on the order (but overpriced regardless) and the service was lacking when compared to Bottega.", "author": "Frank B."}

The octopus, squid, chickpea and shrimp pancake and duck/pork meatballs were the best dishes we had; the chicken croquettas were quite bland.  The paella was really flavorful and their housemade chorizo was excellent.  Based on the ratings and hype we expected more; none of the food compared with what we had in Barcelona this spring.  Also, our server was quite weak - she didn't seem very knowledgable and was not around much.  It was nice to see Michael in the kitchen - he was very attentive.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

I'm really bummed about this because it's so close to my work. The duck meatballs was an all time favorite dish until the last two times I have ordered them they have been over cooked, and the cherry sauce was burnt. Also, when I decided to come in for dinner after work last week with some friends, the snooty \"manager\" who sat us at a crowded table proceeded to loudly flirt with the older gentleman at the table next to us bending from the waist showing off her fishnet tights. (Really?) It was somewhat a challenge to get the waiters attention with her in the way. I thought this was a classy place, apparently not run by classy people....Finally, after fifteen minutes of awkwardness with this going on beside us, our polite and professional server took our order. On the upside we had really wonderful gin cocktails and the cheesecake dessert was exceptional. However, with the bill price and the carnival circus act we saw, we we're put off and gave the two star review. I sure hope the food returns to its former glory!", "author": "Pat Y."}

I was really excited for this place to open, because I love Spanish food.  I'm very particular about food from countries I've visited, however.  I had high hopes based on all of the press though and I was not disappointed. Michael Chiarello even chatted with us throughout our meal!  I love the vibe. It makes you want to hang out all night (probably why some of the folks on here complained about a wait for their table).  \n\nWe started out with a couple cocktails--I had the Tariff and my friend had the Conquistador--and they both lived up to our expectations.  I don't like gin, if I'm being honest, but I am a sucker for Cava.  The Tariff was delicious.  I didn't try any of the other cocktails, because I wanted the Blackbird Rose on tap served in a porron--so cool, love that!\n\nWe ordered a couple hot tapas, a couple cold and one larger dish.  I dreamt about the boquerones pinxto.  Seriously, if you like white anchovies, order this skewer.  We tried the Serrano & Manchgeo pinxto too.  Ham & cheese, how can you go wrong?  The chicken & English pea croquetas were perfectly crisp on the outside and oozy and creamy on the inside.  Just be careful when you eat these babies, because the inside is HOT (our server did worn us, thankfully)!  I will be back, if only to order these tasty balls of yumminess. We also ordered the sunny side-up egg, on Chef Chiarello's recommendation.  Holy cow, it's the perfect hangover dish! I wonder if he makes it for himself the morning after a \"long\" night.  We also tried the duck meatballs.  I loved the savory duck with the cherry jam on the top.  It was the perfect combination of salty & sweet.   The only larger dish we ordered was the arroz with the scallops. It wasn't too rich, which I really appreciated about the dish.  The scallops were set, perfectly cooked, over a tasty sea of tomato-y creamy (but not heavy) rice (also perfectly cooked).  The peas added a nice texture to the dish too.  For dessert we had the churros and the Manchego cheesecake pops.  I'm not big on sweet desserts and these two were great choices.  Neither were over the top sweet and the hot chocolate with the churros took me back to Barcelona.  The churros themselves were nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the center.  Clearly, the Manchego cheesecake pops are a hit!  I don't like cheesecake, but my friend wanted to try them.  For me to say I like cheesecake is major.  I liked this cheesecake, a pleasant surprise.\n\nTo sum it up, I will be back.  All the time, if I can get in!", "author": "Madeleine G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-28", "description": "Michael Chiarello could make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich seem like some kind of out of mind, taste extravaganza.  Coqueta is absolutely the best restaurant to hit the SF waterfront in years.  Fun, Hip and an unbelievable Bar to boot.  Seeing Michael Chiarello in the kitchen and occasionally roaming the rooms is the ultimate treat.\n\nWe tried several of the drinks and favored the Presidio and fine wine selections from Spain.   Make sure you belly up to the bar and watch the mixologists at work.  It is like seeing an artist work a canvas pulling form the multitude of fresh items in copper jars on the bar.  \n\nNext we ventured into the beautifully crafted dinning room and experienced the best tapas this side of Barcelona, (ok.... maybe better).  Michael has combined his ability to update any dish into a tastebud orgasm.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming, but our waiter Josh could not have been more adorable and helpful.  He literally took our likes and dislikes upfront and proceeded to bring out a wonderful sampling of the menu.  Favorites were  many but here goes:  The \"Tattas\" Bravas are the best tater tots you could ever imagine!  The Sopa de ajo, Bread and Garlic soup with green garlic pesto and hen egg was devine, Grlled albondigas, duck and pork meatballs were a favorite at the table, Dungeness crab was grilled and uniquely tasty, Vineyard Greens, a small portion but directly from Michels garden we were told, and worth every bite.  Favorites:  The Arrozo Cremosa, slow cooked rice with day scallops and Fideua, vermicelli pasta cooked like paella with shrimp and asparagus.  We sampled some of the sliced cured meats and although pricey, Jamon Iberico de Bellota was worth every morsel.  Also fun were the Pintxos which a server presents to the table throughout the dinner, $2.50 small skewer samplings,  a fun way to try Michael's creative food creations.\n\nThe desert menu is creative.  We shared a version of a cheese cake on a stick and apple pie tart with blue cheese ice cream.  Both were worth every calorie.  How Michael can make a cappuccino into a uniquely devine experience is beyond me, but please don't leave without a coffee drink....is it the glassware, Mr. Coffee???  One will never know if is just the spell of a Michael Chiarello meal!", "author": "Nano G."}

The ambiance is great - spacious yet cool, hip yet intimate and cozy all at the same time (if that is even possible).  Then there is the food - Yowza!  I don't even eat meat but when this caliber of food is being served I make an exception.  The pork was out of this world!  The service has none of the kinks of a new place and everyone seems to act as if they take ownership of what is served.  Finally, Michael is an unbelievably nice guy.  I have to admit I had no idea he was a \"celebrity chef\" when I met friends there (I don't watch TV).  However, I dine out all over the world.  For me he was the guy who was residing in my friend Russel's old space (where La Fitte used to be). Michael made us feel so at home and he clearly really cares about the patron experience.  He is passionate about food and cares deeply about service and the whole evening was truly memorable.  And the food was outstanding!!", "author": "L B."}

I was seated in the gazebo area by the hostess after being told there was a 40 minute wait in the main dining room.  I was seated at an empty table with nothing on it.  After 15 minutes with no acknowledgement by the wait staff and other guest coming and getting set ups and drinks, I asked to speak to the manager.  A lady came out and I asked her if I was sitting in the dead zone of the restaurant--all I received was a blank empty stare--she had no idea what I was talking about.  I explained that I had been waiting for service, other diners had come in after me and were served and nothing had happened.  I ordered three items from the menu;  the \"El Plat Cap\" a selection of cured meats was overpriced $28 for the quality, quantity, the platter was mostly covered with bread and homemade crackers there was also a pile of salt on the platter-salt with cured meats?, the \"Sunny side-up egg\" was very greasy and there was a pool of grease on the plate when finished, and lastly the Churro dessert the chocolate sauce was boring and the strawberry powder was intense and I really didn't know what to do with it.

Waiter was very helpful, and we (2 of us) enjoyed the shrimp/chickpea pancake, the tatas bravas (perfect little tater tot thingies), duck and pork meatballs, couple of the cheese pinxtos, and the tortilla Andres (wedges of potato and onion), along with the pleasant (and fruit filled) sangria, and the chocolate cake dessert.  Don't know how they do it, but the dishes followed each other perfectly timed, allowing us to focus on and savor each individually.  And they're all worth spending time with.  The decor is warm and expansive.  We sat at the chef's bar, and I wouldn't go out of my way for one of those perches again...you don't really get to see much in the way of cooking and the stools are not the most comfortable.  When I return, and I will, I intend to explore the bar--a quaint, separate structure that fronts on the water.  Looked like fun.  Only cautionary note:  the menu can get pricey.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-21", "description": "I hate to rag on a restaurant that has such high reviews (whenever I use yelp reviews I get so confused by the extreme differences) but I am relieved to see others (Albert H for example) experienced the same lapse in service that we did.  We didn't make reservations but happened to be on the Embarcadero at 5pm on a Sat. night so we decided to see if they had room for walk-ins.  The host stand was a mass of confusion but we were seated almost right away at the long bar.  The bar stools are far from comfortable and that's coming from a gal who likes to sit on bat stools!  Despite this, we were eager to try the menu.  After about 15 minutes of watching servers running around doing anything from folding napkins to chatting with the line chef (there were only about 3 tables seated and a few folks at the bar like us - I mean it was 5:00 which is a bit early for dinner) a server finally asked us if we would like a drink! I ordered a cocktail which is rare and again Albert H was spot-on - I just wanted a gin and tonic and ended up with a cucumber infused bitters laced froo-froo drink.  But at least I got my drink!  My husband's wine didn't show up for another 15 minutes after which I grabbed an elusive waitress and advised them he never got his wine - it was clearly lost in the shuffle.  By this time the waitress actually assigned to our station showed up and we placed our order for a few plates.  I think some of the delays may have been due to tardy staff, but even if that is the case, there was an excess of servers whose stations were empty - I don't get how you can miss an agitated person sitting at the bar trying to catch someone's attention - any attentive waitstaff worth their salt can recognize these signs.  Anyhow, the waitress happened to notice that I wasn't touching my gin and tonic and asked me if I didn't like it to which I said yes and she said she would take it away.  On the plus side, my husband's wine was delicious so I ordered a pour for myself (and they are generous pours for the $$).  I was disappointed to see that the gin and tonic was not removed from the bill.  All in all the loss to a business like that for a returned drink (which if the cocktails are as good as some folks claim probably doesn't happen often) is nil but the good feeling it engenders in the customer is irreplaceable.  The food was ok - nothing stellar that I can recall (we had the mixed meat and cheese plate, calamari and some fried something or other potatoe or cheese thing) but with service as lacking as that (maybe it is different for reservation folks but really as a restaurant you are going to have different standards of service for walk-ins vs reservations?!?!) we won't go back anytime soon.", "author": "Kim G."}
