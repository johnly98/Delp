It's located inside the Warwick hotel and easy to find. \n\nI ordered a martini which was really well done. Tough to mess up but, the bartender was super friendly. The happy hour food however...that's another story. The olives were incredibly salty (and that's tough to do even for me), the mixed nut medley was pretty meh and the patatas bravas was just ok. I'm not sure if they're going for a Spanish theme here because the bar doesn't give that vibe but, the menu sure does. \n\nAnyway, overall it's an ok experience but not something I'd send people to given the amount of high caliber food/eats in the surrounding area.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

The bartenders were attentive and friendly and one of them made my drink, Dangerous Bangkok, with a lot of precision and detail. The flavors were there, but I didn't love it.\n\nAfter visiting yelp, I was confident that the European had happy hour, but when asking about it, I was told there was no happy hour.\n\nAlso, this bar brings more of a stuffy crowd with suits and business meetings.

Chef Miguel, Bar Man Eric, the wait staff, and the food all made me look like a genius to my group.\n\nWe descended on the place in waves, and built of to a large group with discriminating taste for exceptionally good food and well fashioned drinks. We were all delighted with the variety and quality of tapas and the innovative, as well as classic, drinks they offer here at the European. \nThere was just no stumping Eric, he's a master behind the bar.\n\nThe tapas are rich, delicious, and varied as they come from kitchen of Bota Tapas Restaurant, right there in the hotel. I did quite a bit of table hopping among my happy guests and tried a little bit of many dishes. Patatas Bravas, Garlic Shrimp, Chicken Fingers (who knew chickens had fingers!?), Brussels Sprouts, on and on. Every choice was a hit. The Charcuterie plate, meat and cheese, was one of my favorites ( I hovered at THAT table for a while! ) Oh... and the Lamb Chop Lollipops ...OMG tender, moist, and flavorful!\n\nGreat food, fine wine, expertly mixed drinks... and a quiet TV behind the bar so some people can keep one eye on the game in progress!\n\nThe European has a separate room, right there next to the bar area, separated by a heavy drapery. It has a warm feel to it, with tables, sitting areas, coffee table, and an roomy mingling zone right there in the middle.\nIt's a nice discreet area to sit when it's just you two. But for us it was like a cocktail party room all our own. Classy. \nLots of people, or just a couple looking for a place to have a pre-show (or even post-show) drink and a nosh, this place is perfect. The Curran Theater, and The Geary Theater, are both right across the street. Once you realize how great the food is, ask for a table right there at Bota Tapas and Paella Bar, just across the lobby.... but more on Bota next time.", "author": "James G."}

I like that! But don't worry, it won't replace my beloved Burritt Room as my go to drinking spot, which coincidentally is only an 8 min walk from the European. However, you'll see me checking in here more often (oh hey stalkers) since they have a bargain of a HH. From open til 7pm, you can get $6 wine, $6 cocktails, $4 pomme frites and $4 braised pork sliders. If you're feeling classy and sh*t, get the melt in your mouth $9 steak bites. \n\nI LOVED that they have the Aperol spritz on the HH menu since I usually like to start off with a low alcohol drink these days. (shuddup Peter L!) Aperol, prosecco and club soda is a combination that's pretty much a winner with any of the ladies. Not to mention, it brings me back to the time I gallivanted in Italy for two full weeks drinking nothing but this sparkly referesher. The European and Nouveau are also very good choices. And if you don't like your drink, don't fear. The European is the kind of place where you can be completely satisfied with your selection and if not, as what happened with me, Jake went the extra mile to make it right despite the very packed bar.

It was so delicious and refreshing and I loved that it came in the bell pepper. \nAfter I finished my first drink, I was feeling a bit more adventurous, so he made me a special concoction not on the menu.

I'm shocked because I really meant to some months ago when I hosted a party for a friend in the back lounge-y area. It was actually a baby shower, but she wanted something not very baby and not very shower. This place delivered!  It was swanky yet comfortable and the food, drinks and staff were all great!  There's a big velvet curtain you can pull to section the area off but we ended up not pulling it over that far. Nice to have the option. \n\nQuick call out on the food...we ordered several items to have lots of choices for our semi-big group. Everything had a gourmet spin to it and the flavors were great.

It is very European and is befitting of a high-end chain like the Warwick.\n\nWe ordered a couple of signature Europeans (don't have the ingredients), and a Love Letter (vodka, lemon, hibiscus, ginger & seltzer) at $12/each.  Unfortunately, both drinks were too sweet for all our tastes.  We switched to real men drinks afterwards:  Tequila rocks w/ a squeeze of lime; vodka tonic; and rum & coke:  3 Stars for the cocktails.\n\nThe ambiance is very nice and there are several tables to sit at, or push together for a large party.  A couple of downsides are if you want to eat, be prepared to drop $3/each for Fanny Bay Oysters, or $18 for a burger w/ fries.  In addition, if you want to use the restroom, it is down the elevator and around the corner:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the service was very good from our waiter.  He was attentive and very polite:  4 Stars.\n\n3.5 Stars overall.  The European is a cool place to have drinks after dinner and before a club.

Portion size was good (in a practical sense) but seemed small for the price.\n\nQuality prawns came with an assortment of accompaniments including an interesting yuzu mignonette and a horseradish salt that could have been more punchy.\n\nThe pork jowl bacon was like a marriage of bacon, lardo, and prosciutto: hot and savory waiting to be heaped with bright ricotta on delicious pita. You can almost hear your heart begging you to look away.\n\nThe burger's bun could be firmer (perhaps simply more toasted) but the Vegemite butter and vidalia onions kept me me coming back for bites even after I finished the great fries, dipping them in the Hollandaise-topped egg presented in its shell.\n\nAdam, Sarah, James, and the rest of the bar crew serve an impressive lineup of new cocktails and quality versions of standbys. There are a number of lower-alcohol aperitif cocktails that all escape the too-sweet and uninteresting fate to which most lighter options fall. The menu is helpfully divided by style and presentation, moving on from the lighter options to rocks, ups, downs, and spiritous options. Among them is the Can Can, my favorite of the night, with an initial dramatic note of lavender that soon settles into a dangerously drinkable combination of whiskey, maple, and bitters. Whatever you may think lies outside your normal preferences I urge you to give these drinks a try. A drink with strawberry wasn't at all too sweet. A drink with vodka managed character. A drink made with Sauternes was unmistakably a cocktail without losing the character of the wine.  \n\nI have no doubt my rating is destined to rise as the service is polished to match the excellent fare.

But if Campari isn't your bag, then give any of the expertly crafted cocktails a try and you are sure to find one or five that keep you coming back for more -- The Love Letter, The Duke, & Grazzie Mullie, & Sauternes Punch are drinks that knock a delicious punch!  \n\nThe bar menu is top notch - it's playful and pairs perfectly with the gorgeous cocktails!  The brisket burger is slammn, the wagyu tartar is ridiculous, and the mushroom dusted popcorn is drool worthy.   Best bar food in the city.  Nuff said.\n\nThe setting is a perfect mix of your best friends living room & your favorite european lounge.  it's warm, friendly, buzzing, and has a legit playlist.  Mix all that with smart & friendly bar staff and you have your new home away from home!  See y'all there soon!", "author": "Dana B."}

They charged my card FIVE times for 3 different amounts triggering a fraud alert on my debit card. \n\nSo if you want an experience that lingers with you long after your meal, come here and you too can spend an afternoon on the phone with your bank to clear up The European's mistake.", "author": "Tatyana K."}

Garlic butter with the fries are amazing, the dark sauce with the steak bites are delicious, and the sauces that Come in the burgers make the ordinary burger superb. The drinks are strong and unique. The menu is more interesting and better than the typical cocktails you get. I highly recommend the crabapple holiday drink.", "author": "Grace B."}

Lots of seats at the bar, as well as nice couch configurations in the back for small groups.  The burrata appetizer with grilled peaches is delicious.  Small complaint:  the cheese plate is tiny and not worth $11.", "author": "Sona P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-04", "description": "This review is for cocktails only:\n\nThe European is a nice place to sit and try some interesting craft cocktails.  We sat at the bar and our bartender was friendly, making conversation with us every once in a while.  Seems like most of the drinks aren't on the sweet side so it was perfect for our tastes.\n\nThe Duke - good, dry, all alcohol.\nCocktail de Triomphe - pretty balanced and the crushed pink peppercorns added an interesting element.\nCasino Royale - sort of like a straightforward martini...and the pickled onion infused the drink as it sat, which I liked.\n\nThe bf also asked our bartender if she could make a Brooklyn.  They didn't have all the ingredients but she made a version of it and he was pretty happy with it.\n\nNext time we plan to try some of the items on the bar menu.  We had just finished dinner at the adjoining Aveline so bar food right after was definitely not possible!", "author": "Elaine G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-14", "description": "Came in to the European based on the Yelp reviews.  Gorgeous decor, would make a great date spot.  Really authentic and delicious drinks.  I am not sure that I've ever had a better Old Fashioned.  Wish I'd stopped at the drink though.  At the recommendation of my bartender, I ordered the Waygu beef and fried potatoes.  Didn't realize that the beef would be raw, but I was happy with it, since I am a fan of beef tartar.  The potatoes were sorta soggy and way too rich for my liking, especially paired with the beef.  I ended up getting food poisoning that night.  Not sure if it was a fluke - I would have thought that a place like the European would be up on their food standards.", "author": "Chris K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-08", "description": "I would give the bar 4 stars for the decor and atmosphere, the bartender was brand new, but was really nice and did his best to take care of the food and drinks for our large group during happy hour. The manager came by our table to welcome us which was a nice touch. The unfortunate part and the reason for the 2 star rating was our waiter, who seemed annoyed in general and was pretty rude to our group. He was largely MIA for more than an hour (which matters during HH when you want to take advantage of the specials) which is why the bartender was serving us directly (we were seated in the back), then showed up to 'apologize' for disappearing, but really to scold us for not following protocol in only ordering from him and also to criticize the new bartender for not following procedure (was he supposed to ignore hungry and thirsty customers?). The rest of the evening the waiter seemed frustrated by our rolling drink/food orders, the fact that we had multiple tabs going (which started at the bar), and was very unhappy about having to revise many of the bills as the food/drinks were not tracked to tabs correctly. We felt like we had to apologize for being an inconvenience. I would go back and sit at the bar for sure, but will skip table service in the future. I know firsthand that being a waiter/waitress is a very challenging job, but that's not an excuse to treat good customers poorly.", "author": "Amy M."}

The decor and service are superb. I had the pleasure of having Heather make my drinks, yes I had to stay for a few because they are that different and refined. Heathers service was a delight: humorous, sassy, Korean sexy mixologist. I really enjoyed my time at the European and already looking forward to and planning on returning with friends. If you like Trick Dog, Third Rail, Cotogna, you will enjoy the old fashioned-laborious preparations and memorable tastes of this bar.  See you soon Heather!", "author": "TVAT T."}

Make sure you order one of the specialty cocktails before dinner.  They are so good, you'll end up having three and then thinking, 'I'll just keep sitting here at the bar and order a burger.'

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-05", "description": "My wife and I went here on 7/3/15.  We saw the good Yelp reviews so we decided to give this place a try.  When we arrived, every seat was taken up.  This is usually a good sign.  However, when we finally found two open seats, we waited and waited for someone to take our order.  The bartender closest to us did not give us the time of day until someone standing behind us tried ordering a drink.  After this bartender gave us menus to look over a different bartender came over to take our order.  I ordered an old fashioned and my wife ordered a gin mojito.  While the bartender started to make our drinks, I overheard him ask his co-workers how to make an old fashioned.  Additionally he told multiple customers he did not know how to make drinks because it was his first week.  This is understandable.  Every person starts a new job.  However I feel if you don't know how to make a simple drink like an old fashioned you probably should be working at a cocktail bar.  My drink was ok.  My wife's drink was ok.  Hopefully this was just an off day.", "author": "Mac S."}
