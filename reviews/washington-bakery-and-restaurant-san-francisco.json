I think they are great and I try to come here every chance I get. You can't miss it if you parked in the parking structure under the park. When you come out of the elevators, go up the hill on Washington and it's the first restaurant on the left. Their food a very authentic and their services has gotten much better! \n\nThere has not been anything here that I have ordered that I didn't like. They have breakfast menu from 7:30-11am, with breakfast price ($6) and breakfast size. Breakfast comes with a coffee or tea. They are best known for their congee or porridge; five different kind to choose from and it comes with fried bread, which is awesome! If you are adventurous, I highly recommend the pork giblet or the 1000 year preserved egg with pork porridge. \n\nTheir wonton soups, chow mien, chow fun or fried rice are bomb. Someday, I will need to come and try them for dinner. \n\nEveryone raves and stand in long line for the GG Bakery but I think this place is just as good and you don't have to wait in a long line. \n\nMilk tea with boba... I always take one to go!", "author": "Tinah Y."}

I've passed by it many times but have not tried it as it seems to be a bit too touristy for my liking. A couple of days ago I decided to give it a try nonetheless. I stepped inside and walked over to the ordering station only to be completely ignored by the server who was closing out the check for someone else. When I tried to engage, she handed me off to another older and more experienced server who spoke perfect English and was very courteous. It seems they have a system here to let the more experienced servers deal with \"tourists\" who happen to walk in.\n\nAnyway let's come to the menu. It is your standard Cantonese menu with gazillion choices from wonton noodle soup, porridge, rice plates, pan fried noodles to curries and snacks. As it claims to be a Hong Kong Style Caf\u00e9 I decided to get the Hong Kong specialty of baked rice and went with the baked seafood with satay sauce with spaghetti ($10.50).  After ordering I was pleasantly surprised as I was able to pay by card. After ordering it was almost a 15 minute wait sitting on one of the empty table out front and I was on my way.\n\nA got a large container that was lined with a silver foil that contained the baked seafood over spaghetti. The first thing I noticed was how runny the baked seafood was. First bite confirmed that this had way too much satay sauce and had not spent enough time in the oven to have been baked correctly. It was sufficiently loaded but had tiny shrimps. I would have preferred it they would have given a less number of decent sized shrimp. Overall it seemed like I was eating regular seafood noodles with satay sauce.\n\nPrice wise it was about 15% more expensive than VIP Coffee & Cake shop and Caf\u00e9 Honolulu with its food sitting in the middle of the two with VIP on top and Honolulu on the bottom. Looking at the complete package of quality, service and value for money I'd say Washington Bakery & Restaurant is A-Ok.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I always come for their milk tea and have eaten here like over 100 times over a 10 years period. The waitress are still the same and know me by name. I love their baked seafood rice or the baked two meat piece rice. You can choose spaghetti noodles on white or red sauce. It takes about 15 min to get the stuff baked. Plus it is worth the wait with the extra melted cheese. $.25-.50 for the extra. Everything gets charged but I gladly support the businesses in Chinatown as I don't want them to go out of business. The varieties of items range from traditional Chinese to cafe style to western flavors. I like the fact these they are not heavy on MSG and they taste good without mixing heavy sauces on top. Please don't count on any services here, really, this is China town not your fairmount or Palace hotel. Their pastry are all good, decent enough to take to company meetings. I always go with the coffee roll cakes or the \"old wife\" cake. It is white and chewy with the chestnut in the fillings. The morning breakfasts are $6 with bacon/sausage and egg. Marconi soup or Chinese traditional breakfast of thin noodles with shrimp/beef or other assortment of congees. Both come with a small plate of fried \"oily pieces\" (it is fried floured bread that is light and tasty, not too sweet or Salty\" that's it for now.", "author": "Connie L."}

Jeez, what a racist comment back in the day when they wrote this old chestnut of a song. I certainly don't like my eyes compared to something you find in a tin of Planter's mixed nuts, but we Asians are used to suffering. We even get dragged out of overbooked United flights even when it's not our fault. But I digress as Jamie W. and I were looking for something sweet after a hearty meal of pork chow fun and sesame chicken at Sam Wo's. We usually find ourselves at the Eastern Bakery for a slice of coffee crunch cake, but I felt a need for something different. We came upon a sea of green formica under bright, flickering florescent lights (photo: http://bit.ly/2p67EOh).\n\nToo bad I forgot to bring my sunglasses. We took a look at the dessert display case and decided to try a trio of their sweets, in fact, almost the last three kinds they had for sale. There was a Custard Puff and a Cream Puff shaped like a swan, both for $1.50 (photo: http://bit.ly/2oiD5QM). They called them Buffs, but they apparently didn't use spell check. Bland and a little hard given how long they were probably in a refrigerated state. Marginally better was the $3 slice of Mocha Chestnut Cake Roll, still refrigerated in texture but at least it had more of a discernible flavor with the almond slices on top (photo: http://bit.ly/2p6b6Zv). They also serve hot food, but I'll remember to apply sunscreen before returning.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...oddly bland and heavily refrigerated\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...interrogation rooms have more warmth\nSERVICE - 1.5 stars...very prickly\nTOTAL - 2 stars...did I mention I have almond eyes of brown?", "author": "Ed U."}

It was like they literally went into the back and picked them off the tree and blended them. I really appreciated that fresh taste from my drink.

With extremely low standards of decor and probably cleanliness, this place should've been questionable from the start.\n\nCustomer Service:\n\nThe typical Chinese no-nonsense attitude of service but nothing spectacular in other areas such as efficiency either.\n\nFood:\n\nHere's where I'm torn. We ordered a Portuguese Chicken Rice Bake along with Beef Ho Fun. Both dishes are absolutely delicious and packed full of flavour. I was pretty addicted to the Portuguese Chicken Rice Bake and couldn't get enough!\n\nUnfortunately, later in the day I developed a pretty awful stomach ache and had food poisoning (was the only thing I've eaten so far so it couldn't have been anything else). A damn shame, because the food was delicious and would've easily gotten a 4 stars from me.\n\nAdditionally, considering how there are other reviewers who have also experienced health issues following visits to Washington Bakery, I would probably avoid coming back.", "author": "Clarissa Y."}

They have breakfast specials for $4.50, which includes your choice of a variety of porridge (if you want to go the full Chinese route) or bacon/sausage with an egg and macaroni/oatmeal (if you want to go the... fusion(?) route). There are also some specials that are written only in Chinese, and those are more noodle-based dishes. Either way, no matter what you order off of the breakfast specials menu, you also get a choice of coffee or milk tea.\n\nI went the American/fusion route (since I wasn't really in the mood for Chinese) and chose sausage with egg and macaroni. It's exactly what you would expect -- two pieces of sausage with an egg made to order how you like (I prefer mine over-easy) with a small bowl of cooked macaroni in chicken broth. And, being the milk tea junkie that I am, I ordered that for my drink. The meal is certainly nothing spectacular, but it's definitely not bad for the price. The milk tea is Hong Kong style -- my favoriteee.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have known better than to order American food at a Chinese place. Not to say it was disgusting (how bad can you mess up sausages and eggs?), but the porridge and noodle dishes were far superior.\n\nAll in all, decent portions and quick service.

I love the food options that I have on here which feel a lot like the restaurants in Milpitas of Asian fusion but with older Asian people. They serve really good hot milk tea which is useful on a rainy day like Christmas. The cups with the milk tea in them are evil. They steam at the top but when you touch them, it's room temperature. So I ended up burning my tongue thinking my tea wasn't as hot as it was.\n\nThey're really good with appetizers. The curry fish ball and pineapple dish was a really interesting. It hits the curry craving without the punishment from the carbs.\n\nThis place is usually busy but completely worth the noisiness and chaotic atmosphere.

She told me it's a noodle spot that's pretty popular among visiting Chinese parents. That said, I wouldn't say it's a place I would bring my parents for a nice meal - everything has that almost-sticky quality of a stereotypical Chinatown restaurant and it's also incredibly loud inside. The waitresses mostly speak Cantonese, but you can get by with menu item names. Don't expect superb service, because that's the authentic Chinese restaurant experience. However, they do take credit card! Hallelujah! They also sell Chinese-style bread ($1-2) in the front bakery part of the store. \n\nI got the Beef Tendon Noodle Soup ($6.95). They use the very skinny Hong Kong style noodles, which aren't my favorite but are authentic to Cantonese cuisine. The broth was not too heavily flavored but definitely was tinged with MSG. The portion size was perfect for lunch.\n\nThere are instant noodle options on the menu (yes, it was \"instant noodles\" in Chinese too).

I ordered the baked portuguese chicken with spaghetti. The dish of course took a while since it had to be baked, when it came the cheese was more like powdered on. It wasn't melted into the spaghetti. The sauce barely tasted like portuguese sauce. There was only potatoes and chicken. I was expecting peppers and mushrooms? Atleast that's what's served in NYC.. For the portion and quality of the dish, this place is overpriced. $8 for a teeny dish? One that's not even an authentic dish?\n\nCafe: \nI bought a birthday cake for my cousin. For an 8inch cake, you get grapes and peaches in your fruit cake and some strawberries, pineapple and honeydew on top. The cake was okay, it's nice being able to pick it up within an hour after placing an order. The cake was mostly cream though, but the sponge cake part was light and not overly sweet. There were barely any fruits. \n\nOverall I would say the bakery is a bit better than the restaurant. Prices are also more reasonable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-19", "description": "You know this place is  kinda special. Why? Because, everyone who was raised in, hung around in, or used to frequent Chinatown, knows that over the years, \"the best food,\" has by and large left Chinatown for other areas around SF and beyond. The reasons for the exodus are many, among which is the fact that as the previous older generations of Cantonese immigrants (mostly from Hong Kong) families matured, the later generations moved out, taking with them an economic base that sustained good restaurants and quality food. The present inhabitants of Chinatown which replaced them, are recent immigrants from China that occupy a lower economic rung and cannot sustain the big fancy Chinatown eating palaces of old, (Empress of China, imperial Palace, Four Seas etc. all now closed or closing,) causing a reliance by these restaurants on the tourist trade and therefore a decline in the quality of the food.This reality, coupled with the fact that after the Golden Dragon Shooting several decades ago,and the closing, then opening and  \"shrinking\" of that popular restaurant, people just stopped coming to Chinatown to eat. That created the present void in Chinatown for anything but \"HK cafe style\" food, or take home BBQ and rice plate places (on Stockton St. The \"local marketplace\" street.) that are popular and preferred by the new generation of Chinatown residents, primarily  from South China. So when we can go out as a group of friends, as we did recently, and eat well in Chinatown these days, (anywhere other than the mighty R&G restaurant, the present Chinatown reigning king of good food,) it's a cause for celebration. And celebrate is what I would like to do, at a place that has withstood everything I mentioned for decades and is still going strong, turning out delicious dishes and Cantonese comfort food consistently, from a huge menu, with creative food choices, including some seldom offered old time Cantonese country classics. I am talking about Washington Bakery and Restaurant, on Washington St. across from Portsmouth Square, (the Chinatown Park and Garage). Care to take me out on my B'day? Bring me here please! And we will eat well, for a reasonable price, along with a restaurant completely full of local folks and others from all parts of Frisco, that know how to eat well. If it's lunch time, we'll order from their extensive lunch menu, all for around $7.50 for huge rice plates, noodle and other dishes. If it's dinner like I'm hoping, we'll be sure to order their famous signature \"Wun Tun, chicken noodle,\" (sam wo win run gai) and salt and pepper squid, seafood noodles with egg, \"sam pan jook\", (three innard meats porridge,) salt and pepper fried tofu, (tzao daoufu,) Tofu and Beef pork, fried egg omelette with vegetables, Beef liver and vegetables, chinese greens, ox tail stew and finally chocolate blueberry cake to top it off.

Washington Bakery & Restaurant is a HK style bistro with expansive menu items. \n\nDaily specials come with one lunch menu and a drink (hot/iced tea with lemon or honey lemon). I like the Thursday special which is Yi Mien or E-fu noodles with pork. It's a stir-fried flat egg noodles with pork and white chives. The honey lemon tea and milk tea are rather sweet. I've also tried the tofu claypot with salted fish. I wish the salted fish can taste and smell a bit stronger.\n\nBig portion and cheap.

For a second, I thought this was going to be one of those rare times when I randomly find a good milk tea. Unfortunately, the aroma was more tantalizing than its flavor. Womp womp. It's not a terrible milk tea, but it's not as strong as it should be. Without a really bold brew, the flavor fell flat. The creaminess and sweetness don't really matter if the tea isn't bold enough. Maybe I went on a bad day. At least it smelled pretty good. \n\nThe wonton noodle soup here was actually better than I expected. The wontons were nice and plump, with wholesome shrimp inside to give it a nice firmness to contrast with the softness of the skin and pork. The stuffing was well seasoned, and the spices imparted a pleasant warm fuzziness. The spices are very crucial to wontons. Nothing is more aggravating than biting into a wonton with dull stuffing, and it occurs much too often for a city filled with so many Chinese people. Another surprising aspect of the dish was the noodles. They had a very desirable Chinese al dente texture which gave the noodles a nice bite. It'd be a complete dish if only the broth was made correctly, which was pretty much just plain watery chicken broth. There's no sign of the dried seafood flavors that enrich the broth with the umami-ness required to infuse continuous flavor in every slurp. Without the broth, the wonton noodle soup falls short. \n\nI just have to say that I also found the bowl very amusing. There's a handle on the side of it that lets you pick it up to drink the soup. Although I didn't find it that tasty, I found myself drinking the entire bowl just because I wanted to use the handle. Genius!\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area, I might stop by again.", "author": "Nei N."}

It was spicy and flavorful.  The eggplant and pork chop clay pot came out bubbling.  You have to order a side of rice as it doesn't come with the dish.  It was really filling, but at the end of the dish, we were left with a vat of oil.  The chinese broccoli was your one of he mill veggie.  Nothing special.

No, I'm not counting those bakeries where most customers get a bun and run. I'm talking about sit down, read an actual menu, and ordering something that requires utensils. This is my spot. They offer a $4.50 special menu from 7:30 am to 10:30 am everyday (warning: dine-in only). There are three menu options for $4.50 as follows: \n\nOption A \nBacon, Sausage, or ham (note singular) with one egg (choice of how done), and Oatmeal or Macaroni and Toast - Choice of coffee or milk tea (nai cha) - popular Hong Kong beverage combining house tea (usually red tea) with coffee cream or half and half; add sweeteners to personal liking. \n\nOption B (menu, half in English, half in Chinese) \n1. Preserved Egg & Pork Porridge \n2. Minced beef Porridge \n3. Assorted pork giblet Porridge \n4. Meat ball Porridge \n5. Pork Liver Porridge \n(all above served with Chinese Fried Bread - yiao tiu) \n6. Ground Beef Vermicelli Soup \n7. Spam and Instant Noodle Soup \n8. Snow cabbage & shredded Pork Vermicelli Soup \n9. Ham and Macaroni Soup \n10. Shredded Chicken and Macaroni Soup \n(this portion of menu is written in Chinese only) - includes coffee and milk tea beverage. \n\nOption C \nInstant Noodle - add your choice of three items from the following: \na) beef stew, b) beef tendon, c) pork intestines, d) pork blood, e) stewed egg - slow boiled in soy sauce, f) chicken wing, or g) lettuce \n- includes coffee and milk tea beverage (entirely in Chinese on menu) \n\nI am fortunate to have a coworker with the patience to translate this for me so I know my full options the next time I'm there. No, it's not a culinary adventure or place to impress; but tell me where you can get this many choices at this price. Having eaten breakfast one block away at the Hilton, this is certainly a meal that's a lot easier on the pocketbook. \nMy favorite here is their fresh watermelon juice, great on those warm summer days. It's a little pricey at $3.50 per cup (12 to 16 oz.), but it is both sweet and flavorful, complete with pulp. They also make a large variety of tapioca pearl drinks.

The specials were written on a dry erase board in chinese only and you could see the cooks busy in the kitchen passed the long serving counter that ran most of the length of the restaurant.  At that moment I knew I had struck pay dirt!\n\nThe meal we had was fabulous and cheap.  I have since been back there at least a hundred times, bringing new people with me as often as I had the opportunity.  This place is one of those hidden gems in the city.  My favorite dishes are their salt and pepper cod, beef porridge,  and salt and pepper spareribs, and their chinese broccoli in oyster, garlic, or whatever sauce strikes my fancy.  It also seems that whenever I go with other people I end up trying something new that I love.\n\nWe left that place fat and happy and I always look forward to going back.

Their bathroom is a lot cleaner than some other chinese restaurants I have been to around chinatown.  For some saucy food, I think their dishes are pretty delicious.  Their portions are reasonably decent, and the flavors in their dishes are amazing.  I always have to have the hong kong style beef chow fun when I go.  It's really saucy and has a lot of beef in the dish.\n\nI am giving this place two stars is because of their service.  Like Leena N. mentioned, their waitresses have a hard time understanding English and after pointing to the menu of what I wanted, they still got my order wrong.  Secondly, the brought me a bowl of rice with my meal, assuming that this was part of my meal, I ate the rice as well.  However, when I got my bill, they added an additional $1.25 for every bowl of rice.  Lastly, when I asked for a take out box, the waitress kind of threw the box at me...probably because I complained about the charging for the bowl of rice when I didn't even ask for rice...\n\nI would like to add one more thing, they offer a validation for parking, something about making it $3 for all day.  However, it is not the parking lot right next to them, but it is the parking lot near some international building on Clay street.  I have no idea if this is even true or if the waitress just didn't want to validate my parking ticket, but I thought it would be good information to pass on.\n\nSince I did not want to leave on a sour note, I do like their bakery.

The thought of XO sauce beef tail or shrimp wonton noodles or jook just make my stomach duck and cover.  (And that's not because I'm vegetarian, either-- I went to many a HK style cafe back in the day before I gave up meat.)  For the record, though, there is so little on the menu that doesn't have some kind of meat or sea food.  The waitress recommended I have plain jook (rice porridge).  Oh yes-- that's always appealing.\n\nEveryone here was Chinese save for one white lady, who no doubt came because her dining companion was a Chinese gent.  The service is abrupt, I guess if you can squeak out some Chinese (Cantonese preferred) that'd be helpful.  Or you could resort to pointing to menu items.  The black tea (Lipton?) comes in really cute tin cups, I must say, and the portions are pretty fair.  $6.25 for wonton noodle soup.  $6.25 for some kind of beef tendon noodle soup, too.  A lot of noodle and rice dishes... but again, very few that do not include meat (you can, however, ask to have the meat omitted).\n\nThe baked goods at the front counter look nice, but I'm not sure how they taste-- probably mediocre, I imagine, as would fit the restaurant appeal and appearance overall.  Forgive me for sounding very un-PC, but unless you grew up in Chinatown or a similar neighborhood-- or are straight from the old country-- then I don't see how you'd find yourself wandering in here for a bite.", "author": "Lynn O."}

At the end of my meal, before another server was about to drop my check, she looked to him for confirmation as he was passing my table. He impatiently flicked his hand at me, as if to say, \"Get this disgusting white piece of shit out of here.\" I tipped nearly $3 on a bill that was just over $8, hoping to make amends for my imposition, but after leaving I realized that I had done nothing wrong.\n\nI was so caught off guard by his behavior simply because I didn't expect it.

The beef was tender, noodles flavorful, and the soup was a little on the salty side, but also flavorful.  That soup came in a big ol' bowl.  We were both able to get 3 bowls each.  It was probably meant for a party of 4.  This is what I love about Chinese restaurants... big bowls of soup.

This place is NOT authentic Chinese food; the fact that it is a bakery-turned-to-a-restaurant shows that the managers are just in it for the profits (and you can see it in the prices.)  Sure, $10 a dish is considered cheap elsewhere in San Francisco.  But honey, you in Chinatown now.  Anything over $6 is a ripoff.  Take it from someone who grew up in Chinatown all his life.\n\nThe dishes are good, but like someone once said, \"MSG can make dirt taste good.\"  And the service is horrendous.  Here is my story that made me open my eyes: If you are a foreigner, sure. You'll get served quick, but know that you are supporting three mistresses who discriminate against their own people in order to please the tourists.  That's actually racial discrimination: when you will only serve the starving old Chinese ladies (who happen to be my grandmother and her friends) AFTER you serve the foreigners/tourists who all arrived 10 minutes after us.  We only ordered two dishes, but the other non-Asian people ordered at least 4 dishes.  We STILL got served last, while those people were already a quarter-way into all their 4+ dishes.  This is not acceptable: not of waitresses, not of decent human beings.\n\nAnd again, the food.  This place looks nice and fancy, but their food--trust me: MSG all the way (I'm still thirsty 4 hours after eating there).  And this wasn't my first visit (it will be my absolute last though).  Before, the texture of the meat seemed like it was cooking in the pot since morning and OMG, the drinks are made from canned preservatives!!  I gave this place three chances, and it failed all three.  I implore you: please stay away from this place.  The ladies who run it are bad people, and beware: they include gratuity ALREADY into the bill (confirmed with college-student calculation)\n\nIf you are visiting Chinatown, please actually explore this crippling town and stray more than just a mere block away from Grant.  Grant Street has been the epitome of aggressive commercialization and the destruction of the Chinese culture.  Go to Powell, or Broadway, or maybe even the alleyways... there, the decor is nothing to brag about, but the authenticity is real and so is the love.\n\nEnjoy your stay in Chinatown. :)", "author": "Alan L."}

Good food, good service, clean bathroom, what more can one ask for in a Chinatown eatery?  Yesterday, I bought some Durian buns to go.  So sublimely delicious!  Even my mom, who usually dislike the smell of the fruit in a pastry, thoroughly enjoyed her half of the bun that we shared.  The only complaint we have is their absolute refusal to sell us one of their mugs that they use which keeps the warm beverage warm without heating up the outer layer an iota.

We stopped by for the black bean \"pai quat\" pork rib rice claypot for $7.50.  It's not printed in English (Chinese on the menu), so you have to ask for it. They have about 8 rice claypot items to select from.  The 2nd item was the beef stew won ton noodle, $6.50.  Yes, I know I indicated \"we were in a hurry\" but funny how when Hubby wants to eat a certain item (rice claypot), we're suddenly not in a hurry anymore because it took 20 mins. to cook.  By the time we got it home, the rice was kinda dry and the meat was too.  I didn't like the couple of chunks of beef stew in my won ton noodle, it looked like old dark meat, not very flavorful & tough. The noodle was OK, but the won ton with the visibly encased shrimp was fishy smelling.  \nThe menu is extensive.  If you're a beverage fanatic, they have 48 cold beverage choices, 16 hot beverages & 14 pearl drinks to select from.  You could have a foodless liquid meal instead by trying a ton of these!  \n\nThe place is huge and probably gets crowded at lunch time, but for 5:15 PM on a Sunday night, there were less than 20 patrons in the restaurant. We didn't try any of the pastries but they do offer small pieces of cake about a 2x3 inch piece for only $1.25.

When I walked in to be seated, I did not even get a \"Hello how many?\" or even a simple \"Hi\". Instead, they were just standing around doing nothing while one person had brought me to a table. These fobs also do not know how to listen. My brother asked for a COLD milk tea, and they gave him a hot milk tea. I guess they don't speak engrish well. The noodles were mediocre, and the smell in there is horrid. The only good thing in there is the pineapple bun with coconut filling. And when I asked them to LI LI LI LI LI LI LICK MY LOLLIPOP, they didn't know if I was speaking English or Chinese.\n\nCliffnotes:\nThe service sucks.\nDon't know how to speak english.\nPineapple bun good.", "author": "weezy b."}

They have a good selection of baked items, meal items, as well as hot and cold drinks. I've only ordered pastries each time I've been here (note: I've got the biggest sweet tooth of anyone I know!). However, I always take a bite out of others' dishes. Hence, I can tell you that my fiance's wonton noodle soup was hot, steamy, and they did not skimp on the wontons! My sister's Cha Siu Bao (bbq pork bun) was nice and fluffy on the outside, and filled with a lot of very tasty pork on the inside. Her boyfriend's Hong Kong Style Lo Mein was also very good. On my second visit, I had their Coconut Cream Puff, a bite of my friend's Blueberry Cheesecake (she loved it!), and my other friend's Lemon Cake. We were all very happy with our orders. My only complaint: seems like they were out of several items fairly early in the day. Their display case didn't seem to have as much selection as the first time. Can you believe they were out of egg tarts by 1 or 2 in the afternoon?? In any case, you should still give it a try!", "author": "Lucy H."}

It's not too far from work, but sometimes there are a lot of people at lunch time, so it's better to go later around like 1ish.  Lot of variety, but I usually get one of the fried rice places, fish porridge, or something simple.  The ja lerng seems to always be stale when you order it at lunch, at least the two or three times I ordered it at lunch.  Probably leftover from the morning.  Never tried their pastries, but they look pretty standard for what you find at a bakery anyhow.", "author": "kenny w."}

I used to like this place because it's the cleanest cafe in Chinatown . But now that I'm older and wiser, I don't like this place anymore . Their food is overpriced esp. the rice and noodle dishes . You can get cheaper and better at a lot of places in Chinatown . The things on the menu bore me . The Mongolian beef here is good but too salty . The tomato beef with spaghetti wasn't really that good .. it was very bland and the pieces of beef were too big . The mixed fruit split tasted weird but the banana split is good . The iced longoon drink is good - not too sweet but just right . The tapioca drinks here are either hit or miss . The tangerine with pearl is super duper sour so I suggest you stay away from that unless you're pregnant lol . The honeydew with pearl and watermelon with pearl is good though because they use real fruits and its kind of creamy in a way . Their buns they sell here are good .. very fresh but their cakes aren't really that good . This place is sometimes really crowded and the service is okay but be sure to give them good tip or they will ask you to give more on the way out lol . How rude huh ? But another reason why I used to love this place is because I used to love the little cakes with the cream filling  called Deli Manjoo (Yes, I looked up the name for all of you) they use to sell in the corner .. but they don't sell it anymore ! I am so mad !! lol they were my favorite !!  They should bring it back ! ):", "author": "Eileen L."}

As much as I really like Eastern Bakery in Chinatown, I would select Washington Bakery hands down--any day, any way.  Their egg custard tarts are killer.  All of their deserts are amazing--and they aren't the kind that look like they are going to be really yummy but end up leaving your taste buds disappointed, lonely, and sad.  So no worries.  Pick up whatever looks tempting with confidence.  Don't neglect to get extra goodies for coffee in the morning.  One other thing that makes this bakery better than Eastern are the fruit drinks they make.  Oh . . . my god.  Lovin' it!  I mean, how can you not love a fresh fruit drink that you can walk around and sip and then chew the tapioca pearls as you slurp them up with a big straw? Maybe it's an acquired taste, but try it.  You might just shout \"Yes, yes, yes!\"  as much as I do.", "author": "Shadi G."}

Mid-range price for a Chinese lunch - but it has a sense of authenticity to Hong Kong. Personally cantonese isn't my favorite genre of Chinese, but it does the trick for me at lunch. Personally enjoyed the roast pork wonton noodle soup & the he fun (broad noodles). Portions are large (perhaps not for the wonton noodle soup), so we shared 2 dishes between three people.

Though the selection is pretty much the same as any other Chinese restaurant, the quality to me, is better than the rest.  Big thumbs up for having the rare deep fried bread sticks for eating with \"jook\" with noodles wrapped around.

Top-up if you like a cold drink. It cost $4.75 before tax. We ordered 3 different sets; the century egg porridge, fried chicken wing and Curry fishball. It is just like those you get in HK. The porridge was tasty but not as smooth. Curry fishball was not very spicy. I like the yummy fried chicken wing which is so far better than those other HK cafe I have tried in USA. Overall for that price, it is good value and close to what you get in HK. I hope to come back to try other dishes.", "author": "S H."}
