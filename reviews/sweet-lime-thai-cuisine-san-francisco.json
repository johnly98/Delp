The restaurant is small, but I've never had a problem being seated immediately. They also have allowed us to sit when we are still waiting for a few people, which is really nice. The ambience is pleasant and calming, and the restaurant is quiet. \n\nThe food is very good- the Panang curry is flavored well, although the fact that they can't give it to you without pork is really disappointing. The pork itself is tough, chewy, and flavorless, and I would recommend eating around the pork if you get this dish. The fresh rolls are good, and so is the chicken satay. The pad kee mao is very good- full of crunchy fresh veggies (although not a lot of noodles as a result of this). \n\nService is not the best, both times one individual has had to wait for their meal long after the rest have been brought out. It would be better to bring them all out at once, or warn us if it's going to be a time consuming dish to prepare. Although, on one occasion, it was the same dish I had ordered and my friend didn't get hers until over 20 minutes later. \n\nOverall, decent Thai food, shoddy service, but still a solid option if you're in the area.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

My umbrella had two of its spikes broken by aggressive gusts of wind, so I was already in a foul mood when I was getting drenched by a torrential downpour. So when I entered to grab a late dinner here, all I wanted was a little table where I could throw down my sorry excuse for an umbrella and have something comforting to eat. Fortunately there was a table open in a blind corner of the restaurant where I was certain I would be ignored. To the staff's credit, I wasn't. It must have been the inclement weather that led my desire to order some soup.\n\nThe $13 Tom Kha with Chicken satisfied that need for the most part as it was a warm broth of coconut milk, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2ryJETB). The poultry was present and accounted for, but it was missing any seasoning or spicy kick that would have made it truly memorable. I needed something to chew on, so I ordered the $9 Fresh Roll which added avocado to the standard lettuce, mint, carrot, and cucumber in the rice paper wrapper and peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2KTIiuS). Good and the avocado was a nice touch, but hell, it was time to reassemble my umbrella for that long, wet walk home.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good but not exceptional Thai fare\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious with big pictures of limes (photo: http://bit.ly/2Kce84M)\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...smiles\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not my favorite Thai place in town, wet or dry", "author": "Ed U."}

I have tried so many different Thai restaurants in the city (and around the world) - I've even been to Bangkok a few times and a witness to how delicious authentic Thai food can be - but I still got impressed by this dish by Sweet Lime. It was well-seasoned, could taste that charred noodles and while the portion may not be as big as other places - I was still full after I finished it.\n\nOne word of advice if you decided to come here : ask for the spice rack! One of the ladies there (whom I presume is the owner) told me to try the middle jar which has the fresh watery chili sauce. It was so tasty!!! It is hot - so watch out. But OMG I loved it! It was a little sour and tasted so fresh. I even asked her to start selling it in jars to take home - COZ I WANNA BUY SOME! :D She said she's working on it but doesn't know how to make it without preservatives coz they don't put preservatives in any of their stuff.

My eggplant was cooked perfectly-not over cooked and mushy like most places\n\n3) papaya salad: this was a little on the sweet side, needed more lime to it. We didn't know if they had a \"spicy level scale\" when ordering but we asked for this to be really spicy-9 out of 10. It came out not having any kick at all.

The quality of all their dishes for the price makes this place a great value. When you walk in its a cozy place and the staff are very welcoming. My go to starter is the chicken satay, always well cooked and not too dry. The tiny side of cucumber salad that comes with it is refreshing and the peanut dipping sauce is excellent. I typically always get the pad si-ew, the flat noodles with veg and beef. The dish well seasoned, not too salty and just the right amount of sweetness. I prefer red curries but tried my friend's green curry which was surprisingly good. It was rich with flavor and subtle hint of heat from the jalapeno. The sticky rice with mango is my default dessert but tried the fired banana with coconut ice cream which was also very good. The banana is wrapped and fried which gives it a nice crunchy shell and pairs really well with the coconut ice cream. This place never disappoints and for how reasonable the prices are for their dishes, you'll gladly come back or at the very least order to take out.", "author": "Peter P."}

But overall, Sweet Lime is a solid option for Thai if you happen to be in the area.\n\nLet's start off with the good. We ordered duck rolls, fresh rolls, vegetarian pineapple fried rice, and the panang curry. Taste-wise, I enjoyed everything but the panang curry was seriously outstanding. It was flavorful and rich, with that perfect blend of sweet and savory. Panang is already milder than most other Thai curries but the one here is really not spicy by my standards (and I have a pretty low tolerance for spice). So take that as you will. I'm also a fan of the fusion-y duck rolls because I love duck so much, but the fresh rolls were almost as good (and definitely a healthier option). The pineapple fried rice was also yummy and we appreciated the sweetness of the raisins complementing the fragrant spices and nutty cashews. Yum yum yum!\n\nBut now for the bad. One of our duck rolls had no duck in it! And we also didn't get any utensils or napkins with our order (not a big deal, but pretty weird and apparently we aren't the only Yelpers who experienced that). We thought the portions for the fried rice were small for the price--but I get it, it's lower Pac Heights. Surprisingly, unlike most other Thai restaurants, Sweet Lime is unable to make some of their curry dishes vegetarian or make meat substitutes (for example I like duck Penang curry but theirs is pork and no subs were allowed). \n\n3 stars is really too low for a restaurant that makes such delicious Penang curry but Yelp doesn't allow half stars :(", "author": "Tiffany H."}

It wasn't spicy and the duck was a little fatty but I liked it. If you want spicy, you may have to ask them to spice it up.\n\nWe tried the special, prawns in red curry, and got about 6 prawns. It was really good, but it wasn't enough for two people. Then we ordered the yellow curry lamb which was AMAZING! The meat was so tender and the sauce was really flavorful.\n\nIf I am in the area I'd come back but it is a bit out of the way for me. It's also a little on the pricey side - over $20 each.

We stepped into the relatively empty, hollister-dark Sweet Lime and decided to stay.\n\nThe mango salad was comprised of shredded, ripe (I clarify ripe because of the Vietnamese green papaya salads) mangoes in a fish sauce dressing with cashews, mint and grilled shrimp. The dressing is reminiscent of the sweet/salty clear sauce used for Vietnamese bunh (cold noodle salad with thin rice noodles, protein and pickled veg); with the mango, the overall sweetness was a bit too intense for me, and I couldn't help but wish there was some lettuce to break it up. The shrimp were grilled instead of coated in coconut and fried until GBD like I thought they would be, and though they were smoky and tender, they weren't what I wanted. This tiny pile of mango, too much dressing and two shrimp was $9, and I wasn't feeling very happy with myself for choosing this dish.\n\nMy friend picked the massaman curry, filled with beef, potatoes, pineapple, peanuts and pineapple. The pineapple was kind of random and I didn't remember seeing it on the description, though I've realized that I don't mind if pineapple shows up where it probably shouldn't. The beef was really tender and hinted that it was cooked nice and slow. The peanuts were soft, and I wished that they had been toasted and added just before serving so that they could retain some crunch. The curry was creamy and coconutty, and all three of us were spooning it onto rice sans solid fillings/toppings by the end of lunch.\n\nThe pad Thai was delicious. I haven't had a good one in a while, so maybe that's why this one was so satisfying. I thought the noodles were wrong (they seemed too skinny), but this didn't affect the flavor or texture of the dish. I liked the bits of crispy fried egg and the crunchy peanuts against the chewy noodles. The chicken was overdone, but what else is new in pad Thai land?", "author": "Heather F."}

First they were about to seat me when I walk in but then they saw two ppl walking in, so they let them sit at the table first and told me to wait for another one was about to leave. It was ok since that table is big. After 5-10 min wait, another group of three ppl walk in. So a lady came up and told them would give them the table I was waiting. I was shocked. And then her colleagues told her I was waiting for that table. So she pull out a little table right next to the entrance and told me to sit there. When I told her I was waiting for the other table. She said\" this is the only table available because you are only one person.\n\nFirst, why didn't they pull out that table earlier if that's the only table for one person.\nSecond, that was the second time they see more ppl more money, so they make me wait or sit me somewhere else. In this case, I don't think they want my business because I'm only by myself.\nThe last major thing is she didn't even try to talk nice or apologize or even trying to be nice about it, but giving me an attitude.\n\nNot a good way to end my day after a long day work", "author": "wing c."}

Not only do they just have your standard pads and curries (even though they have those) they also have lots of stir fries, appetizers, and entrees. Almost anything that has regular meat in it can be made vegetarian with the substitute of tofu or braised gluten they offer (AWESOME FOR VEGETARIANS!) Their tofu was super firm and well marinated, seriously, tofu lover's HEAVEN. They also have a Vegan Crispy Roll with Taro root for you to try! \n- Service is wonderful. Our waiter was extremely attentive and courteous and the owner even came to talk to me and my BF for almost 10 minutes after we sat down. She chatted with us about the Jazz Festival that day and the surrounding area, super sweet lady!\n- Food is well plated, fresh, and delicious! I got the fresh roll to share with the boy and  the mint leaves in it complimented it super well. Their peanut sauce was different than the normal ones you usually encounter but was still so good. I got the Samm Kasat which was a spicy green pepper stir fry with eggplant, bell peppers, and tofu. I asked for medium spicy and it was EXACTLY that. It was really delicious (I'm pretty sure I don't have to rave about the AMAZING tofu again). I also ordered a Thai coffee which was not too bad but nothing too special or amazing.\n-Spiciness. Unlike most Thai places that usually don't take you seriously when you ask for your food spicy, this place will do exactly what you want. I've felt that when I ask for my dish to be spicy at most Thai restaurants they usually ignore me because they don't think I can handle it. Well this place, definitely honors your request. A HUGE plus!\n\nCONS: \n- PORTION SIZE. My dish was TINY. It was a tiny plate of stir fry that cost me $13 without rice while my bf's standard dish of pad thai which was almost 2x bigger cost $9. What?! How does this make any sense. My friend ordered a salmond dish and it was MINISCULE and cost her over $10. Ridiculous, portion sizes are no bueno here. \n- Small restaurant. If you're coming in a large group, definitely make reservations! This isn't that big of a con but just a warning that this place DOES get crowded FAST.\n- Salty as the DEAD SEA. Even though my Samm Kasat was pretty tasty, I could have done with about HALF the amount of salt in this dish. It was sooooooo salty I felt like I had just gone swimming in the Dead Sea and swallowed a gulp full of water. \n- Limited alcohol selection. I feel that most of the Thai restaurants I've gone to in the area usually have a pretty wide selection of alcoholc drinks for me to choose from. From a lychee martini just to a variety of unique beers. While this place has your standard Singha beer and a couple of wines, that's it! I'd like to go to a place where I can get a yummy mojito to pair with my meal.\n\nConclusion, food is pretty darn good but definitely NOT worth the price. The portions are ridiculously small and I really honestly think you can find something that tastes just as good and get a better bang for your buck somewhere else. True, it's probably one of the better Thai places in Pac Heights (definitely a million times better than Thai Stick) but not really worth the money. I'll probably find myself coming here once in a while if I'm in the area, craving Thai food, and don't want to travel too far. Otherwise, I think I'll try to find somewhere else that will give me more bang for my buck.", "author": "Vicki L."}

Unfortunately, we're going to have to keep looking. \n\nWhen we got there for dinner, there was only one other table in there finishing up. We ordered curry puffs & two entrees w/ white rice. Curry puffs came out & they were pretty good. You could tell they weren't previously frozen. Feeling optimistic! \n\nThen our entrees came out. I ordered a green curry & the boyfriend ordered some other similar entree. They bring out our entrees then tell us they're out of white rice. Keep in mind that we were the only table there at this point so it's not like they were so busy they served the last portion to another table and didn't have time to tell us. First, how does a Thai restaurant run out of white rice?? Second, why didn't you tell us either when we ordered, when our appetizers came out, or the ten minutes between finishing our appetizers and waiting for our entrees? They offered brown rice but I hate brown rice so I said no thanks. Then they offered sticky rice and we reluctantly agreed. So as our two entrees are sitting on our table getting cold, they go on to make the sticky rice. 10 minutes later and we get some subpar rice to go with the dry, way overcooked meat in the curry. \n\nI was less than pleased.

Well, less than a week after I found Neecha it was closed. I actually think I was the last person to write a review for that place when they were still open. \n\nI finally decided to give this place a try and REALLY liked the food! I got yellow curry for takeout and it was yummy! I feel like yellow is the least popular of the Thai curries, but I've always liked it for some reason. I can't really pinpoint anything that made Sweet Lime's yellow curry standout, but it had good texture, the chicken was tender, and the potatoes & carrots weren't too hard or mushy. I got it with brown rice (which I'll get too). \n\nThe people who work here are really nice and they're quick with orders. I was here less than 10 minutes after I placed my order and shortly after I walked in my food was ready. One woman offered me water while I waited (even though I didn't have much of a wait), which I thought was nice. I was in here for less than five minutes, but it did seem like a nice setup, and I'd come back to dine in. \n\nHere's where the half star issue comes in. When I placed my order over the phone the woman who took it asked me if I wanted rice with my curry. I asked if it came with it (I know this is usually like a 50/50 chance at Thai places, but I kind of get annoyed when places charge extra), and her response was \"no, but it's curry and you HAVE to get rice with it because you can't eat curry without rice.\" When everything is said and done I don't mind paying an extra two bucks for rice (that's what this place charges), but I thought it was a little rude for her to say this. Maybe I misunderstood her tone over the phone, but if the people who worked here weren't so nice in person this would have annoyed me more than it did. Also, I was asked if I wanted steamed rice or brown rice and when I said steamed the woman hesitated, said they were running low on it, and asked if I would mind getting brown. She also said she would only charge me a dollar for it, but when I went to pick it up I was charged two (I wasn't gonna make a big deal over a buck though). Now that I think about it, it's really not so douchey to mark this place down for this, but since the curry was yummy, the people who worked here were nice (face to face at least) I'll just post this review now with four stars while I'm still in a good mood...", "author": "George A."}

Two thumbs up.\n\nGrowing up in Southeast Asia I've spent lots of time in Thailand and have sampled the food from multiple Thai regions. My wife and I love Sweet Lime because the great food reminds us of being back in Thailand. \n\nBut good food is only half of it - Nee the owner provides wonderfully warm and friendly service. Even though it was months between our first and second visit, she remembered us right away and personally served us. In spite of being very hands-on running the restaurant, she somehow finds the time to check in to see how we're doing. \n\nRecommended dishes: \n- Tom yum kung: classic sweet/sour soup with nice balance of lemongrass, ginger and chili flavors. Favorite with seafood\n- Angel wings: succulent, garlicy and lots of spice. Topped with crispy fried basil.\n- Green papaya salad: not for everyone, but authentically sour and crunchy, with delicious bits of garlic and dried shrimp.\n- Mee krob: crispy fried rice noodles with sweet gravy - great combination of crunch and sweetness, nicely offset with a bit of lime acid.\n- Whole fish with chili/garlic sauce: nicely fried with crispy skin contrasted by a deliciously spicy sweet sauce.\n\n\nThe restaurant is also nicely lit, extremely clean and has a relaxing ambiance.

Rice per person was $2 for white or brown.\n\nThe Pad Ma-Khua was a bit too salty for my taste buds and the chicken got a little tough. There were lots of pieces of chicken but I almost wished for more eggplant instead.\n\nThe Pad Si-ew on the other hand was delicious. We couldn't get enough of the soft chewy noodles, the vegetable mix of cabbage, carrots, broccoli and tomato slices. The veggies added a subtle sweetness. There could have been more tofu and would have preferred the fried kind but the fact that we were fighting for the last bites was a good sign.\n\nWe didn't have stomach space for the Mango Sticky Rice that I saw on the menu.

I have been eating here since 1991 when it was called Neecha Thai.  At that time, the owner was herself vegetarian so I trusted that there was no fish sauce or chicken stock in anything I ate.  About four years ago, ownership changed yet I was assured that everything I was eating was free of fish sauce and chicken stock.  They even have tofu and seitan (fake meat) options.  And most of their items have a star which indicates the dish can be made vegan.  Sadly, I learned last night that this is not true.  In fact, the server outright said I had been lied to.  This is because ALL of their sauces contain fish sauce and their soups contain chicken stock.  And, apparently all but a few of their dishes contain sauce and cannot be altered.

Sweet lime not only matches up, it exceeded several of the restaurants I dined at while in Thailand.\n\nYou can't rate a restaurant without starting with the people that make a great dining experience possible. The staff at Sweet Lime are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. You feel the warmth from everyone as soon as you walk in the doors. if you want to feel some good energy, I would encourage you to walk into Sweet Lime just to see the smiles. \n\nThe Food: We started with the chicken satay and Fresh roll, followed by the Panang Curry and Pad Kra-Prow (from the wok) with beef with brown rice for two. They are not kidding when the say Fresh roll. The vegetables were as fresh as they get. I usually opt for chicken Panang but was told that it is just pork. As pork goes, sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's really bad so I was a little reluctant but we went with it. The pork was AMAZING!!! This stuff melts in your mouth. The Panang sauce was delicious. \n\nThe Pad Kra-Prow was PHENOMENAL. The green beans that accompany the beef were cooked perfectly, with a nice fresh crunch which complimented the soft texture of the beef very well. The beef melts in your mouth as well. \n\nI have lived in SF for 10 years and maybe I am just lazy but this is my first review.

When the mango sticky rice was ready, they just handed us the box with no napkins or utensils. When we opened it, the rice to mango ratio was askew and the rice was not even traditional sticky rice. Instead, it was black glutinous rice with very little condense milk plopped on top. My first expierence of mango sticky rice was ruined thanks to those two ladies who gave such horrible service. I'm never going to that place again! The only reason why I gave 1 star is because they wouldn't let me post this with 0 stars.", "author": "stacey a."}

It was a cold and rainy night, and there's nothing like some good Thai food to warm you up. Started with miang kham, fresh spinach leaves that you put tidbits of onions, dried shrimps, peanuts, peppers and finished off with a ginger tamarind(?) sauce. Very yummy! The sauce was wonderful, sweet and tangy.  Also had some Thai egg rolls, fresh and fried spring rolls. All tasted good.  We then had the papaya salad and the avocado salad. Again, very yummy! Great flavor combination. Very good balance of sweet, sour and salty. The papaya salad is a little spicy, but could use slightly more.  Salads was followed by soups: tom ka and tom yum.  I had a bowl of the tom yum and it was delicious. Again, perfect balance of flavors; however, I had a sip of the tom ka and it was too sweet for me, didn't like it too much. My friends added some chili sauce and it helped balance the sweetness.  For our main dishes, we had choo chee salmon, green curry with beef, vegetarian pad Thai, and pad kee mow.  Both the pad Thai and pad kee mow tasted good. The choo chee salmon was great, slightly rich red curry sauce, and the salmon was cooked perfectly and stood up to the rich sauce!  The green curry was excellent, perfect for a rainy day. For dessert, we had the fried banana, which was ok, and the trio sorbet: coconut, mango and blood orange.  I liked the coconut and mango, very light and  refreshing and great pallet cleanser; but the blood orange, although very fragrant, was a little too bitter for me, overall a good way to end the meal.\n\nOverall, the food was excellent; well balanced flavors.  I talked to the owner, Nee ( not elbow - LOL), and she told me she roasts all the chili herself, all her condiments are made in-house, not bought; also, she tries and buy her herbs and vegetables locally, via the farmers market.  You can tell she cares about the quality of what she serves.  And speaking of \"serves\", Service was good, very friendly. I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Jean D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-01-25", "description": "I wish I could give either no stars or minus stars!!!  First off, I want to start by saying that I use to order from this restaurant very frequently.  Since I work at 2 local hospitals, one can imagine just how many times a week that we order out between both facilities.  I went online to place an order last night when I realized that they changed and now use either EAT24 or Grubhub for delivery services ( you can not call the restaurant directly anymore like before ).  So, I chose EAT24.  However, this review has nothing to do with them ( they were actually the only ones who were apologetic, helpful and attentive to my problems / issues ).  The first issue was with the pad thai.  I had originally marked mild on the online order but then called directly back to the restaurant to see if they could make it medium.  So, when my co-worker tasted the food it it was so unbelievably spicy that he couldn't even eat it ( no exaggeration and also told me because he is from Thailand originally he can tolerate spicy fairly well but that this was just out of the park unbearable! )  After taking just one bite, he then began coughing, terrible watery eyes and couldn't even speak!  He had also ordered the thai ice drink and literally downed it within seconds but continued to suffer for a good 10 mins or more afterwards.  For the most part bay area local Thai restaurants usually are have 3 levels of spicy - mild, medium and thai hot/spicy.  SOOOOO, I then now had to make a second call to let EAT24 regarding that which will forever be known as \" broccoli gate \".  When I called the second time the gal from EAT24 informed me that she has to wait for the manager of the restaurant ( who may be in around 9 - 9:30 p.m. or later that evening ) to see what could be done.  I personally typed in the instruction box that **  NO BROCCOLI ON, IN OR AROUND THE PAD SI-EW ( IF YOUR NOT GOING TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TYPED IN, THEN WHY GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS BEING PAID ATTENTION AND ADHERED TOO  ). Well, guess what they put broccoli in the entree and the person that ordered that item took one whiff and though new right away what had happened because broccoli makes her vomit and nauseous.  The restaurant told us to just pick out the broccoli ( I mean according to them, it wasn't really such a big deal to start with and with a very simple solution but yet no solution for the overly hot and of course inedible pad thai ).  Unfortunately by then the smell and overall taste had permeated the entire dish and it was inedible for her.  The gal @ EAT24 said she would probably email with the restaurant response since it was late in the evening.  I checked this morning my email for a response from EAT24.  There was no such email so I decided to give them a call. The gentleman from EAT24 that I spoke with read me the notes on the account.  He said that this restaurant refuses to take any responsibility for their mistakes ( even a credit perhaps or even another delivery of the right food order, etc. )  That would have been the right response to these problems in order to end these issues.  So, I not only wasted $30.00 ( which I think that this restaurant is really, really, really overpriced and over inflated considering incorrect orders, small portions, etc ).  So, my co-workers I am sure will be truly disappointed but I refuse to give them anymore of my business.  Obviously customer service is not a notion that they obviously understand nor will ever deliver.  Their food is mediocre at best and certainly not worth my time or my effort!  For a place of business that does not stand by their mistakes and want to right the wrong it is not a place that I want my hard earned dollars to go to or for people like that to profit!!!", "author": "COLLEEN C."}

All  of us have eaten here before with each other, or small groups of 2 or 4.  The table was laid out nicely for us but the prior arrangements for the time and details of their $15.00 corkage fee left us having second thoughts about having a party here. They kept wanting us to order family style, so it would be less work for the kitchen, and I told them that is not possible because some of us can't tolerate peanuts, curry or coconut.  They wanted us to pre-order before the party but their menu is not online, you have to download an app.  The upshot is management didn't want our large party, which ended up in a nice hefty bill for alcohol and food.

The Pad Thai and the Pad See Eu, for instance, usually boring and formulaic elsewhere, here taste bright, fresh. The restaurant offers 3 different house-made fresh chili sauces offered to go with the dishes, depending on one's proclivity and/or tolerance to spice.  There is a feeling which permeates this place that a whole lot of love and care went into everything served here, including the wine program, which is also stellar--the offerings are not the typical, run-of-the-mill cheapo wines usually found in Asian restaurants, but rather, some expertise was imparted in the way the list was conceptualized.

From the Chef's Favorites, the Makhur Song Krueng was a whole small peeled eggplant stuffed with bits of chicken and shrimp with a mild tamarind sauce, very savory; Sweet and Sour Roasted Duck included a lot of delicious pieces of duck with lots of fresh ginger and some spinach.  Pad (that is, \"stir-fried\") Broccoli was a nice surprise when it included green broccoli, white cauliflower, and purple broccoli with shiitake mushrooms in a light sauce.  Each dish had a different flavor, but all the sauces were greaseless and light enough to feature the meats and vegetables (which were not overcooked).  Everything made a great family-style meal to share.\n\nService was very attentive and intelligent.  The management welcomes your own wine for corkage service, a most-appreciated policy which helps any restaurant to fit a wider variety of occasions and customers.\n\nNeecha's many frequent customers from the neighborhood should definitely give Sweet Lime a try.

Was really excited about a new Thai place on the corner across from where I live, but won't be ordering from here again.  The pad thai tastes a little sour and the tofu in there tastes very fishy.  The yellow curry was good.  The thai iced coffee was a little bitter and with crushed ice, so it's just gets watered down.  One plus was the yellow curry, it has a good flavor, but some of the chicken in it was gray....how does chicken get gray?  That's not good.  Also, service was great.  No issues there.  I did get the food to go but there were quite a few people there and they seemed pretty attentive.", "author": "Prakash R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-06", "description": "Similar to another reviewer less than a month ago, I also experience very rude service from the male server (and really little better from the woman).  The food is ok but very overpriced (even for the slightly cheaper lunch menu).  I have definitely had better with MUCH better service.  I did come in towards the end of the lunch service, but two other tables came AFTER me and seemed to receive much better service (although their server was the woman).  Not only did he not explain any of the specials (or really anything at all) but he just plopped down the stack of menus took some forks off the table and walked away.  Then, after I ordered, when I overheard the woman actually explaining the specials to a different table, I explained that had I known the $3 special came with an appetizer and a salad I would have ordered that and not the $2.50 salad only add-on.  She informed me, \"oh well, maybe next time.\"  Oh no, there will be no next time.  I already knew the $2.50 was waaay too much for that poor excuse of a salad but I was willing to pay it so that I could have something leafy green.  Really? $2.50 for a handful of mixed lettuce (not baby greens either) a drizzle of balsamic and some little rice noodles on top, I think not.  Suffice it to say the experience not only ruined my meal but also my afternoon.  Now I must fill my belly with a delicious caffeinated beverage to soothe my soul.  Thanks but no thanks, Sweet Lime Thai.", "author": "Lauren G."}

The shrimp were served raw and were so fresh and tasty with the colorful presentation I wish I could post the picture..it was delicious-I later found out that the owner went to the market earlier that day shopping for fish..then the spring rolls and peanut dipping sauce with a generous portion of perfectly ripe avocado were a soothing break before we had one of the best pad thai's I've had this side of Bangkok.

Considering this is a new place to the neighborhood we were very excited to try it out in the hopes of supporting the restaurant on a regular basis.  We called in a dinner order for pick up, chicken pad thai and chicken in red curry.  When we asked what is served with the curry, they commented nothing, just the curry.  WTF?  No rice?  Oh yes, you can order rice, but it doesn't come with it.  How can a curry dish not be served with rice?  I shared with the server that they should consider adding rice to curry dishes as it seems odd to not have anything else with it.  Last I checked, curry is not a soup.  Okay, whatever.  So I picked up the food and was optimistic about possibly finding a new Thai restaurant to frequent.  Upon opening the bag of food, I was immediately disappointed by the food.  The red curry dish looked as if it had been filled and then emptied out, almost as if too much had originally been placed in the container.   Lots of sauce, which was sweeter than other red curries I am use to and had little chicken and veggies.   The box of rice was the smallest I had ever seen and somewhat of a joke.  Last I checked, rice is cheap, why be so stingy?  Next, the pad thai that I was so looking forward to and unfortunately, deeply disappointed.  The dish was very oily, no nice browning on the noodles and for some reason all of the noodles stuck together.  Lots of chicken in the pad thai which was nice, but very little as far as bean sprouts, green onions, etc.  All and all, we were both very disappointed and won't be running back anytime soon.  This is so unfortunate since this is new to the neighborhood.  Maybe the breakfast/lunch place across from Sweet Lime will be better and one that we will support.", "author": "Runner G."}

When Sweet Lime took over, we gave it a few months to shake out the kinks.  Last night we went there for dinner.  What an improvement!  Not only does the place look a lot better, but the food blows the socks off of anything Neecha ever produced.  We had a couple of starters, the miang kham which you have to experience for yourself, and spring rolls that were a lot thinner and better than any others I've had.  Really good. We then went on to the red curry with duck and pineapple (hot and very tasty), the pad pak ruam mit with shrimp (another good one) and the pad prick sod (I'm not making that up) with chicken.  All the dishes were very flavorful and beautifully presented.  As it was our daughter's birthday, we ordered dessert .  We all had something different and they were all terrific.

Both I & my friends were very impressed and satisfied with this restaurant. We started with a couple appetizers.  The first appetizer was a fresh roll with avocado and peanut source.  It is very good especially the peanut source taste authentic just like when I had it in Thailand.  The second appetizer was 'Kra Thong Tong' with crispy golden cup and curry puff.  I love this because it is very fresh and crisp.  It made me wonder where they get it from, when asked we found out that the owner makes this herself!  The Pad Thai is great, it is not dry and saucy.  My most favorite dish is Mussaman curry beef.  It comes with beef tenderloin just like how they serve it in Thailand.  The taste is exactly the same.  It is very authentic.  I have been to many Thai restaurants in Oregon and California, and Sweet Lime by far has the best Mussaman curry in the United States.  The beef tenderloin is so tender.  We didn't even need a knife to cut it.  You must try this one!  I will definitely order this curry again while I am visiting next time!", "author": "Chian R."}

We ended with the sticky rice and mango dessert that was a light and yummy ending to the meal.
