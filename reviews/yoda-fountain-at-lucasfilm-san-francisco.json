The real secret hidden gem(s) of LucasArts & ILM were over the Golden Gate Bridge in the North Bay.  There are more sightings of George Lucas in Marin County than actually in the city.  We ran into him at Northgate Mall; my daughter took a picture with him - nbd!

He enjoys posing and standing next to a storm trooper or posing with any of the statues inside.  The staff are super friendly, parking is limited on their property.  It's something to check off your bucket list.  The hype is all about the Yoda Fountain, but don't set your expectations too high.

Yoda sits on a fountain at Lucasfilm in one of the most beautiful and valuable real estate in San Francisco, The Presidio! It is just outside of the Letterman Digital Arts Center.\n\nWe asked the gate attendant at the guard shack where we could find the Yoda fountain and he directed us to the building. Once inside the gate we headed to our left and the fountain was right in front of us at the Building B courtyard outdoor patio. It's free to visit Yoda. This life-size statue sits on top of a fountain while water flows from beneath. We came on a Saturday afternoon so the lobby was closed. Boo! The lobby is open to the public during weekday regular business hours. If the Star Wars Industrial Light & Magic [ILM] offices were open in the weekends, we would've been able to view more statues -- Darth Vader, Boba Fett, etc. in the lobby. \n\nFor now we were just happy to see the Yoda fountain since the statue has become a tourist landmark! It was a short visit. Yoda is small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years... feel the force!\n\nReview #0977", "author": "May A."}

Never before or since have I witnessed an audience of critics rise as one in thunderous ovation when the faces of Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy faded to credits.  Adults with tears in their eyes all around me.\n\nMany millions -- including me since -- have internalized that moment one way or another -- and this Yoda fountain at Lucasfilm is a fitting tribute to that feeling -- now more than 40 years later.\n\nWe came on a Saturday when access to the building was not available -- but the gardens -- the statuary -- and the views we were able to see are spectacular.\n\nYoda's simple wisdom -- \"do or do not -- there is no try\" has rattled around in my head since 1977 -- alongside other disparate celluloid snippets (Forrest Gumpisms come to mind).\n\nI can't say that later reincarnations of this storyline have held my interest in the same way or degree -- but if it moves you at all -- go to this place when in the Presidio area.  \n\nNot sure what kind of force you will find here -- maybe just nostalgia -- but it is sacred ground for fans -- and that's good enough for me.", "author": "Yuri Y."}

Hate leads to suffering.\" \n\nThe Yoda Fountain is a pilgrimage for all Star Wars fanatics. It's almost like going to the Sistine Chapel, Jerusalem, Mecca, or sipping holy tea with the great Dalai Lama. Ok, ok maybe not as spiritual as those examples, but a tad important nonetheless. Well, at least to all you Jedi wannabes! \n\n\"Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.\" -Yoda\n\nYoda has been part of me since I was a very young Padawan. I watched all the original movies countless of times as a youngster, in fact, I still have all 48 of my Star Wars action-figures! I no longer play with them, silly, but it's on display at my home on Tatooine. And no one's allowed to see it unless you swear allegiance to the Rebel Alliance;)\n\n\"You must unlearn what you have unlearned.\" -Yoda\n\nYoda is one Fly... green guy! The Yoda Fountain is a working fountain found at the entrance of LucasFilm Ltd. on the historic Presidio. The bronze statue is only slightly over two-feet-tall, basically life-size, but Yoda stands on a seven-feet-tall pillar. So no doubt he'll tower over you. Immortalized to look like the aged 900-year-old version of the wise little shaman as he appeared in the original Star Wars trilogy - wisdom wrinkles and all! He's one handsome Sensei! :D A little known tradition is to toss coins into the water and make a wish. Preferably a thoughtful wish, Yoda has great patience, but little time for buffoons, or creeps that look like Gollum, or Mr. Farley. I mean c'mon now;) \n\n\"To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle or the night.\" -Yoda\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend visiting the Yoda Fountain for Star Wars fanatics, casual Jedi wannabes, movie buffs, or anyone who wants to meet the Grand Master of the Jedi Order! The kids will love him, and grandma might even fall in love;) \nAnd maybe the greatest part of this pilgrimage is Yoda's not found in a Galaxy far, far away... but here he stands humbly atop a pillar... waiting to share his great wisdom with you. As someone wise once told me... \"There is no trying to fall in love with this Yoda fountain, you just do, or do not. There is no try.\" \n\nAnd... \n\n\"May the Force be with you... always.\" Amen.", "author": "Eric R."}

We were driving through the Presidio when I remembered the Yoda Fountain was somewhere around there. Luckily it was right around the corner from us! Thank goodness for cell phones and quick thinking.\n\nWe pulled over into one of the lots and took a short walk over to the fountain. It was great since we were with kids and they could run around on the grass and pathways. The Yoda Fountain is small but lit up and if you are a Star Wars fan, it is really quite epic!\n\nOur visit was like experiencing a little museum since the open lobby is filled with all sorts of memorabilia, life size character models, costumes, and awards. We took our time to go through everything and really admire the details. It's a working lobby for the employees and company so be respectful and keep your voices down. I did my best not to be embarrassing while I geeked out. The Yoda Fountain is well worth the detour. Reserve at least 30 minutes of your time for it if you are including the lobby tour and rubber necking all the cool office windows. Love a creative space!

The last time we went to see it was at night and they have security guard stations making sure you don't park near the building to rob them. We had someone drop us off and we ran to the fountain like 007 spies got our photos and ran off. My second experience here was completely different during the day- if you walk up to the fountain and really stare into the eyes of Yoda you will feel your soul get deeper. As a pro tip- the nearby Lucas films studio has a lobby area that you can walk into that has Darth Vader and others on display for your viewing pleasure.", "author": "Erica H."}

It was fun to see the \"Lucas Arts\" sign on the wall as well. \n\nThe grounds are gorgeous with a neat view of the Palace of Fine Arts. There is a Starbucks located in the court yard area of the complex and is open during the week. \n\nIt was amusing to see all of the action figures and other \"geek toys\" resting in the windows and on the desks of the offices. \n\nThere are no formal tours and the place isn't real public friendly but if you are an avid fan of Star Wars or other George Lucas films, then you will appreciate just walking the grounds and being close to where it all happens.", "author": "Jules P."}
