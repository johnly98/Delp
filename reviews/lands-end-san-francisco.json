Hiking trails like Lands End are great for moments of solitude to ponder upon many thIngs...Like are the things you're doing, or what you place a high value on, really important in the grand scheme of life?  Or are they just self-imposed societal norms? Well, you can ruminate on this and on where to get some good Asian food on nearby Clement Street afterwards.\n\nViews! Some of the very best to be had in San Francisco.  The best thing is that you won't even feel as if you're actually in any city on parts of the trail, my favorite part.   It's  a little path into the beautiful nature that San Francisco has to offer - impressive views of the Golden Gate Bridge (fog typically included), and stunning ocean views! Keep in mind that along the way, there are a good number of fairly steep stairs. I didn't mind going up them, but not so much of a fan of coming down.\n\nTourists and Locals:  Remember again, to take caution wherever you park in San Francisco because there has been an epidemic of car break-ins all over the City.  If you don't believe me, just Google it.  It happened to us not long ago by the AMC Theater on busy Van Ness. The nearby Legion of Honor has started handing out professionally made cards warning of it to all their visitors. They didn't spend money printing those nice precautionary cards for the fun of it!\n\nThis is one of my favorite little hideaways in San Francisco.

It's a relatively easy walk but if you get far enough, you'll encounter MANY MANY MANY stairs. So if you're with someone who might have trouble going through all that, maybe don't walk the entire length. Most people walking this trail had comfortable shoes on though we did spot a few daredevils working it in heels so I guess it's doable! My friend and I also saw the labyrinth by accident when we went off the main trail to one of the side ones - so try to make some side journeys and enjoy all the surprises that come your way. \n\nThis trail is probably one of my favorites because it offers such a stunning view of the golden gate bridge as well as a consistent close-up of the ocean.

I mean c'mon now...\n\n\"Who can say where the road goes\nWhere the day flows, only time\nAnd who can say if your love grows\nAs your heart chose, only time...\"\n\nAnd there's a place in San Francisco that I can listen & hum all the Enya I want! Lands End is a special place, that many sometimes overlook, a place you can find solitude and peace in a busy day, and sometimes a crazy metropolitan city. I've been here before, but had to rediscover the beauty of it.\n\nLands End is pretty much a hiking trail that is located in a huge city. A hiking trail that leads to other hiking trails. There's really no \"End\" in site if you keep on going. Along the way take in the stunning sights of the Pacific, the North Coast, and of course the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. \n\n\"Who can say why your heart sighs\nAs your love flies, only time\nAnd who can say why your heart cries\nWhen your love lies, only time...\"\n\nI highly recommend Lands End. There's several starting points, so I won't confuse you, but I started from the Cliff House side and followed the signs after the Sutro Baths. Of course since it's part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Parks it's free to the public - no one can beat FREE! You'll see signs explaining how Lands End was once home to the Yelamu Ohlone tribe who thrived here well before Spanish settlement began in 1776. A century later Adolf Sutro built the rails for the passenger steam train. Today, if you're lucky you can see coastal wildlife, or luckier witness the whales that sometimes enter the Bay. Walk the Labyrinth, too! \n\nIn the end, it's a place for all to enjoy. Go solo or with the family. A place for casual hikers to the more experienced to enjoy! It's really up to you on difficulty level. You can turn around after the first lookout point of Golden Gate Bridge, or simply go on and on the trail that leads to other trails. Alas, so maybe I can't live happily ever after necking Enya in her medieval castle on the rolling hills of Ireland, but it's a'right I can always find inner peace, or as I say \"my inner Enya\";), at wonderful Lands End.

I made my way down to Sutro Baths and enjoyed the views of the Pacific Ocean. I then hiked the Coastal Trail. The trail is 1.7 miles in length and the level of difficulty isn't bad, but I didn't care for the stairs. I was hoping to see the labyrinth, to no avail. When I got to the end of the trail, I didn't want to walk all the way back, but I was still determined to find the labyrinth. I requested an Uber and had the driver drop me off at the Legion of Honor (1 min ride). That may seem silly, but I wanted to give my blistered foot (I wore the wrong kind of shoes) a break and skip over the set of stairs. \n\nAfter he dropped me off, I couldn't find the entrance to the trail. I wandered around a golf course for a while feeling ridiculously lost. I just hoped I wouldn't get hit by golf balls like flying poke balls. I was thinking of requesting another Uber to take me back to my car when I finally found a different trail to Lands End. While walking, I saw a sign for a set of stairs pointing toward Mile Rock Beach. I started walking down the stairs when I came across a pair of hikers and asked if the labyrinth was there. They said no, so I gave up on the labyrinth and went back up the stairs. Walking back, I came across the USS San Francisco Memorial (which had its own parking lot) and went down the stairs onto the main trail.

It is a lovely trail and a great serene spot to take in nature in the busy metropolis of SF. I think it's dog friendly too (at least people bring their dogs here anyway). No this isn't a true \"hike\" if you consider hikes to be something that requires hiking boots, a walking stick, snacks and a hydration backpack. It is quite casual and is something you can definitely do in jeans and flats. \n\nThis is truly one of my favorite spots in the city if not THE favorite spot. I have such a strong affinity for both city life and for nature so places like Lands End are great compromises of both components. My memories here linger with me when I am in Denver and am missing home.

The trail was a great little hike, parts can be strenuous, especially if you choose to go down to the shore. Good shoes are recommended, not flip flops or slip-on boots.

This is a great park with a scenic trail, beach, labyrinth, and the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge. We started out at Ocean Beach, walking up the hill towards Lands End Lookout. From here, we started our nice hike/walk along the coastline from the Lookout (over the Sutra Baths) towards Eagle's Point/the Presidio. Even on a foggy, cold day, it was beautiful and so San Francisco. The trees are flat-top and so unique and beautiful against the SF sunset. There's always tons of people out walking, running, strolling, on dates, etc. so you feel the local vibe of the city without being accosted by it. \n\nThe greenery is lush, with rocky hillsides covered in trees and grass. The trails are well-maintained and either paved or well-trodden. There's one uphill/stairs on the trail to Eagle's Point from Lands End Lookout. The entire round trip is only 1.4 miles, so easily accomplished in a few hours stroll. \n\nAll in all, one of those famous, must do SF experiences if you want to start getting to know the city by the bay!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

As I enjoy the outdoors a lot more than her, I decided to take her out for a little hike.  I knew from coworkers that there are many dog friendly coastal places like Lands End, so I looked this place up on Yelp and off we went.\n\nWe really enjoyed Lands End, esp the wife since we could bring the mutt.  For the most part if you stay on the trails, it's very easy and you're rewarded with spectacular views of the bay.  About 1/2 mile into the walk, you're treated to a beautiful view of the Golden Gate bridge.  I'd say for newbies like us and tourists alike, this is one of THE places you should swing by and check out.  We did take an off shoot to the Rock Beach and while it was a little difficult for wonder mutt (a tiny ass Maltese), he seemed to enjoy the beach and the water too.  The stacked rocks were a real treat to see.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the experience and plan to return.  It wasn't too difficult to get to.

It's located next to the Sutro Baths and has a pretty nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. You won't be able to get super clear pictures with the bridge since it's still a little far and usually foggy but Sutro Baths, the labyrinth, AND full view of the Golden Gate Bridge in one place makes it worth the stop. \n\nDIRECTIONS: To get to lands end, put in the address for Fort Miley and it'll take you to the closest parking lot. Once you park, there's a set of stairs to take you down to the coastal trail that is less than a mile away from the labyrinth. If there's no parking there, there are a few other parking lots by the visitor center, on the street, and across the street.\n\nHIKE: From the start of lands end, the hike is less than a mile of flat land with one or two set of stairs so it's perfectly doable for kids and dogs. The trail has a lot of trees and great scenery for pictures. Later there's a split in the trail when you get closer to the labyrinth. The left will take you down stairs and around to your destination, and the right trail is a shorter distance upwards to the labyrinth. \n\nThere are a few other easy hiking trails you could take upwards around the area; and to get to Sutro Baths, it's a .3 mile walk down from the start of Lands End.", "author": "Sophia C."}

This review is for people who didn't know where they were going and followed Google Maps until they couldn't anymore... AKA me. \n\nGoogle Maps led me to the very end of the road, where I saw the Sutro Baths sign. Because there were only 3 options, turn left to leave the whole area, go straight to park for Sutro Baths, and turn right, we decided to turn right and follow everybody else. We reached a parking lot, so we parked there. After following people to the trail, I saw that the Golden Gate Bridge was to my right, which I knew was correct because of the pictures I've seen of the labyrinth. The trail is made of dirt, so don't be like me and wear appropriate shoes! Some parts got rocky and slippery. The view was gorgeous throughout the whole entire trail.\n\nI kept following the trail until I almost gave up. A runner passed by and I asked if she knew where the labyrinth was and she told me that it's close and to the left. I kept walking until there was a route to turn left, so I did. It's pretty difficult going down to the labyrinth, especially without proper shoes, and I felt that if I had slipped, I could've fallen down the cliff. Be careful walking down to the labyrinth!\n\nFinding the labyrinth was completely worth it, but be aware of people who actually walk around it like a maze.

This place is a great place to enjoy an #activesunday.\n\nNot knowing which side to start from, we started from the Sutro Bath side and ventured towards the Golden Gate Bridge.  I never knew that there was such a rich history to the Sutro Baths and the view of the crashing waves of the oceans were breathtaking.  Walking along the trail, there were magnificent views of the bay bridge and the surrounding areas.  We even saw a person filming some type of video on his drone. \n\nThe trail was fairly easy with a couple flights of stairs.  Don't forget to check out the rock labyrinth.  Head down towards mile rock beach and stay on the right when you come to a fork in the trail.", "author": "Steven L."}

I probably wouldn't suggest this for young children because of the uneven terrain and steep hills. I wasn't intending on going on a hike the day I came here, so I arrived in boots. I was still able to complete the hike but I would definitely choose footwear with more grip the next time I go!\n\nThe rock formation is awesome! You can get a birds eye view of it and you can also walk down and take pictures next to it. It is, however, situated on a cliff, so if you are scared of heights I would stay away from the edge. \n\nOverall, if you are in SF and need something to do during the day, go here!

And by looking at the overall map of Lands End, the trails are not long so I guess it can be considered an EASY hike... But it is not a stroll down the park like my friend suggested (I wanted to punch her after my hike). I guess it kind of depends on what you want to do but the Mile Rock Trail consisted of stairs that were not even and some parts were immersed in sand. I think from the starting point to get down to the beach is 0.8 miles and about half of it was STAIRS. Not only was it a work out coming back up but going down as well because there were alot of rocks/sand so you had to watch your step. So no I don't think it's a stroll. And I am glad I brought my hiking shoes. I admit since the hike is short you can do with tennis/running shoes but if you're thinking of wearing flats or sandals or flipflops like some of people I saw on this hike... think again! \n\nI loved this hike because I loved the scenery! You can see the Golden Gate Bridge from a far! It really is a picture perfect moment. Secondly, this hike is shady! Yay for breezing Nor Cal weather with ample trees! :) And despite the fact that there were alot of stairs I did get a really good work out out of it. My legs are still sore as I write this review...\n\nI definitely want to check out Lands End again and explore the other trails! Yay! :)", "author": "Stella M."}

Little did we know, at the time, that we would be able to descend all the way to the beach with some breathtaking stops along the way. If you don't take the trek all the way down to the rocky beach, you will be missing out on something extraordinary.\n\nThe journey starts as an easy one, following a gentle trail down the side of the mountain. Once you realize you can go all the way to the water, you also realize you are going to make quite a descent. Forget that you have to climb all the way back up later, it will be worth it. The way down involves a lot of steps, but you are also welcome to find some more off-road opportunities to make it a little more interesting.\n\nIt's called Lands End for a reason, or so it seems, because that is the feeling you have when you make it to the bottom. You can climb rocks, walk along the rocky surf with its crashing waves and just take the time to enjoy the views in all directions. For a New Yorker, it's comparable to walking down beneath the lighthouse to the rocky shore at Montauk, however, there is no bridge in your view there and no land across the way. Lands End is slow decline into serenity. Take the time to reach Lands actual End and remind yourself how beautiful it was while you walk back up.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

With the added management by the National Park Service, it is much improved.\n\nWe parked for free at the Legion of Honor, took the 18 bus from Legion of Honor to the beach, connected to the Coastal Trail, and hit the places listed below, in order. Most of the trail was wide and flat because it used to be a trolley line. Including bus and walking time, the entire journey took 2 hours. Lands End has many parts - many with separate Yelp pages which I've linked when possible.\n- Camera Obscura (unrated, not open during our visit): Located below the Cliff House restaurant, it is open daily 11A-5P, weather permitting (see www.yelp.com/biz/camera-obscura-san-francisco).\n- Lands End Visitor Center (3/5): Free, clean, and new visitor center (built 2012) run by the National Park Service is mostly a bookstore with a nice view. The center has its own parking lot. Located above Sutro Baths, the visitor center is a good central access point to many parts of Lands End. See www.yelp.com/biz/lands-end-lookout-center-san-francisco.\n+ Sutro Baths (4 out of 5 stars): Normally I don't like destroyed and ruined structures, but the cove was pretty and the old concrete barriers were fun to walk along. There was also a tunnel that peeks out to additional rocky coastline. See www.yelp.com/biz/sutro-baths-san-francisco.\n- Point Lobos (3/5): Not much different than other overlooks around Sutro Baths and the Lands End Visitor Center.\n- Lifesaving Station Overlook (3/5): One of many vista points along the Coastal Trail with a view of the Pacific Ocean and the Marin Headlands.\n- Mile Rock Overlook (3/5): Like Lifesaving Station Overlook. Mile Rock is the one furthest from the shoreline that is topped with an unattractive metal column.\n- Mile Rock Beach (3/5): A small beach with remnants from a pier (see www.yelp.com/biz/mile-rock-beach-san-francisco).\n+ Rock Labyrinth (4/5): The high rating isn't for the cheesy labyrinth located at Lands End Point next to Mile Rock Beach, but because this is the best vista in the park with the Pacific to the left, the Marin Headlands across the waterway, and the Golden Gate Bridge to the right (see www.yelp.com/biz/lands-end-labyrinth-san-francisco).\n- Painted Rock (unrated, permanently closed): The site has been closed by the park service for safety reasons (see www.yelp.com/biz/painted-rock-san-francisco).\n- Eagle's Point Overlook (3/5): Too close to the residential area where the homes distract from the view (see www.yelp.com/biz/eagles-point-san-francisco).\n\nThere are 600+ Yelp reviews for \"Lands End Trail\" (see www.yelp.com/biz/lands-end-trail-san-francisco) which doesn't exist.

Took a bus ride from our hotel to the west end of the city to enjoy this place. Found ourselves alone on this gorgeous beach for a while before anybody else had shown up and saw magnificent views of the Golden Gate as well as beach rocks with trails that go through some pretty cool vegetation. I was lucky because my favorite flowers are lilies and we came across a group of wild pink lilies in the middle of tons of green shrub. I didn't see many tourists where we were (which is funny because that's what we were while we were there), and would most definitely say that it's worth the time to travel to for some time away from the chaos in the city.", "author": "Nathan G."}

The restoration is underway, the beginning of the trail is no longer wild and wooly and overgrown, and word is out - people were everywhere.\n\nWe set out on the trail near two families, one little girl worriedly saying I think we're lost, I think we should go back, Auntie, I'm scared, and a boy from another family picked up her riff and said yeah mom, I just want to go back to the car, what are we doing here anyway, I'm bored.\n\nAfter bonding over the tedium that the adults were forcing on them, Tatonya, Monique and David discovered Roxie, and chased her, running and skipping and screaming delightedly, not catching her for the 2 challenging miles to Sea Cliff. Roxie loves a good game of tag and was happy to oblige. \n\nMonique's mother had just gotten custody of Tatonya, and was facing the reality of a kid with ADHD...a whip smart child who rocks in a chair so fast it falls over, who can't get to sleep, who never stops. She thought the trail would be a good place for her to run and get it out of her system, and maybe have a good nights sleep. She was hoping that on Monday's doctor visit some low dosage meds could be prescribed to help Tatonya.\n\nI sat down with the kids and Roxie near Sea Cliff, and they were so happy she was still so they could finally pet her. It's hard to find room for three sets of hands on a little dog, so they had to take turns, which led to some good natured quibbling. \n\nThe walk back was beautiful. The kids were getting tired toward the end, and Tatonya slipped her hand into mine for an extra boost, with her Auntie on the other side. David and Monique kept running and chasing each other. At the trailhead, Monique gave me a cup with some shells that she had collected, saying \"I want you to have this\". \n\nLands End Trail is an urban trail like no other in the country. The views of the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands are breathtaking. Last Saturday was a lovely fall San Francisco day. But for our little group, the beauty was completely on the trail itself, with quick friendships formed and a couple of hours to forget our troubles.\n\nFor this holiday season, my prayers are: \n\nFor David: May your heart remain open to friendships with girls you meet on the trail.\n\nFor Auntie: May you learn how to handle Tatonya, the energy ball of ADHD, and may you be able to continue to provide her with a loving home, and get some rest for yourself.\n\nFor Monique: May you remain patient with your cousin, and keep your calm, joyful, loving spirit intact in the middle of the chaos.\n\nFor Tatonya: May you find peace and equilibrium, and may your meds be light enough that your sparkle still shines through. (and quit knocking chairs over already!)", "author": "Gwynnie P."}

I know, I know.  Most people don't visit their favorite parks to disturb the existing ecosystems, but engaging in a bit of habitat restoration is my thing.  I enjoy the volunteer work and since I don't have my own garden to crawl around in I do it through weekend volunteer projects.  After a week of high stress in the workplace who can blame me for going outdoors and taking my frustrations out on unsuspecting plants that grow where they don't belong?  \n\nLands End Park is part of the huge Golden Gate National Recreation Area.  Located just north of the City's Ocean Beach and Seal Rocks, the park has some well maintained hiking trails and striking views of the ocean, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands.  Even with insects buzzing in my face from the disturbance of their home I sit back on the steep slope and enjoy a breather.  The scene is so serene, and the sound of the waves crashing on rocks below is so relaxing.  If not for the chatter of my fellow volunteers I might actually lean back and take a snooze.  Whether you're into running, hiking, biking or if you're just out for a stroll the trails are wide enough to accommodate everybody.  If exercise isn't your routine take a seat at one of many vista points to absorb the scenery and the sounds of nature.\n\nThe habitat restoration project (officially known as the \"Lands End Stewardship\") takes place every Thursday and Saturday afternoon at 1 PM and members of the public who are interested in volunteering are always welcomed and appreciated.  Monica, one of the GGNRA staff and a project coordinator will reward you with fresh tamales, baked goods, other snacks and water during the break.  Lands End will reward you with its breathtaking nature.  Tools and training are provided.  I know I'll be back.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This one is definitely more like a hike than a walk, since there are times where you can imagine that you are not in the city!\n\nSo, we found a corresponding walk in Stairway Walks in San Francisco & basically followed it.  Plus, I learned a lot of background info from the book.  There are amazing views of the west side of the Golden Gate Bridge, cliffs, trees, & ocean!\n\nDid you know that if you take the stairs/trail to Mile Rock Beach, then up the path to the right, there's a rock \"maze\" by Eduardo Aguilera on the ground there?  There was a little kid & his dad wandering in it when we were there.  At some points along the Coastal Trail, you get views of China Beach & Baker Beach.  The El Camino del Mar Trail is a slightly further inland than the Coastal Trail.\n\nThe Legion of Honor (which I already reviewed) is located towards the east side of the park.  There's a Holocaust Memorial across from the Legion of Honor.  If you golf, the Lincoln Park Golf Course is located in the park also...the trail borders it on the east side of the park.  The USS San Francisco Naval Memorial is located towards the west side of the park.  Then, the Sutro Baths Ruins are located on the far southwest end of the park.\n\nThis is another very popular area, with lots of walkers & joggers.  It was a beautiful sunny day out, & everyone was out enjoying the weather.  In fact, dare I say it, it was hot out the day I was there!  I even got slightly sunburned because I forgot sunscreen.\n\nThere's a couple of places to park if you drive, depending on where you want to go...there's a lot by the Sutro Baths Ruins, on Merrie Way (48th & Point Lobos), a lot for the USS San Francisco Naval Memorial, by the Legion of Honor & along the street on that side of the park.", "author": "Linda T."}

Even then I was a weekend tourist. One common track was to go from Seacliff to the Cliff House on El Camino del Mar. The clifftop sights were breathtaking. Then, in 1983, a heavy rain storm washed out the road, and it was never repaired. \n\nMany years I thought of walking past the barricades, to take a look at the washed-out road, to see what had happened, and where. Today, as My Lady and I admired the new parking lot above the Cliff House, she suggested we walk down Land's End Trail. After 25 years I was still curious about the road, and I countered with a request to walk El Camino del Mar. \n\nHappily, it was on the map, and the National Park Service had built a trail to follow it! With subdued excitement, we walked past the barricades to see the truth of the winter of '83. \n\nAfter walking a few hundred yards down the road, the pavement turned into a developed park trail that looked a lot like a bicycle path. Several hundred yards after that, it degenerated to a dirt path, but it was clearly marked and we kept on walking. Here and there, we would catch glimpses of the old blacktop, above us or below us, that let us know we were still following El Camino del Mar. In some places, rather large trees now grew out of the pavement, reminding me of civic ruins I had seen in other countries. \n\nUnder the overhanging cliffs of Lincoln Park we found several ravines, over which the Park Service had built some wooden foot bridges. However, the ravines made it clear that no road would be built here without serious improvements today. Along the way an interpretive sign told us that Adolph Sutro had built the Ferries & Cliff House Railroad along this route, and, yes, one of their biggest problems was that it kept getting washed out. \n\nThe grand finale of the walk was at the Seacliff side, in Lincoln Park.  Near the far barricades, the road dropped about 10 feet, and the pavement slumped straight down the side. As we gazed at the golf greens, the ocean, and the Golden Gate Bridge, I finally resolved the winter storm of '83.", "author": "David D."}

Which is why the Lands End Park/Trail is \"only\" my second favorite hike in the Bay Area. (First place goes to the Strawberry Canyon-Claremont Canyon trails near Berkeley)\n\nThat's not to say Lands End isn't a great place to unwind. Regardless of how bad the last week might have been, a combo of sitting and watching the ocean and exploring the many side paths of the Sutro Baths area/Coastal Trail is an excellent way to prepare for a new week.\n\nMy favorite part of the trail is Mile Rock Beach (also called Lands End Beach). It's about 0.75-1 mile from the trail head, and down a very long flight of stairs. Three reasons why I like it so much:\n\n1. It's very secluded. It's no surprise that it's a nudist hangout (supposedly -- it's so secluded that there were no nudists during any of my hikes).\n\n2. The Land's End Labyrinth, which other Yelpers have already mentioned. The steps down to the beach forks in the middle -- to the the left is more steps, and to the right is a dirt path. Take the right path and you'll end up at a cliff located above another path. From there, you can look down at the \"labyrinth\" -- it's more like a gauntlet, since there's no branching paths once you enter it.\n\nIf you Google for information about the labyrinth, you'll find that it's made by one artist guy who's also done other labyrinths around the Bay Area. That kind of takes away from the mystery of it all, but the location (atop a semi-secret cliff) and the surrounding view makes up for it.\n\nThe cliff above the labyrinth is also a great place to sit down and take in the view of the bay. Be warned, though, it'll probably be occupied by other couples.\n\n3. All the little things that you can discover: Meticulously-balanced rock towers that people have built among the rock piles on the beach. The seagulls that literally \"float\" up right beside you, catching the strong winds near the cliffs.\n\nMy advice for fellow hikers: Don't leave the trail at the Legion of Honor fork. It's very disenchanting to leave an oceanside trail and end up in a lame golf course.\n\nAccessible by Public Transit: Several bus routes including Muni #38 drops you off near the western trailhead.", "author": "Ryo M."}

We spent 6 days in San Francisco with native's as our guide. By far, this was the most beautiful and serene part of our trip.

The park that covers the northwestern corner of San Francisco offers some of the most gorgeous views and nicest walking paths available in the city.  Starting from 48th and Ocean, you can walk all the way to the gorgeous Sea Cliff neighborhood, hugging the coast all of the way.  Amazing views of the Marin coastline and Golden Gate Bridge abound, as well as the craggy cliffs and vast shoreline of the San Francisco peninsula.\n\nThe parking lot and monument at Land's End Point (at the northern terminus of 48th Ave) offers a great, and easily accessible, view of the bay and the Golden Gate.  An added benefit is that, on a clear evening, the hills and the park block a lot of the nearby light pollution, offering some quality star gazing (well, for a city at least).

I looked up and realized it was actually a guy perched up on a cliff in the trees trying to get our attention. I looked up for a split second and he was FLASHING us!  All I saw was  a blur of flesh, tattoos, and a joker-esque smile out there--and he was lovin' every minute of it. I saw less than my cousin did, partially because my baseball cap obscured my view. For the next mile of our jog, all I heard about was how violated my cousin felt about our Tommy Lee exhibitionist. By the end of the jog, my cousin decided she thought he was kinda cute and wanted to go back and introduce herself. I told her to knock herself out. Of course she was joking, but, there is always some truth to a joke.\n\nAnyhow, now I don't feel as safe jogging through there (esp. alone) and I'm keeping me headphone volume down!

Me and my girlfriend sat on the edge of the cliff right where that voodoo circle thing is and had PBJ sandwiches. Yeah, what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. Just a word of advice, don't try to take a picture of the view w/ your phone when your standing on the edge of the cliff, because you will drop it and it will either fall in the grass bellow or the water.

You really feel like you are on the edge of the world when you are standing on some of these cliffs.  The view of the bridge and the water is incredible.  I wouldn't recommend wearing sandals or riding a bike or bringing a stroller here.  There are alot of stairs and the trail is very narrow in parts, thus not stroller friendly but people did it anyway...arghhh.  The trail is very woodsy in some parts, it reminds me of the trails I used to run in cross country in high school, really secluded and peaceful.  It wasn't very busy today but I can imagine it might be more crowded on a weekend.  I plan on coming back often.", "author": "Rosie F."}

The best thing to do on a sunny yet cool day is to walk the trail from the Sutro Baths end to the Seacliffe end. The trail is dotted with benches for sitting and gazing across the bay. About half way into the trail there is a path down to a sheltered beach where on a weekday if you are lucky you might have all to yourself. Granted this is NOT a swimming beach, but a making out, getting high and watching the waves beach. You can easily forget you are in a city. It is a little bit of Big Sur, right here in our faire city.", "author": "Nina B."}

But that \"Trails Forever\" crap is ruining it.  Seriously.  Why aren't people more upset about it?  They've already paved the main path and torn down tons of trees, and yes, they plan on doing more... I got pamphlets from them showing their plans - concession stands, completely paved areas, more forest torn down, etc...  All of this is under the guise of \"habitat restoration\", but I honestly don't know what animal's natural habitat is concession stands and concrete.  And the animals living there have adapted to it - so they'll be killing off the wildlife as they develop it.  What happened to the raccoons and cats?  I haven't seen any foxes since they started, either.  So yeah, they're ruining it - but hey, easier access for tour buses and pastel clad tourists.  So to hell with the park - it can be destroyed so ugly tourists can visit it once in their life without getting mud on their shoes. *rolls eyes*  Everyone go to http://www.parksconservancy.org/ and send them a bitchy E-mail... please?\n\nIn other news... I love this park.  Foxes (er... see above)!!!  So cute!  And at low tide, there's this fab tidepool with starfish and little crabs and whatnot.  My dog LOVES the tidepool.  LOVES IT!  He barks at starfish (they can't hear, can they?  I hope not... poor things.  I'll wikipedia it) Oh, and that cliff/plateau thing... with the circle/maze, where people leave stuff in the center?  It's so pretty.  Absolutely magical.  If you're not afraid of the dark (yeah, a lot of adults are - you can admit it) it's a great place to go at night.  Oh, and what happened to that guy who used to stand on the cliffs and sing old sailor and gospel songs?    I liked him.  There's also a rope swing in that little isolated area to the northeast of that plateau (where it dips down to that other little beach where sealions sun-bathe - on the top of the hill at the other side).  It's really rad.  And OMG!!!  You know that blocked off area where people have died?  There's a rope thing blocking it... ignore that.  There's a nice little ledge (just don't teeter at the side of the cliff and you'll be fine).  And that little forested hill immediately to the left of where the blocked area starts... if you decide you want pot there's usually someone smoking there.  Oh... and tons of anise to pick and chew while you hike (just avoid everything at pee-range).  Also, at the end (from Sutro, headed towards Legion of Honor, go up the stairs, then down the first set of stairs on the other side.  Turn right.  Immediately below the golf course there's a blackberry oasis (good to know if you're hiking in August/September).  Nomn nomn!!!\n\nI really hope the \"Trails Forever\" crap doesn't ruin it. =(  Would get 5 stars if not for that.", "author": "Tel Avivsion M."}

At times you don't even realize that your in a major city. They recently re-grated the trails and paved part of it making it a little more accesable to all. For bikers (MTB only) this is actually a little shortcut from the ORD to the bridge. I can generally cut 5 minutes off my time taking the Lands end trail (although you didn't hear that from me because i think theres no bikes on part of the single track).

The view is fantastic since you can see the other side of the GG bridge.  This is a place that not many people know of.  Most of the times people just stay farther down in ocean beach, but if you take the time to drive up the huge hill you will notice two locations that have endearing views of the ocean, and the beach as well.  It does get kind of chilly up here, but that should be no problem as long as you go with a special someone.\nThere is a trail that will get you to the beach, the walk is a very pleasant one, there is not a lot of people that go there.  At times you will encounter joggers, dog walkers, and bikers, but other than that not a lot of people are there.   along the trail you will actually come by benches that face the water, what could be better, up on top of a cliff sitting on a bench overlooking the water.\nAt night it does get very very dark, there is no adequate lighting, so i recommend not going into the trail.  The only lighting offered there is the moon, when it is shining bright, and the police lights that hover around the area looking for suspicious activities.\nin other words, If you need a good place to hang out in the afternoons this is one of the few places in san francisco, that is not over populated.", "author": "Christopher L."}
