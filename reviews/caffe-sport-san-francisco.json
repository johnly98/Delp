It was July 4th and my sister was in town, we were hoping to see the fireworks atop the boyfriend's place just a bit further north of North Beach so we dropped by the area hoping to hit up one of the popular spots. Nope. All was full with stupid lines. But, the reviews seemed ok here and the wait was shorter than the other spots, so here we were.\n\nI probably got the Bolognese and we likely got some cheesey appetizer, too, but all of our dishes (likely 5 total plus dessert for 3 people because I over order) were great! This review is to remind myself to come back (despite its decor). I'll be back again now that I've remembered to put this review in.", "author": "starrynight c."}

The wait for a table can be pretty rough though during the evening so make reservations, or call ahead so you're not doing what my friends and I did by trying to walk up and find a place. In our defense, we were drinking so ummmm...\n\nAnyway, after a while we were seated at a small table for the three of us. Water came by sparingly, and food took quite a while longer. There was definitely a breeze going through the place as it was somewhat chilly where we were at so the wait was noticeable. The dishes can be pretty large so if you're ordering a lot, space can become an issue. Just to clarify, the dishes themselves are large. \n\nI had ordered the zucchine al' vapore, ravioli di mozzarella e pomodorini, and a side of sauteed spinach. The flavors were pretty good, I liked the lemon sauce that the zucchini was in. Sauteed spinach was what you would expect. The ravioli were hearty but I wanted more from the sauce.", "author": "David C."}

Every corner is crammed full if details, from hand painted tiles to aged wooden knickknacks and glass bobbles. Very cozy space with some private dining areas that are good for groups like our party of six.\n\nI ordered the spinach ravioli which was a good portion size for one. It tasted pretty fresh, though the no-nonsense arrangement could've been a little more intentional.\n\nOur cups were never empty and overall service was pretty quick. The bread brought to the table before our entrees was the only thing I found lacking. It was pretty default and could've been crustier and chewier, with some hint of being baked in-house that morning or sourced from a local bakery and equally as exciting.", "author": "Julianne V."}

Great authentic food, friendly service and an unparalleled interior decoration design.\n\nOnce you walk into Caffe Sport, there is so much to see everywhere. There's art on the dining tables. Lights, paintings and other various colorful objects are hanging in all directions of the restaurant. You can immense yourself in a mini-art show here while eating here. \n\nThe service staff is friendly here. We were told that all the pasta is made in-house here. We decided to share the spaghetti & meatballs, cheesy garlic bread and minestrone soup. Each of the dishes we had ordered is shareable between two persons. The spaghetti & meatballs were easily my favorite dish here; arguable the best 'spaghetti  & meatball' in North Beach. Noodles were cooked perfectly and I loved loved the meatballs. The minestrone soup tasted fresh and had many cut vegetables in the broth. This was a big bowl of soup. The cheesy garlic bread was a bit disappointing for me. It was definitely cheesy, but lacked any other seasoning or flavor. \n\nI am starting to make my rounds around North Beach and try all the Italian restaurants.

Food was okay, not much impressed where I feel I can't make at home. Considering how long the establishment has been there, I expected more flavorful, if not more authentic Italian taste considering it's located in North Beach/Little Italy. The mushroom risotto would have been great if they didn't leave whole pieces of bay leaves in the dish; didn't notice them until they made it into my mouth, twice.  \nWaiter was attentive, considering how bus they were.  Host/manager was terrible. If he was a true professional, he would not be rushing my table. He said the table they gave us was reserved & the party has arrived. He claimed we were there for 2 hours, when we were actually there for 1 hour; this included the time from when we got seated, placed our order, time food cooked/came to table, & finished eating.  He never mentioned the reservation when we were seated. A true professional would have given the customers this information ahead of time, so we can decide if we'd wait for another table or go elsewhere.  \nPrior to the interaction w/the manager, our experience there was very positive and I had considered bringing friends/family visiting SF.  Now I have changed my mind.  There's plenty of Italian restaurants in SF, so I definitely will not be returning.", "author": "Yolie K C."}

Always passing by this place and wondering why there are so many people outside. Now I know. I got the privilege to come here for a birthday dinner. Though the prices area bit high for my taste, the portion size definitely made up for it.\n\nCaffe Sport is pretty cramped. One road to walk in and you have to crab walk past people. The waiters and waitresses were ok. It took them 20 minutes to bring out a cake though. Uncut and unopened box. No utensils to help out either. No singing (This I don't care too much about but if you were going to take 20 minutes, this is what I expected). Terrible.\n\nBelow are my thoughts for all the dishes ordered:\n+Risotto a Fungi $22: This was a tasty dish, though the rice was a bit hard/undercooked. Also a small portion.\n+Cioppino Rosso $30: Much more flavor than the Bianco. I would get this over Bianco.\n++Crab Insalatta $40: This was DELICIOUS. Must get. Huge plate of crab. Sauce is yumm.\n-Cioppino Bianco $30: Kind of tasted like boiled seafood. Would skip if you don't want bland\n+Vongole All' Vapore $21: I like the clams, good flavor. Not much sand either which is always a plus.\n+Scampi All' Antonio $25: I like the white sauce on the shrimp. Looks like a weird dish tho lol\n+Rustico All' Antonio $25: Sauce was good but the pasta felt undercooked.\n-Chicken Parmiginiana $20: Kind of small dish. The chicken was a bit dry. Can skip.\n\nI'd definitely come back as a group lunch/dinner. Huge shareable portions for a reasonable price.", "author": "Benita M."}

My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for 25+ years and has been a staple for any friends and family who wanted good, authentic Italian food. This places has held many fond memories and I would gloat about how AMAZING this place was. Unfortunately, after my experience this past weekend, I found out they have NEW OWNERS. The menu and decor are the same, but the flavor and taste profile does not resemble the previous ownership. \n\nFirst off, the ORANGE dipping sauce and bread was a staple of this place. I would get eat an entire loaf of bread with the sauce, that is how good it was. Now, the sauce has completely changed. It tastes more like a jarred vodka pasta sauce, lacking in flavor. ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL. \n\nSecondly, whenever I frequent here, I order the same thing every time, Pasta Meat and Mushrooms and Shrimp Al' Antonio. I've been ordering this for 20+ years. When I went in this past weekend, it was a noticeable difference. The pasta itself changed, and the sauce for both dishes did not resemble the original way. Take a look at the picture I posted of the shrimp, and compare it to past pictures, you'll see the difference for yourself. The shrimp used to be big gulf shrimp, with a thick sauce that was so rich and flavorful. Now, that is not the case. \n\nI had the pleasure of sitting across from an elderly couple who had frequented the restaurant for longer than my family. When they took one look at the orange sauce and the Shrimp Al' Antonio, they grabbed their things and left the restaurant. That's how noticeable the difference was. \n\nWhen I asked the server about the food, I expressed my concern over the flavor and how bland the food was, there was little to no remorse. Didn't even offer to compensate for food we did not want to eat. \n\nI'm writing this review because I want the new owners to see this and know that the regulars who have patronized this establishment for years can tell the difference. The quality and flavor profiles are not even close to what it used to be. My worry is that the place that I have had such fond memories is heading in a bad direction. I'm willing to give this place another shot and rewrite this review if things change back to truly authentic Italian food. #bringAntonioBack", "author": "Paolo B."}

The Penne pesto was good but not nearly as tasty as it was and nowhere near as creamy.  The Rustica all' Antonio should not even be called by that name because it is nothing like its namesake - no creamy sauce just a slightly lemony juice that seems like it came from the cooked zuchini and shrimp.

This place was always about sharing and family style and the portions are so small its hard to do that. \n\nThis place really need to go back to the welcoming homey place it once was... I was very disappointed.", "author": "Rhilee L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-26", "description": "I'm genuinely puzzled at all the gushing reviews here, so much so that I'd have to guess that many of them must be paid reviews. Caffe Sport is a touristy, old-school Italian-American restaurant where the experience begins when you walk in the door and notice all the kitschy artwork and other objects lining the walls and ceilings. Although service is fast and friendly, the food disappoints. The shrimp antonio, for example, came doused with so much white garlic sauce that you'd think a nuclear winter had set in. The garlicky aftertaste lingered cloyingly long afterwards, and I'd have to presume that all that sauce is used to mask a lack of flavor and/or freshness.\n\nThe 4-star Yelp average is indefensible when there are many Italian-themed restaurants in town that are in tune with modern trends and offer better quality for the price. That having been said, maybe it's a good thing that places like these lure all the tourists in, because it leaves room at seriously good places for locals to enjoy.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Wonderful Sicilian style food, with heavy garlic and olive oil.  There were lines here every night--sometimes over an hour wait.  The service was almost rude.  The waiters asked about your preferences and told you what to order.   I can still picture the head waiter who was from Italy.  Since I was a regular, I never had a long wait for a table.  The worst thing was they did not accept credit cards.\n\nFast forward to 2016 and there was no wait for a table at 6:30 on a Friday night.  The streets were filled, but Caffe Sport was not.  We noticed a sign in the window indicating a liquor license ownership change.\n\nWe ordered the green salad, penne pizziola, penne pesto, filet of sole and cioppino bianco.  The green salad was good and the cioppino was very good.  DH enjoyed his Italian beer and said it was a very reasonable price.  We thought all of the dishes were priced reasonably since the servings were generous.\n\nEither the food is not as good as we remember or our taste buds have matured.  I do think it's the later.

The food was good but we decided as a group that we prefer a creamy pesto.

Brilliant! \n+ Spacious seating, great for groups or just an intimate date for 2\n+ Excellent attentive service\n+ Cioppino is different but just as good as the restaurant next door! \n\nCan't get a table at Sotto Mare? Walk down the street to Caffe Sport. It seems like Caffe Sport is just overshadowed by its more popular and better marketed/publicized kin up the street - though I can't see why. When Sotto Mare told us our wait would be 45+ minutes, Caffe Sport seated us in just minutes and cleared a lovely large table for just the two of us who were looking to get a nice hot bowl of cioppino in our bellies. Honestly this may be my go-to cioppino spot in North Beach from now on because I'd rather be sitting with room to breathe on comfortable wooden benches at a lovely colorful tiled table than to wait for a mini two-top or bar spot next door.\n\nThe INSALATA BURRATA was in all seriousness the most heavenly burrata I've ever had in my life - it had the perfect amount of high quality balsamic vinegar over aptly lemony tart arrugula paired with the creamiest silkiest burrata cheese. The flavors just melted together and I dream about it to this day. The HOUSE MARINATED OLIVES are flavored with garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and were also delicious as an appetizer. \n\nWe decided upon both of their versions of cioppino so we could try them both - the CIOPPINO ROSSO (house marinara sauce) and the CIOPPINO BIANCO (lemon garlic white sauce). The cioppino here isn't soupy - it's more saucy though still slurpable with a spoon, best devoured dipped with bread. The two styles nicely contrasted and are both worth trying. The seafood in both was fresh and generously portioned.\n\nOur server was very helpful and attentive, and he helped us through the menu and made helpful suggestions and kept our wine glasses full.", "author": "Megan L."}

Alas, Tony has long been gone to the Great Ristorante in the Sky, and the food has been toned down considerably.\n\nNowadays, this is a more civilized establishment, and the food is not bad at all, but for all of us who tasted the wizardry of the cooking in the 70's and 80's,  it is a letdown.\n\nCome here for Sicilian interpretations of seafood cookery that may not be as distinctive as once before, but if you are new or too young to remember, this may be a great experience.\nAt least the service is far better now, and the people seem to be quite nice.", "author": "George T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-23", "description": "My wife and I recently got married in SF and chose to hold our rehearsal dinner at Caffe Sport, a few blocks from the Church where we were married the following day. Growing up in the city, I had already been going to Caffe Sport since I was a kid and my wife's family often went there for birthdays and other family celebrations, so needless to say we were already big fans of the restaurant. Caffe Sport is one of those iconic North Beach establishments that has survived over time as the neighborhood has changed around it. It has not changed a bit, keeping its funky artwork and decorations that cover the walls (and ceiling) and maintaining the familiar atmosphere that regulars have come to love. Every time you step into the restaurant, it's a bit like you're stepping back in time. \nOur experience the night of our rehearsal dinner was nothing short of perfect and we can say it is a direct result of the hard work and exceptional customer service put forth by the business owner Jose Franco and his team. We chose to reserve the small room in the back of their restaurant to accommodate our group of 26. It was an intimate setting and allowed everyone to mingle together. I got in contact with Jose Franco several months before our rehearsal dinner, to talk about menu options, wine for the dinner and overall cost. Jose made the entire process easy, and I felt he was someone I could trust from the first conversation we had. Jose is clearly passionate about the success of his business and just as import, the satisfaction of his customers. The night of our dinner, Jose and his team were hustling, keeping the wine flowing, checking in with each table frequently, and basically making us feel at home in his restaurant. That is something you cannot often say about dining in the city of San Francisco. Dining at Caffe Sport is family style, so portions are generous, and personally I think they have some of the best pasta dishes, certainly in the North Beach area, but moreover in SF. Jose gave us several options when we were coming up with the menu, and set us up with a 5-course meal for a very reasonable price when compared to comparable restaurant options. No joke, we ate like kings, and finished off the meal with a great Tiramisu.\nJose and his staff were very good to us and we thank them for making our special night a total success. We came away feeling as though we had made new friends with Jose and his staff and will be back to visit with him again soon. Jose is a family man and took a personal interest in our story, of how we met and all the details surrounding our wedding. It was clearly genuine and it was very obvious that Jose Franco is a stand-up business owner. Cannot say enough good things about Jose and his crew. Thanks Jose, see you around the neighborhood!", "author": "Colin F."}

The place itself is in dire need of dusting and plain cleaning. The food is no longer what it use to be. We placed a simple lunch order; house salad, gnocchi with pesto and the carne de fungi (beef & pork pasta). In San Francisco Italian Restaurants you can pretty much determine if the food will be good,  by the bread they serve. Well, the bread was sliced white bread. The entrees were served the salad forgotten. The gnocchi dumplings were heavy ( not light and airy) and drowned in pesto sauce which lacked  flavor. It appeared to have had dried shavings of basil. The beef and pork pasta was flavorless and had a total of one mushroom cut in half. No fresh parm served here. It's the the stuff that comes out of the green can. The waitress never checked on us ( there were only about six people dining at lunch time so she wasn't busy). We had to call her attention to the fact that our salads never arrived. She offered a free dessert on the house. We left our plates with more than half of the meal on them. Will never return. The name lives on, but clearly not the same level as once was.

(outside of my own kitchen)... \n\nSaturday night, My wife Anna and I walked in to Caffe Sport \"the little hole in the wall\" as my brother called it with not to much praise and met Jos\u00e9 and his right hand man Luis. From the second we walked through the door they made me feel like we were part of the family. Just the way a Home style Italian place should be, the way MY Mother's kitchen always is!!!!\n\nMy wife is originally from here and went to Caffe Sport all the time as a child with her family, when it was run by the original owner Antonio La Tona. She has told me of the changes, small upgrades, tweaks and the new owners, who were intelligent enough to leave an iconic restaurant alone and not mess with success! To the main-staples that have remained the same, from the fabulously unique and eclectic decor, to the family style and sized dishes, to the open, welcoming and generous staff that treat you like family all remain the same since she was a child... As she always says I am a \"fat kid\" trap inside a skinny man's body, I could have very well have sat eating all night long but unfortunately they do have to close the doors and go home at some point ;-) \n\nWe will tell anyone and every one who will listen... if you have not been there in a while try it out again and I bet you will love it! If you've never been there before TREAT YOURSELF to impeccable Mom style cooking and every better staff!!   \n\nTo Jos\u00e9, Luis, Marcelo and the entire staff,\nI have had my Yelp account since 2013 but never found a place good or bad that has been so deserving of my time to write about.

It has been our favorite restaurant for decades and the place we go for birthday celebrations, family dinners, etc. We are HEARTBROKEN to report on our most recent visit (1/14/17), our daughter's 10th birthday, that both the food and the service are not what they used to be. \n\nIn years past, we were always greeted with kisses on the cheeks by our favorite Italian waiters, guys who remembered not only your faces, but your favorite dishes, and the fact that your kids downed a plate of mussels in record time. On our most recent visit, the service was non-existent. We saw two employees our entire time, and the one who waited on us was missing much of the meal. We saw several parties come in, look around, and walk out, without any staff even noticing. We had to ask for bread THREE times before it came (and there were only 3 parties eating lunch). \n\nAnd our food...it was sub par. The pesto was delicious as usual, but it was all downhill from there. Caffe Sport has always been known for their amazing seafood; however, in the Prawns Al Antonio, usually my favorite dish, the prawns were overcooked and rubbery, like they had been cooked earlier in the day and then re-warmed for our meal. We tried a new dish on the menu, squid ink ravioli with crab, and the pasta was dense and chewy, totally ruining the tender texture of the Dungeness crab inside. \n\nOur waitress told us that Marcello's had bought the business and everything was to be turned over by the end of January.

Seatings are only at 3 specific times each night.\n\nORDERING:\nEach party must order at least ONE double order of a dish.  Otherwise, feel free to share single orders of everything else.  The serving sizes are HUGE!  A single order will feed 4.  Think of this like going out for Chinese - everyone orders something and then the whole party shares.  A couple going out for dinner is still going to have to order ONE double order of something, so going to dinner here is better for parties of 4+ .\n\nSERVICE:\nThey are Italian, arrogant and at times rude.  The waiters are rushed and over worked, so do not expect small talk and mindless chatter.  At the later seating don't be surprised if your waiter is a little drunk... he may have been drinking wine since 4 pm !  Do not be offended or get upset if they ignore you because reservation was made in a name that ends in: -berg, -stein, -witz, -uyen, or -ow.  If you made your reservation under an Italian surname (or ending in a vowel), then expect better than average service.  Your food will not all arrive at the same time, so eat as it arrives.  Besides, there's not enough room on the table. SAVE ROOM, because more food is coming!  Turista , cosa vi aspettate ?\n\nSUCKER...\nOftentimes the kitchen has too much of a good thing (they cooked too much of a dish and it just isn't selling well). So, expect your waiter to simply drop off a double order of something you did not order.  The kitchen is trying to clear it out, the waiters are moving excess inventory, and you're hungry.  But, if YOU TOUCH IT, IT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR BILL !  AND - You're still going to get all of the food that you ordered as well...  Turista stupido !  They know EXACTLY what they are doing!\n\nFOOD:\nWith all of it's idiosyncrasies, Caffe Sport is still one of the BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANTS on the PLANET.  Lots of garlic, fresh ingredients, olive oil and authentic recipes.  Tutto Fresco!  The parmigiana melanzane (eggplant parmesan) is to die for - it is a must do!  The gnocchi con pesto is also very tasty.  Tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert is a must!\n\nDECOR and AMBIENCE:\nThe cobweb covered prosciutto hanging from the ceiling and the candle wax covered wicker wrapped chianti bottles on the tables should make you feel like a wiseguy, eating dinner in grandma's basement.  The tables are wooden picnic tables or old round electrical reels.  They were racking up LEED Points before it was en vogue !\n\nCASH ONLY!  \nLike true Italians... declare $1 to the IRS for every $5 they pocket!\n\nPARKING:\nIt's North Beach...

I visited recently and while there was some turnover the food is consistently excellent! the service friendly and quick and the prices not unreasonable for what you get.  \n\nThe crab salad is unparalleled and can't be compared to anywhere.  You get a full plate of crab parts covered in a white garlic sauce that you eat in a messy way with your fingers. By the time you're done garlic is oozing out your pores its amazing. We coupled it with the creamy pesto plate and the mussels and had one of the best meals ever.  Not to mention the bread and gorgonzola, garlic, spicy bread dipping sauce .  I can't wait to come back.

I mean, I get it, but I'm more on the side of life. So, if you're looking for a reason to live, or for something to make your life more enjoyable, stop in at Caffe Sport for a decadent, filling, and flavorful meal.\n\nMy dear late granddad used to rave about Caffe Sport. Being a wine aficionado, and an original Mad Man (ad exec for TV Guide mag in the 50s and 60s, nbd), he took my mom and dad out to one of the primo spots in North Beach when he came to visit SF from Napa. My parents had shacked up together in a small Clement St apartment, and my dad boldly thought to ask Grandpa for my mom's hand in marriage over dinner at Caffe Sport (to which Grandpa said no... at first!). Well 26 years later, I'm here, and with four other siblings to boot, I guess it worked itself out after all.\n\nCaffe Sport brought my love of Italian food to the forefront of my taste buds. My parents always made great Italian food when I was growing up, but since they now don't eat meat or dairy, the food during holidays has mostly turned to fruit, eggs, and lentils. I was brought back to Caffe Sport recently with my friend's stepdad who likes to order almost everythingon the menu and eat family style (my favorite!), plus multiple bottles of wine, and lots of desserts. How can I complain?\n\nThe Pesto Gnocchi will *gnocchi* your socks off with it's tenderness. One of my favorite dishes of all time is the Rustica al' Antonio. I swear, someone's sweet little Italian grandmother is sitting in the kitchen, singing \"That's Amore\" in Italian, with a pastry bag of their delicious four cheese sauce, funneling it into each and every piece of penne. \n\nOkay, that's probably not what's happening, but that's what it tastes like, and it's simply divine. The Steamed Mussels are baller, and I normally don't order mussels or clams because I've read Kitchen Confidential, and, uhh yea, I have my reasons. But the garlic broth with sourdough bread dipped in it, ahhhh, this is probably what life is all about.\n\nEnjoy, Yelpers. It's really a great experience, food and d\u00e9cor wise.", "author": "Crystal C."}

Bad communication?\n\nOn the food side, it was mediocre at best.  The eggplant and chicken parmigiana were overcooked and hard, the pasta with mussels and pesto was way too salty, the carne y fungi was good, the calamari Antonio had a goopy, raw garlic sauce, and the clams were swimming in garlic butter.\n\nDecor is colorful, but there is a lack of structure at the restaurant that makes your dining experience bewildering.", "author": "Nina K."}

The quality of the food was poor, bland, and tasteless.  I never leave bad reviews, but I really think the time for this place has past and I want to warn people. If the management wants to keep people coming they need to start from square one and seriously revamp the food. Taking out a lot of that old crusty crap in the place would help too, less is more in that case.  The service also left a lot to be desired. We were the only ones in there and the service as very slow to nonexistent.\n\nOne positive there is a lot of kitsch and clutter, but it does seem like they dust it because you would expect it to be covered in grease and dust and it wasn't that much.

A little dumbfounded I took my place outside (with everybody else) and waited some 20 minutes while others were sat. After a few minutes more we approached one of the waiters to confirm that our seats were coming soon, only to find out they had no idea we were here and had no table prepped.\n\nI'm not sure the point of offering reservations if you seat people in the order they arrive.

I learned that the restaurant recently changed ownership as the meal was not at all what I remembered. It used to be my go-to restaurant, but I don't think I will be going-to in the future.\n\nThe food tastes good enough (nothing wrong with it), but it's lost its WOW factor. I remembered the fun decor and the generous portions. The decor is still funky, but when the waiter brought out our entrees and we all just looked at each other. Food is served family style (fun!)  but the portions were pretty tiny so we were careful to take polite portions.  My favorite dish was the calamari fritti with the garlic aioli sauce. My friend's handmade mozzarella and tomato ravioli was tasty enough, but there were 4 raviolis (for $22) which breaks down to $5.50 a ravioli.

The food was alright but not spectacular but the server I don't think spoke english. It was a party of 7 and we had to continuously ask for more water, bread, and to order more drinks, by literally waving down the sever as he continuously ignored us. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even ask if wanted to order drinks when we sat down. The server basically avoided the table and was rude in his interaction making it feel like we were inconvenience him. \n\nI use to work as a waiter and the service didn't even come close to the bare minimum of acceptable behavior, it just hurts the businesses sales. While Caffe sport has good reviews on yelp and the food was alright the service made everyone in my group never want to return. This is not a one person mistake and should be addressed by management. \n\nThe issue with the service started when we sat down, we waited ten minutes to ordered our few beers and they didn't arrive until we asked again, we asked 5 times for bread and there famous bread dip after waiting over 15 minutes for it.  The sever didn't even try and communicate with us, like we are out of bread and are making more it will be out when its done, or apologies for the innocence of late dishes. We then ordered 7 dishes and only 6 of then arrived. One person in our group  didn't get his plate for another 20 minutes. \n\nAfter our table was cleared the waiter just brought the check and never asked if we would like desert or coffee. We then divided up what each person owed and wrote it nicely next to the last 4 digits on the card, we even included tax, which after being a sever know many people forget to divide in. The server ignored us and just divided it evenly among the cards... this was outright wrong, but after such bad service we just left without tipping.

We used to come here when we lived in Marin, but this is our first revisit to old haunts in almost a decade.  Really glad we returned.  Love the funky decor.  Very good service and, as in days of old, great Sicilian style food.", "author": "Bill M."}

Which was hilariously out-of-place because all the other parties were families, elderly, and non-sloppy-drunk, respectable people (I was with my mom). Like, this is not a pub. And also super weird, some guy on the restaurant staff - I think he worked in the kitchen bc he wasn't a waiter - seemed to be encouraging it or flirting with some wasted girl - I mean, come ON dude. NOT the time/place to try and spit some game! You're just making this drunk girl yell and she's ruining my favorite pasta.  LOL. But, our waiter was excellent, and effectively counterbalanced the weirdness happening. \n\nNormally this situation would call for a negative Yelp review, but I just can't. I have never experienced this before at Caffe Sport - this is my family's FAVORITE restaurant, and has been for like 10+ years. And we live in LA!!!\n\nWe come up to SF often, and we ALWAYS have to eat here. There's even been a couple of times (like this last time...)  where we order a couple of pastas to go, wrap it in layers of plastic and ziploc bags, and carry it on our flight home for family members who couldn't make the trip. LOL I know, I know.\n\nFirst off, the sauce you get with bread when you sit down is sooooo goooooodddd I'd be happy just eating bread and that sauce.\n\nWe have standard favorite pasta dishes we get here - Pesto, Meat Sauce, Lobster pasta. ALL the sauces have so much flavor, I just can't. \n\nI freakin love the pesto. It sorta smacks you in the face when you eat it. I mean, it's the kind of sauce where you can taste the ingredients very clearly - basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, parmesan, and I guess probably some proprietary blend of cheese/spices/etc from a family recipe...I don't know - just get it. My favorite pesto of ALL TIME!\n\nThe meat sauce - this last time we got the beef/pork ragu with mushrooms - it comes layered on cheesy creaminess and the FLAVORS man, the flavors.\n\nThe lobster pasta is expensive (market price), but it's tradition for my family to get that, and it is worth it. It's rich and savory and so good.\n\nI've also had the spinach gnocchi - perfect pillows for any sauce to lay on. Of course we got it with the pesto.\n\nI mean the place is not cheap, but we think it's worth it bc it's so good. The pastas are family style plates, $18+ each - but like okay I know it's just pasta, but I'd gladly pay $18+ for the best pasta ever.  Also, I loooove the interior feel - the garlic wreath chandelier is my fave. \n\nJust like, next time - I would hope the staff would cut off the alcohol or tell their drunk-ass friends to leave.", "author": "Jessie I."}

My brother-in-law is in town for a visit and decided to have him experience CS.   The service was ok however when our food came it looked unfamiliar.  Penne Pesto, which used to make my pores reek of garlic for days after my visit, was a pale comparison in both flavor and quantity along with being under cooked. If it is possible to make a bland plate of pesto this was it.   The saute' Calamari alla Marinara was a bland watery mess.

If you love seafood and the sauce of Italian food, you will love this place. A few of my favorite dishes:\nPasta rustica. A four cheese marinara sauce with a mix of seafood, including calamari, scallops, and shrimp. The sauce is so delicious and the seafood is cooked to perfection. \nScampi alla Antonio is a must get. The signature dish of the original owner, it's a creamy white garlic sauce on top of large scampi and sliced zucchini. The sauce is made without dairy but is still so creamy and delicious. It has a lemon yang and a crispness that will leave you wanting more. \nThe pesto is so good too. They add whole pine nuts for extra flavor and, again, it has a creaminess that's delicious, without added dairy. \nIf you're in north bay, make sure you hit this place. It's got an Italiana Classico style that isn't preserved in many other places in the area. \nAntonio, the original owner, was also an artist, and his interesting paintings and designs are all vet the restaurant. This place is a unique work of art where the tastes of the food are the only thing more interesting than the decor. \n\nThe only warning: this place puts the garlic on thick, as you should in Italian cooking. Don't come on a first date, because the garlic breath is intense. In fact, don't go anywhere important for 24 hours--- the garlic will be sweating out your pours that long!", "author": "Marisa W."}

Six plates arriving at thoughtlessly staggered intervals was unacceptable.  Also, we went for twenty minutes at a time without our waiter.  Not good.\n\nFood was fine.  Nothing to write home about.  Not bad but not 'good' at all.  The cioppino was especially odd-- just a plate of seafood-- no broth that is typical of this dish.  The bread was hard and white (and my toddler ate it anyway, and we had the hardest time getting a refill).  Requests for olive oil were ignored.  Just a strange experience overall.

The atmosphere is quite unique and very eclectic.  Tchotchkes everywhere you look, every nook and cranny filled even the ceiling.  It almost seemed Italian with a Mexican flare, a bit odd.  Like I said as for the food I would suggest keep walking.  I like to share but I want that to be with who I chose and have an input on their dish.  Instead what arrived was three plates of penne pasta, one was a double batch vs. four.  What it did allow me to do was to compare all three dishes which turned out to be a bad thing.  Maybe if I would have had my own plate I wouldn't have realized they tasted too similar.  The mild white sauce had a touch of red sauce in it but a bland mild white sauce that was drowned out by the touch of red, the red meat sauce wasn't bold or  flavorful enough and the lobster over red sauced pasta was just a mess.  As I tried to crack the claw I was afraid it was going to shoot out of my hand across the table and injure a third party.  I will say the caprese salad was very tasty but skip the troughs of penne pasta with either of these three white or red sauces.  I was thinking this was the \"no soup for you\" place, not sure if this is true but I wish it would have been because we could have saved $70 per couple if they would have taken it away.

Smallish portions and not cheap,  especially as there is little imagination used to create these dishes.  Visit Capo's instead.", "author": "The A."}

I thought the food was comparable to fast food Italian. The sauce was too thin and watery it was like eating naked pasta on every dish. The shrimp scampi was just cooked shrimp with a white suave dumped on top. Most of the dishes the pasta was cooked great but with just added toppings thrown in half ass. We also had a reservation for 8:45  only to find out the kitchen closes at 9:10 when we got arrived which left no time for anything. The staff was rushing everything because it was obvious they wanted to leave as soon as possible. Probably won't go back again with so many other options in the area that seem to have a little more pride in their dishes.", "author": "Ben S."}

Had been previously a score or more times over last 35 years, but not for maybe 4 or 5 years.  Neither of the two appetizers (fried eggplant or fried mixed seafood) were any good.  Eggplant skin very bitter, shrimp not fresh and all seafood overcooked.  For us the very famous Prawns a la Antonio were much changed and terrible.  The prawns were 1/3 the size of previously and there prawns  and (previously crunchy) lightly steamed zucchini were both way overcooked.  The previously wonderfully-garlic accompanying sauce/aioli must have contained less than 20% as much garlic; could barely taste a hint of garlic; awful!  Service was incredibly slow at 5:00 PM with ONLY one other party in the restaurant.  perhaps the greatly deteriorated food quality and serveice are the reason.  We won't be back.  Don't go if you are expecting the same quality food and experience of 5 - 25 years ago.  Too bad.", "author": "David G."}

Second, maybe it's just me but I think the portions are pretty hefty, thus justifying the price. And lastly, definitely a spot to hit up if you're seeking some hearty comfort food.\n\nFamily style between the 4 of us, we ordered the giant house salad, 3 pastas, and the steamed garlic clams. The house salad is so simple yet so satisfying. It has fresh cut romaine lettuce, roasted red peppers, olives and tomatoes with a house vinaigrette that makes it just divine. We got 3 pastas, but one was actually supposed to be eggplant parmesan. Nonetheless the eggplant pasta was just as good. The shrimp/scallop as well as the pesto were both to die for! There's just something about the rich and cheesy sauces that make it so addicting. The steamed clam appetizer is a must order if you love clams. Every bite is filled with delicious pureed garlic, lemon and wine exploding your taste buds. Oh, and of course you can't forget about that complimentary spicy cheesy sauce with bread to start.\n\nI guess you could say $20 a plate may be a bit pricey for something so seemingly simple, but really, can you make those sauces at home?

We ordered the Chicken Parm, ravioli and pesto pasta. Now don't get me wrong.... The food tasted good, by no means outstanding but the portions were really tiny. Dipping sauce for bread was good, jalape\u00f1os in sauce? OK. Basically we got one breast of chicken pounded out and fried for $16, pretty simple like I make at home, a small plate of ravioli, was good and a small plate of somewhat oversauced pesto pasta, so much leftover sauce in bowl so bread was handy for dipping after. A glass of beer and wine sent us over $130+ and we were looking at each other still hungry! We contemplated ordering more food but opted to leave and get gelato next door.

I should have just loaded up on their bread and dipping sauce (which is delicious!) instead.\n\nMaybe I missed a note or message somewhere about what to expect, or maybe I should have asked what kind of sauce the pasta comes with.

Probably more interesting than any of the food we ordered.  Be sure to check out the ceiling and see the fun artwork.\n-Service:  On par with what was expected.  Our waiter was a dead ringer personality-wise for Jonah Hill.  Partially in looks, too.\n-Food:  \"Italian\" and \"seafood\" are dead on as nearly everything contained some sort of pasta and some sort of seafood.\n-Favorites:  The Pesto Penne was delicious.  It was much creamier when compared to similar dishes elsewhere, but it was a great choice.  Be sure to hold on to some extra bread to wipe up the excess sauce (literally, my pasta was practically drowning in it).  It's supposed to be family style, but I decided to be a family of one and kept the whole plate to myself ;)\n-Other Favorites:  The bread and dipping sauce!  I have absolutely no idea what it is made of, but I think it was anchovy, garlic, spicy tomato... shoot, I have no idea.  If I could find the recipe to make this, it would be a staple in my home.  It alone warrants 500 stars.\n-Disappointment/Rectification:  our friend's Ruscta All'Antonio was a bit \"too watery\" for her liking, and our waiter had no problem taking it back, bringing her something different, and removing it from the bill.  \n-Pricing:  Considering the amount of food, I think it was fair; my pasta dish was big enough to take home nearly half.\n\nCredit cards accepted.

The prices are great, the portions huge, and the sauces superb. \n\nJust a few of the dishes we love:\nMeat and Mushroom Pasta (Carne e Funghi)\nPasta Speciale (scallops & shrimp in an exquisite 4-cheese tomato cream sauce)\nShrimp al' Antonio \nSicilian Spaghetti w (giant) Meatballs (ask for the delicious marinara sauce w/ this)\nFried Calamari\n\nThe wait staff are terrific--very friendly and accommodating--no matter what my request. It's also one of the most unusual restaurants in North Beach. First off, the d\u00e9cor is one-of-a-kind, like a Sicilian funhouse. This is because the original owner did woodworking and crafted almost all of it himself--and that d\u00e9cor stretches to the ceiling. The tables and chairs don't match from one piece to the next, and because of this it lends the place a wonderful warmth and charm. \n\nIt's also the only restaurant I've known where people will strike up conversations at the neighboring tables to tell them to try this or that entr\u00e9e. In fact, I happened to taste one of their best dishes, Shrimp al' Antonio, for the first time because the people at the next table (who come there every weekend, btw) invited me to partake from the plate they'd ordered. Seriously. \n\nEven the dipping sauce for the bread you get is addicting. I could just have that for my entire meal. I don't mean to talk up the place too much because then, no matter how good the meal is, you'll be disappointed. My one complaint really is that they only serve lunch on Friday & Saturday. Careful with the wine, too; it can get expensive. So next time you're in North Beach, treat yourself--but don't take my word for it. Go in, take a seat, and ask the people at the table next to you :-)", "author": "Thinman M."}

The service throughout the meal was adequate, but a bit slow, assuming they were just having a really busy night as the place was packed. \n\nFood is served family style, and the menu is not lengthy, with typical Italian and pasta dishes. The eggplant parmesan was tasty, but the skin was overdone and could have been better. Shrimp and scallop pasta was ok, too, but with such high prices, I could have stayed home and had better.

With family in town and the sister wanting seafood, I first chose North Beach as a location since it's a fun area to walk around at night, then Caffe Sport as one of the choices since I knew they offer seafood and have great reviews.\n\nI've read about the decor of this place, but after visiting, I definitely find the decor interesting, yet fun! Although it's kind of crazy and all over the place, nothing about it feels uncomfortable. Very cozy and inviting restaurant.\n\nThe food here is also very good - first off, the sauce they bring you with the fresh bread is excellent. Although their pasta options are limited and only serve over Penne, the dishes are good - I ordered the Pasta Vongole (clams), and it comes with their pink sauce (or as the server described, a mixture of cheese sauce and red sauce). The sauce is great and seafood was fresh.\n\nThe only gripe I had during our visit was the order that our dishes were brought to us. We had a party of six and two of our orders came out, then another 10-15 minutes later, the other four came out. By the time everyone else's orders came out, we were already done (usually of course I would wait for everyone else's food to come out to start, but we began waiting so long that it was better to eat it than let it all go cold).\n\nService is friendly, beer & wine only.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

When we were deciding on a bottle of wine for the meal the waiter choose a couple of bottles which were not up to par so we asked for some more selections. 10 minutes later the waiter brought back a few more bottles which were somewhat better. \n\nThe food was probably the single worst portion of the experience on top of it being my girlfriends birthday. Sauces were very bland, the plate of uncut lettuce which was their version of a house salad was bland and had little taste to their sysco based dressing. All the dishes we had were pretty much shit and that's coming from a non snobby very easy to please individual. The \"chef\" kept coming out with different plates of shit and basically threw them on our table without a single gesture of hospitality or asking our meal was going. \n\nBy the end of the experience everyone was pretty annoyed with how shitty the service as well as the food was. On the brighter hand the setting of the place was really legit and the family style menu was a good concept expecially since we were in a group but do yourselves a favor and get better chefs not just your average Mexican from the mission. \n\nOnly giving this place 2 stars because of the decor but besides that save your money and go somewhere else.", "author": "Mike T."}

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!\n\nThe lobster with pasta and cream sauce just missed the mark - lobster was tough, and the sauce did not have the richness that a good cream and garlic sauce demands.  The once proud desert choices now feature a frozen tiramisu.  In the \"old days\" they served deserts from local Italian bakeries.\n\nThe service was \"enthusiastic\" but untrained.

This place is located in the heart of Little Italy (on Green, I believe), so it's perfect to stop by for dinner after a long day of strolling around SF.\n\nEverything was served family style, and our food literally came out in less than five minutes! We ordered Pasta with clams (Vongoles), and some creamy shrimp dish (I really with I knew Italian, sorry), and they were both DELICIOUS! My mouth is watering up just thinking about the clams... ohhh man the clams. So good. And the sauce was goooood too.\n\nAnd they have an amazing staff!

(unless I get my nails done, hair done & errrrrrything) But this place would get a thumbs up from even the bay areas self proclaimed reigning guido kings & guidette queens. \n\nThis is not a pseudo Italian chain place. To my extreme surprise, when the waiter came, it was not one of my fellow Mexican paisas, but a nice young Italian guy who I could barely understand (in any case, almost a paisa since they both no speak pa-pa-pa-americano)\n\nThey start you automatically off with some bread and dipping sauce- apparently laced with heroine because it is so damn good, you'll be trying to sell yourself in exchange for more. \n\nDon't sell yourself too cheap though, because the actual entree sizes are HUGE and DELICIOUS. We got a seafood pasta plate and a spinach veggie plate, but ended up leaving with plenty of leftovers. Though food is delicious, be aware that it is rich and heavy with cream, fat, calories, and butter, so you'll end up leaving the place looking more like Fat Tony than Sofia Loren. \n\nPlace has a great homey-family-feel and really nice decorating, despite a bit of an unoriginal name for the place.

I'm usually not a fan of North Beach because of how crowded it is and how difficult it is to find parking and despite the fact that the parking was still nowhere close to being easy, the restaurant made me forget it all! The service was good, the waiter was attentive and nice. They have a simple menu and everything on there is basically meal size, no appetizer sizes! So for those of you with light appetites, you're either bringing home leftovers or you'll be wasting a lot of food!\n\nThe plates that come out are pretty much family style because of the size. It's not as big as Bucca di Beppo but for an Italian restaurant it's pretty big -- I'd share one dish would feed 2-3 people. Beware though if the menu says that it has garlic in it, whether it's a garlic cream sauce, or it's just a garlic dressing, they are not kidding. They load on the garlic, this place should be known as the Stinking Rose. I can taste the garlic much more than at Stinking Rose, and it's in a good way even if everyone else I talk to that night doesn't think so. \n\nSo if you're looking for a family style restaurant then this is the place. But beware the garlic and if you have a larger group, they don't have much space to accommodate. I think they have maybe 2 or 3 spots for larger groups and past that you'll have to break your group up unless you want to wait, even with reservations. Bon appetit!", "author": "Ellen C."}

A company recruiting me to come work in San Francisco took me there for dinner. Up until then I was not sure I wanted to make the move from Phoenix. That clinched the deal (seriously). The ambiance, setting, staff and the FOOD!! Other reviewers have hit it on the head. The Con Pesto and Scampi are signature dishes and incredible. Don't expect some sort of foodie light and subtle faire here. It is real, substantive and spicy (as in garlic and basil). When I lived there in the 80's you could not think of going without reservations made the Tuesday of the week you were going, so I was surprised to hear someone say reservations aren't necessary.\n\nThe staff is great. Once I took a friend from the East. The waiter asked if we wanted to order any wine. My friend broke out his sommelier act and began talking about his preferences by label and vintage. The waiter just rolled his eyes, tapped him gently on the shoulder and said \"no no no, red or white\".

Service was horrible and slow, waiter very inattentive and forgetful.

Took over 20 minutes after we were seated to even get bread or offered of a drink.\nOrdered meals and were served about 20 minutes or so after, so that wasn't too bad at all. Waiter dropped off our food, and did not come back to check on the meal for at least another 20 - 30 min +. When he came back I had to ask for Parmesan cheese and S&P (because my Linguine with clams was so bland), He went off without letting us finish telling him about the rest of the meal.  My wife was not happy with her \"World Famous\" Pesto Gnocchi. It was way overboard on the garlic. Yes, we know Pesto is supposed to be Garlicky, but this was way over the top. Waiter finally came over again at the end of our meal and asked how it was. My wife had only eaten a few bites of her dish, and we mentioned that it had way too much garlic. Waiter told us they were a Garlic restaurant and they were famous for the dish. I explained that we both love garlic, but this was way too strong. Funny that the Linguine with clams was supposed to have garlic in it, but I could hardly taste any garlic in it. They must have used it all on the WF Pesto. He said we should have told him earlier and he would have brought her something else, but I mentioned that this was the first time he came by our table to ask about the meal, (40 minutes later)and he stated that they were really busy, and there were only two waiters working....He didn't apologize or offer to reduce the meal pricing or anything to make it right.

There is no bad seat in the restaurant because there's always something to look at. I adore all the dishes here. Even the bread dip is amazing! My two favorite dishes I can think of off the top of my head are the pesto and the calamari. The calamari is perfectly cooked where it's not rubbery in any way and the cream sauce compliments is superbly. Remembering the dishes makes me want to fly down and take a friend to dinner there. I loved sitting in the back when I was little and watching Antonio's head peek out through the kitchen. It's such a great family atmosphere here!", "author": "Josie V."}

This is a great place for groups and first dates - there's a lot of room and a lot to look at. It's family style food, so you can try a bunch of dishes, share with your date/family, get really full and take things home. The decorations in here is enough to make you want to stay, but the service will also make you smile. If it's not totally family owned, it's close; making for a very genuine experience here.

But it does have something to do with good eatin'.\n\nMyriad of hung artwork surrounds you on all dimensions excluding the floor. I have no clue how they're hung on the ceiling. Tables and benches are hand-carved and hand-painted. Everything is truly ornate.\n\nVongole is delightful with wine sauce and freshly baked bread is perfect for sopping it. Pasta arrived almost soupy. The point here isn't to be authentic. I would call it \"North Beach twist\" to a Sicilian cuisine. The penne is soft, shrimps plumped, beef is tender, and the sauce is a well-balanced combination of tangy tomato and creamy roux in the French style. It works so well I decided they have a winning recipe I wish I had.\n\nThe restaurant is small and reservation is suggested. We came early when tables were open, but don't always count on that.", "author": "Trung N."}

They only give you 2 baskets for free bread, and then start charging for every basket after that.  I went with a relatively large group, and the bread basket should be proportionate for the size of the group.  Plus, it would've been good to have more for the sauces from the entrees.  \n\nThe main dishes come in small-ish serving sizes, not worth the price.  Also, the only pasta they seem to use is penne, regardless of what you order.  The food comes out really quick.  Suspiciously quick, which leads me to believe the food is all premade.  Furthermore, the eggplant dish we order came out tasty, but barely warm. \n\nOn a more positive note, the decor is interesting with a lot of things to look at.

This is the second time my group of friends made reservations here for a birthday.  The first time I couldn't go, but had to hear from all my friends about how DELICIOUS everything was.  So I was VERY excited about getting the chance to go to Caffe Sport.  I used to live in the 'hood, and Columbus Cafe is one of my fave bars to hang out and watch sports at, so finding another good spot on the block (aside from the tiny pizza joint that sells square pizza out the window) was very welcome.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and just order the eggplant parmagiana as soon as you are seated (maybe two or three, depending on how large the group is).  Top some of the melanzane on some bread, as a proper warning to your stomach that the food will be coming out, sauced up, cheesed up, and fast!  From there, my friends and I ordered like 4 dishes at one time (all pasta) and about 10 minutes later, they all came out.  Hmm, pre-made sauce & heatlamp?  Anywho, the dishes were decent, nothing fantastic.  Pluses:\n*  Cioppino in salsa rossA was good, although this really should be a soup\n*  Salsa Verda was good, with a good dressing. (highly suggest getting a salad as all the dishes were a bit heavy)\n*  Sopping up the remaining sauces with bread was super fun and yummy.\n\nNegatives:\n*  What was the melted cheese on the lobster shell all about?\n*  Violation of the Italian cardinal rule re: parmesan on a fish pasta - Mamma would be quite disappointed (Cazzo!)\n*  No  homemade pasta\n\nWhy the A-ok instead of the Meh?  It's a good place for groups, intimate atmosphere, and each dish is family style, so there's a lot of interaction. The food is decent enough to share, and the price isn't too bad.  I guess you can also go to Bocce Cafe just up the street.", "author": "Ria D."}

Though the restaurant itself is a bit small, it makes up for itself in different ways. For one, the inside is simply amazing, It's lively and there are trinkets all over the place, and pictures all over the walls. The food itself was delicious. We ordered the Pasta with Eggplant, Pasta with Clams, Pasta with Meat and Mushrooms, Calamari, and Steamed Muscles. They were all delicious, even the bread and dipping sauce that was provided.\n\nHowever, beware! The portions may look a bit small, but they are the right size. Additionally, if garlic is not your thing, it's best avoid this place, as not only is the restaurant decked out in garlic, but also your food.

I believe it's anchovies?? At least that what I recall the waiter told me.  Somebody correct me if I'm wrong!  I know it sounds kinda gross right?  But not at all, it tastes really good.  The anchovies must be blended very finely with the tomato sauce that you don't taste any anchovies and we eat enough of it that by the time the food comes, we're kind of full already.

The food is family style & large portions so definately a share place. I thought the food was pretty good. Not the most outstanding flavors, but very fresh and it was reasonably priced. We had the crab filled ravioli's , the house salad, the red sauce ciopinot & an eggplant appetizer. All were very tasty.

I am very critical of seafood dishes around the $25 range per plate.    In this case I was very pleased with what was in front of me.  The shrimp scampi had large prawns that took more than half the plate along with tender vegetables.  The prawns were cooked right which also had a cold sauce on top.  This was rich and delicious.  The calamari dish with the red sauce was awesome as well.  The squid wasn't at all tough and the pasta was cooked al dente.  I hate mushy pasta which really pisses me off.  The family style portions make up for the price tag.  Come over with a group of people and come hungry.  Finally, try the tiramisu, it has just the right amount of liquor to top off your meal.

And I can say with confidence we both enjoyed the Tiramisu we split.  The food showed  no hint of culinary genus but it was quickly served and very satisfying, as it should have been for  about thirty dollars a person (with tip).

The bread is weak, but the sauces are phenomenal, just so flavorful and authentic, very fresh, tomatoey and garlicky.  I've been incredulous to hear some people comment that they prefer other places, like Sodini's further up the block on Green or North Beach Restaurant on Stockton, and I've been to these and others just to verify --- there is no comparison, or as they say in Spanish, NADA QUE VER! One of those friends is British, so maybe that explains it, but why does it seem like \"good taste\" is sometimes so elusive to people's palettes???  If there's a better place, I definitely want to know about it! \r\n\r\nIt's more kitsch than romantic, with wacky and colorful trinkets, hams, fishing nets, and other doodads all over the walls and each booth looks like it was decorated by pre-schoolers with access to a paint set, a garage sale, and a glue gun. The joking, good natured, casual, energetic, attentive waiters will sit down at your table, flirt with your date and, it's true, they'll sometimes even tell you what to order, but you don't regret it!  They used to try to seat you with strangers when it was crowded, but have backed off on that -- thankfully, 'cause that can be a very hit-or-miss affair!  But it's brimming with unique character. \r\n\r\nThere's one Italian waiter left, but most of the staff is from El Salvador and Guatemala, and when the Sicilian owner Tony La Tona passed away a couple of years ago, the Guatemalan assistant of 17 years took over in the kitchen. Tony never shared his recipes with ANYone, not even the other chefs, but after 17 years they got the gist, and it's still an exquisite gustatory experience. One time there we ran into the soccer star El Magico --- the Pele of El Salvador --- and he was humble, chatty and said he eats there every time he comes to SF.\r\n\r\nI recommend the eggplant parmesan and the calamari Ala' Antonio (in garlic white sauce). Plates are generous and about $15 bucks, which I consider very reasonable for what you get, almost always enough for tomorrow's lunch or dinner too. Tony's archetypal Sicilian wife (who's lived here forever but still doesn't speak much English) and rotund son are still there many nights and will enjoy your comments and feedback.", "author": "David H."}

This may be why I was amazed to walk through North Beach on a Saturday night and happily decide to eat at one of the seemingly hundreds of cheesy Italian restaurants.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and the the atmosphere.  The family style servings were a fun treat for my party of six - it was a little difficult to manage the many different dietary needs- one wheat allergy, one seafood allergy and a vegetarian.  (What the hell does that leave you at an Italian restaurant?!)\n\nThe meat dish - cheesy and delicious.\n\nThe sauted calamari was covered with a simple marinara sauce - almost like I can make at home.  So simple, but utterly yum!\n\nI save the best for last  - the mussels were fantastic - who can deny  mussels covered with some concoction of garlic / butter / olive oil / cheese?\n\nI left feeling full, but not overly stuffed and terribly pleased at the reasonable price we all paid.", "author": "Krissy M."}

Because we didn't understand everything they were saying, when they asked questions we thought they were talking to us in general about football.  They paid a lot of attention to us and would kinda linger and chat.  Toward the end of the night we had finally figured out why they were giving us so much attention.  When we left they asked him for an autograph and he signed the name of some guy that had just signed for the raiders.  He didn't want to disappoint them after all that.

I still don't understand if this is correct protocol, but I had a warrant, and I was serving it.  \n\nThey serve large glasses of wine, large portions of pasta, and large salads.  The two of us split a salad and ordered pasta and clams (YAY!), and pasta marinara (BOO!).

And the Alla Panna was sinfully creamy.\n\nThe atmosphere here is absolutely perfect, with the server wandering around the restaurant chatting up patrons and each other. \"Perfect atmosphere\" may well mean you don't get your check for 15 minutes after they cleared your table, but have a conversation with the people you ate with and flag down that server when he does come by like you mean it.

I didn't know where I was, or how to get back, or even really the name of the place, but I do remember that the family style dishes they served were fan-fricken-tastic! Finally years later I went back and holy shit - how could I have been gone so long? Caffe Sport is great because of the location, the decor, certainly the waiters (who are either hilariously funny or such assholes its hilarious!), but really its the food that will get you going back. I went with a party of 9 - ordered 7 dishes and a couple bottles of wine and everyone walked out the door much happier, and only $24 poorer, than when they walked in.\n\nBy the way - We got Luciano (Sp?) as our Waiter and he definitely falls into the hilariously funny category. He was awesome.\n\nUPDATE: Been here WAY more than twice now, and still loving it!", "author": "Jeff S."}

It's straight forward simple Italian food--heavy on the garlic, cheese and tomatoes--all served on plastic plates.\n\n I don't think the portions are that big, they look bigger than they really are. Two pastas and one seafood dish is sufficient for 3-4. Try the mussels (cozze). The white wine/garlic sauce is straightforward and delicious as is the Pasta w/funghi and meat and Rustica All Antonio (seafood).\n\nAs for the sauce that a few novice palates have referred to as mayonnaise, it's an Italian bechamel (becciamel or something like that). Essentially, bechamel with garlic. And the joker that said the pesto was greasy--what do you think is one of the 3 main ingredients in any pesto? Olive oil--hmm wonder why it's greasy? \n\nAlso, the no credit cards is very common in \"Family Style\" Italian restaurants. It's a lot easier to launder money when there isn't a paper trail. I lived in South Philly, and many of the real  joints don't take cards. If you find that unusual, you have probably never been to the real authentic joints in So. Philly or New York. These are run by gumbahs(hard to define), not Culinary Institute grads with backings by Pat Kuleto. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and most have been there for years. Also it's good for Spanish speaking visitors--most of the staff either speaks Spanish or understands enough to alter their Italian to an understandable Spatalian.", "author": "Hank S."}

After my experience as this delightful establishment, I could never again tilt my hat to the Gods of Cuisine, unless I first paid my due homage to the Caffe Sport.  My Aunt who has lived in San Francisco since the 1960's, said this was the best Italian restaurant in town - where the \"locals\" go.  The Caffe has a very modest outside fa\u00e7ade, and is located in the North Beach district.  Last night my family and I dined here, and couldn't believe the relentlessly fantastic level of food, service and atmosphere.  The decor is wickedly amazing - it's a floor to (and on) ceiling decoration of, well, everything.  Every square foot contains something wild and different.  You won't get bored looking around this place.  We were ushered in to a side booth that was almost a semi-private room, bordered only by the entrance and carved wooden slats.  After my Aunt confirmed they still served \"family style,\" we ordered lobster and a number of pasta dishes including shrimp/scampi, eggplant, and cheese spinach ravioli.  The wine list (I wanted a red) mostly (exclusively?) consisted of Italian wines I'd never heard of.  I asked the waiter which of a couple of choices I selected he'd recommend.  He asked if I liked full or medium bodied reds and I replied, \"either.\"  He said something about seeing what he had.  A few moments later he came back with opened bottles of both wines - and two glasses.  He poured tasting samples (almost full glasses, actually) and invited me to take a moment and decide.  My wife and I tasted both which were incredible (both bottles were priced at $44.).  Our waiter returned and we selected the \"Gergenti.\"  He promptly brought and opened a full bottle.  We'd never experienced this extremely generous treatment in over 30 years of fine dining through much of the USA, and I myself am a national recognized wine maker (I own and operate the Lynn Abigail Winery).  By this point in our experience, I was deeply in love with this place.  It appeared we had not one, but three waiters devoted to our care.  We never had to ask, and never wanted for anything at any time.  It was like you were \"their\" family and they badly wanted you to feel at home and have a great experience.  The food - all of the food - simply made the experience absolutely orgasmic.  Everything seemed to be the best of \"that\" thing we'd ever had.  I rarely get to San Francisco.  I will never do so again without dining at the Caffe.  Why should you dine here as well?  Why indeed!", "author": "Dinko W."}

However, as to the restaurant itself it is in a word I suppose 'eclectic'.  I understand that the owner made and collected the knick knacks that are posted all over the walls.  But the d\u00e9cor was not the problem.  The food was.  Firstly the menu is terribly limited and the prices are very expensive.  The wine list is also limited, but we settled on a bottle of pinot grigio.  It was terrible tasting and did not taste like any pinot grigio I've ever tasted.  It was very brash and horrid.  The food itself was not anything spectacular nor tasted too good.  For one thing the cioppino was overpowered by too much garlic that was still raw.  The other dishes like the pasta con vongole were just ok but overpriced for what was served.  I am sorry to say that the desserts are really nothing but two choices:  House made tiramisu and cannoli.  And if you are unlucky like our table was all of the tiramisu sold out leaving the only choice of cannoli. The problem with the cannoli is that it's not fresh.  The guy just took some from a cardboard box and filled them with some sort of cream and dried fruit.  It just did not taste good.  And it's not cheap either at $8/each.

My opinion is there's really nothing special about the food. The decor is the only thing that  makes this place unique,  and it's worth one visit.\n\nMy husband and I stopped in on a Thursday night and got a table with no wait. The menu looked like its been in print for years, which might explain why, when my husband asked about making a slight substitution (he does this everywhere, and no one has ever said no), he was told absolutely not. The dishes were traditional and couldn't be changed, as if the cooks were programmed to cook these recipes only, which made me suspicious... why can't you throw in a few clams instead of a lobster tail?  We also saw cauliflower being served a few tables away that looked sooo good but were told that it wasn't available to the public (meaning us).\n\nThe meal was good enough, We started with the green salad for two, which was absolutely drenched in dressing. The pasta with tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil was tasty, although I had expected actual tomatoes tossed with pasta. instead was served pasta with red sauce.  Okay, the tomatoes were there, but why not just call it red sauce? The prawns would have been fine except for the thick white sauce on top that was uninteresting and, well, thick. We both loved the bread and slightly spicy dipping sauce. \n\nOverall, it was a good enough meal accompanied by friendly service. But next time I'm in North Beach,  I think I'll go around the corner and have pasta at Ideale.   Ciao!", "author": "Diane J."}

The street is still outside.  Stop irritating the poor couple behind us.  They do not care that your lobster pasta is \"f#*kin' awesome\" and they really don't want me to take a picture of all three of you.\" \n- Sam Granat's offering on North Beach's Caffe Sport  (San Anselmo's favorite yelper!)  \n\nAfter a long walk from The Mission to Pier 39 then up to North Beach (looking for a place that would accept my debit card), my date and I were really thirsty and hungry (and tired) and one of us was getting angrier by the moment.  I was kicked out of Golden Boy Pizza for throwing coins at the off-duty meter maid sitting at the counter with a veggie slice, grumbling at the blinking Hummer double-parked outside.  And the place next door to that wouldn't let me in because of a temporary inability to walk forward without first falling backwards.  Then... finally... \n\n\"Caffe Sport: a narrow passageway with big everything - - -  wow  - - - and affordable prices.\" \n- Don McPherson (Vacaville's own)  \n\nI couldn't say it better myself.\n\nWhat can I say about the place, then?  It's a wild ride ... (I only remember being here because someone managed to snap a photo of me bracing the bench during gravity checks.)  The karaoke machine in my head was barking digits to my tongue in sectional codes.  My brain was laughing while my smile was trying to do all the talking.  My head editor was away and not taking any of these calls.  Luckily, it was a busier night here, out there. The white aprons were misplacing the kitchen appliances in their improper order - well, the whole staff of three had plenty of things on their minds.  And the patrons were more interested in talking about their netflix queues than about me and my date arguing about the Italians on the wall.  \n\nNo, everything was in control - in chaos...  The waiter impressed even the half-dead with fancy footwork from kitchen to table and back again.  Behind the scenes, the dishwasher was winning the war against pots and pans running into each other for no known reason.  The heavyweight forks on the table wouldn't stop sliding around until finally smothered by a cloth napkin.  Then, came the small guy with the big voice throwing down the noodles with a sloppy blanket of pesto sauce - and a dauntless grin.  I will always remember how that first bite made me forget about the dwindling flame in my brass wine bucket.  The garlic took hold and everything became heavenly like bread beckoning for oily green dipping.  My palate was charcoal by the end of the night, but the music was clear like the brush strokes of a skilled painter as the wine began opening up.  My belt was loosened and the table no longer threatened to suffocate me.  The narrow hallway they called a restaurant no longer made me fearful of never hearing your laughter again.  I had finally made it.", "author": "Kenny R."}

But that doesn't stop me from devouring the sauce that they bring with the bread... I don't know what it is, but it's like garlic crack! Other favorites include the mussels and the scampi (especially when they serve it with asparagus).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-03", "description": "We tried Caffe Sport last night after many years of absence. While the interior remains the same, the dining experience and taste of the food do not compare to the original \"Caffe Sport.\" On the plus side, the portions are still generous (large enough to share) and we found the prices to be very reasonable considering the prime location in North Beach. For example, a party of two could eat for about $30-40 out the door by sharing a mixed salad ($7) and a pasta such as Penne with Pesto ($15 +/-) plus an optional 1/2 liter of house Chianti ($8). This would be more than enough food for most people as the portions are generously oversized. \n\nOn the flip side, the taste of the food doesn't match up to the old Caffe Sport. Apparently the original chef passed away (according to what I've read online) and the trade secrets lost along the way. Although the food tasted fresh, it lacked the \"punch\" that it used to have. The Pesto was OK, but not exceptional. It wasn't the vibrant green color, but more of a muted green and without the customary garlicky nutty punch (the Pesto at Amici's East Coast Pizzeria is superior, by comparison -- especially when requested with \"extra garlic\").\n\nGone also are the huge tiger prawns that Caffe Sport were renowned for -- although we did try the Scampi (Prawns) All'Antonio -- which was served in a creamy white garlic sauce. The portion was generous and included sauteed asparagus cooked al dente -- but the sauce wasn't the typical garlic-white wine sauce you might expect, but more of a soupy mixture of mayonnaise, garlic, and herbs. This dish is not reminiscent of true Italian cooking and would have been much better in a lighter garlic sauce without all the mayonaise and/or cream. \n\nWe also tried the steamed clams, which were full of minced garlic in a nice white wine and lemon broth. This was a better tasting sauce and had we known, we would have asked for the prawns to be prepared in the same manner. \n\nAlso missing from the \"Caffe Sport\" experience (and only those who've been here in the original days would relate) -- is the \"rude\" service with an Italian attitude. While the service was OK this time, there wasn't the same \"personality\" and flair of the old Caffe Sport. Part of what made Caffe Sport famous were the lively waiters who'd yell in Italian -- and even give customers a hard time (as part of the experience) -- which made it a unique place in the City. In the past, sometimes they would bring you something different than what you ordered or argue with you about your choice of entree -- and tell you, \"take it or leave it.\" But that was part of the fun of Caffe Sport and what made it distinctive. Interestingly, we were also able to get a reservation for four at prime time on a Saturday night -- just a few hours before arriving spontaneously. In the past, reservation weren't even a possibility -- you had to arrive early -- and line up outside -- and even wait for 1-2 hours for a table.....that's how popular it was. The lack of line on a Saturday tells me that Caffe Sport has lost some of its following. That's not to say this place was empty -- it was full, in fact..and we still had to wait for 15 minutes for our table for 4. \n\nAll in all, Caffe Sport today is a decent place....just that I miss the old Caffe Sport -- and this last visit just didn't live up to our earlier experiences in terms of food preparation and edgy service. Maybe we're just nostalgic for the good old days -- and this shouldn't take away from the overall good value that today's Caffe Sport offers....but for those of us who've experienced the old and the new, there's a clear difference now...so if it's been a while since you've been there, don't expect to recreate the same experience as before. \n\nOverall, Caffe Sport deserves 3 stars for an overall balance of decent food, generous portions, reasonable prices, and quirky atmosphere....but there are several places in the City that now offer tastier food prepared with more skill also at reasonable prices -- such as Lupa near Castro (see my other review) and Pazzia on 3rd, among others. We probably would not go out of our way to return to Caffe Sport anytime soon -- although it could be fun with a larger group where the atmosphere is conducive to eating lots of carbs...along with some inexepensive Chianti...

One warning though...  if you are going to get the prawns in light garlic sauce, be prepared to be tasting it all night.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but when sharing a cab with strangers hours later, you might want to hold that burp in until you get to you destination.

It's bursting with flavors and has a creamy spicy overtone. For the life of me, I can't figure out what is in it (neither can ex-chef hubby) but it was so good I almost wanted to drink it. Seriously, trust the other Yelpers on this one. ** The Rustica all'Atonio doesn't list it on the menu, but had small clams (little-neck maybe?) in addition to the shrimp and scallops. This was so tasty even a non-seafood lover like myself loved it. * *We think there were ever-so-small bits of carrot in the Con carne e funghi (bolognese) sauce which if true, attests to the culinary skill of Mr. La Tona. Tomato-based sauces often require a pinch of sugar to balance out the acidity, but then chefs run the risk of adding too much sugar making the sauce taste \"fake.\" If sweet carrots were indeed used (how clever!), Caffe Sport gets kudos for it! * There was so much food that 2 pasta entrees + 1 salad (w/ bread + dipping sauce) lasted for 2 people to have dinner, lunch then next day, then dinner again. To top it off, I thought I would have gained 5 lbs. from eating all that cheese and oil (as I do whenever we eat Italian), but Caffe Sport must use some kind of magic because even after wolfing all of that down, I didn't gain a single ounce. Good quality and great tasting Italian can be found afterall....", "author": "Colleen L."}

This seemed more like a tourist trap along the lines of Olive Garden (food quality) or Buca de Beppo (decor).\nAll pasta (penne) had clearly come from one giant vat in the back. Every single dish was covered in cheese (we had two people in our group who had lactose issues so this was problematic--they wouldn't even try to adhere to our request to put it on the side).\nThe service was sub-par--we never had enough water, and our wine wasn't served until we were almost finished with dinner, it took a very long time just to get the bill and pay.\nWe had an out of town guest with us and I was really embarrassed at the quality of the food--most places in SF have to adhere to some level of food quality to say in business. This was sub-par, even for a mediocre restaurant.\nDo yourself the favor and make your own Italian food at home (or Luca take out--much better, authentic Italian quality and cheaper than this place) or go to a really good Italian restaurant like Flour and Water or Beretta (honestly, they don't cost that much more).", "author": "J L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-02", "description": "ok... so my friend Josh and I decided that we wanted to have a light salad and maybe a drink.  I met him after work and we walked up to North Beach.  We tried to go to Sardino's ??  You know, that totally traditional and awesome Italian restaurant in North Beach?  Anyhoo, it was packed full of yuppies and we couldn't even try to belly up to the bar, so we walked back down the street.  Disappointed cuz it smelled REALLY good in there.  Like old Italian wine breath, and I really do mean that in a good way.  We were in a lacksidasical mood and neither of us really cared to take the lead and make the next decision. \n\nWe kinda paused in our walk because we couldn't decide.  Josh noticed a big fat lady on a tiny little patio outside the door and because she was so fat and the patio was so small, we looked inside the door.  Inside was a veritable cornucopia of colors, textures, noises, and men in white t-shirts bustling about.  I mean we are talking gingerbread palace.  Not a square inch of that place was anything close to bare wall.  It was all really weird and unidentifiable stylistically to me.  I should know because I work on a design show for HGTV, but I didn't.  There was also a table of screaming ladies.  We kinda poked our way in, not sure that this was the place we wanted to be.. and then a small grey haired Italian man ushered us into a table with 4 really humongous spoons on it.  We thought the table wasn't set... and felt a little flustered at being placed... but still went along.  Menu's arrived, along with some cutlery, but the spoons were never removed... making us feel like our table was maybe forgotten.. .like us.  We went back and forth over whether we should leave.  I didn't see any salad on the menu and the prices were a little higher than I wanted.  Josh said not to worry cuz he was paying cuz it was my birthday.  Then I saw at the very bottom of the simple menu of only fish and pasta options, a Salat Verte.  I imagined a sad little salad with a few beet stings and a carrot string, you know the type you get at tourist restaurants claiming to be the best, and tried to make Josh decide to leave again... but we stayed, he was annoyed that I wouldn't just make a decision.  I decided that the style of the restaurant was \"Old Italian Hansel and Grettle crazy gingerbread house import all weird things from Italy extravaganza with screaming girls and old italian waiters.\"  The girls were actually quite funny.  We ordered: the salat verte, a double order cuz we were imagining the sad salad and the dover sole sauteed with lemon, garlic and butter.  I ordered a sprite, which came immediately, and Josh ordered an Italian import beer which took three requests to appear.  The four spoons remained on the table the whole time.\n\nThe salad came.  It was a HUGE plate, easily enough for four people, delivered with an \"I told you so\" from our Italian waiter.  To his credit, he did say that a single salad would be enough.  He also plunked one of the big spoons into the salad.  So we weren't forgotten.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  Large pieces of romain with green olives and just a smattering of red onion sliced thin.... but the dressing OH THE DRESSING... It was like a pesto ceasar and I swear to you I have never had anything this delicious in my whole life.  Garlicy, strong, creamy pesto.  I noticed a handwritten sign on one of the many carved posts in the room that said something like: Alfredo da chef make a da best pesto but only he can make it\".... and he was right, who ever he was.   \n\nOur waiter came back and actually actually asked us \" you like-a-da-sauce?\"  We could only nod, our mouths full of crispy lettuce and tangy olives... da sauce dripping off of our chins.\n\nThen he delivered our Sole. Another spoon got plunked onto the dish. OH mY GOD AGAIN!  crisp little pieces of tiny asparagas covered the fish, fresh, a whole boneless side of the dover sole and yes, lots of butter and garlic and lemon.   We ate like old italians I'm sure.\n\nAs we came to near bursting point, I realized that we had never inquired as to the name of this restaurant... We asked the \"like-a-da-sauce\" waiter and he pointed to his T-shirt.  CAFFE SPORT? we both said out loud.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, how misleading can a name be?  No sport paraphanelia, and except for the screaming girls, no tourists for that matter, and did I mention the pesto salad dressing?  The restaurant should have been called Caffe King of Pesto...   So the waiter came to check on us one last time and Josh offered him his credit card.  Like-a-da-sauce grabbed a menu and politely showed Josh that they don't take cards... nice and old school, just the way it should be. There was an ATM nearby and at the end of our meal, the waiter finally removed the unused spoons, making us feel quite special indeed.", "author": "emily h."}

The owner sat down with us and told us how his buddy made the Zebibo (dessert wine).  We had the green salad and the meat and mushroom pasta, a cappuchino and a glass of dessert wine and all were great.

Yes, the decor is cute, but who cares when the food isn't that great. We came here for my friends b-day dinner, ordered maybe 8 dishes for 8 people including salad. It was hard to tell, bc everything was ordered family style so I wasn't exactly sure what the \"portion\" sizes were. What did I like? Ummm.... the salad??? The pasta was not that awesome. If you dine here I would stick to the seafood. The clams in white wine and garlic sauce were pretty good and the cioppino was ok although not very authentic. Every other place I've had cioppino, it was served in more of a broth. This cioppino here was like a mound of shellfish lathered in tomato paste. Service was mediocre. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for dishes we ordered that never actually arrived. This also happened to the table next to us. Seriously? Who forgets an entire dish? Plus one star for the free slice of b-day cake.", "author": "Lauren Y."}

My father \"Andy Romano-Romasanta\" \"The Jolly Green Giant \" and my mother are great friends with Tony LaTona the owner. We always loved going there to eat when we would drive up from Santa Barbara CA.  Tony would always take us on tours of the kitchen and take us up into the attic where he was making a tiny  5 foot sail boat that he had built by hand,  he also made all the furniture and chairs etc. in his restaurant. He was always cooking in the kitchen and his waiters never spoke English just broken English mixed with Italian. So special to eat at Caffe Sport, always mixing it up with other people at the table. The food is nothing you have ever seen before. Just as if you were in Italy! The menu I remember was hand written by Tony and the platters of food piled high to the hilt. Tasty and filling. My fathers picture was up on the wall the last time I was there and that is special to me to cherish these memories. I cant wait to visit again but I am now up in Sequim Wa kinda far away but I hope to one day be there to bring my 2 children to experience the great memories that me and my sister Shawna did. Boy am I jealous of all of you that get to experience Caffe Sport and the great experience. MMMM good. See you soon Tony!! Oh my gosh after reading the comments I just see that Tony has passed away, oh my gosh I am so saddened. I just wanted to see him one more time and taste his magnificent food and I see that I will never get that chance again nor my children. I don't even know if my father knows that he has passed away either being I know he hasn't been to San Fran for a long time. God Bless you Tony and may the lord hold you in his hands for eternity. You fed the world a beautiful and delicious mouthful of Italian flavors and I will always have my memories. God Bless your family. I hope your cooking up a storm in the skies above us........till we meet again one day my friend!!!!", "author": "Briana R."}

I've heard great reviews, so-so reviews, and semi-bad ones. Last night, wandering around North Beach, we decided to finally try it out. When we walked in we were the only people there. It was 7 p.m., which for North Beach is like the early bird special. We shrugged, settled into an uncomfortable booth, looked around at the quirky artistic display and started perusing our laminated, one-page menu. I was a little confused by the menu and didn't quite get that it was divided by red sauces and white sauces. (my boyfriend explained that to me after I ordered). We already knew it was supposed to be family style, but I don't eat meat and my compatriot really wanted meat. So I ordered the penne pasta with red sauce and clams and he ordered pasta with meat and mushrooms. We split a green salad, which probably one of the best I've ever had. At first I almost choked because the dressing was so garlicky, but I soon got used to it and began inhaling the finely dressed leaves (did I mention the salad has cheese? any salad is improved 100% with the addition of cheese). Our main courses came out like 7 minutes after we ordered which probably because we were the only ones there, but I was still impressed. My meal was unbelievably great. I don't think I've ever had such flavorful and garlicky pasta before. The clams were cooked perfectly, covered in a creamy red sauce and sprinkled with cheese. It was definitely one of the most intense meals of my life. I'm still breathing garlic and hoping my work buddies won't hide from me all day. I strongly recommend coming here with a lot of people so you can try a bunch of different dishes.", "author": "Sammy S."}

This place is like garlic heaven....when I walked into this place, the great circular rack of garlic on the ceiling told me i was going to have a great meal or at least heart burn....but luckily it was a great meal!  Absolutely wonderful meal, and the restaurant has so much character both in decoration and staff.  I love the old worn tiled booths and tables to match along with the crazy array of things hanging from the ceiling. Its a rustic, warm and cozy kind of place, and the host/owner is definitely old school Italian. And all that adds to the wondeful LARGE plates they serve.  Try the clams vongole (warning:only for garlic lovers), the eggplant parm: melt in your mouth good, and if you really wanna splurge go for the lobster pasta. Oh yeah and dont forget the house salad  for starters and end off with an espresso and tiramisu...BAMMO a wonderful meal at Caffe Sport!", "author": "Maria B."}

Caffe Sport was impressive and lived up to it's Yelp name. The decor and smug attitude of the host (who happened to lose our reservation but was excused on account that he has probably been working there for 20 years) could be replaced but the food made up for it. The special spicy sauce and bread to wet the appetite kept us from getting too tipsy before our delicious seafood delights, it was hard to keep myself from licking the saucer it came in. I ordered the Sole and it was impossibly fresh and perfectly seasoned with my three favorites: garlic, butter, and lemon, it also hosted a gang of perfectly steamed and of course very fresh asparagus. The pasta tasted and felt comforting and warm with yummy gooey cheeses and light, fresh shellfish. A little loud inside on a weekend but it made me feel at home in a strange way, loud and warm is sometimes a good thing when it's cold and foggy outside.", "author": "nina B."}

I have been unlucky with North Beach, without finding an awesome Italian place in a supposedly Italian neighborhood. I have gotten to trust Yelp, and since The Helmand was strangely closed due to a rock slide, my friends and I checked this place out. Decor is VERY unique, with wall to wall knickknacks up the wazoo! Makes for some interesting conversation! The vibe was very boisterous with everyone seeming to share their big plates of heaps of seafood and pasta with gusto. A good sign! We were seated quickly, no wait on a Saturday night! It was cozy, yet not cramped. The wait staff was super friendly, and efficient. We got 3 dishes, a seafood pasta, an eggplant dish, and the seafood stew-type thing. I'm not good with remembering Italian names. We got tons of bread with some yummy dipping sauce. Then the dishes came very quickly. The pasta had amazing flavor. Creamy, yet not heavy. I wanted to lick the plate clean! The eggplant parmigiana was awesome! The seafood plate was super generous too! I wish we got the mussels, as we saw everyone else getting it. It was a HUGE plate of 'em for only $18! They really know how to cook seafood just right, not one piece was overcooked! Three dishes were perfect for 4 hungry people, and ended up being only $18 a person! We got a warm farewell pinch on the cheek from one of the older waiters, which was very cute! I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Joy C."}

The pesto was miraculous, and that garlic-anchovy dipping sauce for the bread was wonderful! Usually the waiters are pleasant and a lot of fun too.  Recently, I had a friend visiting in town for one night, so I thought I'd take him there. I have never ever been so embarrassed in my life. He ordered something that came with cheese, and he didn't realize it because it wasn't in the description. He has Crohn's disease and can't eat cheese. Period. After some debating, he very sheepishly asked if he could order something else. The only time I have seen waitstaff be more rude was at Emmy's (throwing food and yelling: not classy). This waiter harped and harped and harped on my friend about what a big deal it was to send something back and how angry the chef would be and how his night would be ruined because now the chef would be angry at him. We were the only ones in there, was the chef really too busy to scrape off sauce? The waiter came back 3+ times to tell us this what a commotion we had caused in the kitchen and the ensuing fallout. Who is the cook back there, Nicky Santoro? (I watched Casio last night)....My friend was almost positive his new dish probably had spit or something worse in it if they were really that enraged. I was so embarrassed, I felt like I ruined my friend's night. What a bunch of joiks! Their pesto really is the best I have ever had. Many I will have someone get take out for me or something. I'm switching my allegiance back to Rose Pistola.", "author": "Mary G."}

When we first walked in, we weren't sure if we were in the right place but it sure turned out to be! The decor is wacky, crazy and full of life. Not a dull space on any spare inch.  We were not sure if we were going to be able to find what we wanted as the menu is not that big but we decided to stay and give it a shot.  The four of us started with a salad that was EXCELLENT!  Just a plain green romaine salad with green olives and a sort of creamy Italian vinegrette dressing that was superb.  We got our entrees one at a time and in perfect timing that we could all share and eat at a leisurely pace.  Entrees: pasta with a creamy tomato sauce with shrimp and scallops (excellent); petrale sole with fresh veggies (sole was light and perfectly cooked, melting in your mouth while the veggies, asparagus and zuccini, were crisp and perfectly cooked); eggplant parmesan (lightly breaded, small pieces, baked in a tomato sauce.....awesome); and last, scampi (shrimps were large with a thick alfredo sauce on top and once again, those wonderful fresh crispy veggies). If I had to 'complain', which was really hard to do if you saw our empty plates and feeling of satisfaction at being well fed by a very unique spot in SF, it would be the alfredo sauce on the shrimp was a little strange. It wasn't what we thought scampi usually has, but it was different and we did just fine emptying the platter!  Get there early so you can have a table. As we walked out around 6 pm on a Saturday night, the place was packed!", "author": "P G."}
