Today I made an exception, and it was a fabulous call! Not that I get the props--all I did was heed the \"we serve lunch\" sign, and Hogwash did the rest.\n\nI should have known, just by the sacrilegious name. This place specializes in sausage. If you like sausage, keep reading. If you think sausage is evil, keep reading (because you know you're intrigued). \n\nAmong other things, they create several sausage types and serve them up as sandwiches, with exotic things like fried avocado on top. So are all you anti-sausage people back with me when I mentioned avocado? I thought so. Unless you think fried is evil, and I can't help you there. But keep reading for the same reason you read until now.\n\nNearly choosing the Burnin' Brock, which is habanero chicken sausage with aforementioned avocado, I settled on the intentionally vauguely named All Day. This vixen is comprised of pork/maple/ginger breakfast sausage. Breakfast for lunch...and dinner...never a bad choice.\n\nSo imagine that, throw in arugula so my wife thinks I ate healthy, then...then...top it with a duck egg. Oh, and add a side of housemade fries. Can it get better? Maybe, if they added truffle oil, but I won't complain.\n\nThis was an excellent choice, so glad I made it, but you can't go wrong with anything from what I could tell. There's even a Hogless with garbanzo beans (my favorite named bean), for the vegetarians among us.\n\nI'll try really hard to return, maybe when it's not mid-day and  I can partake in the libations.", "author": "Paul V."}

I wish I hadn't ordered a salad afterwards because the salad felt so...unsatisfying afterwards.  Be sure to eat anything else you've ordered first orrrr just get TWO servings of the curry fries and duck egg, if you're hungry.  My boyfriend ordered the vegetarian sausage; we liked the sauce but the it was also only just-ok, relative to the curry fries.\n\nThe bartender was very helpful in selecting a beer for me, as I'm not very big on beer (more of a wine lover).  I'm sure the beer selection turns over a lot (can't find the beer list on the website, so unfortunately I can't tell you what I had... I just know it was 10.5%).  If you aren't sure what to try because you're new to beer, Hogwash is a great place to go.  \n\nThe space is huge with high ceilings in the very front with communal seating and higher tables on the side for groups of 4.  The bar is at the back.  If you sit in the front area, you have to order your food at the bar.  I recommend sitting at the bar if there's only 2 of you, so then you can chat about with the bartenders about beer.

It's a great spot for happy hour beers or people who just like to belly up and talk about beer. Where it's lacking, in my opinion, is their signature draw - the sausage. \n\nThe food overall was solid, but the chicken habanero sausage in my wife's \"Burnin' Brock\" sandwich was dry, a very odd flavor and filled with very long stringy bits of fennel (or something else green) that was off-putting. I liked my Hog Cobb salad very much, with a delicious combination of butter lettuce, soft boiled quail eggs, blue cheese, bacon crumbles and tomato. But the dry smoked chicken sausage it came with didn't seem to match the rest of the dish. The best sausage out of the three was our sons beef, cheddar and bacon, which we only had because they were out of the chicken hot dog that usually comes on the kid's bun. \n\nMaybe my fam just doesn't like chicken sausage, or maybe it was an off day. Overall the food was tasty and the beer selection solid, so that's enough for a return visit.", "author": "Alex L."}

The sausage was surprisingly spicy and juicy. The veggies on top of the sausage tasted fresh and the sauce was good and not too heavy. \n\nThe Sheepish lamb sausage with blue cheese sauce and beets was also pretty good, but the sausage was a bit dry. I think they tried to compensate for this dryness by layering on a bunch of blue cheese sauce (so much that the bun was soaked and dripping). While the sauce was undoubtedly good, it seemed a little bit unnecessary to put so much on the bun, especially because it did not hide the dryness of the sausage at all. \n\nDon't bother with their hot sauce - it was bland and didn't have any kick to it (even when I doused my sausage in it).\n\nThey have a lot of different beers on tap, however it was not the best selection the day I went there. I ended up choosing a Fieldwork hazy IPA, which was delicious.\n\nHogwash has a great vibe - pretty low key and easy to talk to your friends, while also being lively in the background.

After a short survey of the area, we opted for a good choice of frosty beverages and a variety of house-made sausages. \n\nThis is a cool smallish tap room with an extensive listing of regional brews, ciders and small but tasty menu of sausage sandwiches, small plates and fresh salads. Lots is family style seating with a few lounge areas, and window bar stools with counter tops. \n\nI was traveling with my registered medical service animal, and initially the hostess didn't want to allow us in. After a few minutes of conversation we were able to sit up by the front windows for a meal (there obviously needs to be an update on policy and training with this establishment as it's against federal ADA laws to not allow my RMSA with me) This initially confrontation with the hostess and shift manager? made me feel uncomfortable and the need to defend myself for being a disabled veteran and having my registered seizure animal with me.\n\nWalk up counter service for both food and drinks. We decided on what we wanted and ordered at the bar, got a number and sat down. Our drinks came quickly, as did our food. My wife went for the Sheepish (lamb sausage with blue cheese sauce and cabbage)sandwich and myself the Abe Froman (beef, cheddar and bacon sausage with thousand island dressing, romaine, pickles and tomato) along with the Asian pear and arugula salad.\n\nThe sandwiches are huge and could definitely be split between two as well as the salads. My sandwich was tasty a nice combination of flavors with a great bacon cheddar overtone, and the pear arugula salad was a nice portion of fresh spicy greens and sweet pears and it was delicious and large enough to share.\nMy wife said her sandwich was very good too, the lamb sausage was nicely seasoned and the sharpness of the blue cheese with tangy pickled red cabbage, and it was more than she could finish.\n\nAll in all a good place for a bite to eat and a cold drink, worth a visit as long as you're not traveling with your service animal. \n\n3.5 Stars - rounded down instead of up for the initial reception, it's hard to take that first minutes of a bad experience away regardless of the meal.\n\nMay go back but most likely will not.\n\n00526", "author": "Ray F."}

I don't even like beets very much but turning it into a relish offset the earthy flavor and it's sweetness worked well with the blue cheese. The lamb wasn't too gamey but did give the whole thing an extra kick of flavor. Only downside is the size. With the chips it's a light-average meal (4.5/5)\n\nBurnin' Brock: I only took a small bite so I can't fully judge but the sausage itself was tasty and not too spicy initially. It does have a kick afterwards but not so bad where I feel like I'm running for the milk. The pickled cabbage on top works perfectly with it. I still preferred the sheepish but that's just preference (4/5)\n\nHogg Cobb: The only disappointing part of our meal. For $12 it's just not worth it. I would've loved more butter lettuce. There were a lot of salty components but only 5-6 large leaves of lettuce. There were also only 2 quail eggs. Between the bacon crumbles, blue cheese, and a very salty smoked chicken sausage, I really needed more lettuce or eggs to balance it out. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage in general.

You walk inside you see a few tall tables on the left and a few lower tables on the right. Its spread out enough so you don't feel cramped. That's a good thing because this place gets packed after 5. So let's get to the food and drank. We ordered the curry fries and the Burning Brock. Love how crisp the fries are and the curry was not to overpowering. The Burning brock was spicy but not too spicy and all the ingredients were fresh. The drink I ended up getting was the pineapple cider damn that was nice and refreshing.

The restaurant is cozy and there is someone who greets you immediately after you walk in. Their tables are all communal and since we chose a high top (just the two of us), the staff member told us that we would have to share the table if anyone else came in, as the high top can typically fit 6. Luckily, we were able to dine alone while we were here. \n\nYou order at the bar and they give you a number and bring your food out to you. I got the Burnin Brock while the bf got their Sheepish. While my sandwich was ok, I though that the sausage itself was only ok. It was a little too salty for my taste and was pretty small compared to the amount of bread that it comes with. The bf was very disappointed with his Sheepish as it was filled primarily with beets and he ended up scooping a lot of it out. We also ordered an appetizer of the beets with warm goat cheese to start, which was good, although I didn't like that the goat cheese came like a dipping sauce. I was expecting it to be plated, but warm and gooey. Decent, but not sure I'd get that again. \n\nBecause our expectations for this place were high, our overall experience ended up being underwhelming.

They make all their specialty sausage in house and have a plethora of recipes!  If you can't decide on just one, they have a sausage sampler platter that will let you get in on all the sausage action.\n\nI am personally always enticed by anything that has a fried egg on it, and the All Day breakfast sandwich boasted the option of a fried duck egg.  OKAY.  Don't have to twist my arm!  It was wonderful!  The pork sausage was slightly sweet with a hint of maple and had a slight tingle of ginger.  The arugula added an element of peppery surprise!  Lastly, the duck egg was cooked perfectly.  White all the way cooked and crispy around the edges with a slightly runny, messy yolk that coated the entire sandwich.  \n\nI also dined on a side of french fries and fried pickles.  The fried pickles were hand dipped and had a crunchy, hard coating.  They were not super salty and the mayo based dipping sauce had a little bit of heat to it.

Had more of a bite, as opposed to the super soft or soggy texture that can sometimes happen.\n- Double-fried French Fries - crispy of course!  You can taste the extra layer of fat dripping down the back of your throat, haha.  Delicious, but honestly didn't blow me away.\n- All-day Sausage sandwich:  Pork sausage topped w/a fried duck egg.  Good, but wouldn't bring me back for it again.  Could have been juicier and more flavorful.\n- Hogless sandwich:  I'm not a huuuge veg fan, and hate it even more when I have to pay the same price as a meat item....but damn they make a good lentil/garbanzo sausage.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "I've been to Hogwash twice in the past two days as a pre and post dinner spot. The beer selection is good, not amazing but there's a decent amount of variety with a little something for everyone. They even had a few sours and barrel-aged beers from craft breweries around the country. There were a number of places I didn't really recognize so it's a great way to try something new. \n\nThe high tops and communal tables are reserved for people who order food so both times we got some dessert or an appetizer. The rest of their food is kind of singular in that it's primarily sausages and while they look amazing, sometimes you just want something different. \n\nOn to the food:\n\nFried Cookie dough w/ Three Twins Vanilla Ice Cream (5 stars!): Amazing! The cookie dough balls are a tad small for my own preference but have great flavor with the mix of the bacon, pecans, and chocolate. Grab a little bit of the cookie dough with a spoonful of the ice cream and you're in heaven. If any other ice cream were used with this dish, I really don't think it'd be as good. The use of whole Madagascar vanilla beans instead of vanilla extract definitely adds a whole other dimension to the flavors to this ice cream. I would come to Hogwash just for this dessert- seriously, no joke. \n\nBread Pudding (4 stars): Also a quite good. The bread pudding is flavorful and contains a few different textures with the crunch of the pecans (which they don't mention on the menu), the gooeyness of the caramel, and the fluffiness of the bread. This dessert comes out warm and could also pair excellently with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if it were an option. \n\nFried Pickles (4 stars): Some of my coworkers specifically seek out fried pickles and these ones don't disappoint. They come out fresh from the fryer and have a nice crunch and tanginess from the pickles. The sauce that it's paired with also has a slight kick in flavor so it's great to just dunk in a slice. \n\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with my two experiences. Even if we were \"forced\" to order food so we could sit at a high top, I walked out completely satisfied both times. =D", "author": "Liza X."}

As a lifelong vegetarian, no, I have no real idea what I'm missing. But, years of enjoying veggie stand-ins has taught me that if a restaurant puts care and creativity into a solid veggie option--one that fewer people are likely to order--you can count on them for almost everything else.\n\nHogwash falls into this category, and manages a solid 10 landing.\n\nTheir vegetarian \"Hogless\" sausage is creative and addictively crispy on the outside, thanks to the crackly coating of polenta (?) and lentils (?). It doesn't pretend to be anything it's not, such as a dining partner's delicious (so they tell me) \"Sheepish\" lamb sausage. Instead, it's hearty without feeling healthy, and generously topped with condiments that run the gamut of textures and tastes: pickled cabbage, wispy frisee, smoked creme fraiche. I thought this was sufficient. Then, I discovered the table-side homemade mustard and spicy-ish ketchup (essentially). It was like the difference between a 4.0 and a 5.0 GPA--so good that my dining partner regularly eats the other half...\n\nAnd the beer...! I've tried several options, and liked every one, but keep coming back to the Hefeweizen or Weizenbock. Not an expert, so won't pretend to wax eloquent here. But hearing the cowbell ring every time someone orders a particularly ginormous glass of beer just adds to the generally cheerful mood. \n\nDon't miss:\n\n-The herb roasted beets. They've endured an intriguing pickling and roasting pilgrimage to reach your plate, and are perfectly offset by the creamy goat cheese and crunchy herb (thyme?) leaves.\n\n-The seasonal salad. I'm not a fan of salad dressing in general, but learned to appreciate the way it brings flavors together (especially when it's the ever-excellent fresh peach dressing). I never miss a change to order it.\n\n-Ryan, naturally, always in good cheer, fantastic with beer recommendations and conversation.\n\n-Occasional Chuck Berry album playing.", "author": "Midori Y."}

They're nice folks.) \n\nPrices are reasonable -- not cheap, not outrageous. \n\nThe menu changes semi-frequently, but the range of beer is pretty great and I haven't gone wrong with any of the sausages. \"Abe Froman\" is a favorite. The vegan one's solid, too. Skip the fries unless you've got a real hankering; they're salty, a serving isn't super-big, and you're better served leaving extra room for more sausages. \n\nAnother small piece of advice? If you're looking for a change of venue, you can order at Hogwash and take your number next door to PCH if cocktails (and dogs) are more your speed. You do you.

Perfect enough salt dripped with their house mustard sauce. \n\nFor the housemade sausage sandwiches. I ordered the Abe Froman and my significant other ordered the All Day. It is SO GOOD. I definitely got my sausage fix cover. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was all there .

The first time I had a quiet weekday lunch of the most fantastic lamb sausage sandwich - The Sheepish. The sausage was fantastic, yet it broke my heart that the bun was microwaved rendering it doughy and damp. I was so disappointed because it wouldn't have been much more trouble to put the bun on the grill! Please stop abusing the bread! I heard the microwave door opening and shutting repeatedly - no excuse for microwaving bread.\nI came back on active evening   - the beer selections are great! Fantastic even! The dining room was packed and it was very, very noisy. With a probably drunk crowd like that, there might not be so much discernment about the food - still, I have to say that I had one of the better side dishes I've ever had in my life! The roasted beets were lemony with fresh thyme - fantastic. I had the special with pork sausage - I have to say that they really nail sausage here. But the black-eyed peas that were served as a side dish were semi-cooked. Sad. When I pointed it out, the person at the bar happily refunded me half of the entree price.", "author": "Patricia S."}

Of course, I had to get an order of curry fries, and added a duck egg, natch. The fries were perfectly crispy and the curry sauce had just a hint of spiciness. The egg was delicious as well, but what's up with duck eggs everywhere?? They're basically the same thing as chicken eggs! My mom and I split the All Day (breakfast sausage + duck egg) and the Cali Club (chicken/bacon sausage + lettuce, tomato and avo) which were both really good. Again, sausages aren't my favorite food so I didn't think it was the best thing I've ever eaten, but I still really enjoyed it. Actually, what I really liked was the Almanac Meyer Lemon Gose which was light, refreshing and fruity. Perfect for a non-beer drinking, lightweight like me!\n\nService was great.

I had the lamb (Sheepish I think it was called?) and it was amazing! Super sloppy, and a little tricky too eat (why torture me with the wide bun?) but the flavor was amaze-balls.

Not even my dog. (if I had one ...)\n\nFirst of all, you get a variety of sausages: the pork breakfast sausage, the sheepish, the burning bird and Abe Froman. Second of all: it's MMMeat. You need it if you're gonna down a couple of brewskis. The names are cute and my two pals don't like lamb so I had the sheepish all to myself! (yay!)  The blue cheese, pickled cabbage and beets really went well with the lamb and tamed down the strong flavor of the meat. \n\nAnother thing to get is the Hogwash fries. Hello gorgeous fried sticks of carbs! Substantially thick and well salted, there's no doubt this french fry connoisseur had a field day with that small portion.\n\nBack to the craft brews. There are 30 choices on tap. Basically, that's enough golden liquid to flood Sutter St. I'm not a master cicerone, but it's safe to say these guys take their beers seriously. I stuck with bubbly (they had Gloria Ferrer) but I wish they had a proper flute. Wah, wah. \n\nThe guys behind the bar are engaging and a few are quite the talker, so all the single ladies!

The fried pickles were a last minute decision as I stood at the bar - the girl next me had an order and they looked GOOOOOOD. And they were! A light batter reminiscent of tempura, great flavor, and a delicious dipping sauce.\n\nThe wurst sampler was also a good choice - we got 2 skinny chicken jalape\u00f1o sausages, 2 skinny lamb sausages, and 2 big fat sausages (all-day breakfast and chorizo). It comes with housemade pickled veggies. The sausages were great! It's hard to pick a favorite. The chorizo was super tasty and perfectly spiced; the breakfast was unexpectedly great, with a sweet yet complex flavor, and the lamb was amazingly spiced! I didn't love the chicken, but only because it wasn't quite as good. Still good, though.\n\nThe accompanying pickled veggies were only ok. None had a particularly great kick or complexity of flavors. I think they need to rethink their recipes on this front. My friend and I also thought that a side of bread would have been good for the sampler - it was kind of weird to have no bread to smear our sausage and mustard on.\n\nThis would have been a 5 star restaurant but for two things - it was stiflingly hot in there, and the common tables.

Since I was walking with a girlfriend toward her place, she suggested Hogwash. I ended up meeting Peter L here on Wednesday, July 29th at 6pm. Well, I got there at 6pm. He got there closer to 7pm.\n\n*Gulden draak 9000 Belgian quad, 10.5%, Belgium ($9 for 9oz)\n*Verhaeghe duchesse flanders red, 6.0%, Belgium ($11 for 9oz)\n*Deschutes fresh squeezed ipa, 6.4%, Bend, OR ($6 for 16oz)\n\nI know nothing about beer, so I just picked the Gulden draak as my first drink. I liked it as it was strong and seemed to remind me a little of drinking coffee. Plus, it's named after a dragon! I love dragons! The second beer I picked was the Verhaeghe duchesse. I didn't like this as much as it was a sour beer. Reminded me of drinking beer with pickle juice in it. I made Peter finish it.\n\nWe didn't try any of their food as we were going to meet up a group of friends at another bar. Maybe I can use this as an excuse to go back as I loved the feel of Hogwash.

The service is great, and the Burnin' Brock is the best chicken sausage sandwich I've ever had. Fried avocado is a really interesting add to it, and it's pretty delicious. We also had the curry fries with an egg. I wasn't a huge fan of these, so I was hoping to get another Burnin' Brock, but they ran out. I was really happy I was able to try it. I can't stop thinking about it, so I'm going to have to go back soon. The aioli is a great addition to the sandwich and makes the whole thing come together. If you haven't been to Hogwash for this specific dish, you are missing out!\n\nWe also tried the dessert, which I think is somewhat new on the menu. It's Madagascar Vanilla - Three Twins Ice Cream with fried cookie dough that has some kind of candied bacon inside.

It breaks my heart to write this negative post. One of the owners Paula, came  up to me one night and literally gave me this verbal beat down that I'm still recovering from. Long story short she accused me of only going there to get things for free, she added how hard she has worked to build this place. I couldn't even get a word in and all I wanted todo was apologize for whatever I did that upset her so much. I too at the time was dealing with my own work drama and really wasnt paying much attention to what was going on around me. I never meant to offend her, but the most disgusting thing is during her rant she asks me a yes or no question. Finally I can tell her I dont know what happend and that i am so sorry. But she says \"No, shut-up, just answer me yes or no! x 3.\" Like I worked for her or as if I was a child ( I'm 37) by the way. During this night I had 1 beer and got a pretzel to go. I left $22 on the bar and that is when Paula attacked me. I always thought of myself as an over payer/ over tipper. In the end Paula says you can have this pretzel and take your money.

Regardless of how trendy or hip a place is, I reserve judgment until I've tried their fries (they seem to be the weak spot for most establishments).

Well if they have an impressive 30-tap system featuring really good beer and serve up homemade sausage, then the answer is yes. Welcome Hogwash to the neighborhood. \n\nSausage and beer - truly a complimentary match. Hogwash takes it one step further by making their sausages in house. Even Rosamunde doesn't do that. I had the Sheepish which was a moist and tasty lamb sausage paired with some bleu cheese and pickled cabbage and beet relish. It was a flavor combination that, while a little sloppy eating, was really satisfying. Also stole a bite of the Burnin' Bird which featured a chicken habanero sausage balanced out by some fried avocados and apple slaw - it was pretty tasty but think I liked my lamb sausage more. Also you should get some of the fried pickes because the harissa aioli is totally bomb!\n\nNow onto the beer and what a lovely selection they have. I tried the Ommegang Abbey Dubbel, Deschutes' Fresh Squeezed IPA, The Linden Street English Bitter, and shared a Hog-Goblet of Firestone's Bohemian Pilsner. Yes they do goblet-sized glasses here which are roughly 3 and some pints large. Really loved the Ommegang with its caramelized molasses and clove flavor - it hit the right spots for a wet cold night. \n\nFrom the folks that brought you Zeki's and food from Le Beau Market, the service is friendly and attentive.

An Icelandic ale which totally suited my tastes. My partner got the Epidemic vanilla stout which he also loved. Good beer. Check.\n\nOnto the AMAZING food.

The seasoning and crispiness was 10 out of 5.\n\nFried pickles. Game over.\n\nThe thing is that the owners of Hogwash had a vision OR maybe they hired someone with a vision and they totally nailed it.\n\nMy only tiny qualm is that they you need to wait in a long line to close out your tab. All orders and close outs are up front only. I'd suggest closing out your tab every time instead of leaving it open. If you have a dinner reservation or show to catch, you'll need to wait in line again. It's a tiny annoyance, but just something to mindful of if you're pressed for time. Also, the night we were there someone let us close out our tabs at our table which was really kind and genuinely appreciated. \n\nService is great here all around.\n\nANYWAY.

Fries came out after we were done with our food (happens so not tripping too much). I feel the menu is over priced for what it is. The sausages were skinny in a huge bun so it was bun beets and cabbage mostly it cost $12. They need to step their food and service game up.

We were staying at a hotel near by, and it made it easy to walk. So, my husband and me with my 5 year old walked. When we walked in we  noticed the clean and sophisticated decor. All the tables are high top style tables, and the area was spacey although the restaurant is not that huge itself. We were placed on a waiting list, and quickly got in line to order drinks. As we reviewed the menu, we noticed many beers from San Diego. They have over 40 beers on tap! When it was time to order, the hostess approached us to tell us our table was ready. That was quick! So we ordered our entrees as well. \n\nWe ordered the sausage platter $28, curry fries $7, fried housemate pickles $6, and the piggie $8 for my son. The curry fries were light on the curry, but they lacked flavor. Once they got cold, they weren't good. All the sausages were good. However, they were extremely spicy. This is what surprised me! I am not sure if this is how the sausage is here usually, or if they were having a off night. No joke it was spicy. Even the hot dog that my son received was spicy. Glad I tried it before he took a bite. I flagged the waitress down right away, and she was very friendly. I told her what was up, and she completely understood. She said it would take a few minutes before the new hot dog came out, and I was fine with that. The fried house made pickles were good, but again the dipping sauce they provided was just too spicy. \n\nOverall, I give 5 stars for customer service. The hostess, the waitress, and the bartender were beyond nice, and it stood out. The ambience was warm and welcoming, but the music was too loud. I had to yell for my husband to hear me. And, after 8 o'clock the volume seemed to go up. The food was ok. The part that stands out the most..spicy!\n\nI cannot comment on parking, as we walked here from our hotel.", "author": "Anna C."}

Good sausage sandwiches, a good selection of beers, communal seating and easy going staff. Hogwash is enjoyable, delicious and lives up to expectations.\n\nPros: Yummy sandwich, good salad and typical chill, loud bar atmosphere\n\nCons: None, they do everything you would expect\n\nFood I Tried: Abe Froman sandwich, kale salad - Both tasty\n\nLong Winded Review\nHogwash lives in that realm of modern gastropubs. That casual stylish feel that most gastropubs have. You know it's slick but also unassuming and everyone is chill. Seating is communal if you care for that sort of thing and the motif is exposed wood. You can picture it.\n\nBut the food, is quite nice. The menu is straight forward, you have your sandwiches all of which sound tasty. I went with the Yelp favorite, Abe Froman, Beef, cheddar & bacon sausage thousand island dressing, chopped romaine, tomato, pickles. This one worked, though I though the sandwich was on the small side, it is suitable for a modest meal. The sausage was flavorful and all the dressings added a bit of depth, to what can sometimes be a monotonous food item when we talk sausauge or hot dogs.\n\nI went with the Kale Salad as well, seen in Yelp reviews and that guy is delicious. Evenly dressed, soft vinaigrette that punches flavor without being too prominent. It works best as a side unless you drop in a sausage on top or something.\n\nOverall I'd say Hogwash lives up, is enjoyable and will meet all of your expectations.", "author": "Anh N."}

Whichever are you choose, you should be ready for a beer extravaganza. \n\nWith more than 30 beers on tap, there will be a selection for even the most jaded beer connoisseur. The beer offerings are mostly from California, but there are a few from Belgium and one from Germany for europhiles.  For non-beer lovers, there are A few wines by the glass, but the star here is obviously the beer. \n\nIf all the drinking makes you hungry, the house-made sausage sandwiches are a good choice. The \"All Day\" pork breakfast sausage, maple, ginger, arugula, topped with fried duck egg ($12.50) is a standout. Hogwash even thinks of vegetarians with a delicious \"Hogless\" sausage sandwich featuring butternut squash sausage, barley, sage, creme fraiche, cherry tomatoes, fris\u00e9e, pickled cabbage ($12.50). Fries, a few salads, pretzel bites, and pickles provide good accompanying dishes.\n\nIf you are thirsty and near Union Square, Your destination should be Hogwash.", "author": "CJ G."}

I had the All Day and while it was excellent that it was piping hot, the toppings didn't contribute enough flavor so it was overall a bit bland.  Maybe that's what the mustard and hot sauce are for, so I definitely helped myself!  My friend's lamb sausage, on the other hand, was much more well-balanced thanks to the pickled cabbage/beet.  \n\nThe beer list was pretty good.  But onto the fried pickles... kind of an embarrassment I think.  For $6 you get a pathetic little plate of sliced pickles.  There were probably 8-10 slices in total, seriously the saddest plate ever.  In terms of taste, they were just ok - the batter was crisp, but the pickles themselves didn't taste any fresher or better than Vlasic pickles.  Sheesh.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

A) the music was way too loud.  I could barely hear myself think let alone try to have a convo with my group.  B) their vegetarian option is the worst.  I normally prefer vegetarian food, and upon reading the description it sounded delicious causing me to pick it over a meat option, but that was a mistake.  Super mushy, bland, and just not good.  Had to drench it in mustard and hot sauce to take it down, garnishes were good. I realize this place specializes in sausage, but in my experience even places as such are able to put out at least one good meatless option.\n\nEveryone else in my group is smart and got actual meat, and the general consensus was that the sausage itself was excellent but the bread was just blah and almost took away from the sandwich (luckily they do allow you to order it breadless so this is no big deal!).  We also ordered the curry wurst fries and fried pickles to share, both of which was delicious.  \n\nWould definitely go back, but hope they are able to make these small changes.", "author": "Sonia S."}

However hours of operation are well communicated, so I cannot hold this against the establishment.\n\nWith that aside, I asked the bartender to surprise me with a beer, as I don't really know my way around the ol' barley pops.

I believe it was Nelson by Alpine. They actually had an Alpine rep in who I chatted with for a bit and if memory serves they had something else from Alpine that blew my socks off but for the life of me I can't remember what it was. I also ordered the brat tasting platter, which far exceeded my expectations for tasty brat with my beer. The accompanying mustards are just perfect.\nTonight was my second visit in as many months. One thing I noticed is how genuinely awesome the staff is. The host is a genuinely nice guy who tries very hard to accommodate and make sure you're happy. The bartenders are really superb individuals. You can't fake it at some point, and the staff is all very high quality.\nTonight, after some deliberation, I opted for the chicken habanero sausage sando and a few beers (they had the revered Cosmic Dust and Duet by Alpine which pleased this IPA aficionado). The sando was just incredible. Bursting with flavor and fresh, it is why Germans go nuts over brats and beers, simply put. Squirt a bit of the fresh mustard on it and you have a real party in your mouth. Hogwash is A-OK in my book and I look forward to my next visit.", "author": "Matt H."}

Anyways, you order and pay at the counter. You can get your beers right then and you also get a number to put on your table and they'll bring your food out to you. There were three of us and we shared the habanera Caesar salad, their special of the month, the Olive Garten sandwich, and curry fries with a fried egg. The salad was a little unique with the spicy dressing. But it wasn't too spicy, which was fine with me. The sandwich has an olive, fennel and pork sausage with pickled peppers, cucumbers, feta, and pesto aioli sauce. Delicious. And the best thing had to be the curry fries. We paid a little extra and got the fried duck egg on top - good choice.  Also they have some cool beers on tap. I had the strawberry sour beer.

We started with the fried pickles, which are fried in beer batter and I'm assuming crack because we could not stop eating them. Thankfully, as soon as the pickles were gone, our sausages showed up (or I'm SURE there'd have been withdrawals, there was basically a fight for the last pickle.) \nI got the Abe Froman. You know. The Sausage King of Chicago! (If you don't understand this reference, do yourself a favor and download Ferris Bueller's Day Off; you're welcome.) As a native Californian, In'N'Out is important to me and this sausage tasted like if Unicorns made you the best burger from In'N'Out but in a sausage with a freshly baked bun and better secret sauce. I'm serious. Freshly chopped romaine, perfect cherry tomatoes, a little bit of je ne sais quoi which means MAGIC in french (it doesn't actually...) But. I'd eat this every day. \nThey also have a giant selection of really amazing beers! \nI'm adventurous, so I went with a Strawberry Sour from Almanac. Which was delicious. My Fiance tried like 7 different beers and then I don't remember what he picked, but he loved it. \nHe also go the ALL DAY sausage, that has a fried duck egg on it. He preferred his, I preferred mine, to each their own. \nBasically, it's all super delicious. Go here.", "author": "Ashley S."}

It's communal seating, which was fine for us but unfortunate for our table-mates, since we had just gotten back from running.\n\nWith food, we went all out:\n - curry fries with a duck egg (pretty tasty)\n - vegetable salad (kind of sad looking. A pie pan with an expensive handful of vegetables. But it had a few amazing bites.)\n - fried pickles (very tasty)\nMy friend also got a sausage, and with 2 beers each, our total between two people was $80. We left mostly full, but it wasn't an incredible amount or especially fine food. \n\nThe beer recommendations were good.\n\nThere's a large focus on sausages.

My friend was all confused and was asking me \"what's a sausage sando?\". I said it was probably a sausage in a roll. He replied \"oh, like a hot dog! Why don't they just say that?\".\n\nSo yeah, this is a sausage place. Not a lot for vegetarians.\n\nI had some curry fries with a fried duck egg and the fried pickles. The curry fries were just standard chippies with curry sauce. The serving is generous enough. We ordered 2 of the curry fries to share between the 5 of us and for 3 of us it's all we had for dinner. I felt stuffed afterwards. The fried pickles weren't that good. The pickles were fancy cucumbers - should be more briney to offset the deep frying - and flavorless.

I'm a saison fan (which they had).  They had a selection of each genre - always appreciated.

We ended up ordering:\n\n* Curry Fries with Lamb Sausage - Enjoyable, with a nice crispiness to them, and good, strong flavors. \n\n* Burnin' Brock - Also pretty darn tasty, with a bit of kick to it, though less than one would have expected from something with habanero inside. I was a little disappointed when I came up on my last bite. \n\n* Marin Brew Co Blueberry Ale - I'm not really a huge fan of beer, but cider is a different story! While this was more bitter and less blueberry-flavored than I would have expected, given the name, it wasn't half bad either.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The place is on the smaller side, and was pretty packed, being a Saturday night, so I didn't get a good glimpse of the entire place. From what I noticed though, aside from the communal table to one side, the rest of the venue was bar seating, or high top tables. The communal table itself wasn't the most accessible either, given that the seating was comprised of two long benches on either side of the table. The ends of the table, however, work reasonably well, though one shouldn't expect to be able to scoot under the table.\n\nBathroom - No comment, since I didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Homegirl and I had grabbed beers there once before and it was a pretty chill atmosphere overall. But I knew after reading the menu this puzzle they call hogwash had been left unsolved in my book.\n\nSo we meander over for beers and a sausage. Shit was made in house which made me all the more excited. So we read over the list of sandos and I settle on the OG one, I believe it's called 'all day' had an egg on top that I wish was just a bit runnier and served on a plate so I could use the yolk on the sando, but was instead served on a wax paper. The sando itself was fantastic, but I gotta say my homegirl got the burnin Brock and it was waaaaay better than mine. Completely wish I had gotten that one instead. The ketchup I don't think was house made, actually it probably was considering the mustard and hot sauce were house made. Also I want to note specifically this place carries awesome beers, most notably Altamont brewing, which are by and large fantastic beers.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool I think it's really interesting overall and not what you'd expect from a place like this on the outside. Felt like it should be a bit darker inside. I think the music choices were pretty erratic, which could be cool generally but some weird dubstep came on right after the naked and famous and that doesn't beg for much continuity.

Delicious homemade sausages (I had the Abe Froman, so good!), extensive list of beers on draft (like 30!), and EXCELLENT service. I decided to try the blueberry ale and it was soooo crisp and refreshing, not hoppy at all which I like. You open a tab at the bar by the way, and that's where you do your ordering as well. The servers will bring your food to the table though which is awesome. \n\nAnd the service here is just top notch, I didn't catch her name (she has blonde hair) but she gave some great beer recommendations and had this positive energy about her. It was infectious! Also, I love the communal seating. I'm an avid believer in the spirit of bar comradery and sharing a beer with the stranger next you. As long as you're a beer lover you're good in my book! We made some great new friends. Long story short, plan a visit to Hogwash, you won't be disappointed.\n\nP.S.

You'd expect more than 1 pork sausage option for a place called \"Hogwash\" with swine so prominently part of the branding. In fact, there's only one breakfast sausage with maple as an option -- so nothing very savory, just sweet. There are 3-4 other sausage options. I did try the chicken habanero but it was overpowered by the pickles.\n\nThe curry with fries, duck egg, and sausage was okay. I was expecting something more like Currywurst (hugely popular in Germany) but it was really a gravy like curry with fries. The fries were delicious and the duck egg was good but I found it to be a really weird combination with the pork sausage since it came with maple and therefore tasted really sweet.\n\nThe beer selection here is really nice though and staff is friendly. However, the wait time from ordering when they are busy is quite long -- took 25-30 minutes for food that isn't that complicated to make.\n\nThe atmosphere is very lively though and seems like a fun place. I just wouldn't come here for the sausages. I'd at best come here for some beer and fries with some pals.", "author": "Victor W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-24", "description": "Everyone in San Francisco loves delicious sausages and beer.  I mean it feels like this whole place is sausage shops and beer shops to cater to the male techie sweatshirt crowd.  That crowd is generally not my cup of tea, but that's an entirely different story.\n\nWhat's always struck me about the sausage and beer places in SF is their ambiance, usually kind of divey / broey, and their prices, usually not that cheap.  What Hogwash maintains is the prices ($5-9 for a beer) but substitutes them for beers that are slightly better and more interesting.  The rotating taps have some relative newcomers to the scene, like harmonic a Brewer whom I think is fantastic and not very well known yet.  Hogwash ditches the divey / broey atmosphere for something more up scale, and that's reflected in the food which is a bit pricier ($11-13 for a sausage) but maintains higher depth and creativity.  As an example: the chicken sausage with fried avocado and pickled vegetables was delicious and I would highly recommend.\n\nWould definitely come back for the beer and sausages!  My rating system is a bit complicated, but in general I find San Francisco a bit pricey these days and this place is no exception, so I give it 4/5 stars.  In addition the service was a bit weird and one of our beers was forgotten.  Minor infractions for an otherwise very pleasant experience!", "author": "Alex H."}

Also, hard rolls are usually as advertised - hard. But the bread on this sandwich was incredibly soft. Everything together was borderline too big for my mouth to bite into, but it just made the cut. The chip pairing was also not just a standard combo that comes with your sandwich; no, the chips actually made the meal that much better.\n\nPleasant staff and water bottles at your table so you don't have to wait for refills.

You guys all get 5 stars!! I really like the layout of this place and the extra time spent into the aesthetics, giving it a refined beer hall/bar/pub feel, whatever they call these places nowadays.\n\nExcellent selection of craft beers, there's plenty to try. But of course you'll be paying a premium for it with beers starting at mostly $7-10. The menu is easy to read and understand what size and pour you'll be receiving but wait! What is this GOBLET thing? \n\nEYES LIGHT UP.\n\nIt's on average 3x the price of the pint version (16oz vs 55oz) of whatever beer you're having, so it' a pretty good deal if you're staying a while. Imagine yourself holding and drinking out of a contemporary, slightly classier take on zee German das boot! It's glorious! They also ring the cowbell for you.\n\nOh, they also serve food that's related to hogs, whad'ya know? I've had the curry fries and obviously heavy, but I found the fries too crispy to pair well with the gravy.

It was a large portion too - we barely finished half of them between the two of us.  The only complaint is that they had way too much salt on them but that was easily wiped off.

My friend and I were wandering around the area after checking out another bar and decided to stop in after seeing the stellar Yelp reviews. After all, who can say no to fried pickles (I call them frickles...does anyone else do this? The bartender seemed genuinely perplexed by this but I think it makes perfect sense! It's definitely a thing...)\n\nUnfortunately when we got in around 12:00 am the kitchen was no longer open (closes at 11:00 pm) but I couldn't hold that against them. Especially when I told them that I was on an apple cider kick and they didn't judge me. They also had an especially delicious 5% alcohol cider for me to enjoy! My friend ordered a real beer and that was also very satisfying.\n\nWe talked to the owner (Nick?) for awhile and he was a super chill guy, awesome job with the new place.\n\nHere's one last little tip: Don't accidentally walk into Cantina next door.

Would totally be a five star review if I hadn't experienced a hiccup which I felt was either the classical case of 'holiday brain' or perhaps a staff that might be a touch too laid back in their 'cool' approach. \n\nBartender took time to answer my questions about beer and food pretty patiently, but I noticed him drift off to the kitchen to chat pretty frequently. Probably the new launch of lunch and it being a bit slower than dinner might have just put him on relax mode. I know how being slow can kind of put you in a super chill mode...too chill. I think that chill mode might have been what caused him to make a mistake on which sausage I wanted. Instead of the breakfast one, they brought out the beef/cheddar/bacon, which also sounded AMAZING. The chef said he would make me the breakfast one, but I offered to eat the one he brought. He softly insisted to make the one I really wanted. \n\nI was SUPER hungry at the time, so I was getting a little antsy about the whole thing. I was very happy that the bartender poured me another delicious IPA from my hometown Berkeley on the house for his mistake. I left buzzy and happy with the yummy duck egg topped maple sausage I did get in the end. On the way out the chef was on a smoke break and said I should try the beef one next time and then sort of scolded himself for not just giving me both. I will admit, it psychologically made me hungry again :) \n\nI'm gonna go back again and would happily up this to five stars if the service sharpened up just a touch.

This place has a good concept & is very trendy right now and has potential to be really good, but they need to work on the food! \n\nMy husband & I ordered the breakfast hotdog, the spicy chicken hotdog, a side of fries & a kale salad between us. The fries were overcooked & really crunchy to the point they hurt our teeth to eat them and they were heavily over salted. They looked like snow capped fries!! The kale salad was heavily doused in the dressing and it was totally overpowering, which made it difficult to enjoy. The hotdogs were so, so.. The chicken sausage had deep fat fried avocado, which meant all you could taste was fried batter, so had to remove it to eat the hotdog. The breakfast hotdog with an egg was the only dish that wasn't too bad. \n\nThere is also no table service here, you order at the bar. Which made it difficult when you had a question about the menu. When I had a question about the veggie option, the passing waiter asked the women behind the bar to come to our table to assist & she then advised they don't actually have the dish available!! \n\nUnfortunately we walked away feeling very disappointed.", "author": "Lynsey H."}

The highlight was the beef, bacon and cheese sausage sandwich, which was a solid 7.5/10. \n\nThe fried pickles were disappointing - the pickles were bland, which meant that the fried batter was the most prominent element. I've had far better.\n\nThe beer was nice but a bit flat. Perhaps when you have so many beers on tap (20+ from memory) you're bound to get a situation where the kegs are on tap for a long time? I'm not sure, but the beer definitely didn't wow us.\n\nThe ambiance was probably one of the lower points. The fit-out is really nice, but the uninspiring lighting and the terribly bland electronic music made for an overall surprisingly sterile vibe.\n\nI'd say this place could be worth a visit so you can make up your own mind, particularly if you're into the idea of a beer and sausage gastropub.", "author": "Gabor H."}

So, I convinced a group of 9 friends to go here with me after seeing Phantom at the Orpheum.  The walk was about 20 minutes and was reasonably pleasant.  Once we arrived, the placed looked great and we were able to sit at a low long table immediately.  The server came over immediately with the menus and informed us that all ordering was done at the bar.\nThat worked just fine for me, since as it turned out that's also where you go to try the beers.  And they had a lot of beer options.  I ended up drinking a Rye Ale, and a Blue Bell (I think).  Both of which were very good beers.  My wife got a Blueberry Ale, and she liked it so much she bought it twice.\nThe food menu was small, about 5 sausage sandwiches, 4 salads, and a few snacks.  Ideal for a Gastropub I think.  Between the whole table, I think we may have ordered pretty much everything.  And nobody had anything bad to say at all.  We even all agreed we would come back.  And as it turns out, those reviews about the pickles, yeah they are true.  Awesome fried pickles.\nThe staff overall was very friendly, and we even got a visit from the owner.  He was a good sport and took some photos with us.  Then he heard we had some anniversaries at the table and he hooked us up with some free beers.  It was awesome.  He also said he is hoping to add a couple desserts next month, so maybe I have a reason to head to city again.", "author": "Corey S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-16", "description": "Yet another trendy, \"deconstructed comfort / elevate low class dining\" type of business.  Their decor signals that this is their exact aim.  Ordered their \"All Day\", a beet appetizer, and a salad.  Some of their sausages taste like slim Jim's while others taste of day old Thai basil chicken.  They like to dress their dishes with trendy items which sound nice on paper but aren't well executed within the dish. Their fried duck eggs are of low quality and burnt, their beets are exceedingly tart with a blue cheese dip which does not pair well. And their salad is sad at best.

Unfortunately I don't. \nCame in on a Monday night around 7pm. Was quickly explained that it was self-seating and to order at the bar and take a number. I ordered the Curry Fries with Pork Sausage and Fried Duck Egg - I didn't feel like wine this night. My friend got the Caesar Salad and Hogwash Fries, and Mexican Coke. \nCommunal seating can be strange as the table is so small, especially with people trying to talk over each other. \nIt was crazily crowded and the food didn't arrive until around 8pm. I was almost dying, pleading for the food to come - almost begging them to bring out whatever. At least they apologized and offered a free beer or a drink - but I was just hungry.\nMy friend's salad and fries came out first. The fries was alright at first, but the more I ate the harder it was to eat anymore. I love crispy fries - but this was on another level - it surpassed being crunchy and almost to the point of rock hard, which was tiresome to keep eating. If the fries were going to be so crunchy, then make them shoestring fries; or if they wanted to keep the thicker cut then at least let them be somewhat soft inside. \nThe croutons on the salad was supposed to be parmesan croutons, however I could not taste the parmesan. On the other hand, each bite into the deep fried crouton released an influx of oil that coated my tongue. Maybe they should consider baking these next time - we all know how bread can soak oil. On a positive note, the lettuce seems fresh and crisp. \nThe curry fries were whatever - nothing special there. Same hard, oily fries. The curry sauce looked more like gravy and tasted more like almost nothing. The pork sausage was alright but not every piece gets cooked evenly. At least they can fry an egg! Thanks goodness!\n\nThe service was a tiny bit strange as you share a water bottle with all the people around you as well as the waiters and waitresses who would occasionally pour themselves a glass without refilling it. Passing a can of utensils and napkins along the bar was also inconvenient and unnecessary - they should just have more of those so customers doesn't have to be bothered.\n\n\nAnyways, I can almost guarantee that your fries will never get soggy here! Although I'm not sure if the mediocre food was worth waiting an hour for. Maybe I'll come back next year?", "author": "Ch\u00e2u B."}

The sausage:bun ratio was all wrong - the sausages were very small, and dwarfed by the buns. The one I had (the all-day) was totally flavourless - it was meant to be a pork sausage with maple and ginger, but there was no evidence of these latter flavours, and the whole thing was totally overpowered by the wildly unnecessary addition of rocket (arugula), which has no place anywhere near anything claiming to resemble an all-day breakfast.\n- It was expensive for what you got. The hot dogs were $12.50 without fries ($5 more, or $8 if you get curry sauce), and just weren't nice or adventurous enough to warrant a gastro-pub price.\n\nIn short, there should have been more sausage, more taste, less bun, less random experimentation, and a lower price tag.\n\nThe chips and beer *were* good, though.", "author": "Christopher N."}

Bar food usually tends to be predictable and mediocre. \n\nHowever, Hogwash slaps that stereotype right across the face! SOLID beer and SOLID sausages. Literally, it was a sausage and beer fest in there. The beers are artisan and absolutely delicious. The bartender/waitress was extremely knowledgeable and made some great recommendations when we described what kind of beer we were in the mood for. \n\nAs for the food, our taste buds were more than tantalized! Even if you don't particular enjoy sausages, you will become a convert after trying Hogwash's. I highly recommend ordering what we ordered: \n\n1. Sausage sampler platter with pork breakfast sausage (my personal favorite), lamb sausage, chicken habanero sausage, and beef & bacon sausage. The flavor profile was so intense and the texture varied from very soft to firmer across all of them. This is an absolute must-order if you're planning on dining here!\n2. Curry fries with fried duck egg and sausage of your choice (we had it with lamb sausage). Dear god, so freaking good! This is basically a really fancy poutine and it literally hit all of the right spots. \n\nOn your next trek through the Tendernob, definitely consider Hogwash. The vibe is slightly upscale casual so it's perfect for a sexy date night, night out with friends or a catch up session with a friend. It was ~$75 for 2 of us for our food order and a beer each, so typical SF restaurant-fare, not bar-fare. But it's completely worth it! \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

To make matters worse, this place had more than half the restaurant reserved for a private party. On a Friday night.\n\nI got tired of waiting, and went outside to get some air, and some guy who was just coming in asked me how I liked it. I told him it sucked, that we didn't eat anything and were leaving because we couldn't get a seat and no one seemed to care. \n\nAs it turns out, this was Nick, the owner, who asked me to give him a chance, and a minute to find a table. He asked one party of three taking up a table for six, and they said no. Then he found three empty spots in the reserved section and said we'd have to finish by 7:30 (45 minutes from then), but we'd probably have longer than that. \n\nThe food was great, the beer was cold, and the meal was overall outstanding.

I also had the Burnin' Brock sandwich, which was good, but not amazing. I thought the flavoring and sauces that were already included weren't that unique or tasty but each table has ketchup/mustard/hot sauce so that helped a bit. There's a huge selection of beers that my boyfriend really enjoyed, so again, as a bar this really is a great place. \n\nI didn't enjoy the seating system as much - we waited for a while to order our food and then to have a seat to wait for it.

Curry fries and fried pickles were oddly the highlight of the meal, particularly the fries, but that calls more to the comfort food person in me.  If I had to actually reflect, both the curry and fries were unspectacular, but putting them together was just what I needed for a winter's night.\n\nThe service was on the bad side.  The waiter took my order number stand thing and didn't realize that I had ordered a sandwich in addition to the curry fries (to share, to allay your judgments), but only delivered the latter.  It caused some minor confusion.  They also didn't restock our water, which is generally a huge pet peeve of mine.

After waiting for some time I walked up to the bar to place our order. We waited for what seemed like a long time for our food to arrive. The place was somewhat small and not too busy. A gentleman (either owner or manager - who spent more time talking to friends versus working) told us sorry the food was taking long and it would be right out. \n\nOnce the food arrived, the server told us she would comp our food since it took so long. We appreciated that and only had to pay for beers. We had fried pickles which were salty, crunchy, and enjoyable. We had a sausage sandwich (habenero chicken).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "Rarely do I find a restaurant that does everything so well. Food, ambiance, service, booze selection, greeting, etc. I don't think some places realize just how important that first impression is. My new friend and I (yay for Dreamforce attendees rolling solo!) walked over from our hotel bar to grab some food after I saw the great Yelp reviews here. \n\nIt was a little drizzly and cool outside so when I walked in I must have made some sort of noise indicating I was cold because the hostess immediately pulled us in and asked us how many...while simultaneously ushering us over to the bar where she said we could get a drink and wait for our table. Such a great first impression...already loving this place. \n\nThen two minutes later she comes over and says we should just sit at the bar if we aren't opposed since some gentlemen had just left. So we cozied up and were introduced to the friendly bartenders. Can we just talk about how few bartenders these days wear a smile? These guys were allllll smiles and jokes and immediately made us feel comfortable. If I inquired about a beer on their extensive list, I got a taster without even requesting it. Top notch service, indeed. I'm from Austin so I'm more used to being scoffed at if I ask about multiple beers on the menu like I'm supposed to be a walking beer encyclopedia and should be ashamed if I'm not. \n\nI'd heard from the bartenders at our hotel that the fried pickles here were not to be missed. I was so glad for this tidbit when I took my first bite. Beer battered pickle chips with a garlic aioli will now be a part of my last meal should I ever find myself on death row. These things were insane. Perfectly fried, hardly any grease. \n\nNext we tried an Abe Froman and another of the dogs on the menu. They cut them in half for us so we could both sample them without creating a mess. I really appreciate a restaurant that will do this. \n\nEvery bite was better than the last, and I was almost wishing I'd just gotten a whole one of each just for myself (my stomach thanked me for not!). \n\nToward the end of the meal the hostess appeared behind the bar so I asked her a question about the taps. There are no visible markings on them so we were thinking the bartenders were just straight up badasses and had each tap memorized for what it was. She laughed at this since that seems to be the idea and then told us they have it written on the very top. This lead to a conversation about how the hostess, Paula, is actually the owner!!!! I was floored. She can't be a day over 25 and she owns this fantastic gastrobup in the heart of San Francisco. It doesn't get any cooler than that....oh well, except the fact that she still pours her heart and soul into it by being the first face you come into contact with when you arrive. I really really like that about this place. By the time we left I felt like it would definitely be a neighborhood bar that I'd go to on the regular if I lived there. She said they have some people who are in there 4-5 nights a week that have become like family. What more could you ask for?? \n\nYou can tell Paula and the rest of the crew really care about what they're doing here from the smiles to the amazingly delicious food combos. This will be a place that I come back to every time I'm in San Fran from here on out!", "author": "Emily P."}

Lol). The pickled veggies were my favorite! Again, pickled anything is my fave. Fresh veggies with a light pickling that I could probably eat all damn day!

The food was great and the beer selection was definitely good (having lived in North County San Diego where the beer scene is excellent), but it was very pricey considering the fact that after ordering three sausage sandwiches (the sheepish, the burning Brock and the beef and cheddar) and the fried pickles, my husband, 7 year old son and I left still a bit hungry. I'm the kind of person that eats just until I'm not hungry anymore, not until I'm stuffed. It would've been great had they included any kind of small side with their sausage rolls, or priced the sausage a little bit lower so it was more feasible to order sides. Sure, you're paying for quality and location, It's definitely a good bet if you want to try some great sausage, and are either not a big eater or don't mind spending a fair bit in order to have sides as well. \n\nAlso, the wait was long, which on a Friday night was to be expected.

I knew it would be great, knowing Nick and Paula and they're attention to detail and knowledge of what people want before they know they even want it. And it's  true, I didn't even know I liked fried pickles. But now I have dreams of them almost every night (both the fried pickles and Paula and her babe of a brother Phil who you can find behind the bar most days.) Upon walking in you're greeted with sky high ceilings with beautiful lights. Long community tables with attractive people laughing and drinking lead you back to the bar area. The large magnetic wall boasts messages like HOT SEX and FRIED PICKLES and COOKING HAPPENS IN HERE. Everyone always looks to be having a great time, every time. Now let's get to the beer. As a girl who has been a craft beer drinker for a decade and worked years in the industry, I'll admit, I judge a place by their beer menu. Especially one that has made beer such a big part of the scene. I will say Hogwash has the best beer selection in the city. Sure, they may not have either Pliny, but they definitely have something for everyone. And the menu is ever-changing. Start the night with a light Pilsner, and take your pallet for a ride moving up to a Dale's Pale Ale, and end with a dry-hopped IPA that finishes with a touch of jalepeno. Too much to drink? Need a bite? Order the Abe Froman. You trust the Sausage King of Chicago, don't you? Also their fries are maybe the best I've ever had. Wait, did I mention all of their bartenders are total babes and not the snobby kind? Want a sample of a beer? Of course you can have one. They're just overall very friendly and passionate about beer. How refreshing!\n\nOverall, wow. Bravo, you two. I can't wait to go back to Hogwash. This time I'm definitely ordering the Hobgoblet.", "author": "J G."}

The Abe Froman were apparently delicious (says the husband). The menu is random and could use some focus (think bacon Mac and cheese and dishes like that). The beer selection is legit (and that's coming from a San Diego girl). The vibe is super chill and welcoming. The girl behind the bar gets major props for complimenting me (and essentially my husband) on my engagement ring. Overall, it's alright.

We chanced it as not only being an extremely new place, but also that there are SO MANY staples in SF we were told to try. I am so glad we made our own decision. \nIt was VERY busy on a Friday night and a little chaotic at first in the whole dynamic of seating. (No real wait list, just grab a communal table when you see a party getting up) Smaller space, a little awkward staring people down and eyeing their spots, BUT literally the only low point. A really nice gentleman guided us through the process, aquatinted us with our surroundings, and checked in on us while waiting and also came to chat with us once seated. He ended up being the owner, hard at work, running bussing and helping the whole dynamic, while being very accommodating!\nBoth food and beverage is ordered at the counter/bar after grabbing a seat and figuring out your order... You get a number, they give you your food. It's pretty great, especially with the communal seating. The bar seemed to be bustling with many just in for beverage too.\nThe beautiful menu of homemade sausages (veggie options too!), various side salads (beer, kale, potato), pickle plates, fried pickles etc. were very pleasing options and the four sausages/four sides we sampled were all delectable! I loved the kale salad and vegetarian (squash!) sausage. \nThere was also a beautiful amazing draft beer list of 20+ mostly local beers coming from a beautiful line of identical steel taps. Oh yes, the place was gorgeous! High ceilings, warm lighting, lively atmosphere! Very welcoming. Wish I didn't live so far away. Hogwash, you'd be a regular dining/drinking spot!", "author": "Caitlin T."}

She finally asked how many and we told her 3 and she sat us telling us over her shoulder we needed to order at the bar. About 5 minutes later she walked up to our table and slid a bottle of water across our table put some cups down and walked away without saying a word. We then orders and waited...and waited and waited FOR 45 MINUTES!!! For 3 HOT DOGS!!! We watched 2 other tables get served as no one acknowledged us at all as the waiters walked past us with other people's food. And the hostess did laps from the door to the bar not acknowledging that we've been patiently waiting for our damn hotdogs, but she did however have time to talk to other tables. After about 35 mins my friend got her hot dog. So we waited for 35 minutes -while people who came in after us got served their food- for one out of 3 of our hot dogs. Not a full meal-but an uppity hipster-dog. After about 45 minutes the cashier came up to us and asked us if we were still waiting for food...UMM YEA! You took our money of course we are waiting for food!!!!! Maybe he forgot what we looked like because we waited so long. Oh and the best part is when he asked, he scoffed as if it was a funny coincidence we were just sitting there almost an hour waiting!! That made me so mad I couldn't believe it. He then gave a half hearted \"oh sorry..\" As we asked for a refund for the rest of our food. So no sincere apology, no offering to comp us, not even a stupid coupon. This place is a joke. Maybe if you dress like a hipster they'll notice you and maybe care about your order, that seems to be the dress code there of everyone who got served. Maybe it had something to do with the fact we were the only non Caucasians there. Who knows. But unless you want to wait almost an hour for a pathetic hot dog (my friend who got the privilege of actually getting her food showed us her hot dog which was a skinny hot dog full with 90% lettuce-basically a salad with a side of hot dog) and you fit in with the crowd- STAY AWAY.", "author": "Nicole M."}

Due to their poor management and customer service, our party opted to go elsewhere (we ended up at 4505 Burgers & BBQ, which was fantastic). Due to the long wait, we were told we could wait at the bar next door and have a drink until we were seated. We did so. I learned when I went to the ladies room, that bar and Hogwash share one single sink and toilet for all patrons of both establishments. When our table was ready, we closed out at the bar, grabbed our drinks and went next door. A woman immediately accosted me, told me my cocktail was going to cause her to lose her restaurant then was sent back to the bar to either dispose of or finish my drink. Initially, the guys with beers were told they were ok to be seated but then were also approached by a nervous fellow and told they had to leave with those too.

The waitress/hostess took down my friend's name and we were put on the waiting list. It took about 45 mins to get seats. When we were seated, we ordered our beers and hot dogs (sausages). It took about almost an hour to get our food.I got a lamb sausage and my friend got a pork, she a lager and I a golden ale. Beer selection was nice (hence the additional star) the food was not anything remarkable. Also got the curry fries which were definitely not up to our expectations. Super crunchy and curry seemed like a cheap Japanese powdered mix. We only stayed to get a couple more beers.", "author": "Dennis L."}

Coming from the land of Hot Dougs in Chicago, I'm a sucker for exotic \"encased meat\".  We ordered the Sheepish and Burnin'Brock.  The Sheepish was pretty tasty but a bit spicier than I anticipated. I'm a big baby when it comes to spiciness. The spiciness didn't outweigh or take away from the flavor which is what matters to me.  The Burnin' Brock of course was also spicy but damn the fried avocado was amazing. It was lightly fried.. tempura-like.  Very good. I didn't have an issue with the order at the bar system, but we were seated at the bar.  Cute place. Very tasty. I'd come back.", "author": "Emily M."}

I ordered the hogless and the curry fries, while my dining companions had the platter.  The fries where old and dry, despite being drenched with curry.  I asked for a fried duck egg on top of my hogless, which came out both cold and underdone.  I sent it back and they just put another egg on top (the raw egg had already soaked into the sandwich).  Total bill was close to $100 for barely any food, two cokes, a glass of wine and a small beer.  Only saving grace was that I enjoyed my beer from iceland.  Save yourself some $ and go elsewhere.", "author": "Laura D."}

Be advised, these are smaller pours at pint prices, but the beer is good.   Issue was with the food.  Got the Curry Fries with Lamb sausage and the lamb sausage sandwich.  The sausage was ok...one of them was dry but decent flavor, other was the correct moisture, but bland.  They are quite thin, so their flavor gets lost in the dish.

Had trouble finding a decent place for a late dinner as most places close around 10:00 p.m. Got served by the Owner, Nick. He was totally cool, offered some beer samples so we could start off with something we liked. Ordered and devoured the fried pickles. The YELP reviews highlighted them and they were delicious. I had the Abe Froman sausage sandwich and it was amazing. I drank three different kinds of beer, my favorite being the Weihenstphaner Vitus Weizenbock from Germany (11% alcohol). It was ice cold, smooth and delicious. Nick checked on us the whole time. I ended up downing about seven beers with the ones purchased, the samples and the bartender gave us a pallet cleanser after I paid the bill. I would recommend this place to any and everyone. Outstanding service (we even received a comp desert), great food and great beer! I tried a good sampling - two appetizers (pickles and fries), three different beers, one sandwich and the desert - all were spectacular!", "author": "Tony M."}
