The rolls are super unique, not stuff you would find at other sushi places. I especially recommend the Golden State Roll- I got it both times I went. Their fish tastes fresh and the cuts are thicc. \n\nThe environs is casual but boujee. The restaurant is small so there isn't much seating, which means that if you don't have a reservation, you will have to wait a while. I came both times Friday night and had to wait around 20 to 40 minutes. The staff is also pretty busy so it sometimes takes a while to get something. The food is so good though that I don't care about that stuff.  \n\nBOI I AM COMING BACK FOR SURE. But I would maybe recommend takeout instead, since like I said the place is very small and often crowded.", "author": "Brittany H."}

We got four different rolls and didn't really like any of them. They all sounded so cool and different and ended up being bland and dry. We got the lava golden state, and two special rolls one with pumpkin tempura and the spicy omega or something. \nThere wasn't much fish in any roll. So don't expect to be filled up. Usually the three of us are full off of three rolls and we had four and were still so hungry we went around the corner and bought MORE food at a better place. Never in my LIFE have I done that. \n\n\nService was friendly so I added a star but honestly that was the least satisfying $80 I've spent.", "author": "Hayley G."}

I made a resy for 1 on open table for the same day for 8:45pm. \n\nI had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated at the bar. People were very personable. After seeing my name on the reservation I was greeted by name for the rest of the evening. \n\nEven when sitting at the bar, you apparently still order with a waitress than with the sushi chefs. I couldn't read the daily specials on the board and was provided an iPad of a picture so I could see it more clearly. I did ask the waitress for an opinion on a tofu dish, but she either didn't understand what I was asking or didn't know. But told me to choose whatever I was craving and didn't have a recommendation. \n\nI ended up ordering the \"spicy\" tofu salad. Don't get this. It's basic lettuce with slices of tofu that has a spicy seasoning. But they don't season each piece. They stack them then season them. So only what is showing gets seasoned. But that was my fault thinking at a sushi place I should get some greens with my meal. Also, it's not spicy. \n\nI did get hamachi, ikura, salmon belly, otoro, and the uni from Japan. The sushi is very good for the price point. Is it the best sushi I've ever had? Not even close. But I knew that going in. It is very good tho! I heard from friends they're known more for their rolls. If I go back, I'll go with friends so I can order more stuff. \n\nBut the sushi was well made. Fish was cut nicely, nice sizes. Sushi rice was a good texture and temperature. I would go again. \n\nI didnt like that all the sushi came out right when I had just gotten the tofu salad.

While I appreciate there wasn't too much filler rice, the unagi lacked that rich lushness. I'm not one for saucy rolls but it needed a drizzle of unagi sauce since its savory sweetness is more complementary than soy sauce.\n\nThe O-Toro #2 Roll was so WTF: https://bit.ly/2JlISjT. The toro was pulverzied and torched to extinction. Why even offer a roll topped with toro if you're going to torch it to death? Toro is not cheap but at least top it with thin slices and 86 the torch so customers can actually taste the toro. Or, add sufficient toro and increase the price. We basically paid $17 for a vegan roll. \n\nWe went at opening so it wasn't busy but it took a while to receive our order and we sat at the window with fruit flies flying around. \n\nI returned to work and saw that their most recent health score is 79 which is scurrrry for a sushi bar.

We've been meaning to come since we saw that this place is on the Michelin guide and recently got a dinner reservation. The food was great, around 4.5 for me.\n\nIt's easy to make reservations on OpenTable. The restaurant is really small so you definitely need to to avoid a long wait. It's a good spot for a romantic date. \n\nThe menu consists of Japanese tapas, noodles, nigiri, sashimi and rolls. Be sure to check out their specials on the chalk board at the bar.\n\nService is painfully slow. It took forever to get seated even though we had a reservation. Seems like it's 1-2 people managing the entire restaurant which makes things pretty hectic. I felt bad for the waiter rushing around, but she did a good job at getting our food out promptly. She asked if it was okay to bring the noodles & dessert immediately after we ordered which was nice. I took my boyfriend here, we ordered around 9 dishes and it came out to $50 per person which was not bad. \n\nCaterpillar Roll - Eel, cucumber, avocado & tobiko. Pretty good! Wish there was more eel since the avocado and cucumber overpowered the flavor.\n\nChicken Udon - I really enjoyed this and wasn't expecting the udon to be that good! The chicken was really flavorful and tender. It came with mushrooms and seaweed. We really liked the broth and downed all of it. It was a good portion size to share. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was how soft the noodles were.\n\nSaba Shioyaki - Pretty standard mackerel. Comes in two pieces.\n\nLollipops Roll - Tuna, salmon, albacore and avocado wrap w/cucumber. This was a pretty unique option. It tasted a bit on the lighter end.\n\nYakitori 2 Skewers - Grilled chicken skewers. So delicious! This was probably one of the most memorable dishes of the night. They do chicken really well at Otoro.\n\nGreen Tea Cheesecake - We really enjoyed the execution of this dessert. Not too sweet per our liking. I'm usually not a fan of cheesecake but the matcha flavor was infused so well that I could hardly taste the cheese.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Hirame (Halibut), Sanma (Japanese Pike Fish) and the Madai (Sea Bream) specials nigiri. They all looked great, and he seemed to enjoy them. \n\nI heard the ramen here isn't that great so I'm glad we opted for the udon.

Dunk it in soy sauce and lay it on the sushi. Say your sorryies to your tongue and put a nice round chunk of wasabi on that ginger. \n\nNow if you put that beautiful masterpiece you just created in your mouth, you will be hit, first by the 'subtle' wasabi which will bring tears to your eyes - only out of happiness of course. And then the sweet ginger as you chew more. Isn't that great? Well of course you'd also get some weird taste of rice and some random fishes plus maybe some avocado in the background.

The sauteed mushrooms was probably the worst thing I've ever ordered at a restuarant. It was a combination of mushrooms stir fried with some oil...that was horrible. We paid a good $7.95 for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "When it comes to sushi, I can eat anything (from average to above average). However, rating wise - I am extremely picky and have rarely ever given sushi places a true 5 star rating.  O-Toro deserves this honor because of their exceptional quality of fish.\n\nWith their fairly large menu (mostly due to their small plates), I've had the chance to try a few items from their sushi/sashimi menu and also their tapas menu.  While their their tapas are decent, I would suggest limiting your order from this section and focus on their fish.  Being named \"O-Toro,\" it's almost a given you should try their toro.  Warning: It is expensive.  However, since it's so fatty, you don't need a huge portion to satisfy your taste buds.  An order of the O-Toro Sushi (2 pieces) should be enough to cure an individual's curiosity.  Another option is to get an order of O-Toro sashimi and share with your party.  It is well worth the feeling of the toro melting away the moment it hits the tip of your tongue.  The same goes for any other fish you try (with salmon and yellowtail being my other two favorites).\n\nFor rolls, they keep it simple yet delicious- just how I prefer my sushi!  Unlike most other sushi restaurants, they don't pile on loads of crunchy onions or a bazillion different sauces that take away from the natural flavors of your sushi.  My personal favorite here is the 'Golden State' (snow crab, avocado, fresh salmon, and topped with bits of lemon).  The lemon just gives it an explosion of clean, citrus flavor - so complementary to the salmon.\n\nI highly recommend O-Toro to all true sushi lovers, and I cannot wait to come back for more!", "author": "Judy C."}

Stumbled upon O-toro and saw the reviews were really good, so I definitely wanted to hit it up. \n\nWhen you get in, you'll notice this place is super small. Make reservations, it'll be so much easier. It's on the cusp of Haye's Valley and Civic Center and super intimate setting.

Here's what I settled on: \n\n-Sake Butteryaki from the Hot tapas menu for $12.75. Grilled salmon with a butter sauce. I thought this dish was good. The flavor was light, but present. I thought the salmon was a little dried out but it may have been sitting in a window for a bit. Not a bad dish though.\n\n-Hamachi Belly with Yuzu Miso on their specials board for $14.95. OH-EM-GEE! This dish was to die for! The hamachi belly was marbleized and so delicious!!! The yuzu miso really enhanced the flavor overall. I really didn't want this dish to end haha!\n\n-Shoyu Ramen for $12.75. Ended my meal off right! The ramen was cooked to perfection, the soup included things like bamboo shoots, pork, seaweed and other greens. I kind of wished they did a slow cooked, little runny boiled egg. That would've sealed the deal for this dish but what I had was super delicious. \n\nI've been trying to find a good sushi joint here in SF since I moved.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-22", "description": "O, O-Toro... if I eat enough Otoro, I will soon become as big as Totoro.  \n\nI found O-Toro on Yelp because I was looking for a place that was nice, decently unique, and affordable.  I cannot necessarily say that O-Toro satisfied the last criteria, but it was definitely a fancy hassle of a culinary expedition: on my showing-people-around-SF list.\n\nWe got the SHISHITO STUFFED WITH SPICY ALBACORE ($6.95) to share.  Although I generally find appetizers underwhelming and overpriced, this turned out to be addicting flavor explosion--I would be happy eating plates of this for a meal!  It's somewhat similar to the shrimp stuffed bell pepper dim sum, except with a big kick from the shishito pepper, spicy albacore, and spicy mayo.  I wasn't sure what to think when I saw the dish arrive with bonito flakes, but the bold nuttiness added a nice extra dimension.  It also threw me off guard that it's not sashimi, but cooked albacore which looked and tasted suspiciously like imitation crab.  (However I would trust them not to have imitation albacore.)\n\nSince they don't offer the sashimi or any other type of sashimi combo for dinner, it forced me to think.  I have reached the age of straying away from saucey crunchy fusiony rolls, so I confronted the difficult, sophisticated (and expensive) choices for nigiri.  \n\nI got the O-TORO NIGIRI ($12) because restaurant namesakes tend to feel obligatory.  Maybe my expectations rose a little too high, because I failed to detect anything mind-blowing and would honestly have preferred a leaner tuna with better fish flavor that wasn't diluted in fat, i.e. the regular maguro.  The price wasn't listed on the menu due to the seasonal availability, and $12 was steep for the two pieces of nigiri... $6 perfectly good lunch money (or two days of coffee money) vanished into thin air in one bite!  (well, technically not thin air, but don't get me started on metabolism)\n\nI really liked the GARLIC ALBACORE ($5.50) which was infused with garlicky goodness and turned out to be excellent with the rich albacore.  The SAKE ($5.75) was good too, with minimal strips of fat which placed a strong emphasis on the actual salmon flavors.\n\nThe nigiri can rival the badass sushi of Socal--large cuts that drape over the sushi rice and a glistening freshness that makes your mouth water just from looking at it.  The presentation was nice but I thought it was a bit too whimsical with the seemingly random garnishes of cashew, radish, and cucumber (I debated rearranging the one of the awkwardly placed garnishes for my food pictures)  \n\nAt the end we were still hungry so we added the GYOZA ($6.75).  I expected it to be exactly like all the other premade salty frozen gyoza, but for once it tasted fresh: the thin wonton skin, perfect tad of browned crispiness, and vegetable-based filling rather than the usual hamburger-grade mystery ground pork.  Another unexpected yummy was the dipping sauce: it was very much sweetened which made the gyoza even more complexly delicious.\n\nOverall O-Toro has undeniably good food, but at over $30 (without drinks--this is definitely restricted to special occasions, or if I want to show off to non-SF peeps about how SF has good food.  \n\nNote: If review intrigues you, I suggest checking out Domo in the area!  I only chose O-Toro because it takes reservations, but seriously how can you not resist the thought of Domo (even though the restaurant is way too classy to be named after that silly Domo-kun)", "author": "Edna C."}

Great for grabbing quick bites before show, but sadly fish is small and not as fresh as you'd expect it to be, considering they are flown from Japan. However, the service is very good. And they are very attentive, and when I told them that I only had thirty or so minutes to eat, they sat me quickly and fed me even quicker. Dining alone, women get attention. That's sort of the general rule of thumb, especially if you sat by the bar on your own. So, you get that going for you if food is not of your top concern. But It is, for me. Quality of food takes precedence over ambience and attentive service. \n\nThere are some silver lining to this spot. It's right next to Rich Table, one of my top restaurants in SF.

I noticed that there were enough bar seats opened which he didn't even offer until I asked. We got the chance to sit down and glance at the menu before realizing we were pressed on time so we decided to tell the staff that we are going to order to-go instead. He said it wasn't a problem and we let ourselves up off the bar area and walked to the side of the restaurant with the menu to decide what we wanted to get. \n\nMy niece and I decided on getting a roll with unagi (eel) in it, so we chose the Dreamy sensation. For appetizers, we shared the agedashi tofu. \n\nFood was just okay in my book. The Dreamy sensation had a decent flavor, but with the cream cheese and avocado, the flavor of the unagi wasn't strong at all. I felt like I was eating a roll with mostly fat and no protein. \n\nThe agedashi tofu was overly soggy. The food was done and packed inside a to-go container but we waited 20 minutes for them to make the single dreamy sensation roll to-go so the appetizer ended up getting soggy while sitting in its own steam. The dipping sauce was good, it made the tofu more tolerable. \n\nService here sadly didn't make up for the long wait time.

Their otoro has the perfect light pink hue with nice white marbling and a few oily lines.  It melted in my mouth and had my eyes rolling back in my head. No, I wasn't on anything other than a sashimi high! ;)\n\nI'm not a fan of the pork belly, as the fat-to-meat ratio is essentially 100/0. I eat a looot of pork belly and can't say I've ever had pork belly this rich or heavy in my life. You may like it but I found that it threw off the balance of my meal with its especially sweet buttery flavor. At $12 for two pieces, I did not feel like it was worth it. I'll stick to fish fat next time. :)\n\nOtoro put a huge smile on my face that day and remains one of my favorites for sushi in the city. Thanks Sugai-san, totoro out!", "author": "Jenny Q."}

Umami!\n\nAsk which of the nigiri is seared, and get those.  O-Toro uses something like a creme brulee torch to sear the tops of the fish every so slightly.  You get a very light charred flavor while still experiencing the delicious raw fish underneath.

Let start from the beginning, I came here after work and I heard great reviews about the place so why not give it a try! I'm a fatty when it comes to good food and trying new place, we ask the chef can we have an custom omakase menu with of course including the O-Toro on the menu as well. The chef was nice enough to accommodate us with a wide variety of selection. The food is good, however for the price and portion it's not worth the value. You can get much better quality for a slightly better price and much better dinning experience at other restaurant such as Kusakabe near by. BUT this place stand out because of the no hassle, no reservation needed. For a party of 8 our total was around $1,100 including tips and 2 order of the yuzu sake.

The food was good, but it was nothing special. \n\nAMBIANCE: It's a very cozy restaurant with sushi bar and not that many tables. We made reservations on opentable so it wasn't a problem, but some people who walked in to a full restaurant opted to wait. \n\nFOOD: The dishes are small so it's like izakaya style where you order a bunch. However, there are also ramen and udon options if you want your own bowl of noodles. \nDO's: They have a good selection of nigiri sushi. We tried the toro, their namesake & at $12/2 pieces.... it's not cheap, but that's the usual. But toro is really rich & fatty, you should try it once in your life. Somewhere. Many of their rolls also sounded good. My favorite was the Kabocha tempura roll with albacore. Their sashimi was also pretty fresh and tasty. They like to boast that some of their fish is flown in from Japan, and I can believe it. I would also recommend the shishito peppers stuffed with albacore tuna, except a few of our peppers were a bit too charred in my opinion. \nDON'Ts: kalbi ($12). So we shouldn't have ordered kalbi from a \"Japanese\" restaurant. Smallest pieces of kalbi I've ever seen. For $12. The Hip-Hop roll was also pretty boooooring. I don't understand why people highlighted it on yelp. The scallop dynamite was also big on the mayonnaise, easy on the scallop, which I didn't care for as much. \n\nSERVICE: Average. Whatever. Mundane. Nothing special. A-OK. \n\nDon't be fooled by the abundance of good ratings here. This is really just average Japanese food in my opinion.

The prices for nigiri ($5.50-12 for two pieces) were, in my opinion, much more reasonable than the special rolls which came in at around $15 for 7 pieces.

I called and placed an order for dinner 2 days ago. Everything is fine until I arrived to pickup our food. The food wasn't ready, but the male host decided it is not important to inform me. Instead, he wanted to take my payment the moment I walked in. When he returned with my cc, he did not feel it's important to make sure he handed it to me. So he carelessly left my cc and receipt on the railing which leads from the front door into the restaurant. This was not as if I'm sitting down at a table so it would be acceptable to leave it in front of me. He left it in the open, away from me, and did not bother to make sure I get it back. With that kind of carelessness with my cc, I do not think I'm going back for a while. After taking my payment, he left me standing by the door for a good 10 mins, never bothered to offer if I wanted to sit down.\nNext the food. I ordered 3 different rolls and 1 special roll, total 4 orders. Imagine my surprise when the host handed me a single take-out container. The fact that a single take-out container holds food worth $41 was already shocking enough. When I arrived home, I discovered that not only was the portion small, but we can clearly see sushi being physically jammed into the container to make them fit.

The restaurant just didn't leave an impression of wanting to come back especially when we have an amazing place right around the corner from our house.  If you're not a sushi lover, there are other items on the menu so they do have a variety.", "author": "Inga W."}

Highly recommend reservations, the place was almost full at 7 PM and by 7:30, had a few groups waiting. Called earlier in the afternoon and had no problems putting my name down for 7:15.\n\nThe Pork Belly was definitely the highlight! Can't say that 2 pieces for $8.95 was easy to justify though. Flavor was perfection and it was fatty goodness, but the price is steep for the two layered hunks of meat/fat/skin that you receive in a small bowl. \n\nRainbow Roll + Lava Roll were just fine. Appreciated that the shrimp tempura in the Lava was crunchy, even after 20 min, and that the Rainbow Roll had real crab in it. However, the flavors for both were underwhelming and generally not impressive. They both tasted like rolls ordered at any other sushi establishment, albeit smaller, less tasty, and more expensive.\n\nService was okay. Took a noticeable while to get my friend's and my orders taken and to receive our food, and only received a check-in/water refill at the end of the meal. \n\nAlso, $4.95 for one piece of red bean mochi was no bueno. My friend hadn't had it in a while so he opted for it, but I would personally get dessert anywhere else. We even got Loving Cup rice pudding after the meal, since we weren't full!    \n\nWould come back only if in the area, rejected by Domo, and keeling over from sushi cravings.

Otoro has constant specials going on and mouth watering seasonal dishes. I've tried both their lunch and dinner menu and have been equally satisfied with both. The sashimi is incredibly fresh and presentation has always been absolutely perfect. \n\nI always seem to start with good ol' miso soup, a wonderfully flavored broth. Their tapas are delicious! Hawaiian poke, agedashi tofu, ankimo monkfish pate, plain edamame, halibut and amberjack sashimi to start. OMG soooooo good. The portions are perfect for just a little taste of everything.

You kinda have to expect some sort of wait for a place this small. \n\nAs others have mentioned, the service was pretty subpar, and this is coming from someone who normally doesn't pay attention to service. Growing up with Chinese restaurants has made me not care if a restaurant's staff is rude or unwelcoming. As long as I get my food in a timely manner, I'll be happy. When we were seated, we ordered a small bottle of sake which never came. By the time we figured that we weren't gonna get our sake, we just decided to not have it, and it wasn't charged on our bill. \n\nThe food wasn't that great, either. There were some real quality issues with the fish here. They were out of certain fish that day, so maybe it's been a while since the previous shipment?\n\nAnkimo - A lot of the ankimo pieces tasted a bit too fishy. The texture also could've been smoother, and chunks kept falling apart when I tried picking them up.\n\nOtoro Sashimi - I liked that the pieces of fatty tuna were pretty large, but there was a lot of connective tissue that made it tougher. The center of each slice was also cold. This made the tuna not taste as rich or have that melt in your mouth effect because the fat didn't render.\n\nHalibut Sashimi - Dry and a little rubbery.\n\nSaba - Fishy, and the texture was a bit tough.\n\nGarlic Albacore Nigiri - The albacore was very mushy.\n\nAmaebi - Could've been sweeter, but the fried heads didn't taste bad. The batter was a bit thick though, and the head was strangely stale. My friend complained that hers tasted very bitter.\n\nGlazed Black Cod - This was probably the best fish of the meal. It was rich and smooth, but the glaze was too sweet for my liking. It got in the way of the fish's natural flavor.\n\nOriginally, we were planning to add some more food to our small order, but we didn't feel like staying.

One waitress came over with a dirty plate, smiled and greeted us asking what we wanted for drinks. My boyfriend couldn't hear her because it was too loud in there with everyone chatting it up.

Then she interrupts saying I can't take your order right now as you can see my hands are full I can't write anything down, all I asked was what drinks would you like I'll get them first then take your order when I get back with your drinks.

Since we weren't in a rush, we didn't mind, but this is something to keep in mind if dinner is the first thing on your night's itinerary. \n\nAs I mentioned, O-toro is a small space - there are only a handful of tables and some spots at the bar. Our party of 5 fit comfortably, but I'm not sure much larger groups would be able to sit together so I'd call and ask before arriving. \n\nOnce seated, we ordered appetizers, including the baked green mussel and stuffed shishito peppers. Both were flavorful and tasty, though the shishito peppers were my top pick if I had to choose. These pack heat so be warned if you have sensitive tastebuds!\n\nWhen it came to sushi, our group decided to divide and conquer, ordering almost every specialty roll on the menu. My favorites included the Otoro, Golden State, Hip Hop, and Dreamy Sensation. I highly recommend trying these four as the flavors and fish vary enough that you can appreciate the quality and variety of a number of rolls, yet they all complement each other nicely. \n\nThere are a lot of reviews for O-toro that say it's overpriced, but I was pleasantly surprised at how low our bill was given how much food and drinks we ordered.

All tables were already filled when we arrived but fortunately it was only a short wait. Seated at the sushi counter right in front of their daily special chalkboard. I was delighted to find out they have Butterfish, one of my favorite sashimi cut. To those who haven't tried raw butterfish, the texture is actually not buttery but rather firm and crisp. The butterfish nigiri I ordered was of good quality. Sawara (Barracuda) nigiri, garnished with green onions and radish, was fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe maki were quite delightful as well. Ordered two of their specials - Takashi (Pumpkin Tempura top with Garlic Albacore) and Omega Spicy (Avocado top with Salmon Belly). Takashi was great. The garlic sauce on albacore topping was a good contrast to the mellow sweet pumpkin tempura. The salmon belly topping on the Omega Spicy was amazing. They were these kisses that melt in your mouth and leave a lingering sensation on your tongue. Unfortunately the filling was plain and the portion is tiny. They are really quite stingy with the sashimi toppings. Krabby (eel Avocado and Snow Crab) on the regular menu was good but ordinary. \n\nMany patrons ordered their warm izakaya dishes that looked quite promising. I heard they serve bi-rite ice-cream. You really can't go wrong with that. The decor of O-Toro might look posh and trendy but the service, despite being a bit slow at times, was friendly and down to earth.

I really didn't love anything though all of it was aight. My friends did enjoy the food but, lets be honest, I'm much more into food and actually write Yelp reviews so I'm a little more into the details.\n\nEveryone on Yelp writes about this spicy tuna roll which I just wasn't a fan. I do like that they change up this otherwise boring roll with mango but, similar to most spicy tuna rolls, the fish just didn't taste that fresh and it was a Saturday night. Other rolls included the Golden State in which the lemon on top was crazy over powering and not subtle at all and the Cherry Blossom with salmon and tuna, which was quite delightful and my favorite of the evening. The short ribs weren't that meaty and extremely charred. Though to be honest I've never had the rib version of the dish. I always find it delicious and heavenly in my burrito or rice dish so, I really don't have much to compare it to rib style but again wasn't the hugest fan. \n\nOverall, we didn't pay a boat load for in my opinion for quite a bit of sushi and a few beers and if in the 'hood definitely check it out, you can tell it's quite popular.

It ended up being a really fun night of sharing stories with new friends and tons of really great food (a mixture of cooked dishes and sushi).\n\nOn my second visit to Otoro I came with seven other friends; problem was I'd only made a reservation for six. Again the same affable host made it work (starting with nigori near the bar and then moving us to a table). I sat across from our group's vegan and ate mostly veggie sushi this go round. I enjoyed myself as much, if not more, than the previous visit.\n\nStandouts: garlic soft shell crab, spicy tuna roll (seriously, this one is special), spinach goma-ae, BI-RITE toasted coconut ice cream.\n\nOtoro is tiny and usually packed so make a reservation before turning up.", "author": "Miriam W."}

The ankimo is actually one of the best ive had in the city. They used like a citrus based sauce or something but its really refreshing for the palate. Their chicken skin and hearts, beef tongue and spare ribs are really good too. But i wasnt happy with the rolls. it was good but its very typical(like i could have it somewhere else at a cheaper price). There was nothing much special with the taste of the rolls( I had the Spider, Dragon and Cherry Blossom). So i felt like it wasnt worth the money. \n\nAmbiance and Service- Theyre both good. The place is quiet enough that you can talk to each other but still have the feeling of a lively atmosphere and the service is really good.

While not cheap, it was all excellent, and I would gladly come back and pay at O-Toro vs. other places. The rice was a perfect consistency, the fish slices generous, and the flavors rich and buttery. I was impressed by my first bite, and that wasn't an anomaly. High marks for the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was quiet and calm (but not casual) and had a \"neighborhood restaurant\" feel, with good, prompt, but non-intrusive service.

We learned about three  basic types of sake; each requires different brewing methods and a different percentage of rice milling. \n\nOut of three yakitori orders (chicken, chicken heart & fried chicken skin), the best was the skin (crispy and light). \n\nThe otoro was beautifully fatty and marbled (melts in your mouth like butter). The presentation for the aji was breathtaking and upon finishing the meat, the aji bone, head and tail are deep fried. It tasted like fish potato chips (flavorful, amazingly light as air and crunchy). My favorite was the Madagascar blue shrimp sushi which was really light blue in color with the head deep fried. \n\nAmbience is intimate and great service considering one waitress.

I made a quick mental note to swing by \"soon.\"\n\nFunny thing is, when you least expect an obsession to take root, I decided that \"soon\" had to be that night, no exceptions. \n\nI found parking right away around the corner on Gough Street (beware the crazy drivers careening down that street to cross Market and get onto 101). \n\nAs I walked in, the entry was sexy and stunning, a beautiful yellow orb and sleek black stools and tables with gorgeous lights gently illuminating the bar and the tables.\n\nThe atmosphere is really amazing, very inviting. My only  complaint is I had a damn hard time reading their menu given the low lighting. I guess that's a small price to pay to soak up some great ambiance.\n\nI admit, I went a little nuts ordering both a large plate of sashimi and two speciality rolls. I first started with butterfish, toro and hamachi sashimi and then their O-Toro roll (spicy tuna, avocado topped with cooling mango) and the Lava roll (shrimp tempura and cucumber inside with tuna on top with spicy sauce). \n\nAs another Yelper mentioned, I liked how O-Toro does their rolls: They're tightly packed so you can pop a whole piece in your mouth without looking like a fool. \n\nMy little one had O-Toro's yakatori (I sampled, it was tender and delicious) and he very adventurously (hey, he's only 4) had their Bi-Rite black sesame seed ice cream that he really liked.\n\nI really love that there's a superb sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. This is going to be my \"go-to\" spot when I'm really craving sashimi and sushi. \n\nI'm going back \"soon.\" So that means, probably tomorrow night (O-Toro is closed on Sunday).", "author": "Jennifer O."}

It's a small, loud kind of place, with a trendy, modern approach to sushi and Japanese style small plates or Izakaya.  I think the only reason we would have come here was because I was able to get a reservation -- otherwise, we might have been waiting a long time, even for bar seats.\n\nThe food was good, if not remarkable -- the Otoro (fatty tuna) sashimi was a nice treat.  Prices were a little high, but not unreasonable.  The biggest problem was the clientele, and the seating.  Because we were *so* closely crammed together, I couldn't help but overhear the conversations of not only the drunken, loud 40-something former-fratboy douchebags on my left, but also the drunken (and getting drunker) mimosa-swilling, brunch-ruining, Berkin-bag swinging Marina girl douchebags on my right.

Oh well, you live and you learn; it was still delicious. They even add mango and cucumber slices on the plate, to compliment the hamachi.\n\nLive scallops-- Good. Fresh. Tiny. Maybe we got a baby scallop..\n\nLive uni-- Not good. In fact, it was bitter. \n\nNigiris: Hotate (we thought this was a better deal than another live scallop), sake belly, hamachi belly, amaebi, kanpachi, otoro-- Nigiris were fresh = Great!\n\nCherry blossom roll-- Decent.

My brother and I originally wanted to go to another izakaya restaurant in the area but it was on a 2.5 hour wait so we trusted yelp and found ourselves at O-toro! The restaurant is small and only has a few tables but that makes it that much more charming and cozy. \n\nWe ordered a few small plates as well as many of the different sushis - delicious! We started off with agedashi tofu which was good per usual. Light crispy tofu - deceivingly filling. We also ordered the Hamachi carpaccio which there are enough reviews on but it was pretty good! Not amazing at first but the fish was so fresh and the side mango/ refreshing veggie (not sure what it was) made the combination outstanding.  \n\nWe ordered a variety of sushis and they all melted in your mouth. Our favorite was the albacore tuna. It was both of our first times trying it and I just have to emphasize that the sushi just melted in our mouth. \n\nTwo things we'd probably pass on next time: sea eel and the scallop dynamite. I like eel and there was nothing wrong with it but it wasn't amazing like the other sushis - just good as you would find at another good Japanese restaurant. Scallop dynamite is not what we expected. We thought it'd be raw scallops but it was cooked in cheese and kimchee.

It's a small place a few blocks northwest of the Civic Center BART station. It has a relaxed vibe, a good date type sushi joint without overbearing loud music.\u00a0You get what you pay for, and while our bill was $60 each with tax and tip, it was worth every cent.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n**Hamachi Carpaccio : 5 pieces of Hamachi doused in Ponzu and layered with avocado and some mango on the side. Amazing. Perfectly paired, and very fresh.\u00a0\n**Ocean trout: Just a good tasting salmon that I could eat over and over again.\u00a0Fresh and delicious.\n**Butterfish sashimi: light and a little buttery. Good, but preferred the other sashimi dishes over the butterfish.  \n**Cherry blossom: can't go wrong with ahi covered rolls with salmon inside. It was tasty, and quite large.  \n**Nigiri Hamachi: Tasted fresh, and came out in good size pieces.  \n\nOut of all the places I visited over the past week, O-Toro was at the top of the list in regards to fish freshness.  Every plate came with good size sushi pieces, and felt I got good value for the price. The rolls seem to be bigger than the standard type rolls I have had at other sushi restaurants.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back again.", "author": "Humberto G."}

We ended up going with the Otoro (fatty tuna), Walu (butter fish), Kanpachi, Albacore sashimi, baked green mussels, pork belly, and shishito peppers stuffed with spicy albacore.  With the exception of the shishito peppers (I thought the albacore would be raw but it was cooked), everything was amazing.  The fish just melts in your mouth and is so incredibly fresh.  Mussels had a crack sauce that was to die for.  And omgahhh..the pork belly!  The softest pork belly ever and even the fatty part, which I usually try to avoid, just melted like butter in your mouth.  All that ended being less than $80 before tip.

I figured if she was stretching my comfort zone with opera, I was going to be passive aggressive and make her eat sea urchin.  Worked out better than expected on both counts!\n\nWe had three rounds, from \"beginner\" to \"advanced\", hah.\n\nROUND 1 - Kani (crab), hamachi (yellowtail), maguro (tuna)\nAll solid, hamachi was the star here.\n\nROUND 2 - Aji tataki (mackerel), barracuda\nThe aji tataki was one of the tastiest sushi dishes I've had in years.  Served in the hollowed out belly of the fish, there were plentiful pieces of sashimi, with a great ponzu dipping sauce that allowed you to mix in radish and ginger.  They then deep fried the skeleton for us so we can eat the bone -- awesome!  Barracuda was really tasty, but totally overshadowed by the aji tataki -- would order the aji for its own round in the future.\n\nROUND 3 - Uni (sea urchin), kampachi (amberjack), bonito (katsuo), tuna belly (toro)\nAmazing round.  The kampachi was just OK, but the bonito, uni, and of course tuna belly (I always treat it like desert and eat it last!) were all outstanding.  Awesome flavors and textures.\n\nWe also got the sake flight, which was excellent as neither of us had ever really experimented with sake before.  The flight came with notes on the general varieties of sake themselves, and then specific tasting notes for the sake chosen to represent each variety.  Great, educational, and fun experience.\n\nThey had an unbelievable list of daily specials, and all fish was flown in from Japan.  Incredible selection, and our waitress was very knowledgeable about what fish was particularly fresh and good today.\n\nI'm not sure I'd pay the steeper prices here if you were predominantly getting rolls, but if you want excellent quality nigiri and/or sashimi in a stylish, intimate space, this should be near the top of your list.", "author": "James S."}

Best version I've had lately. The grilled octopus was on the rubbery side which was difficult to chew.

We ended up ordering the cherry blossom roll, the hip hop roll, a california roll, an unagi avocado roll, and 2 pieces of sake. \n\nThe cherry blossom roll was my favorite out of everything we ordered. It consisted of salmon and avocado with tuna on top. I love sashimi, especially salmon, so it's no surprise why I liked this roll so much. It was very fresh and clean tasting. So simple, yet so delicious! \n\nThe hip hop roll was pretty good too. Shrimp tempura and avocado inside, garlic white tuna on top. The reason why I liked this roll a little less was because the garlic was pretty strong and overpowered the taste of the other ingredients at times. \n\nThe california roll was also good. Pretty standard and on par with what I've had at other sushi places. I happen to love unagi, so I really enjoyed the unagi avocado roll as well. As for the sake sashimi, it was fresh and yummy. Definitely not low quality stuff! \n\nFor dessert we shared the black sesame ice cream. It was good, but not as good as some of the other reviews made it out to be. Needless to say, I had high expectations for the ice cream and I was a little disappointed. \n\nAs for the restaurant itself, decor here was cool and contemporary.

My friend and I waited patiently and 20 minutes passed before we asked the owner how much longer. He confirmed that it would be \"very soon\". By the time we got seated it was 7:40 -- at this point my friend was pretty frustrated because if we had known we would have needed to wait more than 30 minutes we would have made a reservation elsewhere at the get-go. Also, the owner should have provided more accurate estimates / set our expectations of the wait instead of \"very soon\" as what we considered \"very soon\" (less than 10 minutes) turned quickly into a 40 minute wait. \n\nWe got seated at the bar and ordered the following:\n\nJapanese Tapas (Hot Dishes): Nasa Denguku (Japanese eggplant with miso sauce)\nSushi: O-toro, Uni, Hirame\nSpecial Rolls: Hip Hop, Golden State\n\nOverall the food was amazing - I love sushi and the fish here was very fresh and tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-27", "description": "The low rating comes from two reasons:\n\n1. quality of sushi: fish is not fresh---if you ever had fresh sushi in Japan, you know the texture of the fresh fish.  The sushi and sashimi served here were so soft that they were weeks old.  I seriously doubt whether the sushi chef is Japanese or not: the sushi rolls were so loose that they easily fell apart before they were even picked up.  No real Japanese sushi chef with any self-respect would produce a roll of this low quality.\n\n2. Exceptionally small portion size.  This is in comparison to the regular dish portion size of japanese restaurants, which are already small.  Even when compared to those in Japan, these dishes are on the small side, but with a much higher price.  On top of this, the caterpillar roll barely had any fish in it, mostly avocados.  \n\nThe quality of food here does not justify the price in any possible way.  It is not authentic in quality, fish, skill or price.  Do not recommend it.", "author": "Kim L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-30", "description": "On food alone, O-Toro warrants somewhere around 3.5 stars. The fish is cut very well, is the right temperature and tastes fresh. I had the walu (butterfish) sashimi, sawara (barracuda) sashimi, salmon avocado roll, hamachi avocado roll and Oka sake to wash it all down. I'd highly recommend the walu, but I didn't think the sawara was worth the money. Several pieces of my salmon avocado roll came undone at first poke, which is never a sign of quality craftsmanship. However, the rice was the right flavor and texture and the avocado was fresh. \n\nAtmosphere is around 4 stars. It's dark, small and chic like so many other trendy sushi restaurants.\n\nNow the service. Oh my lordy, the service. I don't know if they were severely under-staffed that night or what, but there was one man doing three roles--host, waiter and server. To say that he was frustrated would be an understatement. I do communications for a living so I can read people pretty well, and this guy had a severe case of \"overworked defensiveness syndrome\". Every question I asked him (and I only asked a few) was met with a snippish, peevish-sounding defensive response. \n\nFor example, I asked him if it would be all right if we put our names down and walked around outside while we waited for our table (he told us it would be 20 - 30 min), rather than standing around in the claustrophobically small restaurant. His immediate response was, \"What? What do you mean? Okay, fine, if that's what you want.\" Awkward silence as I waited for him to ask for my name and all he did was stare at me angrily. Finally, I asked, \"Shall I give you our names?\" Immediate frustrated retort of, \"Can't you see I'm busy? I'll get to you when I have a chance!\" Even though he'd specifically led me to a free computer and had his finger poised over the on-screen reservation system to (I assume) take down my name. (If your expression right now is \"???\", well...so was mine.)\n\nHe got a little nicer as the evening wore on and fewer people came in. I think the fact that I ordered sake and my friend ordered wine also helped, since he was also our waiter. However, he committed a major faux pas. When I pointed to the \"Fresh of the Day\" specials on the board and asked him what the fish were in the form of, he told me it was sashimi. Seeing as most were priced ~$6, I figured these specials probably only came in 1-2 pieces. Imagine my surprise when my bill arrived and the sawara and walu were ~$15 each. When I spoke to the guy about this, he claimed that he had DEFINITELY told me the prices were for sushi...and of course sashimi was more expensive (condescending look). Thankfully, my friend spoke up and confirmed that she had heard him say sashimi also, and only then did he decide to believe us and apologized several times for the misunderstanding. He did not, however, offer to do anything about the bill and that is a grave mistake in my book. If you mislead a customer and misquote a price (esp with a $10+ difference), it is only good customer service to honor the misquoted lower price that YOUR stupid mistake caused. \n\nI'm Asian and I grew up with brusque customer service. This went beyond brusque. It was downright awful service. With so, so many sushi choices in the Bay Area, don't come here. Save yourself the headache and expenditure, and go somewhere where you'll actually be treated with courtesy and respect.", "author": "Josephine L."}

We arrived on time but had to wait 15 minutes before we were seated. And even then we weren't given a table; we were placed at the bar. I was extremely disappointed in this poor service and the host gave no indication he was sorry for the wait.\n\nAs for the food itself, the sushi was good but not great. We split two rolls -- the rainbow and the spicy tuna. Though the sashimi was good and obviously high quality, I was disappointed by the tuna used in the roll. Rather than use sashimi for the spicy tuna roll, the chefs used a premade mixture of what looked liked canned tuna cat food. \n\nOn the plus side, the food was fairly priced. For two rolls, gyoza, and edamame, we paid about $30. I'd say it's comparable to the quality. \n\nIn the future, I'd probably order takeout from here avoiding the tuna rolls and focusing on sashimi, but I would not eat in the restaurant again due to their very poor service and disorganized reservation system.", "author": "Kate O."}

The produce was likewise flawless. One roll we ordered had tiny perfect peeled and translucent slivers of lemon placed on top of salmon- a triumph of a flavor profile. \n\nThe Bad: It's a small gripe, but they serve soda in cans, so no free refills. Call me tasteless, but I want Diet Coke with sushi and I had to be content with one. \n\nOverall: Beautiful, small sushi joint with an excellent color scheme, good help, and great food.

The food here is awesome, but was pretty expensive!\n\nThe spot is a very clean and trendy alcove in the middle of the street. Really like the dark greyish tones that are set off by the lights in this place. There are about 6 or 7 four person tables and about 8 spots along a bar area. This tends to be a popular place to eat so a wait should be expected if you don't have reservations.\n\nI recommend taking a look at the specials before taking a look at the menu itself, because I ended up ordering several specials. The menu does have some of the standard rolls that one might be looking for at other sushi restaurants. With my friend, we ordered some individual orders of Sashimi and about 4 rolls, the Grasshopper and the Negi Toro off of the set menu, and two rolls of the specials menu, which I cannot remember off hand. The sushi was very fresh and this amounted to a very fulfilling meal. We were not able to try their tapas, which is actually more what this place is known for, so there will most likely be a second trip involved. Otherwise, the food provided was good. We supplemented this with a sampling of sake from the \"gold\" list.\n\nThe waiter and waitresses were very nice and courteous. The owner asked us how we were doing. He even told us about the significance of the $1 dollar bill on the registrar, ie the first dollar registered at the restaurant. A lot of places do this... I know, but it's still respectable and down to earth. However, like I said before, the value is somewhat hard to justify as the meal ended up being upwards of 35 dollars each person.

That usually means the food is good right? But of course.  We went here for a friend's birthday because they serve uni, which is sea urchin, and he loves it. Now , as I mentioned in a previous review on Japanese restaurants, I'm more of a bento box girl. Reason being is probably because one does not have to wait to eat a bento box, but sushi......sushi is such the hipster thing and I pride myself in not fitting into that category. Also, when I'm hungry, I despise waiting in line for food. Okay, no diss to sushi, but having grown up with rice, I like more substance than rice and either a whole entree or bento box suffices my Japanese food fix.\n\n   We did open table on line, but when we got  there, just like I have already predicted,  there was a line out the door. Now I say this because literally, there are about seven tables and a sushi bar that maybe sat about eight people. There were two parties ahead of us, and he asked us if we had already made a reservation. Despite reserving on line on open table for our slot, we still had to wait until after three more parties. So if you are planning, call and speak to a live person if you so choose to dine here. I don't think he has time to check the internet for reservations. When he realized that we still had to wait despite our on-line rezi, he finally offered possibly having some drinks while we wait. More than anything I think it was just his way of keeping up quiet so that we don't reem his ass for being too stressed out to accommodate us. \n\nOtoro has  a good selection of Japanese tapas, cold dishes, hot dishes, ramen, donburi, and of course, sashimi and sushi: vegetarian, makis, and special rolls. The sushi is fresh and delectable. This is the reason why I'd give this place a four. But as you can see, our experience minused a star that they should deserve.\n\nSo I mentioned that it was a friend's birthday. Well, I took it upon myself to make the host aware of this and he said,\" Buy some dessert and put a candle on it.\" Wow. I don't know if he's just used to the snooty hipsters or yuppy folk that patronize this restaurant, but where I'm from, born and raised in the SF, when you inform a restaurant that one of your party has a birthday, they comp you something to show appreciation and show love. Lamentably, my friend is a diabetic, but he could have put  his best foot forward and tried even the most slightest acknowledgment of this. I guess his offering of a candle in a sushi was his way of doing so. \n\nI'd go back here for the sushi, but I wouldn't hold my breath for the host.", "author": "Granolia G."}

Jimmy greeted me, and he was AWESOME.  He suggested I wait 15 minutes to see if a party with a 7pm reservation was a no-show.  I waited, and they didn't show.  He promptly awarded me and my friends the table, and was generous enough to find us a close parking spot.  \n\nDinner was sublime.  The Hamachi carpaccio with truffle oil was one of the best carpaccio dishes I've ever had; we were trying to find anything possible to dip into the  sauce once we finished the fish.  As if that weren't enough, I couldn't recommend the Takashi roll even more.  The exquisite blend of sweet pumpkin and garlic albacore was brilliant.  And then there was the Kakuni (pork belly).  Holy crap - sweet and tender - true decadence (we secretly drank the sauce when we finished).  \n\nWe also had the walu and hamachi sashimi, both of which were wonderfully fresh and generous in portion.\n\nJimmy took great care of us personally, having a special roll prepared that included salmon, asparagus, and jalapeno topped with sriracha sauce.

Place is tiny in a highly trafficked area and the door was kept wide open to accommodate the line. It was windy that night and unpleasant while waiting. \n\nI was soon offered a counter spot but I told host my friend had texted me he was 3 minutes away, so he would not seat us until we were both there. He let a few people that were behind in the line, go in front of me twice. Place only seats about 20 so when I saw him give away the two stools at the counter I knew that meant death!!\n\nLong story short we waited over an hour and 20 minutes and the whole experience ruined the meal. It was too late to go anywhere else, and the higher-end restaurant on the corner was overflowing with people as well, Host was just incredibly rude and complacent (Yuan N. calls him \"despicable\" in his review down below) and when we expressed our dissatisfaction with his rigidity and ironic style he told us \"if we weren't happy we should leave his place\".\n\nIt's tough to justify paying over $100 for a small meal for two when as a patron one is made to feel frustrated and undignified by putting up with such unacceptable behavior. This whole situation could have been neutralized by offering to buy us a beer and/or offering some kind of veiled apology. Host made us feel like we owed him something for \"letting\" us eat there.

But I think I'm starting to get the hang of \"good sushi\" vs \"great sushi\". O-Toro is within about 5 minutes from me, and I can't stray away from their Golden State roll! It's so good! You can really taste the crab meat, and the salmon on top always tastes so fresh. I'd like to try other things on the menu, but then I read the description of golden state roll again and keep ordering it!!\n\nI've only tried one other sushi place in Hayes Valley, Domo. Domo was good, but it's more of trendy, warm, topping covered sushi. O-Toro is more traditional, basic sushi. I've never eaten in the place, but it's pretty nice inside and seems like a good place for a date or something. It's not very big, so you might want to get a reservation. But it never seems TOO crowded either.\n\nAnyways, this place is my local spot for when I'm craving sushi. They don't give you any shit for using a card. It's a little pricey, but a good treat for the end of the week. Also, I don't give out many 5's unless I'm REALLY wowed by something, so 4 is pretty high for me! If you're craving sushi in this area, come check this place out.", "author": "Mike C."}

We started off with our least favorite dish of the night, grilled shishito peppers stuffed with spicy albacore. While the grilled peppers were sweet and delicious, the albacore filing was underwhelming. But the dishes kept getting better and better.\n\nNext, came grilled hamachi belly nigiri. The light grilling imparted a smokiness to the hamachi, which was sweet, richly marbled, and creamy. \n\nThen, we had the tori karaage. I'm a dark meat girl. And these were my personal kaarage heaven. Tender, juicy pieces of chicken thigh meat, battered and deep fried until golden. Usually, I prefer a dipping sauce for my karaage, but these were perfect with a light squeeze of lemon. \n\nThe 2 sushi rolls we had were so memorable. The combinations were creative, yet simple. First, a black & white roll: asparagus tempura and butterfish. The asparagus tempura was fresh out of the deep fryer and an excellent contrast to the sweet butterfish and salty black cod roe. Next, the takashi roll: pumpkin tempura and garlic albacore. Yet again, the pumpkin tempura was crisp and newly fried. But the garlic albacore was the star of this roll. I've never had anything like it. The albacore was infused with an intense garlic essence that was a surprisingly ideal counterpoint to the sweet pumpkin. \n \nI'm extremely happy to have found a local sushi joint with 1) high-caliber sushi quality and 2) innovative, creative sushi rolls that respect the integrity of the ingredients. I cannot wait to return and try more dishes off the daily specials menu!", "author": "Monelle A."}

Also while we were dining it took slightly longer than I would have liked to get our waters refilled as well as to flag down the server for the bill at the end of our meal however this may have been due to the busyness of the night as the servers were constantly moving thought the evening. \n\nWith the above being said I did enjoy the night out and I will return in the future, I'll just be sure to make reservations or attend on a less busy night the next go around.", "author": "Josh O."}

Small venue, but seemed easy enough to get a seat at the bar.  Definitely hit the spot.\n\nTori Karaage: From Oakland to Osaka, I guess everyone loves fried chicken!  Unlike like the Colonel's, these babies are all dark meat and without bones.  The chicken is ultra crispy and they have a light soy based sauce sprinkled on top to enhance the flavor.\n\nMiso Ramen: The noodles tasted fresh and hearty, not like those cubes of ramen from a deli.  The roast pork was a little bland, the side of it could have been marinated better.   It was tender though.  Liked that the bamboo shots were tender, you'd be surprised at the tough ones some places will try to pawn off, like you're a panda or something.  There was a glob of baby spinach which made me feel like it was healthy.  The broth itself was a lot saltier (i.e. tastier) than typical miso.\n\nShoyu Ramen: The ingredients were the same as the miso, but the broth was clear and full of soyliciousness.

The restaurant itself is extremely small and on this night, the entrance was packed with people waiting to be seated. Clearly, the waitstaff was overwhelmed because it took them a while to even acknowledge us and ask if we had a reservation. I happened to glance at the OpenTable monitor and thought no big deal, we're at the top of the list anyway and since two tables just got up to leave, we'll be seated right away. Better yet, they had preassigned us to one of the tables that left already. \n\nThen we waited for 15-20 minutes. It's funny how you can look at a restaurant and judge them by how good or bad they would be at Diner Dash. They would probably get a low score here. After giving our table away to a larger walk-in party, we were finally seated at the bar. \n\nFOOD:\nMiso Ramen - filling and large for one person but forgetful. We wanted to replace the urge of ordering miso soup. Pass next time.\n\n*Cucumber with miso sauce - very thinly sliced cucumber with a good amount of the miso dressing that was refreshing and a great start\n\n*Chicken Skin - horrible for your health but done well. Crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. Can't be worrying about what it says on the scale after this one.\n\nCherry Blossom Roll - typical roll with tuna and salmon but the flavors blended together, canceling out anything special about the roll\n\n*HIP HOP ROLL - The best thing about Otoro may just be anything with their GARLIC ALBACORE\n\nDespite the disappointment early on, Otoro made up for it with their food. And that's how I feel restaurants should be judged. Good luck finding a reservation and a parking spot though. \n\nFYI\nHealth score - 94 as of 12/2011\nParking - extremely difficult in this area at night\nWait times - longer than preferable", "author": "Dennis L."}

Last night, I went there and had an amazing 4Star experience.\n\nIt is clear the Japanese Tapas are the strength of O-Toro. We started with the Shushito stuffed peppers with Spicy Tuna, which is one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had at a sushi restaurant.\n\nSecond, we tried the vegetable gyoza, which was also fantastic. The gyoza are stuffed with a delicate veggie mixture that is not just bland, but has some kick and surreal flavor. The gyoza are lightly pan fried and crispy on the edges to perfection.\n\nFinally, we tried the Cherry Blossom roll and a simple Salmon Avocado with a few pieces of assorted sashimi. This time the fish and rolls seemed very fresh and full of flavor and not bland. Kudos!\n\nOriginal Review August 2012 - 3Stars\nI made my first visit to O-Toro last week and enjoyed the experience overall, but was left wanting/expecting more - especially at the price point. I was very excited to try O-Toro b/c there were several advertisements claiming the place to be Michelin recommended, which I know isn't a huge deal, but I expected more.\n\nOne key tip to know is this place is very tiny (maybe 8-10 tables, plus 6-8 seats at the bar), so during dinner hours, it's a really good idea to have a reservation, even for parties of 2, but certainly for parties of 4 or more.\n\nThe restaurant has a great ambience and feels very cozy. It is not very loud inside and the staff is incredibly helpful.\n\nOn our visit, we stuck mostly to sushi/sashimi and rolls and felt that the sushi was a bit bland and lackluster overall. Specifically, the specialty rolls were not that creative and were not that bold on flavors. The sashimi was certainly fresh and delicious, but serving sizes were very small given the price point.\n\nAfter looking back at our experience, I think I will come back and focus on ordering more of the Japanese \"Tapas\" / Small entrees on the menu, as those dishes seemed more creative and more adventurous. The couple next to us looked as though they were being amazed by their food, which was all hot food, in contrast to our sushi experience.\n\nMy final conclusion is that O-Toro's sushi is average, but likely has some unreal hot dishes that our authentic Japanese cuisine, which I am looking forward to trying when I return.", "author": "Justin O."}

And yes, this place was really tiny -  with no more than 6 tables at most this place can easily get packed on a weekend night.\n\nIt's sashimi seemed to be the highlight of this place so I quickly decided on a couple of different nigiri orders and rolls.\n\nButterfish nigiri - really lived up to it's name.  It  seemed to just melt in my mouth.  Although it wasn't as rich as toro, it still was worth it due to it was probably half the price of toro.\n\nSeared hamachi - my fav of the night!  They lightly seared the hamachi giving it a nice grilled flavor. To top it off they had a jalapeno on top of it to give it the extra kick it needed.  Absolutely delicious.  \n\nSpicy hamachi - it was good but nothing too out of the ordinary.  Consisted of a 6 piece roll that had the spicy hamachi in a mayonnaise sauce.  Something I've had before but it was still good. \n\nShout outs to the owner Jimmy who really took care of us from start to finish.

The gf isn't a huge fan of cream cheese in maki sushi, but I am.  The weird thing about the prices is that the maki rolls are either $6 or $12, nothing in between.  However it seems like a decent price for SF.  We only shared an order of salmon sashimi (5-pieces).  Although it was fresh, the texture was a little tougher than we're used to...I'm not sure how else to describe it.  And for $9, I would've expected closer to a full order of sashimi, like 8 pieces.

I arrived at 8:10 and wasn't greeted at the door for a while which didn't really bother me but the service went downhill from there so fast that I felt inclined to write this review. The waiter came over and asked 2 out of 4 of us what we wanted to drink and then walked off. He came back and asked what we wanted to eat and as we opened the menu up to remember what we wanted he walked off. When we finally got food ordered and to our table it was about 8:45. At 9pm we had a woman walk up to our table asking us to please pay because people had been waiting for our table for a while. What?? We had been there 45 min. She hovered around our table until we paid. I chugged my sake that I had to chase down our waiter for and left. The food was decent but there's other good places in the area that will treat you better, I don't plan on coming back.", "author": "Kristal G."}

I'd definitely come here again for Jimmy's kindness, the hot Korean waitress, and the funny old sushi chef.\n\nthe sushi:  super fresh.  we had a ton of different types of fish (I'm not a sushi snob but thankfully Eric knew what he was ordering).  everything had a good proportion of fish to rice.  I know that good sushi is indicated not only through its fish, but also through the rice.  Both were great!\n\nthe menu items:  YUMMY.  The black cod dish (aka: Tara) is a must.  It just melts in your mouth and it's delicious and warm. :)  The duck livers were interesting - i'm not a fan of liver, but as long as you don't tell me what it is.. i'll try it.  i actually ate the whole thing.  one special comment:  the fried wontons.  as an asian chick, i don't usually waste money on wontons (cuz i know it's usually a cheap menu item that isn't worth it usually)... but wherever they get their wontons.. yum!! oooh ooh and the fried chicken wings.. not your typical chicken wings.  lightly battered and gently fried.  good match to a cool glass of beer.\n\ndrinks:  I told Jimmy that i'm not a big drinker so he made me a really light lychee martini.  it was pretty good.  not the best i've had but it had a really cool garnish. :) \n\ndessert: OMG. you must end your meal with the black sesame ice cream.  this is my new favorite flavor. :)  as a high purveyor of ice cream.. i will rank this high on my list. :)\n\noverall a great experience and a great night to catch up with a good friend.  i would definitely recommend the place.  it's a small joint but you know it's good cuz it was continuously packed (and we were there for some time!!).

It's a tight squeeze at the bar too but we were at the end so a little more breathing room there. \n\nWe had a few appetizers - pork belly and seaweed salad. Pork belly was good though the meat a little overcooked when it was thicker. The fatty part was yummy. Seaweed salad is pretty routine - a small portion though. We got a few simple roles - none of the specialty roles. Roles were fine - nothing stood out but nothing to complain about either. I had an order of salmon sashimi which was good and fresh - thinner slices but decent portion. \n\nOverall, it was a good meal - 3.5 stars. Nothing over the top, but satisfactory. Staff is really nice so that's why I give a 4. I wish there were more options in SF for sushi/japanese. In comparison with So California/LA, I feel like SF is much more limited.

As I was wrapping up the bill at our table which was several feet from the bar, one of the waitresses accidentally knocked over one of those large ceramic sake carafes. It began to slowly roll toward the edge of the table. The waitress grabbed for it but it was just out of her reach. Acting on my innate ninja instinct, I lept about 6 feet forward landing on my right foot and catching the carafe with my left hand simultaneously. \n\nThe action in the restaurant paused for a moment and then everyone started applauding me.

The rolls were also not overloaded with sauces, which meant you could actually enjoy the flavor of the fish itself. \n- The atmosphere is cozy-neighborhoody.

We ended up sharing everything and here are my thoughts on all the items:\n\n-Otoro- despite the name of the restaurant, this wasn't very good. The color looked great, but there was a sinewy bottom to mine. Maybe it was a fluke, but I like my toro to be melt-in-the-mouth good. It's hard for the fish to melt in your mouth when there is a stringly part. disappointing for $12\n- Garlic albacore - absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. I would recommend this one. \n- Kanpachi(amberjack) - very good, very fresh.\n- Sake(salmon) - standard salmon, not bad not great.\n- Grilled chicken skin - squeeze some lemon on this..it is amazing. \n- Shoyu ramen - really good ramen considering this is a sushi place. I was pleasantly surprised, especially since I was bitching at my friend for getting ramen at a sushi join. Everything was on the slightly sweet side, but the soup was really soothing.\n- Spicy tuna toll - standard fair\n- Salmon skin roll - now, this item came out as an accident because the kitchen took my grilled chicken skin order wrong and thought it was salmon skin roll. I tried it without knowing what it is, and did not like it at all. To be fair, i never ever order salmon skin roll but out of the few times I've had salmon skin roll, they were better than this one. \n\nIt's a solid sushi place even though I'm sure there are better in the city.

We had the pork belly, which was very tasty, but a little heavy and strange to eat alongside sushi. We tried chicken heart skewers, which they seasoned and fried like no other, so it was very good, and did not taste weird like chicken heart normally kind of does.

We asked how much the platter left behind cost, and we were ignored for 30 minutes -- no water, all other orders withheld.

Perfect.\n\nRight at 5 they seat us...\n\nLooking over the menu I had pretty much figured I would be stuck with miso and rice for dinner...with with the way I was feeling, was fine with me... but to my surprise ...they had ramen on the menu!!\n\nI ordered the shoyu ramen (did I spell that right??) ... the boys ordered sushi ...and some sake flights.  Yes folks...just like when you are at a wine place and want to try a few kinds of wine...they have SAKE FLIGHTS!!\n\nEveryone was happy... we were thrilled... I mean seriously. This was the best ramen I have had outside my own house. The broth was flavorful but not fatty... (like some other ones have been in the past) ...but yeah.. YUM YUM YUM.\n\nWe made out of there for about 100 bucks....it was very well worth it. Everyone was smiles...we were totally full.\n\nI promise as soon as I am better...I will go back and try more things!

They were very accommodating with our rushed dinning needs and sat us right at the bar. Hands down some of the best Ahi Poke I have ever had with just enough heat to it. Along with their Black Cod so much so we ordered a second serving as dessert. Very casual with a modern feel. I loved it as a little date spot!", "author": "Hailey R."}

It's tucked away on Oak, a couple of streets down from the Hayes Street shops, restaurants and boutiques, nestled in a more residential area.\n\nImmediately upon entering, I was impressed by the clean, modern, warm decor - rich brown tones, high ceilings, great lighting and large windows that let in the sunlight.  Almost immediately, a cup of steaming green tea appeared before me - I hadn't even seen the server drop it off!  Shortly after my girlfriend joined me, tea was set before her, along with two plastic wrapped hot towels for us to clean off our hands.  Really, really impressive service.\n\nThey ordered a ton of rolls and sashimi, which they remarked was very fresh and tasty.  I ordered a seaweed salad and grilled octopus with ginger, which came to the table sliced in pretty, thin rings.  For the price and quality, I definitely thought it was a great value!\n\nThree girls who haven't seen each other in a month spend an inordinate amount of time catching up.  We were there for at least an hour after we had finished eating, and not once did they make us feel like we needed to leave.  No pointed fly-bys asking if we needed anything else, no slipping of the bill on the table before we asked for it.  Instead, they kept coming by to top off our teas so our drinks remained warm.\n\nFresh sushi and seafood, good portions, and EXCELLENT service!  That's my kind of restaurant!!", "author": "Janet L."}

Noodle is okay, wish it's a bit more al-dente.  Meat, not much, typical 1 slice of boiled pork without much flavor.  Few bamboo shoot and spinach.

Soba is average.\n\n-Otoro Roll\nSpicy tuna & mango goes well together.  \n\n-Krappy Roll\nReal crab meat with unagi.  Both goes well together.

The waitress asked nicely but could tell they want to get us out before peak hour starts.  I don't blame them as their space is very limited.  Anyhow we finished our meal before any line is formed.  Total bill: $56 + tips.\n\nIt's a decent place but I had better Japanese food somewhere else.  Worth a visit if you're in neighborhood as their price is reasonable with their quality and location.

If you like rolls go for the Lava Roll and the Otoro roll. They have an incredible appetizer of glazed black cod that just melts in your mouth.

We ended up ordering mostly from the sushi specials list, but included a few items off the regular menu as well.

The specials are all great, but about $2 more than anything you would order off the regular menu.\n\nFOOD: All of the sushi we ordered was fresh and well portioned, though a few pieces of nigiri were a little heavy on the wasabi. The walu sashimi was especially delicious.\n\nSERVICE was good enough. From what we observed, sitting at the sushi bar might be the best experience.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Modern yet cozy. There were maybe 10-12 tables and 8-10 spots at the sushi bar. Pretty easy to get a table, but toward the end of our meal, they stopped seating walk-ins to get ready for a party of 10.\n\nWILL WE COME BACK? Probably not unless we're already nearby.

We went on a Friday night at 7pm and the small place was busy, but we were seated right away.\nFood:\nChicken Soba- big bowl of noodle soup with only 3 slices of chicken (no exaggeration). The flavor was good and I can't complain about their generous portion, however the lack of chicken was comical.\n\nLava Roll- decent, nothing special, but again, good portion size for roll sushi.\n\nIkura (salmon roe/egg)- here's where the whole experience took a dive. This was the first piece of sushi my wife bit into. She immediately spit it out into her napkin and said it tasted rancid. We quietly brought it to the attention of our waitress who took the remaining piece and called over the manager. My wife explained that it was rotten and the manager laughed a little and told her that they make their own Ikura and so it tastes a little different than other places. My wife then told him that this didn't taste \"different\", it tastes rancid, like the eggs are old/bad. The manager continued to say that they had just eaten those for lunch and they were fine, as if we were stupid and didn't know the difference between rotten/smelling sushi and fresh, non-vomit inducing sushi.\nThe manager finally volunteered to take it off our bill. The rest of the meal was pretty much ruined by this bad experience.\nWhen we got our bill, they had not taken off the Ikura off our bill and we had to remind them.\n\nThere are plenty of good sushi places in the city and we will not be returning to this one.", "author": "Doug E."}

Arrived at the restaurant at 6:20 and found that the restaurant was tiny and was packed.  There was no host and no place to sign in.  Had to excuse 6 people to get to the bar and waited there for 10 mins and still no one came to acknowledge us.  Finally someone came and put down our names and told us the wait was 20 mins.   At 7pm, finally got seated at the bar thanks to some people had to leave without eating because they were out of time.  Ordered some simple rolls and waited until 7:20pm - still no food was presented.  Talked to the waitress and she promised that the food would be ready in 5 mins.

No, seriously, I live like three blocks away, my work place is farther than this restaurant. Works out great for me as now I have a decent sushi place that's within walking distance whenever I feel the need.\n\nDespite being in the border area that separates the gentrified part of Hayes Valley from the slightly scuzzy area near Civic Center/City Hall, O Toro is a nice, fancy little upscale sushi place, complete with the dim lights, wall of expensive sake, and wine glass candles. It's the kind of place you'd go on a dinner date to try and impress a lady - first since it's near a hip little neighborhood, second because it's Japanese, and third because it's classy. Joking aside, I loved the intimate atmosphere of the place, and I definitely felt a bit underdressed coming here in a t-shirt and jeans (my girlfriend and I were going to a concert at the Great American Music Hall right after, so... yeah).\n\nFood-wise the menu isn't terribly extensive. The main focus is the sushi, and they have all the types whether you want just a mix of tekka maki and California rolls, a hand roll, or just some nice big pieces of fatty tuna. Most of the entrees are the usual Japanese staples like donburi, ramen, udon/soba, etc. I liked what I had - soba with a Krabby roll - and I'm eager to try some of their other items. The price isn't exorbitant, but it's not cheap either.\n\nAlso, you definitely don't want to come here with a group of five or more, since it is an extremely tiny joint, as most sushi bars are. There are maybe seven or eight tables seating about four people each, though when I went most were occupied by couples. It's not bad if you eat early (like around five), but it fills up fast.\n\nThe staff was nice, specifically the one guy greeting all the customers and seating everyone. Very quiet, but efficient and quick. Though it did kind of strike me that, even though it's a small place, no ever came around to give us refills on water or ask for dessert or anything, and it took a lot longer than necessary to get the check despite the fact we were just sitting there at a near-empty table for a good 15 minutes. Yeah, don't mind us, we're just here taking up space, guys.\n\nOverall though I really did enjoy O Toro. I might start getting take-out from here (I saw a lot of others doing this) since the price is decent and the food is good. If you're in the neighborhood and want to try out a good sushi bar, O Toro is a good place to start - and end.", "author": "Will C."}

The spicy scallops were unique and delicious -- diced scallop in a spicy mayo sauce, served over seaweed-wrapped rice.  Also make sure to get the seared hamachi belly if they have it.  Lightly torched, and topped with sauce and tobiko.  And it was all delivered quickly.  The tuna was very fresh, and the salmon had a buttery texture that is rare to find.\n\n3) The sake selection wasn't huge, but it had some good picks on it.  The small bottle we ordered tasted exactly like the description in the menu.  How often does that happen?\n\nThe bad:\n\n1) Nigiri orders came with 2 pieces.  We had 3 people splitting nigiri.  Many sushi restaurants will let you get orders of 3 pieces, obviously scaling price as appropriate.  Not so here.  This left us having to split unevenly.

I ordered many different types of sushi and the pork belly appetizer.\n\nThe only problem I had was the fact that I'd made a reservation for 2 at 8:30pm, and when I arrived at 8:25pm, it took 5 minutes to finally be acknowledged by the host. Granted, it was busy, but when I finally told him that I had a reservation for 8:30pm, he told me that it would be a while before I could be seated. I then asked him if it was customary for reservations to be ignored, and he said no, that they are typically honored. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later, a table opened up and, to my surprise, he sat another couple that was waiting before I'd gotten there. I don't know for sure if they had a reservation, too, but I doubt it because I think the host would've said so when I told him of my reservation.  \n\nAnyway, I was optimistic and hoped that another table would open up soon, but after waiting another 10 minutes, I realized that my making a reservation didn't make any difference. It was ignored and I was being treated as a walk-in customer.\n\nOne of the things that also irked me was I noticed the couple that sat before us had drinks while waiting, and the host never offered us drinks despite the fact that we were the only ones waiting and we'd been waiting almost 20 minutes. I finally asked him if we could get a drink menu and he handed us one to share. He was very polite, but I was already upset at that point. When two seats opened up at the sushi bar, he asked us if that would be ok, and I accepted because I was tired of waiting. It was 8:55pm.\n\nAgain, the food was excellent, and my girlfriend and I had a great time, but I did walk away thinking that the night could've gone a lot smoother if they had honored my reservation and if the service had been better.", "author": "Marion L."}

It's where I transfer from the 21 to the 47.  And on one afternoon, I got off work early enough to grab a snack (my poor BF, he made some dinner that ended badly and no one wanted to eat it).  A snack means a miso soup, 1 order of aji, 1 order of ika, 1 order of kampachi.  It was less than $20.  \n\nWhile the ika was the best because of the shiso, the rest of the fish was not as...fragrant.  I have this theory that when fish is first caught, it has the scent of flowers.  Some wild, floral scent that fades as the fish is transported from fisherman to merchant to chef.  After too much time, it develops the \"fishy\" smell.  But somewhere in between, there's also a non-smell.  The fish here did not have any hint of the bad fishy smell.  But it was not as fragrant as some fish that I've experienced.

A specialty roll shouldn't cost $13 in my opinion. I was disappointed that rather than being filled with a beautiful slab of otoro, it was chopped instead. I can't remember if this was mentioned on the menu. \n\n- Less expensive rolls- 3 1/2 stars The spicy tuna and the Hawaiian where both tasty (the tuna was again chopped up, but I think this is fairly common for a spicy tuna roll) \n\n- Sake- 5 stars Great selection, reasonably price \n\n- Acoustics- 0 stars Just plain sucked. Way too loud. I know that tapestries probably don't fit in with the minimalist vibe this restaurant is trying to present, but they need more fabrics in there to absorb the sound.

When we walked in, I immediately liked the decor and atmosphere, but I will say the space is really small.  We walked in with no reservations and were quite lucky enough to be seated quickly.  \n\nWe only ordered sushi and did not venture into the other dishes, so I will say this review is strictly about the sushi.\n\nThe starter we had was tako (Hawaiian) poke, and it didn't really come out as poke.  The first thing I noticed was that it was missing spice, secondly it was covered with onions, and it was drenched in a soy based sauce.  I'm not sure what this was, but poke it was not.  The tako wasn't that fresh, as it had been resting long enough that it was chewy.\n\nThe next not so great bit was the maguro sashimi.  It had the right colors, but it was slightly off.  \n\nThe rest of the food was fresh and delicious.  Lorelei, Golden State, negi hama, aji, and o-toro.  Their rolls are a little different, but mix components that make them interesting and new.  For instance, the Golden State roll as thin slices of lemon on top of them which make them very citrusy; the lorelei comes with macadamia nuts sprinkled on top.  The aji and o-toro nigiri were delectable and slightly butter in taste from the fats in the fish.  \n\nThe service was amazing.  Out waitress in particular was great.  I would go back just to see here.  She even brought me some gelato for my birthday.  I think the staff is very attentive and pays attention to detail, so they have that nailed down.\n\nOh, and the sake which we ordered.  I found it very interesting how they poured it for us.  First the glasses were set in a little box container of sorts.  Then the sake was poured into the glass until it overflowed into the box.  I suppose that means you get your money's worth, but it's sad to see the little bit of sake spill over and not get drank.\n\nI would certainly come back here, but it may be worth calling in a reservation just in case.", "author": "Brent A."}

What happened was that they went above and beyond to make sure that we were able to enjoy our meal and make it to our show on time!

The rolls are nicely proportioned- not bites so big that you can't fit the whole thing in your mouth.

Otoro has a contemporary decor with good raw fish.  The key to the place is not to just order from the menu but to ask for whatever you like.  If you like himachi, ask the waiter for a special roll with that as the main ingredient.  If you like monkfish, get the monkfish liver pate (yummy!).

The chefs are chatty and apt and the owner is one of the most generous people I've encountered in awhile!\n\n1st time we stopped by everyone at the bar was given a free leechee martini for dessert. We were also comped a free beer. Very cool! 2nd time they put up with my GF being crazy loud and drunk & still gave us a free lechee martini! The 3rd was a normal night w/ no freebees but the same Japanese Mom and Daughter pair were there from the 1st time we visited. Which may say something good about the place (or they may be related to someone there). We left satisfied with the meal though.\n\nThe atmosphere is lighthearted but suave. This is one of few sushi places where I feel the apps and hot food is equal to the fish. Black Cod dish is highly recommended!

I assume the low-end prices are because it's relatively new and trying to gain popularity. But whatever the reason, I love it. Nigiri sushi seems to range from about $3-5 for 2 pieces. I just had the basic sake sushi (salmon), and it was incredibly fatty and soft as butter, some of the best I've had outside of Tokyo for the price. Will try the tuna/toro next time...\n\nAlso had the miso ramen (mediocre, but not terrible). It's huge, decent broth, flavorless noodles with decent texture, giant chunks of pork (didn't really like that...maybe I'm just used to the traditional thin slices). Anyhow, you can get a much better bowl at Katana-Ya near the Clift hotel in SF.\n\nAnother time, had the vegetable soba, which was quite good, but a tad salty. I'd have it again, though.\n\nFor the fish, this place -- so far-- is definitely a winner! Let's hope the prices stay low!!", "author": "Chris M."}

We were seated 8 minutes after.\n\nIt took another 30 minutes to get our rolls (small portions, btw). It was weird to see that our appetizer came last. Actually, it came 10 minutes after I mentioned it the second time. Who would have thought that it took half an hour to make vegetable tempura? Just admit that you forgot the order. Strike two. \n\nStrike three! Drunk obnoxious girl tips her drink off the table. I'm wet and there are shattered fragments on me. The waitress takes no lead in alleviating the situation, nor does the manager communicate with me in compensating for this inconvenience. The only concern was the liability of injury. Who cares that my jacket was wet or that shards cut into it?\n\nIt's unfortunate that we left nothing for tip. *Maybe except this: Your HUGE bathroom of one toilet + laundry extension can easily be cut in half. This will improve the use of space (+3 2-top capacity!) and your pathetic attempt in handling the flow of traffic. \n\nIn conclusion, the service was \"bleh\" so it made the food \"meh.\" \n\nFor all the readers.

Notable mentions are the sake kama, chicken wings, yakitori and braised butterfish.  For the most part, the dishes were not only delicious but also very easy on the wallet.  And now for the bad: the sushi.  The ingredients were fresh but the sushi rice was frankly, quite terrible.  It was slightly undercooked and lacked the requisite vinegar taste.  In addition, the nori in the rolls were very soggy when they arrived at our table, which is not how they are supposed to be.  So 4 stars for the cooked food but 3 stars for the sushi and a half-star deduction for how slow the food came out.", "author": "Sandy W."}

I cooked in a Japanese restaurant for 2 years and made sushi for 1 I am no expert but I know know enough to get by.\n\nThere may be better sushi but not for the price. \n\nChef Maki has excellent technique, a great presence, and his food is awesome. \n\n\nWe tried a ton of stuff but the two best were \n1. 2 piece garlic albacore nigiri \n2. 2 piece mackerel nigiri. \n\nI would say that the mackerel may have been the best piece of sushi I have ever had. He tucks in a small piece of fresh kelp which makes for an amazing taste. If you have never had mackerel or don't like it, try it here. Saba is stronger than most fish so keep that in mind.\n\nThey have amberjack and albacore which are more sustainable fish than most other fish which are high on the food chain like maguro and most hamachi. This is not the case for most places in the city. \n\nOne more reason to go is the variety of Japanese style hot dishes which are much more sophisticated than the typical fare at sushi joints.\n\nThe homemade gyoza were very tasty. 99% of places use frozen gyoza and charge the same price. \n\nWe had gyoza, two miso soup, two rolls, 4 two piece nigiri, 2 hot sake, and two large Kirins, for around $65.00. I left buzzed and full. \n\nGo here. Try the more interesting stuff. A spicy tuna is a spicy tuna. Try something which demonstrates chef Maki's creativity.", "author": "mac w."}

I didn't know they were there, and open for lunch.  An old colleague and I were lunching, and instead of walking up to Hayes, we went here.  As we walked in I noticed the music was playing (not too loud, but loud enough to enjoy the 80's tunes they were playin), and the place was empty.  We sat down, and looked at the menu.  One great thing, they were very reasonable priced.  The sushi looked fresh, and my friend was into the bento box more than the sushi, yet I wanted to try both.  We order a spider roll, and 2 bento boxes.  Her's was with beef teriyaki ($8.95) and mine was chicken teriyaki ($7.95), both came with miso soup, rice, and a great salad.  The presentation was nice, and not served in those funky square boxes that most places serve the bento's in.  It was on a nice white plate, and presented well.  The spider roll was ok, and just ok.  It totally fell apart when we tried to eat the pieces, which was 5 for ($8.95), not too bad.  I would have skipped that though because it was a mess!  Not good.  The taste after trying to manage a bite, again was ok.  So I am not sure about the sushi, as that was the only roll we had.  \nThe bento was cheap and easy, and if I am craving one, I will try the take out version.  I will, however, try the sushi again, just to be sure it wasn't an \"off\" day for the suchi chef.  \nAll in all, ok.  Cute place, very clean.  Will give it another go.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

Unfortunately the quality of food was highly contradicted by the unprofessionalism on the floor.  Our waiter (who we subsequently learned was the owner) REEKED of cigarette smoke, namely because of the numerous smoking breaks we watched him take when we were looking to order.  Disgusting!  Nothing ruins the flavor of sushi more than the putrid smell of cigarette smoke.  We also noticed that the level of his service was directly correlated with his level of sobriety.  He was noticeably drinking, and his service was noticeably suffering.  But the real capper came suddenly when we heard him screaming about something in the kitchen, and then he came out on the floor and  started literally yelling at his chefs \"DON'T FUCK WITH ME!\" in the middle of the floor.   It was unbelievable!  An owner trying to provoke his chefs into a fight in the middle of the restaurant?!  Just when you think you've seen it all, right?   I thought I was going to witness his beheading, but the chefs are apparently used to this, as they just ignored his drunken rant until he finally went outside to smoke (again).   It was so embarrassing and childish that the whole restaurant was snickering at him.  I almost felt sorry for him as he sulked outside with his cigarette.  \n     Talk about an uncomfortable dining experience!  I also think I was overcharged for a couple items, but at that point I simply wanted to pay and leave, and not look back!  Kudos to the chefs for their professionalism and restraint in the face of drunken idiocy.  I wonder if they kicked the shit out of him at the end of the night.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to ask  them in person as I will definitely not be going back!  I hope they did though!", "author": "Gofah K."}

We even got to meet the owner who was warm and welcoming, drank with his guests but wasn't overbearing and didn't make you feel uncomfortable. The Sushi Chef was funny and nice. Very generous with his portions and really tried to create a fun atmosphere. \nFish Quality:  I had Aji, Wallu, Mackeral and seared Halibut. All of them were tasty and fresh - however I was a bit disappointed with the garnish and wasabi on each. I know I know, it's common for some places to use wasabi but I just like my fish on rice with nothing on it. \nRolls: They let you modify and create your own rolls!!! - Too cool. I had a Lava roll (Tempura shrimp with cucumbers, avocado and green onions), but subbed out half the Tuna (on top) for Hamachi - sooo tasty.\nMy only gripes are with the Spicy Tuna Handroll and the Hawaiian roll - too much mayo. Again, I like to taste my fish. \nEntrees: We had the Black Cod - holy crap. so. fuckin. good.\nExecution: Very skillful chef. \nThe prices were a little on the high end, but the portions are generous. \n\nEverything, despite the mayo snafus, was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-22", "description": "Irashyaimase. That's what you'll hear when you walk through the door of Hayes Valley's newest premier sushi/izakaya-inspired restaurant O-Toro, and to self-professed sushi connoisseurs, such as myself, that simple Japanese welcome can be music to our ears because it marks Chef Maki's conscientious gastronomic allusion to the culinary traditions of the motherland. The slither of the restaurant, with seating for only approximately 30 very lucky guests, embodies the spirit of contemporary Japan: striking balance between respect for established form and tradition while simultaneously extending open arms to contemporary cosmopolitanism.  The food at O-Toro is elegantly understated, remaining faithful to Japan's espousal of formal replication of the tried and true by using the freshest ingredients chosen at their seasonal peak and executed in a meticulous fashion, while adding subtle complexity to old favorites with the use of more unique ingredient pairings such as the delicate unfolding of flavors of their Hip Hop Roll - (warm shrimp tempura, avocado, followed by their signature garlic white tuna, scallion shavings and a punch of a crisp garlic chip for a powerful finish) or their Golden State Roll where Chef Maki forgoes the use of lemon juice and instead  tops his salmon with wafer-thin slices of fresh lemon fruit. Even the drink menu shares the love of old and new; the extensive list of Japanese sake, with the option to wet your lips on a flight of the day's tasting selections, is juxtaposed with new, hip lychee-sake cocktails and cucumber martinis perfect for the trendy restlessness of San Francisco's fashionable intelligence.  However, even as you are enjoying the very best of the Japanese's older traditions, like the lightly tossed ginger-dressed green salad or their satisfying Spicy Scallop Nigiri, the staff at O-Toro has made it a point to forsake some of the older stereotypes that accompany Japan's most infamous sushi spots. Unlike the traditional bullying mechanisms used by Japan's top chefs who promise to deliver top notch service only to those deserving of the honor (namely, those customers who are able to select their menu properly by researching and selecting freshest fish that is not only appropriate for the season, but also happens to have been the week's best catch in Tokyo's fish market.  Additionally, sushi selection should be ordered to allow the pallet to building upon itself over the course of the meal), Chef Maki and his staff have created a friendly and intimate space where sushi savants and neophytes can both share in what is sure to be San Francisco's new talk of the town. I believe that during the course of my meal, the patron sitting next to me actually smiled and gave me a big thumbs-up as slurped down his very large oysters on the half shell. It may have just been the excitement of opening night, but certainly, it is the camaraderie amongst fellow sushi lovers, along with the ability to taste fresh selections of the rare bluefin tuna, for which the restaurant is named (the same fish that made headlines by claiming six-figure prices at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish auction), that has started rumors that the sushi chefs from some of the Marina's hot sushi spots are actually traveling downtown to O-Toro on their days off.", "author": "Smartwater o."}

While it is seemingly new, it had the familiar feel of your go-to neighborhood sushi joint - you know, the place you keep going back to even though sometimes it gets too crowded, makes you wait, or runs out of your favorite fish.  You're willing to roll with the punches, because the owner (Jimmy) and the waitress (Eun-ji) feel like pals that are giving you their best.  The crowd was intimate, friendly, and energetic - sharing in and contributing to the neighborly vibe.  The food was delicious - sushi was fresh, rolls creative, cooked dishes flavorful.  Sake was free-flowing, affordable, and of appropriate quality for the menu.  We will be making it our go-to neighborhood sushi joint...even though it's a 30-minute drive away!", "author": "Young C."}

Wait staff was very attentive and the owner, Jimmy, has a great sense of humor.  Besides the service, the menu offers a wide range of rolls/sashimi as well as cooked foods.  The Signature Otoro roll, Poki, and the Ramen are a few of my favorites.  What makes this restaurant so great is not just the extensive menu or the awesome service, but also the price.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  Let's be real, good japanese food can cost a pretty penny (I'm not talking about the cheap sushi joints that specialize in teriyaki chicken), but Otoro Sushi is very reasonably priced with high quality foods.  It definately made my short list of favorite restaurants!  =)", "author": "Elaine L."}
