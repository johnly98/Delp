One large section of the wall is devoted to little print media items like greeting cards, notebooks, calendars, and pins. All are made in limited batches by what appears to be solo artists, and many were handmade. The only drawback here was that there didn't seem to be much SF artist representation, the prices were a little more extreme than other places like stores in Japantown or Serendipity, and the selection wasn't enormous. \n\nFayes also seems to be known for its video section. To round it out, there was also a barista on duty running a mini coffee shop. While we didn't get anything other than a cup of water, the attendant was super friendly and was chatting up other customers about their drinks and the movies available in the back of the store. \n\nI might come back to check out the movies or to grab a cup of coffee, but I think next time I might look for places with larger selections like Serendipity or the card store on the first floor of Japantown's westernmost shopping center building.", "author": "John B."}

Great find in the Mission/Castro area! \nI originally walked to Tartine Bakery but as usual, the line was too long for me to wait for a pastry. Worth the wait if you REALLY want good pastries though! When I walked back on 18th street/west towards Dolores Park, I noticed Fayes Coffee and Faye's Video store about 50 feet away from Tartines. I have walked by this place many times before but wanted a 'bite' to eat this late morning.\nI quickly \"Yelped\" Fay's Coffee Shop and noticed very high ratings so went to check it out. Faye's Coffee shop has a nice old-nostalgic SF 'feel' inside and was quiet when I went (10:50am on a Monday). The Barista was very nice and helpful. I tried the cold-brew coffee $3.25 1 size only/16 once aka large. It was smooth and unlike other Cafes, he completely filled the cup even though I requested \"lite ice\". They had a decent selection of pastries i.e. your typical croissant, scones, etc. but had mini-fruit pies and savory ones i.e. quiche & chicken pie and I opted to try the Chicken Pie. He said it was from a local SF shop from the Inner Sunset area (Peasant Pies??) It was very good! As you can see from my picture, it was fresh, crust was buttery flaky and full of meat inside! It was light on the vegis' but was included. There was the right amount of onions and the pie wasn't wet/oozing with liquid when I ate it (prefer in min-pies) but was not dry whatsoever!\nThey DO HAVE Stevia sugar and all other condiments for your coffee/tea including Almond, soy milk and usual non/low/regular Milk.\nI highly recommend Faye's Coffee Shop and look forward to coming back soon!", "author": "Steve F."}

Video rental specials run through the weekdays, which include $2 Mondays and 2-for-1 Wednesdays.  \n\nIn an age where Netflix, Hulu, and Redbox dominates the movie rental business, seeing a place like Faye's in the neighborhood makes me smile. I love seeing tangible, physical copies of DVDs, similar to opening a hardcover book versus reading a novel off a Kindle. If you have a tough time deciding on a title like I do, new releases are reviewed by the staff to help with the selection process.\n\nOn to the coffee. I love that they offer an 8 oz. drip coffee for $1. Sometimes, you only want a small serving size. If you're looking for single origin beans, look elsewhere. Faye's coffee blend is a dark roast for a bigger, robust flavor. They also offer a cold brew as well as cold brew concentrate that comes in a mason jar to go. No need to stuff another stamp card in your wallet that's already busting at the seams. Use the shop's old school library-style card catalog to store your loyalty card for safe keeping. \n\nThe rest of the shop is filled with cool knick-knack art pieces and ceramics.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

I went up and asked about signing up.  He assisted me with absolutely zero expression on his face, but was polite.  Given the unique organization scheme, I asked for assistance finding the three titles I wanted to rent.  He assisted me grudgingly, seeming to be annoyed at being forced to leave the counter.  He rang up my movies, took my money, and I was on my way...\n\nLater that night, I excitedly sat down to watch my movie marathon.  The first one was awesome, so was the second.  About halfway through the third, the dvd started freezing, and try as I might, I could not unfreeze it.  I managed to turn off the movie, then start it a little while later in the movie...which left me missing about 20 minutes of some of the most important bits of the plot.\n\nWell, that sucks, but it's not the end of the world.  I'll just see if I can find out what happened by reading the wikipedia page for the movie.\n\nIt turns out the sucky part happened the next day when I returned the movie.  I let the counter guy (same one as yesterday) know that the movie froze in the middle, so was probably damaged, and that it wasn't my player's fault, because the other movies had worked just fine (and I've never had a problem before or since with it!).  He said, \"Okay, cool, thanks for letting me know.\" \n\nI waited a moment, perplexed, wondering if he'd somehow forgotten to offer to refund my money for that rental which I didn't really get to enjoy.  He never made that offer.  In retrospect, I should've made it clear that I wanted my money back...but he'd already moved onto a conversation with someone he knew in the store.  So I just left, feeling awkward and annoyed.  I haven't been back since, and the next time I had the urge to rent a video, I went to Lost Weekend instead.  \n\nIt kind of sucks that I feel this animosity towards Faye's, but customer service makes or breaks an experience for me.  If the counter guy had just refunded my money, or at least offered me another rental free for my troubles, I would've continued to give them my business, because that would've been an ethical business practice.

Ginseng and lemon, don't think I've ever had that combo before...

So, in defense of the skinny jean wearing (what did that rude guy call them, whipsters?) whatevers, the staff is actually really cool.

The last life in the universe was mine when I rented it. The history of violence I learned from this store. Everything was illuminated when at last I pulled back the painted veil (and saw who painted it) and saw what happened to Kerouac and who killed the electric car and more. The store - and the unique, lovely characters that run it  - has got obscure things and all, even though the store's small and if it don't have it, they'll order it for ya, like when I wanted to see the life of emile zola. Saw golden lotus then hot fuzz. Saw the departed after all the buzz. I saw poor rich Marie Antoinette bereft of her passion but from lovers and parties who hadn't a ration of food for the poor, and here we are we're at the same point once more, such an imbalance between wealth and poverty, I saw how they manufacture consent a documentary bout Chomsky, whose life and his work have such ubiquity, its not hard to apply his theories to the fog of war or how Murdoch outfoxed us all, Enron's rise and fall. By god this is getting insane, might as well try your luck like the man who was the only one to survive from a plane \"intacto\", he lived, he went on to play Russian roulette in the desert in some club - and when it mattered most when the bullets were flying, he lived but for love. He had something to live for and for that he survived, like the Korean flick Old Boy, a guy 16 years in prison deprived. All else died, which may not be so bad in its quicker manner like a suicide club, that weird Japanese film. Take Jean Luc Goddard. Death is slow, love kills. It is as slow as one is breathless, you can't breathe while you are one the lamb and nor could he, he just ran out of breath when the cruel and uncaring journalist lent him to those who would do him in, for she was bereft of feeling and he ran out of stamina. It was sad, but much worse would occur with Goddard: much worse, damn it. Contempt. When takes no care of his woman and she falls out of love and then goes, like what Jimmy Stewart looking out of Hitchcock's rear window. In these flicks some woman always go under, like the spartans in that movie 300. That shit was cool; if I could think of a way to go, it'd be fighting ghouls.

I would just watch Moulin Rouge and Big Lebowski again if I did. I mainly go here for the coffee, but the best thing about Faye's is and always has been through two sets of owners- the guys that own and run it and their fabulous smart service-oriented staff. They are all just genuinely nice people. I've been going here since they were Faye's Groceries (before Bi-Rite, directly across from them had become trendy Bi-Rite, back when it was no-competition-at-all skank frozen food yukky store). Back  then Scott and Cliff owned Faye's. I had just moved into the neighborhood and they always made me feel welcomed in their store. When they left they sold it to two of their employees Matt and Mike who are also good people, smart fellows who will get your smartypants art history jokes, let you know their real opinion about a film pick while getting your espresso made and grabbing your dvd off the shelf.\n\nI go there most mornings for my coffee which generally means I'm not awake and I feel a little vulnerable. Sometimes maybe alot- if I broke up with someone or something awful has happened the crying's still on my face, even if nothing happened my idonwanna morningface is on my face. No matter- They are ALWAYS good to squinka, polite about boyfriend changes, noting, but no judging. \n\nThrough all my time in this neighborhood, Faye's owners and all their employees have been and continue to be the best balance of efficient and nice, friendly and not-too-in-yo-bidness that I've seen. If you insist on waiting in line at the enemy-of-timeliness across the street known as Tartine or if you give up on the line there- cross the street and at least get your coffee at Faye's. Their employees won't ignore you and talk to each other or look right through you while they're contemplating nothingness; they'll actually make your coffee and then take your money and give you your change. WOW. It's good to know that still happens somewhere, huh?\n\nSo why such a long review? Well I'm a chatty girl. And I'm thinking of moving in the summer, still in the city, but to another neighborhood. And I realized I had pangs of sadness. followed by fear. and then terror. WHERE will I get my coffee? Who will be smart enough to know that boyfriend #2 is not quite ready to hear you say anything that even infers there was boyfriend #1 and still not be surprised when they both come in and get along? Who will let me pretend that I am the voice of the ceramic racoon on the shelf and giggle at my raconteur-ship?
