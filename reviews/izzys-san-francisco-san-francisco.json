The interior is the same as it was over a decade ago, the service was swift, attentive and the server was knowledgeable. \n\nThe food is not exactly like it used to be but it was still very good. \n\nMy friend ordered the shrimp cocktail which she thoroughly enjoyed, she said the cocktail sauce tasted homemade. She also had the prime rib, ordered it medium, it came with a baked potato and a baked sweet potato but sadly no jus or any type of sauce. I had a bite of it and it was flavorful but could definitely use a pan gravy of some sort. \n\nWe shared the cold appetizer of asparagus spears and a mustard sauce. It wasn't quite as flavorful as it could be but we still enjoyed it after we added a pinch of salt and pepper. \n\nI had the filet mignon medallions Au Poivre which came with carrots sauteed with onions and butter and a baked potato. The Au Poivre sauce was very flavorful and I enjoyed the salty, creamy brandy flavor. My meat was cooked medium and was tasty. \n\nI think this is a good steakhouse for a nice quiet dinner with friends. When we packed up some items to go the person bussing the tables helped as well and it was swift and friendly. I will definitely be back, I look forward to it.", "author": "Kelly T."}

Whenever you dine alone it is difficult to get good customer service, so I didn't have high expectations, and had a lot of time on my hands, so the slow service didn't bother me.  The wine pours are large, and reasonably priced by the glass.  I ended up with a Caesar salad topped with skirt steak, the steak was so tender, and had a wonderful marinate, it was worth the price, yet, the Caesar dressing was more like mayonnaise, and flavorless.  I think we might try the dinner when in town, it is definitely a carnivore experience.", "author": "Denise K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "I am very picky about my steak. Which is why it was tough whether to give \"Izzy's Steaks & Chops\" a 3 or 4 star rating. This place is more of a 3.5 stars in my book but still a very decent quality from my most recent experience. Therefore, if you're looking for a no-frills, non-romantic steakhouse that has a bar-like feel to it, then Izzy's is the place for you.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Cow Hollow neighborhood in the Marina District of San Francisco, Izzy's is located directly on Steiner St. (in between Chestnut & Lombard St's). This is a very busy area and finding parking can be virtually impossible during all hours of the day. Therefore, I highly recommend taking Muni, Uber/Lyft, or a taxi. However, since my lady and I came from out of town, we ended up driving and luckily found a parking spot near Moscone Park (about a 10-minute walk).\n\nSince we made reservations (through the Yelp app), we were greeted and seated immediately. As I mentioned earlier, this place has a true bar/saloon feel to it especially with the heavy use of dark wooden trim throughout. You will find a lot of vintage artwork that shows pictures of noticeable people from San Francisco's past. The seating area is, however very tight as my chair was very close to the people sitting next to me. \n\nWe took full advantage of the Living Social deal that they were offering. This was a three-course Prix Fixe dinner for 2 that included an appetizer, two main courses w/two sides each, and one dessert. We both decided on \"Chopped Caesar Salad\" as our appetizer with choice. This also included complimentary bread and butter. I ended up ordering their \"Blackened Filet\" (cooked at medium) complete with \"Izzy's Own Potatoes\" and \"Creamed Spinach\". I also settled with a cold IPA that was recommended by our server.\n\nSpeaking of our server, he was a fun, energetic mature guy! Definitely working at a fast pace especially helping multiple parties at once. The busboy also came by very frequently to make sure our glasses of water were filled to the top. My beer and her Zinfandel wine arrives within a couple minutes. The salad did take about 15 minutes but do keep in mind, this was right around 7:00pm on a Saturday evening so the delay is to be expected during peak hours. Both our main entrees took another 15-20 minutes but everything is presented very nicely.\n\nAs far as the steak itself, it was above average and of decent quality. It was cooked perfectly and had a nice sear to it. And this particular cut of meat was packed with flavor with a hint of spiciness to it. The potatoes were more of an Au Gratin-type but still fairly decent. However, I absolutely loved the creamed spinach; this was definitely Izzy's specialty. Which is why the food itself was about a 4.5 stars. We also got a dessert with this deal; we opted with their \"New York Cheesecake\". It was just okay and nothing special. \n\nThe main reason why I am not giving this place a perfect rating is due to the value. Had it not been for the Living Social deal, my entree & sides (without an appetizer & drinks) would've cost me around $40 + tax. A little steep for steak, potatoes, and spinach! But this is San Francisco so the higher prices are to be expected. Overall, this is a decent steakhouse and you definitely will get filled up if you finish your whole plate.", "author": "Donovan H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-03", "description": "Decent steak house, if you find yourself in the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood, but certainly not worth a special trip, even from just across town. We are in walking distance, so we find ourselves here on occasions, when other more desirable restaurants are booked on a busy Saturday evening.\n\nFood - We really enjoyed the warm goat  cheese salad, which was perfectly dressed in a light citrus dressing. This was really good, with fresh slices of crisp apples.  Generous portions, especially the 14oz prime rib, which was cooked to perfection. The meats themselves, including the prime rib and steaks are of mediocre quality. Much better, of course, than you'd find at a low-end steakhouse, but not up to par with those you'd expect at Peter Luger's or even the House of Prime Rib.\n\nThe sides (creamed spinach, & Izzy's potatoes), though voluminous in portion  size, were both extremely salty. So much so, in fact, that I left both barely touched. Very disappointing, since, at least for me, the sides of a steak dinner are just as delectable to me as the main entree.\n\nWe had the cheesecake for dessert. Nothing to write home about here, as you might find yourself doing after a slice from the now defunct Carnegie's Deli. However, it was nicely presented, and hit the sweet spot.\n\nService: The front door host/hostess seemed disorganized and in disarray, but the wait service we received from Steve was fabulous. The restaurant was at its peak tonight, on Saturday, but Steve was efficiently working the floor. He came frequently and quickly for iced tea/water refills. Nice guy and definitely hard worker!\n\nFar from a home run here, but it'll bring you to first or second base, which is sometimes all you need, when you want to satiate your red meat hankerings.", "author": "Lori N."}

Our appetizer came at the same time as our main course. The roasted mussels were very good and flavorful, but the prime rib was tougher and saltier than I had expected. The potatoes weren't bad, but the spinach was super weird. I tasted tea in it... the server said it was nutmeg. We had to ask for water refills cause no one could see us. \n\nAfter we finished our food, the dessert took forever to come too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "Let me preface this review by saying that Izzy's is a Bay Area steak institution. Over the years, I've enjoyed a number of dining experiences at their Marina and former Marin County locations.\n\nThat is why it pains me to write this negative review of my most recent Izzy's meal. A few friends and I came here last Friday night for dinner. The restaurant's bar and interior hasn't changed in all these years, and that's perfectly fine with me. Unfortunately, our party of three was squeezed into a very uncomfortable table that was literally backed up against a wall and two other adjacent tables. You couldn't move your chair or legs without bumping into something. It was the equivalent of sitting in coach class on an airplane.\n\nOur waiter (who shall remain nameless) was clearly a veteran in the service industry. While knowledgable and efficient, he was a bit overly sassy (bordering on surly). Instead of making us feel welcome, we got the impression that he just wanted to quickly take our order (before we even had a chance to peruse the menu) and then turn the table. \n\nAfter ordering a round of drinks, we put in our order. I wound up getting the 8 oz. Prime Rib (medium rare) which comes with your choice of two sides. I decided on the Izzy's potatoes (which are like a potato gratin) and the carrots & onions. What wound up arriving at the table 20 minutes later was perhaps 4 oz. of medium-cooked prime rib and 4 oz. of fat, paired with undercooked mashed potatoes (with no gratin), and giant, boiled carrot pieces that would choke even the hungriest of rabbits. This dish had zero flavor or au jus. Thank God for the horseradish sauce (which I had to remind our server to bring), because that at least make the meat somewhat edible. \n\nLong story short, this entire meal with 2 well cocktails + tip cost me over $75. And I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever had a prime rib dinner and gone home hungry. For the same price, I could've enjoyed a much better meal at the House of Prime Rib with salad, bread, Yorkshire pudding, baked potato, cream of spinach, and friendlier service.\n\nIzzy's - I know that you're better than this. Like I said earlier, you're an SF institution. But with that kind of reputation, you should do better at delivering a finer dining experience (especially for the price), because there's a lot of meaty competition in town. As much as I hate to say it, I could've had a comparable carnivore dinner at Outback Steakhouse or Applebee's for the same price.\n\nHere's hoping things improve.", "author": "Kevin B."}

They took it back and brought me a medium well to well done filet.  It wasn't horrible, but a steakhouse should be better at getting the steak done right.  Typically if the steak isn't done right the first time, the waiter has you check the second steak to make sure it is right...not mine.  I just decided to eat it like it was because I was hungry at this point.  My wife's New York Strip was pretty chewy as well.  I also ordered the key lime pie, and that was actually pretty good.\nAnyway, I wanted a \"slightly\" cheaper steak dinner, and it didn't work out so well for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-02", "description": "Came here for dinner because we had a Living Social coupon for a pre-fix meal. This place is really out in the middle of nowhere so it's a little tricky to find. When we got there, the hostess was nowhere to be seen. After waiting around awkwardly for 5-10 minutes, the hostess finally came back to seat us. The pre-fix meal allowed us 1 shared appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 shared dessert. We ended up deciding on the calamari (0/5), the filet mignon (4/5), the rib eye (5/5), and the NY cheesecake (4/5). \n\nThe calamari was a disaster. I eat almost any calamari but this one was pretty damn terrible. The batter fell off as we tried to pick the pieces up with a fork. The squid itself was super fishy and chewy. We ended up only eating a couple bites of this and putting it off to the side for the rest of the meal. The entrees though, were cooked perfectly. I got my filet medium rare and it was perfect. Even the rare ribeye was cooked perfectly rare. I will say that I did't quite enjoy the amount of pepper they crusted the filet with. I'm normally a big fan of pepper but this was just way too much. I couldn't even taste the meat. Their sides were nothing to really write home about, just your typical potatoes or veggies. As for dessert, the cheesecake was what I expected of a NY cheesecake. It was dense and rich, but nothing too special about it. \n\nAll in all, I would probably only come back here if I had another coupon because without it, the meal we had would have come out to around $210 without tip and I definitely don't think it was worth that much. In the end, with the coupon, we paid $40 which I will admit, was definitely a steal for 2 steak dinners. \n\nPros:\n- Waitress was super welcoming and explained everything about the pre-fix meal\n- Easy to make reservation\n- Meats were cooked to the right temperature\n- Portions are quite large\n\nCons:\n- Interactions with hostess and other waiters were a bit awkward, it almost seemed like they wanted to avoid all human contact\n- Interior or restaurant is a bit dated and could def use a revamp\n- Skip the seafood as it wasn't very fresh (stick to meat at a steakhouse)", "author": "Diana C."}

Friendly wait staff,Izzy's a family friendly pub the food is delicious, great drinks selection. I recommend the filet mignon with Izzy's potatoes and creamed spinach, OMG was it delicious and make sure you save some room for the best slice of cheesecake I've found in the city by far. They serve the cheesecake with a strawberry sauce,that is just tart enough to balance the sweetness of the cheesecake. Izzy's is our new go to spot for a quick delicious dinner. The decor inside is filled with pictures and banners with quotes from the owner and some background on how Izzy's came to be.", "author": "Lulu R."}

I made reservations for SF Restaurant Week and we arrived at said time. Guy at the front told us to wait since they had no tables available. No tables available and I made reservations? Ok, that's a bit unprofessional but I'll just wait since I'm already here *eye rolls*. No offering of a refreshment for making us wait after we made reservations.\n\nFast forwarding to our actual dinner. Me and my boyfriend ordered the prime rib medium well. That shit was burnt. I immediately tasted the charcoal as I took a bite out of the meat. I couldn't stand to eat the rest of it and just picked at the sides. Needless to say, a bum we passed by on the way to the car happily took our prime rib and had no problem eating a burnt dinner. For $100 on dinner I was definitely not expecting this.

I normally order the larger cut of the prime rib, to me it's just an appetizer. This trip I was able to get a groupon discount for my meal. Started with calamari, very good but not enough tentacles and the deep frying was a little over cooked, the calamari was a bit crunchy. They have real horseradish, not the creamed stuff you normally get with prime rib. Then the good stuff, the prime rib medium rare. The sides I ordered was their Izzys's potatoes and the creamed spinach. Due to health conscious patrons, the potatoes that were wonderfully oily and cheesy has been reduced to no better than boiled potatoes, very bland and unappealing, I come not for health foods but to indulge, potato's ruined by health concious patrons.  Also the creamed spinach was a little on the salty side.\nDessert was key lime pie, since I'm not big on desserts, I guess it was good. It's too bad health concerns has messed up what was an indulgence.\nStill a great place but don't change a good thing", "author": "Raymond L."}

We capped off our meal with a shared chocolate mousse cake which was so rich and decadent.\n\nWhat topped it off was our server Samuel.  He was extremely attentive as was the rest of the waitstaff.

So we needed to have STEAK for dinner\n2) we had a special bottle of wine with us (chuckle as I write this because this bottle of wine was not from our wine tasting rather, it took a ride with us on our road trip and rather than to take it home we decided to enjoy it with our protein) and given permission with a corkage fee, we took advantage of it and enjoyed it with our dinner\n3) Izzy's location was in good proximity to my other friend's home (Marina district)\n4) Izzy's is an icon over 30 years for being on of the places the \"locals\" enjoy and my favorite thought when visiting other cities is I like to go where the \"locals\" go\n\nMy buddy and I split the bone in rib eye and sad to say my buddy got the overdone part of  the sharing. My steak was perfect to the medium rare. I had a baked potato and steamed vegetable as my sides. I tasted the creamed spinach and scallop potato sides ordered by my buddy and it was tasty. \n\nTo finish off our evening and meal, we shared in their creme brulee dessert which was good. The crust was firm and crunchy and the brulee was creamy.\n\nI thought the corkage was a bit much; especially since they didn't have the wine we brought on their wine list but, it is their policy so that's that.\n\nBest part was we shared a decent meal with decent wine and great fellowship, not to mention great service. A definite icing on the cake to end a great day\n\n(ps- Parking is absolutely insane now here again, it's the Marina District off Lombard in the great city of San Francisco... so I look beyond the humbug of the parking situation\n\nA definite repeat for me in my book!", "author": "Terry K."}

I would definitely return but never asking anyone to take a picture-clearly... unless we get a vibe from someone nice that cares how the picture comes out lol.", "author": "Ms. Lala B."}

We split the warm goat cheese salad as our appetizer, and it was so fresh and delectable.  I got the New York steak au poivre and Mr B got the marinated skirt steak.  Marinade on the skirt steak wasn't Mr B's favorite, so more steak for me!  We always get Izzy's potatoes (scalloped potatoes) and creamed spinach, as those are Izzy's specialties and are the BEST.  For dessert we split the cr\u00e8me brulee, and it was a nice finish.  \n\nService was really good, as there was a lot of staff working a weekday night.

We decided to grab a quick dinner here since there were openings.  \n\nFor ambiance, you gotta love that old school vibe and music.  The second floor and fireplace emanate a cozy cabin-like feel.  And all the condiments lined up throughout the restaurant are not only a convenience, but also adds to the interior design.  Customer service for us was top notch...attentive and very friendly. \n \nFor SFRW, we were happy to hear that the offer included two sides instead of the one stated in the menu.  The creamed spinach was just okay, and broccoli ...is broccoli.  Clams were delish and the sauce also went well with their comp sourdough bread.  We added Irish nachos as an appetizer, which were not on the menu.  Kudos to them for custom making our fries loaded with bacon and melted cheese.  Other apps like the fried oysters and calamari were pretty average.  \nFor the main course, we all had their blackened prime rib.  We all agreed that our blackened meats were over-seasoned. There was no need for any of the million condiments displayed.  At least mine was cooked at a perfect medium rare.  But another prime rib on the table was sent back to the kitchen. And corrected. \nFor dessert, the special Bostini was quite tasty and refreshing.  But the cheesecake was the  star of the night.  I could not get enough of this very light and fluffy cake drizzled with strawberry sauce.  And I don't even like cheesecake!\n\nGreat service, Irish nachos, and dessert could influence a comeback here.  And trying their steaks would facilitate my return for sure.

For about six years in a row I booked a December dinner there for eight buddies and me to celebrate the end of the year. We'd meet for cocktails beforehand, have a drink at Izzy's bar, and then neck a few bottles of Pinot with some mezcal chasing it. \n\nSo it was a new experience to taste the food sober. I think their game is slipping. \n\nA couple of tips:\n\nThe \"New York Sirloin\" is a sirloin cut in the shape of a New York. On the dry side. That's probably why they offer it au poivre, the sauce can help mask that.\nThe doneness usually comes in a little hot; a medium-rare request shows up on the medium side, for example.\nThe baked potatoes are cold, at least around 8pm. I imagine they roast them all before service and try to keep them warm through the night. Unsuccessfully. \nTheir signature creamed spinach was oversalted, at least on Thursday 2/23/2017. We didn't take it home. \nThe marinated skirt steak was done in teriyaki, which they offer in two other entrees. My companion had it and liked it, but I could do something more interesting at home, and a skirt doesn't need a lot extra flavor in my opinion. \n\nThe waiters are consistently warm, polished, and affable.The busboys, less so. I think your best shot is the bone-in ribeye (ordered rare) or Prime Rib, with the Izzy's potatoes and avoid the baked spud and creamed spinach, even though it is their signature dish.

Considering the amount of great food in San Francisco, I really wonder why someone would spend such a good amount of money for a sub par steak in a place like this.  The place looks very dated and straight out of a restaurant from the 90's.  The place looks very old and vintage inside and although the tables and arrangements look nice, it just feels like a restaurant out of a horror movie.\n\nThe service here was decent, nothing you wouldn't get at a place like the keg, but considering the premium I was paying I expected a little more.  We had to constantly wave down our server to get us drinks and other things we would normally be served.  \n\nI came here with co-workers for dinner on a Friday evening before leaving San Francisco.  I'm kind of sad I had to eat this before leaving such a great city.  I ordered a steak, a side of grilled mushrooms and a cheesecake.  The steak was overcooked as I asked for medium rare and it was closer to well done.  The mushrooms tasted like they were straight out of a can and the cheesecake wasn't anything special.  Something you can buy at Safeway would have tasted the same.\n\nConsidering I spent over $80 with drinks as well, I felt the food was not worth the price of admission.  I did get a lot of food that I ended up taking home, but to be honest it was so mediocre, I ended up throwing most of it out.  I would probably not come back here when im in the SF area.", "author": "Mike H."}

My grandparents introduced me to this awesome steakhouse, and now 4 generations later, we still go many times. They also deliver or you can pick up. The skirt steak with either creamed spinach/carrots and onions and Izzy's own potatoes is the best steak. The marinade on that steak is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It is not really kid friendly-- they do have a burger, but it's adult sized, even then, large for adults. The skirt steak and 2 sides of your choice taste exactly the same each time, making for the most incredible consistency. You know what to expect, makes it so easy. The ambiance is awesome. Every sauce desired is lined up behind the tables so you can use Siracha or A1, whatever condiment might be needed. I would skip an appetizer or starter, but the calamari is delicious if so chosen, as well as the caesar salad. Desert is lackluster, but the Creme Brulee is amazing. So creamy, and a nice subtle vanilla flavor. Yummmm. This is also a fun space in the Marina area for a drink with friends after work, as they have sports games on at the bar televisions. It's a San Francisco institution, a standard. Come here and you will not be sorry. Enjoy the leftovers for lunch the next day, as it's a lot of food.

Izzy's is one of our favorite places to eat in San Francisco.  The portions are large and delicious.

We absolutely find the mussels are real treat!  If you don't like chili pepper ask for them without it. The sourdough was so San Franciscan and fresh. Wine is a little pricey, but it's a large serving. However, corkage is the same as 2 glasses of wine so if you'd prefer your own wine then you may want to consider that. It's a noisy setting like the saloon days and we enjoy it as everyone including us were talking loudly, but no one seems to care and it makes it more fun.  So, good food and good fun!

Our server was very sweet and nice, I'm not sure what her name was but she was great. The food was good I've been here and the Oakland location plenty of times so I knew what we both liked. We got there a little early so we left and came back. But after we ate our appetizers we were sitting down enjoying our wine while talking with each other. This is when I noticed an older man named \"Ralph\" hovering over our booth. I noticed him in the mirror over 30 times! No exaggeration. I finally called him out and asked him if he needed something or if he had a problem with us being there. I told him he has looked at us and not said a word, not once. I told him he was making me feel uncomfortable and frustrated.He never once said a word to us. Just kept looking at our booth like he wanted us to leave. I mean he took our waters away when we were still drinking them. Took our napkins and kept coming back. Not saying anything.  Keep in mind he was not our server. I have never felt so racially profiled by someone who had nothing to do with my table. I recently bought a Groupon to use to go back there, but I am now trying to find a way to get a refund on it. I am completely appalled by the way he looked at me and my girlfriend and extremely bothered by the fact he came to our booth to try and have us leave when the restaurant was not even busy. I hope his management sees this review because he made myself and my girlfriend very uneasy. I can't believe the garbage looks he was giving us and feeling of being rushed to leave. He needs to get a life. And I am definitely going to make sure his boss and his bosses boss hears about his behavior.", "author": "Randall Z."}

I've been wanting to try Izzy's for awhile, always heard nothing but good things from people.  First off, they lost my reservation. Something in my gut told me something was off when I called to make reservations and the hostess didn't even take down my phone number or name...interesting. Despite losing my reservation, we were seated right away. I appreciate when the customer/consumer is not punished for the mistake of the establishment. \n\nI ordered a shirley temple - tasted just like it was supposed to :)\n\nBeau had the fillet mignon medallions which he really loved. The creamy sauce over the medallions were great and the steak was cooked perfect. Not necessarily steak house type meal, but it was good.\n\nI had the prime rib, which was good. But let's do a comparison with House of Prime Rib shall we?\n\nIzzy Steak: prime rib is plated for you in the kitchen, and brought to your table.\nHOPR: prime rib is cut in front of you with a cart\n\nIzzy: prime rib has globulars of fat intact in the steak\nHOPR: chef cuts out the massive globulars of fat prior to putting it on your plate, while at the same time retaining a good portion of fat/meat. \n\nIzzy: good flavor but lacking something\nHOPR: you can taste the cow! \n\nIzzy: creamed spinach, delicious, good salt content and was \"chunky\" in comparison to...\nHOPR: creamy spinach. Consistency was perfect with each bite. \n\nI have to admit the one thing that Izzy had going for it was the scalloped potatoes! I could definitely eat those for days! They were AWESOME! Cheesy, creamy, smooth, right part of crunch in them. Noms for days.\n\nLastly, within 20 minutes of the meal my stomach churned. I think Izzy's food might be more greasy that I may be used to (and I am not a health nut by any means, I love my share of hamburgers, french fries, egg rolls, cheese, etc). I had to use the walgreens down the block :( For that reason not sure if I would return.\n\nI definitely prefer HOPR more. I understand that Izzy has more options, but there's just something about HOPR that i'm just willing to pay a little bit more with.\n\nOh yea...during the meal, at the bar, there were these middle-aged fraternity brothers all drunk and singing.

I went out last night , Friday 11-28-16 in the rain to just have a nice relaxing dinner by myself at Izzy's. The Chicken Piccata is to die for! I have been coming here for over 20+ years and I used to live 3 doors up from the restaurant for many years. I love Eric! He is the best bartender but he is off on Friday. \n\nI walked in and the restaurant was pretty empty around 5:15PM. Sam was having dinner at the bar but closer to the door and I was at the other end of the bar. First the two Spanish bartenders were arguing about something and one of them (name on my check) Tom just told the other one \"Whatever\" and walked away. I sat there for about 3 minutes before even being asked what I would like to drink!! Mind you there were \"4\" people in the bar and the bartenders were wiping lipstick off wine glasses! Finally Tom comes over and I order my meal and my wine and declined the bread. I was polite and he had no personality at all. No \"How are you\" or any just minimal conversation! Not a \"people\" guy!! Then I was completely ignored until my food came! I ate my meal and the only female waitress, who was not even helping me, asked me how my meal was! Thank you. She was a real professional, and mature so of course she knows customer service! Dear \"Tom: NEVER asked me how my meal was or if I needed anything else. I had to ask HIM for ground pepper saying please and thank you!!\n\nWhen my meal was finished I was just relaxing and drinking my wine. I was having 3 people who were to meet me there after they got off work and we were going to just have drinks. The very minute he took my plate off the bar he did ask if I wanted desert (SHOCK) and I declined nicely with \"No thank you\". He then brought me my check!!!! I did NOT put  my credit card on the bar!!! YOU DON'T JUST ASSUME SOMEONE IS LEAVING!!! I ask for the check when I am ready and so does everyone else! So, I told him why did he close me out? So that was the straw that broke it!! I texted my friends and we met up at the Dorian where I am treated with the ultimate respect by the owners and bartenders. We had a great time and they could not even believe the way I was treated at Izzys! They also agreed that Eric is the best and the others just don't have it!! For the first time I only left a 10% tip and he is lucky he got anything at all! Tom, remember I PAY YOUR SALARY AS A CUSTOMER!! My friends all said they would have left NO tip!\n\nBoth the bartenders just kept speaking Spanish to each other loudly (which I understand and I won't even go in to what they were saying) with the kitchen staff which is unprofessional in it self. Any upscale restaurant you don't have that. Act professional around customers, speak English and have your disagreements discretely or remove it from the bar! You are in the wrong business! AND never give the check until the customer asks to be closed out!!! Really???? I am happy to come by ONLY when Eric is working or when Tom and his buddy are gone!! Sam, they need a lot of training on ethical bartending and upscale customer service! You do have an upscale restaurant and I would like it to stay that way. Thanks to those of you that know me there. The rest of you are awesome!", "author": "Yvonne J."}

The filet was nicely cooked and only needed a little salt for my taste... my mouth is watering thinking about it.\nMy boyfriend got the T-bone with broccoli and Izzy's potatoes and took half of it home.

We went here Saturday night for a milestone dinner with the family, and it was just mediocre at best. The formerly robust rib-eye is now about a 1/2-inch thick. The small dollop of creamed spinach and handful of fries that came as sides paled in comparison  to their former selves of even a year ago.

Joelle (I think that's her name since she did not even introduce herself to us so I am going off what is printed on the check) started our evening by yelling  at me while taking my order because I was not being clear enough (even though I was not even finished ordering). She managed to mess up the order twice (thankfully she came back and clarified before we got the food) and then made absolutely no effort to check on us the rest of the meal. By the looks of things the rest of her tables received the same kind of experience. The cherry on this terrible sundae of a dinner was when she took our desert order. We ordered two deserts and two teas. She messed up the desert order too (because she did not write it down) and brought us peppermint tea instead of green teas we ordered. The worst part was that one of the teapots with hot water had an old tea bag in it. When we pointed it out to her she literally said \"Well I did not put it there\". Honestly I had better service from the lunch lady at my high school cafeteria. Two stars are for the food itself. I feel zero guilt not leaving her a tip (I did tip bus boy separately) and while I understand that she was most likely was having a bad evening, the management should have sent her home rather than having her provide the service we received.

I had never had problems with Izzy's steaks in the past. \n\nThis visit was a different story. Steak was ordered medium. What I got was an over cooked chewy dried out piece of meat. It was uneven in Size ( which is extremely unusual for a filet or any steak at a steakhouse like Izzys was in the past). \n\nThe interior of the steak also did not resemble that of a filet. It looked more like the middle of a gross Applebee's steak! I told my server it was over cooked and was told, \"We never have had complaints like this before\". Right away their mistake was my fault! I was asked if I wanted another one and I was skeptical and decided to leave again. \n\nI can no longer recommend what was once my favorite steakhouse on the West Coast. The attitude last time, now both the attitude and the food!!! What's the point?? It literally makes me sad. That this was once a great place to go! Beyond great. In 1997 I drove 800 miles round trip to eat there!! \n\nI live in LA. And my companions steak was cooked too rare & she said it was just \"okay\" she had never been.

We decided to go to Izzys because in our past experience it was great steaks served with a smile.  \n\nToday it was more than just a let down. The host was not very accommodating. Let me explain: he sat us next to two patrons while the whole space in the dining quarters was mostly empty. I requested to be sat in a table more private in the corner--a small table with two chairs. He explained it was reserved for a big party. 30 minutes later the seats where filled with two guests and not a big party. This was not a big deal since we had already ordered our cowboy ribeye steaks with drinks in hand. Our food arrives, filet minions. The worst part was, it was the wrong order. He accepted fault and fixed our orders promptly. In the interim, I requested we receive comp for our drinks as the long wait had left us empty and thirsty. We received 1 drink for the both of us - for a well established institution, I am extremely disappointed. It left a bad impression and wasted a good hour+ of our time. \n\nBottom line: Best steaks I have had in a while (cooked just right, the second time around) but definitely not worth the service or wait. I might return after my tour of the other steak houses in the city; I hope their service will be better.\n\n\nEdit* Bumped to 4 stars from my previous 3 star review. I would have made it a 3.5 if i had the option because the GM was kind enough to follow-up. Honestly, Izzy is one of the better steak spots, especially for steak.

The medium rare bone in ribeye with izzys potatoes and creamed spinach is about as good as you're going to get for a steak dinner at that price point.  I've tried most of the steak preparations, and I've never been steered wrong.  \n\nIf you like your meat on the rarer side, you might want to specify what you mean by \"rare\", \"medium rare\" or \"medium\" when asked how you like your steak.  Their medium rare leans towards medium, but as long as I'm clear I get exactly what I want.\n\nIf you're looking for any of the following, I would not recommend Izzys:\n\n- Haute cuisine\n- 5 star service that's all over you every minute\n- Up to date preparations or presentations\n- Not steak and potatoes", "author": "Andrew L."}

I had the blackened (pepper-crusted) filet and my hubby had the lamb. Both were phenom. My steak was cooked PERFECTLY medium rare, great sear on the outside and super tender. His lamb was also very tender and delicious. The sauce on the lamb is really good. \n\nWe both got the creamed spinach and I got a baked potato, where he had the \"Izzy's own potatoes\". The sides were delicious! Their potatoes au gratin were very rich and tasty. I would have that over the baked potato next time. \n\nThe bread served with the meal is cold and unspectacular, but it's probably for the best as we already overate.

I sat at the bar as I was alone on business and the bartender was very attentive and took very good care of me.  I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, while the outside was very fatty, it was cooked so well that the fat melted in your mouth.  That is a very good job cooking it.  Sides were good as well so for the price, being able to get sides was a great deal.

Only criticism with the Key Lime pie is that there's too much meringue on top...honestly, I'd be happier with no meringue, it's unnecessary, and the best Key Lime pies I've ever had (in Marathon Key, FL, of course) had no meringe).  \n\nPrice:  competitive steak house prices, but not excessive like Acme or one of those clip joints.  Hearty portions for a reasonable price.  It doesn't feel inflated.\n\nWheelchair Accessibility:  when you make a reservation (which you should), let them know if you're in a chair, since this is a two-level restaurant.  I'm not sure about the restroom meeting ADA, since I've not used it at this restaurant.\n\nWhy not a 5th star?  Well, the tables for couples are so close together that I always feel like I'm sharing my intimate dinner conversation with strangers.  Since it's not meant to be a family-style place, it just feels...obtrusive and cramped.  Also, the wait staff is a bit on the brusque side.

The food was pretty decent. Had bottomless mimosa's also.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly until we put our Groupon on the table about halfway through the meal. It was like we became invisible.

Also, the restaurant on a Saturday morning wasn't packed at all.\n\nServer basically threw our check on the table and didn't even thank us for the business. We tipped 25% on orginal value of the meal although I don't know why.

Let me explain. \n\nI first came here about 2 years ago for brunch. Didn't know a whole lot about the place and tagged along with family. Much to my surprise they had bottomless Pacifico beer on draft for $8 flat! Awesome! So I had about 5 to go along with a delicious breakfast. Hang Town Fry. Eggs, bacon, oysters. The best. Can't go wrong. Highly recommended. \n\nFast forward about 6 months to when I bring my girlfriend here for brunch. I ask about the bottomless Pacifico and I am told they no longer do that. They only have bottomless Pabst Blue Ribbon. Still for $8 flat. I happen to love PBR so this is no problem whatsoever. Meanwhile, my lady orders a bottomless mimosa. Also I believe for $8. I again order the Hang Town Fry (Delicious. Always. Order this.) and my better half orders the skirt steak and eggs. No problems whatsoever with the food. No complaints ever. \n\nA few months later we are back. Food is just as amazing but now bottomless is PBR \"isn't on the menu\" according the waitress, but she'll hook it up \"this time\". Oooookay...sure. Sounds good...I guess. \n\nAnother few months later we are back again. PBR isn't on draft anymore at all :( No bottomless beer special. Only bottomless mimosa and a bucket of Rolling Rock (4 bottles I believe) for $15. Food is still amazing. \n\nWait for it...a few months later we are back. I along with my girlfriend are in the mood for bottomless mimosas. But now they don't even have that! Again, no problems with the food. \n\nI know this review is ridiculously long, but basically, if you are coming here with a thirst for adult beverages, just know that this place is not consistent. As far as the food goes, one of the best brunch places in The City.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

I have lived in the city since 90 and I'm sorry to say I have never heard of Izzy's! \n\nWhen I accepted the dinner invite I immediately started doing my homework, what's Izzy's menu like? What are they known for? It wasn't long before I learned that Izzy's is known for their quality Steaks and Chops and they include two side vegetable dishes with their entr\u00e9e's something the large chain steak houses like to charge you $5-$7 a side for! So far so good!\n\nThe \"Marinated Skirt Steak\" kept coming up in my research as a favorite. I thought how could skirt steak be better than a Rib eye which is my favorite cut of beef? I also read that the Izzy's Potatoes and Creamed Spinach were two favorite side dishes so what did I order? I took a chance and went with the recommendations, Izzy's Marinated Skirt Steak, Izzys Own Potatoes and Creamed Spinach. \n\nThe steak was very tender, cooked medium as I had asked, the sauce is thin and sweet like a Teriyaki only better, it enhanced the skirt steak, I loved it. The only negative comment I have is my steak was warm and not hot. For a restaurant like Izzy's I'd expect every entree' to be served hot. Izzy's Own Potatoes are Potatoes Au Gratin, cheese, cream and potatoes that are baked, what's not to love? Creamed Spinach was better than I had thought it would be, nicely seasoned, was that Allspice I tasted in the Spinach? I was happy with my choices for my entr\u00e9e' and side dishes. \n\nAs for Dessert, I say life is too short, have two and so I did. I am a big fan of Cr\u00e8me Brulee' and Izzy's did not disappoint. The baked sugar topping was solid but gave away with a gentle tap of my spoon, the cr\u00e8me was smooth, silky and sweet as it should be. I also ordered the Key Lime Pie, it was tart but a bit too sweet for my liking, I think the Cr\u00e8me Brulee' was the best choice.\n\nI appreciated the atmosphere at Izzy's, it has been around since 1987, there's only one other in San Carlos, CA. Izzy's is very casual and caters to the locals and tourists but if you wanted to dress up for a special night out you wouldn't feel out of place. What makes Izzy's exceptional are their well-seasoned staff from the host who greeted and seated us with a smile to the wait staff and bartender. \n\nI'm definitely a fan of Izzys.", "author": "David P."}

We haven't always had the best service but we've always loved the food which is why we've always returned. We automatically felt rushed and possibly judged as guests who didn't matter as much as others around us. And, we were never rude, I felt maybe he didn't think we were regulars or were too young or something.. Since the tables were close together, we could hear our waiters interactions with others so it was very apparent we weren't being treated the same as the table of 6 next to us. To us, he was surly. \n\nWhile my boyfriend was at the bathroom (just a minute or two after being seated), the waiter hounded me to place our drink order without him and seemed put off when i said I wanted to wait for his return. We placed our order shortly afterwards and our waiter forgot to put our salad order in. He said, he just flat out forgot. I want to add that this is the 3rd time this particular waiter has forgotten about something we have ordered. After the food arrive, which was delivered by a server, we had to track him down to place our drink order that we were intentionally trying to pair with our food. When he dropped the bill, he just dropped it face up and exposed for other guests to see, no guest check book. And, we were polite the entire time, we were even cool when he said he just forgot about our salad! We stilled tipped almost 20% but he's always received a much higher tip from us. We live and work in the wine county and know hospitality and to always treat people well and we are willing to pay good money for great food and service, guess he shouldn't have judged us and just treated us better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-02", "description": "I had an open mind about this place.  I read the Yelp reviews and hoped it was going to be a pretty good place...after all most of the reviews are 4 out of 5 starts.  But the reviews about how the meat was cooked at this place was pretty consistent, that is it's either cooked right or cooked wrong and that's what had me concerned.\n\nSo I'll start from the beginning...\n\nDinner was to be with a group of friends we have not seen in a very long time and one of our friends recommended this place since he and his wife live in SF and have dined at Izzy's regularly.  So I had two things to look forward to: spending time with friends and celebrating a birthday and going up to SF since my husband and I live in the 'burbs.\n\nIzzy's is located in the Cow Hollow neighborhood so that means lots of stores to peruse and places to eat.  There's street parking but you're better off parking in one of the garages nearby.  Here's a tip, we parked in a garage (Chestnut and Pierce, the one with multiple levels) which had meters.  Use the iPhone app for the meter to track your time.\n\nWhen my husband and I arrived at Izzy's the first thing I noticed was the bar, it's full service complete with tv's.  What was on that night? The fourth game of the World Series of course!  The place is a little dark and looks like it's been there for a long time.  I liked the atmosphere.\n\nDinner was a party of eight and we were seated upstairs where it was quiet.  Most of our friends were dressed up (button up shirt, nice blouse, or sweater with jeans, heels and loafers), my husband and I were the only ones casually dressed.  From what I read about the atmosphere and was talked about in an episode of Check, Please! Bay Area Izzy's is a casual place.  So my point is don't get dressed up unless you want to.\n\nThe food...\nThe bread provided before starters and entrees was ordinary in my opinion.  It wasn't warm (could be that they order it from some place else) and was spongy in texture.  Butter was not even in a container it was those pre-wrapped pats of butter and it was cold.  For the prices you're going to pay at this place you would think they have butter in a small ramekin.\n\nA few of us had salads.  My husband and I shared the house salad seasoned with a vinaigrette.  That was pretty good.  He ordered the rib eye medium rare with the peppercorn cream sauce served on the side. The outside was well done with a little bit of pink inside, it must have been cooked at too high of a temperature.  The rib eye wasn't seasoned...something noted in many of the negative reviews.  The hubby had to pour on sauce from the shelf...good steak shouldn't be seasoned with flavoring from a bottle.  \n\nI had a small piece of the rib eye dipped in the cream sauce.  The cream sauce didn't have too much flavor, I was disappointed.  I ordered the skirt steak medium (suggested by our server) but came out medium rare (which is better than over cooked) and was seasoned with teriyaki sauce...way too much teriyaki sauce.  The cook must have poured on the sauce thrown it on the grill then added more sauce after grilling.  Both my husband and I had the Izzy's potatoes...too greasy and no flavor.  He had the carrots with onions which were cooked to death and I had the steamed broccoli which thankfully wasn't soggy.  \n\nEveryone else had steaks for the most part all blackened.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, which makes me think maybe they don't know what good steaks taste like.  One of our friends had the burger which wasn't cooked to her liking the first time then it was cooked again and black like charcoal the second time.  It was the same burger!  She ordered cheese with her burger and Izzy's charges extra for that ($3).\n\nOur server was attentive and knew the menu well which was a good thing.  The other consistently bad comment about Izzy's is the service, but that wasn't the case for us.\n\nI mentioned that it was one of our friend's birthday, a slice of the NY cheesecake was served accented with a birthday candle.  That was excellent.  Great silky texture and not too sweet.  Dessert and the salad were the only two redeeming things I had for dinner.\n\nBottom line, don't bother going here.  The tab for me and the hubby came out to $100 (that includes tip).  I don't mind spending a few bucks on steak, but it better be good steak.  We won't be back.", "author": "Sophia V."}

Where do I start??? This place is great, from the customers service, to the ambiance, to the food. If you are looking for a fancy steakhouse this place isn't the place for you, this isn't ruth chris or mortons but it's in a category of its own.  The customer service is always outstanding, being a regular i'm sure helps but since the very first visit I have been treated great! The ambiance is one that is out of a movie, place isn't fancy but has lots of character. If I had anything to complain about is that towards the back of the restaurant it tends to get hot. This is the type of place you would find Tony from the Sopranos having a sit down with a rival boss! The food has been consistent from the first day I have had a meal here which was probably 8-9 years ago or so. I usually flip flop between the skirt steak and the salmon, i stick to the same sides which are the creamed spinach and the baked sweet potato. Also note they have an awesome sunday brunch!!!!

Izzy's was recommended by somebody else in the group.  We were seated upstairs away from the noise of the bar downstairs.  There were only 2 other groups seated upstairs so it was pretty quiet.  \n\nOur waiter was friendly and fairly attentive to our needs.  He knew the menu and had lots of recommendations for various dining preferences.  Our drinks came quickly and our orders were placed shortly after that.  \n\nThe house salad was good with a nice vinaigrette, it was a good size when split between two people.  The bread they provided was fine, a generic, soft, wheat loaf served at room temperature.  \n\nMost of the table ordered steaks.  Everybody's steaks came out cooked more or less correctly.  The one person who had a burger sent it back since it was still rare (they brought the exact same burger back 10 minutes later burnt to a crisp rather than make a new one properly).  I had the rib-eye medium rare.  You could tell they cooked it at too high of a heat, the outside of the steak was well done and there was a sliver of medium rare in the middle.  The steak was not seasoned at all and I resorted to using sauce to make it edible.  \n\nMy wife had the skirt steak which is served teriyaki style, i.e., drenched in teriyaki sauce.  It was cooked a little under but for us that's generally better than over.  The cut was a little tough and the teriyaki sauce was a bit much.  \n\nI'm not a huge fan of scalloped potatoes so the Izzy's potatoes didn't win me over.  The vegetable options for sides other than 5 different kinds of potatoes were broccoli, carrots and onions or creamed spinach.  I went with the carrots and, meh, was pretty much what i expected.  Good thing I had a salad.\n\nMy wife and I both woke up the next day with upset stomaches.  A perfect end to a blah meal.  \n\nThe $100 we paid would have been better spent elsewhere.

I've referred dozens and dozens of family & friends to this restaurant and so far no one is unhappy.  Unlike many upscale steakhouses that may be pretentious, the old-school & laid-back atmosphere of this tavern really lets you chomp down your steak without reservations.  \n\nThe first thing you will notice when you enter this place is that everyone is having a great time.  There are many return customers just hanging out and chatting up with their favorite waiter or bartender.  You most likely be greeted by  the friendly and warm owner of this great place, Sam Duvall.  He is always smiling and showing appreciation towards his patrons.  Then you will notice there are hundreds of popular bottled sauces lined up all over the two-floor restaurant.  Such a fun and cool idea!\n\nMy favorite picks here are:\n1) New York Steak Au Poive (a generous sized steak with a creamy black-pepper brandy sauce)\n2) Cajun Fried Oyster (delicious battered oysters served alongside an awesome green sauce that I always save to dip my bread in)\n3)  Keylime Pie:  I have a weakness for keylime pie.\n4)  Izzy's own scalloped potatoes & Creamed Spinach:  Each entree is served with two side dishes without additional charge.  UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThis neighborhood gem is my go-to place whenever friends want to hang out in the Marina.  It never disappoints!  In fact I might go have my steak tonite....again.", "author": "Gloria Y."}

When we walked in I loved the atmosphere of this old school steak house. We were even lucky enough to score seats at the bar on a Saturday night, which the host informed us was quite rare. The evening started out with a well made dirty martini for me, but everything went downhill from there.\n\nI had two major problems with the restaurant:\n\n1. The steak was sub par. I had the filet mignon with the pepper cream sauce - the meat was chewy and not the quality I would have expected considering the price. It was as if they figured they could cover up the low quality meat with the sauce. My fianc\u00e9 had the sirloin which was slightly better but still left something to be desired. On another note, the sides were very good - specifically the creamed spinach and izzy's style potatoes. Hands down the best part of the meal. \n\n2. Since we sat at the bar the bartender (Willie) was our waiter. He was completely inappropriate. Throughout the evening he had friends (mostly girls) coming in and out of the bar. A group of drunk girls stopped by to visit him. One elbowed up to the bar right where I was eating, making it difficult for me to focus as she slurred her words asking the bartender for a drink. The bar tender seemed to encourage their behavior with frequent drink refills and a slew of appetizers plates. It was difficult for me to enjoy my meal as drunk girls were constantly nudging me and leaning over my space. At one point the bartender and some of the girls got in a loud conversation about their college days, which included swearing and vulgar information.\n\nAll in all, definitely not worth the money. The food was nothing special and the service we experienced was ridiculous and a complete turn off.", "author": "Lindsay T."}

Too bad my memory was better than this recent experience. Although seated quickly after checking in with our reservation, the kitchen was waay backed up and we were very delayed in getting our entrees. Over 30\" went by after our appetizers were cleared before any other food besides the bread basket appeared. For appetizers we had nicely battered and crisped calamari, on the chewy side of the scale, and some cold poached asparagus with a mustard sauce that was nicely prepared. The tomahawk steak on the bone was adequate. Could use more seasoning and not as tender as the other diners at our table would have liked it to be. The filet was tender, but still suffered from under seasoning, the prime rib was sadly tough and highly forgettable, especially when compared with the awesomeness that is the House of Prime Rib. Tough competition to beat in the SF steakhouse market. The star of the beef at our table was the skirt steak remarkably enough. Tender and finally, very nicely marinated and seasoned. For sides: the creamed spinach was had a great hit of nutmeg, baked potato and house Izzy potatoes were entirely forgettable and under seasoned once again. The side of fries had to be sent back and taken off the check for being frozen on the inside and mealy, like biting into formed sawdust. My cocktail was A+ however, a dragonfruit cosmo recommended by the server. It delivered a nice tart, well balanced finish. However the bartender was stumped by a table mate's order of a Vespa martini, very popular in Miami dining, that combines both Vodka, and Gin. Aside from a pleasant atmosphere, skip this place for House of Prime Rib any time.", "author": "Paige B."}

You're bartender wasn't.  You were dismissive and raised your voice to ME when I asked you repeatedly why you didn't tell me until 20 min after I ordered that I wouldn't be served.  And \"I tried to help you out.\" is not an answer.  Tell me HOW you tried to help me out?

Our good friends suggested we eat here after we finished our obligatory Friday night drinking at the Balboa Cafe.  We started the day off at Pier 23 around 2.   I had 2 beers and 3 vodka red bulls.   Then we had a 2 hour break and picked up around 6 and started drinking at the Balboa.  There, I diligently managed to ingest 4 Plymouth Gin martinis.   Let's just say I wasn't driving that night.\n\nSo we walked into Izzy's around 8 or 8:30 and we got a booth all the way in the back.   They must have smelled the alcohol on my breath and figured I needed to detox back there or something.   Anyway, I was advised to order a Filet Mignon with Izzy's Potatoes and creamed spinach.\n\nHOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!!!   I was drunk and I can't remember the wine that my wife ordered, other than the fact it was a red wine.   I probably drank half a glass or so.    I can tell you with complete clarity, however, the consistency (creamy with cheesy gratin chunks) and taste (fucking unbelievable!) of Izzy's Potatoes.   The creamed spinach, too, were amazing!   And I'm not much of a meat eater, and I still managed to eat probably 4/5 of the Filet Mignon (rare, thank you very much).\n\nI so am dying to come back here slightly more on the sober side...  This place is awesome!  The booths are very comfortable and inviting, and somehow push intimacy and privacy in the way they are laid out.  They have a shelf with tons of condiments right there for you to smother your meat with.    No really... I am dying to come back here and do all my drinking and eating under one roof.

Each time, I was never disappointed...with the food.  \n\nThis place is always crowded.  We always get a reservation, but end up waiting just the same.  It is a typical steak and chop restaurant.  The tables are very close together.  So close, I walked out smelling like the Drakar the guy was wearing next to me.  Still, with the low lighting and dark wood, there is something charming about it.  Its as if we are all on a secret journey together to find the perfect steak.\n\nRule #1: If I am going to a steak place,  I don't eat the seafood. Rule #2: If I am going to eat red meat, it shouldn't be gray in the middle (i.e. not well done).  In fact, I like it mooing.  Yes, I am a carnivore.  Rule #3, if I get a snotty waitress, I wait until the meal is over and then tell the manager on the way out.  I also do this if I get a great waiter/waitress.  \n\nThe first time we went went there, I ordered the slow roasted Prime Rib and my husband had the Ribeye.  Though I ordered mine medium rare, it came medium.  Despite the mistake we both enjoyed the meal with sides ( mine-baked potato, his-Izzy's potatoes and a shared creamed spinach).  The waiter was descent, but not outstanding.  \n\nThe second time, my husband had the Filet Mignon Medallions Au Poivre with Pepper Cream Sauce.  I sampled his and let me tell you I regretted getting my Prime Rib.  Though I ordered it medium rare, it came medium.  Second time that happened.  I had a sweet potato; which was baked perfectly.  My husband had the Izzy Potatoes again.  We also shared the creamed spinach.  What can I say, the creamed spinach is flipping amazing.  \n\nThe third time, I went for the Filet Mignon Medallions Au Poivre, Pepper Cream Sauce.  I was not disappointed.  My husband went for the Double Cut Pork Chop with Spiced Pear.  Neither of us are big pork fans.  This was so tender and the pear was both tangy and sweet.  There is only one other place where the pork chop was that good.  It has since gone of business in Phoenix.  \n\nThe fourth time I took my sister-in-law while we were on a girl's get away weekend.  I ordered the Filet Mignon again.  It was better than I remembered.  We shared the Izzy potatoes.  What was the difference?  The waiter.  He was very attentive. Answered every question.  Our food was served promptly.  My water glass was never empty and he event checked on us several times through out the meal.  \n\nIzzy's is definitely a do again.

This time it was because we got a great Groupon deal. Sadly, despite my previous patronage, we were openly talked about with disdain among the staff as they described their displeasure of us \"Grouponers\". The bartender, who also served us food because they couldn't give us a table reservation, never bothered to check if we were enjoying our food. If he had, he'd find out that my \"medium-rare\" filet had been overcooked and dried to medium well/well done. I didn't bother to make a stink about it because of my \"groupon guilt\". \n\nWe were still good people and tipped him 20+% of the pre-groupon discount amount despite his poor attitude and awful service simply out of, again, \"groupon guilt\", but the service and food barely deserved a $1 tip. \n\nI have been to some of the best steakhouses in the country due to wining and dining clients, and Izzy's is by far the bottom of the barrel. I've had better steak at Outback, which is embarrassing for a place like Izzy's that tries to be just like the other old school (and expensive) steakhouses. \n\nThe two stars are added simply for their weekend brunch. The brunch food and bottomless mimosas are actually a great deal relative to their poorly-cooked and dry dinner steaks that are priced just as high as other steakhouses. \n\nIf you want better steak in SF that's worth the price, go to Harris' or House of Prime Rib.", "author": "Ryan E."}

I had been looking forward to a juicy steak for a few weeks and decided to give Izzy's a spin.\n\nI get there with my friend and we are completely ignored by the host, who is on the phone. I've been a hostess and i understand that yes, the phone rings and things get busy but this guy needs to learn the art of multi-tasking and dealing with the customer in front of you, first and foremost. Also, it was a Wednesday night and the place was not busy. \n\nAfter standing there for 10 minutes patiently, I had to ask the next staff member I saw if we could be seated. He took us to some crap table for 4 in the middle of the place (there were two of us), and I politely requested if we could please have one of the smaller, more intimate booth areas. Or even a table off to the side.\n\nAgain, the place was only about 1/4 full, but the server insisted we stay at that table. I was confused. He then said he had a party of 5 coming, and that they would sit at the booth we requested. There were multiple booths open. Strange. So we sat at the table awkwardly for 20 minutes without seeing a server. Needless to say we got up and left for a much better venue a few blocks away. Not sure what Izzy's had against us this night, but it was a bad experience to be treated like an invisible person, and I will not be going back.\n\nIt seemed like a classic server politics situation (the one seating us wanted the larger party, the server section rotation was strict, etc..) was getting in the way of what could have been a lovely experience.", "author": "Hope K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-18", "description": "I was very unhappy, for the first time ever with Izzy's on 3/9/14.  I tried to privately inform the manager via FB message but after a week and no response I decided I would post a shortened version(under 5001 char) of our visit:\n\nI love your restaurant.  My whole family has enjoyed every meal we've had at Izzy's ever since we walked through the door almost 20 years ago.  Since then, we have had countless great meals, family dinners, and celebrated many life milestones here.  It is always the first restaurant we think of when getting a group to go out for dinner.  That being said, we know what an Izzy's Prime Rib, the Izzy's Own Potatoes, and the creamed spinach does and should taste like.\n\nA few weeks ago my parents went to Izzy's.  I couldn't go because I had work, but was instantly jealous. However, my mom reported her prime rib did not taste the same.  She said there was a lot of rosemary and it totally changed the flavor of her meal.  This was the first time I had ever heard a complaint about Izzy's.  I was surprised but figured they can't always be perfect.\n\nThis past Sunday my wife and I were craving prime rib and decided we needed to go to Izzy's again.  I called my parents and we all went.\n\nWe walked in and were seated promptly.  My mom asked our waiter if the prime rib recipe had changed, because she felt it had more rosemary than usual.  He said he  would look into it and returned to inform us that more rosemary had been added to the seasoning than before.  I don't mind rosemary so I ordered my usual, prime rib with creamed spinach and Izzy's own potatoes.  My mom changed from prime rib to the Filet Mignon Medallions Au Poivre.\n\nWhen our food arrived, I immediately noticed the potatoes were different.  The color was a little whiter, almost cream color, rather than the usual yellow/orange cheddar cheese color.  I tried them and the flavor was off.  They tasted ok, defiantly lacking the regular amount of cheese and the little bits of burnt crusty cheese that are usually mashed inside.  Also the potatoes were not properly cooked and had a noticeable crunch from being undercooked.  I moved onto the cream spinach which tasted normal.\n\nThen I tried the prime rib.  The cut was great and it was cooked perfectly to order.  However, the Izzy's prime rib I know, with a nice peppery crust and a great peppery salt flavor within, was not what was in front of me.  This was a new type prime rib.  The new seasoning blend permeated the meat and took away any pepper or saltiness the meat had, if it ever had any at all.\n\nMy mom was not impressed with her meal either.  The filet was fine, but the peppercorn cream sauce was bland.  It tasted like heavy cream with some pepper in it, no salt flavor at all.  I added salt to the sauce and it fixed the problem, but, a patron should not have to fix a sauce.\n\nI looked around the table and everyone appeared to be let down.  My wife had the same complaints about the Izzy's potatoes.  She always orders a double side of them and could not even finish them this time.  My dad, who is a fan of any steak, remarked at how his prime rib was different than normal.  \n\nWe did not want a comped meal or anything like that.  We are not the type of people who send plates back or complain to get something given to us, unless something is seriously wrong.  But I had to ask our waiter why everything was so different.  So we decided to wait until after we paid.  \n\nWhile talking to him on our way out, I asked if everything had changed.  He said the rosemary in the prime rib was more than before.  He also said the creamed spinach changes a little here or there.  I told him that we were not crazy about the changes and the rosemary prime rib was a big change for what was a great prime rib meal.\n\nAfter the meal we walked around Chestnut disappointed.  It was very sad, almost like we lost an old friend.  I didn't and couldn't believe my mom when she said she was not happy with her last visit, but now I just experienced what she described.  I know what Izzy's tastes like and I have been enjoying it for almost 20 years.  Why a very successful restaurant would change its recipes after almost 30 years in business is beyond me, but I will find a new restaurant if it is true.  If this is the new Izzy's, I am very sad to say I will not be a part of it.\n\nI have recommended Izzy's over the House of Prime Rib, Harris', Ruth's Chris, and Morton's too many times to recall.  But after the meal I had Sunday, I can no longer say Izzy's is the best with the new seasoning and recipes.  We all were very upset with the changes and agreed that if Izzy's keeps these new recipes, we will not be returning.\n\nI did not want to make a bad comment on Yelp or Facebook because I love the restaurant and wish it success. But, we all felt that we needed to let you know, we notice the difference, we do not like the new changes, and unfortunately will start looking to find a new restaurant because it appears our restaurant is gone.", "author": "Rich C."}

We could not be seated until the whole group had showed up, so we waited at the bar.  The bartenders are great and the drinks were good!  Prefunking before dinner is always fun.\n\nOnce we all arrived and were seated, we got bread and shared the Prawn Cocktail and Calamari for starters.  It was really good, too!  My favorite were the prawns, which were big, juicy, and flavorful!  The sauce it came with was quite tasty.\n\nMain Course - $34.95 Bone in Ribeye 20 oz. (yes, it was big!  Yeah, that's what she said) cooked medium-rare and aged in a vacuum packed bag had some tendon and a lot of fat on the edge, but the ribeye itself was not \"marbled.\"  The steak was not seasoned and not flavorful.  Pretty dissapointing as this goes down as the most dissapointing ribeye I have ever had. Minus one star.\n\nAs for the sides I ordered Izzy's Own Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach.  These were great accompaniments as they added real flavor to the bland steak.\n\nI also wanted to order a red wine to drink with my dinner, but our waiter was no where to be found and I didn't feel like hunting him down.  Minus another star.\n\nFinale - And then there was dessert.  If it wasn't for Robin, I don't think anyone would of ordered desserts.  I'm sure glad she started and everyone else followed suit because I got to try Chocolate Mousse Cake and New York Cheese Cake.  Both of these desserts get five starts on their own!  Superb desserts!\n\nConclusion - Overall, the experience here was good, but next time I think I'll try the Slow-Roasted Prime Rib.", "author": "Edward A."}

The hostess asked how many and we stated 4.  She was about to take us to one of the 5 or 6 open tables that were available which then she asked if the rest of our party was here.  We told her not yet but that they were just parking to which she responded that the rest of our party needed to be there to be seated.  Not sure if that's just restaurant policy, but again, there were plenty of tables available.\n\nWe got sat at a table in the back corner of the restaurant which was ok, but the empty booth next to us looked more comfortable to sit at.  When the busser came by to fill up the waters, we kindly asked if we could switch over 1 seat, and he stated he would check with the hostess.  The hostess quickly shot us down on the request stating there was a reservation waiting to be sat.  The reserved party did not end up showing up until our food was even out.\n\nFood - 2.5/5\nOnto the food.. the GF ordered a standard sized prime rib which was perfect looking even for the regular 12oz cut.  Sides of Ike's potatoes and creamed spinach were also well above par.  My rib-eye which I ordered medium-rare came out literally with charred bits falling off the sides.  I was already skeptical, but cut it open anyway and the only pink I could see was in the very middle, which was medium-well at best.  I quickly returned it back to the kitchen, and our server Joelle offered either a prime rib for immediate replacement or a re-fired rib-eye.  I opted for the rib-eye because that's just what I was itchin for at the time.\n\nTo make our poorly timed meal worse, my rib-eye came out cooked correctly this time, but I can't describe it any other way that it tasting more like a New York steak rather than a rib-eye.  I normally never put any sauce when eating rib eyes, but I had to drench this one in the various sauces on the wall to get any flavor out of it.  It was edible, I was hungry, and it cost $36 so I decided to finish it.\n\nService - 4/5\nOur server Joelle was very well mannered and attentive to our needs.  However towards the mid-end of our meal, she came to us and stated in exact words \"You know this comes with another glass of wine..bottle of wine..anything you want?\"  I was under the implication of a comp here due to the complications with dinner.  So we ordered another bottle of the KJ Vintner's cab.  When our check came out, it was charged so I had to have a small discussion with her and she ended up apologizing for and comping us that bottle and our desserts.  The bussing staff is also constantly filling up your waters soon as they are half empty.", "author": "Gene K."}

The manager that checked us in was so accommodating and helped us get a perfect table for our group of 7. We started with some Roederer champagne and loved the generous pours. Ordered some calamari, Caesar salads, and prawn cocktail. The large prawns were very tasty and the cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish was delicious. The filet mignon and ribeye were cooked to a perfect medium rare and as recommended by our server to have it charred, made our dinner perfect. We are a very picky bunch but the server (Tom) made everyone happy by catering to all our needs (substitutions, special requests, etc.) and getting our order perfect. 3 filet mignons, 2 bone in ribeyes, salmon and shrimp...each dish was prepared perfectly. Love that the sides (2) are included with the entrees. French fries with the chipotle aioli, creamed spinach, baked sweet potato, and Izzy's potatoes were all very good. The desserts were also very yummy... Cheesecake, chocolate cake, key lime pie, and strawberries with grand marnier.", "author": "Kyoko T."}

I never thought it would happen, and even today, the story is as improbable and unlikely as you could imagine.  I didn't want it to happen.  I wasn't looking for it.  But, such is love: unpredictable, fickle, a sheer force of nature, capable of striking one dumb.  And when that clarion trumpet calls, you have no choice but to answer it.  The one redeeming grace is that Wifey loves her every bit as much as I do.  Which is equally improbable, but this whole story seems far fetched until you really think about it.\n\nNow, our beloved Marina girl is quite different than what you're probably picturing.  She'd never be caught dead wearing a ball cap with a pony tail sticking out the back of it.  I've never seen her wear pink.  She's partial to dark wood, and quiet spaces.  She gets up early.  And she's one hell of a cook.  I'm addicted to her skirt steak and eggs---the skirt steak is tender, amazingly seasoned, and correctly cooked.  Wifey prefers her prime rib sandwich.  And when Wifey asks this Marina girl to forego the french fries and instead whip up some creamed spinach, our girl doesn't bat an eye.\n\nAll these wiles have kept Wifey and I coming back very regularly.  The availability of nearby (and validated, sorta) parking REALLY helps.  I don't think we every would have fallen in love if I would have had to search for parking every time we saw her.\n\nI have no idea how long the romance will last.  Such things are not given to mortal man to know---every time such a relationship begins, you always think it's going to last forever, yet the data shows otherwise.

We were seated in the middle of the whole restaurant and could barely hear ourselves talk. It's really just a personal preference that we wanted a quiet place to enjoy dinner. We asked if we could sit in a more secluded spot, and moved. Still, I would come here if I had a big family dinner in which we wouldn't mind being loud. 5 stars.\n\nThe food was, to us, properly priced. Unlimited bread with butter, Steak with two sides. I had the prime rib with creamed spinach and Izzy's Own Potatoes. My boyfriend had the new york steak. Both medium rare. The New York Steam was SLIGHTLY medium, but it was okay. For the prices, it was worth it only since there were sides. The Izzy's Own Potatoes were good, only since I love cheesiness. Creamed Spinach were a big slightly too creamy for my liking. 4.5 Stars.\n\nThe service was good. I don't like expecting much, since I know a lot of people demand 5 star services everywhere they go. I'm pretty lenient when it comes to that. However, I do enjoy when servers make conversation personal. My server was pretty standard. \"What would you like? How would you like it? Be right back.\" Standard. Checked back with us a few times. Had our waters filled. It was standard. 4.5 Stars\n\nIn the end, I would only recommend this place if you want a big family dinner, not for a romantic getaway.

Some of the side dishes were correct many were not.  When my cousin asked for his biscuit, the server said, \"oh, we are out of those\" and walked away (with attitude).  Getting water, let alone more mimosas was a feet in itself.\n\nHowever the worst part of the meal was trying to pay the bill.  We were using groupons so I understand the server bringing a \"pre-bill\" so we can accurately tip BUT she included all 6 entrees, 6 champagne drinks & the value of the groupon thereby increasing the total bill by $78.00 (which was a random amount because the groupons were $25.00 each).  When the \"real\" bill came she had only taken off two (instead of 4) entrees & no champagne drinks.  Since Izzy's solicited the groupon they should make sure their staff can handle them.  It took 4 tries to get a correct bill & when the last (and correct) bill finally came it was thrown down on the table.\n\nI gave this two stars (I really wanted to give it 1 1/2) only because the bartender was friendly & courteous & the host was gracious & welcoming...the rest of the staff was unprofessional & sloppy.  \n\n\nFortunately, there are many other places in the Marina that serve delicious brunch with excellent service.", "author": "Molly J."}

My friends and I came to izzy steakhouse on Saturday, May 16th 2015 around 8pm...Unfortunately my excitement came to an end when the waitress was rolling her eyes at my friends while she was taking their orders... Secondly, my skirt steak tasted like beef jerky and was dry.... My creamy spinach looked like spinach dip and tasted like it was overcooked spinach mixed in with some cream cheese and sour cream... Baked potato was plain... My meal costed $40... Anyway the story doesn't end there... So we didn't see our waitress until an hour and a half later when we had to flag another employee down to asked him if he could get our waitress... There were nine of us girls at the table and needed our water refilled and needed our bill... So the waitress finally came to our table and was only able to refill 4 of our water and she said that she ran out of water... I know that we are in a drought but really tho? A restaurant that charges $40-$80 per person runs out of some water? So when the waitress finally gave us our bill.. She wrote on our bill that her tip should be at least $50... My friends and I are usually good at tipping .. But since the services that we received was unprofessional and unacceptable.. We gave her a tip but it was definitely not $50... So we all walked downstairs and some of our friends needed to use the restroom so my other friends and I just chilled by the bar to wait for them.. As we were waiting for our friends, the waitress walked down the stairs and approached us saying that we did not give her enough tip and we politely explained to her that we were not happy with the services that was provided... The waitress did not like our explanation so she opened the door and scream loudly telling us to leave... The other patrons in the restaurant all turned and stared at us... Some of my friends walked out the door and the waitress made some racial comments to them.. So my friend and I still continued to wait by the bar for our other friends to make sure that they get out okay.. The waitress continuously yelled at us to leave the restaurant.. At this point, we just asked to talk to the manager... The general manager , Edwin walked in and we told him what happened and all he did was he gave us his business card and told us to call him.. Very inconvenient, especially when we were out of town.. We didn't want to have our night ruined so we just left.. I normally don't write bad reviews online... But to save some of you guys a trip... You would be better off eating at L & L Hawaiian BBQ ...at least you know for sure that they won't run out of water...We won't be back there ever again..", "author": "Anh D."}

For less than half the price of a mediocre sushi meal next door, you can get a fine steak, in an old school atmosphere.  The marinated skirt steak is amazing and easy on the wallet.  The Izzy's potatoes and the desserts are top notch.  The prime rib is awesome and I can't wait to try the New York.  Izzy's could easily be a 5 star place, but there are some issues.  First of all, the service can be spotty...while always friendly and attentive, it can be slow.  We were in a back corner last night and basically got forgotten.  The waiter could tell we were not lounging around and left bread stating he would be right back to take our order...and left us for ten minutes.  Never came back after delivering our food and had to be flagged down for the check.  Secondly, parking sucks.  While not really Izzy's fault, dealing with parking IS part of the dining experience there.  While you can get lucky on a weeknight, don't even try on the weekends.  Really, the whole neighborhood, Izzy's included, is a complete mess on the weekends; don't bother.  Lastly, while the food menu prices are more than reasonable, the bar prices are very high.  Two draft beers should not be over $15 with tip, and you will get positively skewered on a mixed drink, not to mention a decent wine.

Therefore, when he was in town, we wandered our way (read drank our way) over to Izzy's on a Tuesday night. \n\nWe met some more folks and ended up at a table for 8 upstairs in the corner near that gorilla in the business pictures.  Izzy's is a casual place that has a shelf all around both the upstairs and downstairs that is large enough to hold a very VERY large collection of bottled steak sauces, bottled hot sauces, and bottled sauces in general.\n\nOur waiter is on it, and gets drinks ordered quickly.  He comes back with the drinks and asks who hasn't been to Izzy's before.  To these folks he explains the policy that ordering an entre includes 2 of the list of sides.  Here's your crib sheet if you end up going:  Izzy's Potatoes (au gratin style) and the creamed spinach.  If you want the NY strip, potatoes and spinach.  If you want the blackened fillet, potatoes and spinach.  If you get the salmon, yup, potatoes and spinach.  If you get the Tofu, well you might not want to tell Philip G.  That's a joke folks, they don't have tofu.  No question about that.\n\nWe are well treated by the wait staff.  The food comes, and.....it's OK.  The creamed spinach and potatoes are EXCELLENT, but my steak was so so.  I asked for medium rare, and it is medium rare.  It looks right, it smells right, but I just don't get that great taste I'm looking for.  Everyone else was very happy with their food, so maybe it was me.\n\nMartinis were excellent.

The sides are good, particularly Izzy's Own Potatoes.    \n \nHowever, at its worst, as my last dinner there will attest, Izzy's can be really bad.  I'm a low maintenance person and diner.  If it's passable, it gets eaten.  If it's a bad meal, I chalk it up to bad luck and move on.  A medium filet mignon isn't tough to do and when I showed my waiter the still mooing bleeding rawness of my steak's pastel interior that it took her 50 minutes to bring me, she confided that the kitchen was having a lot of problems that night.  No problemo - let's try this again.\n \nShe brought it back a half hour later after much ghosting.  The wrong cut of meat.  And raw/rare.  Again.  Are we having a failure to communicate or is she now actively f'ing with me?  She cooed sympathetically, admitted the mistake, and offered recompense: extra sides and a bottle of Pellegrino.  Err,what?  Two hour later, I never got my steak and when I asked to see a manager to discuss the bill (the last time I asked to see a manager was never) she offered that \"he's really busy right now.\"  Busy doing what?  Running supply chain for the United Nations in Haiti?  I paid the bill and jetted, the bottle of Pellgrino clutched in my hand like a GOOD TRY TIMMY! participation trophy.  \n \nLife's too short to try to fix Izzy's logistical problems and bizarre customer service.

The server was beyond inattentive and rude -- he was quite literally looking to pick a fight with us.  It is likely because he was upset that the owner gave us a booth after the surly server told us we could not have a booth.  I guess he suspected he would make a better tip with four people in the booth, which was not the case.  Being in the restaurant business, we tip based on experience, not on percentage of the check (we'd already tipped the host $20).  Long story short, we ended up leaving before we were even served dinner solely because we could not take another minute of this arrogant server.  Management could have assigned another server to our table so we could have enjoyed our dinner, but they didn't.  The new management needs to understand that its loyal customer base will not put up with rude and obnoxious servers.  (Note that when we told the arrogant server we had been going to Izzy's for some 30 years, his response was \"that's impossible; we've only been here for 27 years.\"  Thanks for the clarification, sir, make that 27 years we've been dining here).  There are plenty of other good steak houses in San Francisco.  This was honestly the worst \"dining\" experience I have ever had in the 20+ years I have lived in the City.

He had work on the day of and it was just a bad V-day day overall so some good meat was just what I needed to cheer up. My bf had been raving about this place for quite some time and kept using the line \"I really need to take you to Izzy's\" for even longer. So in that light I guess you could say I had expectations. Just a disclaimer: I would definitely not consider myself a meat connoisseur. I mean I know the difference between tender and not and I know I don't like it bloody. I think my problem is that I'm incapable of eating quickly so buy the time i finish my meal it's not the same as it was when I started. \n\nbut ANYWAY, we had reservations that were honored very quickly. The hostess seated us as soon as we were able to check in with her. For an appetizer we had the cajun fried oysters. I was disappointed in these because I was expecting something crisp. Instead the breading was soft and oily and it all just turned into mush in my mouth. For the main course, I ordered the slow roasted prime rib with Izzy's potatoes and carrots and onions. My bf ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions Au Poivre, Pepper Cream Sauce (I had to look that up because I would not have remembered it) with a baked potato and creamed spinach. The prime rib was good, but I liked his order much better. The sauce had a little bit of sweetness to it and the medallions were perfect. As for the sides, the creamed spinach and Izzy's potatoes were my favorites. \n\nI say it's an \"occasion\" restaurant, meaning I'd go there for a birthday or some kind of celebration because I like the ambiance and the idea of the place. I wouldn't really choose to go there otherwise. \n\nBtw, it's kinda neat how they line up their sauces along the walls of the restaurants. If you get lucky and spot the pepper jelly (its green) try it out - it's kinda trippy. My taste buds are still trying to decide if it's good - haha.", "author": "Danielle G."}

So when the bf & I exited the movie theater at 8:45pm without any dinner plans, I knew we could just wander up, down & around Chestnut Street & end up at someplace delicious. \n\nIzzy's is an anomaly in its own neighborhood. It is not modern or trendy, like most restaurants in this area. It's decor is somewhere between traditional & eclectic. The atmosphere is laid back, unpretentious & as our waiter mentioned, \"they don't put on airs.\" \n\nI applaud Izzy's for including two sides with their dishes, giving us a more full meal that was wallet friendly ($66 not including tip for a steakhouse dinner for two.) The bf & I both ordered filet mignon medallions au poivre w/ a pepper cream sauce, which came w/ two huge medallions, a whoppin' 4-5 oz each. One came out perfectly well done like I ordered, but the other was pink & red in the middle (perfect for the bf, but not for me.) \n\nTheir sides were presented simply. We chose: baked potato, sweet potato, creamed spinach (I've had better) & Izzy's Own Potatoes (scalloped, very good.) Numerous condiments & sauces sat on the ledge that surrounded our table, so any extras we needed was within reach. \n\nI really liked our waiter--he made great suggestions after listening to what I was looking for, was available when we needed him & I found out he is a native San Franciscan like me! Izzy's is an affordable, satisfying place for a steak dinner. \n\nSidenote: Ask me what Izzy's has to do with my (temporarily) lost keys.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

The only reason I added +1 star was because the server was really friendly and efficient (as was the person who found us a table). \n\nMaybe my judgement of prime rib is exceptionally harsh because I LOOOOVE prime rib.  Compared to other places in the city and south bay, this Izzy's just didn't stack up.  It had a lot of gristle and I ended up leaving almost half of my steak on my plate.  If you want a workout with your meal, this might be a good choice because I had to put a lot of elbow grease into finding a good bite.\n\nI'd save my money next time and go to the tried and true restaurants like House of Prime Rib, Broadway Prime, and Harris'.\n\nOf course, the sides were definitely good.  \n\nWould I recommend?

When we arrived, they made us wait for 15 minutes while they set up the table then said they were 'looking for chairs'?  They seated us at FOLDING TABLES (no table cloths) and four of our guests sat on FOLDING CHAIRS. Then said they would swap out the chairs once some became available (they never did).  Then we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for any type of drink or food service.  I did walk up to the front to inquire on when we will be served and the front lobby was jam packed with folks and no host/hostess to be seen.  Lots of grumbling was heard.  I resigned to patiently wait it out since I could not easily move our large group to another restaurant.  Our first waiter bailed on us and luckily the second waiter, Alberto, was kind.  My concern was for my son who has severe food allergies.  Alberto was attentive and provided safe food for him which I appreciate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-03-05", "description": "This past Saturday night I attended a birthday celebration at Izzy's which included a total of 16 people. The reservation had been made weeks in advance, and the restaurant was well aware that they had a party of 16 booked that night. The reservation was for 6:30, but after meeting at the bar and waiting for everyone to arrive we did not take our seats until about 7:00pm. In addition, I had ordered a cake from SF Cake Gallery (they are AWESOME) and it was to be delivered that afternoon. I called the restaurant and let them know the cake would be delivered  and a very helpful Kate said she would let everyone know to expect it. When I arrived at the restaurant I met Kate and she explained that the cake never arrived and didn't know what happened but there was a bakery down the street so she escorted us down there and let the bakery know the situation. She was very, very helpful and very nice.  We were able to get a cake and got back to Izzy's and got situated upstairs. It seemed to take longer than customary for someone to take our drink order but someone eventually did and we relaxed. The drinks took what seemed exceptionally long to arrive, but they did arrive and we placed our orders for dinner.\nI have been to Izzy's previously and have always had stellar food and stellar service (downstairs). I was expecting that same level of service but was most unhappily surprised. Our entrees took about an hour to receive after we ordered and that was just the first few. It took an additional 10-15 minutes for the rest of the table to be served as I sat there staring at my $30 piece of meat getting cold and being ruined. In addition, it looked as if someone had literally thrown the food on the plate with no regard for presentation whatsoever. By the time I did begin to eat I was so over the dinner I didn't even want it.\nEventually the bill arrived and we began to divvy it up and I noticed that there was a $40 charge for cake cutting. Are you kidding me? This was an almost $800 bill, the worst service known to mankind and they had the audacity to slip in this $40 charge. I marched down stairs, spoke with sweet Kate and some man standing beside her who I can only assume was the manager. He said he would remove it so thankfully that was done.\nOh, and when I called the bakery today to find out what happened to my cake the owner assured me that he had delivered it himself that very afternoon. So who ate the cake? \nI will never, under any circumstance, ever go back to that restaurant.  I am a corporate event planner, and I totally understand that \"things\" happen. I actually would have considered hosting an event there! OMG NEVER AGAIN!", "author": "Diane D."}

Mine was perfectly cool in the center.\n\nOn another note, I would like to report some disappointment in our dining experience. We brought our friends visiting from Hawaii to your restaurant, as recommended by other patrons. Last Friday night, we were seated at 8:15PM, and our meal did not arrive until 9:45PM.... nearly 2 hours later! Our server was unprofessional in telling us that our meal would be ready in \"one minute\", then leaving our table unattended for nearly 30 minutes at a time. We brought our own wine, and finished two bottles before our meal had arrived, and we ordered another bottle from your restaurant to accompany dinner. Unfortunately, that purchased bottle of wine arrived after our meal was complete.  Three bottles of wine, none to go with your steaks.  And, although I personally enjoyed my steak, all of the plates appeared to have been resting for a quite some time when they arrived at our table.  I'm sad to say our guests from Hawaii were very disappointed, and so were we.\n\nI intended to provide this feedback constructively, and I understand Izzy's is about excellence. I did not appreciate the poor service, and the attitude of our server. She was young, and projected herself that way. I did not appreciate her calling her fellow support crew \"slaves\" in front of us, when she asked them to bring us some bread. It was perhaps playful, but very unprofessional. \n\nWe do have a Groupon, so we will be returning, but I am hopeful for a better all-around dining experience at Izzys next visit.", "author": "J K."}

They suggested that we catch a taxi--a $10 cab ride--over self parking, though they do offer free 90 minutes of validated parking. Despite the price, very definitely a casual place.\n\nWe enjoyed a filet and a rib-eye on the bone. We tried their classic Izzy's Own Potatoes, which are a kind of a mild German potato without being too heavy. The size of the side portions were generous. The steaks were both delicious. The service was snappy, but attentiveness varied. Sometimes our drinks got refilled before we could ask, and other times we had a bit of a wait.

But more so, it's the place to go if you want to FEEL like a local.   I don't go to Izzy's just because their skirt steak is awesome (better than the filet), or because they have the best restaurant-style breakfast burrito.  Honestly, the kitchen continuously forgets something on my order.  I go to Izzy's for the service.  Their bartender Phil will remember your name every time, and never lets you wait for a drink, even when it's busy.  More so, he cares; both about his what he does and his customers.  More places in SF need to remember that it's not just about the food, it's about the experience.  I can get a steak anywhere, but I can't feel comfortable and taken care of anywhere.  That's where Izzy's excels.  So much so, that I only go there when Phil or Nick are working (Nick just left sadly).  Make sure to get the Izzy's potatoes!  Best in the city.", "author": "D G."}

It took us prob 15 min to look for parking and later we found out that they validate for a parking lot on Webster for 1 1/2 hours. Not sure whether this is a dinner deal only; but a useful note for future yelpers.\n\nPrime ribs was excellent and of course, the Izzy potatoes - simply to die for.  Filet Au Poivre, it is tender and the creamy peppercorn sauce was a nice compliments. But I think the prime ribs was better. If compared to House of Prime Ribs, Izzy won that night for the prime ribs :p.  But to be honest, I would still go with HOPR, just because of the sides - special salad, the Yorkshire pudding, the whole nine yards. Maybe I am lame...\n\nWish that they have more sides to choose from though since I am not a \"creamed\" veggies fan.  Uh-huh, it would be perfect if they have a saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, oooh..... to go with my filet and the creamy, cheesy mashed/sliced potatoes.", "author": "Prascilla L."}

Well - I still love it. Had a great meal with a date before we attended the Jackson Browne concert.\nHad a reservation but arrived a little early so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine. Neat to overhear conversations of the locals, seriously kind of a \"Cheers\" atmosphere.\nWas seated at the front window table which I like as one can watch the happenings of the neighborhood.\nMy date had the salmon which she really liked and I do not even need to look at a menu - the marinated skirt steak is the best ever.

Water & bread/butter came right away & our waiter came by for drinks orders & asked if we wanted appetizers, which we passed on. He brought the drinks, which were very good & took our dinner order. Here's where food quality wasn't always consistent. Our waiter brought everything quickly, hot & correct the first time - thumbs up for him since previous reviews hint at inconsistent service. \n\nI had the NY steak medallions au poive. The steak was med as ordered & the sauce good (isn't everything with cream?), but not peppery at all. All orders come with 2 sides - baked potato was good, but then I loaded it the way I like. The carrots & onions - meh. Just blah, nothing special. Others has creamed spinach, which I don't like, and enjoyed it & Izzy's potatoes which they liked - again, anything tastes better with cream & cheese. One of our group had crab cakes instead of steak & he said they were good, and they were a good size (2 of them), but they looked too uniform & dark brown - not how I like my crab cakes, but he gave a thumbs up. \n\nBrought our own bottle of wine - $20 corkage which seems avg for SF. Didn't order dessert as we were too full from dinner. Total per person inc tax & tip was $55. Not sure that the value is there, but it was a nice change from Harris' or House of Prime Rib. \n\nMy recommendation, if you want to try it, is to go either earlier or later than the usual dinner rush. Service & food quality will be better (or it should since they're not rushed).", "author": "Barbara P."}

Flavorful, not too fatty and just the right portion.I ordered the most popular side dishes, izzy's potatoes and the creamed spinach. The potatoes were the most heavenly cream cheesy scalloped goodness I have ever experienced!!  As far as the creamed spinach, if your a fan of nutmeg you will enjoy it very much, but if your like me I thought the taste of nutmeg was a little overpowering.\nOur server Robin provided the best service you could ask for. Always on top of everything and suggested the key lime pie for dessert. OMG, the crust was buttery and graham crackery, the key lime filling was not too sour nor sweet and meringue topping was flambeed just perfectly.\n\nI hear they are now serving brunch and have delicious ramos fizzes which happen to be a fave o mine.

The spinach was creamed and very fatty; again it was more like a dessert item. I thought at least the broccoli would be dairy free, but even that tasted bizarrely dairy full.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-13", "description": "I've been here several times before and after reading some of these bad reviews, I'd like to set the record straight.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Izzy's for dinner last night. It was the end of a long, eventful day off work for the both of us and we had already had a few drinks and some food at Amelie. We had a reservation for 8pm, and had a drink at the bar while we waited about 5 min for our table. Once seated, we took our time looking over the menu and our waitress did not seem to mind at all. It was a very busy night and although she took notice that we already had drinks from the bar, she stayed very attentive to our glasses. After we ordered, I wondered if her demeanor would change once I told her we had a Groupon. Nope. She was sweet as pie and took the time to look over the menu to make sure we ordered accordingly. It took awhile to get our appetizers, and much longer to get our steaks, but our lovely waitress kept returning to apologize for the wait and to assure us it wouldn't be much longer. She also comped us our wine at the table for the wait, which we found to be a very nice gesture. The kind of thing that happens at a nice family establishment. By the time we had finished our meals, the waitress came back to see which dessert we would like to order. We were so stuffed and happy that we opted to skip dessert and asked for the bill. She insisted that since it was part of our deal that we should take it to go, and promptly brought out the creme brulee and the check. Actually, she brought two checks; one for the actual amount we would normally have spent without the Groupon and her hospitality, and one which read the whopping $3.64 that we actually owed. Needless to say, we left her an incredible tip. THIS is what service is all about.\n\nAs for the food...steaks well seasoned and cooked to the perfection of our choosing, creamed spinach was perfect as it always has been, scalloped potatoes were delicious, Cajun fried oysters were huge and the sauce was very complimentary,  and the tempting creme brulee is still in the fridge. In fact, I think I know what I'll be having for breakfast with my coffee!", "author": "Jessi N."}

They must have changed staff, although my friend said she recognized our server so unfortunately, this may not have been an isolated experience. I would hope no one else has ever been treated this way! Not sure what his name is but he is middle-aged, salt and pepper, white or Italian, or something, and apparently very bitter.\n\nWe went for drinks, just drinks, not dinner, at around 7:30 on a Tuesday. There was no room at the bar. We ask to sit at a small table near the front, the hostess (who was, in fairness, very nice and almost resembled the redhead on Mad Men to a T) tells us those tables are all reserved. So she takes us to a small table in the main restaurant area. \n\nWe wait 10 minutes before the server approaches us. Why? I couldn't tell you, the restaurant was empty (even the front, which was \"reserved\"). He brings bread and water. We are already annoyed after the 3 attempts it took to get seated in an empty restaurant and the wait ... then we order drinks. Correction, we *attempt* to order drinks.\n\nThe server man tells us we have to sit at the bar if we are only getting cocktails. We tell him the bar is full. He says we cannot sit in the restaurant if we are not ordering food. So what, our only option is to LEAVE the restaurant?! \n\nThis was the most outrageous thing that's ever happened to me at a restaurant. Both my friend and I had worked at restaurants in college, so we know the drill. This is not a rule at Izzy's... or ANYWHERE. \n\nI could understand his frustration if the restaurant was full and he could easily fill our spot with two hungry people who were going to be ordering course after course and drinks on top of it ... aka people who'd be leaving a nice, fat, tip. However, the place was just simply not going to fill up that night. It was empty. And regardless... you do not tell customers to leave, ever. Evidently he didn't pay attention in \"restaurant school\" when they tell you \"the customer is always right.\"\n\nMy friend is extremely offended at this point, so he says he will go \"check with the bar.\"\n\nAs soon as this ridiculous excuse for a server leaves, we picked up our purses and walked out... right past him... and the still fully occupied barstools. \n\nWhile I do think it's unfair to judge the entire restaurant on a man who quite possibly hates life because he is still doing this for a living while most men his age are nearing retirement, I do not have the option to judge the unnamed server so, I'm sorry Izzy, I will need to take the rating down to 1-star and suggest you staff some friendlier servers. Even on our bad days, my friend and I would smile at our customers. It's what you do if you want to make a good impression to keep those people coming back for more (and make tips!).

Nothing too crazy but it was a nice starter.\n\nWe then split the filet, medium rare and got the Izzys potatoes and creamed spinach as a side. The server was nice enough to split both the salads and entree on 2 seperate plates (bonus points). The filet came out a little on the \"too-rare\" side, almost looked seared but it tasted fabulous and I dont mind anything on the rare side.

The main reason that I went in was due to the fact that most of the restaurants in walking distance are tiny, are usually filled with people and have a 1+ hour wait. When I came in, I was relieved to see that only about half of the tables were filled. The waiter promptly gave me a comfortable seat in the second floor of the restaurant. The atmosphere was very nice and relaxed! And as for the menu, I was excited when I saw it - Potatoes, filets, prime rib, chicken piccata, and more! Gosh, I had the most difficult time deciding, and I ended up with the chicken piccata, french fries (weird, I know - but I'll eat french fries with anything), and steamed broccoli. It was delicious! The waiter was also spectacular, though I feel a bit guilty, as I don't think I asked for his name... All I can say is that he was extremely nice, had an entertaining personality, and he even gave me a recommendation for the Walt Disney museum at the Presidio after the meal!

All the steak sauce they offer are placed on shelves that wind throughout the restaurant.  Just pick up the sauce you like and you're good to go.  Here's my product plug:  I use A1 sauce and I use up practically the whole bottle every time I order a steak at restaurant. \"Yes, it's that important.\"   Also, Izzy's own potatoes is a nice hearty side to compliment their steaks\n\nSo, hankering for a good steak?

A bit cheaper, yes, but Harris' it was not.  \n\nThe decor is definitely fun with a mixture a woodsy steakhouse and San Francisco history.  For my entree I had a steak with the creamed spinach.  I like that you're able to choose your sides rather than be given only the potatoes option (though I do love me some potatoes). The spinach was decent in the way that most creamed spinach is.  My steak was also decent, in need of a little salt and definitely not the stuff dreams are made of a la Harris'.  My boyfriend's steak and potatoes fell into the same \"good but not great\" category.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was not in fact, the food, but the waitress hitting on me, much to my boyfriend's dismay.  For being distressingly not jealous about guys hitting on me, he has this funny secret fear about me switching teams...which, I went to Smith, the gayest college in the U.S. for a year, and if I didn't munch carpet then when I had ample opportunity, why would I go out of my way to do it now?  Anyhoo, the waitress was really cute and totally wanted my body and my bangs, and ignored my boyfriend altogether.  So the meal was kind of worth the small blow to the bf's ego and the rather large boost to mine.\n\nOverall, the food is decent, but not on the level of Harris', or from what I hear, Bobo's.  I would rather spend a little extra cash and have a fabulous steak eating out, or spend less and make my own at home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-04", "description": "Its with honest regret that I write this review about one of my favorite establishments (both the SF and SC locations).  I waited over night to see if possibly my view would change and it still has not (and I'm still pretty upset), so here I am.  \n\nI will start at by saying I am an Izzy's regular at their SC location since their opening...most of my family dinners, wedding rehearsal dinnners, birthday celebrations, work functions, etc. have been held here and will continue to be.  Heck, I know quite a bit of the staff by name and get greated with a hug by some.  When people ask \"Hey, what's a good steak house?\" , my response is always \"Izzy's...you've got to go!\"  I have also been going to the SF location for about 6 years now....loved both but I WILL NOT go back to the SF location after last night.  \n\nI would have made this a 5 star review but an event at the end of the meal COMPLETELY ruined the experience and I WILL NOT pay for a similar one again...especially with the way it was handled by the management.\n\nAfter craving their Filet Mignon Medallions Au Poivre all week and not having been out in quite a while with a crazy schedule, I was SO looking forward to this meal.  I had made a reservation for 4, which turned into 7, then 8 and finally 9 people...the staff was great in accommodating my ever increasing number of guests.  We arrived and were seated immediately in the upstairs, back dining room.  Our server was great!  She said she'd only been working there 2 days...would never have known it!  A couple of side dishes came out incorrectly but it was rectified immediately.  We had apps, dinner, 4 bottles of wine....just a great time all around.  The noise level was high since we were a large party and the group next to us was a 7 top, but hey, its Izzy's on a Saturday night and its a small room where the noise seems to echo (not my 1st time in this room, so I'm not shocked).  \n\nPartway through our meal, the last table in the room (4 top of guys) is sat.  We ask the waitress for our check and are in the midst of paying our bill when one of the guys at the 4 top decides he has had enough noise and starts banging on the table and yelling at the other large party to \"shut up\"!  I was shocked and couldn't believe what was happening...I'm in a steakhouse, right?!?!?  One of the girls from 7 top starts talking loudly back to him saying \"We are out having fun and talking.  What is your issue?  If you wanted a quiet dinner, Izzy's probably isn't the spot.\"  Yelling/loud talking go back and forth...the guy calls her a \"B@tch\" = her boyfriend is now involved and on and on.  \n\nSeriously!?!?!  I felt like I was back at the Giants parade with people fist fighting and name calling!  This isn't some dive bar and even then, the initiator of the verbal attack is in his late 30's or so...c'mon! Grow up!  We didn't just pay a $600 bill at a nice steakhouse to be in the middle of a verbal/fist fight.  How about talking to the wait staff/manager about the issue or saying \"Hey, guys, would you mind keeping it down a bit\"....we're adults and can talk to one another in a civil manner.   After a few minutes, I got up and left my table....I hate fighting and shouldn't have to listen to it nor be in the middle of it at a restaurant.  The 7 top finally got up and left about 5 minutes later.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the only staff that addressed the issue was the server who apologized to our group (per my husband since it was after I walked out).  No manager came in to deal with the situation, talk to the group, apologize, etc....this would have been the appropriate way to handle it.  One manager did approach me downstairs to ask what happened and say sorry.  And honestly, after working in this industry myself and knowing that you, as a manager, have the power to \"make things right\"  when they go array, take a meal or two off the bill, SOMETHING!  It costs the restaurant almost nothing, the customer knows you've tried to do something to rectify the situation and everyone goes away happy = the manager gets to be the hero (can you tell I've worked in Customer Service and Management for a while).  So, what did the management do you ask?  NOTHING = he never came into the room to talk to anyone or apologize and we walked away as angry patrons paying a full $600 bill.  What was a wonderful time and delicious meal was, for me, completely ruined by the last 10 minutes of the experience.  And as they say, bad customer service spreads like wildfire and here is my say. \n\nI love Izzy's and will still go to the SC one (in fact, I'll be going there for my birthday in about a week or so), but I'm not going back to the SF location which saddens me.  But I refuse to spend $70 for a meal where I need to worry about a fight breaking out while I'm having a nice dinner.  I am so sad to say this....but last night has left a nasty taste in my mouth and I am not a happy camper.  Sorry Izzy's....no more.", "author": "Jennifer R."}

The oysters or a Ceasar salad are the way to go for appetizers. \n\nOverall you can't go wrong with this choice and it beats paying $45 for a single piece of meat.", "author": "Jed N."}

And dinner at Izzy's is like having a meal at home with your friends. It's quickly become my BF's favorite place for a meat and potato kinda night. The menu is limiting to a few dishes of steak, chops, chicken and seafood, but for a limited menu they make each dish just right. I'd rather eat a place that specialize in what they do well then offer everything under the sun. Izzy's knows what they're doing.\n\nI've had the NY steak, filet mignon, and steak kabob, every time I ask for just medium and has never been disappointed. It's simple contemporary food, but definitely as that old tavern feel. Steaks and chops here are char grilled to a nice crisp on the outside, but still retain the tender juicy goodness of meat done right. My BF loves the lamb chops, they come out huge and usually bigger then your stomach anticipated. With the sides, I usually go with the Izzy's potato and fries, and the BF gets the scream spinach. Which I dip the fries into his cream spinach. The portions are huge, and can be shared between friends.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, just classic waiters and classic service. Oh and the fun part is the wall is lined with sauce of every variety you can think of, not like their steak needs it, but like every sauce from every country you can think of.

Previously we went to the House of Prime Rib on Van Ness and California, but that place was gotten to be too haughty.  Izzy's is much more friendly and their prices are also more reasonable.  Generally I order prime rib with a double order of spinach (trying to lay off carbs during the evenings).  My wife likes a variety of different items, sometimes ordering salmon, prime rib, or filet.  She usually has a side of Izzy's potatoes (quite rich and tasty) and steamed broccoli.  In general the food is excellent and so is the service and the food quantity is more than I can eat at one sitting..\n\nAn exception occurred in my last outing.  I am sure it was only an anomaly, but the spinach tasted sour and may have been old.  I ate there on a Monday evening, so it could have been Sunday's leftovers. The service was excellent, though maybe a little too much casual familarity.  The male receptionist seemed like he was doing us a favor allowing us to eat here. Parking is tough in this area, but if you go on a weekday close to 6 PM (when the meters are free) then parking is bearable. \n\nI would Izzy's 4.5 stars normally (if that is possible), but some quirks knocks it down to 4 stars.", "author": "Robert J."}

It's so great b/c you get a good, hearty steak and you don't have to dress up to go there!  Dress is super casual (unlike the nearby Harris's, Ruth's Chris or Prime Rib), wine selection is limited but decent...  Service has been consistently good (but maybe it's b/c my bf and I go there so often they recognize that we know the menu backwards and forwards...) so they know they can take our order really quickly.\n\nSteak is always cooked well (neither bf or I have ever had to send a steak back b/c it was either under or over-cooked).  For sides, \"Izzy's own\" and the creamed spinach are my staples - both are so wonderfully rich and tasty - but far from heart healthy...  But admittedly, you never go to a steakhouse when you're on a diet.  So make sure u indulge in these two great sides.  \n\nThe steak can be a little tasteless - so if you get something without seasoning, add your own salt and pepper or choose to use one of the many steak sauces that line the wall...  I've had the fillet medallions (they come with this amazing cream, peppercorn, brandy sauce!  yum!), the steak kabobs (also very good, comes with mushrooms), the cajun seasoned steak (not my favorite), and the fillet.  When I want \"smaller portions\" (I've still never managed to finish my entire plate) - I get the fillet.  If I want something that isn't strictly steak, I'll get the kabobs.  My bf always always always gets the fillet medallions (we go there specifically so he can have them).  \n\nPrices are pretty good - almost everything is under $30 (that includes steak and two sides) - huge portions!  Wine is about $7-$10 for a glass.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

But wait till I get started about the food here. \n\nI tried the swordfish dish and I would have to say its ok. It did not taste great!, but it tasted good. \n\nIve also tried the lamb shank; it was also ok, but the one I eat was a little over cooked on one side. And again, it was not great!, but tasted good. \n\nNow for the prime rib! It tasted great!!! It would have to say this prime rib is so much better than 'House of Prime Rib' and many other places. It was tender and juicy!! \n\nThe sides are really delicious also! The yummy cream spinach and their Izzy's specialty smash potatoes! \n\nThe service is ok... sometimes It takes them a while to refill water and bread. \n\nThe pricing on the food is reasonable.", "author": "Jannifer H."}

YUM. .....and one for our lucky nearby parking spot.\r\n\r\nThe options here for steaks weren't very plentiful. A new york, filet, skirt steak and hamburger (wtf?) steak - with au poive and cajun options for a couple. A veal T-bone, prime rib, a pork chop and a lamb chop. Hmmmm....nothing really sounded that great, but I went with the new york - where were the porterhouses, and rib eyes? \r\n\r\nThere were also some non red meat options, crab cakes, and some fish, even chicken breast and Caesar salad. \r\n\r\nThe fried calamari starter was good. Real cocktail sauce - with fresh grated horseradish was nice.\r\n\r\nThe fried oysters were also good. Crunchy coating with a yummy pesto-like dipping sauce. \r\n\r\nThe new york strip was pretty thick and cooked correctly, but was very 'meaty'. It seemed to lack any seasoning at all - just tasted like grilled meat. There were tons of bottled sauces around the table, but I don't feel like I should have to put A-1 or 57 Sauce on my steak to make it taste good, it should come out of the kitchen tasting good. I just put a bunch of salt and pepper on it to make it better. \r\n\r\nThe Izzy's potatoes were excellent. Scalloped and creamy and cheesy. YUM. \r\n\r\nThe creamed spinach was also really good. Perfectly creamy with small bits of onions mixed in. \r\n\r\nThe baked potato was fine, and came with sour cream and chives on the side. I'd skip it next time and order the Izzy's potatoes instead. \r\n\r\nThe veal T-bone was also 'meaty'. Cooked well, not dry at all, but lacked any sort of flavoring other than veal. Not a bit salted. \r\n\r\nThe prime rib was really large. The slab of meat was slightly over-done for med-rare. Au jus did not come with it, but was brought out when asked. Not as good as House of Prime Rib. Would've been better if it was less than 2 in. thick. \r\n\r\nThe filet au poive was ok. Two small filets weren't finished by a hungry guy. \r\n\r\nWe didn't try dessert, but by 10:30, they had ran out of half of them anyway. \r\n\r\nI probably wouldn't go back, but it was worth trying once. I would only want to order the sides, and skip the steak.\r\n\r\nThe place is pretty outdated and casual. Jeans and a t-shirt would not be out of place here. I expected nicer for a steak house. However, the prices were pretty reasonable and the steaks included two sides.", "author": "kristen b."}

Basic, tasty, just what you expect.\n\nFor dinner, you get a good steak and two sides for about $25.  The meat is not quite the level of someplace like Harris', but at less than half the price for steak+sides, it's really an incredible value by comparison.  They also have other meat options for less than $20 which I haven't tried but I bet are really good as well.\n\nI have had a few of the steaks, but usually get the new york au poivre.  The prime rib is also good, but usually for that I just head to HOPR.  \n\nI always get the Izzy's potatoes, which are au gratin or scalloped or whatever you're supposed to call them.  Rich and delicious.

It was supposedly known as one of the premier steak places in San Francisco, and maybe it still is, I'm not an expert.  I'm not a huge steak person and I don't order it rare (which offends many true steak lovers...I guess I'm just not so into bloody pieces of meat)\n\nThis place has been around for a while, and whether it is a real or fake decor, it has that feel.\n\nI'd say most of my experiences here have been 4 star worthy.  The steak is good, and the sides are solid...Izzy's potatoes are obviously horrible for you, but worth getting anyway.  The service is normally quality service.\n\nSo why not 4 stars?  Because one of the times I went here recently the service was pretty good and they did a horrible job cooking the steak.  I think a steak was ordered medium and they brought a quite rare piece of meat.  Again, maybe a true steak eater doesn't order a steak medium, but a true restaurant prepares it how requested.  When sent back for additional cooking, it came out still pretty rare...it wasn't even worth dealing with any more.", "author": "Brett J."}

Someone suggested Izzy's. No game but excellent steak.\n\nThe service was excellent, the prices were about $10 less than Mortons and included 2 sides (which are extra at most steak houses). The booze was great as were the prices on the wine list. The steak was not the best I've ever had but it was excellent. I ordered it rare and occasionally that means it barely gets cooked at all. This was cooked just right. The baked potato had a lot ot flavor, but wasn't crispy like I prefer it. Also, the fixins' selection was pretty limited (sour cream and chives).\n\nIt is in the Marina, which I know I don't have good reason to visit at any time. So, it was certainly out of the way for me.

New York Strip was nothing out of the ordinary, Primed rib was decent (Not House of P status), and the bone-in rib-eye was, \"has no taste\". One other side that I would say that was good is the onions and carrots. The carrots is super soft and sweet.\n\nService:  We were seated upstairs and accommodated our reservations promptly. We had a party of 6+ meaning that gratuity was included in our tab. Therefore, the waiter took advantage on not having to servicing us as well. He never checked in to see if everything was okay.

I understand that other yelpers love the place because it's a great steakhouse that doesn't require one to be super dressy.  However, I personally hate spending a lot of money on a meal to  have other patrons dressed in sweats!  I personally think there should be a dress code.  I mean, it's not much cheaper than swankier steak joints. \n\nIf you're seated upstairs make sure to check if you're under an air vent.  We were fine when we first sat and then five minutes later the air came on full blast.  I was so cold for the rest of the meal and my steak was cold within 2 minutes from the air blowing on it.  The waitress said it was on automatic and couldn't be turned off, that was a real bummer. \n\nCocktails: my fiance and I each got a dirty kettle one martini which were awesome!  It's amazing how many restaurant in SF screw up a dirty martini, but these were great. \n\nAppetizers: nothing on the appetizer menu really called out to me so we decided to try something new: fried oysters.  I love oysters on the half-shell, but this was not for me.  It was heavily fried (not light and flakey) and the oyster was basically raw inside.  For some reason I envisioned it being a bit more cooked.  My fiance thought they were okay, but I think we're just not fans of fried oysters. \n\nI had a bone-in ribeye that was cooked a perfect medium-rare.  The funny thing is that I actually like my steak rare-to-medium-rare, but in my experience most fancy steakhouses always slightly undercook, e.g., The Prime Rib in DC.  Although I could have used the steak a little bloodier it was very tasty. \n\nMy fiance had the filet mignon medallions in a pepper sauce.  I like filet mignon alright but I never order it b/c I always think it lacks flavor.  However, I was not a fan of the pepper sauce at all.  What's important though is that fiance thought it was great. \n\nSides: The Izzy's potatoes and creamed spinach were awesome!  I found the portions to be a little small and left me wanting more.  Do not plan on splitting the sides with anyone. \n\n\nWine: They had a good wine list with a variety of prices.  The waitress recommended a $56 bottle of Cab and it was so delicious!  \n\nCheesecake: it was a good standard cheesecake, nothing revolutionary.  \n\nService: very, very good.  Our waitress was really nice and helpful.  My only complaint is that she brought out our dessert and coffee when we still had very full glasses of wine to drink.  We sat there for 10 minutes trying to finish the wine while our coffee got cold and our cheesecake started to melt.\n\nBill: $175, not including tip.", "author": "Katie S."}

I ignored the bad reviews I had read and thought how bad could it really be.  Well it turns out very. \n\nThis is how our evening transpired:\n1. We arrive for our 7.00pm reservation time to find out they didnt have any record of our reservation, despite confirming on the phone to me when I made the booking.  30 minutes later and with 2 toddlers in our party we were seated.\n2. Approx 30 minutes after sitting down we finally got a waitress to take our order. hhmmm not off to a good start.\n3. Ok so it happened to be the hottest day of the year and for some reason Izzys didnt have anything called air conditioning or if they did they didnt know how to turn it on.  It was a complete sweatbox - especially upstairs where we were seated.  It was abit like a Sweat Lodge. Right at the end of our meal when half of the restaurant guest had cleared out, one of the brilliant waiters decided it just might be a good idea to turn the fans on. The entire restaurant burst in to applause at this point. Not sure why they hadnt thought of this earlier.  It was so hot that we looked forward to the rare occasions that the waitresses made an appearance as they there would be a shot of cool air coming out of the kitchen as they entered the dining space.  \n4. At least 30 minutes after we ordered we checked on our food. Asked the waitress if the restaurant was backed up. she answered no and that would our meal would be out shortly.  It is now 8.30 and with two toddlers who were really starting to wane about then it wasnt looking good for us.  Eventually the meal came. \n\nI will give them credit the skirt steak I ordered was delicious but the medium prime rib my friend ordered was practically mooing.  A bloody mess. Also it turns out that this can be ordered as two different cuts, something the waitress forgot to mention to us. Hers was the size of a cow.  The only upside was that because it was so raw she could quite easily take it home, put it on her bbq to reheat and not risk it drying out. \n\n5. The bill. Our bill was about $160 for 4 but when our 2 credit card slips arrived which were to be split down the middle we noticed  they had charged $240 to each of two cards we gave them. Now you dont have to be a mathematician to figure out something was wrong here.  Another 30 minutes later and an eventual visit from the manager they removed about 10 items from our bill that were never part of our order and did give us a discount for compensation for all the mess ups.  \nI still have no idea whose bill we got and what happened to our original bill.\n\nOK it was fathers day weekend and the US Open but please.... nothing excuses such bad service. I hope something improves at this place. It used to be a neighborhood gem.  \n\nWill I be back? Probably not. \n\nRecommendations - if you still want to go, dont choose a busy night. They clearly do not know how to manage a kitchen to deal with a relatively full restaurant.\nReconfirm your booking several times.\nAllow several hours to get your food.\nOrder the skirt steak.\n\nOverall: A very memorable birthday for my husband for all the wrong reasons.", "author": "Jill B."}

Izzy's is the place where my sister and I go on birthdays and every time I'm feeling under the weather and feel like I need a good steak dinner to get me feeling strong again.  The decor is nice, the prices are very reasonable for very tasty steak and sides.  I always get the steak kebab with broccoli and Izzy's potatoes (they are scallop potatoes au gratin).  The reason I must give a three is the service.  Every time we go, reservations or no, I feel that we are treated poorly.  We aren't even picky people.  We just feel like we are being ignored.

The Marina is not really my scene. The decor reminds me more of a pub than a restaurant. The fillet I ordered was cooked to order and pretty tasty, but the sides left something to be desired. Nothing particularly good or bad about the experience. About $85 for two (no dessert nor wine and only 1 mixed drink). Just not a good value in my book. I'd rather pay a bit more and have an overall better experience or pay less and keep the money in my pocket.

I absolutely LOVE Izzy's and that is why this visit to the SF Izzy's was so disappointing.  My family took my dad there for Father's Day.  We had reservations and showed up a little early, but they quickly accommodated our party.  We sat upstairs, which was tastefully decorated and quiet.  (There was only one other family up there when we sat down.)  The wine was fabulous, as usual.  While we were waiting for our food I noticed something tickling my foot.  It was a mouse!  As I shook my foot the mouse scurried across the floor and hid on the other side of the room.  Minutes later it was running around the floor again.  I was horrified, as was my entire family.  We discretely notified the waiter, who apologized very nonchalantly and that was that.  Throughout our entire meal the mouse was running around the floor and I did not feel that the issue was appropriately addressed.  They continued seating people upstairs and did not offer to comp our drinks/food/anything.  Although the food was good, seeing a mouse run around during dinner made the food significantly less appetizing.  In addition, we had to wait FOREVER for our bill.  We waited close to 20 minutes for our bill and finally had to go downstairs and ask for it.

The food was generally very good, especially for the price which seemed extremely reasonable.  While the food and traditional old-fashioned steakhouse atmosphere should warrant this place 4-5 stars, the terrible service should chime in at 1 star, so I'll call it fair at 3.  The hostess and the busboy were by far the most pleasant people we dealt with, and they each said about 2 sentences or less.  While we waited for our table, the bar tender almost completely ignored us, and was generally in a sour mood.  The waitress started out strong, but it quickly became apparent that she had no desire or will to be there, at least not that night.  She rarely stopped by, and our order was always a bit off, missing a lemon, a side of potato's, or more bread.  The place was most certainly not busy enough for her visits to be so few and far between, or for the orders to be continuously off.\n\nWhile we will return for their fantastic steaks and potatoes, we'll be sure to make it a Monday or Tuesday night event when our service expectations are lower.", "author": "Dennis Q."}

All the entrees here come with their choice of two sides, and the two that keep folks coming back for more are Izzy's Own Potatoes (essentially and au gratin preparation) and creamed spinach.  \n\nThis evening I selected the filet au poivre - the menu does not list it (it has a filet, and then there are filet medallions au poivre) but they're more than happy to do it for you.  I ordered medium rare and it came medium rare, and the sides were delicious as always.  \n\nIt should be noted that one of Izzy's huge benefits is the price.  At $28 or so for an entree with two sides it's an eminently affordable steakhouse.  The steak is not as good as Harris or Bobo's, but you're also paying half the price, plus you get two sides which are extra at the other places.  All in, bang for the buck.

We arrived around 7:30pm on Saturday night with no reservations. They said it was about a 1/2 hour wait. After about 40 minutes, we were seat very close to the front door (and bar, unfortunately because the people around the bar are VERY loud).\n\nIn short, the food was above average. The service was close to failing. I felt very rushed. Literally the only words the waitress said to us the whole night were, \"Hi, how are you?\", \"Anything to drink?\", and about 3 minutes later, \"Are you ready to order?\". Nothing else for the rest of the night. Didn't bother to check on us, either until the end.\n\nWe were literally thrown our plates on our table, by another server, or chef (unsure, but they were wearing white), and said nothing. I got the aged NY strip. It was good. Not a good cut though. I'm a butcher, so I know a good cut of steak from a bad one. This one had so much fat/gristle it in. Probably about a a quarter of the steak was inedible (literally unable to chew the pieces of gristle),. That didn't both me too much. The creamed spinach was good. (which in fact must be excellent since I really don't like spinach at all). The potatoes were excellent. My gf had the fillet mignon, she liked it. She also had the steamed broccoli and potatoes. They were both very tasty.\n\nI give 3 stars because the service was 1 star, but most of the food was 4 stars. If I were asked about Izzy's by a friend, I would flat say, \"Great food, not so great service\". \n\nPros: Food, nice decor on walls\nCons: Service, loudness\n\nOne more thing. When I used the restroom, an employee (a chef or server) used the restroom, came out of the stall, splashed some water on his hands, and left. No soap, no towel or any sanitation whatsoever. They better be careful so someone doesn't get sick. \n\nI will try again on a less busy night, just to see if it was the busyness that gave my gf and I a bad first time there.", "author": "Mark K."}

What more could you ask for?  A rare combination where everything fits.

Unfortunately, Izzy's was a great disappointment, and really needs some updating and refining.\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and were seated immediatly.  Sadly, she seated us in the section of the 'Worlds Most Bitter Waiter'.  All I had to do to set him off was to ask in a fun, friendly voice for his recommendation on a cocktail.  He looked angry as if he didn't understand the question.  It was clear to me that he did understand, but that I hadn't asked in a way that HE approved of.  He went on to inform me that he could recommend a liquor brand, but that asking for a cocktail recommendation was just not acceptable to him.  His tone was condescending.....  wow.....We had literally just sat down.  \n\nSometimes businesses will retain people like this when they just don't have the energy to care anymore.    We considered walking out, but we were hungry and had a movie to catch.\n\nMy steak was done medium rare as requested, but was served with the fries and watery vegetable side dish all on the same plate-the result being that the tasteless fries soaked up the vegetable juice-not too tasty.\n\nIf you are looking for top notch steak in a classic steakhouse atmosphere, take the extra 5 minutes, and try to get in to Harris' on Van Ness...it's not that far from Izzy's.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-07-06", "description": "As the name suggests, steaks and chops are the order of the day. The well-priced entree servings are large enough to warrant skipping appetizers, although on occasion we have succumbed to an order of roasted mussels or a chopped Caesar salad, with buttery croutons and a garlicky anchovy-infused dressing. The garlic cheese bread is also worth the investment. I've eaten here often enough that I've sampled most of the steak options, and I've never been disappointed with any of my selections. A word of advice - the kitchen tends to give the meat more fire than required for your preference, so if you order it rare you'll get the medium-rare you want. Prime rib lovers should be aware that it's served on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday only, and in limited quantity, so get there early to avoid disappointment. For non-meat eaters, there are a few seafood and chicken selections, but let's face it - why go to Izzy's if you're not looking for a slab of beef? Entrees are served with a choice of two sides. Dieters can opt for roasted onions and carrots or steamed broccoli, but if you're willing to forego the calorie, carb, and cholesterol count for the night, then try the house specialties - creamed spinach and Izzy's potatoes, an au gratin style preparation that's sensationally rich and sinfully delicious. On the weekends in particular, reservations are often meaningless - it's not unusual to wait 45 minutes to an hour past your scheduled time for a table. Service can be maddeningly slow, not surprising in a place where most dishes are prepared to order. Still, after a long wait to be seated, it becomes frustrating when a lot more time passes before a server puts in an appearance, or is trapped in the kitchen when you need more bread or a refill of drinks.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

While waiting for the appetizers and main dishes, I took the time to supplement the bowdlerised, 25-cent biography of Izzy Gomez featured on the menu with old newspaper clippings on the wall about him from during his lifetime. Although his generosity to starving artists by giving them free drinks and meals in exchange for artwork, as well as his place being the inspiration for William Soroyan's play The Time of Your Life was duly mentioned in the menu-bio, what wasn't mentioned was his Prohibition-era stint in jail for bootlegging (as if that was a big surprise), or that his place was sometimes attracted a violent element, as noted in an article about a shooting that took place there. While I was eating my meal, I was wondering if the poor Portuguese immigrant would approve of the current Bay Area mini-chain started in 1987 (three as of this posting) that was built around his name, long after his original place downtown on Montgomery Street was demolished in 1952, and of the mostly upscale crowd from the Marina that would probably be incongrous with the regular elements of the original dive.  As for my meal, the appetizer of calamari and the sides of creamed spinach and Izzy's Own Potatoes (aka au gratin) were OK. However, I was a bit disappointed with my the generic steak fries that the person seated next to me had; it looked as though it had just come out of a bag. I opted for a blackened hamburger steak, medium rare, which was actually seasoned quite nicely. Considering the size of the crowd, the service was quick and courteous.

The crowd was great, the company was awesome, but the food was to my distaste. Since Ive never been to Izzy's, I asked a friend for her recommendation as well as the waitress's, both offered the prime rib. And so, I ordered the prime rib with 2 sides, the creamy spinach and Izzy's Potatoes. When I got my meal, the slab on there was really big and so for the price, I thought it was a good deal. BUT, when I cut into my steak, I found it tough and very hard to cut. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and blamed the steak knife, but I tired using 2 others, and I still got the same result. I barely ate it because I couldnt even cut it. It was tough and very chewy. The spinach and potatoes were mediocre. Oh, and top it off, they told us to hurry because they  had another large party waiting to be seated. Their food is just like their customer service, bland and nasty.", "author": "Jenn V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-22", "description": "Had been coming here regularly since the early '90s.  A steakhouse with no soup?  Funny story that I once heard is that the reason there is no soup on the menu is because there were these little 'ol ladies that would come in and order nothing, but soup.  Apparently the owner got mad and the place hasn't had soup on the menu since.  Anyway, although the place still has a following, I no longer go there.  This used to be one of my favorite steakhouses in SF, especially for the price, but over the past decade and a half, the food quality has progressively gotten worse and worse.  My faves are still on the menu and the cheesy potatoes known as \"Izzy's own potatoes\" is still good.  However, my former favorite, the Filet Mignon Au Poivre s#cks.  The peppercorn sauce is now too milky with no real flavor.  What was once legendary is now so bad, so mediocre that I found myself dousing it with gobs of Lea & Perrins, just to make the steak edible.  On top of that, the meat is consistently over or undercooked.  Back in the day, it was always exactly as you ordered it.  Now these are valid reasons not to go there anymore, but per another Yelper's review, I looked up the Examiner article dated June 9th, 2008 and Izzy's really did get one of the lowest SF restaurant health scorecard scores ever, a 42 out of 100!  Yikes.  I once met someone in a bar that used to work at Izzy's and they agreed about the quality and told me that the owner no longer cares and will hire anybody, just to get the cooking done.  Not sure if that's true, but I've been disappointed enough.", "author": "Roy N."}

I was wrong. Why did I think I would have a better experience???  \n\nHere it goes: We ordered a Filet Mignon (Medium), NY Strip (Medium), and a Cheeseburger. When they brought our food out they brought out two NY Strip steaks and a cheeseburger.  We let them know right away that we had ordered the Filet so the waiter quickly acknowledged it. He clearly told my fiancee \"I will buy you this meal and bring you your Filet in 15 minutes so you will have something to eat while everyone else eats.\" She clarified to make sure she will still get her Filet. We thought wow a free steak, well that was a nice gesture. However, when we cut into the steak it was well done and one of the toughest steaks she or I have ever had. I would have been very unsatisfied if I paid for it, but since it was free we didn't bother to say much. After 20 minutes of waiting we asked our waiter when the Filet was coming. He said it was not and that he communicated to us that he gave us this steak instead and it would be free. We all three were in shock because we had clarified that we were going to get the Filet in 15 minutes. He ended up saying well I guess I am just a bad communicator. \n\nAs for the food, the medium steak was tough too and the cheeseburger lacked flavor. And because of the service we will never go back. I would strongly urge you to go somewhere else if you have not been there in a while because it was completely different from our last experiences (that were over a year ago).

(So, no, I did not choose to eat here)  I was wary after I read some of the reviews on Yelp.  I was STARVING after a day of shopping downtown, so I was excited to come and eat some BEEEEEEF (my favorite meat) for dinner!  I got the new york steak  Au Poivre (with cracked pepper, cream & brandy).  Oh wait, let me rephrase that.  I ordered the New York Steak.  Medium Rare.  When I got the steak, it was closer to medium (not even bloody or that red inside), very very chewy, and SUPER DRY DRY DRY DRY DRY.  I had to put a lot of salt on that steak to get any flavor out of it and I also ordered the Au Poivre sauce on the side.  Yes, the steak was so dry I had to upgrade to the Au Poivre. (It was funny because my server was like I KNEW you'd want that sauce on the side..I guess she thought that since a few of my friends got their steak that way, I felt left out or something.  But she was wrong, I told her it was because my meat was SO dry!)  Haha.  Sadly, the sauce didn't help.  My friend that ordered the NY Steak Au Poivre had to dip her steak in my extra side sauce, since her steak was SUPER DRY and tough.  I did like the creamed spinach and Izzy's new potatoes (kinda like a chunky mashed potatoes au gratin), as well as the strawberries with cream and grand marnier dessert.  That's why I gave this place 2 stars.  For those items alone.   Someone mentioned this place was good if you wanted to go somewhere cheaper than House of Prime Rib.  Shoot, I would have paid the extra $5 for an order of the City Cut prime rib at HOPR, or even $8 for the House of Prime Rib cut!  HOPR is WAY more worth it (you can even get seconds if you get the house of prime rib cut or bigger).  Their prime rib is cooked the way it should be...if I ordered medium rare, it's medium rare.  You get a delicious salad, hot bread, yorkshire pudding, the meat, and two sides.  I digress.  I left Izzy's not feeling super full like I usually do when I have HOPR and sad that my steak was so gross.  IF YOU ARE A STEAK HOUSE YOU BETTER LIVE UP TO YOUR NAME!  Anyway, don't go to Izzy's, you'll be sad and disappointed like me.  Oh, unless if you like really tough, dry overpriced beef.", "author": "Cheryl L."}

Our meat came out looking the same.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-02", "description": "I'm giving it three stars out the kindness of my heart. If I had it my way I'd give it two and a half because that's as average as it can get, which is basically what Izzy's is. \n\nActually, the more I think about it, the less satisfied I am with my meal. I will give it to all you Izzy's lovers out there that yes it is a casual place, and yes, it is less expensive, and yes the sides are very good, but when it comes down to it, if I'm going to have a big piece of meat, and especially if I'm going to have it at a steak house, it better be pretty damn good. And that is where Izzy's just doesn't deliver. \n\nBefore going I read more than few mixed reviews, most of which told me to order the Izzy's potatoes and the creamed spinach. So I did. I will say that I was not at all disappointed by either of the sides. The spinach was creamy and cheesey yet held up nicely so I didn't feel like I should be eating it with a spoon. Potatoes were cheesey and tasty as well and had a nice consistancy somewhere between mashed and baked potatoes. \n\nUnfortunately, my cut of prime rib didn't match up to my sides. Being my first visit to Izzy's, I ordered the prime rib so I could see how it stacked up against House of Prime Rib and other places that I regularly order it. I'm all for a thick cut of meat but this was just too thick. Rather than being medium rare like I ordered it was just medium, which really does not lend itself to thick cuts of meat. Even having read all the reviews that forewarned me of overcooked meat and going into it with few expectations, I was still somewhat disappointed. The meat was no where near as tender or as juicy as I would've liked and lacked flavor towards the middle of the cut. The horseradish did nothing to compliment the meat either. I would definitely say that if you want to have a good cut of prime rib, House of Prime Rib--or really almost anywhere else--is a better bet. I'd even go so far as to say that $6 prime rib dinners in Vegas have offered up better prepared cuts of meat. The side dishes might be better at Izzy's but for a steak house, the meat should be what matters most. \n\nI will definitely give Izzy's style points for maintaing that old school steak house feel and for not being too posh (or really posh at all). It's a relaxed kind of place where jeans and tshirts are fine. The prices are reasonable for such large cuts of meats and the appetizers are even borderline cheap. The fried calamari was really good, as was the cockatail sauce it came with and worth its $8 price tag. It's worth noting that the leftover prime rib was actually better than the first time.. Take that as you will... \n\nI'm glad I tried Izzy's and tried the sides and got it out of my system. If they served better quality meat it's definitely the kind of place I might frequent, but for now I'd rather spend a little more money or go a little further for a satisfying cut of meat.", "author": "Freesia R."}
