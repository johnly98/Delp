{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-05", "description": "I've only gone to Il Canto repeatedly for their breakfast burritos because they are the best I've found in the FiDi. Generously loaded and perfectly crisp thanks to their choice to grill it panini style. Smart decision. Love the ladies that work there. All of them are very sweet. I've had their dark cherry mocha and rocky road mocha, but I wasn't impressed. The flavors were not distinct and could have been named anything else and it wouldn't make a difference one iota. \n\nIf you can't decide over ham, bacon, or sausage, they have a meat lover burrito that cannot be rivaled. Again, huge portions. Now you have the option to get chipotle sauce and add avocado or leave it with just the sriracha. I've tried them both, and while there's nothing wrong with the flavor of the chipotle sauce (and obviously avocado), it becomes way too liquidy. I recommend it as-is so your taste buds can absorb all the meaty-cheesy goodness. \n\nTheir sandwiches on display look delicious. I haven't gone there for lunch yet, but if I do I imagine they'll be just as tasty as their breakfast is. I hope to update this review someday testifying so.", "author": "Nick J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-17", "description": "Il Canto Cafe is a small independent sandwich shop that I've passed by many times when going to Sapphire Asian cuisine which is next door. I decided to finally give it a try a couple of weeks ago. Being a small place it was packed during my first visit. The menu is simple a bunch of panini's, salads and some ready-made pasta. I decided to get the Chipotle chicken panini ($8) which as per the menu is chipotle sauce, jack cheese, chicken, spinach, tomatoes on a ciabatta roll. To my surprise it also came with a side salad. After ordering it was a short 10 minute wait and I was on my way.\n\nThe size of sandwiches in FiDi is really disappointing so I was pleasantly surprised to see a large panini. Unfortunately it had 2 problems. First, the contents were not thawed out properly before being toasted so all the chicken tasted like a cold hard lump. I understand that you have to freeze the sandwiches to avoid a Chipotle type of situation but you have to thaw them out correctly before toasting them. I had to let the sandwich sit for about 20 minutes to get the contents to proper room temperature but that made the sandwich soggy. The second issue was the panini was over toasted. It was in the press for a couple of minutes more than it should have been making the bread extremely crispy. Overall this was not a good panini.\n\nObviously I was not very impressed with my first visit so I was in no hurry to return. I decided to give them another try a couple of days ago. This time they were not that full. I decided to get the chicken breast panini ($8) which as per the menu is pesto, chicken breast, spinach, tomatoes, provolone cheese on focaccia bread. This time I observed process a little closely. The sandwich was first microwaved to thaw it out and then toasted in a panini press. I'm not sure if they removed the plastic cover before microwaving so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. This time the panini was much better. It was thawed correctly and toasted right and tasted pretty good.\n\nPrice wise it is cheap for the area where full sized panini's are in the $12 range when paired with a salad. Consistency in quality is lacking. I think they have potential but need to fine-tune their process a little more. Competition in this area is intense (there are 30+ sandwich shops in a 1 mile radius in downtown) so when benchmarked against other independent sandwich shops like Front Door Cafe, Good Luck Cafe, Chez Julien etc. they do need to take a step to catch-up. Generous 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 is how I'd rate this place.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Or the Warriors won the championship, but I have to work instead of going to the parade, and I feel the need to drown my sorrows in chipotle sauce.

If I did, I'd never get through the day.\n\nBack to the breakfast burritos: this is my go-to morning comfort food. They're rich, cheesy, saucy, all that good stuff. The price is as good as it gets in the FiDi, and Sandy and her staff are welcoming and friendly, even when there is a line out the door.

I was surprised because the 2 employees were just making sandwiches minding their own business and this woman was belittling them in front of the customers, making fun of them for not knowing July 4 was a holiday. I stood there for well over a minute listening to this woman. I don't know if she's the manager or owner??? Certainly no way to treat employees. Finally she came to take my order- I told her what I wanted and she stormed out without saying anything to me. It was really bizarre. Again I waited for 30 seconds, and she didn't come back, so I left. On my wait out, another customer commented about the woman's yelling. So I won't be going back.

I adore this place so much that I waited on writing my review out of fear that they will become too busy to continue to be my go-to spot.\n\nI work in the Wealth Management division in a member-owned company.  The fact that our division consists of clients that have a high net worth yet also have a personal interest in our company's success creates a strange dichotomy in that our members are accustomed to finer things but, because they have a stake in our business, want us to pull it off on a shoestring budget.  Il Canto Cafe has become a go-to spot in helping pull this off.\n\nWe have used their paninis in our seminars, asking that they cut the sandwiches in quarters rather than halves.  We then throw the sandwiches on top of a tray of the free side salad that comes with the sandwich and, voila!, we have a gorgeous party tray.  The sandwiches are so huge that cutting it in quarters allows for more people to share in the sandwich but does not make anyone feel without.  And I can honestly tell you that, after every seminar, we ALWAYS have at least 1-2 members compliment the sandwiches and ask us where they can buy it.\n\nIn addition to our seminars, we use them for our employee appreciation lunches (which we also have a VERY small budget for).  It's normally hard for me to find a restaurant that pleases everyones' individual tastes but I have found that this place has something for everyone.  And, because it is so affordable, I don't have to do special steps to stretch the budget -- I just distribute the menu, ask each employee to choose ONE item from it, and call/email Sandy (the owner) with my order.  \n\nAND, when coworkers visit our office from other cities, we ALWAYS recommend this place as a good nearby lunch option.  I have only received compliments about this place and have yet to receive a complaint.  \n\nNow, the drawback is that it is a very small restaurant with only 1-2 people working it.  So they are not able to easily accomodate last minute large orders or special requests.  I therefore make sure that I always notify Sandy (the owner) at least a day in advance when making a special request or a ordering multiple paninis.  And, with this system, they have never let me down.", "author": "Linda H."}

As most other reviews have mentioned, the lady who owns the place is really nice. Its a tiny cafe but very welcoming. However, what got me to write this review was the breakfast burrito. It could only be described as one of the top 3 breakfast burritos i've ever had (despite the fact that it was veggie). They do have one with sausage, but since I don't eat pork i went for veggie. Once its all said and done they grill your b-fast burrito for a little crunch. It was amazing. The only thing is if they could add some sort of porkless sausage (like chicken apple, etc) for the non pork eaters that would be great. \n\nAgain, if your office is anywhere near this spot, do yourself a favor and get the b-fast burrito.

No potatoes or hashbrowns in this one, but it was still good.

Overall still great.\n\nSpicy Turkey Panini:\n\nPretty solid sandwich.  Took a lil bit to cook but it was delicious when it was done.  A tad juicy because of a cheese/sauce/mayo situation.  Only dig here is that all sandwiches are premade and they just pop your panini on the grill.

I am SO GLAD I took a chance. This is a true FiDi hidden gem.\n I got a Cobb salad, expecting to be handed a tub of dressing to go with my plastic clamshell and sent on my way. Instead, they sliced the egg and tossed my salad with my dressing of choice- a smidge of jalape\u00f1o ranch- and returned it to the container. For about 7 bucks, I had a massive salad (lunch and dinner for today) plus a nice crusty roll with butter. \nThe salad was fresh (and did I mention massive?) and whoever tossed it listened when I said not too much dressing. They even asked if I wanted a combo of dressings, which piqued my interest. The bacon was crispy and savory, the chicken was properly cooked (neither dry nor tough) and the balance of ingredients (romaine, egg, chicken, bacon, carrots, tomatoes, olives, and blue cheese crumbles) left me feeling I got my $'s worth. \nThey were making a LOT of paninis, which makes me suspect those a popular. There is some seating around the corner outside and a few tables inside. The food and convenience are definitely the selling points here, as a random street smell outside (thanks SF) prompted me to eat back at my desk. \nThe owner, Sandy, is always there. Her family had coffee shops Italy, and her mom ran a successful one in the US. I will definitely be back to try the Nutella mocha!", "author": "Gail W."}
