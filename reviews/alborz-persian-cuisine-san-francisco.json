We came for lunch and had the Ghormeh Sabzi (served elegantly with lamb on the bone) along with the combination platter (Dolma, kashk bodemjan, cucumbers, tomatoes, fresh herbs, feta, cheese, and greek olives) that also happened to feature some kookoo sabzi.  \n\nAs I am familiar with the flavors and dishes, they were all delicious and authentic! However, if you are exposing someone to Persian/Iranian food for the first time, you may want to pick the combination platter and a different main dish such as Khoresh Gheymeh Bodemjah to mix up the palate of flavors.  To be fair, the Gheymeh Bodemjah was recommended by our waitress, but I was stubborn and wanted my guest to try the Khoresh Ghormeh Sabzi since I had talked it up so much. :)  \n[As a side note, the kebabs around all looked and smelled good as well, but I would make sure to make sure that all newcomers to the cuisine definitely try a khoresh at least once!]\n\nFor dessert, we had the Makhlut (faloodeh and bastani combination), which was amazing.  Even if I wasn't hungry, I would come here any day just to eat the dessert alone with how perfect it was. \n\nEverything was delicious, though the only improvement would be for an option or so that would allow even more breadth of Persian/Iranian cuisine's flavors to try in one sitting for those who have never had Persian food would be nice.  However, I know this is likely a rather unrealistic request and just a hopeful one.  \n\nI would absolutely recommend visiting!  The flavors and options are far more authentic than any Persian restaurant I know of that is still running in the San Francisco - San Jose region as of this review.", "author": "John B."}

When I ordered the chicken kabob, I first got the onion pieces and butter. I did not know what Persian cuisine was and I thought that was the appetizer and I ate a little of it.. so embarrassing for me but now I think it was funny! I highly recommend the kabob. The chicken was grilled just right so it was juicy and tender. The portion was quite generous. When the chicken is consumed with the butter and onions, it was perfection! \n\nThe restaurant has a nice window layout that allows you to enjoy the city views of Civic Center, featuring large windows that let natural light in. There are several tables that are directly next to the windows. I appreciated the cultural artifacts here are there, which seemed limited to Persian pottery. Brown and yellow is an attractive color scheme. I would also point people towards the Persian tea, which tastes like a strong black tea with rose notes. Free refills on the Persian tea!", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

My partner is Iranian and hasn't had Persian food since his arrival in San Francisco. Luckily, my best friend's mom suggested this place and wanted to experience Iranian cuisine. \n\nThe order:\nAlborz plate for Two, 40$ \nKoobideh 16$\nBaghali Polo With Lamb Shank 14$\nAppetizer Combo plate 15$ \n\nMakhlut 8.50$ x2\nBaklava 6$\n\nFor my first time trying out Iranian cuisine, I've gotta say that I licked my plate absolutely clean. I liked the chicken koobideh in the Alborz plate for two because it was not only topped with saffron but the chicken was crispy and delicious on the inside. My partner really fancied the Barg, and my best friend liked the koobideh. Her mother loved her lamb shank and all around we really enjoyed our food. \n\nService:\nOur waiter was very busy thus we understood that he was handling 5-6 parties at the same time thus the service was a bit slow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-11", "description": "When it comes to Persian food, Alborz is to Anar (review: http://bit.ly/1L2PUHC) like Tuba (review: http://bit.ly/1B8dbEQ) is to A La Turca (review: http://bit.ly/1FafT7W) on the Turkish culinary palate, meaning I would be comparing an upscale white-tablecloth dinner with its down home-style counterpart. Do I favor one style over the other? It depends partially on my mood and the state of my wallet but mostly it depends on execution. I have higher expectations that the chef will hit it out of the ballpark in the white-tablecloth restaurant, even if it's in the middle of Teheran, but Alborz merely hits a grounder and barely gets a man on base. I convinced Jamie W. to come here after we shopped for moonshine at the BevMo across the street. We had a hankering after we had a taste of some in North Carolina. Don't judge me.\n\nAnyway, we entered Alborz and were immediately seated at a table facing Van Ness between two rather loud parties. My guess is that they just want to show passers-by that they are a popular, convivial spot even though the rest of the restaurant was empty. Their specialty centers around their kabobs since there was an entire page devoted to all sorts of variations on them (photo: http://bit.ly/1Mrp09A), but first we focused on the appetizers as the server handed us some thin pita and raw onion with bits of parsley (photo: http://bit.ly/1L2PPDW). I assume that we were supposed to hand-roll some onion wraps since there were Land O' Lakes butter pats really to smear over the pita. While we did that, I decided we should try the $9 Tah Dig billed as \"crispy rice topped with one kind stew\". I wasn't sure what to do with that obscure description.\n\nAt the same time, I was familiar with the dish because an Iranian colleague of mine ordered it off-menu at Anar. That was delicious, but this version was not quite as good. It was a chili-like sauce with bits of beef and chickpeas over a flat of pan-fried rice (photo: http://bit.ly/1FU1QUB). It was more about the chili than the rice. Ordering our entrees was easy since it was all about the kabobs, but this is where it would have been helpful if there was a translation of some of the terms in the description so the layman would know if he is eating lamb or chicken. Jamie went for the $18.95 Joogeh Soltani which consisted of one skewer of chicken marinated with saffron (Joogeh) and minced onion and another skewer with ground lamb and chopped onions (Koobideh) (photo: http://bit.ly/1dymSRV). It was decent enough, but the chicken was not nearly as moist as either of us wanted.\n\nThe ground lamb, however, was fine. Mine was the more expensive $24.95 Soltani (or Sultan's meal) which consisted of the Koobideh as well as Barg, a more filet cut of lamb marinated with olive oil and grilled (photo: http://bit.ly/1MroGYt). It was certainly meatier than Jamie's order, but it frankly didn't appear to be worth the premium to order. We both had the same satisfying sides, a grilled tomato and basmati rice with streaks of saffron. By this time, we were well on our way on the meh train, but we decided to go for their premium price creation, the $8 Maklut, a combination of Persian ice cream with saffron and iced rice noodles frozen in rose water (photo: http://bit.ly/1I3hm1P). It was certainly not anything I've ever had before. I liked it enough, Jamie not so much. That pretty much summarizes our whole evening there.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...rather pricey Persian fare and only sporadically interesting\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...big place but i wish they wouldn't crowd us against the window\nSERVICE - 3 stars...enthusiasm was on neutral here\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I think Anar wins the battle of the classes on this one", "author": "Ed U."}

We then order a soltani and kabob barg (or if i remember correctly they have a special for two) as entrees. We usually skip out on dessert but sometimes have tea if we are in a large group and want to stay longer to hangout/talk. The food has always been delicious.\n\nCustomer service: they have always considered our requests and been very friendly. We appreciate the smiles on their face to create a friendly environment. \n\nPrice: I think it's moderate and fair. It is not too pricy, and if you are in the bay area you should be able to afford it \n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant to all the Persian food lovers!", "author": "Kiana R."}

I've only ever gotten their chicken and beef kabobs and it tastes like home cooking to me.  They give an unreasonably large amount of rice with the kabobs but lots of Persian restaurants do that.  Apparently rice is flows freely from the heavens and you leave what you can't eat for the gods.  I haven't heard Odin complain yet so I'm OK with it. The flavors are on point for Persian food.  Both Maykadeh and Lavash are also good choices for Persian food but I prefer this spot.\n\nPersian pro-tip: When getting kabobs ask for a raw egg yolk and mix it with your rice.  Double butter!", "author": "John K."}

We wanted to eat there because we love their foods and service. But yesterday service was awful despite server is older. Eventhough they have a table server did not want to set up tables for us and made us to wait about half an hour. I didnt expect that much rude behavior from him. During the table also server didnt want to bring what we ask. We we asked him to bring some cut onions for Koobidah he brough us whole onions without chopping them.

Based on the quality of everything from service, food, and ambiance, I don't know how this place was not slammed packed on a Saturday night at 6:30.\n\nIf you are like me, and not really knowing what Persian food is all about, it can be intimidating with the menu items being in Persian, but are clearly described in English.  But I went with the lamb shank stew and eggplant not remembering what it was in Persion, but the server entertained me by complimenting my jumbled attempt at trying to say it.  The meat was fall off the bone tender in a tomatoe broth and the eggplant was nice in all of its glory when I dumped it all over my basmatti rice.  My fiancee had the cornish hen which was fan-freakin tastic.  When it was on the menu as one skewer for her meal I didn't think it was enough food, but it really was.  We also shared the appetizer platter which had all sorts of good stuff including dolmeh, olives, and more that I can't tell you what they were hahaha.

Go to either Maykadeh or Lavash, or even Anar. I do not like Alborz and I will tell the reason.\n\nEvery time ( I've been here 4 times in 6 years) I come here, I regret coimg after I eat and pay the bill.\n\n1- The waitress/ staff/ manager woman acts like she knows me, and the last time I was there, as soon as she saw me at the door she asked with a sarcasm in her tone \" Oh, were you here yesterday??\" It was very annoying that she asked such a weird question right even before she says hello or take me to a table. I was not there the day before ( I don't really need to go there everyday!) or even if I was, it was not any of her business.\n\n2- Each time when the food comes, it's either cold, or old. Yes, OLD. Three times out of the four times that I was here, the rice was looking and tasting old, like left over from the night before. As a Persian, and someone who eats rice almost every day, I can definitely tell the difference between freshly cooked and old rice. I was never satisfied with quality of food specially rice here. Kabobs are very greasy and too salty. I've also tried their Khoreshts but again, I'm not quiet happy. Something always lacks in the food here. It's either a flavor, or ingredient, or even the service. \n\n3- Prices are high for the quality. You can get the same amount of food but twice as much better quality at Maykadeh or Lavash. Sometimes Lavash  has even bigger portions for lower prices. \n\nI'm sorry that I'm writing this review, but you guys need to think about the taste of your foods. The flavors are not quiet right. If your chef is not Persian, try to hire a Persian chef!", "author": "Helen M."}

That rice is good with a little bit of that chicken gravy poured over it. Also ordered the Baba Ganoush and it met my expectations. Smoky, garlicky and all well pur\u00e9ed. I love this stuff!

Alborz is decent food, it is overpriced however when you are the best of three restaurants in the vicinity I think your allowed to increase the price. \n\nOrder the koo koo sabzi (herb egg dish/vegetarian), chicken koobideh (very moist ground chicken kebabs), all the rice dishes like baghali polo (lima beans in dill rice), shirin polo (sweet rice with orange peel and nuts) or zereshk polo (saffron and barberries rice) and the doogh (salty mint & yogurt drink). The menu is fairly vegetarian friendly for a Persian restaurant and most rice dishes can have salad as a substitution or 1/2 rice with 1/2 salad. \n\nIf you want good Persian food go to the Santa Clara/San Jose area OR Glendale/Southern California, if you want good Persian food in San Francisco try Alborz.", "author": "Shannon Z."}

This place is not what I have experienced, standard wise. I would expect that the people who gave this place great reviews to be either Persians or friends of the owner.\n\nMy boyfriend works near the restaurant so he has been wanting to try the place, but he was reludant to mention how the restaurant is almost empty and never checked on the reviews of this place.\n\nWhen we arrived, the entire place was empty and the workers were standing behind the bar, chit chatting. It took them about a few seconds to realize we were standing at the booth waiting to be seated. When we finally got seated at the corner window of the floor, they offered us the menus and wandered off. Then a waiter returns to take our order. We ordered the following (not exact names off the menu):\n\nPita Bread (Complimentary): Who serves pita bread with butter with a side of onions? I just don't understand! I guess they expect you to order some hummus if you want to have the pita bread to go with something. It's such a cheap trick. I asked for some garlic sauce and they said I would have to order the yogurt elephant sauce. They were nice enough to bring me a tiny bit to try.\n\nGrilled Prawns (appetizer): $12 for 4 prawns with cocktail sauce and a bit of salad in the middle. Completely not worth it. The taste was good, but I think I could have bought the same quality of cocktail shrimps from Costco.\n\nChicken Kabob: The chicken were tender and served with a large portion of rice and one roasted tomato on the side\n\nVeggie Kabob: Roasted eggplant, green pepper, onion, mushroom, and tomato. The proportion of the plate is completely off. The veggie takes up half of the RIM of the plate and then the rest of the plate is filled with a big portion of rice. Are they trying to make me satisfy by stuffing me with rice and not with flavor? The vegetables are bland and it taste like it's missing the basic flavor of salt (and I'm the kind of person who's sensitive to saltiness).\n\nOverall, from the outside, the place looks like fine dining. They reflect that on the price, but doesn't reflect that on the food. Which concludes you to have one overpriced restaurant with food that can be sold at food trucks for $5 a plate.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

It's also classy and romantic, the food is good, the service is attentive, and the food comes out fairly quick. I'm so glad that I found this place by doing a search of what's nearby. Since we had tickets for the Edwardian ball across the street, this was the best choice for us! BTW, the Edwardian ball was amazing! That will be my 600th review which I'm getting really close to! \n\nAnyways, my husband and I started out with the pickle and olive appetizer. It think it was $6.50. It came with baby pickles, feta cheese, and delicious black olives. We also ordered the hummus for around the same price. The portion was huge and it came with fresh slices of cucumbers and tomato's. They served us complimentary flat bread with onions and butter. For the entree, we both got the beef koobideh for $14.95. It came with two big and tender pieces of meat, plain basmati rice, and a grilled tomato. It was delicious. \n\nFor dessert, he got the baklava and coffee and I got Persian ice cream. I've never had Persian ice cream before and it sounded good, so I had to try it. It tasted like regular vanilla ice cream with a hint of rosewater. It was good, but I was full by that time so I only took a few bites and then gave the rest to my husband. He was still a little hungry after eating all that food, lol! There is a second level to this place for a better view. I wish that we would've sat up there instead. If you need to use the restroom here, you have to ask for the key at the bar. Also, they only serve beer and wine here.  If you end up parking in the garage nearby, be sure to leave there before 10:30p.m as that's when they close.", "author": "Butterfly A."}

The appetizer with the eggplant was good, but the torshee, which are pickled vegetables, was disappointing because they were chopped as a condiment and drowned in a salty sauce that cannot be eaten alone as a dish.  The tender and juicy koobideh was seasoned well.  However, the chicken joogeh was dry and tough compared to most restaurants.  The barg lacked flavor even though it was cooked medium rare.  If you ask for the basmati rice to be substituted with salad, please ask them to have the salad dressing on the side or else it will be drowned in vinegar.  \n\nThe service is slow and unfriendly, almost with disdain.  The waiter will coerce you into ordering things even though you ask questions to explore your options.  The decor and ambiance is clean, quiet and simple without any flair or authentic Persian feel.

The ambience was pretty average, but comfortable. We ordered different kabobs and stews. We asked the waitress as why the stews don't have lamb shank in them as Alborz in Berkeley does. We were told that the Berkeley branch puts lamb shanks in their stews when they run out of regular stew meat ! We later found out that it's no the case. To avoid the haggle of who pays the bill (Persian custom :), I went to the bar and gave the waitress my credit card. Later on I went to sign for the card and she had added 18% for service charge/tip. That came to $38 on our bill. She explained to me that there is a 18% service charge for parties of 6 or more. I was in too much of a hurry to check and see if it says on their menu. I also did not see that mentioned on their Yelp menu.\nAnyways, the food was ok, nothing special. The prices out $3-$4 less that Meykadeh in North Beach and way cheaper for some items (barg, soltani kababs).

I stopped by Alborz on a weekday evening with my sister. The restaurant was mostly empty at 8pm when we arrived, but we were promptly greeted, seated, and presented with the menus. They also brought us lavash bread and butter very quickly, as well as our ice water.\n\nI went with my usual koobideh and my sister decided to venture into unknown territories with a beef stew of lentils and tomatoes and eggplant. It didn't look pretty, but she seemed to enjoy it a lot. The funniest part of the meal was that her dish came with a really squishy round object that we couldn't identify. I stabbed it really easily with my fork, but I couldn't figure out what it was. She ended up breaking it open to finally figure out that it was a preserved lemon. Not sure how it added to the dish as I didn't really taste any lemony or citrus flavors, but it did provide some entertainment value for a few minutes as our brains dreamed up outlandish ideas of what it could be. My koobideh was juicy and delicious. The rice was perfectly cooked, though the saffron flavor was nonexistent. And of course, the roasted tomato was tasty. I was slightly disappointed that their portion sizes weren't huge enough for me to have leftovers for lunch the next day, given the prices. But that could also be a testament to how tasty the food was.\n\nI'd consider returning to Alborz for lunch sometime if their lunch prices are lower than their dinner prices.

And I mean that in the most basic way possible!\n\nI enter...no hostess..some guy behind the bar...he goes to the back soon too. Since I just got a new phone im like eh whatever and mess around on it for 5 minutes thinking they will come to me then. Over 5 minutes passes nothing. Mind you, in this large restaurant there is only one other person sitting and he is merely paying his bill. After about 10 minutes. I decide to take a seat at one of the 50 open tables. \n\nI literally sit there (by myself) waiting for 20 minutes before anyone comes to me to give me water or a menu! Since I am not with anyone at the moment the only thing I have to entertain me is the dismal view of Van Ness st. Why is all the staff hiding in the back? There didnt seem to be a shortage of staff, up to 4 people seemed to have been assigned the front....bus boy, server, hostess..and there was barely any patrons..yet they all hide in the back?? I feel like there was a company foosball tournament going on back there or som shet. Though both times I went it was like this.\n\nI order my food right when he hands me the menu in fear of having to wait another 20 minutes for him to ask me what I would like. I get the Soltani, which is a common Persian combination entree: basmatic saffron infused rice (persian rice so gewd), a grilled tomato, 1 skewer of barg (flattened steak cut), 1 skewer of koobideh (seasoned ground beef). Sometimes comes with onions and other stuff, tho not here.\n\nThe wait for the food itself was average. Food review:\n\nKoobideh: 4/5 stars....seasoned well, tasty and juicy, though not super juicy/greasy. At the same time not amazing. Koobideh is good and cheap but usually I dont buy a bunch of koobideh cuz its not healthy, thad be like buying multiple hamburgers.\n\nBarg: 1/5 stars. I ordered medium, this came well done. dry like rubber, and the meat tasted old! disgusting! one of the rare times i didnt finish my kabob. but actually this does happen from time to time, some restaurants have horrible barg, i dunno why.\n\nShish Kabob (from other time I went recently) : 3/5 stars\n\nseemed to have been marinated in a way that was unusual for persian shish kabob. salty and wet. not typical shish kabob, tho wasnt too bad either. would not order again. Shish kabob comes with grilled bell pepper, onion etc.\n\nI have yet to try the joojeh (chicken thigh) kabob, hopefully its good, cuz so far coming here I only enjoy the koobideh.\n\nanother note, the other time i came the hostess/waitress was this 30 somtin yr old persian chic in what seemed to be a dominatrix outfit. some (but definitely not most) persian women seemed confused fashion-wise, she was wearing a black top, this knarly black skirt, with tall black leather boots. kinda cracked me up, i dont really care though lol\n\nthe carpet and decor needs to be updated, looks liek its from a shitty casino in the 70's\n\nanyway I asked for my bill and it took another 20 minutes to get there...yes while i look around and there are 2 other tables eating, NO ONE IN THE FRONT, ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE BACK TWIDDLING THEIR BALLS\n\none last thing, in order to get to the bathroom you need to go through this long corrider that passes by the bar/restaurant next door that serves deep dish pizza or somtin. I dont like this, the pizza is super appetizing but im in persian food mode..it F's with your brain. That's like being on a nice date, and then walking through a strip club. \n\nThey dont accept amex.

I was craving for Iranian food and we decided to go to Albourz as my husband is familiar with their menu and know this place better. So, we went in and Azer khanim greet us in a very hospitable manner that made us feel special. She let us chose the place the we prefer to sit and then provided us with menu. As per my hubby's advice, we decided to have qeyma bademjand, and fesenjan (one of our fav. Iranian meal). We started our dinner with lavash that came with onion and parsley, and salted butter. I have no idea why they serve butter with onion, however, I enjoyed lavash with butter. We continued our food with combo appetizer, including yoghurt with cucumber, shahrezad (cucumber, tomato, onion mixed) and bademjan. I loved bademjan so much that I was almost full with this appetizer. As soon as we finished our appetizer, they brought main meal: fesenjan made from chicken and nuts, and qeyma bademjan made from meat, eggplant and beans, and basmati rice. Tell the truth, I was enjoyed fesenjan so much that ate almost all of it, didn't have any place for qeyma bademjan :)  I used to eat a lot fesenjan in my childhood as my grandmother was a master of this meal, and today it took me to my childhood. As there was no space for qeyma in our stomach, because the portion is really big enough even to share with two people, we decided to take away qeyma and rice. It's sin not to have tea and leave this fabulous place. So, after a while, we ordered tea and pakhlava. The tasted and smelled rose water that gives special pleasure to drink after taste food. The pakhlava wasn't Iranian, but was Turkish. I tried various pakhlavas in different Turkush restaurant, even at Turkish friends' party's.

Today's pakhlava was the best one that I have ever tried in Bay Area, including Turkish friends (please, don't be offended my Turkish friends ). The pakhlava at Albourz isn't too sweet, it has just enough amount of sugar and fresh pistachios on it. I loved it so much that wanted to order a box of pakhlava, although I was full with food .

The meaty kebab goodness came on a large plate with buttery, loose Basmati rice that melted into seasoned sweetness on the tongue. On the side was also a decent helping of mixed greens lathered in a light tangy dressing. Every bite of the kebab sent me into sweet oblivion, where nothing but the explosion of succulent taste in my mouth mattered, while the Basmati grains and fresh salad helped to pull everything into a mutually-complementary whole.\n\nI don't know how this restaurant compares to other Persian establishments, but based on this single experience alone, I am now a fan of the cuisine and would recommend this to anybody who is seeking to venture outside of the familiar or is simply looking to fulfill their cravings for savory Persian flavor.\n\nA++!", "author": "Amy T."}

The platter includes dolma (beef with herbs, rice and lentils wrapped in grape leaves), kashk bademjan (roasted eggplant), cucumbers, tomatoes, herbs, feta cheese and Greek olives.

Luckily one night when I was in the city friends suggested we go to Alborz to pick up some dinner. \n\nUsually when you walk into a Iranian restaurant you are expecting run of the mill decor (for a chelo kababi restaurant) and typical music playing.  \n\nThe decor was there, slightly beat up but there, and you could hardly hear the music.  Not that I would normally care, but the restaurant was near empty (and quiet) except for a group of 10 in the corner and another couple in the other corner. Would have felt more welcoming if there was more noise?\n\nOk to food. Honestly it was all good I have no complaints. Actually I had to give an extra star for the fact they served zaboon as an appetizer on a weeknight! I was so excited seeing it on the menu. We ordered it and it was delicious. Since we were about 5 people we decided to do family style which worked out great, bc Iranian restaurants always bring out way too much rice. We ordered a number of things but the one thing I liked off the menu was the option to three types of kabab for sharing with rice. Iranian food at home is family style but for some reasons at restaurants it isn't served as family style, although many of the American restaurants have people who want to treat it that way. Which is ok but the restaurants need to catch up and understand this! So when it comes to wanting to do family style, I've normally seen a \"soltani\" option where they give you two types of kabab, uniquely but Alborz offered another dish that gave three kababs, obviously understanding people like to do family style. I like that, made life easier choosing things to eat. \n\nI took two points off because the waiter wasn't good. It was hard to get his attention, and he acted like he didn't understand my Farsi.  WTF? I asked him his recommendation on a couple of things, usually waiters give you their opinion and reasons why he just sorta pointed and said \"this one\" but no explanation. Now I'm not stupid I grew up with Iranian food, so I just shrugged him off and made a decision off of what I knew, but what if someone who's never has Iranian food comes in and he treats them like that? They'll be so confused on what to do!\n\nAll in all good food, check it out, but don't expect much with service.", "author": "Sunny D."}

At first I was a little skeptical due to the fact that we were the only customers. However, soon enough, big parties and a few couples started to fill the restaurant. The owner was very friendly and had a smile on always. I ordered chicken, my mom ordered the koobideh, and my dad - the salmon. The pita bread and onions were very interesting and the salad was nice and light but a little small, portion wise. The food came out soon and we ate our meals happily. There was something missing with the food, however. I can't put my finger on it, but I felt like it was lacking that certain spice to make all the ingredients come together and blend perfectly.

Service: You would expect a server to be a little more attentive when only six people are in the entire restaurant, including yourself. \n\nNo, \"how's the food?\" or \"would you like a refill?\" ever graced us\n\n\n2. Food: Old. The tah dig served felt like it has been frozen and then ultimately de-frosted. How can one be so sure?\n\nWell, true tahdig is crispy, and easily comes off the fork when pressing slightly on it. The tahdig at Alborz felt like it made or iron ore. No knife would have qualified in cutting it to pieces. \n\nFesenjoon: Did not taste fresh. Did not want to send it back in fear of retribution. \n\nChicken and beef: Not cooked well. One was overcooked, and the other under. In fairness, the pita bread and the rice were good, but you don't spend $20 a plate to find that out.\n\n3. Bill: Overcharged in the drinks category by a non-existent server. Always fun when a restaurant adds insult to injury.\n\n4. Management: I have read a few reviews in regards to the Restaurant.com vouchers people purchased but were not able to use. Not surprised. They probably realized that it was a bad decision when four of their five customers have coupons, and they weren't hitting their monthly quotas. I sympathize with the people who paid money for the certificates, and then should at the very least be reimbursed.\n\n5. Conclusion: Stay the hell away.\n\nThe tab runs up quickly (in our instance over $100) and you getting no-value add for the money spent. A suggestion in general: \n\nThe Bay area's Persian restaurants have taken mediocrity to unfathomable heights. Consistently, the food is not up to par with some of its SoCal counterparts and should be avoided.\n\nIf you have a Maman - Bozorg (Grandma) who cooks insanely delicious, flavorful, fresh, and ample servings of Iranian food, please kiss her for me on the cheek and let's start eating.\n\nFor Alborz, I truly hope that they learn from their mistakes and managerial ineptitude, and stop making Persians look bad in the process. \n\nDB", "author": "Dave B."}

BAIT AND SWITCH\n\nAs a Persian Colleague in the East Bay had referred me to Alborz in Walnut Creek and Fremont, I was excited to try the one in San Francisco. Now I'm not sure if they're even related. I felt lucky to have found a restaurant.com voucher for $50 worth of food for $25. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess informed us after we were seated that they did not accept the Restaurant.com vouchers anymore and that for 7 months they have been requesting that their name be taken off the website. They told us THEY were victims of fraud. We decided to order a little less food and try the restaurant just the same. The hostess was nice enough to comp us an appetizer of tabouleh salad.\n\nOn returning home we found that Alborz still offered vouchers on restaurant.com. We called restaurant.com and they informed us that the management had NOT made any request to remove their name from the voucher service and that we were the third party to complain about Alborz not honoring the vouchers. Apparently restaurant.com is legally bound to keep the contract with Alborz until there are 4 complaints filed. I was very disappointed at the dishonesty and the bait and switch technique used to lure people to their restaurant.\n\nNOW FOR THE ACTUAL REVIEW\nI could not in good conscience give such a restaurant more than one star for their lack of ethics. If not for that incident, I'd give a solid 3 stars.\n\nFOOD... Three Stars, I've eaten some really fantastic Persian food... this is not tops, but it was decent, much more decent than other reviewers have stated. The lavash bread was served with onions and butter but without the customary herbs (mint, italian parsley, etc) which I thought was a little strange. \n\nThe rice served with the main courses was very good... nothing to complain about. The kabobs quality of meat was delicious and tender; I've seen larger pieces of meat, of course, but they were not inordinately small and neither of us could finish the meal it was so large, and we like to eat, so no complaints on the portion. Fesenjoon was delicious... chicken in a walnut and pomegranate sauce. A solid 3 stars\n\nDECOR&PRESENTATION- not dingy as others may have complained, but definately ready for a facelift. I would not recommend based on decor and would not recommend for a first date. The presentation of the food was not present but nothing was spilled either, just no effort to be special or beautiful.\n\nPRICE- Appetizers and side salads were $7-12, most entrees were $12-$25, so I'd say the place was moderately priced, unlike some of the other reviews, I'd say it's probably average for a sit-down Persian Restaurant. Not a great value, but not astronomical.\n\nSERVICE- Other than the blatant dishonesty described above, the service was fine. We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff were pleasant. We were not left unattended, no one hovered over the table obnoxiously, average, straight-forward service.", "author": "J B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-06", "description": "If you ever wonder why grown Iranian dudes never move out of their parents' houses, it's because of the food. There's no Persian food quite as good as your mom's or grandma's. Luckily, they taught me the cuisine and I could make it for myself, but it's time consuming and requires lots of specialty ingredients.\n\n\n So even though we could cook for ourselves, my Iranian friends and I (and one farangi aka gringo) felt like saving time one night and hit up Alborz for dinner.\n\n\n Now the menu and service at just about any Persian restaurant in the world is going to be about the same: A selection of chelokababs and stews, some de rigeur appetizers, and maybe some rice dishes. So the only real point of competition, besides price, is in the quality of both the dishes and the ingredients used.\n\n\n Alborz largely succeeds. We started with an order of mast-o-khiar (yogurt with cucumbers) to dip our lavash flatbread in, and it was good. Rich in consistency, not runny, and stuck to the bread. We added on an order of mast-o-museer and were impressed. Museer is elephant garlic, a hard-to-find relative of the shallot and the leek, and a lot of places cheap out and use either shallots or very little of the real thing. Not these guys - so we knew we'd be in for a treat.\n\n\n Our next appetizer arrived: tahdig (the crunchy crust from the bottom of a pot of rice) covered in ghormeh sabzi (a spinach and fenugreek stew with red beans). The beans were unfortunately canned, so we had a bit of apprehension before we got to the main course\n\n\n And we weren't disappointed. The kababs were fantastic, and we all shared skewers of the barg (filet mignon), koobideh (ground beef) and joojeh (boneless chicken) and enjoyed every bit. But the real standout part was the rice. The chelo in chelokabab stands for the rice, and it's an integral part of the meal - some might even say the star. Preparing basmati rice in the Iranian fashion is a painstaking process, and many steps are often omitted in the restaurant biz because of the volume and turnover involved. Alborz did not skimp. The rice is fragrant, perfectly cooked, and appropriately garnished with a good amount of saffron - another area where many restaurants would cheap out.\n\n\n And while we weren't decked out in black leather and Drakkar, we decided to fully PerZiAn out and capped off our gutbusting dinner with tea and dessert. The darjeeling tea, laced with a bit of cardamom, came in large glasses (we don't do cups in the Axis of Evil) and with quality firm sugar cubes. The baklava was good, with a decent amount of pistachio. However, the zulubia and bamieh - the closest way to describe them would be honey-dipped funnel cake and churros - were stale. We figured this was because no one ever orders that stuff and didn't dock them any points for it.\n\n\n Overall, I was pretty impressed by Alborz. The prices aren't fantastic because their only real competition in San Francisco is the overpriced North Beach mainstay Maykadeh. But the food was great, service was attentive, and the atmosphere classy but relaxed. The additional light show provided by the sparks flying from the Van Ness muni made for extra entertainment during dinner.", "author": "Omid T."}

It's more about the horrible service and over-priced menu.  My husband and I were craving kabob and decided to go to Alborz.  We've been to Alborz a few times, especially when my parents are visiting and we generally have had a good experience--but not this time!\n\nWe got there and were seated away from all of the other customers (a plus), but right next to the doorway to the kitchen (a minus--we could hear the barked orders all night).  As we waited for our order to be taken, I noticed my glass was dirty (finger prints and dried on food smears), the plate was cracked and my knife looked like it had been wiped instead of washed.  Ge-ross! \n\nWe finally gave our order--a plate of tah dig (crispy rice from the bottom of the rice cooker served with stew on top) and one sultani (steak and ground beef kabobs).  Now, in the past sharing these two dishes would fill both of us up, even if we hadn't eaten all day long.  To our disappointment, the plate of tah dig arrived looking like they had prepared them the world's tiniest pots!  Furthermore, the rice tasted OLD--I know this, b/c I sometimes recook left over rice on the stove to get tah dig, but it never tastes right.  This tah dig had to have been more than a day old.  On top of that, the same guy that was busing tables, was the guy that served our food!!! And the \"serving fork\" provided for the tah dig was placed on our table by holding the tine end!! WTF?!?!  I'm supposed to serve myself runny stew with a fork that you just molested with your dirty hands?????\n\nThen the sultani came out--again, what happened to the large portions? I could eat the entire plate by myself!  I have to say the kabob was delicious, but after the night's earlier events, I was left to wonder if I was eating old food off a dirty plate.  \n\nMy poor husband was still hungry, so we decided to order desert--zulbeyah and bomeyeh (persian sweets).  Now usually this is a real treat, b/c I don't know how to make this stuff at home.  But when the desert came out and I took that first bite of zulbeyah, there was no \"savoring the gooey yumminess\"; instead I about spit out the OLD and STALE desert!  \n\nThe real disappointment came when we got the check--$60 BEFORE TIP!!! WTF?!  We ordered an appetizer and one meal with desert.  How the heck can this be a $60 meal???  We added up the items, and sure enough....$60.  SO NOT WORTH IT!  Especially after the horrible service, I was inclined to leave NO TIP; but alas, I thought of my embarrassed mother lecturing me about the struggles of \"her people\" trying to make it in America and I left a 20% tip.\n\nAt the end of the night, my husband and I waved good-bye politely as we left the restaurant, with a substantially lighter wallet and even lighter stomach.", "author": "S.

The kebabs were all delicious, especially the filet mignon kebab. The bread and Basmati rice are tasty, as was the sampler appetizer plate. The food wasn't amazing, but was very good if you're in need of some Persian food when in the area. The prices are a bit high for 'just good' food, which may keep me from eating here very often, but certainly isn't a reason to write Alborz off... It isn't a bad idea to try it at least once. \n\nMy first visit to Alborz left me satisfied; I wouldn't mind coming here again.", "author": "Aaron J."}

Food is ridiculously expensive ($60+ for 2 people), and ridiculously salty, and service was poor. \n\nWe wanted to try a new place and enjoy Iranian food, so we we went over to Alboroz. We were seated promply, decided what we wanted to order, and ordered. We asked to get the yogurt (w/ cucumber) with the meal. We also ordered a ground meat kabob and lamb shank stew.\n\nThe kabob: ok, but really salty, we got it with the barberry rice, which was good\n\nThe lamb shank in stew: MAYBE luke warm when delivered- bordering on cold, hardly a stew... just a lamb shank, some egg plant, and a puddle of broth- tasted better over-microwaved at work the next day\n\nThe yogurt: not delivered... it took us 5 minutes to flag down a waiter, then another 5 to get the yogurt- no apology offered. Also, who charges $6+ for a SMALL bowl of yogurt- barely enough for the two of us to have w/ the meal?\n\nOh, and when we were ordering the waiter asked if we wanted tomato w/ the beef kabob, we said sure. Turns out one grilled tomato cost us several dollars (~$4 if I remember correctly)- REALLY?!?!?!?!?\n\nOverall we were very disappointed and left with 2 thoughts: \n1) If you want something \"different\" go to A La Turka (Turkish) in the Tenderloin for better food and service and a lower price tag- and close by\n2) If you want Persian, go to Lavash in the Sunset, same price, better service and better food", "author": "Reva B."}

I would go here twice a month if it was more affordable (and I don't even live in the city), but at its present menu prices I may visit twice a year.

Someone came over to take our drink orders of water and Persian tea and didn't come back for about 10 minutes.  This is pretty much how the rest of the night went...REALLY SLOW SERVICE.  The 3 of us shared 2 entrees, Koobideh and Barg, and enjoyed them very much.  Aside from the restaurant being understaffed on a Saturday night, I noticed that at least 5 or 6 groups of people walked in after we got there, even after 10pm, and were still seated for dinner.  We finally got out of there right before 11pm.  I probably wouldn't dine here again unless I had to for a special occasion or something.

Dunno, don't care) was tender, forking apart easily in a rich dark sauce.  \nI think when we went it was in the midst of a some major cultural holiday and there were a lot of families dining, dressed in special occasion attire.  Alborz was elegant enough to accomodate that festive vibe - or a date - or just an opportunity to get a few good friends together so you can really try out their menu. \nI think that's the real key to getting your dollar's worth at Alborz - critical mass!

I took my girlfriend of the time to introduce her to a little persian food. The mast-o-museer was well made and tasty, and the rice was fluffy and flavorful. Big portions, as required in persian cuisine, and very good chicken kebab (I had a little of hers). The salmon was good although with a little less lemon and saffron than i am used to, and I'm used to having this dish with sabzi-polo, a different rice dish than the saffron-flavored basmati rice that came (this may partially be because I am used to northern Iranian, Mazandarani persian food due to my familial origin... it could be a regional variation, as the owners are from the capitol). All in all excellent dish. Ambience was great for a date, not too fancy but still upscale, and the owners were delighted to serve another Iranian and even more delighted to serve and interact with my West Virginian, ethnically Welsh girlfriend. They even brought out a couple different appetizer samplers to help her decide (everything with eggplant in this place was great by the way... where do they get their produce?). The price was reasonable, which is not always the case with Persian restaurants, and the location is a good one for shooting out after dinner to hit a show/club in the hopes of staving off food-coma. \n\nOverall, a really good restaurant that is better than the other Persian restaurants I have been to in the Bay thus far, meriting four stars.", "author": "Mani F."}

Also, don't skip the sumac onions and lavash bread appetizers and your palate will be sharpened for the kebabs. It reminds me of the finely ground and spiced kebabs in Bombay at mughal style restaurants. Bring your appetite! I think any Indian meat  eaters would enjoy these kebabs.\n\nNaturally we are a bit picky about our rice so this place did not meet my high hopes for steamed rice. But I wasnt there for the rice!\n\nIts nice to have a linen tablecloth setting at these prices - servings are all family style however. Parking is avail at the garage around the corner.\n\nAtmosphere is the biggest minus. I found the mournful grim hostess made it hard to enjoy my meal completely.  The staff needs a little atmospheric brightening --be happy!\n\nThinking about the kebabs is making me hungry.", "author": "Nan L."}

We were sat at a table, the server took our order and never came back to the table. We were one of 4 tables at the most. The bus boy brought our food, I had to ask for more drinks from him, he never brought them but I was still charged. I asked the bus boy for the check and after 15 minutes of waiting for the check had to walk to the counter to ask for our check from the bus boy again because our server was on the phone and looked bothered to give us our check ... even though she saw us standing there waiting she took her time with her phone call. She still over charged us and was completely rude. Being Persian myself I was very disappointed. I will never go back and I will never recommend this place to anyone.

Loved it's combination with the rice - 4/5.\n\nDessert: Rose Petal Ice Cream!  Again, first time I've had it but I'd highly recommend it if you want to try something new.

Although the food was good, it was not worth the mental anguish that I endured...ok so it wasn't that bad but close. For details read on:\n\nI was so disappointed. Having had family visit, I wanted to take them to one of the local Persian restaurants. If you can get it to go, it might be worth the trouble. \n\nSo, what's the problem: \nThe waitress came by once to take our order, during which we got to experience the first of her attitude. It is customary in Persian restaurants to bring bread and butter before a meal, however we hadn't gotten ours. We asked if we were going to get any and she rudely responds that they don't bring that out until the order has been placed in the kitchen, because in the past the people of SF come, eat the bread and leave without placing an order (it was ridiculous to us too!!!!) \n\nOur order was actually brought to us by the bus boy and even after that the server came back and kept telling us over and over why they don't bring the bread prior to the order being placed (and not in an apologetic kind of way but to justfy why she was right and we were wrong to dare question her.) In the end she said the \"they\" would not allow her to do so.\n\nNot once did she come to check how were doing and if the meal was to our satisfaction. We didn't mind until we got our bill and then she had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity (after tax!) because there were 5 people in our party. (I know this is common in restaurants, but at least provide a service!) When we challenged her, she became defensive saying that she was very attentive (the only other time we saw her was right before she brought the check, she filled our water glass) and said that this was a common problem with people from LA-- because apparently good service is defined differently from city to city. She proceeded to get her calculator, slamming it on the table and recalculating everything. In the end she pretty much told us to just pay the bill (sans gratuity) and leave. (Interesting enough we asked to speak to the manager, and she said she was the manager- which begs the question who \"they\" were).\n\nI guess in the end, the waitress/manager (?) managed to ruin the whole meal. :(", "author": "A F."}

The service: charming, friendly, helpful, from the hostess to the man refilling our water. We had live background music the whole time that was as authentic and delicious as the food. In lieu of a breadbasket, we sat down to feta cheese, fresh herbs, and raw onion - surprisingly intense and tasty, in an \"oh my god my eyes are burning I'm about to sneeze I don't know if i can handle...wow!\" kind of way. My fave entree: the stuff with the pomegranate sauce. YUM! Tangy, rich, succulent. Next time I want to try it with the duck. Our other entree, salmon kabobs, teased my mouth with but a moment of joy. Four large chunks of flaky salmon grilled to juicy goodness with just the right crisp on the edges. For dessert I tried both the rosewater ice cream, which you should just close your mouth around and inhale like arometherapy, and the version with frozen rice noodles. The noodles, especially after a spritz of lemon juice, were...interesting. Probably won't have those again. My one complaint - the combo appetizer just didn't thrill me like I'd hoped. Or perhaps I just needed assembly instructions for the various clumbs and globs.
