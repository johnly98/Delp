The food here is actually really good, compared to typical bar food. It seems like the kitchen actually put some thought into the menu. I particularly love the vegan sloppy joe's - which do not taste overly vegan. The fish burger is good too - they actually take the time to grill the fish properly.\n\nThe vibe is divey but living-room-esque. There is also ample seating so you're not forced to stand around hovering.\n\nMy one complaint is that the bartender on the side with the pool table is sometimes in a pissy mood and takes it out on the customers - my friends and I go here pretty often and one night some of us took like a second too long to decide if/how many shots were needed and that pissed him off apparently? Other than that, the rest of the crew is pretty solid.\n\nProtip: kitchen is only open until 11pm, so if you're stumbling home late and looking for food, just remember to get there before 11!", "author": "Farrah N."}

A bar that hosts brunch, who knew!\n\nWe started our meal with bottomless mimosas. The waiters/bartenders were quick to refill your glass when it starts to get empty. Appreciated that! The food itself took a while to come out but it did not disappoint. I ordered the biscuits & gravy and added bacon on the side. You have to hit a $10 minimum on food to get the bottomless mimosa deal. So adding the bacon took my meal right above $10. I believe the biscuits are made in house. They were warm, fluffy & delicious!! The gravy was also really good. The only con was the potatoes were a little burnt, but still edible! From what I can tell, it had good flavor.\n\nOverall, I'm happy I stumbled upon this place. Will definitely come back & visit whenever I'm in the area!", "author": "Andrea F."}

We started out with bottomless mimosas and bottomless bloody marys (yes yes yes bottomless is the way to go!!!!) then we transitioned to more drinks. Here's a list of what we got:\n\nMimosa: Yum; better than your average Cook's and cheap OJ kinda deal. Definitely a winner.\n\nBloody Mary: Light on the alcohol, but I prefer it that way if I'm going to be inhaling bottomless ones...great flavor and adds a good amount of spicy kick to your taste buds!\n\nScorpion bowl: The complete opposite of my bloody mary. This is meant to kick you in the face and get you hammered FAST!! Definitely got a good amount of alcohol here--not that any of us were complaining. I think this bowl is meant for 4, but 2 can have a great time with one of these ;) \n\nHangover meal: Their homemade biscuits are delicious, and even more so with sausage and bacon! I don't really think it needed the mayo, but everything else was on point! The fruit was also very fresh and the potatoes (with the exception of a couple burnt/toasty ones) had amazing flavor!\n\nCarne asada scramble with guac: I actually don't think this dish needed the guac (extra charge), even though it was very tasty guac indeed. I really enjoyed the large amounts of carne asada, and it went very well with the cheese and eggs. Maybe I'll go all out and add a biscuit to this next time.\n\nFries: Great for the drunchies. These fries are very salty, and some were slightly limp (I actually don't like super crunchy fries though), so it was exactly the way I liked it. They also give you a giant basket of these, so make sure you share!\n\nOverall, YES, I'd love to come here again! I waddled out stuffed to the brim with delicious food and alcohol, and there are so many more things I want to try on the menu (and at the bar!)

It was so bad that after 1.5 hours I had to cancel my order and walk away.  Everyone else in our party got their food--burgers, fries, chicken nuggets. Our food, it was an order for 3, a burger, carne asada fries, and wings never came out.  When I asked the associate Gabe for help, he yelled at me, \"I know you're 45 and your food isn't up!\" He offered no help nor to check on why our good was taking so long. He was rude and totally a disgrace to the restaurant profession. When one of my WHITE friends went to ask for the order they were treated very different than me and told they would check on that. And when I went with my other friend to cancel the order, then miraculously our order appeared.  \n\nMy frustration with The Willows aside from the unacceptable service is the treatment I received. I am not sure if it was because I am Latino or because I am gay or simply because I was not white. When I went to check in my order, after and hour waiting, I was not met with helpful service but attitude and disdain.  The only excuse I received was that the kitchen was backed up--but how backed up could it be when our friends and tables around us got their food? \n\nI will never enter this establishment again and I will make sure everyone I know understands what a sub professional restaurant The Willows is and to avoid it.", "author": "Carlos S."}

We were feeling peckish, and I had heard good things about the Willows, a space I had not been to since the old Hamburger Mary's days. When we entered, it was fairly quiet at around 7PM, surprising since SoMa is known for its crowded watering holes no matter what the hour. We initially parked ourselves at the side bar in the middle room where the pool tables are and started perusing the menu. They offered quite a robust selection of goodies.\n\nThere were temptations bordering on absurd like Pork Belly Donuts and Fried Chicken Sliders, and believe you me, they were under serious consideration. However, common sense washed over us like the loose urinary tract of a moose, and consequently we went with salads albeit big ones. Jamie ordered the $12.75 Cobb Salad, which brought together green leaf lettuce, chopped bacon, fried chicken slabs, blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes and cucumbers into a symphony of healthy tastiness as it was tossed in a tarragon vinaigrette dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1PcV5Il). It was quite a hefty bowl to come out of a bar kitchen.\n\nI was in the mood for kale and went with the $11.75 Kale Greek Salad which came with tomatoes, red onion, pepperoncinis, cucumbers, olives and crumbled feta cheese, all of that tossed liberally in extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice (photo: http://bit.ly/20aSdNQ). It was really well executed, and while we ate our salads at a communal table already inhabited by a trio of laptoppers who never looked up, the vibe was low-key enough for us to eat in relative peace. We weren't completely healthy, by the way, as we shared the $5.75 Basket of Onion Strings with Chipotle Aioli, addictive crispy greasiness that reminded us that we were indeed in a bar (photo: http://bit.ly/1OCtYB4).\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly good and hearty salads for pure bar bites\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...spacious, low-key bar could provide a leisurely afternoon hangout\nSERVICE - 3 stars...the food certainly came fast enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...overlook the hipsters and come for a bite", "author": "Ed U."}

The potatoes on the side were nicely seasoned and crispy- it is sad how many places mess up breakfast potatoes and make them either bland or soggy, but these were great. The bacon was alright- nothing too noteworthy but its bacon so nothing to complain about either. My small complaints would be that after a while, the food did get on the salty side and the sausage gravy had a little too much pepper for my taste.

I stopped in for an evening of booze, burgers and brains (trivia) with some co-workers and was overall very impressed. \n\nWhat excited me the most was two-fold. First, the separate bar specializing in craft beers featured a fantastic selection, making for some satisfactory head nods with every new brew I ordered. Second, I love their menu, which had me salivating before ever trying the food. I settled on a DIY burger which comes with lettuce, vine ripe tomato, pickles and mayo. I added some cheddar and caramelized onions. For some reason I thought this would be just another bar where the menu was too clever and health-oriented for its own good, but the burger, like everything else, was clearly designed for someone who loves flavor over concerns about getting fat. \n\nThe only downside was the service. We sat at our table for what must have been 30 minutes before figuring out ourselves that our orders must be placed at the bar. The waiter pretty much ignored us except when bringing out food, and even then he had no idea who ordered what.

Got a strange sense of deja-vu - like I've been here before back when it was another bar or restaurant.\n\nIn any case, this is definitely a strange place. Don't get me wrong - I had a decent time and all. It's just that this place doesn't really have an identity. It's kind of all over the map. On one hand, it's kind of a divey SOMA bar with a pool table. On the other hand, they sell food (burgers, sandwiches, pork belly donuts, etc.). They also have their own craft beer bar in the back, and a small video arcade in the front. This place is literally trying to be everything for everyone.\n\nI ordered a Side Car to kick off my evening. It was tasty/strong - and made with their own special cognac. However, when I tried to order a second one, the bartender informed me that they they \"ran out of the ingredients.\"  Um... ok. No biggie. I'll have an Old Fashioned then.\n\nIn any case, the food is actually decent pub grub. I ordered the fried chicken slider and the lamb slider. Warning: although delicious, the sliders are quite small (even for a slider). So I'd recommend ordering at least 3 or 4 if you're really hungry. The burger looked large and scrumptious. The fried mac and cheese balls with dipping sauce was a winner. And even though they sound weird, the pork belly donuts were actually pretty good.\n\nService here is definitely spotty. Don't expect a waiter to come to your table (even though they have a full menu). All food orders need to be placed at the bar. It took us about 20 minutes to figure that one out (but that's our own fault). The bartender (who seemed a bit overwhelmed) typed in our order, and we received our food within 20 minutes. \n\nFYI - they do trivia night on Wednesdays at 7pm. There's no cost to play. And the winning team gets $30. Though make sure the other teams aren't cheating. I'm convinced that the team behind us was using their smart phone to look up answers. Oh well.\n\nAll in all, this place is decent - not great. If I come back, it will def be for trivia night.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Inspection day was today, and we arrived with a balanced thirst and appetite.\n\nUpon walking in on a lazy Sunday afternoon, the Willows looked like a bar or lounge in the pre-amp hours, lots of dark wood and black leather booths, but with rock music wonderfully blasting on the sound system.  We were greeted amiably by the bartenders, sat down and browsed the cocktail and menus.  Peering up, we saw the selection of board games and local denizens playing pool and pinball in the periphery.  Solid.\n\nOnto the food/drink: they have an indulgent selection of gastropub menu items and some interesting cocktail offerings, too. We ordered the fried mac 'n' cheese bites, the Western burger and the Black Bean Patty burger.  I'd pass on the mac 'n' cheese bites, they were somewhere in the realm of meh, just tasted liked a breaded version of the Kraft variety.  Both burgers were quite good, not epic but solid in taste and freshness.  \n\nThe cocktails were so-so; I had the margarita and it was a bit too sweet and syrupy, not enough kick.  The followup, the Lo Siento, with grapefruit juice + tequila was better but nothing to write home about either. \n\nSo if the food and drink was just slightly above average overall, why the 4 stars you ask?  The bartenders, that's why.  They were super-friendly and provided great service, even with the chill vibe on a Sunday afternoon.  \n\nFor Missionites, this place is kinda like a spacious Sycamore, both in food quality and atmosphere, and better in service and attitude.

No - I think the roast beef probably could have been a little less well-done. But, that being said, it was an awesome sandwich.

It is anything but pretentious and achieves everything it aims to be.\n\nWith that said, let's be clear:  The Willows sits in the western end of SoMa.  It is a bar where you can hang out, play pool, play cards, eat great bar food, drink exquisite beer.  It is NOT a pick-up joint.  It is NOT a place to come and flaunt your latest app.  It is NOT a place to flaunt yourself or your wares.\n\nLOVE this bar because the staff is relaxed, yet completely dedicated.  There is a craft beer side of the bar with about 12-14 taps and some nice bottles (for in-bar consumption).  Excellent tap choices, usually focused on West Coast offerings, but their ability to obtain unusual beers from the East Coast (especially Maine) is impressive.  Obviously, one of the owners has a special \"in\" with several local breweries because this bar occasionally taps a keg that is only available at Willows, or at its sister bar, The Sycamore.  They also have macrobrews in bottles for those who drink bad beer (blech ... Why those folks even bother to wake up in the morning, I'll never know).  \n\nThe pub menu is perfect for those who have no guilt about what they will eat while imbibing.  On a diet? This isn't the bar menu for you.  Are you a hedonist?  You have hit the jackpot, buddy, because they grill their sandwich bread in BUTTER before slapping on the meat.  The OMFC is a hamburger served inside two grilled cheese sandwiches.  Jackpot.  Seriously.\n\nI haven't spent much time at the non-craft beer side, but I do see they have a full bar and lots of drink specials.  That room is much larger, with tables, gaming areas, pool tables and a large standing 'share' table.\n\nLet's also be joyous of the fact that this was one of the first bars in SF to ban Google glasses.  Keep the glassholes away!  Thank you, Willows!  \n\nI highly recommend this bar to folks who live in SoMa and the Mission.  It's very reminiscent of the way SF used to be.

A bit of background, it was my first time visiting the establishment and I had asked staff about the size of the sliders. The staff member gave me a good idea of how big these burgers were and I decided to order. I went immediately to the restroom, and when I came back I was given a moderately sized burger. In other restaurants I've been to the size of the sliders are rather large (buffalo burgers). I was a bit confused by how big it was, but just started eating anyway. Staff stopped by to let me know that I had eaten the wrong burger, I apologized and paid for it. I did not appreciate that one staff member, began commenting about me negatively to her customers, at one point saying that \"I stole the burger.\" I found it offensive and was embarrassed by the situation. It infuriated me, that even after I tried to make amends for the mix-up, I was treated like a petty thug. I am not here to troll, but I just couldn't let this one go. The establishment is fine otherwise, and wouldn't discourage people from coming.", "author": "Edward R."}

Put those all together and you've got a recipe for an awesome hangout spot at the Willows!\n\nStepping into the Willows you are greeted almost immediately with a sign listing all their craft beers in their first room. Craft brews from as far reaches as Portland, Maine or as closely hidden as Santa Rosa they have great tasting brews from near and far reaches of the country! My personal favorite is the Allagash Curieux- this bourbon barrel aged ale seems to fit so well with the decor- it just works!\n\nThe second room is what my friends and I call the fun and games room! Why? Because the room is set up for as stated earlier- fun and games! There are huge tables with ample seats where those who come in for a drink can also grab some of their favorite board games to test their skills with their friends! To top it all off there's a bar in this room just 10 feet from the board games! So you can hang out and share a tasty drink in the front room or you can take it to the second room and test your wit and creativity with Cards against Humanity (my personal favorite game because I do better when I get more drinks from the bar in me; win -win!). \n\nLastly, what could make a night better than some good beer, cocktails, and board games? The delicious food! A must have any time I visit is their infamous Pork Belly \"Donuts\"/beignets- warm dough and pork never tasted so good while glazed over with maple bourbon syrup! Other favorites include their fried mac and cheese balls and the simple yet savory salt and pepper fries. \n\nBefore you finish the night off, remember to check out their pinball room since next to the board game room. I'm not sure why, but every time I go, I am compelled to play a round or two... when was the last time most of us can remember play pinball? Exactly. \n\nThe Willows is definitely a great place to unwind and hangout with your friends over some nice drinks and board game competition-friendly of course!

Pool table, board games, jukebox, and lots of large tables.  Really chill and fun vibe.\n\nThere's also two bars, one that's a fully stocked cocktail bar, and the other that deals only in craft beers.  I've never had a cocktail, but the craft beer selection is a lot of fun -- I'm no beer connoisseur, but I get a kick out of trying lots of random new beers.  The food is also pretty good, as should be expected from the team at The Sycamore in the Mission.  Burger and fries were excellent.\n\nService was great.  The bartender, an older guy with glasses, was friendly without being chatty.  They did forget my friend's burger, but apologized profusely, brought me out a new plate of fries, and bought us a round of beers.  Can't really stay mad after that.  :)", "author": "Matt Y."}

My friend and I got the arugula salad and pulled pork sando, which was THE BEST FRIGGING PULLED PORK SANDO I'VE HAD IN THE CITY. Not a pulled pork connoisseur, but I'd be willing to bet money on it. \n\nPlayed pool too, which was nice because it is a brand new table. The place was pretty dead at 8:30pm on a Saturday, but I know that won't last. The Willows is well on its way to be as reputable as its sister bar The Sycamore- however this will never happen until they find a bartender who can get people drinks in under 30 minutes.... If my rating were on service alone I'd give it a hard 2 and 1/2 stars, but I have faith that this is just one of those kinks that needs to be worked out over time. \n\nBe back soon!", "author": "Colleen F."}

Overall it feels like a solid bar. \n\nNegatives: It's around the corner from my office but we never eat there because the food is WAY overpriced for what you get. $10-$13 burgers that don't come with fries is pretty absolutely terrible. Paying an extra $5.75 for fries and an extra $1.75 for a \"flight of aioli\" is just plain stupid (especially when you don't just offer ranch dressing as an alternative to ketchup). Seriously, a burger and fries/aioli is $20!? I'd much rather go eat at Catheads as it is a much better deal and the food is way superior. $12 for pulled pork, Mac n Cheese, and a beverage. Seating in the back bar is pretty lame. Need more table space to set drinks down on while standing around.", "author": "KC F."}

Had a show nearby and it received 4 stars on yelp, so figured why not.  It was crowded, loud, and had very few seats.  We ordered the california and western burgers and pork belly donuts with fries.  My meal (california burger with fries and donuts) cost $26 and my friend's cost like $17.  We told ourselves these would be the most amazing burgers, especially given the price.  Neither burger was cooked medium, as advertised.  The california burger was so boring and flavorless, but I thought the western burger was ok.  The pork belly donut holes also weren't worth the $7 they cost.  I wouldn't come here again, the food was way too overpriced for what you got.

Solid menu, solid setup inside, solid beer selection, both tap and bottles(very nice sour selection and special reserve bottles) and solid weekly drink specials. Everything is spread out, pool table, pinball machines, board games, and a chill side bar area with an eclectic tap selection separate from the main bar and room. I ordered the lamb and fried chicken sliders, side of fries with a random white beer. First off the fries were lightly salted, peppered, and crisped to perfection. I love a good crispy fry. The lamb slider was super juicy and packed with flavor...the fried chicken slider was crispy with accompanying pickled red onions that gave it a good flavor ....makes me want to come back to try the southern fried chicken sandwich. The sliders are tiny but ordering two mix and match sliders with a side of fries was just enough. I could probably eat a dozen sliders in one sitting, each slider takes about 3-4 bites to finish. I would  suggest the menu have a set price for three mix and match sliders but non the less both were tasty. Did I mention they have pork belly donuts. Say Whaaat?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-24", "description": "The concept is cool: one bar for cocktails and then a bar for craft beer. However, the one time I went it was nearly impossible to order a drink from the beer side. The one bartender blamed it on lack of a second person, which I was fine with. But, when the second bartender came on it was no easier to get a drink. This was a slow Sunday early evening and there were maybe twenty people in the whole bar.\n\nThe food was pretty good. Cheaper than most places for a basket of fries and a sandwich. My partner got the sloppy joe and I got the pulled pork. Both just a bit above average and could really be quite exceptional if the bun quality was just a bit better. The fries were well seasoned with salt and pepper. Satisfying with beer, so I was happy.\n\nPork belly \"donuts\" were really disgusting and I love eating crap like this. First of all, they are not donuts. They are battered chunks of pork, fried and then put into a pool of syrup. They were also really over salted with big chunks of salt.\n\nTap list is a nice mix of imported and domestic beer, I am always pleased with a few things that pop up there weekly and have gone out of my way to come here to try some of them.\n\nThe board games are fun and on a slow day, it's a nice place to bring a few friends and throw a few back.

I like that the place is sort of split into two, with two bars, but it`s a little too loud to play board games in. I don`t know why I expected it not to be, when I drink, I apparently lose all ability to speak at a reasonable volume. However, the side where the board games and pool table are is louder than the other side, so we just took the games to the quieter side [ which has nice, cushy booths, so it`s even better.] There`s a pretty selection of games to choose from, I just wish that they maintained it better, because most of the ones we tried that came with paper/charts were filled by other people. A few things were also missing from the boxes, here and there. I had a sweet tea drink [alcoholic] and it was really good - not too sweet, which is perfect for me, but if you see the name and get it in hopes that it`s like McDonald's sweet tea or something, it`s not. \n\n3 stars for now, but if I come back sometime, I`d like to try some of the food, and then maybe I`ll add another star.

The front room has a nice selection of craft beer that is constantly changing. The back room has a full bar and a number of board games for any and all to play, as well as pinball machines, pool table and a jukebox. It's never too crowded whenever I've been on weekend nights and just a great place to hang out and get a drink.", "author": "Stephen C."}
