Since I started my new job, this has been my go to cafe for an iced vanilla latte or even a small sandwich. There's never a line and they are always ready to jump in and take your order. The prices are very fair and they have quite a big selection of fresh pastries on a daily basis. Just today I decided to try the tuna sandwich on rye bread and it was a good choice! The bread was toasted and not burnt, which is a common problem. The tuna was very fresh and chunky. The lettuce and tomatoes were also placed inside the sandwich and they were a great addition, without making the sandwich soggy. I paid around$7-$8 dollars and the sandwich was well worth it. I'll be coming back to try another one of their menu items, possibly a panini :D \n\nIf you're around the area and looking for a quick bite to eat, this is the place to go!", "author": "Julia K."}

That is what initially caught my attention. \n\nI got a small coffee ($1.50) which was extremely well priced for a nice cup of coffee. It had good flavour and tasted fresh. \n\nNote : The minimum card order is $1.00 which is very convenient too. \n\nThe interiors are designed to be a funky cafe full of books and plants. There was one lady at the counter making all the orders and she is very efficient, not much of a talker. \n\nIf you want coffee on the go or sit in a quirky space and enjoy it , this would be the place !", "author": "Shivani B."}

I have to drive here, so I'd only be out here if I had other things to do on Geary.\n\nI've been looking for cafes that offer pots of tea rather than a single cup. Cup & Cake easily has the best value. They give you a sizeable teapot, and if you ask, you can actually get some decent loose leaf teas instead of the tea bags. Plus, it's only $4! I ordered tea and a sandwich and stayed there for about an hour. I still had about half a pot left; I asked for a to-go cup and was pleased to find that half the pot could fit in a rather large cup. I also had to get a cupcake...because I mean, this place is called Cup & Cake! It was all right. Nothing to write home about.\n\nI imagine this place sees a lot of different folks in San Francisco, so to me it really felt like a nice little neighborhood shop. The cashier was friendly and the guy making my sandwich had a sort of quiet veneer about him.

There was a party of two talking a little loudly in the back, a mother and child waiting on sandwiches, and few other customers scattered around the cafe. \n\nI ordered a breakfast bagel with ham, egg, and cheese on an onion bagel and a small hot chocolate. The breakfast bagel was very delicious, a little bit too much pepper (I didn't mind it much), and was the perfect size for a small lunch. I was surprised by how many different bagels they had and their selection of treats from huge cookies to a variety of refrigerated drinks. The hot chocolate stayed extremely hot for an hour! By the time I tried it, it was not overly sweet (unlike what you would find at starbucks, for example). \n\nOverall, would definitely visit again if I was in the area!

No thanks to my caffeine-addicted ass, I had a strong Breve Latte from the Peet's in the neighborhood and lo and behold, the strong urge created by something potent as a diuretic kicked in when I was walking with the fellow down Geary for a little photo opportunistic romp.\n\nFirst off the fast food joints located on this strip of Geary have absolutely no public restrooms, probably due to the fact that the homeless/drunk partygoers would make a mess and take advantage of the free paper towels/dryers/water there.  Second, where are the typical Starbuck/Peet's cafes here?\n\nSo it was only a matter of time that my nervous ticking calmed down a bit when we came upon this establishment, located right on an open corner.  The interior is long and mostly filled upfront with either students or locals looking to read a book over their drinks and chat quietly amongst themselves.  The chairs here are like the smoking chairs found in old school clubs where only men are allowed: wide, cushioned and gone in sixty seconds if you don't lay claim to it immediately.\n\nThe shop seems to be run by a local family, kind and cheerful.  I ordered an iced tea, in order to make up for my ignorance in drinking a vat of coffee prior to going on a walk AND for utilizing their facilities.  Apparently, there were more choices available for my generic iced tea.  The lady requested to know which tea?  Wow.........I was able to choose from the ten varieties of tea on the shelf, but I'm simple: Breakfast Black Tea.  Brewed and then after asking me about the amount of ice I preferred, she made it to perfection.\n\nDelightful glassed display of cakes/pastries (probably brought in by an Asian bakery), bagels/sandwiches made to order........and simple drinks with a decent price tag attached to them.\n\nLocal, unpretentious, a wide space, lots of seating with comfortable chairs, good ice tea (I'll be back to try their other items) and great customer service.\n\nEasily, a 5 star rating  : )", "author": "Miika M."}

The promise of free wi-fi and panini sandwiches brought me to the new Cup & Cake Caf\u00e9.  Cup & Cake - the name makes me think of cupcakes.  They have muffins, croissants, cookies (by Ultimate Cookie) and slices of cake (princess, strawberry shortcake, carrot, etc.) for sweets.  For savory goods, they have breakfast bagel sandwiches, deli sandwiches and panini sandwiches (3 types: turkey pesto, chicken pesto, ham).  \n\nThe caf\u00e9 only occupies half of the space; the other half is not being used.  The walls are a warm yellow, the leather chairs are quite comfortable and there are a few electrical outlets within reach.  The owners (Asians) seem to like plants (orchids in particular).  The free wi-fi is secure, so ask for the password when you place your order.  The clientele is decidedly mixed - from teens to older Chinese.  \n\nI had a medium latte ($3.45) and a chicken pesto panini ($6.95) served on a plate.  The latte wasn't so good.  The brew tasted like it was made with over-roasted beans; it had a bitter, burnt aftertaste.  The panini sandwich made with ciabatta bread was better but it didn't have much pesto flavor.  The mayo flavor was stronger.  Also, pieces kept falling out the sandwich which I find very annoying.  They did add a nice amount of fresh veggies - cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions.  It was made to order and they used roasted chicken pieces (dark meat only I think).\n\nIf you park in the neighborhoods, the time limit is 2 hours.  Restrooms available.

This was a little bit after 1:30 pm (after the crazy lunch madness) but the line was 3-people deep.\n\nAfter waiting in line for a bit, I found out why there was a line to begin with.  It appears the owner is sort of a micro-manager.   He was practically breathing down that poor cashier's neck to make sure she rang up the orders correctly and made the right change.  They have a standard cash register that actually tells you what the change will be (I grew up in a world where you had to figure out change yourself -- using your head!  Yes I was in food services as a teen).  It's not like those fancy registers in Starbucks etc.  That poor cashier was so flustered.  I'm sure she can perform better without the constant oversight.\n\nWhen it was my turn to order, she rang me up correctly but before she can give me change (I gave her $10 for a $8+ bill), micro manager, says \"wait\" and he proceeds to look over her shoulder to see if she rang me up correctly.  I think that is really rude.  If you don't trust your employee, then don't hire them!  Deduct one star for being a damn register Nazi.\n\nI ordered a ham panini.  The panini took about 10 minutes to make.  I was beginning to worry that they forgot about me.  The lady behind the deli finally brought my order to my table.  They just threw the panini on top of a piece of wax paper on a cafeteria tray.   No plate, nothing.  This works if you order at a donut shop and even a take out dim sum place but when you're striving to be fancy schmancy, the presentation is tacky.  I'm not going to complain because they are new so the tray is somewhat clean.  However, if they stick around long enough, they may consider serving the sandwiches on a plate.  I doubt a lot of these places actually wash the serving trays.  Deduct one star for the tacky presentation.\n\nHow's the sandwich?  The ham panini was actually really good!  Lots of meat, red peppers and cheese.  The panini was also served hot.  Yummy yummy!  One of the best panini's I've eaten.\n\nThey also serve various pastries and faux Starbucks drinks as well (frappe, etc.).\n\nCafe was nice and airy.

He interrupted & corrected me that it couldn't have been them because they've \"never made cakes\". Huh? I distinctly remembered the storefront, the cross streets and of course remembered the cake. Instead of moving on, he continued to debate it which rather put me off. The customer may not always be right, but don't argue with them just to make a point, right? I had to insist we change the subject. \n\nI ordered two dozen cupcakes, chocolate & vanilla. He asked if I wanted \"Happy Birthday\" written across them and I said yes.

The world of cupcakes I grew up in is NOT the cupcake of today. I now understand that $3 for a cupcake is the going rate. However I'm not a Marina Mom. My sensibilities will not allow me to spend $76 on cupcakes for a classroom of Kindergartners who would be wearing half of them down the fronts of their shirts. \n\nI went to Trader Joe's, bought a large box of chocolate cupcake mix and another box of frosting mix.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-30", "description": "Giving this place more than three starts is beyond my comprehension, and my opinion has been formed over the course of many months studying here.\n\nPros: \n-It's convenient to my place (adjust according to your actual distance to Cup & Cake Cafe)\n-There is always seating - even if it is the bizarre unfinished back half of the building where the chair/table height ratio is completely off. Sit back there and imagine what it would be like to live as a dwarf.\n-Classical music at all times. You are not subject to the whim of a barista's mood (and often terrible taste) in music as at most coffee shops.\n\nCons:\n-I spent countless hours studying here and always consumed about $5 of food/drink per 3-4 hours, yet the owners acted like they'd never seen me before every time I walked in.\n-The coffe is marginal. It's passable, but beware anyplace where a small americano is made with a single shot.\n-Pastries, cookies, etc. are hit or miss - sometimes very fresh, sometimes clearly past their prime.\n-It is either like a solarium (huge windows) or a freezer (huge windows) in here at all times. Dress in layers.\n\nWalking just a few blocks you have:\n-Earth's coffee (1 block - substantially better coffee and friendlier service)\n-Velo Rouge (a bit further, but verifiably GOOD coffee, good food and friendly service)\n-NOW quite close one has 50/50 (east on Geary) which is the hands-down cafe winner in the neighborhood.", "author": "r g."}

The friendliness of the staff and price of the lunch-sandwiches ($5-8) doesn't overcome the just-adequate food. \n\nThe Long Story: \n\nIt's been a while since this place first opened, and I've held out hope - but reality doesn't always come out to what we cross our fingers for. \n\nI've relegated this lunch option to the \"Damn, I really don' t have time for anything except what's real close, and I had a burrito yesterday AND the day before.\" \n\nIf you find yourself here waiting for whatever is next on your agenda, I can still recommend the scones and the chicken panini with some sense of confidence. \n\nThe latter sandwich is going to take some time, so perhaps get an adequate coffee... I am more of a tea fan, but the loose leaves in the glass jars have been there since my initial review. \n\nOn the plus - there is plenty of space to sit down and spread out. If you want a private conversation, go sit in the back... it's practically a full block away from the counter and the rest of the store. \n\nLastly, and this may be the biggest plus for some - but the folks that run the place really are quite nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "Okay. I'll admit it. I'm a skank for free internet. \n\nThe promise of free wifi at a cafe can make me travel across town in order to avoid paying hourly internet charges and causes me to instead spend the money on gasoline, which, when I look at it, is simply trading one payment for another. Wow, what retarded logic. Thank god I'm not in finance.\n\nThe fact that I think about this in such a rational sense is no doubt spurred on by the double shot of espresso that Cup and Cake Cafe has poured into my strong coffee. Coming in 3.95, the red eye better be strong. It does what any strong coffee does and that is, makes my breath smell and require curiously strong mints. Wonderful litmus test if you ask me. \n\nA house coffee costs 1.50, 1.75, and 1.95 for the S/M/L sizes and you can get flavored espresso shots for .50 extra. Cup & Cake Cafe has a very broad selection at moderate prices, enough to compliment any coffee drinker's nummy desires. They have an assortment of cup cakes (they appear store bought), mousses, cheesecake, muffins, croissants, bagels, cookies, and even red velvet cake. They even make sandwiches and paninis. I had a white chocolate hazelnut cookie and my companion, a chai. Both were decent..\n\nBut back to the free wifi. The wifi I drove across the bridge for, in short, is spotty and intermittent. In fact, I lost about an hours worth of work because I could not save what I was working on (SasS drawback). This translates to redoing work. \n\nI am not a fan of losing work because I'm a lazy bastard. I'd rather do something right the first time so I don't have to redo it. I've used this line in job interviews. Try it. It works and speaks as a testament to your quality of work. \n\nSince that was the case, I concluded that if you want to simply browse on the computer while enjoying a relaxing afternoon, then this is a good place for you. However, if you are actually doing work, the dropped wifi signal will frustrate and pwn your calm collected attitude, causing you to want to run out and frag everything in sight. \n\nLuckily, the only victims will be baked goods.", "author": "Jason C."}

We care here for the purpose of getting some cake. It's a cute neighborhood cafe' that has a older couple (Korean?) working there. We got there around 7:30pm and it had like 2 tables filled up. Not really packed at all. They close at 9, so probably people who actually want to study go to somewhere that closes later. It's actually a pretty big space..a couple of TV's, sofa's, chair's and tables. Nothing really matches here at all. But its comfortable and homely looking. Bathroom was clean, so that's def a plus! \n\nOn their menu they have a variety of sandwiches and drinks - both tea and coffee. I came here for cake - so I looked at their selection of desserts - which wasn't bad, but wasn't great. They have different kinds of cakes, pies, mousse cakes, cookies, and eclairs. I ended up getting a slice of their strawberry creme cake and a slice of tiramasu both $4.50 each. The cakes were pretty good - all very fresh tasting, and very moist. It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't bland and dry. Both were very yummy - tho I gotta admit the tiramasu was probably my fav out of the two! \n\nThey have free wifi, and the place is quiet. Not noisy like some other cafes or coffee shops can be. It's a pretty big space, so its easy to get somewhere to sit. Plenty of street parking at night too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-03", "description": "I love this place! It's a mom and pop cafe, simple drinks (coffee, latte, italian sodas), simple food (sandwiches, pastries), CLEAN, and a nice place to chill with friends. The owners are really sweet. They used to run the liquor store on this site, but decided that it would better serve the community as a cafe.\n\nDon't be such haters, people. I don't understand why some of the reviewers post low ratings just because the place is not what they expected it to be. There are no pretensions or false advertisements at Cup and Cake claiming to be something else (trendy, foodie, etc). It's a cute neighborhood coffeehouse. Take it for what it is.", "author": "G K."}

It's no foodie delicacy, but I love one of these babies when I'm hungry, hung-over, and dreading going to work. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm going to get fat if I eat them every day so I try to keep it as a treat for Fridays. Or Mondays. Or as was the case this week, Monday and Thursday? Whatever. It's that yummy. And the coffee I get with it is great!\n\nThe staff is always friendly, greets me the second I walk through the door, and the service is prompt. \n\nLastly, this place also rocks because I am usually disorganized, and will occasionally come in with NO cash and pay for a coffee ($1.50) with a credit card and they don't get annoyed with me. They're that fabulous. I love Cup and Cake!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

What's with that? Learn how to make a simple coffee drink! Needless to say, I did not enjoy my drink.  Total waste of $2!

I had a ham and swiss cheese sandwich at this lovely new caf and it was exactly up to my expectations. Big sandwich, fresh bread, clean cuts of meat. It was all good.\n\nI'm a big fan of small establishments where you can see where the money that you drop goes to, instead of these huge corporations all over the place. That's a big plus for me, and this place feels good \n\nAt least one of the owners was in presence when I went in the first day of their business. Really friendly people. There were flowers in vases, the place was clean and well kept. The staff at the counter was understandably jumpy the first day, but the food was wholesome and good. \n\nThe chairs were comfy, you could sink into one and read a book if that's what you wanted to do. Also on that note there are ceiling to knee windows that allow for lots of natural light, no fluorescent glow during day light hours. Free wifi. Hot drinks. \n\nGo check it out if you're in need of a good filling meal and you're in the area. \n\nI might see you there.\n\n\"d\".", "author": "d s."}

Now, to you, this may mean that I was getting in my car with the destination of home in mind and that's where I'd go directly. \nBut you'd be wrong my Friend. I can't leave the city in one shot. For me, it just can't be done. I've got to fully utilize that Bridge Toll and see what I can see. \nAnd that is how I went from O'Farrell & Mason clear to Ocean Beach.\nI knew that I wanted some coffee, and I knew that my errand was in no way that innocent. I was on the hunt for sweets and I was gonna get 'em come hell or high water. \nSo, I wandered and drove where the road took me, which happened to be a delightfully named little cafe with the promise of Cake, right in the title! datswhatimtalkinbout. I skipped on in (yes, that's how much I love the sweets) and ordered my black coffee and the cranberry oat flapjack. Oh, and hey the pecan bar for my.... Mom. Sooo not for me. God, how dare you insinuate gluttony on my part. Asshole.\nPlace is cute & clean, in a great neighborhood and has a lovely selection of well, cake, yeah and cookies and the like. I noticed that they can whip you up a nice sandwich or wrap as well. I cannot, ever, never pass up a pecan bar. This one is THE ONE. The fact that it was for my Mom lasted about 1 minute 37 seconds. \nOh, the Pecan Bar. Bottom was a shortbread crust, middle a caramel chewy decadence with pecans throughout and on top. Honestly, they had me at the shortbread crust, but those pecans were perfection. toasted, crunchy and beautifully showcased in the salty, sweet caramel middle. Mmmm. I actually tried to put it away about half way through and show some self-restraint for God's sake, but seriously, who the hell am I trying to kid?\n\nNow, what is a cranberry oat flapjack? Well, allow me to enlighten. In Europe you will find a cookie-like yummy that is eaten at breakfast, as a snack or in my case, as my breakfast dessert. It is toasted oats with either a honey or caramel binder and you can mix in whatever you wish, almonds, pecans, dried fruits - in this case, cranberries. Oh, this was awesome as well. Chewy, nutty and honey flavor with the sweet & sour of the cranberry, I loved it. Perhaps a little on the sweet side, but hey, that WAS the mission, after all - lest we forget. \n\nThe Girls in there are helpful, nice and speedy but shit, even if they weren't, I'd be back like that fo some mo", "author": "Katie W."}

Immediately, I noticed their cutie cakes and sweets, like the heart shaped mousse cakes.  I decided to get one and a slice of red velvet.  After going to lunch (to which they waited in the car), the cakes were yummy and not \"melted.\"  The red velvet was delicious- it was thick, almost like a pound cake, but was very good with the light cream cheese frosting.
