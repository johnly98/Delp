The next table over had ordered it, and it seemed like a large plate of diced, sauteed chicken with soy sauce, bamboo shoots, ginger, nuts, etc., and it looked really good. So I got it with steamed rice. I also asked for it to be made spicy.\n\nAnd let me tell you this: it was the best kung pao chicken I have ever had, period! The portion and the flavor were absolutely fantastic. Priced at $12, I thought it was a good deal. If anything, I would say that they should not be charging extra for the steamed rice, which they did, which is why I am giving them 4 stars. But definitely worth trying. I also noticed that they serve individual dishes, and not have everything bunched together under a 'lunch special' menu, as most Chinese restaurants do.

They do have a disclaimer that the dishes are spicy as this style of cuisine is, so be aware of that when ordering and make sure to notify them if you want mild.

The food between the different locations is consistent and the dishes are tasty. It's a certain kind of spicy, not daly hot but quite flavorful. On a recent visit to this location, we got there at 5pm, when they opened for dinner and there were about two other tables there. The servers were still vacuuming and setting up for the evening so that was a tad annoying. It was a Monday night and when I called on Wednesday, they assured me that it would be a slow night and I wouldn't need reservations for a party of 7. It also meant I could have any pick of a round table and it would be quiet enough for the meeting I had planned except for the loud vacuuming. For dinner, we started off with the Mu Shu Soup for the table and it was filled with chunks of tofu and veggies such as spinach. The broth was very flavorful. Then we shared a family style meal of Green Beans with Shrimp, Stir Fried Broccoli, Chicken Chow Mein,  Shredded Pork, Mongolian Beef, and steamed rice. All the dishes were tasty and the portions were just right. Each dish had its own unique flavor and variety of fresh ingredients. For seven of us, we each spent only $16 and that includes tip! It seems a little crazy we got away with full bellies for so cheap in the FiDi/SOMA. All the dishes were tasty and the portions were just right.", "author": "Jen L."}

The best thing we got was the white rice - it had more flavor than any of the dishes! No joke, they used the same four ingredients in every single dish. Green bell pepper, onion, bamboo shoots, and flavorless generic sauce. While this kitchen prides themselves on spicy, what spice? They even had, what I would call, a white people menu that said \"for those that don't like red hot chili flakes.\" Why was their \"spicy\" a white people spicy? I'm terrified for what the white people menu tasted like. This is a Hunan kitchen, are you kidding? I said spicy, not white people spicy - get outta here! They got me fucked up that the kung pao beef tasted exactly like the marinated vegetables.\n\nTheir menu had a big \"no MSG\" symbol on it, but really what it should have said was \"no spice or flavor.\" I would consider this place a misdemeanor crime but after they don't even give you fortune cookies - heinous felonious criminals!! Lol\n\nI will not be back, ever.\n\nIn a nut shell: No spice. No flavor. No fortune cookies. No good. No returning.", "author": "Gina G."}

This unassuming location offers a large dining area outfitted in the customary Chinese decor with space enough for several simultaneous large parties. I understand that it get's very crowded during the lunch-rush and after this experience I can see why.\n\nYou're Welcomed: Friendly staff greet and seat you based on availability.  Since this was a late lunch we were the only persons in the entire restaurant dining and therefore we had our pick of the room.\n\nSimple enough, Good food:  The food was really very good.  We decided to order our favorites (why mess with a good thing?): Kung Pao Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Though spicy the beef had just the right amount of heat to it.  The chicken was sweetened just enough for you to enjoy the tender meat without being overwhelmed by a thick, syrup that I've become used to at other establishments that I've been to.\n\nBang-for-the-Buck:  Very reasonable prices for the amount and taste of the food.  You will definitely appreciate the quality, quantity and the price your pay for your meal.  Best to bring a large group so you can also sample everyone's order.\n\nThe Long-and-the-Short:  If you're ever in the downtown area, craving some good Chinese food, and don't have time to make it over to China town, come here for lunch or dinner.  You may have to do a little hunting and pecking to find the door, but it will be well worth the effort.  \n\nYou MUST eat here!", "author": "Philip T."}

First off, we wanted to go somewhere cheap but not quality wise. Second, we didn't want to venture off TOO far from Downtown San Francisco. Also, we both didn't have a chance to check Yelp for any good places around, so we did something DARING, we just wandered around until we found something good.\n\nWe first went to Kyo-Ya, because her GPS system recommended it, but saw it was a bit out of price range. As we were ABOUT to head to Tempura House, we found this hole-in-the-wall and debated about it for a while. She did ask me if Chinese food was okay, and I flat out said, \"I'll eat anything, just to get Yelp review.\"  And so we took our chances.\n\nAt first glance, we thought it was PRETTY dead, until we got seated in the back, which had a decent amount of people at tables. Taking our chances again, we ordered the Hunan Velvet Chicken (I decided on this dish because of the vegetables and \"velvet\" drew me towards this) and the Hot and Sour Pork (my friend is always in the mood for hot and sour entrees). Also, we ordered the onion cakes, because my friend wanted one.\n\nMy friend did ask me how the decor was. I said that it has a cozy atmosphere, a bit grungy, but cozy, even with the steel pillars running perpendicular to the floor made it cozy. Also, she did point out the fact that the kitchen was in plain view, with nothing blocking the way of how the chefs made our dishes.\n\n- The onion cake (yes, CAKE, not cakes) was different from what I'm used to, a more brown deep-fried style pancake, with very little spring onion popping out from the skin, but more buried within the layers. Tasty, but kind of wished it came with a dipping sauce. (It might be a Hunan region thing, but I'm not 100% sure).\n\n- The velvet chicken had an interesting taste. The veggies that came with it was delicious, but the chicken itself was kind of bland. Kind of wished that the chicken was marinated beforehand with the sauce that the dish came with; would have made the dish better.\n\n- The hot and sour pork was mixed. My friend said that she didn't like it so much, because it was deep fried a bit TOO long. At first, I didn't noticed it, since I'm LOVE fried things (like tempura, donuts, french fries, etc.) but I did see where she was coming from. The pork was left in the fryer a bit TOO long, because I did taste some burnt pieces here and there. Sauce was good, and plenty of veggies.\n\nI do like the fact the waiters were attentive, asking how our meal was and offered to refill our rice bowl when it gone empty.\n\nPrices were a little bit on the higher scaled, in comparison to what I'm used to in Los Angeles, but I do understand that San Francisco tends to be a bit more expensive.\n\nSomething that I don't see everyday, the fortune cookie is in a jar, and you have to use tongs to fish one out. My friend and I got one, and was surprised that it wasn't under or over baked. However, it could from the place they get their shipment from, not because they make the cookies themselves.", "author": "Tom T."}

We asked for spicy oil and were told no, they only have the Vietnamese Sriracha -- o.k., but isn't this a Chinese restaurant?

I am ill. It was not anyone's fault per se, but nevertheless I cannot recommend their restaurants to other people who cannot have gluten.\n\nWhen I placed my order, I asked whether a certain dish could be made GF and the waiter said that it could. He said, \"no soy sauce or black bean sauce, right?\" And I said that i assumed that was the case unless they used wheat-free soy sauce. He said, \"no problem.\"\n\nThe problem was realizing that I needed more veggies with my meal. I hadn't ordered any of my own and the Henry's Special was mostly protein, which is normally a huge plus. I asked him if the string beans we already had on the table were safe for me to eat.

Can you imagine 45 minutes later, no food? I was furious but nobody really cared.  I asked the wait staff about it and no one knew what's going on. The waiter who took my order was helpless and the waitresses were equally clueless. They walked past my table many times and nobody even checked on my order.  When a customer has been sitting at a table for 45 minutes with no food. What does that mean to you? Your job is to wait tables. Nobody offered me any solution after a 45-minute wait.

Yes, I know it's a controversial upgrade, and I am willing to take the slings and arrows of those unfortunate snobs who have dismissed this place for lent. What tipped me over was an unexpected dish, the $8.75 Polish Sausage Hunan Style - perhaps the most inauthentic concoction ever served in a Chinese restaurant. Who cares? It's greasy good in a Top Dog meets Yank Sing sorta way. Know what I'm sayin'? \n\nWell, we already know the $6.95 Diana's Meat Pie is about as Chinese as Charlie Chan in an opium den. It's one of the best tostadas you could possibly have outside of the Mission, although I have to remember to pick up some salsa from Taco Del Mar across the street the next time. Between Henry, Howard and Marty having their namesake specials, I was starting to think this was the West Coast outpost for Katz's Delicatessen, but alas, I think they're mostly hotter-than-the-hinges-in-hell kung pao dishes.\n\nRegardless, I just couldn't sleep tonight until I gave Henry's the extra star for their anything-for-a-buck sorta-Hunan dishes. Sure, it ain't David Chang. It ain't even Charlie Chan. Henry's Hunan is like the Kathy Griffin of Chinese restaurants. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...yes, Sophie didn't have a tougher choice than having the Polish Sausage over Diana's Tostada Greasepool...I mean, Meat Pie \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...well, it still needs a few more gongs \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...getting better, not sure why \nTOTAL - 4 stars...this is not a Polish joke", "author": "Ed U."}

Go to the other locations at like Bryant St or Church St.\n     I've been going to this location for 16 years.  Our office was across the street I'd go with my co-workers once a week for at least 8-9 years until we moved offices.  I'd also take family from out of town periodically on the weekends.  I go less often now to this location, maybe once a year after a meeting at the office.  I usually order take out from the location on Bryant street on my way home.\n    I had family from Los Angeles come for the weekend and I was excited to introduce them to Henry's Hunan.  So I've noticed that the quality at this location has diminished.  We ordered Hot and Sour Chicken, Marty Special and Curry Chicken.  All three dishes seemed to be a lot greasier than I remember, like extra greasy.  The chicken had a few pieces that were rubbery, the dumpling seem a bit hard/stale.  Two of the 5 tea cups were dirty.  My chopsticks had old food that seemed to be fused on it.  And the forks probably have never been changed they were misshapen and look like the same one from 16 years ago. \n    So here's the worst service I've ever experienced in my 20+ years of eating out.  We're finishing eating, I get up to ask for the check so my family from Los Angeles doesn't beat me it.  I pay at the front via credit card and leave $0 tip since on the credit.  I always always leave the tip in cash, since I figured if the tip is paid via the credit card the waiter has to report that exact amount on their taxes etc, and if I leave cash they can report what ever they want.  \n    Anyway, I always leave a minimum of 15%-20% even on bad service.  I go back to sit down with my wife and family from out of town. We are still chatting and they're drinking their tea.  A minute or two passes when the bus boy comes up and scans the table, I figured he is going to take the empty plates or offer us refills on the tea or water, but no he interrupts our chat to tell me \"Tip's not included\" I'm a bit confused for a second and respond with \"Oh, yeah I know\"  he just nods and repeats the exact same thing 3X!!!! \"Tip's not included\" I reply \"I know\" each time more and more bothered at his insinuation that I'm gonna stiff them on the tip in front of my wife guest.  I went up to the owner to complain which I never never have done.  I told her that I've frequented that location for over 16 years and I always leave the tip in cash and that I've never had something like that happen.  She said sorry, and said she would tell him.  \n   So I made a yelp account just to post this long post about my experience, since it's been bothering me since Friday.  The waiter/bus boy has been there for many years and I don't expect him to recognize me since I went less and less frequently but man was he rude and out of line.  Am I over reacting?  I've just never been confronted by an employee and especially in front of family and guest.  So Rude.  I'm debating on whether or not to post my story on my YouTube channel with 500k subscribers.  An apology from the waiter or a formal apology from the Owner would be nice.\n\nbtw, yes I still left a 15% tip even after that experience.", "author": "Juan P."}

Went there around 12:30pm today and ordered the beef stew noodle soup with no onions. When my order came, there were onions.  Mistakes happens, I understand... I told the sever to take it back since I requested no onions. She said, \"You take it out.\"  I explained to her that I was allergic and I can't eat onions. She had the audacity to say, \"Just take out\" then she walked away. I tried to get the manager, but I wasn't able to flag anyone down for the next couple of minutes. I got tired of waiting and begrudgingly tried to remove the onions. Part of me hoped that I'd fall on the floor with respiratory problems.. but they'd probably shove me under the table.

But coming from Chicago, where a trip to our Chinatown (1/8th the size of San Francisco's) ranges from 4-star Hunan & Schezwan dining to Fear Factor-style dives, Henry's Hunan isn't too bad.\n\nIt's also a retreat from the Moscone Center crowd which tends to only venture beyond a 2-block radius with the assistance of a local.  I found the place back in 1999 and have returned every year during MacWorld Expo.\n\nI stay clear of iffy dishes and stick with the easy stuff.

On a scale of 1 to 10, this would be only a 3 to 4.  \n\nMy own complaint is that Henry's Hunan caters to Western people as their menu's are only written in English and not in Chinese characters, which is a real dis-service to Chinese people.  \n\nBTW, our family started eating at their establishment when it was located on Kearny Street in Chinatown, and when they used to have Chinese menu's.  Years before James Beard wrote a column and put the Hunan Restaurant on the map.\n\nAlso, each of their four locations are operated and owned by different members of the family.

So, how to describe it: I guess it's a Chinese pancake of some sort , though it seems like a tortilla to me, and with ground beef, lettuce and some kind of spicy sauce, it's kind of like a layered Chinese-American taco. I can only explains it's appeal as nostalgia but I like it mighty fine...but just a wedge in enough. \n \nThe gang shared a hot and sour soup that all claimed was delicious. I had some of the of fat potstickers, plump little dumplings of pleasure.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-01", "description": "Henry's Hunan is what I considered a good example of Americanized Chinese restaurant. It truly is! They serve dishes that are authentically Americanized Chinese with a menu offering dishes like Kung Pao Chicken, hot & sour soup, noodles soups, rice plates, and stirred fried dishes of everything and anything you can think of - shrimps, vegetables, beef, pork, or chicken. Is unfortunate that this restaurant is within walking distance from my business and I had to visit it occasionally for office social functions. Of the few times that I've visited (shamefully and feeling guilty for betraying my grandmother's cooking), I've forced myself to put down food that I wouldn't ever ordered nor want to be seen entering the restaurant. I would indulge my fellow Yelpers who are looking for my feedback on the dishes from Henry's Hunan:\n\n- Meat Pancakes - 2 layers of deep fried flour pancake sandwiched with saut\u00e9ed ground pork and shredded iceberg lettuce. It was neither tasty nor exciting. 1 order yield 5 huge servings. If you are small eaters, request that they cut it into 6 slices and that should still be plenty for everyone. You don't need that much of boring food. \n\n- Moo Shoo pork with pancake - Ahh...the overseas Chinese will agreed that this dish is a popular dish in an Americanized Chinese restaurant and is a favorite on the menu. Thin slices of pancakes and hoisin sauce are included for you to scoop in saut\u00e9ed pork, shredded cabbage and mushrooms to make your own spring roll. \n\n- Hot & Sour soup - This is the only decent dish in my opinion. The soup is nice and hot (both temperature & spice) with lots of bamboo shoots, woodear fungus, tofu and have just enough sourness to wake up the taste bud. ($1 a bowl on the specials board for dine in only)\n\n- Green Beans and Beef saut\u00e9ed in black bean sauce - Green beans are always overcooked and came out mushy even though the beef slices are cooked perfectly. They just can't seem to get the beans out of the wok fast enough.\n\n- Kung Pao Chicken - nothing to brag about here except that if you can't take spicy food, ask for mild as supposed to spicy. I can't distinguish the chicken pieces from the other ingredients in this dish because everything is cut into same size and covered with the red flaming sauce. \n\n- Saut\u00e9ed eggplants with black bean sauce - the eggplants are literally covered with a layer of oil over it and the sauce under. It was greasy, bland and the eggplants so overcooked that it was literally \n\n- Tan-Tan Noodle - egg noodles topped with saut\u00e9ed ground pork and spring onions. The noodles are soggy and the meat mixtures is blend and too greasy. \n\n- Rice plates - Available with all kinds of saut\u00e9ed toppings. The dishes are generous serving (as if we are eating for tomorrow) with the rice piled high.\n\nThe taste of the food - after 2 dishes, everything tasted the same because everything is cooked or stir fried in the same bean sauce or spicy sauce and coded with a thick layer corn starch to thicken the sauces. Every dish is very heavy with the oil as if the chef worries that he isn't using enough oil to cook the food. I will say one admirable trait about Henry's Hunan is that they don't use MSG in their dishes unlike typical Americanized Chinese restaurant. \n\nIf you are looking to try authentic Chinese cuisine such as Cantonese style, Sze Chuan or Hong Kong style, you will not find it at this place. This will never be on my top 10 list of Chinese restaurants in the city to go for a meal. I know my faith for more Americanized Chinese food at Henry's Hunan is sealed so long I am working around SOMA, I know I will be visiting Henry's Hunan again for more office gatherings.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

I gave each of them a business card immediately, and told them I was ready whenever they had their requisitions funded.  Just like the gold mining business, there might not be gold dust in every pan of sand, but you keep panning.  You never know when it will pan out.  \n\nSo, we 17 each ordered a dish, and passed all of them around.  We pigged out on just about everything on the menu, and there was plenty of food left over.

Such fantastically delicious is the spiciness that the hunan house bean curd (say 25 times hot) offers that to call it the best in San Francisco understates the point.\n\nReligious allusions and allegories usually aid clarity. So, to flesh out this point with an allegory: when faced with religious epiphany, those so inclined are apt to speak of their god's glory, etc. - and not the relative merits of this god compared to the other gods, and thereby eschewing the \"first commandment\" in exodus wherein the ineffable god goes on record insisting upon being #1 and that everyone hold all the other gods as second fiddles at best.  Although widely criticized for this shrewd move (not least of all those looking to improve the fiddle section), it seems almost quaint now in its understatement and has over time garnered much praise (even among monotheists, to whom it clearly does not apply): Firstly, for its role in providing much-needed filler in what's become the top all-time top-ten list - The Ten Commandments, and secondly for its role in silencing dissent.\n\nSo, much like the religious experience trivializes religious texts, so too does such an experience at Henry's Hunan trivialize not only the claim to being the \"world's best,\" but renders such commentary irrelevant.\nSo, goodbye New Yorker\nand Hello Henry's Hunan!", "author": "ryan c."}

Only after asking did it come, and in that time, no one checked in on how we were doing, asked if we wanted more tea or water or offered an explanation.\n\nTo add insult to this injury, the table of 4 next to us was being constantly refilled with rice, water, tea, etc.\n\n* The second to last time I took someone there, we ordered the EXACT same thing; after waiting the standard Henry's 30 minute wait, the waiter brought our food to us. He handed me my plate, and then told my dining companion that the kitchen had made his with shrimp, not chicken like he ordered, and then asked if that would be OK.\n\nI was floored; it was like they needed a book to explain to them how restauranteuring works: \"See, there's a big book, with food you are willing to prepare for people; when your customers ask for that particular item of food, it turns out: that's probably the food they want! Asking your customers if they'll just take any ol' random crap you bring to them is... bad form.\"\n\n* Another time, I wasn't finished with my meal, and the table buser came along, and threw all of my food away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-19", "description": "Although I hear from all my Chinese friends that the food here is not \"true\" Hunan style, for the price I still feel that it's one of the best places to eat Chinese in the downtown San Francisco area. And as my family says, \"It is what it is.\" So get on line and enjoy their delicious food for what it is - Hunan or not.\r\n\r\nAnd let me preface this review by saying that I grew up on \"Chow Mein\" from Staten Island, New York in the 70's and 80's. And that I personally was very surprised to find that \"Chow Mein\" on the West Coast was a fresh noodle dish (no, I'm not kidding). Our \"Chow Mein,\" as it was called, was more like a soupy mix of onions, celery, sprouts, and pork strips which you would clump on top of a plate of rice and then sprinkle dry, short, Chinese noodles on top of. Like Chinese croutons of a sort. Anyway, I've come a long in the past 16 years and have become very picky about my Chinese food no matter what style it claims to be (Although I secretly am still curious about those dry, flat, crouton-like noodles and where I can get some).\r\n\r\nAnyway, as with any new restaurant I was a bit skeptical the first time I entered Henry's Hunan at 110 Natoma Street in downtown San Francisco. While waiting on the long line to get in, I read most of the plaques and awards on the wall but I stopped on one and squinted my eyes a bit. Then it registered, \"Oh my gawd! That's Don Johnson!\" WTF?!? Then the line moved quickly and we sat down at a large round table. The waiters are quick and there in minute or two and soon we were eating Spring Rolls and Dumplings. Minutes later, our food orders arrived and before we knew it we were nearly licking our plates trying to get just one more taste before we had to go back to work. It was a pleasant dining experience over all.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I've been eating at Henry's on and off for the past few years and here's the skinny on the place. First of all if you want to avoid the lunch lines you should go either before 12 noon or after 1PM. Parties of two usually get pulled quickly from the line and sat first, but large parties of five or more usually don't wait that much longer as the line moves pretty fast due to their large lunch room (notice I didn't call it a dining room; that's because it has more of a lunch room feel than an actual dining room).  \r\n\r\nOnce seated you'll probably wonder what you should order. For two people, I recommend splitting two appetizers and one entree as the dishes tend to be pretty hearty. That generally that will run you around $25 with tax and tip included. As for which appetizers definitely try the Hot and Sour Soup. It's pretty hearty and has great spicy undertones and a \"small order for two\" will get you both about two bowls each. The Spring Rolls are also a favorite of mine as they are made fresh and delicious. One order is three spring rolls cut in half (six halves). The Dumplings (6 served) are served more like pot-stickers, come in a mid sized bowl, and are also pretty darn good. I usually don't order the Onion Cake because I love the other three appetizers so much, but it is a favorite of many of my friends and so I get treated to it now and again. \r\n\r\nFor entrees I've had several Tofu dishes, Black Bean Chicken, and several variants of the Chow Mein noodle dishes (yes, I mean the good kind). But my two favorite dishes are the \"String Beans and Shrimp\" and the \"Shrimp & Chicken Chow Mein\". The String Beans and Shrimp has a spicy garlic and black bean sauce, isn't stingy on shrimp, and can pack quite a kick so I generally ask for it served mild so my mouth doesn't burst into flames or even worse; the lower part of my digestive track. However, the Chow Mein also has a little kick, but never anything to be worried about. And because I love Chicken and Shrimp above all things else in this great world, I just cut right to the chase whenever I order it. I have tried a number of other dishes and I think they are all pretty good. But in general I try to avoid the fried dishes like Orange Chicken or \"Sweet and Sour [insert meat type here]\" because they tend to be very heavy on the breading. But if you want a real professional view, check out Greasepig who has been visiting Henry's Hunan for years and has given almost every dish in the place a 10 point scale review http://greasepig.com/henrys/\r\n\r\nThere is one thing you should be aware of when you're in a group of three or more people. My friends and I believe that there is an ancient Chinese curse placed on one random person whenever you have more than two at your table. For some reason, almost every time a group of us goes, one lucky person always winds up waiting 10 or more minutes longer for their dish. To be honest, it may actually only be 5 minutes, but when you're hungry, and all your friends are stuffing their faces, and then you realize you're \"that person\", it feels like a heck of a long time.

For me that means going to other places rather then deal with the poor services and mediocre food.\n\nThough I would rather walk an extra block and eat at Canton Dim Sum & Seafood Restaurant , this is a restaurant that actually cares about its customers.", "author": "Joseph A."}

I feel Henry's is a unique restaurant in that they appeal to both fan's of American-chinese food (e.g. sweet/sour pork, fried rice, etc...), as well as fan's of more authentic chinese cuisines.  There's something for everyone and the dishes are tasty, if not a bit salty.  Might I add that what many consider to be salty actually comes from the bean paste sauce, used a lot in Hunan food.  To that end, it's a bit deceiving and gives customers the wrong impression that their food is laced with salt.\n\nThe trademark with Henry's is that their dishes seem, feel, and taste fresh...a farmer's market of meats and vegetables.  Dishes come out full of fire and flavor, not soggy and drowned out.\n\nI'd put these guys on a must try list.  Most 1-2 star reviews here pretty irrational.

The spice burns a bit unless you request \"medium hot\".  They have a great sauce and aren't overly oily like a lot of Chinese food tends to be.\n\nThen there are the dumplings - pork or chicken - I'll go with chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-24", "description": "I've been working in SoMa for three years, but I haven't ate at the restaurant that's just down a block away from me, at Henry's, though I'd heard plenty of praises for it. \"They have great chicken curry,\" says my friend, \"and we have it every Thursdays at work. It's been a tradition, I guess.\" My friend either really, really loves Henry's, or doesn't know any other restaurants around work. \n\nSo, here's a question: why is my friend so obsessed over Henry's that it makes him eat there, religiously, every Thursdays? Won't the food, uh, get boring after a while? Is the food at Henry's so arresting that it causes men to devote one -- one! -- day a week for Chinese food made only by a guy named Henry? (Well, nowadays, Henry's probably hasn't worked in the kitchen for a hella long time.)\n\nStepping into Henry's Hunan at the SoMa location on Natoma, I thought the place would be small, no bigger than B&M, the other Chinese restaurant by my work. But Henry's is huge, physically, and teeming in activity! Waiters frantically rush by you, holding trays of food and drinks in their hands while weaving in and out of the standing patrons; the large, loud open kitchen on the side of the room fills the restaurant with the chatter of Chinese cooks and the rumble of the woks over the flaming stoves; the loud discordant sound of silverware clanging against the plates and the deafening thumps of chopsticks hitting the white rice bowls.   \n\nThere was a line when we'd arrived at Hunan's, about 15 people ahead of us, but we were seated in less than 10 mins, thanks to Henry's spacious dining room filled with lots and lots of tables. Seated, we looked over the menu, found what we wanted, then waited for someone, anyone, to take our order. Five minutes passed. Then ten minutes. Still, nobody came to take our order as we sat there, speechless, at the the staff's oversight.\n\nFinally, a waiter, or maybe it was the busboy, walks by, takes our order, and runs off to the kitchen. About 15 mins later, the food arrives one after the other, each plate steaming hot, fresh from kitchen. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nGarlic Chicken:  The title gives this dish's flavor away: garlic, lots of it. Diced chicken covered in a soy and sugar sauce.The portions were generous, for sure, but the sauce was a overpowering. \n\nCountry Style Vegetables: A mix medley of vegetables of questionable quality. Soft and mushy, the country style vegetables was the least favorite of the dishes, simply because of the underwhelming taste, gross texture, and undesirable palette of soggy vegetables in sauce unidentified and mysterious to even its cooks. \n\nChicken with String Beans: Diced chicken in a soy sauce marinade served over a bed of crispy string beans. I loved this dish for the delicious string beans, not for the chicken, which wasn't that great. I wouldn't get this dish again, but I would order a dish solely for string beans.\n\nVegetarian Egg Rolls: Meh. Stringed vegetables including carrots, stuff, and other weird stuff, wrapped in a flour roll, flash fried until the outer layer turns a yellow or gold, whichever comes first. The title is a misnomer, though, since the there was no egg in this roll. Only vegies in a averagely made roll. Not worth the money, totally.\n\n I felt lethargic and tired after I'd ate the meal, like a lazy-ass sloth lolling in the trees. Of course, I'm the one to blame as I gorged my poor stomach on Chinese Food, spiking my system with excessively dangerous levels of MSG. Knowing full well that I may end up dead at my desk the next time I go to Henry's, would I come here again? Hrm, not really. The service is hit or miss, and the atmosphere is too noisy for a nice, relaxing hour on lunch. Takeout, perhaps? Yeah, I'll just get everything to-go, just like my obsessive friend.", "author": "Richard L."}

My grandma's from Hunan.   I know hunan food.  I'm skeptical, it being in the SOMA/financial district.  I check out some menus online and such, and... I see this dumpling in beef soup dish on the menu!  I'm so happy!  i haven't seen this dish in the states YET, as it's taiwanese street food.  Most people don't do it because the dumplings have to have a flavor that can match the beef stew flavor.  So I order it from henry's.  Pick it up and take it back to the office to eat it.  IT SUCKED.  Dumplings were standard boiled dumplings (would be OK by themselves), and DID NOT match the beef soup.  SOUP WAS GREASY AS ALL HELL  (\"Excuse me, I think you should have used 10W-30 instead of this 10W-50\"). HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP?!  At the very least, you just throw some beef stew on top of dumplings.  Beef stew was ALMOST CLEAR (should be a dark opaque brown), bland, with no chili oil.  BEEF STEW AND DUMPLINGS.  WTF?  I had to FORCEFEED the rest of it.  \n\nSo then a few months later, my boss decides to take us all out for lunch.  He chooses Henry's.  He knows my reservations about the place, and insists that I do all the ordering.  No problem.\n\nI sit down with the menu and try to piece together a meal for about 12 of us.  God this was some of the worst shit I've had in a long time.  I'm talking to the waitress in chinese trying to figure out stuff to order that would not make me puke.  I ask them for potato strands stir-fried with peppers (a hunan CLASSIC my grandma taught me).  nope.  I asked for a lamb chop.  nope.  I wanted to order a bean sauce (dou ban) whole fish to go with the meal, given the large amount of people, but they don't have whole fish.  At all.  And she looks very apologetic and explains to me that \"THEY DON'T MAKE FOOD FOR CHINESE PEOPLE\".  That was awesome, I couldn't believe she actually said the words!  She was hard pressed to find anything for me to order too.  I ended up just picking random crap after choosing a few decent looking dishes.\n\nEverything was way too greasy. Flavor balance was passable, spiciness was COMPLETELY LACKING.  The only dish that was not crappy was the hunan smoked/ salted pork belly meat dish (which was actually spicy too).  I would say it was actually decent.  Not enough to increase my rating though.   And the kung pao chicken was passable (read:  NOT HOT ENOUGH, but not too sweet, and at least there were no vegetables in it).\n\nSummary:  BAD AMERICANIZED CHINESE.  THIS IS NOT HUNAN FOOD.\n\nPlease.  Someone.  Open a real chinese restaurant in the financial district?  There are MORE than enough asians around to appreciate the REAL food!  The only one right now is Tea Garden.  But I get tired of eating their 3 varieties of taiwanese street food...\n\n(fyi, yeah I screwed up the first time and posted to another SOMA henry's location...haha)\n\n(edit 2008:  had to add a star back because at the very least, henry's is better than pile of shit house of nanking, piece of shit mandarin gourmet, and other shitty americanised chinese)", "author": "Fong L."}

There menu is small and nothing really unique.\nStill IT IS the fidi, so its not a bad place to go if you dont want to make that trek closer to Chinatown. The waitress brought us a giant mountain of rice (really wayyyy too much) and never brought us the brown rice we ordered--yet we were charged for it!

As for the food, we ordered ma po tofu, Henrys Special and Napa cabbage with prawns. The dishes all were tasty, shrimp super fresh, (Henry Special is a seafood combo with veggies) my primary complaint is that all seem to use the same base sauce.  Everything kind of has the same flavor.  Bill came to under $45 for the three of us.  I think there are better choices out there.

My high rating is for the combination of friendly, personal service and excellent food. \n\nSome of the diners here have given mercilessly low ratings that don't really give this place a chance to show what it can do. C'mon folks, Hunan food is a bit different than the usual Chinese fare. It's country style cooking. Also, the place is very busy during lunch hour, a testament to its renown but also it's a little hard at that time to get to know the family that runs this place.\n\nThe staff here, Lina (Frank's lovely wife), Kathy, Lorna, Rachel, Judy, and others will help you choose something to your taste, whether you want something that's intensely hot and sticks to the ribs, soup, seafood, or vegetarian. And if you have special dietary needs like I do, they'll do everything they can to meet them. If you show up at non-peak hours, they're friendly and will chat. Before I knew I had dietary restrictions, I tried many things on their menu but since then often bring my friends who can order freely (yes I do still taste my old favorites!) and they're still cooking to the same high standards. \n\nTry for instance Marty's Special, or some of their unique smoked dishes or the cold chicken salad or eggplant salad that are featured in Henry's Hunan cookbook. I also really like the squid with black bean sauce and an old favorite was the deep friend onion cakes. But everything's good. \n\nLet your needs be known, get to know this family, and they'll treat you like a welcome guest.

The chicken fried rice is so good and not greasy. #53. House Bean Curd Special is so yummy that people who don't normally eat tofu really like it. Diana's Meat Pie is excellent if you eat in. I'm not to thrilled when I've ordered it to go. The chicken salad is so tasty and refreshing. It comes with thinly sliced cucumbers and skinny rice noodles and lettuce.

Most dishes are on the spicy side and I love their chicken salad but we usually share multiple dishes as a group and I haven't had anything there yet that I didn't like. Try Henry's Special if its your first time. It can get crowded at lunch during the week so if you have a big group, call ahead.", "author": "Don O."}

The vegetables are always properly cooked... the asparagus dishes are a special in-season treat. Some advice: 1) Get there early. You'll get seated a lot faster, and your food will come out faster, too. 2) When they mean spicy, they mean it.

They also have $1 hot and sour soup for dining in and it hits the spot when its cold and ugly outside.  The front desk guy is awesome too, he knows my hubby and I by name and always greets us accordingly.  This is the one place I crave on the weekends and no one in the East Bay even begins to compete.

The best time to try this place would be during the afternoon, when the lunch specials are still in effect. The dishes are a little more expensive than I would like, so I only come here a few times a year, maybe. Everything I've tried here has been great. If you're gonna get an appitizer, I reccomend their Green Onion Pancakes, or if you're a carnivore, the postickers (dumplings) here are top-notch (I remember from back when I ate meat). If you work in the financial district, don't bother coming here unless you've got a full lunch hour, because it can be quite crowded on the weekdays.", "author": "Sean R."}

Ugh, what a mistake that turned out to be. First, like most people, I had to wait FOREVER in that relatively cramped entrance way because I was smart enough not to call in ahead and place my order. But that was no big deal, I was on my lunch hour. So anyway, I decided to order the chicken fried rice (which by the way was the best part of the meal, and the only way I am able to compose this review....or I would have starved trying). I also ordered the sauteed eggplant. This was absolutely horrible. The sogginess factor is not the worst part (as I have read in other reviews) it's the indescribable flavor that accompanies this mess. I like to be as spontaneous as the next person, but this was terrible. I kept wondering, what the hell is IN this? On the walk back to the office was when I knew it was all downhill. I kept smelling something \"really gross\" only to discover it was in the very bag that contained what was supposed to have been my lunch. My last dish was the orange chicken. OK, I get it....ORANGE chicken. But seriously, it was so overpowered by orange rinds that all I could really taste WAS the orange. Also, it was really REALLY sweet, which I don't like. My biggest complaint is that I ruined my rice by pouring the eggplant and orange chicken over it. How terrible an establishment must be when the only thing worth mentioning is the rice. I guess if you want to be brave like I was and try this place out for yourself, the only thing I can tell you is to steer clear from the orange chicken and the eggplant. You will be sorry if you don't! I would suggest B&M's eggplant chicken (without the chicken) down the street really. But as for me, I think I will stick to sushi from now on when I need my \"asian\" infused fix. Much healthier and at least I KNOW what I'm eating. Good luck....", "author": "Tiauna G."}
