Significantly less salt which I know a lot of other people prefer since you can't always just pile on the Sriracha on your own.

As a lover of Pho, I did my research and ended up Golden Star because it was a nice walking distance to my hotel.\n\nThe place is simple, there is a long communal table for 1-2 persons parties, and larger tables scattered around the place for bigger parties.  Being that I was by myself, I was seated at the communal table...and I loved every second of it.  As I was sitting down, the older Chinese (?) lady next to me was both slurping her Pho and clearing space for me and ushering me to sit down.  The genuine love and authenticity of her kindness is clear...for both her pho and the people around her.  \n\nI ordered the #1 Pho, extra large combo and it was perfection in a bowl.  The size is perfectly big...I didn't think I would finish it all until I took the first sip and fell in love with the broth.  Not too salty, just beefy enough and with a hint of lime...perfect!  The noodles were al dente (didn't know you could cook vermicelli al dente!) and stayed the perfect al dente the entire time it spent in my soup bowl.  The meats were sliced thin, but plentiful...I was still spooning out pieces of beef, tendon, meat ball and tripe and others throughout the entire time there.\n\nAfter I started eating, 2 older Chinese ladies sat down across from and tried to ask me in Cantonese which one I ordered b/c it looked so good to them!  Since I'm from Mainland China and only speak Mandarin, and they only spoke Cantonese, we ended up conversing briefly in English.  Turns out one took the bus 60 minutes away to come here to meet up with her friend to have Pho!  We had some brief conversations and my only regret is I wish I spoke Cantonese!\n\nCome here, and don't be put off by the communal table or simple surroundings, for the Pho speaks for itself.  And in this age of technology and exclusion, don't be afraid to smile and talk to your neighbor...you'd be surprised how warming human contact can be.", "author": "Christina D."}

I was surprised when the pho came out less than 10 minutes later! And before the appetizer, which is unique to me. The noodles were thick and piping hot with a giant plate of Evan sprouts, basil, and lime. Plus the bowl was giant so I knew I was having leftovers for the next two days.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-14", "description": "A hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese spot in Chinatown that was better than expected. Golden Star is next to a barbershop and across from a park. It had a typical, nondescript Chinatown storefront in between a row of other stores. I had their five spice chicken - very flavorful. It was one of the better made chicken dishes I've eaten at a restaurant in a while.\n\nIt was close to 3 in the afternoon. I was hungry and stumbled upon this place for a quick lunch. The design of the building and the storefront was mediocre at best. Large block lettering and a simple menu design helped me identify the place and the cuisine, but accomplished much less else. I guess the design fit in well with the rest of the street. But it definitely could do more to stand out.\n\nThe five spice chicken was advertised by the front door, and I ordered it because I was in the mood. To be honest, I did not have high expectations. My experience with restaurant chicken is that it's hardly better than chicken made at home, or fast-food places like Chik-fil-A. Usually not worth the premium. This time was different. The chicken was cooked very well with a tender inside and crispy outside. Portions were generous. The meat was cooked in a unique way that is not easily replicable at home. Overall, this place beat my expectations and I have now found a good, simple spot for chicken next time I'm in Chinatown. 4/5.", "author": "Chris W."}

It was delicious and satisfying. A similar lunch plate to this was their Com Suon Heo Nuong & Cha Gio which came with an imperial roll instead of an egg!

I mean there is the Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant, Golden King Vietnamese Restaurant and the Golden Star Vietnamese Restaurant all close to each other. After trying both Golden Flower & Golden King, I decided to finally give Golden Star a try. It is located on Clay & Walter U so it's in the heart of Chinatown and almost opposite to Golden King.\n\nAt the peak lunch hour on a Saturday the place was almost full, so it seems to the most popular among the three Golden restaurants. I decided to keep things simple and got the Five spice chicken noodle soup ($10.45) to-go. As expected I had to pay in cash as it was cash only. After ordering it was a short 10-minute wait and I was on my way.\n\nI got a bunch of boxes all neatly packed. There was a container for the broth, a small Chinese takeout container for the noodles and another small plastic box for the five-spice chicken. The noodles as expected were a little clumped but they opened up when dunked into the broth which had a nice clean taste. The five-spice chicken also had a very mild clean taste. The dipping sauce was also pretty good. My only complaint is that there should have been a greater quantity of noodles to go with the soup. Overall this was pretty good.\n\nPrice-wise it was in-line with what you would pay at other Golden restaurants in the area.

My friends pho had the same problem, except that we asked for no tripe and extra tendon and that request was blatantly ignored. The broth was almost non-existent, and lukewarm.

It was so bad that I signed up just to share it!!\n\nI was with my wife and our 3 teenage nephews. The server was pushy and had a rude tone the entire time... We all got different varieties of Pho Noodle Soup (it was not all that great, the broth was bland.) As we ate our food we noticed a worker constantly staring at us! We weren't the only customers in there! It was a very unsettling feeling... My nephews kept whispering to us, \"Why do they keep staring?\" We had no answer and told them to ignore it (which was hard to do!) When the server came to our table to ask if we'd like any bowls removed, he looked at wife's bowl and said, \"There's still a lot of noodles, you didn't eat all your food! Next time order small.\" How rude!  My wife felt like she had been scolded by a parent... \n\nThe WORSE part was after we paid for the food and they left the tray for a tip. At that time my wife was in the restroom, she had the cash for the tip with her. One nephew wanted to help out and put in 2 dollars. As we sat and waited for my wife to return with the cash to complete the tip, the server came over picked up the 2 dollars to count them! He then said in a rude tone, \"NEED MORE, PUT 3 MORE DOLLARS\" and walked away! My nephews and I were in shock. We were STILL SITTING, why on earth did he count the tip with us still there?! It WASN'T THE ENTIRE TIP. Once my wife returned I explained to her what the server just did. She said, \"What is wrong with this place?!\" At that point we all agreed we needed to leave. It was not right for him to TELL US how much tip. A TIP is a thing of gratitude for good service, it is NOT mandatory. My nephew was so mad he took his 2 dollars back and we began to walk out. The server yelled, \"HEY! WHERE IS THE FIVE DOLLARS?\" I was SO UPSET, I told him, \"We put $2 down and were going to put more when my wife came back from the bathroom. We DO NOT like the way you spoke to us and how you demanded more money.

The chicken was huge, but the rice was a bit too dry for his liking. \n\nAs for the service, it's pretty classic Asian service. Their attentive enough. They came over to refill water, take our plates / orders, and give us the bill. Oh, REMEMBER TO BRING CASH. Stopped by the ATM right before coming here. They speak a lot of Chinese, but do understand English. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come here again whether it be for the tasty egg rolls or the filling pho.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I grew up eating Golden Flower on Jackson st when I was young but haven't been back to them in a VERY long time. This time, i discovered Golden Star as I was in the area & based on yelp photos, decided to try it. I liked that they gave each person ordering pho their own plate of bean sprouts & stuff..i don't have to share my sprouts/basil leaves/jalapenos/lemon wedge w/anyone else. I ordered the #1 & although the bowl looked fairly small, it had quite some noodles in there. I couldn't finish the last 2-3 spoonfuls of noodles (probably the perfect sized amount for a growing boy). the beef broth/ soup was very clean. one of my dining companions ordered the five spice chicken noodle soup, i didn't think the five spice chicken was good. The grilled skin lacked a crispness to it. i don't think they 'air dried' it to pull out the excess moisture so it was kinda like eating soggy fat chicken skin (PPQ on irving does it better). other companion ordered beef ball & rare meat noodle, small looking bowl but it filled her up. and we shared the fried egg rolls..i enjoyed them, fairly standard..nothing to write home about. so 3 ordered plus 1 appetizer was $40.40 w/tax (not incl tip)\n\ni would go back if i'm in the area. the rice plates & BBH look delish...", "author": "Yolanda L."}

The guy attending to us made little jokes throughout our dine-in experience since he seemed bored standing around waiting on other guests that weren't Vietnamese. The other gentleman that also assisted just didn't smile nor talk much. \n\nThe food experience... Um. What the heck did they serve us if not the ga xa ot? Our server had to know what I wanted since he helped me with my Vietnamese pronunciation. I'm not a pro at this thing called cooking, but it did not look anything like spicy lemongrass chicken. My totally Viet friend also concurs in its lack of taste and appearance. Just take a look at my pic for yourself.\n\nMy bun bo xao was okay. The stir fried version is much tastier imo. You can't really screw this up either way so no further comments on this.\n\nMy friend's ca kho to was good. It took an additional 10 to 15 mins since it needed time to cook in the clay pot--totally fine. It didn't come (free) with rice. I mean. Are you supposed to eat pure fish by itself? This was an extra charge of $2 that wasn't stated on the menu. The price was simply $12 with no other explanation. Without knowing this, he ordered an additional small bowl of rice for another charge of $2. What the heck?! $4 added to make his meal $18?\n\nIt's just nice to know what we're being charged for and what we're consuming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-03", "description": "tl;dr - Cash-only and Pho-toshop is a mo-pho. \n\nStrange how one of the highest rated restaurants in the \"Heart of Chinatown\" is not a Chinese restaurant, but a Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nEven stranger? Portsmouth Square, where Golden Star Vietnamese Restaurant is located (GSVR), was the original site of San Francisco when it was known as the Mexican village of Yerba Buena which translates fittingly to \"good herb\". \n\nCarrying on with stranger things, I'll add one more tidbit, Montgomery Street used to be waterfront be-pho it was filled in and the Barbary Coast of San Francisco was located along Pacific Avenue between Montgomery Street and Stockton Street. \n\nSo, parking in Chinatown is a mess. Pho-tunately, GSVR is located adjacent to the 4-level underground parking garage known as the Portsmouth Square Garage. After riding the elevators up from the garage, proceed straight to Walter U Lum Place and turn left towards Clay Street and you will arrive at GSVR. \n\nGSVR has their menu plastered to their window. I was instantly drawn to the #17, the five-spice chicken with pho noodles ($11.35 with tax) because it had an amazing pho-to of this perfectly golden chicken next to a bowl of pho. \n\nLet me pause here and say, I usually laugh at restaurants that take crappy pho-tos of their food because it makes the food look unappetizing and they are better off not including the pho-to. \n\nConversely, when I go to restaurants and the food does not look like the pho-to, I think it's a lot worse. It's like meeting that Coffee-Meets-Bagel person pho the first time only to realize Pho-toshop is a mo-pho.  In that aspect, the food at GSVR looks nothing like their shiny laminated photos... \n\nPho-ck my life. \n\nI came alone to eat so they sat me at a table with another lone-eater I will call John because no, I did not ask him his name. At least it was a table pho 4 and not 2 because looking into a stranger's eyes would've been hella' awkward every time I came back up from slurping my noodles. \n\nAfter ordering the food, it literally came out in less than 5 minutes. I can understand the pho being easy to prepare, but when I saw the flaccid five-spice chicken, I was so sad. You see, this chicken looked like it was cooked when San Francisco was still Yerba Buena and simply re-heated. \n\nAs for the pho, the broth was good and the noodles were al dente. Perhaps I should have just ordered the beef pho? \n\nFour stars means \"Yay! I'm a fan!\" However, I felt that GSVR was just A-OK, since I've had better pho be-pho. \n\nRandom in-pho: \nIf you ever consider buying property in San Francisco, check out the maps provided by Priceonomics that shows areas that were built on reclaimed land so that you can  avoid them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-25", "description": "I've heard about Golden Star being the place to get a good bowl of pho in Chinatown and has been on my list to check out.  The opportunity came and I decided to go for it on a recent weekday afternoon. Getting there around 1:30, the restaurant was fairly full, yet I was able to get one of the single tables on the side.  There is a long communal table in the middle if you don't dining with fellow pho lovers.\n\nLooked over the extensive menu, but I had my mind set for a bowl of pho.  I usually get the #1 special, which is standard in most pho restaurants. Here it's called the Xe Lua / House Special beef soup noodle. It includes sliced lean beef, brisket, beef tendon, tripe and beef balls. Yes, you get your plate of fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, slices of hot peppers and a wedge of lime. Then prep your dipping sauce in one of the little sauce plate with squirts of sriracha and hoisin sauce to your taste. \n\nI would say the bowl is considered a regular size.  The broth can good flavor, but felt the amount of noodles could have been more, but I guess you have to add $1.50 for extra noodles.  For $9.45, I felt it was pricey for the size of the serving.  There are a couple of places in Little Saigon which I do think serves a good large bowl of the #1 pho at a more reasonable price. \n\nSo if you're in Chinatown and craving a bowl pho, Golden Star is a good choice.", "author": "Al L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "Directly across from the Portsmouth Square, the store with its unassuming storefront with a yellow banner on the top is one of the better places to get pho in Chinatown. I came here one evening with a friend at around 8:30 pm and we were promptly seated and served some water immediately. I came in wanting to get the chicken pho, but to my surprise, they do not serve it. I just assumed they served chicken pho because it seems to be a staple in any place that serves pho. This really did surprise me because they have seafood pho on the menu, but not chicken pho. Anyways, I spent five minutes thinking about what I wanted to order, before deciding on the bun bo hue. \n\nAs usual, I decided to sample the broth first, and my first observation was that it was good, but not as spicy as I hoped it would be. Then again, this assessment might be unfair since I have a high tolerance for spiciness and I guess if I really want to set this dish on fire, I could always just pour a couple spoonfuls of sriracha on it. I then poured the vegetables in and started mixing my dish together, shifting the vegetables toward the bottom of the dish and bringing the noodles to the surface. The thick vermicelli rice noodles were good, but I honestly would have preferred thinner rice noodles for this dish, like the ones normally served in pho. But then again, this is how bun bo hue is traditionally served, so it is what it is. I then moved onto the protein, and I tossed the pig's blood to my friend since I don't really like pig's blood in general. The gelatinous oxtail skin and meat and the Vietnamese pork sausage was my favorite part of the meal, and I reserved some for the end. I then proceeded to devour the rest of the dish and we finished our respective dishes in a span of twenty minutes, just before the store starts closing. I remember feeling full when I walked out, as I should be since I paid more than $12 for the dish ($10.45 for the dish, then some tax and tip). Overall, the dish was pretty good, but this is something that I wouldn't eat too often since I really prefer thinner noodles for Vietnamese dishes. \n\nIn reflection, what could have made my experience better was if they took credit cards. But then again, one can't really hold this against them unless all the stores in Chinatown take credit cards, which is probably never going to happen at the pace we're going. The service is good here and I remember leaving the store satisfied so I think I would most definitely come back here again. On that train of thought, I think the beef stew noodle is worth exploring the next time I come back here and I'm looking forward to it.", "author": "Nelson X."}

Came in for dinner last night, and was welcome to a packed restaurant. \n\nWe were seated instantly. I felt like soup, being in the foggy city and all, and went with their bun bo hue. My brother got their pho xe lua while my sister got their broken rice dish with shrimp and grilled pork. \n\nAnd the food was... disappointing. My bun bo hue was bland. Very oily broth and the meat was bland as well. It was served hot, however, so it still hit the spot and I didn't want to be picky. \n\nThat notion kind of changed when my sister got her rice dish. It came out within 5 minutes, so we knew everything was reheated. If it was just the meat, that would be excusable. But the cucumbers and other vegetables were warm as well, so we got a feeling they popped the whole plate, rice, meat and all, into the microwave and served it. \nMy brother's pho was surprisingly small. Xe lua is known for being served in a bowl made for kings. This bowl was an average-sized. On top of that, broth was lacked depth from beef bones, was probably made with insta-pho powder you can get from the store. Also, the noodles were tough and were not chewy enough. \n\nFor 3, our bill came out to be $30.85 before tax. Such sinfully mediocre food. At Vietnamese restaurants, I don't care to rate the service, but here, the servers are friendly and enjoy talking to the patrons. That's a star for you. \nSkip when you're in Chinatown.

Tons of business casual professionals scarfing down reasonably priced Vietnamese cuisine.

To achieve that, I ordered the house special, without tendon or tripe.  Very nice broth, packed with flavor and not overly salty.  The beef balls were their standard chewy texture.  Large chunks of hearty brisket.  The steak wasn't that rare since it seemed they just tossed it in, instead of carefully placing it on a floating island of already cooked meat.  Lots of noodles, so super filling.\n\nImperial Rolls: Glad they offered a half order (3 rolls) since that's just the right amount when pairing with a bowl pho.

Food is freaking amazing. IMPERIAL ROLLS? The moment we took a bite, we all instinctively smiled. Having visited Vietnam and had all their street food - this was pretty authentic. (Hot tip: Wrap your Imperial roll in the lettuce, and add some of the glass noodles on top; dip in hot sauce; eat. ENJOY.) \n\nI got #24: Vietnamese Beef Stew Soup Noodles......... dude, are you serious. This bowl of noodle soup was heaven. After my first bite, I had to turn to the chefs and owner and shout: THIS IS AMAZING. I couldn't help myself. \n\nThe owner suggested next time we try #1: House Special Beef Noodle Soup. It must be very good, if he was suggesting it. The table behind us (strangers) were having it and raved to us about it. We also shared our enlightenment of #24 with them as well. \n\n\n2.******* THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNBEATABLE. We received more personalized and better customer service here than in any luxury hotel, airline, or restaurant we've ever been to. \n\nLet me tell you some of the INSANELY intuitive things these people did:\n\n- I grabbed my mother's spoon and put some noodles and soup into it to let her have a bite. This is something I commonly do with my family. My dad wanted a bite, so as I grabbed his spoon to put a bite size in there, a waiter came by and handed me a bowl UNPROMPTED. He was observing what I was doing and knew exactly what I needed. WHAT?!\n\n- As I was eating, I needed to wipe my mouth with my napkin. I looked down to look for my napkin for literally 0.05 seconds, and the waiter came by, and pulled my napkin out from under my bowl. He knew I was just about to wipe my mouth and knew I wasn't going to find it unless he pointed it out. WHAT?!?!!?!?! \n\n- As my mom and dad were eating, they had used up their napkins, and as soon as they \"scrunched up\" their napkins, the waiter was already at our table with more napkins. DUDE WHA?????\n\nThe staff could tell I was in such shock and awe, as I looked at him, he said something along the lines of, \"When you're here, you don't have to speak up, I can read your mind!\" I DIDN'T DOUBT IT. \n\nBeing relatively new in the area, we asked for directions on how to get back to the BART train station, and he brought out a piece of paper and drew out a diagram with street names and everything.\n\nEveryone in the restaurant was having such a good time, smiling, and enjoying the great food. This place had such a pleasant family good vibes environment. \n\nThe food alone would bring me back.\n\nBut the crazy good customer service is what will make me a loyal customer for as long as I live here.", "author": "Michael T."}

It's a pretty spacious restaurant so they were able to accommodate a large group right away when we walked in on a weekend for lunch.

I needed to add some sauce to the soup but the flank and noodles were very good. The bowl is a bit on the smaller side and my friend was still hungry after finishing it.

The good news too is that the food is also delicious. Look around and notice it's pretty much all Asian locals in the packed restaurant. The house special beef pho had rich meaty flavor while remaining pretty light. There's a deceivingly generous amount of beef slices, beef balls, tendon, and tripe. Tried a little of the five spice chicken and thought it was pretty flavorful too. But those savory and crispy imperial rolls are really bomb. \n\nOn a return visit, I tried the Bun Bo Hue and Seasoned Waiter taught me how to pronounce it right - \"hue\" is pronounce \"hwey\" as a friendly FYI. I've seen quite a few folks ordering it and I'm glad I did. The broth had a nice balance of salt, spiciness, and sourness. I had avoided coagulated pigs blood my whole life but decided to try it since it felt like a staple in the dish. I could do without it the next time but I really enjoyed the slow braised pork knuckle that was so tender. \n\nGolden Star has become my go-to Vietnamese spot in Chinatown.

I'm thinking this place is not a legit Viet pho place because the pho wasn't amazing! The meatballs were also rubbery tasting. I don't know what is up with that because I've never had rubbery meatballs until we ate pho in SF. This is actually the second pho restaurant we tried in SF and they both had rubbery meatballs. Yuck! The broth itself I thought was okay but it's definitely at the bottom of all the pho places I've ever tried. \n\nThe woman who seated us seemed friendly and gave us drinks quickly but they never came back to refill. One of my sisters ended up drinking my water because they never refilled or checked on us. Another bad thing, we ordered PHO and what does pho come with? It always comes with a platter of basil, limes, beansprouts, etc... well, they did not even give us that. All the other tables with pho definitely got theirs.

This Vietnamese Pho place was a great find right in the middle of numerious Chinese restauraunts. The family-run restaurant is a small place and cramped quarters for approximately 8-10 tables. A run to the restroom takes you into the basement kitchen. It is amazing how much cooking gets done in such small quarters.\n\nWe thought the food was very good. We started with the Goi Cuen (shrimp and pork salad rolls). These are served with the hosin/peanut sauce and they were very good.

It has the perfect texture. Soft, juicy, and not dry at all. The blend of spices coated on the chicken skin is like an explosion of flavor, with a very subtle sweet aftertaste. Also, their rice is delicious. I think they mixed it with some kind of rice dressing. Yum. It also comes with a side of veggies (sliced carrots) which goes well with the chicken.\n\nThe bf ordered pho, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I judge pho by its noodles, and Golden Star did their noodles right! Their pho noodles are soft (but not too soft where it breaks easily), and you only need to chew 2-4 times before you're good to swallow.   \n\nService is good. They will not check up on you, which I don't mind, because I like to be left alone when I eat hehe.

We wanted to get some pho everybody. A quick yelp search led us to the golden star, not to be confused with all the other golden restaurants in Chinatown. There was a 20 minute wait around 2:30pm so I already knew this place was the real freakin deal.\n\nBiggest hold up about this place is that it's cash only.

My friends ran to the nearest ATM while I held our corner table down like it was my job.\n\nThe place is hustle and bustle and the servers all seemed to be moving real fast. The place itself reminded me of the movie office space. Just kinda bland walls and lighting, like they didn't do anything to make it more of a dining experience. It was like they were saying \"we're gonna make some super delicious food and you're gonna sit there and you're gonna like it and then leave.\"\n\nWe ordered some spring rolls to start and they were pretty good. I would've liked them more if I hadn't had the best spring rolls of my life the night before. They were by no means bad rolls though. \n\nThe pho has gotta be what this place is known for though because it was fucking fantastic. I got the lean beef pho. Not too salty not too watery not too soupy not too chunky. It was an excellent balance of tasty lean beef and the fixings.

Afterwards, my partner and I left and we were pleased with our experience. \n\nHOWEVER, on our way back to Union Square, my stomach started making gurgly sounds, then I suddenly got the urge to poop, then horrible stomach cramps (last time this happened to me was in Cambodia when they told me not to drink the water and I did). Thank God for the newly opened Burger King on Powell St.! It saved my ass, literally! I ran in, got in line (nearly pooped my pants!!) and made it in. OMG. I was sweating and had tons of diarrhea (sorry if this is too much information). Anyway, I may give this place a second chance in the future, but that diarrhea was horrible.", "author": "Sandy C."}

If you're looking for a cheap Asian restaurant around San Francisco I suggest that you try this place. It's not the best pho that you'll ever get but I give it a pass. However, don't expect it to be a clean. It's just a very humble looking Asian restaurant. If you want to eat at a clean sparkling westernized Asian restaurant don't look around this area. This restaurant and the other restaurants around this area are for people who want authentic Asian food. The soup was tasty and the noodle was cooked just right for me.

Then we proceeded to order some shrimp salad rolls, a beef pho (#1), and a spicy bun bo hue. The shrimp salad rolls looked fresh and the sauce tasted pretty good in our opinion.

The bun bo hue I got was okay though I would wish the broth to be more flavorful. But what really grossed us out was when I saw two tiny dead flies floating on the soup of my bun bo hue after I had finished about half of the food.

I think there is only one other joint that I like better in the city and that would be Ha Nam Ninh but that is another review. It was a long weekend of adult beveraging after a company party and of course I needed a hot bowl of pho to bring some comfort to my aching body. Now this joint is a CASH only spot so keep that in mind but the prices are super reasonable so don't worry. This joint is located near the \"park\" in the Chinatown area and is a semi hole in the wall type of joint. They actually have a good amount of tables inside the restaurant itself and the servers are actually friendly which seems strange for me since most pho places are not that friendly. \n\nI have had a variety of phos here but on my most recent trip I also was able to split the five spice chicken plate which was delicious. The food comes out so quick here that it boggles me how they are able to do that but no complaints as I was dying for a good bowl of soup. The portions are a good size and the meat was tender in the pho. All the varieties of the meat were solid and the broth was good and not oily so a huge plus. The noodles were also the right texture of cooked and did not dissolve like some joints do.  The five spice chicken was a pleasant surprise as it was super flavorful and tender. Completely juicy and delicious \n\nA great spot for food and props for the cheap prices. A joint I will definitely hit up each time I am around the area.", "author": "Dan M."}

I'm sure those folks worked really hard for it, not to be confused with the ones that brown nosed their way to the top, or as the new Cantonese adage goes \u4e2d\u9593\u5206\u754c, \u5347\u8077\u6700\u5feb (which means if you part \"ways\" in the middle, you rise up the ranks faster...ahem ahem).\n\nAs the years go by, I find myself disliking coming to Chinatown more and more for a number of reasons.\n\nBut of the few times that I really do have to come here, finding something safe to eat has been a challenge. If it isn't unrefined spectacular crap, it's greasy oily salty goopy goo shortcuts loved with flavor enhancement crystals one way or another. Only North Beach touristy American Italian would be more tolerable.\n\nAnyhoo, pho in Chinatown. Whoa Tha Fuh? This is usually a safer bet when you don't want the moo shoo poo poo doo doo.\n\nGolden Star has been around for quite some time. Family run business and very friendly (particularly if you are a Chinatown local and speak Cantonese), and if you don't compare it to Vietnamese in the TL, San Jose (or even haha...Westminster), it's not bad. At least it's better than the sushi boat restaurant somewhere around! Or Sushi Rock :-o\n\n9 customers out of ten pretty much come here for the pho. The bean sprouts are some of the fugliest specimens I've ever seen....heck this is Chinatown.\n\nBut thankfully their Dac Biet Bun Bo Hue special, listed on the wall, was something that caught my eye. Sometimes a wall special can be risky, but luckily this was a true saver.\n\n- Base pho broth (which was nothing spectacular) but once they added the flavoring and chili oil like substance, it tasted so much better\n\n- this bowl had meat galore....what looked like shank, fatty brisket, tendon (no tripe)...almost looked like a typical pho dac biet with all the meat fixins....but they threw in two chunks of pork knuckle with the skin, quite tender. And a few slices of cha lua (not the tip top grade stuff, but not bad). Two cubes of pork blood...not my style (the really fresh marinated pork blood gelee cubes can only be found in Hong Kong and China).\n\n- \"lai fun\" (bun) noodles were slurpy and firm. Had a chuckle that someone referred to it as \"spaghetti\" and changed the order to pho noodles.\n\nDecent caf\u00e9 sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk), but not high octane stuff like Hai Ky Mi Gia's, tho better than Lee's.\n\nStill, a much better experience than most Chinese restaurants around (except R&G and a few other exceptions).", "author": "Ken K."}

Nestled in some alley in Chinatown, with an unassuming exterior, this place could easily be overlooked. \n\nDeviating away from the recommendation of ordering #18, we ordered #1 and the bun bo hue. \n#1 came with an equal ration of noodle to beef, the broth was authentic in flavor, leaning more towards crisp & light & clean rather than the usual heavy, oily, and overly salty flavor I've encountered at other places.\n\nBun Bo Hue was LOADED with beef  (1/3 of my bowl was all protein) along with the noodles, pork feet, and pork blood. The broth was greasier than #1 and in my opinion, not quite spicy enough. The noodles also seemed a bit under-cooked, but overall, was ok / could be better. \n\nI wouldn't rule Golden Star off as an option for pho if I was in the area, but I would not travel the distance from home to Chinatown just to dine here either. \n\nhttp://www.thrillist.com/eat/san-francisco/best-pho-in-sf-bay-area  \nFor those who live in SF and are curious about the list I'm referring to.", "author": "Ada C."}

Theirs is pretty decent. Not great, but not terrible. Broth is clear and good on a cold day (which, in SF is pretty often). Their viet coffee is sufficiently strong, which is always nice.\n\nService is quick. Not chatty and they're borderline rude. But since its Chinatown, are you really expecting 5-star service? They've, on occasion, come by to collect dishes we weren't finished with yet, and dropped off checks before we're close to done. But. Again. Chinatown.\n\nWhy I can't give a better rating...and why I won't return again...is I found out they were Pro-Proposition 8. Yes, I realize that its old news by now.

We were quickly seated and began looking at the menu. After a few minutes the waiter asked what we wanted but more than half of us haven't decided what to get yet, and so I kindly asked if he could give us a few more minutes. The waiter gave us a stern look and whispered to one of my friends who ordered his food already, \"You are smart, you order first. Your friends make me wait now I make them wait.\" We were ready to order after a few minutes but the waiter never came over to take our orders until about 10 minutes later, even though we made eye contact with him many times and raised our hands up to get his attention. The nerve of this rude guy actually made us WAIT. All because we didn't order right off the bat? Has he never served customers who wanted a little more time to decide what to order? Anyway, I'd like to add that he handed me my fork in the rudest, sassiest way possible. Was the attitude really necessary? Also, when I asked for everyone if we could all get a glass of water, he turned around and disrespectfully waved me away after I asked like he wanted me to be quiet or stop bothering him. This guy has no manners! \n\nThe food was pretty good, which is why I'm giving this place any stars at all (although they \"forgot\" one of MY orders but I let it go).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-13", "description": "I ordered their combination small pho and I added seafood for 2 bucks. Their broth came out hot which is a plus. I didn't really care for their beef meat. It just had a funny taste behind it, at least for me. You guys might like it though or can't tell. The pho comes with a side of bean sprouts, 1 lime and slices of jalapeno. You could always ask for extra. The condiments they have on the table are hoisin sauce, soya sauce, sriracha sauce, another red chili sauce, salt, and pepper. If you want the red chili pepper in hot oil sauce you need to ask for it. They will bring you a little bit at first so if your like me and eat very spicy don't hesitate to ask for more. The place is clean. It's a small restaurant and fits around 40 people. The bathroom is in the back going towards the kitchen downstairs in the basement. Next time I want to try their eggrolls or also known as imperial rolls. The wrapper they use is not the hard thick wrapper, instead spring roll wrappers are used so it's  lighter and crunchier in taste. The price are reasonable too. Also they have the 3 color dessert which consist of crushed yellow mung beans, kidney or red beans and jelly with coconut milk and sugar. I didn't order this here so I cannot comment.

I've been to this place before when I was 12 years old and a tourist in SF, and now that I'm 22 years old and I work in SF I'm a regular during lunch hours. \n\n______\nThe Service:\nI hate it when people walk up to an old school Asian restaurant and they expect some sort of 5 star service with waiters in suits because this restaurant has your typical old Asian man who doesn't care about being nice, but serving you right. And you better be fine with that because that's how the rest of Chinatown runs. \n\nWith that being said, the service is still nice. People think that if you talk fast, quick, and short they think you're being \"rude\". They're not. That's just how old school Asian people talk. Chill. \n\nI love the folks that work here. They will answer your questions as much as they can, and they will give you what you want if you ask for it. Straight-forward service.\n\n______\nThe Atmosphere:\nPeople call this kind of place \"hole-in-the-wall\", I call it a \"home feel\". Any pho restaurant that looks like this is a guaranteed sign that you're in for some nice yummy pho. Trust me. \n\nUsually when people see places like this, they turn their back on it because it \"looks dirty and disgusting\" because of the dustiness, the shabby tables and the janky pictures with smudged walls and then they start hallucinating cockroaches skittering by. It's been 10 years, I don't see no goddamn cockroach so calm down, sit down and enjoy your delicious hot bowl of pho which I'm bout to describe.\n______\nThe Food:\nWhether you're getting a bowl of hot delicious pho or a rice plate or stir fry noodles, it's a guaranteed you're gonna love your food. But the star of the show here is pho. It's still delicious and has been for 10 years, and you know how successful they are if they've been around since I was a little kid. \n\nIt means they know how their pho should be, and they know how to do classic Vietnamese home food. I've never left their place unsatisfied. My taste buds and stomach always leave filled with joy of rich soup broth, well cooked rice noodles, delicious meat slices and fresh greens. \n\n______\nOther Comments:\nWhy does this place get a 5 star? Do I absolutely have NO complaints about this place? \n\nWell I don't complain about the smallest things. The only possible downside I can see to this place is that it gets crowded sometimes and that I don't like how when they run out of tea cups they serve their hot tea in a tall glass cup. But is that something to remove a star over? No. Little things that I won't make a mole hill into a mountain for.\n\nEnjoy.", "author": "J. H."}

Because we've been pretty loyal customers throughout the years, the servers there always recognizes us and right away knows what we want so sometimes we don't even have to order!\n\nIn the past I usually order the number 1 in a medium size, then changed to tripe only with beef stock, then beef balls only, and then to lemongrass chicken vermicelli with fried spring rolls, and then back to number 1 and now beef balls and tripe, bringing me back to my childhood. They are quick to serve despite being such a tiny restaurant. Other dishes that we've had were the fried spring rolls, cold spring rolls, five spice chicken. Recently as mentioned in another pho review, I finally decided to give the rice plate a shot since a lot of people always get that and it's really good; I'd usually get the five spice chicken rice plate with the egg.\n\nI never get tired of this place, so whenever I'm in Chinatown (not that I frequent Chinatown anymore) I usually would drop by this place for lunch because I feel like Chinatown never really have that many great places to eat anyways.", "author": "Judy C."}

DO NOT EAT HERE!!! The food is bad but the customer service is even worse.  There is absolutely nothing special about their dishes (besides the nostril hair I found in my Hu tieu) and their soups are bland.  Probably the worst Hu tieu and pho I have tasted In my life!  They operate a shady business by taxing individual items versus taxing the total amount of the bill.  When I asked the reason why the prices were more than what was clearly listed on the menu, the person in charge replied those are the prices after tax.  I shook my head in disbelief and paid the bill then walked back to my table.  I showed my girlfriend the menu and 2 of their workers (one male and one female) quickly interjected and stated twice that the menu prices are before taxes (note I had already paid).  The older woman had the audacity to say that the bill I paid did \"not include tip either\"!!!! They really have some nerve!!!! Even at an Asian restaurant I have never experienced such disrespect and I was in extreme disbelief.  To top this \"great\" experience off, these particular workers in addition to the person in charge walked past our table to verify how much we had placed in the tip tray/if I even placed money in the tray!!!

If you go around 11:30 you will definitely have no problems getting a table all to yourself. Also anytime after 1pm is good too if you're into a late lunch. It will be a short wait and but I don't like it because they tend to rush people out when there is a line outside. You put your name and the number of people in your party on a list outside. On to the food!\n\nPho: I always order the special combo because I eat all of the tripe, tendons, fatty beef and all that good stuff in the soup that's bad for you. The only thing I don't like is that they charge you an extra $0.50 for beef on the side. How much more work is it to split the beef up? They should be paying me for doing all the hard work. Anyways, the broth is light but good enough for the soup. The soup is always piping hot so there's no question about that. I hate soup that gets cold as you add ingredients. Sometimes they overcook the noodle just a little bit when they're in the hurry but most of the time it's just right.\n\n5 spice chicken: I once ordered the 5 spice chicken and told 10 minutes later that they ran out of chicken.

Dining here was a meal wasted. \n\nWe were treated like second-class citizens from the moment we stepped foot in the door. We should have left upon spotting other customers wiping out their tea cups with sanitizing wipes. \n\nI was willing to go with the authentic vibe. It was a little over run-down and very unsanitary (don't even think about using the bathrooms. Ew).  Two servers were clattering soup spoons and chopsticks at the table behind us the entire meal. How pleasant. \n\nThe shrimp spring rolls were pretty good, but they forgot to include the pork.  I was praying that my boyfriend would like the pho better; this was his first pho experience, and now I'm ashamed that I insisted on this place.  This is the first time that Yelp led me astray. Grrr...\n\nWe both had the chicken pho (#26?). The broth was oily and lacked depth.  I think Swanson did a better job than Golden Star.  My hands and feet started puffing after three spoonfuls due to the sodium content. \n\nThe most disturbing part of this meal was the \"chicken\".  Never in my life have I encountered poultry with a massive bone the diameter of a human femur running through it.  There was something off about the skin's thickness and the meat's color. That is all I will say about that. \n\nTo top it all off, one of the owners approached our table after we had our fill. He interrogated us about the portion size and why we didn't finish our meals, then made a snide remark to the employees in the back. (I may not speak Vietnamese, but I'm not an idiot). \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be back. Proceed with caution.", "author": "Sarah K."}

I knew was looking at a weekend spent hiding beneath my covers, while watching all three seasons of Arrested Development.\n\nBut instead of stocking up on my usual Tylenol cold and sinus stuff, and dedicating hours to long phone complaining sprees to my siblings- I decided to be proactive.\n\nI began drinking lots of herbal teas. I made regular visits to Good Earth for bowls of fresh fruit and yogurt and large quantities of veggies. I chugged water. I got sleep.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-11", "description": "Four-star food, two-star service. Applying the laws of physics, that gets them three stars from me. I came here for dinner about 40 minutes before close, so perhaps they weren't thrilled with starting a new service so near closing, but that's no excuse. I found the service to be rude, dismissive and inattentive.\n\nNow, sometimes that kind of service is par-for-the-course in Chinatown--a cultural thing. What I DO know to be a cultural thing is great food, and you can find that here. Vietnamese tends to be my least favorite of the Asian cuisines, but I love pho, so that's what drew me here.\n\nUnfortunately, they were all out of pho ga, and I try not to eat beef. Left scrambling, I decided to try the shrimp skewer appetizer and lemongrass chicken vermicelli. I've had the Vietnamese skewers of ground meat before--I love the added flavor the sugarcane gives the meat when its packed around the sugarcane like a skewer. What I'd never had before, however, is the presentation like Golden Star. Out came my broiled shrimp skewers--two--accompanied by noodles, shredded carrot, slicked cucumber, and a sauce that tasted like a peanut/fish sauce mix. I also got four translucent rice paper wrappers to make delicious little rolls with mountain of goodness placed in front of me. This was a great appetizer, and would be even better for sharing with a group of friends.\n\nI tend not to like vermicelli at all--something about it has always just been off to me. So it was with great hesitation and disappointment that I ordered it by default, since they were out of pho ga for the evening. My hesitation was unwarranted, as I found this vermicelli to be really great. The combination of cold noodles and meat still perplexes me and isn't my favorite palate sensation. But when I covered my bowl with Sriracha and mixed it together, the flavors all came together for a really great entree.\n\nThe moral of the story for me was that the Yelp ratings for Golden Star are well-deserved for just the food. For me, dining is about the combination of food and service, so I would definitely be back for the former, and then I would know to have ZERO expectations of the latter.", "author": "Ben S."}

Not that I'm not grateful, just sayin'.\nSimilarly, service was pretty much the same in the restaurant.  We had to ask about 3 times for water, mostly because the server was being bombarded with water requests.  Some might take that as a sign that people are having to drink a LOT of water at this restaurant.  Others could argue that salty soup is salty.\n\nThe pho here is quick and efficient.  Most of us had their house special, the #1, which is basically your usual \"beef, beef, and more beef\" pho.  The beef broth is a little light on flavor, which I actually prefer, but may be a detriment to those who expect their soups to punch them in the mouth.  They served a good, realistic pho, making sure to dump your meat in raw, and letting you determine how rare you'd like to eat your beef.  The processed beef balls (no other way to describe this) are pretty good, but be warned that you're basically eating as close to non-beef as you can get with those delicious little guys.  \nWe also tried some of the imperial rolls, which were a nice little surprise for a hole in the wall like this place.  They're not healthy, for sure. But, they'll definitely make your appetite a little happier and get you ready for some food.\n\nPrice and Value-wise, they're fair and you'll get a good meal for a good price.  I wouldn't say it's five-star quality, but it's definitely worth your time if you want a satisfying meal in the 7-9$ range.", "author": "Justin L."}

Our menus were literally thrown on the table. We felt rushed to order because the man taking our order looked annoyed that we did not know what to order after sitting down for just 5 minutes. The same man kept bumping into me while walking to other tables and did not even apologize. Not only that, we asked for one of our orders to be to-go. He did NOT bring our order to-go which was fine. We simply asked for a to-go box, he rudely sighs and throws a to-go box on our table. After asking for our check, we paid our bill, the exact amount. There was no way we were leaving a tip. As my family and I got up to leave the restaurant, a female employee runs up to me and says \"this is not including tip! You HAVE to leave tip!\" Really? Since when in the United States is leaving a tip a requirement? Especially AFTER having the worst service ever possible. It was like she was not going to let me leave unless we left a tip.

They have a great spicy beef noodle soup too that they're famous for but again ask for the thinner pho noodles instead of the thicker noodles- which is the default noodle for that dish . Either way I recommend getting the raw beef eye round on the side so you can add it into the boiling broth yourself and be sure to get the rare beef experience.  \n\nTheir rice dishes are good and often the fried egg on top is a fab brunch option.\n\nTheir apps are good too- the imperial rolls are extremely good if you want that fried app fix.

I was expecting a lot more from this restaurant, and was disappointed. It's still a decent pho place. However, if this is the best pho place in SF, I think I'll stop looking.\n\nI got their pho with beef flank and beef balls, and a three-coloured bean drink (sahm sik bing). My boyfriend extra-sized his noodle (bad idea), and my friend got spring rolls along with his pho. \n\nNOODLE: The noodles aren't what they're supposed to be. They came in a big massive clump that tasted sort of chewy, but not exactly. Kind of waxy? I'm not sure how to describe them. This reminded my friend of the time that he heard that in China, some restaurants mixed plastics into their noodle to make them last longer... Not that you needed to know this ;) By the way, I heard that the people at this restaurant aren't Vietnamese... Hahaha...\n\nBROTH: Plain. My boyfriend and my friend both mixed in a ton of sri racha sauce, but they agreed that it was quite plain. It didn't taste like a clean plain broth though. It was just plain. \n\nMEAT: The beef flank was average, not fatty enough overall, and didn't really taste that good. There were tendons, I think, attached to some pieces, I cannot be sure that they were tendons. They were a bit thicker and yellow than any other tendons I've ever had. Actually, wth was that..? I gave it to my boyfriend who practically eats anything. \n\nSPRING ROLLS: It was actually pretty good in contrast to the pho. I'm curious to see if they're capable of packing more in them since these are much thinner spring rolls than what I'm used to. \n\nSAHM-SIK-BING: This is the three-coloured bean drink I mentioned. It's quite common and I love trying this drink at different places. Anyway, it was just sweet enough but I couldn't really taste the beans. My boyfriend wanted to order one as well, but they were sold out! Interestingly enough, now you know then they don't make it on the spot.

My family came here often with our friends too, since a bowl of pho was pretty cheap, just a little over 5 bucks. Unfortunately, visits to Golden Star for me these days are rare now that I live in Sacramento. \n\nLast Saturday though, me and my sisters made a random trek to SF Chinatown and one of them suggested to go to Golden Star for lunch. The owners warmly greeted us and we were seated immediately, even though the place was packed at 1:30. I ordered beef tripe noodle soup since I love the springiness of tripe. One sister was really excited to eat the five-spiced chicken pho because she says the chicken is really flavorful and makes the broth delicious after dipping the chicken into it. The other was excited to have the fish ball and fish cake noodles because she says no other Vietnamese restaurant serves this. \n\nEven though we haven't been to Golden Star in a while, the owner who took our order still remembered my sisters don't like green onion in their broth and knew not to give them bean sprouts. We were still treated as if we had been eating there regularly. Like old times, the food came out quickly and tasted delicious. \n\nIf you're not interested in pho, their bun, chow fun, and rice plates are great as well. Prices are still really reasonable. My noodles only cost $5.85 and it was a pretty big bowl. Golden Star is a great cheap eats place in SF Chinatown.", "author": "Diana C."}

It's the only reason they don't get a higher rating.  The patrons are split pretty evenly between asian and non-asian.\n\nThe Service:\nThe service is tremendous, I usually order my dish with an egg on top and no sprouts and they've never gotten it wrong.

To tell you the truth I was not really impress by the food. I Ordered the #1 which in most pho restaurants mean the Beef Noodle soup w/ all the fixings. The broth is very important when it comes to pho, it binds the whole pho experience. To say the least, the broth was bland and tasteless. Pho broth has to be aromatic and flavorful. Also the \"fresh ingredients\" i.e. the basil and bean sprouts, were not very fresh. The bean spouts were at least two days old and sitting in it's own juices (yuck). The thai basil was all blacken and bruised up.\n\nI also had the fried egg rolls and was very disappointed. The rolls were greasy (had a pool of grease upon lifting it off the plate) and bland. The Nouc Cham that came w/ the egg rolls was also weak sauce. The service sucked as well but that is what you expect in a back alley restaurant anyway. \n\nI will NOT be back for sure!!!!", "author": "Matthew S."}

Perfectly cooked noodles\n3. Generous portions of beef/protein\n\nI've had their pho a few times and, for the most part, they get it right. The broth is delicious and the noodles are chewy. I'm a huge meat-eater (I must've been a vegetarian in my past life) so I'm never quite satisfied with the amount at most pho places.\n\nBut, who cares about the pho when you can get BUN BO HUE! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1pq5mmp71nXWBK_jG9VxHg?select=YLJE06gvUL0FwUSwoHGtcQ) I get this every time I come. I love the thick rice noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1pq5mmp71nXWBK_jG9VxHg?select=zp5GvEJOa2B3U_LeBmJXAA) - not as chewy as pho noodles but has more body than rice vermicelli. (It *boggles* my mind how different noodles, even when made from the same ingredients, can make such a difference!) It comes with all the fixin's - pork knuckle, congealed pork blood cubes, Vietnamese ham, and beef shank slices. The BEST part though, is the broth. It's different than pho in that it uses shrimp/chili paste and LOADS of lemongrass (you can see the lemongrass bits floating on top), and is mildly spicy. Add some lemon juice and it's even better! Just make sure you hydrate with lots of tea - because you won't be able to resist drinking all the broth! (OK, maybe that's just me...)\n\nI also LOVE love LOVE the BO TAI CHANH (thinly sliced raw beef served with lemon juice, onion, mint leaves, and peanuts) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1pq5mmp71nXWBK_jG9VxHg?select=KoLUimvUgodL050fKDCVKQ]. The lemon juice adds a great acidity and makes this dish so refreshing. It's best to combine all the ingredients in one mouthful - simply delectable!\n\nThe rice vermicelli (bun) with flame broil beef is great too. The marinated beef slices are so flavourful. Drench the noodles in fish sauce and taste the transformation! The vegetables and fish sauce make this a very refreshing dish too.\n\nThe service is surprisingly good.

I know this already. The guys I was with might be able to, but I can't. We ended up ordering just the right amount of food: One bowl of the beef round pho, one order of the five spice chicken pho and an order of imperial rolls.\n\nThe workers were a bit curt but actually quite accommodating. They brought 3 small bowls since we were splitting the pho and they brought lots of extra sundrys (fresh basil, lime, bean sprouts, lots of peppers, the usual).\n\nThe beef round pho was great with a delicious broth and noodles that were the perfect texture. The imperial rolls were hot, crunchy, but were not served with nearly enough of the lettuce and veggies to eat them appropriately. But the winner of the afternoon was the five spice chicken pho.\n\nInstead of chicken in the soup, it's just a big leg and thigh on the side of a giant bowl of noodles and broth. Pulling the chicken pieces off and throwing them in the soup is like eating an asian version of grandma's chicken noodle soup. It's filling and the seasonings melt off into the broth to season it further.\n\nAdditionally, we got a round of Vietnamese iced coffees, which were better than I've had most places. I was quite impressed, I can honestly say.\n\nThe total for the three of us came out to about $30, including tip. We were so full afterward (yet we were able to make it into north beach for dessert).\n\nBut what gets Golden Star 4 stars is not lunch today. Golden Star gets 4 stars because of every time I get carryout from them. They superheat the broth and package the raw beef round, half cooked noodles and crisp vegetables all separately. That way, when I get back to the office, I can cook my meat and finish cooking my noodles all in that great broth. Best of all, they are very generous with the basil. Nothing is soggy, overcooked or cold.\n\nIt's great to sit inside and have a leisurely lunch, but the takeout is why I rate them so highly.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

Never a crowd, open until 9pm, and easy parking at the underground parking lot across the street for $2.  You can even pick up by calling them 10 minutes ahead of time.  This is how I became a regular at Golden Star. They got to know me when I bring then family for quick (you can get in and out in about 30m), cheap dinners when the restaurant is practically deserted.  They know me by face and whenever I go in for lunch, I feel like I always get seated a bit quicker and my food comes a bit faster.  They even know that I always get the #4 or #8 and get thrown when I decide go crazy and opt for the #17.  By the way, if you get sick of beef pho, you should definitely try the #17 which is the chicken pho.  Completely different than the turtle tower pho, it's the same noodles as the beef pho in chicken broth and comes with a huge side of pre-cut, marinated delicious chicken thigh...though their beef pho is so good, people don't opt for the chicken version often.\n\nIs this the best pho I've ever had?  Not really, but then again who can compete against the pho I had in a Vietnamese alley on a table covered with used tissues?

I put on my shades, grabbed my compatriot, and off we went, to slurp the ultimate comfort food.\n\nThe line out the door almost caused a minor freak out on my part, but D was barely done with her ciggy and the wait was over. Minutes later we were seated and two hot steaming bowls of broth arrived with a side of 5 spice chicken and all the fixins. Definitely excellent, and I did manage to slosh it all over myself and the table in my excitement, but better than Turtle Tower? Pho-getaboutit.\n\nThe drip Vietnamese iced coffee was divine.

I'm not normally a fan of Vietnamese places because I'm not all that big of a fan of pho, but I'm always happy to get broken rice with bbq chicken or bbq pork and Vietnamese meatloaf.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: If you're like me and you're not all that into eating soup as a meal check out their vermicelli or broken rice dishes. The chicken and pork are very savory.\n\nATMOSPHERE: I've been here a few times and it's always been pretty busy, but I've never had a problem getting my glass of water refilled. There is a good amount of seating (this place hosted UCSD Dragonboat's entire team November 2009 for dinner) and the service is very efficient. Parking is pretty sparse, but underground paid parking is available if you don't want to wait to look for street spots.\n\nWHY FOUR? Parking is hard to find because it's in SF Chinatown, but there's a lot that you can pay for nearby. The food served here is definitely worth the price, but I wouldn't call it \"Five-star\" quality (sorry Danger!). The place is clean and the service is quick. I have a large appetite and the couple times I've been here I've left with a full stomach and a satisfied tastebuds.\n\nCONCLUSION: I honestly can say that the UCSD Dragonboat team should make it a tradition to come here for their Fall season race. The place is filling, tasty and affordable. The staff is helpful and the menu has a large selection. It's definitely a place to stop-by when I'm in the area.\n\n-TanK", "author": "Kevin T."}

The spring rolls are also great, they're wrapped nice and tight. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the service is rude.

My friends and I came here for dinner around 7, since my friend recommended this place to me. As I stepped in, I got a good impression thinking this place must be good, since it was almost a full house. Then one of the workers on the floor lead us to a round table which fits five people. I didnt really like to sit in the middle of the restaurant, so when I saw one of the tables on the side was empty. I was going to ask one of the workers if we can switch table, but another group of customers requested. And one of the workers there said yes. I was a little bummed when they got the table, but then I saw another table that was available. So I asked my friend to asked them this lady if we can move to that empty table. Then she responded, you guys can just sit where you are. I was shocked and pissed, the other group of customers were able to move, but not us!? After we ordered our food, the \"side dish\" came, which has some vietmese leaves, pepper, and some bean sprouts. As my dish came, I was still pissed by the fact that they didnt let us move. So I didnt bother saying another word to them. When my friends was in the middle of eating our food. One of the workers came by and ask if we want our side dish, my friends said no. Then I asked my friends, why did they have to pick up side dish in the middle of our meal, cant they do it later!? At the end, we just paid the exact tips without leaving another single penny. This experience was a valuable lesson for not going to this place again. I only gave a star for the food, which was enough to satisfied my empty stomach. So if you guys dont mind the customer service, I hope you guys will enjoy the food they provide there.", "author": "Shirley L."}

Last night I didn't want to go out to the Richmond for my usual Pho fix.  Since this place was close by, I went there.  It was 8pm and there was still quite a few patrons at the tables there.  I ordered the #1 Pho with everything and it tasted ok.  The portions of the meat and everything was not spectacular although adequate.  The soup tasted a little too lukewarm for my taste.  It might be the contributing factor to why I had to go to the bathroom every 15 minutes for the rest of the night.  I very seldom get sick from Pho so this was an anomaly for me.  That is the reason for the 1 star rating.  I don't know for sure if it was the Pho, however the fact that it was served at less than piping hot conditions is very suspicious.  Anyway, this seems a popular place so go at your own risk.  I just wanted to make sure I warn everyone of my experience here. I also noticed that there was some other reviewers that also mentioned they or their friends got sick at this place(I wish I read those reviews!) so, really be careful.\n\nP.S.\nIt's been 32 hours since I last ate at this place and I am still having intestinal cramps and pain.  I travel all over the world (8 years)and have only been sick once from food.  Since I got back to SF (1month) I have been sick twice already eating at the restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-13", "description": "Did I mention that I hate waiting in line?  As a result, there are two choices:  a) get there early or b) get take out.  In my over sixteen years of eating their food, I've never eaten AT the restaurant.  Because I used to work about two blocks away, it was always easier to call them and pick it up in ten minutes.  No crowds.  No loud conversations.  Does this mean no social skills?  ... I hope not.  I get the vibe when I walk into the restaurant during the busy weekday lunch hours between 12 pm and 1:45 pm.  The crowd is a mix of Financial District office people (but not the suits types who can't allow their slurped soup to hit their precious ties) and local Chinatown professionals or merchants.  The main attraction is the pho, delicious rice noodles cooked in a meaty, flavorful broth.  There are combinations with various parts of the cow, but I normally opt for the beef balls (not those) and thinly sliced beef flank in either rice noodles or \"fun\" (wide rice noodles).  They provide the sriricha hot sauce and the hoisin (a dark sweet and sour sauce) which mix into a delicious dipping sauce for the meats and/or the noodles.   They also provide raw bean sprouts, basil leaves, hot peppers, and lemon wedges to further spruce the flavor of the broth.  Because of the heat from the soup, the bean sprouts will cook al dente style and keep the crunchiness.  The beauty in the take out is that they separate the above ingredients into four containers:  a) broth with beef balls, b) noodles with the raw beef flank (it cooks when you pour the hot broth on top), c) the raw bean sprouts, hot peppers, mint leaves, and lemon wedges, and d) a small sauce container of sriracha and hoisin.  On a cold rainy day, nothing beats a bowl of this.  My other favorite is the barbecued chicken (a drumstick and thigh), imperial rolls (2 deep fried crispy pork and vermicelli filled bites), over rice.  It comes with a small container of fish sauce for dipping the imperial rolls or pouring over the rice for more flavor.  They also add some shredded pickled daikon and carrots with cucumber slices for additional color and flavors.  Most of their meals are under $10.00 unless you order a beverage with the meal.  I'm not big on coffee so sometimes I splurage on a can of soy milk.  If you arrive after 12 pm for lunch, you made need to add your name to the sign up list; the line moves relatively fast as everyone is on that same one hour lunch break schedule.

I had the 5 spice chicken Pho Gha and it was truly impressive.  There was an incredibly intimate balance between the marinated tender chicken and my hearty pho in the most spectacular broth.

So you gotta come in here open minded expecting to eat some weird crap.  For you retards who come to a restaurant like this and scream \"Oh noes!  They're serving me cow innards!\" well you shouldn't have come in here in the first place.  That's like putting your finger into an electric pencil sharpener and thinking it won't hurt...what the hell did you expect?!  On second thought, you should keep your finger in there longer so you can't type up crappy and unjust reviews anymore.\n\nI come here and usually get the #2 - full of pork, beef, and then a bunch of innards and membranes  It's fast, generous portions, delicious and actually quite healthy.   Perfect on a cold day, a bowl of hot pho just can't be beat, and this place serves one of the best bowls (of pho) out here.  However, you HAVE to try the five spiced chicken - they bring you a half chicken on a plate and then a separate bowl of pho; you can either cut pieces of the chicken into the pho or eat them separately.\n\nCan't really describe the service here - it's actually rather comical.  The waiters are very polite, but direct (they don't have time to chit chat).  Although lines pile up here, they take orders and serve very, very quickly.  Great casual and rowdy atmosphere, come get some!", "author": "Nico M."}

Additionally, while neither the beef or imperial rolls are exceptional, they are good, and the amount and quality of the garnishes (toasted peanuts & sauced green onions) is large and not an afterthought.\n\nGolden Star makes a fine bowl of bun, that's really about it.\n\nWell I also drank a big gulp of tea that burned my tounge to hell, and the resturant was chock full of ill-behaved toddlers (two is a chock, right?), but I suppose I'm to blame for A) not sipping the tea to make sure it wasn't hot and B) stopping in at 2:30 on Sunday afternoon", "author": "Gustie L."}

I had to tear it dissect it just to eat the insides because the outside were putting up a fight.\n\nNow to the parking.  Beware of the City's website saying that they validate at the Portsmouth Garage.  THEY DON'T!  They only validate for the Park N Ride and it's $3 for the entire day.  Not a bad gig if you're going to shop around Chinatown all day, but sucky if the reason you decided on this place was because they validated.  Now, don't get me wrong - I usually eat pho in about 15 minutes anyway, so I came out ahead in the end, but it's just bad press to say that a lot validates when it doesn't, then not care when a patron informs you that you're still listed on the site as a \"yes\".\n\nAgain, good pho - bad parking.", "author": "Alison N."}

The style of the restaurant is totally chinatown. It's a small restaurant, sometimes (lunch time) it's _packed_, the owner speaks cantonese (in addition to vietnamese), and it's next to a grocery store. Some would say it's a hole in the wall, but if it is, then it's a nice one - I've seen much much worse just around the corner. You've gotta keep it in perspective - excellent pho at a good price in downtown/chinatown sf. The pho in embarcadero center costs 50% more and tastes sub-standard.\n\nI could eat here multiple times each week for lunch. In fact, I do. Sure beats McD's, Quiznos, or hot dogs and burgers.

We started trying other places (Vietnamese) around Chinatown and in the Sunset and Richmond, and still, came back.  They raised the prices like everyone else, which made us pissed, but it is still cheap.  Ultimately, the Pho broth is better than any place I have tried in the city so far, even TL (although admittedly I have not tried every place in the TL).   The real gem here is the steroid chicken they give you for 5-Spiced chicken.  The vermicelli dishes are good as well.  Great place for lunch if you work in the financial district.", "author": "Kapeli M."}

Noting the distance from my office and the warnings about crowds at noon, I decided to take advantage of my proximity and pulled up to the curb, hoping to pass for a truck in the restricted zone.\n\nCheap Vietnamese establishments are no place for the squeamish.   But the 16 (count 'em!) \"beef\" Pho options were daunting.  Alone or in combination, one can order:  beef rib eye, beef flank, beef tendon, beef tripe, beef meat balls, beef eye round, and beef stew.  If \"rib eye\" and \"eye round\" are the same thing, and \"beef flank\" is flank steak, then some of the mystery is alleviated.  But as it stood, I couldn't ascertain whether any of these are parts of the cow that I normally consume.  As my sister put it, I don't need to find out that their translation skills are more accurate than anticipated, and beef eye is, indeed, Eye of Beef.\n\nSo I ordered #17 Five Spice chicken w/soup noodle, to go.\n\nAs other posters have noted, the broth was well above average, most notably for what it was not:  salty, thin, oily.  By the time I added the requisite bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, lime squeeze and LARGE dollop of hot sauce, this was a Pho worth risking a parking ticket.  \n\nA note regarding #17, however:  the chicken was in very large bone-in pieces, not strips that could be added directly to the soup.  As there is no basic Pho Ga on the menu, I may try a seafood option next.  Probably be happier as well at $5.75 than at the fancy five spice price point.\n\nIn all, worth hoofing it from the FiDi next time to try more of the menu.", "author": "KJ B."}

To the Yelpers who came before me: you were spot on; Golden Star has another fan.\n\nNow I caveat this review with the following: Golden Star is authentic in the sense that, cleanliness might be somewhat questionable and service will be aggressive and utilitarian--they will try to get you in and out as quickly as possible. And you'll be seated with a complete stranger. However, I want to speak to a different aspect of the service that I experienced at Golden Star.\n\nI had asked for a veggie version of the usually beef pho, felt somewhat misunderstood by the waiter, and so ordered a vermicelli salad. Five minutes later, however, I was brought a huge, steaming bowl of soup heaping with vegetables (bok choy, carrots, broccoli, baby corn, mushrooms), tofu, and noodles--an order tailored to my needs. Needless to say, it was *absolutely delicious*. (For serious vegetarians: ask whether the broth is chicken or vegetable; I get the feeling mine was chicken)\n\nI think the most surprising aspect of the meal came at the end--I didn't realize that Golden Star was cash-only, and was in a bit of a bind when the bill came. However, the waiter, in a gracious yet loud way , told me to come back tomorrow to pay, that it wasn't a problem.\n\nAnd you know what? I prefer great Vietnamese food over one free meal. I'm definitely coming back to Golden Star.", "author": "Erica M."}

Parking was as tough as before but we found a spot two blocks uphill.\nMy partner had the house special pho again and was delighted, particularly with the tripe and beef balls ($6.75).  I had a small bowl of the same, minus the beef balls, but loved the fresh taste and abundance of ingredients and condiments ($5.85). This time we split the shrimp and pork salad rolls (4 for $6.55) with a tasty peanut sauce and dollop of red chili. Two sodas: 2.80. Total cost: $23 with a generous tip.  Excellent, prompt service again.  On a cold, foggy evening, the pho was just the perfect remedy. I wish this place was in my neighborhood!\nMy partner and I have loved pho for years, but the best place we could find was in Oakland's Chinatown.\nNow we have a new favorite pho restaurant in S.F.  Before commenting on Golden Star, let us warn you that auto parking is prohibited on Lum Place.  But our waiter was nice enough to warn us of the $70 parking ticket so we found street parking two blocks uphill on Clay Street. (Parking is available a block away, but it's $7 a hour.)\nFor dinner, we both had the house special pho and imperial rolls.  The six rolls were perfectly done - crispy but not oily.  The pho was excellent - the broth (chicken?) was tasty and clean, not cloudy.  There were generous thin slices of beef, tendon and meatballs.  Most important to my partner, there was also lots of tripe.  The basil, bean sprouts and jalapeno peppers were fresh and there was a thick wedge of lemon alongside.\nMy partner had the large bowl (#1) while I had the small bowl (#3) that doesn't include meatballs.  With two orange sodas, our total bill was $23.64.  We left a generous tip because our waiter was fast and efficient and went out of his way to save us from a $70 parking ticket.\nSo allow time to find street parking, then settle in the restaurant for some excellent pho!", "author": "Philip C."}

I usually get the BBQ Pork noodle soup.  It is definitely not light on the fat, but it is heavy on the flavor.  I thank MSG for that.  I'm all for MSG or anything for that matter that makes my food taste better.  Their spring rolls are really good here too.  When I'm in the mood for something lighter I will get the rare beef noodle soup --- you know the one where they put raw beef slices in the hot broth and you let it cook to the desired temperature.  This meat is very lean, and I like it because I can control how red it stays.\n\nLike most places in Chinatown, this one isn't the prettiest or the most sparkling clean, though I wouldn't call it dirty.

If you were to choose Vietnamese in Chinatown, I would not select here. Why? They markup on their calculations! I received the bill and they have only indicate the food price w/ tax, not having subtotal addt'l line item showing tax. Okay, it's Chinatown, CASH only, and I've seen bills in that form, but I can't believe that a bowl of vermicelli was for $6.75 can end up being $7.45 with tax. DEFAULT calucations, that is a .70 tax on top of the price which is 10%, not a 8.5%. I don't mind giving them extra tips if they were nice about it, but the waitress screamed at me for being precise in informing them about their miscalculated tax on top of the price of the food. So, I felt this place deserves no STARS! How can a business  do that especially when you are already wrong and customers get an attitude for something a customer didn't do?
