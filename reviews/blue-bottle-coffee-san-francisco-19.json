{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-02", "description": "I don't have a problem owning up to it - on several occasions in the past, I've outright said I didn't think Blue Bottle was worth the hype.  Maybe it's because my taste in coffee isn't discerning enough (Pike Place is my go-to), but I just never understood why Blue Bottle was so revered.  That is, until now.  After all of these years, I finally figured out what the problem has been - I just haven't been ordering the right thing!  I KNEW it couldn't have been me...ha!\n\nOut of all of the different ones I've been to (here, Mint Plaza, and the Ferry Building), this particular Blue Bottle is by far my favorite.  Besides how it's (relatively) close to my office, it's also got a great feel to it.  The minimalist look, the spacious feel (compared to its sister spots), the fact I've always been able to snag a seat the times I've stuck around to enjoy my drink...not much to complain about!  Most importantly, they keep the line/crowds moving surprisingly fast!\n\nWhile I'd always stuck with their hot drinks in the past, I finally decided to try something different and ordered the NEW ORLEANS ICED COFFEE with Cane Sugar, Milk, and Roasted Chicory ($4.25).  Now, I don't want to oversell this, but talk about a game changer!  Not only did it have just the right amount of milk and sweetness to it, but it packed the perfect caffeinated punch - not overly strong, but it had a delicious, robust flavor to it.  Delicious!\n\nNow, as tasty as my drink was, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the fact that Blue Bottle is obviously on the pricey side.  Delicious to be sure, and certainly of better quality than the likes of Starbucks, but not all that cheap either.  Not that it would stop me from coming back again, not when I've finally discovered the drink to get to fully appreciate all that Blue Bottle has to offer!\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now.", "author": "Mike L."}

It's quite nice and relaxing. \n.\nBig community round table - great for large groups or one who wants to spread their work all over. \n.\nDrink - so I tried their elder berry sparkling water with cold brew. It wasn't my favorite, due to the flavor and not enough sweetness. It was just different, either love or dont like it. They were nice to let me switch back to my regular. \n.\nMy regular to go to is the new Orleans. But the girl told me they have oat milk and I'm like yasss! It's one of my new favorites so this is how your order it. One new Orleans with oat milk.  \n.\nOf thing I noticed about their coffee is that its strong, and they serve you these big ice cubes which slowly melts and doesn't water down your coffee. \n.\nOverall this is one of my new blue bottle coffee spot to actually chill when I'm in the city. Comfy with space, and air flowing in and out which is quite refreshing. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!", "author": "Alex T."}

It amazes and reminds me that, things don't always have to have a bunch of items in a room in order to catch ones eye. Best way to describe it is a simple and mellow vibe close to the SF ball park a couple blocks down.\n\nThe iced coffee to me was a little bit bitter and water down. I'm pretty sure there was a couple of grounds inside the pitcher that were not caught by the filter. I like coffee strong and that was NOT strong at all. \n\nI notice they do \"pour overs\" big fan of that, and will be back soon to see how well executed they can make one.\n\nJust note this place does have support or have WIFI like most shops would. \n\nNo pets are allowed in the shop, so be ready to tie your four legged friend outside, to the nearest pole within eye distance.", "author": "Elijajuan F."}

The staff is generally friendly and helpful if you have trouble deciding what you want. If it's a nice day out, it's awesome to take coffee (and maybe a pastry) to-go and hang out on South Park nearby. If you do decide to stay though, there's plenty of tables and seating, making it a good place to work.

Their South Park location keeps up the tradition with a warm and open store on 2nd Street near Bryant.\n\nThe layout is very nice with large picture windows and a white and light wood interior. They have the full menu with several coffee styles including espresso, pour over, and vacuum drip in a rather elaborate and beautiful device. Snacks and pastries are also available.\n\nThe coffee just happens to be great here too. They have a good house blend with single origin espresso available. The espresso was pulled well with a wonderful flavor, especially when poured over a large scoop of gourmet vanilla ice cream!\n\nService was great, although it does take a while to make a custom drink done right. The interior is almost as gorgeous as the customers enjoying their drinks inside and those unfortunate ones just walking by outside. This location is close to AT&T Park so expect crowds during Giants games. \n\nI'm used to great coffee in Sacramento, and San Francisco is really great too.

I wanted to try something different for once, but I defaulted back to a cold brew like I've always done anywhere else. I absolutely love the cold brew. BBC :-) is definitely on my list of top coffee shops. \n\nThe staff are friendly, and the woman helping me ran through a few items on the menu before I made a decision. This location is very spacious, with tables to accommodate small and large groups. The perfect place to get some studying or work done. I love the open space, with glass all around to bring in a lot of light. There are a number of baked goods that will get your mouth watering. I was tempted to try one, but remembered that brunch was shortly after this stop.\n\nIt's conveniently located near the park.

Yes, I'm talking to you, Meg Ryan. Fortunately I am too old - not for a facelift, mind you - but to play on the cool new jungle gym in South Park unlike a couple of entitled hipsters Jamie W. and I saw who thought nothing of sitting on the tire swing while actual children were waiting for them to leave.\n\nNo, my entertainment comes from the caffeinated libations being served at the fresh-looking new Blue Bottle on the 2nd Street side of the park. What can I say about Blue Bottle that I haven't already said in the five other reviews I've written about at their other locations? Not much except they are certainly consistent. It's a lovely individual pour, and I selected the $3.75 Three Africas blend because I just assumed three was better than one (photo: http://bit.ly/2uPFpVD), even though the Rwanda blend was a dollar more. Go figure.\n\nThere were the requisite baked goods including ridiculously large pretzel buns (photo: http://bit.ly/2w0joCp) and alluring sticky coffee pudding muffins (photo: http://bit.ly/2vnJSAp). Jamie and I stayed strong and kept our temptations at bay. Anyhow, as I was waiting, I was really enjoying the clean lines of the space. Very contemporary and most suitable for a South of market location. There was even a large round table commandeered by a silent group of presumed tech geeks, almost like they were hired as performance art (photo: http://bit.ly/2gIoTCW). I was just happy to take my coffee to one of the little metal stands in the park. That's what those are for, right?\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...the smoothness still shines here\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...one of the nicer Blue Bottles in the chain\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...oh, friendly enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Blue Bottle in a most idyllic urban setting", "author": "Ed U."}

Your age reducing detox facial has done wonders!!!\n\nIf I were running a business of any kind, and this space was available for rent, I'd swoop in and pay cash!!! The space is stunning!! Nice, clean lines, very modern and could easily pass for a hipster SF loft. Classy AF!!\n\nThis is by far the most practical and user friendly Blue Bottle shop I've ever been to. They represent the product extremely well and clearly the brand is on display for all to understand. Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could walk through the shop and would know within moments that they are within the Blue Bottle walls. \n\nNow, a fact that very well could be news to some of the coffee consumers in this area. The pour over, which I have come to believe is the only method of coffee brewing (hot coffee at least) that works for me. The owners of Blue Bottle went all the way to Japan, where the pour over was invented, to learn the art of the pour over. That's a solid nugget of intel to provide your \"friends\" with next time you sit down to drink coffee. \n\nNow, the barista on shift when I was here Sundee was an excellent coffee adviser. I asked him which coffee he preferred and he clearly read my mail. He said, \"the Three Africas holds up better to dairy and provides a creamy finish.\" Sold!! I generally refuse to order blends, but in Blue Bottle I trust. #Trust\n\nThe shop is nestled very well and I drove right by them without noticing the logo, but I think that's because I wasn't really looking for them. Full disclosure. I was on the way to (clears throat) Philz and couldn't find parking over there, so Yelped coffee and was pointed in the direction of BB. Found parking in the lot beside the shop and I suspect the parking Gods deserve some credit here cause that's not exactly the easiest hood to find a parking spot. Glad it worked out that way cause yeah, this is a really solid location to put your feet up and enjoy a solid cup of coffee.", "author": "Hector G."}

Given its prime location next to Small Foods, the previous coffeeshop that monopolized the \"SoMa cafe meeting,\" this Blue Bottle is especially brimming with South Park VCs taking meetings with founders and recruiting pitches.

On this visit, one pleasantly followed us to the table. All up it was $21 for two drinks and two cakes. Expensive if the quality was better, a plain rip off with this level of execution. \n\nThis in stark contrast to the Hayes Valley Blue Bottle which consistently produces well made drinks with a better selection of cakes, all in a place 1/8th the size. \n\nThe only redeeming factor is the location and the bright, spacious interior.

I am more excited about the beans themselves than getting a cup at the store location that often has huge lines. I also don't always enjoy the pour over method for all types of coffee types, that do much better in a french or aero press. Anyway, this review is really for the beans, which are some of the most exceptional in the bay area and reflect the types of things that wine experts go on about regarding \"terroir\" or the way that the composition of the soil and landscape inform the taste of a coffee bean.", "author": "Vadan Tereza R."}

They are SUPER SLOW. If you are in a hurry or so... don't even think about getting in the line. It might take up to 30 min... whaaaat? Yes... Design is pretty cool though.", "author": "Melanie K."}

I got the single origin Ethiopian on espresso... so yummy!  They have a really unique espresso machine there, it's built into the counter so all you see is the group head on the counter. Saint Franks has something similar, but this is even more minimalistic. Really cool. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!", "author": "Marie O."}

Would be an excellent place to work on your laptop but there is no WiFi. According to one of the baristas, this is on purpose. I imagine it's to prevent customers from staying for too long, but there is plenty of space and there are better ways to stop WiFi abuse than not having it at all. Furthermore, many people were using their phone to tether, so it doesn't seem to stop those with a data plan from camping out. It also closes at 6, which is a bit too early.", "author": "Daniel F."}

Highly recommended especially since it's at the same price point as the green Seattle mermaid chain.", "author": "Chris B."}
