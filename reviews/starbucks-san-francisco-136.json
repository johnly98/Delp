Alas, it was not true, this SB told me it was not yet released. \nWhile waiting in line, I noticed how well and respectful one of the staff treated \"Greg\".  She was a redhead with a short bob.  As she meticulously prepared the coffee orders, she would acknowledge \"Greg\" and replied to his repetitive comment.  \nIt was later, when a slender male co-worker arrived to work, who also knew Greg, told Greg to calm down (I didn't think Greg was upset or anything, just obsessive), told Greg they were busy and had to get back to work, and pointed towards the front door, while verbally, in a firm but non-abusive tone, told Greg he had to go outside/leave, and he did, with his cup of coffee in tow.   They should be commended for handling the situation in a diplomatic manner. \n\nI work with people who are sometimes disabled or have mental health issues and the situation could've escalated into something bad but the kindness the redheaded young lady showed Greg was just full of humanity.

I don't need a table for more than 30 minutes.  It is not fair that I have to stand around sucking down my coffee while other people, whose grande drip house brew has long since been consumed, are lording over the tables like it's their living room. I don't think I've ever stayed at a Starbucks more than an hour, and why would you want to, since their loungy music selection repeats about every 40 minutes?\n\nTable Trolls, get out! You should be prepared to pay to rent the space and the internet access that you so blithely believe to be yours all the livelong day.  Otherwise, move over because my butt needs a rest, too!", "author": "John S."}

It's always pretty crowded and never enough seating. If we're lucky, we could find a big table for the both of us but most of the time we just sat by the smaller tables made for one person. No biggie though, since we never needed too much table space. Every time we came here, our drinks have always been right. \n\nI came here recently within the past month on a Sunday evening with my sister. The interior looks really nice now! There's plenty of counter seating around with small tables here and there. Definitely looks more modern. Anyways onto the reason why I'm really yelping.. my sister ordered a Green Tea Frappuccino with java chips and caramel syrup and I got my usual Caramel Frappuccino. There was only one lady working behind the counter. Not so unusual because it wasn't a busy night. But then when we got our drinks.. she forgot the caramel syrup in my sister's drink (at first I thought she might have blended in the caramel.. but nope didn't taste any trace of it) and my \"caramel\" drink ended up being a Chai Frappuccino.. what the heck?! Good thing I wasn't feeling too picky that day because I NEVER had a Chai Frappuccino before so I didn't mind it TOO much.. but to mess up our drinks like that and even writing it correctly on the cup was disappointing. \n\nThree stars for the good ol' times.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-11", "description": "Sometimes it can get a little stressful during a work day so coming to this Starbucks might just be the perfect remedy.  You get coffee and you get good laughs.  The absolute best waker upper indeed!\n\nI've been coming here maybe 5 times a week religiously for close to 2 years now until recent.  They've always had a long line and poorly managed staff.  Make no mistake, most the employees are just awesome but the speed of service is poorly managed by the manager and/or supervisor.  Coming from managing successful well branded flagship stores (not going to name where) of my own for many years leading each store I touched to drastically increase in sales in all aspects and customer service ratings as well as managing a small flourishing office these days, makes me a bit of a snob when I see major noticeable inefficiencies.  I literally stopped coming here recently after the most comedic encounter... TWICE!  I couldn't bear to endure another stomach cramping laugh cuz it hurt so damn much... So I just had to remove myself from this location and opt for the Stonestown or Twin Peaks location where it's a serious get shit done type of Starbucks... Ok not that serious but you get what I mean.\n\nI order a grande soy latte every work day for KB since she can't function early morning without it.  More superstitious than anything of coffee fiends I think but who am I to judge.  I don't drink coffee.  I have no idea.  For snackings KB and I tend to always lean towards the butter croissant so of course that's what we'd order majority of the time.  However, the croissants would come out flattened from their tongs they use every once in a while.  I'd always request beforehand for them not to crush my croissant.  Hey call me high maintenance but I like croissants for their buttery fluffy flakiness... not when it's a dense clump of butter pastry.  Please someone tell me that's a reasonable request.  Most the staff will make sure it comes out the way it supposed to be.  Somehow the comedy came rather recently and this is how it went down with 2 very particular staff members, one of them being the manager, on 2 occasions.\n\n\nFirst occasion:\n\nDee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee! (As the oven would sound)\n\nDirty blonde: COLIN! (Hands me bag)\n\nI look inside.\nMe: Excuse me.  Is it possible that you don't smash my croissant next time?  It's OK this time.\n\nDirty blonde: I can't.\n\nMe: You... Can't?  I don't get it.\n\nDirty blonde: I can't.  That's how it comes out.\n\nMe: It's never like that at La Boulange or other Starbucks around here.\n\nDirty blonde: It can't be.  The croissant caves in once we heat it up.\n\nMe: You mean like... It implodes?\n\nDirty blonde: Yes it just caves in so there's nothing I can do about.\n\nMe: *chuckles* Are you serious?!?! Never heard of that before.  That's so funny! I'm sure you could adjust your grasp of the tongs. Kinda pisses me off I'm paying for this but whatever I just won't order this from you ever again.\n\nDirty blonde: Sorry. Can't do anything about it.\n\nThat was just hilarious n irritating at the same time.  Where do they come up with this stuff?!?!  At least think before you come up with some random answer that makes no sense at all.\n\n\nSecond occasion:\n\nMe: A grande soy latte... And a butter croissant but can you make sure it doesn't come out flattened?\n\nSammie (manager): No we can't.\n\nMe: Why? It shouldn't be too much effort...\n\nSammie: I know who you are. I remember you. You were yelling in here about that the other day causing a scene.\n\nMe: Wow... Really?  (Now asking other employees who I remember was there that day) You two were here a few days ago... Was I being loud or causing a scene?\n\nBarista 1 (Latin Kid): She's speaking for herself... That's not what happened.\n\nBarista 2 (Long dark hair braided girl): Don't worry about her... she's always like that.\n\nMe: (Speaking to Sammie in a very chuckling and chill manner) Now that you are accusing me in front of everyone waiting in line, I want to review the videos with you.  Please take me to your video recordings because I really need to see this so you can prove me wrong.\n\nSammie: No.  We don't have videos.\n\nMe: Uh... then why are those cameras set up?\n\nThat was just too much.  I was literally laughing at this point and the always cool baristas (those 2 especially) were just chuckling along with me.\n\nJust for kicks, ask for \"Dirty Blonde\" and/or Sammie, order a croissant, and ask them to be careful to not flatten it.  Please let me know how it goes.  ;P\n\nSo yes... come here for a coffee and good laughs.  You will surely wake up from stomach cramps!\n\nI wanna give 1 star but most the employees are super cool which earns them 2 stars. As long as the poor management continues to fail on hospitality they will never get more than that.", "author": "Colin M."}

It's got a nice neighborhood feel where upon entering you'll see folks sipping their coffee, working on a crossword or you'll see some kids drinking hot cocoa chilling with their parents before a day out. \n\nService is fast, drinks have been great so far. Parking is really difficult (don't park in the bank building or you'll get towed!). The only problems with this place are: there is never any place to sit because it's so busy, the tables are usually pretty dirty because it's so busy, and there is no outside seating.

Since WiFi sucks here we skip tablet and do this. It has been a while since I have inland deep inside SF in a neighborhood. They are like villages hiding and pretending to be 100% city. Do they have enough of their own culture to be unique? I think so. And you can tell the locals are the culture. I sit here looking out the window. In any commercial setting this would be the perfect seat. It is. I am looking out and I see nothing. No building. No people. No cars. No views. Nothing stands out making this seat a worthwhile spot. That is a neighborhood. People are happy being as they are. They don't have to go commercial and fix everything. That is very American. It must have property value and it must be worth selling so sooner or later somebody shows up to fix. A developer or city. They fix them buildings. They fix intersection. Heck they even fix the people too. They probably have to go so property values are safe. Yep. That is America everyone complains about. It has NO people. This hidden village amidst an evil city run by the devil and his minions who change leading guards often not to be noticed, has people. They are happy. They are hiding. They pretend they are Franciscans. Go San Francisco. Until they are discovered they are safe. Then is NO people again. Property values overrule. The coffee is good today.

Both were good but man, I remember back in the day that the rice krispy treats were huge and now, well they're not so much.  Damn economy.

Tonight I went to Starbucks with a few friends because we all felt a desire for a coffee run. My order was taken by a barista by the name of Matt, and he also made our drinks. Not only was he friendly and kind, he gave off such a great vibe and sounded quite sincere when he wished us a good night and thanked us for our visit. When he called our drinks he also added in a vibrant tone, that \"at west portal Starbucks we try our best to make it like the photo\" which I agree, my caramel br\u00fbl\u00e9e latte looked definitely fantastic! I've never found a need to post reviews but his service to me tonight was so wonderful it has to be remarked upon, so thank you Matt for such wonderful service tonight (: !

I come here with my cousin all the time, and they always mess up her order. Open up your ears, its not even complicated!  They never say sorry either or act like they were at fault.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-07", "description": "I love the fact that I can go to any Starbucks in the world and get the drink I order  the way I want it.  I know what to expect.  Now with each store there are variances:  \n\nParking at West Portal notoriously sucks.  Sometimes at odd hours you can get parking but most of the time I have to circle a few times around the block ( I would rather circle and park on that block then have to run or walk 3 blocks in 4 inch heels) to get a parking spot.  But really never more than maybe 3 trips around the block.  People are going in and out of those spots all the time.  \n\nThere is always a line anywhere between 7:30am to 8:30am.  Figures, everyone in the world is trying to get their morning coffee, not just me.   The staff tries to move it along and while going in and seeing a line 15 people deep may scare you, I've been in slower moving lines, they really do try.  \n\nThe drinks are great, and the staff is very nice and accommodating.  Usually in the mornings, not all the tables are full as most people in that 15 person line are getting their drinks to go to work with.  In the afternoons though almost every seat is taken with students and people alike.  So if you see a seat, snag it!  \n\nOne thing to note: there are always always cops in here, I think this is the safest spot in the city.  I have been here at times when there were 3 cop cars lined up double parked outside.  Was there an emergency in there?  No, just cops getting coffee.  I mention this because when I had my car broken into less than a mile away on Monterey Blvd, it took 1.5 hours for a cop to come see me, and I have a sneaky feeling it was because the 3 cop cars were on break at West Portal!!!  Maybe not all of them have to take a break at once?  Just a thought.  \n\nAnyway, my one complaint that keeps it from being a 5 star review would be that whenever I have gotten a seat here, the tables and seats are always messy.  I know they work hard and have to deal with lines of people, but maybe just once in awhile they could come and wipe the tables down?  I don't mind doing it, but I don't have that wet towel they have behind the counter, and sometimes a napkin doesn't get all the sticky spills off like their towels do.  \n\nThat's it for me.", "author": "Denise B."}

But one thing Starbucks is consistent in is providing a safe, clean, non-annoying place to sit and relax for a stretch. This location in particular. I have never had anything but nice and helpful service, the bathrooms are clean, and the people who tend to spend time at this location are courteous. Throw in the free wi-fi, and you have a winner. It also is one of the only places in the West Portal area that is open past 8 or 9pm, let alone late evening, which is why I originally ventured to this location.\n  The main problem is is this location is so good at providing these things, it is often difficult finding a seat or an outlet for your electronics. It could use some more computer friendly seating, as since as soon as someone gets one of the prime seats, they are not giving it up for awhile.\n  So 2 stars for the coffee, 4 stars for the late nights service and seating and free wi-fi.", "author": "Miss Kae O."}

But their service is what makes me really angry and upset. It was so bad that I decided to sign up a Yelp account and write this review. I got 4 cake pops and a tall caramel flan Frap. I asked her to spilt it in 3 transactions since not everything were for me. She gave me a very annoyed look and asked again how I would like to do. I explained to her again and told her what exactly I would like to do. I literally said twice that I would like the frap in one transaction, 2 cake pops in one, and the other 2 cake pops in another transaction. So assuming she understood, when she asked me to scan my Starbucks card the first time. I just did without questioning. Then, I realized the first transaction was for all 4 cake pops, then one for the frap. She said she thought I had another drink, and said she had already charged the cake pops together. What surprised me the most was she just said \"bye, next\" after she told me she had made a mistake of what the customer asked her to do. There was no apology or anything. It's true that this is just a very minor issue, really no big deal if they made a mistake. But how she handled the situation and how she treated the customers was really unacceptable. I really wanted to publish her name here, but I'm also worried if it'll bring her a lot of damage. I thus decide to just briefly describe this cashier. She is not very tall, about 5'3\", rather dark skin, with long hair. She was the only dark skin person among others in her shift. It was a Thursday at around 5:30pm. So, be aware, everyone! I really hope someone can tell her what is the right attitude to have working in the customer services field, whether you're only the cashier or barrister, or a manager of a department store.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}
