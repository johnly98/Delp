His biggest issue was the addition of milk to the equation. Milk, to hear him tell it, is a commodity equivalent in price to Rhino Horn.\n\nAt that point I just asked for a refund, which he gave me, along with the report that \"Usually people don't want to ask for a bigger cup because its awkward. So you're lucky that I have the time to talk to you.\" \n\nI told him that I felt like the luckiest girl in the world. \n\n--\n\nTLDR: Don't waste your time. This place (or at least this tall angry blonde dude) doesn't know how to treat humans, and they don't have a monopoly on espresso drinks.\n\nPeople go to coffee places as much for the ambiance and the customer service as for the coffee.

I also think it had to be my most enjoyable food experience during this past weekend visit to SF.  The barista was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and down to earth.  Seducing chocolates, chocolate chip cookies, and as their name reflects, they offer wine, coffee and more.  I was mainly here for a little sweet after a savory breakfast.  \n\nIced Coffee:\nI was so intrigued by the Kyoto Slow Drip Filter and the fact that takes 12 hours to filter Iced Coffee.  The barista took the time to explain the who, what, why, and how.  This filter's slow process allows for the coffee bean oils to seep through and the finished coffee product maintains the integrity of the coffee beans (this easily and quickly occurs with the hot water process).  It's a full bodied iced coffee that would be great on a hot day.  I had a sample and it was bold in flavor and body.  \n\nMexican Hot Chocolate:\nThe Mexican hot chocolate (enough cayenne and cinnamon to add more flavor to the palette) was so delicious and the spiciness kicked down the sweetness. The barista indicated that they will soon introduce a ganache cocoa made in-house.  She also mentioned, sad face, that the Mexican hot chocolate will likely be phased out as the current chocolate vendor discontinued this item, but Stanza may continue to make it with the newbie in-house ganache cocoa... hopefully they do when I come back to visit!", "author": "Nova P."}

I've been to a lot, too.\n\nI'm not really in a position to attest to the experience of this coffee shop if you're popping in for a quick drink and running out, but what would a yelp review matter in that context anyways? If you're there to have a chat with people who are passionate about what they do, but more importantly are enthusiastic to know who you are, what you're about, what brought you to the city, what music is playing, or where's a good spot to grab a bite to eat, it's perfect. The shop is clean, the drinks/food delicious, the bar has plenty of outlets for your devices, and the staff could care less if you spend a long time sitting there working and reading and jamming to some music.\n\nIf you're having a hard time finding a smile from an assuredly exasperated employee and you're on yelp to confirm you insecurities that a person who was too stressed and too busy making complicated and delicious drinks for the long line of impatient customers to give you a forced smile and the patience your (no more than) $5 buys you, you're doing it wrong.\n\nIf you want a place however where you can sit down, plug in your phone/laptop, get a little work done, hear some really awesome music, enjoy some unique art from local artists, talk coffee, talk music, make a few new acquaintances, drink truly delicious drinks and eat truly delicious pastries, and get an overall feel for the hardworking, positive, interesting, and energetic vibe that Haight street made a name for itself on, you've come to - not the right -, but the perfect place.\n\nI work remotely out of coffee shops, and I have the entire time I've lived in SF. I've been to one in every neighborhood, and some are really great. Having said that, Stanza is my favorite coffee shop bar none.

And apparently (according to some other reviews), I'm not the only one who's been dished some snarky rudeness from the aloof, we're-too-cool-for-you hipsters behind the bar.\n\nDespite it being a chilly, Karl-filled day, the door was wide-open. Which is fine. I live in San Francisco; I dress in layers. But when the cigarette smoke wafting into the cafe was so strong that my throat stung and my eyes watered (seriously, I might as well have been smoking the cigarette myself), I thought that *perhaps*, rather than be confrontational and say anything to the two guys smoking less than a foot from the entrance, I could just quietly close the door. Apparently not. The guy behind the counter (the same one that other reviewers have noted smokes less than a foot from the door himself) said, \"Actually, we need the door open. It gets humid in here.\" And that would be fine. But he didn't have to say it with a rude and condescending tone, and, furthermore, it's not as if they actually roast their own beans at Stanza. THAT gets humid. I've been in plenty of roasteries, many of which in places that experience sub-freezing temperatures for 6 months of the year. They had their doors shut. And yes, it gets a little humid--with the awesome thick, and sweet smell of coffee ... I digress. Point is, I've been in Stanza before when the front door was closed, and they also have a back door that could be opened instead. But nonetheless, I didn't argue. I reopened the door, and simply said, \"Ok. Is it alright then if I ask the people smoking outside to just move downwind?\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes at me. Overtly. I kid you not. Then, in a tone even ruder and more condescending than before, said, \"No. It's Haight Street. It happens. Get used to it. Welcome to The Haight.\" And he laughed out loud, rolled his eyes some more, and muttered further mockery under his breath to the other barista and to a customer who apparently was more the type he appreciated serving. (Because we've heard from other reviewers that they will ignore customers flat-out in order to \"serve those who work on Haight Street first.\")\n\nI'm all for neighborhood pride. I'm all for matching expectations to the environment (and don't mind at all when my morning coffee is interrupted by police and paramedics responding to overdose episodes outside Coffee to the People). It's Haight St. I get it. I'm also all for going the extra mile to keep local patrons happy. But, I'm also all for politeness and kindness to everyone, regardless of whether or not they appear to be worthy of your oh-so-hip and pretentiously-unpretentious Haight Street groopies. \n\nYou wanna keep your door open so your buddies can smoke outside and your customers can relish in the fumes of secondhand smoke, because, \"It's Haight Street. Get used to it.\"? That's fine. I might not come back, but I wouldn't be writing this review. I'm writing this review because you were extremely rude about it. No one likes to be laughed at.\n\nThanks for \"Welcoming me to The Haight.\" \n\nAnd, for the record, (not that it should matter), I actually live here. On Ashbury St. And I definitely won't be coming back. Which is too bad, because you do make good coffee. So, grudgingly, I couldn't give you just one star.", "author": "Bronwyn V."}

He spent awhile chatting with them about coffee, and made recommendations as I waited patiently. Neither he nor the guy at the espresso machine acknowledged me. After a few minutes, some other dude stood behind me in line, and was immediately greeted by both employees, who took his order and started on it while finishing up with the couple. When they left, register guy rang up the new customer. The customer politely (and correctly) indicated that they should help me first. I was so taken aback by the entire situation that I couldn't help asking \"yes, why are you helping him before me?\" Register guy said, in a super exasperated voice, \"I help the people who work on Haight Street first,\" as if 1) I should magically know where the guy works, and 2) that's a valid reason to totally ignore another customer. I was so put off by his attitude that I walked out without ordering anything.\n\nAnyways. I know this guy is a dick, and I shouldn't judge the entire place based on him. However, his behavior is close enough to the general vibe I've been getting all along that I don't feel comfortable patronizing this business anymore. I don't like being treated like I'm invisible, especially when I'm a regular customer. I'd estimate that I've spent a minimum of $500 here, and you know what? I'm going to spend the next $500 someplace that doesn't leave me in a bad mood. Stanza can stick with the customers it truly values - apparently these are the people who work down the street, and are probably getting free or discounted coffee.

When I placed my order with the barista, I was impressed by his knowledge about how to make a drink taste great. What my heart desired was a dirty chai latte but he recommended that since their chai is on the spicy side, the espresso may change the intended flavor. At first, that was a bit disappointing to hear but when I took my first sip, it was love. I've had many chai lattes, but none of them have ever had the kind of creamy, soothing texture that this one did.

This makes it sloooow. \n\nThey also basically serve only coffee. A few pastries made elsewhere and that's about it. No brown sugar just white. So, pretty minimal.

I've been on a quest to find that same quality at other cafes.  Luckily, San Francisco has many coffee shops that do it right...you just have to find them.\n \nToday, I found Stanza (thanks to Yelp).  They make Kyoto style iced coffee, which I didn't really know anything about (other than that it's good - sophisticated, I know!) until reading this article: http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/ristretto-kyoto-to-stay/.  It takes MUCH longer to brew, and has an unmistakable flavor - once you've had it, you'll compare every other coffee in your life to it.  It doesn't need any cream or sugar added.  So now, there are two types of coffee shops - the ones that make iced coffee this way, who treat coffee brewing and latte making like a craft, and the ones who don't.  Stanza is the first kind.\n \nAs for the coffee shop itself, it's very cute inside, but there aren't an abundance of seats, and I wouldn't describe it as \"comfy.\"  If  you come during peak time, you may not get a place to sit, which doesn't matter anyway if you're just looking to get coffee to go.  The service was pleasant enough, but not warm. \n \nHowever, they still deserve 5 stars, because the only thing that REALLY matters - the quality of their product - is excellent.", "author": "Ashley M."}

The woman who helped us either had a VERY dry sense of humor or was just plain rude but either way it wasn't the type of service anyone really enjoys while ordering their coffee. Every question I asked was met with a quick reply and no elaboration. I asked if they had Mexican hot chocolate because I had seen something on Yelp about it and the woman just said \"no we don't have that.\" So then I asked if it was seasonal or something and she said \"no that's some other store.\" Seriously, if you don't like dealing with talking to people and being helpful I really think this type of job isn't your calling...but hey that's just my opinion. My girlfriends and I were waiting to get picked up by my boyfriend who was stuck in traffic and we were told that they were closing really soon and the inflection in the woman's voice was basically like \"..... So leave\". Promptly at 8:00 we were told that we had to leave with a very rude tone even though they were clearly still cleaning up behind the counter. If it was really that necessary that we leave immediately it would have been nice to at least have been asked nicely instead of in a demeanor closer to the phrase \"don't let the door hit you on the way out.\" \n\nAs for the quality of the drinks, it was okay. I've definitely had much better coffee. And the chai tea latte was mediocre.", "author": "Beca P."}
