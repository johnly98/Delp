Desperate for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, the first disappointment was Estela's lack of it, only offering bacon and ham options. \n\nOrdered a bacon egg and cheese bagel (they only had wheat) and a ham egg and cheese croissant to go. Very promising upon first sight. Cut in half perfectly, and after separating each half we were astounded by probably the best cheese stretches we've seen in our lives, fresh out of a commercial. After that, it all went downhill. Upon taking a closer look at the eggs, we both noticed a bluish/black green tint with white blotches throughout. This completely ruined our appetites and after a few minutes of google searches and careful deliberation, decided to give up on the sandwiches entirely.

The major bad experience involved dealing with a very cranky and disgruntled employee, perhaps a manager.  It was early in the afternoon and the place was totally empty except for a few employees.  I was looking through the door unsure if I should enter because it might be too early when this older guy with longish hair yells over, \"What are you staring at? Are you coming in?\" Thinking his ridiculously inappropriate tone was sarcasm, I went in and ordered.  As I was giving him the order, he seemed annoyed to be there.  He was totally uninterested in what I was saying to the point where it was simply rude.  He took my money and barked the order at a teenage girl who made the sandwich.  As I waited, I saw him continually scold her as she made my food.  When my food was ready, the main literally threw the bag on the counter saying, \"Here\"!  The food is fair at best.  Meats tend to be on the slimy side which isn't great.  On top of the rude service, they're overpriced.  There are MANY other options nearby with friendly service, quality food and good prices.

In the end, I didn't want to push my luck, so I abandoned the bread altogether and just ate the insides. \n\nStill, I liked pretty much everything else about this place. The sandwich ingredients were fresh and well balanced, the ambiance and service were nice, the sandwich selection was diverse and interesting, and the smoothie was delicious. Oh, and there are several other bread choices! \n\nI'll definitely be back, not for a rematch with that particular bread, but to try another of their sandwiches on a different bread.\n\nGive it a try.

At first glance, the sandwich looked promising: the croissant was more attractive than the competition across the street, though it was over-toasted and burnt in some parts - whatever, I was willing to forgive that mistake.  But the real problem was the eggs.... I have never had such disgusting eggs in my life!  They were scrambled and blue in several parts.  How does that even happen??!  I'm familiar with the bluish tint between the yolk and the white of a hard boiled egg, but it was the first time I'd ever seen it in scrambled eggs!  Moreover, the eggs were way overcooked and dry - amongst the worst I've ever had.  Additionally the bacon was not crispy.

Got it and saw a HUGE slab of turkey and literally could not see any Roast beef. The counter person helped dig out the thin slice of roast beef there. She asked me if I wanted more and I said sure. She took the sandwich back for about five minutes and it returned with MAYBE one more fine layer of roast beef, still very hard to see against the HUGE slab of Turkey. Seemed like the Roast beef was kind of a gimmick. Didn't really get what happened there. \n\nIn any case, the sandwich really was delicious so what to do.

It was a difficult decision, but I ended up getting the #21 which came with smoked turkey, sprouts, balsamic vinaigrette, tomato, red onion and cheese.  The sprouts were fresh; the turkey was sliced in front of me (yay for meat slicers!).  Their portions are huge!  I love that it comes with a pickle and peppercini.  I left feeling full and healthy.   I forgot to mention the best part.... the focaccia bread!  It was fluffy, flavorful, and went well with the balsamic vinaigrette.  I couldn't imagine choosing any other type of bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-26", "description": "TIP #1: Estela's makes a wide variety of big, fresh sandwiches. Perfect for lunch.\n\nTIP #2: The menu is on the back wall, so you are facing away from the counter when you are reading it. This makes it a little difficult to order. \n\nThe problem with sandwich shops that offer a ton of options--including a complex build-your-own system--is that the sandwiches are more likely to be mediocre. Fortunately, the sandwiches at Estela's are as advertised: fresh!\n\nAt lunch, the restaurant was bustling, but not too packed with people; my friend and I were able to order our sandwiches and find a place to sit within minutes of arriving. I was overwhelmed by the extensive menu! There are close to three dozen named sandwiches, at least 10 of which are vegetarian. The rest are packed with meat! You can add avocado to any sandwich for a fee. And if you somehow cannot find an appetizing combination, you can make your own--just try to choose between all the meats, cheeses, breads and spreads. It was dizzying in a good way. \n\nAfter you order, sit down, relax, and your food will be brought to you.\n\nI had the Brie sandwich, not because I'm vegetarian, but because I love brie more than lunchmeat sometimes. Besides generous chunks of creamy, savory brie, the sandwich was balanced out with tomato, basil, onions, and sun-dried tomato pesto--all on the largest piece of the softest foccacia ever. That sandwich was so satisfying to eat--not surprising given THE freshness of the ingredients! The pickle and banana peppers that came with it were crisp and fresh as well. \n\nA great spot for a quick lunch! Looking forward to go back soon.", "author": "A.L. H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-17", "description": "Estela's is great for a few reasons:\n\n1. It is located in a part of town that is ridden with tourist restaurants. The kind that say 5 stars, but when you show up you realize the ambiance is tourist hell and the food is at best subpar. Estela's offers a lovely reprieve from both the mediocre food and maddening tourist scene.\n\n2. The juice bar is really the winner here in my opinion. Compared to some other fresh juice bars in the city the prices are insanely affordable! I'm talking under 5 bucks for a fresh squeezed LARGE juice. In SF that's unheard of. They make great concoctions, or you have the option to create your own.\n\n3. The sandwiches are quite yummy. I wouldn't say that they can stand up to an Ike's or Atlas sandwich, but given Estela's huge wins in categories one and two I'm giving them 5 stars.", "author": "Meagan W."}

I used to go to the Haight Street location all the time but when I moved I discovered I didn't always want to schlep across town for a good sandwich. And Estela's used to have the best sandwiches in town. \n\nFast Forward a few years: Estela's and I are close to one another again. I was so excited when I realized they had re-opened!! That excitement has turned bittersweet. \n\nThey just can't seem to get it together at this location. They have screwed up EVERY order I have ever placed. Every order.  I want to stress that.\n\nLike a glutton for punishment, I kept going back. But today I lost my patience: I said \"no tomatoes, I'm allergic\" and sandwich maker said \"no tomato\". We reviewed my simple order (the only change was the omission of tomato) three times and yet when I happened to glance over when she was making my sandwich and she was putting on tomatoes! I screeched unintentionally, the other customers jumped and I had to again clarify that I didn't want anything red on my sandwich. When I was handed my sandwich, I said \"thank you, have a nice day\" and got only a scowl in response. \n\nAnd now I am writing this review while I eat my very last Estela's sandwich.

The large variety of sandwiches are delicious and huge. Amazing vegetarian options, which is a rarity in Lower Nob. It's great if you want a lunch spot or to pick up an early dinner. \n\nNow, why I gave it three stars. It's clear that the owner and people who work there do not want to be at this location. I get it -- it's painful to lose a home where you felt part of the community and contributed to its spirit. But don't take it out on Lower Nob residents with attitude simply because we aren't Lower Haight/Hayes Valley.\n\nThis is a different neighborhood with its own rhythm and patterns -- that means, yes, you should have a stronger breakfast offering that you can serve to people *quickly* in the morning because we are on foot and en route. It means you should learn to make a decent latte (have yet one there made well or above tepid). It means you should take a little time to understand the reasons people live in this neighborhood and adapt. You don't have to fundamentally change your offering to do that and if you did meet us just a little bit, we'd repay you with our business.", "author": "Cherie D."}

My favorite is the Avalon fka the big sherm.  Second favorite is the carrot.  These are delicious fresh sandwiches, not all meat calorie bombs on Dutch crunch rolls.", "author": "Wakako U."}

They're priced $7.50-8.50. The sandwiches are big and the ingredients seemed fresh yet disappointing. There was only one other person in line and two other customers in the shop already had their food yet it took 15 minutes to get my sandwich. It was a cold sandwich and the bread was not toasted so I have no idea what took so long. And my request for no onions was ignored.", "author": "keith s."}

(and cheap!!)\nI recently stumbled into this spot and was blown away by the variety their menu has to offer. They have so many options for vegetarians that I seriously had to restrain myself from screaming with joy. I recommend trying The Green-Green. One of the best, vegetarian sandwiches I have had in a very long time. I inhaled that sucker like there was no tomorrow.\nAnd if you are a meat eater, there are a ton of options for you tool! This is a perfect place for my carnivorous boyfriend and my herbivore self to engage. Heavily.\nNot to mention their delicious smoothies!! They are a great way to recover from a hard night out, or just a wonderful, refreshing, way to wake up. The BBB is perfect. I'm dreaming about it right now...maybe I'll just go get one before I finish this post.. \nI am so happy that this place is right down the street from my house cause I plan on going there as frequently as possible.\nGO HERE! You will not be disappointed.", "author": "Danae L."}

I am a vegetarian, and they had at least 8 veggie sandwiches.  My boyfriend and I split two, starting with the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto and the Lil Caesar sandwiches.  The Sun Dried Tomato came on a baguette, and surprisingly the balsamic dressing it had slightly overpowered the sun dried tomato, but it made it so delicious.  Fresh with veggies and smoked gouda cheese, it was so good!  The Lil Caesar was very true to a caesar salad as well, with a layer of shredded cheese on the bottom, romaine, tomato and caesar dressing.  It was on a focaccia roll, and if you are a caesar salad lover it will hit the spot, although we found it a bit rich.  The staff is very friendly and it didn't take long at all to make.  I am excited to go back and try the other sandwiches!", "author": "Megan H."}
