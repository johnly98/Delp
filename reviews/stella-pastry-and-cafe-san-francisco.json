{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "I came to Stella Pastry & Cafe on a Saturday afternoon. The line was about 5 parties long, but I didn't mind - all the more time to admire all the delectable pastry options and try to narrow down which slice of cake I wanted to enjoy! I ended up deciding upon the chocolate fondant slice. Absolutely no regrets: it was incredible - rich, creamy, buttery, and 100% chocolatey! The chocolate Stella uses is quite intense, and extremely high quality. Also, there was a good balance of cake flour to chocolate fondant - every bite I took was perfectly layered, with a consistent harmony of flour to fondant ratio.  It was a little pricy - $6 - but worth the occasional splurge. The light dusting of cocoa powder on the top added a tinge of bitterness that evened out the saccharine sweetness. If you are not a fan of dark chocolate, I would not recommend ordering the chocolate fondant, but dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate, so no complaints there! \n\nThe only reason why I am docking one star is because I don't think the interior is very cozy, or intimate - this is not a place I would sit and chat and have a pastry with a friend. It is quite dark, and a little dingy. The cafe is long / narrow, but it only has one window at the front of the store. There is no outside patio, so if you order a slice of cake, you have to eat it inside.\n\nNonetheless, I ever come back to SF, I will absolutely come back again to try the chocolate hazelnut cake and the chocolate fedora slice, as well as the cheesecakes and cannolis!", "author": "Claire L."}

Stella's is a little italian bakery with a large variety of Italian cookies, cakes, cheesecakes and cannoli's. \n\nI grabbed a slice of their signature cake, the black and white, and a cannoli, which was 16 dollars out the door. Although some may see this as pricey, each dessert was very generous, especially the black and white cake which filled up one third of my togo box!\n\nAlthough I wasn't a fan of the cannoli, with its gritty textured filling, I was very impressed with the cakes. Moist, sponge cake, fluffy, perfectly sweetened filling and rich decadent ganache really made these desserts splendid. The signature sponge cake with rum was delicious, and I would come back for that.\n\nAlthough service left some to be desired, the desserts are a must try.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "How on earth have I not written a review for Stella? I spent a large chunk of my childhood in North Beach, and both Stella and Victoria pastries were staples as long as I can remember. Their signature dessert, the sacripantina, is what dreams are made of. The layers of sponge cake are light as air, and perfectly balanced with creamy zabaione and a hint of rum. To people that have never had the sacripantina, I always describe it as a slightly lighter version of tiramisu, though it is still downright decadent. Their tiramisu is also rich and perfectly executed, though I rarely order it as I feel like tiramisu is available everywhere, whereas the sacripantina is unique to Stella. They also have the absolute best cannoli that I've ever had. I'm not sure what magic they add to the filling, but I could easily eat it by the spoonful. Definitely something worth writing home about. \n\nThey also have a HUGE selection of italian cookies, biscotti, and macaroons; you can mix and match and they're sold by the pound, about $20/lb last I checked, though it's been a while since I've stocked up on cookies. I'm a huge almond/marzipan junkie, so my personal favorites are the amoretti cookies and the chocolate dipped florentines. Add a plain drip coffee (or a cappuccino if I'm feeling fancy) and I'm in heaven! \n\nThe bakery itself is tiny and only has a few two-top tables, but if you're lucky enough to snag a window seat, North Beach has some prime people watching!", "author": "Justine L."}

My sister and I went to Saints Peter and Paul as kids, so North Beach was our stomping grounds as little tiny kids; we used to visit their sister bakery, Victoria, more often before their move, but have in recent years grown more keen on Stella. Any time we're back in San Francisco, we make it a point to drop by (plus, the number of friends looking for recommendations we've sent here is astronomical). \n\nWe've probably tried just about every single pastry and cookie in the cases at this point, but always find ourselves gravitating back to the signature sacripantina and the cannoli. The sacripantina is everything I'm ever looking for in a dessert: a light and airy cake, yet somehow not at all dry, with the faintest aftertaste of liquor. Regardless of how large a meal I had beforehand, I can always find room for it in my belly. The cannoli is also spectacular, certainly one of the best I've ever had. The shell is crispy and fresh, but not too hard, while the filling is creamy but light and not at all too sweet. The amount of chocolate chips is just perfect; not too many and not too few. \n\nWe generally opt for just regular coffees when we come here; black coffee + these two pastries is an unbeatable combination. The flavors balance out perfectly. An added bonus, they serve Lavazza coffee, which is always a dependable choice. \n\nDefinitely don't miss out on Stella if you're in he neighborhood, and don't be afraid of the long line. It always moves pretty quickly, and is absolutely well worth the wait.", "author": "Justie L."}

For those who are wary about eating cheese, ricotta is more creamy than cheesy. Definitely big enough to share. 3.5/5.\n\nThe tiramisu-- ahh, I feel like I feel the same way about every tiramisu, which is not coffee flavored enough. This one was more coffee flavored than most, with a generous layer of whip cream on the top, but I still think that more coffee would have helped, and also more cream! Alas.... The cake could have been a tad bit more moist, but that's just personal preference. 3.3/5.\n\nService was friendly and extra points to them for wrapping the desserts with such care and even adding a bow on top!

That's what I want. I should have had at least one other person with me when I walked in the door of Stella late one night (where were you? what are you waiting for?) but alas, I was alone and I ordered many cookies. I wanted to order a cannoli, but at the same time I didn't. I was stuffed. I had come from a dinner of all the fried things, and my body just wouldn't accept it. So I need to come back and get all the things and I need someone with a sweet tooth and a love for chocolate and baked goods to come with--are you in?\n\nBody pain aside, everything was delicious. I have come to really love those somewhat chewy pine nut cookies at Italian bakeries, and I'm loving that they gave me two instead of the one that I asked for, as I wolfed it right down. They were confused when I asked for a lunette, as they just call them shortbread cookies, but I'm not going crazy. Indeed it is a less common name for those shortbread cookies with apricot or other jams in between two layers, with one layer cut out in a small hole. The employee behind the counter didn't seem to like my approach for conversation on the matter, so I just shut my mouth and pointed to cookies.\n\nI do love the neighborhood for the quaintness, that's for sure. Many of the shops have outside seating, and so you can plop down and watch the city go by. I had just finished a night of loud music and celebration with a big group of work family, so I wandered in, got my cookies, and went up the street to sit. \n\nI sat there and thought about all that I had been inspired to do that week. All the time I had spent with incredibly passionate people. I sat quietly, nibbling on my selections, and thought about where I was a year ago, 6 months ago; I thought about where I wanted to be. I thought about all that I could control and all that I could not, but that I hoped dearly for. People walked by--a family looking for dessert, two teens out on the town--I watched it all unfold. I sat out front of my favorite chocolatier (truffle-atier?) and I thought about the next time I might be in the same place. Would it be in a year? That seems too far away. Would it be sooner? How would that happen? I thought about all these things, feeling in my heart what I want. I looked down at an empty bag that had held my cookies. I wanted another cookie, too.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Waaay too much cream to ladyfinger ratio (this is coming from someone who likes whipped cream a lot) and it desperately lacked the bold rum and coffee flavors since the lady fingers weren't really soaked much.

I usually rely on yelp Pictures to decide what's tasty, but the pictures of this plain, square looking thing was also not very convincing. But, thanks to fellow Yelpers, I googled it. \n\nSF Weekly had an amazing write-up on it: \"when you enter the narrow slot of a store, there are so many other pastries with more obvious sex appeal: the chocolate fondant, black-and-white, chocolate hazelnut, and chocolate truffle slice, raspberry mousse and mixed berry tart, the cream horn and cream puff, \u00e9clairs and napoleons, even tiramisu and cannoli. You can be forgiven for ignoring the rather colorless squares of sacripantina, thin layers of beige cake topped with a couple of inches of white spongy-looking stuff dusted with fine crumbs.\n\nBut that would be a mistake. The sacripantina -- which Stella calls \"our prize-winning dessert, house specialty, and claim to fame\" -- works the flavors of zabaglione (a custard Stella makes with egg yolks, sweet butter, marsala, and sherry) into an airy, almost souffl\u00e9-like texture.\"\n\nIt was indeed airy and delicious. The hubby loved it too!  \n\nIncidentally, Zabaglione is featured in a Good Eats episode called \"Proof is in the Pudding\" so it was great to get to try a dessert with it!\n\nThanks Yelp & SF Weekly!!", "author": "Kathryn C."}

They're flavored with tasty Italian liquers and are made of true dairy fresh creams & fresh pastry and sugar is there to ACCENT the taste of the desserts, not to take over the taste.

They had two types: one filled with custard and one filled with whip.\n\nI opted for the custard. At $5.75 a pop I was expecting a little more heaven in my mouth but this was perhaps the saddest  eclair I've ever had in my life. It tasted stale! The shell of the pastry was hard, dry, and had a stale flavor to it as if they had recycled the batches from the night before. The custard was not silky or smooth, it was almost airy and frothy with no flavor.\n\nI understand commercial rent in SF is expensive but charging patrons nearly $6 for a lackluster pastry is crazy!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "I'm not necessarily much of pastry guy and definitely not much of a cake guy, but BOY OH BOY does Stella Pastry & Cafe make me want nothing but more cake and pastries!!!\n\nFirst things first I'm the realest and I just gotta say that their tiramisu is off the chain! To me, it's the pinnacle of centuries of human research into the fine arts of tiramisu baking. For those art history majors out there, you know full well of the Great Tiramisu Pilgrimage of the early 1800s. If you don't, that's because I just made that garbage fake news up on the spot, but if it wasn't fake news, I would tell you all about how the pilgrims found a treasure box deep within an abyss in the earth that contained this magically preserved espresso and rum soaked masterpiece of a cake that blew their feeble minds and started the Great Tiramisu Wars of the mid 1800s of something like that. But real talk... before you excuse me off as a delirious whacko who needs a beautiful and pure angel to keep his wandering mind in check or whatever, just know that this tiramisu is truly something out of this world. The most noticeable characteristic of the tiramisu cake is that it is extremely moist. As such, it has a unique texture to it unlike most other cakes that have layers of drier spongey-ness. It is also vibrant in flavors with a chocolately layer of powder on top and layers of sweet cream. The espresso and rum are very prominent flavors in the cake that make it so good. Last but not least, I must say that it is also extremely visually appealing. It really is something you just have to try as words fail me in trying to explain it.\n\nBut enough raving about their tiramisu, Stella Pastry & Cafe has a ton of other delicious delicacies as well. Their Sacripantina cake is a famous item here that I remember enjoying a lot as well though I can't say much about it since it's been a long time since I've tried it. Their cannolis are another popular item as well that are a must get. However, there is one pastry item here that I do find super good at the tiramisu cake level.\n\nTheir almond cookies are to die for! I have no idea how they manage to make such a delicious almond cookie. Like the tiramisu, it is surprisingly moist in a good way. The cookie has a very strong almond flavor and is also very sweet. It has an interestingly sticky and chewy texture to it though the cookie looks hard and has a crisp outer layer. It contains the both of best worlds when it comes to crisp and chewy cookies. I personally find it to be a must try especially for those who like almond pastries. They also have a similar cookie with what I believe to be pine nuts on top which has the same texture so that's always another option for those who don't necessarily prefer the taste of almond desserts.\n\nGo check out Stella Pastry & Cafe in the North Beach/Little Italy area of the city! Sit down with some pastries and a nice cup of coffee with some company, buy a box to go to share with others (or to unshamelessly self-indulge), and/or buy a full cake for a celebration nobody will want to miss out on! :)", "author": "Joshua M."}

They also used to make panna cotta with a raspberry on top! Now--nowhere to be found! I can't find it anywhere else and some other establishments are calling fake Asian almond jello a \"panna cotta.\" (What blasphemy! Shame on these other establishments whose name I will not reveal.)

The sacripantina, which I couldn't stop raving about (my favorite dessert here) had that same excellent flavor I've come to love from the zabaglione cream and marsala enhanced sponge cake. Lastly, the cannoli was probably one of the best cannolis I've tried so far. The shell had just the right amount of crunch and the cream was not too sweet.

Sometimes I can resist stopping by. Most of the time I cannot. This cozy little bakery has been around for over 70 years and it's not hard to see why they've been successful. Despite its small size, the bakery offers quite a selection of pastries, cookies, and cakes. There are just a couple of small tables, so it is mostly a takeout spot.\n\nCannoli:\ncrispy, crunchy cannoli shell heavily dusted with powdered sugar, generously filled with sweet ricotta cream, laced with chocolate chips. I am craving one of Stella's cannoli just thinking about them. It is satiating in taste, crunchiness, and creaminess.\n\nTiramisu - sponge layers soaked in espresso & rum, w/ layers of mascarpone:\nDelicious layers of sponge, espresso, and mascarpone, covered in cocoa powder. It is satisfyingly sweet and creamy, but with the flavor of coffee, tiramisu is not too sweet.\n\nSacripantina Cake Slice - vanilla sponge, zabaione cream, rum:\nTheir house specialty cake is very light in texture. The vanilla sponge is very airy. It is rather heavy on the sweetness though. With custard filling and rum, the level of sweetness is no surprise. Altogether, the cake reminds me of an Italian tres leches cake.\n\nRaspberry Cake Slice - chocolate sponge cake w/ raspberry mousse filling:\nI decided to try something different. Though the raspberry cake was not bad, it was too sweet for my liking. I found the raspberry filling too cloyingly sweet.\n\nI will continue to be a fan of the cannoli. I'm like a giddy child whenever I walk away with a white box stamped with their logo and carefully tied with twine.", "author": "Joy W."}

The line was quite long when we arrived. Service was a bit slow and there wasn't an organized line in place, so there is an honor system for who arrived first. \n\nDuring this visit, we ordered the tiramisu, cheesecake, and macaron. I thought the macaron was a bit stale, though flavorful. The cheesecake was good, but nothing to write home about. The tiramisu was my least favorite (sadly) though it is usually my favorite type of cake! The layers were soggy from too much alcohol soaking the cake, though this shows the tiramisu is prepared in the traditional method! For $12.50, the price is decent as portion sizes were pretty good. Staff was very friendly. Parking is very difficult so definitely walk or take public transport here! Not bad, but didn't stand out for me.", "author": "Kristi T."}

You can see hearts in my eyes as I ran back to nibble on several other small heavenly bites of buttery cookies.\n\nThe week after my first encounter with their cookies, I walked back up Broadway onto Columbus Street to pick up another 2 boxes of mixed cookies for several Xmas dinners I was to attend.

The second he said that I told him we were going to walk up a couple blocks to Stella. Since moving to San Francisco, this has been my go-to Italian bakeshop. Their cookies and biscotti are great. However, there are a few stand-outs. First, their sacripantina cake is fantastic ($5.40 per slice). It's a fluffy sponge cake with zabaione, rum, and cream. Their strawberry cream cake ($5.40 per slice) is also light and refreshing for a dessert (how often can you say that about buttery cakes?!). Finally, I also love their sfogliatella, a Southern Italian specialty. It reminds me of the first time I had this in Campania... basically, one of those life-affirming moments only felt through food.

This year we did just that, and just before he had to jet, we were joined by a great friend who missed the dumpling experience. So he left, and I took her back to the dim sum shops, and afterwards we realized we had time to kill so we set off to find a coffee shop where we could catch up. And of course we used the Yelp app!\n\nAs we wandered the streets of SF making our way towards our final destination, things started to look familiar. I noticed the beautiful buildings, inviting storefronts, and of course the tell tale Italian flags on the light posts. We were in North Beach aka Little Italy, and I couldn't have picked a more perfect place to catch up with a good friend and wind down a long and exciting week.\n\nStella is a quintessential Italian cafe and bakery plopped down in this wonderful neighborhood. You can smell the pastries from the street, and as you walk in your eyes are drawn to the long case that runs the length of the shop, filled with every cake, cookie, and Italian pastry known! \n\nWe ordered two cappuccinos and a raspberry pastry ring to go with it. The cappuccino was perfect, with a big fluffy cloud of milk perched on top of the rich dark and roasted espresso, and the pastry ring was a wonderful compliment, light, sweet, flaky and delicious.\n\nBut while the coffee and pastry were delicious, the best part of the Stella experience had to be the seating. The cafes that line the street all have cute two top tables outside so you can watch the world go by while enjoying your coffee. Stella is no different. When we arrived both of theirs were taken, but as luck would have it, just as we'd placed our things down at the table inside, one outside became available. \n\nWe snatched it up and chatted about our experiences that week, future plans, and life in general. It was perfect, albeit brief. \n\nHonestly North Beach and Stella won my heart that day.

So this place was recommended to us by my boyfriends cousin who lives in San Fran. We were checking out China town and it was just around the corner in what looked like an.. Italian town of proper actually call it that. Basically, there were a lot of Italian restaurants and little cafes. \n\nSo I went for one dessert. The signature cake and left with that... and strawberry shortcake... and blueberry cheesecake. I think we all were obsessed with the cheesecake, it was the first thing gone. The signature cake was delicious but just a little plain for me. I like fruity. I added some extra strawberries and became obsessed with the combination. And strawberry shortcake... I mean, it's my go to dessert. Couldn't go wrong ordering that there. It's more of a cake than a biscuit. I love both varieties but often see both variations. The prices I can't remember honestly but I remember thinking it was reasonable. I believe all 3 desserts which were good size pieces and a double soy cappuccino was around $20.", "author": "Brittany N."}

It was layers of yellow cake (no joke) and whip cream and a little bit of espresso or coffee  drizzled on the top layer before being powdered with cocoa (?) I can only guess that there was some coffee or espresso in since that's what it should have, but I didn't taste any coffee or espresso. I also thought that cream is normally made from marscapone- is it not? This tasted like whipped cream.\n\nI also ordered a cappuccino- will not do that again. Why is it so hard to find a proper cappuccino in Little Italy? I should have ordered a macchiato if I wanted a real cappuccino, but that's not even on the menu.\n\nIf you want REAL Italian desserts and espresso- go to Cavalli  Cafe.

All of those wonderful Cannolis,  sweet cheesecakes, and Tiramisu. The flavors bursting with rich ricotta and marscapone  cheese.\n\nWell sometimes memories are better than the current reality. Stella is not what it used to be. Yeah the pastries are good but after tasting places like Mike's In Boston ( with their amazing and varied flavors of Cannolis) Stella just doesn't carry the fond memories.\n\nIf your in the neighborhood def stop by for a sweet...but know there are better places out there.", "author": "David G."}

Stella's cannolis are absolutely incredible and worth every bite.  I stopped in for a pastry assortment on my way to dinner at The Italian Homemade Company and picked up a few things: two cannolis, an eclair, a slice of the Sacripantina Cake, and a slice of Tiramisu.  Of all the things I got, the cannolis were definitely my favorite.  The Sacripantina Cake was good, but if I were to come back, I think I'd focus my efforts on just the cannolis.

A quick yelp search brought up Stellas as the top dessert shop within the immediate vicinity. \n\nThe two most noted items in the reviews were the tiramisu and the sacripantina, so we ordered both along with a round of coffees. None of us were very impressed with either of these desserts. The cake portions were dry, the cream was forgettable and the toppings were average. I would not order either of these again. At least the coffee was good. \n\nOverall I was disappointed with Stellas and it's not likely that this place gets a return visit from me.", "author": "Mark O."}

It is a really small unassuming place, whatever that means. I mean can place be assuming?\n\nCame here on a Saturday, and granted, it was close to closing time, but I still expect professional service and people that smile (no, it wasn't 15 minutes before closing).\n\nWe tried the Sacripantina an the Fedora. We had slices of each. I was a little surprised how much the total was (on the high side). Both were good, but i wasn't blown away or anything. The Sacripantina is good enough to be a wedding cake, but it was still missing something. Now I don't know much about Sacripantinas in general, but it would have used some toasted almond bits or something similar. It just felt like it lacked SOMETHING. l wonder is this is like asking for a slice of NY pizza to be cut smaller. Is that a faux pas or something? I don't know.\n\nThe fedora was definitely lacking something. I think it needs some liqueur. Just to take it to another level.\n\nI'm not saying that either were not good, they were. 4 stars for the food here is saying something from me. I just think they are close to being 5 star good. \n\nAs for the service, maybe I caught them on an off night. We'll see, as I will be back for sure to try out more pastries.", "author": "Benny N."}

The others with me choose an eclair - average and a large thin, chewy, almond cookie thing.  Also very good, considering how thin, but still chewy it was.  If you're looking for a lighter choice, I would go with the thin chewy almond cookie.\n\nOnly complaint is that nothing is labeled in the glass case and it's confusing.

OMG, I got their short bread, butter cookie and their famous sacripantina; all of them were divine. I think they really bake all these fresh at least on a bi-daily basis. You can taste the amount of butter than is inside their short bread and their butter cookies; too good to be true. If you're not afraid of gaining weight, be sure to bring a dozen or two to go. \n\nSacripantina is pound cake stuffed with some creme. It's so light, so airy, so delicious. Be careful when you pair this slice of cake with a cup of coffee; the sponge cake will absorb and swell up in your tummy and make you full for hours. \n\nCoffee... well... if you can find other coffee shops you should.

It's unchallenged rule over the top of my bakery world is now in danger of being usurped by this God-mama of Italian bakeries. \n\nThe goodies here are as good as the reviewers crowed about. It's a shame that it took me 8 years of living here before I finally made it here. I was just done having a sublime pizza margherita lunch at the inimitable Tony's just down the block, and was seriously full, bursting at the seams, and out of my daily calorific budget!\n\nI had to make room for a panna cotta there but wasn't content on stopping there. So the only way out was to get a few to go --- their signature Sacripantina, the Diplomatiico, the Cannoli, and the Eclair.\n\nThe panna cotta was smooth, creamy, lightly sweet, and was a delight to my taste buds. It was topped with a raspberry and a couple of blackberries. Slightly crushing them added a little bit of sweet and tangy hint to the spoonful of creamy goodness!\n\nThe cannoli held very well in the fridge overnight. The next day the biscuit tube was still flaky and crunchy. The creamy ricotta filling with the tiny chocolate chips were a delight to sink my teeth into! It was sweet but not treacly, and the presence of the chocolate chips lent itself to the texture of the filling as a whole; just the way I like it!\n\nThe sacripantina was a taste to behold! The soft porous sponge cake was delightfully moist (it's rum!), and the dreamy layers of custard and cream were like magic in my mouth!\n\nThe Eclair comes two ways --- with a custard filling, or a cream filling, of which I decided on the latter. The pastry was decently soft in spite of spending a night in the cold and dry innards of my fridge. This leads me to believe it must have been moist and soft when fresh. The chocolate frosting on it was a little heavy on the sugar, but that's to be expected of any frosting that needs to stick to the pastry and not wander off onto the plate.\n\nFinally, the Diplomatico seemed to be their emissary to the French mission, Italy's answer to the mille-feuille (a.k.a. the \"Napoleon\"). A pastry with alternating layers of custard, cake, and puff pastry topped with a fondant layer and a dusting of sugar like the first fall of snow. As expected, digging in to a pastry of this kind is an exercise in patience and skills lest you be left picking on coated puff pastries with all the creamy layers squeezed out to the sides not unlike a tube of toothpaste riddled with a million holes! And oh yea, lest I forget, it tasted mighty good!\n\nStella is a must visit if you have a sweet tooth!", "author": "Umesh T."}

There cream was off. I'd prefer ramolos.  That's why I gave 2 stars but the reason I'm really writing this review is because I want to warn you all about something I caught. WARNING\n\nSo I ask the guy behind the counter for a cup of water. He probably figured I wasn't watching since it was pretty busy in there. I just happened to be watching his every move. So I see him grab a cup and pour what was left in the pitcher which wasn't enough to fill my cup so he grabs some random about half filled cup of water behind the counter and pours some of that into mine just to fill it up. GROSS! So he gives it to me and I already knew I wasn't going to drink it. I kept watching  him after that. 2 mins later I see him grabbing that cup he used on mine and was  drinking out of it.. DISGUSTING! He had poured some of his water into my cup! It's a good thing I was watching him. God knows where that mouth of his has been! Gag!

Unfortunately, I was not really impressed by their cannoli, but it could be because I'm not really a huge fan of chocolate chips, and their cannoli filling was mixed with chocolate chip chunks. Not my favorite, but it wasn't the worst. My boyfriend liked it, but I was more into their chocolate fedora cake. OMG. \n\nI was sold on the presentation alone because of the powdered sugar and the chocolate shaving garnishing. I'm pretty picky with my chocolate cake because I don't really like anything that's TOO sweet; this was perf. Not too sweet, yet at the same time, it was moist and soft with a good balance of chocolate shavings that literally just melted in my mouth. Definitely a gem in Little Italy. \n\nWould recommend this place solely for their cakes.

Now, I've never had cannoli in Italy, but my hunch is that Americanized cannoli are simply bigger and better (in my opinion, that is... I'm not a fan of candied fruits).  I've heard that authentic cannoli in Sicily are made with sheep's milk ricotta, so the filing is denser and tangier.\n\nAnyway, the shell here was sloppily made and the filling tasted old and stale.

I called in one day before to place an order for a Sacripantina cake for my friend's birthday. It was a serious struggle with the language barrier. They couldn't get my name, info, credit card number, or what I wanted written on the cake properly for longest time! Eventually, they had to hand over the phone to someone else..  We finally got that sorted after like 30-45 minutes. \n\nThe next day, I went to pick up my cake BUT they could not find my cake in the special order refrigerator. They couldn't even find my information which took 45 minutes of my life the day before. I had to re-write what I wanted on the cake for them.. Seriously, what was the point of calling ahead of time to pre-order a cake? After they realized they couldn't find my order or w/e, they just grabbed a cake out of the fridge in the back with all the other cakes. I'm sure those were not the most fresh or made the night before/that morning.. because it was already frozen. So God knows how many days old that cake was? I'm not dumb- I pre-ordered a cake for a reason! I asked them if it was fresh.. Was it made that morning/or even the night before.. etc. Then they said it was made like 1-2 days before and that's how they sell their cakes blah blah blah. \n\nSo they gave me a cake that was already made before I even placed the order?.. RIGHT... If I ever do come back, I'll just show up and save myself the hassle of calling in. I mean they'd give me the pre-made couple day old cakes they sell everyone else anyways. \n\nIt was a good cake but was it worth all that trouble? Absolutely not.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I will eat at several different restaurants, order all sorts of appetizers and shared entrees, then almost always go on an adventure for dessert. This occasion was no different. \n\nCookies and milk. That's what I wanted. And that's what I got. The cookies here are so soft and tender. So delicious. Sweet but not too sweet. They are small enough to have about 2-3 and feel satisfied. Price wise, I'd say they are on point. You won't find sky high prices here. Everything seems fair, especially the cookies. I'm not huge on cakes but I imagine those to be very delicious as well. They seem to have it all at Stella.\n\nInside the cafe, it is rather small but that is the appeal of this place. It's bistro style with tables that are large enough to fit your coffee and snack, and your friend's coffee and snack... not much more.

That's because I'm rushing inside to fill a box with the best tiramisu known to humankind.\n\nWe first found this place in 2001 in the middle of a day-long walk through San Francisco. I wanted tiramisu but was worried that walking around with it for hours would ruin it. They had some pieces in the cooler so they filled a box with these. I walked the street with my string-tied bakery box and when we got back to my brother's house the deliciousness inside was the perfect temperature and creaminess. And because it is a rummy tiramisu none of the little kids wanted it! Win-win!!!\n\nSince that fateful day, every time we find ourselves in San Francisco we try to get over to see our friend Stella.

The slice was $4.50 and the minimum card charge is $5 at Stella. With no cash in hand whatsoever, the nice folks behind the counter said we could pick up some baci di dama (lady's kisses), these cute itty bitty cookies - two dome shaped cookies sandwiched together with filling in the center. Priced at 25 cents each, we got one bacio with vanilla cookies and chocolate filling and another bacio with chocolate cookies and a vanilla filling. I thought it was all too convenient that these cookies were there to help you spend at least $5 to use your card but I couldn't deny how cute the plate was that the baci were served on. \n\nThe baci di dama were nice little bites of sweetness, almost like little sugar cookies.

I didn't care for the biscotti because it was a bit stale (I went late in the afternoon) but the macaroon was SO good. Next time, I'll come by and try their slices of cakes. :)\nWent on a Tuesday afternoon, no lines! There were tables for two along the side of the wall as well as outside, and I didn't see any outlets, so I guess I won't be coming here to work on stuff on my laptop. But great place to just eat dessert and drink coffee with a friend. Service was really nice and quick. I was surprised that the cookies, macaroons, and other little bite-sized desserts were sold by weight, so it's quite pricey for what you get haha, especially when the macaroons I got was on the bigger side.", "author": "Anna L."}

Take the cannoli.\" \n\nThat's what caporegime Clemenza told his underling Rocco in \"The Godfather\", which remains the Bible for how we all should approach life...if we all had Tommy guns! Stella Pastry is the kind of North Beach place that wouldn't look out of place in the scene where Michael was attempting to settle his disputes with the other Five Families by blowing their brains out. Wait, is that a horse head in my bed, or am I just glad to see you? \n\nStella doesn't offer the spacious seating of Caffe Greco across the street, but it does offer the Sacripantina Slice, their house specialty. It looks like a S'more, but it's more like an all-vanilla tiramisu with a light custard filling. Despite its genuinely sweet tastiness, I still prefer the plainer Pasticiotti, which looks like a mini-bundt cake. It's made of polenta and filled with raspberry jam and custard. All the other usual suspects are here, too - cannolis, cream puffs and horns, tiramisu, eclairs. All homemade, all delizioso.\n\nBut you should get them to go since there isn't much seating here. Besides, Sonny Corleone says there's \"no more meetin's, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. You give them a message from me. I want Sollozzo. If not, it's all out war...we go to the mattresses!\" It's an offer you can't refuse...(groan!) \n\nPASTRIES - 4 stars...delicious Italiano specialties...what's not to like, goombah? \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...compact North Beach place...get it to go and hang out at Washington Square Park \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...they serve 'dem for da family \nTOTAL - 4 stars...authentic stuff...and remember that Luca Brasi is sleepin' with the fishes (...go rent the movie!)", "author": "Ed U."}

I love their dessert entremes. Everyone says their sacripantina is their signature, and this thing is like sponge cake heaven. Light, airy, moist, sweet, but not overly sticky. This thing is great. The tiramisu has the same texture, but with some very rich hints of espresso and chocolate. The strawberry shortcake is also fantastic. It's creamy and moist, and I can't wait to have more. The black and white is decent, but it gets dry quickly. What really hit the spot though was the Napolean. I can see why people gravitate towards this kind of cake. It has the consistency of a soft cake at first, but the middle layer of harder pastry creates a great textural dichotomy. Service is really good too, but it will take you a little bit to get what you want because the secret is out, and this place is now packed.", "author": "Danny C."}

There are about 5 tables, but we were the only party there at one point. We tried the famous Sacripantina and Cannoli, but the Cannoli was the winner.

I pulled out my handy Yelp app to get a recommendation, and picked Stella.  I was really excited to try them based on the reviews.  \nI'm a person who \"likes to do what they're supposed to do in the place they're supposed to do it,\" meaning that I will always try a house specialty or let the employees guide me.  When it was my turn, I told the clerk that I didn't know what I wanted, and wanted a recommendation.  She was completely flummoxed.  She said something that made no sense, so again I asked for her to recommend something.  She then told me I had to make up my mind and tried to move on to the next person.  So then the people around me tried to help -- \"Tell her what's popular!\" -- and at that point I almost walked out.  Another customer told me to get the cannoli, and swore it was delicious, so I went with it. \nI was pretty disappointed.  The cannoli was $4.75, and it was totally forgettable.

If you just want to want have a slice of cake and some coffee you can't go wrong here. There are lots of choices and everything that we've tried tasted great. However, if you want to special order a cake, then read on.\n\nWe were looking for a place to order tiramisu for 60 people. We stepped into Stella, ordered a slice and decided on the spot that we had found what what we were looking for. The cake was creamy, but light, and had just enough rum to give it a extra little kick. We requested information about a special order. There was only one barista minding the store. He was responsible for making cappuccinos and serving cakes, so he didn't have much time to deal with us. He did provide us with a price list (see photo). After studying the prices, we concluded that the prices didn't make sense. A 1/4 sheet cake was $59.50, whereas a 1/2 sheet was $149.50. One would logically assume that a 1/2 sheet would be twice the size of a 1/4 sheet and would therefore cost twice as much. Therefore a 1/2 sheet should be $119.00 (2 x $59.50), not $149.50! There was an email address and a phone number at the bottom of the price list. We sent an email but got no response. We called the phone number and was connected to the barista at Victoria Pastry! What? I thought Victoria was a competitor?\n\nWe never got connected to anyone who could answer our questions (such as exact dimensions of the cakes). We won't fault the baristas. They were courteous and tried to answer our questions. But they were always very busy and did not have all the answers. So, with insufficient information and fingers crossed, we decided to order two 1/4 sheets because that seemed to be a better deal than a single 1/2 sheet. The cakes we got were delicious, so the only problem was the ordering process.", "author": "Roger F."}

North Beach tends to get windy and a little cold, so warm seats in the sun is a plus. \n\nI ordered the lemon petit four and the boyfriend chose the traditional cannoli with mochas. I love how Italian places don't hold back on the espresso or the caffeine. The mocha was bold and strong (like my man) and didn't go well with my little lemon cake at all. That's my own fault though and I take full responsibility for that. The mocha went well with the cannoli though and again, I was swept away by flaky pastry. \n\nIn addition the 6 pot espresso machine they house, they also sell cookies by the lbs. and a vast array of traditional Italian pastries. They all consist of the basic butter, sugar, flour and sprinkle combination that my lips love to nibble on. The ladies here are super friendly and see to be quite used to the tourists with their millions of questions and countless finger smudges. \n\nAll of the cakes look so tempting and delicious but with a consistent diet to try to get a handle on, it's going to have to wait.

It has some hints of lemon, which it's not very strong, but definitely noticeable. \n\nI also really like these almond cookies with pine nuts on top. I'm not sure what the proper name of these cookies are, but it's the only ones that have pine nuts on them. It's chewy, but the only thing I don't like about it is, they add way too much of almond extract. I'm not 100% sure if it's almond extract (some kind of extract), but it's really strong... to the point where it taste a little bitter. Overall it's still good.\n\nIf you visit SF or you live in SF and you haven't tried this bakery yet... you're missing out! I highly recommend the tiramisu and the pine nut cookies. Of course there are other baked goods. Whenever I visit SF, this is the place I look forward to all the time!", "author": "Carmen A."}

America picked its battles, and cake did not make the cut. \n\nIn the US cake is basically disposable stationary, used as a platform for messages. Sadly - it (your avg American cake) tastes like stationary as well.\n\nUnless flan is your idea of great desert you will not go to a country that managed to make breakfast lunch and dinner include rice, beans and made an art form out of what is basically flat bread.  Nor are you going to go to the country that makes more out of soy than should be conceivable,  and while mochi ice cream has its place, Japan - pretty much stopped trying after nailing it with Sushi.\n\nThat leaves Europe. No one does cake like the Europeans either German chocolate cake, Tiramisu (courtesy of Italy), or Napoeleon (coming at you from the land of frog legs and snails - as food), if its cake you're after - you have to find a small, independently owned, bakery in a neighborhood with a European heritage and that is exactly what Stella is. Stella kills it with the cakes - so far i managed to try the truffle cake, the cheese cake, the tiramisu - and they all have been 10s. I wont say that this place cant do no wrong, but even the most stale, end of the day at the display case, leftovers are better at Stella than anything you can possibly buy at Safeway.\n\n** In the service of objectivity i do have to call out a coffee fail on the last visit - i ordered an americano and got something that almost looked like not so strong black tea - if I can see thru my coffee - that is pretty much a coffee fail - since they were close to closing i was not compelled to ask for a redo, and i gave Stella the benefit of a doubt and assumed that it was a one of, next time though i might be more critical.", "author": "Oleg H."}

My parents told us that the cannolis were really good in North Beach so naturally after dinner, we had to swing by here.\n\nThis Italian bakery had SO many delicious looking desserts...they were all tempting. I decided that because they were known for their cannolis, I should order one. (Or as the old guy next to us kept on calling them, \"cannalonis\" - like the noodles. Teehee.)\n\nI generally think that cannolis are just OK but seriously, I don't think I had had a real one until I came here. Oh. Em. Gee. I had a chocolate chip one which was light and fluffy yet fluffy and creamy...with just enough crunch and just enough sweetness to the pastry. \n\nStella's is tiny...blink and you'll miss it. But it's worth actively seeking this place out the next time you're in the area.\n\nP.S. They are open until LATE! And they just keep making the cannolis. There were 6 left in the case when we arrived and a few minutes after we sat down, they sold out. They were working on making another batch...so never fear, if they are out, chances are they can make some more. \n\nDon't tell anyone but I'd pay $20 for one of these things.", "author": "Sarah M."}

We each asked the counterman what he would recommend and he pointed out a couple of items that are very popular so we settled on the strudel and a cinnamon raisin danish-type pastry and watered our pastries down with a cappuccino (for me) and a mocha (for man-friend).  The espresso was delish and both drinks totally hit the spot.\n\nWe felt the need to clean up our table when we left, as we noticed other patrons doing the same and the counter guy was very appreciative when we did so.  He was also very helpful with the other customers that came in while we were eating and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-18", "description": "As a fan of homemade Italian pastry, I stopped by Stella with Yelper Cassie J after she told me about their famous Sacripantina cake. This patented cake has become a household name in North Beach and is distinguishable by its unorthodox dome shape exterior embedded with multilayered vanilla sponge cake, custard, sweet butter, marsala, sherry wine, cream and rum. This bakery opens late, and has a rich history since 1942 in bringing San Francisco a variety of Italian cakes, Saint Honore, tiramisu, wedding cakes, \u00e9clairs, napoleons, danishes and tarts. \n\nIt was getting late at night with their large counter running low on pastries, but the small, well lit interior was still filled with people of all generations. There were a few tables scattered alongside the walls but the sidewalk seating was the most desirable as North Beach was wide awake with a robust night life and persistent foot traffic. Thanks to Cassie, I got a Cannoli ($3.95) that came with thick ricotta cheese and chocolate chips at both ends of a crispy shell. The taste was semi-sweet with good texture, but the hallow mid-section led me to prefer Mike's Pastry which offers a larger variety and taste. I also received a slice of Sacripantina Cake ($4.50) which reminded me of an airy tres leches cake without the full on moisture but a touch of citrus and rum. The cake was enjoyable but those interested should be aware of its smooth subtle finish without the dense sweet flavor that some might expect.\n\nService was a bit rushed and chaotic as they were bustling with a line of people eager for attention. 3.5 stars for the overall experience. Not yet a fan, but I'm definitely interested in returning to order their Sacripantina Cake along with other pastries such as the Saint Honore Cake, and enjoy an afternoon of relaxation and people watching.", "author": "Daniel L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-17", "description": "As much as I enjoy Stella's, I had a less than pleasing experience recently when I ordered  their Sacrapantina 10\" Cake for a family dinner the other day. \n\nCertain dessert cakes are better as individual slices rather than whole pies.  The single slice is served in a perfect square slice.  I've always enjoyed this cake for being light and fluffy with a great blend of rum flavor and sweet cream and custard.  \n\nBut my most recent experience here was just bad all around.  It started off in during the morning upon ordering my cake with the employee assisting me.\n\nNow folks might stamp be with being a judgemental racist, but this review is based on my sheer experience of just how difficult it was to place a simple order.  \n\nWhen it comes to cake with writing, plain and simply, I would like to have someone assist me who can speak and understand English clearly.  While I was being assited by a very nice lady, she definitely had difficulties understanding me when I was telling her what I would like on the cake.  It's not very efficient to have this particular lady taking cake orders when she doesn't even know how to pronounce certain words. \n\nPlain and simple.  On my cake I asked them to put \"To a Wealthy Healthy and Happy New Year\"  I can not begin to explain just HOW LONG it took me spell this out. \n\nMind you, you can just imagine how terribly anxious I was to see the cake upon picking it up to make sure that each and every word was spelt correctly.  I have no problems with folks where English is their second language, but given this particular circumstance of putting writing on a cake for an special occassion, it would've been nice to have someone assisting me who knew how to spell Wealthy and Heathy.  \n\nIt was just was just a big headache placing my order.  \n\nFurthermore, as I mentioned I love the Sacrapantina cake. But ordering it as a whole cake was just bad all around.  I dislike very much that their round pies are huge, dome-like, and very awkward.  It's not your typical flat round cakes. \n\nApparently they have some sort of patent on this dome shape, but from experience, cutting and serving is extremely difficult and very unpleasing to the eye.  The 10\" Dome cake is like 9 inches tall and for the average diner, cutting this at home, it's way too time consuming and messy to cut.  It's a dome shape afterall, starting wide on the bottom and getting skinnier at the top.  \n\nIn addition to the aesthetically unpleasing design of the cake structure, the \"whole\" cake as opposed to the single slice was not good.  Cake was way too soft, and not fluffy as it should've been, It broke apart too easy upon transfer to plates.  There was also a bit too much cream, not enough custard.  \n\nTo sum up, I would definitely suggest the Sacrapantina be eaten as a single slice rather than ordering this odd-shaped cake as a whole pie.  Furthermore, I would definitely ask to speak to someone who can understand English clearly when requesting special wording to be put on the cake.  \n\nStella, you disappointed me.  You are no longer one of my favorite  pastry shops in San Francisco.  Combine a headache with a bad whole pie Sacrapantina, and I'm not a happy camper.  Hopefully you can still satisfy me with your single slices and tarts that I love so much in the future.", "author": "Cass J."}

They serve your pastry on a plate and the espresso in a cute little cup with a cute little plate.  I took everything else home to share and everything tasted so good! I have to say, the napoleon was my favorite, yummy flaky pastry that just melts in your mouth. \nThe staff was very friendly and upbeat. They also have little cookies in another case.

But I'd unfortunately be lying because there are many, many words to describe my favorite bakery in the (Italian) world! I could even (honestly) use the word divine.\n\nI'm not a fan of chocolate-y things. In all eating scenarios, I'll opt for vanilla, or fruity, or savory, or any other flavor before chocolate. I just don't dig chocolate. But my fiancee loves all things chocolate, and since we'd  spent an entire day shopping before ending up here, I had to humor him by getting the chocolate truffle slice over say, the pear tart. \n\nIt was the most amazing 'chocolate cake' I've ever eaten. The sweetness of the truffle filling & fondant icing was offest by the lightness of the chocolate sponge cake, making it at once rich & light. \n\nThe ovali though, is by far my favorite pastry. Though it's just a puff pastry filled with custard and raspberry filling, it is indescribably amazing. I've tried it w/ 3 other friends, and we were all unable to fathom what made it so incredibly light & yummy. I don't know, maybe it's just better not to know...\n\nEverything is delicious, (the cookies, the biscotti, the petit fours, etc) but what really sells me is the coffee. Most bakeries overlook coffee & keep a pot sitting on the burner for hours at a time, but Stella Bakery always manages to brew a cup of black coffee that gives me a euphoric rush. You can literally feel the tingly caffeinated jolt course all the way through your body. I esp. like drinking it after a delicious and not-so-healthy dinner in Chinatown to...yknow, speed up my metabolism. :( Get things digesting.\n\nBottom Line: I would run a marathon for a slice of cake here.", "author": "Tianyi S."}

What am I going to buy here?\nWhenever any local or tourist asks me where to find the best Tiramisu, Stella is always the first word from my mouth.  For fear of becoming the Stay Puff monster (Ghostbusters), I normally pick up one slice to satisfy that craving.  The cake is clearly layered in five layers comprising of cake, cream, cake, cream, and cocoa powder.  As I take my first bite, my mouth fully awakens to the variety of sensations... first, the hearty flavor from the rum-soaked cake, then the richness from the cream, then a repeat of the rum, and finally the distinct bittersweet cocoa flavor.  How can so many sensations be packed in a slice of cake.  Utterly ridiculous.  I picked up a few other items, pecan tart -  heaping mound of gooey pecans stacked on a thin tart (a bit dry) and double chocolate cookies - 1/2 buttery good, 1/2 chocolate coated and rich.

After we finished a delicious dinner at King of Thai (always a good choice), she revealed to us that she had a huge craving for not just something sweet, but for something that involved chocolate and raspberries. \n\nNow, as someone who doesn't usually frequent dessert/pastry places (a. poor grad student and b. I'm usually a frozen yogurt/gelato kind of gal). So I looked at the bf like a deer in headlights with zero idea of where to find a chocolate and raspberry dessert. Not to fear though, the bf came to the rescue. He recommended Stella Pastry & Cafe, a place he had tried a long time ago when his parents were in town. The funny thing is, I pass this place almost daily, and it's always packed, which I've always taken to mean a good thing. I guess whenever I walk by there, I'm just never in dessert mode...no way that can be true.\n\nMoving on, I finally tried Stella's deliciousness last night. We walked in to find a short line of customer's patiently waiting. While we waited, we perused the counter of goodies to find what? Almost every kind of dessert under the sun INCLUDING a chocolate raspberry mousse cake. Boy was my friend ecstatic. I ordered a piece of the Tiramisu, the bf ordered two coconut macaroons (one chocolate covered) and a latte and our other friend ordered a hot chocolate. We ordered all our goodies to go, which they then put in cute little boxes with plastic forks (sorry earth). Based on the moans and happy expressions on everyone's faces, Stella did not disappoint in the least. My tiramisu was just incredible, the perfect combination of espresso soaked lady fingers and sweet mascarpone. MM!

Whereas at the more popular, tourist-y cafes, like Steps of Rome or Caffe Greco, you pay about $4 for a latte, at Stella, it's somewhere around $2.50, slightly cheaper than the going rate. And the espresso is, of course, Italian, and served in real mugs which is important, since drinking coffee from a paper cup is like drinking wine from a box. (Not that I'm knocking Franzia, America's favorite wine). \n\nOf course, you can't go to Stella without getting a pastry. The cannolis here are great. At the other North Beach cafes, they're not only overpriced, but they sit out in the display case all day and are therefore dry and slightly stale by the time you stop in after dinner. At Stella, the cannolis are always fresh. Sometimes, you can even see them filling the shells in the back--even at night. Definitely worth taking over the gun.", "author": "Susan S."}

I can't tell you how many birthdays I've spent eating tiramisu from my favorite place to get it in Jakarta, the Four Seasons.

Stella's is just the right amount of flaky & buttery, and the chocolate is better spread throughout the middle than some other places I've been to (like Bouchon Bakery in Yountville). This is where I've gone to get my chocolate croissant fix in the city the last few times I craved a chocolate croissant.]\n   * CHOCOLATE FONDANT CAKE\n       - [4/5 - Incredibly delicious.

Plus, as a major sweet-tooth, I was craving for some good bakery food. I'm so lucky to be living near all these Italian bakeries. I can't believe I didn't think about searching up Italian bakeries sooner. So, this is my first Italian bakery in North Beach.\n\nChocolate chip cookie - I was craving a cookie badly, so I had to get it. I usually like my cookies softer. This one was crispier. Nonetheless, it still tasted good. It was also pretty big. It's not the best, but it's above average. It was a good amount of sweetness.\n\nMocha - This was delicious! I usually like my mocha iced, but this one, I'll excuse. It wasn't too sweet. This is one of the better mochas I've had. I definitely recommend\n\nSacripantina - So delicious! I was afraid that it was going to be too hyped up when I tried it. But it was just as other people said. It has a delicious light texture to it, with a hint of citrus. Great balance of flavor and texture.\n\nChocolate truffle cake - DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE CHOCOLATE? This cake is death. As in, you'll die from how good it is. The rich chocolate-y cake is just sinful. It does get sweet, so warning: not for the faint of heart!\n\nChocolate chip cannoli - Wow! The creamy part is very fresh and delicious. I don't usually like cannoli's, but this one is pretty bomb. \n\nOverall, the bakery is excellent! One of the better ones I've been to, if not the best. The cake slices are pretty big, so they are worth the price in terms of quality and quantity. I forgot how much each cost, but I spent around $15 total.\n\nI'm glad I found out about this bakery because I will be going there often to fulfill my sweet cravings. The only negative thing about this bakery is that it's so close to where I live, I know I'm going to either gain a lot of weight or get diabetes... or both.

Stella's is a very traditional neighborhood Italian bakery in the heart of North Beach. They have a great selection of pastries, cookies and cakes, along with a full coffee bar menu.

Both were excellent and when eaten together they were amazing. We both ordered regular coffees which was perfectly brewed and delicious. It was great breakfast. A couple nights later, after a trip to Tony's Pizza for dinner, we decided to go to Stella's for dessert. This time was somewhat disappointing. We ordered a custard filled \u00e9clair to split and were not real happy with it.

The two layers of dark chocolate cake were moist, but the middle layer of yellow cake was dry despite being sandwiched in between layers of white cream.  The whole thing is topped off by a rich dark chocolate ganache.  To me it's an odd combination of flavors and textures.  Believe it or not I wish this dessert was sweeter than it already is.\n\nI have tried several other pastries that I don't remember as well in detail, but I have not tried although I intend to try the house special Sacripantina, the Chocolate Fedora and the Tiramisu.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

For over a year, I've walked past Cafe Trieste (which doesn't have soy milk, so screw 'em) to get my fix from Stella, but I don't think I'm going to bother anymore. Unfortunately, in the last couple of weeks, something has happened to their coffee. Normally, they brew a decent cup, but lately, my coffee has tasted more like hot water than anything else. To top it off, they've been filling my cup only 2/3 full. I really wouldn't normally quibble about something like that, but it's happened several times now, and it really is kind of bad. I hate to be the person who has to ask for more coffee, but I also order a size large because I want the full 16 oz. of coffee!\n\nAnyway, since I'm vegan, I've never had any of Stella's pastries, and I'm sure they're great, but if Stella is your coffee destination, you might want to try something else.", "author": "Jordan P."}

It's Intellectual Property.\n\nA few years back while researching for a consulting project I discovered that Washington Mutual had been awarded a patent for the layout and design of its customer friendly branches, which was an accomplishment for a bank. It's a separate story altogether that Wamu shortly went belly up, losing its identity to a bank that's focused on Chasing what matters, and making big bucks - no identity confusion there ;)\n\nThat Sacripantina (loosely translating as \"Holy Smoke\" in Italian) is copyrighted by Stella Pastry & Cafe was a similar surprise to me. But, in Stella's case it is the focus on what it knows well that has allowed the bakery to retain its draw in the wake of the cupcake and fro-yo frenzy that has gripped the country. It was also smart business strategy to create a barrier to imitation against their best selling product by copyrighting it. It wouldn't have taken people long to figure out that Sacripantina is a close cousin to the Tiramisu, another dessert Stella does quite well (excessive dusting of cocoa powder apart).  Deconstructing the multilayered smoke screen that is the Sacripantina would reveal a cake made with vanilla sponge, zabaglione cream (egg yolks, butter, marsala and sherry wine), and rum. But, despite its creaminess it is the deceptive lightness and fluffy texture that charm the eater and that have made it a San Francisco tradition for decades! \n\nThe other (chilled) desserts do better when they come to terms with the world around them (or room temperature). I know many yelpers who struggle to define dessert beyond chocolate. Stella offers many fine temptations to these people, depending on how they see and feed off the world. Should they prefer nuttiness - the chocolate hazelnut truffle cake can provide the depth they are looking for. Alternatively, were they to see the world in absolutes, then the Black and White cake with its layers of chocolate and vanilla cake filled with whipped cream and topped with fudge topping would serve as the consummate selection. Finally, drama seekers can hedonistically indulge in the Fedora, which has death by chocolate as its last act with its many layers of chocolate cake, chocolate butter cream, and dark chocolate flakes. \n\nHowever, the pre-filled cannoli did not impress me to the extent the left coast reviewers sang their praise - for on the spectrum of sweetness these cannoli were well and truly to the right of those found on the east coast. Mercifully, the smaller size keeps overindulgence in check. \n\nWith the multiple temptations described above, and others (left unexplored) featuring cookies and tarts, the only description missing from a text message review of Stella would be the 'R' rating: Stella is Stella(r).

The layer of rich mousse inbetween was just the best. Not to mention, the lovely coating of chopped hazelnuts on top. Mmmm. It was like the cake version of those Ferrero Rocher candies. Yummy! The little cookies were cute, and tasty. Can't complain! The cannoli was Ok. It wasn't \"bad\" per say, it just wasn't what I wanted or was expecting. The pastry shell part tasted a little too greasy, and the filling didn't have enough ricotta. Just my opinion anyway. But like I said earlier, my expectations are high.\n\n\nWell, it hasn't stopped me from going back there! I popped in last night with my boyfriend in tow, and we bought a Napolean (for him, I haven't tried it yet but it sure looked delicious) and I got one of the square Ovali's. Not bad! I'd already eaten a strawberry cream puff from Beard Papa's, and two chocolate covered strawberries before that, so I think I was a bit sugar'd out. I saved half of it to enjoy tonight. :)\n\nAll of their cakes look sooo delicious, I think they may be my favorite items in their shop. I also really want to try the cream horn, and the tiramisu.

There is only one person working in the whole store, I quickly conclude this is why there is a line.  I am observing while the group ahead of me orders several pastries and to my surprise, the counter girl takes each selection out of the case, then puts them all on the bare counter before she boxed them up?!  I thought that was weird because although each pastry has a small piece of wax paper underneath, the counter really didn't look very clean.  She settles up with them and then asks me what I want.  I decided to try the cannoli (this is the first time that I've ever had cannoli), I quickly tell the girl to hand it to me in a piece of wax paper 'to-go' (to avoid cannoli on counter), then I pay and leave.\n\nMaybe I'm just an idiot, or maybe there was something wrong with the cannoli, but it was not very tasty.  The filling was super dense (I was expecting it to be light), the chocolate chips were tasteless, and the crust had the texture of what I imagine crumbling drywall would feel like in my mouth.  After a few bites, I decided it was not worth my while and passed it off to S.B.\n\nIf the reviews are right, and this cannoli is the best - even in comparison to cannoli in NY, then the only conclusion I can have at this point is that I don't like cannoli.  Too bad...\n\nIn addition to yucky cannoli, the pastries on the dirty counter clinched it, I probably won't be back.", "author": "Burrito M."}

Nothing wrong with that, as my folks use their labor of love for cakes and pastries as does Stella's, but you should know-- the mexican wedding cookies, pistachio leaves, lemon men, checkerboard, thumbprint cookies, chocolate dipped butter cookies, etc-- all made elsewhere!

It may very well have been the best canoli I have ever had, and being Italian I've had a lot of canoli in my day. If you like canolis at all, you owe it to yourself to go into Stellas and get one. \n\nNext was the sacripantina, it was so light and airy it melted in your mouth. It was nice and sweet with a hint of rum flavor. It is topped with bread crumbs, but I didn't think that it added or took anything away from the dessert. \n\nLast but certainly not least (and definitely not the last thing I'll be having from this wonderful bakery) was the tiramisu. Let me first say that I love tiramisu, it is by far my favorite dessert ever. This tiramisu was deliciously light, airy, sweet and had just the right amount of cocoa on top. One slight negative is that they use sponge cake instead of lady fingers, but the tiramisu still rocked. It wasn't the best tiramisu that I have ever had, but it does rank toward the top of the list. \n\nIf you are in the north beach area and have never been to Stella's you should make it a point to visit. It is also open late, making it the perfect place to go for dessert after that great Italian diner you had at any of the restaurants just down the street.

I went expecting a lot from the review and got very little satisfaction. \nMy main reason for visiting this bakery is because I was introduced to the best cannoli in Boston and expected something resembling that.  What I got was a bakery with only one flavor cannoli and it was not good.  But, the main reason I gave it such a low rating is due to the mice both my wife and I saw while we walked through the kitchen to use the bathroom.  Not only did I have to calm my wife down but I had to maneuver my way around the mouse traps.  As if that was not enough, I noticed pastries sitting uncovered on top of the kitchen counter unattended.\n\nNow, I started my review with unfortunately,  the reason for that is because the workers there were very nice and helpful.

But regardless of how good their desserts are, having the server's dirty THUMB dug in your sacrapentina and cannoli will make your appetite go away.  Please note that the servers handle cash, clean counters and serve you your pastries without gloves.  I gave the server the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just a 1time exposure.  But it happened 3 more times.  The cream on my cannoli and sacrapentina had an indention from the server's thumb as they were grabbing it from the shelf.  When I called to speak to the manager Yasmin, she told me they dont use gloves because the pastries have paper on the bottom for serving and stated the servers used hand sanitizers in between cash handling and serving.  I told her that I have never seen any of the servers assisting me use hand sanitizers ever.  Next time you go there...you be the judge, monitor the servers and see if they actually use hand sanitizers.  This is the typical routine:  The person in line ahead of you pays for their desserts, hands the server cash and coins to pay using their BARE hands, puts it in the cash register.  Then takes your order, without washing hands or using hand sanitizer grabs your cookies/pastries/cakes, with their BARE hands and fingers touching the edges of your desserts.  So now the bacteria/dirt from the dirty cash/coins now contaminated your dessert.  According to FDA- The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) food workers must avoid microbes transmission to ready to eat food by hand washing or using gloves.

I went to Stella en route to Washington Square Park last weekend -- it was really nice out and I had a crossword to puzzle. Also, I live about 2 blocks away, which already had me rooting for it over Tartine as a pastry destination. And my uncle had recommended it as a place with \"great cappuccinos.\" I trust him because he's lived in SF for, like, 4 decades and also because he gave me a bunch of money for college when my parents wouldn't.\nAnyway, we walked in and I was thrilled by the airy but old-fashioned cuteness of the interior, noting it as a future newspaper reading spot before we inspected the baked goods cabinet. I was interested in these turnover-looking things and asked the counter girl what was in them. She didn't know but the other lady said \"cherry and apricot and custard\". This was sort of confusing, as three ingredients had been listed for two turnovers, but I hoped to God that my two favorite fillings -- apricot and custard -- might be united in one exalted pastry. I also ordered a cappuccino, although, since the barista was really young (like 18), I was apprehensive about her skills. Dealing a welcome blow to my confidence in stereotyping, she whipped up a veeery foamy and hot espresso drink that I drank quickly, to my own dismay: \"Where did it go?\" I sadly asked Max. \n\"Your mouth.\" \nDon't worry, concerned reader! I recovered when I bit into pastry to find that it was the holiest of breakfast grails: a not-too-buttery, apricot-and-vanilla-custard-filled turnover thing. Sweet Jesus. \nIt made me full but not the kind of full that Tartine's (don't get me wrong -- extremely tasty) pastries do: those leave me feeling like I've got a butter bomb in my suddenly rebellious gut, prohibiting me from thinking about another meal until about 8 hours afterwards. Which, as you yelpers know, is a sad sad state to be in on a weekend day which I would otherwise spend snacking on and/or dreaming about food. \nNext time, I'm going to try that sacripatina thing.", "author": "Aimee F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "How funny!  The last person to review Stella is also from San Diego.  (Hi, Anri T.!)  I learned about Stella Pastry & Cafe from native San Franciscan, Don of Mr. Toad's Tours.  Don started a 3-hour tour in a 1924 Yellowstone touring car/bus by driving through North Beach.  He was so kind in pointing out his favorite spots and the next day, I retained more FOOD facts from the tour than anything else.  Yes, I'm woman enough to admit that.  One thing that stuck in my foodie brain as the fabulous, antique vehicle whizzed through the city was \"sacripantina\".  Whaaaa? I had heard that word before.  I couldn't remember when or where or how.  But yes, sacripantina cake definitely registered on my food-dar.  The next day, after miraculously hauling my chubby butt up the staircase to Coit Tower, my girlfriend and I returned the way we came and wandered into North Beach.  My synapses were firing as the cognitive map I had briefly pieced together registered that we were on the same street Don's car had driven up the day before.  Deet! Deet! Deet! Deet!  Walking, walking, walking and BAM!  Stella's  was across the street.  We booked it across the street and I stared into the counter attendant's eyes meaningfully as I asked for a slice sacripantina and an espresso.  (I never order espresso.  Lattes, chai, mochas, coffee straight up?  Sure.  Apparently something about walking into Stella makes you want to go deep with your cake eating experience.)  That little square of cake was perfection.  Under $5 for a slice of indescribable cake heaven.  If you visit San Fran, I would definitely add Stella Bakery to your foodie short-list. (I would give an overall 5 star rating if the service had impressed; instead I noticed myself and another woman waiting a long time to be acknowledged by one of the 3 people behind the counter.  They didn't do anything terribly, they just weren't doing it up 5-star style either.)", "author": "SanDiego77 S."}

Based off of their website, I was expecting a lot nicer, but it wasn't too shabby. \n\nThe Food:\nThe pastries themselves don't look spectacular, but there is a simplicity in flavors that was definitely noted and appreciated. A small slice cost a little less than $5, which is not too bad, but I think this place would be a five star joint if I could get at least one more pastry with the same five dollar bill.\n\nThe Best Part:\nI walked in as they were bringing the Tiramisu out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-27", "description": "Please note:  This review is based on their coffee which many people seem to like.  I would disagree.\n\nI've decided to delete my old post for this shop and write a new one based on more experience I've had with this place.  I originally gave this place 4 stars  based on their cannolis and their caps and espresso.  I have now changed this rating to 2 stars.  My biggest grief being their coffee (the cannolis are still great.)  The major problem with their coffee (which would make me go elsewhere,) is that they pre-grind their coffee and have it sit in the group dispenser of their coffee grinder all day.  Then they dose it into a portafilter and DO NOT tamp it!  They just lightly press the grounds flat.  The problem with this approach is that sometimes you get good coffee (as you would if you tamped,) but it is VERY inconsistent, and more often that not, as I have experienced here, the coffee tastes different with every cup (sometimes sour, sometimes bitter, sometimes thin, sometimes thick.)  Tamping is a MUST with ANY espresso drink (as well as grinding your coffee right before making the drink--not grinding it in the AM just to have it sit around losing flavor and getting stale.)\n\nAgain, I know this place isn't geared towards coffee, it's geared towards the deserts (and for that I give it 4 stars.)  But still, I search SF and beyond for nice spots for coffee and this place came up as a place with good coffee, so I have to give my 2 cents.", "author": "Eliot J."}

Thus, I yelped, and found Stella. I had heard of this place before, and we decided that despite its locale in North Beach, where the parking is scarce, we took our chances and jumped in my Jetta, scooting around the hills of the city towards our destination. \nAfter a VERY illegal U-Turn, some walking, we made it. It glowed like heaven should glow when you die. Even though it doesn't SMELL good when you enter Stella, the pastries gleam in their cases. I am quickly $15 poorer, and we head home.\nMan oh man. Try their special cake. It melts in your mouth, and all the flavors, it's actually pretty complex, whatever they add into the cream. My mom's black and white cake tastes like what a Hostess Cupcake SHOULD taste like, but doesn't. And her eyes bugged out when she ate her canolli (and it should be noted, she spent quality time in NYC, so she knows what canolli should taste like)  I mentioned that I was going to take my friend on Thursday, and she said \"you better bring me back a piece of cake\" almost somewhat menacingly.\nA little on the pricey side, but I'd consider ordering birthday cake from here.

The desserts were really fantastic, however they were not abundant.  We noticed that there were only few of each dessert in the display case, and that the employees will run to the back to replenish as needed.  So don't be discouraged, many people had came in asked if they had more in the back where there were empty spaces and were able to get the treat they wanted!  My husband did notice that when he ran to the restroom, the cannoli shells are purchased frozen as well as many other desserts.

So good, that I asked my fiance to get me my own cake for just moi (ok, I did share a little with him but just a little) for my bday.  I chose the cake that served 6-8 ppl.  And I motored through it.  This is one of the best cake's I have ever had.  EVER.  And I am not your typical workout fanatic who does not eat.  I eat cake and other baked goods appx. 3-4 times a week (cutting down for me too).  This cake is amazing.  The whipped cream on top, the light, fluffy cake in the middle (mine was 4 layers but they have shorter stacks), and the middle filling is superb.  I think it's mascarpone or some type of birds eye custard.  The whole thing is just delectable.  I really only have had that one cake there, but I give it an A+++ and can't wait for my next bday when I get another whole cake to myself!", "author": "Deal G."}

The owner is such a sweetie and she is there like everyday. It's a family business and you can tell they take a lot of pride in it. The cakes and cookies are little works of art and are delicious. On Halloween the kids mob the place during trick or treating time and if you want a cake or something during the holidays order in advance because there is not a chance there will just be something there.

I am a starbucks die hard so of course when I think of certain things, i think of the starbucks way. Well, not realizing that the white chocolate mocha is not the same everywhere, i unfortunately ordered one of these from Stella. Well, first the drink was $5 which I paid without complaint. Well imagine my surprise when I received my drink, doused in foam. It was gross. All i asked was for the barista to take some of the foam off of the drink. He agreed at first, then under his breath told me that if I wanted no foam i should have said something before. I was like, um...then give it back. if you are going to get an attitude about it then just give it back and get over it. He got kind of offended that i talked back but I couldn't help it. I had just paid $5 for something that is $4.20 at the bux and I couldnt even get it the way I wanted!
