Dirty chais are my fave for when I need an extra pickmeup boost during the day. \n\nI've tried the Tiger, Elephant, and White Shark chai teas & the chai flight. The flight wasn't my favorite - I would recommend going for one of the listed above instead. The menu shows you the level of sweet and spicy for each of the drinks, which is really handy. \n\nElephant is great for people who love more sweetness, Tiger is the standard but still a little more on the sweet side. The White Shark is my favorite since it's has a nice balance of sweet and spicy!

I've had Chai brewed fresh with tea leaves, cardamom, anise, fennel, and cloves with a splash of milk and sugar, and the Tiger Spice Chai seemed quite a departure from that. Unfortunately you cannot customize the sweetness of drinks as everything is made from powder. What you can customize is the type of milk you use (soy, almond, etc). I suppose the purpose of having several Chai teas on the menu is for patrons to choose their sweet and spicy level, but the earthiness of the spices don't come out quite the way they would if you freshly brewed them.

Ah, San Francisco. \n \nI always walk past this place and am drawn by the orange coloring and cool interior, but this time I actually stepped inside and ordered a Green Tortoise Chai with almond milk. I was a bit afraid of not liking the chai or being overpowered by the milk when I saw how much the the barista was pouring into the cup, but I actually really liked it. The almond milk makes the drink so much more fragrant, and there was the slightest hint of spices from the chai. I didn't really catch the green tea flavor, but I'm okay with this too. \n\nThere are a lot of places to sit inside and wifi. The bar facing the window is a bit low if you're planning on using a laptop and will most likely give you some back pain. There are couches and other tables throughout, and a variety of baked goods, sandwiches, and salads in case you need some food to go with your chai.

This place is everything a small business coffee shop cold hope to be. They have original drinks, food, special days, and great atmosphere considering the location. \n\nFront and center Market Street, closer to the Civic center side, can look a bit rough on the outside. The Chai Bar offers a chic little spot with plenty of outlets and modern charm. The staff is very friendly and keeps the place in good shape all throughout the day. They offer more than just chai, but it is definitely the primary draw. I can come in on any day, order a drink, and just work on random things between shifts. I once even spent a few hours here.\n\nThe food is good as well ! On Thursdays they hand make onigiri and it's totally worth it. At 3.75 a pop, they are filling and fresh. They offer their drinks both hot and cold, and the Golden Tumeric Latte is a great boost ( if you've ever been curious about trying the newest health craze, try it here ! ). They also offer beer and wine on tap, in case you want to get a little day drunk.\n\nThey change their WiFi every day, which is actually a solid idea, and they have a key code on their restroom. All in all, a solid business with a pretty big following already. Every day I see a bunch of folks on their computers or in small groups.

But just sweet enough to bring out the spice. Versatile. Whitewashed at times (lookin at you, Starbucks pumpkin spice chai tea latte). Bold. But bitter when not in its right state. Yeah idk where I'm going with this but I love chai hahaha\n\nI was walking down the street when the words \"CHAI BAR\" immediately caught my attention. I forgot why I was even in the city and immediately rushed in. The orange cups and hipster aesthetic were calling my name. DAS MY JAM\n\nThe first time I was here, there was a fly in my drink :( I went back and told the baristas, and they gave me a refund. I was super disgusted and irked that there was a huge winged insect floating around in my tea, but I was kinda bummed that they didn't also offer to remake it...idk I was really enjoying it before I noticed the fly (and then proceeded to do a spit-take). But I needed a place to study and thought of David Rio and decided to give it a second chance recently!!\n\nWhat I've had:\n- Elephant White Chai, iced with macadamia milk:  This has Madagascar vanilla and honey. It was REALLLLLLY sweet. I kinda thought it was way tooooooo sweet...but I still really liked it? I almost never get my tea with sweetener, so the first sip was like...wow this is not what my mouth was expecting. They rank all of their drinks using a flavor guide bar for sweet and spicy, and this one was more towards the sweet end. But I was really intrigued by the description of the combo of vanilla and honey. Overall, super delicious and refreshing!! But maybe not the best choice if you like your drinks without sweetener\n- Tiger Spice Chai, iced with macadamia milk: This is their signature blend. It has ground cinnamon, cardamom, and clove. This is supposed to be around half sweet and half spicy, but I kinda thought this was way too sweet too...nonetheless, super refreshing and full of flavor. I could definitely taste the hint of spiciness, even if it was kinda overpowered. Maybe it was the macadamia milk adding to the sweetness too? Idk...but I really liked the nutty taste of it! It's not something you can find everywhere. I highly recommend this brew!!\n\nBottom line: I think I'll be back if I'm in the area!! I kinda wanna try the Boldly Spiced Chai straight up (unsweetened + cayenne pepper). Cayenne in tea...interesting. ALSO THEY HAVE MACADAMIA MILK!! That's kinda rare!! It costs an additional $1.00. As for their other non-dairy milk options, they have soy, almond, and hazelnut (pretty rare for a tea/coffee place), which all cost $0.50. I believe iced drinks only come in the large size. They have wifi and power outlets, as well as a bunch of seating. The wifi wasn't the fastest, but it worked. They also serve coffee, alcohol, and food.

The seaweed salad is a great snack, chewy and crunchy with lots of bite in the way seaweed is and just enough to hold you over. I also had their seasonal medley salad which consisted of a hard boiled egg, goat cheese, beets and some seasonal fruits and spicy chai vinaigrette.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "Has chai actually become a \"thing\" now? Apparently so judging by the surprisingly expansive space opened by chai connoisseurs David Scott Lowe and Rio Miura, former spouses who continued as business partners. They see it as the intractable bridge between coffee and tea. I see it as a good excuse to reinvigorate an area adjacent to the problematic corner of Sixth Street and Market. Between this business, Equator Coffee across Market and Montesacro Pinseria on Stevenson, I have a guarded optimism about seeing something of a commercial lift in the neighborhood. I came by around 7PM on a Tuesday and noticed they were already starting to get ready to close by 8. At the same time, they didn't rush me along either.\n\nIn fact, there's a greeter who stands at the door and does a bit of a commercial about the place. He seemed too skinny to be a bouncer like the guy who constantly stands in front of the door at Equator. As I perused the eight choices of chai on the menu (photo: http://bit.ly/1RATZHj), I decided to try their signature drink, the $4.50, 12-ounce Elephant Vanilla Chai where they blend black tea with Madagascar vanilla. What I liked in particular was the big cup in which they serve it plus the pitcher where they place the overage amount (photo: http://bit.ly/1JjyFfL). I sat myself at the orange banquette at a large table since there were only three other customers in the place. It was smooth though maybe a tad sweeter than I was hoping it would be.\n\nThey sell tea and coffee in case you're not willing to jump on the chai bandwagon. They even offer an Arnold Palmer-like cold drink called the Steph Curry, of course. There are baked goods including pretzels and a caramel cookie waffle that looked intriguing (photo: http://bit.ly/1HQ8c8x), although nothing was appealing to me at that hour. Probably of most interest is a laboratory-like set-up in a room behind the counter where Lowe apparently comes up with new variations on chai. I noticed he's adding a bubble chai selection which made me think he could take advantage of customer spillover from Sharetea in the Metreon. I hope its hipster-centric following can keep Chai Bar by David Rio afloat for the foreseeable future.\n\nCHAI - 4 stars...one big cup of sweetness but it's rich enough to keep my interest\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nothing wrong with a lot of space, especially in this neighborhood\nSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit terse and coolish\nTOTAL - 4 stars...chai me up, chai me down", "author": "Ed U."}

Considering I came on a Friday, there were a good number of seats consistently available, mostly on the communal table. They have wifi (it's a bit slow but tolerable if you're just doing basic work), clean restrooms, plus food (salads, sandwiches, onigiri, baked goods, quiche) and drinks. The service is also incredibly friendly and helpful.\n\nSince I was here for a few hours I got to try a couple things. In general nothing blew my mind but I was happy enough with what I got.\n\nFor my drinks I couldn't decide between two drinks and they offered to let me \"split\" a large so I basically got ~1.75 cups of 2 kinds of drinks. The drinks are made of powder but it's definitely not bad, just slightly less clean tasting. \n\n1) Tortoise Green Tea Chai w/ Macadamia Milk: Despite the description, I found it to be very light and bordering too sweet. The chai flavor was there but not too much. It's simultaneously light and heavy. It was decent but I preferred my second drink more. (3.5/5)\n\n2) Cub Chai w/ Macadamia : This was right up my alley. It was still a bit sweet but it was heavier on the spices and the slight pepperiness in it was wonderful. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Spicy Chashu Onigiri: I ate it cold from the fridge so it's not as good as it could have been. In general it was a bit salty but the pork wasn't dry which was a pleasant surprise. It has a bit of spiciness to it but mainly from the sriracha. (2.5/5)\n\n4) Ham, Brie, Apple Sandwich: This is one of my favorite combinations and the sandwich was still good but I prefer different ratios. This one is heavier on the ham (they chose a nice one that has some bite and isn't too salty), lighter on the cheese, and just right on the apple. Definitely ask for it grilled, the bread they use has a great texture when heated. I think there was also a bit of honey and mustard in there too which was a nice touch. (3.5/5)\n\nOverall, I love this place. Not everything I ordered was perfect but the general menu selection and atmosphere are so great that it makes up for it. I don't know if I'd go out of my here just to grab something to-go but if I ever need a spot to unwind, I'll definitely drop by again.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I really want to like this place and the staff is great, super friendly. But the chai is to artificial for me. I was expecting something more authentic but I was way off. I like the concept of a Chai bar and considering the fact that there are a million coffee shops in San Francisco you would think that a chai bar would serve better chai than coffee shops. The ingredients are key and I think thats why I didn't enjoy the chai here. They use too much \"fluff\" in the powder and I feel like I can taste it. I feel like all the chai's taste the same in some way its like they all have the same base or something. Its a cute place to do work and maybe get a snack or something but I don't think I am going to get chai here again. :/ i guess its just not my cup of tea if you know what I mean.", "author": "Cindy M."}

The Cub Chai was delicious -- very spicy. creamy, and not very sweet. I was also able to sample the Tiger Chai which was sweeter than the Cub, equally creamy, with a slightly different Chai taste (not as spicy). In the end, I preferred the Tiger to the Cub.\n\nH and I stayed in the bar for a while, utilizing the big, comfy seats.

If I was younger, I would probably study here at some point- that's the type of atmosphere. The chai itself was... chai. It wasn't bad, it wasn't world-changing. It was just chai. I suppose if I tried some of the more esoteric flavors I would have a different opinion, but I went with the spicy chai, which wasn't that spicy. The customer service was a little odd- some were really friendly and some were very off-putting.

If you're in a grab and go situation, I recommend trying this place. I've had the Elephant Vanilla Chai with almond milk and Tortoise Green Tea Chai. Both were delicious. \n\nI'm subtracting two stars because of the service. The girl at the counter was more concerned with talking to her friend than taking my order. When it was time to close, she complained loudly about why they were still taking orders. She also loudly told her friend in the store that she would let him stay after she kicked everyone else out. Her words, not mine. I ultimately regretted tipping her.\n\nI'm subtracting another star because store hours on the door are incorrect. It lists they are open until 7 pm on Sundays but we were told to leave at 6 pm.\n\nThis could be a great place to enjoy some chai and work on things because the ambiance is nice (plus the seats along the wall are padded which is always good for those longer laptop sessions) but it's just not there yet.", "author": "Simone P."}

After pondering the extensive chai menu, I settled on the Elephant Vanilla Chai with nonfat milk (they have a decent selection of flavored and non-flavored milks to choose from). \n\nThe chai was creamy, and also sweeter than I initially thought it would be - but regardless, delicious! If you're looking for the authentic \"Indian chai\" - maybe not so much the place - but David Rio's version of chai was still pretty great.

I'd rather have chai enthusiasts make a trip to Asha Tea House or samovar (although no place compares to the authentic chai made at home with freshly grated ginger and fresh aromatic cardamom ).  This place is an insult to chai, to India, and to anyone who knows better than to drink powdered chai! I guess your company can sell its mediocre powder to Quickly- as they love unauthentic powdered drinks. Thanks David, and your wife Rio, for promoting a false understanding of chai.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-15", "description": "Service and Space:\nThe moment I entered this place, I fell in love. Chai Bar lives up to its name--it is, indeed, a bar, and one that serves wine and beer. Better yet, it serves tea, coffee, and chai tea. That last option is what makes this place one of my favorite stops in SF. There are seatings for those who just want to lounge around a table with their friends, but also a bar for frequenters to sit down and order their dose of caffeine or alcohol.\n\nThe workers switch in between bartending and barista vibes. They're perfectly happy modifying your drink to your heart's content, and I've also seen them converse with regular patrons with nothing but the utmost geniality. In any case, I'm impressed that the barista who took my order was patient enough to answer all of my questions about the tea and milk content. \n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nMilk:\nCan't get enough of the milk options--this was the first place I've had macadamia nut milk. If you're looking for a more chocolate, Nutella-esque taste to your drink, ask for the hazelnut option.\n\nChai:\n- Chocolate Chai: A Tiger Spice Chai with with cocoa, and only slightly sweet for those who want a chocolate delicacy without too much sugar. The balance between cocoa and chai is just right, since the chocolate doesn't overwhelm other flavors. \n- Bubble Chai: I'll admit--I only got this to taste the pearls, which were just average. I chose to get this with the Power Chai, to get a more milk tea taste.\n- Boldly Spiced Chai: Since I'm such a fan of unsweetened drinks, this extremely strong chai is one of my top choices whenever I head here. You can ask for some sweetener added to this drink if you're a fan of the extra spice.\n- Power Chai: Matcha and chai, my two favorite flavors, mixed together? Sure, it's an odd combo at first, but if you're looking for an earthier taste to your chai tea, this is a solid option.\n\nFood:\nNot only are the drink options phenomenal, the food provided at Chai Bar is even better. \n- Onigiri: You can select from sushi rice, or Chai Bar's own rice, which takes these rice balls to an entirely new level. Although the teriyaki options are delicious, my favorite is the pickled plum. If you're more willing to embrace the fusion side of this cuisine, then go for the umeboshi with the mixed rice.\n- Soup: Slightly overpriced, but the standout soup between all the options is the roasted red pepper and gouda. I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, but the addition of this delightful dairy makes an otherwise underwhelming soup slightly richer.\n\nI'm going to be honest: I'm looking forward to more trips to this side of the city just to show off Chai Bar to my friends. I'll only slightly regret how ridiculous (but delicious) this place is. Oh, Happy Hour serves alcohol? Maybe I'll come for that... but for now, I'd rather get the chai.", "author": "Kat P."}

You actually can't do better downtown-it's a block from the northern Powell BART entrance, just far enough that it's not insanely packed 24/7 and just close enough to always be accessible. \n\nThe vibe in Chai Bar is supreme. Their music is always on point, (when I was writing this review: Run the Jewels, Hieroglyphics, the Fugees). About half of the room will be folks doing work on laptops, or talking with friends. The other half is folks meeting up after work, or catching up with friends, or on dates. AND ALSO Chai Bar has super clean bathrooms, and fast wi-fi. For a student trying to work and trying to get her social drink on, this setup could not be better. Did I mention that they have so many outlets, that I've never needed to wait for one? \n\nTheir chai is fantastic, simply because of the breadth and quality of options. You can get chai drinks hot and chilled, at different levels of sweetness and spiciness. They have more traditional offerings, and more adventurous (try the Bubble Chai with boba!). They also have a wide range of milks-your more normal whole milk and soy and almond, but also macadamia nut milk! They also have non-chai tea drinks, both hot and cold. Try the Steph Curry. With clove, cinnamon, and cardamom, you'll thank me later. \n\nBut also; Chai Bar carries a respectable range of alcoholic drinks. Normally, their beer selection will rotate six or seven California craft brews at a time, and a few out of state breweries represented as well. As my home for 3/4 of the year is San Diego, I'm VERY picky about my craft beers. Their selection always incorporates at least 3-4 SD breweries, so I'm always happy! They also have four or so rotating wines. Which isn't really my thing-I'm more of a beer person, BUT people who order wines here are generally happy with the offerings. Source: pretentious friend from Napa who came for a visit a couple months back. \n\nService here is seriously fantastic as well. All of the folks who work here are very welcoming, and work to deliver super high quality goods in very short amounts of time. Even when it's been packed, I've never waited more than five minutes for a drink. \n\nLong story short: if you need somewhere with bomb drinks (and onigiri YESS GIRL YESSS), and wi-fi, and aesthetically pleasing music and seating, Chai Bar is where you should be. The outlets. The chai. The craft beers on tap. The super friendly service. Actually, why aren't you there now?", "author": "Claire M."}

It's not bad, it's just not as great as it's been rated on here. Service way slower than molasses and had what in my profession would be termed a \"restricted\" or even \"blunted\" affect. \n\nThe chocolate chai latte I got was lack luster but palatable. It tasted smoky... maybe slightly burnt. Also, I kind of feel begrudgingly when places charge extra to make my drink lighter on the lactose. (It's tacky in my opinion to charge for special diets, particularly involuntary ones.) Thankfully they offer something other than cheap, crappy nasty soy milk.\n\nBut damn did it take a long ass time to order and wait for cup of mediocrity.  Like 25 minutes from getting in line to cup in hand. Do not go here with the intention to catch a train in a little while like I did. It wasn't even busy... only like three people were in line in front of me and there was still open seats to spare.\n\nThe place does smell very good and appears to be very clean.... which is good because even if you order to go you will be there a while. If you're very familiar with the area and on your own this also leaves you plenty of solitary meditation time to contemplate all the cheaper, faster places to get a cup of chai. It also leaves time to reconsider one's stance on Starbucks and its merits of often friendly service that is often too fast to debate how tacky you'd feel asking to be refunded so you can leave, sans chai latte, and get on with your life.\n\nThis place is mediocre and over branded much like Starbucks, only way slower.

I've only gone twice since Chai Bar has opened but of the two chai's that I tried, tiger has been my favorite. I am definitely more of a fan of the iced chai over warm, as the warm is not quite hot enough for my liking. One other criticism I have is I feel like some of the drinks here are a bit too sweet.

Almost somewhat like a chai-snob @ every cafe asking \"Is it powder, or syrup? Also, what brand. \" For years, I settled for mediocre chai until one time I found David Rio's brand. One sip & it was love @ first tastebud. Sooooo...when I heard they were opening a store, I was ecstatic. The tiger spice chai is my favorite. In my opinion, not too sweet/spicy. I'm kind of stuck in my ways-- in a sense where if I like a drink or certain dish, I'll probably order the same thing, so I'm not disappointed. However, the last time I visited I tried something new. (Kinda sounds a lot like my life in general right now .) Tried to stay opened minded about the other many flavors they offered and tried the tortoise green tea chai. Definitely a winner, but a little on the sweeter side. In terms of the atmosphere, pretty chill. Wi-if, music, tables and an actual bar. Parking may be the only downfall since it's right on Market St. Regardless, very much worth circling the block 1 or 2 times.", "author": "Janelle D."}

It's nice and spacious, is right next to my office, and has a great combo and selection of coffee, chai and beer, but the service had been disappointing. I've been here before when things were a little rough around the edges, but today was the worst and prompted this review. The guy working the register was very confused about my bagel order - if it was supposed to be plain or everything, and if it was supposed to be toasted or not, and what kind of topping I wanted. This was immediately after I asked for \"an everything bagel, toasted with cream cheese.\" After a bit of repeating myself so he could finally getting my order right, my latte came out quickly. About 15 minutes later my bagel finally arrived. The wrong bagel: plain instead of everything. Normally it's a simple mistake and I would let it go, but my previous experiences here combined with the initial confusion, plus the delay behind just one other customer waiting for food, was really unfortunate and doesn't bode well for this place.\n\nI'm only giving 3 stars instead of 2 because I think they can get better, especially since the latte was good and the space is great.

It's got more non dairy options than dairy options!  The cub chai is the perfect spicy sweet chai- that bite that is missing from your run of the mill coffee shop chai which just hits a sweet cinnamon spot. This has it all covered and has a version of the cub chai (forgot the name) that is unsweetened and all spice. \nThe atmosphere has wonderful natural light and I love the black and white tile work on the floor. It's open and has the perfect ambient noise level. It looks very hip, but the clientele are random, not hipster. Very unpretentious.\nThe staff is very warm and helpful in suggesting your perfect cup of chai. It's like philz for chai. They work fast too, my drinks are always out before I finish downing a glass of their fancy lemon mint cucumber water.\nI've only had the \"ferry building\" mushroom rice square but it's now a must grab every time I go in. The wrapper is really fun to unwrap, I don't get to say that often, it's packaged in a way that the sticky rice and mushrooms are separately wrapped from the nori, but after you unwrap and pull the sides you magically have a crispy nori wrapped rice square. It's fun, too much fun. Or I'm just simple. Decide for yourself, either way the chai is great.", "author": "Sarah F."}

It's a really short walk from BART and from Union Square and a nice reprieve from the other busy shops and cafes. There's a good variety of drinks and something for everyone- green tea, vanilla, chocolate, iced, toppings, etc. When they poured the drinks, they made it a visual experience- setting out the (very cool!) tea cups and pouring it there in front of us. I had the Elephant Vanilla and my friend had the Chocolate Assam Frost- both were amazing. Every sip was indulgent! \n\nThe store itself is very spacious with window seats, couch-style seating, booths and tables, as well as bar seats and outdoor seating. I feel that they could squeeze in a couple more tables to increase the amount of people. Also, the staff didn't seem to know the products too well which made ordering a little less than smooth.\n\nGood place to hang out, have a casual meeting, or catch up with friends.

When I walked into the Chai Bar, I was more than pleasantly surprised by the beautiful design and openness of the place, especially since around the corner from the place was filled with the smell of urine. You gotta love the City! Anyway, I knew I had to order the Stephen Curry drink even though it sounded odd, but I tend to like to try unique things. The \"chai-rista\" (I made this up but feel free to use) described the drink as tasting like an Arnold Palmer with chai spices and that it was a refreshing summer drink, so I went for it - and it tasted exactly like she described! My son ordered the Chocolate Chai, and he loved it! The other great thing about this bar is that they have all these small snacks from the savory to the sweet to accompany your drinks. We ordered a handful of their rice rolls, and they were all tasty - we tried the mushroom, Spam, and the tuna salad one. They were all delicious! As for dessert, we had the chocolate covered macaroon, and it was big and tasty! Customer service was excellent. The chai-rista even came around to our table later to give us a sample of a the Tiger Chai with almond milk, which was frothy & yummy.

Bummer :(\nI came with the intention to get work done, and I couldn't figure out how to get the wifi going. However, I didn't reach out to one of the employees, so I'll do that next time. I ended up just sitting for a little, which isn't too bad.\nAlso, the cafe itself is really spacious and has plenty of room for sitting. Customer service was ok. The guy taking my order wasn't friendly, and seemed new. I have experienced better service before. The barista seemed nice enough though. \nI might give this place another try :)", "author": "Kiki C."}

I've ordered the Power Chai and the Original and they are good. I'm impressed but I won't give it 5 stars because it's not the best Chai I've ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "I dont always drink chai but when i do...its masala chai from an indian restaurant and that's the kind i like...strong tea and spices with just enough milk and sweetness to my liking.  I tried the boxed stuff but those have always been too sweet. So sometimes i get the bagged tea. \n\nChai bar though uses powder which means there's already dairy in the mix and then they add more dairy so it's milked down by all that milky milk and some hot water. And if you get a flavored non original chai, say the elephant vanilla or the green tea, it's going to be super sweet. Super sweet frothy milk with a hint chai spice but it aint spicey. I mean, i kind of like it, its ok but wished the tea was strong. The Tiger had more tea flavor but it was all still pretty milked down.\nDefinitely not what i was expecting from this chai bar. I liked the Steph Curry though. It's not chai but it's made there...not with powder. And it tastes pretty good. Ambiance is cool.", "author": "Mila B."}
