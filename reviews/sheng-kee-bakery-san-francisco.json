They're pretty and I was feeling generous. Hubs picked it up and we sat down to enjoy our desserts after dinner. We purchased the mocha, peach and strawberry cake so that we could try a few flavors. \n\nI didn't know you could make cake filling taste like plastic foam till I had this cake. It was awful. Though it was just slightly sweeter than average Asian cakes, which is good, the texture of the filling is best described as a marshmallow foam. I actually stopped chewing and looked over at my husband with my sad panicked face while my mouth hung open. My eyes screaming, \"What have I done?!? To deserve this?!? I wanted to trust you, Sheng Kee!!\" I didn't want to chew the foam. Being a good Asian, I tried to power through it but hubs made the call and swooped it up and away before we wasted anymore calories on this cake. \n\nWith all the other fancy Chinese bakeries around now like Paris baguette and 85 degrees. I don't see a bright future for these guys. It's sad. They failed the authenticity test on their baos and when I came back to try their cakes, I was disappointed once again. \n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I won't be coming in to try your latest \"Dirty\" bun for a third attempt. (Who wants to eat something named Dirty anyway? The marketing department needs a taking to.).", "author": "Marie L."}

I especially loved their yogurt, it looked imported from China, which would make sense since it wasn't as sweet as the American yogurts I have tried.

They called and adamantly insisted that they were correct.

There is a wide selection of baked good to choose from. Though I enjoyed going through all the choices, I felt that a few things held Sheng Kee from being an outstanding place to eat.\n\nFirst... the good! When you first go into the restaurant, you are bombarded with a ton of choices. There are numerous items ranging from pineapple buns to pork sung rolls,  to sandwiches and even cakes. And looking at the price is great... because most items are under $1.50. Grab a tray, get a wax sheet on it... and go crazy!\n\nIf you are a fan of the corn, ham, and egg filled pastries, you'll enjoy this place. I, for one, am not as big on these types of desserts/baked goods. They lack some refinement to me, as I tend to go for pastries that have a lighter taste. The desserts here tend to be heavier and more dense/filling. I'm also a bit wary of the overall quality of the food. Again, it's just not as refined as I would like it to be.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more savory, Sheng Kee has a few items for you, but not much. There are some bbq pork pastries, as well as curry turnovers and a chicken pie... that's really it, though, unless you count the pre-made sandwiches in the cold case.

My favorites are the taro buns and pineapple red bean buns. The green onion buns can verge on overly oily and a little too creamy for my liking. I'm a huge fan of the beef curry horns (available near the register because they're hot). I consider them an indulgence because their exterior is extremely buttery and flakey, with just the right amount of golden browning. The interior has slightly sweet curried beef, and overall the little horn is aromatic and delicious. \n\nNote: $10 minimum for credit cards!", "author": "Michelle S."}

My favorites were definitely the ones with ham and bacon in them, but the biggest surprise was how much I enjoyed their tiger tea.

However, there's something about those individually wrapped breads and pastries at Sheng Kee that just seem so appealing and irresistible. Seriously, I'm a sucker for good packaging and presentation. \n\nMy mom prolly buys bread from Sheng Kee almost weekly. Hence, I've tried the thick toast, egg, wheat, raisin, red bean and taro breads. Not my favorite, but pretty good especially when fresh. I also tried some of their baked buns both savory and sweet. Not too crazy about those either. I do like their little moon cakes though! The jasmine and oolong tea flavored ones are my favorites....besides the white lotus one. \n\nThe cakes at SK are like most Asian cakes - not too sweet, usually some sort of sponge cake with light cream. They generally look very nice and are always a hit when you bring them to a party or some sort of celebration. A few of my favorites are the mango mousse, chocolate and mocha cakes. I have also tried the taro filled one, which I thought was OK as was the green tea cake. Most of the cakes are decorated very nicely and topped with fruit. The cakes are also reasonably priced and it's nice that you don't necessarily have to special order (unless you want to get something specific or large sheet cake)....very convenient if you need to just drop in to pick up a cake since they always have a bunch ready made. You can also buy some of the cakes by the slices if you can't eat a whole one.\n\nParking at this location can be tough as you all know Irving street is poppin'.

There seemed to be a much smaller selection at this location. \n\nAnyways, on to the cake: ive tried their taro cake and that really realllly good. This time, I was deciding between strawberry mousse and French chestnut mousse cake. I was dissapointed that both cakes have a very deceiving exterior. Go see the picture. Initially I thought it was only the strawberry one, but I asked the worker and she said there's only one layer of mousse inside. I ended up getting the chestnut cake. They accept credit card!!  Also, they decorated a piece of white chocolate with the birthday greeting, which is a nice service. \n\nMy family LOVES chestnut, but the cake was all a lie. There was a thin layer around the outside of the cake to give it an appearance of having two layers of mousse, but in reality, there was more cake than mousse. Needless to say, I was disappointed. If anything, Sheng kee could've added a disclaimer!The cake doesn't taste as good as Chinese fruit cake nor the chestnut cake from Napoleon in Chinatown.

And then I was starting to say something else when she said, our taro milk tea is popular too. Well, I was going to get taro milk tea anyways, so it didn't matter... I wasn't planning on getting normal milk tea (I wanted the thai ice tea or the hazelnut flavor), but I didn't mind too much. \n\nSo I got both without ice and waited for like, two minutes. \n\nI think their system is interesting. They give you a number which is on your receipt and then you show it to them when you get your bubble tea. Now, I also bought something else with that and I normally like to keep the receipts. The lady, who ironically enough, was also the lady who told me the whole \"warm bread slicing\" concept, was the one to hand me my bubble tea. She crumpled up my receipt and I thanked her.

I can still remember the pineapple bun with the sweet peanut butter filling and the miniature moon cakes with the lotus paste.  Shortly after that visit I found out that Sheng Kee had a location in San Francisco.  I have been a regular customer at this location ever since.\n\nAlthough I truly miss the peanut butter version of the pineapple bun, I regularly purchase the ones with the custard or red bean paste fillings.  I love the custard bread with raisins, and on more than one occasion I've found myself eating an entire loaf of bread in less than 24 hours.  I like the sliced cake rolls also especially the orange or strawberry ones because they have a different flavor and they're not too sweet.  The super flaky beef curry pastry found inside a hot box near the counter is very good.  This morning I tried the moon-shaped chocolate bun for the first time, and I loved it.  This is without a doubt my favorite Chinese bakery in the City.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Seriously, there's coconut, taro, custard, chocolate...and of course, original and HK-style original (apparently there's a difference).  I've had all of them, and like snowflakes, they're each original and unique.  Having said that, given the amount of cholesterol in these things (the topping is made of egg yolks plus sugar), perhaps these are best as a once in a while thing instead of a regular habit...thing.  Anyway, for a really interesting pineapple bun experience, try toasting these (especially the taro and chocolate ones)...they get all crunchy on the outside, but the filling gets nice and gooey.  Yum!\n\nMoving on to the other buns, I've had \n- the taro twist (a personal favorite; wonderfully mild flavor...eat 'em hot), \n- the coconut twist thing (also delicious and also not that healthy)\n- bbq pork bun (i've had better..and cheaper)\n- red bean bun and taro bun (see bbq pork bun)\n- moon shaped chocolate bun: unique.  I can't say I've ever encountered a bun quite like this one and I'm still not sure what they were going for with the Mexican bun crust plus the super sweet chocolate inside.  Still, I've had it more than once, so I guess it works on some irresistible level.\n- vietnamese sandwiches: the ones at irving cafe & deli down the street are better, plus I bit into a jalapeno and my mouth went numb for an hour...\n\nSome other reviewers have mentioned that this place is pricey, and it is (in fact, their prices have gone up recently).  Plus, they no longer have the special $1.50 for any two buns after 7:00 pm thing (I once saw an old Asian woman knock a plastic tray full of buns out of another old Asian lady's hands...intentionally).  I'd say those two things have knocked them down a notch in my book, but as was mentioned before, this really is the only nicer Asian bakery in Richmond/Sunset, so if you're looking for a higher caliber of bun, this is it.", "author": "Jeffrey T."}

What really got me was that she proceeded to use a plastic glove to pick up the strawberry from the murky shelf and placed it back on my cake!!?! Needless to say, I told her that I didn't want that cake because it was unsanitary. She rudely responded declaring nothing was wrong with the cake. Fortunately, before a cake fight pursued, another more mature clerk stepped in to assist me with selecting another cake. I selected another cake alright. But be warned, the clerk returned the unsanitary cake back in the frig to be sold to an unsuspecting customer. My feedback to Shen Kee management: make customer service training mandatory and have stricter food handling guidelines. I will not be returning.", "author": "Katie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-15", "description": "Sheng Kee's method for keeping prices low seems to be to reduce the amount of filling in the buns.  It seems like every year, there's less filling.  When you bite into a red bean bun, it's mostly air, which is frustrating.   I mean there's only a teaspoon of red bean paste in there and the rest is AIR.  The bun is the same size on the outside but the shell is thin, hence it's an air pocket.  I'd rather pay more to have more filling in the bun.\n\nBut complaints aside, their buns are tasty and they make really good cakes (the rolls with a thin layer of cream, the triangle wedges).  I've had their large cakes too and they're just right.  Western cakes tend to be too sweet but the Asian bakeries, like Sheng Kee, tone down the sweetness of their cakes.\n\nThey have good bread too, especially the red bean bread.  The Taiwan toast is really good after it's been toasted.  I also come here every year for mooncakes. The mini ones are good and just the right size and you can choose the kinds you like which is better than buying a prepackaged box of mooncakes.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I wonder what that odd cream is you use in your cake...almost the consistency of blended cottage cheese?\n\nThey say they love how you are not too sweet.  I think a cake should be sweeeeeeeeeet.  Your cake consistency is a bit thicker, similar to a Jelly Roll...great for a jelly roll, but not what I look for in a cake.\n\nOh, Sheng Kee...they went to you for my birthday cake last week.  I sat and pondered why?  Why, when they know I love sweet, fresh, light cream filling in my cake...and prefer the cake consistency to be a light, spongy texture that is slightly moist not jelly-rollish... why?  Because they LOVE you...and it doesn't matter what I think.  \n\nI left your jelly-roll like strawberry cake with the odd cream at my mom's and did not take a slice home.

I thought it's cantonese because none of the bakeries in Taiwan nowadays serve items like they do in Sheng Kee. Don't get me wrong, they taste very good, but if it were in Taiwan, it would be terribly out of date. It's sooooo old-fashioned, but once in fashion for sure. I ate breads like Sheng kee's when I very very young, so that's like 20 years ago. In Taiwan, no one would buy things like those anymore, but here, it's a great place to go for nostalgic purpose.\n\nWow. \nAlthough I prefer the bakeries in Taiwan so much more than this cantonese bakery, still, it's the best I've tried in US, better than the Tapan bakery in NYC.\n\nYou might wonder why you don't get any pineapple in the pineapple buns. It refers to the checkered shape of its top, not the taste of pineapple. At home, it's the cheapest bread in any bakery that you only get it when everything else is out. But here, they remind me of home so I fall in love with them after visiting sheng kee.\n\nMy favorite is the Pineaple Taro loaf. A whole loaf of yummy bread costs $3.75? Must be kidding! So cheap and it'll last for a week!\n\nThe moon cakes are very good and it comes in 10 flavors or so. The jasmine and oolong are my favorite. \n\nOk, here comes the Taro mochi cake. I grew up in the town where taro mochi cake originated. It is THE dessert at the president's table when he holds dinner parties for foreign VIP. It's called the national treat in taiwan.

I definitely notice an increase in quality when I come here versus a chinatown bakery. I usually get the coconut bun, which is so delicious in the morning when it is fresh out of the oven. I also get the ham & cheese bun, which is good too but a little too overwhelming. At first, i thought the ham & cheese was better than the coconut bun but not anymore. This place also has some really nice looking cakes but they're quite pricey. The only reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is because they're really expensive for a bakery. I believe the cocunut bun is $1.19 which is outrageous for a bun. I can get a bigger one for 70cents in chinatown but of course the quality is not as good as this place's. Overall, come here if you want to splurge a little on a good quality bread. OMG, how can i forget about their taiwan toast. It's absolutely delicious. I know it's just plain bread but it tastes very good since Sheng Kee uses quality ingredients. Again, it is very pricey. A little of $5 for a full loaf.", "author": "Vivian L."}

I have absolutely no idea where the origin of this bread is, but it's very common in Japan and something I missed a lot in the US. It's a white bread, almost perfectly square, and soft but with sufficient density to stand up to toppings or as a sandwich. Definitely one of the best breads for toast, french toast, or a sandwich! Sheng Kee also has tons of filled buns, and the taro one comes highly recommended.", "author": "Will A."}

There's two types, only the one that is a bit over $1 is tasty. Its even better than the ones from the Golden Mountain or something like that on Grant in Chinatown. Plus service is much better. I LOVE their chocolate mousse cake. There's like 3 different layers of delicious chocolatey-ness. The corn and harm bun isn't bad either. I never had bad experience with any of the workers here.
