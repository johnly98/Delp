I swear it came in 15 minutes once! That's what bumped my rating up to four stars.\n\nOverall, the food is nothing to lose your mind over, but it's satisfying and tasty and the portions are good for the price.\n\nMy two favorites are the orange beef and the appetizer drumsticks. The orange beef kind of reminds me of jerky, in a good way. For this dish I like my meat chewy, and without a glopped-on coating. City Chopstick's version reminds me of how Hunan Homes on Jackson used to make it in the 90s, which is when I first tasted the dish and fell in love with the sweet/savory/chewy/slightly saucy combo.\n\nThe drumsticks deserve a star just for themselves. Damn, those things are crispy and meaty! I don't bother with the sauce because I want to enjoy the crunchy coating. BUT...you have to eat them as soon as they arrive. They don't do well when they cool off, or reheated as leftovers.\n\nMy kid loves the appetizer BBQ pork and the basic chow mein. She eats her fill and there's still plenty left for a robust snack the next day.\n\nCity Chopsticks is a sure thing for us on those nights when the fridge needs to be restocked but we want to eat NOW without spending a boatload of money. In other cases I usually tip cash, but here I recommend adding your (generous) tip to your online order...you'll see what a difference it makes when piping hot Chinese food shows up on your doorstep in less than 30 minutes!", "author": "Valeria R."}

The restaurant looks like a relatively clean Asian restaurant and the people that served us were very attentive, quiet and nice. I noticed a very interesting music playlist. One that would be considered lit in other contexts but not when it is elevator music volume in a Chinese restaurant in mid afernoon. \n\nI think we ordered and had a sip of beer when bam the food came out. So fast my first thought was whether we were too predictable and knew what we were going to order or I was drinking my beer too slowly. I don't think I was conserving my beer because the beers were cheap ($3.50 each for Tsing Tao, Sapporo, Heineken or Anchor Steam - get Sapporo!).\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nPotstickers ($5.95): 6 pieces of fried dumplings that had too much breading and did not taste good.\n\nBok Choy in Garlic Sauce ($9.45): Fresh tasting bok choy in a soupy sauce with nice garlic flavor.\n\nGeneral Tso's Chicken ($10.95): The general tso's chicken was fried well and was coated in a sweet tasty sauce but there was hardly any meat that I could taste no matter how large the pieces were. \n\nMongolian Beef ($10.95): Tasty sliced beef wok fried with a lot of onions and scallions. I'll never say no to more onions and scallions because they can only add more to the flavor. But there wasn't enough beef and a heap of onions was what was left of the dish when we were done. \n\nGreat service and decently clean restaurant but the food was below par and not filling (which is a first for me at a Chinese restaurant). Don't think I'll be coming back here.", "author": "Kyle R."}

Additionally, I think it's so unethical for the restaurant to engage in shady business practices, such as including an unauthorized tip to the bill without even letting the customer know!  The bill was sloppily scribbled in chinese characters, so at first I thought it was something I ordered, or perhaps the tax.  Then upon recalculating my food costs, I realized it was an extra 18% gratuity added on without my knowlege! Not cool. I went to the main server (an older chinese guy) to ask him about the charge, and he reluctantly gave me back my money, since I had already tipped on top of whatever was written on that bill!

I wasn't necessarily looking for that authentic experience though and City Chopsticks was exactly what I wanted: slightly Americanized Chinese food mixed with some traditional options.\n\nI was sat promptly, given water and my server barely spoke english. To me that is a good sign. The menu was huge but I landed on few dishes. Originally I wanted some pork buns but was informed they were sold out - they must be good I thought. I ended up ordering four dishes:\n\nGreen Onion Cake - small traditional style scallion pancakes that came with peanut sauce. I would've liked more scallions, but that is a personal preference.\n\nPotstickers - nothing life changing about these, but they were tasty and gone in less than two minutes because I ate them so fast.\n\nSzhechuan Spicy Chicken and Veggies - This was a vegetable stir fry mixed with thin sliced chicken. It had a chili sauce that I found slightly more sweet than spicy and the dish could've used a little less sauce. I still ate it all regardless!\n\nCrispy Sesame Beef - I'm a sucker for any Asian dish that has thin sliced fried beef. This was a huge plate of of it. The sauce itself wasn't overpoweringly sweet, but again too much of it that made some of the \"crispy\" beef soggy. I would probably ask for lighter sauce or sauce on the side next time.\n\nI also got two orders of white rice which was fluffy, slightly sticky and cooked perfectly. \n\nIt's not a large place and do not expect much in terms of ambience. I never expect much service unless I am fine dining. My water was filled as needed. While I dined I noticed them doing a considerable amount of carry out business. \n\nWith so many Chinese options in SF I still want to discover more, but if I'm around Lower Nob I would definitely eat here again!", "author": "Travis B."}

Most of us probably do not read Chinese characters so they will just add whatever amount they consider right for them as a gratuity and WON'T TELL YOU THAT. IT JUST HAPPENS THAT \"THEY FORGOT TO MENTION\" How convenient! I am a local neighbor who lives almost across the street and finished work late, so I came in and politely asked if they were still opened (They close at 10pm, it was 9:35 when I made it) the counter lady said yes they were open; however, they close soon meaning 10. She agreed to seat us, we ordered in less than 5' and we got our food by 9:51pm. So far so good, by 9:58 I asked for the check, when a gentleman came to pick it up I was not ready because something wasn't adding up right. I used to order the same food for delivery  or pick up very frequently so I kinda knew what the approximate amount was. When he came back bringing the itemized receipt as I requested, of course he pretended not to understand what I meant by the extra charge until the lady came by and had the audacity to admit \"she thought it was better for us to pay a total w tips included\" without telling us gratuity was included. I live in the city close to two decades, so I know how hard everyone in the restaurant industry work to make ends meet and I appreciate to be seated last minute (Not even); however, it is absolutely wrong to force it on costumers, specially loyal people.

My buddy had a serious craving for hot and sour soup and so we went onto grubhub. The reviews for this place are totally correct! So happy we discovered this place. It is Americanized Chinese food, but who the hell cares? \n\nWe ordered the crab rangoon, the string beans with shrimp, the chicken chow mein, the large order of the hot and sour soup, and the orange beef. By the time the delivery guy came, everything was still super hot, which is a huge plus in my book. Nothing was overly salty, the rangoons where still crunchy, the soup almost burned my tongue and tasted really good, and the orange beef was plenty orange-y. I am a total chow mein snob and I would totally order the chow mein again, in a heartbeat. \n\nI am known as the QOL (Queen of Leftovers) because I always order way too much food for the amount of people trying to consume it. My buddy always complains about it because he has to consume all the leftovers in the end, but I didn't hear any whining from his end this time. It was also probably because there weren't that many leftovers to begin with. Just a little chow mein and some string beans, enough for lunch the next day. \n\n\nAll in all, I would totally order from this place again. Hopefully this coming Wednesday, I feel a Chinese takeout craving coming on.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

Casual attire for dining in this minimally decorated storefront restaurant.  The restaurant is ok for group dining sizes from single diners to modest family numbers, but could not handle larger group numbers.  Dining with children is ok.\n\nFood: A terrific variety of typical Hunan/Szechuan/Cantonese dishes will certainly satisfy most everybody's taste.  The Hot and Sour soup was exceptionally well prepared.  Same for dim sum appetizers.  House duck in brown sauce was perfectly crispy.  Lemon Chicken was crispy and very lemony!  Food portions were satisfactory.  Dinner with soup, appetizers, and entrees with rice, but without alcohol will average $20/person.\n\nBeverages:  The restaurant appears to be licensed for beer/wine and has an adequate selection of all the customary beers and soft drinks.\n\nService:  Servers were quiet, polite, and appropriately attentive.\n\nIf you're near Union Square and want excellent Chinese food fast and without the hike over the hill into Chinatown, you can dine in, take out, or call for delivery from these guys.", "author": "Brian F."}

And before City Chopsticks, the place I liked was down a few blocks. Well, City Chopsticks moves in and I hear (not 100% sure if it's true) that they are owned by the people who run my favorite place a few blocks down. Lazy Liz is happy. Lazy Liz would do a celebration dance if it didn't require so much effort. \n\nSince they have moved in, I have probably done take-out about 15 times. They only messed up my order once. I wasn't happy, but mistakes happen. I think I got string bean beef instead of my crispy sesame beef. Crispy sesame beef, by the way, is my favorite of their menu items. My BF only ever orders broccoli chicken, and he loves it. One of my favorite items to order from Chinese places is Walnut Prawns, and City Chopsticks' walnut prawns are okay. I have learned to ask for extra sauce because I feel that they were skimpy with the sauce in the past. I like the fact that you can order a small portion of hot and sour soup. Most places only have one size. \n\nSo, hey. I like City Chopsticks. I am glad they are there. I'm not Chinese, so I don't have grandma's cooking to compare this to. I have not traveled in China, and experienced fine Chinese cuisine, so I can't compare it to that either. Hell, I still haven't been to hipster's paradise, Mission Chinese Food. So, what I'm trying to get at, is that I'm comparing this to every other normal Chinese place. I say give City Chopsticks a try if you're looking for some good Chinese food in the neighborhood.

I wanted to give it a try being that I live around the corner. It is in the range of a 3-4 star but the service was a little slow. I ordered for pickup, they told me it would take 10 minutes, but I waited over 30 minutes for my order of three items. The place itself was not busy with active patrons, but they were super busy with online orders for both delivery and pickup. I ordered the following dishes:\n\nGarlic Shrimp\nSesame crispy beef\nKung Po Tofu\n\nThe garlic shrimp was well cooked and flavorful, but it was a little disappointing in size as well as how it was prepared. I love the silvers of garlic found in the dish that gave it a more pungent garlic taste. My togo box was only half filled. The broccoli that it came with was steamed and the shrimp was sitting on top of it. The broccoli would had been better if it was saut\u00e9ed with the shrimp to gain some flavor. The flavor profile of the steamed broccoli and saut\u00e9ed garlic shrimp didn't quite match. For the price, I would had expected a larger portion.\n\nThe sesame crispy beef was recommended. It was savory, but had a familiar taste of orange beef but not as spicy and pungent. I was both disappointed but surprised, I was disappointed because I could had just order orange chicken instead and I was also disappointed because it wasn't crispy, as the name suggested. \n\nThe kung po tofu wasnt as spicy as other kung pos I have had elsewhere. The tofu was pre-fried before cooking with the other ingredients. The tofu was over-fried giving it a more chewy and tough texture.

City Chopsticks is a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant when you're hungry for some fresh, authentic food that's not MSG-filled.  I am Chinese, so to say I've come across a lot of this cuisine is an understatement.  Tastes a lot like the real deal from Asia and I know I can bring my parents here without them yelling at me for bringing them somewhere crappy.\n\nMost importantly the food is clean, not greasy, looks fresh and comes super hot -- pretty sure I burned my tongue on a piece of broccoli.

So when I eat at Chinese restaurants, I tend to really judge hard on restaurants claiming to be the real deal. P.F.

I read Yelp reviews of excellent restaurants near my hostel and City Chopsticks had rave reviews.\n\nIt did not disappoint. My friend and I ordered the chicken fried rice and the black bean chow fun. It was satisfying to say the least.

I'm giving it four stars -- which I think is pretty good considering I took it to go and for them that really doesn't require a lot. I can't speak to the service but I was happy with the food. Another reason is the fact that we didn't get fortune cookies. I was looking for those! We got Orange Beef (nicely flavored - medium spice), General Tso's chicken (Really good, my girlfriend enjoyed it for sure) and also fried rice and spring rolls. Both were good.

The estimated time of delivery was 4:26 PM.  The actual delivery time was 3:55 PM.  At 22 minutes, that is about as fast as delivery can get.  There is a $2 delivery fee.  The delivery person was professional and polite.\n\nThe order minimum is relatively high ($20).\n\nMongolian Beef - This was a very good version of Mongolian Beef.  It was spicy.  The meat was tender.   There was a lot of beef.  The veggies were cooked properly.  They were still crisp.  The portion was generous.  I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/763yn3d\n\nGeneral's Chicken - The flavor was good.  It did not quite have the kick of the Mongolian Beef.  However, the breading was very hard.  The chicken itself was pretty hard also.  I ate it.  It was relatively enjoyable.  But the hardness did detract.  It was all chicken though.  Lol, there was no pesky broccoli getting in the way.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7o5svts\n\nSteamed Rice - The rice was cooked well.\n\nPacking - The food was neatly packed.  The rice was packed in a traditional Chinese carryout container.  The Mongolian Beef was also in a traditional container.  The General's Chicken was stored in an easy to reseal plastic container.  There was an extra one of these (without lid) that I used for a plate.  They also included the requested two sides of hot sauce.\n\nPrices - I thought the prices ran just slightly higher than average.  Plus, there was the $2 delivery fee.\n\n3 Sprite\n$ 3.75\n\n3 Coke\n$ 3.75\n\n2 Steamed Rice\n$ 2.50\n\nHunan General Tsuo's Chicken\n$ 8.95\n\nMongolian Beef\n$ 8.95\n\nSubtotal $27.90\nTax $2.37\nDelivery $2.00\nTotal $32.27 \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good.

My scallion pancakes had none (they were just plain, with no green anywhere to be seen, but had a good chewy texture and still tasted good with soy sauce). Saddest of all was that when I opened my soup, I saw a small fly floating on top. I've been camping before, and grew up with the phrase, \"extra protein,\" and since the soup was scalding hot, I decided there was no risk to my health and just set the fly aside.

(we're frequent visitors to town... and staying at the Nikko) The steady yet, relaxed stream of diners marked this as a non-hotspot neighborhood place. We're originally from New York so the \"hole in the wall\" feel was actually quite nice for us, especially since we're staying in Union Square, which can be a bit too touristy.\n\nWe ordered some very basic favorites and most made us happy. \nEgg rolls (as close to the kind we'd see in NYC as I've had in CA in the 10 years I've been out here), shumai dumplings (tasty but perhaps too large and dense), green onion pancake was lovely and delicate (more often that's a heavy greasy affair). \n\nWe had eaten lunch at 4pm so we weren't starving, but we didn't want to be looking for food at 10pm... so we didn't order much else.\n\nCombination Fried Rice, was very nice. It's the style with just a hint of soy sauce, but the rice is still white. A very good smattering of chicken, beef and about five medium sized shrimp. We really enjoyed how delicate it was.  My daughter doesn't dig spicy stuff so she'll always go for something like Chicken and Broccoli... which she did. And if we hadn't eaten lunch so late, I'd a have added one of the very wide selection of spicy dishes... \n\nAs it stands the Chicken and Broccoli was lovely. Delicately sauced, with crisp veggies and lots of chicken.  \n\nOther reviewers have commented that the food is not as greasy as Chinese food (especially a simple place like this) can be... and I would have to agree. We boxed up the remains and feel confident that when we go picking in a few hours... it won't be gelatinous...\n\nWe totally enjoyed it... and will return again.", "author": "Rosie S."}

When we had to pay we went up to the cashier and had the bill split between all of us (we were a party of 5). We found out after that each bill had a tip amount already included that was never expressed to us before payment, and they even asked us for more tips. When it was my friend's turn to pay she handed the lady a 100 dollar bill (the only bill in her wallet). Once the lady grabbed the bill she immediately hid it under the register and when my friend mentioned she didn't get the correct amount of change, the lady pulled out a 20 dollar bill saying \"this is what you gave me\". My friend thinking she had made a mistake agreed and left. While we were walking down the street she kept on thinking about it and realized she had really given her a 100 dollar bill. We went back in there and started demanding for my friend's money back. The waitress started calling my boyfriend \"baby\" telling him to calm down. We kept on demanding the money back and another waitress came up and mentioned there was a camera, we demanded to take a look to the footage. They asked us to wait 20 mins to watch the footage, we started waiting but we could tell that she was expecting us to get tired and leave. After 5 mins we demanded to watch the video and the lady started saying \"you won't be able to see the amount of the bill on the footage\" then she asked for our phone number and when we asked what she wanted it for she had no response. We made it clear we weren't leaving without the money. Then a man came out of the kitchen and started talking to her in a different language. Then she handed us 80 dollars.

She was very rude when I told her she had made a mistake, which made me believe I was the one who was wrong, and when I didn't fight back she reminded me I still had to tip (very rudely). We left but a few steps outside I checked and checked my wallet again and I was sure the lady had not given me my money correctly, so we went back and again both ladies were very rude, talking down to us and speaking in chinese like they were making fun of us. They made a big deal about calling the cops and checking the security camera, so we agreed that they should do that so we could solve the problem. They said they would and then they left us standing there and ignoring us for about five minutes, until we complained again. They started making excuses that in the security footage the bill probably could not be distinguished, until eventually we were there long enough so the manager came out. The manager spoke in chinese with the ladies, and our group perceived that the ladies admitted to the manager they had stolen my money and the manager said to just give it back. So after a lot of fighting I finally got back my money. The lady still made a sarcastic comment when she was giving it back. I had a plane to catch right after dinner, so it was very stressful and disrespectful. The food is not worth the trouble.

So why do you still maintain a picture of a nice lemon chicken when now you're just selling something that we could've bought at panda express? So is all their food terrible? No. But I don't like the attitude, there was no offer to give us something else. There are so many other places so we will not be returning.", "author": "Chris L."}

He was calling for directions, though, which I gave, and are pretty straightforward, yet he continued to yell at me about getting here unintelligibly for about 5 mins, until I finally hung up and hoped for the best on his arrival. He called again 5 mins later to say he had arrived, however he hadn't. After multiple frustrating calls and about 15 mins later, I got the food in hand. \n\nWhen I got back inside to my apt, though, I realized I'd been given someone else's order. Ugh. The last thing I wanted after that ordeal was to communicate with the driver again. I called the restaurant to tell them what happened and to say I didn't want my food, I just wanted a refund. I was then screamed at by the person in the restaurant who told me I needed to return the food and that I couldn't be refunded.  She then answered another call, from the driver I guess, and I had to listen to her scream at him for the mistake.  When she came back on the line, I explained that I did not want to have to speak to the driver again so I would leave the food outside my front door. She was ok with that, and I fear they were actually going to take the food to the person it was meant for.  Hope not. \n\nEmailed seamless about this and hope they will at least refund me for the order.", "author": "Denise M."}

Unfortunately, I could justify it after eating it. \n\nThere wasn't anything necessarily bad about it, just not anything that stood out that was really good. The pot stickers were quite dry and clearly overcooked. They tasted like frozen ones they threw in a sizzling pan. Not great, but not terrible. The beef, while fine, wasn't a marvel by any means and the chow mein....eh. \n\nFor a dinner it was okay, not great, but not revolting.

The hot and sour soup was ordered spicy and it was only a five on the hot scale out of ten. Kinda grey, vegetarian, not that I mind vegetarian but I prefer traditional, but it was not listed as such, and too much corn starch. The potstickers were an embarrassment. They were actually gyoza, thin skin and small. The meat was hard and made me think they were twice fried.Made me think they were left over from the lunch shift. Very disappointing. The dan dan was mild and okay but the noodles weren't handling the trip well. They were a little blobby and over cooked. It was delivery so I was expecting flaccid noodles but these were really kinda impotent. The leftovers turned into one mass of gravy starch. I'm a dan dan man and have had them done properly, so these were a bummer. Three out of ten. The hot and sour beef was more like a fair szechuan beef. Not tangy and not hot. A five, maybe six, nothing too hot. \nIt was delivered hot and on time. They forgot the hoisin for our mu-shi. I was out of hoisin for once and they dropped a single container by,  after we called but we were done eating by then. The mu-shi pork was lackluster, wet, flavorless and unremarkable.\nThe General Tso was good, but not enough to bring us back to this restaurant anytime soon.  \nIn a town that is finally breaking the Cantonese/American barrier this was a step backwards.

It looked like tempura & there was no hint of garlic in that dish. The chow fun was less than average. If you're a vegetarian, try the Kung pao veggies, you won't be sorry!", "author": "L P."}

I order an entree and two appetizers and a sprite. The total sounded rather high 41. but I was pleased at the overwhelming good reviews which half were probably written by the friends of the owners. They delivery really fast, about 30 minutes to a nice 5 star hotel. I her the knock at the door and hand the money and get the food. As I ask for the bill which was still in his hand and seemed reluctant to hand it over. He eventually did as soon as he gave it to me and my head was down looking at it as the cleaning lady was in my room straightening up I noticed and was alarmed how it was ONLY 32 dollars. I always feel like you should tip so I gave that guy 45 dollars. They made an extra $13 off of me. Food was decent BUT NEVER RECOMMENDED . When the cleaning lady was in there she asked and noticed how I got swindled and said she can call the doorman or bellhop or someone to stop him since it was uncalled for. I feel like it is unnecessary since what goes around comes around. I called to inform them and this guy picked up then switched the phone over to a girl. I told them to at least give me 5 dollars back just for the principal not for the money aspect. They said no and they did not rip me off but this receipt wouldn't lie. Unless you feel like getting scammed their are way too many chinese restaurants. I highly recommend yum yums. Fast quick and ten times better :)", "author": "Jen L."}

The extensive menu features a wide variety of Hunan and Mandarin-style dishes. The egg rolls are fresh, delicious, not too greasy or filling and make a wonderful start to the meal. Sui mai is delicious and satisfying, The walnut prawns were great as they were lightly battered and not overwhelmed by the sauce. Finally, the ma pau tofu was served in large portions in a sauce that was spicy, but not overpowering. If I have to sum up their cooking style in one word, it would have to be \"balance\". As I mentioned before, the staff is composed of the family proprietors who are going out of their way to not just run a business, but be good neighbors as well. You can dine in or take out. I plan to visit here many times in the future.", "author": "Randy S."}

The spicy beef noodle soup is amazing, general tsos tofu and beef fried rice are also awesome. Give them a try. You won't be let down.", "author": "R W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-14", "description": "At first I was pretty cautious about venturing to this place because it seemed like many of the restaurants that had been in this location were subpar at best, but after a few months past it's opening my boyfriend & decided to try it due to extreme laziness (its right down the street from where we live).  We have been going back weekly ever since.  It's simply GOOD Chinese food!  We love the chicken fried rice, crispy sesame beef and recently the chicken with green beans. And we've never been disappointed!  The prices aren't that great considering that one could get the same stuff for cheaper many more blocks away in Chinatown but the convenience is worth it. That and it's always tasty and the portions are decent. The staff seem nice but there's not much to write about there. It's definitely a place I'd recommend to anyone who wants to know if there's a decent Chinese joint in Lower Nob Hill!", "author": "Nix B."}

Chow Mein had all white meat chicken, not like the usual mystery pieces you get with chow mein.  Very good prices, especially for the City.", "author": "Nancy B."}

But the hours are great, the prices are cheap, you can get an order to go in less than 15 minutes and the people are nice. As long as you know which dishes to avoide and don't have too high expectations, it's a great little place.", "author": "Cherie D."}

I live in the neighborhood so I really wanted to like this place, especially since their other restaurant, King Ling on Geary is my go to place for Chinese take-out. The restaurant itself is quiet nice for in-dinning, but the food is very bland. So far I have only ordered the BBQ pork fried rice (which I was really looking forward to), spicy salt and pepper shrimp, and black pepper chicken. The shrimp and chicken were mediocre at best, but the BBQ pork fried rice was the worst I've ever had. It's like they cooked the rice and threw some pieces of BBQ pork and vegetables on top. I think I will go back to King Ling for my Chinese take-outs, especially when their food is better at a cheaper price, and the menu is pretty much the same. I believe there was a Ramen noodle place here before, and they didn't last too long. If City Chopsticks is going to be a success in this neighborhood, they better step up their game!", "author": "Duncan M."}
