We went at 1pm on a Monday, so there was a bit of a wait, but they seemed to be able to keep the line moving really well. they have a bunch of delicious-looking pastries in the front, and I was very tempted to get one. \n\nThe menu was a bit confusing, since the paper one was different than the one they had on the board, but it seemed that we could order from either one. \n\nI ordered the eggplant sandwich on whole wheat bread, which ended up being $8. The sandwich was delicious! The ingredients seemed really fresh, and the bread was really well toasted. I wish they had been a bit more clear about whether or not the inside of the sandwich would be hot, since I had assumed it would be, but then it was just room temperature. \n\nMy friend ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, which she said was really good as well! \n\nOverall, I really liked the food, but I felt like the interior wasn't that great.  There are three tables, and one small bar where four people can sit. The tables were slightly dirty, and the people working there were too busy to clean. I'd recommend getting your food to go, then eating it at the Civic Center park nearby.", "author": "Amara C."}

I was but a lone wolf seeking sustenance on a quick lunch break in civic center. Having found great sandwiches at Anderson bakery in the past I decided to go in, I paid attention to a number of coughs-sneezes I heard from behind the counter while waiting for my food, I thanked them for my meal, heard cashier say to chef 'your going home early'.... nothing clicked at the time but soon after I come down with a nasty flu, I'm talking about headache, stomach ache, can barely keep water down, fever, chills add in some freakish cold symptoms like a cough and sneezes.... sick like a dog for 1.5 weeks exactly, not call in sick and Netflix chill sick, sick like hanging on to life contemplating this journey of life while having fever dreams SICK.... \n\nI make a recovery, this muts back in the races ... lunch rolls around and head into Anderson... I see that chef in the back, tell me why she is talking to another employee saying how she got 'food poisoning' and was out for 5 days, couldn't eat anything had fever and chills-- BAM it all clicks for me like a bad cerebral sci-fi movie ..... naw homie food poising isn't contagious and you spread that like the pesto on my chicken sandwich!!\n\nNow let's examine the REAL issue here .... why did this employee of a food prep company feel the need to come into work while feeling sick... I would like Anderson to pay employees more or possibly give more sick time to avoid situations like that. To be fair, maybe it was just a bad employee who abuses these things already given by Anderson? Idk I never worked there to know.\n\nMy review is 2 Stars, would have got maaaaybe 4 had I not contracted the dog flu (what I'm calling it) from their chef", "author": "John O."}

I've lived down the block for a year so I figured as I move to a new neighborhood, I might as well finally try this place. After all, I'm not at risk to get addicted to a bakery if I'm 2 miles away, right?\n\nI ordered a tomato, egg and cheese on an English muffin and a large coffee. With tax, this came out to $7 which seems more than fair. They got my order together quickly and within 5 minutes I was chowing on my sandwich. Some things to know about me: I'm from New England where making a good breakfast sandwich is an art so as a result, I'm pretty picky about them. The one from Andersen was....meh. My main gripe is the kind of cheese used. It seemed like it was American cheese which is a big no-no. The egg was one of those weird scramble patties which is disappointing. They did give a nice slice of tomato and the English muffin it was on was definitely homemade and delicious. The coffee was fine and cheap, especially compared to the Starbucks across the plaza.\n\nThis place definitely has regulars which adds to an interesting vibe. During my visit they seemed to know on a first-name basis everyone who came in which was nice. Their customer service seemed to also be great. A woman mentioned to one of the employees that her breakfast sandwich was burnt and they offered to make her a new one but she declined. They brought her out a free pastry anyway to make up for it. I thought it was very thoughtful and sweet.\n\nOverall, it was fine. I wish I had gotten a pastry but eh, healthy eating. If you're in the area before anything else is open (they open at 6), it's worth a stop but if you have other options (like La Boulangerie de SF or Corridor Cafe), go to those", "author": "Carrie W."}

I find her disrespectful and rude to certain customers such as me. I've been there several times as it is close to where I work. I feel this filipino lady has bias on certain customers. She is much more friendly on the repeated customers who wear suits. Today I felt disrespected by her service. I was waiting patiently in line as she was impatiently and giving an attitude training the new staff who was trying to learn. They were serving a customer in front of me. Then later that filipino lady assisted this guy right away who came in minutes after me and was not even in line. She served him and took his payment as I was still patiently waiting in line. I could tell he was a repeated customer by their interactions. She was really friendly to him. But when it came my turn, she greeted me with a dark, unfriendly face. She has always been horrible. Anyways, I will not go back anymore because she is very disrespectful to certain customers and only choose customers she likes to be friendly with. I like Andersen Bakery's bread, but this would be the branch I would not go to again because of horrible customer service time and time again by this filipino lady.

They serve Peerless coffee, which is okay, but I wish they served something a little better tasting. The staff is friendly enough, but I wish they were a little nicer/happier/more interesting to talk to.", "author": "Basil B."}

Told her it wasn't what I was expecting and that I didn't want it then she stopped talking to me. So if you want watered down warm coffee served with an awful attitude go there.", "author": "fabrice a."}

All the locals were suggesting chains when we wanted a small little breakfast place. Then we stumbled upon this place! Had a cheap excellent breakfast with pastry and bread galore! You local people should really be supporting this place!", "author": "Andrew S."}

VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  and of course it's not worth it for me to walk back to exchange it...but i shouldn't have to even do that since they should've looked at the ticket more closely.  pay attention people!", "author": "Vic S."}

It looked clean inside and the food display caught my attention, quite an assortment of breads and pastries.  I ordered a 6\" birthday cake for my 1 year old granddaughter - the chocolate dream cake with whipped cream frosting.  My granddaughter thought it was tasty.  She ate some, had it on her hair and face, just having a good old time with it.  The cake was moist, light and not too sweet.  Definitely liked the whipped cream frosting.  I also bought a 9 grain bagel, it was ok.  I'll be returning to try other things.", "author": "mitzi s."}

Soup was ok, nothing special and the salad consisted of lettuce and ground cheese, real I hope, and chicken. Glad I asked for dressing or they would have forgetten. They didn't give me a fork either. Now some of this stuff is understandable in a new restaurant, but a salad with only lettuce and cheese?? Give me a break. I will not be going back.", "author": "Scott M."}
