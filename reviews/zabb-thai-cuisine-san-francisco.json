Their pad thai, yellow curry, and coconut fried rice is amazing!! Although it is a bit pricey, the richness of the flavor is truly amazing, and that's what makes it worth it. \n\nCame here at around 6pm on a Monday and it's surprisingly empty. Our server was courteous and quick, and our food came almost as soon as we ordered. \n\nI would highly recommend coming here if you're ever craving Thai food!", "author": "Jasmin C."}

Calamari and appetizers was kind of expensive, just like the price of the fried rice/pad thai/curry  The calamari was nothing special.\n\nWe ordered the mango fried rice. I just want to leave a review for that dish. Chicken was not seasoned well, tasted kind of bland compared to the fried rice. Mango was HARD. Def not ripe and def ruined our hopes of luscious sweet mango chunks in the fried rice. That was why we opt for the mango instead of the coconut...its supposed to be in season!\n\nWe ordered the pad kee mao as well. It was ok. For the price, you'd expect a nicer location. For a whole in the wall ambiance, it could be a bit cheaper.\n\nTheres a lot of to go orders the whole time we were there. I guess some people must've really liked it. \u200d\n\nFor us, we've had better. Maybe we'll come back for the coconut fried rice. Btw we came here bc pampangoena (?) was closed so we went to the closest restaurant with decent reviews.", "author": "Inez J."}

There are several things going for the restaurant--they deliver the food quickly inexpensively, the flavors are approachable.  \n\nHowever, the meals churned out here taste like they have a common pool of sauces drenching pre-cooked meat. The flavors are frontal and basic. Not the complex, punchiness I have come to expect of Thai food.\n\nTo be fair,  I don't think they use much MSG or other additives (if they use it at all).

It was pretty spicy, but hey I asked for spicy, denoted on their menu as . The noodles were great! My problem with pad kee mow sometimes is that the noodles will stick together in clumps and won't get sauced properly, but these didn't come out like that! Or some other places like will have a bunch of broken noodles so that the noodles are really short and you can't really pick it up with a fork, but these aren't like that either! They're really good!

Well, There are two thai restaurants on Cortland but one close at 6p and the other only specialized in noodles. The only 3 small complaints was they didn't give us any utensils , napkins or offer any sauce or spice for our Togo. I didn't realized it till I got home looking for chopsticks, forks,etc. there was nothing but the food I order. They usually deliver base off yelp but when calling he said he can't deliver since he didn't have enough help which I understand and last the crispy basil chicken was a bit salty. Overall the rest was surprisingly pretty good. Everyone actually enjoyed it. 3 star but the guy was really nice and there was really only him and one lady working there so it's ok . 4 star for now. Unless it happens again than I will have to update the review. Everyone or restaurants does have their days that doesn't always turn out right.  Besides it was my first time there.

I ordered the sweet and sour tofu with a side of brown rice. Food came in fairly quickly and I started eating right away. Right off the bat, I could tell it wasn't the mainstream of sweet and sour I was expecting. The dish had lots of veggies to it which I'm fine with but it didn't really have amazing flavors.

My only regret was portion size, being on the smaller side, and that's the only reason for four stars. Otherwise, excellent.\n\nLet me start with the fact that this visit was totally random. We just drove up north to escape the heat in the valley, and ended up in the city of SF. Driving up north on Mission St., I've noticed an available parking spot - right across the street from Zabb - and our choice has been made.\n\nZabb looks very much inviting as you step in, it's well lit and spacious. We were the only dining party and it felt good. Our server was courteous. We ordered coconut milk soup Tom Kha Kai $8.99 with beef $1 and Red curry $8.99 with beef $1, plus two brown rice $2 each.\n\nBoth Tom Kha Kai and Red curry arrived freshly cooked and just right. What I mean by that is neither dish seemed to have been pre cooked or simply heated up, nor were they overly salty, as is often the case. Everything has been freshly made.\n\nTom Kha arrived in authentic ceramic bowl with plenty of fresh veggies (not your usual canned mini corn), including uncommon and tasty kinds, like saut\u00e9ed eggplant and cabbage. Very flavorful broth and not overwhelming its individual ingredients.\n\nRed curry arrived in refreshing sauce with coconut milk, eggplant, carrots, bell paper, topped with bamboo shoots and sprinkled with fresh basil, served in contemporary white ceramic bowl.\n\nBrown rice individually portioned in metallic bowls with lids. Clean white plates and cups were also set out for us, and two glasses of water. The service was good and attentive.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal, and after it had been finished, we've spent some time just relaxing and chatting. I bookmarked Zabb for future visits.

We TRIED to order the Thai green tea, but that order went wrong.\nA nice Thai girl attempted to take our drink order, but she just didn't understand us much. She had to grab the chef, turned into waiter, to take the order.. The Thai tea didn't come out green, but we didn't want to bother them much, so we kindly accosted.  \nThe pork larb was really salty.. But it had great flavor minus the salt! On top of that, they handed us the larb without any veges on the side. Can you imagine an already overly salted dish that I couldn't cut the salt content with fresh greens? That sucked. When I finally got the waitress' attention, she didn't understand what I was asking for and had to grab the chef/waiter. He Said they ran out of lettuce and had cabbage only. Sure. I was desperate. It kinda worked nicely with the larb. The bittery crunch from the cabbage combined with the minced beef paired well. I wanted to ask for fresh basil as well, but I gave up. \nThe eggplant basil was just as salty as the larb, if it wasn't as salty, it would have been a 4 star dish. Great flavor, thick sauce that can coat grains of rice... The duck curry wasn't salty... But lacked that \"oomph\" that I look for when I eat curry. It tasted watered down and the consistency wasn't as thick as the eggplant dish. AND, the pineapples in there made the dish oddly sweet.. I couldn't coat my rice in the curry soup.. I pretty much slurped the dish up. \nUnfortunately, this wasn't a hit for me. I should have asked the chef to go light on the salt, I did come upon a review or two with the same complaint.

What could have been harder to swallow?? The horrible customer service. \n\nWhen my mother and I attempted to comment on the papaya salad, the waiter came at us sideways! He quickly stated, \"You don't know what Thai food is. You don't know what it's supposed to taste like.\" Umm FYI, I frequent MANY Thai restaurants from the Bay to LA. It's frankly my favorite kind of food. I think I'd know what Papaya salad is supposed to taste like, or what it's not supposed to taste like!! \n\nMy biggest qualm was with the service. I don't understand how they have so many stars... Quick to blame the customer for subpar food quality and taste. Big ass red flag for me. Never ever coming back. Ever. \n\n***Plot twist: The server comes on Yelp to talk more crap about how we don't know what Thai food should taste like, and how we were rude. Let me just say: \n\n1) Why would the first sentence of your comment include an insult toward my mother? I see that you changed \"ugly mother\" into \"unhappy face mom\". Not only is it classless and tasteless to comment on someone's mother's appearance just because you're unhappy with a review, it is simply childish. \n\n2) My mother first ASKED you about the tomato being old. From that point on, you opened your mouth and ranted on and on senselessly about how we didn't know what papaya salad would taste like, and that some Thai food places make salad one way, and others, another way. \n\nJust to be clear, the tomato was OLD. We understand that you use a mortar to smash the tomato. But if it tastes like its old, we have the right to simply question whether it is or not. SECONDLY, instead of simply addressing our concern with courtesy and service, you turned the entire situation on your customer. Do you have any idea what a quality restaurant is? \n\n3) You never apologized like you said you did in your comment. You never attempted to mitigate the situation. All you did is pull the classic \"if the customer doesn't like it, it's because something's wrong with them.\" Instead, you should change your mentality and learn from what your customers have to say.\n\nYou even say, \"How am I supposed to know what you like?\" For starters, when we tell you that the papaya salad is lacking spice and flavor, your first step should be to take the dish back and adjust it. \n\n4) You say your food is good for everyone... What kind of statement is that? There are many reviews stating your food is bland, subpar, just \"ok\" tasteless, and the like. Like I said, it's beyond me how you have 4 stars-- your review is only a glimpse into what service is like. I hope after reading this more people will see what they're getting themselves into, and keep away from the joke you call a restaurant.\n\nAs for my reviews, it takes a lot for me to write a negative review. Congratulate yourself, at least you have some kind of accomplishment to celebrate. \n\nP.S. I didn't comment on the foul smelling odor that slaps you in the face when you walk in. So fix that shit, too.\n\n3-26-16\nZabb Thai's server just edited his review for the THIRD time. He obviously has thought twice about the insulting comments he left about my mother.

I read reviews and really wanted to try the tom yum noodle soup and larb gai.\n\nI even ordered the green Thai iced tea drink that I wanted to try. She seemed hesitant.  No thank you either.  Although the transaction was not rude either.  Am giving plus one star for the atmosphere-seems that a lot of people may have liked it although it must be hard to have two cooks with maybe about 10 waiting plates-wonder everything cooked to order versus some items maybe prepared ahead to quicken the process without sacrificing quality and taste and chasing customers away... also although the drink is about 16oz (uS kiddie cup sized) and mostly ice and cream-not enough tea for $2.50, I thought it was okay in tea strength and taste.

We ordered two dishes: Coconut Soup with Seafood and the Basil Pork. The soup was good, but the Basil Pork was lacking in basil AND flavor. Perhaps its because we ordered the dish \"mild,\" but mild does not mean NOT spicy or NO flavor. Or NO basil ***angry face here***\n\nWell, I'm never one to waste food - especially when I can't motivate myself to pack a lunch every day. So I had a second round of Basil Pork on Monday for lunch and surprise, surprise! It tasted better as leftovers. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but it happened. So I'm telling you.\n\nFor a restaurant with only 3 parties, the service was terrible. No checking in or water refills -- and good luck if you want to get a box or your check at the end of the meal. So, here's my tip: ask for some spice, eat your leftovers, and bring your own bell for service.", "author": "Jane L."}

Ordered the Tom Kha (listed as coconut soup) with tofu, the pumpkin curry with prawns, and the pineapple fried rice with prawns. +$1 for prawns which is fine with me! \n\nEasy to order on the phone. They just asked me for my phone number and order. Food was already done by the time I got there. Its a spot on the corner and there was a full on \"garage\" sale going on next to it by this little old lady. \n\nTheir pineapple fried rice was the weirdest I've ever seen and their curry is VERY watery. Just as watery as the soup. I saw that they labeled the curry and soup containers which I thought was kind of silly but then realized they probably did that on purpose knowing their curry was the same consistency as the soup. Tom Kha was very good. I've never had a bad one though. Flavor of the curry was good except it was just too watery and only four pieces of pumpkin.\n\nI feel like the total came out to be a lot too like $37 for three items? I don't know actually I ordered five items at Lers Ros and it was $70 so I guess its on par with other thai places.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

We arrived promptly at 6pm and our table was ready.\n\nThe food: we ordered a variety of dishes and appetizers. We started off with spring rolls, crispy tofu, and lucky bags. These were really good while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. I had the spicy basil crispy chicken and asked for extra spicy. Just to let you know, their level of spiciness isn't enough so ask for some chili powder for that extra kick. I like my thai food extra spicy! The chicken was really good. I also tried the paid thai and the pad see ew which are pretty popular dishes. I recommend ordering them. Their portions are also really large and a few of us had leftovers.\n\nService: Ben (the owner) is a very hard working guy. He was doing everything from helping out in the kitchen (his wife is the cook) to refilling our waters. He was also busy keeping up with all of our orders. He's also very nice and when we mentioned it was our friend's birthday, he gave him a free glass of thai iced tea and ice cream at the end. Also in the past when we ordered delivery, he would also make the deliveries.\n\nPrice: You'll be pleasantly surprised with the prices here. They are extremely reasonable and our group spent under $20 per person after taxes and gratuity.\n\nLocation: We picked this place because it was conveniently located.

I wanted the coconut noodle soup which they don't offer during dinner and so I said to my hubby, if they don't have the coconut noodle soup then i'm going to leave. I think they picked that up and when they took my order, I asked them if they have it and they said they can make it for me. \n\nI would have been so pissed if they didn't make it for me but they did and now I'm super satisfied. The soup itself was a bit sour which I wasn't expecting but it was good none-the-less. The noodles are like pho so if you like pho and coconut, this is the choice for you. I don't understand how they can survive with just a few (2-3) patrons every time i pass by.

Decided to grab a quick bite.\n\nVery typical fare when trying out a Thai restaurant. Similar decor as most places off of Mission with not much dressing and just a simple dine in experience. We went around 12:30 which would be expectant of a lunch rush. Being the only diners in doesn't always fare well but they did seem to be busting out quite a bit of to-go orders.\n\nI had tried the Coconut Milk Soup and the Pra-ram lunch special with Fried Tofu and Brown Rice. Abundance of food choices at about $7.99/special, this is solid selection for Thai food. The Coconut Milk had a mild coconut taste, but I usually prefer it to be a little bit creamier. Personal preference. The dish is served in about four squares, each giving just a little bit of a taste of everything. I wish the serving sizes were just a little bit bigger but at the price, is not such a bad deal.

The food is kind of a 3, but generally I like the owners and their commitment to the community. So...my 4 is with this note in mind. I'd normally give it a 3 based on food. \n\nI work in the Excelsior, and was running between meetings. Hectic workday, and I was looking for a place to get food really quickly so I can run to the next thing. I'd been meaning to try Zabb for a while, and ordered to-go, on my way back. Calling in was fine - I had an issue when I called it Zabb Thai rather than Zabb Cuisine. I was confused. The person on the other line was confused.\n\nUpon basic yelp search, I saw that the Pumpkin Curry was touted as being delicious, so I decided to try that with chicken. Had to order rice on the side, because the curry doesn't come with rice. Which. Always confuses me. What person has curry with no rice or starch? Just drink it like a soup? Odd.\n\nThe food was just ok. The curry was flavorful, but many items in there over cooked. The pumpkin (kabocha!) was a bit dry, which is confusing because it's sitting in a batch of curry. Maybe it was cooked to death. The chicken was super thinly sliced which is normally good...but it was super over cooked as well. Maybe if I had gotten it fresh and it didnt have the carry-over heat from treking back to my office. \n\nThe rice itself...was pretty bad. It was split and overly hard. Thank god the curry was there to moisten it. I'm not sure if its Zabb's fault though. Rice in general has been really bad (not just here, but purchased outside too. Don't buy those 50lbs of rice any time soon!).", "author": "Lily W."}

Nevertheless, we are not fans of any Thai restaurants that are in Daly City and we wanted to try something different than Osha in Glen Park. What a diamond in the rough! =)\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Location isn't greatest\n-- Parking isn't greatest (typical of San Francisco)\n-- Park on Mission or on the side residential streets\n-- Metered parking on some of the side streets (nice when it's FREE)\n-- Not busy at all on a Monday night =)\n-- Menu is very detailed and lists SPICY (don't order if you don't like spice!)\n-- Service is pretty relaxed but still attentive when you need it\n-- Beef salad was very flavorful, traditional and spicy! (recommend)\n-- Spicy string beans with chicken were packed with flavor and a bit \"wetter\" than other versions I've had (still recommend)\n-- Chicken green curry was creamy, spicy and YUMMY (recommend)\n-- Fried Banana and ice cream was sweet enough but didn't like the sprinkles (still recommend)\n-- Glad to have met one of the owners and make some small talk\n-- Bill didn't break the bank!\n\nLuckily we found parking only a block away. Again, the area isn't the best but I was happy to see that it wasn't busy. I almost prefer \"Mom and Pop\" Thai restaurants because their flavors are a bit more authentic and true.\n\nB E E F  S A L A D: This was the 1st beef salad that reminded me of the very first time I had some. Normally when I order beef salad there's lettuce, this came with cabbage. The flavors contained so much depth mixing the freshness of the beef with lime and chili. The spice level was spot on, not too much but enough to say hello. It was such a fresh yet meaty dish to start off with. I definitely was looking forward to the rest of the meal.\n\nS P I C Y  S T R I N G  B E A N S: This is a more recent favorite dish for us to order. It has spicy in the name so you know the heat is coming. Surprisingly it wasn't as spicy as the beef salad. Still great flavor and it had more of a sauce versus a dry fried string bean. \n\nG R E E N  C U R R Y: Probably one of my biggest complaints when ordering green curry is that it's not very thick or creamy, it's watery. I don't like watery curry at all. I was very happy to see the thickness and creaminess of our chicken green curry. It wasn't as spicy as expected so I asked for some prick nam blah and wow it definitely heated me up. I loved spice mixed with chicken, bell peppers and eggplant.\n\nD E S S E R T: The fried banana is in balls almost like donuts. The dough wasn't too much but definitely on the donut-ish side of things. They topped it with honey and sprinkles. I like that the honey added a nice sweetness but the sprinkles were kind of annoying. The coconut ice cream was great and it wasn't super hard. Overall it was a nice dessert to end a spicy meal.\n\nAs of late, I've kind of been getting over the more modern Osha in Glen Park and have been looking for a more authentic and traditional Thai restaurant. I've definitely found this in Zabb. During my conversation with the owner, I asked what Zabb meant and he told me that it meant spicy and delicious in Thai. We also talked about Thailand and other things. It was nice to learn something about the restaurant. I'll definitely be back in the future to try more of their menu.", "author": "Daniel D."}

Very stinky.  And today I had the lunch combo with basil beef and spring rolls.  The spring rolls were a bit mushy inside, and the beef was tough, tasted like soy sauce, and was missing that rich basil aroma.\n\nSo, while I'm glad I have a low priced Thai place nearby, I definitely can't recommend taking a special trip to the Excelsior to eat this average food.", "author": "Rocco B."}

Tonight Zaab was slammed, so I had to pick-up.  It was great to see such a nice biz owner having a busy night.   It was just owner Ben (sp?), who was cooking and helping w/ tables, one cook, and one server working a place of 40 or so seats.  And I didn't realize the place had scored a 100 (!) on their SF Restaurant Health score.  Totally appeals to my OCD tendencies to clean a kitchen till it's sanitary fresh.\n\nVery cool to watch them make my Tom Ka Gai soup to order.  We ordered spicy string beans, but ordered it mild, which was good b/c it had just enough spice for the kids and husband.  And the mango fried rice was loved by all, even the kid who doesn't care for anything w/ rice (even though she is Asian-go figure).  Also ordered the standard thai dish of satay chicken, and even that seemed exceptional tasty tonight.  \n\nI've lived in SF for 20+ years, and had many a Thai dish.   Zaab is as good as any Thai restaurant I've been too in SF, including Osha and Marnee Thai.  And pooh to those that say the neighborhood is \"not so nice\".

(I can't help if I love them!)  The servers were extremely nice and welcoming and initially sat us near the door, but since I pointed out that I was freezing they let me choose my seating in a blocked off area.  Thank you.  \n\nWe split the spring rolls, chicken satay, green papaya salad, and pad thai with veggies.  The spring rolls were typical deep fried goodies.  Anything deep fried is essential in my book.  The peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay was thick and creamy like chunky PB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KLUiOz5L75XeDf_Kaltjxw?select=DqicP4URLEfZVzJTEMLtTg).  It was delicious and I smothered the leftovers on my pad Thai.  I expected the veggies in my pad Thai to be bean sprouts and shredded carrots, but no.  The vegetables were large broccoli florets and carrots, mushrooms, tofu, etc.  It was quite substantial and very tasty.  Not the best pad in the world Thai, but very good nonetheless.  I could stop eating it.  \n\nWhat stood out to me, and gets its own paragraph, was the papaya salad.  I always compare papaya salad to Keo's in Honolulu.  This papaya salad was probably the best I've ever had.  It's small, but full of flavor.  And the presentation is beautiful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KLUiOz5L75XeDf_Kaltjxw?select=NvWVm0LX-JHNeuXPHTHSHQ).  The green beans and tomatoes in it were unexpected, but a pleasant surprise.  The lime dressing was amazing and perfectly tart.

They also stopped serving the 2 item lunch special on the weekends, which kinda sucks because I don't really eat much so I usually opt for small portions. I have tried many items from their menu such as the pad see ew, pad kee Mao, pad Thai, duck noodle soup (my favorite thing on the menu but a bit oily), the lucky bags appetizers, chicken satay skewers (meat is pretty moist), papaya salad (one of my other favorites), basil beef, larb, the green curry and lastly the Thai GREEN tea (one of my favorite drinks but they sure put a lot of ice) . Everything I've tried there is really good in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this Thai place to my friends. However, I feel like it's so unknown and underrated due to the location of this restaurant. It's not really in the heart of mission so people usually just walk by without knowing about this gem. Hopefully business continues to grow for this place!", "author": "Cori N."}

It's not usually a busy crowd, which is sad because it's so good! More people need to know about it if they live near the excelsior so it can continue! \n\nThe servers and cooks are super friendly. The prices are reasonable for the portions you get. We always start off with a green papaya salad, which they serve in this cute edible bowl made of crispy dough and topped with yummy sauce and peanut bits. It's super refreshing and good appetizer to share on a date. My favorite dish is the curry noodle, because it's a combo of the two main plate options: curry with rice, or a noodle plate. Best of both worlds, just thinking about it again is making my mouth water. All of it's good, though. My girlfriend got the pumpkin curry which was really tasty, and you get to choose the meat, prawns, or tofu for all the dishes. \n\nFor dessert, the fried banana ice cream is so delicious! \n\nIf you are in the excelsior, give this place some love.

One day afternoon i wanted to \"high tea\" around my house. I wanted to try something new and i went to this thai place. Okay, the restaurant was empty but i understand because it is not lunch hours or any busy time. We both order the lunch special, it comes with entree, rice, pad thai, and salad. I didn't remember what we ordered but they were okay. \n\nThen i went there a few times after that and i guess they were all okay. BUT I AGREE WITH ALL THE YELPERS THAT COMMENTED ON THIS RESTAURANT, THEIR PAD THAI SUCKS ****.\n  \nI never hate it. Not until today. I was so glad that i havent wrote a review until today. Everything changes until today.\n\nIt is actually a short story, so i will start.\n\nIt was a great evening and i just wanted some thai iced tea. I went with my friend. She only had credit and debit cards on her, so this is the conversation:\n\nmy friend: what is the minimum charge for credit card?\n\nmean old waitress: 10 dollars\n\nmy friend: oh ok. So it wont work if i only want thai iced tea?\n\nmow: NO YOU CANT.\n\n then we were looking for cash in her bag and wallet. there was only a dollar in the wallet but it was her special dollar with some kind of special meaning. So we were like i guess we couldnt get anything.\nME: we dont have any cash.\n\nmow(semi- whispering): I just saw you have money, you just dont want to buy it.\n\nSO YOU HAVE BEEN STARING AT ME THE WHOLE TIME!!! MY FRIEND SAID SHE FELT LIKE SOMEONE HAD BEEN SPYING ON HER WALLET.\n\nME: BUT WE REALLY DONT HAVE ANY MONEY AND SHE ONLY HAS A DOLLAR.  whispering: Just leave.\n\nwe were about to get up and she said again\n\nmow: If you dont want it, then i guess next time.\n\nme thinking: Oh okay lady, i will never be back ever again even if i have been starving for days and about to die of starvation and dehydration.\nThere wont be a next time for you.\n\nMy final thought: Food is okay. The waiter before was so much nicer than this \" thing\".  This was the worst service i have ever had in my experience of costumer service. I feel like i was being watched  the whole time in that freaking restaurant.  Waitress is extremely mean. Cant believe they still let her to be the waitress, i hope she will get changed after this review, maybe not, but this will be a good opinion to consider thinking about it. Oh yea, and they were talking about us in thai while we were still in the restaurant. i guess they dont know what  respect is.

It may sound crazy but I do not like it when places mix the tea before serving. I love the presentation when the ice, tea, and cream is separated so perfectly. When going to other Thai restaurants they look at me as if I were insane for asking them to not mix the tea and leave it separated. It makes all the difference on your pallet when drinking it in! Besides their perfect Thai Tea, their curries are out of this world! I love to get the curry noodles with your choice of meats, poultry or seafood. I get it with prawns and crab. It's heavenly! Also the Satay is so tender and the condiments that come with it, amazing and so fresh. There presentation is impeccable for being a local neighborhood spot.

It started off nicely, the thai tea wasn't bad, and the soup we had was pretty tasty and sour. \n\nThen came the angel wings (they were chicken wings stuffed with silver noodles inside). The presentation of the wings were nice... and then I took a bite out of the chicken wing. and notice it was cold and pink inside. Then I realized the chicken was still frozen and raw inside but brown and fried on the inside. \n\nSo we sent back the wings and got a new batch.

The Thai tea was yummy and large, not over-filled with ice compared to many other restaurants. \n\nI would say if you want to stay and dine, it does look like a friendly atmosphere with parking available and the 14, 49 bus stops right in front. \n\nHOWEVER, this is where I would give no stars to, the pad thai was TERRIBLE. I ordered it with shrimp and they were not close to fresh. It tasted old and rotten. To complete the lack of sauce and seasoning, the noodles were over-cooked and I ate something that tasted like pieces of paint. I had to spit it out and did not finish the noodles. Literally, there were pieces of paint-like particles that I nearly choked on. DISGUSTING~ worst pad thai ever!!!!!!!\n\n\nMy boyfriend's entree was better, but not by much.

The sauce on the Pad Kii Mao isn't as good, and tastes kinda like ketchup mixed with chili. There seems to be a lack in 'authenticity' of their Southeast Asian dishes, and reminds me of an American-fusion place.

It's crispy just the way I like it with just the right amount of flavor. Not too overwhelming.\n\nPad Thai: not bad, but not great either. They use a thinner noodle than other Thai places, but nonetheless it was decent. They put slices of  carrots in it after it was cooked. I found this to be rather odd.\n\nNote: the brown rice could have been better. A LOT BETTER. It was very chunky.

Like most people, I mentally/emotionally empathize with their orgasmic gastronomical experience.  Who hasn't done this, right?\n\nI wasn't really in the mood for appetizer but saw that they had calamari on the menu.  Calamari is my Achilles heel; gotta try it at any new restaurant.  Well, the batter was not greasy and had a pleasurable crunch to it.  Unfortunately, the actual calamari was not fresh and to make matters worse, the sauce was really subtle.  On most occasions, this would be a plus, not this time!  I was hoping the subtlety sweet and spicy had the same coating effect as the store bought thai sauce to hide the sub par calamari.

Our water was ALWAYS refilled, they checked on our rice reserves during dinner, and were very attentive and nice (although in a silent way; our waiter barely spoke).\n\nWe had the lucky bag appetizers (picked on name alone) and it was nicely executed; the sweet/spicy sauce was not overpowering and the little bags were perfect bit-sized balls of shrimp/pork/spices.  It was crispy without being greasy.\n\nFor dinner we had the avocado curry with chicken.  Interesting, huh?  It was a perfect blend of spicy (jalapeos) and creamy.   We also had the pad with beef; it was nothing to write home about, but still very good.  The veggies were not soggy or pre-frozen and the noodles were not overcooked or stuck together (where you have to cut your portion off the serving plate...that drives me nuts)\n\nAlthough the food isn't necessarily the greatest, it's a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and the service was absolutely amazing.

Rice (jasmine or brown) is an extra $1.50/person, as is tea - which struck me as high, considering how inexpensive the entrees were. Then again, the brown rice was perfectly steamed/toasted perfectly for a full, nutty flavor and with such low entree prices, the meal total for 2 was still ridiculously low - and that included a fresh-squeezed carrot juice for my handsome, yet sickly man-friend.\n\nA partially open kitchen displayed some awesome high flame action and the glassware is really nice in an understated, modern way.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? No fresh spring rolls - only fried and that, admittedly, bums me out way more than it ought to. I'm just like that I guess.", "author": "Joanna R."}

The pumpkin curry should be called saucy curry, they were really stingy with the pumpkin and that made me really sad.

It was a Vietnamese Joint, and pretty damn popular one at that, despite a hidiously grimey and uninviting interior (the food was much better than the ambiance).\n\nBut this review isn't about the previous eatery, it's about Zabb, the location's new tenant.  Talk about a face-lift.    The new owners have turned an eyesore into a simple but very pleasant and inviting space.\n\nWe've tried a number of the dishes and so far so good.  One item I've never encountered before in a Thai place is the \"Lucky Bag\" appetizer.  It's really tasty and worth trying.  The spicy Eggplant is was excellent, and the Pad Kee Mao also passably tasty.  The coconut soup was good as was the Panang Curry, although I'll try the chicken version next time over the beef.  If you are a heat fiend, as in Chili spice, you have to convince the staff that you're up to the task.  They've made the deliberate ,and my opinion, smart decision to keep the heat factor low until they get a read of their clientelle.  Hey if you want to kill yourself, they do stock the fresh thai chili's, which you'll have to ask for.\n\nThe Manager Ben and his staff, including the cook are super, super friendly.  After a brief chat the first time I ate there, Ben remembered my name when I returned with my wife in tow and also what I had ordered  (\"No pad kee mao this time, ok?\", said with a smile).  Even if this may be partially an attempt to retain return customers, it can't help but make one feel good.\n\nThis restaurant is yet another example of the good food values available in this city . Our initial heartbreak at the closing of a restaurant we frequented almost weekly  is on the mend.  Zabb's staff will get to know us very well indeed.   Based on value for the whole experience I give it four stars (food alone is nearer 3 1/2 stars).  \n\nThey now take credit cards and they're working on the beer/wine license.

My boyfriend and I come here frequently when we are looking for a slightly more upscale respite from taquerias and we always leave with bright smiles inspired by happy stomachs.  It does seem that the portions are a bit small for the price compared to other Thai favorites in the city, but I certainly hope that this place will thrive and encourage other new restaurants and businesses to open in the area.", "author": "L B."}

I bring the take out containers back for refills because I'm a conservation freak and they don't treat me like I'm a Martian. The folks are friendly and fast every time. The spot is elegant and welcoming but also fits in our neighborhood for the most part. It might be a little less affordable than the rest of our dinner spots, but it's great for lunch.", "author": "r. k."}
