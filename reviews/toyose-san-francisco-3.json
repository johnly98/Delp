Majority of circle of friends rave about this place. Yes, it's good, yes I'd come back again but it's not my go-to spot. \n\nThe staff here, I feel like is a hit or miss. I had pretty good experience here in the past, until recently for a friends birthday dinner. There's these 2 waitresses, waitress one was being overly rude! she literally wouldn't let us take another table behind us for the rest of our party, their was 12 of us. Mind you, my friend made a reservation a day or two prior letting them know how many people are coming. We were literally ready to leave after the second time we asked if we really couldn't take that table and there weren't even customers behind us! I'm pretty sure everyone who's been here, we all know how small the inside of this resto is. You can't make 12 heads fit in a table that sits 7. After that, waitress two comes to take our orders and for some reason she too wanted to give us an attitude and kept rushing us. Seems like some of their staffs, don't like accommodating a big group like us into their business.\n\nI don't get why their kimchi fried rice is so greasy, i like it and i usually get this with their kimchi pancake and soup (which makes it less heavy). I also enjoy their buckwheat noodle, soo good where i'd rather have it to myself. but i guess sharing is caring! Their flavored soju is exceptional, depending which one you get though. (I'm just not a fan of overly sweet alcoholic beverages, ok) I do recommend getting the mango or peach soju if you're into the lighter and not heavy (like the yogurt one) dranks. The lemon and aloe soju is good too but i wouldn't order it again. Now, what I like best is somaek (soju w/ beer) and pairs best with their chicken and kimchi rice!", "author": "Deneb T."}

This place although far out in the sunset area is very popular so definitely make a reservation or you'll be waiting for quite a while.\n\nThe 5 of us squeezed into a booth and right away pressed the buzzer to order our feast. We ordered:\n+ Soju: can't go wrong with original but if you prefer flavored soju, the lychee one is great. The watermelon soju tastes good but was a bit too 'pulpy'.. so you'll be chewing your drink.\n+ Kimchee pancake: good but wished it came on a sizzling skillet that made it more crispy rather than doughy\n+ Shrimp fried rice: pretty good but I kinda forgot about the fried rice since it's a Korean restaurant after all\n+ Spam soup (aka military or hangover soup): I love Korean soups! I've had better but it was pretty good. \n+ Fried whole chicken: super crispy chicken.. it was probably double fried. However the large pieces of white meat were way overcooked since it was really dry.\n\nDon't expect the staff to be smiley & friendly.. it is an asian restaurant after all so you're there for the food. The place is pretty rowdy so it's great to come with a group of friends and have fun. The booth has this bamboo thing you can roll down for a bit more privacy but it doesn't do much.

Mood lighting with Christmas lights, lots of wood, good feel.\n\nWe got there at like 6:15 on a Tuesday (they open at 6) and although it wasn't full, it was easy to get a table. when we left an hours later though there was a line waiting. \n\nMy husband and I got four things - which was probably two things too many, but we wanted to try different stuff - so take home it is.  \n\nMy favorite of the night was the tempura calamari. Nice big pieces of squid, and well fried - but be warned, it was VERY greasy. \n\nSecond favorite was the Kimchi and beef fried rice. Not too spicy, not too sour. Came with a fried egg on top which is always a winner. \n\nThird, although not so impressed where the deep fried pot stickers. They tasted like deep fried Pot Stickers. Again, very oily.\n\nFourth, and really I didn't like it all, was the seafood and kimchi pancake. Honestly it just mostly tasted like oil to me. Yes, very greasy. But my husband really liked it and I recognize that asian pancakes aren't my thing, so there is that.\n\nThey also have hot pot, which would looked like a popular thing to get (many types on the menu too). They also had some kind of beverage in vinegar looking containers?

Some of the favorites are the chicken wings, Kimchi fried rice with a sunny side up egg on top was perfectly prepared and their big casserole (some of the casserole you can ask them for some ramen) was enough to feed four adults. The casserole can be on the spicier side, so as it boils down, ask the staff to add more soup stock to mellow it out.  They have two salads (family portion) that will make excellent starters to warm up your taste buds. Their Soju was fairly inexpensive for a large bottle. It was more on the light side and I think it went perfect with the meal.

NEVER have I EVER left a 1 star review for yelp in my entire life. I worked in the restaurant industry for almost 10 years as a dish washer, server and sushi chef since I was a young teenager until I graduated from college. I'm very experienced with the service industry, I know how tough it is. That's why I'm extremely forgiving of mistakes and always tip well even if the people I'm eating with disagree convincingly. This is why I'm so disappointed and disgusted with Toyose tonight. This was our entire group's first time eating at this place. We walked in and the girl in our group wrote her name immediately on the board and subsequently the 3 of us went to the bathroom while we were excitedly trying to figure out how Toyose is run. After coming out of the bathroom, \"JOON\" accused us of DELIBERATELY trying to cut in line. She wouldn't listen to us and aggressively kicked us out. I politely let her know that it was our first time and that we did not deliberately intend on cutting anybody. I even called in before our meal and was notified that the wait was approximately 20 minutes. I then informed \"JOON\" that we were just confused because it was our first time eating here and would be more than happy to wait in line. Instead of acknowledging or considering anything I have to say, with an extremely hostile facial expression, she repeatedly responded bluntly by saying \" I can't handle this\". She then continuously rebuked me and laughed at me as if I was lying to her, as if that warrants a considerable difference. Despite her repulsive tone and disrespect, I let her know that i totally understand how extremely busy she is and that we are simply newcomers who just wanted to be new customers. Honestly, I always tip fat because I know how hectic the service industry can be. She seemed furious on such a unnecessary level that it seems incomprehensible to fight over wanting to be served for dinner at a restaurant. Although she initially told us it would be two hours, she didn't like our response and instead of relieving tensions/misunderstandings, to my absolute surprise she unexpectedly escalated the situation with her grotesque animosity by smiling and saying it's gonna be \"3 hours\". For the first time in my LIFE, I lost my cool and couldn't be so forgiving as I typically am and could not be so tolerant of her disrespect to my integrity as a customer. I'm okay if the line was too long and thus couldn't get seated. That's no big deal, we'll come back next time. I'm not okay with my SERVER aggressively intimidating me and making me feel unwelcome, especially during my first time. Typically restaurants will sometimes give appetizers or drinks to newcomers, but not here at Toyose, definitely not with \"JOON\". I've had to apologize to customers even when it wasn't my fault while working in the restaurant industry. I had to put a smile on my face and do my job as a server or chef and serve my customers. I would have been more than happy with even \"bad\" service, hair in my food, wrong order, wrong bill, even getting sick from spoiled food(this actually happened this year and still I tipped and didn't leave a bad review at all), etc. I just won't stand such ridicule to an extent as if it's a reality tv show targeted for teenagers esp in front of the entire restaurant. Public humiliation/shaming for simply wanting to try Toyose. Your poor handling of the situation, or shall I say toxic behavior, caused other tables/customers to rally, cheer and shout despicable things to us based on your false assumptions. One table was belligerently slamming their table as they shouted degrading things to us as we left with our heads down for NO reason, maybe it's because they were drunk. I saw many bottles of soju on their table as we were rebuked and decided not to argue with drunk people. I have more rights than that as a customer of their business. This is a business, it should be professional. I refuse to succumb to such unnecessary conflict. Disgraceful. Absolutely embarrassing. I didn't even get to try their food. This post is NOT about the food. If \"JOON\" apologize to us then I'll take this post down and replace it with an excellent 5 star review. Until then, you reap what you sow. Don't piss off and scream at your customers, without us (your customers), you are nothing. Show some respect, if you don't like your job then quit or complain to management if you are struggling with external factors such as understaffing. Until then, good bye.", "author": "Kevin Y."}

We got there around 6:30pm and got seated a little past 7pm. Place is kind of small and if you have never been to it before you might miss it. It is literally a garage that opens up to a restaurant. I like the nice, comfy vibe, but sometimes the wait can take a while and there isn't much space inside to do that.\nFood wise, they have some really tasty dishes and some not so great ones. Heads up, no bonchon but they do send out bowls of popcorn to keep you satisfied while waiting for your dishes to come out. We usually go for the basic stuff. Love their pancakes! Recommend getting either the kimchee or the seafood. We tried the combo kimchee seafood pancake and enjoyed it less then when they are separated. The bulgolgi with calamari was a miss in my opinion. Not bad, but barely any meat and mostly veggies & squid. They do have some really good corn cheese. I think their corn cheese is actually my favorite out of all the places I've tried. The cheese is a little burnt on the top to give it that little crisp but still has that stringy effect when you grab a chunk of the corn! I also enjoy the casseroles, which come out in a big pan and burner to keep it hot. The spam  and kimchee one is my favorite cause it has some heat to it. Plus you can never really go wrong with spam!!\nThere soju is also really good! Lots of flavors to choose from and all really delicious. I've been to some places where the soju is to watered down or the flavoring tastes off but Toyose seems to have got it down. They offer a variety of all the flavors like strawberry, kiwi, mango, lychee, peach, pineapple, watermelon, yogurt, & aloe! If you haven't tried aloe before, I recommend it! Taste like muscat, or white grapes. Surprisingly refreshing! Just be careful because their soju will definitely creep up on you!\nDefinitely would go back, just not regularly. Great kick it spot especially if you are craving some soju. Food is good if you order the right things. Expect to wait for a table, anywhere from 30mins to over an hour depending on what time you go.

I'm not sure if this place is popular because of the quality of the food or because they are open until 2am. Nevertheless, their food is good, definitely spicy, and satisfies late night cravings. \n\nThe seafood pancake ($12.95) is one of my favorite orders. It's crispy, flavorful, and has a good amount of seafood in it. It's definitely a great appetizer to share. \n\nThe beef stew ($28.95) has a good variety of different types of food, all in one pot - beef, noodles, baby octopus, tofu, mushroom, and other veggies. It's sure to satisfy a variety of appetites, but even at mild, it can be a little too spicy. \n\nThe calamari with bulgogi ($13.95) is great for kids and those that do not like spicy foods. It comes out on a hot skillet w/ mushrooms and small vegetables. It was pretty good. \n\nThe kimchi fried rice with egg ($10.95) plus spam ($2) is another tasty, yet spicy, dish. I do wish they added a bit more spam as I didn't find much in the dish (and they charge extra for it). Compared to other restaurants that serve this dish, the spam content was a bit minimal. \n\nOne thing I like about this restaurant is that at each table, they have a little button that will summon the waitress to your table. One thing I don't like about this restaurant is that there are table that are right infront of the entire waiting area so not much privacy as your are dining while hungry people are hoping you will hurry, finish, and leave. \n\nToyose provides great late-night eats in the outer sunset and even at midnight or 1am (on weekends), there is a wait for a table. The crowd that dines here is definitely young, hip, and (usually) Asian. It's best to order a variety of food and soju to share with a small group.

Some of the better Korean cheese I've had mix in mayo. You have to have mayo in the corn cheese, otherwise the mozzarella becomes its own separate layer, kind of like how it is on pizza. There is nothing there to bind the cheese and the corn together. The mayo is extremely important. Also, for flavor.\n\nThe fact that they're open until 2am provides me with an easy place to keep in mind for a late night munchie if I'm ever in the city. The restaurant is in a really interesting location and going in and out of it, I feel like I'm warping to two different worlds.", "author": "Tom S."}

I'll never know but I'm glad I've walked in, sat down and ordered away.\n\n\nBeen coming to Toyose since my friend took me for my birthday a few months ago. We got the gal pals together last night and tried even more dishes like the seafood stew and beef kimshe fried rice.\n\n\nThis is very much a Korran American spot. My favorite dishes remain to be the shrimp fried rice and shrimp tempura. The seafood stew was spicy for my liking but I'd try there other stews and hot pots for sure.\n\n\nService can use some improvements and a few more smiles. However, they are on top of their game considering they are almost always at capacity every night. Kudos to the chefs back there, whatever magic they are using on these dishes is addictive.

The wait was just a short of 15 minutes on a Friday night which isn't too bad but the place is indeed a smaller restaurant. It is decorated as a garage door entrance and parking can be found on the street around the restaurant. I recommend ordering the Kim Chi fried rice and fried chicken wings. For Soju, I highly recommend Kiwi and Lychee. I've seen the mac and cheese corn to also be a popular dish. \n\nOverall I recommend it for smaller groups of around 4-6 people as it is a smaller restaurant.

I've come here multiple times with my friends for the yummy Korean food and soju cocktails. \n\nI like that they take reservations over the phone, so as long as you call in advance and let them know, they're pretty good about holding your table. They typically won't seat you until everyone in your group is there, so watch out for that.\n\nOn my most recent visit here, my friends and I shared two budaejjigae (Korean army stew, $25.95 each) and a seafood pancake ($12.95) along with some soju cocktails. I have very low spice tolerance, so I just picked at random things in the budaejjigae, but my friends really enjoyed it. Each budaejjigae is good for probably 2.5 people (we shared 2 among primarily 4 people and we ended up with a lot of leftovers).\n\nThe seafood pancake was decent...a little bit too oily and I didn't like how they put jalapenos on it as that's not a topping I typically see, but it was good and the portions of seafood toppings were generous.\n\nWe also ordered the yogurt and kiwi soju ($11 each) and both were bomb. I prefer my drinks fruity and really liked the fact that the soju flavor was not overpowering in either flavor. More so than the food, I love coming here for their amazing selection of soju cocktails! They offer a wide variety of flavors as well: aloe, kiwi, lemon, lychee, mango, peach, pineapple, strawberry, watermelon, and yogurt, so there is something for everyone! Each carafe is enough for probably ~14 shots.\n\nThey have a service button, so it was always easy to get our server's attention for additional orders, the check, etc.\n\nWe all left this place stuffed and our wallets only $22 lighter. Not a bad deal at all, especially for SF!\n\nParking in this area is all street. We found a spot along a residential street a block away pretty easily.", "author": "Dianna H."}

If I'm with a group big enough, I really like to get the beef pot because it has a medley of goodies including noodles, meat, and veggies. \n\nIt definitely gets crowded and feels a little cramped but when you're laughing with friends and a couple of sojus in, you're fine.

The restaurant is literally located in a garage, and if you've had one too many drinks, you'd probably walk right past it. It is definitely cozy inside but I think that's part of the appeal and charm. Located in the Outer Sunset, parking can be a hit or miss. If you arrive right when they open, you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. However, any time after that, be prepared to wait at least 30 mins to an hour for a seat, depending on the size of your group.

Service here has always been fine for me especially since there is a button at each table to catch the attention of the waiters. \n\nI only had the weekend in SF so I had to choose the places I wanted to eat wisely, and of course I picked this place! I used to come here in college all the time and for good reason. The food is deeeelicious! They do not serve banchan, but don't let that deter you. The food they serve is more than enough.

Even when we come at later times it seems like I always have to wait. \nBeen here a few times and my faves are probably the stew and the soju. The stew definitely fills you up and maybe too much for a party of two (especially when you were snacking on popcorn chicken just and hour ago). \nThis time I opted for a seafood udon while my bf had a seafood soybean paste and of course can't forget the soju (we had kiwi). The udon was not bad. I'd say the shrimp was a little too tiny compared to what I'm used to and there was WAY TOO MUCH octopus. After awhile I began to get tired of eating octopus so I ended up taking it out into a small bowl and it filled up like \u00be. That's a little too much octopus. Aside from that it was pretty standard udon. Nothing special nothing horrible. \nThe tofu on the other hand was to my bf's liking. It came out boiling and it was definitely filling for him with the bowl of rice. \nLast but not least, the soju. I like how it's a pur\u00e9e of real fruit + soju. It doesn't taste bad and goes down easily. Personally I think a bottle may be good enough for those who can handle their alc and if you can't it's always good to share.

The fried chicken is almost identical to what they serve in Korea so that's why I always come back.... to be honest I really just come back for the fried chicken. lol, I do wish they had all the side dishes and side sauces like other Korean restaurants do too, but I can manage since the fried chicken is super good by itself already.\n\nSome other things I've ordered here is the Cold buckwheat noodles which is more like a salad? There are lots of other vegetables in it which was different than what I'm used to. The taste is pretty refreshing but it wasn't what I expected from Spicy cold buckwheat noodles. \nI also had the tteokbokki which isn't bad... but there are other places that are a little better too. \nThe kimchi pancake is good but not as good as the seafood pancake.

That's the fascinating part is that this restaurant is located inside a house garage. How unoriginal and unique! From the outside, it looks like any sunset house but once you enter, the place consists of these tables with pull down bamboo curtains and further in are more tables. The vibe can be intimate and also cozy and fun for bigger crowds. \n\nOn this occasion, the bf and I took my grandma here cause she's never ate Korean food before. In the beginning, I tried to order things that I thought were more enjoyable for her like the japchae and chicken wings. BUT to my surprise, she liked everything else we ordered !\n\nFOOD:\n- JAPCHAE: came in a white boat shaped dish that is pretty good portioned. Consists of clear noodles that are sweet but NOT too sweet cause it's made of sweet potatoes!! and assorted veggies. Has a very good chewy texture. The grandma loved this dish! (4 stars)\n\n- GRILLED MUSSELS: comes in 6 individual half shelled mussels that are cooked and topped with this spicy mayo sauce I think? Very creamy and rich (3 stars)\n\n- BEEF KIMCHI FRIED RICE: theeee very fish dish I ever tried at Toyose years ago. I use to think it was HELLA good when I was younger but over the years, i realized it was just a hype and it wasn't as great as I thought it was. Just spicy kimchi fried rice mixed with beef, an egg on top, and shredded seaweed. (3 stars)\n\n- CORN CHEESE: one of my favorite dishes cause I love cheese and I love corn! So bam! Put together is yumm in every bite !! Really cheesy from the butt loads of melted buttery mozzarella they put and stringy!!! Only down side is when it gets cold and the cheese gets hard. So don't let this one sit for too long! (4 stars) \n\n- SPICY CHICKEN WINGS: must try!! The bf, grandma, and I all loved this dish. The wings were fried perfectly and crunchy and delicious! Comes with a side of salad and pickled radish. The bf isn't a spicy eater but he loved it (4.5 stars)\n\n- SPAM STEW: this dish is huge !! Came out in a big hot pot looking ... Pot. Sits on top of a portable stove so you can adjust the flame. This dish can be shared between 2-3 people. It includes spam, sausages, vegetables, slices of beef, rice cake, and ramen! The broth is spicy and steamy!! Perfect pick for a cold day. The dish itself consists of very basic and cheap ingredients  but what made us love getting it was the fun and warm feeling we get. Literally comfort food. :) (4.5 stars) \n\nDRINKS:\n- FRESH SOJU: initially got this for the bf and I while my grandma drinks hot tea but she insisted on trying and after that she kept saying in Chinese \"hao jiu\" which means good alcohol. Lol! She took a good two and half shots and a cup of beer. O.o\nThe soju wasn't too strong tasting with that rubbing alcohol taste which is good cause I HATE how some drinks have that smell and taste. Yuck. This pure soju was light and very easy to down (3.5 stars) \n\n- KLOUD: Toyose ran out of the OB beer that the bf likes so the waitress suggested he try another beer called Kloud. I'm not a beer drinker but the bf said it was good and paired well with the food. Grandma liked it also so I guess it's good ! \n\nService wise, both waitresses were really nice and friendly. Even joked around saying we sure know how to feast for ordering so much for just three people!! Heh heh. Little did we know that they were right and we end up packing half the food. All cause i ordered with my eyes again :| \n\nStrict on checking IDs also. Got our IDs checked twice by the two waitresses cause we asked for another shot glass for my grandma and they thought one of us was underage so had to check us both again.

WARNING: Everyone in your group has to be present in order to get a table. People actually arrive when they open on time.\n\n-My friends and I ordered chicken wings, octopus with spicy udon, kimchi fried rice, & their seafood pancake. Everything tasted delicious and they didn't take too long to bring the food out. Their kimchi fried rice and chicken wings are pretty average tasting. The chicken wings come with a small side of diced radish. I saw a lot of pictures on social media sites about how good Toyose and their food was, but the in-person experience is even better.\n\n-There's zero ventilation. Let's be real, this is a restaurant in a garage. The only source of wind/air is if the door is being opened and the small window of the backyard. I'd totally recommend dressing light and thinking twice about the layers. Some people eat, then go outside to chat or smoke, then come back inside to eat again. It is a weird concept, but my friends and I basically did that, and actually felt much better when sitting back down to finish eating our food.\n\nIt can get pretty hectic/noisy, so if you can't stand that type of environment, you should order takeout. Regardless, the environment at Toyose is group/date friendly. I've ordered takeout plenty of times here and it sometimes feels like the portions are bigger than eating in. They're very considerate about takeout orders because they wrap the food in foil, which is then inside the plastic box.", "author": "Erica K."}

They were all tasty and came in large, shareable portions. The seafood pancake and fried rice were favorites, and apparently that's what my roommates usually order. This restaurant is super cozy in terms of space and is optimal for four people. No more than that. And though we didn't have to wait for a table on a weeknight, I can imagine this must get busy on the weekends.

They recently changed the seating times so you only get 2 hours max. I rarely come to this place because it gets jammed PACKED! Its literally a restaurant in a home garage. I suggest to plan ahead and make reservations. \n\nWhat my friends and I usually order are as the following: \n\nCasserole (Assorted meats): Its so good, basically in a pot full of different things, theres spam, hot dogs, tofu, mushrooms, rice cakes, kimchi, veggies, beans, and many more! It usually comes with ramen, and you can order more if you want. We usually order more ramen because it goes really great with the soup base. It's not too spicy for all you non-spicy eaters, its pretty bearable, and I dont eat spicy much but if its not spicy enough you are able to ask for more chilies powder / flakes if needed. \n\nChicken wings: They are friend really well and I like that the meat is not dry. I always ask for the extra salad sauce to dip with the chicken even tho it on the salad that comes with the dish. \n\nChicken Gizzards: Its a hit or miss, some days it is over cooked so its a but hard to eat. I usually order the extra scallions and garlic to eat with. They do provide a seasae sauce and hot sauace but I dont usally use it since there is enough flavor in the gizzards when they cook it. \n\nSpicy Seafood Udon : I've only had it twice ever going there is its very good! The sauce and the udon go great together, along with teh seafood. it is very saucey , so the udon is not dry at all. Again def not spicy, but to your liking you can ask for more chili flakes. \n\nKimichi pancake or seafood: I always get it as an appetizer , it goes great with drinking soju and snaking on something light and not something super heavy. \n\nCheese corn: Its a must, to order as appetizer along with all the other small dishes such as wings, and pancake !\n\nThey have a variety of soju, usually we order so man I cannot keep track. \n\nAll in all this place is great, it just gets very busy and sometimes the wait can be up to 2 hours.

Firstly they charge 3$ extra on your bill to get a second serving of ban Chan or \" side dishes\" which r small portion and any other Korean restaurant you go to they will fill up your side dishes as much as you like for free, kind of weird you have to pay 3$ for your first refill , maybe after 2nd or third I would understand.

Came around 10pm on a Thursday and there wasn't a wait but there was still a lot of people. Waitress was nice but seemed a bit rushy.\n\nGot the Chicken Wings, Kimchi & Seafood Pancake, Kiwi Soju, and a Jap Chae. They say their soju is made with real fruit. We tried the Kiwi soju and it was tasty! There wasn't a heavy taste of alcohol but there were a LOT of kiwi seeds. The chicken wings were good too. They were big, crispy and tasty. The Jap Chae was a big portion. It was satisfying but it could use a bit more flavor. It was hard to pick up because it was a big portion and stuck together. The pancake came last surprisingly. It was delicious but too spicy for me.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I finally got to try Toyose. Pleasant experience. Portions are somewhat big to match the price paid.

Based on the high traffic of people that were there throughout our visit, I'd recommend going as early as possible right when they open especially if you have places to go afterwards. This is definitely a spot best for sharing a meal family style. Our order consisted of fried wings, seafood pancake, beef bulgogi with calamari, kimchee fried rice, cheese corn, and spam stew (spicy broth with pieces of spam, tofu, kimchee, and topped with uncooked ramen noodles) - the stew we could have skipped - in the end we were left with nearly a huge pot of it - and two bottles of soju in strawberry and yogurt flavors. Total bill with a 20% tip totaled to a bit over $150. Pretty good considering all that we ordered. Servers only came by if we pressed the call button on the wall.\n\nCome with people you love to talk to/hang out with, come hungry, and dress in layers. The place gets uncomfortably warm quickly. We were all sweating halfway into our meal. At one point we asked to have the front door opened to let in some cool air.

I looked at my phone again,  it's still 12:55, I'm pretty sure that he noticed the time too.

Then as we we're eating our food,  we realized there was something missing.  The side dishes. We came here a lot,  so we kinda know that they are like many other Korean restaurants that once you placed your order they will bring you side dishes. So when we asked for the side dishes,  the server said \"ya kitchen is closed\", he didn't make any apology of any sort...It's around 1:15, and they were still in the process of preparing our fried rice. \nThis is the tipping point, \n-he should have informed us that they don't serve side dishes at the time of our order\n-he should at least apologized for not serving them\n-the restaurant should have a last call notice posted\n\noh almost forgot to mention, after he gave us the check, he constantly asked us to sign it, at least 3 times, I still don't get his intention for doing so, but it's extremely unpleasant and rude. \n\n    We walked out at 1:29 am - still 30minutes before their closing time, they almost immediately started mopping,  we figured that they just want to end the day by chasing us off.", "author": "Thomas L."}

The beef kimchee fried rice was great.  The egg was super runny and it oozed all over the rice like how egg porn should.    The kimchee pancake was very flavorful.

The corn cheese was different from what I have ordered at other places.  It was really cheesy, maybe even too cheesy for my liking. O_O! I wish there was a higher ratio of corn to cheese.  \n\nIn conclusion, I will be back.  They do have a lot of tasty items on the menu.  Service was okay.

If you're walking by it you might miss it since it's literally in someone's garage, but once you walk in you completely forget that fact. It looks like a typical Korean restaurant inside, maybe a little darker than most. It is a little small and the seats fill up quickly so I recommend getting here right at opening for dinner! This will help with parking too since parking tends to be a bit difficult in this area. \n\nThe food is all incredible so there's really no need to rate them separately. The kimchi fried rice is bombdigs - its the perfect balance of spicy and sour and the portion sizes are pretty generous. The chicken katsu is crispy but incredibly juicy and not at all overdone. But the absolute star of this place is the spam stew aka army stew aka budae jigae. Guys this is amazing. It's literally a spicy soup base, full of rice cakes, hot dogs, spam, tofu, ramen noodles, beef, and some veggies. For anyone who is super against this cause of the processed meat, get over yourself and give it a try, it might surprise you! Cause let's be real, hot dogs and spam make everything better, sorry not sorry.  The portion size says for 2 but you could definitely split this between 3 or 4 people.

I also need this review to stand out.\n\nBig customer tip: Come at 12:30, they're going to hate you if you come at 1.\n\nI'm a reasonable guy, and when I come to a restaurant that closes in an hour, I think getting a seat and food is a totally reasonable expectation. But that wasn't the case. \n\nMy group of 4 came in at 1 AM to the dot, an hour before closing. There was no line, and there was definitely space for us. I signal a \"4\", the lady sees it, and disappears to some corner. She comes back and says \"sorry we're take out only at this time.\" I was dumbstruck, there was no sign in the front (and if there was, I was too hungry and it was too dark to see it), and I know we would have honestly been out quickly considering how hungry we were and how quick they are. At any rate, we were too hungry to go anywhere else so we just decided we'll eat in my car and I figured we were being flexible for their sake (kind of the reverse considering how I was the customer). They gave us the menu and we started looking through it. End of story right? No. \n\nA couple minutes after my group arrived, another group came by. They were told the exact same thing, and the girl asked if they could just order take out and eat inside. The response just made me angry. The lady basically said \"No, do you want to eat here? Because we're closing our kitchens in like 5 minutes so you have to order in like 30 seconds.\" (That's not verbatim, but that's the jist) That's such a terrible answer to give a customer. She gave no reason WHY they couldn't eat inside. Anyway, we got our food and we ate in the car without drinks (we actually asked for drinks but I guess they were so much in a rush they neglected to give us any). While we ate, I was going to buy some soda from them, so I came back in at 1:40, I didn't even get to say a word before she yells across the room \"We're closed now!\" I told her I just wanted to buy some drinks (AKA give your business some easy money) and she still said no. Apparently it's just IMPOSSIBLE for a small business to give a customer 4 sodas out of their fridge 20 minutes before closing. \n\nLook, I've worked at a small business, I know it can be a pain to deal with customers, especially the ones that make unreasonable demands. I think I was being reasonable. We finished our food well before closing, and I still saw people trickling out as they finished their food past 2AM. We could have easily eaten our fill and gotten out of their hair by 1:45. It was incredibly inflexible. \n\nPersonally, I think just giving a 1 star is unhelpful for a review. So here are a few suggestions to foster growth: \n\nPut a sign that says \"take out only after x time\"\n\nClose your restaurant at 1:30 if you don't want to serve people that come it at 1:00.\n\nListen to your customers and be flexible. \n\nI've got a good feeling the business isn't going to read this review, so I don't know if writing this review was a waste of time or not.", "author": "Carlo L."}

I've had my fair share of not so fantastic service, but this place is an absolute mad show after 7pm on most days, so I don't blame them for not being able to keep up with 50+ people all night. The food is always consistent, and while it's not anything revolutionary, it's comfort food at its finest. You can always stop by after a bar run and grab some chicken or kimchi or you name it. The soju is tasty here as well, and a very reasonably priced for what seems like a good 10 shots per bottle. When it comes down to it, if you have never been here, it's definitely an experience, as there aren't many places with the type of ambiance Toyose has. \n\nFinal verdict: It's a family run restaurant inside a garage.

It's a small restaurant so try to make reservations if you can since the wait can be pretty long. The service isn't that great - I've been here a few times and they're usually rude or ignore you unless you have someone who speaks Korean. (And I only say this because my Korean friend confirms that it's true.) We were a party of 6 (4 guys, 2 ladies) and I was annoyed that they squeezed us into a table meant for 4 people. It was so hard to eat without bumping into one another. \n\nAnyway...onto the food. We ordered a lot but I couldn't take pictures because we were starving and dug right in. \n\n-Kimchi fried rice: Always a good choice! Just the right amount of spice and the kimchi wasn't overpowering at all. Delicious! \n\n-Seafood pancake: This is one of the better seafood pancakes I've had compared to other restaurants. There is a good variety of seafood - shrimp, squid, oyster, etc - and the pieces are nicely chopped up. I would recommend ordering this for sure. \n\n-Spam stew with ramen: This dish can be spicy so if you have a low tolerance, you should make sure you let your waiter know. There was plenty of meat - spam, hot dogs, beef galore. This is a good one to order for a group to share. \n\n-Calamari tempura: Meh. Pass. The calamari was over breaded and there were vegetables we could not identify. \n\n-Fried chicken: It's fried chicken. Nothing special. \n\n-Lychee soju was yummy! Especially if you get the last of the bottle with all of the lychee bits. Mmmm. We also ordered the kiwi soju but I didn't think it was that great. It had a weird aftertaste to it.", "author": "Xue Vee Y."}

(mentally)\n\nI've been going here for 5-6 years, eating and drinking soju with friends, co-workers, family etc.  Up until last night I've always had a nice experience here, at a point got to know some of the waitresses/waiters, Annie, June, and my favorite but doesn't work there anymore, Jin.  Shoutouts to Jin, thanks for your great customer service here when you did work at Toyose.\n\nIt was a very busy night on Valentines Day, we waited and caused no disturbance.  Getting straight to the point my girlfriend and I had plans for another restaurant but sadly it was closed so we both decided to go to Toyose.  We ate and decided to drink after eating.  Before drinking we decided to get some fresh air for 5 minutes outside so Will our waiter took my ID so I don't run out not paying the bill.\n\nAfter coming back I had to use the restroom just to wash up.  I was in and out in literally less than 20-30 seconds.  Coming back we were just about to order some soju until Will our waiter came up behind me and told us with a very bold confident tone \"oh can you stop tagging our restroom?\".  Confused I looked at my girlfriend to see what she knows about this \"tagging\" we both looked confused at Will.  With a confident tone he constantly nagged \"yeah it's okay we know so please stop tagging okay?\".  I was SHOCKED, I literally thought this was one of those YouTube prank videos.\n\nI asked Will to show me the graffiti, he opened a cabinet inside the bathroom and pointed out some crayon like tagging inside the cabinet door.  He smirked like he was confident that he caught me doing this.  What was worse I looked at June who I remember being served by for over almost 5 years accuse me too.  After coming out of the bathroom with the waiter Will she added \"when you went into the restroom it wasn't there and when you came out it was there so we know so please stop tagging\" as I walked back.  \n\nI paid and left.  It killed the entire night for my girlfriend and I on Valentines Day.  I didn't tip, why bother tipping a place that's going to accuse me of doing something I didn't even do.  The worst part is that their \"evidence\" is based off what I wrote on the wait list which looks \"similar\" according to waitress and waiter to the tagging and it looks like it says \"Eros\" which is my name.  Keep in mind when I wrote my name on the wait list it was written in regular print and looked nothing like cursive/graffiti tagging.\n\nTL;DR  Went out to Toyose for Valentines Day dinner date, been going here for 5-6 years, was kicked out for being accused of tagging their bathroom.  Killed our day and mood for the rest of the night.\n\nThey're literally confident that I tagged their bathroom with no solid evidence at all.  I can now see why everyone likes this place but if anything the customer service is terrible.  So next time if you ever do decide to come back to Toyose think about if maybe they'll just point the finger at you and blame you for tagging their bathroom or something crazy and silly.\n\nToyose and especially Will you take the biggest fattest L.", "author": "Eros M."}

It adds more flavor to it. Their wings are not bad but sometimes they fried them too dry. \n\nRice Cake (tteokbokki): it is good but the sauce it's a little too sweet for my personal taste. But it is spicy. Sometimes when I order Kimchi fried rice I pour the rice cake sauce on my rice to make it more spicier and more flavorful. I recommend anyone to do this once and tell me if they liked it or not. \n\nBeef kimchi fried rice- regular kimchi fried rice.

What a great way to deal with negative feedback by trying to silence your customers. \n-----------------------------------------------------------\nPeople usually skip over service related reviews (I know I do), but this isn't meant to sway the general public, as I know on a place with 1300 reviews and 3.5 stars my opinion isn't likely to mean much. And maybe that's why the staff at places like these may feel immune to poor customer experiences, but it's the few 1 or 2 star reviews that will unnecessarily bring your score down over time if the service is consistently terrible.\n\nThis is a letter to the owner of Toyose, urging you to hire better servers (maybe ones that don't antagonize your customers like June did to us) and a note for my ~900 Yelp friends, who will see this as one of the top reviews when they search for a Korean spot to eat in this area. Please take your business elsewhere.\n\nCame here last night with a couple friends under a reservation. As we were waiting for a table, one of my friends was unknowingly leaning on the door of the bathroom which the waitress June was in. When she opened the door he fell in as his weight was on it and she said something like \"Can I get out first?\" to which he replied \"You let me in!\" in a lighthearted joking manner (because he pretty much fell into the bathroom). It was such a non-issue we thought nothing of it until when he came out she came up to us and said \"I took your names off the reservation list because I didn't appreciate the way you talked to me\" and we all were super confused like wait ... did this really just happen? My friend tried to apologize and explain his side of what happened, which she refused to acknowledge and dismissed as insincere. Minutes after our reservation time comes and passes I come up and ask if we are going be seated. In the rudest manner she tells us to feel free to put our names back on the waitlist as she won't honor our reservation and kept aggressively gesturing to the \"we reserve the right to refuse service to any customer\" sign. As individuals who have held jobs in the restaurant/service industry ourselves, we all agreed that we would never dream of treating any customer the way we were just treated - so we left.\n\nThere are always two sides to every story. I've explained the facts of what transpired as objectively as possible, you can decide whether or not the actions were justified.\n\nWe'll never come back because extremely rude service far outweighs the novelty of eating in a garage. Especially when there are other delicious Korean spots right around the corner where you won't be treated like shit. See:\n\n- Shin Toe Bul Yi\n- The Spot Lounge\n\nAnd I feel like this is common sense, but maybe if you hate people so much and are going to be a raging bitch to your customers, maybe DON'T WORK IN CUSTOMER SERVICE?

The sweet potato noodles (still don't understand how they make noodles out of sweet potato... lol!!) are soft and chewy, and they taste slightly sweet. The japchae is also warm and not cold like other places. The cheese corn is basically buttered yellow corn with mozzarella cheese melted on top... So basic, but delicious! The seafood pancake is a flat, crispy pan-fried pancake with a hefty amount of seafood mixed in.. I like the octopus and the squid! In my opinion, the kimchee fried rice is only okay.. The presentation is pretty with the egg and the nori, but it just kinda tastes like spicy rice to me!\n\nAll of the entrees are shareable, so you should definitely try to come with 3 or more people so you can try different things.

Let me start by saying I love Korean and I come from humble Ohio. \n\nThis is a small location, a handful of tables on the inside, there is a homey nautical charm when you first step in and usually a wait. When we arrived on a Tuesday night about 8, we didn't have to wait too long. I can see how there could be a long wait but it's all about timing! The food was amazing, great for sharing, they had a lot of great offerings and filled us up! Well priced soju if you wanna get your drank on, we had the mango flavor.

I recommend getting one of their hot pots so that you can share with friends and the bill will be a little cheaper. Their fried chicken is also a very delicious dish to share as well as their kimchi fried rice and pancake. Toyose's portions are a good size so I wouldn't recommend getting their appetizers unless you are extremely hungry and/or willing to spend. \n\nSometimes the wait can get long and especially how the place is like a hole in the wall.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-14", "description": "The food here is prrrretty good, and I'm generally unimpressed by Korean bar food. But the service was disappointing to me, and I didn't even expect awesome service since it was a Saturday night and pretty packed. We came here for a belated birthday celebration, and there were six of us. The waitress checked on us maybe once, never smiled, and forgot about the birthday cake we'd given her earlier before bringing the check. Also, I didn't realize this until later, but we didn't get any side dishes at all. For the pretty pennies this place charges for mediocre portions, the service was lacking.\n\nThe inside is crowded and stuffy, with spindly chairs and tables. We made a reservation since this place is tiny (yes, it's actually a garage), and it took a short time to get seated. \n\nStrawberry and kiwi soju:\nThe strawberry and kiwi soju (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#sJoUwcRP_WQEpdGm5eqZMg) were tasty, and my friend did this nifty thing where he made rainbow shots (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#WJpl9T_tj189pLmRYPqnGg) by layering the two. I don't know if they were super strong, but I didn't really taste the soju at all.. I think they used real fruit though, which I was a fan of. The bottles that these come in have small openings, so sometimes you need to pop the top and reinsert it before the liquid starts flowing. The price wasn't too bad for the amount.\n\nSpicy fried chicken wings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#ZzKKqvqHLXLqlzqZSFRyoQ)\nThis was okay, nothing special. I felt like the temperature was the best part: piping, piping hot. The flavor was unmemorable, and I don't think I would get this again.\n\nBeef kimchi fried rice:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#79EVJ-9sz_Jcsl7p_UiGwQ)\nSo every time I go to a new Korean place, there always seem to be reviews claiming that the kimchi fried rice there is \"the best.\" I was really surprised when I tasted the kimchi fried rice here, and I think it really is the best I've ever had. I don't know what it is, but maybe it's the fact that they use ground beef, which distributes the beefy flavor more evenly and potently throughout the rice. The rice itself was maybe a tiny bit on the sticky side, but it was very well mixed and the flavor is unparalleled. The portion was mediocre, but I would definitely get this again.\n\nKimchi seafood pancake:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#6o2Pj1wOxSKvsf33lsUrlQ)\nI've never seen kimchi seafood pancake before (usually it's just seafood pancake), so I was excited to try this. It tastes like seafood pancake.. with a bit of sour distributed throughout. It was slightly undercooked in the middle so that the batter was a little soggy, and I do remember thinking that it was a little thinner than ones I've had at other places.\n\nSeafood stew:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#bn8LmUdbAqutq86jLxOzjQ)\nI was actually really impressed with this stew. For almost $30, I was skeptical about how worth it this would be, but it came in a huge pot with a personal stove and frozen udon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=blBLAko7I1qcUK0bUsGfHA#GgSea5QhWyFIAlRsit3sPg) on the side. There was a generous portion of all kinds of seafood inside, including blue crab, octopus, head-on shrimp, fish (bone-in pieces), tofu, and vegetables. The ingredients all tasted pretty fresh, and this was more than enough to share. The soup flavoring was maybe a little one-dimensional since it was just spicy, but the seafood was delicious. \n\nWhen the waitress did finally bring out the birthday cake (after I reminded her twice), it was still in the box it came in.. I was a little dismayed at that, but maybe that was a miscommunication since I didn't specify that she should take it out of the box. That's never happened before at other restaurants though.\n\nThe food was good, but maybe next time I'll get takeout..? Actually I'm not even sure they offer takeout..", "author": "Maggie X."}

The kimchi fried rice was the highlight of the meal, only dish worth coming back. \n\nAfter a more clear tasting of everything else, the bulgogi with calamari was subpar. Something thrown together in a hurry. The seafood pancake lacked ingredients and the batter was too soft (Fell apart). Wings were fried good but nothing special. I liked the kimchi tofu soup as it wasn't just spicy, but had a good sour flavor to it. But, I think it's overpriced as you only get a couple pieces of tofu and soup.\n\nI can swear I thought the food tasted better the first time! Sadly, this place is more hype than anything.

I cant take a lot of heat, but this was a good of spicyness for me. For those who can take more spicy, you would def feel a bit of a kick in the dish. REALLY GOOD. the rice cake and fish cake pieces are soft and chewy and the cabbage gives it a nice crunch.\n-fried chicken wings: i heard these were really good, so i had to order them! they also come with a side of daikon. These worked well with me because when the spicyness would be too much for me, i would eat a piece of chicken and daikon to cool my mouth. The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and meat was done really well. They had sliced cabbage on the side with some kinda sauce.

I mean- they were busy, so I'm not hating on them by any means, but it would of been real nice if they checked on us a little more often.  \n\nWe waited about 45 minutes for out table and I don't believe it was worth it.

Knowing the long waits it's infamous for, we arrived when it opened at 6pm and were seated promptly. It's cramped inside but the atmosphere and vibe felt very intimate and comfortable. \n\nWe went ahead and ordered some of their popular items on the menu: kimchi fried rice, seafood pancake, and spicy chicken wings. The spicy chicken wings came out first and they were very crispy! We enjoyed the light batter and were able to taste the semi-spicy flavor of the chicken as well, although the chicken itself was a bit dry. The seafood pancake was pan-fried nicely and generously filled with seafood. The star of the night though, the kimchi fried rice, took my expectations for this dish to a whole new level! It's well praised amongst Yelpers because the rice wasn't clumped together, kimchi wasn't spicy but contained the flavor (as it should be), and there was a good portion of meat, which many Korean restaurants tend to skimp out on. \n\nDefinitely recommend trying this place if you're in the area...and of course, I'll be returning ;)!", "author": "Vivian L."}

Over the phone, they told me they could seat a table for 7-8, and anything bigger would be harder. When we got there, my party of 8 was squeezed into one of the booths. (A REALLY tight squeeze - we joked that we had to finish all the food when it was served because we only had room on the table for the alcohol. We did end up trying to finish all the food so we had more space.)\n\n- Dubboki with Fish Cakes: perfect amount of spiciness, but I wish there were more rice cakes! It seemed as if the whole dish was filled with fish cakes.\n- Cheese Corn: lots of ooey-gooey cheese.. can't really mess up cheese corn, right? ;)\n- Seafood Stew: at ~$26 a pot, I expected more from this dish especially since people raved about it and the pictures look awesome. We'd definitely skipping this dish next time for something else.\n- Seafood Pancake: nothing *too* special.\n- Kimchi Fried Rice: this dish did live up to its hype on Yelp. How did they make it so addicting!?\n\nSoju ($12) Flavors: strawberry, mango (MUST GET!), peach, pineapple, yogurt, aloe (I LOVE aloe,  but this you can skip..), and kiwi (has kiwi seeds!).

Those things are amazing.\n\nOther things on the menu are so-so. And some things coming out of the kitchen are outright garbage. The latter is referring to my experience from last night where the 10 dollars I though was funding an order of chicken katsu instead rendered two microwaved Banquet chicken patties served with a warm, unappetizing lettuce salad. \n\n  I thought maybe they ran out and thought it was better to sell something than nothing (it's not, btw), but then I saw that it's a mainstay here. There is a review on here praising the chicken katsu, which is laughable at best (look at the picture in Sam L's review, you can clearly see it's a processed frozen chicken patty). I don't usually get this bitter or petty on Yelp, but when you pay over 10 dollars for a dish, you expect it to not be from the freezer section at Costco. So I repeat, DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN KATSU, unless you like wasting money on something you could get for a fraction of the cost at 7Eleven.\n\n  Also, the bulgogi and calamari sounds like a great idea, but it's disappointing. It's very watery and bland, with the flavor having been drawn out of the beef into the water and the calamari rubbery and flavorless as well. Just get the regular bulgogi. \n\n  Overall, I'd recommend this place, because their good items are very good, but you should go in prepared to learn expensive lessons via trial and error on what you shouldn't order.", "author": "J R."}

You definitely won't be disappointed. I like it because it's crispy versus your wet glazed wings. Their seafood pancake is cooked to perfection with a good amount of seafood and flavorful. Their kimchi fried rice is sooo good. I have no idea why, but I like it more than other korean spots. Maybe they put MSG in it, jking...but maybe....? It could be because I find the beef more flavorful than spam, don't get me wrong I do like spam. But I guess the beef makes it different and stand out from your typical kimchi fried rice. Or maybe it's just that perfectly cooked fried egg that wins me over and the yellow river that flows over my rice that makes my mouth water.\n\nPrice isn't bad at all.

The food looked delicious, so I convinced my boyfriend to take me. This review, however, will not be about the food but about the service because the quality of service outweighed the quality of the food. \nMy boyfriend and I decided to take my dad here for father's day. Things were going okay, until we paid for our food. After we paid for the food, my boyfriend went to the bathroom. While my boyfriend was in the bathroom, my dad and I stayed at the table talking and  packing our leftovers to go. That's when one of waitresses (who wasn't even our server) rudely interrupted us asking if we were paying tip. I've never encountered a server asking for tip before, and especially not as rudely as she did. Due to her rudeness, we decided not to leave tip. As we were leaving, that same waitress actually chased us down (mind you we were sitting at the back of the restaurant), yelling as we were passing customers, and all the way to the exit. She was adament about us paying tip, so my father responded by asking if it was mandatory. She then goes on to argue with my dad ON FATHER'S DAY! That's when my boyfriend steps in and tells her \"we are not legally obligated by law to tip you.\"  She then has the nerve to respond \"don't ever come back again.\" U serious? U weren't our waitress and you're not the owner. But to be honest, you didn't need to tell us that because we definitely won't be back after how you treated us.

My friend made reservations, but they won't set you until your whole party has arrived.  Half of our party was running late, so we had to give up out reservation.  When our whole party finally arrived they were very  accommodating.  We didn't have to wait too much longer till we got a table.

It had good kimchi flavor and the fried egg on top was perfectly cooked.  \n\nSeafood pancake- the pancake is pretty big!   I didn't expect it to have so many pieces.  Lots of seafood bits in it.  Some of seafood did tasted a little over cooked, but over all good flavors! \n\nSpam stew- huge pot! Definitely need a group to devour this!  The stew had a good amount of spicy flavor.  There was a square piece of those dry ramen that you can buy at super market placed in the stew.  The stew pot came on a portable stove so you can cook the ramen in the stew.  In the stew were pieces of spam, hot dog, tofu, fish cake, rice cake, veggies, and ramen.  There was definitely a lot of meat, but I wish there was more ramen.  The flavors were flavorful.  \n\nYogurt soju- came in a pretty decent size bottle.  This was my first time having soju and it wasn't bad.  Didn't know what to expect from it.

Arriving just after 6 pm on a Wednesday evening, parking was a breeze and there was no wait for a booth table near the entrance.  Being my first visit here, I left the menu to my friends who both have dined here before.\nDining family style, here's what we ordered:\n\n1) Seafood pancake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eU3zYVkPdzj9OdpYjlD8nw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Nicely cook and served hot with a tangy dipping sauce.\n\n2) Fried chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Tmbx1dzbfDGT8sFeSM_KCw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My hosting friend insisted on this since the restaurant always ran out before he could order it. Lightly crusted, crispy fried chicken worked very well with the pepper salt dip.\n\n3) Kim Chee fried rice - Nothing spectacular, but glad the rice was not mushy.\n\n4) Spam stew (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=U5llt2l7q5uFZeOSUATcAA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Yes, look at the picture and marvel at the ingredients.  As the broth boiled and the ingredients literally disintegrated into the soup, this became a interesting mix of both flavors and textures.  The ingredient mix (Spam, Vienna sausage slices, chives, Napa cabbage, rice cake, and, yes, ramen noodles... probably missed something here).  If you like Spam and sausages, this dish will warm you  on those cold winter Sunset nights.\n\nThe portions being targeted for family style were generous and the prices reflected it (Spam stew was $23.50).  They also provided a variety of banchan that included Kim Chee cabbage, marinated bean sprouts, pickled cucumbers, and bow tie pasta salad.  \nMidway through the meal, we noticed people coming in and seating themselves on a bench across the walkway from our table so definitely recommend coming early or probably late for dinner.  As the number of waiting customers increased, our waitress kindly pulled down some wooden blinds to project some impression of privacy.  There is a service buzzer at each table in case you need the waitress' help.  \nI wouldn't look at this as a destination dining spot, but more of one of those \"if-you're-in-the-neighborhood\" places, especially for late night dining judging by their hours of operation.", "author": "Mike C."}

But literally less than a minute later, the waitress swiftly asked us for our order. I didn't really have time to look at the menu,  although I did try my best to skim and look for the kimchi fried rice, to no avail. I asked if they served kimchi fried rice. She said yes and I remember saying in a low voice, \"We'll do that.\" We ended up not receiving the kimchi fried rice... we kindly asked where that was, and she got extremely defensive and almost argued with me. Apparently, I specifically only asked her if their restaurant served kimchi fried rice-- I didn't actually order it. I found it ridiculously comical, because if you as a server came to a table to take an order, and someone asks you whether a dish was available, wouldn't you assume that they were at least interested in ordering it and confirm? Moreover, why would we eat two plates of meat with no rice? We got the check, promptly gave our cards, and even then, we were rushed and asked to sign the checks right away. Mind you, this is well before 2am and there were still people in the restaurant.

BUT, coming here for dinner isn't really all that great. Food is mediocre and the price is DEFINITELY not cheap. \n\nYes, kimchi fried rice and the seafood pancake were probably the best two things on their menu. Still though, the rice could have had a bit more flavor of some sort. Seafood pancake is doughy, but, I like it like that. Oooooh, and who could forget the soju? Hard to taste the alcohol = the dangerous kinds \n\nThe biggest disappointment was their fried chicken wings. Where's the meat? Pretty disappointing. Flavor was okay, though. Their tofu and hot pot items were also a total let down. It didn't feel authentic as the broth tasted like hot water, with the ingredients just tossed in. \n\nIt's different. Dining with friends and dining with parents. Friends, you care more about the drinks and food is more the bonus. Dining with parents, you actually experience the food.

The location, along with the interesting decorations and cozy ambience, make it a fun place to have some flavorful Korean specialties. \n\nWhen you get inside make sure to sign-in on their list towards the back of the restaurant so the waitress can seat you sooner. Its a small restaurant and is usually crowded so expect a moderate wait. We had a party of two on a Friday night and only waited 15 minutes or so. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the Toyose spicy fried chicken wings, Seafood stew casserole, shrimp fried rice, and a bottle of OB beer. \n\nThe chicken wings weren't very spicy, but still decent, and paired well with the OB. The Seafood stew casserole came out on a burner and was full of squid, octopus, fish, shrimp, tofu, an assortment of vegetables and some ramen. It had a rich, spicy broth that's great for warming up on a cold night or winding down after a night of drinking. The shrimp fried rice was okay, but I'd probably go with the kimchee fried rice next time. \n\nOverall Toyose was an enjoyable experience and would be a great choice to have a fun night of food and drinks with friends.", "author": "Phi P."}

We had a lot of calamari that night. Service was pretty good for a busy place (maybe we got lucky); the lady came to check on us every time we pressed the service button on the wall.\n\nWill definitely come back to try their chicken wings (especially after the smell wafted over from the table behind us before our food came...  made me regret immediately for not getting those wings).

From the outside, this restaurant looks just like any other garage on it's foggy block. However, upon entering it's a whole another story. The restaurant is cozy without being overly congested. There's a couple four tops in the front and the back opens up to a seating area that holds probably 20 maximum. We were seated promptly in the back. The decor was pretty basic, but I found it to be just the right touch of led strung lights, bamboo shades, and authentic korean decorations. It felt very homely. \n\nLooking at the menu the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't enough variety. You've got your hot pot/hot soups, appetizers, and a couple rice dishes. But, where was the meat dishes, like the ever popular bulgogi, kalbi, etc...?  There was nothing on the menu that screamed for my attention and made me want to buy. The appetizers were the usual fare ranging from mandu to baby octopus (not alive). My roommate and I ended up ordering the japchae and the kimchi bokkeumbap. The food arrived quickly and was hot. \n\nThe japchae noodle was cooked well, but that's where the goodness ends. The onion, bell pepper, and cabbage were cut to a huge size and weren't complimenting of the noodles at all. The seasoning was pretty off too, as the japchae tasted like pepper. There was no depth and umami flavors. \n\nI figured that the kimchi bokkeumbap would be the hero and save the night, but I was wrong. The rice was over cooked and the whole entree, just like the japchae, lacked flavor. How could something so pretty with a fried egg on top and so red be so bland?! The dish needed more of a salty, pungent, and tangy element. \n\nThe upside though was the attentive and happy service from the waitresses. Not to mention the huge Hite beers that they sell!

The seafood pancake is filled with seafood and has a nice crisp to it. Dipping sauce is good too.\n\nPrices are about right for a Korean place.. About 20$ a person... \n\nWe drank a little afterwards, had a green bottle of Soju and a strawberry Soju. Pretty good, tasted strong cause we mixed both in the shot glasses. Best way to drink Soju!

We ordered a bottle of Kiwi Soju, a bottle of Peach Soju, spicy chicken wings (appetizer), kimchi fried rice, and one of the kimchi soups. The spicy chicken wings came out almost immediately, and they were crispy and delicious! The four of us devoured them instantly. Also, I knew I wasn't a fan of kimchi fried rice because I didn't like it the one time I ate it at a Korean food court, but the kimchi fried rice here is bomb! It was also devoured within five minutes of being served. The kimchi soup with beef had so many fresh ingredients in it and is definitely family-sized. Some ingredients include octopus, beef, the thin white mushrooms, etc. I also heard the kimchi soup with spam was good as well, but had more of a salty taste to it.\n\nI cannot even begin to explain how tasty the soju is here. It's the best and freshest tasting soju I've ever had, especially because the fruity sojus are served with real fruit. For example, the kiwi soju contained kiwi seeds inside of it, which makes the drink have a really nice texture as it smoothly slides down your throat. The peach soju was deliciously sweet and I knew I could drink the whole bottle if I tried. The waitress said that the sojus were strong and that they could sneak up on you if you drank fast enough...boy was she right, haha.\n\nI'd definitely want to come again, and the next time, I hope to try all of the flavored sojus!

I really missed the giant pots that had ramen, rice cakes, and other goods inside it. We came here and ordered the seafood pancake, fried chicken, and the said pot (spam one). Let's start with the giant pot, it was very disappointing tbh. The rice cakes weren't that great in it, and it was mainly filled with kimchi and really hard to finish all of that. Wish there was more soup actually. Usually not a big proponent of seafood pancake, but man this was actually really good, glad we got it. And it was quite large. The fried chicken was also really good. So basically came here for 1 thing, best thing was the 2 other dishes.", "author": "Victor D."}

I didn't realize it was a converted residential garage until we entered and saw how tiny it is in there. Our timing was good because we were seated right away at a table meant for four people but unfortunately in clear view of everyone who followed us and ended up waiting on the bench staring at us as we ate. Welcome to Toyose.\n\nWe were pretty much starving by the time we got there since it is a schlep from SoMa, so we were a mite disappointed that the banchan consisted of only four little dishes instead of the usual 10 to 12 (see photo). Jamie quickly zeroed in on the $10.95 Beef Kimchi Fried Rice which looked lovely with a fried egg and strips of nori on top (see photo). It was hearty and flavorful, but I have to admit the kimchi didn't have quite the kick we were both hoping for. That problem was not as apparent with my pick, the $13.95 Tofu Kimchi, quite an extravaganza of tofu slices with a torrent of spicy pork and vegetables and kimchi running through the middle of it (see photo). That was the best dish of the night.\n\nMarginally disappointing were the $12.95 Spicy Chicken Wings, rather overpriced for the portion and not that spicy either. I quite liked the shredded cabbage salad on the side which was covered in a thousand-island-like miso dressing (see photo). However, I have to admit the totally dispensable dish of the night was the $5.95 Corn Cheese, which didn't strike us as Korean but more like something Stouffer's would sell as a frozen side dish for the busy suburban housewife. It was absurdly gooey with melted cheese mixed with a few kernels of corn and chopped green beans and then obviously put under a broiler for the crusty topping (see photo).\n\nBoth the wings and the corn cheese struck us more as bar food for the seriously hung over. Speaking of which, we noticed a high hipster quotient in here as well as a strong dosage of Asian family parties. It's probably too far-flung a location for the tourist trade, and frankly, who would come cross-town to a converted garage anyway? Service was attentive, and they even have a buzzer which you can press as it clings precariously against the wall. I guess it's sorta like honking your horn at a drive-in diner so that the waitress on roller skates can come pick up the tray off your car window. I think Toyose serves its purpose in serving Korean comfort food and satisfying a case of the post-barhopping munchies.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good portions, some good flavors but needs a bit more kick and a little more panache\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's a garage with no windows for Pete's sake\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...the waitresses respond to the buzzer almost as good as the flight attendants on Southwest\nTOTAL - 3 stars...popular Korean outpost in the Outer Sunset isn't lacking for hungry & possibly hungover customers", "author": "Ed U."}

As good as it gets!\n\nCame here from FiDi last night to chow down with a few friends from out of town. Groaning that it was already 9:30 (past my bedtime) before I headed out, I was definitely not cheery when I got there. On top of the late time, a few other \"bad\" factors weighed in #1 it was hella far for me #2 it was hella cold out there #3 I thought this place was closed from the outside.\n\nBut that all transformed and turned my frown upside down when the food came. The wait was supposedly \"40 mins\" but we got sat down in 10. The waitress wasn't super personable but I forgave her as the guy waiter was super nice. Still groaning, we decided to order one of each of the \"popular\" items. We got the beef kimchi fried rice, seafood casserole, seafood pancake, and the spicy chicken wings.\n\nMy favorites in the following order:\n1) Seafood casserole\n2) Kimchi Fried Rice\n3) Seafood Pancake\n4) Chicken Wings\n\n- Lychee soju which doesn't count so it gets its own category! Delish, didn't taste like alcohol and at $11 a bottle, it can add up but we were glad we ordered it.\n\nThe reason why the chicken wings were ranked the lowest was probably because I was expecting Bon-Chon-esque (for those NE'ers out there, you know what I mean) and would be sauce-y and not super dry. The wings didn't taste bad by any means but I just had a different expectation of what it should taste like. They were kinda small and a little dry to my liking. \n\nFor the seafood casserole though - DELISH. We ordered it as mild and the flavor wasn't water'ed down and had a tinge of sweetness to it. We literally slurped up the whole thing and had to ask the waitress for additional broth for free (which she happily got for us +5 stars!) I think this was my favorite casserole place in all of SF.\n\nKimchi fried rice was delish - as it's hard to mess this up but the little chunks of beef went very well with the dish. She said it was medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all which was perfect for me since I am not a spicy-fan.\n\nThe seafood pancake was also pretty good and not too many onions/scallions and fried very well with a delish dipping sauce.

So I've been coming to Toyose for many years and I come here for the yummy food. Our normal waitresses are the 2 sisters, but we haven't seen them in awhile. It was my brothers birthday and we made a reservation for 4 people. We got to the restaurant and one person got sick and couldn't come. I told this \"new waitress\" that we are here for our 7 o'clock reservation and she walked us to the table. I proceeded to tell her that it's only 3 people now since one person cancelled. She said no, we only take reservations for parties of 4. I explained what happened and she pointed to the board and rudely told us to put our names on the board to wait for a seat. I was surprised at her rude and dismissive response and said \"are you kidding\"? She mocked me and responded \"are YOU kidding\" , laughed and pointed to the board once again. She gave us a poop face and totally snubbed us and walked away. I eat out more than the average person and had numerous experiences at Asian restaurants and never expect great service, but I also never expect to be treated so poorly.

For the casserole, there were an assortment of other things inside that includes, sliced fish balls, squid, shrimp, mushrooms and glass noodles. The seafood pancake was similar to a size of a medium pizza and it definitely got us by surprise.

I have to say I will give them another try another time as I know there are off days and I KNOW my friend has some pretty good tastebuds. \n\nUnfortunately the overall review from this first trip: long wait, hurried order-taking (after waiting for a seat for almost an hour, the wait staff gave me about two minutes to look through the menu and ask me what I wanted, and then came back to me twice more within another two minutes when I asked for more time). I felt a bit rushed for someone who had to wait a while for a seat.\n\nThere was not enough variation of banchan (side dishes) that balanced out each other. The banchan offered were undercooked cubed syrupy potatoes, mushy overboiled kelp, bland kimchee and three sprigs of broccoli with julienned carrots. They lacked acids...too alkaline. \n\nI had overcooked eel that was not fileted properly and was doused in heavy, syrupy and salty sauce (too much sea salt), and my kimchi pancakes were also too salty and tasted more burnt than pan-fried. The dipping sauce was right, though.\n\nEdges were crisp and center was soggy and the underside was dark with a bit too many burn marks. The kimchi used for the pancakes were also bland--it had the heat but the ginger and garlic did not stand out. \n\nHow do I gauge the food? I'm part Korean. I've had Korean food all my life and some fantastic dishes in NY where I grew up and lived most of my life.\n\nAnother note: It was very hot and humid in there too. They needed better ventilation that day. Despite the tight quarters, and camouflaged entrance (retrofitted garage space) it was very friendly and warm and I look forward to giving it another go as I saw some other dishes on other tables that looked good.

My favorite dish of the night was the beef kimchi fried rice with an egg. The seafood pancake was just okay as the batter mostly stuck to the wax paper. The spicy chicken wings were nicely fried, but didn't have much flavor. The different kinds of seafood stews were good, but are mostly similar from one to the next.

I know the bay area isn't exactly known for it's Korean food... this place is pretty good though in comparison.\n\nThe waiters are super nice and accommodating (even after some of our friends got a little rowdy) and it was a pretty good price for everything in the end (split amongst 8 people). Service is pretty quick and responsive too (they have the little service buttons which makes a difference), which is kind of rare I think in Asian restaurants, so props to that.\n\nIt does get a little loud, but we didn't mind (we were probably the loudest there -_- haha). Definitely on my list for cool chill bar/restaurants to go to in the city (for us old people who can't stand the clubs anymore).", "author": "Denise C."}

I've had their kimchi friend rice to-go before but only recently came in to the restaurant itself. Phew! It was quite a drive out here from the Inner Richmond, but it was definitely worth it. \n\nToyose is a cozy little restaurant built in a garage.  You definitely don't expect it to look as it does from the outside. The interior is warmly lit, with a number of booths, though not many, so it does get crowded. My friend and I waited about 15 minutes while the party of 2 behind us had to wait 30-40 minutes at around 8pm.  Get there early!\n\nMany of them menu items looked so delicious but we couldn't possibly order and eat them all, so we settled on 2 items. Kimchi Fried Rice, of course, can't go wrong with that: moist and not too spicy.  Their Seafood and Kimchi Pancake was splendidly delicious; I wish it was a bit crispier, but that's just me being picky. We also had the Calamari and Bulgogi; I honestly did not expect it to be so yummy, but to my surprise it was! The marinade was perfect. \n\nFor drinks, we channeled Beyonce and decided on the Watermelon Soju (...surfbort).  Unlike soju cocktails from other places, Toyose's was super refreshing, not overly sugary and can actually taste the alcohol, and tastes like watermelon should, not that fake generic flavor. I don't even like watermelon but I would recommend it.\n\nService was really on point.  Sometimes when you ask servers for another minute to decide, they come back way too soon or don't come back for too long of a while, but our server came back at an appropriate time so we got our order, food, check, and card back in a timely fashion. As expected of such a crowded restaurant. \n\nI don't often give 5 stars, but I really have no complaints about Toyose. Will be back to try many more menu items!", "author": "Monica V."}

Well, today I am. \n\nIt's a literally a garage with a bird as it's mascot... Upon reading the Korean sign, it roughly translates to the Swallow Room. Birds. \n\nSpeaking of birds, fried chicken is served here. You can get it whole or you can just have wings. But be warned, it's not spicy as it is advertised. I like the crunchiness of it and that's why we order it each time we visit. And as long I'm on the bird thing, I had the opportunity to try to gizzards today and it was amazing. I enjoyed it as much as the wings. \n\nThe kimchi fried rice is something we always order as well, my favorite part is the over easy egg as I feel the rice is lacking kimchi flavor. Another dish I don't enjoy as much is the beef bulgogi. With or without the calamari, I feel they could use a bit more soy sauce in the marinade and leave it to sit for a longer time. This is saying a lot since I don't care for salty food.\n\nAs for stews, you've got to try it. We like adding ramen to our selection. \n\nThe seafood pancake is doughy and chock full of seafood. You will not be disappointed so long as you use the sauce that accompanies it. We were given kimchi pancake by mistake and if it wasn't for that mistake, I would have never tried it. It's crispy and awesome. \n\nFinally the soju. The cocktail sojus are what this place is known for. I've tried most of the flavors and my least favorite so far is the aloe. I don't care for peach and kiwi alone, but I mixed the two together and enjoyed it more. \n\nI would give a full 5 if the wait wasn't so ridic. But it does take reservations so be sure to do that and save an hour of wait time.", "author": "Serinda O."}

I don't think I need to say more.\n\nClam Soup: My favorite soup. It was so light, slightly gingery, and clean-- perfect before a meal. It really washed everything down, since everything else you order is super salty.\n\nKimchi Soup: Ugh I got this thinking it was Kimchi Chige, and that it wouldn't be as salty as it was. I think I used the clam soup to wash this down. It was gooey and was full of sodium.\n \nKimchi Fried Rice: Pretty good, pretty good. It was like your standard Kimchi fried  with an egg on it.\n\nI think the chicken wings and clam soup wins here :) I know that this place gets way packed during the weekend nights, so if you need to tend to your drunk munchies with their bomb chicken wings, order to-go before you get there.

What parking? We had to circle almost 4X and park up the hill and walk over. I guess when it's in sf, you'd have to assume the worst with parking, traffic, wait. The entrance of the restaurant is very grungy since they wooden doors. The seating is extremely small. \n\nThe food takes the cake. We ordered the spicy fried chicken wings. I cannot eat spicy very well, however the wings aren't spicy at all. Mind you that this is not the spicy glazed with the hot pepper sauce.

There were so many items in this. Spam, hotdog, beef, veggies, ramen, rice cake and plenty of broth.

So any Blues Brothers fans out there can literally order four fried chickens and a Coke.\n\nThis place keeps an interesting mix of dishes, but to me it doesn't quite warrant a crosstown trip for dinner. Still, for meeting friends or as the afterparty to whatever, I'd go here any night, though I might wear an eyepatch and bring some Hemingway to read on the way over.\n\nFYI: The signage outside does say both \"Toyose\" and \"Chamse\", but rest assured you are at the right place. People speak of this restaurant using the names interchangeably, so keep that in mind too.", "author": "Dan B."}

First off the fried rice was extremely bland and tasted but only a little kimchi. It had a minuscule amount of beef and was definitely not worth the price. The udon was falsely advertised. The label said assorted seafood but all there was was a loads worth of octopus (~20 pieces) and 2 tiny shrimp, 1 muscle. I personally like octopus but this octopus was tasteless and exceedingly chewy. Couldn't and didn't bother finishing the bowl. \n\nI don't usually write bad reviews but this restaurant had me feel that I wasted my money big time. 11 dollars for tasteless fried rice that had nothing but barely any meat is ridiculous.

This restaurant was built within a house so it looks very house-like outside. The doors to go in is made from past garage doors. For this, I find the outer appearance odd. \n\nApparently, I was in for more surprises. Despite looking odd on the outside, the inside was very impressive. Fashioned with wood decor, it looked really authentic and cozy as a restaurant. A bit cramped, but it still fits a lot of people. You would have never known that it used to be a garage! \n\nService was pretty attentive but forgot one order and then got it wrong after we asked them about it. It wasn't a super big deal, but it was kind of annoying. To be fair, the place has a really loud atmosphere and they seem to be busy very often.\n\nWe ordered two orders of kimchi fried rice, an order of split eel, an order of spicy pork, and one order of kimchi pancake.

We pretty much had to waive them down everytime we needed something (our table was the only one without the call button).\n\nFood:\n\nKimchi pancake 3 stars: it was a pretty decent size, but I didn't think it was worth $11. Might as well pay a couple of dollars more and get the seafood pancake. It comes with this chili fish sauce, which I liked (prbly the Vietnamese in me). The kimchi was cut into really small pieces and you couldn't really taste it (please put more kimchi in it!). \n\nSpicy chicken wings 3.5 stars: good amount of wings for the price.  It's lightly breaded and had a nice crunch to it. I didn't think it was spicy at all and honestly, could've used more seasoning or a sauce to dip it in. I actually dipped it in the sauce that came with my kimchi pancake. I do like that it comes with the pickled radish!\n\nKimchi fried rice 3.5 stars: the portion was decent and I love my sunny side up egg on top. I liked it, but didn't love it. I think it needs more pepper paste and kimchi! \n\nOverall, I thought this place is a bit pricey, but the food is pretty decent. I do want to try their big hot pot thing, the table next to us got one and it looked good.", "author": "Thuy N."}

Options were dwindling. Toyose popped up on my Yelp app and we had never heard of it.\n\nAs we were driving down the road to get there, there were less and less businesses. Where were we going?? We almost missed the place actually. I was about to make a U-turn after seeing the shady dive bar across the street. Good thing we stayed though!\n\nThe outside of the place looks like someone's house and garage. I was a little worried we were in the wrong place, but then you open the door and...\n\n*POOF*... a full blown restaurant?? So. Totally. Amazing. \n\nYou would never think a restaurant was behind those doors! \n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, we were seated and immediately dived into the menu. We went for their spicy fried chicken and beef kimchi fried rice. They seemed like the most popular choices. I sooooo wanted to order soju, but I had work the next day. *sad face*\n\nThe fried chicken was super crispy. Not too spicy. I loved the pickled daikon it came with. \n\nO... M... G... but the beef kimchi fried rice.... sooooooo deliiiicious!! I could eat the whole plate by myself. You can taste the flavor in every piece of rice. There weren't any clumps of rice that missed the seasoning. And the sunnyside up egg enhances everything. It tastes especially delicious with the runny egg yolk coating the rice. There could have been more beef though. \n\nI totally suggest this place if you're looking for a late night hangout. They're open until 2AM. Definitely get the kimchi fried rice.

If it weren't for the awning with TOYOSE written on it, this place would just blend right along with all the other houses next to it.  \n\nWhy?  Because this restaurant is a convert from a resident's garage.  Yup!  However, I must say, they did a pretty good job with the conversion.  Soju?  Check.

All around, it's a decent Korean restaurant.\n\nHowever, I must comment:  The bulgogi was fairly disappointing.

I came to Toyose a few months ago since I kept hearing about those awesome Korean restaurant in the Sunset. We came on a Tuesday night around 9pm, and there was surprisingly still a 10 minute wait at that time! They have some booths at the front of the restaurant, and then a larger area in the back with more tables. I wish we were sat in the front versus the back, since it got a bit steamy in there with so many people and so many tofu stews/casseroles/noodle soup dishes. You definitely walk out smelling not so fresh after dining here. In any case, we ordered:\n\n-Kimchi and Beef Fried Rice w/Egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=98QanNLoRhYdO_sFr3AQgQ#98QanNLoRhYdO_sFr3AQgQ): Good, but nothing special. I liked the fried egg on top, but it was on the salty side.\n-Spicy Chicken Wings ($12.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=98QanNLoRhYdO_sFr3AQgQ#AYxO8k7SJv8MGKmntq6F0Q): Ok, but I didn't think they were that spicy. These are the dry style wings, whereas I like more of a sauce. It also seemed like our wings were slightly overfried.\n-Seafood Pancake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=98QanNLoRhYdO_sFr3AQgQ#M2n1dbaLgkSVriantptJPw): Pretty good, but not much different from your seafood pancake at any other Korean restaurant. However, they didn't skimp on the seafood at least.\n-Cheese Corn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toyose-san-francisco?select=98QanNLoRhYdO_sFr3AQgQ#PtpC_ewNx9-92WDWmKwEMg): Just ok. I didn't think this could ever be a problem, but there was actually too much cheese on the corn! Although you get the nice strings of cheese when you took your spoon of cheese corn, the cheese was still on the hard side. \n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Toyose. However, I do live only 10 minutes away from 30 Korean restaurants (in the South Bay), so I think I have a pretty high standard for Korean food. There weren't any dishes at Toyose that stood out for me, and with the difficulty in finding parking in this area, I don't think I'll be back. However, I do regret not trying one of those giant noodle bowls that every other table seemed to have, so will definitely have to give that a try if I come back.

So I was so happy that I finally got to try toyose. \n\nJust a heads up, you have to gain the attention of the waitress to get your name on the list to be seated. She will not come to you. \n\nThe service here is terrible. We were ignored & I had to ask for everything twice. Not great. But the food is so good!\n\nI opted for the japchae (clear sweet potato noodles with vegetables) and the seafood pancake. Both are so tasty! The japchae is probably one of the best I've had. The seafood pancake, first I've had, was also amazing. It's really filling, so don't let the name fool you. I loved every bite. Portions are also quite generous and prices are pretty standard, about $12-16, for korean entrees at a nice restaurant. \n\nDespite the lack of good service, I would love to come back to try their spicy fried chicken! But believe me, I'll come during down time and be ready for bad service & great food!", "author": "Junel S."}

Calling this place a dive evokes the idea that it's cheap and a hidden gem off the beaten path. Well, that would be a lie on both accounts.

It was well after midnight, he was starving for a really good meal, and we drove a longer distance into the city than usual just to eat at this place because they conveniently close at 2am.\n\nThe wait for our table was about 20-25 minutes. We ordered the kimchi soup and beef kimchi rice plate with a fried egg, and specifically asked our waitress if she can remove any onions cooked into the food. She did tell us the rice plate is prepared with green onions already, but she can have the cooks remove any additional green onions that would be dolloped on top. That was fine for us and we waited patiently for our food.\n\nThe kimchi soup was tasty, but once the rice plate came out the entire thing was cooked with white onions. My boyfriend was disappointed that he couldn't eat any of it. I could eat onions so I was able to have some, however there was so much onions cooked into the dish it was a little overbearing. It would have been more enjoyable had they not put so much, but the kimchi rice itself was good to me.\n\nMy boyfriend decided to order the eel and asked the waitress once again to remove all the onions. After waiting a little bit longer for a third plate, guess what happened? The entire dish was covered in white onions so he couldn't eat any of the eel either. The only thing he ate from this restaurant was soup.\n\nI don't know what was going on, but clearly something was miscommunicated when we asked for no onions on our food.

Our server was fast, and our orders came in bam! bam! bam! Before we knew it, our check was placed on our table--and this is pretty much why I'm giving Toyose a lower rating.\n\nFood is decent but nothing to write home about. Portions also felt small in comparison to local competitors.  My biggest gripe about Toyose is everything feels rushed. Like a McDonalds or a Disney roller coaster line, everything is focused on getting you in and out efficiently. Being a late night Korean restaurant, I was a bit dissapointed in this, since I'm used to the social aspect of places that serve soju (friends, conversation, etc.). Dropping the check off without asking if we wanted more food or drinks moves Toyose from a Korean-restaurant to a Destination-restaurant-to-show-out-of-town-friends.\n\nMaybe we came early and caught the family crowd--you definitely can't catch up on this week's gossip and talk like sailors when you have stuffy-looking multi-gen'ers sitting next to you. It probably didn't help our experience being seated near the restroom, either. After the second person, I tried to avoid eye contact each time someone came out--you know, giving them that look of, \"Oh, you're the guy who just spent 10 minutes dropping a double flusher...Nice to meet you.

In fact, I was planning a trip here for the past month. I lots of Yelp reviews and talked about it with some friends.\n\nWe planned to come here on a Saturday arriving at about 7:00PM (The place opens at 6:00PM). We called for a reservation at 6:00PM but they only take reservations for parties of 4 or more. It was just the 2 of us so we thought that we'd still get seated with only a minor wait, if that.\n\nWhen we arrived there, I was damn excited since the exterior lived up to it's hole-in-the-wall atmosphere (the best kinds of places to eat in my opinion). When we entered the place, it did look like a fixed-up garage, kinda cool. I first saw people seated/eating and other tables with reservation signs on them.\n\nAnyway, when you walk into a restaurant, you usually expect a podium and a host/hostess to seat you or at least put you on a list if there's a wait. And who wouldn't mind a short wait for a restaurant they've been anticipating--it's probably well worth it.\n\nInstead of the typical event that I just described, when we walked in, there was NO podium and there was NO host/hostess. What happened was that we walked in and we were just confused because it wasn't a traditional restaurant entrance. We stood for about 30 seconds not knowing what to do. There wasn't even chairs or anything to sit on to wait. It's like you just have to leave if you don't have a damn reservation. Then as a waitress finished serving a table near us, she began walking away to the kitchen, turned around towards us, and in a REALLY rude manner/tone, she said, \"Ummm, it's going to be an hour wait.\"\n\nNow, in any other setting, this would be fine, and I would happily wait to pay money for their product/service. But what I actually heard from this b*tch was, \"Ummm, just leave, you're not Korean, you should just get out of here because even if you wait 1 hour, I'm going to make you wait another 30 minutes so you can just leave.\" Seriously, that's what I think she was trying to say. F*cked up right? She didn't even fully turn around to tell us this. I felt belittled and as if we weren't even worth it to turn around fully and tell us something like, \"I'm sorry, it's going to be a long wait since we're pretty booked tonight, please have a seat and I'll let you know when a table is ready.\" How about saying that? Is a customer only worth a 2-second line? Do we have to be of Korean descent? Seems that way.\n\nAfter much planning to eat here and rave about it to friends, this happened so we left and went elsewhere, shocked.

Ok our fault for not calling to update the reservation but when have you ever been to a restaurant where the waitress rolls her ugly eyes at you because your entire party didn't show up?!?\n1) if you're prettier maybe I will just stare at your pretty face and ignore your eyes rolling rudely at us but have your checked the mirror lately!!! 2) you must not have had any customer service training in your entire life!!!!\n\nWe ended canceling our order and walked out! \n\nTo sum it up- horrible customer service x100! Rude staff! Decent food only. People -if you are looking for Korean food, there are plenty of good spots even in the sunset. Please no need to pay for a restaurant with such terrible customer service.", "author": "Eileen P."}

I think it's important to know that you will NEED to bring someone Korean with you to get the full experience.  If you've been here with and without one before, you'll know what I mean.\n\nThe food gets 5 stars.  The service is dependent on whether there's a Korean at your table.  The alcohol content in your drinks will also vary depending on the same factor.\n\nIt's pretty typical to expect this kind of treatment from a Korean restaurant, so it doesn't bother me too much, but it definitely keeps it from being a 5 star rating.\n\nWhen I come here with Korean friends, the mood from the waitresses is upbeat, drinks are wickedly stronger, and being of age isn't questioned.  When I visited more recently with non-Koreans, serving staff attitude was apathetic, drinks were like juice, and we were aggressively carded (I don't mind being carded, but everyone should be treated the same).\n\nThe last gripe I have, is that for the portions, it's pretty expensive... but when is Korean food not?  I know this all sounds pretty negative, but it's not.  I'm just sure people have said enough positive things about this place and I definitely would always be down to come here for food and drinks.  Just straying a bit from my typical review style to let people know what's up.\n\nDO realize that this place gets pretty busy at night and that you can call to make reservations.

First, if you're going with a big group, go early, or be ready for a minimum 1 hour wait.  Second, if you're coming here, be prepared to be ignored by the waitresses... multiple times.  I can't stand this place and their service and I would try to avoid this place. I had to ask for things multiple times and they never showed up, such as napkins or drinks, and even the bill took forever to come.  The waitresses are rude... and get annoyed when you ask them for anything... I understand it gets busy, but the attitude is just unnecessary.\n\nAlthough the service is really bad, the food makes up for it... kinda?  But not really.  Every table gets served popcorn as a little appetizer, which is interesting, and goes good with the soju. I've tried their kimchi fried rice, which is served with a sunny side egg on top and nori.  Taste flavorful, but a little bit on the soggy side.  The chicken wings are really good though, very crispy and hot, made to serve when you order.  It also comes with daikon, which goes well with the crispy/saltiness of the chicken.  I think that was the best dish for sure.  The spicy pork was too chewy in my experience, and it was O-K.  The spicy rice cake is bland and I would not suggest in ordering it.  I have to say that the food here is better than other soju bars in SF, but there are better korean joints out there for sure.  \n\nThe SOJU.   Only place that I've gotten the kiwi soju and been excited to drink it all.  Has \"real\" kiwi seeds in it, sweet and mild alcohol.  They have other flavors too, such as yogurt and lychee that I have tried.  If you're tryna get turnt, best to order a few more bottles...  \n\nBut in the end, does the food compensate for the service?   NO.

It has a pretty cool vibe being in a converted garage. It was also a lot bigger than I thought it was gonna be.\n\nFOOD: The food that we ordered was pretty solid for SF korean food. Spicy fried chicken was okay. Great crunch, but not too much flavor that went along with it. It just tasted lightly salty with just a touch of heat. Not exactly bursting with flavor. The budaejjigae (spam casserole stew or something?) was absolutely amazing. Big kimchi flavors in the soup with spiciness. It was slightly heavy, which was perfect to me. Standard soup ingredients like hot dogs, spam, and kimchi. There were small rice cakes in there which were perfect to me in the soup. We also ordered calamari and bulgogi which was okay. The calamari did not have a lot of flavor. The bulgogi was where all the flavor was at and it all sort of just fell to the bottom. It was not exactly easy to get some of that flavor onto the calamari. I ended up having to scrape the bottom to get the flavors that I wanted. Lastly, we ordered the kimchi fried rice. It was good, not great. This may have been because I did not choose to ask for gochujjang, which is generally what I like to add to my kimchi fried rice but that's just my preference. I think I also kept yearning for more egg in my bites of fried rice.\nWe also ordered watermelon soju, and strawberry soju. Let's be honest, most soju drinks are delicious. These are no exception.\n\nOverall, great place with a pretty cool feel. I'd probably come here to drink sooner or later or just come back for that budaejjigae", "author": "Bryant C."}

The saving grace was the seafood pancake which was decent, but I'm not really fond of appetizers being the highlight of the meal.

Mission accomplished.  \n\nThe restaurant:  Toyose was a cool lil space.  And it's lil for sure... I'd recommend getting there before 7 if you want a table with no wait.  That being said, I love the rough look and the fact that it's open until 2am.  Late-night joints are the best! Also, they have those cool lil service buttons and privacy mats you can lower around your table... at least the ones in the front.\n\nThe casserole:  Not really my thing.  I'd rather have Kim Chi Ji Gae, which is so delicious to me.  I don't see the point of this casserole.  It was good I guess, but not delicious.  Also, the meats seemed to cook weird.  The octopus was still weirdly chewy and the beef got too cooked even after we turned off the heat (10 min like she said).  Too bad.. squid and octopus are top choices of mine!  \n\nWe probably should've stuck with our favorites.  Oh jing oh duk bok ki, galbi, bulgogi and bibimbap.

Those of you that might be wondering what the deal is with KFC (not the Colonel Sander's kind), just Google it and you'll understand what I mean. I'm used to eating BonChon, KyoChon, or Boom Boom chicken in the east coast where the twice-fried chicken wings are glazed in spicy soy sauce. However, Toyose does things a bit differently. They fry the chicken wings twice so that the skin is crunchy, while keeping things juicy on the inside, but it's not glazed in any sauce, other than its spicy salt and pepper. It sounds simple, but it is quite possibly the best fried chicken you'll ever have.", "author": "JD K."}

The wait can be at least 30 - 60 minutes long. \n\nThe spicy chicken was fine, it wasn't memorable and not spicy at all. I nibbled on two and took the rest home to the little puppy. No sauce to dip the wings in. Sad story. Nice broth in the tofu soup but I've had better. The pork plate he got was okay. He ended up getting a horrible case of food poisoning that night.

I have many Korean family members and I've been to quite a few Korean restaurants, this place is just a hang-out for the 20 year old's. The only saving grace may be the Mango Soju. We ordered 3 dishes; the seafood pancake, the spicy pork and the seafood tofu stew/soup. The pancake was limp and flavorless, the spicy pork was also limp and possibly raw as I became extremely ill 30 minutes after eating, and the stew was special. The spicy pork was the most flavorless, un-spicy pork I have ever had in any Korean restaurant. And like other yelpers stated, the service is non-existent. You have to ask for the banchan and if they bring it to you all you get is some potatoes, kimchee, beansprouts and fishcake. Four dishes of banchan. \n\nDon't bother coming here, the food made me sick and was barely edible.", "author": "Terri Y."}

There was some interesting stuff I noticed on the menu as well.. Fish liver? Ahaha I didn't try it but maybe next time.\n\nMy friends rang the button on the side to get some service and I found that pretty cool! Didnt know there was a service button. They failed to come to our table an went to another table instead because they did not know who rang it..we rang it again and it was fine this time.\n\nAside from all this, the place was pretty crowded for a Wednesday night!

This converted garage to restaurant is cozy, but more than sufficient.\n\nWe wanted to try so many items, but the waitress said that we already had more than enough. Portions are pretty good and naturally we ended up bringing most home. Kimchi beef fried rice is a must order. I've had kimchi fried rice at several places in Hawaii, but this one was a hand down winner. Next was beef bulgogi - tasty, especially with squid, but not something to drive over for. Jap Chae - always a must have for us, we can never get enough. This one was great, without the overload of oil. Fried chicken - yes, chicken as in WHOLE chicken. Nicely deep fried, yet moist inside. This one is head to head with KFC. Seafood pancake - another nice selection, this is great with the \"spicy\" dipping sauce. The sauce looks spicy but is actually pretty mild. Don't get this pancake mixed up with the texture of Chinese pancake. This Korean pancake is a different batter altogether.\n\nThe waitress \"call button\" on the wall is a nice touch to avoid having to flag down the waitress.

When my friends (first timer) went to get a table, they were so confused as to where the entrance was. HILARIOUS! love them. But I've been here two times now, and two times were on point! I recently came here with my college buddies, and one of them is a vegetarian. Hmmm, I thought, this might be a little tricky, cause when you think of korean, its bulgogi, spicy pork, and even bibimbap has meat in it... so we were thinking all out tofu and kimchi!

When I asked him, do you have any vegetarian dishes, he was caught by surprise LOL but still suggested some very delicious dishes. \n\nWe had:\nKimchi pancake (first off, this was already my favorite, and was gonna order it anyway- i'm telling you, it's a MUST!! the best kimchi pancake ever!!! it's crispy yet soft, omggggg i want one now!)\n\nCheese corn- haha so no one at the table knew what cheese corn is, it's actually exactly when it says, corn topped with melted mozzarella and baked.... nom nom nom, but you have to eat this when its out, or it'll get hard, but overall yummy!\n\nJapchae or aka korean glass noodle- so flavorful even with no meat, so i can't imagine how much better it is with the meat in it :D \n\nTofu Soup- it comes out piping hot served on the stone, so be careful. Soooo flavorful, a little hint of spicy, but delish, my favorite part was the tofu, big chunks of it, yum!!\n\nChicken Wings, omg! how could i forget you! THAT WAS SO BOMB! I can eat it everyday, beats KFC, POPEYES by miles!! so tender and crispy. Never knew korean chicken wings would be so yummy, i'm sold! \n\nYogurt Soju, I had two shot glasses that night, couldn't drink too much, gotta drive after, but it was as always yummy! :) \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place, but i don't think you'd need my recommendation as this place is already a hit itself, i loved it and will definitely come back :)", "author": "Cindy C."}

We called in 2 days in advance to reserve, making sure that a garage would have enough space for a huge party AND still able to serve other guests.  The lady on the phone was really nice.  I made the reservation for 9pm on Saturday night.  And she inform me that the whole party should be present at 9pm.\n\nOn the day of, 13 of us arrived at 8:40pm.  We actually got there on time and early cause finding parking was easy, luckily.  We parked a block away and walked to the restaurant.  2 of us went in and told them we were here, but apparently was told we were too early.  So we all waited outside for about 10 minutes and check back at 9pm.  And was told again to wait another 10 minutes.  Okay, I guess this didn't bother me TOO much since we were just chilling outside anyways, but most of us were pretty hungry.  Plus, shouldn't the table be ready if you told us not to be late? \n\nWhen we were finally seated, I realized there was only 2 girls working in the whole restaurant...ok thats probably why.  \n\nWe all decided what we wanted and ordering was quick.  Couple dishes worth mentioning:\n\nkimchee fried rice - Portion was okay.  I think it was around $10/ plate.  It wasn't that spicy at all, but I did like the texture of the rice.  \n\nSpicy chicken wings - delicious! Not really spicy if you ask me, since I can eat pretty spicy.  But the way it was fried was perfect.  I liked it alot.  There was probably around 10 wings in a order?  Our whole table ordered 3 orders to share.\n\nLast but not least...SOJU!\nWe ordered 7 bottles of soju total.  2 bottles of aloe, 1 of strawberry, 1 of kiwi, 1 of peach, and 1 of yogurt, and 1 of mango. \n\nAloe - my favorite!  there were actual aloe pieces in there! Plus it tasted just like the aloe juice you buy from korean markets. :)\n\nstrawberry - tasted yummy.  strawberry flavor was strong.  You almost cant taste the alcohol.\n\nYogurt - wasnt as good as i expect, but it was still delicious.  Have you ever had the yogurt drink?  You'll know what im talking about.\n\nMango, Peach, and Kiwi were a okay.  Kiwi didn't taste much like kiwi.  Probably my least favorite.  \n\nEach bottle was $11.  They DO check ID, and they give out shot glasses according to the amount of people who showed ID.  They serve water in a large size plastic looking water bottle.  \n\nTotal time taken for the meal : 1 Hour 45 mins.\nHow much? $279 w/ gratuity\n\nHappy soju Birthday!", "author": "Stephy L."}

We got the usual yogurt, but the pineapple was the winner of the night.\n\nThe Stir Fried Octopus (Nak-ji Bo-kum, I think?) was really good, although some people might be turned off by the inside of the octopus tentacles being slightly undercooked - mmmm squishy goodness.  The Seafood Pancake was also delicious with lots of seafood, although it stuck to the paper below.  The Kimchi Fried Rice with bulgogi was good but small and had more beef than kimchi flavor, although admittedly I prefer spam with my kimchi fried rice.  The Spicy Chicken Wings were very crispy and burning hot but not spicy at all.   The Ddukboki (+$2 each for egg or fishcakes or ramen?!) was just alright - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best, but thumbs up for being extra spicy.\n\nAll dishes run around the standard $10 for Korean joints, as were the Soju Cocktails.  Surprisingly, we got seated within 15 minutes even though we were quoted a 30-60 minute wait time around 8PM Saturday - yay for people giving up in front of us!

I hate it when people don't bring cash when you warn them beforehand!\n\nI had my birthday dinner here in 2010 and have been here for different friend get-togethers. It really is random that this place is in a garage, but once you experience it, the novelty wears off and you no longer accidentally drive by the place and enjoy the place for it's lively atmosphere and food. The area in the back can get kind of hot, with all the steam from the food, people crammed in and lack of windows, so dress appropriately. They take their reservations seriously here and will not give your table way 30 minutes before your reservation to some other party you'd have to subsequently wait for to finish. I always end up ordering the same thing here: garlic fries with cheese, spicy wings and kimchee fried rice. The fries are ALWAYS the last thing to come out, so save room for them or ask your server that they be brought out first. Cheese is sooooo flavorful and packed on there. The food can be a bit pricey, so definitely order family-style so you get some variety to your order and experience.\n\nI would say service here is great considering the tight space and the loud groups they have to juggle - they tend to give you everything you need at your table all at once(large water bottle, utensils, plates, etc) and you can just ring the server doorbell at your table if you need anything else. Place can get packed after 10pm and if you're sitting in the front, be prepared to have an audience anxiously awaiting for you to finish your food. Great place to bring out of town visitors to since it has the shock and awe factor and the food and drinks do not disappoint. One bottle of soju per person usually suffices ($11/bottle so very affordable). \n\nSoju Analysis: \nLove the strawberry and kiwi. Definitely must get flavors that will please the whole table.\nFlavors that were A-OK: peach, pineapple, yogurt (mix the yogurt in with strawberry)\nStay away from Lemon - it tastes like floor cleaner.\n\nIt was just my boyfriend and I once and we were barely making a dent in the soju since he was driving and I didn't want to drink too much, so I asked the server if we could take it to go-- I felt stupid asking, but I had to (since you never know and the restaurant is already so unconventional)!

I usually get typical dishes such as Japchae, chicken wings, and tofu soup.  Don't expect to get great service there.  Sometimes, the waiters give off a grumpy vibe.

Lo and behold, it is. It's a house-turned-restaurant. Small and quaint with K-pop music playing in the background. The ambiance has a mellow feel (when we went, there wasn't a whole lot of people) mood, with the lighting not so bright, unlike some other Korean restaurant joints. It is fairly small, and probably holds about a total of 25+ ppl.\n\nFood wise: when I went there not too long ago, same friend and I ordered their chicken wings, the seafood pajeon (pancake), tteukkbokki (rice cake in spicy sauce) and their spam kimchi fried rice. All were in good sized portions. All tasted great, especially the spam kimchi fried rice. The pajeon was a bit too oily for my taste, but that's just me. Still tasty, seeing as my friend devoured that and the wings. Lol\n\nMust try the beef kimchi fried rice next time I stop by as well as their flavored soju drinks.", "author": "Shall P."}

This place is on the smaller side. I'd say it has 20 tables total.\nEverything's a little cramped with a larger group. Also you won't be seated till all members of your party are here. Found that out the hard way when 5 of our 7 were here and they wouldn't seat us till the remaining two showed up. Luckily they were able to beat the clock and arrive before our table was passed off. I understand that process, but if the majority of our group is here, we should be allowed to sit.\n\nWe were all starved so we went a little crazy with the food. Ordered the spicy pork, kimchi friend rice, the stew, chicken gizzards, and MULTIPLE fried chickens.\n\nThe spicy pork was delicious. Tons of flavor. We actually ordered 3 of these and they were a hit. The kimchi friend rice was standard and good. The stew was a good choice; they bring in a burner and place the pot on top. You watch and manage the stew cook. It had a variety of stuff. The thing that stood out was the octopus. Lot of the people with me were weary of trying the chewy tentacles, but in the end they succumbed to my convincing. The chicken gizzards were also the standard variety. Simply friend and served with the salt dipping sauce on the side.\n\nNOW the fried chicken was awesome. We ordered 5 plates of this throughout the night. It was juicy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. Perfectly cooked. It. Was. Great.\n\nThough it might've been the pure hunger talking.... Or the copious amounts of soju we had consumed.\n\nSpeaking of soju, they offer a nice selection of flavored soju. Yogurt, mango, strawberry, pineapple, peach, and aloe. We ordered the yogurt, strawberry, pineapple, and peach. From what I remember, the strawberry and the mango were the best. Order numerous bottles of it. The pineapple is worth passing on. Peach and Yogurt were good, but still preferred the other two. They were all well balanced. Not strong, and not too sweet. That perfect blend of dangerousness. You can't feel it so you keep drinking more. And next thing you know you wake up at home with fried chicken crumbs on your face.\n \n But that isn't necessairly a bad thing now is it.", "author": "Karma B."}

The Kimchi fried rice is average, you can get it at Bart Grocery for cheaper with more portion. The chicken wings are alright too, ask for a side of the salad dressing to dip it in since it can be dry. The tempura calamari is good too. \nAs for aspects aside from the food, I'm not a stickler on wait, it's pretty much to be expected in SF, but depending on when you go it could range anywhere from 10min-1hour.

Two: there are privacy blinds that you can roll down at each table. Three: even though service buttons are prevalent at the table for Korean restaurants, its always a plus when I find a place that has one. Four: my ultimate test of any Korean restaurant is how crispy they make their seafood pancake, and this place passes my test!\nOf course we got the fried chicken wings. They had a crunchy coating and moist interior. My surprise favorite was the gyoza, they were also deep fried and delicious. I was surprised they were handmade of course this made me like them even more. The spicy pork came out sizzling on a hot plate and satisfied my craving for bulgogi (they don't have Korean bbq specials) and was a crowd favorite. Very reasonably priced, and large portions.

She dragged the BF and I there since safety is better in numbers...and besides, there's no English on the outside!  She needed her Asian power beside her in case she got turned away! =)\n\nToyose is located very much in the garage of a home and as you enter the door, you're not sure what to think.  Tables line up the left side and in the back.  A waitress came out to ask if she could help us, detecting our newness to this establishment.  We asked if they were still serving and she gave us the first table closest to the door.  (A bad choice since every time someone walks in, you get a huge draft!)\n\nWe ended up ordering 05. Calamari & Beef (Bulgogi) & Vegetables in Sweet Soy Sauce ($13.95), 42. Home Style Seafoods & Green Onion Pancake ($10.95), and two bottles of mango yogurt soju ($11/each).\n\nThe dishes were pretty grub and were a decent size to share for the three of us. Lorna D's choice of mixing up her favorite yogurt and mango soju was yummy too.\n\nAs the late night drew on and closing time was near, we had a feeling this place doesn't close at its advertised 2 am.  Young kids were still piling in as we were finishing up our food, so I think as long as business is good, they'll keep the food and drink coming.\n\nMy one complaint is that when we were ordering, I asked for hot water (I was coming down with a cold!) and the waitress told me they didn't have any. She explained they were closing up and they don't have any hot water.  (Uh...okay...)  Getting more regular water and more soju was a pain later on since we had to get up and look for the waitress.  (She was snoozing in one of the tables with the blinds lowered down!)\n  \nNonetheless, it's worth checking this place out.

(I came around 6:15 pm.) The exterior is so nondescript, but the interior will surprise you! The space feels much bigger, and it almost has a nautical theme. I tried the beef kimchi fried rice, fried chicken wings, croquettes, and cheese corn. The best thing I had was the kimchi fried rice. The chicken wings were good and really crispy, but I wish they were spicier. The croquettes were perfectly crisp and had a katsu sauce on it. And the corn cheese was like corn fondue.

Inside was dark and had a good ambience. Service was just excellent. I loved how the tables had a call button and then they would respond to your call in less than 5 seconds. I had the Kim chee fried rice which was really good, usually I can't really handle spicy food but this one wasn't too spicy and I was able to devour it entirely. I also had the cheese corn which was really juicy and covered with a thick white cheese and it was incredible. Overall food was great, ambience and look of the place was quite special, and service was top notch. Can't wait to come back and try the soju next time.", "author": "Stephen C."}

With that aside, the food here is great. The wings...they are absolutely worth ordering each time you come here. Actually, if this is your first time here your number 1 priority is to order their wings.\n\nAs for the not so good, I'd say the gizzards and the casserole portion. The gizzards were still good, but compared to everything else it was definitely not up to par. It's something I probably wouldn't order again. As for the casserole, it's very deceiving. It looks like you're getting a hot pot that can serve 4 or 5 people, but if that's your intention, you might want to think about ordering more side dishes. If you're a party of 2, you could probably finish it with some side dishes. \n\nThe soju is pretty good. I think of all of them yogurt, mango, and pineapple were the best. Strawberry, although tempting, I wouldn't order. It's not that good. And stiffness, it's one of the easiest to drink and I'm not sure if it was because we had a lot of food, but the soju is on the light side. \n\nJust a FYI, don't expect to get seated without your full party.", "author": "Wilson T."}

The different sojus were okay, but the food definitely was ehh.\n\nLike someone else said, it is a small place that has some cute decorations but all in all, very cramped. Most people just stand and wait to be seated in the entrance but this also blocks some of the tables and although there are screens to block the two sides, I think I would be a little irritated if I sat there. The wait time was not so bad since it was a Friday night...we probably waited for 20 minutes at most?\n\nThe servers are very nice - 1 star for them! They were cool to talk to...I definitely appreciate good customer service.\n\nOn to the food and drinks. They have a wide variety of soju - we got the strawberry, kiwi, pineapple, mango and aloe flavors. At least that's what I think we got. Other than the strawberry, I didn't like the others too much, so that's my excuse for not remembering the flavors. However, they surprisingly have more alcohol than I imagined so if your goal is to get tipsy, these are definitely for you. \n\nWe ordered kimchi fried rice, whole fried chicken and labokkhi (sorry i never know how to spell this word!). I've definitely had better regarding all three dishes. The fried chicken was extremely and ridiculously dry. The labokkhi was very watered down - I can't really eat spicy food but I would rather have it spicy than so watered down that the flavor was just lacking. I don't have something in particular to say about the kimchi fried rice, other than I've had way better.\n\nI don't think I would come back for the food, but the soju was okay and the atmosphere was okay as well. All in all, I think there are better places like this elsewhere that I would rather pay (a lot) for.", "author": "Cathy C."}

The tofu and kim chee was probably my favorite because I love kim chee. The corn and cheese was literally a plate of melted mozzarella cheese with corn mixed in. It was nuts. Once you grabbed a spoonful the cheese would harden into a ball like substance. Kind of like playdo. The large beer was insane.

After hearing about this place so much from my bf when he used to come here for drunk food.  I think Korean food is okay, but I'm not a huge fan & I think it's typically the most expensive Asian cuisine & I also don't care for kimchi, but my friend she didn't either and told me this place is worth a try.  I was also reassured that this isn't your traditional Korean place.  \n\nWe ordered Beef Kimchi Fried Rice & the Spicy Chicken Wings.  And of course we got a bottle of Strawberry Soju!  I asked the waitress if they could make it medium spicy, and she responded to me, \"They're not spicy at all, I promise.\"  I wasn't expecting that but thought it was cute of her to say.  She was right though they weren't spicy at all; they  but still tasty & perfectly crispy.  We also enjoyed the accompanying shredded cabbage due to the yummy dressing it was topped with which reminded me sort of a spicy Thousand Island dressing, but not rich like Thousand Island.  The soju was delicious and tasted like fresh strawberry juice with no taste of alcohol in taste is good, and bad for my fruity alchie loving tongue!  That soju is always a creeper!  It's also fairly cheap compared to other places I've been, it's $11 here vs. $15 at other places.  The Beef Kimchi Fried Rice came topped with an over easy egg.  It didn't taste like the usual kimchi, which I appreciate because I find that kimchi is usually too vinegary/hot for me.  Overall we enjoyed our dishes, the soju, the banchan and the complimentary popcorn.  The portions were a good size too.\n\nMost of the time service was prompted by the service bell (which I felt bad for pressing a few times because I think it's sort of demeaning/annoying), but the waitresses provided efficient and pleasant service with a smile.  I'm glad the bf suggested Toyose for dinner last night.  It did not disappoint and I would definitely come back.    I do like Korean BBQ, which they don't have, but that may be a good thing since the first time I ever got drunk way back in the day at this one party had to do with a whole lotta booze & a whole lotta Korean BBQ beef, but no carbs, needless to say it was all bad, & I wouldn't want any repeat incidents to tarnish my thoughts of Toyose, so I'm just going to call no KBBQ on the menu a blessing in disguise!", "author": "Cat C."}

The food probably isn't going to blow you away compared to other Korean restaurants in the city.  But it's still pretty damn tasty, and you could certainly do worse.  Yes, it is a shade on the high side, but you can't blame them.  This isn't your usual sort of restaurant since the majority of their business comes after the traditional dinner hours.  Rather, it's a place to eat AND drink (or more appropriately, it's a place to eat while you drink), so naturally it makes some sense to make some money on people's alcohol driven appetites.\n\nThe most popular of the dishes has got to be their Fried Chicken Wings.  All battered up, these crunchy little things are great.  They actually come out pretty good too, unlike some places where it's just a weird flavored batter around dried out pieces of meat.  The Seafood Pancake is also another personal favorite to share, although it's a little oily.  I really like the Kimchi fried rice too and it's pretty up there in terms of quality you can find in the city.  Definitely one of the better ones I've come across.  Oh, and don't forget to get some bottles of soju cocktials - preferably pineapple and strawberry.

First of all, there were only 4 banchan dishes: bean sprouts, kimchee, pickled daikon, and seaweed. LAME. No jap chae? WTH? I didn't even see it on the menu! Nor was LA Kalbi on the menu! YOU CALL THIS A KOREAN RESTAURANT!? BLASPHEMOUS. I only tried the daikon and it was so-so..a litle too vinegary. \n\nMoving on... I have had better KimChee Fried Rice. It was not entirely flavorless but wasn't very spicy or memorable. It was just okay. Udon was probably the best part even though the octopus was extra chewy. Soup base was similar in flavor to Miso. A-OK. Cod and Tofu Soup....DON'T EVEN BOTHER. There was cod (which tasted a bit old to me), tofu, and vegetables sure.. but the rest of it is just soup base with a fat load of chili dumped in. I can mostly taste the chili is all. If your'e thinking of that bubbly loaded tofu concoction found at traditional Korean restaurants, then boy have you found the wrong place to dine tonight. \n\nSo in conclusion, best thing about Toyose is the random location inside a house..and the decor is not so bad. It is pretty cozy inside. The service is okay. Did I mention the wait was like 30-35 minutes for our food? We came as it was opening and there were already lots of people inside so I suppose we ordered at the same time. Overall I wouldn't say my experience was horrible, just below average.

We tried a octo stew with an udon-type noodle in a fairly mild version of one of korea's 863 chili sauces that really got everything off to a great start.... well, except for the cheesy chopsticks that seem to always break in the middle when you separate them, and the 3\" plates that are supposed to politely receive the temptations served... come on... this is BIG USA!!! Bring on those BIG PLATES!  the little plates may have slowed us down but could not prevent us from eating too much of the savories like kimchee fried rice (A+ comfort food) or the house deepfried chicken (CRUNCH!) or the value special, the seafood pancake.  Seriously the octo stew and the seafood pancake could each feed four with a side of rice.  \n\nVery friendly and hardworking staff... not sure why they have a \"CALL\" button located just above each table.  You know how much you want to push those, just because.  If I can resist, you can too.\n\nShoju cocktails for those who like shoju. I am wary of shoju from business drinking parties in Asia, and keep a very respectful distance.  I like to keep the delicious food I eat and I'm DD to boot.  \n\nWorth the trip no matter how you make it.

I could have sworn that a small group of hipsters simply walked in and got a table before us and a number of other groups.  That's not cool and totally unacceptable in my book.\n\n3)  expensive:  for what you get the food here is kind of expensive.\n\nThe saving grace to this place is the variety of soju drinks it has.

I couldn't really imagine it in my head when people said \"it's built in a garage\", but that's what it is.  They took the ground floor of a Sunset house and made it into a restaurant.  Really interesting start.  We called beforehand and got a table in about 10 minutes.   \n\nI let my friends order food, and we ended up with some kimchi fried rice, chicken wings, a rice cake dish, a \"casserole\", and some soju.

Did it deliver? Totally. That said, I think it's hard to equate my 4 star review of this place with a 4 star review I'd provide for a place in LA (Koreatown). We need to take context, value, and quality all into consideration when we rate places, right? \n\nThe place had pretty decent food (albeit everything was very mild, even when we asked for things to be spicy... but I suspect that was due to the fact that our small group was quite ethnically diverse), service was very courteous and understanding despite being strained & sluggish at times, and the decor... well, it's a garage-y place that's meant to be a drinking, eating, and conversation inducing establishment so it. just. makes. sense.\n\nIt's not Ktown-LA food. Nor is it even SJ Korean food. But I'd say that the quality and attitude of the place is better than 95% of the other Korean places in the city of SF.\n\nNotable good deeds:\n- Seafood Pajun (A-, solid and the seafood was fresh, not rubbery or skimpy)\n- Kimchi fried rice (B, overpriced for the portion size, but everyone loved it. it's like Korean Mac and Cheese... comfort food)\n- Tempura (B+, not korean but hey, who dislikes fried food?)\n- Seafood Jungol (B, solid and it's the only non-spicy large format soup there was on the menu. very approachable for all non veterans of Korean food)\n\nDonate your sixpence to the poor:\n- Tong Dahk, \"whole chicken\" (C-, it was really really really dry. it may be better on other occasions, but it sure as heck wasn't good on this one.)\n- Kimchi Tofu (C, not much meat in the dish... just not impressive - I had to order it. I missed eating this sort of stuff in LA)\n- Cocktail sojus (B/C-, because while the table liked it, I kept telling them how little soju there was vs. the filler drinks. it's a matter of value... I don't think it's worth it to drink something that would lead me to a cavity sooner than get me drunk).\n\nWhy the 4 stars? Because even if the food wasn't top notch, nor was the service spectacular, the service staff of 2 was really pleasant and tried their best to take care of a packed house and served food that, although at times missed the mark, was made with fresh ingredients in a very relaxed environment.. so much so, that I would ALMOST be willing to drive out there on a weeknight after work. Yes, kids, this place is hella far from civilization. :)\n\nSidenote: Um, for those of you confused about the bell button to call staff: That's what we call: evolution. It's ALL over the place in KTown, JTown, and is now spreading to random downtown gastropubs. What's more is that it isn't even new: I've seen it in the US for over a decade and has been used throughout Korea/Japan for... well, longer. \n\nThen again, I suppose some people would rather wave their hands wildly to flag down a server. I, for one, prefer to press a button and go back to my conversation (ahem, food bowl/booze) with my friends until a waiter/waitress pops up. To each their own.", "author": "Jae O."}

Personally, the best part of having Korean food are the banchans! I think it's strange that they only give you popcorn- it reminds me of going to a BAR in Korea, not a restaurant. My boyfriend doesn't like Toyose as much as me, but this is mostly because we steer towards different Korean flavor profiles. While they offer my favorites, his VERY TRADITIONAL favorite is nowhere to be found- bibimbap, no kimbap either! So without the BANCHAN, or bibimbap on the menu... this is not a complete Korean restaurant. The popcorn shows that they'd rather be seen as a bar, not a restaurant.

The food here is banged out fast and hot, and the servers (cute Korean chicks BTW) are fast and efficient. the problem with the wait are all the damn people sitting around and leaving when the last chicken has been eaten and the last drop of delicious mango soju has been drunk. \n\nWhen we got in around 800PM, there was this large group of Taiwanese lesboz sitting eating and drinking, and probably decide in whose rug to munch on later that night. They are my own people, so the Prince of Taiwan can make fun. \n\nWhen we left around 9:30Pm, those chicks were still there!

There was this one dude dressed like Asian Justin Timberlake with his fedora, vest, and slim pants hitting on a bunch of ladies.

It's also quite genius to rest the Rice Cakes on top of Ramen noodles -- they really help to catch more of the yummy spicy sauce. Also, soak some of that sauce up with the Kimchi Fried Rice for some extra spicy-ness! In the end, we ordered the buckwheat noodle salad thing. It was a nice finish since it was seriously a plate of different veggies -- very cooling to the palate -- with cold buckwheat noodles (looks like zhazhangmyun) and cold pork.

We also ordered the seafood hot pot, which ... unfortunately was a little average. The mussels were real chewy and it was just OK.

It's a garage-turned-restaurant with some of the best, affordable Korean food ever.\n\nMy favorite dishes include: \n* Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Egg\n* Seafood Pancake (relatively light and pleasingly thin and crispy) \n* Potstickers (great crunch on the skin with a warm core of tender meat)\n* Fried Chicken Wings\n\nI also love, love, love their Strawberry-flavored soju.  Their sojus are made with fresh fruits and are sweet to my liking.\n\nI came here again last night for a friend's birthday, ordered 3 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 pitcher of beer, and only paid $15 (with tax and 18% gratuity).

The best eats are the ones that are least flashy.\n\nThis is a good place for some quality Korean food, decent portions, and medium-size parties.  Portions are family-style-friendly, so I would say order to share.  Of course the first time I came here I finished a Spam Fried Rice on my own, so depending on your appetite you may not want to take my word for it.  What's good here?  My faves are the sticky rice stick/ramen noodle thing, the cheese corn, and the fried rice.  The fried chicken is decent too, but I don't count it cuz it doesn't seem feel \"Korean\" enough.

It's almost like a Korean speakeasy - look for the angry chicken! :) Once inside, you'll know why there is always a loooooooooong wait - there is only enough room for about 20 to 30 people, tops. And if it is at full capacity, you'll be waiting upwards of 1 to 1.5 hours. However, don't be a n00b--make a reservation and you'll be seated almost instantly. If you do, make sure to be on time as they WILL give your table away with a quickness, especially if  you're late and its big party. \n\nConsistent favorites here are the casserole, dduk bok gi, and kimchee pancake. I will make a disclaimer and say that if you do get the casserole, get extra spicy. There is NO point to not get spicy at a Korean restaurant! The casseroles are HUGE and easily shared between 3-4 people, especially if they have small appetites. The drinks are good, though the soju cocktails really are pretty weak, at least for me. \n\nToyose is definitely more for the rowdy, younger crowd so if you're looking for something quieter I would skip this place. It's not the BEST Korean I've had (and it is not the best in the City), but I always have a great time here so four stars for me on this one!", "author": "Linda C."}

All of which makes Toyose's meteoric rise to fame quite remarkable - in no small part thanks to Yelp.\n\nAmbiance is, of course, the star of the show.  It's quite jarring to enter a shady looking garagefront into a fully converted restaurant indoors.  It's still got that slightly claustrophobic homegrown charm to it though, like you're playing house inside the box that your refrigerator came in (I *know* you all did that as a kid...).  There's plenty of graffiti scrawled on the walls by previous patrons, which imho adds to the neighborhood watering hole atmosphere.  Go ahead and add your own contribution, but make sure the waitresses aren't looking!\n\nAs for the food, it's standard but solid.  You can pretty much find all the usual suspects, and they are reasonably priced to boot.

If only there was an option for 0 stars on Yelp.\n\nIt used to be if you arrived before 6, they would let say, \"We aren't open yet, but you can have a seat first.\" Nope. Not anymore. I've been here several times before, and have never experienced something like this. We originally had a reservation for 10 at 6PM, and when 6 of the party arrived, they wanted to sit, but they waitress simply said they weren't open yet and wouldn't let them sit. Since they will not seat you until the whole party arrives, when it came time for 6PM, our party told the waitress it was 6 people instead of the original 10 to get seated first. And then add a seat for the 7th person on arrival. It was going to be the same number of tables and seating either way with the 7th seat at the end of the table. The the waitress ROLLS HER EYES at one of our party. Are you serious? What kind of customer service is this? And said that we needed to let them know in advanced and they needed to \"prepare.\" Prepare? I'm sorry, but the last time I ever saw them do anything was pull the tables together when a big party arrives. But they don't do that until they seat the party.\n\nJust because a restaurant is popular does not mean you can disrespect and be rude to your patrons and potential customers. Our group was so angry that we all just left. \n\nThere are plenty of good Korean restaurants in the Sunset. Don't waste your money and subject yourself to this type of treatment.

I always thought it was like a hair cut place or something like that. A restaurant never occurred to me. I also caught the bird picture out side. I think it's a chicken. \n\nNot good for groups. They do have a section for a group that can Maybe fit 18-19 people max if you're not large. But you'd have to arrive at 5:50-6pm, since they open at 6pm. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive. Sadly. But the experience was nice. It is very nicely decorated. They have a button for the waitress. Which is nice. They also come by once in awhile to refill your water. \n\nYou probably will not like this place if you cannot handle hot and spicy. Which is why I most likely won't come back. My little body just cannot handle the food. \n\nI came here with my SO. We ordered the spicy friend chicken wings (super deep fried and not spicy, at all - trust me on this AND totally not worth $14!), a beef dish that was not spicy, and we ordered a casserole. The casserole was super spicy. It came uncooked and they brought a portable stove to our table. Which was fine. As I was eating, felt beads of sweat forming on my forehead. My mouth was on fire. I have to say my favorite portion of the dish was the noodles. Which were like clear noodles. I didn't even eat a bowl of the casserole. So my SO ended up eating the whole dish himself. (Whoops!

This may have been the best kim chi fried rice that I've had anywhere.  The rice was not overcooked and the sauce had the right amount of spice to it.  This simple dish was cooked to perfection.\n\nThe rice cake is good but I just considered it a filler since these little things have a bit of weight to them.\n\nThe seafood pancake is big so you can definitely share it between four people.  It did not have too much batter and contained a generous amount of seafood.\n\nTo wash all this good food down, we ordered a bottle of pineapple soju.  For those of you that hate the taste of alcohol, this is your drink!  I did not taste any alcohol at all and only tasted pineapple.\n\nI really enjoyed this place (for the most part) and will definitely come back.

It's dark and looks exactly like going into a bar. It will be broad daylight outside, but once you go inside you will probably not know what time it is anymore. \n\nGot there at 6:30 on a Thursaday night, so there wasn't much of a wait. When we left though, there were a constant stream of customers. \n\nOur table had:\nKimchi fried rice- I thought this was okay. It wasn't mind-blowingly awesome, but it wasn't bad either. I would say that this is your standard kimchi fried rice, except you have meat. I thought that this wasn't overly salty or oily, which is great. One serving is enough for one person, although I started feeling overly full 3/4 of the way in and had to rest before continuing. \n\nPineapple soju- Tasted like pineapple juice. I'm not sure if they put soju in it. But! It was good! \n\nSeafood pancake- Loaded with seafood. Didn't seemed to be cooked all the way though. Otherwise pretty good. AND HUGE.\n\nchicken wings- I didn't think these were at all special. The chicken itself was, I think, ok. I liked the delicately spicy crust, and I think the chicken was cooked properly. Insultingly, the ggakdugi was not very good, and I think that is supposed to be the best part about eating korean fried chicken. \n\ngarlic cheese fries- These were good. Fries are seasoned fries! \n\nSteamed egg- I didn' t try this, but from my impression it was improperly salted (I don't remember if it was too salty or not salty enough). Pretty big portion, so I think it would be good as an additional side dish to share.\n\nStandard popcorn is standard. I didn't really eat the popcorn, but if you order alcohol you get a basket of popcorn. Actually now I'm wondering... why do most Korean bars give you popcorn with your alcohol anyways?\n\nOverall, I like this place, but judging from the food, I don't think it's a place where the shining point is the food.

On the outside, it is very unassuming, it blends in with the residential street it is located on, if you're not looking at the numbers, you may miss it.  The place seems to be set up in the garage of the typical SF townhouse.  \n\nOnce you enter, you're transformed to a Korean bar food scene.\nTheir fried chicken wings, the crispiest and juiciest wings I remember, and the pickled turnips that come with it is a great accompaniment.  \n\nTheir casseroles are my favorite, it is definitely not the casserole you think that bake in the oven.  The casserole is a huge hot pot (the waitress have to bring out its own stove top) with different ingredients thrown it, it is hearty and should be shared between 2-4 people.  My favorite is the spam and ramen noodles.\n\nTheir seafood pancakes and duboki are also worth mentioning, but the start of this restaurant is their flavored soju.  All their food is set up to complement their soju.  All of their flavors are yummy, I prefer their yogurt with any fruit flavoring.  \n\nService is so-so, there usually only have 2 waitress for the entire restaurant, so they're usually pretty busy, they do have a doorbell call button for the waitress.  The restaurant is always bumping the most updated Kpop, so if you're a fan of korean music this will be a fun environment for you.  \n\nIt is a great drinking/snacking place, similar concept to The Spot.

I love that it's literally a garage converted into a restaurant and that they have service buttons at every table for us to push as we please. =P Remember to make reservations for weekends since it gets SUPER packed. Their food coupled with the fruity soju cocktails makes for an amazing meal.\n\nStarted off with some complimentary popcorn even though we were hoping for shrimp chips. Our waitress was always really friendly every time she came to our table and prompt with our orders...extra plus for our food coming out in record time as well. I still can't believe how much food the 4 of us plowed through!\n\nfried chicken - Nicely crispy with a hint of spiciness and was piping hot. Mix of wings and drumsticks...can't ask for more from this dish which was gone in a flash. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=bcTmHMCOUkFx_HzbcrYGsA)\n\nkimchee fried rice - Looooved the abundant kimchee, the sunny-side up egg on top, and the pieces of seaweed/pork mixed in. The rice was cooked perfectly and wasn't too spicy. One of my favorite entrees for sure! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=XsEDW0OblZrvbVfJo_i4mQ)\n\nseafood pancake - *drooools* I always order this dish at Korean places and this one was awesome! It wasn't too doughy, contained both octopus and squid, plus green onions and red bell peppers. Delicious with the dipping sauce of course. Only con was that the pancake stuck onto the wax paper. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=rKvuu1kihDnzjmIA4uD3Cw)\n\nsoft tofu soup - This came out to be a bigger portion than I thought and was bubbling hot. For some reason the soup had a slightly sour taste and the tofu wasn't the silky soft one I'm used to. Not something I would order again. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=W14vvBtWUl_tbpxBJUHScw)\n\npotstickers - Here started round two of our dinner! Pretty much like pork gyoza you would find at Japanese restaurants. Still tasty and satisfying though. Be careful when you bite into them since the liquid inside may burn your tongue. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=glr59NrqaiCdCAZLOOmckA)\n\nbulgogi - A different version of bulgogi since it was mixed with pieces of squid, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, and onions. It was also in a sweeter and more watery marinade than what is usually offered at Korean restaurants. The additional ingredients were nice and the beef was still very tasty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=4dfn21Nia8_L-Tv7kd2EnA)\n\nshrimp and egg fried rice - I was stuffed at this point but gave it a try anyways. This time the egg was scrambled into the rice and had pieces of shrimp. Nothing too special about it but will fill you up! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AQjSsLrOheQ1snPWtYwv3w?select=2dAZqZziNSiLgwk96559dg)\n\nThumbs up to the strawberry and peach soju cocktails too! They got us tipsy and we loved the fruity flavors. The could creep up on you so please drink responsibly. 4 girls, 7 dishes, 2 soju cocktails came out to $35 a person!

Just FYI, garages are the new boats. \n\nAdd toyose as yet another fun place to get your drink on with some good food to boot.  Full disclosure: my preferred place is porno palace in Oakland, which I hold as the gold standard for similar places.  However, given that not everyone can or wants to go to Oakland (shame on them really), toyose is a great alternative holding it down for the city.\n\nThey have a good selection of various flavored sojus, and the yogurt-soju ratio is kept at a reasonable level.  Beers are your standard OB, Hite fare.  I will say though that the booths here are a little smaller and there's more areas with just regular tables.  Then again, its in a freaking garage so that's understandable.\n\nThe food selection here is much more robust than Toyose, with good amount of options.  The hamul pajun was okay, but a little thin for my liking.  The BBQ and boodaejjigae were both interesting but nothing to different.  I'd say this place's calling card is its kim chee fried rice, which is pretty delicious.  Too bad the portions are on the small.  Aside from the food, they give you a limited selection of banchan as well as popcorn.  \n\nOverall, another solid Korean place but nothing that's going to blow your mind.", "author": "Chris D."}

Feel like engaging in some risk taking activity? Mix them!      \n\nThe food is a little overpriced, but the spicy wings are worth it. \nThe french fries (with or without garlic & cheese) are always served with the finest ketchup--Heinz, I can tell. Make it a special occasion and get the kimchi pancakes and/or fried rice, too.\n\nThey only take up to 2 credit cards per table, so tell your non-cash carrying friends to figure it out before they get there. \n\nI'm taking away a couple stars because there are ALWAYS people throwing up across the street, out front, in line for the bathroom, or right onto the dinner tables.

It was crisp, somewhat moist, and had a garlicky ginger flavor to it.  I was expecting wings more like \"The Spot\" and \"Bon Chon\" in NYC with the glaze, so it was a little disappointing.\n*Beef Potstickers: It was just ok, the potsticker was more like gyoza. I prefer my potstickers to be pan fried vs. deep fried. \n*Fries: YUM! It was crisp outside, soft inside, and well-seasoned with some type of paprika seasoning?\n*Kimchee Fried Rice w/ Beef and Egg : YUM! If you like spicy foods, this is something you should order. I couldn't find any beef in it though. Make sure to puncture the egg and let all the yolk goodness over the rice. MmMmMmm! However, this is probably not the best thing to order at 1 AM in the morning while drinking soju. I guess you can imagine what happened later that AM. :X\n\nDRINKS:\n*Strawberry Soju: Tasted like a fresh strawberry smoothie with a hint of soju. So bad, b/c that stuff creeps up on you (in a good way). \n*Lemon Soju: Tasted like fresh squeezed lemonade just as the waitress had mentioned. Not as creamy as the strawberry and peach soju though. \n*Peach Soju: My FAVORITE out of all 3 we tried. It literally tasted like Peaches & Cream---YUMMY!!!!!\n\nSERVICE: Just as with any asian restarant, fast and efficient. Don't expect any small talk. \n\nAMBIANCE: Altough Toyose is in a garage, when you walk, it's totally different. It looks/feels like a regular restaurant. I didn't really care for the K-pop music though. \n\nAll in all, if I had to choose between Toyose and The Spot: hands-down The Spot would be my pick....wings, soju, vibe, and music is FAR BETTER!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

But man, an hour and 20 minutes was kinda ridiculous. Adding insult to injury was that a party of 4 who had only waited for 10 minutes was seated in front of our very eyes *wail*. My iPhone battery gave out, leaving me to stare longingly at people drunkenly (due to soju) but very obviously enjoying their food. So the wait is painful and the food doesn't quite make up for it because come on, ANYTHING tastes good when you're ravenous. Even water is like sweet nectar from the gods. \n\nWe ordered kimchee pancake and bu dae ji gae which is a traditional food eaten by Koreans during the second world war. It's a huge stew thing filled with sausages and spam, tofu, onions and bake beans. And to top it off, a block of instant noodles that cooks in front of you. Sounds good? Yeah. I'm kinda salivating just remembering it. So I liked it but I'm not sure if I can wait that long in the future unless I bring some popcorn to snack on.

Now that I got that out of the way, here's the low-down.  My friend and I came here on a Saturday night knowing that the Yelp reviews all said the wait was at least an hour long.  And we hate, hate, hate waiting.  Luckily, I planned it all out and had a late lunch so by the time we finally got seated at 9:30 I was good to go.  \n\nSo talk about weird places to have restaurants.  This restaurant is literally in the garage of a Sunset home.  When you get inside, there are no windows, just a long narrow space with group tables that have privacy curtains in the front and regular restaurant tables in the back.  The front of the restaurant is hot as hell, but the back (where they have the air conditioning machine thing) had me cold as a popsicle.  It is a little loud in here - none of that fancy sound bouncing stuff they have in the nice restaurants and people do get loud after 4 bottles of their soju that tastes like juice.  (I pretty much drank a majority of the bottle by myself - you'd never know that this stuff has alcohol in it until you get up and you notice you're a little tipsy.)    Ambiance and comfort is not really what you should expect when you go to a place like this anyway.\n\nAfter some extensive Yelp research, we decided we were going to eat like pregnant ladies because we wanted to try everything and had something on the magnitude of 5 dishes between 2 tiny Asian girls.  I guess that's what happens when you eat with your eyes.  We ordered the kimchi fried rice,  seafood pancake,  fried chicken, cheesy corn, and the pork hot pot dish and topped it off with some aloe vera soju.  My favorites were the kimchi fried rice (obviously), the seafood pancake, and the hot pot dish.  The fried chicken was eh, ok, nothing special there.  The cheesy corn dish was just weird.  It was like hard/bland mozzarella cheese over corn.  Not my favorite.  The aloe vera soju is Awesome with a capital a.  \n\nStop reading this review and just go already!", "author": "Jean A."}

It definitely reminds me of the bars that are common throughout Korea, so if you're looking for that authentic Korean bar feel, Toyose is your place.\n\nEveryone recommends the kimchi fried rice, which is good, but I also like their \"ramen dduk pokki,\" roughly translated, spicy rice cakes with ramen. Both are pretty good for sharing with some cocktail soju or just regular soju. Don't know what soju to get? Start off with the Chamisul Fresh. Served cold, it's smooth and goes great with the spicy Korean dishes.\n\nThe sojus that they carry are around 15-20% in alcohol content. Chamisul Fresh is just under 20%, which is pretty strong for your typical bottle of soju. As a rule of thumb, a 375ml (the ones that they serve are 375ml) soju bottle pours between 6 and 8 shots, depending on how heavy your hand is. If you do the math, that means a single bottle is about 3-4 shots of vodka, rum, or tequila. This is a pretty good deal, considering a bottle of soju at Toyose is currently $11, which gets you maybe 2 shots of vodka at any other bar. Because soju is at 20% alcohol content, it's notorious for \"sneaking up\" on drinkers. Have fun, but drink responsibly!", "author": "Gun-Ik P."}

Fried to complete Sahara Desert dryness, they lacked flavor, and the spice must've been lost in the 24 hour fry time they gave these wings. The best part of this dish were the side condiment of pickled radish. How sad.\n\n*Sauteed Fish and Rice Cakes with Potstickers in Spicy Sauce: Texturally quite off-putting. Fish cakes were non-existent, rice cakes were gummy and undercooked, and the potstickers were dry and overcooked. Tomato based sauce was mediocre at best.\n\n*Bulgogi with Calamari: Effin' disappointing. The calamari were overcooked and literally rubber band status.

The food just didn't have any pizzazz to it. My friend loves this place and wanted to celebrate his birthday here. This was another opportunity to try other dishes so I could truly determine whether I like this place or not. \n\nParty o' six on a Saturday night. Waited for about 15 minutes without a reservation. The place is hella small, all bedazzled with lights and shiz, straight up garage. Perhaps why a lot of people like this place is the home feel and comfortable environment. Any more comfortable and you'll start taking your shoes off. \n\nI didn't have high hopes for the food and as expected, was mediocre. The seafood casserole and ramen/spam thing was meh. Definitely not worth the 20+ dolla dollas. The spicy chicken wings don't have sauce or anything. I think they just coat it with spice flour. It was ok but on the dry side. The kimchi fried rice is the winner. The portion is a bit small for sharing but the taste is perfect and flavorful.\n\nCocktail soju time! We ordered: Yogurt, Peach, 2 Aloe, Kiwi, Mango. All were good. I really recommend the kiwi and aloe ones. Super refreshing! Maybe this is why Toyose gets such good reviews.

I never would have imagined this place to ever be anything other than a garage. So my friends and I had been eating all day literally; Hooters to watch NCAA, Genki Crepes for dessert, Quickly for dessert's dessert, and Toyose after bowling at 130am. When we came, I was skeptical because it was in a deserted area and from the outside looked like when you walk in it would be a secret Korean mafia's hideout but when you walk in the decor is beautiful. The booths have drop down bamboo curtains and the atmosphere inside is just very warm and inviting.\n\nWe ordered kim chi fried rice, mild duk boki with ramen, seafood pancake, fried chicken, and croquette. We also drank strawberry soju. Amazing amazing amazing. I literally wanted to keep ordering food and try everything on the menu. They have a doorbell to call the waitress if you need something and our waitress was super friendly and adorable. \n\nI'm definitely going back here; with friends and even to take someone special enough to go on a date with haha.

They converted the garage of a Sunset home into a restaurant.  So as you can imagine, it's not THAT big and it will get crowded.  And it's not your typical Korean restaurant that serves bulgogi and kalbi.  I think someone else summed it up perfectly:  Korean bar food.  Came here pretty early on a Saturday night for dinner, but it filled up fast.  Ok, onto the food...\n\nThis is where things get sketchy.  The kimchi fried rice and the seafood pancakes I enjoyed.  They weren't super spectacular or anything, but they weren't bad.  The fried chicken, however, was too fried.  It was on the crunchy side which you can imagine was also pretty dry.  (I think we meant to order the wings but got the fried chicken instead.)  And the pork shank...uhh.....I don't like it at Chinese banquets too much and followed suit here.  Mental note:  never again.  But what made this an enjoyable experience, what was the saving grace of the meal, actually, was the soju.  I never had soju before, but I am now an instant fan.  If you don't know (like me), it's kind of like Korean vodka.  But here, they flavor it up.  They have like maybe 10 different flavors of the stuff.  Not wanting to take too many risks, we asked the waitress what her favorites were and she recommended Yogurt, Strawberry, and Aloe.  After some debate, we went with the Yogurt and guess what...home girl knows her stuff!  That sh!t was yum-f@ckin-good!!  F'reals, I want to go back just to try the other flavors.  I know, I'm only giving Toyose 3 stars but I'm making it a point to go back.  A couple bottles of soju, some fried rice and wings...biggity-bam!  Smiles all around.

Lots of pork to go around 10x. Sauteed with onions and mushrooms, yum.\ncalamari and bulgogi ($13.95)- Least favorite. It was just flavorless.\nPotato Croquette ($9.95)Fried potato.

Their infamous alias is \"the garage\", literally operated in lower unit of a house located in a residential neighbor.  \n\nThere is plenty of street parking, but sometimes the wait to be seated (especially for big groups - 6 or more) can be up to an hour on busy nights.  What's great about this place is that they open late - usually until 2am on most nights.  This place is pretty pricey for the portions they serve.  They serve complimentary popcorn while you decide on what to order (and you can always ask for refills).\n\nSkip It:\nSpicy Chicken Wings - I don't see what the fuss is about...maybe I have a spicy tolerance.  I ordered this on several occasions, neither of which have been spicy.  Its just deep fried chicken drumlettes/wings (8-10 pieces) for $13.  More than $1 per piece, worth it?  You decide.\nCorn & Cheese -  It's literally corn, some peas and carrot bits melted in baked mozzarella served in a dot-sol [clay dish].  The crust looks like the top of a cheese pizza. It was too cheesey and overwhelming.  I know you guys might be like WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU ORDERED SILLY.  It was extremely disappointing since I've been meaning to try this dish here BUT it was SOOOOOOOOOOO ridiculously different from when I had it elsewhere.  It felt like something even I could make at home.\n\nWorthy to Order It:\nFrench Fries - seriously, I would not expect to order this at a Korean restaurant but they're pretty delicious!  Good appetizer to munch on while drinking Soju.  Only downer is $4.5 for an order of fries?  The order is pretty small.\nSeafood Pancake - traditional Korean staple, not bad.\nKimchi Fried Rice - my friends enjoyed this dish, and they always order it.  It's fried rice with the choice of your meat (bulgogi) served with a sunny side up egg on top.  I'm not a fan of Kimchi so it wouldnt be fair for me to evaluate this dish.\nSoju - there is a unique variety of flavors (i.e. Kiwi, Mango, etc).\n\nService is great because each table has a little bell you can ring for you to get their attention.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-30", "description": "I gushed to my friend that this was the \"best Korean food I'd ever had\" when I first tried the kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice here. \n\nThis might have been a greatly hyperbolic exclamation from a starved student who was caught \"in the moment,\" but upon retrospection and now with my belly full, I will stand by that statement. This place won me over due to taste as well as my perceived novelty of the items offered - they were unlike any other Korean dishes I'd tried (well, not to say that I have extensive experience - \"Korean\" to me usually means bbq and tofu hotpots). Regardless, it was savory, succulent, and so darn delicious!\n\nFrom the outside, this restaurant is extremely easy to miss. Its nickname of \"The Garage\" is fitting and a perfect clue in the hunt for this place. Once inside, however, the place is surprisingly spacious, homey, and comfortable. It works great as a location for an intimate dinner or for a gathering spot for slightly larger parties. The food, as I mentioned, was delectable, and I have Yelp to thank for that since I had followed previous reviewers' recommendations. To echo them: It is a must to try the specialty \"pancakes\" and kimchi fried rice here!\n\nThe service was decent, although the staff will make it obvious through tactics such as politely placed bills, clearing off of the table, inquiries into your comfort, and surreptitious sidelong glances if you happen to overstay your visit. I don't consider this a blemish on my experience, though; there was a line of people waiting to be seated which I had not noticed at the time, and it was understandable for them to try to hurry us out. However, consider this a fair warning to you all who expect impeccably tactful service.\n\nAll in all, I'm definitely looking forward to returning and trying more goodies!", "author": "Amy T."}

The portions are small except for maybe the soups but everything else is just ridiculous. I like the fact that they're open til 2am so I give them one star for that and another star for the cute decor and how its a garage converted into a restaurant. But I have to agree with one of the other yelpers saying how this could be a potential fire hazard. It's really stuffy inside and the service is not memorable.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken wings and the kimchee fried with beef. I have to admit the spicy chicken wings were pretty good but foreal? $12.95? For like 8 pieces? I can go to a chinese restaurant and get something similar for like 1/3 of the price. And it wasn't even spicy at all. Where was the spice? The kimchee fried rice was alright. The portion was really small and again, WAY overpriced. My sister ordered some tofu soup that had calamari and shrimps and it. I think it was worth it to get that though. \n\nThe customer service was very blah... the reason why I deducted so many stars was because when we entered, there were 2 other people waiting ahead of us. The girl looks at me and my sister and asks \"how many?\" and we say \"2\" she goes \"the wait is 20 mins\" Ok, so I have no problem waiting but when we finally got seated, my sister noticed that the back room had like 4 tables that were empty. So I turned around and looked and I was like \"WTF?\" I mean yah maybe they were reserving it for a large party or something but it was like 12 midnight. Really?? The least they could have done was put a reserved sign on the table to let other customers know that its being used for later on instead of letting people question why the fuck we have to wait so long when there are clearly 4 tables NOT being occupied.\n\nI'm assuming they are known for their drinks but I'm not much of a drinker and also there were so many obnoxious people who were drunk and burping like it was the thing to do.

This is by far the coolest garage I have ever been in.\n\nWhen you see the place from the outside, it's easy to assume that Toyose would be some sort of dive bar, but it's quite the opposite.  Upon opening the door I was immediately impressed by the interior decor and the amount of people crammed in there having a good time.  I couldn't hear any of this from the sidewalk, which probably explains why they can stay open until 2am.\n\nThe food was delicious.  The sake was delicious.  The popcorn?  Not so delicious.  It's almost like they serve you those stale cardboard-tasting popped kernels to set the bar low so when the actual food comes, you're like \"Damn!

It makes the lack of attention to the table more preferred than the traditional \"how is everything?\" walk-by every ten seconds at other places.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place along with the interior decor had me forgetting I was inside someone's garage out in the boonies of the Sunset.\n\nSince discovering this place a week ago, I am making trip number three to Toyose tonight with some friends.

Whole fried chicken (not rotisserie whole chicken, but rather a whole chicken hacked up into many pieces and deep fried)\n\nI LOVED the kimchi pancake. It was so yummy. It's definitely my favorite dish out of all we ordered. \n\nThe seafood casserole is a spicy soup with veggies (tofu, zucchini, mushrooms) and a plethora of seafood (shrimp, blue crab, squid legs, mussels, clams, fishcake), cooked on our table on a portable butane stove.  It was pretty good, we even got  some udon to throw in the boiling hot pot.\n\nThe fried chicken was fried well (very crispy without heavy breading), but lacked flavor.

So if you are expecting a bar scene, it's not the right place.\n\nMost of their food is awesome. \nOnes I usually get are:\n- Wheat noodle on a big plate with veggie and beef slice with gochujang (chilli paste) sauce : Jeng Ban Gook Soo (their flagship food)\n- Fish cake soup : Ul Deng (One of the bests in the bay imo)\n- Sea snail with veggies and gochujang (it's pretty spicy which is the way I like)\n\nOn a cold night when you need some hot side dishes and soju to fire you up, this is the spot. Also if you wanna have a relatively cozy setting where you can talk while drinking with your friends, highly recommend this place.\n\nMost times there is a line and you need to wait. Couple weeks ago when I went there, they said they take reservation for the group of 4 or more.", "author": "Kyu K."}

It's a restaurant inside a garage of a house, and it has this Hole-in-the-wall feeling. Came here with friends. Ordered the Beef Kimchi Fried Rice, which was pretty good, but not as much meat. We also ordered the rice cake soaked with pork in kimchi sauce, which also tasted pretty good.\n\nFinally, we had the cold buckweat noodles with pork and assorted vegetables, fruits, and two variations of cold pork. It may cost a lot (~$20), but it's a VERY BIG dish, enough to serve 4-6 people. Expect it to take about 30 minutes to make.\n\nOverall, the food was good, and the ambiance was good. I will definitely be coming back here sometime soon. But...they're only open for dinner. And definitely make reservations or come early, or you'll have to wait!", "author": "Henry P."}

That right there is a beautiful combination. \n\nIt is easy to miss this place if you are driving by. You kind of have to know what you are looking for because the front of this just looks like a regular house. I am dead serious; the entrance door is next to their garage door. It's like going over to your best friend's house to eat dinner and drink soju except for the fact that they charge you money and make you wait to be seated. Other than those two things, it's pretty much the same thing!\n\nThey serve up the best kimchi fried rice in San Francisco. I am talking about buttery and spicy goodness. Plus this dished is topped off with a fried egg and seaweed. Man just thinking and writing about this dish is giving me some serious cravings. I can't wait to get married and put on sympathy pounds in support of my pregnant wife. I would probably eat this dish everyday once that time comes to pass.\n\nMy friends and I also ordered the dukboki, which are rice cakes served in a spicy soup. They kind of look like lifesaving flotation devices. In a way the duboki here does save your taste buds from drowning in an ocean of blandness and boredom, so I guess the comparison is appropriate.\n\nWe also ordered up a basket of the seafood tempura. There was definitely enough tempura to go around. The pieces were literally overflowing from the basket. The pieces were very big and meaty (you definitely weren't just eating fried batter).\n\nMan this place is just too good. Everything I've ever tried here has been on point. I am definitely coming back here again and again. The kimchi fried rice by itself is worth the trip here! There are so many other items I want to try and eventually will try. Just like an old friend I haven't seen in a while, I will always have room at my table for Toyose's kimchi fried rice.", "author": "Allan Y."}

We ordered an assortment of dishes and it was definitely yummy. \n\nKimchee Fried Rice - delicious and I think it should be a rule to always order an egg with it. We had some fried rice leftover and it made great leftovers!\nDdukppoki - I'm always picky with how these rice cakes are made. I love them when they are just the right consistency and chewiness.

I've been wanting to try Toyose for a while after reading Yelp and hearing about it from my friends. We made a reservation for a party of 6 so the wait wasn't long at all on a Friday night. The decor on the inside was a lot nicer than I expected btw. Anyway, we ordered the kimchi fried rice, dukbokki with ramen, fried chicken, seafood pancake, and kimchi jigae. We also got peach soju and yogurt soju. I was really surprised at how fast the food came. I think it was the quickest Korean restaurant I've ever been to. \n\nI liked everything we ordered, especially the seafood pancake. It was fried perfectly with the right texture and thickness. Everything else was good, but not better than what I've had at other Korean restaurants. I admit though that I was a little sick so I might not have been in the right food state of mind. For now i do prefer Shin Toe Bul Yi more, but they don't have yogurt soju. The peach and yogurt soju were pretty good. It's $11 a bottle, which is cheaper than other places, but it's also smaller. The taste is worth it though, especially the peach soju. I really want to come back here and try the casseroles they have. \n\nIf you're worried about parking, it's not too bad.

The place has gotten too commercialized over the years.  \n\nI have sinced moved out the Sunset and looking for a soju place in the bay that provided the intimacy and downright 'garage' feeling Toyose use to exude.  \n\nrecommendation:  If you find to flavored soju to be somewhat bland, just buy a bottle of straight soju (jinro/chamisil) and mix it in...couple bottles of hite is good too. . . \n\nLots of memories were made at this place during my college years and years after.", "author": "Max L."}

Referred to fondly as \"The Garage\" by regulars I had a hard time finding such a Garage that served food on Yelp. Lo and Behold here it is! And it has a real name!\n\nWent here last night for a late night bite with some friends. Table of 4 seated quite quickly in the AMs. Kitchen was closing in 10minutes so we ordered fast and all the food (including to-go orders) came out really quickly. I was a little worried about the quality not because of the sketch place (inside is actually quite nice!) but because the waitress seemed pretty rushed and angry - well we were sitting down and ordering pretty last minute - but everything was pretty tasty! I got to try a variety of their specialities including their fruit infused Soju- we got mango-, spicy rice cake and noodles, seafood pancake and udon seafood soup. All were pretty tasty. \n\nAll-in-All I say food is good, service is so quick you don't really care about that \"required\" smile or friendly demeanor at such an unreasonable hour from anyone - let alone somebody from the service sector haha.

Other than that, the place is really cute inside with nice lighting, screens for privacy (since the people waiting can literally be standing right next to your table), good decor, and a helpful call button for service. The food is okay, the portions are huge so family style makes the most sense, but we didn't get to try the stew or soju.

I've discovered Toyose a while ago, but I've always been too shy to go in there myself because it looks so exclusive disguised as a garage. \n\nBut the is THE garage. Inside, it's very cozy, like a cave; a magical cave disguised as a garage. They are also open until 2am EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK, which makes it all the better. I came here on three occasions recently and every time has been pleasant.\n\nThe first time my friend and I joined our friend for a few drinks with his coworkers to celebrate his 21st birthday. A waitress promptly comes with a shot glass and half-pint for us to drink with. We tried the pineapple soju and yogurt soju. Yum yum. I had already ate that day so I didn't get to try the food, but it looked delicious.\n\nThe second time, I went there on a Saturday and this place was packed! We were told it was going to be an hour wait, but my friend and I had nothing to do so we decided to wait it out. They took down our name and number to call us and we left to kill time. To our luck, we got a table within 20 min! We weren't too hungry, so we just ordered their fried chicken (~$13 ?), since we noticed a lot of other people getting that, and pineapple soju ($11). These chicken wings and drumsticks were pretty damn good! Better than the ones from those dessert places. The bill between us was about $30 which I thought was fairly pricey for just fried chicken and soju, but sooooo goood.\n\nThird times the charm and I had an awesome time here, even though I got there at 1:20a on a Sunday night. Everything looked so good, but the kitchen closed at 1:30a so we had to decide quick. The waitress was very polite about informing us about this and we finally decided on #3 which is this calamari and vegetable dish with noodles ($13.95 + $3 if you add noodles). We also ordered a bottle of plain soju, peach soju and yogurt soju. The waitress probably thought we were crazy order so much alcohol when we only had 30 minutes to finish it.. but we did! Well, she was super nice and she actually let us stay until about 2:15a and didn't hurry us out too much so kudos to you for that.", "author": "Helen Z."}

How can I not have reviewed you before?\n\nBeing a lover of all things Korean, I made Toyose one of my first stops when I moved to the Bay Area. I took the Caltrain up from the Peninsula, hauled it out there on the N Judah, and walked about 15 blocks in the freezing wind and crazy fog when I got off at the wrong stop. But when I saw that glowing yellow chicken sign, I knew it was definitely all worth it.\n\nYou've got a special spot in my heart, cause this is where I first had that amazingly delicious yakult soju that has since become a staple in my drinking diet. I don't need that little soju glass that comes with it, just give me the whole bottle. I promise it will be gone in a few seconds.\n\nYour fried chicken is consistently tasty and much better than the over-hyped San Tung.\n\nYour seafood pa jeon is loaded to the brim with water-dwelling critters. And even though I'm not the biggest fan of squid or octopus, you make it find a happy home in my belly.\n\nAnd that tasty tofu with sauteed pork and kimchi is the perfect way to wash down the slightly undelicious maek ju flavor that's all too common in my mouth. \n\nI wish you weren't so crazy crowded.

Earlier that year when we became official, I also came here to celebrate with some good friends. We had a horrible fight one night . . . and I fled here to Toyose, in tears, where my friends met me up.\n\nWhile I was deathly afraid of this, coming here doesn't ring up painful remnants of our relationship-that-is-no-longer like I thought it would. Instead, I think about sitting in a warm cozy booth with my bests while the blustery San Francisco weather meddles on outside and I start to crave the crunchy batter-fried chicken wings, the huge tasty seafood pancake, the perfectly cooked savory kimchi fried rice (with an egg on top - yum!), and the huge pot that they bring to your table with their simmering kimchi and spicy tofu casserole soup (that contains cut up hotdogs, spam, blocks of ramen noodles, tender fatty pork, and rice cakes - it's a winning combo, trust).\n\nI also think about even later nights here where Tim B (SUP WITH IT) and I got so drunk off soju that we started tossing their free popcorn into each others mouths (actually, this may have been before we started drinking . . . don't judge). I think about clinking bottles of OB and Hite beer to celebrate the moment and the many sweet glasses of tasty soju that they have to offer (yogurt, peach, and strawberry are my favorites).\n\nOne star off because Toyose, like most Korean places, tends to be on the more expensive side.

A Korean joint, in a garage.  Cool indeed.\n\nDecor is nice and cute with call buttons at the tables.  Open up late, so bonus points.  This place is small, so depending on when you come you might need to wait for a table.  We came at 11 PM so we had no problems getting a table.\n\nI must have had one too many to drink because I ordered a dish I normally NEVER would order.  Yet it intrigued me, so I did - Sausage and vegetables sauteed in tomato sauce.  Translation?  Hot dogs (and not the good \"We Answer to a Higher Calling\" brand), veggies, apples (?) smothered in ketchup.  Bizarre.  I've never had apple in ketchup and doubt I will again.  My friend's udon however was tasty according to her and so was the bulgogi my other friend ordered (I tried it, it was indeed yummy).

Came here for my birthday after making reservations 2 weeks in advance, and was pleasantly surprised to find that, in spite of being a relatively small restaurant, Toyose was able to seat all 17 of us timely, without splitting the group up into multiple tables.\n\nAmong the many items we ordered were the Budae Jjigae, Kimchi Fried Rice, Fried Chicken Wings, Seafood Pancake, Kimchi Tofu and Cheese Corn.  The Budae Jjigae is my favorite item on the menu, and something that many Korean restaurants don't serve.  The meat provided with the stew is plentiful, and although it's around $24 for that dish, one order is enough to feed 3-4 people.\n\nWe also tried many different flavors of the Soju: Strawberry, Mango, Kiwi, Pineapple, Yogurt, Aloe.  Of these, our favorites were Strawberry and Kiwi.\n\nDefinitely one of my go-to spots, and a great place for groups (if you have reservations).  They don't take reservations for smaller parties, and if you happen to be in a small party on a night when they are also accommodating a bigger group or two, be prepared to wait for 30-90 minutes to be seated.", "author": "Diana C."}

Forget the soda, order up a peach soju cocktail or some plum wine. Food wise, Toyose has everything from a Kimchi fried rice to dukkbokki to spicy chicken wings. The spicy chicken wings were served hot and when you bite into them, it came with a loud crunch! \n\nIf you are into some exotic food, try the chicken gizzards which come with a sweet non spicy chili sauce. It is more sweet than spicy but adds a really refreshing taste to it. \n\nOverall, if I could come here again I so totally would. The food and service are great too. The only difference would be the buzzer on the wall next to the table. It is there for a reason. The waitresses leave you alone until you ring the buzzer.

No joke, it literally is someones converted garage.\n\nNevertheless, it's a great place to come have some Korean food and knock back a couple of shots of soju.  \n\nSince garages aren't that big, it's usually pretty crowded here.. like ALL the time.

Oh ho ho, that's where we're wrong. If you're looking for traditional Korean food, go somewhere else. \n\nMy main beef (or should I say bulgogi) with this place is its rude SNSD-wannabe staff. We were told 40 minutes on a Saturday night for our group of 6. The place is tiny, so we chose to stand outside for the first 15 minutes. We quickly moved inside as it was freezing out and ordered a large bottle of Hite to share. My party was apparently standing in the way of one of the waitresses as we got our beer and she snapped at us to move away. Well I'm sorry dear, it's not our fault this place is so gd tiny, the waiting area is already packed, and it's freaking cold outside. Two glasses of beer later, we are still not seated and I'm reaching boiling point after seeing people who came in after us get seated before us. Had I not been in a group, I honestly would have just walked out. We weren't seated for an hour and thirty minutes - which isn't really a reflection of our group size since two other groups of 6 got seated before us.\n\nAnd a little rant while I'm on it. This has nothing to do with the actual restaurant, but clearly chivalry is dead. It would be nice to see guys offer up a seat in the waiting area to one of the 4+ women standing... yeah, ok that's too much to ask from ghetto asians in their snapback hats. lalala\n\nWhen we were finally seated, we actually got served pretty fast. Our Korean friend ordered for us- strawberry soju, jjigae with doobu and spam, and kimchi fried rice. This is not a traditional Korean bbq place. For one, our \"banchan\" was a small bowl of popcorn. WTF. No kimchi? Livid and starving me wanted something of substance. You call this a Korean restaurant?! Other wtfs that followed: No galbi, mandu, or bibimbap on the menu. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing amazing, and actually lacking spice. The best thing we ordered was the soju. Price was cheap considering it was 3 entrees and a soju split 6 ways. Came out to about 12 dollars a person with tip included (a tip I wouldn't have included). By the way, once they seat you, you use the buttons on the wall to call the waitresses to your table as they do in Asia. \n\nBottom line: Food is so-so, drinks are good, and don't expect traditional Korean food or good service.", "author": "Miffy Y."}

It had a variety of seafood, bell peppers, and onions, and it was really good!\n\nKimchee fried rice- had a sunnyside egg and strips of seaweed on top. The fried rice was yummy! It looked semi-spicy at first, but it wasn't at all! \n\nBulgogi dish with veggies- didn't have too much veggies, all i saw was mushrooms and bunch of onion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-21", "description": "Have I said that there wasn't good Korean food in San Francisco? This is me eating my words (and good Korean food).\n\nThe Fiance and I were meeting up with some Korean friends and we were jonesing for some Korean food. Yelp led us to Toyose and even though the Fiance warned me that he'd read that it looks like someone's garage, I was surprised to find that it really does. \n\nActually, the entrance is located right next to a garage door. When I walked in, I immediately felt at home. Toyose's is a small restaurant but the atmosphere is exactly what a good Korean wants - fun with dark brown decor and mood lighting!\n\nWhen you're drinking your soju/soju cocktail, you don't want ugly white lights glaring down at you while you're surrounded by white walls. No, you want to be sitting in a cozy section with wood and brick walls (the latter have names carved into them from former patrons and the former have the ubiquitous Hyori/soju posters). \n\nOn to the food. The four of us ordered:\n\n- Soh gogi kimchi bokeum bap (kimchi fried rice with beef): This was a solid dish. It's pretty easy to make, even at home, so it's difficult to mess up. It comes with a fried egg on top. \n\n- Rabbokki (ddukboki with ramyun, i.e., spicy rice cakes with ramen): I haven't had good rabbokki since...well, for a long time. Ddukboki is hard to make \"right\" and of course every family has a different recipe (my mom's is the best. Seriously.). This dish was appropriately spicy, the rice cakes were cooked well (it sucks when they're over- or under-cooked) and they included a nice helping of ramen. \n\n- Jun gol (hot pot): Toyose calls this section the Casserole section but I would disagree slightly, given that you would never cook jun gol in the oven. It's a stew with raw meat, vegetables and soup that cooks quickly over a gas flame. I don't remember the name of the one we ordered but it's the one with baby octopus and beef. Delicious! \n\n- Yogurt soju: You can't have a Korean reunion with Korean friends and not have some sort of soju. The cocktails come out in olive oil bottles which isn't a bad idea since the spout makes pouring into shot glasses really easy. One order is about 8-10 shots, depending on how much you pour. \n\nAll in all, I had a fantastic time and I can't wait to go back again. Who knew that such a gem lay nestled in the Outer Sunset?? \n\nToyose is open until 2 a.m. (another wonder!) and they WILL card you. Don't think that just because this is a Korean joint, they play loosey-goosey with the ID's! \n\nHave no fear about trying the restaurant if you're not Korean. The waitresses speak English quite well, the menu is written in both Korean and English and they don't only serve things like baby octopus stew.", "author": "Christine P."}

We drove from 19th to 46th, back to 32nd, then back to 46th, squinting to find it, driving at a crawl's pace.  It was when Kder finally yelled, \"what the...they have a sign now\" did the Toyose experience begin.  I nearly walked by the building, wondering if I had to ring a bell to this \"garage\".  However, when some patrons left, opening a door in the wall that I didn't notice, it brought back memories of the bar in Japantown where you are led through a kitchen.  Wondering if I was being tricked and walking into a death trap, I was happily greeted by Korean accents happily eating seafood pancakes.  Toyose is a very small establishment and is set up in a make-shift garage.  It is tiny yet teaming with laughter, men missing the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and patrons flattening themselves against the wall so that the waitresses can pass.  We ordered the\n\nkim chee fried rice: 5/5  I don't even like kim chee but I have to give bless ups when bless ups are due.  This kim chee fried rice, while I am sure was super cheap to make, was fucken most savory and was the best dish of the night.  Over easy eggs on top of anything makes it 1000x better.  Luckily, it wasn't that spicy because I am a puss when it comes to spiciness.  \n\nfried chicken wings: 3.5/5  I don't know how Toyose pumped out these dishes so fast.  Everything came out after 5 minutes.  The fried chicken was good, much better than anything KFC can offer, but after a couple wings, got too salty.  After a couple wings, I had to ask for a bowl of rice to balance the saltiness.  I was debating on whether I should get a whole chicken so that I can have different pieces of the chicken, however, due to the amount of food we got, opted for handfood.\n\nbulgogi: 4/5  We ordered the bulgogi without the calamari and were happily accommodated.  The bulgogi wasn't grilled however; it was sauteed.  As a result, there was less of a char taste however, it was still good.  I liked how the bulgogi wasn't too sweet and there was a strong taste of garlic and the vegetable juices.  \n\ncheese corn: 2/5.  KDer often talks fondly of Toyose cheese corn, however, was disappointed in last night's batch.  It was good, however, Bob Sang in Fremont was better.  The cheese was not creamy and the cheese quickly hardened up.  It was like the topping of a pizza once it gets cold.  This dish really put me over the edge as the hardened cheese was so filling.  \n\nToyose is one of the Korean restaurants I've been too in San Francisco.  It's very warm and cozy unless you sit next to the AC and back door where I was inconveniently seated.  Minor gripe however.  The waitresses were the silent friendly type, always accommodating, never speaking.", "author": "Brian V."}

Toyose definitely fits into this category. The best way I can describe this place is 'Korean izakaya' - go here to drink beer/soju and snack on food items that go awesomely with drinking. \n\nWaaaay out in Outer Sunset (almost to the beach) and basically housed in a converted garage, this place is an odd find in the middle of a mostly-residential neighborhood. When we entered, both of us got this distinct feeling that we're no longer in SF. Not having been to Korea, I can only say that the place reminds much more of places in Hong Kong or Tokyo or even NYC. Also, I think we were possibly the oldest people in the place since it seems to be a hangout spot for local college kids. \n\nThe place itself is tiny with quirky decor and only one waitress, so we prepared ourselves for the long haul. Once we managed to get our order in though, the food came very quickly. We ordered spicy fried chicken wings, seafood pajun, and kimchee+beef fried rice - all delicious and of course, went perfectly with our little bottle of soju. We saw other tables order the 'cocktail sojus' with various flavors as well as large boiling cauldrons of delicious meats and vegetables with ramen noodles - we'll definitely try that next time. \n\nThe best part?

SPICY and the spam was REALLY good. they also put the same pork they use for dwagibulgogi (pork bulgogi) and my sister and friends fought over that too (lol) it was good, but i could have done without the sausages.. they tasted kinda funky. but the SPAM, RAMEN NOODLES, PORK, RICE CAKES were the best part of the stew. the soup was yummy too\n\nunfortunately, since my sister and i had to run a marathon the next morning (THE NIKE WOMEN'S MARATHON OH YEAH WE FINISHED IT TOO BY THE WAY) we steered clear of the alcohol.. and obviously the mother in our group didnt drink since shes still breast feeding her baby and our other friend also drove so she couldnt drink either so none of us tried the alcohol, but we all do want to come back specifically to try the alcohol. but the food was wonderful and they get 5 stars JUST for that.", "author": "Rebecca K."}

Truly a hole in the wall, since it is in a garage in the middle of sunset. I've tried all the flavors of the soju and the two that prevents my shot glass from getting dry is mango and Yogurt soju.. also love the HITE beer ,by the PISHER, as it is mispelled on the menu. =D \n\nAs for food, the price is a bit high for the taste but nonetheless, it is still good compared to another korean/bar place like THE SPOT. \n\n1. kimchi fried rice - default dish I get here, tastes really good on some days, lacks a bit of consistency of the taste but it still has all the flavors I love.\n2. calamari & beef bulgogi- mMm mMm, sooo goood, especially the sauce. Beef is really tender and juicy... calamari very chewy but not too chewy to the point where the tentacles will get stuck between your teeth. \n3. seafood casserole - For a wallet-robbing $26 and some change, you get glass noodles boiled with calimari, clams, octopus, veggies, tofu, and a really delicious spicy broth. This is my favorite! \n4. garlic fries- this is not your typical ballpark/theme park garlic fries... this is literally fries topped with freshly chopped garlic on melted cheese. kinda weird, yet surprising delicious.\n\nIf you go during weekends at night, you better make reservations. Also if you are expecting the traditional small dishes at a korean restaurant...bad news--you're not getting any. However, in exchange, they do give you a small dish of popcorn. BLEH\n\nSo in summary.. food (OKAY), price (kinda HIGH), drinks (GOOD), Service (GOOD), Atmosphere (EXCELLENT). If you like to gossip, catchup, get tipsy, talk smack till 2am with k-pop music in the background, this is the place to be!!! ^_^", "author": "Mishi W."}

It's got a mix of vegetables including mushrooms, onions, cabbage? Note: don't mix the ramen in until the end or it'll get soggy.\n\nFried Cheese and Corn - You might not want to get this unless you have a large party. It's plenty tasty and rich but if you leave it for too long it gets gross.\n\nRamen and Rice rolls? - Yummy but can be a bit starchy as the rice rolls are very dense. But the sauce is excellent and there are plenty of vegetables to go with it.\n\nThis is more of a home-cooking / drinking place open til 2am (longer if you're korean :P) Make reservations or you'll be hanging out at the bar across the street (also good).", "author": "Brandon O."}

I had heard good things about the chicken wings, and although not worth a drive across town they were the best thing on the table. I still found them under seasoned, although crispy and fried perfectly. We also ordered an octopus dish which was borderline painfully chewy, ugh.

After reading how popular it was, I expected a huge line out the door but it was not the case when we went last Friday night.  The restaurant exists in the outer sunset and you wouldn't really even know it was there if not for the small sign outside.  The door wasn't even open and no one going in or out so you wouldn't expect a restaurant.  But as we approached there were business hours posted and we opened the door... Wow - this place was packed and full of people drinking, eating and just being merry.  5-stars for fun and atmosphere for sure!\n\nIn my opinion, the BEST thing to get here was the soju.  We had the strawberry and the mango.  A huge bottle is served for the price and the flavor is so fantastic (like fresh squeezed juice) that you can drink a lot of this stuff pretty easily.\n\nThat being said, I don't think the food is as good as other reviewers have thought.  We had the bulogi, kimchi fried rice, kimchi pancake, seafood pancake, eel, fries and chicken wings.  The food was so-so and the only thing I'd want again is the chicken wings, very yummy.

It was all delicious but my favorite was the kim chee fried rice and potstickers. The casserole was actually enough for us all, though we probably would have liked more as far as portion size. The chicken wings were a hot grab at the table and it went so well with their side salad and the sauce. The mango soju was the best! I also liked the peach soju.

One such forbidden food is, and consistently has been: Korean.  I don't know why.  He's such a stubborn ass.  I've tried and tried, I even tried making it at home with \"safe\" ingredients and less spice, and marinating the meats myself.  The minute the food is labeled Korean, he can't stand it.  \n\nWell, tonight was such a night.  Not only was the BF away, but he left me his car.  Yes.  Little Asian girl in Big White-man SUV car.  It's as bad as it sounds.  \n\nLou and I pull up here after finding parking on the street in front of the ... crazy school?  after school day care?  smallest school ever?  I see signs up on the wall for 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade.  \n\nIt was about 6:30pm and we were properly hungry.  The place was nearly empty except for this soul-searching musician who sat in the \"private\" booth and read sheet music while drinking soju.  Right after we were seated, this group of 4 high school student come in and are seated in the same area.\n\nMaybe they did things differently in Berkeley, but when I was in high school, I didn't have money to eat at places like Toyose.  It's not French Laundry, but it sure is not UC Berkeley eatery places.  This is real sit down, leave a tip, eat with utensils type place.  Classy, if you will.  The inside of the this garage was tastefully decorated in a nautical theme.  Think \"Lost\" Korean sea-side fishing village theme, hanging nets, cork floats, driftwood.  It didn't feel like a double wide parking place at all!\n\nBack to the high school kids.  Maybe it's an Asian kid thing but they talked about their grades the whole time.  And they were not dorky looking Asians like I was, they were hard core ring-wearing, pierced ear, spiky haired, school cutting high school kids.  Who got an A on the midterm but then got a C in the class bc they never showed up.  \n\nFood ordered: Korean seafood pancake, fishcake and rice cake in a hot sauce saute, fried spicy chicken wings.  \n\nOur mistake:  I think the food would have tasted better with copious amounts of alcohol.  But then I would have had an even harder time driving.  \n\nIt was all really tasty.  I liked the Korean pancake.  It could have been a bit crispier.  And the fried chicken wings were a tad small.  I'm used to the south bay 99 chicken-drooling-messy-eating-lick-my-finger-salt-and-pepper-give-me-more.  The fishcake and rice cake had an excellent texture and seasoning.  There was the option to have it with ramen and an egg, which we did not exercise, because there was already so much food.  \n\nAfter about 30 mins, I threw in my napkin.  However, Lou had been in France for a month and this was his exodus.  So he ate everything left on the table except for 1 lonely little rice cake.  It sat in the hot sauce, crying, begging for acceptance.  No one touched it.  \n\nFinal thoughts: would come back here with many more people.  And order much more to drink.

Of course, I turned to my trusty Yelp and came up with Toyose.  We got there around 7pm on Wednesday, 5/5/10.  Since a lot of people raved about their Kimchi and Beef Fried Rice and Spicy Chicken Wings, we had to try those.  The Kimchi fried rice was delicious and my favorite dish out of everything we ordered.  The rice was cooked perfectly and each and every morsel was deliciously seasoned.  On the other hand, their chicken wings were just alright...definitely not as good as everyone claims they are.  Boyfriend and I both agreed that the wings were not spicy at all (maybe you need to ask for it extra spicy?).  Anyway, we also ordered the Spicy Rice Cake with Fish Cake and Potstickers.  I've never had that anywhere else and it was very different from what I imagined it to be.  I've eaten spicy rice cake from Korean supermarkets but those were always dry.  This one was super saucy and the sauce was kind of sickening after a while.  Also, I learned that I prefer my fish cake plain (banchan style) and not stir-fried in sauce (but I digress).\n\nOverall, the food deserved 3.5 stars.  Service was pretty minimal as well.  The two girls working there never bothered to check in on us.  They didn't even bring out the banchan until we were almost done with the fried rice!  After tax and tip, our bill came out to almost $50...so not worth it!  I think I'll just order one of those big casseroles next time instead.", "author": "Katelynn L."}

NO!!\nThis is just a soup okay?-_- Yes, really is just a soup with a stone pot.\nMy mom comforted me for rest of the dinner....\nThe soup is just put some chilled shrimp, chilled calamari and some other chilled \"seafood\" and the soup tasted very salty:( Sorry, this is not what I expected, and I order a rice which is I think they will cost that.\n\nAfter finish, I pressed the button again and get the recipe. They didnt cost me the rice. Yayyy hahah okay. This is not what I expected too, but I am soo happy.\n\nFor those all, I think the price is alittle bit pricey.

I'm a big fan of places that open 'til late and Toyose closes at 2am everyday...Yay!\nI've been here many times and have also introduced many friends to this place and all visits were satisfying (except for the time when these guys were smoking cigarettes inside..WTF!)!!  They have some good Korean food - one of the best in the area.  When you're ready to order, there's a button that you press and a bell rings for the waitress to hear.   Isn't that cool!?  \nI finally got to try the Soju when I recently went here for a group VDay dinner with other couples.  $11 for a Soju Cocktail...at first I was like \"dang, that's an expensive cocktail\" but when it came out, it was in those big bottles with the nozzles and you serve em up in shot glasses.  So yea, it was pretty much worth it!\nIt can get crowded, especially late nights.

The first time I came here was with my bf, and two friends. But I didn't really eat anything because I already had dinner... and I honestly dont remember what I had (which meant it wasnt amazingly good). Second time I came here.... was a big mess... it was for my friend's birthday, and they reserved the back room.... yet we only got half of the back room, so a lot of people were not able to sit down. And it was ridiculously hard to get there attention to order food. \n\nThird time (which is what this review is mostly based on), I came here with my sister, and two friends. I made reservations, so we were seated right away. We had the calamari and veggies with spicy sauce and rice cake, the fishcake, shrimp, casserole with noodles, and the spicy friend chicken.\n\nPeople said the chicken was good, so we ordered it. But it was not spicy (and didnt really have much flavor), and there wasnt that much meat on the chicken... but at least they gave us a lot of pieces. Still. not impressed with it.\n\nThe fishcake, shrimp casserole was ok, but we thought it was going to come with the ramen noodles, which was what my friend wanted. Since some of the other items stated \"udon noodles\" while this one just said noodles (guess we shouldnt have assumed it was going to be ramen). We ended up with udon noodle and ask for $2 ramen noodle. \n\nThe calamari and veggies with spicy sauce and rice cake wasn't that good either and they gave us like 8 pieces of rice cake... which was what we really wanted.... not the calamari or veggies.... taste was ok, but not the best i ever had.\n\nGetting the servers attention wasnt too difficult, since they have a button... but i realize that they dont know who presses the button, because they dont come to us and we still have to flag them down.\n\nI dont think I will be coming back here... feels really rushed when they are busy... and not like their food is really good.... maybe only to drunk people.", "author": "Alicia W."}

I think we ordered something else too, maybe some rice or beef dish. I don't remember the other dish to not be good, so it must have been good.\n\nBe careful of your wallet. By that I mean, the soju doesn't seem that strong in the beginning. So, you'll keep on drinking! Then it hits. So you eat more and drink more.

So if you are going to come here during the rush dinner hour, call here ahead of time, otherwise be prepared to wait!\n\nWe ordered the whole korean fried chicken before (my bf loves this) and it comes with pickled radish - this is not too bad, but can get a little dry.

The Duk-Buki (chewy noodles with fishcake) was pretty good here and I asked them to make it medium spicy and they did! Perfect! The giant soup casserole bowls are also quite delicious here and can easily feed 4 people - my favorite is the one that has the spam, kimchee, hotdog, ramen, beans, chewy noodle, etc. But beware..it's pretty spicy!

On cocktail soju alone you have a choice of aloe, yogurt, strawberry, mango, peach, etc. \n\nThen you get to the food. A lot of it is perfect snacking food for drinking (assuming you're over 21 years of age, of course). The chicken wings here are, in one word, awesome. And that's not me speaking from the perspective of having one too many sips of the cocktail soju (at least not entirely). They are battered nicely, tasty, and come out hot. \n\nEvery time I have been to Toyose it has been with a fairly large group of 8-14 people, and we always have a rambunctious good time. Like others have stated, try to make reservations before (and follow up the day of). On my last outing there, our party of 12 was seated, but the party of 8 before us was turned away when the hostess could not find their reservation.", "author": "Mike S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-03", "description": "Ok, when I talk about finding hidden gems shrouded in the fog of the distant outer sunset, this is what I mean.\n\nAt first glance, you might not even know Toyose is a restaurant.  It's essentially in the garage of just another typical Sunset house.  And even if you noticed the sign, you'd probably be too scared to go in, as there's no windows and no telling what's behind the door.  I mean, it could be some dude oil-changing his car and directing you to a single, wobbly workbench while his mother cooks food in the kitchen upstairs or something.\n\nBut no, it's actually a real restaurant inside (albeit a narrow and windowless one), with a real attempt at atmospheric decor that comes off a bit like Trader Vic's.  And the menu and waiters are reasonably well-versed in english.  Still, Korean food newbies might have a tough time deciding, especially as the prices can be a bit formidable.  For instance, the $22-25 \"casseroles\".  Those are actually giant hot pots that they cook on a portable grill right on the table, and they're easily enough for two, full of all sorts of delicious stuff.  In fact, you're probably best off coming here with a group or for a party when you can go for the all-out feast.  \n\nAnd then there's the $11 Soju.  Turns out $11 gets you a 750-ml bottle, complete with a pour spout, which isn't bad.  I tried cranberry and I have no idea how alcoholic it was but it goes down so easy it's got to be a good way to sneakily get someone drunk. \n\nSo, in short, prices are high, but portions are large and the food is great (right up there with Shin Toe Bul Yi) and so is the Soju.  Plus, service and decor is a cut above your typical OSAD (Outer Sunset Asian Dive).  Also, I was here on a Thursday and it was half-empty.  But I'd make a reservation just in case, cuz with a place this small, you never know.  As long as you can effectively judge how much you need to order, you'll have a great time.

Talk about hole in the wall restaurant.  i heard a lot about this place while i was in college, and i finally came here with my Korean friend. i NEVER thought that i would ever love korean food, but this place changed me FOREVER! \n\nif you make reservations here, you HAVE to tell them the correct number for the party. or they will not be so happy.  i had friends drop out on me last min, and i guess they could've given the table to a bigger party.\n\n love everything here! i love the Korean pancake the most. i have no idea how the make it but if i were to be stuck on an island for one month, the one food dish i would want with me would be the Korean pancake! Everytime i go back now, i ALWAYS order that.  in the past i can never tolerate spicy food, but everything here is so good, that i have a pretty good level of tolerance for spicy food now.  However, i dont think this place is vegetarian friendly, so don't bring your vegetarian friends here. this place is so cute, with it's doorbell service at your table. just press the bell and the waitress will be at your table.  i recommend the rice noodle dishes here too. but  just a warning it's pretty spicy.  the kimchi fried rice is good here too. the best time to come here is on a foggy or rainy day, perfect food just to warm you up =)", "author": "Belinda C."}

Didn't even know the real name of this place until I looked it up on Yelp just now. If you're coming here with a big group, make reservations. Otherwise you will end up waiting anywhere from 30 mins to an hour...if not longer.\n\nI always order the same thing when I come here. Chicken Wings, Kimchee fried rice, and Bulgogi. You will not be disappointed. \n\nThis place has the best flavored soju. Call me soft, but I just can't stand the green bottle. The yogurt and peach flavored soju are the best. Its actually pretty strong too but you can barely taste the soju.", "author": "Gary K."}

But the lights were on and the sign said it was open, so we ventured in.\n\nThere is only one girl in the front of the house, and looked like 1 cook in the back of the house, so getting seated, getting water, getting food, etc, probably took as long as actually eating the meal itself.\n\nWe ordered corn and cheese, spicy sauteed chicken gizzards, house pork w/special sauce, and the \"casserole\" with hot dogs, spam, rice cakes, etc. Everything was delicious and, according to my korean bf, authentic.\n\nI'm just learning all the nuances in Korean food, and apparently the type of food they serve here is equivalent to bar food.  I'll admit, it was a bit disappointing to not see kalbi on the menu, but there were plenty of other items to keep me stuffed.\n\nMenu is kind of pricey, but the portions are huge.

Known as \"the garage\", this little korean restaurant is tucked behind a residential facade, luring you in with its awning and cute mascot sign.

You get seated, ready to order, only to be disappointed by the food.\n\nI found the food to be just okay, lacking in the kick you expect from Korean cuisine. The soups were bland. Same with the kim chi fried rice, and the seafood pancakes. But hey, the food really serves as a sidekick to their awesome alcohol selection.

I was expecting it to be a mom-and-pop type of place and quality, which can be good still, but I meant also in the ambient-sense. But boy was I wrong! As soon as you walk in entirely different from what you would think. It's a ornate nicely decorated korean restaurant on the inside, so forget the part that it's in someone's \"garage\". \n\nThis place is very tiny though, so I wouldn't recommend it for big groups even though they have tables for 6 or 8 people. It just gets a little clausterphobic at that point. But it's super cute on the inside! Service was pretty good, they have those buttons you can push to call for service when you need it. And for the most part they come right away, but you have to be understanding when it's packed. \n\nThey give you a complimentary bowl of popcorn for each table, which is a little odd. Then they give you the standard complimentary korean appetizers of kimichi and pickled cucumbers and other vegetables. Yummy! \n\nThe Kimchi fried rice is DELICIOUS! Yumm! So flavorful and it has chopped up bits of kimchi mixed into it with a big fried egg on top.  I wasn't too fond of the egg yolk being left runny, but everyone likes it differently I suppose. You should definitely give the Kimchi Fried Rice a try though! \n\nOne of my friends got the \"casserole\", not a typical casserole that you would expect like something baked. Their \"casserole\" is a giant hot pot, cooking spam, hot dog, noodles (ramen) and vegetables. It's a little spicy, but good flavor broth. I would definitely get this next time, and you can share it between several people, it's that big! \n\nThe beef & calamari bulgogi was pretty tasty, but it doesn't come with rice, so you have to request it. \n\nThe soju was yummy, but why would you get the yogurt flavored one when they have so many other enticing choices?? We got the peach flavored one and that was really good! The yogurt one is bland compared to the peach one. \n\nNext time I am coming back for the casserole item, the kimchi friend rice and the chicken wings!

The broth was really rich and spicy to my liking. \nMight I say that the seafood pancake was THE BEST  seafood pancake i've tasted in San Francisco. It was crispy on the outside, savory and rich with seafood and vegetable. It was just perfect.\nThe Soju was also the best tasting Soju I've tasted so far.

I've also tried the duk bok ki, chicken wings and probably some other stuff. Their kimchi fried rice is the best I've ever had! As far as soju goes, I stick with yogurt and strawberry. I loooooove their strawberry soju because they use real strawberries (you can see the seeds in the bottle as you pour!) and you can really taste the true essence of the fruit. Sorta reminds me of that strawberry drink you get at taquerias.\n\nService on the other hand...is a hit or miss. The last time I was here, it was a hit. Previous times were mostly misses. They have this buzzer on the wall that you can press so that the waitress will come to your table. Depending on the waitress, you might have to press the buzzer a few times.\n\nOverall, the food and soju is pretty good, ambiance is nice and cozy, but the service can be sub par.

Equally delicious and both very quickly decimated. We then tackled the cold soba platter - soba noodles with a large variety of shredded fruits and vegetables that you mix in yourself. lovely combo! Finishing off with the seafood hot pot. So big, so yummy, cooked fast too! We were getting really full by now...but the smell...it was too good to resist!\n\nWe left full with promises to come back again soon.

I dont even know how i was able to sit through that type of wait TWICE.\n- the wait.\n- the wait.\n- the wait.\n- the lack of waiting space. Well, you can go outside, but if its cold, which it usually is, then you're forced to be in the awkward space watching ppl eat and cheers their beer/soju.\n\nTIPS:\n- You have to drive pretty slowly down the street and keep an eye out for the place because its a pretty dark street and light is minimal. \n- I dont remember having to park more than a block away either, but be sure to get there before 1030p or be ready for a long wait, unless you get lucky or call in before.\n\nDespite the wait, I still like the place. Their sojus makes it worth it.", "author": "Rena Y."}

This place is always a good time, not too many restaurants like it at all. It's in a garage like atmosphere with hella tiki-like surroundings. Makes you feel from out of town, and nowhere in Sf. Great Soju and Korean food! Thanks Gourment G for helping me remember this place.\r\n\r\nYummy in my tummy!\r\n\r\nIt is extremely hard to find this place, it's a hidden Korean gem! No signs outside but you have to find it. North side middle of the block...\r\n\r\nupdates: if you hate people or tolerate people smoking while eating, then this place is not for you.

Toyose puts all that to shame--you are served food that is cooked by a man walking around with a microwave plugged into a random public socket. It's seriously, all about the food.\n\nOkay, just kidding. \n\nHowever, there is fun to be made at the fact that Toyose exists in a converted garage deep in the residential zone of the Outer Sunset. The ambience matches the mood of an anju/izakaya style restaurant. At 2am in the morning, you feel like an insider as you push through a minimally marked door and enter a rambunctious house of soju shots and fobby giggles. Outside on the facade of the building, there are no lights betraying the liveliness of the party inside.\n\nAmbience aside, the food holds its own against some of the better late night Korean joints I've had. \n\nBad news first--the Korean Fried Chicken is an absolutely letdown. This pales in comparison to Bon Chan and even Kentucky(FC) at it's best. While the skin was crispy and light, the insides were clearly overcooked and the wings were small and dry. The seasoning was reasonable, though it could have had a more Korean bent with more heat and whatever else these star Korean chefs put into their awesome FC (fried chicken). \n\nGood news--the Kimchee Fried Rice and the Kimchee Tofu Pork were excellent. Both showcased the kimchee well.\n\n4 stars for the overall environment. \n3 stars for the food.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I went with some friends that swear they know their Korean food. The authenticity of Toyose won their hearts... but not mine. I wasn't a fan of the whole fried chicken. This dry chopped-up discombobulation should have been called whole fried cardboard. The kimchi pancake was quite good. It was the only thing that stood out. Our main dish was the seafood casserole. Mediocre at best. You know something's off when each dead sea critter floating in the soup starts tasting the same or becomes masked by the spiciness of the broth. You know something's off when you don't even know what part of the fish (or is it not fish?) is being served because it's so mutilated. I understand the attraction of cooking your own food at a restaurant (sort of), but waiting that long to even get the cooking started? Maybe it was the lack of soju on a Sunday night. But that shouldn't matter. Because we all know everything tastes and looks better with alcohol. Bottom line is the food needs to stand alone.", "author": "Michael Paul C."}

We pull up and yes, it is seriously a garage. Well, garage turned restaurant now. If you drove by, you'd never know this decently decorated restaurant existed. We walk in and its packed. There's only like 4 booths plus a few more tables in the back, but nonetheless its packed. We ask how long the wait is and find out 30 minutes from one waitress and one hour from another waitress. We talk to them again asking why the wait is so long (even though all the tables were full, it shouldn't be that long) and they report that there are reservations supposed to be coming in. Well after talking it out with them longer, they agree to give us a booth where the party is almost finished. Sweet deal, we only waited about 10 min. I guess you could say they accommodated us, but we had to talk our way into it. From that rocky start, I was kinda feeling eehh, but it smelled so good in there and I was starving so here we went.\n\nSo we're seated and given popcorn as an appetizer. Yes, popcorn. And it was pretty darn good (or maybe we were all just that hungry). We ordered the kimchi fried rice, casserole with the seafood, and the bulgogi/calamari combination plate. The bulgogi and calamari hit the spot. It came out sizzling and had an amazing combination of flavors. The casserole was alright. It was a really large pot of spicy soup with mushrooms, other veggies, pork, seafood, and anything else they threw in there. It was good at first, but I think the broth lost its appeal after the third or fourth serving. My favorite was the kimchi fried rice. I expected spicier, but I'm glad that it wasn't. Overall, I was pleased with the food.\n\nMy bf and I also shared a peach soju. No complaints there. It's soju, what else do I say?\n\nService was fine. The waitresses were pretty busy with all the tables, but they do have a convenient little bell that you can ring to get their attention. They're pretty good about responding to that. \n\nPrice-wise.. it's okay. Their bottle of soju is a good deal, but I felt like we spent more than we should have.

I'm not a big fan of rice cake and felt the flavors were a bit off.\n\nAnyways, it is a great place for a group of friends to unwind after a 'freaken drive me crazy' work week.

The  inside decor is really interesting...kinda boatish and they have these buttons on the wall at your table so you can call your waitress for something. The service here is always great and the food too. Dishes that I always get are:\n\nFRIED CHICKEN: the wings are fried right when you order them and it's a light crispy batter with tender juicy meat on the inside ...not too thick and greasy.\n\nSEAFOOD GREEN ONION PANCAKE: I just love this dish. it's huge and filling. It comes with a hodgepodge of seafood including shrimp and squid.\n\nKIMCHI FRIED RICE: This dish is always a safe bet...it's just fried rice with kimchi and it's spicy juices w/ a fried egg on top.\n\nDUK BOKKI: this is on of my favorites. Make sure you get this with ramen. the noodles just sop up the spicy sauce and it's just gooood. this dish has rice cakes, fish cakes, green onions, cabbage, carrots, and onions. \n\nThe soju here is excellent too. it's the perfect soju to fruit juice.. not too sweet and syrupy like at other korean places.

The hostess station, which I guess isn't really one, is in the middle of the room off to the side... so I guess you just walk in and take a table.  We actually had reservations for 6:30pm, and they told us to not be late... but when we walked in, it was empty!  We were the first people in the joint.  Around 7pm, more people trickled in, and by 7:30pm, the place was packed.  \n\nThe menu isn't full of your traditional korean dishes that you find at Brothers or My Tofu House.  It had different combos, like Calamari and Bulgolgi, Casseroles (more like hot pots), and variety of appetizers.  We got the Sausage, spam, pork, fish cake casserole in spicy broth.  This had a nice spicy flavor to it, along with some sweetness.  It was REALLLLY good.  A lot of other tables ended up getting it too.  It's definitely big enough to share between 4-5 people.  We also got the kimchi pancake, which I have never seen anywhere.  It was pretty good!  They also have a menu page labeled \"Hot Pots\" but it's really similar to the casseroles, but just smaller.  The casseroles are about $22.95, depending on what kind you get, and the hot pots are about $13.95-15.95 (I think).  They didn't give us the popcorn tho, or any of the side dishes to munch on while they were making out food.  That was kind of disappointing.  They brought out 4 small side dishes to share between 6 people... SERIOUSLY?! c'man!  Kind of ridiculous... you know we're going to order more in like 2 seconds.\n\nOverall, the food was fantastic!  The restaurant really looked like a restaurant =P  The bill between 6 people for 1 appetizer, and 3 entrees was about $58 = $13.35 / person.

The fish cake soup is superb and their kim chee fried rice is classic.  We've had KCFR at a lot of Korean restaurants and this one ranks in the top three.\n\nIt's located in Outer Sunset, so be prepared to drive out there if you're from the real \"city.\"  It's hidden inside the deep grid of matchbox houses, so if you feel like you're driving through a half-sketchy neighborhood, you're in the right place.  The truth is, it's not that sketchy and it's not that drab-- it's the weather that drives the mood.  Come here on a hot summer day and you'll think you're in East L.A. (Okay, not a good comparison).\n\nAnyways, this is not your Korean BBQ place.  We're Chinese so for the non-Koreans, this is not the kind of restaurant you go to and eat bulgogi with dol sot bi bab.  They have beef but it's not the kind that comes out on a searing platter.  We'd get more technical, but this all sounds better in layman's terms.  They also don't have the small dishes of seaweed, tofu, pickled cucumber, and other random snacks.  This place is all about single orders, so be mentally prepared.\n\nAlso, it's not smoky and humming like Korean BBQ places.  They blast Kpop music, so be prepared for some S.E.S-flavored (we like old school beats) melodies.  The decor is also nice.  The low ceilings and compartments make the place feel intimate, as if your ah-jim-mah was cooking you some hearty meal.\n\nOverall, great place to stop by if you're around the area.  It's open until 2 a.m., so it's perfect for the Sunset clubbers (that's a joke).  Beware of the serious Asian crowd... if you're non-Asian, you WILL stand out. \n\nWe couldn't give this place four stars simply because of service.  It's a bit pricey ($10-15 plates), so one would compare this to My Tofu House or a value-priced Brothers and say it's sub-par.\n\nThat's our perspective. We're aware that we generalized all Korean food, which is very ignorant, but it's easier for review purposes.

You could tell that there were real strawberries involved in the making of this soju because there were seeds at the bottom of the bottle.

We ordered 3 dishes and we finsihed everything! :D \nWe ordered chicken giblets (sth like gizzards?) and it's on a sizzling plate.. it's a little too oily and burnt; and become flavorless after we tried the other spicier dishes. We also ordered sth like a Korean Salad (forgot the name), with apples, cabbage and shellfish and bunch of other veggie.. it's VERY spicy but i really like it. I have never tried anything like that in other Korean restaurant. THe third dish we ordered is a hot pot (tofu soup with fish) -- it's not as spicy as the salad dish and the soup taste really good with rice.\n\nThe only complaint is the lack of variety of the side dishes... they should have a larger variety like other korean restaurant.. \nBut over all it's a very good, garage restaurant (I think the owner and family lives upstairs).", "author": "Doris H."}

Well, after my experience at Toyose, I've learned to never judge a garage by it's door. Aside from the novelty of eating in a converted-garage restaurant, the food was tasty, the staff friendly (albeit a tad on the slow side) and the soju refreshing.\n\nThe appetizers were definitely the highlight. The kimchi (sp?) pancake and fried chicken wings standout in my memory. You've got to have your game together for me to pick apart chicken bones and these were amazing - super crispy, salty and spicy. The kimchi pancake was warm, doughy and salty. \n\nThe main dishes were good but I could have had another pancake. We shared the baby octopus spicy noodle dish and fish hot pot. Both were flavorful and good. The pork shoulder was presented beautifully on the plate but it was a vegetarian nightmare and it was served cold. Ugh. I'll chock that up to inexperience with korean menus. \n\nAs a people, the Koreans must be great conservers of water and have marvelously low baseline blood pressures because the salt content is HIGH. I didn't realize this fact until about 4am when I woke up dying of thirst. If you're like me, keep a glass of water bedside but definitely don't let a little sodium chloride keep you from Toyose.\n\nGreat place for a salty singles v-day dinner.", "author": "Corey F."}

Good thing another friend came earlier to wait for the tables. There is a surprising amount of space in the little garage. Although the outside looked like a garage with a cheap scratched up sign hanging in front of it, the decor on the inside was similar to many other korean restaurants. I prefer this dimmer lighting styled restaurant than that of the brightly lit, white walled TOFU HOUSE in richmond - it just reminds me too much of a hospital. They had nifty little doorbells on the INSIDE of the place, spaced out along the walls - this was quite useful because the whole night I only saw one waitress for the whole place.\n\nThe food was okay, pretty mediocre and a little on the expensive side for what you get. I tasted two different types of pancakes, forgot which ones but they were pretty good. The chicken wings are a little dry and crunchy on the outside for me but still very edible. The Korean fried rice was more like bibimbap with a sunny side up egg on top, but it was tasty and had a nice creamy texture and taste because of the yolk melding with the rice. The eel was again mediocre, I did not even remember the taste after I ate it. The bulgogi was soggy on the bottom of the pan, and I prefer mine a little less wet. The soldier soup casserole thing was a rip off though, $2 for an additional pack of ramen?? I'll just bring one from the corner store next time (although it is the shin raymun brand instead of top ramen). \n\nWe had the yogurt flavored soju, which had the same flavor as those Asian yogurt drinks in the little plastic bottles with the red foil cap.\n\n- One waitress, but the food service wasn't slow, you just had to press the indoor bells to get extras (ie: napkins, water, etc)\n- I hear this place gets very crowded, but it probably wasn't today, less than half hour wait for a table for 11\n-Nice place to hang out and snack on stuff with your friends, especially if its later in the night and you guys have already had dinner or most other places are closed\n\nOverall 4 stars (3.5 for food, 5 for mood and atmosphere, 3 for price).", "author": "Colin H."}

Octopus stew loaded with the tender cephalopod, also in a chili sauce,  featued peppers, carrots, onion and mushroom. The serving size was enough for 6 at least. Yelpers overwhelmingly recommended the kimchee rice, a very comforting dish. Bits of beef in a saucy rice overtopped with a perfect sunnyside up egg. The dish stands alone and was my overall favorite. Four dishes of banchan were served, pickled seaweed, soybeans, kimchee and dried fish. All were fine, none outstanding, but the pickled daikon served with the chicken sure was! Definitely order more! Service was efficient and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-18", "description": "Great restaurant even though I wonder if it's the best idea for business to have your restaurant facade looking like a garage door.  Inside, you'll find a nice cozy little place that's great for small or large groups.  I recommend the kimchi beef fried rice, seafood pancake, and bulgogi.  We also had the fried chicken wings but they were just ok.  The kimchi fried rice is unlike any other that I have had before.  I used to have Korean food in LA a lot and it used to have spicy kimchi flavor in it but Toyose did not have that.  However, whatever flavor it is (I don't know how to describe it) was very very good, just not what I was expecting.  Bulgogi was also spot on.  We also ordered some strawberry soju but they have a bunch of different flavors and it was pretty good.  Parking was also a breeze.  I'll definitely be going there again.", "author": "Derrick C."}

We made reservations for 8:00 pm and were not seated until 8:30. Thirty minutes is a ridiculous amount of time to wait when you have made reservations. The waitresses were very cold and unapologetic about it.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe atmosphere is laid back and I actually like it, which is my reason for 2 stars instead of 1. However, it is a little cramped If you sit in the front, it may be a little uncomfortable and awkward because many people wait inside so expect someone to be facing you while you eat. Sitting in the back is better.\n\nFood:\nThe food is decent/mediocre but severely overpriced. Expect the entrees to average about $13-$14 each with medium sized portions. The side dishes are very small, unappealing, and flavorless. They give very little with no refills. We ordered several bottles of soju and I found them to be very inconsistent. We ordered the same flavor twice and one was weaker than the other.\n\nService: \nAWFUL! We were ingnored on many occasions. There is a call button you can press and the waitresses will come over. We pressed it many times and it was canceled at least 3 times. Also, we asked for popcorn 3 times only to have the requests ignored. In the end, the waitress finally came out and told us they only give you one small bowl of popcorn per bottle of soju. We ordered $280 of food and alcohol and they refused to give us popcorn which costs very little. Seriously? We ordered 6 bottles of soju which costed $11 each and they can't give us a little popcorn? I have never seen a place so frugal up to the point where it actually infuriated me. When we received our bill, they overcharged us for 9 bottles of soju instead of 6.  My guess for the bad service is because our party was already paying gratuity. They feel they can give us bad service while taking our money so that can focus on tables where they have to actually EARN their tips. \n\nInstead of trying to do things that will get customers to come back, they are only worried about milking you for every penny at that very moment. I don't find this a good business practice and because of that, I don't see myself going back. There are several other places like similar to this place and I suggest trying those first before trying this one.\n\nAlso, when we were leaving, everyone waiting for a table looked very pissed off. From what I see, once people sit down, they don't leave for a while so expect a long wait.", "author": "T H."}

FIRST it was going to be at Farmer Brown's, but because of their stupid policy of each person spending a minimum of $30 and a ridiculous coordination fee of $50 we decided to be a little more considerate to our birthday guests and go elsewhere. I mean c'mon Farmer Brown, how RIDICULOUS can you be? Anyway, moving on...\n\nI called the night before the dinner and they made reservations for 20 EASILY. Now, you ask... is it really in a garage???? YES! It is. But it doesn't really look like it from the inside, they do a very good job of decorating / designing it so it doesn't look like one. The food is pretty good... there were a few dishes I didn't care for too much, and then there were some that were soo good!\n\nGet one of their \"casseroles\". It's more like a huge pot of spicy soup with meat and ramen and veggies in it. It's pretty spicy, but very yummy... it's large and meant to be shared. The kimchee fried rice is also a good one to get, and isn't that spicy for those who can't take the heat. The bulgogi and calamari was alright... the spicy pork was very tasty.\n\nGoing with a big group is fun, and I hear they are open until 4am (but yelp says they open until 2am) so it seems like it would be a good late night joint for the party peoples.

Here's what I've had at Toyose:\n\nKim chi bokkeumbap - Tastes really great but the portion is really kind of small for being 10 or 11 dollars. If it was 1.5x bigger I think it's totally worth it. I really like how they put a nice egg on the top. \n\nSeafood doenjangjjigae - This one is really great at Toyose. Probably my favorite thing I had here. I'll order this every time. \n\nSpicy  fried chicken  - Nice and crispy, it could be a little spicier but doesn't really matter. I love the pickled radish and side salad that comes with this. \n\nOhjingeo bokkeum - This one is tasty too, and good variety of veggie in there. \n\nLemon and Yogurt soju cocktail - lemon is tastier! it's 11 dollars for one oil dispenser sized portion. they also have peach, pineapple, cranberry which is more selection than Arang.\n\nThe waitress working here on Monday night was really friendly and nice.

I enjoyed it but I came with such high hope for the glaze on the wings and soft tofu in mind but left with either things satisfied. \nIt seems to me most people come here with a group of friends and order food with soju so I guess that might make it a good place to hang out and eat good food but to satisfy my soft tofu craving I wouldn't come here for that especially for the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-21", "description": "I am a little bit surprised by a lot of the reviews that this place has received on Yelp. Quite frankly this restaurant is underwhelming at most. Below I have detailed out the reasoning behind my rating based on all of the elements that I feel contribute to an overall great restaurant experience.\n\nLocation/Appearance - Yes this place is located in what looks like a garage. Once one gets over the fact that it is a funky location and appears like a garage you will realize that you are deep in the Outer Richmond eating in a crammed restaurant. Three of the tables are actually located right next to the bathroom. This restaurant is very small. The tables are somewhat fun because of the way you are seated. However, the overall size and proximity to the bathroom really brings down the rating in my book.\n\nFood - This was probably the most disappointing part of Toyose in my opinion. I cannot understand why so many people are leaving positive feedback about the food. It is truly overwhelming when compared to the reviews that it has been getting. We tried the Kimchi Fried Rice, the Spicy Pork, and the Katsu Chicken. I enjoyed the creativity behind the Kimchi Fried Rice, but quite frankly the overall flavors from the rice dish were nonexistent. It tasted like something similar to what you can get at any fast food Korean or Chinese restaurant in the area. The Spicy Pork was good but not outstanding. I think there are many other places that I would go for spicy pork as opposed to Toyose. The Katsu Chicken was even worse as it had a horrible flavor to it. The food also arrived really quickly which of course gives me the feeling that it was not very fresh at all and everything was likely pre-cooked.\n\nService - The restaurant has an interesting system for getting the attention of the hostess and waitresses. There is a button at each table that enables you to call on the waitress whenever you are ready to order. This makes the ordering process flawless and quick. The service was actually very good. They did make a mistake on our original order but fixed it very quickly.\n\nOverall - My thinking is that this place is known as a late night place to grab food and drinks with friends. It seems that because it is open late it has become a destination for small groups looking to grab a few beers and eat some filling food. However, for any purpose other than grabbing late night food I would pass. Toyose just does not do anything really the great.", "author": "Bennett D."}

A lot bigger than I imagined given it's a Sunset house garage. Cheesy decor, but you get past it when you see the screen that can come down for more privacy and the wait staff call button..and of course the food and soju! \n\nMy companion and I order the following: \n- Green onion seafood pancakes - Not a fan of seafood usually, but the tentacles and the like embedded in the pancake were well masked with the actual pancake and sauce. I'm glad we ordered it as it appears to be one of their specialties. \n- Kimchee fried rice - Love the raw egg atop it; makes it more like bi bim bap and I LOVE bi bim bap. Flavors were right on point and I helped myself to a hefty portion of the platter. \n- Gyozas - Nothing to sing about, but definitely done right in terms of crispiness and arrived pipping hot. Generous portion too, if I recall. \n- Marinated pork with tofu - Mmmmm...unlike any pork dish I've had at a Korean restaurant. Tangy and sweet and overall well seasoned pork with fresh tofu pieces. I'd order that again! \n- Yogurt soju - Very good flavor. Though not the best I've had. Prefer it to have a thicker consistency. \n- Other flavored soju (most likely peach as it's my and my companions second favorite usual flavor): The fact I can't truly recall makes me conclude it wasn't that memorable. But we did finish off both. \n\nOverall, the portions were generous, and we brought leftovers in the fried rice, pork/tofu and pancake. The wait staff weren't super attentive, but did respond quickly to the \"call button\". Go early on a weekday for quick seating. I'll likely go again as the food seemed very authentic and I agree with the many that have said, \"...it's like eating at a Korean mama's kitchen.\"", "author": "Marie B."}

This is the Korean version of American bar food. \n\n***A hint to non-Koreans. Koreans don't wait on tables, like Americans. You literally have to call them over.

But seriously, I really do wish it was open for lunch! We'd be there everyday. For the food, of course.\nA few tips:\n1.) Dinner time is pretty much between 6:30-9. Anytime after that is just gonna be full of people drinking. But the wait is not as long.\n2.) CALL AHEAD. Seriously. I've made the mistake of walking in at 7pm on a Friday and had to wait nearly an hour. Now I know better and call a day or two ahead to reserve a table. \n3.) Since it's kinda true most of their dishes taste like kimchi, expect their Kimchi dishes to taste especially delicious. Kimchi Jjigae and Kimchi fried rice, I'm lookin' at you!\n4.) They're strict on checking ID's but not about the actual underage drinking taking place. My friends and I shared ONE shot glass before and we were right by the register/kitchen, impossible not to notice what we were doing. \n\nI love Korean food, and this is my favorite Korean place to hit up.

For the price, the portions were decent and the quality was good. I also thought their establishment was creative and unique. They were able to turn the garage of an Outer Sunset house into a small Korean restaurant and bar which is very cool.\nBut the place loses points because of the fact that it's small, a little too small in my opinion. I really hate it when people watch me eat. We were seated in a booth right next to the waiting area. People waiting to be seated were literally right next to us, facing our table, watching us.

If it weren't for the Toyose sign and some Christmas lights, I would've driven right past it. My BF and I came here last night after hearing positive things from a friend. We got there early only to see that the place didn't open until 6pm, so we decided to sit in the car and talk. Once 6pm rolled around, we went inside and the place was already filling up quickly. \n\nThe skinny on this place in a few bullet points:\n\nFood - 3.5 stars\n- Better than most Korean places in the city. \n- Seafood pancake was good, but too salty. Quantity was enough to feed about four people. \n- Corn cheese was good at first, but only the first couple of bites. Once the dish cooled down, it became big blobs of hard cheese clumps. It's a good dish to try on the first time with a bunch of people who can finish it off within minutes of being served, but we can do without during future visits. Dish would have been better with some tabasco or hot sauce on the side.\n- Spicy fried chicken wasn't bad at all. The batter was crunchy and meat was moist. Contrary to some of the reviews I read about the fried chicken, quality was pretty good and it was a lot better than I expected. \n- Kimchi and pork chiggae was the highlight of the evening. Instead of pork bits, Toyose used pork belly meat. The choice of meat made the dish more enjoyable as the fat soaked up the flavors of the soup. Excellent soup for a cold day.\n- No pan chan included in the meal. Mind you, this is a Korean drinking place, not a typical sit down restaurant. \n\nAmbiance and facilities - 4 stars\n- I'm a fan of little Korean drinking holes. It's where my BF and I usually hang out at in So. Cal with friends, so it's nice to finally find one in the city. \n- Decor reminds me of a lot of Korean restaurants in LA/OC. Feels homey and makes me happy. \n- This place gets really packed, so if you end up sitting by the front entrance, people waiting to be seated will be standing right next to you while you eat and cheering for you to finish the meal quickly. Really awkward. \n- Restroom was clean and big. \n\nPrice - 2.5 stars\n- SOOOOO expensive for Korean food! Maybe it's because there aren't that many good Korean restaurants in the city, so Toyose has the ability to inflate their prices. Seriously though... $25 for a boodaechiggae? It looked like it would only serve 3-4 people too. \n\nOverall good experience. Average rating 3.5 stars, but rounded up since I will most likely come back again.", "author": "Teresa Y."}

The service...well, people who go there to drink usually just want to hang out, to take their time. They have a bell where you can press and the server will come shortly.

They also have good food too. Their fried chicken is crunchy and hot, but not spicy hot. Their potato croquettes are equally yummy without that sauce they serve with it. I really like this place because you can just sit here and drink all the soju you can drink (for a price), that is whatever you can tolerate. I still don't understand the whole concept behind serving soju with popcorn, but whatever, this place is cool. My favorite soju is the peach flavor, pineapple is good too, but nothing compares to peach. Try it, you'll like it...and push the button.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

We told them we were a party of 6 and they said it would be about a 45 minute wait and that they would call us when our table was ready. So we waited. But we were not allowed to stand inside the restaurant [my friend complained about this, since she knew that the last time she went there, her party of 10 was able to]. We were out in the shivering cold [because the beach/ocean was down a couple of blocks], for about a good hour! We all took turns to go inside to see if anyone was finished eating, and when it was my turn, the lady just gave me a hard, annoying look.

We stepped in and ordered spicy chicken wings and this kim-chi soup that had hot dogs in it.  Delicious.  Authentically spicy and delicious.\n\nThe booth had this buzzer to summon the waitress, but that is a bit bourgeois for me, so we just called her using internationally known hand signals, and the service was good.\n\nOverall, very very good.", "author": "Stan L."}

Moist, not oily, eat it with the radish kimchee (koko bang style).  The kimchee and tofu with pork belly was good maybe slightly heavy on the sesame oil. Spicy cod soup came later in the meal piping hot, not too spicy.  Combo of fish, red pepper, fermented miso paste and zucchini is actually quite complimentary.\n\nLocation is easy to find off the 35th ave highway.  It is a converted garage which also brought me back to some of the makeshift eateries in Korea.  It was a bit drafty and kitchy but you dont come here for the decor.  We got there right after it opened so we sat right away.  It gets PACKED so arrive early.  Service was good.  The aisles are tight and the 2 waitresses are zipping around serving boiling hot soups so expect to wait a little once the place heats up.  Prices are not cheap but not too high either.  The banchan was not as plentiful as in other places (perhaps keeping the prices reigned in) and the cabage kimchee was not as good as my wifes.  \n\nWe'll be back for the pork foot and soju.

I'd say that you should not come here unless you have a small group. I had seven people and we waited for an hour and a half - there is literally nothing to do in the area but loiter. As you know from the other reviews, this restaurant is in a garage. The restaurant is extremely small, if you have parties larger than four, you'll have to sit on those small plastic chairs for kids that you can get in Chinatown. I ordered the spicy fried chicken, spicy sausage/spam casserole, seafood hot pot, spicy beef, and some spicy fishcake. The majority of the menu is spicy so beware. The fried chicken was nice, the casserole was pretty bland to me, I wouldn't pay $23 for hot dogs, spam, spicy tomato broth, and a block of ramen, would you?  Well, I did and I don't think it was worth it. The best part of the dinner was probably the waitresses, they were really efficient in getting everything.

A friend took me here once and it was challenging to find the place again the second time.  It is in the residential area within the Sunset district, away from the clusters of shops along Noriega.  The owner must've converted the garage of his house, put tables and chairs along this really narrow room, and install tiny bells on each table that you can press for service.\n\nThe food was awesome - you wouldn't find the usual bulgogi / galbi / soon tofu here.  My Korean friend told me that this is a korean 'bar', instead of a korean 'restaurant' (hence they serve different kinds of food O_O).  I always order the 'everything soup' (bu te ji ge), being a spicy stew filled with spam, sausage, pork, cabbage and egg noodles, served in metal pot (enough for 3 people).  Last time I went there we also ordered deep fried chicken wing - which is also great.  \n\nThis place opens super late... I think it closes at 2AM every day.

Just to verify this was the actual protocol for Toyose my girlfriend called them when we arrived home. and asked if they could accommodate a party of two? \"Yes\" we were told, they even said they could hurry us in if we got there soon. She then asked to speak to a manger. who ever had answered the pone claimed to be so, after relaying the story to them the person on the other end of the phone said I had lied to my girlfriend and that she had in fact offered us a place in line for seating. I am still not completely sure why they refused us service or to admit to their lies, but as soon as we walked in the door \n the vibe was similar to (as the late comedian and prophet Bill Hicks put it)\" walking into the middle of a Klan rally dressed in a Boy George outfit\".\nto put it lightly.\n It is just whimsical thinking to suppose the restaurants of San Francisco have done away with segregation.", "author": "john e."}

We started off with the kim chi fried rice which was really good.  It wasn't a lot of food split 4 ways but it was a good starter.  Next, the pancake and spicy casserole came out.  The casserole was basically a pot of spicy broth and a bunch of meat, tofu and vegetables.  Very homey.  I liked it a lot and would definitely go back.  To top it off, we ordered two bottles of soju, a yogurt and a strawberry flavored one.  The soju here is pretty good.\n\nThis is a great place to eat and drink with a small group of friends.

I ordered the Kimchi fried rice with shrimp and their spicy chicken wings. Upon arrival, I was surprised to see how nice it was on the inside considering the front is just the typical garage door. However, it was packed! I mean there were people waiting outside to get seated. \n\nThe waitress was friendly, and she is good looking too. With all that said, can you guess how much the order cost me? No, not $15. Nope! not $20. You guessed it...$28. Now, I don't mind paying up if I'm getting my money's worth. However, I didn't. Their Kimchi fried rice was just okay with a bitter aftertaste to it which i don't like. Their chicken wings was okay; it was crunchy and soft on the inside, but I've had better. \n\nOverall, this is a great place to take a date if you're the college type and in your 20's. Moreover, you won't be disappointed by the meal, but you won't be thrilled either. However, you must be prepared to spend some money. A dinner for two should run you close to $80 or more. \n\nPros: \nGreat atmosphere for a hole in the wall.\nFriendly staff.\nYoung crowd.\nVery intimate. Ideal for a first date.\nGood menu and food is okay.\nOpens late.\nBar right across the street!\n\nCons:\nOverrated!!\nExpensive for the college student on a budget.\nIt's small.\nNot ideal for older folks.\nNot ideal for take out.", "author": "Akinyemi O."}

Based on the big picture, I'll have to give this restaurant a 5 because it is so unique.", "author": "Robert C."}

Other than that, the food and the services are great! My favorites are the chicken wings, Kim Chi fried rice, chicken gizzard, and the spicy squid noodles. Of course, you must try their different favors of Soju as well. Yogurt and strawberry are my recommendations!", "author": "Maggie L."}

AND my KIMCHI is authentic as it can get, since my mommy made it ... \n\nthe great part of this place is (can't help to be biased) there ain't no asian gangsters protectin their turf inside toyose, or am i just being blind???  and parking isn't that bad ... \n\na true gem in sf, since this is the land of cantos ... no need to drive all the way to santa clara ... just hop in your car and drive over to the outer sunset..", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Its in a garage but once you step in your in a whole new world.  I guess that's the appeal of this restaurant as well.   The soju is exceptional here(my favorite was the strawberry soju).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-09", "description": "This place was actually nicer than I expected - well, all I really expected was a sheet-rocked garage with a couple of tables. Finally came here with a friend who'd been many times before but he was no help when it came to ordering. Maybe cause he wasn't Korean, or maybe cause he was drunk all the times he's been here and couldn't remember the signature dishes.  Came here on a Thursday night around midnight- the crowd was young and drunk and apparently one girl yacked right next to our table.  I didn't see it, but we sure smelled it -blech.  We had the kimchee fried rice and a fish liver tofu stew (eh- I think I envisioned a richer ankimo type of liver) and a \"picher\" of OB. Considering this is a converted garage and the panchan offering is a bowl of popcorn, I didn't think it was all that great for $50.  I'll probably try it again with more friends (i love being with my friends, but I really love em when it means I can try more dishes!)", "author": "Amina B."}

I didn't understand what she meant by it, but when we approached the restaurant I almost passed right by it. It looked like a garage...lol. When we entered the restaurant I was impressed by the transformation, it was cozy and had the quaint restaurant feel. The place wasn't packed, but there were 2 large parties when we entered. We were seated right away...it was great! As we looked through the menu I was surprised at all the different selections of food. I am the type though that looks at what everyone else has on their table, I noticed that there was a lot of hot pots which looked yummy. My friend had been there before, so I left her the honors of ordering. (I'm so glad I did) We ordered the Bulgogi, Kimchee Fried Rice and the Seafood Pancake. We also had the Yogurt Soju. EVERYTHING was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo freakin good! I was just bouncing up and down and nodding my head the entire time while eating (that translates to...I AM LOVING THE FOOD) The service was fast and they were definitely on top of their game that night. It looked like only 2 people were working that night and with the large parties, they were still very attentive. I did notice that there was a doorbell looking thing near our seating area, which I thought was odd...but after reading the other review I guess you use it when you need help. WELL...we didn't have to use it at all. I had such a great time there and I would go back in a heartbeat.", "author": "I LOVE ME SOME G."}

Once inside, you quickly notice that.... well, it's mainly Koreans comfortably burrowed into the table area... (those up to no-good will have their table 'shade' down).  But what a bit of Korean heaven this place is... anju...dried cuttlefish, 'rah-bok-kee', and yes, if you are curious, the wonderfully sliced and presented fruit plate. Crown Royale might not be the drink of choice, but choose a fruity-soju drink and watch as your friends declare... \"This tastes like nothing\" and then get ripped off their @$$e$.  Chase it down with the beer-flavored water they call Hite or OB Lager and you've got the makings of a good night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-29", "description": "This place is truly...MEH.  Interesting to eat in a converted garage, but the service we received was horrible.  The waitress gave us like 3 menus for 11 people.  It took us another 10 minutes to try to get more menus, and she was extremely rude about it.  We had to ask a bunch of times for water, utensils, and for the check.  Every time we tried to get her attention, we were pretty much ignored.  People were saying how cool those doorbell buzzer things were...yeah I guess they were cool for decoration, but they don't get the server to come over to you, so what's the point?  Oh yeah, did I mention, they cramped 11 people around a tiny table in the middle of a walkway instead of giving us two tables where we could have fit 5 and 6 comfortably?  Whatever.  Anyway...food.  Edible, but not that great.  Did I also mention that after waiting a good 20 minutes to order, half of our food was forgotten?  I digress.  The fried chicken was ok, my pinky noodles (rice cakes) and ramen weren't even that spicy...it reminded me of eating spaghetti-o's with siracha added.  Plus, the eggs weren't poached eggs, they were hardboiled...and I paid an extra $3 for them!  Mediocre food, horrible service.  Only a cool spot if I was drunk and craving more soju and korean snacks at 1AM.", "author": "Cheryl L."}

You will get the full effect of Korean bar culture.  Bottoms up!", "author": "Su Kyeong K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-17", "description": "Call ahead for a reservation, tried to go w/o one last week and there was a 2 hour wait @ midnight.   For 4 the perfect meal was the whole fried chicken (little dry, as bf pointed out, but other companion and i felt was decent/ good, but all together tasty) and the kimchee fried rice (soooo good, spicy served with a fried egg and nori on top..mmmmmm).  Between OB and Hite (the 2 Korean beers they serve) I'd go hite all the way next time.  OB is pretty watery, like miller light, hite has more flavor. The 'pitcher' is really a 1.5 liter plastic bottle that serves a party of four light drinkers well.  We, on the other hand had a party of 3 and had 2 ob pitchers and a 'bottle' (22oz.) of hite plus 2 bottle of soju,  and the chicken and kimchee rice coming to $85, which i think is pretty decent for beer, alcohol and dinner for 3.  Cheap bastards of the naan and curry variety need not apply.  Anything is expensive to people who won't pay more than $3 for curry.  Call ahead, request a booth, drop the bamboo shade, and bring your dominoes.", "author": "Emily X."}

KFC genetic modified poultry?  nooo they've closed a few hours ago!  let me search yelp!  Toyose pops up and it's only a few blocks away!  Reading reviews...oh look, the korean fried chicken is good.  Put in an order for korean fried chicken plus kimchi fried rice.  10 minutes later i'm picking up the food.  The cool thing is that Toyose is built where the garage should be, but total restaurant feel once you get in.  Individual booths.  Seems like a cool place to take your drinking buddy.  The bill was a little steep, $25 for chicken and korean fried rice, but when your fiending for food at this hour of night it's kinda worth it...supply and demand people!  The next time I visit will probably be with a drinking buddy just to hang out.  BTW the food was tasty...it hit the spot...and the pickled daikon was great!", "author": "LittleBird 8."}
