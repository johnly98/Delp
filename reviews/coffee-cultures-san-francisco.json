And that is an excellent differentiator because you don't need to choose between caffeine and a dessert in the afternoon.  Probably not good for a diet, but definitely a nice treat.\n\nAffogato: When you want ice cream, but you put on airs like you're just heading out for a coffee drink.  The ice cream looked like cheap soft serve, but tasted way better than any Mister Softee.  Very creamy and sweet.  The bitter espresso shot was the perfect pairing.  Like a mature adult ice cream float.  And the best part is it turned into a creamy coffee beverage at the end when all the ice cream was either eaten or melted.\n\nMilkshake: Love how they don't even try to pawn this off as coffee beverage that just happens to be high caloric.  Nope, it's a milkshake that's made with ice cream, two espresso shots and some chocolate syrup.  And it's delicious; way tastier than an icy Frappuccino.", "author": "Adam B."}

Why am I being charged for a latte when all I wanted is steamed milk and on top of that being surcharged for the type of milk I want? \nDo yourself a favor and go up the street to Coffee Bar where I got a 16 oz steamed oat milk for $2.00 versus 12 oz steamed oat milk $4.50 \nEven if you go to Starbucks and order just a steamed milk they charge you as such. They don't charge you for a latte and give you only streamed milk. \nIf you are going there for a latte this place is fabulous but if you want something simple be prepared to pay more than double for not as much product.\nOh yeah and even when you get steamed it's lukewarm.", "author": "Jen C."}

Awkward moment...so I just proceeded to order a drink and a pastry and paid, leaving a 24% tip and a sincere thank you. I got a mumbled \"mmhm\" without eye contact. It seemed that making fun of a street performer outside was more important than being professional and friendly to paying customers. I received my drink, which I will say looked beautiful, and again I expressed my gratitude. The barrista responded with a barely audible \"yeah, thanks\" with no eye contact.

I'm waiting for that guy to paint what has to be the next in his series, dogs ordering lattes. That would be genius. And it should be set in Coffee Cultures because it's the kind of compact place that would likely attract a group of caffeine-addicted canines in long knit caps and sunglasses and covered from collar to tail in tattoos. That's the kind of surreal image I had in my head when I waited in line for their human counterparts to order their lattes.\n\nActually it's the baristas that have the tattoos. The customers are usually the snotty white-collar types who are besties with their egos and their smartphones. I find the baristas here quite friendly and not overly talkative (photo: http://bit.ly/1k70VK9). This is a point of contention at my nearby office where a few colleagues have found them rude and abrupt. Physician heal thyself. Maybe they should buy a dog painting. All I know is that I always get a very well-crafted Latte for $3.75 that I find quite satisfying (photo: http://bit.ly/1ngqR9q). The Counter Culture coffee they serve is generally smooth and rich.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Straus soft-serve frozen yogurt. Delicious and not overly creamy. Just two flavors, and I usually favor the vanilla with a touch of cardamom (photo: http://bit.ly/1jviTFF). That's the perfect afternoon snack when my egg salad sandwich from Lee's Deli just doesn't cut it. Did I mention it's less than a block away from my workplace? So obviously I'm swayed by the convenience factor and my ability to go with co-workers who want to huddle away from the office. Nothing like gossip and soft-serve.

The latte isn't as strong as I usually like it and there was quite a bit of foam on the top, but the true star here is the almond croissant! The almond croissant didn't taste like artificial almond flavoring and was quite tasty! They cut the croissant in half and a layer of sweet custard? Was added in. It's a pretty thin layer so it didn't make the croissant hard to bite into or too sweet! Also they dusted the top off with real sliced almonds and powered sugar! Really good and not that sweet! The thing though, was that the layers of the croissant was not that apparent inside (dough and lamination) and the texture is more on the softer side. I would say 3 stars. \n\n   Add one more star because the employees look like they know how to have fun! Laughing and joking, to each other, which made the whole place seem less bougie to me.

Incessant stomach grumbles accompany each lethargic step towards the dingy bus stop littered with remnants of wind-swept trash. Once crammed into the trembling, nauseating shuttle with dozens of riders wearing vacant stares, a resigned sigh precedes premonitions of the doom waiting at the faraway desk.\n \nThen, a desperate mental foray accidentally rediscovers the oasis of COFFEE CULTURE'S ALMOND CROISSANT.\n \nAnticipating the crispy, flaky croissant exterior enlivens half-dead taste buds; imagining the slightly underbaked and tender doughy innards whispers reassurance to a yearning stomach; and remembering the copious dusting of snowy powdered sugar causes a noticeable skip in heartbeat. A choice between flavorful, familiar dark coffee brew, potently biting iced coffee or strongly layered mocha provides a supportive backdrop for the palatial pastry.\n \nSunshine slowly but surely begins to seep in through the windshield as the bus hurtles towards a more promising outlook for the day, reintroducing color, warmth, and hope.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Of course, I promised to come check it out, and I was not disappointed. After my first latte here, I texted my friend to say, \"You have introduced me to the nectar of life.\" The coffee is fabulous; the baristas know what they are doing; and best of all, they do it with good humor and general loveliness. Despite being in a high traffic spot, they remember individuals -- like myself ::blushes:: And they joke about saving me a savory pastry or tease me about being late for work, as they hand me a cup of flawless latte art. \n\nSad news is: I'm leaving my office job around the corner.

In other reviews of coffee shops in SF that put people, the depth of coffee, the connection across cultures forward in their work, I've waxed on & on about it. Here is another shop that is doing just that. And you know what... it may be even more important because of its location. In the austere, de-personalized Financial District of Sansome & Bush, we now have a business that cares about the personable relationship of coffee & people, & you & the shop. The architecture of cities plays a deep role in how people interact with each other. We've heard the sanguine story before: rote business models before best practices of people. In the changing climate of work, we're a new group of people who can remain heartfelt in the face of business, even financial business. \n\nThe words that come to mind of this place is: luxe, warming, courageous, fun!, and loving the cups of coffee that come out of here. A gold spoon served with their espresso was one thing. The next... a raspberry. Yes, a raspberry. A pairing. Coffee is a drink just like wine. It's fermented in its process often, and fruits / food can bring out a whole new level of character. \n\nLook, you can take it as stand offish & snobby, but damn if you don't see how people love their craft & get way into everything. That's how this city works: we get way into everything we do, & out comes opinions. We have opinions here -- that's how this website works -- and coffee, through centuries, has incited even goats to have an opinion on how to live. If you're into ritual, conversations, caffeine, and fun -- pure luxurious but affordable fun -- this is it. Right, smack, in the middle of the Financial District.

To the side a small seating area features stools stolen from your high-school's chemistry lab and big picture windows opening out to Bush Street, reminding customers that the distance between the cozy space of coffee cultures and the expansive horror of their workdays is just a plate glass window away. Music plays loudly, the triumphant chords and soaring melodic lines and vapid lyrics of modern \"indie\" corporate-rock pump people up for their workday, or remind them that it could be so much worse, they could have to spend the day working in a place that played shitty music and dished up caffeine to pissed-off businessmen and women. \n\nAlthough the propinquity of Coffee Culture's location is more notable then their coffee, they do a pretty good job nevertheless. Although their drip is of the self-serve, large batch variety, they use good, Counter-Culture beans, and take enough care in the process the brew isn't over extracted, preserving essential character of the roast is maintained, with bright overtones of tropical fruit and citrus coming through clearly on most days. Espressos are well-pulled and highly concentrated; again, the beans make all the difference. The coffee (and comestibles) are expensive (3.25 for a large drip or toddy-brewed iced coffee, 2.75 for espresso), but you're paying for a quality cup, for the convenient location and for the luxury of knowing that you're drinking one of the best cups of coffee in the Financial District, instead of the over roasted swill from one of the legions of Peets and Starbucks.\n\nFour Stars: Good location, good coffee, high prices, next to the express bus.\n\nExtras: \n\nDid I mention its closeness to the express lines?  Specifically Nx, 2, 3, 8x, 76x, 1ax, 1bx, 30x, 31ax, 31bx, 38ax, 38bx, and 81x? Thats an almost pornographic number of \"x\"es\n\nAlso close to GGT 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24.\n\nSoft serve (uncaffinated) available.", "author": "Casey U."}

Im not a giant coffee drinker, but their Vanilla lattes are excellent and made from high quality ingredients. \n\nThe owners and long time employees there are awesome to interact with and one of the reason I come back. They had 1 female barista in the past that was less than pleasant, however, I don't see her in there anymore. She just couldn't seem to crack a smile in the morning! I think they know that people still want (and deserve) friendly customer service when you're paying top dollar for your food and/or beverage.

I swear I know every coffee spot around my work - so I HAD to walk into this place since I've never heard of it before. \n\nThe environment is super hip and trendy, like a coffee shop should be in San Francisco! I had no idea what to order, so the guy working there (which btw, also matched the trendy ambiance) recommended an iced, almond milk, cardamom latte. I did tell him that I like strong tasting coffee, but when I got the coffee it was too milky for me. Totally not his fault though, how would he know what \"strong\" means, since it probably means something different to everyone he talks to. \n\nSo, at this point I probably would've rated this place a 2 because of my lack-of-tasting-coffee but then we ran into one of the owners (which btw, started Coffee Bar) and he asked me how my coffee could be improved! Really awesome that they take constructive criticism, especially for a new business! So okay, that conversation totally saved them from a \"2\" rating to a \"4\" rating - bravo Coffee Cultures!

The first time I paid for a double espresso and was only given a single. The second time I ordered a soy pumpkin spice latte, and as I watched her make it, it looked like it was not made with soy milk. I pointed to the carton she used and she said, \"yeah, that's soy,\" like I'm an idiot. About half way through the drink I am realizing it is definitely not soy.. I go back down there to say something and looked at the carton again...it was WHOLE milk she used. I never make a big deal about incorrect orders, but she blatantly lied to my face so she wouldn't have to make a new one. I don't drink soy because it's trendy, I legit can't have lactose.

Actually, it is quite appropriate, as today is my 1 year anniversary that I sold my soul to Corporate America, I mean, I got a job working in the financial district. The one thing I have to look forward to everyday (and have this entire past year since I discovered this gem) is Counter Culture Coffee, on the daily (sometimes multiple times a day) I will order a macchiato for here, and sip it outside and people watch until it is time to go back to work. \n\nThe ambiance of this place is rustic, yet inviting (even though there are only bar style seating and some seating outside). It is often busy, but the people who work here are amazing, fast, professional, and know how to make a damn fine cup of coffee (yes that is a Twin Peaks reference). Shout out to Melissa, Taylor, Cody (used to work there), Justin, and girl with bangs and dark hair (I'm horrible and cannot remember your name) for being awesome :) \n\nTheir coffee is fresh and gets shipped to them quite frequently from their roastery, which I believe is in North Carolina. I typically buy a bag of their beans to take home with me and enjoy over the weekend. I have never been disappointed. I am a big fan of the pour over style-this is how I make my coffee at home so it is nice to see that they are doing this in house. Other great things include: all the pastries, Gibraltars, and cappuccinos. I have yet to try their tamales, but have heard amazing things about them.\n\nBest coffee shop in this area by far.
