Now is one of my favorite sushi places in the Bay Area. I was hesitant at first because of some of the reviews, but glad I didn't. Don't be fooled by them. In my experience within the delivery order, they were fast and under 1 hour waiting period. \n\nFood: \n\nGolden Gate-- 5/5. Super fresh and tastes super authentic unlike other places I've been to in the Bay Area! Super super good! \n\nRed Rocket Roll-- 5/5. This one was my favorite one out of the 2 I ordered. Tastes fresh, sauce was on point and the way they prepared the food is beyond good. I can see they really took the time and prepared it right for their customers. \n\nOverall: \n\nI'd come back-- not for the delivery but maybe to the actual place. They seem to serve damn good Sushi and non of the BS. I'm definitely going to order again.

Delivery driver shows up 45min late, hands me a pink box that weighs as much as air (I ordered like 5 rolls and chicken karaage). He insists I take the box and that it must be right. I vehemently disagree and refuse to take the bag back. He starts walking away and tells me to call the restaurant (I'm assuming he had no other deliveries in his car that might have been mine?). Call the restaurant, woman is hella rude. \"It's not here. We're busy. D you still want your order?\" Lol nah. I shouldn't have strayed from Oyogu.\n\n\n*update* I am weak and tried again later.

I said yes, so he gave me 2 pieces and delicious  . I told him right away add the 12 pieces combo. I came home and first thing I try was the sashimi, all the fish tasted fresh and vinegar rice was cooked just right. Then I try the rolls and I had nothing to say beside delicious!

The prices are good, and the quality was top notch. Saba sashimi, which is generally my test of a good sushi chef - always marinated just right, and never over \"cooked\". They let you customize and add extras to rolls. We love(d) all the Makimono rolls - all creative, unique and delicious... Tonight though? Something was unmistakably different. The baked salmon on top the Lion King was way overcooked, dry and hard. The unagi was chewy. Reminiscent to a badly rolled burrito, half the fillings of literally every roll were all the way at one end and missing from the opposite. This was not the sushi I knew and loved, but something far more inferior. So, because inquiring minds must know, I called the restaurant to ask what gives - Did someone call in sick?

For $13.50 you get two generous slabs with rice and steamed vegetables with a nice crunch. On my initial visit, the teriyaki sauce came on the side which I preferred. If you want yours on the side, be sure to request it since it came on the fish on my 2nd visit. My entree also came with a salad (love their gingery dressing), miso soup, and edamame. All this food was enough for two meals! \n\nMy friend enjoyed her Unagi-don (grilled eel over rice with Japanese pickles) and another friend enjoyed the Chirashi-sushi. I tried a bite of the sashimi and it was delicious. As for dessert, the mango ice cream and NY cheesecake were hard to resist, so we indulged in those too.\n\nThe service is friendly and helpful, the ambiance comfortable to enjoy a relaxed conversation. It wasn't too busy, but I did see a bunch of orders headed out for delivery. For added entertainment, they have a TV and serve beer (Sapporo and Asahi on draft), sake, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages. Their website has a menu.", "author": "Cathy K."}

There were so many on the menu that I had trouble picking. I like the beef tongue and the salmon with bacon the best. Order those if you want individual skewers. I would really waste my time with the vegetable skewers unless you are a vegetarian. \n\nThe pokimon salad is one of their most popular dishes, but I think it was okay. It was a little sour and not worth 6 dollars. It was made of raw salmon, seaweed, and other stuff. \n\nMy absolute fave though was the deep fried spicy tuna roll. I don't like raw anything so when I saw this, I jump at the chance. It was soooooo good! I can't even describe it. They put this orange sauce all over it and I could not stop eating.

Well, let me explain.\n\nSo this \"Japanese\" restaurant should definitely change their name (yes, it is a Chinese run restaurant not Japanese). On a sushi rating, its just ok, maybe a 5 out of 10. However, for their other dishes, I'd rate it a 9. Of course we ordered some sushi since you'd think they have great sushi since its in their name. Its good that we ordered a variety including sushi. I'll elaborate.\n\nFor starters we had some yakitori appetizers including the gyutan (skewered beef tongue) and the hotate bacon maki (scallops with bacon wrapped around it). The gyutan was one of the best I've had here in the city, while the hotate wasn't bad too. Not many places do gyutan so this is worth it if you are into that. We also got the ankimo appetizer, but it could be a bit fresher.\n\nOur main meal planned to be sushi so we ordered the staple to judge by - maguro and hamachi, plus some others that sounded interesting like fresh hotate, walu and shime saba. All were just ok, not mind blowing like I had hoped. After that tasting, we didn't expand to more of the menu.\n\nInstead, we had the dinner combos - tempura udon and a tonkatsu dinner. Now talk about a deal! The tempura was loaded with 2 shrimp and a myriad of veggies. This was like a double load at other restaurants. Plus, the tempura coating was perfect, not too heavy. Double thumbs up! My tonkatsu dinner was just as loaded. instead of just a single pork cutlet, there were 2! Definitely worth the price. From these 2 items alone, we would ultimately be back for more.\n\nParking can be a walk, but way easier than your Richmond/Sunset restaurant parking situation.\n\nTo wrap up, If you want some great Japanese food at reasonable prices, go to Sushi Shoh. For sushi however, you might want to pass.", "author": "Mark M."}

From the tapas section, we ordered:\n\n1. Agedashi Tofu - Very smooth tofu that was fried the right amount. Don't let it sit in the sauce too long or it gets a bit soggy.\n\n2. Gyu Kire Yaki - My favorite item of the item -- angus beef skewers. The meat is not tough and cooked just enough that you can tear the beef off with ease. I wish there were more than two pieces.\n\n3. Hamachi Kama - Delicious roasted yellow tail fish. I didn't use the lemon or sauce they provided. Didn't feel it was necessary. The meat next to the bone and fins are the best parts, of course. \n\nIn addition to these tapa items, we had the following:\n\n1. Chicken Teriyaki - This is a pretty great item to have in a meal by itself. The chicken skin is crispy but not burnt. The meat is juicy and the sauce is a great complement. It also comes with salad, rice, and miso soup.\n\n2. Caterpillar Roll - Tasty but pretty typical compared to other Japanese venues.\n\n3. Sashimi Omakase (for four people) - Very fresh fish! I enjoyed the salmon and tuna the most. \n\nService is great. Waitress smiles and provides a friendly atmosphere for her guest.  \n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this place.

The sushi is pretty terrible from the taste/texture of the rice to the quality of the fish. The hamachi tasted of nothing but iron-y protein. Edamame was even overcooked & mealy.\n\nI was ready to walk but the genius server asked if we'd like some free grilled pork? Oh Yes. I never turn down pork. But then I started to worry that it was off or something because it was free. \n\nThen it came and it was delicious. Then I took a close look at the menu and there is a good list of yakatori-they even made us chicken skin. The beef tongue was fantastic. Whole grilled squid was excellent too. The yakatori menu items were almost all perfectly grilled but the chicken skin. Not crispy enough. \n\nDont bother with sushi-let the yakatori chef in back take care of you.", "author": "Michelle M."}

We came here during off hours and there was practically no one here. The cuts of the fish were pretty stingy for the price. Sashimi for two is what I think they call it. Seriously? I was still hungry after my sashimi slices, so I ordered amaebi nigiri, saba nigiri and one salmon skin hand roll. Those took forever to arrive too! The quality was okay, but I've had worse elsewhere. Nice decorative interior though.\n\nI probably won't be going back there again.

We ordered a spicy scallop roll, a dragon roll, a Giants roll, and a deep fried spicy tuna roll. The dragon roll was similar to any other restaurant's and the spicy scallop roll wasn't all that. The deep fried spicy tuna roll was fairly scrumptious. The star of the show was the Giants roll with the butterfish and tobiko... It was delicious! The service was decent and it helped that we had free pork skewers with our order of Sapporo. Overall the food was three stars, but the service and free skewers boosted it to four stars. It may not be a home run, but the restaurant is definitely a must try at least once. It also helped the fact that it was open later than other sushi restaurants.", "author": "Rosanna N."}

The Beef came with a miso soup and a really large side salad (enough for us to split), that was green and leafy with that amazing ginger dressing (not the white mayonaisey places try to serve you in a miso soup dish).  The sashimi plate came with soup, but the highlight was definitely the fish.  It was soooo fresh and amazing and they even had super white tuna (my favorite).

But we eventually got across safety.\n\nOn the outside, the place looks small, and can hardly see their sign cuz no light, but it was the only place open at that street.  When we walked in, we got to pick our own seats away from the cold door. The decor was very nice, and chairs were comfortable. \n\nI'm not sure about how fresh the fresh sushi was cuz we didn't have any.  I was only craving for some cooked dishes.\n\nWe were debating between the Salmon or the Chicken Teriyaki, but we ended having the Chicken teriyaki ( the sauce wasn't thick and gooey but perfect), Lion king sushi (it was a tad small, but about 9 pieces of them) The salmon was cooked all the through, Vegetarian Evergreen roll (it didn't sound pleasing with eggplant and zucchini in the same dish, but that was the best), and also the Hamachi Kama (perfectly cooked, very juicy).  \n\nWe were filled up. cuz the teriyaki had a bowl of rice (unlimited refills! and a large plate of mixed greens for salad)  \n\nAt the end of our meal,  what thought that was weird, since we normally have mochi ice-cream or ice-cream at the end of our Sushi dinners. The server gave us half an orange sliced up.  So we ended up having the orange than having an ice-cream dessert.

Thank goodness not only do I like Sushi Shou, it's even better than I expected! \n\nWe ordered a good amount of food. I just tried some of their basic sushi, which was great. Their special rolls that other customers got looked really good. The miso shuru was tasty. I rarely like the salad from Japanese restaurants, but this one was delicious and I ate the whole thing. It wasn't drowning in the dressing. The tomatoes were ripe and tasty. The dressing was light and gingery. Yum. \n\nI have to say that the beef teriyaki was my favorite of the night. It was nicely grilled. Although there was teriyaki sauce all over the plate, you could actually taste the beef and it was good. \n\nThe tonkatsu (had to try a bite... or two...) was just as good. It was nice and crispy and didn't seem greasy at all. The entrees come with salad, miso soup, and sauteed veggies, and of course rice. The veggies were a little buttery for my taste, but not really all that buttery - it was pretty light. (I just don't like butter w/ my veggies at all.) They were well cooked (al dente... not overcooked at all). \n\nWe also had edamame and agedashi tofu. Both were very good. To top it off, we had fried bananas with coconut ice cream. YUM. There was a light honey coating over the bananas. A nice sliced strawberry with the ice cream. YUM. YUM. YUM. \n\nAND not only was the food good, the service was great.

For the cost, you are getting quality, great taste, freshness and a portion that two people could easily split. Tempura was also great and it is always delivered hot! Which is impressive. No soggy tempura for us!\n\nDefinitely worth a try. I haven't been to the actual restaurant but if you're too lazy to leave the house and have a hankering for japanese food - go for Sushi Shoh!", "author": "Liz S."}

I've been tracking Sushi Shou's reviews and generally positive responses and close proximity to Chez Moi make a trial at is place a must. \nSo rule one of a sushi bar is just that. Sushi is to be eaten at the bar allowing for interaction with the sushi chef and observation of the product for easy scrutiny. There are 5 slightly uncomfortable high seats at the bar, all vacant when we arrived so we saddled up. One chair was backless Nd mismatched, which would normally be a negative, but it also spun around, allowing for great mid course fun by the Z-man. \n\nSo we tried to say hello to the sushi chef and his assistant. Well unfortunately Mr. Grumpalicious wanted nothing of conversation or ordering from him directly. (immediate minus one star). His Asst. Was nice nice enough, but powerless under his fearless leader to bring any sushi joy our way. \n\nThe gals waiting tables took our order, brought us Asahi on draft in mismatched but chilled glasses and generally were very nice and provided very good service. \n\nWe had gomae, agidashitofu, a couple of rolls and gyoza for the z-man, albacore, spicy tuna roll.  I know all pretty pedestrian stuff, but that was really what this place offers. They comped us a couple of pork belly yakitori skewers since it \"came with the beer special\". which were fine if slightly under seasoned. \n\nEverything was ..... Fine.  Ok leaning toward Meh\n\nWould I come back.   I would be pretty hard pressed. \n\nIf it wasn't for the close locale and the friendly service, probably would have given fewer stars.", "author": "Aaron N."}

Not the same diet, unfortunately, but different diets with unique twists and turns that obliterate common sense.  I especially hate it when my girlfriends are on a diet and I'm on a fat.  Yes.  A fat.  Sometimes, I just eat too healthy and work out too efficiently.  Rippling abs and sculpted toosh are just part and parcel of this fine specimen.  Hench, I like to indulge in a little fried tempura every now and again.  \n\nAlright, I tend to like a little tempura with sashimi.  It's because these are two things that I generally cannot do at home.  I do not posses the skill necessary to slice sashimi.  Instead, my knife work rivals that of Jack the Ripper.  Or a bald eagle.  And I do not posses a fry-a-lator (and please stop offering to buy me one for your birthday).  \n\nOn a sunday night that was neither too cold nor warm, I met up with Val at this place.  And since one of us was on a diet, the other one felt bad about ordering tempura.  Instead I got the seafood sunomono salad and the chirashi dinner entree.  Val got the rainbow roll, miso soup and edamame.  \n\nSeafood sunomono - tart, delicious, correct cucumber usage.  This salad should be made with persian cucumbers or english cucumbers, not the fat, bloated american things that have tough, waxy peels and warts.  The seafood presented was plentiful, wide in variety and tender in texture.  It was $5.\n\nChirashi dinner - came with soup.  It had lots of fish.  I've started this stupid habit of eating before I go out for food.  I will eat an orange, a pear, a bell pepper.  And a liter of water.  Which means that when I arrived for dinner, I was not exactly hungry anymore.  The chirashi was no YuZen.  But the serving was large.  The fish was wide in variety.  There was a lot of tamago.  And the fish was sliced rather thick.  Sashimi style.  I brought it home for dinner the next day.  It was $14.  \n\nThe place did a lot more business in delivery, with many black-clad men scurrying in and out with plastic bags.  They had a plentiful yakitori menu but I was too unhungry to try it.", "author": "Christina C."}

It was fairly empty when we got there, which was a little alarming, but it's probably because it just opened, it was a Sunday night, and in grand San Francisco tradition, it was DAMN cold.\n\nAfter perusing through the large selection of tapas, sushi, entrees and rolls, we decided on the hama hama roll (baked hamachi with gobo and spicy mayo), a spicy tuna roll, and the lobster flower.  \n\nWe were quite pleased with our selections.  They were each fresh,  flavorful, and pleasing to the palate.  The hama hama was perfectly crunchy and spicy, and the lobster flower had a nice balance of tuna and lobster such that neither flavor was overpowering.  I love a good spicy tuna, and Sushi Shoh did not disappoint. We were also pleasantly surprised by the free miso soup and edimame that we received before our meal - I didn't realize sushi restaurants still did this.\n\nWe ordered the fried banana and ice cream for dessert and loved it!  A word of caution: they use wasabi to stick the ice cream dish to the plate, so don't pull a Julie and curiously try some on a spoon.  That was not the best way to start dessert.  \n\nTakeaway: DO go expecting decent sushi at decent prices with great service.  Don't go expecting a wonderful ambiance and fine decor.  Sushi Shoh is a pretty standard sushi restaurant in that regard, so probably not the best first date spot.", "author": "Julie S."}

I was impressed with her willingness to take responsibility on behalf of the restaurant and to look into my concerns.  This prompts me to raise the rating from two to three stars.\n\nAlso, when looking at my review below, please note my concern over the service was actually with the team behind the sushi counter and not really the food server.  I have grown accustomed that the people behind the counter often set the tone for the restaurant with warm greetings and so forth.  To be fair, I now understand from the response letter that they had an unusually high volume of delivery orders.  (I can understand that as the food is truly very good.)\n\nBased on the response, I will be sure to come back!\n\nWhen Sushi Shoh was about to open, I would peek into the restaurant  through the plate glass windows with great anticipation.  As they were ramping up for the opening I sensed they were taking care to create a pleasing, even zen environment.  They put in very nice lighting fixtures and a pretty window with bamboo etchings on the glass.  \n\nI will start with the positives, and it really is a positive- the food quality.\nWe had sashimi for two and yakitori for two, and both were very good.  The quality of the fish was very good, and the yakitori was nicely prepared, except for the beef which was slightly overcooked.\n\nNow for the disaapointments:\n\nThe placement of an unnecessary flat screen tv with sports playing dampens the potential to make it a pleasant dining spot.  There is something about the flickering lights from television that cheapens the atmosphere of a restaurant- especially a small one.  It almost felt like its placement was for the entertainment of the people working there.\n\nAnother thing they did was they took the lovely glass they put up for the restaurant and cheapened it with scotch taping menus and other announcements which makes it feel like a low end restaurant though the prices are moderately high.\n\nThe other challenge is it seems like no thought was placed on service warmth or style.  There was an almost sluggish disinterest in whether we were enjoying our experience.  I have grown accustomed to the warm greeting and send off that often comes with dining in a nice Japanese restaurant.  Here, eventhough only two other tables were occupied we left without even being noticed or thanked.  \n\nBottom line- I like the food but would consider travelling farther from home to avoid the lack of warmth and a blah atmosphere. \n\nI think this restaurant has very good potential if they work on these items.", "author": "Emanuel B."}

With the exception of Chouchou and Kathy's, which has a lot of regulars, it has always been tough for the third restaurant in this five store shopping center. There was a Mexican restaurant that seemed promising but I did not have a chance to try it before Sushi Shoh took its place. \n\nOne exciting thing about Sushi Shoh is that they offer yakitori, which is lacking in the bay area, even if you count the San Jose region. So I ordered the Yakitori Moriwase (combo) and my husband ordered the Chirashi dinner. The yakitori was six skewers chef's choice and they gave us: Butaniku Yaki, Gyu Hire Yaki, shishito, shitake, Namajake Sumiyaki, and Tebasaki. They were all good but not great in comparison to a specialized yakitori restaurant. It was mentioned on the menu that they use real Japanese charcoal, which is great, because it imparts a different flavor than regular American charcoal. \n\nWe knew right away when we walked in that this was a Chinese owned and operated Japanese restaurant and that was fine by us. We eat a lot of great Japanese food, from Japanese restaurants that are owned and operated by Japanese, to others that are Japanese owned but have a lot of Chinese cooks/staff, and this would fall into the third category, Japanese restaurants owned and operated by Chinese folk. It may seem petty if you do not eat Japanese food often but there are nuances. And of course, you really have to try it before you judge. Not all Japanese owned restaurants are great and Chinese owned places medicore. One thing you will find is that Japanese places tend to have a higher grade of fish, better knife execution, better tea and being Japanese, also smaller portions and higher prices. Sushi Shoh, like other good Chinese sushi joints we have been too, had good sushi quality and nice fat pieces. Everything was creamy, fresh, and cut well enough that you did not bite into ligaments that can make the fish chewy. Someone did mention they had a lot of \"fakesushi\" on the menu and that pretty much means rolls. Rolls are generally more emphasized at Chinese owned places than Japanese ones. We also ordered a salmon skin roll which was decent as well. \n\nSo the next time we feel like some good, decently affordable sushi near our house we will come here. If we want sashimi focused places there are other Japanese joints available in the city. Someone also wrote that the decor was sparse but I found it to be pretty nice for a casual spot.", "author": "Empress C."}

I've never dined in as I'm always with my kid and he refuses to eat any type of asian food. So, I've tried more than half their menu and nearly everything has been really good. \nThe highlights, their specialty rolls are all very good, right now I'm a fan of the firebomb. Their udon nebeyaki is super delish, I love the poached egg and huge pieces of chicken. I didn't like their chicken terriaki too much, but I love love love their steak terriaki. It's not a bunch of tiny shaved beef strips I've had other places. It's a full on thin cut of rib eye. The only way it could be better is if they shaved the extra fat off for you, but it is always tender and perfectly cooked. Their tempura is pretty crispy for delivery and there is always a great variety of veggies.\nSo if you are looking for a good sushi delivery place, this place is the bomb. The only reason why it's not five stars is because their fish could be a little fresher.", "author": "Lisa B."}

The decor was very modern and clean. Food was great too. Had the tofu specialty which was soft inside and light crunch outside- sauce was yummy. tempera udon was really tasty and lots of different type of tempura. My son loved it. Hubby got the steak teriyaki- it was a huge portion and again very tasty. Order few different type of raw fishes and they were very fresh. Service was great and they were very accommodating to our 3 year old. And they deliver!!!! We need some more delivery restaurants in Seattle. Oh- did I mention that this place was far better than places we went in japantown where we were staying?", "author": "Shy z."}

This is the cutest little restaurant and the service is great!! The people are really nice, and they're always giving out free samples when you eat in!! What I like about this place is that they have these sushi rolls that sound like strange combinations, but they taste amazing!! My favorites are the crystal water roll, and the lobster flower roll. they both have really unique tastes. Last night, I got the steak teriyaki to go and it was delicious!!! Oh and they have delivery!! How cool is that?! I've never heard of a sushi place that delivers!!!", "author": "S M."}

Ate there when they first opened and the service was great.  The sushi was fresh and had a somewhat good variety.  Will head back to give it another try.", "author": "Mary L."}

I loved the Evergreen roll and my husband enjoyed the chicken meatballs and several other tapas dishes.The waitstaff is very nice, although a bit slow at time. The restaurant is tiny but very comfortable and charming. I am looking forward to coming back and trying some more things.", "author": "Keromi K."}
