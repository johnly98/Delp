Very different from most Indian restaurants you'll see any almost any city.\n\nThe main part, The Food - Dosa has arguably the best masala dosa in SF. Between this and the chana Bhatura I would eat here every day for the rest of my life. The veg sliders are also delicious, as are the lamb sliders (I am a carnivore, but vegetarians do well here) \n\nThe service - I've had varied levels of service in my many visits, both with sitting at the bar to eat, and in their dining room. There was a issue with our dinner  one evening when our server was not seen for almost the entire meal, and our side plates not changed between courses (3 of us dining) in fairness although the server was inattentive when we spoke to the manager she did her best to sort it out. The service I've received has never been outstanding, which is why I'm only giving this place 4 stars, and why I probably wouldn't take out of town guests here.", "author": "Marie D."}

Having eaten dosas forever while growing up, it is kind of annoying to see each dosa plate cost nearly $20 and there is really nothing special about them. Having said that, the ambiance is great and the food tastes decent. \n\nWe ordered and split three dosas: the rava dosa, the egg dosa, and the spicy aloo dosa. The texture of the dosas is pretty great but the taste varies. My favorite is the rava dosa because of the crispiness and they make it very crispy here. The egg dosa kind of felt like a normal dosa with just a small piece of egg in it - you really couldn't taste it that much when combined with the rest of the dosa. The spicy aloo dosa was also really good although I felt there was a bit too much aloo in the dosa and that it didn't mix well. It is spicy but it is manageable. The dipping sauces are great too - the coconut chutney is good and the sambaar is very tasty as well. They also give very crispy and tasty papads at the beginning of the meal. \n\nOverall, however, I think the place is overpriced for what the food is (the cost is mainly for the ambiance). The presentation is very standard and the taste of the food is nothing great. Good to go for a first time, especially if you haven't tried dosas before, but probably won't be coming back in the future.", "author": "Sampath D."}

It comes with a bread layered on top that isn't usual in India and caught us by surprise, but our waiter said it's too keep the Byriani warm. And the bread is delicious!

When you're hungry and just want something flavorful and filling, dosas are usually a go-to. So, when we walked in to Dosa on Fillmore, we had very high expectations.\n\nWalking in through the large heavy door, you're instantly greeted by the heavenly aromas of South Indian cuisine in an open room, lit by elegant chandeliers. We came in at around 8:15pm on a Saturday evening without a reservation and opted to sit at the communal table to avoid the wait. Luckily, we got a spot at the end, so it wasn't too cramped for the four of us. Our server was friendly and attentive, despite being quite busy, and patiently answered all of our questions.\n\nMy family and I ordered the Idli Sambar, Chile Garlic Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa, and Spicy Mung Masala Dosa. The complimentary papadum was thin and crispy, although a couple of the pieces were slightly stale. The idli sambar was fantastic - the idlis were perfectly soft and not too grainy as some restaurants tend to make them, and the sambar was so flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. All of our dosas were pretty great - good texture, just the right amount of soft and crispy, and strong spices spread across the Chile Garlic and the Spicy Mung dosas. The only thing lacking was a little more flavor in the potato filling in each dosa - it could have used a tad more salt and masala. Otherwise, the dosas were filling and made for a great meal.\n\nWe left around 9, and the place seemed to still be bustling. I wish we'd tried the desserts - they sounded decadent - but we were already so full from the dosas. Next time I would probably try more of the shared plates for greater variety. The prices are on the higher end, but food, service, and ambience all make it worth it.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

But some Indian friends recommended this place and I'm always up for trying something new. We had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. Though we sat around for about 15 minutes after we arrived, while they were \"setting up our table.\" We got a bunch of appetizers - samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. The idli fries are bomb. They were like right out of the fryer hot. Not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. And it comes with a unique dipping sauce. The chutney sampler came with 4 chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive (and complementary) papad (kinda like Indian chips). I could've just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you can't have just one. Samosas were ok - nothing out of the ordinary.  Then the rest of us got some kind of dosa. I actually tried the uttapam sampler. Uttapam is like a thicker dosa. I couldn't tell you all the different types of the uttapam but I enjoyed all five of them. All were vegetarian though and some had cheese that I remember. I also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa. The dosa itself is huge and crepe-like and I like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. I think I also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. I think I liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. Everything I had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. I will definitely need to search out more southern Indian cuisines.", "author": "Alison W."}

However, for the taste, I didn't see the reason for the food to be as pricey as it is. \n\n3. The food is pretty good, but I'm not convinced it's worth the price. Going off #2, yes the food is good but it's not amazing and mind blowing that I would like to spend $90 on a meal for two people. \n\n4. I was told this place has a lot of good options for vegetarians and South Indian food. I am not a vegetarian or South Indian but my friend who came along is and said it had good options.\n\n5.

We were served two dishes and we finished those more than half way when we asked about the 3rd dish... There was a large party near us so I will give them the benefit of the doubt this time.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to someone who loves Indian food or is looking for a upscale place to take their family or dates.

It was tapioca, so that was interesting but I think it worked and I enjoyed it so much that I ate some of my boyfriend's portion too.\n\nDRINK: You really can't go wrong with the drinks here, whether you want something non-alcoholic or cocktails. We ordered the mint lemonade, which was a tad bit too sweet but had a wonderful intense, herbal mint flavor. I also had the masala chai, which is one of my favorite ways to drink tea, and it didn't disappoint. As for cocktails, I had the gin and house tonic, which was EXCELLENT! If you've ever had Fentimans Curiosity Cola, it tastes like that, but not sweet. Their tonic has cardamom and some other things in it that make it a really unique taste. Such a classic cocktail but with some unique twists that turn it into something completely different. My boyfriend had the Bengali Gimlet and I think also the Water of Life, both of which he really enjoyed. We didn't get a chance to try as many of the cocktails as we wanted, so we'll definitely go back to focus on the cocktail menu!\n\nOverall, DOSA is for those times where you want something unique, you're feelin' fancy, and you're willing to splurge and pay a lot extra for a great experience. DOSA is definitely more those who enjoy food and love to be out of their comfort zone and try new things.", "author": "Claire C."}

As the restaurant switched into dinner service I have witnessed him get delegated to a completely ignored bar-back, while the two white counter parts who arrived on shift took over managing the bar. And are doing a pretty bad job of it might I add. \n\nAs the trainer (male) tries to instill DOSA wisdom on his new crush (female) he fails to correct her for the terrible way in which she chooses to approach the customers seated. \"What is _____ like?\" People ask about dishes and drinks. \"It's good.\" She says point blank, daring you to inquire further, and without a hint of enthusiasm or warmth. I watch her slam down menus and water glasses in front of people without a hello or a smile. \n\nA weird energy settles over the bar. \n\nHey DOSA! That guy I spoke about earlier?

We were all a little on the full side before they even took us to our tables.  \n\nWhen seated we all ordered our main dish.  I got the Trio Dosa which was amazing!

I've been here a few times and the food has always been top notch, BUT this last visit was on an entirely different level. \n\nWhen we got to the establishment we were ambushed by an eclectic, yet nomadic interior. The high ceilings invited calm, spaciousness and patience, while the art-work was reminiscent of rustic India. Timeless pictures of women carrying rice, street food vendors cooking and the bold, dark and intense faces of India let you know that you aren't just eating South Indian food, but also etching a piece of the culture in your heart. The restaurant has a lifesize statue of Shiva, one of the countless gods in the Hindu culture. The bar area is brightly lit with neutral colors and carries a myriad of drink concoctions.   \n\nWe made a reservation on their site and were seated promptly upstairs. Our hostess had told us that the Chef recently visited Kerela, India and had such a great experience, that he created a special pre-fix menu which paid homage to his travels. \n\nIt was 60/person and worth every penny. We got a little taste of what was about 8-10 dishes. It was one of those meals where you could swear that the dish you're eating can't get any better, and then it does with each new dish. It was sensory overload of the best kind. All in all, you can't go wrong with any dish, but if you want to have a nibble of many things on their seasonal menu, I would strongly recommend the pre-fix. \n\nSome of the notable dishes we ate: \n\nLake Kochi Grilled Prawns (amazing!) \nAvocado Chaat (refreshing)\nSmoked Arctic Char ( Delicious Fish dish)\nMasala Dosa (Resturants namesake and a classic)\nCoconut Kheer (made with tapioca)\n\nIf you've never had Indian food this is an excellent place to break your cherry and if you're familiar with Indian food, it's a great opportunity to see how a Chef is taking something familiar, de-constructing it and still managing to evoke nostalgia.", "author": "Anand S."}

Though the restaurant wasn't full, we waited for A LONG TIME before the staff came to take our order.\n\nFor the dosa, we ordered the classic Masala dosa (4/5). There were three complementary sauces and they were all pretty decent. They were more on the sour side. The dosa came really fast and the crepe itself was thin and crisp. Pretty good.\n\nWe also ordered mixed mushroom Uttapam. This dish was really meh. It felt like a simple pizza on an Indian dough. Uttapam was kinda sour and there was quite a lot of cheese on the dish. The complementary sauces were the same as the dosa's. The dish was fairly bland and also soggy. We could not manage to finish this.\n\nOur last dish was the goat dum biryani. This was probably our favorite dish out of the three we ordered. The goat biryani was sitting inside a naan-bread like bowl and there was a yogurt-like complementary sauce. The biryani was well flavored and decently spicy.

We've since moved closer to the Fillmore location and I wanted to share my most recent experience here. \n\nLast Friday (09/28), I stopped in for an early 5:30 PM dinner with my husband and infant son. We came with our compact stroller and our well behaved 9 month old son. The hostess was lukewarm in greeting us and told us that she'd have to see if she could find us a table since we didn't have a reservation. My husband asked if we could sit at one of the round tables by the door as they were empty and we could leave my son in his stroller. The restaurant space is huge and I'd estimate that about 85% of it was vacant at the time. We had no problem waiting but a few minutes after we came in another couple arrived asking for a table. With my back turned away from the hostess, I overheard the couple tell her they did not have a reservation and she replied \"it shouldn't be a problem seating you.\" I noted the markedly different responses but we continued to look forward to our meal. \n\nAbout 15 minutes after we arrived, my husband went to the nearby Walgreens to pickup a pacifier in the event that my son became fussy during our meal. During this time, I had removed my son from the stroller and was managing him along with all of our belongings alone.  The hostess told me that she had a table ready for us. She then told me it was upstairs and asked if it was okay. Her tone suggested that she was hoping we would give up and leave rather than sit upstairs. It wasn't a problem but we were confused why she was placing us up there given the gear that we had with us and the numerous empty tables on the ground floor.\n\nI held my infant son, his water cup, blanket, pacifier, stuffed animal, jacket, and diaper bag in one hand while his collapsed stroller was in the other. I followed the hostess towards the staircase but she stopped to address the couple that initially came in (without a reservation) after us. I overheard her tell them that their table was ready and that she would take them to it right away. They continued to talk as I stood by the staircase with two hands full. When she came back to the staircase she walked up with the menus in hand (she was safely holding the handrail) while I followed, again, two hands full. There was no offer to assist me or place our items in an alternative location.\n\nOnce we were seated and my husband returned, he looked down and saw the couple that arrived only moments after we did (again, without a reservation) seated at one of the round tables on the ground floor that we had initially requested.\n\nIt was clear to us that we were viewed as a nuisance. As a regular Dosa customer, I am incredibly disappointed in this experience and want to alert Anjan, Emily, and the general manager of this issue.", "author": "Whitney A."}

Its definitely on the spicy side, as they pour red chilli powder on it. So make sure you can handle spice before you order this.\n- Vada Paav: still as good as how I remember from 2012.

I would personally prefer just the regular chana (Indian style).\n- Ras Malai: Delicious dessert.\n- Madras Coffee: Usually the madras coffee I have had is served in a steel glass, but this one comes in a regular cup.

We'd first come last march to celebrate my birthday with friends and while we all enjoyed everything we ordered our server was inattentive and did a couple uh things that spoiled the night. However, I reached out to management with our details, and in response, Andy was incredibly kind and respectful and invited us back to try again on the house. Finally got back and we are so glad we did! It was an incredible meal/evening with service exactly on point. We really recommend DOSA for folks who want unique, fresh modern Indian food. AND very creative cocktails. \n\nDOSA you must get a dosa at DOSA. They are wonderful. We started with the paneer and peas version because we're paneer peeps. It is great the texture, w fresh peas, the dips, and the lil bowl of lentil broth vegetable stew, it's a very nice combination dish. Loved it. Must have more.\n\nVery cool modern creative cocktails I got the peony a lavender colored not flavored soft silky gin concoction. Well 3, I had 3.\n\nWe ordered the Arctic Char with peach curry and WOW it was so well cooked and such a delicious dish my mouth is watering thinking about it now two days later. We also ordered the Channa Bahtura which was outrageously delectable. It might seem like just a bean dish with a bread balloon (see my pics) but it's not. So delicately spiced, cooked tender garnish that really adds to it. Just yum! I'd recommend they put some ginger in it though to prevent bean gas. And that tender crisp ballon complimented it well. I'll order it again. \n\nSo Andy had moved on, but still handled our situation deftly, texting the new manager, who texted that nights manager. All done seamlessly. So Christine was expecting us and we didn't even know all that had happened. She greeted us kindly and even shared a couple dishes we didn't order, just I guess to assure we had a grand experience. We did, we so did! One was a nice fresh avocado grapefruit salad fresh and lovely. The other was two deserts. She even knew it was a birthday redux and the layered pistachio thing came with a candle. A sweet touch. We also enjoyed the nice rice pudding patties very unusual! \n\nThis is a night that really was worthy of a birthday celebration and we can't wait to get back and try a different dosa.

The servers were all super high touched, constantly making sure that my friends and I were being taken care of. The mood of the lower area was loud and rambunctious whereas the upper level was quiet and intimate. \n\nPRICING\nCome prepared with a projected budget cuz you will be spending a good amount of money.

Try the purple cocktail if you like sweet, the ginger beer cocktail if you like spicy or the anchor beer if you like dark beer. \n\nFOOD\nHands down the best Indian food I've ever had- though to be completely transparent, I haven't had very much in my life (that will be changing). My favorite was by far the lamb slider, a savory grilled lamb burger with a fiery bite and sweet undertones.

But boy, were we in for a rude shock!\n\nLanding at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels.  Little did I realise that it was the only big thing that we were gonna be experiencing in the restaurant that night (besides the final cheque of course which was already expected)\n\nWe immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us (Yelp??). They tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated 5 kids maybe! After a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not gonna sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us.\n\nThe real horror started then with our server for the day, Brittany C. Now when a restaurant decides to charge you a 20% service markup automatically just because you are group of 5 or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! But Brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free!\n\nAfter a very offending introduction to a \"$60 set menu or the preferable ala carte menu\", we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit. We ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile uttapam and goat biryani along with a rasam \n\nThe complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly. We had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up. Now the dosa and uttapam were served with a moderate sized bowl of Sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys. Anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of Sambhar and a teas0oonful of chutney??\n\nThe food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of \"it will cost you $2\". When we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! We asked the new server if this is what we get in $2, he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened!\n\nNow in this entire episode the food isn't anything great to write about. It isn't bad but it is definitely not worth a 4* for someone who knows how south indian tastes like. The goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!!\n\nComing back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food. At the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but Brittany just brought out the cheque and didn't even care to ask why the biryani was left over. For the biryani we asked for a take away box (thought we could give it to someone needy) but Brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile\n\nAfter all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a 20% charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern. The manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts. We told her very clearly we didn't want free stuff but also didn't want to pay for a service we didn't get and just wanted the charge removed. But she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed. And then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, don't know if that was really required to be done!\n\nIn comes Brittany with the dessert (oh the horror!!). She placed one dessert in front of us rudely (she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way) and made a statement \"you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon\" and just walked away. And then she comes back with another one and leaves with a statement \"hope the free desserts make up for your concerns\". Hello?? Why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff?? Oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her. Well dear Brittany, after the experience I would not even had Water if \"it was on you\"\n\nComing from India, I always thought America offers a different standard of service to customers. But dear DOSA management, believe me I realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product. Please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place!\n\nTo Mr Anjan - Thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident! We are not looking for your free stuff so please keep the offer to yourself. Would have been happier to see your revert say we would offer impeccable and warm service!", "author": "Abhishek C."}

This location is A LOT bigger and definitely a nicer ambiance (dim lighting, beautiful chandeliers). It gets busy during dinner time but does not get loud. This is a great place for a date or a place to meet with friends. The menu is extensive, separated into shared plates and dosas and uttapams. We asked what was the appropriate amount to order and the waitress wasn't too helpful (note: ordering 2 shareable plates, a dosa and a side of bread may be too much for two people as we found out). \n\nWe started with the samosas and bhatura bread and drinks. We were also given papadum to start (crispy lentil bread). I LOVED this stuff. I got the Morjim Goa. It came with a bit of sweet foam (garam masala air apparently). I liked this a lot! The bhatura was a big fluffy pillow (so big!) and the samosas were perfectly fried. We were then given lamb sav which were lamb sliders. These were my favorite--they were spicy and sweet! The lamb was done really well and had a lot of good flavor--garlicky and moist.\n\nWe then got a dosa with the spicy mung masala. This comes with a lentil soup (sambar) and two chutneys. Because we had gotten the samosa, having more potato at this point wasn't as appealing because the filling was essentially the same. I enjoyed it but think we could have made do without the samosas.

Usually Indian food is already a hit or miss for me when it comes to the post-meal feels since the food is generally heavily spiced/buttered/creamed and my body can't handle the contrast to my normal diet, but I thought that a $$$ Indian restaurant wouldn't do me like that since one would assume that paying a premium for Indian food, WHICH EPITOMIZES CHEAP EATS, would be worth it. Going to Dosa should be like going to a fancy Mexican restaurant instead of Taco Bell because you're not ready to commit to a morning after spent in the loo (ok a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point). Not gonna lie, I love Indian food and I usually think it's worth the pain when I spend $13.99 for an all you can eat Indian buffet with unlimited garlic naan, tandoori chicken, and chicken masala BUT COME ON NOW $30 for a tiny bowl of curry? WHAT?! In no world is that worth my pain... let's not mention that the curry wasn't even that good. \n\nOkay, bodily discomforts aside, two other things that warranted this crap review include 1) the mediocre food as mentioned above, and 2) the what the heck service. I was with a group of 9 girls and one girl ordered the following for the group: Dungeness Crab Poori, two orders of Bhatura, Smoked Arctic Char & Blood Orange Curry, Almond Ambur Chicken Curry, a veggie curry, South Indian Moons (Uttapam), and the Basil & Garlic Dosa. Everything except for the Smoked Arctic Char was so mediocre, and I honestly wouldn't even go back to eat the arctic char again, therefore it wasn't amazing. Apart from that, apparently the food we ordered wasn't enough for all of us because the curries were tiny -- either that or we didn't know how to portion out each of the curries for all 9 of us because by the time 5 girls scooped their portion of each curry, we were out. Not sure where to put the blame here, but I feel like this is something the waiters should have at least warned us about when they took our order... Didn't help that the food came out so slowly and every time a dish came out, the waiters kept on putting them at the same end of the table so the second half never got anything (we had to then reorder the 3 curries for the second half which then delayed our dinner). Also, what I found so amusing was that shortly after they brought out the second order of curries for our half of the table, they came back asking if they could clear our plates even though we were clearly still working on everything / THE DISHES WEREN'T EVEN HALF EMPTY YET. \n\nI am officially fuming as I am typing this review. I'm so confused why this place has 4 stars. I'm tempted to change my review to 1 star but I'll end this before I do since that would just make me feel like I 100% wasted my money (which I mean... it still was a waste so don't go here if you don't want to waste money... but I'm just trying to make myself feel better about the $70 I spent on this meal instead of a decent pair of jeans at this point).

Disclaimer: This is my favorite restaurant in the city and I am regular here!\n\nMade a reservation to go here for dinner tonight for July 4th and the service was horrible!\nThe restaurant was busy which is understood but there was clear chaos in the service. \n\nIt took the waiter a good 10 minutes to come by the table to take the order. \n\nAfter we finally ordered here is sequence of events:\n\nDrinks: ordered a glass of wine, a beer, kingfisher and a kids mango lassi. The first drinks to arrive was mango lassi; came in a kids cup but no straw and the wine. Asked the server about the missing beer and he said he will check and he walked away casually without acknowledging the missing straw on the cup?! Hello!! How do you expect the kid to drink that?? \n\nWill come back to the beer in a bit...\n\nAsked another server passing by for a straw and he delivered one..\n\nOrdered Vada pav for appetizer & prawn masala, paratha and paper masala dosa for entree.\n\nThe first food item to be delivered was the prawn masala (which comes with rice) minus the paratha. No sign of appetizer either or the beer. \n\nStory of the beer: After 10 more minutes of waiting the waiter stopped by and my husband asked for the beer and his response?! We ran out of kingfisher yesterday. I am sorry I just found out, can I get you a pilsner instead? My husband, ahhh ok, please do! And the beer came after another 10 minutes of ordering that!!! Phew!\n\nAnd then came the paratha!  And another 5 mins after that came the appetizer, vada pav.\n\nMy little one then asks, mommy, WHERE IS THE DOSA? Which took them another 10 minutes or so ..

The wait was about a half an hour- we wish we'd just gotten a reservation via Yelp instead. \n\nThe food was fine- definitely not the best dosas I've had. We got the idli fries and vada pav to start with. Both were v.good, the fries nice and crunchy and loaded with a tasty spice rub, the vada pav a delicious mixture of sweet and sour (pro-tip from a Mumbaikar- where the vada pav was invented: make the vada less soggy by holding back on the imli chutney! Also would've been nice if it was a tad spicy). All in all, the appetizers were a success. For mains we got the paper masala dosa and have to say, was a little disappointed, esp for a place that's named after this lovely South Indian dish. \n\nThe portions are on the small side by Indian food standards, but I guess that's what you expect from an upscale place?\n\nOh, and our server was *super* nice. \n\nWould definitely go back again to try other items on the menu.", "author": "Surashree K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "I made a reservation for 5 people on May 13, 2018, at 7:30 p.m. to celebrate Mother's Day with our family visiting from out of town. The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant was semi-full.  \nWe arrived at 7:15 p.m. and checked in with the hostess.  The hostess told us that she will get our table ready so we waited to the side of the podium.  During the wait, we over heard the conversation between the hostess and the gentleman up in the balcony that somehow he did not see a party of 5 on his list.  About 10 minutes later, the hostess took us up on the second floor to our table.  The table is located at a corner by the wall next to the window.  I saw the table and realized that the table has a bench and two chairs.  I reminded the hostess that we have a party of 5.  She responded \"we have seated 6 people like this before.\"  To my astonishment of her response, I waited, somehow, she realized herself that she couldn't seat 5 people.  There were two nice ladies sat next to our table said \"that table won't fit 5, how would she said it had fitted 6?\"  These ladies were almost done with their dinner and were willing to move to the spot that is empty.  I thanked them and the hostess came back and helped put the table together.  \nWe checked out the menus.  The in-laws are visiting from India and it is their first time.  It wasn't my first.  I had been at this location once before.  I have been coming to the DOSA on Valencia more often.  The waitress by the name of Brittany C. came and asked if it was our first time.  We unilaterally said \"Yes.\"  She explained the menus and said with a very condescending tone \"this is a pre-fix menu and it costs $60 or you can order a-la-carte.\"  She then left without saying another word.  We took about 5 minutes and said we were ready to order.  We waited and finally waved her down to get the order.   She asked if we wanted cocktails, we said no, water is fine. \nThe food amazingly came out pretty fast.  We ordered 4 dishes and a soup (3 dosas, 1 birayani and a bowl of Rasam).  Each of the Dosa's dish came with two chutneys (coconut and tomato chutneys).  We really liked the coconut chutney and asked if we could get some extra. Brittany, the waitress, said \"it is $2.00 extra.\"  We found it a little bit odd with her tone, but we said that is fine.  She didn't bring it out, but it was another gentleman.  The size of the extra (for $2.00) was a bit ridiculous.  It was about 1 to 2 tablespoons max.  We asked the gentleman if that was for the extra $2.00 he said he is going to check.  He never came back and no one came to the table for the entire meal.  Our water was never refilled. We decided for the principle, we didn't touch it and left the chutney to the side. \nWe finished all the dosa dishes and not the Biryani.  My hubby and I were the only two can eat meat and we didn't like it so much.  We had the dough/cover on top instead.  We asked to take away the leftovers of the Biryani and Brittany brought out a box and left it at the table without saying a word and left.  She came back with a bill.  There was not even once of the entire meal that someone came by to ask if we were okay or need anything else or re-fill our water. As normal circumstance, I would gladly pay for the 20% auto-added tips for party of 5.  However, I (we) feel that for the service we got for this entire meal, we wouldn't want to pay for that 20%.  We called the manager and discussed and explained the situation. The manager offered free-desserts.  We politely mentioned to her that we weren't looking for free-items, we were absolutely happy to just pay for our meals without the 20% tip auto-added because we don't believe the service was rendered to deserve the amount.  She said no-problem she'll fix the bill.  However, when she took the bill back, she crumbled the bill in her hand right in-front of us and we found that to be very rude.  However, at this moment, we weren't expecting anything better.  They brought out the desserts, and here come Ms. Brittany C.  She dropped (literally dropped - not placed) a bowl of sherbet on the table and walked away without saying a word.  At this time, my hubby's mum couldn't hold her disappointment and said \"that is the rudest gesture I have ever seen.\"  \nMs. Brittany C. brought back a bill without the 20% tip added and took off the Biryani.  When she handed over the bill she said \"I heard you talked to my manager and she is getting you free desserts. I hope that makes up for whatever problem you've had tonight.\" She continued to \"Would you like some tea/chai, it is on me.\" We were once again couldn't believe the statements and just shook our heads and said \"Thank You.\"  There were not once Brittany smiled when talked to us.  We paid our bill and I wrote on the signed receipt that \"I have been there or at least to the DOSA establishment in many occasions, this is the worst experience in service I have ever had.\" I would not return or recommend DOSA to anyone!", "author": "Michele H."}

I had been meaning to go to this place and finally went on a work dinner. \n\nTo summarize, I was pleasantly surprised! I expected to get not impressive South Indian food at higher prices, since I haven't really been impressed by the other places I've tried in the San Jose/Fremont area and in Los Angeles. We ordered the chutney sampler, samosas, Chennai chicken, Rava Masala dosa, Idli Sambhar, Masala Dosa, Chilli Garlic Dosa, and the Halibut curry. \n\nThe chutney sampler was pretty standard and came with 4 chutneys and some papadum. The samosas actually surprised me. As someone who doesn't particularly like samosas, I really enjoyed these. They were light, the stuffing was delectable, and the crust was flaky. The Chennai chicken was very juicy and well seasoned, although I wish it had more of a kick to it. The idlis were made just how I like it, so that made me super happy. Sadly, they only give 2 idlis for $9.50 - and that made me sad. \nThe dosas were all fantastic!!! But also very buttery. Not too sure if they used butter or ghee, but I would've liked it with way less. The sambhar and chutneys (coconut and tomato) that came with the dosas were also very tasty! Just like how my family makes it and how it tastes at mom-n-pop food places in south India. The Halibut curry was delicious but was also on the saltier side for my taste. \n\nOverall, great experience and great food! Service was also nice and pretty quick. I just wish it was more affordable! But also don't want them to cut down on quality - it's a trade off! \n\nWould I recommend this to my South Indian parents and grandparents?

I was told about 5 minutes later after I ordered my lassi that they didn't have the mango one that sad. Super sad panda! I'm very sensitive to spice so I wanted to have something that would reduce the burn on my tongue from all the Indian food. Then I ordered the chai. The chai was SO STRONG. Even my Indian coworker agreed that it was too strong. So I sent that back and settled down with my mint lemonade. \n\nThe food was very meh. I didn't need to pay Dosa prices for the food quality and taste. I could have paid less than half of the price for better Indian food elsewhere. The service was also very bleh. We could never track down our server even though the place was only 1/4 full. \n\nAND the real cherry on top was that the hostess decided to seat a 7 person party (3 were really young children) RIGHT next to our table. There were other tables that could have accommodated that many people further away from us. The restaurant was only a 1/4 full! So instead of a quiet dinner, I got subjected to kids kicking our legs, bouncing up and down on the shared booth cushions, and parents who couldn't control their children. \n\nI will NOT be back. Nothing made the experience worth coming back for. There are far better Indian restaurants in the city of SF, and I'd recommend that you go to those instead.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

DOSA can be good, it can be not; but it's worth a visit to see for yourself.\n\nI appreciate that it's an upscale(ish) Indian restaurant. There aren't enough of them. Indian fusion is an interesting concept as well. I'm just not crazy about their food and even considering high cost of San Francisco rents, their prices are a bit high particularly because the cost of the ingredients in their food is fairly low.\n\nAlso know they pass the cost of providing health insurance to their staff on to you. This shows up in the form of an additional line item on your check (not in the cost of their food) and it's called \"SF Mandate 6%.\" Then they'll charge you 8.5% tax (which is actually mandated) on everything including the 6% \"SF Mandate.\"", "author": "Tushar N."}

We made reservations for two, which I didn't think was necessary since it was a Thursday stormy night in SF...but they ended up putting us at the bar since we came late for our reservations (well I did, lol). The bar was the perfect setting, and the manager Chris was simply a delight to have serve/entertain us! He explained the menu (which has numerous GF, dairy free, veg, air free JK) options and gave us the best drink suggestions as well. My friend has lived at Dosa with numerous bday dinners so she knew she wanted her favs (Scallops, Sweet potato something, pistachio dessert). \n\nThe food was amazing, the drinks were awesome (and the bar manager Chris was wonderful in giving us a tasting sampling array, explaining the liquors, etc.). The food was wonderful, unique tasting and not overbearing. \n\nGREAT experience at Dosa, so happy to have finally visited! If you're a girl or comfortable with feminine drinks, get the one that's pink and looks like a bubble bath! It makes you feel like you're in the market place at India (surrounded by pink clouds).

The coriander and cumin made this dish complete. \n- Pappadum & Chutney Sampler: I nice little variation of flavors with the crispy lentil wafers to dip. \n\nAll in all, I think my bill was under $30 bucks for all this food and the one cocktail and I split all of this food with a friend as it was plenty!

When I looked a couple days prior, there were plenty of reservations available for Monday night. Originally reserved an 8:30 pm timeslot, but on the day of, we found ourselves free earlier than expected, and luckily I was able to change my reservation to 7:30 pretty last minute.\n\nI wasn't really hungry since I was sick and had little appetite, so my friend got one appetizer and we split a dosa. I didn't try his appetizer so I can't speak to that, but I thought the dosa was just okay. \n\nWe stuck with the masala dosa since that was the classic dosa and we wanted to stick with something basic (though I was very intrigued by the seasonal pumpkin dosa I saw on the menu). The bread part of the dosa was fine, but the potato filling inside was overly salty and I couldn't enjoy it as much. I've had dosas here before and I don't remember them being so salty, so maybe the chef that night had a heavy hand with the salt.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the sorbet flavor of the night which happened to be mango.

Easy online reservations--this is more often a lunch/dinner restaurant, so get in now while brunch is still under-popularized.  Huge restaurant, especially for this Fillmore location.\n\nService is attentive, manager is welcoming, and waiter was knowledgeable and informative.\n\nMango Lassi ($5) - mixed really well, one of the better mango lassi's that the hubby and I have had.  (He ordered this--I opted to wait until after brunch and instead get T4 a block down the street. :) )\n\nBombay Eggs ($15) - extra flavorful, reminds me of a tastier spicier version of Moroccan baked eggs.  Comes with 2 eggs baked atop a thick tomato curry concoction, a ~half-sized garlic/onion uttapam, and a couple sauces (mild green, spicy red).  Great recommendation from our waiter!  Makes my mouth water just thinking of this dish.\n\nWild Mushroom & Truffle Oil Uttapam ($15) - flavorful with tender deliciously prepared mushrooms.  Not your typical button mushrooms--these are beech, maitake, and trumpet--yum!  Impressed at how well they cooked the mushrooms, especially considering truffle oil/mushrooms aren't your typical Indian fare.  An uttapam is a white slightly spongy/chewy pancake.  Comes with 2 sauces (including a sweeter and less spicy red sauce) and a cup of stewed veggie curry soup.\n\nGenerous, extra flavorful dishes.  Great service.  Easy reservations.  And to top it off, boba down the street.  What else could you ask for?", "author": "Vanessa O."}

This place deserves 5 stars for its combination of wonderful food and amazing ambience. I can nearly say that this place has the best ambience amongst the Indian restaurants that I have been to in the US, till now. \n\nFor people of Indian origin, I would recommend this place for taking non-Indian friends out to and especially if you have to take your parents or relatives out for a meal. This will definitely be a place that will leave a good impression. For everyone, this is the kind of ambience and food that I want every Indian place should have. Gets busy over the weekend so make a reservation. \n\nNow that I have commented enough about other things let's get to the food. \n\nAppetizers: order the Fried Idllis, and chennai chicken. Both are nice and good.\n\nMain course: being named Dosa, we had to try some dosa's and they turned out to be pretty good. Over two visits we have tried Mung dosa, Rava dosa, and Paneer Dosa. I liked the Mung and Rava dosa more than the Paneer dosa. We tried some other entrees also: really loved the Prawn masala and the Channa Bhatura.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-26", "description": "A fancy $$$ Indian place in Japantown? Given SF's trends of overpriced food, I was a skeptic but got lured by Restaurant Week, when I found Dosa to be the only place with a worthwhile menu. While most other restaurants feature the anti-climatic addition of a salad and a brownie for a 3-course meal, Dosa became an adventurous feast through spices and creative cooking.\n\n[SMALL PLATES]\n(++) Chips - You start off with complimentary chips, and it's unlike anything I've ever eaten before. It's light, crispy, and has a handful of seeds thrown in.\n(++) Chennai chicken - The expertly roasted chicken maintains a savory juiciness while imparting strong smokey tones, contrasting boldly with the cool cucumber and yogurt sauce. \n(++) Sprouted mung & paneer salad - The varied landscape of flavors was noteworthy, but the texture was truly outstanding. This dish deserves some mindful eating to fully appreciate how the chewy coconut, crunchy pomegranate, and springy arugula simultaneously influence the sprouted mung bean, which ends up tasting more crispy or soft depending on what ends up in that particular forkful. The paneer is interestingly akin to tofu, and I enjoyed the pure taste in contrast to the more pungent versions I usually see.\n(++) Beet croquettes - The sophisticated take pulls off a vegetable-based, cream-free, extra creamy croquettes. Not only does the blend of several vegetables create a palatable base; the incorporation of spices, nuts, curry, and a cranberry chutney adds extra layers of complexity.\n\n[CURRIES ETC.]\n(+++) Nagai vegetable korma - I chose this somewhat as a chore so we could eat our veggies, knowing that vegetable dishes typically pales next to meat dishes (even at State Bird!) But we (even the boo who is usually carnivorous) were blown away. The perfect spice blends of age-old South Indian cuisine combined with novelty vegetables like marble potatoes and romanesco creates a dish that looks modest but synergistically showcases the magic of fresh produce and ethnic cooking. How Californian :)\n(+) Goan prawn masala - I was unimpressed by the portion size of one shrimp per person, and that these were standard-sized shrimp and not prawns. The marsala is constructed from distinctly fresh ingredients, but was dominated by the fiery spiciness.\n(+++) Roasted masala lamb shank - In an era when fine dining consists of abstractly small portions, this ginormous leg of a lamb was a surprise and well worth the extra charge. The 5-hour slow braising resulted in fall-off-the-bone tender and had a similar pervasively roasty flavors to the chennai chicken (excellent savory dish in itself, but exacerbates the spiciness of the prawn masala). The mix of spices with the vegetable-based seasoning added subtlety, and the lamb paired well with the fragrant lemon herb rice.\n\n[DESSERT]\n(+/-) Sweet cheese patties - Not sure if my expectations had just built up too high over the meal or if the dessert is too advanced for me, but despite the intrigue of rose water I think this was my least favorite. The cheese itself had a limp texture and tasted in between savory cheese and dessert, and the conglomerate of cream/nut/cardamom/floral added to the confusion for me. \n(+) Pistachio barfi - As a whole it tasted like an artisan dark chocolate; however it was too sugary, which overshadowed any fascinations from cashew milk and hibiscus. \n\n[DRANKS]\n(++) Mango lassi ($5) - Good mango flavor, easy to drink and not too thick.\n\nWith the tagline \"Urban South Indian dining with a Californian sensibility\", Dosa exemplifies the unique (and delicious) global-local theme that takes the fusion concept to the next level. \n\nPresentation is on-point Instagram-worthy for the most part--from the giant fluffy channa bhatura bread that always catches your eye as it passes by your table, to the fine dining-esque display of beet croquettes on a wooden board with a magenta smear. I actually like how there's also a mix of more plain presentation, such as the vegetable korma in the traditional Indian bowl, which tones down any pretentiousness.\n\nAmbiance is swanky, with extremely dim lighting (if good food pictures are a priority, I strongly recommend coming for a sunny brunch instead). The tall ceilings with a half second level and bar along one side reminds me of NoPa.\n\nAlthough service was friendly, I must say my main gripe overall was the slowness (We arrived at 5:45 and left at 8:45 o.O) (Which meant extra $$ needed for parking; they only validate $2) Ironically, the server checked in with us several times to ask if our round of apps/entrees had arrived, and our answer was that none or only one had come. She also took forever on the mango lassi when boo was breathing fire from the spiciness.\n\nPro tip: Although the menu is extensively notated with dairy/egg/gluten/nut free/vegan, it lacks spiciness warnings. If you can't handle spicy, I suggest avoiding anything that says \"curry leaves\" and/or prophylactically getting yourself a glass of mango lassi.", "author": "Edna C."}

I adore this place so much for their food but unfortunately, their downfall would be their service. We ordered a couple of things and one of the included a mango lassi. We found it a bit too thick and asked if we could have some ice and when we asked about it,  the waiter convinced us not to get it because of the yoghurt blah blah mixed with water blah blah and refused to get us some ice. It startled us that she didn't understand that no matter what she said, we still wanted to get some ice for the lassi. Mind you, Michelin starred restaurants in India serve their lassis with ice and why would you say no to a guest? Second, we didn't like the private label white wine that was served. When we asked about the notes of the wine our waiter didn't know anything about it and defended herself with the fact that she hasn't even tasted it, EVER. ( this wine was their HOUSE WINE/private label which is sold by the glass ) She went to the bar and asked about it. She came back and said that it was from the alabari\u00f1o grape and said that there were certain food pairings that complimented it which she did not mention when I ordered the wine in the first place. The white wine just made everything spicier due to the high acidity and I explained that to her. She said that I shouldn't have ordered alcohol at all cause alcohol makes spicy food worse. There are wines that perfectly pair with Indian food and I wish that she suggested the \" proper food pairings\" for the wine that I got cause apparently she knew about it. Her comment left me pissed quite honestly. I wish the servers knew what they were doing more.

A little too dimly lit for me, perhaps also an oddly desirable music playlist - indie electronic hits?

Some standouts for me were: the Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad, Goan Prawn Masala, and the Classic Masala Dosa (the chef was also nice enough to give us an additional Sweet Potato Dosa to accommodate the 4 of us). The curries were spicy even for me, but I love me a good spicy dish - so no complaints from me although that could be an area of concern for many others.

Definitely more on the fancy/trendy end of Indian food so expect to pay more than the classic Indian joint\n\nCame with a group of 5 for SF Restaurant Week on a Saturday night. Not sure if it was because of SFRW or if it's always like this, but this place was really busy. I could only get a reservation at 5:45pm or at like 9pm a few days in advance. We ended up coming at 5:45 and by the time we left around 7:30, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated.\n\nAmbiance here is very lively and energetic. There's a huge bar and some communal tables on the first floor and tables on two floors. Tall ceilings, dim lighting and chic decor scream nice and trendy.\n\nWe decided to order 2 sets of the 3-course SFRW menu, 1 appetizer and 2 dosas to split between everyone for a total of 3 appetizers, 4 dosas and 2 other entrees, which was plenty to share. The menu can be a little overwhelming if you're not familiar with Southeast Indian cuisine. They're known for their dosas, which are large, crispy Indian crepes generally filled with potatoes and/or other fillings, all of which are served with coconut and tomato chutneys and a vegetable and lentil dipping soup. If you can't decide what to get, you can always opt for their seasonal prix-fixe tasting menu to help narrow down your options!\n\nSome of the portion sizes were pretty small, especially the appetizers, so they were a little hard for sharing. The dosas were very large and filling though, especially the masala (potato-filled) ones. I'd recommend skipping the other entrees though. They were still good, but they were much more expensive than the dosas and rather small in portion size.\n\nOverall, everything was pretty tasty. Lots of flavor and all the meat dishes were cooked very well, but most of the dishes didn't leave a lasting impression. Standouts of the night were definitely the Green Mango & Paneer Dosa (from the SFRW menu) and the White Truffle Masala Dosa. Definitely would want to return to try some more of their dosas.\n\n** APPETIZERS **\n\n-SHREDDED DUCK ($14) - 4/5\n[spicy vindaloo-style, chiles, ginger, garlic, vinegar, caramelized onion uttapam]\nTender, spicy, flavorful.\n\n-COCHIN CALAMARI ($12) - 4/5\n[sauteed with mildly-spiced coconut milk]\nSuper tender, lightly sweet, full of flavor\n\n-SOUTH INDIAN SEAFOOD CIOPPINO ($17) - 4.5/5\n[coconut stew, shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallops]\nDelicious! Light, fragrant, coconutty broth with a slight kick.\n\n** DOSAS **\n\n-GREEN MANGO & PANEER DOSA - 5/5\n[spicy, pickled mango relish, shredded farmer's cheese, cilantro]\nMMM absolutely amazing. I don't know where the mango was in this, but it was lightly sweet and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. If you're not a fan of potatoes, this is definitely a good dosa alternative. Not quite as heavy as the masala dosas either.\n\n-WHITE TRUFFLE MASALA DOSA ($15) - 5/5\n[classic masala dosa, truffle oil]\nI love truffle oil so I loved this! But only the parts of the dosa that actually had the truffle oil.. The truffle wasn't very consistent in the dosa so a lot of it was just a normal masala dosa. But the truffled parts were delicious!\n\n-LAMB KEEMA DOSA ($15) - 4/5\n[plain dosa, side of minced lamb & diced potatoes]\nThe lamb was yummy, but as a dosa as a whole, it wasn't quite as special as some of the others. Worth a try, but if you're a more adventurous eater, it might be a little disappointing.\n\n-SPICY BASIL DOSA ($13) - 2/5\n[masala dosa, fresh basil chutney, cashew nuts, shallots, ginger, curry leaves, chiles]\nMeh. Tasted like a regular masala dosa to me. I don't think anyone in my group got any of the spicy basil part of it. No idea where that basil chutney was.. I'd pass on this in the future.\n\n** ENTREES **\n\n-HYDERABADI LAMB BIRYANI ($31) - 4/5\n[basmati rice, spiced sauce, raita]\nThe lamb was soft and tender, and the rice was nice and fluffy. Delicious overall, but for $31, I was definitely expecting a bigger portion size. At least more rice if not more lamb.\n\n-KERALA FISH MOILEE ($32) - 4/5\n[coconut milk, curry leaves, ginger, coconut rice]\nWow, that fish was cooked soo well. So soft and moist. The curry part honestly was just okay, but the fish was definitely the star here. Again, small portion size for the price.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Turns out the avocado bhel had chickpeas, which we informed our waitress about and later spoke with the manager about.

The manager confirmed with the chefs and they blatantly lied and denied that there was chickpeas. The manager had to show the actual split chickpeas in the filling before they accepted it.

We were seated upstairs with minimal wait despite being unable to secure reservations for the same time over the phone. I would suggest to sit downstairs if given the choice.\n\nOur waiter greeted us and gave some recommendations of his favorites. However, once we placed our orders, the food would get brought out by another server. Something was definitely amiss because on 2 occasions the server attempted to drop off the same item which was already delivered earlier. We did not get one of the dishes at all. Given that some of the diners ordered the same dishes through the tasting menu and independently, we would have appreciated if the waiter would have brought out the food or at least stopped by to explain who the dishes belonged to and what they were but alas, this wasn't the case.\n\nGiven the price point of most entrees averaging between $25-30 and drink $15 and small portion sizes, our group was expecting more attentive and enthusiastic services. Instead, our waiter definitely had a \"too cool for school\" attitude. \n\nAs far as the food itself goes, I was not impressed. My Marsala dosa was good but nothing to write home about. I did not find the chutneys particularly flavorful. There was heat and saltiness but I did not pick up on any intricate flavors. The chicken korma was one of the blandest I've had to date. I added the chutneys from my dosa for more flavor.\n\nAfter dropping $60 on just one entree and one Dosa split between me and my husband, we were still hungry. \n\nPET PEEVE: this restaurant adds a \"service charge\" automatically to the bill. To ensure that we don't mess this up, we asked our waiter what the service charge was. He was so shady and replied that he is \" not sure, but [he] thinks it's the gratuity .\" He really didn't want us to know so that we would tip him on top of it.

Last Christmas Eve was a lovely and special treat for our family! This year at Christmas week, I wanted to treat my new husband and made a reservation...before we walked in, I told him \"prepare to be dazzled\"!\nwell, we walk in and give the hostess our name and she doesn't even look up at us, nor welcome us whatsoever! Even tho we are having an early reservation and there are many tables open, she ushers us to a table next to a family with a baby that is crawling all over the booth...I made the choice to sit an another table right away. We had always been impressed with the professional service, but our server, sadly, must have been a bus-person yesterday. The first 3 dishes we ordered off the menu were no longer being served...it was early in the evening...there was no Indian wine on the menu this time...etc, etc...alas, my husband and I were less than \"dazzled\" and both ended up with gastric distress later on in the evening even tho we ordered our food mild in spiciness.\n...is Dosa going out of business or what??", "author": "Kay H."}

We wanted to avoid the standard restaurants in the South Bay and focus on something in downtown. A friend of ours had recommended this place, so I was completely down to give it a try!\n\nDOSA has a very festive resort lounge vibe. There are huge ceilings with a very spacious bar area, couch seats like Starbucks, and then there's the main dining hall. The hosts were very professional - as soon as you enter, you are ushered in, seated and promptly handed the menu.\n\nI decided to go with the Mixed Chile Uttapam, which is a thick dosa-pancake with 3 types of chili. I was warned this would be spicy! I rounded up my meal with some ginger chai tea, which was great! They do take a while to bring out the orders, but once it came out, it was magnificent. Perfectly cooked, perfectly arranged and the chutneys and sambar they serve with the dosa were impeccable. \n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. It's bright, vibrant, and hip with good quality food. Whether it be for family dinners, birthday dinners, or casual get togethers, it makes for an excellent place to gather.", "author": "Steve N."}

We had samosa, masala dosa, and channa bhatura.\n\nThe samosas were OK, though they had long strings of crunchy, undercooked carrot slivers that were off-putting. I expected fully-cooked filling, so this was a bit of a surprise. They were also tiny.\n\nThe channa bhatura and masala dosa were, to be fair, fine. I don't recall being particularly impressed, but not necessarily disappointed. We also got 3x mango lassi, which were inoffensive, but unimpressive and a bit lacking in mango flavor.\n\nIt was more than a bit surprising to end up paying $70+ for this meal. In Berkeley, you'd pay less than half and get more food. (I realize driving to Berkeley isn't necessarily an option, but if it is for you, skip San Francisco entirely and do Chaat Cafe or Udupi Palace in the East Bay. Decent quality food, more of it, more reasonable prices.)\n\nLook, it's San Francisco in 2018. Everything is priced insanely high. Still, there are other South Indian places in the city (Udupi Palace in the Mission, for instance) that have better food and better prices. (And of course, the East Bay is even more economical.)\n\nI think I get the purpose of trying to take a less-common type of cuisine (South Indian) and turn it into a trendy, hip place for yuppies, but there just isn't value for money here, even factoring in San Francisco's ridiculous cost of living.

When a friend suggested it as her birthday dinner locale, I jumped right into the group reservation.  \n\nOur group saddled up to the bar about 15 minutes before our reservation.  The drink \"Spice Route Cocktails\" menu is unique, filled with hot and cold fruity, spicy, and exotic drinks.  Notable drinks include the Port of Call, a warm drink, and Emerald Monk, a fruity vodka cocktail enjoyed by the birthday girl.\n\nOur table decided to feast family style with a selection of dosas, bhaturas, and three main dishes.  We also split a bottle of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.  The food arrived in phases and in a very timely manor.  The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and very attentive.  \n\nThe meal began with wine and a bowl of snack chips.  It was long before our first round of dosas and uttapam arrived.  Wow-- these are excellent.  We tried a variety and sincerely enjoyed them all.  I particularly enjoyed the truffle uttapam and the quinoa thinnai uttapam.  All of these were served with a delicious array of chutneys.  \n\nThe bhatura arrived, which is a fun giant puffy bun, along with our three main entrees.  The bhatura was a delicious device to soak up  sauces in the main dishes.  I sincerely enjoyed the mango prawn dish, but felt as though the shrimp was slightly overcooked.  Our table enjoyed the Tamil Lamb (I skipped this dish because I don't care for lamb, I sampled the sauce by dipping a piece of bhatura in the entree)\n\nSide note:  I just discovered that this place has a happy hour menu!

The decor and lighting here is gorgeous!\n\nThe house cocktails revolve largely around gin and bourbons (like most of SF), but the rum-based Ginger Ante ($12) was great - dark rum mixed with ginger and ginger ale, decorated with a rosemary sprig. They also have wines, beers, a virgin mocktail list, lassis, and chai. \n\nThe service here was friendly and helpful to our group. We got lots of great drink recommendations, and even though our menu was prix fixe, they were attentive to whether or not there were any allergies or diet restrictions in our group. \n\nI can't at all speak to how authentic/legit/real the food is - it looked and tasted like real food to me, it just wasn't really anything that I'd be returning for anytime soon. Dosas are essentially potatoes wrapped in crepe and served with chutneys; this carb bomb was by far the best part of our meal, although reading other reviews makes me think I should come back and get my hands on an actual menu. \n\nOur first course was a brussel sprout dish that seems like it belonged with a Thanksgiving spread, and the none of the curries (lamb and shrimp) were finished. We ended up picking the shrimp out, and left a lot of the lamb. \n\nWhile there was good heat in a lot of the dishes we had, the flavors didn't particularly compliment each other, and it was weird receiving all of our food in courses. Given the prices of this place on a regular night, I can't really justify coming back on my own. \n\nIf you're looking for a unique place with a beautiful atmosphere though, check em' out!", "author": "Laura B."}

You see, as much as I love the flavors of Indian food, my wimpy digestive system can't take to the spices or spiciness too much, to the point where I always have to order \"tikka masala\" or some other basic bro choice. \n\nAt Dosa, our waitress was very thoughtful about making suggestions for lovers and haters of spiciness alike, and I truly got to enjoy all of the delicious flavors of their food without regretting the meal later... if you know what I mean. \n\nWhat I really recommend is the tasting menu- at the time I went in late 2015, it allowed us each to select an appetizer, entree, and dessert, each at a smaller portion than the a la carte version. This made for a fun way to share a little bit of everything and see what we liked for next time. (I'm Asian and need to eat family style and try EVERYTHING, so this was a win for me!) I loved the truffle masala dosa and trying the 5 different uttapams - each had a different flavor, and when dipped in the many sauces they provided, there were so many combinations that the whole meal felt pretty exciting.\n\nOn top of the good food and opportunity to sample everything, the ambiance was really purdy- perfect for a date or special occasion. \n\nThe cost was higher than most Indian food, but the service, selections, and atmosphere made it all worth it. (Not to mention they have a pretty good chai tea, too.) Highly recommended when you're in The Fillmore!!", "author": "Stephen D."}

This was probably the only item I was disappointed with that evening.  In second course, I selected Roasted Chile & Garlic Dosa - was very good.  Third course was Karaikudi Chicken Korma.  This was a good dish, but nothing outstanding about it.  Also, the serving sizes are decent, so tasting menu can easily be shared between two.\n3) Drinks - various drinks were ordered.  Steph Curry, Peony, Uncut Old fashioned.  My favorite would be Peony followed by Steph Curry.  \n4) Rasmalai - very good\n\nDOSA is pricey, but classy.

I just tried to buy a gift card for someone else.\n\nFirst, I tried to buy a $30 gift card. Initially, they charged me sales tax on it. So I had to point this out and ask why they were charging tax on a gift card. It took a lot of effort for them to cancel the transaction and redo it correctly. \n\nSecond, it's not a \"real\" gift card - it expires in one year, they said, which is illegal in California. Gift cards aren't allowed to have expiration dates. I didn't say anything because it likely wouldn't matter to them, but clearly the owner or manager isn't interested in actually researching the law.\n\nThird, they gave me the card but no envelope. I asked for an envelope to put it in, and it took almost 10 minutes for someone to bring one.\n\nI realize it's Saturday at 1 pm and I understand that you are likely busy, but I'm just asking for a little up front honesty here. If you can't give me a gift card, fine - I won't waste both our time. But if you claim to offer the service, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same exact gift card experience here as I get at literally any other restaurant.\n\nIt took 15 minutes for this whole thing.\n\nI haven't even eaten here.

I did like how since we did order more than our table could hold, she actually staggered the meals so that we could have ample space to enjoy one, and promptly have the next one as soon as we finished. Also, another kind gentlemen came by for our drink orders while we were waiting to be seated. How rad is that to be treated well even before your seated.\n\nFood (4/5): We shared the idli fries, sweet potato dosa, and lambed keema dosa. The fries were coated with this powder, which had a nice kick to it. The sweet potato dosa came out first and I loved the presentation. The sweet potato filling was hidden inside the nicely wrapped dosa. I liked the sponginess of the dosa, rather than the crispy sections. But that's just my preference. The sweet potato still had a savory flavor to them that I really enjoy. Plus the chutneys that came on the side also was a nice touch. We were pretty full by the time the lamb keema came out. I was a tad disappointed since the lamb was really finely diced, so you don't get the texture of the meat, but you can still taste it. It was a bit spicy, but we did enjoy it as well.\n\nDrinks (4/5): I normally don't order drinks, but somtimes you have to treat yo'self. Being a huge Warriors fan, I knew I had to go with the Steph Curry. My gf also ordered the mango is the new black. I will say these drinks are strong, so you do get your moneys worth.

Educate yourselves before you consider yourself an Indian cuisine aficionado. \n\nThe mushroom uttapam is to die for. The rasmalai is extremely flavorful, something that is usually lacking in most Indian restaurants. All the dishes made here taste authentic and have a fusion flair. You can't miss out on this San Francisco charm.", "author": "Deepti N."}

We were craving for some Indian food, and DOSA on Fillmore popped right up on Yelp! We order vada pav for appetizer, and it was a good start. The tamarind chutney on the vada pav complimented the chili/caramelized onion relish. It's very different from what you get in the streets of Mumbai, but sumptuous nonetheless. For the main course we ordered Poori, Asparagus Utthappam, and paneer butternut squash dosa. The Poori was the only mediocre dish, but the others were finger licking good. We rounded it off with some Rasmalai, which was easily the highlight of the course.\nOne star off for the Poori, will definitely visit again.", "author": "Bala R."}

The Brussel sprouts and samosas dishes were both colorful and beautifully plated. The Brussel sprouts also had an interesting fusion of flavors and nuts. The samosas are smaller triangles and only came with the green sauce-- the tamarind sauce was just a small dripping on the plate. \n\nThe dosas were good! We had the spicy pear dosa and the rava masala dosa. At first I wasn't sure if I had received the pear one because the potato flavor overpowered the light pear taste in the wrap. But eating more of the wrap by itself revealed the lightly sweet taste\n\nOverall, the service here is not great. The waitress would come interrupt us repeatedly mid-conversation to check in.

Any group over 13 people requires rental of a semi-private place in the mezzanine - and this comes with an astronomical price tag.\n\nI called to make a reservation for a birthday dinner for 16 people, including a toddler that would not be eating. The price tag for this reservation was a $2,700 food and beverage minimum and a mandatory fixed menu. Say what?!?! This would come out to nearly $180/head, which puts this restaurant in the Michelin star category, which it clearly is not. While the food a good, it is a far cry from being worth $180/head! If we were not required to order off of a pre-fixed menu and book a semi-private room with a minimum, there is no way we would spend anywhere close to this amount. The price of a dosa is less than $20!\n\nWhen I questioned the per head fee, noting that the mandatory fixed menu cost would be $45 per person for a vegetarian menu and explained that over half our party doesn't drink so consuming wine would not make up the price gap, I was given no other alternative. The catering director was rigid, rude, and inflexible. She basically said we could rent the space or not be given the opportunity to reserve a table.\n\nShe then went into detail about how she had to turn tables at a certain rate to make a profit so I suppose our family wasn't worth taking up a precious table at this establishment. The pretentious attitude made me sick - clearly all these people care about is making a profit. They don't care if it means turning away customers that aren't as \"profitable\".\n\nIn a city of numerous top notch restaurants, there really is no need to frequent this place. They have lost some of their most loyal customers, as we will not be returning. The food is good, but not good enough to put up with terrible management and service. If you want a good Dosa, try just about any of the hole in the wall restaurants off EL Camino in the South Bay.

The man and I walked in right at 5 and plopped down at the gigantic bar. \n\nEverything at DOSA is enormous, from the high ceilings to the massive chandelier, to the large Shiva statue and other oversized decorations. Go big or go home seems to be the theme, and it carried over to the food as well. \n\nHappy hour starts at 5pm with drinks (1 beer, 2 cocktails, 2 wines) and from 5.30-7pm you can enjoy select appetizers at discounted prices as well. We started with 2 glasses of white wine and, once the kitchen opened, opted for the Tacos \"Frankie\" that were the winner of Taco Knockdown SF in 2015. Spicy Vindaloo-style duck and heirloom tomatoes nestled into an egg brushed roti taco and served with a side of creamy coconut chutney. These were killer! Perfect levels of spice and flavor. You get 3 tacos at happy hour for $9. We also had the pappadum & chutney sampler for $4 - it comes with unlimited refills of the crispy lentil wafers and you get 4 chutneys. Our chutneys that day were mint, tamarind, roasted chile-garlic, and apricot. All completely different from one another and bursting with flavor. \n\nDOSA has a great cocktail menu and the ingredients in each are extensive and exotic. I tried their newest concoction, the Kerala Rhum Runner - Batiste Rhum, curried strawberry gastrique, creme de violette, mint, lemon, champagne for $13. My man chose the Steph Curry - Four Roses Bourbon, curried nectar, spiced agave, lime, Tempranillo for $13. Both were unique and damn delicious. All the ingredients come through at different moments when you're slurping these cocktails. \n\nWe ordered some food of the regular dinner menu. You simply have to try a dosa when you come here as that's what they're clearly known for. All dosas get served with sambar (a lentil & veggie dipping \"soup\") and fresh coconut & tomato chutneys. After consulting with the bartender on his favorites, we went with the Roasted Chile & Garlic dosa. The mashed potatoes had the perfect consistency and the great spice kick that we were looking for. To cool our tongues a bit we also ordered the Dahi vada small plate. You get a bowl of cool organic Strauss yogurt over a large lentil fritter, all seasoned with tamarind, mint, and mild spices. I absolutely loved this dish and kept slurping yogurt with my spoon. \n\nOur two bartenders were awesome, talkative, and fun. One of them even gave us a sampler tasting of a new tequila that is made only with the tops of the agave plant as this can then regrow and makes for a much more sustainable tequila making process compared with the traditional way of chopping the whole agave plant off. \n\nWe left with very rotund and happy bellies.

We went there on a Monday night (party of 4) and despite it not being very busy, the service was slow, the server was rude and uninterested, we never got any attention unless we jumped out of our seat to flag him down (literally). The portion size of one of our orders was CLEARLY off, and when we mentioned this to him, we got a snarky remark with an attitude. I'm Indian and I have had Idli's all my life, don't tell me 1 whole idly and  1/2 another makes a portion...admit it was a mistake and move on.

I would embrace such attitude in a low budget Chinatown restaurant, where rude service is a part of the culture, but for Dosa...THE DOSA, no sir, it doesn't fly.\n\nWith the ever growing restaurant scene in the Bay Area, I will find another place to spend my money and feel more welcomed.\n\nThat was my $0.02.", "author": "Tarun P."}

The ambiance is very chic, they have bollywood music playing in the background, the hosts are ethnically dressed (they try) and the menu is traditional Indian but with a touch of westernization. \nI have been to Dosa multiple times. The one on Fillmore is definitely much bigger and busier than one on Valencia. During my multiple visits I have tried and loved each of the following: dahi vada, vada pav, egg curry, mysore dosa, masala dosa, the uttapa sampler and the cocktails! They get reaaaly busy on weekends so making a reservation is necessary unless you don't mind a long wait time.

Made reservation on Yelp, arrived a bit early, and were seated promptly. Megan, our server, was wonderful. Since we were new to southern Indian food, she recommended several starters (chutney, spiced avocado chaat, pepper shrimp) and a main Dosa dish (alas, can't remember what Megan brought to us): all good and just the right amount of food. I think I'm still a fan of northern Indian food, but this was a grand experience. High ceilings (used to be a bank?), good music, pleasant ambiance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-11", "description": "I came here with 4 of my friends tonight and have to say that I'm very disappointed in the service. I'm only giving this two stars solely because the food was good and the bus boy was our saving grace (I wish we got his name to thank him). That being said, I don't think I've ever had an experience like this before. \n\nWe made a reservation for 8pm and arrived on time. We were told to get drinks at the bar while they \"prepared\" our table. You would think that their phrasing meant that our table was just about ready, but they needed to set it up. Well, around 8:30 we still weren't seated. When we asked about the status of our table (twice), we were met with \"the people at your table are paying now\". Interesting. I'm curious why we couldn't be seated at another table that left closer to our reservation. It wasn't even that crowded. Around 8:45 we're finally seated. \n\nWe're immediately greeted with waters by the awesome bus boy. A few minutes later one of the managers comes by-unprompted- to apologize for the wait, they \"got a new system that's buggy and difficult for everyone to learn\". While I understand that implementing and teaching new technology can be tricky, it's no excuse for making your customers feel forgotten about. \n\nWe had to ask random employees multiple times to please get our waiter. We only saw the man twice the entire meal: the first was after practically begging someone to get him so we could order, the second as we were leaving. That first encounter came almost 20 minutes after sitting down (9:10ish). There was no acknowledgement that we've been waiting, just \"what would you like to drink?\" \"We're ready to order, *order*\" \"Okay\" *walks away*. \n\nAround 9:30 none of our appetizers or food have been delivered, and the only person who had paid us any mind was the busboy. I think he noticed our frustration and gave us these chip things to help settle our hungry stomachs. \n\nWe had to physically call over a random waiter so that we could ask for a manager. A different manager than before approaches us, and we explain how frustrated we are. He claims it's the system again, and \"it has nothing to do with you guys\". Damn right it's nothing to do with us, we've done nothing but try to dine at your establishment. We counter with trying to explain that the system doesn't account for the fact that we've only seen the waiter once when we requested him. He comes back with the same statement that it's the system it's been like this all night and it's not our fault. I've now asked why, if this has been happening for so long, they haven't gone back to simple pen and paper? After trying to get through that at this point we don't think it's really the system, and having him assure us it's the system, we ask \"so is our order even in this system?\" \"I'll go check on that and bring you some things.\" To which we say, \"Are those things going to be what we ordered?\" And no response there. \n\nIt's nice to be offered free extras, but frankly we just wanted our actual order and to be assured that it was coming in a timely manner, and we didn't get that. We after joked that we would need to go pick up burger King from across the street  while waiting. \n\nSuddenly all the food comes out at once. All the appetizers and entr\u00e9es all together. It was overwhelming and not a great presentation. In the back of my mind I question whether this has been sitting out for us waiting for our absent waiter to retrieve it (although he did not bring anything to our table at any point, I stand by my statement that we saw him twice). \n\nThe food was good, I'll say that. I enjoyed everything we ordered plus those 2 extras. I don't think the food was worth this experience. \n\nEverything went fine after eating. No complaints about that... Except the auto gratuity of 20 percent for parties of five and above. I'm usually for tipping well, but it's ridiculous that we don't get a choice in the matter when the service was through and through horrible. I've written only a few yelp reviews, and haven't reviewed in a while, but I felt that this really needed to be said.

I asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. I could not be more depressed about this. I ordered the Idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the prawn masala as my entree. The curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. My mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor.

This was my 2nd time and still held up to my first experience which was last June. The place is posh and fun. Full bar. So not traditional looking in style, but I personally love that. \n\nThis time they had a family style menu in addition to their regular menu which is nice for those of us inexperienced with Indian cuisine. It was 3 starters, 3 main dishes, and 2 desserts. $45 per person. It was fantastic. Very fair for what you get and you get to pick. I'm not going to nail the names since I'm truly an American, so I apologize in advance. \n\nWe started with the salad which was arugula, sprouts (I believe) and pomegranate seeds with season tofu. Delicious and refreshing. Perfect starter. We then had a dosa with seared scallops and it was divine...lemony, herbaceous, and a hint of spice. Next was the Chenala chicken...wow. Sooo tasty! I loved the light crisp and spices with a yogurt sauce for dipping. \n\nFor entrees we got a vegetable dish as well as a lamb dosa and prawns. The dishes came with rice. The prawns were kind of curry style and the sauce was delicious. We dipped the chips that came at the start in the sauce. The dosa was amazing. The ground lamb was so flavorful. I wish I could remember all the spices. What I loved is that it was just the right heat. Not too spicy, just enough. \n\nWe wrapped up with a refreshing mango sorbet and a decadent, but not to heavy pistachio chocolate torte which came with fresh berries. \n\nWe also enjoyed cocktails & wine. I loved the Peony and the Albari\u00f1o. Definitely recommend for the meal. \n\nThe service was also wonderful. Kirstin did a great job...friendly, fun, and helpful.

We had to drown our sorrows and discuss what went wrong over some drinks. Dosa was the shoulder we used to cry on. \n\nWe had a reservation for 5:30pm but since we didn't escape the room in time (so sad), we arrived a little bit later so they weren't ready for us (maybe they gave our table away or ???) The place feels gigantic with high ceilings, bigw windows but still plenty of mood lighting. They have a happy hour but it only applies if you sit at the bar - not at the tables which kinda sucks. \n\nWe sat down comfortably upstairs in a group of 10 and were immediately served this delicious, warm papadum which is crispy flavorful chips made out of chickpeas. Delicious and  kinda healthy - i don't know why papadum isn't sold more commercially! \nA majority of my table got the Emerald Monk - highly recommended my friend who consideres Dosa her home away home. It's a beautiful chartreuse with vodka, lime, chili agave, and ginger. Everyone had really positive reviews about. I ordered the Peony - Gin, hibisucs masala nectar, coconut, lime, birds eye chile. Highly recommended. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of snacks for the whole table: Chennai chicken - perfect bite sized with raw onion slices and cool dipping sauce,  vindaloo style duck tacos - spicy with a green sauce, samosas that were gigantic and very shareable, veggie sliders - spicy with a side salad, and idli fries - thick cut fries with powered lentils - looked  like they'd be cajun fries but don't taste like much - kinda bland actually. All the shared small plates are definitely large enough to be their own dish if it's just for one person, especially if they come with a side salad it's giving off those vibes. \nService was fantastic as always, very quick and friendly.

Every time we've gone, we've gone at prime dinner time (7pm-8pm) and have seen a long wait. Every time, we've miraculously found a spot at the bar or been seated at a table in record time. Lucky, I guess! I am not a huge fan of eating at the bar here, as it is busy and noisy. I'm paying the same for the meal, I would prefer the \"full\" experience. Sitting at a table is lovely and service at both table and bar is top notch.\n\nNow for the food: boyfriend always gets a dosa and loves them! I've been a fan of dosas, but for whatever reason I don't dig DOSA's dosas. So I've experimented... One time, I got a mango salad with some sea tuber that was inedible it was so salty. Another time, I got scallops (eh). Once, I just ordered bread. Last time, I got the prawn masala which was great. I finally found my dish. One thing never changes: I always order the bhatura. Oh. My. Sweet. Jesus. I love this bread so much. When it comes out, it's a huge puff the size of your head. Everyone stares. Worth it. It's like low key fried dough. I could eat that bread every day (and do every time we go to DOSA). Huge highlight even when my main dish isn't to die for. \n\nOverall, love this place.

Their service was always friendly, efficient, & accommodating. Unfortunately, last nite was a total let down. We made reservations for 5:30pm & requested a table by the giant window in the front. Why you ask? Surely not because we crave being gawked at while eating our dinner... we requested that section because my husband has a bad back & that section & only that section has the comfy sofa-like chairs with a relatively high back compared to the regular chairs. \n\nAs we checked in with the hostess, we were told that indeed they've reserved our table as requested, but they have no one to serve that section until 6pm & asked if we wouldn't mind waiting at the bar till that time. Now we've reserved 5:30pm tables here many times so we could make our 7pm movie, so we declined. We asked if we could sit at one of the high back wall sofa seats instead. She said yes & off we go. Unfortunately it was to a tiny little corner table for 2 that juts up against a giant beam... very claustrophobic! So we ask if we could have a table that's a little more open & the waiter said \"yes\" & proceeded to lead us to the opposite side where an identically claustrophobic table was located only it juts up against a beam on the right side this time. So getting frustrated we asked if we could have a different table other than the 2 corner ones that would be less constrictive. The waiter looked totally confused & that's when the hostess stepped in & asked if we would like to sit up stairs. Now if we wanted to sit upstairs where it gets stuffy & hot, we would have asked to be seated upstairs. We've literally sat everywhere possible at Dosa & we prefer the seats we requested. I can't believe that in a restaurant that's 99% empty (I counted 3 tables of diners & a half dozen at the bar) yet you can't accommodate 2 people? REALLY!!!!! We thanked the hostess for her efforts, or should I have said the lack of it, & left disappointed.\n\nWe're not sure if we'll be back. It really is too bad, because Dosa was our \"go to\" almost every time we watch a movie at the Kabuki.", "author": "Amen C."}

In general the place looked great, service is amazing, and the food... just great. \n\nWe had dosa (served with one of the best sambars I've ever had), and a chicken curry. The curry was advertised with lemon rice, but came with plain jasmine. Here is the reason for 4 star. While the waiter apologized and actually brought a free lemon rice as well, the lemon rice was bad. My mother in law is from Tamil Nadu and has passed her recipes on to me. This was not good lemon rice. Week and not lemony in the slightest. Additionally, the chicken curry was bland. \n\nTake my word for it, the food here is creative and good. The lemon rice was a lone blemish on an otherwise glowing series of experiences.", "author": "James W."}

My family makes this food all the time and I know good and yes I understand the built in bias but there was some pleasant surprises in the fact I saw an orange chutney I wouldn't think a restaurant would be highlighting. Also the bus boys and manager service was amazing. Been to hundreds of restaurants in India, globally and all over the US and have to say these are the most engaged busy boys I've seen--in fact so much they put my waiter to shame as he didn't pass by much. But bus boys seemed happy, assertive and proactive to make your experience. I lead 120 direct reports myself so I have to assume this behavior is cause of the manager so that's great! But this is a restaurant. This feedback is for the owner: the prices? I know how much dosa would cost to make; cents on the dollar? How can you charge 13-20 dollars for one albeit it being large? And you said Tamil Lamb? Cmon. Nobody in Tamil Nadu puts corn in their lamb dish; is this some adaptation for the Western pallet, I'm not sure. My wife liked but not too authentic. I just could understand how my wife and I were billed nearly 100 dollars and didn't make sense how the entrees total to nearly 30 dollar a peice. And for main reason I gave a 3. The waiter somehow misunderstood me and I said poori and he said curry? I assumed it came with something? And he never gave me poori but a curry that was overpriced. Wasn't happy but I'm not an asshole and I sucked it up. \n\nAnyways yes the dosa was good. Not great but the above set me back and I will say the decor was over the top good. Sure at one point many would give a 5, it's almost there.", "author": "Abubu A."}

They serve typically South Indian style cuisine. \n\nI came with a party of 10 and were seated upstairs where we were able to overlook the bar and rest of the restaurant. I think for large parties, they suggest the tasting menu for $44/person for 3 dishes. You can still add stuff from the regular menu, but the 3 course tasting menu comes in generous portions that will fill you up. I was a bit tired from work that day so the tasting menu was perfect because it didn't require a lot of thinking! Haha!\n\nRed Beet & Cumin Soup - it was made with pureed roasted red beets, and creme fraiche. Very tasty! I've never had beet soup before, its bloody red and very healthy for you.\n\nOrganic Mushroom Uttapam - made with trumpet, maitake and beech mushrooms, cilantro, curry leaves, and drizzled with white truffle oil. This one is my favorite because of the white truffle oil, it added an extra umph to the already fragrant dish. Comes with plenty of dipping sauces.\n\nSpicy Basil Prawns - basil leaves, caramelized onions, chile, tamarind, ginger, garlic, tomato and coconut rice. Mildly spicy and really tasty on top of the fragrant  coconut rice! \n\nI'd definitely come back so I can try some of their other things off the regular menu!", "author": "Janny S."}

It wasn't cooked too long so didn't have a rubbery texture at all.  It was also accompanied by a uttanapam (like a pancake thing) and a side of greens, which were great complements.\n\nWe ordered the chard and sweet peppers dosa as part of our entree.  The chard was slightly bitter, as expected, but not overwhelming so.  And the flavors balanced nicely with each other and the sauces.  The dosa also came with a side of soup that was SO wonderful.  Hearty and flavorful.  My friend said she actually prefers to order the dosa plain and just enjoy that soup with it, which I could see ordering next time.\n\nFor our entree we ordered the chicken korma.  I really liked it, but I also didn't notice anything super special about it.  Just basic, good dish.\n\nOur servers were really wonderful.  They knew my one friend hated the taste of cilantro, so when we ordered lemon rice they brought her plain rice.  Also they were very friendly and just the right level of attentive without being overbearing.  Our only note is that at the beginning of the meal it took a long time for them to take our initial order, which felt even longer bc we were really hungry!\n\nThis place is pricier than \"normal\" Indian restaurants, but actually sharing food with my 2 friends we actually only paid $19 each and we were very full at the end of our meal!", "author": "Mia N."}

She said no problem and in the end that was a true statement. \n\nMy friend ordered the Channa Bhatura which came w/some garbanzo stew which you dipped your doughy baked thing into.

I was very disappointed in their service. From the get go our waiter seemed very half-assed. He didn't seem like he enjoyed being there. I even asked him for recommendations on what to eat... I think he had no idea. He just listed what they had and left us to read the menu on our own. He did that twice. We asked him about drinks and when he came back..  he did that for food. Like \"hey, read it yourself because I'm lazy and I know nothing\".  \n\nOnce we got our meals we were rushed to leave. Our waiter asked us 3 times if we were finished in the last bites of our meal... In less than 15 minutes. We could barely enjoy the last bites in our meal! The other 2 waiters also rushed us out. I even told one of our busboys that we were still working on our lamb curry and he took it away, anyway! What the hell. \n\nIn summary, we paid a lot for our meal and we get shit for service.

Therefore, whenever I find an Indian restaurant that experiments with innovative ideas and concepts, I am always intrigued because very few do it well.\n\nTo be honest, I was initially drawn to this place because of their happy hour menu, specifically the idli fries. Unfortunately, there was not enough time before our reservation to enjoy the happy hour menu so we instead ordered the fries at our table. They were amazing! We also sampled the cocktails which were very innovative. I would definitely come here just for the happy hour menu!\n\nFor the main dining experience, we all ordered the tasting menu that was featured for restaurant week with the wine pairing. Now, as any wine snob knows, pairing wine with Indian food is one of the biggest challenges in the world and few know how to do it properly. DOSA did know... The wines were not only amazing but they went REALLY well with the food. We got a mixture of items including kebabs, dosas, biryanis, fish, and chicken and they were all delicious.\n\nAmber India is still my favorite Indian restaurant in the Bay Area but DOSA is definitely the biggest competitor for them now.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-14", "description": "My buddies wanted to get together for a guys night out and picked this place. Three of us decided to meet for dinner on a Tuesday night. Didn't realize there was an upscale Indian restaurant in Filmore district. I wouldn't say it's authentic rather an Indian fusion cuisine with  a bar and club like ambience without the dance floor.\n\nLet me start with parking. The restaurant is in Lower Pacific Heights at the intersection of Filmore St and Post St. There's no dedicated parking for Dosa, so I had to go around the block a few times to find a parking 2 blocks away. Even on a Tuesday night the place was buzzing like it was a weekend. There's a full bar downstairs with a dining area, up the stairs there are few more tables. Very well decorated with tasteful lights and music. Downside, the tables are so close to each other that you can be sure your neighbor knows what you ordered.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of Kalamari. This is the first time I have ever had Kalamari in curry paste. The flavor was amazing, but Kalamari did lose a bit of its natural taste like any other fish/meat cooked in Indian curry. It is spicy, but the flavor iss enjoyable for anyone who likes Kalamari. From the name, you can imagine they specialize in Dosa, that is an extra large South Indian thin bread with stuffing. I ordered White Truffle Masala Dosa with Truffle Oil from Alba Italy that was stuffed with potatoes. It was served with 3 types of sauces. The bread was thin and nicely crisped but the stuffing was a bit strong. The flavor was spicy and yummy. We also ordered Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani and Spicy Basil Prawn. The Biriyani had a decent flavor with a kick of spice, but the prawn did not satisfy the pallet. For drink, I ordered Ginger Ale and the server brought me a Blenheim Hot Ginger Ale bottle, one of the best I have ever had. It was complimenting the spicy food very well, so I ended up ordering 3 bottles during the course.\n\nOverall the food was on the spicy side, but there's a great balance of spices, so it's not something you enjoy and regret later. Even though it was very busy, our server was prompt in bringing anything we requested. Had a great meal and a good time...looking forward to coming back in future.", "author": "Ash A."}

I knew I wanted to go to at least 4 restaurants this time, and the $85 put me off.  Well, I looked at the menu at Dosa on Fillmore.  My roommate and I looked at each other and then it became the \"I'll go if you go\" situation.  So we went!\n\nWe started with a sparkling wine to go with our appetizer.  I ordered the petrale sole porichadu.  The sole was fried to perfection and went well with the winter chutney, which I think was made from squash.  The side salad had hints of coconut and other spices.  It was a great way to start the dinner.\n\nFor the second course, I ordered the khageena dosa, which had scrambled eggs, ginger, ghee, and cilantro.  The dosa came with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and lentil soup.  I really liked the lentil soup.  It was fragrant and spicy, and went well with the sweetness of the carrots and red bell peppers.  I wasn't a fan of the tomato chutney.  I preferred the coconut chutney with this dosa.  Which, by the way, was delicious.  Despite all the ingredients, like ginger and cilantro, it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the egg.  It was overall a balanced dish.  The wine that was paired with this was a chardonnay that was very fruit-driven and not buttery.  My roommate's white wine that went with her Winter Uttapam had no flavor.  I thought she was crazy at first, but I tried it.  And it really did have no flavor.  It was the weirdest tasting wine I've ever had.\n\nI got the paneer and almond kofta for the third course.  The dish consisted of two veggie meatballs made up of parsnip, butternut squash, and potato buried in a curry sauce with coconut rice on the side.  The meatballs were drowning in the curry sauce.  I think it would've been better if it was just poured on top.  It seemed like a lot was wasted when I was finished.  The coconut rice was aromatic and softened the spiciness of the curry.  A red wine was paired with this dish.\n\nAnd for dessert, I ordered the banana almond date cake, that was paired with a sherry dessert wine.  It was okay.  The cake itself didn't have a lot of flavor.  It relied on the banana and the spiced cashews for it.  But I think it was that way because it was paired with the sherry, which was very sweet and strong.  I actually preferred the kumquat fruit tart that my friend ordered.\n\nOh, and the waiter was very nice on giving us extra papadums.  They were delicious!!\n\nWould I go back and pay full price?  Yes, but only for special occasions for dinner, or lunch.  The d\u00e9cor merits a fancier dress code, and the dinner prices reflect that.  There's a casual South Indian restaurant I go to in the Mission where you get more bang for your buck. But Dosa is definitely worth trying if you need to impress anyone.", "author": "Vira P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-10", "description": "Let me first say that between the Fillmore and Valencia locations, I've visited Dosa at least 5 times. The food and the venue keeps me coming back. But last night I had my worst experience at the Fillmore location, so much so that I'll probably won't be returning for a while. I made a reservation for 2 at 9:15 pm on a Saturday night. It was really easy to get a reservation through yelp, and I specifically chose the Fillmore location because I know there are more seats available. We arrived maybe 10 minutes early, and were seated close to the time of our reservation, to be expected. \n\nOur table was on the second level, which initially seemed nice because it's a more intimate seating arrangement. There were about 7 other parties being serviced. We reviewed the menu that the hostess gave us for about 20 minutes before any other staff approached us. When we were finally offered drinks, we were already ready to order our entire meal. \n\nOur order was: \nGin & Tonic\nGinger Ante cocktail\nSpicy Basil Dosa\nChennai Chicken\nChanna Bhatura\n\n\nIt was ordered to be all eaten together and shared family style. Within about 5 minutes of ordering, the Chennai Chicken was served to us which was very fast! We waited a few minutes before trying it, assuming that the rest of the food would be arriving soon. None of the other food came immediately after so we decided to just dig in. By this time, we weren't served any water, or papadum which is typically served as an appetizer. We decided to wait for the rest of the food, as the chicken was spicy and would have complimented our other dishes. Water was finally served maybe 10 minutes after the Chennai Chicken and our cocktails shortly after.\n\nIt took literally 45 - 50 minutes to get the next dish, Channa Bhatura. The server actually mentioned that it was confusing on which table the food was to be served. During that time, the waiter not once came to check on us! Not one time. We had finished our waters, and cocktails long before our second dish arrived. We even had to call the waiter over to ask when our food would be coming. The table next to us seemed to be experiencing similar service. At one point a waiter asked if they were finished, since they had been sitting there a while with empty plates. But it turned out they hadn't received one of their dishes as well!\n\nAnother 5-10 minutes after our second dish was served, the table next to us finally got their last dish, along with our last dish! They told the server that the dosa dish was not theirs, and we had to flag him down before he left with our dish! To top it all off, our last dish \"spicy\" basil dosa was the least spicy of the 3. We discovered that it actually was the Potato Dosa dish, not even what we ordered. \n\nHuge fail of a dinner service. We were seated at 9:11pm and left close to 11pm. All the food was delicious, even the wrong dish, but the service and time management in the kitchen was just awful.", "author": "Lauren L."}

Poopy poops.\n\nSadly, my body and muffin top just doesn't agree with the bold and fiery spices.\n\nKnowing that we were going to Dosa, I came armored with my pink bff. You know how it is, the older you get, the more you become a walking CVS. Lactaid, tums, pepto, beano, aleve, benadryl, dramamine, emergen-c, etc. I even have preparation h. Puffy eyes, begone!\n\nHaving been to Dosa on Valencia, I already knew what to expect: trendy and full bar. Of course, the latter being the most important. This Dosa location is massive with two levels making it a perfect place for dates and/or large parties. \n\nI'm no South Indian food aficionado so I can't speak for the authenticity but I will say, I didn't have the sweats or skid marks during/after (like I usually do from the spices). Not to say, the food was bland because it wasn't, it was flavorful without assaulting the tastebuds with spices and heat. It's pricey though for Indian food (we spent $80 pp including one cocktail) but the quality is top-notch with service to match.\n\nDo start dinner with one of their unique, Indian inspired cocktails. Kinda pricey at $13 a pop but where in the hell will you find a cocktail with housemade hibiscus masala necter, coconut milk and birds eye chile? Um, no where. The creamy Peony (gin based) cocktail was damn delicious and stiff: http://bit.ly/1BKakyU so I recommend this one. \n\nOur group of 8 decided to order several apps to share and then go with the 3-course tasting menu for $42 (yah we eat a lot). This definitely the way to go as the average price of entrees was $26. They don't skimp on the portions either; the girls left with doggybags. \n\nFor our shared apps, we ordered the Bhatura ($5), a gigantic fried puffy wheat bread: http://bit.ly/1to5x2j and the White Truffle Masala Dosa ($13.50): http://bit.ly/1q12snB. Both are must trys! The Bhatura was crispy, soft, and airy; great for dipping with the chutneys. Not authentic by any means, the White Truffle Masala Dosa was filled with mash potatoes: http://bit.ly/1muFQqP and had a great earthy flavor.\n\nFor the tasting menu, I started with the Kale Pakora: http://bit.ly/XFmlGt which is kale dipped in a chickpea batter and then deep fried. It was a little too heavy for me so I shared it with our group.\n\nFor my second course, I choose the Lamb Keema Dosa: http://bit.ly/1l0NhKY. I really enjoyed this course; kinda like a deconstructed crepe. The paper thin dosa was super light and crunchy. Tear off a piece, top it with the ground lamb, and enjoy. The tomato chutney added heat while the green coconut chutney helped cool things down. \n\nHaving had the Prawn Masala at their Valencia location, I knew this was going to be my third course. It was as delicious as I remembered it. The four large prawns were meaty and sweet. Loved the delightfully creamy masala sauce that was robust and spicy but not overly so. They made for great leftovers since the spices developed more overnight. \n\nThe Indian fusion desserts looked too enticing to pass up so we ordered the White Chocolate & Turmeric Pot de Cr\u00e8me ($9): http://bit.ly/1l0QiLo and the Fresh Coconut Custard Cake w/ infused curry leaves & coconut cookie ($8): http://bit.ly/1tsqJ6o to share. I can't comment on the pot de cr\u00e8me since someone hoarded the entire thing to himself. Hmmph. The coconut custard cake had a flan like texture. It had good coconut flavor but I wish the bottom crust was crunchier. \n\nService was phenomenal (so rounding up my rating). Our super sweet waitress, Ilem and the busboys rocked! Usually with large parties, service sucks donkey balls. However, not at Dosa. They were very attentive, quickly cleared out empty plates, kept our water glasses filled, and food came out very timely. When it came to packing our leftovers, they put the rice, masala and raita in different containers. The ocd in me thanks you!\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Dosa is a very trendy place. The upscale d\u00e9cor is stunning and the amber and red color scheme is inviting. If you want to impress a girl (or guy) with something l-o-n-g, this is THE place to bring her.

I went to dosa Friday night and thought of visiting again since I had a friend in town craving some Indian food. \n\nWe got seated on our table and got our menus and then for about 10 minutes our server didn't even stop by to see if we had questions on the menu. The server seemed new since I am quite regular here and I hadn't seen him before. \n\nThen he came to get our table to get our order and I ordered 4 items. He didn't note anything down and just went away. \n\nI ordered: \n- Idli Sambar: Good idli, good sambar. Overall solid dish. 9/10\n- Rava Masala: Very crispy. Perfect texture. 9/10\n- Chole Bhature: This was the weakest dish. The chole lacked flavor, lack of salt and was slightly sweet. Meh. 2/10 \n- Paneer and peas uttapam: We waited for this for about 15 minutes and it never showed up. When I told the waiter that we've been waiting for a while and we still haven't finished it, he repeated saying \"oh paneer and peas dosa\"? I'm pretty sure at this point he hasn't put in an order for it, so I asked him to just cancel it since we didn't want to wait more. He just walks away and doesn't even apologize. \n\nThen he just comes back with the check and asks us if we want desert after he has put the check on the table. We ordered the Rasmalai which is my fave and was good as always and the chai too. \n\nHe comes back with the updated check. No asking if we are ready for the check, no checking in on how the food is. \n\n3 stars only for the food and because I have been here in the past and sat at the bar and had a great experience. \n\nThis was my second time at a table at Dosa fillmore with a bad service experience. However, the last time the manager noticed it and fixed the situation for us. She was great! I was hoping I'd get a chance to see her today and give her my feedback in person. \n\nDosa I love you.

The food is AMAZING and the people who run this restaurant are kind, funny, and just a pleasure to be around. \n\nI always order the samosas. Trust me. They are so yummy and crunch with the sweet sauce and then this chutney sauce. It's my absolute favorite dish on the whole menu. Comes in four, and is perfect to share with another person. \n\nAlso delicious is the mango lassi. I've never tried mango lassi until this place. It's almost like a smoothie, but with a yogurt consistency to it. I would get the sweet one. It's divine!!!\n\nThe lamb dosa and chicken curry were also really savory. My weak tastebuds thought they were too spicy, but if you're a normal Asian person, you'll be able to handle it. A dosa is like a flat crepe that isn't sweet. Just look at all the pictures. You dip it in a bunch of sauces and meats. Yummmmm.\n\nIf you still have room for dessert, try the pistachio cake with chocolate, pistachio, and coconut. It's a tiny piece, but really the right amount to end a really satisfying meal.\n\nMy favorite bartenders are Bret and Jesse (the guy who Seth Rogen looks likes). Even though it's crazy busy at the bar, they always manage to talk to us. I ask them for the best places to visit in SF for food and they're always more than happy to share. Rocky, the floor manager I believe, makes really pretty drinks. There are a lot of non alcoholic drinks, and he he uses spices, herbs, and flowers to decorate them. He regaled us with how he likes to run 12 miles a day, but won't walk anywhere. Annie, a server who is a Harry Potter fan like me, is really sweet. Lastly, there is a new chef from New York, I believe his name is Aroun. Everyone was still getting to know him, so I might have gotten it wrong. He's the one who specially made the samosas for me. You're so awesome!!! Got to chat a bit with him about how NY was so different from SF. He thinks it so relaxing in SF........I need to go to NY. =)\n\nThank you for making every experience at DOSA a fun and tasty one! I'll be back in that corner soon!", "author": "Vivian X."}

Their gin and tonic is one of my favorites since the first one I had with good ice cubes some years back. AT $12 I thought it was pricey. Now, the choppy ice they use isn't as good, and it's $14, plus $1 for tax and $1.5 for tip. That's $16.50 for one gin and tonic! It would take some 200,000 million people in India who make $2 per day one damn week hard labor to pay for this luxury-- and you need two to get any kind of worthy buzz. For God's sake! The papadum was soggy stale last time I was there paying $16.50 per drink-- but it was \"free\" I can't really complain. And I've noticed some of the apps like the squid just don't taste as good anymore. The dosa are still great, especially the truffle. But as this type of food costs a buck or two in India, I'm becoming increasingly adverse to this place.

We discussed various dishes with our server and ended up ordering the following:\n\n-Chennai chicken ($11) - Yum! Crispy, moist and tender! \n-Dahi vada ($10) - I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it was a nice contrast to heavier and spicier dishes. Cool and refreshing. \n-Lamb kofta ($15) - I love lamb! And in meatball form?! How could I say no!\n-Duck vindaloo with side of Lemon rice ($24) - I love duck! But since it's a fatty bird, I found the sauce a little too oily. The lemon rice went great with it though! \n-Uttapam: Mixed chile ($11) - So I ordered a dosa but ended up with a uttapam. If I had realized this at the restaurant, I probably would have said something. But I didn't find out until I got home. I did enjoy this though! Nice and spicy! \n\nGiven that this restaurant is called Dosa, I really wanted to try a dosa! But since I'm not super familiar with Indian food, I didn't know what we got wasn't what I ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-21", "description": "Admittedly, it's possible that I may have a rather unsophisticated palate when it comes to Indian cuisine. Then again, maybe the DOSA menu is just too carb-heavy for my liking. Generally, spicy food is what floats my boat, and DOSA does not disappoint when it comes to spice.  I think DOSA may be especially preferable to those whose proclivities are for South Indian cuisine over North Indian.  This past weekend we had the lamb keema dosa, the cauliflower rice, and the dungeness crab appetizer (e.g. crab in mini puffy-bread balls).  The crab appetizer was a favorite at our table. DOSA excels with crab, as it is amazingly fresh and from right off our very own Pacific coast. That said, whenever I've dined at either of their two restaurants, I've  always left with a craving for salad. The menu is just too carb loaded and lacking in vegetables and greens. To be fair, I've given DOSA the ole college try-- having dined twice at the Valencia location and twice at the Fillmore location.  After trying various Indian restaurants throughout the Bay Area, I realize now that I prefer more  traditional Northern Indian food than Southern Indian food.  In short, I'm more an Amber India gal, than a DOSA gal. Also, we've experienced weird seating allocation situations at the Fillmore St. locale. On my first visit, we were a party of 10 and the bill was $900.00. That's to be expected in this town...but the real shocker came when management asked us to hurry up because they really 'needed' to flip our table to the next party.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "An upscale South Indian restaurant best describes Dosa on Fillmore (and probably Dosa on Valencia).  I've eating my fair share of South Indian cuisines in San Jose and Brick Lane London so I can say I'm somewhat familiar with the spices and tastes of said cuisines.  Now, most South indian dishes are vegetarian and full of carbs so prepare yourself before you eat.  For example, masala dosa is one of the popular dishes which consists of a somewhat paper thin crepe rolled up with lentils inside the middle.  The lentils would qualify as protein since it has some amounts of it.  Samosas are basically smaller rolled up dosas with a lot of filling inside.  Well, I would describe them as hot pockets.\n\nBesides dosas, there's uttapam which is basically the same batter as the dosas but in pancake form.  I ordered the mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam and the South Indian moons where the chef chooses five mini ones to make.  I was a little disappointed where one of the five was the mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam.  Either the chef should have changed it up or the waitress should have warned me before I ordered it.\n\nIf you're looking for non-vegetarian and possibly less carbs, try the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani.  It can best be described as chicken fried rice but with a lot more spices.  I thought the chicken was pretty good where it was moist and the spices drew out the flavor in the chicken.  Have a sweet mango lassi to wash it down.  Lassi are basically yogurt drinks and they come in Mango, Sweet, or Salty.  Stick with mango unless you really like yogurt but in a drinkable form.\n\n- South Indian Moons (5 uttapams chef's selection)\n- Masala Dosa\n- Veggie Samosas\n- Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani\n- Mixed mushroom and truffle oil uttapam\n- Sweet Mango Lassi", "author": "Ronald L."}

I was extremely disappointed from start to finish at DOSA. \n1. My party and I made it on time for the reservation but had to wait a good thirty minutes to be seated. If I am taking the time to make a reservation a few days in advance and make it on time you better believe I expect to be seated as soon as my party arrives.  \n2. I'm shocked to see how much someone can charge fore mediocre food and service. Being a South Indian myself this food was not worth the price and the trip at all. Ironically the meat dishes had more flavor than the rest. Let's just say the dosas were not the star of the show. \n3. The highlight of my night was when the check arrived and I noticed a charge for serving cake per person. This was my sisters birthday and so a bought a few cupcakes for the party and made sure I called ahead of time to find out if that was alright with the restaurant and was reassured if I served the cake myself I would not be charged per person. This being the case I was approached by the manager who came to clarify things with a very rude tone. He insisted he spoke to the person I spoke to and she said otherwise, fine by me but i am not one to make up something I wasn't told. Anyway the point is not the money but the attitude of the manager! Absolutely no etiquette. He spoke rudely to me in front of my guests at the table was extremely insistent on the charge. I didn't want to cause a scene so I paid the extra amount. \n\nAll in all I would never return. The service, food and management has to be worked on. I have not left a restaurant feeling more angry than happy and this will be the first. To all my South Indian mates seek out a better South Indian restaurant where you don't pay an arm and a leg for \"white washed Indian food\"", "author": "D A."}

We arrived on time and were told by the hostess our table would be ready shortly.  The Fillmore Street Jazz Festival was taking place at the time so the street outside the restaurant was crowded and very loud, there was also a constant cold breeze coming straight in to the only waiting area provided.  We asked if the front door could be closed because of the noise and temperature and they're response was \"No. We cannot close the door.\" with no apology or further explanation.  \n\nWe were seated at our table at 1:50PM.  Our server arrived and only mentioned that she would be bringing waters soon.  There was no explanation of the menu, which at Dosa I think is helpful for most guests.  There was no offer to take drink or food orders.  We were able to order approximately 20 minutes after being seated.  The one saving grace is that when the food came out it was delicious.  However, the next time we saw our waitress was after most of our party was finished eating when she came by to check that the order came out correctly.  That's contact that should be made with the table shortly after the food arrives, not when everyone is done eating.  It took another 20 minutes after we had all finished our food for the offer of dessert and for the check to arrive.  We had cards out, on the table, ready to pay because at this point we were clearly ready to leave, but still had to wait another 10 minutes before a different server  picked up our check to be processed.  No wonder it took them 20 minutes to seat our reservation, they have no clue how to move tables efficiently in and out of their restaurant.  \n\nOther frustrating things that came up;  At 2:15PM they started playing very loud music (possibly to block out the loud music they were letting in through their open door).  My $3.50 small cup of coffee was never refilled.  One entree came out 5 minutes before everyone else's did. \n\nThis is our fourth time at Dosa.  The previous times were great, which is why we kept coming back.  I've worked in the restaurant business and I am pretty understanding when it comes to service, but this was too much.  Essentially every step of the way they managed to provide terrible service and never apologize for it.  The cherry on top was watching the manager stand at the host stand for the entire 100 minutes we were in his restaurant.  He never walked the dining room floor, never checked in on tables, and never offered assistance or guidance to his staff who clearly could have used it.  The food was great, but not great enough to make me overlook how atrocious the management of this restaurant was.  Sorry Dosa, we had some good times, but this is the end for us.  \n\n\nTLDR\n\nPros: Great food\n\nCons: Everything else", "author": "Cameron S."}

I don't know how I've made it this far into my love affair with food of all kinds -- including PLENTY o' Indian cuisine -- without knowing that these amazing, giganto, flavor-filled crepes even existed!\n\nThe illustrious Tiffany N. took us baby CMs under her wing while in Frisco, and by gum, if this lady doesn't know her stuff. Dosa on Fillmore is a real treasure. Not only is it a beautiful space, especially if you seated up on the balcony portion we did, but everyone from the hostess staff to the busboys were friendly, accommodating, and offered their advice and suggestions without hesitation. Since I don't know of a place in Northern VA that serves dosas (yet! I'm making it my mission to find one!), obviously that was what must-order for me. But before we got to that, as a table we shared some appetizers that are making my mouth water all over again just thinking about them!\n\nThe North & South Samosa dish was a fabulous way to highlight the difference between the two types of Indian cuisine. I'm actually not really sure which was which (bad Gretchen...) but one was your traditional potato samosa, and the other was more like a triangular spring roll, flatter and crispier with vegetables inside. Both were equally delicious, especially with my favorite tamarind sauce all up in thurr.\n\nThe lamb meatballs and a chicken appetizer dish that I can't remember the name of were also incredibly delicious. The meatballs are pretty spicy, so be forewarned, and the chicken had a good zip to it as well, but came with a yogurt sauce that cooled everything down to  be nice and mellow. Mm-mmm.\n\nOkay, so onto the main event: the dosa! I got the paneer & peas dosa, which actually doesn't come in a single bigger-than-your-head shaped monstrosity but is broken up into three deceptively proportioned looking crepes. I say deceptive, however, because it was still an incredible amount of food! Melty cheese, smashed and  whole peas, all wrapped up in a fluffy crepe... I'm sure it's no stretch for you to imagine exactly how delicious the entire thing was! I appreciated our waitress's tip to dip into all three sauces at once. It was like a flavor 'splosion in my mouth!\n\nI also got a chance to steal from--I mean, share with--my neighbors, so I tried the roasted garlic dosa as well as the crispy paper dosa. Both were, again, delicious, and I really liked the traditional masala potatoes that came inside the paper.

I'd actually give this place a 4.5 star rating if that was an option. Here's the rundown...\n\nAmbiance:\nHas romantic vibes with dim lighting. There is a bar on the right side when you walk in with some high table seating. Otherwise, most of the seating is normal table setups with dark wood furnishings. The chandeliers were also very pretty. \n\nService:\nOur server was friendly and offered great descriptions of the food options. He gave his favorite dishes and was upfront about how much food would be good for the both of us. No pressure to order alcohol or dessert. He along with the bus boys were attentive to check in on us and keep our drinks refilled. One slight knock would be that the food took a bit longer to come out than what we'd consider normal. \n\nFood:\nEvery dish was delicious. We started with the Vada Pav, which are tasty vegetarian sliders made with a potato based patty. We then shared the White Truffle Masala Dosa and the Chicken Dum Korma. Both were great, but if I had to choose one to have again it would be the Chicken Dum Korma. The curry reminded me of Tikka Masala but with a lighter flavor. The dark meat chicken was so tender and juicy with flavor. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWe'd definitely eat here again when in the mood for Indian cuisine. I'd be curious to try the other Dosa options on the menu. One thing to note is if you want a soft drink, they are served in bottles so there are not free refills.", "author": "Michael S."}

That said, keep a copy of the regular menu too so you can read the descriptions b/c the other menu doesn't describe the dishes. \nMy friend & I started with the chutney appetizer and the shredded duck. Both were delicious!  The chutney is served with pappadum so it a great gluten free choice. The duck is spicy and greatly tasty. We got the raita to go with it. Then we got chicken korma and a side of lemon rice, great choice and perfect side. Finally we got our dosas. I'd never had one and was surprised when it arrived. I loved them!  They were rolled up one was stuffed with potatoes & white truffles the other was plain and you dipped it in a nice lamb dish. \nI'll be back to try more menu items.", "author": "Heather S."}

Some girlfriends convinced me that it really was the best south Indian food in the city and that it was absolutely worth a visit - so we made a reservation for around 9:30 pm with no issues on a Monday night. First of all, I wasn't expecting how beautiful the restaurant was! Way nicer than any of the south Indian restaurants I've frequented to in the bay. Anyways, on to the food. I'm north Indian and I've always been a huge fan of only North Indian food. My parents however LOVE South Indian food, so it's their mission in life to take us to as many South Indian restaurants as they can to convert us. Never really worked, but I'm willing to bet that if they took me to DOSA, I'd consider eating more South Indian food. \n\nStarters: Vada pav (aka vegetarian sliders) - think of the fluffiest, most delicious hamburger buns you've ever had and multiply by 100. The bread was to die for and I would eat just that over and over again. The bun was stuffed inside with a potato type patty, and the dish came with oil and a powder of some sort (I wish I knew what this was). Basically the concept was to mix the oil and powder to make a sort of flavored, spicy sauce. We each had one but I wish we had more - they were amazing! I'd come back just to grab these. \n\nChutney platter: In most South Indian restaurants, or north even, you don't pay for chutneys. They're complimentary, almost like ketchup or hot sauce. DOSA, being fancy-smancy and all charges you for sides of chutney so we got the chutney platter, to see what the buzz what all about. The chutney platter came with 4 chutneys (spicy, sweet, coriander and one more that was a little bland so I can't place it) and pappad (think crispy, thin chips).  Overall, a good appetizer but probably wouldn't pay $5 for it again (call me cheap, oops). \n\nFood: My friend and I spoiled our dinners because we couldn't wait until 9pm so we ended up splitting the spicy basil dosa. This was delicious! The spicy flavors with the basil worked amazingly and were definitely different than usual dosas I've tasted. I also enjoyed the potato stuffing that was inside - it tasted fresh and rich, and paired with the chutney/sambar, everything came together amazingly. One thing I loved about all components of the dosa was the quality of the ingredients - everything truly tasted fresh and not like it had been lying around and made in bulk (like I feel when I eat at some dosa eateries). The only thing that did not impress me was the sambar - that did not taste as fresh or as flavorful as I hoped (I wish it was spicier). However, still not a bad sambar and given how amazing everything else was, it wasn't a game changer. \n\nDrinks: I wish we had not drank earlier or we would've indulged in some of their amazing cocktail options...Mango is the new black!? Definitely will have to come back to try some of these drinks! \n\nVerdict: Definitely try this place out! You'll be surprised at how beautiful the restaurant is and if you're like me, and don't like South Indian food much, you just might have to make an exception.", "author": "Anu P."}

Definitely worth a revisit next time I'm in town. \n\nDosa does upscale Indian right. The food is great, the environment classy, drinks excellent, and yet you don't feel completely robbed after paying the check. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with the tasting menu, a three course meal for $35. Add on the wine pairing for just $18 more and you will be served pours that are practically full-size and perfectly complementary to your courses. \n\nI'm a little hazy on the details of each dish I had but I know the samosa I started with blew away the samosa I had during my lunch at another restaurant earlier in the day. The second course is a choice between some uttapam and dosa variations; I had never tried either before but the the dosa I ended up ordering was absolutely delicious. The lentil dipping soup served alongside was the perfect accompaniment. The whole thing reminded me of an Indian version of an American favorite: grilled cheese and tomato soup. My third course was some sort of spicy boneless chicken which was also very nice. \n\nJust thinking about this dinner makes me smile because I was also in great company.

We were seated even before our entire party arrived. \n\nDosas are delish here! I'm used to eating sweet crepes for more of a dessert-like snack, but Dosa on Fillmore proved that I can happily enjoy a savory crepe for a dinner entree as well. This was my first time trying dosa of any type (I should really expand beyond curries and naan for Indian fare) and I was very pleased. \n\n{food}\n\nFor a seasonal fall flavor, I say go with the PUMPKIN MASALA DOSA. The pumpkin masala with ginger and cinnamon created a really unique taste that you don't usually get with Indian food. Even my Indian friends were intrigued and impressed with my dish. I like how it came with an extra side of pumpkin chutney along with the sambar (lentil soup) and tomato and coconut chutneys. With the Bay Area weather turning a bit crisp and chilly outside, the spicy soup and warm dosa made for a very satisfying dinner. And the description of the portion as \"the size of a large plate\" is a bit of an understatement...I am pretty sure the dosa was the size of my face. \n\nThe UTTAPAMS were also yummy and a couple of my friends chose the SOUTH INDIAN MOONS to get a selection of five different flavors to try. The texture was similar to potato latkes. I personally prefer the thinner, crepe-like consistency of the dosas. \n\n{drinks}\n\nAll the SPICE ROUTE COCKTAILS are pretty tasty. They are on the smaller side but they pack a nice punch. I've been in a tequila and spicy cocktail kick recently and went with the HIDEAWAY (the tequila, ginger, spiced agave, and birds eye chile caught my eye). I am still a fan of sweeter cocktails and also enjoyed my friend's MANGO IS THE NEW BLACK (rye whisky and spiced mango nectar made a great combo). \n\n{dessert}\n\nI loved the soft vermicelli noodles and beets swimming in condensed milk in the PAYASAM & RED BEET HALAWA. It was a light dessert and reminded me of sweet dessert soups you find in Chinese restaurants. The RASMALAI was also a light dessert with cheese in a cream sauce flavored with spices and rose water.

Over priced, no flavor, served luke warm~one chicken was burnt and chewy~ definitely it didn't have any dum in it! Scallops looked way too skinny  and the sauce simply felt like uncooked tikka masala! The worst part was when I ordered whole wheat paratha and turned out to be one of those store bought frozen parathas that I used to enjoy during my college days! I made sure  with my server if it was whole wheat and she said it was!!They should definitely try to serve fresh parathas. \nWill be back to try some more dosas since they tend to specialize only on dosas!", "author": "N B."}

The delicious bowl of sambar is super flavorful and the two idli's peek out at you, ready to be devoured. Warms you up and excites you for more food. I loved the \"thuriya\" green beans in there that pop into four you eat the insides of. Reminded me of the noms my mom used to make.\n\nI decided (after much contemplation) on the roasted chile and garlic masala dosa and boy was that a great choice. I love garlic, I love heat, and I love complex flavor. This dish had all of that. I nominate this star of the show.\n\nOther honorable mentions:\n\nQuinoa \"thinnai\" uttapam\nRaita\n(double- you will eat all of it) chutneys\nMasala dosa\n\nThe potatoes and cashews were on point, authentic, SPICY, and delicious. \n\nTowards the end of our meal, the guy taking our plates spilled chutney all overrrr one of the jackets on the chair.

The moong masala dosa however was very good, loved the potato filling and the side chutneys and sambhar. \n\nService is good and quick. My advice would be to go for the non spicy dishes.

Even having visited South India, South Indian food is a bit foreign compared to the traditional North Indian curries that we are all used to. I decided to give this place a shot this past weekend for brunch.\n\nTHE DRINKS: I tried one of their \"spice\" cocktails and my boyfriend had their version of a bloody mary. Neither of us were particularly happy with our drinks. I applaud Dosa for trying to do something different with their cocktails but they went too heavy on the spices. I should have just stuck with a normal mimosa. They don't offer any unlimited mimosa option which is disappointing.\n\nTHE FOOD: We started with the idli sambar (veggie version) and poori. Both were excellent! The poori reminded me of a Mexico sopaipilla and I dipped it in the idli. Then we both got uttapams - my boyfriend an egg one and me a mushroom one. The bf felt that the uttampam masked the taste of the eggs a bit too much. I was a big fan of my mushroom one though - I'm vegan and they were able to modify. Both came with an interesting mix of sauces.\n\nThis place is also super vegan, vegetarian, and allergy friendly which is great.\n\nPrices are definitely a bit high but service is good and I would definitely come back.

Great three course meal with wine pairings - I'd recommend trying it out during Restaurant Week (f.k.a. \"Dine About Town\") if you have yet to try out this restaurant.  Our second time was shortly after that - we had been blown away by the quality of the food the first time, so my husband and I booked a date night at the location on Fillmore.  Once again, AMAZING experience.  This past time we went with another couple.  I think this was my favorite experience thus far, as we opted to do family style and ended up being able to try several different dishes.  \n\nHere's the items we tried:\n\nShredded Duck (5 stars) - spiciest of the dishes we tried (which I loved, as I'm a fan of spicy foods); the flavors were so well balanced and complex, pairs perfectly with the sauces (which helped tame down the spice).\n\nFresh Seafood Vada (4.5 stars) - so fresh and light, with a great kick of spice.  \n\nChutney Sampler (4 stars) - All of the sauces were spectacular and full of flavor, with a range of spiciness.  All of them were great.\n\nSweet Potato Dosa (4.5 stars) - This was my favorite dosa of the evening.  The sweet potatoes were so soft and creamy, and I loved the ginger flavor.\n\nSpicy Basil Dosa (3.5 stars) - This was in my opinion not as good as the sweet potato dosa.   Still good, just didn't have the same creaminess, and I preferred the flavor profile of the other dosa better.  Wish we would have gotten the white truffle dosa instead of this one, as we've had that before and it's fantastic.\n\nTamil Lamb (4.5 stars) - Such an excellent dish.  Once again, great flavors/spices, and the lamb was oh so tender.\n\nPrawn Masala (5 stars) - The best dish of the night.  The coconut sauce was to die for, and the prawns were perfectly cooked.  And the coconut rice that came with it was excellent - went back for thirds on this dish ;)\n\nMy personal favorites were the shredded duck starter and the prawn masala.  But honestly, every single dish was fantastic.  \n\nA must go if you haven't been.  Can't wait to try out the DOSA on Valencia, which is a short walk from where I live.

Their salads are good, too. I've enjoyed several and have never been disappointed. I *love* the keema dosa, but the potato-based fillings are excellent, too. Even better, everything is so reasonably priced (between $12 and $15 per dosa or uttapam; it's between $20 and $32 for the entrees, which I've never felt the need to order because the dosas are so darn good!). \n\nEach time I've been, my servers have been friendly and knowledgeable. I've also had some stellar drinks from the bar (an excellent sidecar and some very good wine). Add easy parking at the Kabuki to the mix (which is harder at their Valencia location despite that parking garage on 21st), and this is just a winning space. I will be back--many, many times.", "author": "Lis B."}

Whoever came up with the business idea to bring the staple southern Indian fare to such a trendy spot is just pure ingenious. DOSA is truly one of a kind in the city (not counting its sister restaurant Dosa on Valencia of course).\n\nThe restaurant is huge. There is a spacious bar, communal tables, lounging area as well as plenty of tables in two floors. Even then, the restaurant is a complete full house on the weekends. Reservation is not too too difficult to come by. Just need to call a few days in advance. Walk in or same day reservation might be possible but do not count on it. You don't want to wait for 45 minutes do you?\n\nThe food was good. Very authentic in taste with much welcomed Californian twist featuring many locally sourced, farm fresh or organic ingredients. I can't say it was the best Southern Indian food I have had in the area. I could still name a handful of restaurants that would beat them in taste and price. However, none of those restaurants match this level of service and quality. You are paying extra for the service, excellent wine list and a nice ambiance. Let me tell you, it is totally worth it. \n\nThe tasting menu is great for first timers. The portion is adjusted smaller so you get to try more things. Otherwise, just one order of their dosa could easily fill you up.\n\nI love the energetic ambiance but the tables were a little too close together for comfort. It is a fun place to bring your date to but not a place you could enjoy a more intimate and private conversation.", "author": "Mona W."}

My girlfriend is South Indian and so with pretty high standards to begin with, this place met all expectations and then some. We ordered the Paneer and Peas Dosa which was amazing. The quantity and presentation of the food itself is something to be spoken for. We also ordered the Lamb Keema dosa which was subpar but and may have been better if it wasn't served on the side of the paper dosa. \n\nAlong with the main entree, we had three appetizers: the Chennai Chicken, Dahi Vada, and Idli Fries. All three tasted great, but we especially enjoyed the Idli Fries because of its unique texture and twist on typical finger food.

We had many dishes that were vegetarian since many on our team don't eat meat. We started off with complimentary chips that came with 4 sauces - my favorite was the green one that had a kick to it. The samosas were delicious with the green sauce! Since everything was pre-ordered before I got there, I am unable to share the name of each dish, but I have photos that are attached! The second appetizer was almost like fries, but it was a fried vegetable (couldn't make out what it is) with chili powder all over making it quite spicy and crunchy. We started our course with pancakes that were all vegetarian - 5 pieces with each a different ingredient: mushroom, tomato, etc. I dove into the soup that came with the dishes which had a kick to it but it was sooooo good! Probably my favorite dish next to the chicken curry with naan! There was also a crepe that had lamb or pumpkin in it, but I didn't try the lamb and thought the pumpkin tasted a bit bland, but sauces and that bomb soup came with it so it made everything alllll better! The meal was delicious and very authentic with prompt service! Definitely worth a visit!", "author": "Amanda C."}

Every single dish was delicious, aesthetically pleasing, and served hot. From a flavors/textures/yum factor, this place is WAY up there.\n\nBut the service... God... the service...\n\nNow understandably, it was a challenging day. There was a Ramen Festival about 10 feet away from their front door and as a result, the street was closed off, there were people outside everywhere. We get that. Also, because of said event, traffic was nightmarish. It cost me almost $20 in an Uber to go 1.8 miles to Dosa today, a drive that would normally be about five bucks. And we hopped out and walked the last block, because that last block would have taken us another ten minutes in the car. Fair enough.\n\nBut our party of eleven trickled in as best we could under said circumstances, as people were helplessly stuck in gridlock and/or desperately seeking parking. Like everyone else at the restaurant, we were doing the best we could to get there and get seated.\n\nAnd the restaurant just wouldn't quit bugging us about when our party would arrive. Now, we had 8 people there out of a party of eleven. Food was being ordered. Cocktails were being ordered. We weren't only NOT squatting, but we were still a large party ordering a lot of food and spending a lot of cash.\n\nBut part of the reason lunch took so long, and actually the part more responsible for the delay than our transportation issues, was that EVERY time we wanted to order more of something, or someone new arrived and had to order, it took FOREVER. Half of our orders had to be placed again, 15 minutes later, on three separate occasions because someone on the staff dropped the ball. Reminders were not handled gracefully. Coffee was never refilled, until the third time asking. A few times we (very politely) asked the staff to take new orders, were told to wait, and never returned to.\n\nDelicious food, good location, reasonable prices, and beautiful aesthetic. But why didn't anyone bother to train the waitstaff to wait tables?", "author": "Sean B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "I have been dying to come here since moving to the area.  I booked a reservation for Valentines Day a couple weeks ahead of time.  When we arrived we were seated right away, even at 6pm this place was PACKED.  The bar area is large and on a non-holiday would probably have plenty of seats.  \n\nThey were doing a tasting menu that night for 58$ a person, but I already had a bunch of plates I wanted to try and not many were on the tasting menu.  To start out I had the gin & tonic- it was delicious!  I forget what was in the tonic but it was homemade and totally delicious!  The cocktails are expensive, I felt like the gin & tonic was worth the 12$ but looking around some of the other cocktails were super small and would have been a little disappointing.  They also had a lot of wines and the selection was pretty good.  \n\nWe ordered a ton of food:\n\nLamb Sliders- 5 stars!  This was the best dish of them all.  I wasn't really wanting to order them but then decided at the last minute.  IT came with 2 sliders and then a ghee (butter) and spices which you mix together to make a paste.  We dipped our sliders in the paste- OH MY GOSH!  So Amazing!  THe bread was delicious and fresh and the lamb was so tender and perfectly cooked.  WE both seriously considered ordering several more of these!\n\nDuck Flatbread- Duck vindaloo on top of uttapum...very delicious but small portion.  Not really flatbread more of like half an English muffin size.  The flavor was good and perfectly spiced.\n\nTruffle masala Dosa- I was really excited about this dish.  The different sauces were SOOOO good.  I also like the Dosa, it is HUGE!  I could smell the truffles as soon as they sat it down! I loved pulling it a part and making combinations of sauces, so delicious!\n\nVegetarian Meatballs- I forget what this dish was actually called but it was panneer,squash, and almond \"meatballs\" in a creamy korma type sauce.  I ordered in with coconut rice.  I loved it!  It definitely had some spice- I would say I am medium wimp about spice and none of these dishes were uncomfortable to me.  We got a side of fry bread and it was the perfect combination.\n\nLamb dish- Again I forget the name, but it was the lamb dish (NOT the lamb chops).  It was tender lamb pieces in a dark vindaloo sauce.  We ordered it with the lemon rice and it was a really unique combination.  The lamb again was cooked to perfection.  This was probably the spiciest dish of them all but again nothing too awful.\n\nOverall the service, drinks, food, and ambiance all together is a definite 5 stars.  Its pricey for Indian food but when considering the quality of the food you are getting I think the price is justified.  I cannot wait to go back and try more dishes!!", "author": "Kate F."}

We have been to several South Indian restaurants and never had such an oily experience while ordering dosas.\n\nAlso be careful about their billing practices - as for any group over with 4 or more people they will try to get DOUBLE TIP (20% SVC charge added on bill and on the credit card statement will have another column for gratutity). Actually the service charge is same as the gratuity but they are trying to deceive the customer by using different terms so they end up double tipping.", "author": "Reliable R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-06", "description": "First of all, it's a pretty classy place. In most cases, when I'm craving for Indian food, I would prefer a place that is bustling with noise, peoples' chat and so on (I grew up in Bangladesh and I value this sort of lively noise :) ). But if you want to enjoy Indian food in a classy way for a special event, this place does a pretty good job. We were a group of 5 people and thus got to try out many different dishes. For appetizers, I thought Vada Pav was EXCELLENT. It's like a slider with spiced potato patty inside. As you can imagine, the way you make the patty is the most crucial thing here and I felt one can't do better than this! But my only negative feeling was the slider bun was a bit too oily and I felt a little bit of discomfort when I was holding it. But overall I would give A+ on this dish.\nMy friend tried out Idli fries. I tried only one of those. It was descent. I think it should have been spicier inside. I felt it was a bit blunt. \n\nFor the main dish, I had Paneer and Peas Dosa. It was really good. The paneer was crunchy and along with the chutneys, it was marvelous. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Make sure you have this with both the coconut and the tomato chutney together. The samber, that came along with this, was also excellent. It was spicy as it should be and the thickness of the curry was optimal. BTW, when you are having dishes like dosa, upattam, just avoid too much use of silverwares. Indian foods, especially foods of this kind, are meant to be eaten by hand and if you need to concentrate too much on the fork and knife to have these delicate dishes, your mind won't have the time to savor the taste :)\n\nAfter all these, we had the legendary Madras Coffee. I didn't know much about it but my friend, whose family is from South India, commented, \"you judge a South Indian restaurant by it's Madras coffee\". It was my first time having Madras coffee, and being a huge fan of coffee, I must say, this is one of the best kind of coffees I have ever had. So, if you come here GET this coffee. But there is one thing I think Dosa can improve on. They gave the coffee in British style cups and that made the coffee lukewarm. Even though I really liked the coffee, my friend's parents (expert on Madras coffee) and I think it would have tasted MUCH better if it were super hot. They also explained to me that in India, people serve this coffee on metal cups in traditional ways. Given the classy level of this restaurant, I think Dosa should put effort to serve this South Indian signature coffee in more traditional way!\n\nFor dessert, we had Rasmalai, Panna Cotta and House-made Gelato and Sorbet. Bangladesh and India are known for their famous sweet dishes and when I was in Bangladesh, rasmalai was my MOST favorite sweet dish. If you don't try rasmalai in your lifetime, you will regret even after you die and the rasmalai at Dosa was EXCELLENT. The sweet cheese patties were optimally soft, juicy and when you pour that in your mouth, you just feel that juicy cream coming out of the patty. Just close your eyes and fill that moment! \n\nWhile the rasmalai was great, we all felt the panna cotta was terrible mostly due the \"spicy\" taste in it. In India/Bangladesh, all the desserts are known for it's sweetness and adding sambal chili in the panna cotta just ruined it. When you pour it in your mouth, you don't fill the spicy taste first but as you swallow it, the spiciness kicks in the throat and it's just weird and just ruins the dessert mood. The gelato was good but nothing special. It was more like a \"Kulfi\" in Bangladesh/India. But lastly, I would just say that, if you come here and crave for dessert after you meal, just go with the rasmalai. You can never go wrong with it, especially when you are at Dosa.\n\nAs far as the restaurant environment goes, it was pretty nice and relaxing. I really liked the overall design, decoration and lighting of the place. It's also duplex and from top it looks beautiful. My only complaint was some of the camera photographs hanging on the walls. Most of those are pictures of poor, struggling working people in India and even though the pictures represent the true picture of the majority in  the Indian sub-continent, I just felt hanging these pictures in a rich-classy restaurant like this with dazzling lights and bars were insulting to these people who struggle to get two meals a day on in their real life. This just didn't feel right to me.", "author": "Ishfaq H."}

This is an Americanized version of Indian foods, which is why it looks interesting. They have different food options that you would not see at a normal Indian restaurant. They don't have many curry options but they have a wide variety of dosa flavors. The food was very very bland, and the service honestly sucked. When we asked our waited for salt, he looked very confused and brought out a plastic container with salt in it. When asked if the restaurant carries salt shakers, he responded with \"I can't find them right now\"- this is the first restaurant I have ever been to in my life that does not carry salt and pepper shakers. The decor, in my opinion, was super offensive. There were pictures of kids in the streets and close ups of old people who looked sad. What is the point of these pictures??? It was depicting India in a very negative way and people should not photograph poverty for use of decoration. I would not go back to this place and do not recommend to people looking for real and GOOD Indian food because this place sucks.", "author": "Divya K."}

I don't understand the glowing reviews other yelpers are giving this place, nor can I understand the massive crowds it attracts.\nFirst, the waiter. He seemed nice and friendly enough at first but when we said we didn't want alcoholic drinks the service dropped off. We explained that we wanted to go with a tapas style dinner, but when he recommended dishes we didn't like because of the ingredients, didn't give us good advice.  We rarely saw him throughout our time at the restaurant. He didn't check to see if our dishes arrived or if we liked them.  Part of this was because he was waiting on the entire second floor, but he seemed to have time for certain \"favorites\" like the guy next to us.\nNext, the food. We eat Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian food regularly. This was an attempt to modernize and reinvent Indian ingredients in a novel way, but the food did not have the favors billed. Seasoning was heavy handed on the idli fries. A complementary dish of pappadum arrived without any chutneys, for which there is an additional $5 charge.The lemongrass scallops-2- arrived in a sea of Campbell's tomato soup with a few sad arugula leaves and no lemongrass taste. The chef must have been embarrassed because he hid them under a cone of naan.  \nI see that someone else had a similarly bad experience three days ago and her review was dumped. \nThe manager did comp us on the idli fries but never came over to apologize. We had to hustle the waiter to pay our bill. Glad we live where we can get terrific East Asian food.", "author": "Barb L."}

The potato curry and coconut chutney were top notch, whereas the sambar and tomato chutney were not. \nUttappam was served in small portions which looked weird and apparently tasted odd too. \nSpicy basil masala dosa was not as spicy. \nMoong dosa was okay-ish. \n\nFor dessert and later, we had rasmali and masala chai. \nThe chai was pathetic - nowhere close to Indian chai. \nRasmali was super creamy and delicious. \n\nDefinitely worth coming back.", "author": "Stingaph G."}

His marsala dosa came out big and overflowing the plate, and my paneer dosa came small and tightly wrapped.

Save your money and go elsewhere!\n\nI used to come here periodically many years ago and had felt then that there was a service bias toward a certain clientele (read white affluent) that I was not a part of. I love the food and the Dosa's are amazing, but I had stayed away for years because I moved away and I never felt welcomed. I recently came back for a celebration dinner, give them another try, but was disappointed again.\n\nHere comes the rant:\n1) My party arrived shortly after opening and was seated promptly but no waiter or service staff greeted us until a good 10 minutes after being seated. There were around 5 seated tables at the time.\n2) There was not a single moment when a waiter nor service staff offered any of their complementary pappadum's. I had to ask for both plates and padapum's after our family style orders have arrived. I was annoyed that the tables next to us appeared to have been provided padapum's and plates promptly even though they were seated after my party AND was served by the same waiter. Those tables were asked frequently if they wanted refill padapum's. We got zero asks! This has happened before many times. If you don't want to offer them for free, charge for it! Don't eagerly offer it to some tables and not for others!\n3) FRUIT FLY's! Occasional fruit flies were flying here and there. One landed in a alcoholic drink. Yes, this is the Fillmore but come on, the door is not open right? How are you handling waste in the kitchen?\n4) Overall slow service from the start. Things seemed to flow a little better after I flagged someone down about the fruit fly, maybe they wanted to kick us out.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I feel unwanted? Conscious bias? Unconscious bias? Is it because I don't look like I would tip well? The answer is that I could tip well if treated well. I was not treated well, so I tip poorly here.\n\nGoodbye Dosa!

The atmosphere is urban-chic and it's certainly a swank stop for Friday evening drinks with friends or colleagues.  \n\nThe music and ambience was nice and the servers were excellent.  I have had some amazing-to-die-for Indian food in New York City and Washington DC and it seemed like the hype was about the sort of Japantown-chic vibe of San Francisco and the \"different\" Indian food rather than ridiculously amazing food.  \n\nThe food is south Indian, so it has menu items that you don't typically find in most Indian restaurants.  We had a couple different Dosas, uttapam, a chicken curry with coconut rice and a garbanzo dish.  And all of it was certainly tasty.  But I have to say it was quite spicy to the point that you couldn't taste the delicious flavors - one of the people we were with loves uber-spicy food and he was uncomfortably red and sweating and needed to order a Lassi right away! Not really the reaction you want on a Friday evening out!\n\nThe biggest issue I had was the price - it seemed to be quite expensive compared to other Indian restaurants.  As a last note, there were six of us seated at a table, and there was barely enough room for us.  We were squeezed in so tight that it wasn't totally comfortable to hang out for a couple hours.

I love Moscow Mules, so I asked, \"is this the same idea as a Moscow, but rum instead of vodka?\" And with much sas, the response was, \"no, it's completely different.  The ginger ante is based off a dark and stormy.  Dark and stormy was created back in (insert date he said).  So that's what it's like.\" \n\nI responded, \"I never heard of a dark and stormy , but it seems like it's the same ingredients as a Moscow, just with rum?\"\n\n\"No, completely different, as I said, it's like a dark and stormy (still not explaining wtf a dark and Stormy is).  A Moscow Mule was invented later l, in the 1950's in a country we don't mention here (guessing he didn't know where Moscow is), but yes, if you must, I guess it's like a Moscow mule rum instead if you must think of it that way\".  Idk if the history lesson was correct, but at least the drink turned out delicious.\n\nThen it got worse.  My friend asked him to make her a drink - or \"invent a drink\" for her liking.  \n\n\"I'll invent you something off the menu, and you're going to love it. I'm going to make you a Peaony.  My fired noticed the description and saw coconut. \n\n\"I don't like coconut...\"\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to live it, it's out number one drink here.  If you don't like it , I'll make you something else.\"\n\nWell, she didn't like the drink or his attitude.  I thought it tasted good, but then again, I don't mind coconut...\n\nWhen the server came to get ha to seat us, we asked for another drink instead.  I saw the server and bartender speaking.  He was in disbelief. \" tell me she didn't like the Peony\" and threw his hands up in disgust.\n\nThe mood wasn't off to a good start.  The server was awesome, gave great recommendations.  It was my first time having Indian cuisine, and it was a great time with good friends and food.

We were expecting some sort of sauce or something for dipping, but none was brought. So we dug in. It was really flavorful, with whole cumin seeds, and completely addictive.\n\nFor four of us, we ordered two small plates and three larger dishes.\nShredded Duck: A caramelized onion uttapam with duck vindaloo topped with tiny greens and some shredded watermelon radish. Beware, it's very tiny. However, it is highly delicious.\nSouth Indian Bhel Puri: An amazing salad of puffed rice, green mango, beets, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, cilantro. Everything is cut up into tiny pieces and is impossibly light (like, the weight when you spoon it onto your plate is nothing), crisp, and an amazing combination of flavors. Served with two different chutneys; one was green and chimichurri-esque, and the other was tamarind and sweet.\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa: A huge, light dosa, crisp on the edges and softer in the middle, wrapped around mashed potatoes. The whole thing was buttery and redolent of white truffle. Super simple, but so delicious.\nWinter Uttapam: A thicker version of a dosa, almost like a frittata, with the toppings cooked into it. This one had sunchokes, potatoes, spinach, sundried tomatoes, trumpet mushrooms, and caramelized fennel. It was tasty, but with that line up of toppings, it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The three sauces it was served with were all delicious: coconut chutney (mild), tomato chutney (a little heat), and sambar, this incredible soup that I ate straight out of the bowl. That may have been poor form, but it was totally worth it. \nKerala Fish Moilee: Sustainably-caught halibut in a pool of a red coconut sauce that was impossibly flavorful, citrusy, and spiced, over coconut rice. There was this amazing salad served with it with Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, and caramelized red onion. The whole plate was just beautiful. \n\nI wasn't planning to drink...didn't even really want to, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of their cocktails once I saw the list. I would've liked to try six of them, but settled on the Peony (Plymouth gin, hisbiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, bird's eye chile). It was beautiful (a recurring theme at this place), light pink, opaque with coconut milk, and with a swath of lime zest on the top. It was balanced and flavorful, not too sweet, and the coconut milk was a nice counterpoint to the spiciness of the food. \n\nDosa is totally unlike any other Indian restaurant I've ever been to, and I loved it.", "author": "Dara M."}

Having visited Dosa multiple times before I recommended this place to my husband as a must - try even for Indians. However, the service that night made me pledge never to come back there even though the food here is one of the best Indian fushion food in the city. \n  \nReason... our server was awful awful awful.... He was pushy and rude and just assumed that we were newbies to Dosa with no clue. I asked him about the difference between two ginger based cocktails and his response was all our cocktails are different with spices. Well.... that's not what I asked. \nsecondly, we just started ordering appetizers and wasn't sure on the quantity so preferred to order less and then choose to order more if required and he was extremely pushy and said we needed to order more. Again, I had been to this place several times before and exactly knew their portion sizes so didn't appreciate his pushiness. Not to mention that we had to ask him thrice before we got poppadum in our table which my guests kid really wanted. I would imagine a restaurant of this caliber should provide special service to tables with children.\n\nWe hadn't even had the appetizers served when the same server told us \"You better start ordering the entrees... We run out pretty fast\". I mean really!!!! It was just 8.30 on a Friday night. I would imagine Dosa knows that weekend nights are busy and preps up accordingly. \n\nAfter dinner, we asked the kid if he wanted ice cream at Smittens and yes, he did. Douche Server just hears ice cream and immediately says in a rude fashion \"We don't serve ice cream here\" Well... we weren't really speaking to you.\n\nWIth this bad customer service after paying a bill of ~$400, I don't think I will be ever returning to Dosa.I would imagine that with these prices Dosa should definitely work on their customer service (stop kiss assing the affluent white clientele while serving Indian food) or else it will be a matter of time when no one will be returning for their food!!! People dine out to get pampered and be treated special. This was definitely not at Dosa!!!!", "author": "Pooja P."}

I've only been there once just recently but my experience from start to finish was superb.  Room is grand. Visually it's a stunner with its artistic, unique, low key sexy lighting, high ceilings, hip SF vibe. Space is so clean and crisp compared to many cramped, cafeteria style Indian cafes.\n\nKnowledgable staff was went out of their way to be friendly. You can judge a restaurant in some ways by how they pair food.  And DOSA knows how to pair food.\n\nAhhh, but the scrumptious food.  Date night or friends night out tip:  Want a perfect snack before going to the Sundance Movie Theatre across the street?  Sit at the bar. Order the spicy,good portion sized, filling VEGGIE SLIDERS ( As a bonus it comes with citrus vinegar kale, crisp chips and delectable chutneys.  Then pair with a PISCO SOUR cocktail  (Almost like a frothy cooling dessert but a cocktail) And their Pisco Sour is made with top of the line Encanto Pisco from Peru. I'm still licking my lips.  \n\nThis is Southern Indian food Vs. Northern Indian food.  Both good. The waiter can quickly and knowledegably explain the difference.  One not perfect note: It can get loud so come at off hours if you want intimate Vs festive.\n\nLastly, for those who've lived in SF awhile, do you recall this was an old Good Will Store? Coming to see the transformation a great designer can remake, is worth the price of admission. From frumpy to sexy, From bargain shopping to out on the town!", "author": "Marianne F."}

It's Fall Harvest Tasting Menu time!!!!!\n\nMr & I indulged in:\n\nKabocha Squash - the squash was a bit over-fried & greasy - maybe a tempura batter would have been better suited but nevertheless, it was still tasty!  Came with a spicy garlic tomato sauce as well as a sweet onion sauce - both were awesome.  Paired w/ a sparkling white & was a nice compliment to the heavy, fried squash\n\nPumpkin & Potato Dosa - tender potatoes schmeered w/ a wonderfully creamy pumpkin curry sauce & served w/ a spicy soup, spicy tomato sauce, MORE pumpkin sauce & a mild coconut - paired w/ a dry Riesling - really cut the spice & added a nice creamy flavor layer to the pumpkin.  This was my fav part of the whole meal - that pumpkin really shone & got an added boost form the tender fall-apart potatoes.  Yum!\n\nVeggie Curry - just as delish as all the times before & packed a nice kick which was immediately tamed w/ their lovely yogurt.  White & purple potatoes paired w/ corn, green beans, peas & I'm sure a whole lot of other things....paired w/ a Malbec & this is where the pairing fell short - we thought the wine was too full & berry to go w/ the curry but 2 out of 3 were definite winners\n\nAfter crying uncle & getting most of our main packed away, we decided to share dessert & got the Coconut Custard Cake.....wowsers!\n\nInfused w/ curry leaves, this custard was more like a panna cotta - but hopefully there was no gelatin!  Tender, flan-like consistency w/ the chew of the coconut - this was pure awesomeness!\n\nI like how they ask if you've been there before & will happily educate you about the dipping process or order suggestions - friendly crew, fab ambiance, delish food!", "author": "Adrienne G."}

Loved the music that they were playing at the time and it felt like a pretty posh place overall.  We came in on a Friday evening around 9pm and found it solidly packed, which attests to its popularity.  We were seated after 45 minutes and I ended up ordering the Chennai chicken and the lamb dosa.\n\nThe Chennai chicken was tasty and came out in a fairly large sized portion for a small plate.  The chicken was fried and had a slight spiciness to it that gave it a nice little kick.  It came with a side of yogurt sauce, raw onions, and a lemon that added some nice additional flavor to the dish.  I thought it was a solid appetizer.\n\nThe lamb dosa was ok and not anything amazing.  It came out with a bowl of sambar, cup of coconut chutney, cup of tomato chutney, and a bowl of lamb.  The dosa was perfectly made, but the sambar and chutneys were not particularly flavorful / spicy and the lamb had the taste and consistency of a bowl of chili.  I was not impressed by the dish and it may be that I should've ordered another dosa.\n\nOverall, I really liked the environment of this place and would come here to lounge at the bar, but I wasn't particularly impressed by the food.  I found it very overpriced for the quality of what you received... but then I've never thought of dosas capable of being fancy.", "author": "Randy S."}

This got their attention so they hurried over to refill the waters. I was quite pleasant about it, but they were unapologetic and annoyed.

Luckily we got a reservation on Opentable so that it wasn't a long wait to get a table. We were seated in a quieter area of the restaurant, which was a relief, since it was so loud and crowded! Only real downside to the service was that because it was so busy, they forgot one of our appetizer orders and by the time they delivered it we were halfway through our dinner and had no room to eat more.\n\nI got the pumpkin dosa which was pretty good. I expected there to be pumpkin inside the dosa, but it was just a separate dip, which was sweet and yummy. Next time I come here I probably wouldn't eat the insides of the dosa--or maybe it was just the pumpkin dosa filling that was boring, just potatoes. My boyfriend got the paneer dosa which came in 3 little wraps instead of the large triangle, and I thought that one tasted really good.\n\nIf you can come here DEFINITELY try the peony cocktail!

When we left 90 minutes later, no one had taken any of those seats and it was very obvious that they had lied in order to save the tables in the hope that larger groups might come in.\n\nI ordered a sada paper dosa for myself, and I specifically asked our server that it be made extra crisp, but when it came only about 40% of it was crisp and the rest of it was soft. \n\nWe also got the kofta, which to me was not worth the the cost specially since they do not even include a bowl of rice with the $20 entree so it had to be purchased separately as did the chutney.\n\nAdditionally, our server took his own sweet time to refill water glasses and only did so after being asked to (when I managed to flag him down). \n\nThe only redeeming quality of this restaurant was that they seem to have kept the restroom clean.\n\nOverall, I just don't think that this place is worth as much as it charges and that they need to improve their service.", "author": "Saagar U."}

The restaurant itself is beautiful. I fell in love with all the decorations. Very elegant looking to me. \n\nOur waiter was friendly (can't remember his name) and gave us recommendations since it was our first time there. He was very knowledgable of the menu and was helpful. The waiter gave us this complementary snack before ordering and it was a great way to start the meal. I wish I knew what it was called, but I think it's some type of Indian chip or maybe bread? \n\nI ordered the chicken xacuti and the mango lassi. My boyfriend ordered the lamb dosa. The chicken xacuti is a curry dish and it was DELICIOUS. The sauce was spicy but not too overwhelming. It's served with coconut rice which is a good complement. As for the mango lassi (yogurt based smoothie), I thought it was average. It was not as sweet as the other mango lassi that I've had in the past. The lamb dosa was delicious as well and it wasn't as heavy of a meal compared to the chicken xacuti. The staff are very quick in regards to refilling water glasses or responding to customers' questions/requests. \n\nReason why this place is 4.5 stars instead of 5: Despite the flavorful amazing food, I thought the pricing could have been maybe 2-3 dollars cheaper (at least during lunch time). Also, I thought $5 for a mango lassi was overpriced. I'm used to paying $3 at other indian restaurants. \n\nAnyway, if you are in the Japantown area and don't have a particular craving for sushi TRY DOSA. The restaurant is gorgeous. The staff are friendly. The food (although overpriced) is flavorful and packed with a lot of spices. Go out and try it! \n\nI will definitely be coming back to DOSA in the future (and bringing friends/family to try it).", "author": "joanne c."}

I generally love Dosa, especially this location, so was excited to visit for Diwali with my husband for a nice, pre fixe dinner and a few cocktails. I haven't been in several months, so I'm not sure if the decline in quality is broader than just this event. The summary is that the service was slow/rude and the food did not seem as fresh as it should have been.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n- Running behind on reservations, we had an 8:30pm table but were seated at 9:15pm\n- After delivering our cocktails, I asked the waiter to snap a quick photo from my phone. He said, \"Sure, I'll just be right back\" but then proceeded to enter an order in the computer and wait on other tables right in front of us - he never returned for the photo!\n- There was too long of a wait between the courses of the pre fixe menu, and many of the items delivered were luke warm and seemed like they had been sitting out for some time\n- There are only 3 choices of 2 items each on the pre fixe menu, yet one of them was incorrectly delivered to our table initially\n- We asked a server to pack two of our dishes and take away the rest - he stacked both the dirty dishes and the dishes to pack all in one go! While I understand that he would use a different spoon to empty the leftovers into plastic containers, it's still gross to stack them along with the dishes that you're going to discard. This was unprofessional and I would have preferred he take the dirty dishes and the leftovers separately\n- The worst part was when the server came back with our doggie bag - one of the curries was spilling out of its container! He took it back, replaced the bag and wiped down the container - but it was clear he didn't take care to replace the container altogether, as you could tell the curry was still spilling out\n\nWhat went right:\n- I have to say the cocktails were amazing. We ordered 4 in total and I'd highly recommend 3 of them: Steph Curry, King Khan and Peony were all yummy", "author": "Ketki W."}

This just confirms it)\n\nAnd SO affordable (it was my friend's birthday and with 3 of us covering dinner for 4, it came out to only $27 before tax)! Plus the service is great, the upstairs is a little more private and there are a few on the wait staff always keeping an eye on the tables and making sure the water is filled, your questions are answered, etc. \n\nLast time I came I got cocktails as well and they were delicious. This time we got:\n\n* Vada Pav - 4 stars\nSpiced-potato patty, chutneys, caramelized onions & \"gunpowder\"- ground chiles & lentils (1 for $6, 2 for $10)\nReally well done, really spicy, and apparently its rare in Indian-American restaurants for them to split the \"gunpowder\" chile and ghee and let you mix them to your liking. The potato patty was fantastic, but the bread, while it had a good buttery subtle crunch, was just a tiny bit on the stale side (only reason this wasn't 5 stars).\n\n* Channa Bhatura - 5 stars\nChickpea (garbanzo) masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread or vegan poori ($15)\nLove getting this at a table. The bread is the size of a pillow and always impressive when its brought to the table. The chickpeas are cooked to PERFECTION, any less and they would've been too hard, any more and they would've been too starchy. Strong and wonderful flavor as well.\n\n* Uttapam - 4 stars\n(Slightly thicker, pancake-style variation of the Dosa. Each Uttapam is also served with fresh fresh coconut & tomato chutneys  coconut & tomato chutneys and  sambar  sambar)\nTopped with onion, tomatoes & green chiles ($11.5)\nReally liked the tomato & onion one - the tomato gives it a nice tangy kick. The pancake, while soft and spongy and delicious, is just a little bit on the oily side though.\n\n* Dosa - 5 stars\n(Savory rice and lentil crepe, all served with fresh served with fresh coconut  coconut & tomato chutneys  tomato chutneys and sambar sambar, a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables and spices. Masala described below is a traditional filling of spiced mashed potatoes)\n* Spicy basil - Masala dosa with a chutney of fresh basil, cashew nuts, ginger, shallots, curry leaves & chiles ($12)\n* Spicy mung masala - Mung lentil dosa ('pesarattu')  with green chiles, chopped onions, cilantro and spiced potatoes ($12)\nBoth the spicy basil and mung were amazing. As thin as the dosa is, it still manages to have a soft interior with a slight crunch to the outside. The masala is great as always, and the basil wasn't too overpowering (we were afraid it would taste too Italian).\n\n* Rasmalai - 5 stars\nSweet cheese patties, cream, cardamom, rose water ($6)\nLove everything, from the toasted pistachio crumbles to the cardamom infused rose water to the chewy cheese patties.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-14", "description": "Why Dosa's IS a 5-star place:\n\nWhen you are emotionally overcome with deep sadness upon taking the last bite of your meal... you know you've eaten something special. I ordered the paneer and peas dosa. And it was gastronomical art. Accompanied with sambar and both a tomato and coconut chutney (I believe the coconut had cilantro in it - and I'm one of those people who LOATHE cilantro, but in this? It was totally acceptable!), my heart physically ached upon taking that final bite. Goodbye, beautiful meal, thank you for existing!\n\nAnd yes, as the menu suggested, I totally used my fingers to eat... and classy restaurants that let me play with my food? INSTA-FIVE STAR.\n\nThe servers were incredibly informed about the components of each dish. I appreciated how, in a totally non-pretentious way, that explained their concept, what went best with what, why things were made a certain way, etc. And, I was a little seduced by the atmosphere in general - the decor was uber tasteful and classy, the lighting was romantically low, the background music was house/techno, and the clientele was all over the map. I'm one of those people who appreciate when four things that don't necessarily organically go together (fancyschmancy interior design, sexy time lighting, music that I want to rave to, and people I could either be having a business meeting or a bachelorette party with) do. Because in this instance, it totally works!\n\nHowever, there are two reasons why Dosa's ISN'T getting 5-stars from me (feel free to stop reading here if you want, because they really are \"As good as it gets!\", except for...)\n\nReason #1, \"Space Invaders Are No Bueno With Me\" - Maybe it's because physically I'm a tiny chick, but people often associate my stature with age. Being little =/= being young. And when you're \"young\" it's okay to have your personal space invaded (or so is the mindset of many adults). That being said, the waitstaff at Dosa's definitely invaded my personal space every go-around with the plates (something I didn't notice them doing with other people). They would stand in back of me, reach around my torso/face with two arms to lift or place plates over my head. Again, something that probably wouldn't even register on other folk's radars, but it did on mine. And...\n\nReason #2, \"Petty, Petty Pie Princess\" - When I found out we were going to Dosa's, I did what any sane yelper does - I looked up their menu. The very first thing that caught my eye was some banana goat cheese pie thing. SOLD. That was the single thing I look forward to eating. When it came time for dessert, though, guess what wasn't on the menu? Mhmm, the banana goat cheese pie. We asked the server if they still carried it. \"I'm sorry, we don't. But it was SOOOOOOO good. Like... seriously, so, so, so good. It's really too bad we don't carry it anymore,\" was her response. I don't want to hear how delicious something I can't have is, so the appropriate response - in my obviously humble opinion - would have been: a) \"I'm sorry, we don't,\" (which is to the point without telling me whether it was good or not leaving me opinion-less and not dessert h'angry) or, b) \"Not anymore. It wasn't that good anyway,\" with a wink and a playful smile (which is more fun and less braggy).\n\nIn the end... my advice? Go to Dosa's. Eat then weep at how gorgeous your meal was.\n\n(Then weep some more because of a dessert you can't have.)", "author": "Steff D."}

Liquor=good hope.\n\nSpice Route cocktails feature some new world wonders-lime, curried nectar, allspice, mango juice, jackfruit! After one cocktail, you'll need the feast to come.\n\nWhile variety may be the spice of life, the paper masala dosa is the bread and butter of Dosa-sans butter. I love how it looms menacingly off of the plate, and with each bite of crispy dosa, potato, lentil, and cashew it becomes somewhat more contained. Usually I'm full by the time it reaches the confines of the plate, but I keep on going because it is part of the journey.\n\nTo ensure that you have adequate provisions for the voyage ahead, you must order the South Indian Moons uttapam-five savory pancakes selected by the chef, accompanied by chutneys and sambar.\n\nI've veered off my beaten path on a few occasions. The Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani is a basmati rice bowl of tender chicken with Indian aromatics, and the masala dosa is a triangular pocket of potatoes, onions, and cashews. Both worthy excursions from the uttapam-paper masala route that I've carved out for myself.\n\nEven though Dosa Valenica is obtaining a liquor license soon, I think I'll voyage here more often.

The food was really tasty and the service was great! There is so much variety on the menu and I really don't think you could go wrong with any of the appetizers. \n\nWe tried a variety of Dosa's and appetizers. The Chennai Chicken was by far my favorite and we couldn't get enough of the Idli fries  - what a great idea! The Masala Dosa was nice and crispy and perfectly made and the portions were pretty big.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and gave us some great recommendations after asking us a few questions on what type of flavors and foods we like.

After checking the menu out online I figured it would be better to go for lunch (to spare our wallets a bit), and we didn't have to fight the crowds to get a table so it was win-win. \n\nWe arrived when they opened at 11:30 and were seated immediately. The interior is very large and floridly decorated, but it's tasteful and interesting (definitely eye catching). The service is impeccable; our waiter was very nice, attentive and even answered my random questions when it came to identifying items of my thali. \n\nThe BF ordered the Chennai Chicken as an appetizer, then the Prawn Frankie for his meal, while I ordered the vegetarian thali. First off: ORDER THE CHENNAI CHICKEN. This was the most perfectly cooked, tender chicken I have ever consumed, and it was coated in a combination of spices that enveloped your mouth in such a satisfying way. As if it couldn't get any better, they add a side of cucumber yogurt that you can dip your chicken it, which calms the spices and makes it even better!! That sauce was just as yummy as the chicken, and both my BF and I resorted to using a spoon to scrape the last remnants out of the cup ;)\n\nThe prawn Frankie looks like a wrap but it's filled with delicious shrimp and it's quite filling. As for my thali, when I received it I freaked out a bit because it was so gigantic! There were at least 10 little individual cups on this tray bigger than my head, and in the center were rice, and two kinds of bread. I couldn't name everything I had if I tried but I remember there was saffron rice, basmati rice, cucumber yogurt, veggies, a pickled vegetable of some sort, lentils, a spicy soup, a rice puff with ghee (tasted cheesy to me), and veggie curry among other things. There was so much variety but I was able to taste so many things for a reasonable price. LEGIT.\n\nOverall this was a great dining experience. I would definitely come back, although the prices for dinner are a bit steep... then again they have a lot more entree options on the dinner menu so I bet it's worth it! Gotta come back and try the chai tea as well =)", "author": "Sam F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-22", "description": "I'm a huge fan of Dosa's flavors and gorgeous food. However, Dosa has a special \"allergy menu\" that's something of a problem. To me, being someone with food allergies (I'm celiac with additional food allergies) an \"allergy menu\" implies that the wait and kitchen staff are conscientious about the needs of those of us with food allergies. If you have a gluten-free menu, that means the food has to be prepared and cooked separate from other food. I've had many wonderful meals at Dosa and then been sick on my way home and for the rest of the night even though what I ordered supposedly didn't have anything I'm allergic to. My guess is that food is getting cross-contaminated--most likely when it's being cooked. \n\nDosa should either get rid of their allergy menu so that those of us with allergies know that the food isn't safe or they should commit to insuring their \"gluten-free\" menu is actually gluten free and not getting cross-contaminated. There are restaurants in SF that meet the needs of those of us with real food allergies without making us feel like we're being high maintenance or asking too much: Nopalito has tons of gluten-free items and (at least on Broderick) is super careful about cross contamination. Tacolicious will cook food in a separate pan (not on the regular grill) for those who react to cross-contamination. And Delfina and Al's Place are also great at dealing with allergies and and making diner's with allergies not feel like pariahs or assholes. I've always wanted to believe that Dosa was in that camp but time and time again I've ended up sick after a really expensive dinner.\n\nOh, and their gluten-free dosa chips--at least at the Fillmore location (I'm not 100% about Valencia) get cross-contaminated after a certain time in the evening. And their wait staff generally isn't aware that happens. In fact, my cousin's birthday dinner (she's also Celiac) was ruined because the wait staff didn't realize the dosa chips were cross contaminated and it took 10-15 minutes of me insisting that they ask the kitchen because I've been through this many times with them--and guess, what? They were; after the wait staff repeatedly said they were gluten-free and she'd had some! How confusing is that? Seriously, claiming your food is gluten free and then trying to save a couple dollars by cross-contaminating the cooking oil with gluten at a certain time is just about as lame as it gets.\n\nThe message is if you have real food allergies, unfortunately, it's probably better to stay home and not be in pain.", "author": "Beth B."}

The food, decor and cocktails are noticeably high quality and delicious. It's for sure some of the best Indian food I've had. \n\nTry the Mango Prawns (great sweet spicy combo) and any of the Dosas. The cocktails are also a huge bonus of dining at Dosa. Each one is completely original and delicious. My favorite is the Peony - a lavender and coconut milk flavored concoction. I've never had Indian dessert that I like except at Dosa - the gelatos are perfection. If you're brave, they even suggest forgoing silverware and going the traditional route of eating with your hands. \n\nThis is a prime date or special event spot.

We always found it to be very good and went there today. Heard the chef changed. The quality of the food has been absolutely horrible. Both tea and coffee came out lukewarm. The chicken starter was barely ok. The main course was all cold. I am really curious to know how the chef could send out dosas cold. And the Parathas that came with the egg curry were frozen which were barely heated ! We could still sea the uncooked part of frozen parathas clearly. The sambar sent out with dosas was clearly stale and barely reheated in a microwave. Five of us could barely eat half of the main course and then two of us are feeling sick since afternoon when we went for lunch today. It is absolutely disappointing to see such a good restaurant change the quality of food drastically. We used to recommend this place to all our friends in bay area and outside. We will definitely warn them to stay away from this place from now on.

For entrees we had the lamb keema dosa, white truffle dosa, sada dosa, and some prawn dish. My brother in-laws prawn dish was good, while everything else was just plain \"blah\".

That goes without question.  I have to say our experience here was odd from the moment we walked in.  I called on our way over (8:07pm) stating we were a few minutes away.  The host said no problem we are still getting your table ready.  We arrive at 8:17pm and they say they gave our table away but another one should be open soon.  This opened an evening of AWFUL service.  Awful service.  When we were seated the server examined the table and welcomed me back.  I informed him that this was my first visit.  Then began his attempts to remedy that. Weirdly after getting our apps he disappeared and this condescending snooty b***h \"CAITLIN\" approached our table.  Seriously.  I never write reviews like this but OMG she had the most arrogant energy and tone in each and every interaction all 4 of us had w her.  Like 75% of the table is Indian but she went on and on about the difference btwn an dosa & upadam to my brother who just asked what she recommends.  Hands down.  Worst server ever.  Hence we didn't get dessert bc 1.) She basically threw the menus at us (2.) we really wanted to get out of there.  \n\nFood Picks : (apps)scallops & samosa.  Dhai bhara so creative & tasty!! Entree dosa w truffle oil! \n\nSo after years of awaiting to eat at this place we were treated poorly and left angry.  Not how u expect a Saturday night dinner at a restaurant if this caliber to be.  Shame on you Dosa.\n\nThen (after posting this) I get a message from a manager explaining how Caitlin is shy by nature, amongst excuses for our other issues. First, if I want my business to thrive I make sure I hire people who are best suited for the job.  I've never known a personality of a successful server that is \"shy\".   It's pathetic how they are making excuses for their shortcomings.  Own it and stop making excuses.  Absolutely pathetic.

Used to be a killer sound system with great music, awesome service, and killer food and great drinks. Last night we had a 5:30 res. The place was empty, but they still gave us a crappy table upstairs (and we had our res for months). We objected, and managed a better table. I ordered a drink off of their drink menu and it came back only 2/3'rds full (at $12!), and just not that cold or that good. My group all ordered chai, which was luke warm and bitter. then we ordered food. Nothing was bad.....and nothing wad that good either. The beet and cumin soup was basically an un-strained beet puree. Next up was the paneer and pea dosa, which really tasted more like cream cheese with no peas. Bland, rich, and not that much flavor, though the sauces were good (chili sambar, coconut chutney and a tamarind thing). Finally the lamb chop. It was cooked well, and basically as good as a lamb chop is.....but nothing more. Nothing special. All that.....and $80 a head, tax tip/out the door.\n\nIt seems like maybe ownership has changed, and all of the things that made this place special were simply overlooked.

This was an upscale Indian restaurant and it sort of surprised me since I didn't know what to expect coming in - gf made the reservation. \n\nFood:\nDecent. We started with the Chennai chicken and Paper Dosa which were both quite tasty. I've never had Dosa before so it was very interesting and i walked away a fan. The 3 dipping sauces were unique and I would recommend trying all three together.\n\nMy one complaint was that our entree (lamb curry with lemon rice) took way too long to come out and wasn't very good at all.\n\nOverall it is a nice date spot and I'd come back again to try other dishes but for Indian food I prefer to go to a hole in the wall like Pakwan.", "author": "William L."}

Our server was extremely helpful and recommended a few dishes to us.\n\nWe started with a special brussel sprouts dish, which was delicious. I also had an order of pekoras. For the entree, my wife had an uttapam, while I had a dosa. We both loved our dishes so much! So tasty!

Went here for our company holiday dinner and just fell in love with this place all over again.  This was the first time that I got to try their special cocktails.  The only one I can remember is the PEONY.  I thought this would be a sweet drink (it was) but it's served with birds eye chili that gives it a spicy kick that I loved.  Has coconut milk in it so it's a thicker in texture but I definitely recommend this drink to anyone.  The other drinks I tried were whiskey or bourbon based and all very good also.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of small plates to start: CHUTNEY SAMPLER, FALL PORIYAL (brussel sprouts), CHENNAI CHICKEN, SAMOSAS, BHATURA, and probably a couple others I can't remember.  My favorites were the chicken and brussel sprouts.  The Bhatura was a good add since we ate it with our entrees too.  It's just a big puffed up bread that deflates when dug into.  I was indifferent to the other dishes.\n\nBest part of the night though was the Lamb Chops entree I ordered.  SOOOOO GOOD I'm drooling as I type.  Incredibly tender and covered in a curry sauce that is SPICY.  I really wanted to keep eating but I was so full from the drinks & starters that I only finished half.  Took home the leftovers and ate it the next day and it was still just as good.  This beats everything I've ever eaten at Dosa.  \n\nFinished the dinner off with 3 desserts that I honestly can't really remember.  If you read my other reviews, I'm clearly not a dessert person so I could care less.  I do remember they were very pretty to look at though.

It was too late in the night to eat the dosa she got back, but I tried the sambar that came with the dosa.\n\nIt was BAHM!\n\nI've had many dosas/sambars before, and they were good, but they were spiced to the point that you knew this stuff is Indian /South Asian, and then went kind of flat, kind of like a good dal with lots of veggies. \n\nThen there's this stuff, which with the heat went up several levels. This stuff was gooood! It was very spicy indeed, and I enjoyed it very much. My ears felt the heat, got a little thickly, and steamed came out and the itch and all went away. I would end up eating the whole sambar , by itself. Watch for the chili though. I bit into it in the dim light and that was not pleasant. Have yet to have another sambar that pleasures me this much. (I can't say anything about authenticity, but it was delicious.)\n\nWord of warning: if you can't eat spicy, best to move on. South Indian food is notoriously spicy and makes the typical* Indo/Pakistani food look like child's play. My sister couldn't eat the food here and had to return a dish. They were kind and understanding and gave my sister a cream pop ( she didn't say if it was kulfi or not).\n\n*Typical in the sense that it's what lots of people think of first when it comes to South Asian food, gravy with wheat bread and basmati rice and much more represented in the bay area.", "author": "Chi L."}

Now the DOSA's, that was just amazing! A warm gooey cheese inside cooked perfectly, and when you dip it into the sauces it just melts in your mouth. The Uttapam was like any other pancake-style item that taste good, but taste even better once you dip it into the sauces! Our third and final course made the dinner even more spectacular as the flavors just popped. The Tamil Lamb has a nice spicy kick to it (medium) that brings out the wonderful flavors, while the Chicken & Eggplant tasted great with the lemon rice. The wine's for each course complimented the dishes well.\n\nAs for the service, it was just mediocre. We had to wave our hands to get their attention as they just walked by us a few times without even looking or seeing how we're doing.\n\nLast but not least, it's nice to know that \"DOSA is committed to sustainable & healthy choices by using local & organic ingredients as much as possible, natural, free-range & grass-fed lamb, cage-free eggs, anti-biotic-free & hormone-free chicken, fresh & sustainably-caught fish and non-GMO oils.\" \n\nQuick Tips:\n\n   * Make reservations!\n   * Get there at least 15 minutes early to find parking!\n   * Full menu is online.\n\nThe Good: Fantastic Flavorful Foods | Vibrant Atmosphere | Elegant Decor\n\nThe Bad: Service | Parking", "author": "Matthew M."}

Here they serve Dosas and Uttapams which are like basically Indian savory crepes!\n\nIt was my first time eating it and I was sooo happy! Yum yum. We also got the Chennai Chicken (which is like an Indian version of Chinese popcorn chicken) and a Mango Lassi!

Upon walking in at 2pm on a Sunday, it was full and mostly of Indians. I took that to be a good sign.The service was 5/5 - I had a lot of questions about the menu, and wanted one item on the menu that our server initially said was unavailable (all of the Thalis). However, when I showed disappointment (I like to try everything), he asked a server and they whipped one up for us. I was here with my mom, and we split the Corn & Paneer Kofta Thali and the Lamb \"Keema\" Dosa. I did not love all of the Thali dishes, but that's just my tastebuds and I loved being able to try everything. A bit pricy, but the portion was huge and lasted me another meal and then some. This is a great way to get a variety of tastes and even comes with a dessert (rose custard - a bit overpowering on the rose). The dosa came with four dipping sauces - a cilantro-coconut, a tomato, sambar and the lamb. Perfectly spiced. The dosa was a little crispy and fun to break and eat. My two favorite items were the lamb and corn & paneer which was in a thick coconut sauce. A little pricey, yes, but you are paying for good food. \n\nIf we are being picky, I didn't love the interior of the restaurant, which seemed to be trying to be your average almost-high-end restaurant, and the tables were too close together, but I wouldn't dock any points because the food was stellar.", "author": "Maxene G."}

Great, bold, flavor, with a bit of kick to top things off.\n\n* Samosas \"North & South\" ($9) - More or less your standard samosas, the South was filled with caramelized onions and veggies, while the North was simply filled with spiced potatoes. Despite my love of potatoes, I found the South to be much tastier, with greater flavor. However, when had with the sauces, both were quite tasty.\n\nWhile I ordered the following for myself:\n\n* Okra Kolambu ($13) [ http://flic.kr/p/dp67ut ] - While I find the texture of okra to be a bit weird (admit it, okra is a tad slimy), this was actually a very tasty dish, mixing up savory and sweet flavors with a hint of spice. While most will probably find this to be a single serving, I easily had enough leftovers for seconds.\n\n* Rum with South Indian Monsoon ($6 + ?) - Normally a virgin drink, the ingredients (citrus, mint, ginger, juice, and soda) screamed out for a splash of rum. Two others in the group agreed, and not one of us was disappointed by the delicious cocktail that arrived moments later.\n\nWith enjoyable food and great service, Dosa is definitely on my to-revisit list. And while their dinner menu is definitely more in the $$$ tier, their brunch options price out to a more affordable $$. The only thing about the menu that raised an eyebrow was the pricing of items: having appetizers priced the same as entrees seemed rather unusual.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A large, spacious, and multi-level restaurant, maneuverability and accessibility should not pose any problems, as long as you remain on the lower level.

I loved the different chutneys and sambhar that arrived with the dosa and uttapam. The combination of spicy, smokey, cool / refreshing was perfect! There were so many flavors all at once. The curries were very good as well. The chicken was super tender and the prawns had this unique smooth and smokey taste to them. My favorites were the bhatura and the prawns. \n\nEven though we were stuffed, we still split 3 desserts between the four of us. I loved the fresh coconut cream custard. It was a tad too sweet because it was sitting in a light syrup but the coconut textures and flavors were so good that it didn't even matter. We also enjoyed the apricot chiboust, which was apricot tapioca with coconut cream on top. Our least favorite was the raspberry mascarpone tart.

Repeat -- NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS.\n\nSo, my issues with Dosa run deep -- I've never thought this to be one of the better South Indian (or Indian, period) restaurants in the city, and Saturday night sealed the deal.\n\nOur party of 12 (big, I know, but we'd made a reservation weeks before) was told it would be another 25-30 minutes for our table despite all showing up on time. Boyfriend and I headed to the bar where we got two totally subpar old fashions that, with tip, cost $37. Oh right... I forgot how overpriced this place is. Did I mention subpar? There was nothing special about this drink. If anything, it was watered-down and did not help for the dinner that was about to take place. \n\nHeaded upstairs for our table, and it seems our waiter was either stoned or slow, but he definitely wasn't all there. Ordering (one person handled all of it... family style... super easy...) took an amusingly long time. It stopped being amusing when only two of our dishes showed up and no more. Aaaand our waiter disappeared. Aaaand another waiter introduced himself. Aaaand they had no record of the rest of our order. Aaand suddenly the original waiter appeared and could barely remember anything. \"Remember when you asked us which variety of rice we wanted? You never brought it... Remember when you suggested the Chennai chicken? Yeah, that never came...\" \n\nA lot of inaction pursued--it was odd, really. And then the manager came out just to check on us. We explained that it seemed our order was \"dropped\" and he became very flustered. Saying he was sorry (the right thing to do) but overemphasizing that this had never happened before (yeah, to us either), and that he needed to figure out where the ball had been dropped (not our problem, just fix it).\n\nI was super duper unimpressed with the manager, who, as a manager, needs to manage, even if it's a situation that he's never seen before. That's why they pay you the big bucks, right? \n\nWe had to reorder. They comped the rest of the dishes and threw in some dessert.

The beautiful dark woods mixed with warm golden hues around the two-story restaurant are absolutely striking. \n\nOnce seated and greeted, we were given delicious Papadam (lentil chips), which I happily munched on while my sister ordered for us. For our party of four, we settled on a family style selection of the Channa Bhatura, Spicy Mung Masala Dosa, Chicken & Eggplant 'Baingan Bharta', and the Kerala Fish Moilee.\n\nFirst, let's talk about how amazingly delicious and fun the Channa Bhatura was. Perfectly seasoned and tender chickpeas that are scooped up with pieces of lightly fried and puffy wheat bread (bhatura). And the most fun thing? The Bhatura comes served like a balloon ready to be punctured and used as a utensil. DEE-LISH and ENTERTAINING? that's a Nguyen-Win Situation to me :)\n\nThe Spicy Mung Masala Dosa brought back many memories for me as I constantly ordered Dosas in Chennai. This particular dosa was not only stuffed with mung beans but also with potatoes and cilantro-quite possibly two of my favorite things. All Dosas here are served with three types of \"dipping sauces\": coconut chutney, tomato chutney and sambar. As a Condiment Monster, this was also a Nguyen-Win Situation for me :)\n\nOur two main entrees were also scrumptious-though I did prefer the aforementioned two items. The Kerala Halibut Moilee was extremely tender, moist and paired so well with the velvety coconut sauce.

We have frequented this place more than 15 times now and every time it has been the same - aggressive pushy attitude when it comes to ordering food. We know what we want and how much we want, we don't want the restaurant staff telling us not to order this or that. We have stopped eating here due to this and have no intention to go back! There are better South Indian restaurants in the city anyways so might as well drive farther away from home than put up with pushy service.", "author": "Sun B."}

You definitely feel like your walking into a high class restaurant. I ordered the green mango and paneer dosa and it was pretty delicious! The overall dosa has a nice crisp texture and the filling is flavorful. You get the dosa with 2 types of different chutney's and sambar! I like their spicy chutney and it paired really well with my dosa. The sambar was pleasing to the taste buds as well.\n\nFor all those people who don't take dosa on the regular- dip the dosa in the sambar and then take it with the chutney!\n\nOnly thing is it is pricy!

Everything we ate was delicious and I would order again. The drinks are also fantastic - each is unique so I would pick your waiter's brain about what you're in the mood for. \n\nOnly reason it gets 4 starts and not 5 is that it was really hard to get in. We've tried getting a table with just 2 people and have had to wait up to a week, and then with a large party it was even more difficult.

FYI--Happy hour is Monday through Thursday from 5:30p-7:00p  It got busy quick, and by the time my party of 4 left around 7:30, the bar was pretty packed.  So get here early!\n\nDisclaimer: I never finished my PhD in Indian cuisine, so I cannot attest to the authentic-ness of the food here, but I enjoyed Dosa's food along with the chic-lounge atmosphere.\n\nMy happy hour beverage of choice:\n-Chili-margarita! ($6)  Your basic margarita with a spicy kick.  I'll take two!  It might not be on the menu when you go, because I think the happy hour drinks rotate.\n\nHappy hour menu choices:\n-Samosas 'North and South':  Maybe it was the chili margaritas, but I couldn't really tell the difference between North and South (i'm talking about the food here, not my motor skills).  Regardless, the dipping sauces are what really made this dish.\n-Chennai chicken (2 orders): I love the popcorn chicken at Tapioca Express, and that is basically what this is, minus the spice.  Served with a creamy, tangy yogurt sets this apart from your typical TapX chicken.  The chicken was crunchy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the outside.  One order should be sufficient for two people if you are sampling other goodies.  \n-Vada Pav (vegetarian slider):  Two sliders per order.  Not my favorite dish of the night, but definitely worth a try.\n\nDosa choices:\n-Paper masala:  Delicious!  Pretty simple dish consisting of a paper-thin crepe served with Indian potatoes and dipping sauces.  This is a definitely a staple dish that I order when I go to Dosa. \n-White truffle masala:  Delicious x 2.  Essentially the paper masala, but with the Indian potatoes drizzled with truffle oil and stuffed inside the crepe.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.\n\nAt $34 per person, this isn't the cheapest happy hour I've been to (then again I've probably dropped more at other happy hours on booze alone), so I take back my statement.  Overall, a fun place to go for happy hour--great food, delicious drinks, and a chic atmosphere!", "author": "Matt S."}

We need help with the Dosa selection though because wel, there are so many.  We ended up with the White Truffle Masala.\n\nThe Duck Vindaloo was quite good.  The Vindaloo sauce itself had the typical spicy/sour taste, but unlike the ones you get at \"lesser\" Indian places, the flavors truly danced on your taste buds.  I didn't get to taste the duck breast, but ended up with the leg instead.  Honestly, it was just okay, but I have always preferred breast of drumstick.  The Prawn Masala was also quite good.  Another dish that was enhanced with the use of higher standard ingredients.  The flavor was familiar, but more sophisticated.  The Dosa was delicious, and the white truffle oil really stood out.  Flaky, crispy, and chewy all at once  Best pairing is with the lentil soup, which I thought was amazing!\n\nWe also had a couple of drinks.

Two stories, great service, romantic lighting at night, bright during the day/for brunch. \n\nCocktails? Truly some of the best in the city, if you're looking for interesting flavors and new combinations. The Peony w/ coconut milk, gin, and fresh chilies is my go-to, and you can't really get anything similar elsewhere. Same goes for many of the other cocktails. \n\nBeer/Wine? List is huge, and includes hard cider and multiple sparkling wines by the glass. \n\nFood? Fantastic california-indian food, that's fresh, interesting, and well presented. You can get your basic masala and rice, or get adventurous and pick something you've never had before; same goes for dosa. They also do a very relaxed brunch on the weekends, that has great dosa filled with scrambled eggs and indian spiced potatoes on the side. \n\nIf you're a first-timer or a little worried about heat, I'd get the panner & pea dosa; even kids could have that. But if you want to branch out, do the tasting menu; it's totally worth it. The salad they had during the spring with fried goat-cheese balls, watermelon radishes, and curry vinaigrette was REALLY GOOD. The biryani are also great, as are any of the dosas. The uttapams are small, compared to everything else, but are a nice snack or small plate. \n\nIf you're visiting SF, want a great night out, or want to take an adventure with food, this is totally the place.

All the places in LA are extremely casual and nothing too exciting. \n\nEnter, the perfect opportunity to eat some great Indian while in SF! Dosa on Fillmore is Southern Indian. I had never had southern Indian before and it's different dishes than the Northern Indian but same flavors and perhaps more spicy. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food - in hindsight, way too much food! We started with the chennai chicken - a glorified and much more flavorful version of the chicken nugget. This nugget had it going on! It was organic (yes organic at an Indian restaurant!) marinated in organic yogurt with cumin and coriander and fried. But they really didn't taste fried. \n\nFor entrees we ordered the lamb chops (omg these were good), the chicken biryani and the white truffle dosa (a potato filled crepe). The lamb chops came with a mildy spiced lentil sauce that had a sweetness to it that I loved. The chicken was shredded and tender mixed into basmati rice with caramelized onions, peas and cashews and was tender and amazing! The dosa smelled of white truffles but didn't really taste like truffles much, which was a bit of a let down.  \n\nWe also got the bhatura - this large puffy bread that reminded me of a donut in the best possible of ways. Yummy! \n\nEverything was much spicier than I anticipated. I was really feeling the heat, which I loved, but I know for someone who is spice averse this would be a turn off. \n\nI would have loved to try their desserts but I was SO full that there was no chance. \n\nThe space is big, open and modern.

We ended up getting:  \n\n1st course: Seafood vada - not recommended. This was more like a seafood pancake that doesn't really taste like seafood. They could have told me it was a potato pancake and I would not have known the difference. Get something else! \n\n2nd course: Dosas with lamb (+ we got masala on the side). Meh. Dosa tasted like a not as tasty version of Ethiopian sour dough rolls. They provided two types of chutney with dosas, but that wasn't flavored strongly enough to complement the sour taste of dosa. The lamb was okay, and the masala was okay. But I didn't think anything was great or amazing. Also, they only gave us one roll of dosa and we thought given the price, we would have liked one more.    \n\n3rd course: Chicken Xacut. This was actually pretty good.

Happily, I have not forgotten anything about the food. \n\nWe all opted for the three-course tasting menu, so I was able to pinch off of my neighbors plates to get a better sampling. It all started with a fabulous Chicory and Pear Salad: so fresh, so bright, so thoughtfully put together and then dressed with the single most delicious cilantro dressing I've ever had. I also nipped a bit of the shredded duck which was rich and decadent and totally special. However, my next course was the absolute stand-out: Winter Uttapam with caramelized fennel, sun-dried tomatoes and a smattering of root veg. The star was the actual pancake -- dense without being doughy and subtly flavorful. \n\nWhere I ran into a bit of trouble was course #3, the Chicken Xacuti. Now, I like spice. I like spice this side of hot. I can throw back, seriously. This, however, was the kind of snot-inducing, drool-triggering, heartburn-churning heat that my wee Scottish stomach is just not built for. I silently suffered until I saw my colleagues around the table fanning the flames, as well. However, if you are a scoville scholar and enthusiast, this is the dish for you. \n\nAnother component worthy of noting: the drinks!

After some Yelp sleuthing, we came upon Dosa on Fillmore. \n\nSomething that we haven't tried before? Yep!\nSomething that isn't Japanese food? Yep!\nWe didn't require transit to get there? Yep!\nThe meal wouldn't break the bank? Yep!\n\nSo with that information in tow, we walked 5 minutes from our hotel to Dosa on Fillmore. To our surprise, the restaurant was quite upscale, but still retained a casual feel. We were greeted by the friendly hostess, who quickly led us to our table (booked on OpenTable). \n\nOf course, we couldn't go to an establishment named after a food and not try said food item. So along with a Masala Dosa, my fiancee ordered a Paneer & Cheese Uttapam and an order of the Chennai Chicken to start. \n\nFirst came some homemade lentil chips. It was a bit oily, but burst with flavour (surprising, since the chip itself is very plain from what I assumed was ground lentils). I could only have a single chip, but oil aside the flavour was great. \n\nSoon after, we received the Chenna Chicken, which was served in a bowl on top of a bed of red onions along with a savoury yogurt-based dipping sauce. This was my favorite part of the meal. The chicken pieces were breast meat, but still remained juicy. The seasoning had a substantial spicy kick to it, but when paired with the yogurt dip the flavours all came together and only really nice touch of heat remained at the end of the bite. \n\nNext came the dosa, which comes with 3 dipping sauces: a spicy lentil soup, and a pair of tomato  and coconut chutneys. The lentil soup by itself explodes with flavour. The chutneys were both very delicious as well. As for the dosa itself- the dosa is basically a large, thin crepe folded in half with the filling inside. The crepe had a wonderful sweetness to it that mixed very well with the dipping sauce flavours. The filling (in this case potatoes, onions and cashews) was also very good, but was a touch heavy (since it's almost all starch). That said, all the flavours came together really well, and no one ingredient overpowered any of the others. The variety in dipping sauce flavours kept each bite different from the next, so overall it was a very engaging meal. I honestly thought we didn't order enough and insisted we order something else (the uttapam), but after the dosa and chicken starter my fiancee and I were stuffed. However, the uttapam came to the table so we couldn't ignore it. \n\nThe uttapam is basically a pancake with various ingredients embedded in it, and sliced like a pizza for your enjoyment. The same dipping sauces that accompany the dosa are present, providing the same flavour variety you get with the dosa. From what we could finish, the uttapam was delicious as well. The paneer (cheese) was mild, and added a nice creaminess to the dish which otherwise would've been a touch on the dry side. \n\nI was really glad my fiancee decided to try this place. While she doesn't share the same enthusiasm as I do with the meal, it opened my eyes to another delicious aspect of Indian cuisine that I never knew existed. I just hope that the few dosa eateries in Vancouver are as good as this place was.", "author": "Vincent A."}

We ate Truffle dosa (chef's advice), Kesar dosa and Thali. All tastes really yummy. I strongly recommend this place. \n\nThe only reason i gave 4 stars is because they did not want to take a reservation for 14 people, when i want to take my friends on a weekend.

We ended up ordering 4 plates ala carte and walked out with food left over for $85 total.\n\nThe samosas (chicken and potatoes) were great. Probably the best I've ever had. The chicken filling was especially flavorful. The lamb keema dosa was also memorable. The dosa was crispy and light. Perfectly paired with the lamb.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e was also feeling adventurous and ordered the chili uttapam. It's got Serranos, jalape\u00f1os, habaneros and Thai chilis. It was extremely spicy for me, but the heat and the flavor just left me going back for more. Make sure you get your water refilled often! The green coconut chutney helped cool it down as well.\n\nMy disappointment of the night was this chicken dish under the curry menu. Chicken chennai I think? The curry it came in was more like a gravy. Obvious cinnamon taste, but it's salty. My first impression was literally WTF. Salty, creamy, cinnamon-y taste.

Yes, I'm single-handedly bringing back the word Dork. So there.\n\nDosa has a regular bar where you can eat, but I love the big community table just past the hostess station. It makes you feel like you're still part of the bigger restaurant as a whole, but you don't feel like you stand out when you're eating alone. I will often dip in somewhere to grab a bite, as the teens have all their activities and I've sometimes gotta kill some time and it's mealtime.\n\nSo Wednesday night, came in around 7:30 and no problem to sit at the community table. Very friendly, very competent service. After asking a few questions, I landed on ordering the Bhel Puri and just the straight up classic Masala dosa. When the Bhel Puri came, I had completely forgotten what was in it....but it was so delicious that I gobbled it down pretty quickly. Looking at their online menu now, it was puffed rice, roasted parsnips, potatoes, tomatoes, onions & tangerines, flavored with spicy mint and tamarind chutneys. I highly recommend it. Then the dosa came...and it was just fine. It's not the first time I've been here, and not the only place I've had dosas, but it had been awhile so I was somewhat surprised when the filling seemed to be all plopped into the middle of the crepe-like outside. No big deal - I spread it around as I tore it off and dipped it sauces. But just a little odd. \n\nAnyway, of course I started chatting up the ladies who were seated across from me, as we had seen each other in line at the film festival we just came from, so I spent most of the evening talking with them....so never felt like I was alone.

Attempt to have everyone at your table get an empty glass of water for more than 2 minutes. I have never eaten at a place that refilled water with a such a religious fervor. Water was refilled with an urgency that made me suspect my glass would explode if it was left empty for even 5 minutes. Anyway, on to the important things. Dosa is potentially the hippest restaurant I've ever dined at. The dim lighting and the night lounge like decor made me realize that I've been dining like a 40 year old. It's a nice place to bring your 20 or 30 something year old friends, but not such a great place to bring your grandparents unless you're also going to bring a flashlight so they can read the menu.  I made a reservation for Friday night, and when we showed up, our table wasn't ready. I think reservations should be thought of as granting a shorter wait time rather than no wait time here. It wasn't too bad though. We were seated ten minutes later. People without reservations waited about an hour. \n\nWe chose items off of the dine about town menu. To start off, we had the chicken chennai and the coconut seafood soup. Both were amazing, but the soup was better. It was full of humongous scallops, prawns, mussels, fish and squid cooked in a delicious coconut milk broth. I'm not normally much of a seafood person, but this was fantastic. The dosas came next. Between the green mango and paneer and the truffle masala, the truffle was better. If I came back though, I'd probably skip on the dosas altogether. They were good, but not worth paying full price for. I'm not sure if it was because the dine about town menu had smaller portions or because this is their normal ratio, but my dosa was about 25% filling, and 75% just empty wrapper. The soup that came with them was too salty and spicy for me to finish. For our last course, we had the hyderabadi lamb and the prawn masala. Both were delicious. This course was a tie. Lamb was tender, prawns tasted fresh. You wouldn't go wrong picking either one. \n\nI did take a peek at the full price menu. Entrees here run between $20-$35.

Our waitress recommended the house special flat bread creations: two dosas and one uttapam. Presentation is gorgeous. Flavors are spicy and potent. The house chips and a pale ale from Paso Robles saved me from overload. I can't handle much in the way of hot hot food, and I slipped in under the danger zone tonight at DoF.\n\nThe included soup is too intense, but I managed to consume half of it. The included green chutney is mild and pleasant, but the red sauce isn't.\n\nDecor and furnishings are spectacular. Sit in a corner booth if you can for comfort and people watching.\n\nTake the advice of your server. One dish each is plenty filling, especially when you share. The overall trend is quite spicy, but you will survive with your server's assistance.\n\nI had the huge sweet potato dosa, and it was impressive and flavorful. My wife had the summer uttapam that was attractive and delicious. My favorite was actually our friend's spicy chile dosa that was not too spicy at all, and had excellent flavors and texture.\n\nSalted caramel ice cream was fine for mini-dessert, but the toasted cocoanut sorbet was a total dud: grainy and lacking in cohesiveness.\n\nNot sure if we'll return any time soon, but it was very memorable and high quality.", "author": "John N."}

A group of eight of us went on a Sunday for brunch and while the service was good,  but there wasn't a single thing on the menu that wowed any of us.  I've been to the Valencia location a couple of times (now several years ago) and I had good memories of the place which does not translate to Dosa on Fillmore.\n\nFirst of all, we have a four year old and we told them this from the get-go an asked whether or not we should look elsewhere because we didn't want to inconvenience anyone by bringing a toddler.  They said 'come on in' - Dosa is a kid-friendly place.  That  might be true in terms of service but there is not a single thing on that menu that a kid can eat because of the ridiculous amount of spice in everything.  They brought us some $10 version of a grilled cheese sandwich and the kid hated it.  I didn't like it either.  They brought us a bowl of coconut rice that was super spicy. And then they made a mistake and brought us popadoms with pepper in them.  So, the kid was not happy.\n\nNow, onto the adults.  We all ordered different stuff from tasting plates to Dosas to udapams and the consensus all around is that all you could taste from one plate to the next is spice , spice, spice.  There's  no reprive from the amount of heat from one dish to another so pretty soon everything tastes exactly the same.  Maybe this is how people eat in India - I got the schpeel from our waiter - but you've got to tone it down, Dosa.  We don't eat Chinese food in America the same as in China because Americans don't like that kind of food.  You could say the same about a lot of ethnic cuisine.  You have to make the food work for the palates of the people you are catering to.  And none of the eight SF-foodie gringos at our table liked what you had to offer or your prices.  $15 for a pancake and a smattering of cheap ingredients.  Give me a break!!!\n\nIt was a disappointing few hundred bucks that we spent and I'll stick with my Indian favorite - Mehfil - the next time we decide to go Indian as they pack huge flavor into their stuff without overpowering the spice factor.  I recommend you do the same!  And don't ever bring a kid there.  Big mistake!", "author": "Carmen C."}

Note: add the lime juice on top, it completes the dish. http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2ewj00VyUYsjQUdX6l9RdQ/l.jpg\n\nSamosas 'North & South' (Savory pastries filled with caramelized onions & vegetables (South) and spiced potatos (North) $9: I liked the North Samosa better than the South. The North was more flavorful. I didn't bother using the two sauces they provided with the samosas; however, the South Samosa was a bit bland and needed the extra sauces. http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R653VFSV512ZnYNPyrTHLA/l.jpg\n\nHyderabadi Chicken Briyani (Bone-in, natural, basmati rice with an aromatic spiced sauce, caramelized onions, cashews, peas) $20: Hrm... not worth $20 bucks, but it was the spiciest briyani I have had so far ( I say that in a good way). There is something in the dish that they forgot to remove because it made the first couple of bites unbearable. After the weird taste went away, the rest of the briyani I had was good. http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YLymH6ELzBpoqJ7plqIN7w/l.jpg\n\nDuck Vindaloo (Spicy, goan curry, red chiles, malt vinegar, ginger, cumin, mini potatoes, curry leaves) $19: mMmmm duck! we got two drum sticks and a couple of mini pieces of meat scattered around. The meat was very tender and the sauce was ok, but as an entree dish the portion was small.  http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WBWJyQCbRgXCr-4ZuNyQHA/l.jpg\n\nMango Prawns (Reductions of coconut milk, red chiles, ginger, red onions & spices) $17: This was by far my favorite dish of the night. My favorite dish of the night. The shrimp was cooked to perfection with the addition of fresh mango cubes and sweet sauce... it was the bomb. http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5oHecZLq6L8vkl42-QcRnA/l.jpg\n\nCoconut rice ($3): You can definitely smell the coconut, but you can't really taste it. I do recommend ordering this if you are getting a curry entree. \n\nRoasted Chile & Garlic Masala Dosa (Masala dosa layered with spread of spicy chutney) $11.50: This dish was very interesting, Dosa is the thin crepe like layer over mashed potatoes. The dosa itself was very spicy and when dipped in the sauces provided, it was pretty tasty! I didn't taste the garlic, but over all, it was really spicy and interesting to eat. I would recommend trying this dish if you ever come here. http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xiut_pQXN78kdPfHcaEBDA/l.jpg\n\nService was disappointing, I think I waited 20 mins before the waitress came to explain what dosa was and other unique dishes they had. Then another 10 mins passed before she came back to take our order. Between meals, it took over 20 mins to get our main dishes. Even trying to waive someone down to pack our left overs and requesting for our check was difficult.", "author": "Erica T."}

If you're reading this on a phone and don't want to read my novel length review, here's the short version: Delicious! Go here!\n\nAfter all the hype, I knew I would have to try one of the fabulous Indian places in SF--and as it happened, one of Dosa's locations is right down the street from the Hotel Kabuki, where I was staying. It also happened to be right across from the theater I had been planning to see a movie at later that night. Dosa and then the Hunger Games--it seemed as if it was meant to be!\n\nThe building took me by surprise--I was expecting classy, but not this much grandeur! Our waiters were helpful, though somewhat socially awkward--not really picking up on our cues and there were definitely some awkward silences that were a little weird. Overall they were helpful and good natured, however, and were happy to explain everything to us.\n\nI am half Bengali and have been to India several times, but I have only been fortunate enough to make it south once. I also lived in Los Angeles for a long period of time, and frequented Artesia, so I'd like to think that I know my way around south Indian food pretty well.\n\nI was intrigued by some of the cocktails, but the waiter sold me on the Ginger Ante, which was quite good--had the warmth and the bite of ginger, rather than just the taste.  My boyfriend and I decided to make the most of our experience and try a little bit of everything. We ordered the South Indian Moons (5 uttapam sampler) and a tasting menu with the things we had read the most raves about: Chennai chicken, the white truffle masala dosa, and the mango prawns.\n\nIn all of my experience, South Indian food is sort of like an inferno of deliciousness in the mouth. This definitely seemed like the white people version, with the spice toned waaay down. The dosa itself was sour, but not quite at the level you usually get. That does not mean that it wasn't delicious, though! I was having a love affair with that potato filling, like that annoying pop song by September. \"No I can't get over, and I don't know why...\" Seriously tasty. The sambar was right on par and the chutneys were delicious as well - the coconut lime one went exceptionally well with the delicateness of this one, I think.\n\nThe Chennai chicken was pretty good, but again, I was wanting more spice! I used to get samosas every day when I was in Calcutta and their Northern interpretation was good--they came to our table a little less than piping hot, and if they're anything less than piping hot then the breading can seem a little heavy handed. The southern version was fantastic, though--creamy sweet onions and very well spiced.\n\nThe uttapam sampler was one of my favorite things. They brought out sunchoke, paneer, tomato, potato, and green bell pepper (?). The sunchoke was pretty good--the crunch from the sunchokes was a playful element, though at times the pieces would fall out so it seemed it could be a little better married (maybe smaller chunks?). The tomato and potato were my two favorites, with the potato definitely coming out on top - a light, fluffy, slightly sour dream of an uttapam. The paneer I left to my boyfriend because I cannot eat cheese, and he said it was good though it did convey the sometimes spongy quality that paneer can have--nothing wrong with that per se but he is picky about texture. The green bell pepper--question marked because I am not sure if that is exactly what it was--was delicious, whatever it was, crunchy with small enough chunks that it was a seamless part of the uttapam. It had the freshness of green bell pepper without the bitterness, which was really wonderful.\n\nFinally, we were served the mango prawns. The prawns themselves were succulent, the coconut rice fragrant. It took me some time to realize that the chunks were actually mango, though that should have been obvious. If you get this, try to eat them with the prawns--they are quite intense on their own. Overall, no complaints on this one--I was full to bursting and still ate half of it.\n\nOverall, we had a really great experience. Dosa makes South Indian elegant, and while I was missing some of the fire, it was still a delightful experience.", "author": "Lynne S."}

Named after a famed bread of South India, DOSA rocks this jazzy part of town night after night with its curries and beautiful South Indian flavors. The restaurant is stylish, chic and innovative. It is upscale for sure. But nice to know a place prepares delicious dishes that combine fresh ingredients and uncomplicated layers of flavors. DOSA is no bs -- it tells you that Indian food does not have to be difficult. This restaurant not only provides inspiration for food lovers or a self-proclaimed foodie like me and easy- to-eat dishes that begin with basics for those who are less assured in an Indian restaurant. With its visually enticing plates, this place makes a great place to share a great time and good, I mean really good Indian food, with your friends. As an enthusiast cook who specialize in Indian food myself, I believe good food is a combination of fresh ingredients and uncomplicated layers of flavors. When you start with quality produce, a few simple flavors will just complement and contrast with your base ingredients to create the perfect taste experience. Think of food with passion, not anxiety, and feel free to substitute as you please. This is often how personalized culinary masterpieces are created. That's DOSA. Tonight, just like everytime, the dishes were spiced, flavored, curried and cooked to perfection and all arrived lavishedly drizzled or bathed in light raita and sauce. Getting in, we knew what this place is all about, the air inside flavored unmista\ny... We asked for two major curry dishes and  the go-withs -- the lemon and coconut basmati rice, and four other small plates including its biggest star -- the dosa itself. It is truly a star dish to say the least -- favored so beautifully to perfection, light, crispy, fluffy and folded perfectly on a flat white plate. Scratch it gently with the fork and the flavors burst out... The other small plate that I truly enjoyed tonight is the scallop dish -- perfectly seared and served over a light raita sauce. Coming from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where Indian food is everywhere, my girls know the delicate southern taste of India and were pleased with their maincourses and side orders tonight. The craftcocktails were unbelievably delightful, too. I am giving them another double thumbs up! We ordered the vodka-based Peony, Half Moon, Hanging Gardens, and Ginger Ice Tea. They are DOSA's prize fighters and truly refreshing. If you are a light weight like me, tell them because each kicks in nicely and warms you up almost instantly. Tonight, the food/drink pairing was spot on--light lamb and fish curries were beautifully paired with sweetened cocktails instead of its famed Sujata wines. The service was really sweet to say the least -- by that I meant relaxed and unhurried. Drinks unpushed. \nThe noise level was good. The price? A little pricey but it is an upscale restaurant and a great place to celebrate with loved ones. Go!", "author": "Ambrose A."}

They also have solid beer & wine choices! 4 Stars\n\nTHE FOOD - A little disappointing, everything was mild (even the \"extremely spicy\" dishes).

Thankfully we had a reservation because it was packed solid - from the bar to the door!\n\nWhenever a restaurant offers a tasting menu, we tend to go ahead and order it, expecting it to be the best they have to offer.  It was $35 per person for a 3-course menu, plus an additional $18 for the wine pairings.  Very reasonable, and they did not disappoint!  The food was amazing, the wine pairings were perfect and the service was excellent - our server was very attentive, our water glasses were never empty (which is important here because the spices start out mellow then catch up with you!) and the courses were pefectly timed.  PERFECT!\n\nEverything we had was amazing.  Indian is one of my favorite cuisines, but I've never had a dosa before.  It's basically a filled crepe.  We shared both the spinach & fennel dosa and the white truffle masala dosa.  It was so good, I'm still dreaming about going back again that white truffle masala dosa!  Also highly recommend the halibut curry with the coconut rice, and the duck - not something that you'd expect at an Indian restaurant, but they did an excellent job of it.  The entire dessert menu looked amazing too! \n\nWe're definitely going back for the Bhatura.  It wasn't offered on the tasting menu but it seemed like the thing to order since all of the tables around us had them.  It looked like an amazingly huge ball of bread (naan on steroids) on a plate.  Some of them may have been 12-15 inches in diameter, they were that impressive.  I can't wait to get back!", "author": "Kimberly J."}

It's very elegant and beautiful inside, with high ceilings and big wooden tables, but still maintains a comfortable and kwasi-casual atmosphere. \n\nWe had a drink at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party, which is very open and sleek. I had the Bengali Gimlet, with curried nectar and lime juice, which was exquisite. I love the use of curry- very inventive and flavorful. We had made a reservation for Sunday dinner for 4 only a few hours before but they seated us with no problem in the cozy upstairs dining room after the other two had arrived.\n\nFood! I tried:\n\nPrawn-Chili Fry - I thought this was just okay, but one really loved this.\n\nSamosas - Very tasty, I do love me some ground, spiced veggies stuffed in fried \npastries and dipped into varying flavor-packed sauces. Nailed it! The other star here was actually a small side salad, dressed in what seemed to be some sort of lemon-cumin vinaigrette. I wish I could order more of this as an entire dish as well!\n\nChennai Chicken - Not too crazy about this dish, something was a bit lacking for me.\n\nWhite Truffle Masala Dosa - I may be a sucker for anything with truffles, but this one knocked it out of the park. A giant, thin crepe that is simultaneously pillowy-soft, yet crispy, filled with creamy, spiced, mashed potatoes and white truffle oil, served alongside three unique (fantastic!) sauces for tearing and dipping. We inhaled it in less than two minutes and had to order another.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable of the menu, and the food was overall delicious. Price for a nice dinner for 4 with drinks was pretty reasonable as well, definitely with the price. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Sophie H."}

I'm not expecting super cheap food because you do get what you pay for sometimes, but at least reasonable. It's not like they're serving meat dishes here, it's mainly vegetarian! I've been to nice Indian restaurants but never had this type of experience or had to pay this much. \n\nI guess this is the PF Chang version for Indian food? Overpriced & overrated.

Indian food is a staple for me, as my wife is south Asian and a great cook, and we have lived over there for many years and return a lot. So not trying to brag, but we know a little something about the food. Everything was pretty good - the first course was perhaps the most problematic. Though the lamb kebabs were great (lamb seems to be the strong suit, along with uttapam and dosa) the crab salad was drenched in cumin - we could only assume that there was crab since that is what we ordered, and there seemed to be something resembling crab that tasted like cumin. Duck and mushroom uttapam as second courses were great, though the uttapam were somewhat oily. Especially the duck - with the duck confit added a touch of intensity to the grilled duck. Oddly enough, for a cuisine noted for its diversity and focus on veg dishes, grilled meat seemed to be the strong suit here, as the lamb osso bucco (not grilled but stewed, or braised) was fantastic, just like osso bucco should be, noist and cooked perfectly, flaking of the bone in succulent pieces. The lobster biryani - very good. Desserts were passable. Beverage list was fine - Bengali gimlet again suffered from an overdose of cumin/\n\nThe spice level was just fine - not too much, not too little, though a couple next to us were reaching for the water frequently, and ordered pretty much the same items. The service was passable - the serveuse was fairly prompt, seemed somewhat unfamiliar with some standard items (our order for a sparkling chard/pinot - as listed in the bev menu - seemed to throw her. The server seemed resigned to working this evening, and did the bare minimum. \n\nThe restaurant might want to look into a coatroom. And if they have one, the server might want to mention it.\n\nAll in all quite good, though in SF, not much above the pack, except that along with Amber India, Dosa seems to be the only other top end Indian destination in the city.

For those unfamiliar with SOUTH Indian food, you've got a fighting chance to enjoy the full potential of this incredible restaurant, but it might be a struggle. \n\nI've never experienced an effort at South Indian cuisine like this outside of India, in my life. To be clear, the menu is obviously designed to minimize the damage from being a Southern restaurant in a society that is really only familiar with Northern, and that is, Punjabi, mom and pops named some variation of Delhi, Taj, India, or Gandhi. Cultured Americans know naan and chicken tikka masala. But even they tend not to know idli and sambar. So, there are plenty of northern stand-bys on the menu when you first open it. You actually have to dig deep into the third page before the South Indian dosa offerings come up. The less adventurous will have plenty of familiar entrees to choose from.\n\nAnd that's too bad. A couple seated next to us were quite obviously confused when they got their menus. The poor things asked some silly question of the waitress, who politely tried to explain to them that there are no tandoori ovens at South Indian restaurants, which is why there was no naan. They then opted to order the one thing that they figured looked and tasted most like naan: bhatura (a North Indian bread). The world of dosas would remain untouched by them.\n\nThere are so many stunningly delicious variations of amazing Indian recipes on this menu that I almost want to fly out to San Francisco again just for the sake of sampling more.

I had Indian food for both lunch and dinner (not by choice) the night before I tried Dosa on Fillmore, on this night I found myself attacking my idlli with glee (not ghee). It's just such a different experience from typical Punjabi food and nowhere nearly as oppressive with rich sauces and butter. Most dishes start out at a moderately high (for American taste buds) spice level that can only be increased so that it reaches \"gun powder\" status (ie, perfect for *my* American taste buds). Not spicy enough (you cray cray?), they'll gladly provide you with ways to get your mouth on fire, ie coconut chutneys (different from the kind you're used to).\n\nDosai is typically vegetarian (vegan in traditional places), but our server informed us that protein-heavy dishes could be found in the small plates. In addition to the idlli, I ordered the veggie sliders, which were tasty but I removed the rather pedestrian bread from the patty (?- too loose to call it that), which didn't leave me with much. I also wasn't in love with the rasam (soup) which I'm used to being much, much spicier. I do recommend the idlli with sambal. I unfortunately didn't get to try a dosa.\n\nWhat I do appreciate about DOF is that it's aesthetically nothing like my regular dosa haunt on Long Island, which has a dreary interior that I will gladly suffer because I just love the food so much. DOF has a sumptuous ambiance that lends itself well to both large groups and more intimate dinners as well. \n\n*Do* take advantage that this isn't the most authentic Indian restaurant and order a craft cocktail. I sampled enough of them to be able to say they are good at these. What? I'm all about taking advantage of situations.\n \nAlthough I typically avoid desserts because I can't enjoy it on a full stomach, I tasted a variety of what they have to offer and I'm afraid I can't recommend any of them (especially the coconut custard). No big deal. I doubt I've ever had an Indian dessert that I liked.", "author": "Joi B."}

The servers were all very educated on the menu and super helpful when it came to how to eat the food.  For an Indian food newbie I appreciate any help I can get.  The food was outstanding I ate every bite of my Dosa it was simple, spicy, and delicious. This will be a meal I won't ever forget.\n\nDid I mention my cocktail? The \"peony?\"  There was quite a selection of specialty cocktails to choose from, almost all included ingredients made in house.   The peony was nothing like I had before, gin with hibiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, and birds eye chili.  The drink was a pretty purple concoction, creamy, spicy and served up in a martini glass, my kind of drink for sure.\n\nI highly recommend checking this place out, the fact that I will make sure to visit here next time I'm in San Fran says a lot because we all know this city has a ton of options when it comes to food.

It was my go to place before a movie at the Sundance Kabuki. This time I made the mistake of making a reservation through Open Table. After a polite greeting at the desk the hosts quickly found my reservation, and whisked me and my date up to the stuffy, and dimly lit mezzanine level with its own bar. It didn't even feel like the same restaurant. It was so dimly lit I could not read the menu. When I asked for an extra candle or a flashlight for more light, the waitress sneered \"use your cell phone flashlight app like the other customers\". The advice would have been fine if I had a flashlight app or a cell phone. \n\nI would still recommend the food and the drink but only on on the lower level--even sitting at the downstairs bar-- but the very unpleasant and dark mezzanine is where they punish customers who bother to make reservation and punish their workers--forced to descend and climb a steep staircase for every trip to the kitchen. Never eat in a place where its so dark you can't read the menu or see the food.", "author": "Jefferson P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-31", "description": "We will definitely be attending next year's Diwali celebration. Last night was a glittering tasting safari.\nVALUE: practically a nine course meal but advertised as a four course dinner. Each course contained two to four dishes! It was a steal at $55 apiece with pairing cocktails at $11-13 apiece. You can't eat like this anywhere else in SF and certainly not in such a glamorous place.\nAMBIENCE: I was happy to see both gay and straight couples in the restaurant. So far, it has been a welcoming place and that is very important to me, lots of mixed couples, diverse genders. I loved the small children running around in their fancy dress. This place is about community as much as making a profit. Very nice to see kids learning about Diwali. SF needs more child-positive places like this - elegant, glamorous AND diverse. You can tell that the owners take pride in the restaurant's mix of people and they like to create a great vibe. You want to dress up here because it is so much fun. Bollywood music and DJ mixing - fabulous!\nSERVICE: Outstanding as usual. Greeter apologized for the short wait. Server was attentive, came back to us regularly and checked in, seemed calm and unrushed, and staff seemed to have a game plan that was working. Looked like extra staff was brought in and I think it made for a smooth enjoyable experience. Even the owners checked on diners. Owner Emily Mitra came through in a glamorous salwar kameez outfit as the evening deepend and later, her partner Anjan Mitra came through, checking on diners and visited our table as well, greeting myself and my partner.\nMENU I was intrigued to see goat curry and fried tilapia on the menu.  We were hoping for a seafood dish! It was delicious.\nTASTES: Pappadums were blessedly plain not spicy - thank you! Better balance of heat with authentic buffering elements: Would love to see the raita made with some cooling bland elements. Too much chili and watery tomato juice makes a burning feeling. My mom used to put soaked split mung dal into hers as well as coriander/cilantro leaf, and she never put raw chillies in the raita item. That would have offered a much needed offset to the too spicy food - next time go for more balance: each raw chili or chili oil dish should have a cooling offset to it. My stomach was burning  after he first three courses.  How about a mung dal raita with every course of fried spicy food?\nAs always the main meal (last course) was fantastic, way too much food. Dessert was an adventure as always, loved the fresh gellee mango fruit pate but I really missed the Indian spices in the desserts - no cardamom in the coconut balls or in the almond-pistachio toffee squares? That's so wrong! How about jaggery? Everyone knows that South Indians have a sweet tooth - I came for the dessert and I need that cardamom finish!\nLooking forward to next year - if you missed it, you really missed out on a special evening,", "author": "Nan L."}

Basically one of the managers flung a spoon of chutney on three girls while picking up the plates (one of them being the b'day girl!)

Decor is fancy but not stuffy. It was crowded and therefore a little loud, but it would be a very nice place for a date. We were a little early so we decided to sit at the bar and sip on cocktails until our table was ready. We had the Peony and the Gin & Tonic (with cardamom, yum!). Both were great. \n\nShortly after getting the drinks, we were told our table was ready (a bit ahead of our 7:30pm reservation time). The hostess transferred the tab seamlessly.\n\nThe tasting menu looked amazing but we opted for appetizers & dosas. Here's what we ate:\n\nAppetizers:\nLamb Kofta\nSamosas 'North & South'\n\nDosas:\nLamb 'Keema' \nSpicy Mung Masala\n\nEverything was brought out hot & fresh - the lamb kofta was particularly tasty and I ended up sopping up the remaining sauce with my pappadum (they had to bring us 2 baskets, we gobbled them up so quickly). The samosas were also very good, not oily and easily shared. \n\nI like my food to have a bit of a kick, so I opted for the spicy mung masala - which was great and perfectly spicy. When my brother was distracted and looking away, I nibbled on his lamb keema and *almost* wished I'd ordered that instead, until I took another bite off my own plate and my taste buds did another jig for joy. We really should have split each dosa in half and shared. Next time. \n\nEat the dosas with your hands for maximum enjoyment.

It was terrific on its own, and also nice with the cilantro-mint chutney. The Uttapam with Paneer and Peas was also really nice. It's almost like an adult version of grilled cheese I particularly liked it paired with the subtly spiced Channa Bhatura (a chickpea masala dish which is also terrific with its own soft, puffy wheat bread) and Dahl Rice (rice with yogurt and veggies). The rice is a terrific way to cut spice and bring out the flavors of a dish. The cocktails, even my virgin versions, are really nice. I recommend the Peony, it's a gin-based cocktail with has hibiscus masala nectar, coconut juice, lime and and a hint of chili. Even minus the gin, It''s delicate and quite refreshing.

The Tamil Lamb was also good (I'm usually turned away from lamb due to gamey-ness), and the Chile Cilantro Fish was tasty... Overall a good mix of different flavors.\n\nI'd say this would be a good date night spot for some classy Indian food if you don't mind dropping a few dollars...

Spectacular service and delicious food. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had a reservation (recommended, it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night) and we were seated immediately. The host gave us a run through of how their menu works and gave us his own recommendations, which was really helpful. Then our server, Megan H, came by and also helped us out with our selections. I was REALLY impressed by how knowledgable she was about the foods. She recommended drinks and answered all of our questions about portion size, flavor, etc. They also give you these chips to start off with, which are SO ADDICTING, and Megan was able to tell me what they were made of. Already obsessed. \n\nThe food was delicious. We got the scallops and samosa appetizers, which were definitely appetizer-sized portions. Just enough to split between the two of us. We also shared a dosa, which was very good when paired with the chutneys and the tomato-lentil soup that it came with. We also got two of their specialty cocktails, the Ante and the Peony, which were both quite good. Megan recommended their chai-white chocolate gelato (their dessert special that night), which we got, and it was amazing. Hints of chai in a creamy gelato... My boyfriend got their chai tea, which we were not really impressed with. We prefer spicier chais, and their's is quite mild. But all in all, it was a delicious meal.\n\nThe appetizers came out pretty quickly, but our dosa took awhile, which we were more than okay with. They kept us occupied with more of those chips. Then suddenly, we were told that since our dosa was taking awhile, it'd be on the house?! I have never had a restaurant take responsibility like that, and was most pleasantly surprised. Especially because I've waited longer for food from other restaurants. Dosa cares about the entire experience, not just the food, which was very refreshing. 5 stars, would recommend to a friend, and will definitely be back.", "author": "Tiffany Y."}

The others enjoyed their cocktails, while my monsoon was interesting at best - I did not like chucks of ginger going up the straw and the taste was too savory for me, not refreshing enough. Our nice waitress gave us advice on how many plates to share amongst the 4 of us. We split 2 appetizers and 3 dosas.\n\n- Chennai chicken was delicious as everyone has pointed out. The only meat we had for the meal. Large portion too, great for sharing.\n- North/south samosas were decent, but not exactly worth the $9 for just two.\n- Dosas ($12-13) - white truffle, paper masala, and basil - each were humongous and the stuffing in the truffle and basil was not spread out enough. The edges of the dosas were basically just the crepe. As soon as we hit the middle, it tasted amazing though. None of them were bad. Overall table consensus was for the paper masala, enjoyed with the different dipping sauces.\n\nThose dishes plus a few rounds of drinks came to about $40 per person with taxes. Not extremely bad for a classy dinner and an adventure trying new things. But for the everyday takeout of tikka masala and rice, go to a more affordable Indian joint.", "author": "Jeffrey Y."}

I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous.\n\nThe samosas were good, one northern and one southern style samosa come per order - but the most interesting part of the dish was the tamarind sauce and chutney.\n\nThe dosa had 95% paneer, and a few little fresh peas dotted throughout. The accompanying coconut, tomato and sambar dipping sauces were fine. A little bland upon bland, then you hit the through-the-roof hot sambar, and nothing seemed very balanced. \n\nWe asked our waiter (who liked pointing at us with two index fingers kind of like the Fonz) what the different uttapams were in the sampler, because one with onions was actually really delicious, and he was like 'well, I couldn't tell ya'.

I think I was more interested in looking around at the intricacy of the decor than I was in actually eating my food. \n\nI came here for a casual dinner, so I ended up spending much more than I had planned. We ordered a bunch of plates for sharing amongst the group, as well as individual meals. I ordered the masala dosa where the dosa was made out of wheat, and was so displeased. It was pretty much impossible to eat because it was crunchy instead of your typical dosa which is foldable. How am I supposed to eat the masala?! I struggled and struggled with my dosa until I finally just left it up for grabs for everyone else while I worked on the other dishes. \n\nThe watermelon, sprouts, and paneer salad was probably among the most innovative dishes I've ever seen. I had seconds and thirds (and fourths) and I didn't even feel guilty bc it was just watermelon and sprouts. The chennai chicken is to die for but I was dunzo after eating maybe 2 pieces because that shit looks 3x deep-fried. Greasy af but it definitely should be tried on a cheat day. There was one other dish, some kind of shrimp curry, that I also recommend. The main courses themselves (as for me, I only had the unmanageable dosa) were nothing to rave about, in my honest opinion.\n\nOverall, love the ambience. Food was good, but not THAT great especially for what I paid. 4 stars felt a little too generous, but don't let that stray you away.

I know some of you may be shaking your heads at me thinking about all the other goods I'm missing out on from the menu. But, I don't care for 2 reasons. One, it's named \"Dosa\" for crying out loud! Don't you think this means that its namesake should be the best thing on the menu? I do. And two, Sir Nicholas never orders the dosa, but he always shares so I do get to try the other menu items. And I have to say I haven't found one I like better than my dosas yet.\n\nI've tried a wide variety of the types of dosa that's offered here and I like them all, but my favorite right now might be the green chile because it's so spicy and delicious. Cocktails are quite nice, too. Again I haven't had one I would turn down again so you just have to find one made with the type of liquor you most enjoy and order away.\n\nFor a little tip, Dosa lets you book your Open Table reservations up to pretty much the last minute so before you head out see if there are any soonish reservations open.

I really like this place and have been here many times. Very unique dishes and flavours. I could explore this menu for weeks and never get sick of it. Our waitress was helpful and very nice. I went with a group and we ordered half the menu and shared everything. My favorite was the lamb sliders, amazing! Now for the reasons I took off 3 stars; the rude and unacceptable behavior from a restaurant of this caliber and cost. My fiance set up a surprise birthday dinner for me and 8 friends. I had no idea until the receptionist spoiled the surprise. My fiance called ahead and made sure they knew it was a birthday dinner and supposed to be a surprise. The first thing the hostess says is \"tell me when your whole party is here.\" I corrected here it was a party of 2 which she said, \"no party of 8.\" My fiance's face dropped with disappointment and reminds the hostess that it was supposed to be a surprise. The hostess does not say sorry or even acknowledges that her mistake ruined the surprise. I can understand making a mistake like that, but to not even apologize or at least empathize, is unacceptable in the service industry and weird. Next big mistake, we had to wait close to 45 minutes for our table that we had a reservation for. Keep in mind this place makes you put down a credit card so they can charge you if you don't live up to your side of the deal for a rez. The hostess came by after half an hour and said, with no warmth what so ever, \"sorry about the wait I have notified the manager.\" At no point did the manager ever come over, and the extra long wait was never acknowledged again.They didn't even comp a desert or offer anything in retribution. I have worked in a restaurant before and have seen entire meals comped for less. This is even worse when I think about the how we would have been charged a fee is we missed our rez, yet they can completely drop the ball and barely even offer an apology. We had a great and very expensive dinner but it was overshadowed by the rude behavior upfront. I would recommend this place for the food but don't use it for a special occasion.

I was baffled because it was a miss on all levels - the food was not authentic, nor did it do a good job of bringing in a fusion element to the different items. In my opinion, everything I tasted just fell flat - no flavor, no element of surprise, no nothing, FLAT.\n\nI'm a South Indian. I know the food. I ordered a pesarattu or the Spicy Mung Masala. What I got was not really a pesarattu, I make better pesarattu and I won't even pretend to be a good cook. Others on my table ordered:\n\nPaneer & Spinach dosa -  marginally better than everything else that we ordered, but still not on par with dosa I've had in other bay area establishments. \n\nOkra Kolambu - no flavor, I was hoping for a nice coconut kick to the whole dish, but apparently it was too much to expect\n\nPersimmons & Iddiapam - we were warned that the dish was sweet, but we were intrigued by the usage of persimmons in an iddiapam preparation and wanted to try it out. Will not make the mistake again!\n\nOverall, it was a very disappointing, uninspired and expensive meal ($73 + tax for 2 entrees and a drink, per couple). I don't think I'll ever go back.

Bookman and I were kicking around and he suggested Dosa; I acquiesced, after speaking to the host taking our res and explaining my allergy to capsaicin and foolishly asking, \"Can the kitchen do something with no spice? Like, saag paneer?\" \n\n\"Paneer, yeah, ummm... the cheese? Yes, we can do that. We have that.\"  The tone was set and sealed with those words...\n \nReservation for two; right when they opened at 5:30pm. We arrived early and scored a parking spot; kicked around and  waited until they opened the doors; I was HUNGRY. \n\nThe dining room was empty; we were literally the first guests for dinner and the host asked for our name. \"Bookman, party of 2\". Without blinking, he asked, \"And... what WAS the first name?\" \n\nGrammar police. \"The name is P.S.\" I guess they were expecting the Bookman Family Reunion that night. *shrug* It could happen. We were directed to the bench, NOTgiven menus and advised that we would be seated shortly (less than 10 minutes later). \n\nI am far from a saint, but I also know that I should have been offered a menu to peruse because it was my first time eating at Dosa and when I previewed the menu displayed outside, I was anxious because every descriptor included the word \"spicy\". I nervously groped inside my bag for some Prilosec. \n\nOur drink orders came out late and were incorrect. To our server's credit, he apologized and quickly corrected it at the bar. Sadly, this would be the first of many \"oops\" moments during our dinner - which were clearly happening in the kitchen, not front of the house. \n\nI thought the decor was beautiful, and appreciated the bold photography and soaring ceiling height. We were seated in the center of the main dining room at a 4 top and I gazed longingly at a smaller table along the back wall. \n\nThe menu was extensive, and a bit overwhelming for me, a first-timer, unfamiliar with Southern Indian Cuisine. So it took more than 15 minutes for us to actually place our order. The pappadum that came out were greasy, much to my dismay; you could actually see the liquid pooling in various spots. Hmmmmmm. \n\nThe paratha were pleasantly chewy and of generous proportion as a $4 side - I stuck to the accompaniments deemed safe for my allergy (raita and tamarind) and was jealous of P.S.'s ability to enjoy the broader spectrum of flavors. \n\nHe ordered the Dahi Rice at a modest $6 for a very large portion and the Mysore Masala Dosa. After consulting again with our gracious and long-suffering server (Zachary?) I committed to the Spring Dosa, no cilantro, hold the red onion. Which, unfortunately, arrived at the table choc full o' cilantro and red onion. My dietary restrictions also banned me from experiencing the sambar, so the dish was dry and with multiple errors from the kitchen did nothing to better my impression of this experience. \n\nSuper-Server immediately offered to make the order right in a sincere and gracious manner, which was much appreciated. \n\nI ordered a salad: Persimmon & Idiappam : Lightly spiced, house-made rice noodles, pearl sago, reduction of coconut milk, mint chutney for $11 - how could I not be intrigued? The dish was more puzzling; the coconut milk was dessert sweet; the rice noodles a flaccid tangle and virtually devoid of taste. I also couldn't reconcile the chunks of red pepper floating in the concoction: is it a dessert? Salad? Noodle dish...? The flavor profile was so chaotic that I abandoned it after only 3 puzzled tastes and another disappointment. \n\nBookman and I left the majority of our meal on the table and no inquiries were made as to whether we enjoyed our dining experience. While our server was professional, he did not offer to take any of the errant items off our ticket. \n\nI applaud the corrections, but was vexed that nothing was done to account for the multiple missteps on the BOH side or the dishes that were wonky and clearly not to our liking.\n\nLovely ambiance; just wish the food matched. I will return to the more humble establishments I've grown to love: full meal for two under $20, instead of an $80 ticket before gratuity. \n\nNamaste-la-vista, baby!", "author": "Kim D."}

The decor was hip and swanky and the service was efficient and comfortable as well. We ordered some drinks first, which were all so well done. The Steph Curry made me change my mind about Bourbon. I'd start drinking Bourbon for sure if it all tasted like Dosa's Steph Curry. My drink, the gin-based Peony, was excellent and frothy, but it was pretty sweet. Flower Child was ethereal and beautiful looking and tasted just as delicious as it looked. We then ordered some small plates and salads, dosas following, and then entrees for a family-style dining experience that worked seamlessly for our long, comfortably-paced meal. The spice level across the board was a little more than I am used to- but I took it as a friendly challenge that yielded great results. The goat cheese & little gem salad reminded me of salads I've had before from other cuisines, but it was deliciously dressed. The goat cheese balls were melt-in-your-mouth tasty and the spiced walnuts sent me to honeyed heaven. And the scallops- perfectly cooked and perfectly spiced. I didn't eat the duck tacos, but those in my party who did said they were amazing. My father remarked they were his favorite part of the meal. We had the sweet potato dosa which was deliciously sweet; it paired well with the white truffle dosa. The mango prawn entree was soooo delicious; as a pescetarian, I relished in the fact that they had such a delicious seafood dish. I enjoyed the fragrant coconut rice that complimented the sweet and spicy mango sauce. My fellow diners had the lamb chops- I heard they were good but 6 of them split 3 chops (1 order) and each portion didn't seem to be more than one bite of lamb- fortunately that didn't affect me. Our waitress Jenny was calm, kind, and very helpful with the menu. She expertly gauged how many dishes we'd need for our party size, and everything turned out nicely. It was a smoothly paced dinner that felt luxurious and magical- all due to the spectacular food, alluring decor, and personable service.

It was so flavorful, so savory, unlike anything else I've tasted before, I just wanted to keep stuffing my face with it.\n\nNext time I go, I'm going to order just small plates and skip the entrees, they take up too much tummy space.

Their dosas, appetizers, and drinks are all delicious. Indians are very picky on our own cuisine but we do love coming here. \n\nThis review is only for my one encounter last night at Dosa. My now husband and I wanted to take our families out after our civil marriage ceremony at City Hall. I made a reservation 2 weeks prior for a group of 14. I knew we would end up having a little bit more people so I called the restaurant a few days later. They happily bumped up my order to a table of 16. They offered if we wanted to have a group dining menu and I declined. I was about to get married, I don't want to pick what other people would have for dinner. I thought everything was set.\n\nI got a call driving to City Hall from a very sweet lady saying that her chef/mangers were asking to change our dining to a tasting menu to better accommodate our large group. I again declined claiming I know my family, I know how they are, they won't be happy with a tasting menu AND if I would have known this, I would have booked something else. She put me on hold and said, don't worry about it, we will see you when you get here. As we get to the bar, my father and friends are ordering some drink. A manager came up to us and told us maybe we shouldn't order because \"we have a minimum for the space upstairs and we won't meet the minimum if order drinks here\". I again told him we were never told about a minimum, are ordering off the regular menu, and was a little frustrated that we were discussing this AGAIN. We went back and forth for a little bit until he realized he was confused on which party we were then let it go. \n\nIt was not terribly inconvenient or maybe I was just so high of endorphins I really didn't care much but it did put a little damper in our happy day. Regardless, our entire family was happy, everyone left full, and we had a great time.

We had the fixed four course menu, which was an excellent deal.  Our courses: seafood soup and bhel puri (first course), lamb dosa and sweet potato dosa (2), kerala fish moilee and chicken (third course), apple tart and lava cake (fourth course).\n\nI loved the seafood soup, it was fabulous, so much so I've asked my mother-in-law to recreate it.  My wife enjoyed her bhel puri, but as her family is from Bombay, she thought it could have used more sauces. The dosas were sada dosas with a stuffing, mine was lamb, hers was sweet potato.  The lamb was delicious, my wife thought the sweet potato was tasty and unusual. The third course was the real winner, the fish was delicious and her chicken was superbly spicy (even for her).  We also ordered a bature to go with it (delicious, on the thicker side, but delicious).  The fourth course desserts were tasty but not authentic.  My wife was sad they didn't have an interesting kulfi on the menu.\n\nAll in all, I think Dosa was delicious, the drinks we had were refreshing and the atmosphere is impressive.

I've had FAR better indian food than what I experienced at Dosa. Both the food and service was extremely lack luster. I went with a group of friends, really with the intention of just doing drinks and grabbing  a bite or two. \n\nSo naturally, we started at the bar, but then made our way to an actual table. We reviewed the menu, and since many of us weren't tryna order a huge meal, settled on some dosas to tide us over. the store manager was rude, rude, RUDE. He came over to take our order, and upon learning we just wanted some dosa's to go with our drinks, he kept trying to majorly upsell us. \"how about the chicken dish?\" \"what are you, vegetarian?\" \"How about this?\" \"How about that?\".... me: \"How about we just order?\". I've never felt so forced to buy something. Like... if I wanted the chicken... I would've ordered it without you breathing down my back. SO RUDE.\n\nDefinitely not coming back here. There's WAY better indian food elsewhere, especially in SF.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

My hope for trying the up and coming State Bird Provisions was immediately dashed as they were fully booked even on a Tuesday evening. Thankfully our local hosts had good alternatives, and as it was nearby we headed over to Dosa who graciously accommodated us last minute. \n\nDosa is gorgeous. It's a stunning space, the room is expansive and atmospheric with beautifully rendered art that blends old and new. In effect, it's a representation of the Southern Indian dishes available that are both authentic and modern. The food pleasantly reminded me of Vij's in Vancouver, the best Indian food I've ever had. Anywhere. This isn't quite at that level, and its not as consistent but then what is? For the most part, the food was jaw-droppingly good, though interestingly my least enjoyable dish was the namesake dosa. \n\nBefore I forget, the bread is amaaaaazing here. There is no naan (wrong part of the country), but you won't notice. Bhatura is a must order. It's a giant, light fluffy piece of edible pastry heaven. Pretty sure I could live off of it. Papadon was equally good, one of the best I've come across. Light and lovely. Paratha was also quite nice.\n\nSamosas North and South are wonderfully prepared here, perfectly crispy. Bookended with two different but equally divine sauces, especially the sweet one.\n\nLotus Stem Dayboat Scallops were exquisite. Again balanced by two ridiculously addictive sauces, this was my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nRasam Fire Broth was interestingly named, because it wasn't particularly fiery but it was extremely tasty. It had a moderate kick, but a very good and interesting flavor.\n\nRoasted Chili and Garlic Dosa was exceedingly hot. Almost unpleasantly so, but keep in mind I like moderately spicy not hair curling hot, so if you like really spicy it might be wonderful. \n\nMangalorean Prawn Masala was nicely prepared. Great flavor, nice balanced spice. Quite enjoyable.\n\nDuck Vindaloo was very good. \n\nSun Choke Uttapam wasn't that successful for my palate, possibly it was the version we chose, but I don't think I'd visit that dish again.\n\nSurprisingly we ended with a fantastic dessert. Pistachio Dacquoise with chocolate chili mousse, salted caramel and cocoa cookie. If that sounds good on paper, it was even better on the tongue. \n\nOverall, this was a delightful beginning to our trip. There's nothing like a complete lack of expectation to allow for immense pleasure, and since we knew nothing beforehand, every great moment was enhanced. Had it not been for the two missteps, this would have been an easy five star night for us. In fact, even with them it really still was for me. \n\nBest Plates: Day Boat Scallops, Rasam Fire Broth, Samosas, prawn Masala, Duck Vindaloo, Bhatura, Dosa, Pistachio Dacquoise with Chocolate Chili Mousse\n\nPalate: moderately exotic\n\nFood - A-\nAmbience - A+\nService - A-\nValue - A-", "author": "Forrest D."}

Ok, not a great start. \n\nFood was good... when it came. The service was GLACIALLY slow. We were sat, then 10 mins for someone to come over. We ordered everything at once since we had been there a while. We had a few pretty simple questions about ingredients, and the server had zero idea what was in any of the dishes. \n\nApps came out before we got wine or even water at the table. We had to ask multiple times about the wine. It was late and the bar was slammed... OK but we got a bottle can you just go snag it yourself? 20 mins for drinks is not acceptable no matter how busy it is. By the time we got started on the first dishes (once we finally got drinks) everything else started coming out all at once and they just dropped dishes all over, barely attempting to bus anything. \n\nLike I said food was very good but not worth the mediocre service.

So imagine my surprise when I got the same exact guy more than six months later, and he was possibly even worse of a server than before. My purpose is clear: the Yelp review gods have summoned me.\n\nOur group of five was seated upstairs, which I was excited for since I sat on the first floor the last time. However, our circular table was positioned smack dab in the middle of all the others, and as we settled into our seats we had to take care in dodging our neighbors' elbows and back-leans. It was just way too cramped and they should have set things up better, considering we had made a reservation.\n\nNext we dealt with Mr. Surly Server. A couple of us were new to the restaurant so someone asked if he could explain the menu (anyone who's been there or has eaten more typical North Indian dishes knows that South Indian food is pretty different). Bored, he simply suggested how many appetizers, main dishes, dosas and uttapams he thought the five of us could eat. We tried again, asking him for recommendations, and without direct eye contact he indifferently named a few. We told him we needed some time, and some of us ordered drinks. \"You?\" he head-nodded me curtly when I hadn't said anything. I told him I was fine. When really I wasn't... in fact this guy's sourpuss attitude was pissing us all off.\n\nConsistent with my first visit, the food was delectable. The dahi vada (lentil dumplings in a spicy yogurt sauce), prawn masala, and pea and paneer uttapam were my favorites. Seriously, it pains me to rate a place so low when the food is soooo good. But our server was just such a douche! While our table was bussed numerous times by staff, he never once came by to check on us the entire meal. Much to our chagrin, gratuity was added automatically. We considered asking to have it taken off, but by that point we were tired and just wanted to go. Had we been given the initial choice, we would not have tipped him. \n\nIn sum, it seems as if yummy food and a chic d\u00e9cor have allowed this restaurant to get away with some crappy service. I haven't been to Dosa on Valencia, but I'd cross my fingers that it treats its customers a little nicer and give it a try just to taste that zesty chutney again. I will not, however, return to the Fillmore location.", "author": "Kate V."}

Of course I have eaten Indian food before...many times but the highest level of sophistication has been random buffets and other locations such as \"Naan and Curry.\"\n\nNow walking into the establishment was very cool.  I love their ambiance and layout.  The only thing I might complain about is the lighting.  It's WAY too dark.  I had to use my flashlight phone app to see the details of how good the food is supposed to be.  A great restaurant should not what to hide it's pride and joy...ie - THE FOOD!  Though granted we sat upstairs on the mezzanine level.  I believe the lighting is much better at the bar and main dining area.\n\nWe started with the Idli Fries which were unique.  The outside texture starts off like any ole steak fry but the inside is soft and crumbly like rice.  Very intesting and tasty.   Nearly at the same time the FIVE Moons came (South Indian Moons).  They are 5 small vegetable pancakes with 3 dipping sauces and seemingly ginormous one...or maybe it is a chili soup?  The dipping sauces were not that fantastic but perhaps more for the subtle palate.\n\nOur mains were the duck vindaloo which is their spiciest curry (AND IT IS!) and masala.  The duck was tender and good quality though I felt the extreme spiciness of the curry left my palate burning and wondering if the duck was good.  You're probably saying I'm stupid for saying such things.  Perhaps so.  Anyways, I did still like the dish.  Probably would've gone better with their recommendation of rice instead of uttapam.  The 2nd main was masala...an super-sized pancake folded in half with a filling that tastes like the inside of a samosa.  After the 5 moons, my utappam, and now this huge pancake...I was pretty much carbed-OUT!  Ever bread item seemed to taste the same.  The filling was good but I had had enough of the breads....We were full.\n\nAs you see my ignorance of the cuisine has subverted a probably very fun time.  It's a great looking restaurant.  And I'm sure if we ordered a more diverse assortment the experience could be better next time.  Hopefully, the server could be more helpful in this regard and stop us from doing that next time.", "author": "Cary L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-03", "description": "The food here is fantastic! I love Indian food and the dishes here are very well done. The dishes I tasted were:\n\nAPPETIZER:\nThe North and South Samosas: savory pastries filled with caramelized onions and vegetables (South) and spiced potatoes (North). These were very good. The pastry was lightly crisp and the filling was hot and flavorful. I liked the Southern samosa more. The dipping sauces they come with complement the samosas very well. \n\nDahi Vada: Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind and mint, mildly spiced. Freaking delicious! The presentation is very eye catching as well and matches the amazingness of this dish. All the flavors just work so well together. Yum! You absolutely must try this. \n\nENTREE:  \nPrawn Masala with coconut rice: reduction of coconut milk, red chiles, ginger, red onions & spices. Delicious! This is a curry entree and I love curry. The medley of spices really enhanced the flavor of the prawns but none of the flavors were overwhelming each other. You can definitely taste the heat in this dish. I'd describe it as medium spicy. When you order any of the curry dishes, they don't ask you how spicy you want your food. So if you don't like spicy, make it clear to the server how hot you want your curry when you order. The whole table ordered curry dishes and they were all on the medium spicy side. \n\nDOSA (ENTREE): \nPaper Masala Dosa: This is basically a crispy crepe served with spiced Indian potatoes, onions, and cashews. This is an entree sized dish but the whole table split it. The dosa is absolutely massive. Think of a size of a log. The dosa was perfectly crisp and not at all oily. \n\nMasala Chutney Dosa: Classic masala dosa spread with spiced chutney of blended baby eggplant. I don't have much to say on this dish. It was just okay for me. Slightly too salty. \n\nDESSERT: \nDark Chocolate Cake: topped with creme brulee, over 3-spice creme anglaise. All their desserts have an Indian flair with spices to enhance the flavors. The chocolate cake was pretty good. One of the spices is star of anise. Unfortunately, I found that out the hard way. They garnished the dish with a whole clove and I ate it thinking it was chocolate! Ick! Not pleasant. It's like eating a piece of licorice flavored wood. If you order this, don't pop the star shaped object into your mouth because I had to spit it back out. The star of anise is found in chunks in your cake. I think the cake would've tasted much better if it were infused in powder form. It just didn't work as well for me because of the textural difference and feeling random bits of spice stuck on my tongue. Aside from that, everything else was good. \n\nI'd recommend coming here if you're looking for a more upscale Indian restaurant. Good for a date night or catching up with friends. The ambiance is very trendy. Think dim lighting, cocktails, beautiful people, elegant Indian decor with a lot of soft browns and gold, and plush leather chairs. The chairs were soooo comfortable. You just sink right in and you won't want to get back up. The service is okay. Our water glasses were constantly filled. The food takes awhile to come out so have some patience. The bathrooms were also clean. As far as pricing goes, I felt that it was reasonable for the quality of the food and the area. Definitely check this out if you're looking for a fine dining experience around Japantown.", "author": "Nancy C."}

We were immediately seated in a cramped two person table between a couple on a date and a family with a little girl who kept coming to close for comfort. Not an ideal set up for our date night. \n\nMy Man saw a table in the corner open up so we switched seats. Much better. The server at our first table had informed us he didn't eat Indian food when we asked him about the menu. *forehead scratching, what?* The server at our other table was much better. He was helpful answered our questions and had some great suggestions. \n\nWe started with the North & South Samosas. I loved the northern samosa and thought that the southern one all though still good was filled with too much onion. We ordered the Chennai Chicken, which tasted like amazing spicy boneless chicken wings with an Indian flare.  The mint dipping sauce was yummy! \n\nNext came our main courses. The Lamb Kofta Balls were a little dry on the inside but the sauce on the outside was still amazing. The Coconut Jasmine Rice that accompanied it was delicious. The dosa was like a thick crepe filled with cheese. It was a little too rich for me but still good and it paired well with the dipping sauces. \n\nAfter our dinner came our server switched (which I totally hate). We ended up getting the server we started with. This coupled with my full tummy made us skip our dessert which I seldom do at a new place. \n\nOverall the place has a great vibe and the food is yummy but we will probably just come back for drinks and appetizers at the bar.", "author": "Caro S."}

Our waitress did a good job of picking out a variety of food and did an excellent job of staggering out when each course came. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice, and there's plenty of seating on both levels. I had a couple beers with my meal, but some of the cocktails on the menu sounded delicious (I DID peruse the drink menu...of course)!

Our waitress was very helpful and patient serving 12 people & and we had no issues (and I believe no extra charge) for cake service (the birthday boy's parents brought in there own cake).

I arrived seconds before she did around 5:45 and we were seated immediately at the communal table near the bar (we were the first to sit at this giant table).\nI didn't read any yelp reviews prior, so I only knew it was going to be Indian food. When I peered at the menu, I was a little bit shocked to see the prices (~$30 for curry). Since it was my first time, I only wanted to test the waters and thankfully my friend didn't intend on eating a full dinner either. We each got one drink and shared an order of lamb keema dosa, which was super delicious. It was flavorful without being overwhelming, and it didn't make my stomach hurt like most Indian food did afterwards. Also my friend got the peony gin cocktail, which she swears by. I'm totally getting that next time. I got a virgin drink that had mint and a bunch of stuff in it, reminded me of a mojito.\nWhat really blew me away was our waiter. I think he worked at the bar. Even though we didn't order a whole lot for a typical evening at Dosa, he still was super nice and friendly. He even asked complimented me on my nail polish and asked about who did it.

We were there 1:42 and were told to wait and we waited until well past 2pm to be seated. Bad start. The place looks decent, nice a big, but the seating is squished into a smaller section of the large room and hence is quite congested. The tables are quite close to each other and we could eat right off the plate of our neighbor if we wanted to. \n\nNow granted this is not rare and there are several places with space constraints, but not Dosa, they have a huge area in the center going completely waste. They could've easily spaced the tables out more and made things a bit more comfortable.\n\nWe placed our order for 1 Vada pav (clearly stated one, not two), a Thali and dosas. \n\nThe Dosa's looked decent enough, price is a bit high, sambar was flavorful but lacked body, chutney was \"okay\" have had better more innovative ones. The Masala was completely devoid of any flavor at all, its just a huge pile of BIG chunks of boiled potatoes. This is not how its done, a good dosa masala has smaller chunks, green chillies and a lovely hint of spices and heat, with ginger giving a finishing kick. \n\nOnto the veggie thali, This one is a complete head scratcher. It comes with one small cup of rice (this makes no sense whatsoever, rice is the core ingredient in a thali that holds the whole thing together, in India, the rice is not even served on the plate so as to not fill up the plate, its either on the side on a large bowl or served seperately by someone who will give you as much as you want!)\n\nThe combination of dishes on the thali made no sense either. There was one idly (again makes no sense, not only is Idly usually not served in a thali, no one gives ONE idly, its practically unheard of). One uthapam which was decent tasting, but then there was what appeared to be a Veg Kurma which wouldnt go with anything on the plate. \n\nThen a really odd tasting Pineapple Pachadi (Pineapple with Yogurt based sauce) which was really absurd tasting and one vegetable, yogurt, sambar and a sweet. All small quanitities, which is sort of ok but badly thought out. Its quite clear the person has possibly never had a Thali in a South Indian restaurant before. You have a certain order in which you eat  a Thali, and hence the dishes are all laid out in a logical manner to accompany the base items (Roti, dosa, rice) and you move along one after the other until you complete all dishes and end with the dessert, instead here we were left with hardly enough to make sense and unsatisfied.\n\nWe got our appetizer midway through eating our dishes and were given 2 Vada pavs instead of 1. This was actually quite tasty, but had way too much grease from butter/ghee and hence hardly qualifies as an appetizer IMO, especially if its served after main course!\n\nOverall, its really nice to see someone bring South Indian cuisine with a fine dining approach, and while the namesake Dosa is decent, the core taste, culture and tradition seems to be lost. Sure modern day Restaurants requires everyone to come up with creative dishes to stand out and make an impact, but you need to get the basics right and the core concepts and ideals correct and then improvise on top. Clearly this person is filling a niche and taking advantage of pricing the cuisine beyond anywhere its been, but not quite comprehending the core cuisine.\n\nPrice : 1/5\nAmbience : 2/5\nFood : 2/5\nService : 2/5\n\nOverall 2/5", "author": "Rekha A."}

I ordered a white truffle masala dosa, which was really really tasty.  Very mild, which is good for me because I'm a lame-o when it comes to spicy things.  They also give you dipping sauce for it if you want that - one was spicy, and the other was mild, so it was really good.  It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it, at least for the dosas.", "author": "Jenna L."}

I wanted to shout that out because that can be hard to come by, and it definitely adds to your Indian experience. I dined here with a large group, and they were accommodating and able to handle the party with ease. \n\nThis is definitely a fancier Indian experience, not your hole in the wall Mom and Pop spot, and that tends to make me nervous, but I am happy to say the food was delicious. We started with samosas that were fresh and spicy, and the rest of the table happily inhaled some sardines!\n\nFor my main course, I had the seasonal vegetable curry, and I had no problem finishing every last drop happily. It was filled with large, fresh vegetables, and for $13, I thought it was a good deal especially for a SF dinner. \n\nNote: They are true to your spice requests, so they will definitely kick it up if you like heat.

The owner is from East India not South. The food is totally different in the two regions. There are only a couple of South Indian cooks. Look in the kitchen they are the dark skinned ones. You will only see maybe 2. All the other cooks were your typical Mexican or Chinese looking. Most of the patrons were white. White people in an Indian restaurant is not a good sign. Indians go to really good Indian restaurants, Indians know how to cook and are not going to pay to eat lousy food.

You definitely get your money's worth and most have a unique twist that you won't find many other places, many drinks making use of Indian spices or flavors.

For the food itself I don't even know where to begin. It is best to get several dishes and eat them family style. It is absolutely necessary to try the namesake and get a dosa.

I would consider this restaurant more of an Indian fusion restaurant than just  an Indian restaurant, but that's not a negative at all. The food is South Indian, so it's not the same kind of food you're going to get in most Indian places which typically serve Northern Indian food.\n\nThe reservation website said that everything was full when we tried to make a reservation several days in advance. When we called to inquire whether we could get in for Saturday they told us the internet system has errors sometimes and that if we got there at 5:15 we would most likely be able to get seated at 5:30, when dinner service starts. We got there around 5 and went to the bar. I ordered a cocktail with rum and ginger. It was delicious and you could hardly taste the liquor, though I definitely could feel the effects. We were seated at 5:30 almost on the nose.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered a variety of dishes. I tried a little of everything. I personally ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Soup (which was everything I had hoped for) and the Masala Dosa. I think the Masala Dosa could have been a touch spicier, but I am saying this as someone who can tolerate a lot of heat with Indian foods. The Masala Dosa is the standard dosa, though they had other varieties to choose from. If you've never had a dosa, you really should. It is a large piece of very flat, crunchy bread that is folded over with a filling in the middle. The filling of the Masala Dosa is potatoes and vegetables with curry spices. You dip the dosa into different dips - at Dosa they provide you with a tomato dip, a mint dip, and a lentil dipping soup.\n\nMy brother and my dad ordered the tasting menu, which is a $35 3-course tasting menu. You get a smaller version of the appetizer, an entree, and a dosa/uttapam (the uttapam is a thicker pancake with different toppings). The duck vindaloo we were told was the spiciest curry in the house. It was definitely not too spicy and was absolutely delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful. It's low-lit, there's a lot of fancy light decorations, and while the music is loud, it's not overpowering. Rather than the standard Indian music you would expect in most Indian restaurants, there was a lot of pop/R&B music playing. But given the ambiance of the restaurant, it seemed to fit perfectly.\n\nThis was a great place for my birthday dinner and a place I would absolutely go back.", "author": "Ellie C."}

Loved it at first, not anymore -- I think they're getting complacent.  \n\nOur most recent experience suggested that service and food prep both need rejuvenation. Four of us were in the neighborhood this past Tuesday evening (March 10) and called around 7 p.m. about a table. We were told over the phone that yes, a table was available if we showed up soon. Easy enough, and it was true. But soon after arrival we were told that we only had 1-1/2 hours before the table was needed for a reservation. It's unprofessional to set a time limit on tables, especially when the service turns out to be slow and mistake prone. We had to remind our server several times about the exact dishes that we ordered, and despite our request for straightforward coursing the dishes were brought to us haphazardly. Our drinks arrived well after the first (partial) set of dishes, and then it took a very long time for the additional dishes to arrive. The drinks were weaker and the dishes blander than I remembered, and due to the erratic service several dishes were served well below the ideal temperature. Our server maintained a very cheerful demeanor throughout this comedy of errors -- frankly, a bit of contrition would have been nice (we *were* comped an extra dish, which did us little good at that point). And to top it all off, the food made my wife queasy later in the evening (a very rare occurrence!).\n\nAll of this suggests a restaurant that's getting sloppy in its complacency. They're riding a built-in clientele wave at the moment, but if they don't tighten up the operation soon, they will have problems. I can't recommend it at this point.\n\nUPDATE ON 3-14 (next day):  I received a very nice message from the restaurant (presumably a manager), apologizing and extending an offer if/when I visit again.  That's definitely a plus, so I added a star to my review, to make it 3 (neutral to my mind). Other recent reviews suggest that my experience was somewhat unusual, and it's reassuring that the restaurant directly addresses customer satisfaction.", "author": "Rob V."}

The owner reached out to me regarding my A-OK review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. I literally live 4 blocks away so my roommates and I stopped by here on Tuesday night for dinner.\n\nTheir dinner offerings were excellent. All the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. We got the following:\n\nChaat -- Mangos in chaat? Who would have thought. Apparently this is a South Indian norm to put fruit in chaat and I don't know why us Northerners haven't picked up on how good that is.\nDahi Vada -- Amazing presentation and great taste. They really know how to take Indian street food and make it classy\nPakora -- To be fair, I'm not a fan of these generally so I have a bit of a bias against this dish. Clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard.\n\nPaper Masala Dosa -- Solid traditional dosa dish. Ask for extra of the orange chutney. Nom.\nBasil Dosa -- 3/4 of us are Indian and have grown up with all this goodness. This dosa made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. It's like pesto meets masala. Very good.\nChanna Batura -- Seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. INSANE. The channa was excellent. The batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried.\n\nNeedless to say, I definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular.

I'd visited both Dosa locations in the past and had a preference for the Valencia location because it felt cosier and more inviting. I'd commented to several friends in the past that although the Fillmore location looks nice, the combination of the high ceiling and the size of the restaurant makes it feel less private and more exposed.\n\nHowever, on my most recent visit I was seated in a little area on the second floor just next to/behind the bar. Sitting up in that area I felt far more cozy and far less exposed. (It would also be an ideal place to people watch.)\n\nThe food at both locations is good. As their name implies, they make many different kinds of dosas, but they also a few other dishes like curries.

From the moment I entered, I smelled a familiar aroma that assured me that I was not going to regret this experience.\n\nFIrst off, we went around 8 and maybe because it was a weeknight, we did not need a reservation. To start things off, we ordered some Mango Lassis. These didn't taste like the Lassis I've had in India or Sri Lanka, but they were still pretty good. We then received some complimentary papadum which was good (to be fair though, it's really difficult to screw up papadum).\n\nSo for the main dish, I ordered the Paper Masala Dosa since it was on the 7x7 list while my housemate ordered the South Indian Moons Uttapam. For both dishes, we were amazed by the presentation. The Paper Masala Dosa was so long that they had a difficult time figuring out how to place it on the table. As for the South Indian Moons, it was the envy of all the tables surrounding us as we had constant questions from those around us asking what that dish was.

But Saturday night when my friend and I arrived right on time for our 8:45pm reservation we were told they're running 10 minutes behind, unfortunately 10 minutes turned to 45 which was annoying and we were hungry.  I might accept this at a new restaurant but at this point they should be experienced enough to not have issues like these and plan better.  \n\nSince she knows the owner and he was apologizing for the wait, she mentioned we should get a few glasses of wine on him, being that we are regular customers and by that I mean we come at least once a month.  He said he'll send something out and the host said that they would send out an appetizer on the house.  Unfortunately neither happened and then the waitress told us to save room for dessert because that was on the house.  Unfortunately we had no intention of ordering desserts since we were full, but we got two of them and had a few obligatory bites.\n\nLesson, here, don't promise things and don't deliver and if a regular client is a bit annoyed and asks for wine on the house, it's probably a good idea to do that, it's a good idea to do it regardless as a practice if someone with a reservation is waiting 45 minutes to sit down, and we shouldn't have to ask.\n\nNow on the food, we had the vegetarian slides, which were amazing, we could have had more of them, they were tender, flavorful, unique in taste and just an amazing culinary surprise.  \n\nThe duck I had was very forgettable and not up to par with the other dishes I've had here.  The tomato rice was good, the duck itself was cooked to perfection and falling off the bone, but the sauce had no flavor, it didn't taste like spinach and was too refined and creamy and lacked texture.  The cheese chunks were odd in size, they were long and rectangular, at first when I cut into one I thought it was the duck.  \n\nWill we return?  Of course!

I came with a friend for dine about town and so we went off the pre fixe menu. The scallops were deliciously spicy but you only get 2, the chennai chicken was ok - chewy, basically boneless chicken wings - ended up handing those over for my friend to finish. As for the main courses the mango & paneer dosa was kindof blah - like a crispy pancake filled with cheese that you dip in a bunch of sauces, and the tomato & onion uttapam looked exactly like an omelette with veggies - tasty but small. The pepper chicken curry was delicious but by this point I was stuffed with wine and the appetizers and would have preferred a dessert option instead. \n\nAs for the wine, the $18 tasting flight is a rip off as we were told you only get about the equivalent of one glass of wine. So we ordered a bottle of one of the less expensive redson the menu (still 40 something) and it was barely drinkable, but we didn't want to be those people and send it back. \n\nI suppose if you have the money and/or a special occasion this would be a great place. I'm a big fan of the open and airy space with upstairs seating and service was excellent, but not sold on the whole dosa concept. Major negative points for the SF health tax.

This is expensive, but where are you going to go and find a upscale restaurant with high-end decor that offers traditional south indian food that is healthy. \n\nI frequent Darbar in Palo Alto and that restaurant pales in comparison to DOSA. I have never been to a South Indian, or any Indian restaurant that serves healthy meals and uses organic or locally sourced ingredients and free-range meats. \n\nDOSA is by far the best south indian restaurants I have visited because of how they prepare their dishes. Most places you go, the dosas are beyond greasy, the \"masala\" (spiced potato filling) is either bland or too spicy and lacks in complexity of flavors. DOSA makes their masala dosa's with your health in mind. The dosa I received was amazing, the filling was delicious and the chutney served along side the sambar was amazing. \n\nOnce thing to note: the sambar is super spicy, however, this is to be expected with south indian food. I had two bowls of it and wanted more, but my tongue was already on fire. This is not the restaurants fault, this is traditional south indian cooking at its finest. the only negative was that the sambar was a little heavy on the tamarind, though I didn't complain as I loved the gorgeous color.  \n\nWe also ordered the Kale Pakora (we ordered two rounds of it) and that was equally amazing. \n\nThe couple who started this restaurant knows what they are doing and understands their clientele.

Though I forgot about the release part and almost got my hand stuck as the door pushed against the wall --- apparently I was still trying to come to terms with the age-old question of \"where is the door\" that I clean forgot to follow up my \"pull\" with my \"release\".\n\nOnce inside, I was told a table would take a few minutes and was offered a place at the \"communal table\" which was a not unlike a bar counter with height tables and high chairs; except, no bar tender --- but fret not, there is a full bar mere feet away from where you would have parked your hiney. This location is much roomier and has a more relaxed atmosphere than the one at Valencia. It has a 'loungey' feel with it's soft lighting while it's sister is perennially crying out for space. \n\nAfter wrestling with the idea of trying a crab vada against my age-old favorite of \"medu vada\" for an appetizer, I decided to go for \"change I can believe in\" and opted for the crab vada. I mean, what else screams \"liberal\" more than that. Right ? The crab vada was close to a crab cake without actually being a crab cake. It certainly had a South Indian essence to it which I can't quite put a finger on, but the batter seemed to suggest more \"pakoda\" (batter of chickpea flour) than \"vada\" (based on rice and lentils batter). The swirl of mint and tamarind chutney on the spotless white plate lent the presentation a touch of class a la fine-dining restaurants that are one level above on the price-point hierarchy. After all is said and done, the crab vada was good but I prefer my good ol' medu vada and medu vada would be it the next time around.\n\nThe famed Masala Dosa followed up as my entree and it did not disappoint. The dosa was crispy, well done and just about right; something that it's sister concern (or, the \"mother ship\") on Valencia failed to get right on all my visits there. In the dosa face-off between 'mother ship' and 'sister concern', the race is tight since the \"sambhar\" here could not possibly hold a candle against that served at the Valencia Establishment which, to this day, I consider \"the best Sambhar in the world\".\n\nSo, why 3 stars? Well for one, there is the Sambhar which failed to measure up to my sky high expectations, and the crab vada which was good but not 4- or 5- stars good. If the Medu vada lives up to my expectations on my next visit, coupled with my lowered expectations of the Sambhar, I'd definitely rate it 4 stars.\n\nSo, yes, you go ahead and rate it 4 stars; it is well deserved.

Unfortunately our time at this restaurant was a major disappointment from start to finish, and will linger in our minds as one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had.  Prior to coming in we had made and confirmed  a reservation through the dining room manager, Dan, for fourteen people at seven thirty in the evening, yet when we arrived at the restaurant we were told that a reservation was made for only eight people by the host ( a man wearing a black hat and a goatee) who had a very combative attitude and demeanor towards my uncle. We were told to wait and after some time we finally got a table for all of our party ; this negative incident set the tone for the rest of the evening which only got progressively worse as it went on. We started off with the Chennai Chicken for appetizers which had an extremely odd texture and a batter that was not particularly noteworthy and quite bland. The Chicken Biryani was flavorless, and did not taste at all like what a proper biryani should taste like. The prawn masala was passable however it was still very mediocre ; perhaps the most disappointing dish of all however, were the lamb chops which not only fell short of the proper marination  but it also had a very off putting taste of raw and uncooked spices that made the dish highly unenjoyable for our palettes. The food that we ate at this restaurant was so unexceptional,forgettable and flavorless  that we would never even think of considering to come back to this place. The chef ( if there is one) needs proper training to bring out the delectable flavors that are commonly found in great Indian cuisine.Pseudo concoctions of spices, are not acceptable in an establishment where the prices are so lavishly expensive. We have no problem paying any amount provided that the food is in par with the prices being charged. While  our waiter ( Forest) was attentive and did his job well, what we found to be even worse than the food at this restaurant was how we were treated towards the end of our meal. We completed eating our meal, but my father was still finishing his drink of Gin and Tonic when we were abruptly and quite rudely told to leave by the host who was a gentleman wearing a black  hat and had a goatee, because apparently according to him there were   too many people waiting to be seated and we were occupying space . We were absolutely flabbergasted by the way that we were treated ; no one should be disrupted from their dining experience and be told to leave and especially not when it was obvious that we were clearly not done and ready to go. Considering the exorbitant  amount of money  we payed to eat here ($646.73), the host service and food that we received was not acceptable on any level. While the ambiance at this restaurant was beautiful, the subpar food combined with the disrespectful way that we were treated has left us with a very bad taste in our mouth and we will not be returning in the future. This is very typical of an absentee owner ( Anjan Mitra) who is ambitious to expand his empire without any desire or passion to maintain and perfect the establishments that he already has. I highly recommend that the owner should retrain his staff and read the book Setting the Table by Danny Meyers, which is a must read for all of the staff in order to fully grasp and understand the basic and critical nuances of the hospitality industry.", "author": "Zareen A."}

To begin with, it's a beautiful restaurant - stylish decor, but didn't seem pretentious. I started with a sweet mango lassi, which was super tasty. My boyfriend, two friends, and I split the Samosas South and North for an appetizer, a selection of five different types of uttapams, the paneer and peas dosa, and the lamb kofta. Everything was so good - the lentil dipping sauce, the chutneys, the fresh veggies and cheeses. We ended with gulab jamon and chocolate chai ice cream - save room for dessert and you will not regret it.\n\nIt was also really easy to get to via bus from Union Square.", "author": "Deb G."}

I've had my eye on this place to try for quite some time and was glad I got a chance to finally head out here.  I've always had Indian food with naan so Southern Indian cuisine which uses dosa and uttapam was something new for me.  For the newbies, dosa is more of a thin crepe while uttapam a slightly thicker version of the dosa.  \n\nWalking in I was impressed with the decor and ambiance of the place.  Great bar area that had a long communal table you can use if you were just there for drinks and appetizers.  There also appears to be an upstairs too which is probably opens up for dinner service.\n\nI looked over the DAT menu and decided on the chennai chicken and the dosa cilantro mint masala.  Per the suggestion from the waitress we also decided to order an additional appetizer of dahi vadha.\n\nDahi Vadha:  Super refreshing!  This dish was lentil dumplings served with yogurt and spices.  This plate was probably one of my favorites.  This dish was totally different then what I expected.  It was a plate of dough that covered the bottom of the plate with the yogurt on top.  Using a spoon you just scooped out your portion.  I can totally see this dish being served on hot day.  \n\nChennai Chicken:  Another win for their appetizer menu.  Chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  The chicken was also served with a yogurt sauce that you dipped the chicken in.  Loved this dish since the chicken was so deliciously flavored.  With each bite you can taste all the different spices that were used.\n\nDosa Cilantro Mint Masala:  Now this is where Dosa really disappointed me.  The cilantro and mint spread in the dosa was extremely salty.  If it wasn't for the tomato and coconut chutney (a dipping sauce) I probably wouldn't have been able to eat much of my dosa.  The sambar (dipping lentil soup) was also extremely salty.  I could only probably eat about half of my dosa before the saltiness of the dish got to me.  \n\nService:  Just like our meals, service started out great and just failed at the end.  Our appetizers and drinks came out quickly but our entrees took forever to come.  Our waitress didn't even bother to come by apologize or let us know why our dishes were taking so long.\n\nI really wished I could have given this place a better rating since the appetizers were so delicious!  If I ever come back here, I'll most likely just stick to the appetizers and drinks at the bar.", "author": "Jenny H."}

Many are familiar with Indian food, including naan, curries, tikkas, etc.  However, people are not as familiar with Southern Indian fare such as dosas.  A dosa is a thin crispy crepe-like dish with curried potatoes in it... they are fantastic!  And while these are usually best found at hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurants, Dosa is an exception to the rule.  This place is a great place to enjoy some delicious Southern Indian food that has a slightly more upscale ambiance.  Good food, nice atmosphere, makes for a wonderful sit down spot for some lunch or dinner with friends.\n\nSouthern Indian food is not just excellent for their dosas, but for their other dishes as well!  If you are not sure what to order, I recommend the Masala Dosa, Channa Bhatura, some Uttapam (get the Uttapam variety plate if you're not sure which you want to try!), and Dahi Vada.  These were all delicious, and some great ways to experiment with Southern Indian food!", "author": "Carol L."}

I was expecting this place to blow my mind; instead it just barely registered as okay. \n\nCame here on a Wednesday night with a reservation for two and was seated after about 5 minutes despite the place looking quite empty around 7 pm. The ambiance is definitely nice and the hostess was friendly, but they sat us in the smallest table ever and my friend isn't exactly the kind to fit into small spaces. So we requested a bigger table and was surprised (given the emptiness of the place) that she had to check with the hostess. \n\nAfter being seated we were brought out their house appetizer and water very quickly and was asked about our selections for the evening. However, our waitress, after much debate, actually advised against me ordering all of the items I wanted to order on the menu claiming that it would be too much food. I was never given this concept in my life so I figured I might as well trust her. Later on I ended up ordering my original menu because there was not enough food.\n\nI have to say this place has its up's but I am pretty surprised at the waitress telling me that I would have too much food when clearly their portions are TINY. I do mean very small for an Indian place and definitely not something I expected to see. We ordered samosas for appetizers and it came with two (one of each kind from \"north\" and \"south\") ... this was the beginnings of my question about how this could possibly be too much food since when you order a variety they don't even give you more than one?\n\nFurthermore, the thicker \"dosas\" were definitely not as good as their original dosas and most of their dishes (unless its masala based) are not good. We ordered one entree each and the non-masala entree, although sounded great, was definitely a miss. \n\nOther than that, they have great sauces and great dipping \"soups\". Their lemon rice was good and their egg dosa was definitely delicious. \n\nI don't know that I would come back to pay this kind of price for the kind of stuff I could get with a much better attitude at a hole in the wall Indian place instead.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

I had to keep moving my seat so the server could get to the tables next to us which had like 4\" of space between and anyone leaving the far right hand corner table I had to almost get out of my seat for. It was like being in a tiny cramped movie theater. I would not sit there again. The floors on the bottom level were so NOT heel friendly and slippery that I was holding onto my friend.

My date and I ordered the Chennai Chicken, the Green Mango & Paneer Dosa, and the South Indian Moons Uttapam. The chicken was pretty good, albeit spicier than I'd have liked (although I'm a wimp about that). The dosa was alright, but neither my date nor I could taste the mango. In fact, I thought the whole thing was on the bland side, without any flavors that stood out. The uttapam, which came with a variety of different kinds, wasn't much better.

We went here for my birthday dinner, on our one day visit in San Fran. The decor is fun and fancy, with gorgeous orange textures and flowing flowery chandeliers dripping down from the twenty foot high ceilings, which were delightfully sparkly when the sun went down to showcase the fiber optic light display from said chandeliers. So cool.\n\nThe menu was intimidating for me. I'm used to northern Indian food (or southern?) and this is the opposite - no naan (sniff!) but the poori and bhatura were effing amazing and I didn't miss the naan at all. We all could have made a meal out of those alone, but I'm glad we held out because what followed proved to be an unbelievable romp for our taste buds. I would have had to study and agonize over the strange offerings for a long time had it not been for our absolutely delightful and very helpful waitress, Marlece. she walked us through her faves on the menu (with exclamations like \"jiminy crickets, the lamb!!) and explained everything for us and made recommendations for the best selections for our first Dosa experience. She was fantastic, kudos to the restaurant for nabbing her, she's a gem.\n\nOur dining experience:\n\nKale pakora- fun, battered fried kale chips, essentially. Good, but I wouldn't bother again... Save room for the rest.\nChennai chicken. Holy moly. Intense flavor, packs some serious heat. Delicious, but it couldn't eat to many. Best shared with others - Everyone loved  them.\nSamosas - one from the north, one from the south. One packed a bit more heat than the other but both were reliably delicious. \nPrawn masala - I don't do seafood, but the guys at the table politely fought over the last bites of that, so I suppose it was a hit. I did eat some of the coconut rice that came with it, and it was yummy.\nGreen mango and paneer dosa - Hands down the winner of the meal. Sooooooooooo delicious and sweet and tangy with awesome texture. It's served like a crepe. And oh so good.\nMasala dosa - the classic, as Marlece put it - a must for the first timer. Potatoey goodness in a huge crepe like thing with three delicious sauces to dip into... Lentil soup was my fave.\nLamp chops - apparently marinated in yogurt, these fell off the bone into the mouth, packed a fair amount of heat with immense flavor. Definitely a memorable and awesome dish... I was so full at that point, but kept at it, and it was worth it and then some!\n\nDessert was banana chocolate gelato yummmmmmmm and homemade chai, better than any chai I've ever tasted (full disclosure, I've never been to India, but Marlece said the chefs make this for themselves to drink. Such an awesome treat, although all other chais will probably pale in comparison, and so perhaps this one ruined my chai habit... Time will tell) (I should also say, the caffeine in the  chai kicked my food coma in the arse and now here I am, writing this epic review, so perhaps not the best choice for after dinner??)\n\nI loved this place. I'll be back someday, on some future visit to the area. Thanks to Marlece and everything about Dosa for capping off a lovely and memorable birthday!", "author": "Pam A."}

He looked flustered and she told him that our friend that she was splitting the meal with would eat the veggies with mago, but could he please bring another plate of veggies without mango. He said sure, but did not once apologize. I thought maybe because he was not apologetic they would comp the meal or discount our overall bill. They did neither.

However, I'm a sucker for ambience and didn't mind this particularly because its a good excuse to bring others to introduce them to south indian cuisine in a cool atmosphere where you can sample dosas in a variety of american and indian flavors.

Until I found Dosa I thought I had experienced Indian food. I had only experienced half of what the sub continent has to offer.\n\nDosa is Southern Indian and although some of the spices are very similar to Northern Indian cuisine, the whole experience is quite different and, I have to say, refreshingly so.\n\nEverything we had was awesome, so much so that we both overindulged. \n\nStarting with their papadum and chutney sampler, we knew we were in for a treat. We actually accepted the very kind offer for more papadums just to keep sampling the chutneys and when the waiter wanted to clear them away we asked for them to stay throughout the meal.\n\nThe actual dosas are so enormous that we opted for 2 of their smaller sibling called poori not wanting to fill up on bread. Next time we will get a dosa but hopefully we will have others to share it with. They really are enormous.\n\nWe had prawn masala, Tamil lamb, and lamb chops because we couldn't get enough of the lamb which was really tender and juicy with incredible spices. Another interesting dish was the dahi rice which is more the equivalent of raita in the north and not really a rice dish per se. Necessary though as a cooling dish to compliment the spices. Without a dosa one really needs a rice dish so we opted for basmati just because all the dishes had so much really tasty sauce which we could not send back.\n\nThe drink menu eat Dosa is extensive and I was very happy to find a selection of wines that compliment the food really well. A bottle of Saarstein Riesling did not disappoint. Initially I thought that it may be too sweet, although advertised as off dry, but as the dinner progressed and the spices built, it turned out to be another perfect cooling element.\n\nOur server, Mike, was excellent and thoroughly understood our tastes. He suggested the lamb chops when we ordered an extra dish late in the dinner, and it was a perfect addition. \n\nLooking forward to our next visit to Dosa when we will definitely get one even if it requires a doggie bag!", "author": "Michael W."}

I had sampled a little bit of a truffle dosa on a Japantown food tour, and wanted to come back and get the full dinner experience. Hubby and I started off with the duck taco appetizer, which was yummy, and had won some award for best taco in SF. It was spicy and unique, and we loved it. They also gave us pappadam to munch on while waiting for our food. The pappadam wafers were light and crispy and yummy. We had a fabulous guy who was not our server, but clearing tables and checking on people. He was so accommodating and brought me tamarind sauce for my pappadam, because that is my favorite dipping sauce. I plowed through so many pappadam, that he refilled our basket and brought more sauce. Hubby got the mushroom uttapam and I got the truffle dosa I'd been dreaming about. Both were excellent. Again, our wonderful guy came by with extra sauces and also boxed up our left over food and put extra tamarind sauce in there for me. It's not often that somebody goes so above and beyond that I feel I have to give an extra tip for the service, but this guy deserved it. I don't know how they split the tips with the main servers, but I wanted to make sure this guy got a little recognition for being so awesome. Our server was very sweet too, and it was a great dining experience all around. I love the swanky look and feel of this restaurant and highly recommend it for excellent South Indian cuisine.

We also tried the samosas which were fried to a perfect crisp with flavor that popped, and the chennai chicken which had the perfect amount of spice and came with a delightful yogurt dip. We tried one of the dosas, but unfortunately I have no clue which one it was. Ours had potatoes and some great spices in it, which yummy sauces and lentil soup to eat it with. For the main course, my friend and I split the prawn masala with the coconut rice. The portion was perfect to be split with two. I've only had chicken tikka masala before, but it tasted amazing with the prawns. The sauce was perfectly rich and creamy, with a mind-blowing bold flavor. I would recommend this dish 1000000 times.

We way over-ordered, and I apologize for all of the food that had to be wasted.  :(\n\n[[ Mango Prawns ]] came with 6 giant prawns and 3 mango chunks.  Sweet and mildly tangy, it was perfect with a side of coconut rice which comes with shredded coconut - and wow, when I realized that, I hit a food high.\n\n[[ South Indian Moons ]] - a selection of five different uttapams.  One was more bland than the rest (it was mostly flavored with diced tomatoes).  One was a little more spicy with some peppers of the green variety.

The food, sadly, was just a typical example of oily, bland, heavy indian food.  \n\nIdli Sambar:  This was like a heavy donut served with a lentil soup.  It was just way too heavy for an appetizer.  My husband and I shared it.  The donut part wasn't particularly flavorful and neither was the soup.  \n\nSpring Vegetable:  Again, way too oily and too bland.  \n\nSeasonal Spring Uttapam:  This is a thicker version of the dosa. I've never had dosa before so perhaps this was a good example of one, however, i just wasn't impressed.  It was served with \"sambar\" which I didn't realize was just the same bland oily lentil soup we had with our appetizer.  \n\nI shared the above dishes with my husband and we just felt full and not great after this meal.

Overall, we enjoyed it, and I would probably go back, but with a couple of caveats.\n\nThe Good: The happy hour appetizers we tried (the kale pakora and vegetarian sliders) were really, really good. And at the $6 happy hour price, no regrets. I enjoyed the sweet potato dosa we got, though my husband was a bit less enthusiastic. The cocktail menu is fascinating. Only tried one--the peony--but it was absolutely delicious--tasted like melted sorbet or something. I usually can't drink gin anymore, but it didn't even taste like gin. Dangerous! I'd love to try some of the other special cocktails, but at $12 a pop, you really do have to limit yourself. The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. Everything we tried was tasty, though the prices are too high. Our waiter was nice, helpful, attentive. There is a parking garage right next door, and since it's run by the city, it's only $1/hour--a good find in the City of No Parking.\n\nThe Bad: Overpriced. The lamb tamil tasted good, but it was a tiny serving for $26, plus you have to order rice or dosa with it as a side (they don't really give you the option not to) and that adds an extra $3-5 to that $26 plate. It definitely wasn't good enough (or substantial enough) to be worth $30. (We get one at a hole-in-the-wall down the street that's just as good or better for $8.) In fact, everything on the menu is pretty much a la carte and too expensive (besides the happy hour appetizers!). The bartender was really rude. I didn't feel like he was overly rude to us (though my husband did--I guess he's more sensitive), just not overly nice either, but he was definitely rude to someone who came and sat down on the other side of us. This person was trying to order something from him as he was making some drinks, and instead of politely telling him something like, \"I'll be right with you,\" he snapped, \"I'm not ready for that.\" With attitude. Even though he didn't do anything like that to us, the attitude was definitely, \"I'm doing you a favor by answering your question or taking your order.\" I can do without the attitude. I have been a server/bartender and I know when you're busy it can be tempting to be short with customers, but it's unacceptable. I never did it and I don't expect my servers/bartenders to do it to me. But, like I said, our waiter at our table was great, and the hostesses were fine as well. The happy hour drink menu is only for one beer, two wines and a margarita, all $6 except the beer (which is $4). That is a decent (but not amazing) price for those drinks, but it was disappointing that there wasn't some kind of discount on their awesome cocktails during happy hour...but fine, whatever. The happy hour food menu sort of makes up for that, I guess. \n\nI guess you are paying for the experience as much as the food itself, and we did have a nice evening, but I don't see it becoming a regular spot for us.", "author": "Jennie S."}

I was really looking forward to something special but only came away with a costly credit card receipt and feeling quite unsatisfied.\n\nBeautiful space. They did a good job with building out the restaurant.  Take a tip restaurants... if you offer shared/family style dining... use tables that are 25% larger than standard.  The 4 of us were in a constant battle to complete dishes quickly or to move food from one serving plate to another to make way for other dishes. It was almost comical.  We were lucky enough to be seated in one of the handful of tables by the window only to be rewarded with a view of the Burger King across the street.  Perhaps a 3 foot glazing of the bottom of the windows would make a more intimate setting.\n\nService was decent. Friendly but not very helpful in selecting dishes.  My experience with Indian cuisine is limited.  The server didn't really offer much in guidance.  We asked about dishes and she gave a uniform OK on them.  \n\nFood was just alright.  Tasted fresh though.  A tad too spicy for me on some dishes to find them tasty.  I didn't get some of the fillings on the Uttapam.  There was one that was just raw red onions and chiles.  I actually spit it out.  I can't remember the last time that I spit something out. \nThe branzino was a mess.  It was overly 'blackened'.  A foot long charred whole fish.  The server offered a sentence or two instructions to remove the fish from the bones.  For $28, you would think she could have taken the 30 seconds to do it.  It tasted.... burnt.   The crispy whole branzino at Slanted Door ($36) is sheer magic.  The DOSA branzino is a mess.\n\nAt the end of the meal, I thought to myself that I could spend $10 for an Indian buffet elsewhere in SF and have almost the same tastes as I just had experienced.   I don't mind an expensive meal as long it's not overpriced.", "author": "Victor P."}

Let me start off by saying this place has an AMAZING ambiance. I love all the creative lighting, the friendly staff, and the bar is always a fun place to grab a drink even if you're not planning on eating here.\n\nWe made reservations (which I highly recommend for Friday-Sunday at least). We were seated pretty quickly on arriving and ordered cocktails when we sat down. The waiter was very good at answering our questions, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted to split a bunch of dishes between the 4 of us so we asked the waiter what he suggested. He told us that 3 small plates, 1 entree, and 1 dosa would probably suffice and we could order more if we were still hungry afterward. Sounded good to me so that's exactly what we did. And of course we ordered 2 bottles of wine on top of that :)\n\nWhat We Ate:\n\n-Grilled Calamari ($10): Worst thing I had the whole night. 2/4 of us liked it. It just wasn't was I was expecting and the taste just didn't sit right with me. It came with like 8 pieces all together. The price for this appetizer was pretty ridiculous for such a tiny amount of food.\n\n-Hyderabadi Lamb Kebab ($12): The best appetizer I had. Just enough spice. This was really delicious! We were about to not order this as some of us don't really care for lamb (including myself), but we went for it anyways and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n-Chennai Chicken ($10): These were excellent. It came with a lot of chicken and the yogurt dipping sauce was excellent. Definitely a spicy dish so have a glass of water ready with this one! I really enjoyed this small plate.\n\n-Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani ($20): This dish was alright. It was basically a medium bowl full of mostly rice and 2 chicken drumsticks. The taste was just so-so (almost tasted like chicken fried rice). For $20 I expected a much larger dish, or maybe the same amount of rice with way more chicken than what we were given.\n\n-Masala Dosa ($11): The dosa tasted absolutely AMAZING, but what threw me off was the one tiny glop of spiced mashed potatoes inside the massive lentil crepe that was on the plate. How the heck are you supposed to split a tiny spoonful of potatoes between 4 people? I was expecting something completely different (MORE potatoes). The flavor was perfect though and I absolutely loved the tomato and lentil dips it came with. The coconut dip was also good, but not my favorite.\n\n\nOur bill came to about $60/person including the tip and the 2 bottles of wine we ordered. Not bad for a fancy night out with friends, but next time I want Indian food I'll be going to a cheaper restaurant with the same/better quality, and save Dosa for a place to booze and socialize.", "author": "Ashley D."}

You also have the option of the \"paper\" Dosa, which is apparently thinner...\n\nThe first time I came here with my sister the FIRST time I moved away from San Francisco, and my last trip was shortly before I left the second time. Once dinner, once lunch.\n\nMy first experience consisted of being seated at the community table, where I was slightly annoyed at the group of men trying to have a full out conversation with us. \"I'm moving in 2 days and my sister and I are here having a constructive conversation, excuse me.\" They didn't listen, but I guess that's what you get when there are two blondes that look like twins in San Francisco (a rarity which I am not used to, since I hail from the Midwest), combined with the amount of alcohol they had consumed.  \n\nMy last experience at Dosa was with a friend of mine who helped me put my bed frame together. It's really quite a shame, because I ended up moving out of that apartment just 2-3 weeks later. Oh well. Anyway, we both ordered the lunch special- a beverage, salad, and Dosa for something along the lines of $12 per person.

First the Channa Bhatura we ordered as a first course for table was \"not available\".  This is after it was recommended by the server and the order had been in the kitchen for awhile.  It turns out the Bhatura had not risen enough to cook when we arrived for a 5:30 reservation (excuse #1).  They substituted \"Poori\" but it was not as good.  They did later bring the Bhatura at no additional cost but by that time the yummy sauce that comes with the Channa Bhatura had been consumed with the Poori so it was a little too late.  Then the lamb chops (again recommended by the server and the most expensive entree on the menu) were a no show.  The rest of our order was received and completely eaten and still no chops.  When we finally questioned our server about this for the third time, the manager said it had been very chaotic seating an almost full house at 5:30 and a lot of people ordered the lamb (excuse #2 and #3).  He did offer to pack them up for us to take home.    In my opinion, paying $35 for lamb chops to take home was not acceptable nor at all what we wanted.  At our insistence, he did not charge for the lamb chops and did send them home with us.\n\nI would think with a reservation system in place, DOSA would know how many guests would be arriving at 5:30 and be thrilled to have a full house for the first seating.  Also,  I would assume the Bhatura would have been started at the correct time in the afternoon to be ready for their first guests and that they would be able to prepare lamb for the guests who ordered it for their meal.  I am surprised DOSA was not prepared to serve its customers last night and made excuses for the lapses.  Please be ready for our next visit, assuming we do come again.", "author": "Morris F."}

They were backed up and we had to wait around 15 mts to get our table. While we were waiting for our table, we soaked in the ambiance which was pretty nice.

Noticed that it was very loud and that they had packed in the tables which does not bother me. We got a couple of drinks while we waited and the bar tenders were very nice and friendly. \n\nWe were seated upstairs and we looked at the menu which was surprisingly sparse.

There was a refreshing corn and chili salad, a flavorful lamb curry served with lemon rice, breaded and deep fried peppers stuffed with a liquid peanut sauce that spurted out when you tried to cut them, huge pan fried peppers stuffed with chicken meat, a very spicy uthappam.  As usual, the food was excellent ( though my companion, who eats whole habanero peppers raw, insists that it \"wasn't very spicy\").\n\nI have a theory that Dosa is the type of restaurant that happens when you have a wonderful chef who cares so much about the food that he disappears into the kitchen and lets the rest of the operation more-or-less run itself.  The food turns out wonderfully, the restaurant is a beautiful space.  There are just so many little things that are not quite right.\n\nIt's a popular place, for sure.  We've twice made reservations, and twice now been directed to wait for our table when we arrived on time.  The wait has never quite been enough to get settled in with a drink at the bar ... just long enough to think you'll have time to do so and order a drink.  So twice now, with largely full drinks precariously balanced in hand ( no, the did not offer to carry them ), we've schlepped upstairs to the same small table which is just a little to close to a much larger table and in front of a window overlooking Post street.\n\nOur server was knowledgeable about the menu, and estimated about ten people a night had ordered from the special Blackboard Eats offer.  He made some decent drink recommendations as well ( The Charlie Chaplin is really a well balanced cocktail, and my companion's Pink City was amusing.  I'd suggest ordering from the list of Revival Cocktails they offer rather than the more Indian-themed ones. ).\n\nA few rough edges:  Charges for rice, which was listed as included on the menu, appeared on our bill, though they were quickly removed when we asked.  Service was adequate when present, but there were long waits on occasion, and times when no server was in evidence for a good five minutes or more.  Our leftovers were cheerfully packaged and bagged, and presented to us with the check.\n\nIt's much larger and more upscale than their sister restaurant on Valencia.  Overall, the food is very good, the bar makes a decent cocktail ( though they have neither draft beer nor Flying Horse ), the facilities are good looking, but the service is disappointingly uneven.

We decided to go to Dosa, Fillmore because of really good Yelp reviews and also based on what we had heard from our friends. Let me start off by saying that this review may be a bit biased because I am originally from Bangalore, India where Dosa is staple breakfast and the bar for Dosa is really high for people from Bangalore and Mysore.\n\nLet me start off with what I liked, the ambience is good, the place is huge and tables are setup with people's privacy in mind unlike most other indian restaurants where they put tables really close just to maximize profits, this is where the good part ends!.\n\nThe service was ok, though I expected more for the price, oh did it say it is priceeeeeey, our waiter looked really stressed and forgot a few things we ordered but was quick to fix it. \n\nNow, let's talk about the food, if you are brave enough to name your restaurant Dosa, you got to make sure that your Dosas are absolutely the best especially if you are going to charge $15 to $20 for a Dosa. I am absolutely cool with paying that kind of money if the quality and taste is up-to the mark, sadly it isn't. I and my friend ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa, these types of Dosa are suppose to be bit thicker, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, it was thin and soggy, it was horrible, I can get better dosa for less than half the price in south bay!. The chutneys were not made fresh and quantity was tiny, Dosas are eaten with a lot of chutney, this place needs to double or triple the quantity of chutney they serve. If you have never had Dosas before, you can try this place, if you know what good Dosas should taste like, avoid this place, save your money and pick any hole in the wall south indian restaurant, you will be more satisfied!.", "author": "Chethan V."}

The dosa was soggy, with no crunchy bits; and the \"sambar\" (really, a very thick and un-sambar-like dal) was two-dimensional, with plenty of high and low notes but no nuance.

The decor is interesting and the vibe is fun. The food is a step below okay. I dined with 3 others and none of us loved our food. I didn't like anything about mine other than the Raita. I ordered the Paneer & Peas dosa. It tasted like a bland egg and cheese crepe from a diner. I tasted the masala dosa and it wasn't much better. \n\nAs other reviews have noted -- no Naan. Rather than naan they serve something called Bhatura which is \"oversized, soft, puffy white bread\". It's bigger than a basketball until you pierce it with a fork and it deflates.

South Indian cuisine has a new fan.\n\nA lot of choices on the menu but didn't really want to do the prix fixe four course.  Ordered the mango and goat cheese salad to start.  Nothing extremely special about the salad though it was good; the mango sweet and the goat cheese mild.  Our next three items came essentially at the same time -- the Fox Island mussels in a spicy coconut milk broth served with uttapam, the prawn masala curry, and the paper masala dosa.  I really enjoyed the broth in the mussels dish, dipping the the uttapam in the broth was delightful, but the mussels themselves didn't taste right.  Prawn masala curry was pretty good and spicy though not too spicy.  The paper masala dosa was excellent and was the star of the meal.  It came to us hot and crisp, rolled up like a massive Sanskrit scroll or like a giant version of those chocolate wafer sticks you sometimes get in your milk shake when it's topped off with whip cream and a cherry.  When it was placed at our table I couldn't help but laugh because the dosa was literally longer than the width of our table.  It came with three different things to dip it in as well as some curried potatoes.  I had no idea where to start.  No one else around us ordered this dosa.  Maybe they knew better, or maybe they just don't know!  Probably the former.  Regardless of the spectacle that the paper masala dosa can be, I really enjoyed it.  Ordered the banana cream pie for dessert and loved every bite of it.\n\nAlthough I liked everything we ordered, next time I would probably just skip over the first part of the menu and just order up some dosas and uttapams as I really enjoyed those most.", "author": "Erich D."}

I've been here twice and both times I've experienced the same problem. In spite of this being a nice restaurant, they don't have their timinng down when it comes to serving courses. Last time I came here my husband and I ordered beers and apps upon sitting down. Our app arrived after 5 minutes, but still no beers. We ordered dinner (dosa and curry) and our dosa arrived 5 minutes later....but still no beer. After over 15 minutes we finally got our beers. However, the curry we ordered didn't arrive for another 15-20 minutes after the dosa arrived. I found it extremely strange that they served one main course 15-20 minutes before the other main course (effectively one of us was done eating before the other even got his meal).\n\nIf you're coming here for dinner, stick to the bar and stick to the dosas or other quick food items.

It's my favorite Indian restaurant in the Bay Area by far. The primary reason is that they have very creative and tasty dishes. There is nothing wrong with Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, and Tandoori Chicken, etc. However, they represent less than 1% of the wonderfully diverse cuisine of India. If you want to see what else India has to offer, go to Dosa. On our last visit we had Chennai Chicken (we generally order this every time) and Idli Fries. (Dahi Vada is another favorite). For mains we had the Spicy Basil Dosa and Tamil Lamb. The curry had just the right amount of heat, leaving a warm afterglow in one's mouth. I have a sweet tooth, but as much as I love Indian food, I have never been that keen on their desserts. Dosa is the only Indian restaurant that I bother to order dessert. They used to have a fantastic chai pot de creme, but alas, no more. They have a new pastry chef and the desserts we did have last week were very nice. Dosa also has some creative and tasty cocktails. I have always found the service to be attentive. On our last visit I mentioned that we had a time limit because we were going to the movies.

Whereas Dosa on Valencia is dim, intimate, and cozy, Dosa on Fillmore has soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and light, light, light! Add to this, a beautifully decorated interior to enjoy a Sunny SF day in the Fillmore.\n\nWe started the meal with complimentary fried crisps/chips with fennel seeds. I'm not sure what they were, but I would liken them to some kind of Indian \"tortilla chip\" but much thinner and lighter. Yum! I wanted another bowl!\n\nWe split a Prawn \"Frankie\" (spiced sauce, marinated onions, cucumbers & cilantro chutney wrapped in Roti, w egg-white brush) and a Spicy Mung Masala Dosa (mung lentil dosa with green chiles and spiced potatoes). The server noted these items were SPICY! \n\nAnd SPICY they were....but enjoyably so, allowing the complex flavors of the entrees to still sign through. The Prawn Frankie was similar to an Indian \"burrito\" (Curry Up Now lovers, rejoice!). Juicy prawns in a red fiery sauce wrapped up in a soft roti wrapper. \n\nThe Spicy Mung Masala Dosa was also very tasty. The earthiness of the mung dosa was a tasty vehicle to enjoy the savory spiced potatoes and spicy chiles inside. I enjoyed experimenting with the tomato, fresh coconut chutney, and sambar (lentil dipping soup made with vegetables). I tried the Paper Masala (a thin, crispy, pliable dosa) at the Valencia location and prefer that because I like more texture in my food, but this was still very good. \n\nSpent about $30 for 2 people, including tip.", "author": "Monelle A."}

They season the potato appropriately, and the sambar is always good.]\n    * SOUTH INDIAN MOONS - $14\n        - [4/5 - We always get this for the variety. Getting 5 different mini uttapams mean getting to sample more each time, some more veggie-clad than others. We usually have 2 favorites that we save for last.]\n    * SAMBAR (served with the dosa & uttapam)\n        - [4/5 - The sambar really does matter when you're eating South Indian food. Seeing as it's the standard \"dip\" for both your dosas and uttapams, it needs to be properly seasoned and just thick enough to stick without necessarily being as creamy as your standard curry. This sambar is good.]\n\n________________________________\n\n\n::: [ THE DRINKS ] :::\n\n    * MANGO MIMOSA - $9\n        - [3/5 - The ratio needed some work.

It's more sweet than sour, and though I usually like it to be a touch more sour, this was still very delicious.]", "author": "Asha S."}

I was really looking forward to this meal! I'll start off by saying that I actually liked the atmosphere. It's super casual, a lively bar scene, and plenty of space. A little bizarre eating a nice meal next to a huge burger king but they can't really do much about that. \n\nFor food we did the tasting menu which seemed like a good deal and we were able to taste several different options. The meal started off great with the chicken chennai and minced lamb. Both very good, amazing flavor and spices, ( spicy) but  not overboard. Then we proceeded with the truffle dosa and spring uttupam. Again both tasted great and something really different! by this point we were super excited for the curry! Big letdown. Holy heat in my mouth! Way too spicy I could not enjoy this, and there was practically zero meat in the curry. There were literally 3-4 bites of chicken. The whole meal was something different and exciting but by the end my mouth was on fire, and I don't mind spicy food. We got a dessert that I liked but actually forget the name.\n\nThe downfall really is the price of the meal. 70$ plus dessert and 2 drinks each and your looking at 150$ for Indian food......Wayyy too much.  I think next time we won't do the tasting menu as it's a lot of food. Great to try several options the first time there though. the service was a bit strange. When our server was actually at our table she took time to go through the menu with us and explain everything which was helpful, but she was  difficult to get a hold of. Drinks took a long time as well. Not really sure about the whole experience, Id like to give dosa another try but maybe will continue my search for good curry in this city.\n\nSide note: the floor is super slippery and that has nothing to do with the beer I ordered being poured on it by the server.", "author": "Kate N."}

The only option before Dosa opened was the $9.99 Indian Palace buffet a block away which may have been a liiittle bit too dirty for the Marc Jacobs wearing Pac Heights crowd. \n\nNot sure it's worth the one hour wait but the food is solid. Sipping my Gamay Noir from Andrew Lane at the bar wasn't so bad though. \n\nDosa does Southern India cuisine very well. The Vegetable Curry was one of my favorites since it's mild and I heart veggies. The Coconut Prawn Curry was a bit on the coconut-y side for me. The Pepper Chicken Curry was okay but next time I would probably go with the Chicken and Eggplant Curry instead. \n\nFor starters I definitely recommend the Somoasas \"North and South\". I loved the South one with carmelized onions and veggies. \n\nHuh? No naan? No worries. They have poori which is this delicious light and airy piece of fried bread. Good but don't expect it to fill you up because it's 90% air. \n\nAs for the Dosas I recommend the Cilantro and Mint Dosa. The lentil dipping soup and the chutneys were yummy.

Dosa unlike a prime steak or things of that nature that deals with pricey raw materials, does not cost all that much to make. So when I think of the folds of profit they make on an item, it does not seem to add up. Well on the flip side, its more of an upscale locale with a great decor.

Oh who am I kidding, I'm staring at the light fixtures. I'm secretly a moth, which probably explains why I run into sliding glass doors a lot.\n\nBut last Monday I called up a friend and said that, since I was famished and couldn't walk more than a few steps from my car without passing out, we should totally check out Dosa. Being the gentleman he is, he obliged and we met at the bar. It was pretty obvious that he and I had absolutely no idea what to order, because we're used to french and italian food, and this is *clearly* not either of them. Of course, he HAS to ask the bartender why a French wine has a German name (the Gerwuzientalksdjfalkfjder).

The steamed puffed rice was wonderful but then when the dosa came out, I expect them to have different sauces--they didn't. All came with the tomato chutney, the coconut chutney, and the broth type looking thing. It was all wonderful, but I like a little variety with my sauces. So four stars. My friend kept saying the cheese one looked like an enchilada. Apparently, he ALSO has taco bell on the brain.

My dining partner and I had been to the Dosa on Valencia a couple of times a few years ago when it first opened.  We both love Indian food, and it was our first experience eating dosas and uttapams.  We were a little underwhelmed with the blandness of these (starch filled with more starch) and, given the difficulty of getting a table there, didn't go out of our way to return.\n\nHowever, a friend told us to try Dosa on Fillmore, adding that he thought the dishes other than the dosas were superior.  We couldn't agree more.  We were surprised with dishes with complexity of flavor.  The restaurant itself, while a bit of a hipster haven, is quite spacious and the mid-century design is well done.  Also, the menu is different than the restaurant on Valencia.  Now to the food.\n\nMy partner had the tasting menu:\nChennai chicken, which we joked is the Indian version of buffalo wings.  Savory fried bits of chicken with a delightful spicy crust.\nSunchoke uttapam:  A nicely presented pancake, but the bell peppers overwhelmed the rest of the more subtle flavors.\nLamb kofta:  Fabulous meatballs in a tasty, tomato-y sauce.\n\nI had the Channa bhatura, a chickpea curry with a super delicious, puffy piece of bread that is as big as a soccer ball until you puncture it with your fork.  This was a subtle and slightly sweet dish that went very well with the bread.\n\nBecause we enjoyed our entrees so much, we decided to share dessert, and we were not disappointed with a sublime fig, honey and cardamom gelato.  We had the chickory coffee which we were surprised wasn't more like a chai (with the nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, etc.), but if you've had chickory coffee in New Orleans, this coffee will be familiar and have you craving beignets.\n\nOne thing that surprised us was that the dishes weren't spicier.  We really enjoy hot food, but none of our selections was very spicy.  Not a complaint--the flavors were complex and carefully combined--but I had read on Yelp that the food set off some people's spice meters.\n\nService was exceptional and the pricing (except for the pre-dinner whiskey, which was exorbitant) was more than fair.

The lamb kofta was just spicy enough for me, and all of the corresponding chutneys that were presented with the dosas at the table were lovely to try.  At our table we all ordered a different selection from the dessert menu and were not disappointed, mmm blood orange & ginger sorbet.  \n\nDosa is definitely a must enjoy on our next trip to SF, I can't wait.", "author": "Suzanne J."}

A savvy friend recommended for a special date night we go to Dosa on Fillmore for dinner followed by a cozy balcony level movie across the street at Sundance Kabuki Cinema. It was our anniversary in October, and since I'm the planner of the two of us, I made reservations on Opentable and bought our movie tickets online as well.\n\nIt was hard to pick what to order because everything looked tempting. I love that they use local, organic and sustainable ingredients as much as possible. We ordered the tasting menu so we could try a good variety. Mr. L had his tasting menu with the wine pairing and I ordered a Peony cocktail (Right Gin, hibiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, orange flower water, birds eye chili, served up). \n\nI had a fresh corn soup, vegetable dosa, halibut curry, and coconut sorbet. This was one of the best meals we've had and the Peony has become a new favorite cocktail. We're both fans of Indian food, and didn't know it could be this vibrant, light, fresh, and bold.\n\nSince it was our wedding anniversary, I squelched my impulses to photograph the restaurant and our food. It was a special occasion and my husband deserved to be out to dinner with his loving wife, not the obsessive Yelper who would ask him to wait while she photographed his food. As a result, we had a relaxing meal without him rolling his eyes at my Yelp antics. I didn't need to ask how many stars he'd give this restaurant - this is a slam-dunk 5 star swanky joint. The bright flavors and exotic cocktails leave me yearning to go back.\n\nService was seamless and prompt. The only thing I would've preferred was if the waiter had recommendations when we asked. He said everything was excellent, and perhaps he spoke the truth. \n\nIt was a memorable meal and afterward we walked across the street to see a movie on the \"21 and over\" balcony level of the Kabuki where there are little tables in the movie theatre and you can drink wine with your movie. I wonder how I'll top this for our next anniversary.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Even though the place was packed when we arrived Sunday night, we were seated quickly. There is a cool vibe and a more upscale ambience than what I've experienced in the Indian restaurants I'm used to going to ( the kind that serve the inexpensive lunch buffets). I liked the variety on the menu - in addition to the curries and vindaloos and variations of lamb, there are dosas and uttapam. I have to admit I hadn't heard of the latter two before, so of course that's what we had to try. First though, we decided to go for the cocktails. I chose the \"peony\" because peonies are one of my favorite flowers and I thought it would be interesting as a drink - wow, it was delicious and unique! From what my companions said about their drinks, this would definitely be my choice again. \n\nInstead of bread, we had pappadums (or at least that's what I thought they were) - kind of like Indian tortilla chips and really addicting. For dinner, we started with an appetizer - we went for the standby North and South Samosas, which were basically yummy as you would expect. We also ordered the Vada Pav (vegetarian sliders) on the recommendation of the server, but those didn't show up until we were nearly done with our dinner so we just brought them home. As I said, the restaurant was crowded and maybe that is the reason for the spotty service, but it seemed they should not have charged us for something that was their error (we didn't ask, but if a restaurant has really good customer service, you shouldn't have to). Since the entrees tend to be expensive and the name of the place is Dosa, I think it's a good plan to go with ordering dosas for your meal - very filling!  My choice was a Spicy Basil Dosa, which came as all the dosas do, with fresh coconut and tomato chutney as well as sambar (lentil dipping soup) - delish! My friend loved the dips so much that even when she was done with her dosa, she scooped up the rest with her spoon and enjoyed every drop. We were all too full for dessert. Overall, Dosa was a great experience for the food, and hopefully the service will be better next time.", "author": "Nancy V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-26", "description": "I recently met a professional food critic and the conversation made me realize how deficit most of my restaurant \"reviewing\" is. A fair review requires a good concept of \"what good looks like\" and not just \"what I like.\" With this concept in mind, I realize I am more or less a hack at this, but I will try my best to comment on Dosa on Fillmore. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the coconut basmanti rice which was semisweet and perfectly cooked. I also enjoyed my before dinner cocktail which was the ginger ante - tangy with ginger.\n\nThe fried fish starter was mediocre - more or less fish sticks accompanied by three condaments: a mild green yogurt sauce, a spicy chilly sauce and chutney of chili and cilantro. The chutney was chopped individual vegetable with no cohesive identity. \n\nMy mango prawn curry dish was yawn-worth. The sauce had a good flavor, but it didn't really \"jump out\" and was the exact opposite of the chutney. In other words it was an amalgam of flavors with no real standout of high notes and lows.\n\nThe Nilgiri Chicken Korma was my shared dish and was good, but felt a lot like what it really was...a curry stew prepared ahead and heated for serving. \n\nOn service; it was only adequate. I'm not an Indian cuisine expert, but I was surprised to find no naan (traditional flat bread) on the menu. Maybe this is because its Southern Indian cuisine - I don't know and I didn't feel compelled to inquire on this point. After we spent 15 minutes pouring over the menu multiple times, the server should have been astute enough to ask if we had dined there before. We asked enough questions to figure it out, but it was more work than it needed to be.\n\nFinally for value...two drinks, two glasses of wine, two entrees and bread: $120 including tip. Hmmmm. The overall sensation of the meal was that the plates were prepared for us, but the meals were not.", "author": "J T."}

A few months back, we had gone to Dosa on Valencia and thought to give this location a try as we really enjoyed the food and service at Valencia.\n\nThe service was extremely poor. The management seemed to have checked in and taken care of seating us and making sure our orders were taken on time, however attention to details from our server was highly lacking. He placed the initial plates of papadum at our table and never brought out the tamarind and chutney sauces to accompany it. We looked around to locate him, however it seemed he was too busy to even drop by and check on that detail. Additionally, I had ordered a chai at the start of our meal and I had finished the chai during the course of my meal. \n\nWhen we finally decided to order dessert, I requested the server that I would like another chai and he took my cup and came back with more chai in the same old cup I had used previously in the beginning. To make it look even worse, my opened sugar packet and used spoon was STILL left on the saucer when he returned with the \"new\" cup of chai. My friends and I had a good laugh at this in the moment, but it was terrible to receive an old cup I had used previously and not be given a new cup with the chai I had reordered. It just looked really bad.\n\nI then requested another individual to kindly take back the cup and give me a new chai with a new cup and spoon. He did. Throughout the closure of our meal, while we were finishing dessert, the bus boys would interrupt and cut through us to wipe the table (while we were seated) and clear plates. A few times of doing this was fine, but it happened several times at the end when we were finishing dessert and we felt rushed and interrupted too often. They didn't even say \"excuse me\" when reaching their hands between us to take plates or clear/wipe the table. \n\nI was highly disappointed with the service and we won't be returning to this location. It's a good thing the food is good, so we'll be taking our business to Valencia where the service was more professional and detailed.", "author": "Sandhya R."}

That being said, I still like Udupi Palace in the Mission better.\n\nThe food:\nWe started with the Dahi Vada and Vada Sambar.  The presentation on the Dahi Vada is very nice, and at first I had no idea what I was looking at.  It took me a second to realize that the dumplings were hiding underneath the yogurt, tamarind, and mint sauce in a very pretty pattern.  Yummy and refreshing.  The Vada Sambar was also very good, but it would have been  much better if the dumplings were completely soaked int he sambar.  It was obviously it has just been covered with the sauce about a minute before serving.\n\nI got the Rava Masala dosa, which was tasty. The tomato and coconut chutneys are better than I remembered them being, much more flavorful.  The sambar was good like last time too.\n\nMy friends ordered a spicy mung masala dosa, which was also very good but not as spicy as I thought it would be.  The roasted chile and garlic masala was also good and spicy!  At first I thought it wasn't spicy at all, but the longer you wait the stronger the burn gets.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe service was pretty disappointing.  It took us awhile to even figure out who our server was, yet there is an army of people nearby to clear your plates and bring you water.

About a year ago this rating would be at least 4 stars, but lately I have been unimpressed with the hospitality.\n\nThe food is great... 3 stars at the very minimum.  It's a bit pricey, but the flavors are magical.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely beautiful... 4 stars.\n\nThe hospitality, unfortunately, is closer to 1-2 stars.\n\nThere have been more than a few occasions where I felt like I may be an inconvenience rather than a paying guest.  Let me add that this criticism is strictly related to the bar area, not the main dining room.  I completely understand that the bartenders and hostesses are multi tasking.  Perhaps they are a bit too stretched thin?  But wait, I was there when there was hardly anyone else there (they had just opened for the evening) and I felt that I was interrupting their socializing time by ordering a drink and something to eat.  Thankfully (for them) I was quick and they promptly went back to joking around with one another.  And it did help that they were more invested in catching up with each other as I didn't bother to order another cocktail, which resulted in me spending less money that I was prepared to spend.  So a savings, of sorts, there.\n\nI am the type that understands that there can be an \"off night.\"  I usually wait to see if it happens again before I say anything.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a consistent aspect for the past three times I've visited.  When meeting friends, we do tend to go when it's not a high octane night (Fridays, Saturdays) so perhaps there is a more engaged staff on those nights?\n\nAgain, this is strictly related to the bar area.

Also, he described the masala dosa as filled with eggplant, not potato. So when I got it I thought I had the wrong dish. Which wouldn't have been surprising since multiple servers tried giving us another table's food three different times. We even got entrees delivered to our table after we had dessert! There was some serious disorganization going on. \n\nAll of our dishes were very good, but my fish curry stood out to me as very good.

Back to our server, he could tell right away that we were first timers. We perused the menu, and he helped out with explanations about certain things. We got two starters, three if you count the fire broth. Our meal was a dosa and an uttapam. Wow, that pretty much sums it up. I am neither a food critic, nor a writer, so I won't go into awesome detail about the textures or flavor pairings or spice or anything like that. What I will say is, go here now.\n\nPS\nOne of the reviews on here complained about the server saying that he took a horrible picture of them and didn't check in to see if it was an ok shot...Are you flippin kidding me? That has nothing to do with his job or the level of service that you should be reviewing. And who the frick asks their server to take their picture? \n\nPPS\nWe, as I said earlier, were at the social table. Turns out that the man at the table across from us was the director of The Cove. Holy shit Miss Agnes, what a trip...got to talk with him about his life and times and I didn't even know until my wife told me later who he was", "author": "David G."}

The hostess was also the waitress... and that combo didn't really work.  She seemed really rushed and distracted.  She asked what I wanted to drink, but forgot to ask my partner.  She started to leave, but we were able to stop her and order a tea.  A few minutes later she came back to re-confirm the beer.  \n\nWell, tea showed up, but the beer didn't arrive.  We then waited quite a while for the food.  After another 10 minutes, still no beer and no server.  Food runner finally dropped off food, but no beer.  \n\nThe two dosas we had were very good (spicy basil & spinach):\n- Flavors intense and rich\n- Coconut dipping sauce was wonderful\n- Red sauce (forgot name) was too bitter\n- Lentil soup... OUTSTANDING!\n\nHalfway through the meal, our server and beer was still a no-show.  I finally got tired of waiting and I hailed down another food-runner to ask the status of my beer.

Not having made reservations in advance, we ended up with a 10pm seating.  \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is wonderful, the perfect combination of classy, exotic, Indian. You could tell the light fixtures, the mosaic tiled bar, the adornments and even the textures of the wall were all carefully selected.\n\nDosa is unique because it is South Indian cuisine and as my colleague told me that most Indian restaurants in the US are north Indian, Dosa is different in this way.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes family style to share: \n\n1) crab vadas-small crab cakes accompanied by a tamarind and cilantro sauce. this tasted good but the portions were just tiny.\n\n2) chennai chicken-this sounded better on the menu than it tasted on the palate.\n\n3) duck spinach masala and paneer-the spinach sauce is quite heavy and it didn't compliment the paneer as well as I thought it would given the fact that I love saag paneer.\n\n4) pepper chicken-advertised as 'falls off the bone' this it did not. the flavor was good but we thought it was going to be much more tender.\n\n5) masala dosa-GREAT! if you come here, definitely order this. a crepe like sheet encased with potatoes, spice, peas, and a variety of dipping sauces, this was truly delicious.\n\n6) peas and paneer dosa-also very tasty, this one is like a filled crepe and had the same sauces.\n\nDefinitely order the dosas if you come here. They were great. Everything else we just thought were average. On the way out, we also a dish called \"South Indian Moons\" which is an assortment of Uttapams.

They do a solid job and serve some dishes that I don't see at restraunts often but remember from my childhood.\n\nI think their execution, flavors, service and decor all make for a great experience.\n\nWhat drags the score down for me is that Dosa bills itself (both in hype and price) as much more. This isn't your corner indian joint, it shouldn't be serving just good straight ahead indian food. With all the pomp and circumstance (and $$$), I expected the food to be off the charts with creativity (like Aziza does with Morroccan food out in the Richmond).\n\nI was expecting Dosa to push the envelope a bit by utilizing indian flavors in new and creative dishes. Instead they just wow diners who've never seen Baturas before. The only place they managed to do anything creative was with their cocktails. The cocktails were great and were unlike anything I'd had before.\n\nDosa is a place to go for solid indian food when you feel like dressing up and not much more.

I walked in and the first thing I thought was \"wow, this place is pretty for an Indian restaurant.\" I mean, sure, I have seen pretty Indian restaurants before, but they hadn't had the reputation for good food. I was very excited to see what Dosa dished out. \n\nIn order to get a reservation for 7, we had to be there at 6:30. Even 4 days beforehand, there was no way to eat later. We walked in at 6:30 and the place was already packed with an older crowd. Every table in the fairly full restaurant was taken. \n\nWe were walked upstairs to a nice table by the window. It was a bit load but pleasant. The waiter was nice and brought out water right away. I ordered a Bollywood Hills ($9) which was made with saffron vodka. Just that description (although the rest went on for ages) sold me on the drink. It knocked me off my feet though. Before my dinner arrives, I was already happy and giggly.  \n\nTo start, my friends and I had multiple starters which I can't remember. The chicken stood out as really great. It came with a yogurt dipping sauce that brought out the flavours of the fried chicken. I was sad to see it disappear.\n \nI had the paneer and peas Dosa (around $12). It was fantastic although a bit on the heavy side. It tasted so good though that, even though I was totally stuffed at after about half, I cleaned my plate. The spices and the cheese just made such a perfect taste that I couldn't help myself. \n\nI really want to come back here soon.

I selected Dosa because my sister and her new boyfriend were visiting from New York and they wanted a nice Indian food meal at a moderate price.  I'd visited both the Fillmore and Valencia locations before and had a good experience, so I wanted to show them that SF could do good, creative, fusion food at a $$ price point.  To walk through the disappointment, blow by blow:\n\n1.  We had a 7 PM reservation, but were kept standing for more than ten minutes waiting for our table -- this was bizarre in light of the fact that there were many available tables in the row of tables in which we were ultimately seated (i.e., the restaurant was not waiting for slow diners to leave.)\n\n2.  One person was interested in ordering chai, but wanted to know with what it was spiced (the waitress did not know) and how much it cost (the waitress made up a price, which turned out to be inaccurate).  She also gave us the impression that these were odd questions to ask.  We eventually found the information on the bottom of the last page of the menu, but really, the staff should either know this information or know how to obtain it quickly and accurately when asked by a customer.\n\n3.  We each ordered the three course prix fixe; two of us ordered drinks a la carte, and one person ordered the wine pairing.  There was then an awkwardly long delay before our first course arrived.  \n\n4.  Two of us had ordered the scallop appetizer.  While the scallops themselves tasted good, the blend of sauces was unfortunate and did not work for me at all.\n\n5.  Our forks and knives were taken away after the first course.  When the second course arrived, we were not given replacement forks and knives until we asked for them.  The person with the wine pairing had to request the wine pairing for the second dish to come out; it was not served automatically.\n\n6.  One person in our party had ordered the paneer and green mango dosa as their second course, and they were disappointed with the mix of flavors, ultimately concluding that the mango and paneer did not work when paired together. \n\n7.  The waitress did not bother to monitor the status of our dishes, and the third dish/main course was dumped on us before I had finished the second course.  Extremely poor move service-wise.\n\n8.  We each had the lamb as our main course, which was acceptable, but ultimately forgettable.\n\nWe got out of there as quickly as possible (which still took two hours) without havng dessert and high-tailed it to Michael Mina for dessert, where at least I knew I could promise my guests warm and consistent service.  Extremely disappointed with this subpar experience, more so because I invited out-of-towners here and felt chagrined as the evening of mediocre food with horrible service unfolded.

Dosa has mediocre food that is presented in a very elegant manner. If that's what you pay a premium for I rather go a couple blocks down for India Palace buffet. \n\nThe chicken appetizer was overly spicy and small. The best thing was the dosa paper masala which is like a think crisp Indian pancake you dip in curry and coconut sauce. I can see why its unique and on the 7x7 list but if that's the best thing they have to offer (pan-fried dough) then that might be a little bit of a problem.\n\nThe wait was long even though we made reservations and service is mediocre as they forgot one of our dishes.

Dosas - the hallmark of legit South Indian cuisine- are normally served in enviroments with quick turnover--get your seat and food fast, get it good, and get the hell out. This place is the antithesis of the \"hole in the wall\", offering enough mood lighting, high ceilings, dramatic artwork, and pebble adorned toilet seats to keep the entire yuppy fillmore district happy. Really though - A+ for ambiance. But be forewarned, our wait time without a reservation on a Monday night was 50 minutes.  \n\nNow on to the tragic part of the evening-the food. Like the guy who is perfect on paper and adores you, i REALLY wanted to like it, but left feeling disappointed and jipped. The concept seemed fun and interesting - elevating South Indian classics (dosa, uttapam, currys) with westernized elements.  The plates looked scrumptious, garnished beautifully with vibrant colors and emitting pungent aromas. Somehow  though, nothing tasted good. We ordered a variety of items on the menu and I didn't want to steal anyone elses food - it was all bad. From over seasoning to under seasoning to spiciness that dominated my entire palate. The uttapams and dosas were measly looking, a disappointing sight for someone used to dosas that stick out of your plate a foot on each side. Generous portions fail. \n\nOther things to take note of: Slightly pricey, great drink selection and bar area, excellent service.\n \nNot sure if the guys in the kitchen were having an off night, or if their taste-buds died and stopped working, or if this is par for the course. However, if you're craving a delicious and satisfying Dosa, go to that Hole in the wall that you know and love. i don't want to say that you shouldn't mess with the classics; DOSA has a lot of potential and judging by the hype, it's lived up to it. My take: if you want to have a sensory experience (not including taste), yummy drinks, and mediocre food , go to DOSA.", "author": "Amisha S."}

Felt like I should have gotten up to go dancing at the bar after devouring some curry. \n\nI think overall Indian food everywhere is pretty pricey and this wasn't any different but maybe $2-$5 dollars more.  The food itself was just OK.  At least I didn't think my dish was wonderful and usually when it comes to Indian food, I can never control myself.  I walked away from here only finishing a quarter of my dish.  What?!!\n\nI got the Duck Spinach Masala & Paneer and I thought it was just ok.  The tomato rice suggested to pair up with the curry actually didn't go well together. Instead of finishing my dish, I ate my cousins Lamb Kofta because it was too spicy for her and perfect for me!  Love the extra spice.\n\nIf I go back, I would get that.  The wait for this place is a little silly given that its just alright.  I suppose its a good place to be seen.

Dosa surprised me on so many levels, I don't even know where to begin. Similar to the way I felt when first looking at the menu, the size of a novel. Our waiter recommended what we needed to try as first timers and what could wait until our next time around. Her selections could not have been more spot on. Started with the grilled calamari, followed by the dahi vada, spicy basil dosa and ending with the mango prawns. Our meal was such a perfect combination of Indian flavors, cool and spicy, I don't know how I could order anything different next time. Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Jessie S."}

We had been talking about hitting up Dosa on Fillmore a number of times and finally snagged reservations this past weekend. We grabbed a drink at the bar while we were waiting and we were off to a good start: the Bengali gimlet is AMAZING. Their drinks are creative and delish -- we tried a few and they were all exceptional. The ambiance is also pretty awesome -- somewhat ornate; perfect for a date night or for bringing out-of-town guests. When the food came -- wow, wow, yum. We started with an app (vegetarian sliders are phenomenal) and then split an entree and a dosa. The prawn masala stood out to me as being exceptional, but everything was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-16", "description": "So the two stars on this review is only because of the food. I have to note the service was absolutely AMAZING. We were heading to the Kabuki on opening day of Harry Potter (just after work) so we had wanted something close by. When I made the reservation, I was honestly slightly irked that they took my credit card number down (there were six of us), it seemed a little elitist to me but people have raved about this place, I had to give it a shot.\n\nThe waitress was awesome, she was prompt and the service was so fast. We had told them we were limited on time so she hauled for us. I also thought it was cool that she informed us that gratuity was already included in the bill. \n\nSo the food, it is definitely pricey. And its not bad at all, but if you're looking for flavorful, close to authentic Indian food. I feel like Dosa has \"americanized\" their food and taken out the spices so it loses the authenticity of Indian food. I also didn't like my paneer \"dosa\" came as a wrap. I wasn't expecting that. I'm Indian and when I hear \"dosa\" I think of the typical Indian dosa. For the price and that flavor, I probably won't ever go back. Its the bay area, there are a ton of other more authentic Indian places.", "author": "Analisa S."}

We six visited Dosa last weekend. \nThe place was packed on Sunday night at 7 Pm food, thanks to Opentable we got the perfect seating in the corner-booth. \nWell Service, ambiance, pace with we were served, all 5 starts by default. Every individual who serviced our table knew what the menu is all about, even when it comes to the french pressed Moksha coffee to end the evening in style. \nAs a Mumbaite, I always miss our staple snack, Vada Pav. I must mentioned, in all the restaurants (mostly hyped once) I tried in the bay area, Vada Pav sliders at the DOSA is executed almost to perfection by the Chef. Not exactly Bombay style but the recipe has its own merits. Superb start to the dinner! We ordered various \" Virgin drinks, although Dosa has really good collection of sprits & Bar. My fav. drink was Southern Monsoon. It is worth trying for sure. \n\nNow to the main course, we ordered variety of Dosas, Spicy Basic, Chile-Garlic, Moong dosa and so on. Different taste, very good presentation. Actually some of us felt that we are eating in some eatery in south India :) Sambar was chennai style, again fantastic! Uttapam moon Platter is amazing :) \n\nAll in all it was wonderful evening spent with friends and some authentic, spicy indian food and some good fusion music tracks to increase the tempo for the evening! \n\nMUST VISIT!!!", "author": "Mandar S."}

That says a lot, esp for those of you who aren't sure if an Indian restaurant is the way to go for an event.

The service gets a solid 2-stars.\n\nAs with most places in SF, it's always going to be the service that sets you apart, regardless how good your food may be. The service when I went here killed the experience.\n\nWe got there and there are tons of empty tables, but since we didn't have a reservation we ended up at the bar. Usually that's awesome, you get some attention being right there. You never have to wait for a drink, you can order whatever you want quickly - but not at Dosa.\n\nWe sat at the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally a we asked the bar back to help us to order, so he told the bar tender who was standing right there that we wanted to order. \n\nWe asked for his recommendation on some glasses of wine. He couldn't give us any, so we ordered a few different glasses. One was good, the other was bad. Like bitter gone bad, bad. So I ordered a dirty martini, which the guy had to ask me how to make. *sigh*\n\nAfter waiting a loooooong time, we finally were able to order some food. Now the food came out extremely quick, even though they forgot one of the 4 dishes we had coming (which the kitchen also fixed ASAP). That part of the service made my very happy. They kitchen staff was on it. Too bad the people at the bar were not. I really felt like the bar staff were blessing us with their service, rather then them wanting to make the paying customer happy. \n\nWell back to the food. The currys we had were pretty good for being a little less traditional then the Indian food we're all accustomed to. The Samosas were a bit chewy, and I was shocked they didn't have any naan, only some kind of fried bread (umm, where in India is deep dried bread from again?). The things they call DOSA's, aren't Indian food at all, but from Eastern Africa (go try Ethiopian or Somalian food). But they were still pretty good. Other then the fact the food they serve here should be called \"Indian Fusion\", not Indian IMHO, it was overall pretty good. Not greasy, pretty flavorful, and fresh.  \n\nThe atmosphere for the place doesn't really fit the food either. The look and feel of the place is more modern, like you would see at a fancier place. It didn't really fit the Indian Fusion vibe. \n\nI guess if you can get over the service and want to try a different spin on Indian food, I'd say give this place a try. If you're in the mood for more traditional Indian, I'd say stay away.", "author": "Erik B."}

The waiter was a little pretentious and offered little when asked about some of the meals. He explained that Dosa were easy to share, saying that they were individually wrapped. It turns out they're huge crepes with filling in the center. Everything was quite tasty, but be warned that this food is spicy. I got a mango lassi to wash it down, but the lassi was so thick it was difficult to suck through a straw. \nThe desserts were quite tasty as well, coconut ice cream and raspberry sherbet.

Real habaneros.  I generally don't like raitas but when I was eating this I was regretting not having any.  The potatoes were plain (aka no habanero) so if I got the ratio of wrapper and potato right then it was manageable.  When I passed it around the table people tried it but no one could really eat it because it was so hot.  To be fair, the waitress warned me when I ordered it.  I was pretty impressed because usually you can't get real hot Indian food in SF.  But now I see they've taken it off the menu probably because it was too much.

Not gonna lie, I kinda suggested this place in honor of his Indian-ness.... is that wrong? I love dining in groups of 4--it just seems to work out so well. Originally made a reservation for 5 and they didn't give me any crap about only have 4 people show up. I appreciated that. We kind of sampled everything so here's a rundown:\n\nThe waitress was great--she took the time to explain to us the difference between the southern and northern Indian cuisines. (It is nothing like naan n curry!)\n\nAppetizer:\n\n-Heirloom Tomatoes & Idiappam: SOOO good. great combo on flavors and we split one between the 4 of us so it was only a few bites, but it was delicious. The waitress warned us the heirloom tomatoes are starting to go out of season but ours were delicious.\n\nEntrees (we did it all family style):\n\nVegetable curry: extremely flavorful and goes great with their coconut rice. The coconut rice was alright--not the best i've ever had, but then again this isn't a Thai restaurant!\n\nMasala Dosa: Not gonna lie, i didn't get much of the inside of this cuz I was the last person the plate rotated to but the crepe-like outside was delicious! My friends enjoyed it though!\n\nSouth Indian Moons Uttapam: It was a sampler of 5 of the chef's favorite Uttapams. Uttapams are just like the Dosas except all the ingredients are mashed together to form sort of like a fritatta texture. They were my favorite!\n\nside of Dahi Rice: it was basically yogurt and rice with some other flavors--it reminded my friend's bf of cole slaw. It's a nice palate cleanser for the mouth in between tasting all the different flavors. However, the serving size could have been about 1/2 that size because you really only want a little bit...\n\nDessert: (we split 2 desserts between the 4 of us)\n-Banana Cream Pie: It was so light and the carmelized bananas were delicious\n-Gulab Jamoon: Soft, lightly-fried milk-dough balls, warm, cardamom syrup --a little too sweet for me, but it was good if split between 4 since we only had a couple bites each\n\n\nI dont recommend any of their spice route drinks--im not a fan of my cocktail tasting like curry....sent back my \"peony\" and got a mojito instead. good choice", "author": "An-Nhien L."}

I don't know if it's Dosa's fault, but it was my fault for not remembering exactly what ras malai tastes like and convincing everyone to order it.

I was pleased to find that they serve high quality tonic (Fever Tree) to go with their high-end vodka.\n\nRight at reservation time, we were led up the stairs to a lovely table on the railing overlooking the bar and the street.  The lighting was a bit dim for our older eyes, so the waitress brought us an extra \"candle\" and showed that it was electric and could be used as a small flashlight on the menu. Very helpful!  Overall the service was both gracious and efficient. We felt taken care of and never rushed.\n\nWe ate:\n\nSpiced Mango and Goat Cheese Salad with organic mixed greens\nFiery Fruit\nPrawn Masala with basmatic rice\nSouth Indian Lamb Kofta with lemon rice\nParatha\n\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious with the perfect balance of spice and seasoning.  I'm not normally a big fan of paratha, but this version was pan-fried, making it light and crispy and very flavorful.\n\nI'm already planning my next visit.", "author": "Martha M."}

You have pretty good food and vegetarian options, but:\n\n1) Your coconut rice is just *ok* when really it should be great because it pairs well with everything.\n2) Your appetizers and small plates are decent (mini dosa, spicy prawns), but they are quite small and difficult to share with groups of 3+.\n3) Your ceiling is just a bit too high, such that I never feel cozy in here. \n4) Your service can be lacking.  (I actually got spilled on once here).\n\nOn the upside, I enjoy the dosas, and it's not too hard to get a reservation here.

It was truly a wonderful experience - the food was tasty, the service was great, portions were generous, and the dining area was airy and spacious.  The place was really inviting and had good ambiance.  I also liked the music they were playing in the background.\n\nThis was my first time trying a dosa and the server explained how to eat it and which dipping sauces to use.  There was 3 containers of sauces - the two smaller sauces included a green milder sauce, an orange spicier sauce.  The container in the middle was sort of soupy and was made with 20 different herbs and spices (or something like that)  The flavors really melded beautifully in that sauce.  \n\nThe mint lemonade was fair - I think the lemonade was made from a bottle (versus freshly squeezed) but the mint was fresh.  \n\nI had the masala dosa, which is a good choice for a novice.  Next time I will try other things on the menu.  \n\nThis place was easy to get to, had plenty of street parking, good food and service - I will definitely return.

I also tried their Chennai Chicken happy hour app which was completely doused in spices including coriander and cumin - hot sssss!

In an area where there are a lot of great options to eat, DOSA is one of the best I  have dined at in a long while.  Yes, the food was very good, but so too was the service and they sure do have a great wine list.  Bravo for your wine selections.  \n\nOur server was able to explain every dish we asked about.  We ended up sharing some appetizers including a lentil dumpling...beware this is not what you think.  i liken it to an indian version of a mexican layered bean dip.  Same colors too...different flavors all together though.  We love the papadams.  We also loved the 'fries' that we dined on.  Each of us selected a different entree.  All of them came grandly wrapped in a thick or thin dosa which enticed us before it even was placed before our drooling mouths.  I had a masala dosa.  This is a basic spiced potato mixture served in a large wrapping...similar to a crepe or burrito.  It is accompanied by a sweet tomato sauce, tangy green sauce and delicious spicey soup.  Another of us chose the egg dosa...its ALL ABOUT THE EGG.  It too came beautifully presented only open face this time.  Beth had a paper Dosa.  It was thin and crispy rather than chewy crepy.  And so much more.  We all enjoyed the dinner so much.  We cannot wait to return.  I saw a puffed bread walking by that I will have to try next time....its a big balloon bread filled with steam.  They bring it to your table inflated and then you get to stab it and let the steam out.  Again...the wine was devine and well priced for the quality.  We had a CabFrancis of some sort...wish i could remember!  Beth took a picture of the label I will have to get the name.  Anyhow...we loved it so much we ordered another for $48.00.  In another restaurant I bet you would have paid much more than this.  A meal with appetizers and wine came out to 350 or so...two bottles and gratuity included.  I don't know why anyone gives Dosa 4 stars when they can give them 5.\nI almost forgot, they have a tasting menu with wine parings for something like 40.00 or so.

I came with two girl friends on a Monday night around 7 and were seated immediately by the window. We stuffed ourselves and I am now a fan of Dosa and am so so glad that the 7x7 list brought me here! \n\nGood things (so pretty much everything we ordered)\n\nAppetizer:\n- Vada pav (veggie slider): Okay so the name really doesn't do it justice, mostly because I love meat and think all sliders should be made with beef patties, but this was SO flavorful and delicious. The bun is sweet and the caramelized onions provide a nice contrast to the dry but perfectly seasoned potatoes. The dish comes with gunpowder, which is this spicy chili powder that you mix with melted butter to form a chili spread. It's really fun to make haha. BTW this is also super spicy.\n\nMain courses:\n- Channa bhatura: Probably my favorite indian dish ever. This gigantic fried, puffy dough comes out and hot steam actually comes out when you tear into it. It's such a wonderful sight! Then you dip the bread into this wonderfully flavorful chickpea dish and you can expect what my roommate calls a \"food baby\" for the rest of the evening. So worth it. I've had this dish at Vik's Chaat in Berkeley, but the puffy thing is overly greasy there. It's actually quite light and flavorful here.\n- Paper masala dosa: This is what I came to try, the infamous paper masala dosa. It's actually humungous so, if you can visualize, three girls at the smallest table possible with the giant bhatura and now this long dosa too. I think we were in a little over our heads when we ordered :) So our waiter advised us on how to eat this, by tearing off a piece of the crispy dosa and dipping it into the potato mixture and then dipping it into one of three sauces: sambar, a tomato sauce and a coconut sauce. We ended up mixing and matching everything on our table, which was an extremely pleasant experience for our tastebuds haha. The only complaint about this dish is that the dosa itself is a little salty, so dipping it is kind of necessary to offset the saltiness.\n\nDessert:\n- Rasmalai: I don't know how we managed to do this because we basically had carbs for our entire meal, but we ended up picking this. It's a surprisingly light dessert even though it's creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of CHEESE! The rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture. Perfect way to end such a heavy meal.\n\nThe total came out to be $60 after tax and tip. The best part was probably our waiter who explained how to eat everything haha. Definitely coming back to try all the other different dosas...and to have something with meat.", "author": "Shira C."}

The only people who complain (!) are people who are pickier about their south indian eats (like sambar and the dosa). My mom and dad for example thought the place was just OK.

We showed up a little bit early and ended up waiting about 5-10 minutes to be seated at our table. Walking in, this place is super trendy. Past the plain wooden door, a fancy chandelier greets you at the hostess' podium. Tall ceilings draw your eyes up to the balcony area that was reserved for a private party at the time. Then your eyes immediately go to the expansive dining area filled with hip bar seating, circular tables for groups, and smaller tables for more intimate dining.\n\nOnce we sat down, we looked over the menu for a good 5-10 minutes, put them down on the table, and then waited another 5-10 minutes to be greeted by our waitress. Meanwhile, we got not just one, but TWO glasses of water EACH! How did the guy put down additional glasses when he saw that we already had water?! A little miscommunication right there. When the waitress noticed this, she picked up the glasses on her way to the kitchen. Anyways, my friend ordered a drink, the grilled calamari appetizer to share, and the Paneer & Peas Dosa (since according to other fellow Yelpers, the Dosa is the thing to get!). I ordered the Spring Dosa and decided to save my alcohol consumption for the movies :)\n\nIn lieu of bread, they presented us with these things that looked a lot like tortilla chips but were lighter and airier. I forgot what they were called, but they're mighty tasty! Then our grilled calamari came out. It was a simple dish, but pretty good. When our entrees came out, they mixed up our orders and put mine in front of my friend and my friend's in front of me. We didn't realize this until we bit into it... Fortunately, we like to share food and just switched plates after that (also, fortunately, none of us have any food allergies). Since neither of us had dined there before, the guy who served us our food gave us the suggestion of how to eat the Dosa (dip it in the large bowl first and then in either of the chutney's). Both of us preferred the green chutney, and in fact, I didn't like dipping it in the large bowl of sauce first... Just the green chutney was perfect. It was very refreshing. My friend's Paneer & Peas Dosa was really good with the spiced cheese, but I also liked the lightness of my Spring Dosa. The crepe-like carbohydrate was the perfect thickness as to not be overpowering of the filling. I had never had Indian food like this, so it was a great experience. \n\nFinally, since we were in a bit of a time crunch, we asked for the check and tried to get out of there quickly. The service was okay... I could tell they were trying to be very personable and attentive, but maybe it was just too busy? For such a trendy place, though, I would think that it's this busy on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, I had a great dining experience. I don't know if I would come here again just because I wasn't blown away... It was definitely unique and I love going to a classy/trendy place every now and then, but there's so many other choices in the area, I think I would have to try one of those first before coming back to Dosa.\n\nNOTE: The other entrees were in the $20+ range, while the Dosas were about $11-12 and each serving was plenty to fill me up (I didn't finish my plate). If you want something atypical of other Indian restaurants, and want to save some cash, order a Dosa!", "author": "Leana L."}

The menu has a Southern Indian flare with a modern twist.\n\nAs the restaurant name implies, you should try the dosas.  They come in less typical flavors, including masala chutney (with eggplant spread), a lighter veteable (spring) version, and also an open faced version. All come with spicy sambar and other dipping sauces.\n\nFor appetizers, the sprouted mung bean salad has a nice crunch. The mango and goat cheese salad was a good ratio of fruit and tender leaves, scattered with pomegranate seeds.\n\nThe scallops were seared, sitting on top of a red spicy sauce; they were sweet and garnished with just a few micro greens.\n\nFor entrees, the lamb chops are amazing. I don't even eat lamb, but it's so tender, and the sauce is really good with rice.  Chicken korma is rich and not creamy and overly heavy like the traditional kind.  The mango prawns were sweet and plump, with a fruity sauce fir the accompanying coconut rice.  The bread with the channa was slightly sweet, slightly crisp, and the garbanzo beans was addictive - I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed.\n\nOur server was super informative and helpful in navigating the menu.

The restaurant was 60% empty. So we were seated immediately. The slap in the face was that the waitstaff there enjoying themselves and never had the decency to cater to their customers. We are locals, and I can't say I have ever been treated so poorly. These people have such a bad attitude. We chose to leave before we \"inconvenienced\" anyone to pay an ounce of attention. IMO the only thing Indian about this restaurant is their rude waitstaff.\n\nFrom a previous experience, everything here was too salty, but entr\u00e9es were over the top salty and otherwise over seasoned and cooked for the wrong amount of time. Without the hype, I think their food still deserves 2 stars but because I hate hyped up places that can't deliver to the amped up expectations, and with a complete lack of customer service, Dosa's only receiving a single star, and that's only because Yelp wouldn't let me do anything less.", "author": "Jake M."}

I'm not crazy about Indian food but everything was pretty tasty. I had the calamari, spring dosa, chicken curry and some strange soapy tasting drink for dessert. It was my first time trying dosa and I am now a fan! Chicken curry was also yummy. I didn't like the calamari though because I was expecting fried calamari and it turned out to be calamari in its original squid form. Though that was really my fault for not understanding that \"Grilled Calamari\" does not equal \"Fried Calamari\". The dessert drink was also pretty awful but I blame the waitress because she recommended it. When in doubt always go for the gelato, can't go wrong there.", "author": "Queena T."}

Perhaps the expectation was set too high...thought this place was just good, but not such a wonderful dining experience to make it on my \"must return\" list.\n\nDECOR -- 3.5\nWhile the striking chandeliers take your breath away, other details of the restaurant somehow don't pull together.  The general feel of the space felt a little odd: where right by the stairs/bar/route to the restroom was overcrowded, the entry by the kitchen behind the receptionist was oddly empty.  The ceilings were so tall that it felt really spacious, and yet, a little too much so. At the same time the tables are so crowded that you can enjoy your neighbor's conversation.  The crowded feeling extended to the tabletop -- when both of our meals arrived, with the water glasses, water bottle, lassi and wine glass, every inch of our table space was taken up making it hard to enjoy the meal.\n\nFOOD -- 3.5 stars\nWe ordered the original Dosa and the fish curry (Keralasa Fish Moilee I think?).  Both dishes were good and tasted really fresh and we enjoyed them.  However, we were not blown away by it.  Again, perhaps the expectation was set too high.\n\nSERVICE -- 3.0 stars\nOur receptionist was friendly -- we had a reservation and was seated promptly after a little wait since we arrived early.  Our server was also very friendly.  No complaints.  The low rating goes to the pacing of service: our food arrived literally 3 minutes after we ordered, while we were munching on the yumming crispy freebie treat (don't know what it's called).  First was the Dosa, then 2 minutes later, our fish curry arrived to join the party on our table top.  While we appreciated the quick service, I felt a little jarred as it would have been much nicer to finished the dosa, then enjoy the curry.  But we didn't specify that to our waiter, so not their fault, but nonetheless, the food came out so fast that we felt rushed.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I had to dip it into the coconut chutney to help ease the spiciness.\n\nSOUTH INDIAN MOONS UTTAPAM: 5 mini different pancake-like bread with savory toppings.  I loved trying the variety of flavors it came in. Each one was very flavorful and addicting. Great for a party of 4/5, that way everyone can try a piece of each flavor.\n\nTAMIL VEGETABLE CURRY AND PARATHA: it wasn't too spicy, which was perfect for my liking. i loved the big chunks of potatoes and the paratha (fried bread) was amazing. i could have just ate the paratha alone. very delicious dish.\n\nOverall, great service, loved the decor, nice ambiance, and good food!!!\n\nI came with people who love spicy food, which is why we ordered a lot of the spicier foods.

Honestly, it would probably only be getting one star except the service was very good.  The decor left much to be desired with its Jorge Pardo knock-off lamps (Pardo is great; the knock-offs are cheesy) and \"Klassy\" faux candles.  If you're seated in the loft at the two-tops, you'll be closer to the stranger next to you than to your dinner companion, and you'll be better able to hear the next tables conversation as well.\n\nThe food and drinks were decent, but over-priced with NO substitutions allowed due to the owners fascist demands (what??!! the staff wanted to help, but said they would be fired!). Apparently if you have any specific dietary restrictions, you must visit the website first, and if you still want a substitution, you have to get up and ask the owner, if you're there at time when he happens to be in house, and he's feeling generous.  \n\nMy friend had three medium sized prawns in the entree, somewhat tasty but VERY skimpy!  You can get better coconut gelato at your local grocer. Theirs was grainy.

We even asked the waiter if this was normal, and he said it was. If that is normal - PASS on the Dosa.

I've always loved Indian food, but since having to go on a strict Gluten-Free diet, have gotten nervous about just what goes into all those wonderful curries and lovely fried things that I've enjoyed for years.  \n\nTurns out they have a special card which lists the whole menu, identifying which dishes contain any of several major allergens: diary, eggs, nuts, and wheat.  \n\nOur waitress was super-accommodating and even told me that the pappadam was made with some bizarre grain that I had never even heard of (and I know most of 'em!), which may contain trace amounts of wheat.  Having eaten the stuff for years with no problem, thinking it was all lentil flour, I was amazed at how tuned-in she was to the needs of a Celiac diner.  \n\nEverything was wonderful.  I wish I could buy the asparagus soup by the gallon.\n\nThe Pepper Chicken is my favorite - its sauce is so subtly and delicately flavored, with a fiery heat that sneaks up on you.  The heat rises slowly, taking your tastebuds on a real roller-coaster ride.  \n\nI could eat their dosas every day and never get tired of them.  So many yummy fillings and variations.  A plain \"side\" dosa is a great substitute for the Naan I can't have with my Indian food because of the wheat flour.  The regular and paper dosas are gluten-free, look out for the wheat ones.  The cook them all on the same surface, but wash it in between - your call if you're willing to take the cross-contamination risk.\n\nYummy yummy yummy Rasmalai for dessert - everyone else at my table thought it was the most bizarre dessert they'd ever tasted, and I guess for American palates it is kind of odd.  But until you have experienced the joy of fluffy paneer cheese balls swimming in sweet creamy rosewater-flavored condensed milk and dusted with pistachios, you don't know what you are missing.\n\nOh, and it's gorgeous - hip, relaxed, elegant, and fun.

The signature cocktail list is full of winners, and their gin revival menu is an exciting contrast to that spicy list.\n\nDosa is also one of, if not the best designed bar/restaurant space in San Francisco.  The lighting is incredible, both in the effect it has on the room and the design of the fixtures themselves.  The art is both bold and tasteful, each adding a bit of intrigue to the atmosphere, and the furnishings are stylish without being audacious.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the some of the staff seem a little full of themselves.  For example, our bartender Sunday tried to tell my date that he wouldn't make substitutions or alterations to anything on the cocktail list.  Not sure what he thinks his job is, but he's in a service industry, and when a customer orders a drink, he could rightfully try to warn her that the drink may not be as pleasing when made as requested, but in the end, you make the drink that's being ordered. I've been there.  It's part of the job.", "author": "Quinn S."}

My friend arrived earlier to an empty restaurant, as I was running late and was greeted by the host. The host told her to wait for the rest of your party as the restaurant was \"full\". Okay. Interesting. Then our waitress was in somewhat of  a rush or maybe just in an awful mood because she was so eager to take our drink order that we couldn't even ask question? I am not a big tequila drinker but I ordered the \"Khalessi\" drink as part of their HH and I asked if I could substitute the tequila with vodka instead. The waitress rudely and arrogantly replied that \"all of our drinks are pre-made with a specific liquor for a better flavor quality\"...Okay. Weird, but whatever. When I  made the reservation, I left a note to the restaurant to sing happy birthday to my friend. When I requested it from another waiter (so my friend didn't know), the waiter responded that he didn't know where our table was or who my friend is. Talk about excellent customer service. Overall, the food was great. The drinks were nasty and the customer service was very strange. Don't think I'll come back again to this location.", "author": "Sandra V."}

When we arrived for our reservation on a crowded Saturday night we were informed that our table wasn't ready yet and pointed towards the bar. Perusing the cocktail list I noted several gin drinks that sounded interesting so I asked the first bartender whose attention I could get to make me his favorite one. I ended up with the Peony ($10) which featured hibiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, kafir lime leaf and birds eye chili. It was the best drink I have had all year. More complex and delicious than even that celery tasting thing I love at Alembic.  I hope that if I pop in on a Wednesday afternoon before a movie at the Kabuki or something that there will actually be space to sit at the bar. \n\nSo impressed with my five star cocktail, I was very disappointed with the food once we were actually seated. Were I only reviewing the food, I would give two stars. Please do keep in mind, when reading any of my Indian food reviews, that I spent four years exiled in Vancouver and I have yet to find any Indian food in San Francisco that compares. Places I used to love now seem terribly bland. \n\nAnyhow, we ordered the Dahi Vada (lentil dumplings) to start. They were kind of bland, drenched in way more sauce than necessary (hey, why are you wasting that good Strauss yogurt?) basically unremarkable. \n\nNot feeling terrible enticed by any of the vegetarian entrees we each ordered a dosa. While the dosa fillings were fine, I'm used to dosas being served like crepes with lots of crispy edges to dip into delicious chutneys. Dosa's dosas were served like burritos, soggy from their fillings. The sambar that came with was ok; the chutneys were again, very bland. We finished with an onion rava dosa which I was curious to try. Unfortunately the onions weren't caramelized as described and the raw bite of them overwhelmed the dish. \n\nService was excellent, and again, five star drinks.", "author": "Jenn W."}

This makes total sense if you are going to Dosa for crazy south Indian food. Wow this place is satisfying. Like ridiculously satisfying. Organic and sustainable foods and an insanely bad ass seasonal tasting menu here, with four people, you can sample the entire thing to you hearts content. But we went \u00e0 la carte and ordered Hyderabadi Shammi Kebabs (Minced lamb, cardamom, peppercorns, ginger, fennel & lentils, pan fried with mint raita), Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani (Bone-in, natural, basmati rice with an aromatic spiced sauce, caramelized onions, cashews, peas), Duck Vindaloo (Spicy, Goan curry, red chiles, malt vinegar, ginger, cumin, mini potatoes, curry leaves (great with coconut rice)), 2 orders of the South Indian Moons (Chef's selection of five different uttapams), a side of Raita, and some green mango Acharr. And then we died. And then the food came. It was delicious. Dunking the uttapams in sambar was the best part; they are a bit thicker ans smaller than dosa and hold the stew well. Super delicious. The biryani was spicy. Very spicy. And very delicious. Bone in chicken kind can be a hassle but it tastes better so it's a worthy trade-off. The mango acharr was nice and tart, I polished it off little by little with each bite of everything. I do wish we would have ordered more lamb kebabs to start, those were really good, and the plates were smaller than expected.\n\nI also got this weird drink called the South Indian Monsoon. Ginger and mint with pomegranate and mango juice + soda and citrus. It killed me.\n\nAmbiance is sick. If you can get a table next to the rail on the second floor do it. It's an amazing view of the busy bar and 1st level. A beautiful chandelier hangs from above. The interior is very warm and they did a good job of using color, it really pairs well with the cuisine. Goes to show how amazing food plus great design can really complete a dining experience. \n\nOverall, I left stuffed to the point of dying. Seriously, I haven't been that full in a really long time. Great experience.\n\nParking can be a bit of a hassle but you'll figure it out.

The portions here on both were on the smaller size, especially for the samosas.  For dosas, we tried were the peas and paneer and the roasted garlic and onion.  The peas and paneer was excellent, the roasted garlic and onion which was very good, but wasn't really very spicy.  In fact, both could use a bit more heat, or at least the option of adding more for those that aren't as spice adverse.  The dishes we tried where the lamb kofta and as well as a chicken dish (unfortunately, I can't remember which one).  I can't say it everything was as authentic as I had hoped, but they did a great job with the dosas and the accompanying chutneys and sambar.  \n\nI wanted to give Dosa five stars, but the lack of spice in some of the dishes really left me wanting more.

Don't dismiss me right away; I'm pretty much a fan of any cuisine in the book, but I just can't get myself to love Indian. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and price at Dosa.\n\nLet's start with the fact that reservations mean practically nothing at this place, which you kind of expect since it's ridiculously trendy. But c'mon, we had a table for 8 well in advance, and it takes you 30+ minutes to seat us? This wouldn't be so bad if there were ample waiting area at the bar, but walk-ins+reservation waiters jam overstuff this area. It didn't help that my vodka on the rocks cost $12-ish for what seemed like less than a shot. Dosa's got a nice mixed drinks menu, but I'll pass, thanks.\n\nHowever, once we sat, everything was gravy. We had post-dinner reservations elsewhere, and conveyed that message to our waitress, who was happy to oblige. Service was prompt, and the view from the second floor was incredible. Their dosas aren't too expensive given the large portion size; I went with the rava masala. The same can't be said for their appetizers, which are really a two person max and were decent at best. The other main courses around there table were delicious as well; I particularly favored the lamb curry.\n\nAll in all, I'm docking a star for the start of the meal (pricey drinks and a prolonged wait), but strongly recommend this place if you're looking for trendy, delicious Indian food.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

It was just ok.  The dosa didn't seem to have much filling at all. The flavors in the dosa were excellent though, I just wish there had been more filling.  My experience at Udupi Palace, the dosa was PACKED with filling making it a meal for two.  The south indian moons uttapam was disapointing in my opinion.  The uttapams were very small, although I should have expected this.  I enjoyed them but I would probably avoid sharing this dish on my next visit. \n My dinner companions had a hard time with the heat of all the dishes we ordered.  They also felt there should have been more cooling sauces to calm the heat.  Honestly, that didn't bother me, but I like heat.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and the passion fruit custard.  I was quite surprised here, the chocolate cake had so many different flavors it was out of control.  I felt like the pastry chef just couldn't decide what direction he wanted the dessert to take.  This was surprising to me.  I NEVER say things like this about chocolate.  I mean, I will DRINK chocolate if I can I love chocolate so much.  This dish really hit below the mark for me.

If you are going on a weekend you might want to make a reservation.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and offered some suggestions and explained some of the entrees.  \n\nMy husband and I split  2 appetizers, a Dosa, and an entree.  The Dosa and entree were amazing.  I would probably just stick to one or no appetizers next time for 2 people.  I would not order the lentil dumplings appetizer again.  They come cold and covered by a bunch of sauces.   Not exactly what I was expecting.  \n\nOverall, I will definitely be coming back to Dosa for great atmosphere, good service, and excellent food.", "author": "Erica H."}

We ate at the bar which got really packed around 8pm onwards. \n\nI'm surprised at what a good job they did with a south indian menu. The food tasted authentic for the place being so contemporary. Very delicious Dosas. I first ordered the Roasted garlic and chile dosa which i found to be extremely HOT! My mouth and tongue were on fire, so then i ordered the mysore masala dosa and it was very good. The Roasted Garlic and Chile is a good choice if you can handle the spice. \n\nDrinks are pricey but good selection of drinks. The bartenders were very helpful in helping us select good shots. We had a shot called the batsman. I TOTALLY recommend it if you want to do shots. I've never had something like this before. It's gin, vodka and ginger beer. It goes down smooth. I also had the lime soda which is on the non-alcoholic but asked for it to be a vodka lime soda and it tasted very refreshing. \n\nGood Service! \n\nLook forward to going back again.", "author": "Ms C C."}

And the staff was very attentive and pampering. And the cocktails are decadent. . . \n\nThe tricky thing for me is that I am allergic to legumes so I can't eat chickpeas, lentils etc. My server was super helpful in finding out what dishes I could have.  She would go back to the kitchen to ask the chef about the ingredients in the dishes to find out what I could eat.  I really felt taken care of and knew I could trust her to make sure I had the perfect dish.  I ordered the Prawn Masala and the Chicken & Eggplant bharta.  I couldn't just decide on one for me!  YUM YUM!  Unfortunately, I had to abstain on the dosas (chickpea flour) but my fiance and the birthday boy loved their dosas. \n\nI was so pleased with our meal that I didn't realize that I could completely knocked over by the Chocolate Chile Pie for dessert.  OMG -- dark chocolate kissed with chile.  I didn't want to share!  I wanted it all to myself.  But I was nice and let the birthday boy have a good portion but in my mind, I was scheming on how I can get a piece to myself.  Next time, I'm ordering it just for me.

I'm not a food snob, but I do have an experienced pallet.\n\nSo, I ordered the Mung Musala, and here's what I got:  an extremely salty, salt lick dosa - f!@#$#$ horrible.  The salt over-powered EVERYTHING about this dosa, and it was totally unedible.  Additionally, the lental-based soup which attends this dish was extremely spicy and also unedible!  I can handle indian spice, but I'm not Indian so Dosa should know their audience and tame it down a bit to make it edible.  The third indicator was a side of chicken at the recommendation of the bar tender (nice, friendly bartenders by the way and extremely good cocktails; try the Ginger Ante, but don't eat there).  He never indicated it was spicy, and it was so very spicy and also beyond edible.  I was floored by this awful, over spiced, over salted meal on three accounts, and I'm bummed I even went there.

The paper dosa (a huge thin, crispy edged crepe rolled into a tube) served with a bowl of delish seasoned mashed potato with an intermittent cashew here and there was good.  3 sauces came with it but I liked the coconut scented one the best.   The rava was a flatbread shaped crepe with garlic/onion mixed into the batter.  It was good and hubby liked it better than the paper dosa.  Their broken pieces of papadum are very good, served comp.  I enjoyed my mango lassi ($4.50).

The paneer and peas were cooked into the batter so it came out in one flat pancake with the same dipping sauces I got.  \n\nMy friend got the South Indian Lamb Kofta which he thought was excellent.

The greens were freshing to the fried pasty shell surrounding the samosas.\n\nSada Paper - A thin dosa with out the filling. The menu says large but I never expected it to be quite that large. The dosa was about 2 feet long. It comes with 2 dipping sauces and 1 dipping soup (sambar). Not only is the dosa delectable, but it is also a great icebreaker.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-27", "description": "This is a solid 4 star for Dosa, leaning toward the non-existent 4.5 mark. I decided to come here for my birthday dinner since I had this on my go-to list for quite some time. Within the past year I have been turned on to South Indian cuisine and make somewhat-freqent trips to Vik's in Berkeley for lunch, so I am quite familiar with what is widely considered to be \"good\" South Indian food.\n\nKnowing that reservations are not always a given at this location, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they would be able to accommodate my group of 12 on a Saturday night given just one week advanced notice. \n\nI started with a fantastic cocktail: The Bollywood Hills - and tried a few sips of other interesting drinks - all of which were unique and tasty. It would be worth it to come here just for cocktails if you are only up for a drink and want to take in the vibrant atmosphere.\n\nIt is the atmosphere that sets Dosa apart from any other South Indian restaurant that I have been to in the past. Unlike other establishments of similar cuisine, the decor and vibe of the restaurant is one that would be suitable for bringing out of towners or clients, or great for a girls night out.\n\nThe most important aspect of a restaurant is obviously the food - and Dosa does not disappoint. I tried my Vik's staples, the Dahi Vada and a Dosa (I selected a spring dosa) and was please with both the presentation and taste. The Dahi Vada - \"Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced\" was beautiful. I don't think it quite lived up to Vik's version of the dish (not as spicy) but it was still enjoyable and worth ordering again. The Spring Dosa (think large filled crepe) - \"Masala dosa combined with fresh vegetables including peas, carrots, cabbage & red onion\" was different than the normal potato filled version and I felt that it was prepared tastefully - not leaving me feeling heavy or unhealthy. \n\nService was attentive and everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal. You don't have to be a hard core ethnic cuisine lover to enjoy this restaurant. There's something on the menu for everyone and I look forward to going back and trying something new!\n\n(note: I did go back just two weeks after my first visit and ordered the Spring Dosa again...but I really will try something new some time...my Vegan friend - plentyof vegan options available - said she couldn't stop thinking about her meal...)", "author": "Katie S."}

I really like the Peony. And the Smoked Cup. So creative, so refreshing. \n\nWe shared a bunch of starters. The mung sprout salad was good - and had quite a kick. We also had some spicy chicken appetizer which was really good. But the star of the course was the spicy sweet scallops. \n\nBut my entree was outstanding. Lamb Kofta. Little lamb meatballs in a spicy cream sauce. The perfect amount of kick. And the lemon rice they recommend compliments it wonderfully. I got a side of uttapam to go with it and wrapped that around small bites of lamb balls and rice. Mmmm. Delicious. When I finally came up for air and realized I couldn't finish the whole thing, I offered small bites to the rest of the table. SMALL bites. \n\nSo go with a bunch of friends.

We both have never been yet and was totally looking forward to it, especially with such the hype and good reviews.  I'm not really a fan of Indian food to begin with, but I was very willing to check out Dosa for myself.\n\nThe food was actually ok and some dishes were very yummy, but very doughy for the most part (at least what we ordered I guess).  So we got full very quick.\n\nBUT....\n\nCustomer service sucked beyond my understanding.  The hostess was friendly and nice though.  But our waiter....omg our waiter.....he was not helpful nor friendly whatsover.  Looked more annoyed than trying to take our order.  He seriously looked and acted like he hated life altogether.  To top it off, while we were literally still eating and sipping on our wines, he drops the bill in the middle of our table.  Never once did he ask if we needed anything else.  Never once did he ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Oh and yea, by the way, we WERE planning on getting dessert, but obviously didn't care to anymore.  Ooook buddy, that goes your tip, like seriously!  \n\nDosa is a beautiful place and the ambiance is definitely warm and lively.  We were looking forward to a fun and new experience, but instead, ended up walking out greatly disappointed.\n\nI might give Dosa a second chance in the future and if I do, I'll head over to the Valencia location instead.", "author": "Carmen Y."}

Our food:\n- Lotus stem day boat scallops. Perfect.\n- Masala dosa. Classic but sooo good, guys. My boyfriend basically drank his sambar, and then mine too.\n- Trumpet mushroom uttapam. That note of truffle was perfect. It's a good dish, but I'd want to try something new next time.\n- Lamb vindaloo and chicken biryani: The meat in both these dishes was crazy flavorful and tender.

This is probably a special occasion dessert, so I'm hesitant to let you know what you may be missing. Well -- there was white chocolate mousse, red velvet, chocolate flakes, and a perfect strawberry involved. The boyfriend isn't even really a sweets person and he was flipping out about its deliciousness.\n\n5 stars for food. -1 star, unfortunately, for the service.

It had been awhile since I'd been to any Dosa, and I was really excited to finally check out the filmore location. \n\nFirstly, it is a beautiful beautiful room, but I feel it's pretty tough to get a table where you're not cramped around other people. Fortunately, the service is so efficient that you don't feel neglected by your server at all, but it is sometimes tempting to listen to other's conversations -- they're like two inches from you after all. \n\nBack to service. It amazes me how fast our service was, and so attentive. I was impressed. The restaurant was cramped and we never felt forgotten. I asked for quite a bit, and I got everything in an instant without the slightest bit of annoyance. I was impressed. \n\nNow to the food. I feel like it is really not there. I don't know if it's just me or what, but it was like some of the taste was zapped out of the food. I ordered the Dahi Vadi, my usual safe bet, and found it way less flavorful than usual. The balance of yogurt and chutney taste wasn't there - the yogurt taste won. \n\nMy friend ordered a coconut fish dish. His was the winner. I ordered spinach and duck curry. It came in a thin sauce that was very spicy but didn't have that creamy flavor that I usually expect from spinach curries -- usually I order this and many other things at Indian restaurants with the expectation that I'm about to do my body a great disservice. This is something I accept and am even excited about. I felt that the sauce was bland, and asked my friend if I had accidentally ordered the chicken dish instead of the duck because I couldn't tell the difference. Sad face :(\n\nWe got a great sounding dessert, a sorbet with cardamum and some other flavors.

Next, I had their Pav Bhaji, which was super delicious but I had to take it home.  I was getting full and definitely had to leave room for dessert.  (I had the Pav Bhaji at home the next day, it was super tasty!)   I had their Rasmalai dessert, which is a sweet cheese with cardamom and rose water.  It was heavenly!  I was very happy with the food, and so were my friends with their plates.  BTW, I'm a vegetarian and was very happy with my selections.\n\nThe location's beautiful.  It's hard to believe it was a Goodwill store before.  It's essentially a very large room, so it gets a bit loud, but that's part of the fun.

I was quite surprised when it came in a greenish color, but nonetheless, that didn't stop me from eating it. I'm a big fan of potato leek soups and I gotta say---it was on point.

We ordered the Dahi Vada, which is Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced. \n\nThe dumplings were like a hard doughnut, yet it matched perfectly with the cold yogurt. It was also blended with some spices. Put them together in one bite and it's perfection.\n\nWe got another appetizer but I forget the name!

Channa Bhatura Chickpea (garbanzo) masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread or vegan poori.\n- Oversized doesn't cut it, it was HUGE, it was like a huge balloon, then they popped it and deflated it.

Chicken & Eggplant 'Baingan Bharta' Organic boneless, Fulton Valley, roasted & pureed eggplant, peas (great w/ lemon rice)\n- This was one of our favorite dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-01", "description": "Here is my amendment, having taken Anjan's thoughtful comments into consideration: \n\nI do not know much about Southern Indian cooking.  Perhaps it is radically different from Northern India and not spicy, in which case I would suggest that anyone going here should keep it in mind that the food is not spicy and not what most Americans think of when they think of  \"Indian\", nor what one might find if they went to Northern India or Pakistan. I like my Indian food to make me feel a slight burning in my gut that leaves me full and a little sick even when I don't eat that much.  I also like to be surprised when very simple dishes turn out to be really exciting because of the spices.  Not so here.  This is more like Peruvian food, where the flavors come from the sauces everything is doused in. There are some very delicious sauces and the ability to combine them is exciting, but this makes the food a little more like Mongolian or chem lab- not just the simple: indianfood+naan= delicious.  It also means that I have to remember what I liked or didn't like, which wasn't always easy to do, as by the main course there were about 8 sauces in front of me.  \n\nSecond, the prices are high enough that it will keep the riffraff out of all ethnicities.  This is definitely aimed at the Pac Heights crowd, where the cost is not a deciding factor.  While it is great that they are using organic and local foods, $17 for a garbanzo bean soft taco is difficult for me to justify very often.  There are no two ways around this.  As a small, thin woman who loves Indian food, I need two or three dishes and this has ended up being too much to spend on take out that was ultimately not that interesting as a vegetarian-- which Indian food really ought to cater to given that 25% of the country is veg.  \n\nAnd to answer Anjan on that point of local/sustainable: being vegetarian is the most sustainable thing any of us can do and Dosa does not cater to vegetarians.  A quick look at the menu confirms this.   \n\nHere's my rundown: \n\nVeggie Sliders: soft food+soft roll = mashed potato sloppy joe\nSamosas North and South: one is your trad delicious samosa, the other was inedible \nMysore Masala Dosa: tasty but not spicy and a little awkward for delivery/take home. \n\n\nThat said, the staff were friendly when I went there, the ambiance is beautiful, and I would take a person there who doesn't like spicy food but does want to eat Indian and has a lot of money.  That just hasn't happened yet. \n\n*******      ********\nWhat's really going for this place is the ambiance.  If you are an American through and through but want to feel like you have done something  vaguely \"ethnic\" but are afraid of poor people, this is a great choice.  \n\nAnyone who has ever been to India should not be impressed.  The food is not spicy.  It is expensive.  There are only a couple vegetarian options.  I thought the Southern Samosa was a preposterous food item. I cannot justify the pricetag on this place.", "author": "Sarah S."}

Carolynne K. and I were seated next to a fairly talkative group, so prepare for the conversation volume-level wars to ensue immediately on receipt of your menu from the hostess. I liked their selection of mixed adult beverages, but what really grabbed my attention was their \"Mint Lemonade\" sans the alcohol. For a \"dosa place\" I felt conflicted as to why their menu was both small and all-encompassing at the same time. Perhaps a \"customize your dosa\" is in order?\n\nWe started off with their rendition of what was clearly a Casear Salad that hit us with a disappointment of \"garlic\" and watery salad. The flavors were an odd accompaniment to any Indian dish. What made my night though was the endless orders of Papadam that we quickly devoured with their (extra) chili/garlic chutney that would probably force me to surgically remove my tongue once I started consuming it tasty spoonful by fiery spoonful.\n \nIf the chutney wasn't enough to make the drive from the East Bay worth it, the bowl of Rasam (Fire Broth as they call it) was one of the best tomato based soups I've ever had. It was difficult to share in its dominating power of flavor seduction, but I guess we will just have to order 20 bowls next time.\n\nI received my dosa soon after finishing said Rasam, and became increasingly confused as to what Dosa (with a capital D for DSupersmalldosas) was giving me. It was filled with a spiced potato mixture that was unnecessarily lumpy for a \"rip-it and dip-it\" dinner experience, although the flavors of both the batter and the potatoes were supreme.

Honestly, we had no idea what type of food was being served (I suppose without the 4th drink we would have surmised from the decor), we took the lazy route often traveled by patrons of this restaurant and went with the tasting menu (as some of the yelpers have noted, it really is just tasting sized servings as well). I was even lazier and allowed the waiter to go with his favorites.\n\nWith a bottle of wine for the table, great company and sharing what life had brought us over the past year, my friend and I totally enjoyed the experience.

And it doesn't smell like old people anymore. \n\nAnd they're serving South Indian food. If you go you'll want to try the lamb kofta with rice on the side as it has this kind of lingering spiciness that I've only tasted at the dosa on valencia. They recommend the lemon rice as an accompaniment, but I'd go with plain basmati rice if I were doing it again; It isn't bad, but I don't think it adds much & the flavor of the lamb (or anything else on the menu, I imagine) will stand on its own.\n\nI sampled the spring uttapam as well. It's good by itself, but its real value is as a delivery mechanism for the coconut chutney, which you may even want to scoop out of the ramekin with your fingers if you're not all hung up on social conventions.\n\nService is good, not jaw-droppingly so like at the other dosa, but good. And they don't want anything to do with your bag of old clothes but they're nice about it.\n\nBut it's a little steep, and I primarily come to goodwill because I'm low on funds. I mean, if I'm gonna drop seventeen on a little bowl of lamb meatballs, you could at least throw the rice in for free. \n\nIt's worth a try if you haven't been there yet.

Our server was nice enough to also give separate checks so no one is stuck with a way-more-than-they-ordered-$$. \n\nI would definitely come back here again and try other entrees, though i will definitely order the prawns again!", "author": "Lulu C."}

Bf and I came here for happy hour which is from 5:30-7pm so we could try a variety of dishes Dosa had to offer. Turns out they only have four tapas sized dishes during HH for $5 each. We figured, might as well try all of them. \n\nChennai Chicken - fried boneless organic chicken with coriander and cumin served with Straus yogurt. The chicken was so tender and juicy! I loved the spices on meat. I especially appreciated the smokiness and heat from the cumin since it made the chicken that much sweeter and delicious. The yogurt was a perfect compliment, cool and refreshing. YUM all the way! \n\nBlackened Sardines - rubbed and fried with green chiles, coriander, cumin, onions in lime juice. I was never really a big fan of sardines but these were super meaty and cumin again was a big factor in the taste department. The meat was cut diagonally so you could easily fork it into your mouth. \n\nBlackened Spiced Corn - grilled sweet corn, rubbed with cayenne, salt and lime. This corn was spicy HOT but the lime and sweetness of the corn was a nice contrast. I don't normally enjoy food this spicy but I did like this one. However, the portion was pretty ridiculous. Did I really just pay $5 for an ear of corn? \n\nMung Sprouts - sprouted lentils, tomatoes, cucumbers, ginger, grated coconut, seasoned with chile &amp; mustard seed oil. Maybe I just don't like lentils that much but this was kind of a blah dish to me. It was nicely refreshing with all the spicy dishes we got but there wasn't anything really special about it. I didn't taste any coconut either like it promised on the menu. \n\nWe still wanted a little bit more so we ordered an entree to share: \n\nTamil Lamb Curry - Free-range and natural lamb, fennel, tomatoes, poppy seeds, caramelized onions and spices. SO DELICIOUS! The lamb was perfect: succulent and sensational. I honestly think I could eat this everyday and not get sick of it. The side of lemon rice we ordered was more citrus than just lemon. I'm glad it was recommended with this curry. \n\nOn top of the wonderful food and the beautiful atmosphere, Dosa is environmentally concious about their food, equipment, furnishings and even bathrooms.

I actually prefer more hole in the wall types AKA Shalimar and Indian Oven.  \n\nThe only item I liked was the soup, which was on the tasting menu.  It was a cream soup with cauliflower and lots of delicious Indian spices.  The dosas were just ok; a bit heavy as an appetizer and the lamb did not impress me in the slightest after hearing only rave reviews.  First off, it was not tender.  Secondly, the sauce was starting to thicken up as it was brought out to the table.  Lastly, the plate was only half full, since it was part of the tasting menu, so it just looked straight up weird.  The consistency and coloring also reminded me of something which isn't too appetizing, so I'll refrain from bringing that up in my yelp review.\n\nThe desserts were gross.  I don't even want to get into it. Maybe I just do not prefer Indian food for dessert.

My friends RAVED about Dosa in the Mission but, they said it's impossible to get seated there sometimes where it's super busy.  They were so excited to try this place.  Myself, however, was approaching the adventure with a bit of trepidation.  We still had to share a car ride home.  \n\nI wasn't even going to order anything.  But, my generous friends decided to treat me to my first dosa, which is a rice and lentil crepe filled with goodies.  And, it was delicious!  I didn't doubt it would be.  I was just scared for the aftermath.\n\nLight and mildly flavored, my Masala dosa came with spiced potatoes, onions, and cashew nuts, which were all mashed together inside. The mild flavors blended perfectly with with the tomato and coconut chutney that came on the side and the sambar, (a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables) which i was told should be put on the dosa but, truthfully it was just too yummy I ended up eating it just like a soup.  \n\nI held my fingers on the way home in the car with my finger perched on the window handle just in case.

The Jumbo Prawns Masala Curry was spicy enough to make you salivate but not overly so to make you sting. Finished off with something sweet and pleasant that I can't seem to recall at the moment. They were out of Galub Jamoon so they subbed something else and we ate it. Happily. \n\nI left glowing and satiated, feeling like I had experienced more than just a great meal.

I was expecting a more traditional approach to the menu, and was surprised by how bland my Masala Dosa was.  At the time we were eating, every other patron was white and yuppie. Now there's nothing wrong with that, but I usually would expect more members of the ethnicity to dine at a restaurant that served the ethnic food.\n\nI love Indian food, especially South Indian. I was really excited to try Dosa after all the great reviews. My meal (and a good portion of the menu) was \"fusion\" South Indian food without all the great herbs and spices that make Indian food fantastic.\n\nI'm pretty sure an Egg and Cheese dosa isn't really a traditional Indian meal :)\n\nThe ambiance in here is nice, although the waiter and attitude seemed really snooty. Seems more geared toward people who love \"fine dining\".\n\nI thought the meal was not worth the money I paid.

I also want to pay Indian restaurant prices, not French Laundry prices. I also want service that gives a damn and no, I do not wish to pay $5 for an extra sprinkling of paneer on my Uttapam that we all know was nowhere near worth the $15 I dropped on it (pre-$5 charge for paneer).\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love Dosa Valencia and I love their wine list, innovative and creative cocktail menu, and all-out delicious cuisine. I just can't get down with $17 lamb kofta biryani PLUS $4 for a side of rice. I call shenanigans. The environment is nice, and as Eli B pointed out, it's an SF rarity:  a place where the patrons look like they put in a little effort before leaving the house. The waitstaff are also professional and pulled together, if less than friendly. \n\nThe papadum is to die for and I really can't get enough of those lamb balls. Skip the $8 samosa starter (seriously...$8. Samosa. Enough said) and go straight for the spring Uttapam, the lamb balls, and a salad. $100 and something later, you can take comfort in the cheap and classless Goodwill store or dollar store across the street. I still pick Valencia location, hands down.\n\n**Since Anjan (owner of Dosa?) took the time to email me about my review (ummm...I thought it was overall a pretty nice review of a restaurant whose cuisine I enjoy immensely...), I thought I would take a moment to update. As he pointed out, the food is organic and locally sourced for the most part and their animals die happy, politically correct deaths. Of course I'm happy to pay extra for that and kudos to Dosa for their commitment to the environment. That aside, I prefer the Valencia location. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for capable service and ambiance that enhances the dining experience, 3 stars for what I happen to think are exorbitant prices. 5 + 4 + 3 = 12. 12/3 = 4.

I think this is incredibly important when dining at a non-American restaurant with dishes and ingredients that one isn't completely familiar with.

We are experienced Indian foodies and like super spicy food, and our Valencia server recommended really basic dishes that weren't adventurous or spicy at all.

We deviated a bit from her specific recommendations and went with her  \"general guideline\" (1 dosa, 1 entree, 1 app b/w 2 ppl).  Everything below is an absolute repeat; I'll just have to come with more people to order more food!\n\nStarted by splitting the crab vada- (crab cakes).  These literally melted in our mouths which was a problem given that they came surrounded by two different chutneys that leave one wanting to lick the entire plate clean.\n\nNext up we split the namesake Dosa- opted for the Chutney Masala.  Potato filled crepe would be the crude laymen's way to identify this creation.  You can practically taste the time this filling's spent stewing- mouth watering blend of creamy potatoes with some pretty surreal spices.\n\nIn retrospect, we should have stuck to one entree; however as we were starving, we went for the Channa Bhatura (chickpea masala) and Prawn Masala.  \n\nThe Channa came accompanied by a basketball-sized puffed up wheat bread-practically a facial when the burning air steams out.  I wanted to compare this $14 Channa to the $3 Channa I always order at hole-in walls, and let's just say; it earns its dollar figure.  Again, the spices! Not as greasy as some other Channa dishes- one negative is beans felt a little undercooked.\n\nThe Prawn Masala was hands down the piece de resistance of the meal.  I like that most of the ingredients seem to be yogurt/coconut milk based (rather than heavier creams other places use)- definitely easier to digest!\n\nService was efficient (I can see how this could be perceived as rushed), but having worked in this industry, let me tell you it's not called rushed, it's called efficient.\n\nI haven't even discussed drinks!  Coolest cocktail menu!  My mom enjoyed the Batsman- a Gin based, ginger beer infusion with Darjeeling tea I think?  \n\nObviously a knock your socks off, fantastic experience.  This is looking to be my longest review yet, and I absolutely plan on adding to it once I go back for more!", "author": "Gabrielle J."}

Dosa doesn't disappoint.  Service is quick and professional for the main meal, and the flavors of drinks and dinner were spot on.  One of the drinks we ordered outside of the free tasting (actually both) were pretty spendy for what they were, but considering we were getting free samples, albeit slowly, it wasn't so bad.\n\n     Spiciness abounded in every dish, and we had the greens, mango, and goat cheese salad to start, and I had the egg dosa, which was enormous, paper-thin, and delicious with the lentil dipping sauce.  Quite tasty.  They do everything possible to use organic and sustainable ingredients, which is a big plus.\n\n     I'd go out to Dosa if I was with friends in the neighborhood or treating an out-of-town visitor, but we're spoiled for Indian options in Berkeley, Oakland, and on Solano that are just a little more affordable.

After experiencing a really frustrating time trying to set up a friend's bday bash, I wrote about it in great detail on Yelp (hoping to help future birthday bashers from avoiding the same peril).\n\nIn a nutshell, Anjan (the owner) contacted me and apologized for the experience.  What's more, both he and his wife were kind enough to treat the birthday -- er, guest of honor -- as well as myself and other co-party planners to a meal at Dosa.\n\nI have to say that this was not only a very congenial way of dealing with an unsatisfied customer, it was also very classy.  Anjan made sure to contact me after the dinner to see how things went, and his wife even stopped by to say hello (and kindly give us a copy of a recipe that was being served that evening).  \n\nSure, some people may say that the Dosa on Fillmore doesn't have the same laid back feel as the original one in the mission - but after this encounter, my faith in them has been restored.  I hope that they can prevent future mishaps so they don't need to un-ruffle feathers of future patrons.  However, for me, I was impressed.\n\nAs for the food - DEFINITELY get the DOSA.  Although other things are good, there is a reason they called themselves Dosa.  The Chicken Biryani from my first visit was a little to spicy for my taste, and I had to douse it in yogurt to calm it down for my palate.  \n\nSo thumbs up, Dosa on Fillmore.  I'll definitely retract my earlier qualms, and I hope you have better successes with large parties.", "author": "Shay F."}

Food was good -- oil / spice / salt did not overpower the taste or type of dish.  Had to bring this review down one star due to the restaurant's prices.  DAT is around $18 for a 2-course lunch, and regular dishes are around $10-15 each, while drinks are $3-6 each.  They do serve alcohol for lunch and dinner --saw a lot of people grabbing the fruity drinks.  \n\nDishes to try are the pancakes (uttapams [sp?]) and dosas.  The masala ones are good and so is the plain long dosa (it's this huge, thin, crepe-like roll served with chutneys --dipping sauces).  The mango lassi was delicious, creamy and quite thick --so consider sharing.  Chai tea is a favorite as well.  So, although all the food was overall good, there was one dish --sambar, which came with both pancakes and dosa, was extremely salty.  The lunch companions didn't care for it and thought the other dipping sauces were average and either too thick or too watery (coconut and masala).  \n\nDecor here is Ikea-classy with a clean airy atmosphere which isn't typical of the mom-and-pop indian places down in SJ, or the naan-n-currys in the city.  It's definitely a step up place where you can have a relaxing lunch and not come out smelling like spices and oil --service is attentive and pleasant.\n\nWould be back if I'm with a group and am craving both an upscale / modern atmosphere and Indian food.", "author": "Jennifer Y."}

I wrote the following 1-star review exactly a week ago and 5days later my critical opinion of Dosa was deleted by Yelp HQ... due to my graphically descriptive personal assumptions.  Well I'm pretty sure that the person that I wanted to read it did, along with the vast people that were on Fillmore that wkend looking for somewhere close to eat.  Since I received an email from the owner, (proving that Dosa does care about their customers) I have updated my review to 3-stars.  The following is that review... revised.  \n\nAs I was picking up the foul feces that my dog just dumped, I was reminded of the shitty service that I just experienced last night at Dosa. Did the owners or management of this restaurant that I once raved about, change recently? I have been here before a couple of years ago... and even Yelped it 5 stars back then.\n\nMy review today is purely based on the bumptious hostess, Noel... that exuded the worst customer service that I have experienced in a long time. Lately it's rare that I have been to a restaurant in the city with less than 4 stars. \n\nMost likely a majority of their clientele are film buffs, since Kabuki is conveniently across the street. So after reading some of the recent Yelp reviews, we came earlier than our Open Table reservation... to make sure we had enough time before catching our movie.\n\nThe tone of her voice and lack of sincerity in her half-ass smile was so blatantly rude.\nI let it go when she smuggly said that she had to seat the people in front of us. So as we stood by the open inviting bar, I noticed a couple entering after us... saying they did not have reservations... So I naturally thought as I walked back to Noel, that she would give us the same common courtesy that she gave those in front of us. But as I approached, the couple that just came were being seated at the very table that we should have been taken to. Wow. I definitely called her on it... but she just patronized that we were being seated now. As we followed the guy she gave the menus to, he was leading us to the very back towards the stairs... when there were many empty tables on the main dining area... Normally that wouldn't have ticked me off so much like it did, but my friend just got back from her doctor and has a broken toe... She was wearing flip flops, when she always wears heels. I stopped following him, and luckily there were seats open at the bar.\n\nSo the food hasn't changed; still flavorful and delicious as I remembered. And the bartenders were attentive.  Unfortunately the beautiful decor pales in comparison to the unpleasant service that I received initially from the hostess, which dampened my entire dining mood.", "author": "Myra M."}

I got the grilled calamari appetizer which is good but something I'd pass on the next time.  The lamb kabob appetizer which is more like a mini lamb meatloaf was pretty good.\n\nThe dosa was great.

Crunchy, creamy, sweet, mellow, spicy, hot and cold.  Its such a wonder combination.  The food here is anything but boring.\n\nThe mango lassi is extremely thick.

Despite having reservations, we were directed to wait at the bar.  This was OK as the decor is beautiful and we are never averse to a pre-dinner cocktail.  What transpired was a horrible experience at the bar.  My husband requested a VO Manhattan.  The bartender stated they didn't have VO and suggested another Canadian Whisky.  When my husband declined his suggestion, he appeared to be intensely angry.  My husband then requested Glenlivet Scotch and he stalked off and came back with the drink.  He never even acknowledged my presence or asked if I would like anything.  You could see him angrily gesturing and talking about us to another bartender.   When he returned with my husband's drink, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails and my husband asked him what we had done to offend him.  Apparently he must have been having a bad night because he immediately gave us a couple of free appetizers (which we wouldn't have ordered otherwise).

My boyfriend and I ordered off of the pre-fixed tasting menu, which was a little less daunting than the main menu. For the appetizer, I got the seafood vada. It was alright, not a HUGE fan, but I liked it for the most part. The mini dosa was probably my favorite part of the meal. I got the Paneer and Peas dosa, which was not only the perfect size, but the chutneys were incredible! Such succulent flavors... I also tried a bit of my boyfriend's Cilantro-Mint Masala and it was sooo good!\n\nI also had the vegetable curry, which was kind of unmemorable. It was too spicy for me, but I guess I should have anticipated that with South Indian food! The dessert was SOOO good - I got the passion fruit custard, and I would highly recommend it. \n\nOverall, the decor inside was absolutely beautiful. We came without a reservation on a Saturday night, which was not smart. I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand. However, we only waited about 10-15 minutes before two seats at their large communal table opened up. Within half an hour of sitting down, the restaurant had cleared significantly. Last, Dosa's location is perfect for a date night, because Kabuki Sundance Theaters are right across the street! Great night and great food. Thanks, Dosa!", "author": "Catherine C."}

But I was surprised to be in the article since the author never met or interviewed me. Had she done so, she would have seen that I'm sweet, well-mannered, and considerate (to a fault) in real life. Okay, so I talk about dick from time to time. Shut the fuck up.\n \nI tend to speculate, so I wondered what it would have been like if I had been interviewed. Say, if I met the author for dinner at Dosa on Fillmore instead of my friend. Surely she would have seen that I'm not this raving cock-starved lunatic with a perma-erection and Tourette's, right? Then I remembered journalists are people. And, like most people, they have already made up some bullshit narrative about you. Once ossified, very little can break the lineaments of character, even if they happen to be untrue. I could have been more charming than Oscar Wilde or more cultured than a milk product, but her story about me still would have prevailed.\n\nMe: Wow! I think the folks at Dosa have done a great job making a very large space cozy and welcoming. I approve.\nArticle Author: \"I met Darin over drinks and dinner at Dosa. Always cognizant of the merits of making a grand entrance, he quickly sashayed through the heavy wooden doors like Liberace on coke, trailing his scarf behind him. As he took in his surroundings, he squealed with glee and mused that the large, open dining area reminded him of his distended asshole after getting tag-teamed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\"\n\nMe: Aside from the different art mediums on display here -- photography, painting, sculpture -- I truly love those marvelous LED light sculptures/chandeliers designed by Sharon Marston, you know, the threaded metal ones resembling dust clouds in the front window? Beautiful and environmentally responsible to boot.\nAA: \"Those chandeliers make my dick hard. FUUUUUUUCK.\"\n\nMe: The North/South Samosas are very good. The only problem? I had a hard time tasting the difference between the \"North\" Samosa (spiced potatoes) and \"South\" Samosa (caramelized onions and veggies).\nAA: \"Clearly unimpressed with the samosas, Darin stuck his hand down his throat and tried to puke it up for the server in order to register his disapproval.\"\n \nMe: Now, the Mysore Masala Dosa? Top notch. The light spread of the lentils within; the spongy Dosa bread as it absorbs the spices from the sambar -- Good God! If it wasn't for the refreshing coconut chutney my mouth would be on FIRE right now.\nAA: \"The Mysore Masala Dosa reminded Darin of the time an overzealous Rice Queen spread Sriracha cock sauce on his anus. 'Surprisingly,' he said, 'it had a numbing effect. Which, really, was the best thing because I didn't give a fuck about this guy and the less I felt, the better.'\"\n \nMe: My Tamil Lamb Curry is extremely well-prepared, though fennel detractors should avoid it since that's the strongest note. But the chunks of lamb are sizable and very tender.\nAA: \"Ever fuck sheep?\"\n \nMe: I really loved our server, Jenny. She was professional, helpful, informative, and friendly -- excellent service. Totally fine with leaving a sizable tip on the $78 bill. It's a little pricey, but considering we ordered enough food for 3 or 4 people, completely acceptable.\nAA: \"When the check came, Darin glanced at it and started fuming. 'I'm sorry, but why weren't we comped for anything?' he asked our hapless server. 'Do you motherfuckers have any IDEA who I am?!? I AM IMPORTANT!! ME! ME! ME! I'M DARIN I., BITCHES!

YOU BETTA TELL YOUR MANAGER TO DRAG THEIR ASS HERE BECAUSE, YEAH, YOU FOLKS ARE GONNA HAVE A BIG FUCKING PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS WHEN I START SLINGING ONE-STAR SHIT ON THE INTERWEBS UNLESS I GET THOSE FUCKING SAMOSAS REMOVED FROM THIS BILL!!!!!'\"\n \nAnyway, I highly recommend Dosa on Fillmore.

This location has made eating Indian sexy in a big way with their high ceilings, large bar area and eclectic styling of their decor, giving off a intimate feel.\n\nThe food from what I understand is an authentic version of Southern Indian cooking.  While you might expect bird feed size portions, most dishes are adequate for sharing and usually are accompanied by a side of yogurt and a lentil based soup.  After two visits here, I can't say I found a dish that I didn't like.  The tastes and smells are just as vibrant as the atmosphere.  You can't forget to wrap up your meal without ordering the Gulab Jamoon (sticky, syrupy goodness) and the Rasmali (sweet cheese that sounds weird, but tastes good).  The cocktails are well prepared, with the bar stocking top shelf goodness like Hangar One Vodka.  \n\nDosa on Filmore will help you rethink your Indian food fears and get your evening right as a place to kick off things with a couple of cocktails and small plates or to wrap it up with a 4 course meal.  \n\nAnd to answer those that are thinking you'll smell like food after coming here, well \"You won't!\" and \"It's not that kind of place!\"", "author": "Jason A."}

I know know what I like, and I really like Dosa.\n\nI had some friends in town and they suggested we have dinner and drinks at Dosa. We decided to do the get several things and we all shared them. We started with drinks. I had the Emerald Sound and I have to say I loved it. I don't know what my friends drank, but managed to have every drink on the menu. Some were exquisite, others not so much. That's ok, because there are many types of alcohol I don't like.\n\nWe ordered Samosas and they were tasty. We then did the uttapam sampler. The lentil dipping was incredible as well as the different flavors of the uttapam. Actually all the dipping sauces were good. We then went for the cliantro/mint dosa which was delicious as well. The potatoes were spiced but not spicy, which is my preference.\n\nWe finished with dessert. We all three had the banana cream pie, the chocolate cherry cake with spiced ice cream and the passion fruit tapioca. They were all good, but a little disconnected from the rest of the menu. While the drinks and food had a very distinct flavor, the desserts did not. Our waiter said that originally, they only had a few Indian desserts on the menu, but they didn't do that well and had another pastry chef come up with those. While they were tasty none the less, I think the chocolate cherry cake came the closest to fitting in with the spiced ice cream which did compliment the meal nicely. However, the passion fruit tapioca was light and fluffy and did suit being the finale in a spicy meal.\n\nSo, I highly recommend Dosa. I did knock off a star for high prices and not a convenient location for me, but it is an excellent restaurant for vegetarians and the drinks are yummy and original.

For the most part the food was still fantastic - especially the Chennai Chicken which should be banned in 47 states for being so damned addictive. My Prawn Chile Fry was ok, portion seemed a bit skimpy (especially when compared to the mound of crack chicken that my friend had) I went with the Paneer & Peas mini Dosa and Lamb Curry to round out my meal - both were really good.\n\nLet me back track a bit - the majority of our table decided to do the wine pairing with the tasting menu and all agreed that it was a mistake. The pours were pretty skimpy and while the menu said \"Select one half glass with each course\" it actually only came with the first three courses. So for $18 we basically got 1.5 glasses of wine...and what we got was pretty much forgettable and didn't pair well with the spicy fare. Next time I will definitely stick with beer! \n\nOk, last complaint - desserts. The five of us tried three different desserts and again all agreed that they were the low point of the meal. We left the plates half eaten which never happens with our group and dessert!\n\nOverall I actually feel like Dosa is more like a 3.5 star restaurant. Prices can definitely creep up (we spent $80 a person on dinner not counting our first round of cocktails at the bar) but for the most part the food is pretty good.

The front of the house man, maybe the owner or manager was really attentive and was smoozing as appropriately.  \n\nMy favorite part about Dosa is the ambiance.  They did a wonderful job setting up the place, the high ceilings and lighting make the atmosphere relaxing and enjoyable.  Most importantly, that place is well ventilated.  I have long hair and whenever I leave indian restaurant, I smell like a spice rack.  Dosa is probably the first real Indian restaurant I've been to and didn't have to go home and wash my hair.  Thank you for that :)\n\nThe cocktails are really fun and well crafted.  We did family style so I got a chance to try the paper masala, onion rava, a curry and veggy dish.  The dips were really cool too for the dosa entrees.  \n\nThe restaurant is on the pricier side, which is understandable since the space is really cool.  I live nearby and walk past the restaurant regularly and it's amazing to see how happening this place is.  I'm glad there's an indian restaurant in the hood and I foresee this place staying awhile and becoming a Flllmore establishment.", "author": "Laura H."}

Hey, doesn't that guy look like a pimp?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"The one walking into Burger King.\"\n\nSure enough, across the street, A man dressed in a white suit, top hat, a red shirt and a cane walks into Burger King.\n\nThe Fillmore.  Karaoke Lounges.  Yoshi's.  Safeway.  Japan Town Center.  Pimps.  At the crossroads of Japantown, Fillmore, and Western Addition, there's little that surprises me anymore--since everything's out of place, nothing's out of place.  Dosa is no exception.\n\nAt Dosa, you'll find an affluent, well-dressed crowd, a fancy interior complete with a trendy communal dining table, and the menu to match.\n\nBut how's the food?  It's OK.  A party of 8, we all sampled each others' dishes including a variety of dosas (a buttery Indian crepe, filled with everything from chick peas to masala to cheese); curried lamb, duck, and chicken.  While some of the dishes were either too salty, spicy, or heavy on the ghee, we all agreed on the curry duck, coconut rice to go with our entrees (even though the menu sometimes suggests otherwise), and the sada paper dosa.\n\nThe bill came out to about thirty bucks a head.  I would recommend Dosa for the ambiance, but it's a hard sell when you have pimps walking into Burger King across the street.  As for the food, I've had better Indian food that tasted a lot better for a lot less.\n\nMaybe things would be different if Dosa were here in a different time or place.  But for now, three stars it is.\n\nUPDATE:  So I get an email from Anjan, one of the owners of Dosa, who writes, \"I'm sorry we made so many mistakes with your dishes.  You should have sent them back and we would have gladly remade them for you.\" He continues, \"We are the ONLY Indian restaurant that uses primarily organic, natural and/or sustainable ingredients, hence the higher prices.\"\n\nAn email like this actually means a lot to me--there have been several times when owners of businesses I've yelped either a) tell me how I should write my reviews or b) fail to address what rubbed me the wrong way.  Anjan didn't do either--in fact, gave me a reason to want to come back.  That earns another star in my book.", "author": "Tony L."}

With advance reservations and three tables empty, the hostess tries to sit us at the table by the bus area and kitchen door. Seriously?! We have to say no can we have a quieter table. I do not understand that. Then to make matters worse they take forever to bring my boyfriends drink, which means the rest of the table with wine is waiting. The tables are also very close and crowded, you have to move them so people can get in and out easily. With that being said, the food is pretty fantastic. I loved the sauces, the Dosa was great.

As someone who doesn't care much for northern Indian eats, Dosa was the first southern style spot I tried and turned me onto how awesome dosas and uttapams really are, especially when served with fresh vegetables and flavorful dipping sauces. I like bringing out-of-towners to Dosa, as it tends to be a crowd-pleaser. I can't recommend the entree-type curries, but only because I stick with small plates (the fire broth and bright salads) or the right half of the menu (dosas + uttapams).\n\nI like the communal table, I like the bar, and I like the normal tables, too. I don't like to wait here, so typically opt for one of the first two options unless we've made a reservation.\n\nThe service can be off and I've had water poured on me (and a cocktail, accidentally, too) and seen it dumped on others (as in, a full pitcher down a guy's back at a neighboring table the last time I was in).", "author": "Allie H."}

Then across the street to the Kabuki to see The Reader (HELLO. Kate Winslett in multiple sex scenes), and then back to Oakland to the Conga Lounge at 11, where another group of friends thought \"80s night\" would be fun.  \n\nRight.  Because I just can't get enough Toto and Styx in my life. \n\nI only sound like I'm complaining. Every once in a while, I secretly enjoy cramming way too much crap in to a day. \n\nDosa was a very civilized bright spot in the day. I had high hopes for it since the friend who organized it is a professional chef, and another is South Indian, but he grew up in Kenya so he was basically worthless, except for tormenting the waitress with his fake Indian accent.\n\nAnd speaking of the waitress, she was awesome.  I love it when servers confidently make recommendations in a place like this where the food is unfamiliar, and know the menu - including wine list - inside and out.  Cute doesn't hurt either. \n\nShe was so good that she talked me in to the incredibly tasty Bengali Gimlet made with gin, a substance I have sworn off ever since I was 14 and drank half a bottle out of my parent's liquor cabinet.\n\nWhere is this even going? I seem to be losing focus here. \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful.  Long silvery bar, high ceilings, lots of space. This is way more my style than the more cramped Valencia location. We had a few different dosas, all excellent. The highlight for me was the Chennai Chicken starter and the Kerala fish with coconut sauce, cilantro & chiles. Yes please. I was also happy to be able to order some leafy greens, which is usually missing from Indian restaurant menus. The mixed greens with mango & goat cheese totally hit the spot. \n\nNow I just want to spend the day doing nothing but watching the Super Bowl and nursing my hangover. \n\nOh right.

Give some thought to the four-course tasting menu on the cover of the menu; a series of wine pairings is available with it.

As a confession, I didn't even know what a dosa was before coming here. I used to live in the Western Addition and have probably walked by this spot dozens and dozens of times. It's hard for me to believe that Dosa used to be a Goodwill store. Yes, its remodel really is that good. \n\nLuckily, its location and decorations isn't the only thing that's fabulous about Dosa - the menu definitely doesn't disappoint. I had the biggest Indian crepe, (also known as a DOSA) here last night and enjoyed my meal inside the restaurant's upstairs section. The upstairs eating section is much more intimate than the ground floor. Sitting upstairs places you in arms length to a private bar, and it gives you a great view of diners eating below on the bottom floor. \n\nThe ambiance is dark in here, the lights are dim and small votive candles are placed at your table to give off an intimate feeling. Probably best to bring a date or some close friends. \n\nThe culinary stars of my dinner last night were without a doubt the Red Beet Soup and the chutney's that came with the North and South Samosas. I loved the spices that slowly burn your mouth and turn your tongue into jelly. The spicy dosa I ordered was really fun to eat dipped into the lentil dipping soup it comes with. It may be primal of me, but I've just always loved eating food with my hands. It just seems like a dosa is just perfect for that since it's essentially an Indian version of a crepe. I'll definitely be back - after all, there's just so much more to the menu to try.", "author": "Laura G."}

For a sunday, it was really busy, but then again, Michael Bauer's review did just come out in the paper giving the place an overall of 2.5 stars. \n\nThe space is fantastic. Great vibe, cool bar area and I love the concept behind the communal table. Only drawback is that at most places with communal seating, it serves as a first come, first serve type of deal, however at Dosa, it is used for reservations. \n\nWe started at the bar with a drink, as we arrived a little earlier than our reservation time. The drinks were nice and refreshing, really light, but not very strong. We didn't have to wait long to be seated.\n\nBeing our first time at Dosa and not really knowing what to expect, or to order for that matter, we decided on the tasting menu with the wine pairings. We all got something different, so with the three of us, we were able to taste a good amount of the food. \n\nStarters were good. We opted for the mung beans, crab cake and chicken. Crab cake was all crab and it came with this habanero chutney that is amazing. I absolutely love spicy food and it was soooooo good. It was so good, that I asked for a side of it (which they ended up charging me for, and took away from me in the middle of the meal as they were clearing, so that was a little disappointing). \n\nNext were the dosas and my friends and I have never had them before. We didn't really know what to expect, we tried 3 different ones and my favorite of the three was the Spring dosa. It was crisp on the outside and the veggies were really good. The different chutneys were good, however I didn't really care for the coconut chutney. \n\nFor our third course we had the lamb, fish and chicken curries. The Lamb was the best of the three, but the fish was really moist and literally melted in your mouth. The lemon basmati rice is delicious. \n\nAs for the wine pairings with each course, I probably wouldn't do it again. I would have rather gotten a bottle of a dry sweet wine for the first two courses and then perhaps move onto a red, but you could drink a white for the whole meal, since most of the meal is has a lot of spice. \n\nWe ended with the three different desserts on the tasting menu and the best was the chocolate sorbet. The fried milk dough ball was a little too sweet and sits in syrup. On the menu it states that you get two balls, but we only got one. The rasmalai cheese dessert was not suited to my taste but you can't beat chocolate, so that's what I liked. \n\nOverall the meal was good. Service was good, our server knew the menu and food well. We enjoyed ourselves on a rainy sunday evening and I will definitely find myself there again. I'm interested to know what lunch is like, since the menu is a bit different.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

Save a bunch of $$$. \n3. Do more community service. \n4. Get to REALLY know your friends. \n\nWell Dosa won't help me w/ most of those, but at least I know where to go in case I feel like cheating. ;) \n\nSo I'm here to kick it w/ the wonderful Linda T, who is visiting from So Cal. I have never had south Indian food, so I didn't know what to expect. \n\nFirst impression. \"Wow, this place is posh.\" Brand spanking new everything. Clean as a whistle. Huge interior w/ high ceilings. \n\nThe place was full of people, but it didn't see too cramped for me; nobody looming over the table, nobody giving the evil eye when we were chatting over dinner, no waitress taking plates off our table prematurely. This was a plus. \n\nSo I decide on having the Paneer and Peas Uttapam (sorta hard to describe, but it tasted like a potato pancake w/ farmer's cheese and peas. Served w/ some great sauces. It was light and tasty. The sauces were each very different. The white sauce was sweet w/ a slight coconut milk taste, the orange sauce was more tangy w/ a taste of curry. The soup-like sauce was well....soupy *Dam, I should have taken notes*. Despite it being completely vegetarian, it didn't lack in flavor at all. I was completely full after the meal. \n\nI wouldn't say it's a cheap place, but w/ the fresh ingredients, the time and care spent in cooking the food, the ambiance, the space, the light friendly atmosphere...you are definitely getting what you pay for.

My company went out of business and I have joined the ranks of the fastly growing unemployed. I recognize this should leave me plenty of time to be Yelping my brains out, however I found it depressing to sit back and review the amazing restaurants and bars that I will be taking hiatus from in my time of poverty. Sigh...\n\nThe good part about being unemployed is that people feel bad for you and want to do things to try and \"help.\" For my friends this means either getting me good and drunk or fed...or both. A few nights ago, my best friend Billy told me he was going to succeed at getting me tossed and full of delicious food. I happily and eagerly agreed. In the cab over, I casually asked what type of cuisine we would be enjoying that evening. Japanese? Mexican? Thai? Persian? Any of these would rock my world. Billy simply responded with \"You'll see.\" \n\nWe pulled into Japantown and my mouth began to water with thoughts of grilled seabass and salmon sashimi, but the minute Billy held the door open to a place called \"Dosa\" my expression dropped.\n\nI should probably tell you now that I generally loathe Indian food. This isn't just a disliking of the cuisine, it is a profound hatred. For whatever reason, it turns my stomach...normally. It is here that I humbly admit I may have turned a corner in my battle with Indian food. \n\nBilly ushered me straight to the bar and proceeded to pour bottles of wine and martini glasses brim full of Manhatten's and other delicious inebriations down my throat. He's a smart boy and knew that the only way he would survive this dinner was to start by getting me good and plowed. The bar scene is over the top Hollywood-esque. I love the energy and artwork in this restaurant. It's very visually stimulating.\n\nFinally our reservation was called and we moved to the table. The waitress introduced herself and was extremely friendly. I proceeded to embarass Billy by grabbing her sleeve and asking her assistance in ordering as \"I can't stand Indian food.\" Rather than turning up her nose at me, she smiled, laughed and told me she hears this multiple times a day. She quizzed me on things I like and don't like and took the menu from my hand. \"I'll take care of you honey.\"\n\nTo start, samosas with some sort of sweet and tangy sauce that I loved. Along side, she had ordered me a salad with mango and nuts. If it isn't authentic, I don't care...I ate every last fork full. Then came what they are famous for which is the \"Dosa.\" To me it looked like a giant empanada with three sorts of dips alongside (forgive me, half my extended family is from Argentina). One of the dosas that came out the waitress warned me was \"waaaaay spicy\" and contained habaneros and mango. Again, probably not authentic but I was down for the challenge as I love spicy food. I popped a bite in my mouth, and it definately came with a kick but nothing painful.\n\nOverall I had an excellent night at Dosa and appreciate Billy for basically trapping me into trying it out. Perhaps I have changed my mind about Indian cuisine....either that or I have mastered ordering the most non-traditional items on the menu to keep me happy. \n\nBonus points for being across the street from the Kabuki theater...my fave.", "author": "Lynsey C."}

Dosa serves Southern Indian food so there is no such thing as Naan in the southern part of India. We ordered the Chicken Frankie, Chicken Biryani, Spring Dosa and Masala Uttapam. My favorite is the is Frankie (chicken, onion, cucumber & cilantro wrapped in roti bread and sauce)--delicious. The Chicken Biryani is sort of like the indian fried rice with chicken drumstick, onion and spices. The Spring Dosa is very refreshing and the vegetables (peas, carrots, cabbage and red onion enclosed in a crepelike wrapping) are very crunchy. The Masala Uttapam is a pancake with potatoes, onions, nuts and spices--very tasty.  Four stars for really tasty and flavorful food.\n\nThe ambiance here is really nice with Chandeliers and beautiful hanging golden leaf displays (4 stars.)\n\nService is good the waitress kept on coming back to ask if we needed additional food and refilling water. Did not get to try the dessert because we ordered quite a lot of food and the portions are large (4 stars.) I will definitely come back next time to try dinner.", "author": "Allison H."}

Thinking it'd only register as pleasantly hot given my penchant for spicy food, I inwardly smirked when the waitress paused to warn us it was very spicy.  She wasn't kidding.  I think that starter seared a tastebud or two; I nearly asked for a bucket of ice to cool my tongue!\n\nThank goodness for the Bowler cocktail, which provided a little liquid relief from the burning.  It was a little sour for my taste, so I'll try something else the next time I go, but I'll give them credit for their inventiveness.  My friend's Batsman was more to my liking.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the duck spinach masala & paneer and the tamil lamb curry, with a side of lemon rice.  It was extremely tasty.  The duck and lamb were both soft, moist and succulent, and the spices lent to the rich savoriness of the dishes.  Lemon rice was the perfect compliment, adding a nice brightness to balance out and complement the rich, spiciness of the main dishes.\n\nThe restaurant is definitely a place I'd go back to for ambience and cocktails, and higher-end Indian food.", "author": "Janet L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-12", "description": "A Review of the Tasting Menu at Dosa:\n\nAbby and I live down the street and decided to choose Dosa as the site for a special celebration dinner. Seeing as it was a special occasion we opted for the four course tasting with accompanying wines.\n\nWhile the tasting was fun and allows for a lot of freedom in choice (each person can order different items and wines), nothing that came out really lived up to the price tag, and as a whole, when I picture all four courses together they just don't equal what we paid for them in their quality, presentation, or originality.\n\nThe dosa was great, but was not enough to carry the meal. Plus, you can get the same dosa on their lunch menu (exact same dish) for pennies on the dollar. This was my main problem with Dosa's tasting menu, it wasn't anything special, it was just more money. Step it up!\n\nThe other dishes, a curry, some shrimp, two bland desserts, were ok, but not the kind of thing the price brings you to expect. Another fault was the seating, when you make a dinner reservation and are enjoying a four course meal you (or at least I) expect a table in the restaurant, but to my surprise we were seated in the bar, which might be great for sharing a few appetizers but is quite unsuitable for an actual dinner.\n\nAt the e end of the day the dinner for two consisting of four courses and matching wines (no dessert wine though? WTF!) put us back about $200. Its not that this is a crazy amount to pay for a meal, but in San Francisco there are just too many other great establishments that do a much better job for much less. A fact that makes it hard to stomach paying out such cash for a few tender tandori shrimp and micro greens.\n\nThat all said the food is good, and if you go at lunch or brunch you can get the same food we paid top dollar for at a much more fitting cost. And seeing as they make a delicious curry bloody-merry I am sure I will find my way back at some point, just not for dinner.", "author": "Alex D."}

It's a little different than the mom & pop Indian restaurant. Is it great? Well, it's good, have I raved about it? Not really. If it comes up in conversation, I say it's good, I love the chandeliers, you know, the two that look like jellyfish floating over you... Do I say great things about the food. Not really. I like it, it's tasty, the Dosa is different, the drinks are good, and very interesting. \nService ~~ so this is where the hit points come in. Service has been (believe it or not) spotty. As an example. We dined there last night. Our server says to us, that he thinks he waited on us before. My partner agrees it's possible. The server as he's talking to us I feel the spray of spittle on my cheek. Now, this happens in life. We all have those embarrassing moments where something like this happens. I KNOW this, so I say nothing, and after he leaves, I wipe my cheek, and enjoy my drink & conversation. The server returns later in the evening, and yes, low and behold it happens AGAIN! OK, so this time I'm a little concerned b/c it happens so frequently. I tell my partner who is immediately grossed out. As it is, the server happens to have the table next to us too. He is telling them about how the owners of Dosa follow Yelp regularly. Our server never comes back to refill my water (ever), and until after I'm done with the main course does he happen back to ask if I want another drink. \nNOT very good service. It he really waited on us before, and did this poorly prior. I doubt I would have come back. I'm amazed that he talked about the owners being concerned by what was said on Yelp, and still he did a poor job with service. \nI guess his bosses read Yelp, and he doesn't.", "author": "Jim H."}

Soooo good.  Next was south indian moons, 5 varieties of uttapam served with three dippers...a coconut goo that was epic, a tomato puree with some bite and a lentil soupy thing...I just wanted to stick my face into each one.\n\nFollowing that came channa bhatura, chickpea masala that came with a giant puffy bread thing.  Omg, this was sooooo good, I was eating giant scoops of it.  A teeny bit spicy, which was fine with me.

We had it with a plain dosa, which was perfect.\n\nAt this point, everyone was pretty much stuffed, so we bagged the final dosa we orignally ordered, the spicy mung masala.

Servers still needed a little nudge before they remembered to explain each uttapam that came in the \"South Indian Moons\" (chef's selection of 5), because god knows I can't deduce from plain sight, and the menu was taken away a long time ago. \n\nAND YES, YES, FINALLY THE FOOD... The food is self-described by website as \"Southern Indian\" with emphasis in dosas (like flat wheat-like crepes, lightly crisp, stuffed and rolled with a variety of fillings like paneer and spiced lentils) and uttapams (slightly thicker and smaller than dosas where ingredients are cooked right into the batter). These selections average $10 in price and come with a side of tomato chutney, coconut chutney (heavenly), and sambar (spicy liquidly lentil-flavored mixture). \n\nBasically if you're looking to drown yourself in thick curries, they have some on the menu, but the whole point is to expand beyond that and enjoy the adventure that ensues. Bring friends and order family-style, this food is best when passed around and shared. \n\nLooking back on our experience, we may have to change our pre-movie dining habits now... \n\nbecause this place is simply awesome.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-08", "description": "I get asked occasionally for Indian restaurant recommendations, but am no help. For one thing, I don't see how anything can possibility beat my mom's macher jhol and my mashi's moog dal; for another, most of the Indian places around here are heavy on the North Indian cuisine (tandoori, creamy sauced curries, etc), which I avoid if possible.\n\nMy first and best memory of South Indian food was in Visag; the RKM guesthouse food was simple, but so fresh and flavorful that I've never forgotten it. I've tried the Udupi Palace locations in Berkeley and SF, as well as the Dosa on Valencia, but nothing matched up; my hard-to-please dad and forgiving-mom both said the Dosa on Valencia was okay, but didn't come close to this little Calcutta hole-in-the-wall where they used to go on dates. Yeah, right, because being in love had nothing to do with their happy memories!\n\nAnyway, back to the review: I'll be glad to recommend Dosa on Fillmore to anyone who asks! The meal was consistently good; we liked every single dish and enjoyed all the different flavors.\n\nItems sampled:\nBengali gimlet cocktail\nBollywood hills cocktail\nLeek soup\nRasam\nSamosas\nEggplant dosa\nPaneer dosa\nMung dosa\nTamil veg curry\nPistachio gelato\n\nMy friend and I were unsure about the curry-flavored nectar in the gimlet, so the bartender let us have a taste. It was sweet and spicy and totally tasty, so I decided to get the gimlet. Actually, I started drinking my friend's bollywood hills cocktail by mistake, and then when I switched to the right drink, I couldn't really tell the difference. Most of that is due to inexperience -- I apparently can't differentiate between gin and vodka, hello -- but the overwhelming flavor I remember from both was lime juice. Which is delicious, particularly kaffir lime, but I wish the curried nectar was stronger in the gimlet.\n\nThe leek soup was creamy and delicious; the rasam was fiery and cleared up my friend's sinuses (I tasted it and was glad it wasn't too strong with the tamarind). The samosas were ehhh, good enough, but the two chutneys (tamarind and cilantro) were brilliant.\n\nAll the dosas were really tasty, although the eggplant seemed a little overwhelmed by potato. I enjoyed the presentation; the eggplant was a triangle, the paneer was shaped like eggrolls, and the mung was a traditional cylinder. Getting to eat with my hands and alternating with the tomato and the coconut (my personal favorite) chutneys ... so good.\n\nSince it was my birthday, I said yes to the pistachio gelato. I don't really like kulfi, because of the problem with ice crystals, but the creamy gelato texture and rich pistachio flavor? Utter bliss. I thought about getting the rice pudding, because of the birthday \"payesh\" tradition, but I'm so glad I went with the gelato. If I had to pick a favorite part of the meal, this would be it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the whole meal was generally very strong. I wish I saw the final bill (my friends hid it), but I think it was about $140 for 4 people (including 3 drinks, tax, tip). So this qualifies as a once-in-a-while treat. I'm glad for the owner's sake that Dosa is so popular; however, I'm thankful that we went on a low-key Monday evening and missed the suffocating bustle of the hip and trendy. Anyway, I'll definitely come back, and bring my parents too. I wonder what they'll make of the Bengali gimlet.", "author": "S R."}

The Valencia location is nice...kinda intimate and calming.  \n\nBut the Fillmore location is exactly what I would expect the owners wanted it to be:  trendy, hip, loud, kinetic. Whether this translates into yet another ephemeral dining establishment or not remains to be seen.\n\nThe drinks at Fillmore: most are downright bizarre inventions.  Warning: the coconut milk martini-thingy sounds good....but....let it be a lesson:  crushed hot chili peppers in a milky cocktail just don't go together.  Stick with the more in-the-pocket drinks.\n\nKudos to:  their Pimms Cup drink (of course, they have to all it something else because calling it a Pimms Cup isn't hip enuff....but that's exactly what it is).  I think they call it a Smoky something-or-other....\n\nMaybe the only place in SF which actually knows how to really make one of these  (besides 83 Proof)....\n\nThe staff:  nice, although I DO get a kick out of the fact that there is a traffic jam at the host station...and the jam being caused by the number of hosts/hostesses....not by awaiting customers.\n\nThe service:  depends.  YEOW, on a busy night (most are)....man...the kitchen goes seriously into \"the weeds\", as they say in the cheffin' biz.  \n\nAnd once they go there, they are there for the night.  Dishes getting served to the wrong tables....dishes never appearing...dishes served out-of-sequence.\n\nA note: the staff rushes you out.  I am guessing for a circus of this calibre, they need fast turnaround.  But if you are paying as much as you are for a meal here, and you have had to wait as friggin' long as you had to wait...you damn well deserve to sit at your table for as long as you like....and the management should well respect this.  Slow it down, folks...you make a killing either way.\n\nThe food:  yummy, but overpriced.  South Indian food is very different from what we all are used to....and it's quite good.  But, as for the authenticity of what Dosa serves...well....that's a bit dubious.  \nIt is, in my book, what much ethnic cuisine in SF is:  a dressed up, precious caricature of the authentic, real thing.  It's tasty, but gentrified; it's not quite the real thing. But worth trying nonetheless.\n\nThe architecture is cold and eccentric.  Nicest area to eat is the bar and bar tables or the loft.  DON'T allow yourself to get stuck at the long, bench-style table.  It's near enough to the door that a cold draft just hits it every time someone walks in  (you'd think for the $ they spent on the interior of the place, someone could have figured this out).  Also, nothing I like more than blowing $120 on a meal for two and having to sit \"family-style\" with a bunch of beautiful, buzzed, overdressed 20-something plastic people you don't know or have anything in common with (other than the fact that you ALL fell for the undrinkable coconut-milk-with-chilies cocktail for ten bucks)\n\nMake sure you get a real table.  Go once...if nothing else than for the experience.  But if what you wanna do is have a nice meal at a nice place, go to Valencia.  Although, just for the experience of the generally chaotic, crowded yet visually/bizarrely stimulating atmosphere of the place, it's probably worth one trip. I guess that's about the best thing I can say about the Fillmore location...other than the obvious fact that it has made the Valencia a much nicer, calmer place.", "author": "El K."}

This, along with the endless plate of pappadam, earned Dosa a fourth star.  I tried both the sweet lassi and chai tea, both of which were as good as I've had at my favorite Indian restaurants.  \n\nThe rest of it was enjoyable enough.  The dosa and uttapam selection is wider than usual (as can be expected given the restaurant's name), and there were some interesting unique entrees, but all of that seemed to cut into the selection of the dishes more traditionally found on South Indian menus so that I found myself forced to try things I wouldn't normally try, which worked out fine, but not memorable (i.e., duck spinach masala & paneer).  \n\nThe dosas and uttapams are good.

The food was, well, just okay.\n\nFrankly, the dumplings in the Idli Samba were so heavy I thought that there was a Jewish mother in the kitchen and I might be at Max's Opera Cafe.  The broth was a bit thick as well, and there were these twig things that were inedible and frankly a bit awkward to prod from my throat across a dinner table.\n\nThe Samosas were not light, they were heavy, and soggy.  The filling was more potato than anything else, and the sauces were unique.\n\nWhat made the experience nice was the ambiance and service.   \n\nI think that Dosa is less and less about food and more and more about being a social place to hang for cocktails, the food seems to be a lower priority these days from the reviews I have read in the past.\n\n5-stars for service, 5 stars for ambiance, but only a couple for Indian Cuisine.", "author": "Andrew G."}

We had to knock over (and I really do mean knock over) another server to get a bill and then have them pick the bill up. When we spoke to the management about our \"abandonment issues\", they basically started to give us excuses (\"oh we were really busy tonight\"), wrapped in apologies.

I had heard great things about Dosa and I came here for Dine About Town lunch and while I had a good experience here the food was only mediocre.

I chose the beet soup, my friend the chickpeas salad, and the boys the chicken dish which they all enjoyed. I'd say the beet soup was the highlight of my meal, it was a sweet pure of beet topped with creme fraiche, perfect. For my entree I ordered the restaurant namesake, a chutney-mint dosa. The dosa was bigger than the plate it was served on a filled with potato and mint, a soup and 2 dipping sauces accompanied the dish. I wasn't so impressed, but maybe it was because I was expecting something totally different.

On my three visits here, the food was uniformly delicious, and the drinks perfectly paired and great.  Pricy, especially for indian food?  you bet.  But on the merits of the food quality, I'd give it a 4 stars, maybe a bump more.\n\nService, on the other hand, is rather abysmal.  On all three occasions, the servers were inattentive in the first part of the service sequence, and then overly attentive when not necessary.  We waited extraordinarily long to be greeted by our server (and to be offered water and orders for another round of cocktails which had been drained by the time they sauntered by), who disappeared for long stretches during the time he should have been around to take orders.  On one occasion, the dining room was humming and I could imagine that either the server was stretched, or the kitchen asked to put a hold on orders, thus precipitating the deliberate slow-down...not so on the other occasions when a 1/2 full house provided no such excuses.  \n\nOrdering drinks is also a bit of a chore, as getting the attention of the server is challenging and it takes 8-12 minutes to get your cocktail thereafter.  Plan, therefore, accordingly, lest you lose your buzz between drinks.  \n\nAfter the deliberate inattentiveness in the beginning part of the evening, the sudden ubiquitous presence at the end seems a little out of place, even if you're desperate to turn a table.  You know, you could move along a table just as quickly if you front-load your speed of service and get them rolling faster up front rather than wait for the end.  It's just like it's wiser to start bailing out your boat if its got a hole in it rather than wait until the water is up to the gunwales just because presumably, it's easier then to bail the water over the side--that's just the fallacy of laziness.\n\nAt any rate, service here hovers around 2...not a jailable offence, but not by much.  \n\nLadies and Gentlement of Dosa, you do so well with the basic purveyance of food and wine, why not do us better on the service?

I heard it was going to be BIG, that it was designed with all energy-efficient and recycled materials, and that they would have new dishes and a FULL BAR. Even knowing this and that the owners Emily and Anjan wouldn't do anything unless they could do it well, I was awed by the results of their efforts at the new Dosa. \n\nI was first struck by the amber lighting, cast by different, beautiful chandeliers hanging at various heights from the tall ceiling. Take the time to absorb the powerful photography, made even more so for us as we learned that same day of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. \n\nAs enchanting as the decor is, I go to Dosa for the unequalled South Indian food, so I would have sat right on the floor of the old Goodwill at this location and enjoyed the coconut and red bell pepper soup, cauliflower dosa, and (I couldn't resist my old favorite) rich lamb curry and enjoyed it just as much. The new halibut dish was also perfectly spiced and will be on my must-order list. You will be pleased to know that the prices remain very reasonable. \n\nDon't miss the signature cocktails--the creamy, not-too-sweet Juhu Palm being my favorite so far. You can't get fresher ingredients than these. Being winos, the hubba hubba hubs and I also had to try every new red and white on the list (and you wonder why you couldn't shake your hangover the next day, my green-eyed boy?), which were all stellar accompaniments to the food. The bar manager and wine connoisseur Jonny did a superb job! \n\nAll of the servers, reflective of Emily and Anjan themselves, are warm, gracious, and extremely knowledgeable. Our server was clearly honored and excited to be working there.

It blends an authentic South Indian flavor with a hip, metropolitan vibe.  Sure, the $5 dosas coming out of stainless steel platters in the South Bay are delish, but the $11 dosas at Dosa are just as good, and worth the upgraded price for the pleasant decor and ambiance.  A dosa, by the way, is like this big hulking savory crepe.  The crepe can be of different consistencies, and you can get an optional potato stuffing, which would make it a masala dosa (or masala rava dosa, masala paper dosa, etc. The paper one is the thin and crispy kind, which is my fave).\n\nThe Madras coffee is pretty awesome too.", "author": "Leena K."}

However, dragging my fat butt to the Mission is not high on my list of things to do.  Therefore, I was terribly excited when Dosa on Fillmore opened.  Especially since it is across from the Kabuki theater!  Dinner and a movie is my favorite thing to do.  Especially if the movie involves cocktails, as a movie at the Kabuki often does.\n\nI went to Dosa two times in one week.  I love the atmosphere here.  Very hip, without being too trendy.  The design is well suited to a number of activities.  There are booth tables, corner tables with chairs, and an upstairs balcony area, which could be conducive to a small party.  There is also a shared bar table, although I hate eating at shared bar tables, for those unafraid of communal dining.  It may be difficult to get a table here, so there is a bar with unique cocktails to order while you wait.  We were told that our table would be ten minutes, but sat at the bar for over an hour.  \n\nIs the food worth the wait?  Yes, as long as the cocktails are abundant.  They also have a nice beer and wine list that pairs nicely with the spicy food.\n\nThe first time I came here, my friend and I ordered a la carte and I left very satisfied.  For two gals with large appetites, we shared the beet soup, which was a warm beet puree with a lovely pinkish color.  I enjoyed the originality and the light flavor of this dish.  We also shared the Chennai chicken, recommended by our waiter.  It is fried, so if you like deep friend food, try it.  The mango shrimp was sweet and the shrimps were succulent!  I also enjoyed our choice of dosa, which was paneer and spinach.  Most of the dosas also come as an Uttapam option, which is a thicker version of a dosa.  The dosas also come with two dipping sauces and a soup that is very spicy.  They bring a carafe of water which helps with the spice.\n\nOn the second visit, my friend and I tried the tasting menu.  I probably wouldn't do that next time, because it is a bit expensive and the choices are a limited version of the a la carte menu.  As an appetizer, we shared a salad and Cochin calamari.  I like the calamari because it is not deep fried.  I enjoy sauteed Calamari.  We also shared two mini dosas which were delicious.  For our main course, we enjoyed the mango shrimp and the Kerala fish Moile, a light fluffy fish, both refreshing.  For dessert, we shared Gulab Jamoon, fried dough, and Kulfi, and Indian ice cream.  This meal was probably too filling for me.  I definitely recommend ordering single dishes, which seem to be more value for the recession minded.\n\nI will definitely be back here.  The food is flavorful and unique, nothing like it in San Francisco.  Atmosphere is great for a casual meal, or a date.  My friend and I conjectured that there must be an aphrodesiac in the food because there were several couples snuggling and kissing.  Go here if you want to seduce someone.", "author": "apple r."}

I have been to this place on several occasions with my family and have had the same mediocre service. Their food I feel like is to Americanized for the Indian tongue. As a Indian I expect having some tradition and love when eating my native cuisine. Dosa does a C- job on that. However I do find their Masala Dosa decent and their Mango Laasis top notch. I do appreciate the ambiance and hip urban feeling (due to the fact that it is located in a upcoming hip neighborhood). Another complaint I have is their prices. Overly expensive especially due to the small portions they serve. I would prefer to go to a small Indian restaurant where they give bigger portions and hotter food. Also the desserts are always cold and bland. I will only come back to this place when I have out of town guests dying for some Indian food.

Bf and I had snacked beforehand at the Sundance Kitchen (we were hungry and it was quick), so that may have contributed.  We decided to order the paneer and peas dosa and the chicken briyani.  \n\nPaneer and peas dosa - was recommended (along with the Marsala dosa) by our waitress.  It was good, and the sauces were good (the lentil soupy thing was tasty; but I didn't like the yellow sauce - wasn't sure what it was - b/c it had kind of a gritty texture).  Regardless, I think it could have been spiced up a bit and made more punchy.  The flavor was very mellow and lacked the pungent spices that I've come to expect from good indian food.\n\nChicken Briyani - it was a definite let-down.  Flavor was OK, but the rice was a little mushy, and I had an issue with everything being the same color and texture.  The chicken was cooked well (it was well braised...  Not all that hard to do).  It would have been really nice to add some cashews and golden raisins to add some contrast to the plate.  \n\nDosa's most redeeming qualities were definitely the drinks and the atmosphere.  The house cocktail menu is really exotic with tinctures that I've never even heard of before!  Very flavorful, although probably not very strong...  The decor is also very chic, comfortable, and pretty.  It's kinda fun that this place is hopping for dinner service even at 10pm.  I would go here again for a happy hour.\n\nAdmittedly, maybe bf and I ordered the wrong things when we went here.  OR, maybe I'm just not a fan of southern indian cusine?", "author": "Stephanie P."}

All of us are meat eaters but that channa bhatura rocked. \n\nWe also tried the mango prawns (very good) and mustard halibut (good but definitely not the best part of the meal).

I could seriously eat it every day of the week.\n\nMy main problem with Dosa was that the food was only \"eh,\" and we had been expecting \"POW!\" My friend and I each ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings, and then swapped everything back and forth. I didn't, you know, spit anything into my napkin. But I didn't want to fight his fingers back with my fork so that I could hoard something especially tasty for myself either. And several things I pushed aside after just a bite or two. (My friend, who is far less picky than me, was similarly underwhelmed.)\n\nMy picky issue comes back to the cilantro thing. The one item on the menu that I was dying to try was the pea/paneer dosa. I asked our server immediately if it had cilantro, or could be made without cilantro. I was told yes, and no. So I ordered a variety of other things -- many of which came out covered in cilantro, as if they had put extra cilantro on just for me. I was supremely annoyed that the server didn't warn me, especially after I had already asked for a dish to be made without it. How hard would it have been to say, \"I hate to break it to you, but our kitchen is very cilantro centric, and we can't customize dishes\"? At the very least I would have expected her to ask the kitchen to exclude the cilantro GARNISHES, which were obviously added right before the plates left the kitchen.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be headed back anytime soon.

We had to ask them to give us more rice and curry. Even after asking them for more food, it wasn't filling. The amount of food that we got felt like it was for 5 people instead of 15.

Despite being surrounded dozens of Japanese restaurants, it seems I always end up at Dosa. \n\nKeep in mind that \"South Indian\" is not quite the same Indian food you're probably used to...but don't worry, its qualities and root flavors are similar. \n\nI usually start with a soup (all 3 are great and each is very different), then move on to a normal entree. Vegetarians have great options in the dosas and uttapams, which are essentially Indian crepes if you've never eaten one. \n\nThe place is a little overpriced, but the beautiful space inside might make up for that. Some might find the dimly-lit swankiness to be cheesy and uncharacteristic of San Francisco, but I find the atmosphere very appealing. Beautiful space with high ceilings, great place for a date. \n\nThis is a slightly generous rating for an experience that is more like 3.5; the full bar -- something that seems less and less common these days -- pushed my rating to a 4.", "author": "Jordan D."}

So inviting that I decided to make a dinner reservation for my birthday. This place was already full by the time we arrived (bef. 7pm) last night.  It was nice that we were seated right away.\n\nThe food was interesting and tasty enough. The Paper Masala Dosa was the star of the night. Nice presentation and it was fun to customize each bite. Perfect dish for sharing. The calamari was tender and flavorful. The samosas were good, but only two per order. The lamb chop entree was just so so.  We were told that there would be 4 chops, but only got three.  Didn't care for the flavor nor texture. Not as tender and forgettable. Too bad, it was the priciest dish we ordered. Had a little bite of the halibut and it was spiced nicely. The rice that came with the entrees were on the dry side. We also ordered the puffy bread which was good, but prefer Vik's version. Here it came out deflated vs. the fully puffed-out, steam-coming-out-of- the-seams we've gotten used to. \n\nThe cocktails were great and service was okay. Somehow once you're inside the ambience was nice, but not as special as it looked from the outside. Overall it was good, but would probably return just for cocktails and the Paper Masala Dosa before a movie. It was a solid night out, but not spectacular.", "author": "Jane F."}

One of my friends had been to the Mission location before, which he said is much smaller and significantly less hipster.  There is dim lighting, a huge bar, glitzy decor, and rather than the usual bhangra or Bollywood music I'm accustomed to at the standard tiny family-run Indian joint, the song that greeted us as we walked in the door was One Republic's \"Apologize.\"  LOL?\n\nThere were also A LOT of people there for 8:15 pm on a Tuesday night.  We were really glad we had made a reservation!  \n\nI had never had south Indian food in a restaurant before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  We tried the poori (puffy vegan breads) and fire broth as appetizers; I really liked the tomato and lentil-based fire broth.  It has a smoky taste and definite kick to it from the black pepper.  For entrees, we shared the Tamil lamb curry, which was awesome with lemon rice, the duck spinach masala and paneer with plain rice, and the chutney masala dosa (Indian crepe filled with potatoes, onions, and baby eggplant chutney).  I'd say my favorite was the dosa, though the lamb was really tender as well.  Every dish had an amazing blend of spices in it.\n\nI had the Batsman cocktail, which consists of gin, Darjeeling tea cordial, lemon juice, ginger beer, and mint.  Kind of like a South Asian spin on a mojito.  It was delicious and a very refreshing counterpart to the food, which is on the heavier side.\n\nPretty good service overall.

Most of the menu items are chock full of onions and they patiently walked us through the menu to find something that would work, they even sent a sample of something up from the kitchen to see if she liked it. How's that for service! \n\nI've travelled to Southern India twice in the last three years and it's my favorite region of India, the food being one of the reasons why.

The food pops with fresh spicy and exotic flavors, and the urban hip feel mixed with the rock-throw distance of the Sundance Kabuki makes for a very enjoyable evening, maybe with that main squeeze you've been hovering around? \n\nI decided firmly that Indian deserves Indian aspirations and so I decided to go redhot that day. Best mistake of my life(next to my fiance that is ~ I kid I love you very much!). I chose the Habenero and Mango Dosa, which if you know your peppers was sweet, sundered , then a fight for the glass of water.  The meal came with the dosa, which I was completely foreign too (being the plushed San Franciscan that I am).\n \nI was all too well familiar with Naan, chutney, and other yummies of the Indian landscape, but this was a marvel of taste and construction for me. A crepe with the mindset of Indian food? My God. Tasty, simple, exquisite, and filling are the words that come to mind. \n\nEnough of the food, Fine dining isn't just about the food alone of course; dining is also about atmosphere and ambiance! \n\nThe waiters/waitresses were all too helpful and gorgeous I might add, they were incredibly friendly, informative(on the dishes that is!), and all but most important when I dine is that the wait staff was patient for myself and my spouse. For we were t3h noobs of eating at a place that was unnamed for the beginning of its life span(Did anyone else notice that?)\n\nThe inside decor was minimal, nothing special, but I'm sure it would be quite a sight at night(we went in the afternoon).  \n\nLocation is perfect, close to Japan Town, Kabuki theater, Vaness, Downtown(38 bus ride away!), the beautiful and hip Fillmore area, and of course my own bachelors pad for myself to watch you eat through the voluminous and stifling windows of Dosa!\n\nPrice is what'd you'd expect, a generous helping w/o alcohol(do they even serve it? Not sure) with appetizers and a generous lunch came out to 42-45ish, I dont recall.

So, when I stepped into this place, I was completely expecting myself to be ripped off and leaving the place with a dissatisfied palate. BUT I WAS SO WRONG! Everything from their menu, to the presentation of the food to the quality and taste of it was simply spectacular. Not only do they have the traditional varieties of South Indian Dosa, they also offer some delightful fusion hybrids. Their menu explains how dosas are to be eaten - not with a knife and fork, but with the hand, dipping each piece into the bowl of Sambhar.  Unlike many fancy restaurants in the city that 'claim' to be Indian, Dosa is the real deal! 12 dollars for a tasty dosa and a magnificent ambience - I'll take it any day! The only problem with this place is that it's always full, and you can't eat here unless you make an advance reservation or are prepared to wait for an hour or two.", "author": "Srivatsan S."}

So I was really happy to see that both this new Dosa and the one in the Mission now take reservations.  That completely changes the story.\n\nDosa on Fillmore is quite a different dining experience.  The place is huge, and the architecture and decor give it the odd ambiance of an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  But the South Indian food is still amazing.  Dosas, lassies, and Uttapams.... mmmm!  And some restaurant management guru must have come in and trained the staff because this place is being run extremely efficiently now!  We were in and out in less than 45 minutes, which was perfect to catch our film across the street at the Sundance Kabuki.

I had heard great things about it. I also heard that their drinks were amazing, and I love a good cocktail, so once again, I was really looking forward to the meal. Maybe it is because I had such high expectations for Dosa - but I wasn't really blown away. I've eaten a lot of Indian food, and Dosa is good, no doubt about that, but it isn't really great.\n\nFirst, I ordered a cocktail (I can't remember the name - sorry), but it was one of the ones that was spicy. I don't know why I thought I would like this, but I just don't like spicy cocktails. Especially when Indian food is spicy - then the spicy cocktail doesn't quench your thirst. To be honest, I didn't even finish my drink, and THAT is crazy for me. On top, my friend didn't like the drink either.\n\nFor dinner, my friend and I decided to split everything. For our appetizer, we ordered Chennai chicken and the scallops - and both were pretty good, the scallops were my favorite part of the meal, but I just love scallops. I would definitely recommend them! \n\nFor our main course, we ordered the prawn massala and the regular dosa. The prawn massala was good, but I'm still debating whether it was worth the price. Maybe I just don't like Dosas (then I guess it was a mistake going to a restaurant named after them), but I was unimpressed by the Dosa we ordered. Sure, it wasn't bad, but my goal of restauranting isn't to leave saying \"not bad\" - I should be in awe of their culinary skills. \n\nI would go back to Dosa, but I wouldn't actually have a Dosa. Their menu looks really good, so I would order to scallops again, and try a different main course.. and order a different drink. I'm not giving up yet.", "author": "Ashley H."}

My friend and I went to dinner and ordered off the sample menu - $39 for your choice of 4 dishes, or $59 with wine pairings - a great deal!\n\nWe started off the night with two cocktails, of which there was a large list to choose from. I ordered the Silver Fizz (because I love drinks with egg whites) and it was light and refreshing. My friend got the South Indian crab cake appetizer, and I ordered the chili shrimp. Both were delicious and flavorful and plated very elegantly. A waitress (not ours) brought our first wine pairing and set it down on the table and walked away, until I stopped her to ask what the wines were. She said mine was a Torrontes, and wasn't sure what my friend's was. She came back a minute later and told him it was a Riesling. We both thought this was kind of weird, considering we paid an extra $20 for wine pairings. \n\nFor our second course we shared a paneer & peas dosa and the uttapam, both served with the same three delicious dipping sauces - a spicy orange sauce, a coconut-yogurt sauce, and a thick lentil sauce that could also be finished like a small cup of soup. We mixed the orange and coconut sauce on top of the dosa and it was perfect! For this course I had a Miner Sangiovese and my friend had an Iron Horse Chardonnay - both went very well with the dishes!\n\nI had the Lamb kofta for my third course, which was spicy and savory! It was paired with lemon basmati rice and raita. I just mixed it all together and devoured it. My friend ordered the prawn masala and he asked for it extra spicy. Considering it was one of the most mild dishes on the menu, the cooks hard a hard time ramping up the spice, but he admitted he should have ordered something more spicy to begin with. I forget what wines we had with the third course (probably because I was immersed in my lamb dish).\n\nWe finished off the meal with some tangerine and coconut sorbet, which was the perfect pallet cleanser. \n\nSurprisingly, there aren't enough high-end Indian restaurants in San Francisco, and this is definitely one of the best!

The food was not at all good, the dosa and uttapam where drenched in oil and placed on an actual pancake and chile to cover the lack of taste and spice. The paratha was so greasy and oily  that that too tasted like paper. The rice and barayani was flavorless, cold and drench in oil, the fries and other appetizers where drenched in oil and layered with spice again to cover the lack of taste. Overall I agree those other yelpers that the food is over priced for food that lacks flavor. I have been to other south indian or other Indian places and honestly stick with the less ambiance places. I was fooled to read all the yelp reviews of how great the food was, but when you look around both on the reviews and in the resturant, the majority of the people are nothing but non-ethic people and a couple of asians.

No one seemed pretentious at all - perhaps some of the negative feedback along these lines from other Yelpers is being generated predominantly by the dreaded Thursday-Saturday nights? No excuse regardless, but again, I had no such experience.\n\nThe bar is also really beautiful here, and their signature cocktails are quite interesting.

We had to wait 30 minutes to get seated because we didnt make a reservation, so I would definitely make a reservation, even if it's a week night. We sat down and they gave us papadum to snack on. We were so hungry we demolished it. We ordered a Spicy Mung Dosa, Chili Uttapam, and a prawns masala with lemon rice. The dosa was perfectly crisp and the stuffing with potato was almost as good as my mom makes, ALMOST. :) I must say I don't usually love South Indian food, but the sambar chutneys and entrees were to die for. They serve their dishes with coconut and tomato chutneys and a cup of sambar which is a slightly sour spicy soup. The Chile uttapam comes with four different types of chilis. Including habaneors and birds eye chilis. If you can't handle spicy food I would not suggest ordering it. It was FIRE, even for me. Regardless of the pain from the heat, the uttapam was delicious and I finished it. The prawn masala was also really tasty. Definitely not very spicy and sort of creamy.

The trumpet mushroom uttapam was tasty. Greasy but tasty. Not exactly fitting for a restaurant of this sort of flash, but delectable nonetheless. The salmon curry dish was where everything went wrong. The dish, described as containing coconut milk (which tends to cool things down), was overpoweringly salty and acidic, as if it was made entirely of tomatoes boiled in vinegar. It was very hard to eat, never mind enjoy. We're chicken about complaining and simply hate food waste, so we swallowed the thing. Honestly, we just wanted to get out of there and get to our show. Around us, two service mistakes were made at the tables adjacent to us. No one looked happy.

As you chewed on it the flavor would completely change.\n-Samosas: Very traditional - we ordered it because my friend had never tried samosas before. They give you both a Northern India and Southern India samosa and it was fun to have them side by side to compare and discuss.\n-Paneer and Peas Dosa were highly recommended and we found it to be really delicious. For this one the paneer and peas were stuffed inside the dosa and we had three different sauces to try. Very good for the dosa novice =)\n-Kerala Fish Moilee: DELICIOUS. Also highly recommended and although it was the more expensive things on the menu we were lured by the thought of black cod. I would suggest that you give it a try! Not only is the fish amazing but the moilee (Kind of similar to curry? But totally different flavor and less texture) really enhanced the flavor. There is no way you can go wrong with black cod!!\n\nAll in all a great experience and with the two of us splitting we ended up with a bill of $29 each (tip included). Totally reasonable!

I did the special Valentine's Day four-couse tasting and my date ordered off normal menu.\n\nFor starters, I got the Butternut Squash Soup and my date got the Dahi Vada.  The Butternut Squash Soup was roasted and pur\u00e9ed w/brown sugar, cumin, and served with a cilantro coulis.  It was fantastic but almost a little too spicy -- the squash kind of got lost in the heat.  The Dahi Vada was amazing: lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind & mint, mildly spiced.  It was an incredibly well-balanced, beautifully-presented dish, and I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nFor our second course, we shared the Paneer & Peas, which consisted of a Dosa (a savory rice-lentil crepe) filled with spiced, grilled farmer's cheese, peas & cilantro.  This course was okay but nothing to write home about.  The best part of the dish were the three sauces they gave you to dip the Dosa into, but I could have passed on it.... minus 1 star for a not-so-fantastic dish.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Eggplant Kofta and Kate got the Channa Bhatura. The Eggplant Kofta was spiced and cooked to perfection -- one of the best meals I've had in SF.  It consisted of eggplant and potatoes shaped into delicate 'meatless' balls, in a rich eggplant sauce, and served with lemon rice.  The 'meatless' eggplant/potato balls literally melted in your mouth, and the rich eggplant sauce surrounding them was blissfully delicious.  Two thumbs up.  The Channa Bhatura was also good -- a chickpea masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread -- but the Eggplant Kafta was definitely our favorite of the two.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Passion Fruit Custard with Coconut Tapioca... but to be honest, we were so full from our meal that we got it to go :)   Oh, and I almost forgot... If you're looking for something to wash the food down with, I recommend Maharaja --- an Indian Pilsner, light style with hoppy & oaky flavors from Navi Mumbai, India.  Most light beers are also a bit too light on flavor for my liking, but this one managed to be light, refreshing, really flavorful, and a good way to balance the spicy dishes.  \n\nAll in all we had a great experience at this place.", "author": "Shawn R."}

The Masala dosa, bhatura, and vada sambar are things I've been craving since going. Prices are fair and not as high as you'd think judging from the looks of the place.\n\nThe \"Eh\": Like many reviewers have already said, even with a reservation, there will still be a wait, and some of the servers lack knowledge of their own menu (this was a lunch experience). Not traditional fare in any way. When was the last time you saw an egg section on the menu at Naan 'N Curry?\n\nThe Bad: Your food comes out fast and hot, but once your order is finished, don't expect to see your server unless you're good at catching fireflies (Sorry, Dosa, but I personally think it a failure when water glasses are left empty, especially if you're serving spicy food).

Very creative and yummy - although I'm personally not a fan of gin, which is the base for most of their specialty drinks.\n\nDespite the crowd, we were seated on time, if not a few minutes early! We were seated upstairs, so we had a great view of the place - really added to the experience! The light fixtures are beautiful, and the overall atmosphere is fairly right on.\n\nThe five of us agreed to do the 4-course tasting with wine, and the food was truly delicious. We actually loved the \"crack chicken\" (aka channai chicken) so much as starters that we ordered another round for the table to share! So 2 orders from the tasting menu, *and* an additional one! Yowza.\n\nThe rest of the food was quite good, but the desserts were disappointing. I understand it's a different kind of sweet, so perhaps that wasn't the fault of the kitchen but more a question of incompatible palates.\n\nEven more disappointing, though, were the wine pairings! Perhaps they should rethink what they're offering: maybe just do white wines/cocktail or beer pairings instead? None of the wines I had was particularly complementary to the food; they might have been fine on their own, but the point of a pairing is to bring out the flavors of both - right?\n\nI'll definitely try again, but probably forgo the tasting menu - and certainly the wine pairings and dessert!\n\nOh, and the meal ended up being a little more expensive than I expected, especially considering the wine/dessert situations.

The restaurant space is large and industrial, with massive windows that reach to the ceilings and an impressive-looking bar area. It was hard to miss this large, imposing restaurant on the corner of Fillmore and Post. Yet once I sat down, the overall feeling was one that was inviting, because of the balance of the contemporary and traditional feel of the decor, accentuated by a nice gold mezzanine area.\n\nI sat down to meet my friend, who was already enjoying a thick Mango Lassi. We took a moment to peruse the regular lunch menu, especially chock full of salivation-inducing concoctions of veggies and spices, before asking for the \"Dine About Town\" menu. For $17.95 we had the choice of one of four starters and one of four entrees.\n\nWe chose the Red Beet Cumin Soup and Chennai Chicken to start and the Paneer Dosa and Mint Cilantro Masala Dosa as our main dishes. A delicately thin and lightly fried appetizer occupied us as we awaited our order.\n\nThe soup was exquisitely delish. Dollops of creme fraiche adorned the perfectly pureed beets. It was a perfect palate primer: light, warm, and soothing in my mouth. The Chennai Chicken had a tangy touch of spice. I usually do not opt for the salty, fried fare, but the accompanying yogurt dip complemented it very well.\n\nThis was my first time experiencing South Indian cuisine. The namesake dish, dosa, is popular in the region, and I was excited to try it as soon as I caught a glimpse of the numerous versions of it being delivered to the mostly 20s/30s patrons throughout the restaurant. Dosa is a rice and lentil crepe, filled with hearty goodness such as potatoes and other vegetables. The Paneer Dosa was stuffed with farmer's cheese, peas, and cilantro. It came plated in several individual rolls, ready to be devoured with your hands. The Mint Cilantro Dosa, with its soft, curried potatoes, had more warmth and kick. It was served flat on a large plate.\n\nBoth dosa dishes included on the side a cup of sambar (a lentil and vegetable stew with tamarind for dipping) and two servings of chutney: a slightly spicy tomato chutney and a fresh coconut chutney. The mixture of ingredients and textures was refreshing. Like the contemporary and traditional components of the ambiance, the different elements of the dosa and dips (sweet and spicy; crisp and soft) complemented each other in surprising and very pleasing ways.\n\nOur experience at Dosa was exceptional. The service was prompt, attentive, and non-pretentious. The pricing is reasonable for the quality of food received, although it is a bit of a splurge for those on a student budget. I recommend this place for anyone who has not yet experienced this South Indian specialty. It might even be a good consideration for a soon-to-be-scheduled romantic lunch or dinner...", "author": "Mads M."}

She recommended delicious cocktails and explained how the menu works and what was what (for first timers to Dosa like myself).  There were only two of us, but thankfully we were seated at a bigger table for four people.  This was good to accomodate the array of dishes we shared.  One of the apps comes as a slider, you can get 1 or 2.  If you're sharing apps, I would highly recommened not sharing this and getting 1 for yourself to enjoy.  My friend and I were both in agreement when we come back (bc we WILL be back) we would order a lot more of these and then maybe another app or smaller main course.  Basically the potato-like pancake thing that comes in slider form is amazeballs.  The special dipping sauces we recommened too but we felt were unecessary bc sauce comes with everything.

And I've always wanted to try their brunch, so it was perfect chance to go to the new location on fillmore. After weeks of nagging anyone who would listen, finally made it this morning.\n\nI'll get this out of the way - definitely prefer the mission location. Maybe it's my need for a little urban edge in my surroundings, this Dosa was just too, um, sterile. Massive, almost cavernous, I think you could fit three of the original inside. Didn't add to the ambiance at all. And the music was an odd mix of indian and pop. Odd.\n\nBut forget all that, because the food was awesome. To start, we split the fruit napolean, a sweet uttapam (thicker dosa) topped with fruit and and complemented by strawberry chutney and yogurt on the side. Delicious. For my main I had the egg poriyal dosa. Was initially bummed that 1) egg whites were not an option and 2) they couldn't take the chiles out (something about it being pre mixed), but I ended up being rather impressed. Not oily at all, and as the waiter promised, it wasn't really spicy. I got three filled dosas and some soup concoction on the side. For $10, it definitely felt worth it.\n\nFinal verdict - a mediocre ambiance (my opinion) with terrific food. If you are only going to do to one, I highly, highly recommend the original down in the mission, but food wise, you can't go wrong either way.", "author": "Jason B."}

But the food didn't impress me much...\n\nWe ordered the Masala Dosa - had never had one before, not even when I was in India! When the dosa arrived, there wasn't a lot of food on the plate. The curried potatoes were good and the flaky bread was fine but it looked as though they forgot to fill the plate with the rest of the food! I wanted more! Also had the Crab Vadas and again.. it didn't impress.. I've had much better crabcakes. \n\nI also had the Tamil Vegetable Curry which had a very off color - it was the color of gray brain matter... no joke! I thought to myself, \"Ok.... interesting color... maybe it's good... I'll give it a try.\" It was bland and there weren't enough vegetables for the amount of curry that was in it. I had to nibble off of Ryry's delicious Magalorian Prawn Masala to try to make my meal a complete one. Ryry's mom loved her Tamil Lamb Curry.

Go eat the dosa and the uttappams people!!\nJeez!\nAnywoo, onto my humble opinion about the place.\n\nI kept hearing Dosa this and Dosa that from a bunch of my friends and my husband and I thought to myself, \"Hmm, must go check this place out\".\nSo, I wheedled my husband into making reservations for the 2 of us, call it a date night, if you might! (Hey, that rhymed!)\nI hadn't expected it to be a fancy shmancy restaurant, honestly. I just thought it'd be like every other South Indian restaurant in the bay, ergo, small, shanty, packed with desis and the likes.\nTo my pleasant surprise, it IS this fancy shmancy place with a bar and a whole bunch of non-desis walking about! I felt under-dressed (All I wore was a top and a pair of jeans and flats!) :o)\nNow, my husband and I are both south Indians (we hail from the same city as the chefs!! :o) ) So when you say the menu has Dosa, we know what to expect and how it should taste.\nAnd I fell in love with it. Closest to home made dosa in taste that I have eaten in the Bay area. Their dosa and uttapam platter was just perfect and hit the right spot. However, my warning to those who are willing to experiment with Indian food outside the likes of Chicken Tikka, the dosas here are on the richer side, ergo, ooze with love (read butter/oil). Which is not the usual case. But hey, I am hooked! We ordered their Uttapam platter, which is basically tiny uttapams, the size of your palm with different garnishes, making each one taste a little different from the other. We also ordered their Chennai Chicken, which brought back memories from when an aunt of mine made it for me and I just went kookoo over it! Delicious!\nTheir sambhar was PERFECT. Not too watery (like most places here make it) and not too thick either. We had their tomato pepper rasam, called the Rasam \"Fire Broth\" as an appetizer, and I think it could have used a little more boiling. \nTheir alcohol menu is a little off the hook. It's not your standard alcohol menu. It's the Dosa menu, so off the hook. I would suggest you give their  Peony a shot and also the Bollywood Hills. Splendid!! \nWe didn't have any dessert as we were stuffed from all the food we'd ordered and I instantly slipped into a food coma.\n\nTheir service was muy excellente. We were constantly asked how our food was, whether we were enjoying the experience etc etc etc without them sounding imposing or anything.\nIf I want good dosa, I know where to head.\nNow, if only they opened one in the East Bay.", "author": "Ranjani S."}

There were supposed to be cashews, but I didn't taste any...\n\nThird Course - Peppercorn Chicken: This was my favorite dish of the night.  The chicken was tender and fell off the bone (as described in the menu).  The lemon rice was tasty too.\n\nFourth Course - Gulab Jamoon: My least favorite course.

Warning: the drinks are strong, but since they are mixed so well you won't even notice. \n\nMoving right along, the food was the best that I have had in the city so far. I didn't know what to expect; therefore I asked the waiter plenty of questions and he was very helpful. I ended up with the spring dosa and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken and eggplant baingan bharta and his mom had lamb curry and they both agreed that their dish was great, but the spring dosa was the winning dish of the night. We also had the onion pekora and the chennai chicken for an appetizer and they were both very good and the right size for an appetizer; not to small, not to big. We finished our meal off with the toasted coconut and saffron barfi dessert. Despite the weird and slightly disgusting name the toasted barfi was very tasty! \n\nThe service was the best in any restaurant so far. The seating hostess was great, the bartender was knowledgeable as well as the waiter. My boyfriend dropped his fork on the floor when he sat down and he didn't even have to ask for another fork. Within minutes one of the wait staff came over with a new fork and replaced the fork that had been dropped! The bussing staff removed plates and refilled water so smoothly and efficiently that you would hardly notice what they were doing. They were great at their job. \n\nLastly, the atmosphere was very nice. It was dark, but not too dark. They had a nice selection of music that was at the right volume.

I must say, that the food at Dosa feels fresh and made from quality ingredients. I went on a random Monday night pretty late, so didn't have to wait, which probably greatly increased my enjoyment factor, but make a reservation and grab a drink at the bar if you have to wait. I probably would make your reservation a little before the time you usually reach starvation status because nothing makes me crankier than waiting once I am hungry even if the environment is cool and the drinks are good. \n\nI will definitely be coming back, and I think this place will do good things for the surrounding area, which makes me enjoy it even more.

Dosa is large, bright, modern in every sense.  The food is nice although not to my taste.  I especially liked a salad of mung sprouts that was filled with lentils: nice, clean and light.  How they get the dosas so thin I would not venture to say, but these are interesting. A fruit Uttapam was a favorite for the child at the table and the adults liked it as well.   \n\nIf you have a youngster arrive when the place opens and you can get in and out for brunch on the weekend before the place fills.  Now that's an option that many will find attractive.", "author": "David D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-07", "description": "At first glance, this upscale rendition of its Mission District ancestor seems to cater to the chichi Pac-Heights/Marina white folks (I'm one of them, so I can say that!) who wouldn't venture down into the more \"vibrant\" parts of town for good eats.  Thus, for our group of four (who have all been to the Mission Dosa multiple times) the expectations were cautious.\n\nIn spite of the gorgeous decor and well-dressed clientele, this new Dosa continues to deliver the goods of its edgier Mission cousin: Tasty and innovative South Indian food with subtle California twists.\n\nThe Bhel Poori appetizer was excellent, as was the Cochin Calamari.  I had the Habanero-Mango Dosa, which had just enough fire to scare away spiceophobes, but not so much that it was uncomfortable (being a spice lover, my tolerance is above average). My wife had the Onion Rava dosa which was delicious and large enough to share the leftovers for lunch the next day. \n\nThe mango lassis and non-alcoholic German beer were also excellent.\n\nThe desserts were quite good: Gulab Jamun served warm the way we like it, and although I'm not a Rasmalai fan, the three other diners (all of South Asian heritage) raved about it being \"absolutely the best in the city.\" \n\nNot lost in all of this was the excellent service.  We were visited by no fewer than four different staff members who ensured that our food was fresh, finished plates were removed, and glasses were full.  \n\nThe only drawback was that, in spite of having made OpenTable reservations days in advance (don't even try to get in without them), we were seated at a small table near the bar, which did not seem to have the same amount of space as the 4-tops in the main dining area.  Thus, even with only three appetizers on the table, it was exceedingly crowded and took some maneuvering just to pass dishes without knocking anything off the table.  \n\nDosa would do itself a service if it replaced these smaller tables with dinner tables.  Next time, I will request a full-size table.\n\nAnother improvement would be the music selection, which seemed schizophrenic and distracting.  Dosa should really infuse more contemporary/modern South Asian music and less Billboard Top 40.  The visual atmosphere is far too pleasing for such audio dissonance. Between the loud bar area and even louder music, be prepared to speak up in order to hold any type of conversation with your dinnermates.\n\nNevertheless, we foresee this becoming our neighborhood haunt (it's about time this neighborhood got some palatable South Asian food!), and suggest that you check it out immediately.  There's also a small, upper-level room which looks perfect for cocktail parties.\n\nMake a reservation, insist on a full-size table, and enjoy!", "author": "Sharand N."}

The dosa and the uttapam came out first and they were both delicious.  The sauces that came out with each dish was such a great compliment to the dosa and the uttapam.  You can definitely taste the quality of the food.  It sure ain't no Naan N Curry!  By the time the Chicken Korma came out (which honestly was a long time after the first two), we were pretty full.  The Korma was ordinary but nice to try.  Next time, I'll stick with just the dosa and uttapam.  \n\nOur whole meal was about $80 but it wouldn't have been too bad if we didn't order the vino.

Luckily for my husband and I though, we were able to get in at 10pm. I tend not to dine this late, but since the movie theater was one block away we managed to grab a movie and make it in good time for dinner. So anyhoo.... the dosa's were phenomenal! They had every variety you could think of and the accompanying dips and the poppadoms were divine! We of course ordered the most expensive stuff on the menu - the vindaloo duck, the lamb curry and one of their stuffed dosa's - of which I forget the name. Everything was delicious, expecially the lamb. Would definately go back, particularly as this is a great place to dine with friends and family or on birthdays.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, partly because it looks gorgeous from the outside, and I'd rubber-neck this place every time I passed it while riding the 22.  Upon entering, the decor blew me away - the chandeliers, tall ceilings, long banquet tables, and dark decor told me I had entered Swanksville, and would be in for an elegant meal.  \n\nWe hadn't made a reservation, but the hostess told us we could wait for 20-30 minutes and grab a drink at the bar.  We obliged, and the wait turned out to be only about 20 minutes.  While we waited, we sipped on unique, exotically-spiced cocktails served up by a super-serious-about-his-job bartender.  It was really amusing to watch him mix a couple drinks - he does NOT play around and used very exaggerated gestures as if he really was putting on a show...Tom Cruise circa 1988 release of 'Cocktail' - eat your heart out!\n\nAfter the bar entertainment, we were seated at the end of the banquet table in the main room.  Our waitress was really helpful and recommended some items on the menu.  We ended up getting the four-course tasting menu, at $39 a pop.  Among other things, we had spicy lamb, spicy pepper chicken, and delicious dosas.  If anything, you cannot leave here without tasting the dosas (an Indian crepe) along with the scrumptious dipping sauces.  One thing to note is that our waitress was really upset when we were accidentally served a spicy prawn entree that we hadn't ordered, and she made sure that we were comped for that dish...so the bf got lucky and ate 5 courses!\n\nThe desserts I could have lived without, but I give them points for originality - we had fried donut balls in a syrupy sauce and a very interesting kaffir \"ice cream\" [quotations used because the consistency was not that of typical ice cream - it was super frozen].\n\nAll in all, the experience was unique, and even though I'm by no means an expert on Southern Indian cuisine, I can tell when a meal is fresh and delicious, and Dosa's certainly was!  *Caveat: will have to limit my trips here to special occasions only because the total tab (including two drinks each) came out to over $150 for two, so the lack of the fifth star is due to the fact that it wasn't the most reasonably priced meal...", "author": "Kira K."}

We started with a stout from North Coast Brewing Co. & a mint lemonade, & ordered three small plates plus an entree. The small plates were incredible--Fish Pakora (crisp, fried, sustainable fish with two delicious, not overly spicy sauces); Grilled Calamari (in a light cilantro-chile-cumin-chile-onion-lime sauce); and the vegetarian \"sliders\" (Vada Pav)--spicy potato patties served with ghee (clarified butter) & \"gunpowder.\" Effin ay--beware of this \"gunpowder\"--you mix it in with the ghee, to taste. I mixed in too much, we spooned some ghee-gunpowder sauce onto our sliders, and our mouths were on fire. Ouch! (Nothing that a mango lassi can't cure.) Finally, we had our entree--the Masala Dosa.

Ohh I could not wait to try the fare out at this jaunt.  \nRegardless my boss and our guest are from S.India, was unlikely we were going for 'four course meals' and 'wine pairings'.  They do not drink and did not need menu's.\nThe namesake itself, 'Dosa's' are nice.  I had the 'Five Moons' which were five diff Uthapam's dished up with sambar, coconut and tomato chutney.  Discussion of idli's with our server was almost too endearing to educate him a bit..   The sambar oddly was very salty that eve and surely an 'oops' as that is not common.\nIn this lavishly decorated, almost packed and nice ambiance space on Fillmore.. my airline size Diet Coke that was served to me aside a glass of ice made me giggle a bit.   \nOverall it is a very nice place to unwind by yourself or with friends, that special someone.  Depending on who you are, only you would know if to bring your visiting parents.  They either are going to fall over converting the prices or go back home bragging their kid is soooo rich he/she spent blah blah dollars on DOSA!!!  \nWe will be back to try out everything else on the menu:)", "author": "Tee S."}

I had paneer and pea, my brother had roasted fennel and my bf went with the traditional potato and pea.  All three were really great.  For the uninitiated, think Indian crepe.  I especially loved the paneer and pea AND the roasted fennel.  Also all three come with dipping sauces and chutneys.  One curry based, one tomato chutney and one coconut chutney - all three excellent!\n\nThe night we were there they had a five course tasting menu available and everything was delicious.\n\nNext time I'm in San Francisco, I'm going back!", "author": "Heather G."}

Dark, romantic lighting, a towering chandelier, leather chairs - it totally sets the mood. Premium cocktails for $5 - I recommend the \"Mood Indigo\" which is a citrus-y type drink. The drinks are very strong - I threw that baby back and relaxed immediately. Silly giggling ensued.\n\nChennai Chicken is excellent - think Tandoori Chicken without the bone and a side of yogurt sauce. Even the slaw salad that accompanied it was good - there's a bevy of Indian spices mixed in - dare I say cumin and curry powder? Whatever it was, I will be ordering that again.\n\nMung Salad - it's mung beans (or lentils) sitting on top of a mixed baby greens salad. It was good, but unsatisfying. Not good for guys. :)\n\nCochin Calamari - delicious if you like spicy, curry / cumin spiced braised calamari. Soft and tender, moist and not at all chewy. Delicious, but if you have to choose between calamari and chicken, get the chicken.\n\nNow on to dinner - \n\nWe got the Channa Bhatura and the Masala Dosa. We would have ordered more, but we got carried away with the cocktails. The Channa Bhatura was GOOD. It's a soft flatbread served with a side of chickpeas in a tomato-y, curry-like sauce. Excellent!\n\nThe Masala Dosa was a dosa (ultra-thin pancake) filled with a potato/lentil filling with a side of 3 sauces. Very good as well.\n\nDosa's strength is their ability to get the flavor of the sauces and curry spot on. Just the right amount of spice, saltiness and sweetness rounding out each tastebud, hitting all the right notes. Dipping dosas quickly becomes addicting.", "author": "D N."}

Dosa, how I love thee, let me count the ways:\n\n1. Open til midnight\n\n2. Ambiance is dim and cozy with gorgeous chandeliers\n\n3. Soothing music at perfect volume, no need to shout to hear people talk\n\n4. Unusual and delicious drinks - with ingredients such as yogurt and spices such as cardomon\n\n5. Focus on organic, bio-dynamic and sustainable ingredients and products. \n\n6. Food is beyond delicious:\n\n    - Mungsprouts Salad - \"a scrumptious mixture of frreshly sprouted lentils, tomatoes, cucumbers, ginger, grated coconut, chiles & mustard seeds\", \n\n    - Peppercorn chicken - organic chicken, crushed peppercorns, ginger, spices, \n\n   -  Uttapams and Dosas to die for - so many different fillings and spices. \n\nPrices are high yet the portions are appropriately generous\n\n7. Servers are attentive yet not overbearing. No pressure/rush to move through meal\n\nAn interesting mix of 30-something types, some hanging out and eating and/or just drinking. The table to our left was a group of French women who kept skipping out to smoke their \"American Spirits\" while intermittently talking about people in the restaurant. On our right, the intensity of 2 men in the midst of a breakup added a touch of drama. \n\nAll in all, I am enamored with Dosa.", "author": "Maren P."}

Started off with the red beet cumin soup, which was creamy & delicious. Was a bit spicy, but it went well with the creme fraiche. Then got the chutney masala dosa & loved the different dips and sauces. This particular dosa, I believe, was larger than some of the other ones. had some potatoes and eggplant it in. Yum. It was surprisingly spicier than I expected for something served to the general public without fair warning. For me, it was the perfect level of spiciness, but I could see it being intolerable for some people. Then, I got the Tamil lamb curry. The lamb meat was super tasty and soft, yet chewy. Not tough at all. Just perfect. And I got the little indian doughnut in syrup, which was much better than I'm used to at the little greasy indian buffets. Topped it off with their chai tea, which was milkier than I expected, but I love milk, so, I loved it! \n\nI don't know how authentic the food here is; it's obviously a lot fancier and schmancier (not to mention pricier) than the average indian buffet grub that i'm used to. however, change is good sometimes. in fact, it's so fancy that i saw people taking pictures of the ceiling and wall decorations! of course, they looked asian and touristy, but still.", "author": "Verna L."}

The space is quite large and the lighting is beautiful with large chandeliers and large booths throughout the restaurant. I had a meal here with some friends on a Friday night. Between the Kabuki theater and Dosa, the area was very crowded. \n\nThe food was wonderful. The menu itself is a but overwhelming because there are several choices and many categories. Because I was with three other people we were able to order tons of food, which was great because I had the opportunity to taste everything. The favorite of the table was the dosa - duh. I am of the opinion that if a particular dish is in the name of the restaurant the you MUST order it. The dosa was large and filled with delicious curried potatoes. The dosa and all of our apps came with several dipping sauces. I also loved the spicy prawns, they were so red that they really did look angry - but boy were they tasty. My friend who does not like shrimp even tried one and she loved it too. \n\nThe curries are delicately flavored and many packed a punch at the end. The rice here is flavored and I much preferred the coconut rice to the lemon rice, but both were good. The samosas were good, but nothing too special (particularly considering the price). Good service and the food came out quickly, which was great since we were so hungry.", "author": "Dana H."}

They have the most interesting cocktails- I watched the bartender making them, it's truly an art.  A lot of their signature cocktails have gin in them, which I don't like, so I had one with vodka.  It was such an interesting flavor- like none other I've tasted.  I had a sip of my friend's gin drink (can't remember the name, but it was pink) and it was just lovely (and I don't even LIKE gin!).  \n\nWe started with a chile rubbed shrimp, which was really tasty.  We had to try a dosa, so we ordered the one with garlic.  Ok, I adore garlic, but I didn't see that this one is very, very spicy!  Way too spicy for my taste, so I only had 2 bites.  My bad.  Even with the yoghurt sauce... still to spicy.  We also ordered the chicken with rice, which was good.  Nothing to write home about, but still very good.  We finished with the mini donut pastry, which were sweet and a nice way to end a flavorful dinner.  \n\nThe service was excellent, they even put up with my high maintenance sister trying out several of the wines before choosing one (ughhhhh).", "author": "Sarah F."}

But when you walk in, initially, you immediately appreciate what's happening, from a design perspective.  It's well-lit, but moody and it's very warm feeling.\nWaitstaff was nice.  Polite, chatty and although I didn't get the impression that they were all that knowledgeable (we asked, specifically, about cocktails), they seemed to do their best.\nWe shared lots of plates - Dosa, Poori, Naan and I'm embarrassed to say that I don't remember exactly what I ordered for appetizers - it's been about a month since I was there. Food was good - we had an eggplant dosa that definitely was light on the eggplant and left you feeling a little confused about what you just paid for.  \nI've eaten my share of Indian food, spent weeks in India and I wouldn't say that this is truly authentic Indian food.  It's sort of Indian fashion-food.  It's tasty and it's gourmet, but it's by no means what  you have when you're in-country or even at a small neighborhood Indian spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-09", "description": "Do NOT have a large party or get together here!!!\n\nWe set up a birthday party here for my wife with 18 people.  Because of our party size, they required a pre-set menu and said the charge would be $45 dollars per person.  This was already a little steep to ask all our friends and family to pay, but we went for it.  The management assured us that there would be plenty of food.\n\nI had 2 main issues with this place.  One of them alone is enought to kill a resturant for me.  Combined, they are the kiss of death for any repeat business from me. \n1) Portions\n2) Price\n\nPortions - By now, I'm used to going to restaurants is SF and getting what I would call FuFu portions.  But this was just criminal.  When they brought our the Masala Shrimp, it was in a bowl slightly larger than a typical cereal bowl.  And it had only 8-9 modest sized shrimp.  They only placed two bowls on the entire table, meaning that each bowl was expected to feed 9 people.  If you were ordering this from any other restuarant and they brought this plate out to you, you would think it would be good to feed 2-3 people.  It was that small in portion.  Unfortunately, this was the common theme throughout the entire dinner.  And each and every time, we had to complain to the waiters that there wasn't enough food.  Do you know how irritating and repetitive that can be when all you are trying to do is throw a fun party for you wife?!   I was surprised in that they actually did bring more food.  Unfortunately, when they would bring more out, it was even less than the first bowl they brought! \n\nPrice - Again, we had been given a quote for 18 people at $45 per person.  Now, the food portion of what we got was probably worth $15-20 per person (even factoring in SF pricing).  It would be assumed the rest was for service charges and restaurant profit. But no....at the end of the night they tacked on an extra $200 for service charges and $40 for the SF health charge.  I have NEVER gotten a \"per-person\" party quoting that did not include these charges already into the pricing.  Did I specifically ask? No.  But again, I have NEVER had anyone even atttempt to do this.  When you are getting a \"party quote\", it includes these types of charges.  That is the industry norm.  I know...I worked in restaurants for 6 years including a place that would host parties all the time.   This brought the price up to $60 per person.  Remember, I was already worried about the $45.    I personally felt especially shafted because I decided to pick up the nearly $200 in drink charges just so that all our friends wouldn't freak out any more than they already were.  \n\nSo if I disliked it so much, why the 2 star? What food they served was actually very good tasting. The Dosas were probably my favorite thing, which is appropriate given their name. The Masala Shrimp that was pretty good.  Also, my wife's cousin, who recommended the place, told me that eating there for a normal (non-party) meal is actually much better.  So for that, I am trying to be fair and give them a second star.", "author": "James L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-04", "description": "I had been to the original Dosa once before (including the hour plus wait outside) and had adored the experience. During that trip, we waited double our quoted time, but were given papadam on the street by the hostess to tide us over and a free appetizer for our patience. Not to mention, the food was wonderful.\n\nThis new Dosa is a block from my house, and since I adore Indian food, this seems like a dream come true. Knowing this was opening week, my boyfriend and I headed down around 6:45 on a Wednesday for dinner. \n\nWalking into the restaurant, I definitely was wowed by the decor. The place was spacious and lovely. Very trendy, reminding me of New York, but not pretentiously so. I approved. I asked the hostess for a table for two and she told me that there was a wait, around 20-30 minutes, and told me to have a seat. \n\nI didn't mean to be rude, but I gave a shocked look around the restaurant, which was less than half full. I didn't ask why, on opening week just before 7 they were making people wait when they had a ton of open tables, even though it was clear that every person who walked in after me wondered the same thing. I did have to wait the full 30 minutes for a table, and for this fact alone I almost gave the restaurant 3 stars. I have no idea why they kept so many 2-tops open for 20 minutes and made everyone mill at the bar, other than to sell a couple cocktails and give the strange illusion of being busy when they clearly were not. \n\nI figure coming here on the weekend will always entail at least an hour wait, but that's how the last Dosa was, so come prepared to stand at the bar and sip a drink.\n\nWe ordered two cocktails at the bar, and they were nice. I can't say great, but interesting. Mine was spicy and full of mango, and I didn't really fancy it (the spiciness got old faster than I would have guessed) but that might just be because it was so different from what I usually drink. I also didn't think the drink was very alcoholic, which was a bit of a shame, given the price, but that also happens at restaurants. I would not recommend coming to this place planning on getting buzzed on two martinis. It might not happen. \n\nWhen we sat, service was very slow in the beginning. It took at least seven minutes for the waitress to come to us, but she was nice, took our orders, and the dishes were served promptly and were well-spaced. We got Samosas, a Masala Dosa, and the Duck Curry. All of these dishes were drop dead amazing, and it was more than enough food for two hungry people. And while we thought the end price would be expensive, the meal was around $40 all told (not counting our drinks, those would be an extra $20) which to me is more than reasonable for the quality of food we got. \n\nI will definitely be coming back to Dosa. I would like to say a lot, but honestly, the wait might make this be more like a once-a-month trip instead of a once-a-week. However, all the food is top notch, interesting, and affordable, especially for the atmosphere and quality.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

Fiery fruit was an interesting mix of sweet and spicy for some simple items which was pretty unique and tasty.  The paneer/pea dosa was surprisingly large and really tasty, mixing somewhat mild cheeses with spicy and flavorful sauces and soups.   The chicken dish, was sadly, kind of a let-down, as it didn't stand out from any run of the mill Indian buffet place.  The gulap jamun was pretty great, even though it was twelve thousand degrees.      \n\nThe drinks were bad, though.  Every one of them.  After several, I just gave up and went to beer instead.

I also ordered the tomato soup which was quite tasty. The dosa, when I cut into it, was a bright fiery red (think spicy cheetos) and stuffed with a potato filling.  If you're eating just the crepe part, smeared with red, with no potato, it's definitely pretty potent. My tongue was tingling and my eyes got a little watery after the first couple bites. Also, you can smell the damn spiciness off of the dosa itself.  However, once you get to the part of the dosa w/the potato stuffing, and you put some of the sauces and the chutney on top of the bite you're going to eat, the heat is extremely reduced. really good either way.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely like to come back here and try the other types of dosas they offer.

I heartily recommend the vegetarian sliders and lentil dumpling appetizers--they're as pretty as they are delicious.  Dosas are hearty and big and possibly an acquired taste.  A warning: I don't believe they've tempered their spices to american palettes, so when it says \"hot!\" it is for real hot.  I've gotten my wife to enjoy spicy fare over the years, and after bragging about her newfound temperament she ordered the roasted chili and garlic dosa.  She took 1 bite and could instantly see through time.  Had to send it back--even I wouldn't have finished it.  Consider it a challenge.", "author": "Ian S."}

Very well decorated; clean lines, and gorgeous chandeliers and light fixtures.\n\nFood:\nCrab Vada- Two crab cakes with the typical Indian cilantro and tamarind sauces on the plate in a yin-yang pattern.  Presentation was very nice.  However, the crabcakes, though had a great consistency and full of flavor, had very lttle crab flavor.  It felt like crab in one's mouth, but the crab taste was lost. Overall, there was nothing memorable with this dish; it simply lacked the \"wow\" factor that would make anyone carve for it or order it again.\n\nBlackened Sardines- Excellent mix of flavors.  Not blackened in the cajun \"burned\" sense, but that was for the better.  They were not fishy at all and had great consistency, not over or undercooked.  It came with a cucumber, red onion slaw which was actually quite spicy.  Overall, this dish is highly recomended.\n\nChennai Chicken-Strips of white meat with that red tandoori coating.  Unlike tandoori, these were fried, not grilled, but no coating or batter but it was not oily.  It was served with a yogurt sauce that had cumin and cucumber.  It was also accompanied with a slaw-type sala consisting of red cabbage, red onion, and carrots, shredded very thinly.  The slaw had a sweet dressing and sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  The dish has to be eaten with all components together; chicken, yogurt sauce, red onion slaw, otherwise, the chicken itself is quite salty.  Overall, this dish is an 8 out of 10.  Tasty.", "author": "Jon B."}

Yay for a super thick, super mango lassi (we got covetous questions from neighboring tables ;), and big yay for the Masala Dosa, although we ordered the eggplant version. Wow, it was a ghee infused crispy pancake (guilt) with buttery potato and onion fill. Heaven, accompanied by tiny ramekins filled with coconut and tomato chutneys, non spicy.

The mint sauce was very well done.\n\nAfter being overwhelmed by the menu, the waitress suggested we get a Dosa and an entree as the portions were perfect for two. I was hesitant as I have read the reviews about the portions, but rolled the dice. We decided on the Spring Dosa and the Peppercorn Chicken entree (with lemon rice). \n\nThe Spring Dosa was great! Perfect for two people. The Dosa had three rolls with dipping sauce and two chutneys. The Peppercorn Chicken was pretty good but I had some issues with cutting good pieces of chicken off. I kept getting bombed with chunks of peppers or herbs that were used to cook the dish. The sauce is very thick and it makes it hard to distinguish. The lemon rice was great! I'm not sure I'll order the Peppercorn Chicken again.\n\nOverall, it was a great place to dine and even on a Friday night, the service was impressive.

We had a late lunch so we agreed and took a seat.  At first, I was a little anxious.  I noticed the long bar height community tables - not a fan.  It was also quite loud.  I anticipated being seated at the community table and having to ask for a private table and possibly wait even longer.  \n\nTo my pleasant surprise, after only 20 minutes, the host welcomed us to a table and in my opinion, it was one of the best in the house.  It was in the bar section but in the back corner and it was seated for four - perfect for just the two of us.  The chairs were super comfy and we had a great view of an entire half of the restaurant, it was quieter and really just what I was looking for.\n\nOur waiter came by quickly, gave us some recommendations and we ordered.  We ordered a peppercorn chicken curry, lemon rice and a masala dosa.  The lemon rice was sour, and disgusting, so we quickly asked to change it to the coconut which was nutty and delicious - not too sweet.\n\nThe Dosa was excellent.  A slightly thick savory crepe with a potato filling and a trio of dipping sauces.  Along with the coconut rice, the meal was pretty good.  \n\nService was quick and attentive.\nThe restaurant was clean and well run.\nThe food was better than most Indian places and was served quickly.  \nOur requests were met with a smile - what more can you ask for.\n\nThe Check.  With all that food (we also ordered an extra bread), tax and health care premium added, our check only came out to $34.00 - very affordable!\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I don't  feel compelled to return often.  I think it would be a great place to take some friends, especially for a drink.  When I really want to have Indian food, and I want the best, only Roti will do.  While the service often stinks at Roti, and the atmosphere is way too loud and cramped, the bottom line is their food is incredible.\n\nI would recommend you to check out Dosa, I'd certainly go back and the Dosas would be at the top of my list for things to order.", "author": "Aaron B."}

We loved the atmosphere and the decor of the place.  It was highend and elegant. Great place for a group outing and/or a date, altho' it could get noise.\n\nBut the second time around, not so charming.  We were seated upstairs, which I didn't like as much as downstairs.  The waiter was decent at servicing us but pushed a little hard for us to order drinks.  I got the Chutney Dosa dish this time and it was a little disappointing compared to the solid curry dishes I was used to.  \n\nAs we came for a friend's birthday, a cake was brought in to celebrate the festivities.  The waiter told us there was a $3 charge per plate for cake cutting.

Had the chilli fry shrimps (kinda small only about 5 shrimp but tasty) and the Masala Chutney Dosa (AMAZING) for appetizers.\n\nFor mains we split the Kerala Fish Curry that was the best thing we had all night. It has an awesome pungent peanut sauce with coconut flavored rice on the side. We also had the Paneer Duck which was ok really spicy and tender duck but only about two legs and a boring side salad (will def try another main next time).\n\nThe desert was the Coconut Barfi which was kinda like an egg roll filled with coconut and kiwi and raspberry sauce on the side. It said caramel in the description which is why I ordered it couldn't taste any caramel.

After we got back from rock climbing we decided we wanted to go out to dinner, so automatically I started sifting through my yelp bookmarks to see what fit the bill. We decided on Dosa, and were originally going to try out the location on Valencia, but due to some last minute hookah plans, chose the Fillmore location for convenience. I went to opentable.com at 8PM and made reservations for 9:45 and sat around and waited patiently at home nursing my sore muscles. \n\nWe arrived right on time by sheer luck, and were seated right away despite the place being packed. First impressions were that of excitement, after briefly skimming their menu online and reading some other yelp reviews I could seriously not wait to get my grub on. We ordered the Dahi Vada and a Paneer and Peas Dosa as our appetizers and the Tamil Vegetable Curry and Channa Bhatura as our entrees. I choose to go with the wine pairing with the Curry which was a Malbec and fit complimented my food wonderfully. \n\nAs we waited for our food we laughed a little at the decor, most of which is nice but some seemed a little kitsch-y. Overall the impression was that they hadn't quite decided upon a decor they liked yet. We also spied on those around us' food. When a giant plain dosa came out we were all but ready to steal it before our own food showed up. Our appetizers were delicious, the Dahi Vada tasted exactly like some other food we eat, but neither of up could place the taste. Our entrees then arrived in  a very timely matter ( you definitely wont waste too much time here waiting around for food) and we were excited as ever to dig in.... except that both of us were already pretty full. \n\nI ordered the Coconut Rice with my curry which complemented the spices in ways I did not know were possible. I managed to eat half of mine before realizing that it was unwise to try to eat anymore. Thinking that if I got up and used the restroom I would have more room to eat, I discovered the really fucking awesome hand dryers in the bathroom. Now I normally the hand dryers, you stand there forever and your hands just never get dry. But this was a jet dryer and your hands were dry withing seconds.... very cool. \n\nWe ended up getting a doggie bag for the rest of your food, which will make a wonderful lunch for tomorrow. In hindsight, I think we should have only ordered one entree between the two of us, because if you want to eat appetizers a whole entree is just out of the question.

No problem and we ended up at the communal table which is a great place to see what everyone else is ordering and make friends - hey there Peace Corp and Napa.\nFirst the drinks, they make their own gin and their own tonic and together its a rather tasty gin and tonic.  The peony was also flavorful and rich (which you'd expect since it includes coconut milk.)  I also had a cocktail which was real heavy with ginger; a bit more than I'd want in a drink but I still drank it no problem.\nFood we had the bhel puri which had the right amount of heat, lots of different textures, puffed rice, thinly sliced beets, and lots of other stuff.  The cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney worked well with this dish.  The basil dosa is simply wonderful.  Dipping it into the soup, spooning on more chutneys make perfect bites, Actually didn't need the smashed potato that is in it.  Finally had the lamb tamil with lemon rice.

Online the place looked nice but that doesn't really mean much. My sister looks good online too. \n\nWhen I got there I was blown away by how much time and money they spent fixing up the place. Floor to ceiling windows and a new upstairs  and the decor and the lighting was just right. They didn't over do the Indian thing and the lighting wasn't as dim as a dark bar or as bright as a Denny's.\n\nFor those of you not in the know a dosa is an Indian dish, that is flatbread stuffed with things depending on what kind you order and depending on what kind you order it's either shaped like a slice of pizza a calzone, or a rectangle.\n\nYou eat it like Ethiopian food and tear the bread and dip it into this Indian gravy and then chutney or another kind of sauce. I found this too time consuming and was really hungry so I just dumped everything on top of mine and tore into it with a knife and fork.\n\nThey had the usual apps, samosa, pakoras, papadums etc. I also had this lentil dish covered with yogurt that was really good. I also recommend the chicory coffee. If you go there stick to the dosas and away from the main dished the dosas are a good value at about $10 each. The main dishes you can get a most Indian restaurants and the prices were a little on the high side. My only complaint was that the waitress forgot to bring out plates for the apps and it took a while to get them but other than that it was all good. This would be a good spot for a date and they have a full bar, the beer was a little pricey $6.50 for a Kingfisher, but you're there for the food and not to get drunk.  Definitely make a reservation as I went on a Sunday Night and the place was packed.", "author": "Steve Q."}

Everything on the menu was really tempting. We got whatever their version of crab cakes was - and that was ok. The paper masala was great and all the dipping sauces were very creative. I personally loved the coconut spread. We shared an entree of prawns in a rich red sauce. Everything was spiced perfectly and the portions were a very good size. \nBack to the paper masala. It was HUGE could easily split between 4 people. It was slightly greasy, very thin and I've never tasted anything like it. I probably won't order that again, next time we'll try the regular dosa. \nThe price was really good. We didn't have drinks so of course that helps keep the bill down but for both of us, we left pretty full the total was only around $40. We were expecting much more for the beautiful decor and swanky ambiance. Thx for the suggestion 7x7 - it's been a great find for us!", "author": "Audrey V."}

We ordered a starter (the calimari), a South Indian Entree (the lamb curry), and a dosa (the cheese and peas one) to share. This was what the waiter recommended we do. For two people this was a whole lot of food - we were both hungry walking in and yet ate only a little more than half of the food. Indian food tends to expand in your stomach and it seemed like we were more full an hour after dinner than we were when we left the restaurant.\n\nI'd be interested to learn more about the different between North Indian and South Indian. The waiter briefly explained that North Indian has more entree style dishes (I think that's what she said). And, I am more used to things like Indian curries and I love biryani. So, the lamb curry was excellent - a little spicy, but not too much. \n\nThe starter was also good - also a little spicy, but not too much. The dosa was really different than anything I had eaten before. It's like a cross between a crepe and a burrito. It came with two chutneys and a dipping sauce, two of which I enjoyed. \n\nBut, I didn't leave licking my fingers and immediately wanting to go back. Perhaps I just prefer North Indian food, but I would much rather get a $10 plate of lamb biryani at Pakwan than go to Dosa again. \n\nI will say that the atmosphere is really nice - especially the upstairs, which feels a little more intimate. The downstairs is much more open and spacious which kind of gives it a lounge-bar feel. So, it's nice to have both in one location.", "author": "Matt N."}

We dropped by at 8:30 pm on a Friday evening, and put our name on the list for a table.  The hostess said come back in an hour.  It was very crowded at 8:30, not so crowded when we returned at 9:30 pm.  We were given a wonderful corner table with a great view of the restaurant.  The whole interior space is wonderfully designed and gave us a lot to look at.  We were quite hungry at that point, and everything on the menu sounded great to us.  As vegans, we were gratified that the menu was very vegan-friendly, with hardly a mention of meat or dairy on the menu.  The waitress also was very receptive to our dietary considerations, and provided us with a supplement \"cheat sheet\" showing which menu items contained what.\n\nWe ordered the Mung Sprout Salad (excellent -- we are going to try and replicate this at home), the Samosas North and South (containing eggs and dairy), the Bagara Baingan baby eggplant Entree with coconut rice (pretty good -- I found the eggplant a little chewy), and the Spinach & Fennel Pooriyal Dosa (delicious).  Our waitress indicated the dosa are made with ghee (clarified butter), but they could make them without ghee if we truly wanted a completely vegan dish.  These four dishes were ample food for us, and we had enough left over to take home for a snack.  We had dark chocolate sorbet for dessert -- not on the menu, but possibly their only vegan dessert offering.  It consists of dark chocolate and sugar in a water base, with no milk whatsoever (dairy, soy, or coconut).  It was excellent, and could pass for chocolate gelato.  \n\nThe service was really outstanding -- friendly and attentive, with no pressure to order any more food or drink than we wanted or needed.  We found the prices quite reasonable -- most dishes are priced around $10 to $12.  Our total bill with tax (before tip) was $61 for a very nice dinner out.", "author": "Matt and Rita C."}

Extravagant decor and an elegance about the place. The food was solid, although combining curries makes your palatte all messed up. We got the shrimp masala and a chicken dish. At the restaurant, we thought the shrimp masala was way better, so all our chicken was left untouched. But as I ate the chicken leftovers the next day, I found that it was also pretty delicious.\n\nWe opted to get dishes and share, instead of their $40 pre-fixe menu.

We all got that bollywood something drink, the one where the description has the pickled mango in it...ok, well, i'm chinese and im a big fan of funky preserved fruits, but this drink was GROSS with a captial G!  my bff wanted the fried milk balls because she really liked it from this other place where she first tried them, but those were bad too....unless you like soggy and tooth achingly sweet stuff.  no thanks, not even for this sweet tooth.\n\nthe third time i went back for brunch.  i ordered the half dosa and soup thing and decided to try the mango habanero dosa thinking it can't possibly THAT spicy because i have a VERY high tolerance and love for spicy food.  i've met my match!  this thing was so spicy, i was sweating!  it was tasty, but not very sexy.  the soup was the coconut and roasted red pepper soup.  all i'm going to say about that is, i want to bathe in it! (my roommate's glad we don't have a tub.)\n\nfinally, i want to say the 3rd time was the charm.  it wasn't only because of the fiery delicious morsels in my mouth, but also because of the service.  mind you, i'm not speaking about my server, she wasn't really there, but the runner.  i dont know his name, but here's my shout-out for him...\n\nMr. runner man with the corn rows, you are awesome!  this man brought me the dosa and knew that no matter how tough of a cookie i am, that no one could eat this thing without sweating (a lot).  so he brought me a side of yogurt and came back later with a little plate of cucumbers and lemon.  just in time before my tongue melted off from the habenaros!  so, sir, thank you :)  **btw, whoever the OTHER waitress is in there with reddish hair who couldn't crack a smile to save her life and who \"pulled you aside\" to snap at you for \"talking to her table\", she can suck it!**  at least you were doing something she was supposed to do!", "author": "Sally T."}

Which location should do I start with?  First, I would like to disclose I was born in Kerala and grew up eating Dosa's for breakfast several times a week with my Dad's family.  And Dosa's are for breakfast and brunch:).\n\nDosa Fillmore has a nice atmosphere, but this is good as it added attention which diverts ones attention from the non-authentic and awful food they serve.  I was disappointed and embarrassed as a Keralite/Malayalee of what Dosa has concocted to present the general public and taking non-Indo consumers lack of knowledge in what true South Indian cuisine is all about, especially Dosas.\n\nWalking into Dosa Fillmore, one obtains a good look at the high ceiling tall glass windowed atmosphere filled with sunlight.  The atmosphere is very nice as anyone would say.  We sat down and my friend chose the Masala dosa, and I chose the fusion dosa dish version which was eggs, veggies, and cheese.  Well, I'm not sure which Dosa dish I received as the waitress brought out the wrong order, I didn't complain as I was slightly disappointed with the chai I was drinking.  Long story short, both dishes were not great, especially mine as it tasted horrible.  After effects was that my friend ended up being sick from the food for several days, and I became immediately sick right afterwards.  I am not sure what took place that day with our dishes, but certainly both of us getting sick is not random.  Sign their kitchen processes or methodologies are not up to par or they simply use cheap ingredients.\n\nWhen went to Dosa Valencia, the dishes were far from authentic.  One of  the dishes I ordered was Kochi Calamari, the dish came out all gooey and tasted no where never a dish from Kochi, Kerala.  The place super loud and could hardly hear my friend, not mention asking her several times her eggplant dish was, when I could tell she was not enjoying it.  Wouldn't recommend this location either.\n\nIf you want true authentic south Indian cuisine, try other places.  From a South Indian born cat, and having had Dosa's all over Kerala and the east coast, Dosa is not the place to experience having your 1st or certainly not your last Dosa.  They have good branding that's it, don't be fooled.  Branding good, product(s) not good.", "author": "Indo N."}

In the Valencia Dosa wars, i was planted firmly in the corner of Uddippi Palace. Dosa was the roger federer to the nadal of Udippi Palace. I scoffed at the elegant effete charms of the former, and argued firmly for the less pretentious charms of the latter. The hipsters flocking to Dosa certainly didn't help (Dear straw target hipster: you may know your arcade fire, but you don't know jack about south indian food, so please don't pretend you do -- I GREW UP EATING these before your kind thought multiculturalism was cool.)\nBut one fateful night after a late  film in Filmore, I gave in, comforted by the knowledge that none of my family knew of my treacherous venture into enemy territory. Verdict: Best Masala Dosa I have eaten in this country, and would rival anything I would eat back home (i.e. Bombay -- and no, please don't \"correct\" me or show off that you know it's \"Mumbai now). My family might disown me if they knew I was writing this, but I would say it's better than the Vik's dosa. The dosa texture is both soft and crispy and I can almost swear they use Amul butter for further authenticity. The sambhar is spicy, and I can taste the curry leaf flavor, which is SO important to me.\nI can't bring myself to try the fusion stuff -- so no white truffle dosa or sunchoke filling dosa for me, thank you very much. I'm too much of a traditionalist when it comes to south Indian food. \nAnother stand out dish are the idli fries (which aren't at the Valencia location) -- again, great chutneys, and the crispy fried curry leaves fill my heart with ecstasy but also an aching nostalgia for home.", "author": "Crushed Wi Cardamom C."}

The last time I ate here I brought my parents who were visiting the city.  They both had a great time and loved the food.  The only thing I had been disappointed with was the level of spiciness in their \"spicier\" dishes.  I requested a serving of the chili chutney, which is usually just layered in the dosa, this was the key to getting that burn I love.  I did not deduct any stars for the spicy level as I think this is just a matter of tolerance.

An excellent service and staff!\nTwo minor negative points: 1) a bit disappointed by their rum cocktails (ginger ante: too bitter so not really emphasizing the quality of the rum according to me and caipirhina: not that great ), however the wine was good. 2) the ceiling should be decorated to hide its white and impersonal color which works again its warm ambiance given by the deco, maybe some both dark red and orange curtains....", "author": "Guillaume C."}

Plus, # 64 on 7x7's 2010 SF Big Eat List: Paper masala dosa was served here. The presentation of the paper dosa was amazing itself- in a shape of long, hollow log of wood- it took our breaths away.  It was lightly crispy on the outside but soft inside so you can fold and dip it into the coconut & tomato chutneys and sambar.  It was definitely a hands-on kinda dish. It was enough to share, and I recommend ordering a side of meat dish to go with the dosa as eating the dosa alone can feel a little redundant.  The Chennai boneless chicken starter was marinated in Straus organic yogurt.  The warm and cold sensation was a good combination.  We also shared the Paneer & Peas Uttapam which reminded me of a big, round egg omelet with shredded farmer's cheese, peas and cilantro. We came when they were promoting the Yelp special where certain drinks were only $5!\n\nSave room for dessert or tea.  Our dessert wasn't the best- you can forgo the Gulab Jamoon, which consisted of two fried dough balls literally drenched in sugar syrup with cardamom flavoring.  It was too sweet for me.  However, our friends got the Banana Cream Pie and it looked indulgent.  Loved the authentic chai tea that comes unsweetened but definitely had a strong cardamom flavor. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed dinner here-- nice intimate atmosphere but don't worry about getting dressed up because I observed people on the casual side in larger parties and even families with children.

Hmm, either I just went there on a really off night, or this ethnic restau is suffering from the \"PF Chang's Effect\".  Which is... trendy/appeasing ambiance and mediocre food then touted by patrons as \"the best or awesome\". \n\nThe cocktails were pretty good, I had the Lesson Park and was reminded of the rattlesnake at Beretta. If you're in the mood for a bold cocktail, this is the way to go. Unfortunately, the food was unremarkable, we sampled six or seven dishes. Two of which that were quite good: the chicken appetizer with yogurt sauce and the banana cream pie. The Spicy Sweet Scallops were overcooked, but did have good flavor. Everything else, I feel I could have gotten from a \"mom and pop\" Indian Restaurant. \n\nWhere Dosa really falls apart is service. They (Dosa) set an expectation eg. assumption of great service and wait staff based upon ambiance, decor, staff size, reputation, etc. So... when you walk in and your reservation was scheduled at 7:35 and you don't get seated until 8:10, they don't live up to the hype they've established. This hype is further degraded while you're standing at the bar and every member of our party (there were four of us) gets run into by wait staff and subsequently have drinks spilled and only 50% of the time are apologized to. Finally, you get seated... order... then a food runner brings you food that you didn't order, adding insult to injury, our waitress not only informs us that we didn't order it (we knew this), she also mentions that the dish isn't what it's supposed to be and that it's incomplete. What if we did order it? I seriously doubt she would have let us know.  Then a couple of fundamental serving errors like, if you're serving a 12oz beer in a glass that's larger than 12oz, show me the bottle and pour THE ENTIRE BEER IN THE GLASS, or hand me the bottle. Don't leave me with 1/5 of the beer in the bottle, which means you don't get the standard half inch of foam or head out of your beer, and you lose table space. Lastly, DON'T SPILL WATER ALL OVER THE DAMN TABLE. That's nice that you're helping us pour water, only you just spilled on someone's phone... and after your \"oh, sorry\", show absolutely no sense of urgency to wipe up the mess. \n\nBottom line, if you want Indian that'll knock you on your ass.

In particular the second offers a good overview of the Uttapam \"concept\" and I highly recommend it to novices. The accompanying tomato based chutney and the spicy sambar, a flavorful lentil dipping soup made with vegetables (carrots, zucchini, etc.) are absolutely fabulous. The coconut-based chutney, on the other hand, tastes kind of weird, at least for me, but is somehow interesting.

It could easily serve for a nice evening out, but still retains enough laid-back ambiance that I didn't feel out of place with casual attire.\n\nI had never tried dosa before, and the server was really helpful in sort of explaining how it's made and how it is to be properly eaten.  \n\nBased upon her explanation, I wasn't really that excited, but was definitely curious.  And then it arrived... I ordered the Chile & Cilantro Uttapam (pronounced Ootapahm), which was accompanied by three different sauces.  The uttapam is slightly thicker than dosa, so it's almost like a savory pancake.  It was so delicious and so filling!!   The thing that I really liked about it was the fact that it was flavorful on its own, but also came with three different sauces, all of which were completely different but worked so well with the uttapam.   So there are a ton of different taste options available to you with just one entree.\n\nThe service was great, and the food is unbelievable.  I could see Friday and Saturday evenings requiring a reservation to play it safe, but otherwise it's not bad at all.  Even if you find yourself waiting on line, stick around.

(Note: Review is for brunch) Food is fresh (thank you for my Strauss yogurt)...Dosas are tasty. Although you pay a slight greater amount to say Udupi Palace - you are paying for a slight higher quality in ingredients as well as atmosphere. I liked how everything was generally spaced out and didn't have your typical SF crowded establishment, although this may not be as economical. Our server was friendly and food came out rather timely. I wasn't a big fan of my peas & paneer dosa, but I felt it was more of the fault of mine vs. theirs. The skin of the dosa was perfectly crispy and flavorful.

A few turned into 10 then to 20.  Luckily the manager was very apologetic and offered to get us 2 appetizers on the house.  Once we got to our table, we were greeted by the most fabulous waiter ever!  His personality was stellar and just put us all in a delightful mood to set the evening.  I ordered the lamb chops which themselves were tasty, but I felt that the sauce was too spicy.  My friends got the duck which I was lucky enough to sample and I thought that was much milder in flavor, but absolutely deeeeelish.  On a side note, we waited an extremely long time between courses.  It was bad enough that we waited a long time for our table, now the overall service was moving at a glacial speed.  Unfortunately after our main course, our fabulous waiter had ended his shift and passed the baton onto the most brash, abrasive, non-friendly waitress we have ever had.  She literally threw the dessert menus onto our table and didn't even make any suggestions.  Once we ordered dessert it took forever!!!  We ordered the passion fruit custart which most likely had been sitting on the pass-through for longer than necessary because the texture was completely foreign.  Finally, I practically had to jump up and down to get her to notice that we were ready to pay.  Ugh, we were all disappointed because our fabulous waiter had left us with this awful lady.  Oh well.  \n\nI am not a huge Indian food fan, but I did enjoy the meal here with the exception of the horrific service.

Also, did want to give props to Dosa for having a Pre-fixe menu.   My husband and I ordered and shared the following:\n*  Prawn Chili Fry:  The spice was really good.  Unfortunately, the prawn was seriously overcooked so that it tasted like spicy rubber.\n*  Vada Pav (Vegetarian Sliders):   First off, it's ONE slider.  So they should really remove the \"s\".  However, it's the BEST thing that we had.  The patty was a perfect blend of spices, potatoes, chick peas, lentils and onions and the bun was soft and a perfect compliment to the slider.  If this was all I got, I'd be sold.  Unfortunately, I ate a whole dinner.\n*  Tamil Vegetable Curry:  The sauce was SUPER heavy but overall the dish was good.  This is a good dish if you want leave feeling like you have a brick in your stomach (but a tasty brick).\n*  Coconut Ginger Fish:  As opposed to our experience with the prawns, the fish was WAY undercooked and had absolutely NO flavor.  Thank goodness there was a sauce that was served with it because otherwise, it would have been wet, flavorless, undercooked fish with \"coconut rice\" that tasted like rice with parsley in it.  This was SO not worth the $29 charged.  \n*  Paneer and Peas Dosa:  The filling was really good.  However, the crepe was more like, well, a crepe.  It was a thin pancake (not crispy at all) with filling.  What do they call that?  Oh yeah, a crepe.  It's served with a coconut, tomato and sambar sauce.  The Coconut and Tomato sauce was quite good.  The Sambar was burned, to the point where I could smell the burnt-ness when spooning it to my plate.  Yikes!  For your namesake dish, it should be more authentic.  \n\nBecause my husband commented that the Sambar was burnt, we got a free dessert:  Passion Fruit Custard with tapioca.  It was the second best thing we had all night.  So if you go there, my recommendations would be to order about 3 Vada Pav's and the Passion Fruit custard, and you'll have a good dining experience.  Anything else we experienced was meh at best, and MEH for the prices they charge.  \n\nIf you want really good Indian food at a cheap price, Vics Chaat Cafe in Emeryville fits the bill.", "author": "Ria D."}

Sure the place is gorgeous but the whole vibe is entirely too pretentious in a \"we're completely oblivious to the irony of white people and house music serving food from a region previously ravaged by colonialism\" sort of way. Honestly, they play up the orientalist vision of exotic India without having any real grasp of authenticity.\n\nI stopped in, craving some alu paratha, and being a tourist i thought it was a stroke of luck to have a place just around the corner from my hotel. Aside from being ignored for the first 10 minutes by the staff (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt  and say it was because I was alone and not because I was the sole non-white patron in the whole restaurant) I was initially excited and intrigued if a bit annoyed by the decor.  The waitress sat me on a bench crowded by couples and abandoned me for another ten minutes. Over the course of the meal i ordered a divya cocktail, duck vindaloo, coconut basmati rice, and two orders of paratha. When i asked what sort of paratha they make (hoping for my tasty alu) the waitress looked at me like i was rude and repeated the menu description of a basic WHEAT. When my food came and i began to eat it (correctly) one handed by picking hunks of duck, rice, and sopping up curry with my bread, the patrons around me as well as the staff looked at me like a heathen. \n\nWas the food good? Meh. I've had way better for a lot less pretention. If you're looking for some place uptight to impress someone, dosa is for you.

Not a lot of restaurants are open until this late.\n\nOnce I entered DOSA I loved the ambience of the restaurant. the look with dimmed lights gave a very trendy yet very cozy look to the place. Coming to the food we ordered Rava Dosa, Roasted Chile & Garlic Masala Dosa, Nilgiri Chicken korma and Golden Trout Baked w/ Cilantro-Chile Chutney. With all 4 dishes we have ordered the presentation gets very high point to start with and the taste gets much higher points. All the 4 dishes were simply superb and especially the trout, is to die for.\n\nOnce we were done with the main course we wanted to try some deserts and we ordered Rasmalai. I was so surprised on how tasty it was. I have eaten Rasmalai a zillion times in India and in US and never tasted one as I tasted in Dosa.

He told me they don't really do substitutions and not on that drink.  WTF?!?!??!  This is a real bar, right?  You are a real bartender, right?  I couldn't believe it.

After we picked what we wanted, the waiters brought out our first course, and put them all in the wrong spots.  So the waiters kinda revealed our \"seat numbers\" to fix the situation.

I love idli, those spongy, white, slightly sour, steamed cakes made from fermented rice and dehusked lentil batter immersed in perfectly spicy sambar (veggie soup) and slathered with Dosa's awesome coconut and tomato chutney, also perfectly spiced.  It's the ultimate comfort food and only $7.00 which makes it a good light lunch. Even though Udupi Palace in the Mission has cheaper idli sambar, I prefer Dosa's for the more complex and deft spicing which gives more heat and assertiveness to their food without over powering the ingredients. You can sit back and enjoy the lingering impression of heat  in the mouth.\n\nI also love the rather larger than expected serving of Tamilian veggie curry with two dish-sized, flaky, buttery parathas. Expect alot of heat, but in a clean and good way. Coconut milk, normally a very dominating note, is here nicely merged with other ingredients to leave the mouth feeling stimulated afterward instead of dull and coated as can sometimes occur with ingesting spicy, rich foods.  A mango lassi or a darjeeling iced tea is good for helping with the spice.\n\nHave not tried any of the larger entrees or cocktails yet but am eager to soon.", "author": "Tara W."}

Reservation was at 12:15 and we were seated promptly. My friend and I didn't order until 12:35. Mind you, I had to ask the bus boy to tell him that we were ready to order, as it wasn't his job. \n\nHere is a breakdown of courses between myself and my friend: \nFirst course - coconut soup and chopped salad \nSecond course - chutney masala dosa and cilantro/coconut fish \nThird course - sweet pongal and coconut sorbet \n\nThe dishes were ok, as I've had better Indian cuisine. The coconut soup was very light but almost watery. The chopped salad was merely something you could do yourself. After the our first course, we waited (and I'm not joking) 40 minutes for our second course. Were they trying to kill the chicken? The wait was absurd! We weren't the only ones who had to wait on our dishes. I noticed that our neighbor kept on asking their waiter about the status of their dish. \n\n40 minutes later, our last course came, before our second! I snapped and said, \"We didn't even receive our second course!\" He apologized and quickly came with our second course. The chutney masala dosa was okay. There was an abundance of potato. If you're a vegetarian, then this is the dish for you. I'm a meat eater so I was disappointed with this. However, the chutney was okay. The cilantro and coconut fish was excellent. Yes, the restaurant receives a point for their fish as it was very moist and flaky. \n\nOur last course came literally 2 minutes after our waiter cleared our second course. I sarcastically said, \"Wow, I didn't even have to wait for my dessert!\" The rice pudding was okay... something I personally would never order again. The thought of roasted lentils and sweet rice does not make a great pairing. On the other hand, my friend had the coconut sorbet WITH saffron threads. I was surprised with the saffron threads as it is an expensive spice. It tasted interesting along with the sorbet. Our neighbor who also had the sorbet, didn't have saffron threads. We spoke to them and they agreed that service was very lousy. They were foodies so they know their culinary stuff. I told her to get the saffron threads so she could get her monies worth since my friend had saffron threads sprinkled on her sorbet. \n\nOur bill came and the total for two footed to be $49, without tip. With outstandingly TERRIBLE service, I did not hesitate to leave any tip. $0 tip for lousy service and we just walked out. \n\nIn essence, the restaurant is overrated and you can get awesome Indian food else where. Extremely terrible service. They pay no attention to their customers. Nothing memorable, except for me not leaving a tip. I don't recommend this restaurant at all.", "author": "Reviewer Z."}

After ordering (and not picking about 2 dishes she said to order) we found out that we had more than enough food by the end.  They also ran out of 2 things after ordering, the Scallops and the Chicken Biriani, which was a kitchen communication issue.  Then after we ate we asked for the check and the waitress still put down the desert menus.  Wow, it's like, dude, you really need to spend more here!  We noticed too (without her telling us) that they added the tip in (we were 6 people so it's reasonable) but at least tell us and don't include another tip line in the check like \"oh I forgot to tell you\".  Just found the whole experience to have a bad taste in my mouth.  Overall though, the atmosphere is cool there, but a little loud.

I also felt weird that we were eating in the old Good Will location. It was just a weird juxtaposition. \nThat being said, I do feel the food has suffered with the expansion. I remember eating at the original years ago and enjoying it much more. I've eaten at Udupi palace recently and have to say their dosa is better. Actually I prefer the uttapam which isn't as well known as the dosa but is like a thicker, savory pancake. Anyway, the new restaurant is pretty nice but it kind of lacks some heart in my opinion.

The kicker was when the server took my wife's glass of wine with wine still in it!\nOn top of that, as she cleared our glassware she stuck her fingers down inside the glass so that she could get two or three at a time. That's just plain damn gross! She stuck her fingers down into our dirty glasses and then just kept on serving food. \nA good start and a crappy finish. Definitely not up to the standards of our stellar restaurant culture here in San Francisco.", "author": "F B."}

They also use high quality ingredients in prepping their dishes and that quality is apparent when you taste it.  The best thing we ordered was the duck in spinach sauce.  The flavor was fantastic and the duck was cooked to tender perfection.  The idli was also quite yummy and it was great that they used Strauss creamery yougurt, as you can really taste the difference.   The service was also quite good.  We were a party of four, sharing each of the dishes we ordered, and they timed bringing our food out to us so that we could share the \"courses\".  \n\nOur party was very disappointed with some of the other things we ordered, however.  Given the name of the restaurant, we had high expectations for the dosa, but if fell flat.  It was puny and soggy, and although the sambar was delicious, the dosa was so soggy it couldn't stand up to being dipped.  We were equally disappointed with the chana bhatura, the chick peas were pretty good, but the bhatura was also greasy and soggy.  The crab cake appetizer had good flavor and very fresh crab, but the texture was also soggy on the exterior.  The chicken biriyani was good, but not good enough to justify the price of it.  \n\nFor either dosa or bhatura, you're better off going to Vik's in Berkeley.  That place certainly lacks Dosa's ambiance, but those particular dishes, Vik's are three times as good at a third of the price.", "author": "amy b."}

I always joke that I either must have been Indian in a previous life or preparing to be Indian in my next life. At this new DOSA, the food is very good, but it's South Indian food and I don't think it lends itself very well to a fancy set up. Their menu struggles with the price points. On one hand $10.50 for a Dosa is fine, but on the other hand, $9-$10 for a chaat (appetizer) is too much. May be it's ok for dinner but it's the same on their lunch menu. I would prefer if they had some lunch special where you get one vada with your meal for instance. I felt a bit odd seating in this fancy super nice and very designed interior and eating my dosa with my fingers. And I was frustrated that I wasn't comfortable spending the money to try their appetizer because lunch shouldn't be $20+ for this kind of food. On the plus side, they take reservations. I like that because I hate the hour and a half wait at the Valencia location. Bottom line: it's just OK for  me.\n\nPS: Watch for the heat on the Habanero Dosa.

The food at both restaurants are uniform in taste and presentation. I did notice one new dosa on the menu that I had not seen at Valencia, which could have been updated, and the habanero mango masala dosa created some beads of forehead sweat! We also ordered the regular masala dosa and an uttapam. Same sambar and dipping sauces. The bhel puri is a blend of bhel and sev puri, as usual with the sweet brown and mint chutneys. For the first time I tried a curry at dosa, and the lamb curry is an absolute knock out, perfect to share for three people. That dish will now be my staple order at this restaurant. The wines still serve as great pairings with the fragrant dishes. And there are some new cocktails with plenty of Indian spice flair.\n\nLastly, everyone notices the decor. The amazing chandelier train vividly points out the high ceilings which makes for a spacious and classy restaurant. Valencia is more on the casual side as most people with parties less than 6 are walk-ins, and the bar is always jammed pack. The Fillmore location, takes RESERVATIONS on OpenTable.com for parties of all sizes. Without reservations, slum it at the roomy long bar! If you are luckier, score an immediate spot at the long communal table that may seat about 15, but it is quite tight. There is definitely plenty of eye contact and eyelash batting at this communal table. * wink * wink * If you are a people-watcher and conversation-listener like me, topics around this narrow stretch of wood can be quite...interesting, to say the least. For example we were debating the merits and credibility of YELP *ahem* and the waitstaff happened to pass by and over hear with a smirk on her face. I cringed hoping that the rest of the evening would not involve a swift kick to the butt and boot out of there. Needless to say, it was a great dining experience.\n\nParking can be quite difficult in Pacific Heights proper, but the location is a few blocks further, across from Japantown. I found free street parking after circling thrice around the block for a peak 7PM Sunday dinner. If I were to circle once more, I was more than willing to drop off my guest and head over to the Japantown parking garage. My convenience balance sides with Fillmore.", "author": "Cathy H."}

For those who are not familiar with the difference between South Indian and North Indian food, which may explain reviews of this restaurant for not being \"authentic\", they are about as different as New England vs. Southern American cuisine. North Indian is what you tend to get in almost all Indian restaurants. It is heavy on cream and butter. Southern Indian tends to be much lighter, heavy on spices, sometimes quite hot, with one of the traditional dishes being the Dosa. The Dosa is a paper thin crepe made out of rice and lentils which is then stuffed with various vegetables. Our favorite is the Masala Dosa, which is the potato and onion Dosa. You then have three sauces to dip it in (read: control the spiciness level). We eat here all the time, have gone through almost the entire menu, and have never had anything that wasn't good. Some of our favorites: their fire broth, a super spicy tomato broth, chenna chicken, chickpee curry, and the masala dosa. Their wine list is excellent, seriously, and very unique.\n\nThe negative: they don't take reservations for parties of four or less. And this is new, we have gone there with over six and they wouldn't take a reservation. The place is PACKED, particularly on the weekends, which means you end up waiting for over an hour at the bar. Oh, and the place is very noisy - bad acoustics. It's also not cheap. This is NOT your neighborhood curry house - but it is worth every cent.\n\nAs for not being \"authentic\" we just left the place this evening and at the line to pay for the parking ticket we ran into one of my husband's coworkers, a South Indian man. His family was visiting from Southern India and wanting to take them to the best Southern Indian restaurant in San Francisco he took them to Dosa. They loved it!", "author": "Natasha Anna A."}

South Indian food, unlike food from the northern part of the country tends to not be cream based (yeah for you lactose intolerant people!). I would recommend most things at Dosa, but for you new comers this is not your chicken tikka marsala place you think of with Indian food. The dosa are basically huge crepes that they roll up and give you with spiced potatoes and some curry and chutneys to either dip it in or to wrap up in it (you're choice!). The uttapam are what I imagine would happen if a pancake and a hashbrown had a baby - and you also get some dipping sauces and curry with them.

I just wish there were more Indian paintings of culture, besides that one huge picture at the back left. \n\nThe dosa itself was like anything else I could find in any other South Indian restaurant back in Southern California, so the food did not disappoint me. The taste of the chutneys are considerably milder, however, but it caters to the crowd that comes here and that does not mind paying more than they actually should for South Indian food.\n\nBut I gotta say, although South Indian food is normally not the most expensive of all cuisines, the price was fitting for the beautiful atmosphere and the experience. In fact, I am surprised that with such a classy-looking restaurant, it wasn't even MORE expensive! But I don't want to place ideas in the owners' heads now...\n\nI would come back for the new twists they take on traditional Indian food that make it gourmet. I would also come back for the bar and the atmosphere if I wanted to show it off to some friends or a date. But for completely traditional South Indian food, I would go to the ones in LA that serve the same tasty dishes for even cheaper.

No this is no shill, I've only met Anjan a few times and met his wife Emily last night, I'm just a huge fan of what they've done by elevating ethnic food and adding a contemporary flair to it (one day secretly hoping to do something like this for Chinese food myself).  They are both really warm hosts and I would love to see more restaurant owners interacting with their clientele like they do (the Quince owner was also very friendly).  We got to the restaurant and were seated right away (I made a reservation on OpenTable but it looks like there were still seats available since it was a Sunday night and I don't think people know it's opened yet.  \n\nNow on to the food.  I am a big fan of the Valencia Dosa and had to introduce my friend to the dahi vada (lentil dumplings) and the dosas and uttapams.  This time I tried one of the many new additions to the menu that aren't available at the Mission location.  There are several new South Indian starters and entrees like the halibut from Anjan's mother's recipe.  We tried the crab vada which were South Indian crab cakes that were very flavorful and unique.  You could taste the spices infused with the crab meat with each bite.  We also went with the fish moilee which was a very nice mild curry that was slightly sweet from the coconut milk.  The two starters, the entree and the paper dosa were more than enough to fill both our tummies with South Indian heaven.  Total damage with glass of wine and tip was around $85.  Not bad at all.  The servers were definitely attentive as it's only their second week open and it seemed like there were 10 of them running around taking orders, serving food and filling water glasses.  Beautiful ambiance, delicious food and gracious hosts, you can't ask for much more than that.", "author": "Dave L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-12", "description": "My random thoughts on Dosa include:\n\n1) How out of place is this place?  Huge vaulted ceilings, fancy lighting and decoration, lounge/techno music in the background...and a BK across the street that you can see through the oversized windows.  You can practically wave at the King from your table.\n\n2) You must go to this place if only to try the turbocharged bathroom hand dryers.  In fact, if you go to a movie at the Kabuki please do the following.  Step 1: purchase large soda, or better yet, go to a movie in theatre one and consume 2-3 alcholic beverages during the movie.  Step 2: squirm in your seat during the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Step 3: Go across the street to Dosa for \"a drink\" and utilize the facilities.  Step 4: WASH YOUR HANDS PEOPLE!  Step 5: Utilize the hand dryer.  Step 6: Go to Mt. Zion Hospital (convienently located just a few blocks away) to have the skin from your hand reattached.  Cheers.\n\n3) The food is good.  Very good in fact.  Buuuuttttttt so are a bunch of Indian places in the city that charge far less.  So, while you'll eat well here, you do pay a premium for the lounge/techno music playing while you eat.\n\n4) Can't say I cared for the staff.  Our waiter was a little too opinionated about what we were ordering (\"Wonderful Choice!\"....\"Uh, ok, if you want that...\") and the hostess was less than stellar.  After telling us our table wasn't quite ready for our reservation, she invited us to grab a drink while we wait.  Fair enough.  10 minutes later it occurred to me that there were 243,123,552 people (numbers approximate) hanging out around the bar and I didn't see the hostess wading into that mob to grab people for their table.  When we went to check on the status of our table, we were told it was going to be a while.  I then reminded her that we had a reservation, at which point we were immediately seated.  So, while I've had much worse experiences and while I somewhat sympathize with the poor girl (there were A LOT of people trying to get seated) it wasn't the most professional experience I've ever had.\n\nPeace", "author": "Jason S."}

The table was great, right in front of the windows, and while there was one occassion where it got difficult to hear, overall it wasn't too bad. The overall ambiance more than made up for it. The service overall was phenomenal, and the food was very good. We did the price fixe for 4 courses, which was plenty enough food for us even though it is smaller portions. The service was amazing. They continuously filled our glasses with water and checked in on us, and we were there for over 2 1/2 hours during peak time without feeling rushed in the least.\n\nThe music in the background is top 40ish which seems odd for the ambiance. We noticed it and it made us chuckle.\n\nParking is a challenge! I looked for over 20 minutes while my date waited inside. Valet would definitely make this place better. I couldn't even find a garage, so locate one ahead of time. Even with the parking, the experience was worth the trouble.", "author": "Ronda B."}

Our friends were in the area looking for parking and we were hoping that we could sit down first. Although the restaurant was nearly empty, we were asked to wait for about 15 minutes instead of getting seated right away. I felt like Ben Stiller in \"Meet the Parents\" in the scene where he was asked to wait to board the flight when no one else was getting on the plane! Of course, in the meantime, we were badgered by the hostess confirming with us whether or not our friends were on their way. When our friends did arrive, and we were by then deciding whether or not we wanted to just eat at the bar or do a sit-down dinner, 2 hostesses and a waiter were pushing us to have a seat at that point! Needless to say, my first impression was not very good as the staff were interrupting a quick conversation among friends deciding what we wanted to do. I understand they wanted us to sit down and get that mandatory 20% tip for parties of 5 or more, but c'mon! They might as well have acted like the hostess at Claw in the movie \"Date Night\" where they would answer their telephone by saying, \"Welcome to Dosa, you're welcome!\"\n\nThe food is good with small portions and pricey, but that is what you would probably expect here given the decor. Our wait staff was friendly enough, but she was obviously displeased when we were just having appetizers and drinks (hey, we wanted to sit at the bar!).\n\nSo overall, the food is decent, albeit pricey, but the hostesses could definitely do a better job at being a lot less snooty! It could have been a one time thing given the other reviews, but I'm not planning on going back anytime soon.", "author": "Anthony W."}

I really don't know too much about Indian, so I think that significantly impacted my appreciation for a meal here.\n\nIn general, this is one of the more respected places for Indian cuisine in the Bay Area, so I think it's probably just as good as it's 4-star rating.", "author": "Lindsay M."}

The restaurant was completely filled; the bar area and the whole dining area.  We were all excited to eat because of how lively, packed, and extravagant the restaurant was.  We ordered our appetizers and were kind of shocked at how spicy the calamari was!  I understand that Indian food tends to be on the spicier side, but this was uncontrollable.  We were hoping the duck, shrimp and chicken plates we ordered would make up for the appetizer but sadly they did not.  The duck plate only included the leg meat which was upsetting because of the high price we paid for it.  The chicken was way too spicy and the shrimp was the only satisfying dish.  My dad actually talked to the waitor because of how little duck meat we had in our 'duck dish.'  On top of all that, each of my family members including myself became sick when we got home.

We couldn't find street parking so settled for parking in the Japantown garage, which we hadn't been to in years.  We were at the restaurant on time and it was packed in there.  Tons of people at the bar, communal table full, people milling around the entrance.  We worked our way to the hostess and were told our table wasn't ready because they were running behind, but there were quite a few tables paying.  So we found a seat at the end of the long bench they have running from the entrance to the back of the restaurant.  We weren't sure the hostess knew where we had gone and were wondering if we should go back and let her know after we'd been waiting 25 minutes, but someone came over to us and let us know our table would be ready very soon.  That was very good in our book.  We were seated very shortly after that to a table that was kind of in the middle of everything.  It was 3 of us at a table of 4.  Because there was that one empty seat, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, decided that was the best place to walk through.  I can't begin to tell you how many times our table was bumped or I was hit with someone's bottom or someone's purse.  THAT wasn't very cool.  The tables there aren't that close together, but I guess they were close enough that everyone decided they can only walk through the middle where our table was and bump into it.\n\nThe food was actually pretty tasty.  The chips they give (rather than bread) was a nice touch.  We ordered the calamari starter, which was very small, but quite tasty.  We ended up dipping our chips in the sauce, which was really good.  For my entree, I had the masala dosa.  I'd never had a dosa before so I figured I'd go with the classic.  When it came, it was HUGE.  Our server was really nice and explained how we were supposed to eat our dosas.  We really liked her.  She came to check on us often and was especially nice.  I forget what we had for dessert.  It was like coconut and saffron in a philo wrap with some candied kiwis or something.  That was pretty interesting.  I'd have to say I liked the kiwis the best out of the dessert though.\n\nAMBIANCE:  Very nice.  You'd never know it used to be Goodwill.  They really did a great job with it.  And I love the lighting!  There's an upstairs section that we didn't go to, but I'd love to see how that looks as well.\n\nTo sum it up, I might go back.  It's not too expensive and the food isn't that bad.  I'd definitely want to be seated somewhere where our table wasn't constantly being bumped though.", "author": "Kris L."}

Very lucky!\nThe place was packed, but our service did not suffer much. We ordered a round of their specialty cocktails; the flavors were fun and unique even if a little unexpected. One member of our party was surprised to taste the bright acidity of a gastrique in his mango beverage.\nWe started with two soups: the beet soup was rich, smooth, brightly colored, and tasted just as it should have--like beets. I preferred the roasted red pepper and coconut milk soup, which tasted like a Thai curry without the rice. I liked it so much I had a hard time sharing.\nThe dosas were wonderful, even by the strict standards of our Indian friends, who grew up on their mother's homemade dosas. My duck, spinach, and paneer entree was good, though perhaps a little heavy on the cloves and anise. I tried with with both the lemon and coconut flavored rices, and found that the flavor of the rice made little difference to the assertive curry. My husband's fish entree was a bit lighter, and was wonderful with the coconut rice.\nOverall, the decor and ambiance combined with the pulsing techno music made this place a little too trendy for me, but I'd love to try the other location sometime because the food was great.", "author": "Courtney K."}

We ordered a masala dosa, the Indian crispy \"crepe\" with spiced potatoes inside, and a curry that was divine with the perfect mix of spice and buttery creamy goodness. The dosa was very similar to what you would get at Chutney's in Hyderabad (minus the banana leaf serving platter), and this restaurant did a good job of South Indian in a more upscale atmosphere.

Unfortunately most of the Indian restaurants in the bay area are North Indian. I've been going to Dasaprakash in Santa Clara all these years, but it's nice to have something closer and in SF proper for a change. Dosa is a bit Amercanized, but I like their take on it, especially considering they have a full bar and trendy ambiance. I have yet to be disappointed with the food, but I will say that I don't like the reservation process. I've waited 30-45 minutes on multiple occasions when I've had dinner reservations. Lunch is less chaotic. I was there this past Friday and it was super chill. We started out with mojitos from the bar, Mango & Goat Cheese salad, Prawn Chile Fry, & Samosas 'North & South'. All very good and highly recommended. For an entree we shared the Paper Masala which is huge. Between 2 people this was plenty of food and we even had some left overs. We had a couple desserts as well, but I can't remember their names. One had pistachios in it and the other was  something with passion fruit. Both very good, but on opposite ends of the taste spectrum. The passion fruit was very tart and the pistachio one was sweet/blandish. I probably would pass on the pistachio one next time.

When someone else walked by to see how things were we told them that the lamb curry was a bit spicy. They offered some yogurt raita to cool it down. How nice!

Constantly refilling waters, folding my boyfriend's napkin when he left to go to the restroom, great food descriptions from our server.\nThe price - really reasonable for the dosas (avg. $10), okay for the curries (avg. $15)\nNice touches to the food - Organic chicken and real shaved coconut in the rice.\n\nThe bad: The overly salted food. We had the Chennai Chicken (appetizer), Chutney Masala Dosa, and the Chicken Korma. All the dishes, especially the chennai chicken and the dosa with it's various dipping sauces tasted like someone had upended an entire bottle of salt onto each of our dishes.

The food came out hot and at the right times. All the dishes I tried were really fresh and tasty.

The chandeliers were particularly beautiful, as were the unique art installations and stencils. I cannot express how good it feels to eat quality Indian food in a setting that lives up to it. Refreshing in a city of budget options from the subcontinent.\nAnd given the ambiance, the prices are no higher than the Valencia location, which is a nice plus. We sampled a huge variety of dishes, listed below:\n- apps: chennai chicken (a standby), the calamari, and the coconut cauliflower soup (now becoming an addiction)\n- entrees: kerala fish moilee was the hit of the night. Chicken baingan bharta and lamb curry were runners up. Paneer and peas dosa was excellent.\n- dessert: pistachio kulfi and rasmalai. Good but can't match the rest of the food.\n- Wine: Margerum M5 from Santa Barbara. Without a doubt our favorite wine to accompany Dosa's menu. Has become the standard wine order. \nOnly issue was the dosa that arrived a half hour after the rest of the food, pretty much bringing the meal to a grinding halt, leading to this four star rating. \nNo doubt we will be back though, late dosa or not.", "author": "Purnima M."}

Only 4 asparagus spears on the plate, normal to small size. Small plate of calamari, too, with a little slaw, but great flavors.\nThen, we had the masala dosa, another pancake-like dish with caramelized onions, a slow-cooked chicken dish with the lemon rice and a puffy fried wheat bread. The dosa was my favorite, reminded me of a doughy crepe. The lentil soup that came with both of the \"dosas\" was quite spicy. Portions seem to be average, not huge but not small either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-05", "description": "In December, Anjan and Emily Mitra opened a second branch of their South Indian eatery, DOSA on Fillmore.  They brought their executive chef, Senthil Kumar, from Valencia Street to run the kitchen in this bright, spacious building that has been beautifully transformed from its former Goodwill digs.  \n\nMy father has enjoyed traveling to India, so I invited him to sample DOSA's dishes.  Once we ordered, our server gave us a plate of papardam, large black pepper crisps made with lentil butter.  We nibbled while listening to an interesting mix of American pop and traditional Indian music in the background.  We shared Blackened Sardines ($9.50), a pair of deliciously crispy fried sardines rubbed with green chiles, coriander, cumin, pepper, chopped greens and onions accompanied with lime and a cucumber, tomato and red onion salad.  The Chennai Chicken ($9.50) came out next, organic chicken marinated in organic yogurt with coriander and cumin, then fried.   It packs a perfect amount of heat from all the spices.  It came with a slaw of cabbage, carrot, beet, red onion and spinach lightly dressed with a sweet cilantro vinaigrette.  There are a variety of Dosa, or savory rice and lentil crepes, and Uttapam, a slightly thicker pancake version of Dosa, to choose from.  Both come with three condiments - a fresh tomato chutney, coconut chutney, and sambar, a warm lentil dipping soup made of assorted vegetables and spices.  My father had the Chile and Cilantro Uttapam ($10) with green chiles, onion and cilantro which was tasty but much milder than I expected.  I ordered the Spring Dosa ($11), crunchy veggie rolls filled with fresh cabbage, carrots, red onion, peas and typically, cashews, but I opted to go without.  They delivered a Spring Uttapam by mistake, but quickly replaced it with a Dosa, and plated it with an extra piece to make up for their error.  We tried Coconut Basmati Rice ($3) cooked in a myriad of flavors including coconut milk, yellow lentils, mustard seeds, red chiles, and South Indian drumstick leaves which are mostly strained out before serving.  It was interesting, didn't love it, didn't hate it.\n\nToday, DOSA on Fillmore was a sunny, quiet setting for a liesurely lunch, but I hear it packs a weekend crowd who enjoy the dinner and lively bar scene.  Speaking of the bar, we each enjoyed a signature cocktail.  The Bengali Gimlet ($10) was a refreshing blend of Tanqueray Rangpur Gin, \"curried\" nectar, Kaffir lime leaf and juice, served up with a lime wedge.  I tried the Mood Indigo ($10) with Buffalo Trace Bourbon, jackfruit marmalade, Angostura bitters, chilled and topped with sparkling wine which was fruity with a nice bite from the bitters. \n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant dining experience.  Despite being a little heavy on the fried treats and a tad steep for everyday lunching - our total bill came to more than $70 -  this is a fun place to go occasionally with family or friends when you are not in a big hurry.  Good variety for vegetarians and wheat and gluten-free eaters.   Lunch is served daily from 11:30am-3:00pm.", "author": "Dina B."}

I don't mind the closeness, they seemed to  a little bit though, as it was clear by the hand-holding what kind of intimacy they were looking for.\n\nThe rest of the environment was great -- an awesome, mellow soundtrack paired with the dim lighting and dark, warm colors and topped off with gentle laughing from others enjoying their meals. \n\nOur waiter was GORGEOUS, and very polite. There wasn't a whole lot of interaction with him (unfortunately for me), but I think that's part of the swag-style ambiance of the place. Actually, come to think of it, the whole theme of the employees was to downplay customer interaction -- they all didn't really say much, which kind of felt like they were being short, but they were still really polite ... maybe it's the influence of the asian-concentrated local ... or maybe that's a totally wrong stereotype. Whatever. Back to the pretty guy, I liked his service, but I had wished I had more water.\n\nI had two cocktails, a great one with mango, and another that I really wanted to like for its flavors, but it was really, really spicy -- it was different though, so I enjoyed it even though my throat burned. \n\nMy peppercorn chicken dish was great, which I paired with the suggested lemon rice.

I loved their cup of hot chai and coffee. Their coffee almost tasted like milk tea but with a different after taste to it. Very classy and elegant. Cool atmosphere. The space and colors of the interior. along with the nice decorations are warm and welcoming. Be sure to make reservations.", "author": "stephanie n."}

Excitement abounds; mommy pals out for the eve is a serious impetus for toasting! The structure of a fab dinner were all in place-- organic meat and local sourced produce? Check! Innovative cocktail menu with random \"tincture\" ingredients thrown in? Double check! Big cosy booth that lends itself to a \"sleepover\" sort of intimacy? The trifecta! So why less than stellar outcome? Well.. service was that flawed combo of pushy, but lacking in precision. When you ask a server for recommendations, you don't need a slippery fish, you need succinct decision-making. Sometimes that means a willingness to slam a few items to illustrate their point of what really is advised. In this case, everything was rosy.. but nothing really clear. And descriptions were off-- Me: is the crab cake breaded and deep fried? Her: NO! Not at all.. pan fried, much crab.. and then a deep fried potato pancake basically appeared a few minutes later.. ahem. Also, they didn't carry Belvedere vodka, which makes a liquor snob a little grievous. And while the food gets points for innovative, (i did like the mung bean salad and the lentil dipping soup), the other dishes lackluster.. heavy and spicy, but not subtle or elegant. I don't know, maybe the waitress just uber annoyed. At the end of the meal to move on along the push was enormous.. which my mommy friend needed none of.. and a 2nd cocktail wasn't ever solicited! So you see, i may take my weekend eve enthusiasm elsewhere..", "author": "Rachel S."}

Awesome that the owners are trying to introduce south indian food to the masses. The dining room itself is nicely done although transparently trendy in kind of a lame way. I took my south Indian boyfriend and....we were dissapointed. The price is way too high for what you get, spices are toned down for a western palate and the service SUCKED. They seated uis late, the women servers had snobby whiny voices and the food seriously was mediocre. SARAVANA BHAVAN in Sunnyvale is what incredible South Indian food tastes like.

We came 1.5hrs early hoping to get seated earlier.  A party of 13 people came who accidentally made their reservations for the day before.  They were accommodated and seated within 45min.  I watched and listened for 1.5hrs as smaller parties of 2-4 people (who came on time) were made to wait another 15-20min.  The hostess used the excuse...\"I'm sorry for the wait.  People are hanging around the tables longer\"  That wasn't the case.  I understand that a large party will equal a bigger bill and  more money for Dosa, but smaller parties who come on time shouldn't be penalized for this.  I didn't think  Dosa was the kind of business that functioned this way.   A professional business should honor a reservation that's been made and make every effort to seat that party on time.

Our friend who just so happens to be one of the managers there told us about their first public opening yesterday and so we came to check him out and support his new gig.  We were presently surprised to see this huge, well-lit, poshy, upbeat, simply indescribable venue.  Everything in this place is just gorgeous and almost transient and engulfing.  From the huge opening doors with bamboo looking silver handles, to the amazing chandeliers, to the metal leaf artwork on the left and the white marble topped bar on the right.  If I had to decorate a restaurant, I want to get some tips for whoever put this one together.  I don't think I have been this excited about just an ambiance since I first walked into 1300 on Fillmore.  \n\nUsing our connections, we were able to get one of the best seats in the house, on the Mezzanine level, looking down towards the bar area.  Walking up, I was immediately struck by how beautiful the bamboo hard floors were and once we actually got upstairs, the entrancing artwork is just breathtaking.  I think I could go on and on about just looking at this place and we hadn't even tried the food yet.  \n\nWe knew from our past experience that Dosa was just delectable.  We started off with the Northern/Southern Dosa with the cilantro and tamarind sauces. YUM YUM. Spicy and hot.  It was a shame we only got 2 on our plate.  The onion pakora is perfect. Wish they had a side business of selling just those, it would replace any chip addiction I've ever had.  Next we each had our main courses: the lamb chop, perfectly cooked.  The sauce according to the Mister was a bit on the heavy side, but delicious.  I had the Tamil Vegetable Curry with a Dosa and that was consistently great. And our cousin had the calamari which was probably the most delicious thing we all had.  We also ordered some drinks: The Bowler which I had, which tasted a bit too \"tequila-ish\" for me, but that just went against my own personal preference. I do think it was a greatly put together drink though.  The cuz got the Batsman which was delicious, light and airy almost like a cooler.  The Mister got the Taj Mahal beer which he seemed to enjoy.\n\nI want to give this venue the last star, but again coming on opening night, there were just a few wrinkles that I think will be ironed out in time. Really minor things like having a steak knife for the lamb, small plates for the appetizers and one of the waiters not counting positions so he could give each of us our order correctly.  Seriously minor stuff that would not keep us from coming back.  \n\nPlus we found out from our friend that the venue itself was made with some environmentally friendly materials, including the paint.  \nAnd, when we all went to the bathroom upstairs, the floors were golden textured with swirls. The walls were also golden with flowers imprinted on it if you looked close enough. It was really kept clean, AND the a huge plus was the monster air machine that blew the water off when you washed your hands. This machine made me feel like my hands were going sky diving it was so strong! \n\nThe greatest part is that we were introduced to the owners which were 2 just beautiful spirits that seemed to be a power couple! I have some positive transference with these 2 folks.  Congratulations guys...the restaurant is simply beautiful!  What a risk to take in the economy we have... yet so worth it!

The restaurant was buzzing for sure which gave me hope that this would be a great meal.  The bar was great with good cocktails and in about 40 minutes we got a table(make reservations on busy nights if you are going).  We ordered the fire broth soup, masala dosa and mung spouts which were all excellent.  Then our entrees came and this is where it went down hill.  The lamb chop came highly recommended so we order it and was not impressed.  It was over cooked with the thickest most over powering paste that tasted more like a coriander spice jar that took over everything on the plate.  With it came the spiced potatoes that spent way to long in a warming pan.  Next was the kerala fish moilee and the mango jumbo prawns.

The food is great at both locations, but the decor and ambiance at the Fillmore location is nicer with more of a loungy vibe.   It was Saturday.  My girlfriends and I had just finished watching a late movie at the Kabuki.  It was almost midnight and we were hungry.  So we headed across the street to DOSA.   We ordered the crab vadas, the regular masala dosa, and the chutney masala dosa to share.  The chutney dosa had a light spread of eggplant on it, but the difference between that and the regular masala dosa was very slight.  I loved the sambar that they provided with dosas for dipping.  It had a bit of kick to it and lots of flavor.  Everything tasted great.  Even my friend, who was not a fan of curry or Indian cuisine, enjoyed everything.  Between the three of us, the bill came out to $34 plus tip.  Not bad at all for a filling meal.", "author": "Cindy G."}

But I finally made it here and we decided to sit at the bar.  The atmosphere is fun, and a little ethnic w/ a modern touch.  The bar is well stocked and their mixed drinks looked delicious.  We started w/ the Chennai Chicken which was good and a great recommendation from our waiter.  I wanted the Mango Jumbo Prawns, but the server misheard me and instead we got the Starter - Prawn Chile Fry (wouldn't highly recommend).  Our waiter also recommended South Indian Moons Uttapam - in which we would've been able to taste a variety as the menu stated.  But it really was 1 kind that came w/ the different side sauces.  After, I heard that the paper masala dosa is what people rave about - wish I tried that...next time.  Overall, I'd probably come back for a cocktail or if I was headed to Kabuki, but it's not cheap and there's a multitude of great restaurants in SF that I'd rather go to before coming back.", "author": "Meredith K."}

We shared some crab cakes, a spicy mung bean dosa, Goan prawns (w/ yogurt rice), and a chicken korma (with coconut rice).  The crab cakes were pretty bland and uninteresting, but everything else was very flavorful.  The prawns had quite a kick to them but not so much so that you couldn't taste the spices (and it went well with the yogurt rice).  Chicken korma is normally not my thing but my friends are generally picky and they really liked it.  All this for $26 a person (not in including drinks) was not bad at all.", "author": "Irene W."}

They were pretty packed, and we almost gave up before even speaking to the  hostess. She suggested we grab a drink at the bar and see what happens.  At 7:05 the hostess let us know that 2 seats were ready at the community table.  With 30 minutes to movie time, we thought it wouldn't work, but she assured us it would.  I just want to thank her for that.  We had a phenominal dinner, and the food came out so fast, you'd have thought the chefs heard us order.  Moreover, the hostess had made the servers aware of our time constraints, and sped everything up accordingly.  We walked out of there at 7:30 and were settling into our seats as the last preview came to an end.  All in all, a great dining experience for the wonderful food and equally wonderful service.   Thanks Dosa!", "author": "Brian S."}

It was dimly lit, but very elegant inside. And surprisingly full at 8pm on a Monday night. We sat at the bar and waited for a table. My friend decided to try the Maharaja Indian beer, which he said wasn't bad. Then they seated our party of four on a small, round table that I would normally be used for 4 people in a bar or coffee shop (definitely not enough room to put all the food we were going to order). So minus 1 star. \n\nWe decided to order several items a la carte and share instead of going with the $39 pre-fixe menu. We first started with 2 appetizers: Chennai Chicken and Chochin Calamari. Both were pretty tasty, and a tad bit spicy. We then ordered 3 entrees and 1 dosa (Jumbo Prawns Masala, Spiced Lamb Chops, Kerala Fish Moilee, and Spring Dosa). My favorites were the prawns and the spring dosa, although the lamb and fish had good flavor. We also had sides of lemon rice, coconut rice, and cilantro rice and one bhatura (which was yummy with the curries). Now with all the food mentioned above, it was quite a feat for us to try to squeeze it onto the table. It was a little annoying that the wait staff did not offer much help in trying to accodomate the small table they gave us with offereing to transfer items to smaller plates (but the busboy was helpful). Also, the waiter knew we were sharing items, but they only gave us small plates during the appetizers and then cleared them away (although we wouldn't have room for additional plates). My boyfriend and I ended up using the empty dosa plate and eating off of that. I was pretty stuffed by the end, but we ate pretty much everything.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Gulab Jamoon and Toasted Coconut and Saffrom Barfi. Unfortuantely I wasn't a big fan of hte Gulab Jamoon (I don't really like my friend things all soggy with syrup) and the Toasted Coconut was tasty, but reminded me of a Chinese bun that I can get easily. So next time I'll probably skip dessert.\n\nLastly, when we received the bill, there were 2 drinks on there that we did not order. We flagged down a waitress, who took about 10 minutes to get us the correct bill (and she was not our original waiter because he was nowhere in sight, and I'm assuming she took over his tables because she took the order of the table next to us and took our bill when we were ready to pay. But I guess I'll never know for sure because our waiter wasn't around for the last 20 minutes we were there). Bill came out to about $200 ($50/person). Slightly more than exprected but the meal was pretty good.", "author": "T C."}

Very cool, very hip, and not pretentious at all. The specialty cocktails are really good, if not a little pricey, and the food is not only great but also in my opinion a great value. I started with a Smoked Cup (cocktail) which was really tasty, and had a bowl of the beet soup to start. I am a total fan of beets anyway, but this soup was fabulous. Progressing to the main course, I had the paneer and peas uttapam with a side of spicy achar. Also fabulous. But at this point I was getting kind of full (although I managed to clean my plate, achar and all). So my friend Tasha was taking a little longer than I to finish, and as is our custom I sat a little impatiently while she picked at her masala dosa, which she also loved. While I was waiting I decided to order a cup of chai to give me something to do. The chai was delicious but drinking that cup of hot tea-flavored milk sent me over the edge. I left the restaurant super uncomfortable because I was so full, but vowing to come back. Good thing for the 6-block walk home.", "author": "Sarah K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-01", "description": "Had dinner here tonight and was very pleasantly surprised.  Everything was excellent: food, service, atmosphere.  The lighting is pretty cool and the super high ceiling (18' or so) makes for a dramatic space.  Didn't like the acoustic-like tiles on the ceiling, though.  Enough about that, let's get to the food: shared everything and got to eat with my hands, which I love.  Before we ordered, they brought out some pappadam (this may be misspelled), which I could've eaten until I turned into the blueberry girl on Willy Wonka -- it's so yummy.  Started with the organic greens, mango and goat cheese (light and tastey), and the prawn chilifry (nicely spicey).  Then had my first dosa: went with the basic masala style, which was quickly consumed by the two of us.  For our main course, we had the Bagara Baingan with coconut rice.  This seemed the most typical (yet delightful) dish of the four.  The place was quite busy on a Monday evening and the music was present but not overbearing.  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Kevin M."}

French-Californian over and over. We keep going back because these places have nice atmospheres, good service, good beverages, and decent food. Well Dosa takes it to a whole new level! They have the great atmosphere, great service, really great cocktails and wine selection and the food is FANTASTIC! No more of the bland French-Californian mediocrity. The flavors, combinations, and presentations of the food are unlike I've ever seen. The food is just as good if not better than the Valencia location and the atmosphere is 10 times better. Not to mention the creative cocktail options they have introduced. I had some sort of cocktail with gin, lime, chili, and curry that had more levels of flavor than I have ever experienced in a cocktail. I also highly recommend the duck spinach with paneer masala!! PS the prices are very reasonable. I will be recommending this place to all my friends!", "author": "Barbara N."}

Most memorable today was the \"Prawn Frankie,\" tender pieces of shrimp in a light \"tomatoey\" curry sauce lovingly wrapped in roti. Super yum. I'll be back for that.  My two friends and I  shared the avocado and chick pea salad, not bad considering I don't much like either. The  surprise hit was the banana creme pie that's served with a heaping pile of cooked sweet bananas. My friends said the hot  chai they ordered was a tad on the weak side and well, looked as much. We also had a fantastic dosa filled with a potato, cilantro and onion mush that was incredible. So good! Our server today was busy doubling as the bartender but he was warm and knowledgeable. He even told me where to find a portable blow torch to make creme brulee when he overheard me say how much I loved that dish. This place also has great drinks. My fave is the Ginger Ante.  Parking can be a challenge but there's a garage right across the street that charges $2/hr on Saturdays.", "author": "Helena B."}

The fried bread, Bhatura, was out of this world and has completely spoiled me for ever on delicious fried doughs. But I am very disappointed in their wine situation. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT order wine by the glass from Dosa under any circumstances. They have the smallest pours of any restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life. All 3 of the glasses of wine my dinner party ordered last night were ridiculously tiny. We're talking maybe 4 oz at best. For a $8 to $12 glass of wine, that's just plan disrespectful of your customers and honestly, despite the wonderful draw of their food, makes me not want to return. I don't think a restaurant that can't find it's way to pouring a decent size glass of wine, given how much money they already make off wine and spirits given the serious markups they have, deserves my business no matter how fabulous the food. So be warned. Dosa short changes you like nothing I have ever seen before when it comes to wine. OH and side note, their Raita is good but not fabulous and certainly not worth the $4.50 for the tiny cup they serve you as a side order. It's quite absurd.", "author": "Jennifer F."}
