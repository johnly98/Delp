During the few minutes we waited for our table, at least 3 of the staff greeted and welcomed us. Service was altogether great with very friendly staff. We ordered a large pitcher of beer, antipasti salad, and a large Haystack pizza. All was very good, and they are generous on the toppings. We felt the pizza could have used more sauce, but will just ask for some extra on the side next time. Have I had better pizza? Yes. But I definitely enjoyed it and will be back. Pro tip: my partner and I are two big guys with equally large appetites, and had leftovers on the 16\". Will order 14\" next time.", "author": "Winston C."}

Speed of food coming out often is faster than the wait staff can bring it, and that is not due to just being microwaved. \n\n1-2 stars: Freshness of salad, pizza quality at times, slowness of wait staff at times (at best a 3 hence why we sit at the counter), wine selection not as big as most italian/pizza places in bay area. \n\nDefinitely a solid option when used strategically as in certain items are extremely good value for San Francisco.", "author": "David A."}

A piping hot pizza (yes hot) arrived from Haystack. The best pizza there is the simple New York. It tastes just like an honest to goodness New York slice, the delicious kind that you fold & eat. The crust is thin and crispy, the sauce sublime. The cheese is perfect, and the herbs add a subtle flavor. But back to the sauce--it's so good. At $13.50 for a medium pie, this beats pretentious Una Pizza Napolitana by a mile. Sure, UPN is good--but it's twenty-five bucks & Zero Zero is less expensive & just as good. Plus Zero won't shame you for asking for chili pepper flakes. (That's right folks--Una Pizza Pretenciosa doesn't ALLOW any condiments except salt. And I've had pizza in Napoli, & it doesn't cost $25.) \n\nHaystack's NY pizza is the like Napoli's spunky cousin. It looks different, tastes different --but she's just as tasty. Dining in is like stepping back to the Mad Men 60s. Sit with your pals in the back room, and order a  a carafe of Burgundy (yes, Burgundy--I told you, it's old school;) & a plate of antipasti.

I honestly don't give a rats about minor things like that.\n\nNo Haystack, let me tell you about what I expected from you this particular evening, and what I received instead.\n\nI had an awesome walking trip with my family, from Glen Park, all the way up Diamond Heights, back down through Noe Valley, and finally making it to 24th. We were tired, we were hungry. And I personally had a young child who was very whinny after the long walk. \n\nWe went to the first pizza place nearest to us, and had lame service there (check my last review), then left to find a better place. That's when my GF tells me, \"Let's go to Haystack!\", and a rush of feel good memories hits me. Some of our best dates were at this place. The last time we walked the same route with my family, we ended up here and had a blast. So I was DOWN to eat there.\n\nEnough beating around the bush, let me tell you WHERE YOU JACKED UP(please DON'T excuse my french, because Yelp's guidelines won't allow me to swear). When our FIRST pizza came, it was a size smaller than what we ordered, plus had the wrong toppings. Hey, no big deal, just flag down the waiter, have him take it back, right? Or, it would be right, if the bushy haired server didn't make a face like we're stupid. Didn't even apologize. Dude, in the food industry, I don't care if you didn't even look at the food, you apologize even if its not your fault. Unspoken rule. Period. \n\nOur waitress comes by, shows us the ticket to prove it wasn't her fault. That's cool, kinda unnecessary, but that's cool. \n\nSECOND pizza comes. Got the right toppings, YAY. Still the wrong size. Of course we have no choice but to call back the wonderful guy who served it to us, he makes an exasperated sigh (pft, like we WANTED to talk you). So we let him know it a size too small, and that we ordered a medium.\n\nWhat does he say? \"That is a medium\"\n\nWow. You work with pizza. All day. Errday. And we're having size issues?\n\nI had to check him with what his menu says, 10 slices for medium. 8 for a small.\n\nWhat statement does he counter with? \"Look man, I don't slice the pizzas, I just serve them.\"\n\nThat statement speaks for itself of how bad your restaurant sucks. I was so ready to go, but I couldn't, since my fussy child was ready to snap without some pizza. Our waitress comes back, tries to mitigate the situation, halfway through the conversation, server dude comes back with the right one, explains how he got it mixed up. Still no apology, at all, and this time it actually was his fault. Fine, whatever. \n\nYou know, with that attitude, how am I supposed to feel about what happened to the pizza in the back while you were with it...exactly, right? The readers get me.\n\nThen, our waitress decides to throw us the whole \"let me get you something comp'd\" line. Again wasn't necessary, but she offered free desserts. Cool. \n\nAfter we were done with our meal, she was nowhere to be found. What a surprise. Made an empty promise. Like the empty promise your restaurant is. \n\nNow, the main thing that reeeeeally grinded my gears was the server. Look, man, you were walking around with a nasty scowl on your face. Do you hate your job? If so, why are you still there? I don't know if this is you everyday, but going off of my experience with you, you don't belong in the restaurant biz. You suck, man. Go find a better profession, and stop making people have bad experiences there, you obviously aren't down for the cause. I say this not as a yelper, but as a human being. Go find your place in this world, a pizza shop is most def not it.\n\nAs for the restaurant in its entirety, I don't think you should care about whether or not I actually come back. What I really think you should be thinking about is how many bad reviews is it gonna take before you guys realize you suck? \n\nOh yeah the pizza was ok.\n\nI check back in a year or two from now, just to see if you guys are still around and convert on the multiple feedback.

How inexperienced I was in the ways of casual dating. And how shattered I was when I found out he was playing the same games with four other girls.\n\nBut, live and let die a horrible, horrible death. That's the expression, right?\n\nSo while I batted my lashes and tried to sensually eat my pizza and make interesting small talk, I realized just how good the food was. And now, here I am wishing I could wap myself on the head with something hard to wake up past me out of my dreamy stupor to focus on what really matters in life: Food.\n\nStarting off, we got Mozzerella Sticks ($8.50). On a date? Really Crys? Hell yes. My tummy was in the right place obviously. \n\nWe split the Greek Salad ($11.50) as well which was very fresh and honestly probably one of the best Greek's I've had. \n\nNext we had Alberto's Classico (Medium $18.50)  which was basily, tomatoey goodness, oozing with mozzerella cheese. No sauce, but you can order it if you prefer.\n\nThe decor is cute, kind of old school and funky. Not that it matters, good food is good food is good food, but it's Greek food, not Italian. Doesn't matter to me, Dino and Santino's is another favorite of mine in Pac Heights and they are of Greek descent as well. A bit pricey for pizza and salad, but I'm a cheap date and it was Noe Valley.   Looking back, all things happen for a reason. And we had a lot of lovely times together, no matter how big of a d-bag he turned out to be.", "author": "Crystal C."}

We were seated in the very back area and it took forever for someone to take our drink order or offer water. We were the only ones seated back there. It took another 10 min or so after that for the server to come back with our drinks. After we ordered, our food came out fairly fast. What I didn't appreciate was when we ordered desert. The server/busboy (short guy with nappy long hair who ties it back in a man bun) took our desert order got our order wrong. We ordered pecan pie and pumpkin cheesecake. Not that hard to remember. Instead he brought out 2 different pies. When we told him that these were the wrong pies, he gets mad and storms off saying loud enough so that we can hear \"Damn, I'm just trying to go home already!\" and continues bitching and complaining as he walks into the kitchen. Mind you, the kitchen isn't that far from where we are sitting so we heard everything. The lady who was our original server comes back to apologize but the damage was already done.

It's completely worth throwing into an order with your pizza (maybe not in large groups though, unless you're willing to get more than one order - maybe 1 order per 3 people would be good). \n\nAnd another thing: No one here on yelp mentions the ranch that they order for the restaurant.

Haystack's sausage is unique, but everything else was just average.  \n\nFlash forward to present day.  This month we've ordered from them twice and I gotta say, something's changed.  And for the better!  I'm not sure if it's the sauce or the dough.  Maybe it's the dough.  It definitely seems different.  Fluffier.  Well, whatever it is, both times we got takeout and both times I ate 3 or 4 slices when I usually limit myself to 2 max.  And it's not that I wasn't thouroughly full after 2 slices.

They're one of the only restaurants in Noe Valley open past 10:00, so it's great for a nighttime pizza emergency.", "author": "Jenny G."}

The decor and atmosphere is relaxing, yes, a bit old fashioned but very comfortable and low-key. Service was good. I like the soup and pasta but I thought it a little over priced for the side dish portions. \n\nI was told by several to order the pizza. Next time I visit, I will. I was disappointed that they do not serve pizza by the slice. And, I was disappointed that they do not serve a few Greek food dishes, like Moussaka. \n\nThe reason why I say this is because as I understand it, the restaurant is owned by a Greek family who came to SF from Greece in the early 1970's and settled in Noe Valley. The decor has some Greek themes and so I was anticipating at least one or two items on the menu to be inspired by Greek food. But no, only Italian style dishes. \n\nI was also disappointed by the house red wine. It tasted mellow, but the next morning I had such a headache, and only after one glass. That's not a good sign. I also thought it sad that Haystack charges for bread and butter. Garlic bread, I can understand, but basic bread and butter? If that's the case then why not charge for serving plain tap water? Other than, that, I really like Haystack and yes, I will return. \n\nHopefully some day soon they will serve something Greek-inspired, like Moussaka. Perhaps you can tell, that's one of my favorites.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

He leaves but I find later where he  tossed his crumpled receipt on my front steps. Very professional!\nI have been a very loyal customer since I moved to Noe Valley in the late 90's.

Had passed by this place a million times and finally this was the opportune moment. The front room was not filled, however  they seated us in the very back room. \n\n      We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was very good. Light and crispy topped with a sprinkle of parsley. Unfortunately, no spiders, just rings. Delicious though. It was not oily. We had a medium double mushroom wheat pizza. It was an easy order. Nothing complicated or high maintenance about our order. It was a slightly softer dough and a little thicker than I expected, but  not bad. In  cases like that,  I usually save my crust  for later snacking so that I can have an extra slice more. \n\n     Over all the food was satisfying, but the service was HORRIBLE !!!!!!! We had our order taken, and our food was served in a timely manner, but our waitress did not check up on us during our meal if we needed anything extra. I had to go up to the front room myself to ask for oregano which I usually sprinkle on before consuming my pizza. \n\n     Our  pizza plates were cleared after we were obviously finished which happened quicker than we were offered a refill of water, which never happen at all,  yet we still hadn't finished our calamari. My fork was still hand , and while in the process of polishing off the rest of the calamari,  our waitress came, assumed that  we were done and without asking quickly took away the plate I was working on. \n\n     Now, I was obviously speechless that  this just happened.  I mean it was only about five pieces that I was slowly working on but we just let that go. Why? Because not only were we  so stunned that it all happened so quickly, but today would have not been the time to mess with a woman who had just had worked through a tough week at work.  Deadlines and all . And  to top it off it was that time of the month and not worth starting my weekend by slaying the dragon over this minor hiccup!  \n\n     It was not as if they were so busy that they had no time to ask if we were finished even if there were just a couple pieces of calamari left. She just up and cleared the plates  so fast that it completely overshadowed the fact that we had not even been checked up on during our meal for even a refill of water or for any other request that we may have had. What's up with that? (Don't sweat the small stuff, right?\" ) AS A PAYING CUSTOMER, I HATE BEING RUSHED BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER MY MEAL !!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, but she did ask if we wanted to look at the dessert menu. The audacity !!!!! \n\n    Needless to say, we won't be coming back to this place because I can get better service elsewhere, where I can relax, have a fantastic dinner AND dessert,  and know that I'll be taken care of after a hard week's work because I deserve it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Plus I'll make sure to look at the wine list first ;  )  \n\n     Experience can sometimes be bad, but more often than not it's usually good for me. This was just one of those fluke ones. Life goes on and tomorrow, as those weird Christians are trying to proclaim that the world will end anyways, I will never have to worry about bad service again because I signed up for Nirvana!", "author": "Granolia G."}

I cannot comment on their sandwiches or pasta, for Wifey and I split a small pepperoni, sausage, olive, and onion pizza, and it was fantastic.  The service was friendly and attentive, the setting was quaint without being too over-the-top, and the price was nothing to complain about.\n\nBut what now for our hero?

Okay, this happens.  I can forgive it.  We just popped it in the oven, reheated it, and it was fine.  Two pizza's ago, we ordered it late on a Tuesday night (that happened to be my birthday), I placed the order at about 7:30, was told it would take an 45-60 minutes.  I lost track of time, my boyfriend yells down to me, \"Did the pizza get here yet?\"  and I realize it's now 8:45, and no pizza.  Hmmm.... I waited another 15 minutes and just as I was dialing Haystack to find out where the hell our pizza is, the driver knocks on the door (at 9:00 p.m.).  He handed me the pizza, and I told him to wait, I placed my hand on the bottom of the box, and lo and behold, it was cold (not even room temperature.)  I asked the driver who could I call to complain to, and the driver offered over and over that he could take it back and have a new one made.  Right, because everyone likes to eat pizza at 10 pm on a Tuesday night.  That's a certain recipe for indigestion.  No thanks.  I called and spoke to the manager (possibly owner?) who apologized profusely, and put a note in our address that our next pizza was free.  Wow, thank you!\n\nThat brings us to last night, where we ordered our final pizza EVER from Haystack.  I called, placed the order, and the guy who answered the phone asked me why we had the free pizza, and I told him, \"Because the last two we ordered were cold and/or late.\"  So, was it unreasonable for me to expect that my pizza would come piping hot this time?  That maybe, people would pay special attention to our order in an attempt to correct the past two wrongs?  Apparently, it was.  The pizza arrived in a fairly timely manner (60 minutes), and SHOCKER!  It    was      cold.       Again.  So, we're done.  I'd rather eat greasy Pizza Hut or flavorless Dominoes, or even overpriced Round Table!  At least they come hot!  Save yourself the trouble.

It was another major letdown.\n\nHaystack is so expensive it should be really good to be worth it, but I'm done paying $30 to have cold pizza delivered to me.\n\nI won't order delivery from Haystack ever again. Maybe I'll eat there if I find myself in Noe Valley some time.", "author": "Garrett O."}

It was like eating pizza mush.\n\nWe each tried to eat enough to feel like we'd gotten our moneys worth - but it was just bad.

But not Noe Valley. Nothing was opened, we were starving, and we stumbled into Haystack.\n\nI tend to judge pizza restaurants on the chicken wings they have. lets just say that they looked like they came from \"costco\" as one of my buddies put it. the ingredients seemed very fresh on the Haystack Pizza but wasn't totally impressed with the burnt crust. Good thing for the ranch dressing coming to the rescue.", "author": "Gabe H."}

Here's my favorite: pizza with pesto sauce, canadian bacon and feta cheese. It melts in your mouth. Thick soft delicious crust, lightly oily pesto sauce, lightly crispy canadian bacon. And feta cheese to make it over-the-top creamy and rich. I don't even want to know how many calories/carbs each slice has, but because the guilt of the experience overwhelms me, I always order their spinach salad too. HUGE. Lots of baby spinach, red onion slices, tomatoes, with a bit of bacon and hard-boiled egg slices. They put the dressing on the side, so nothing is soggy. The pizza/salad combo is enough to last for a few days. Perfect. \n\nI've also ordered burgers/fries from them several times, and the reason that it works so well is that they put all of the condiments on the side. You get a burger/bun, and then you have a separate side bag jammed full of lettuce, onions and tomato. And then your usual squeezie-thingies of mustard/ketchup. The burgers stay relatively warm during delivery -- although I've always lived pretty close, so the travel distance wasn't far. Their french fries are SO GOOD. Huge super-thick-cut home made fries. Lightly golden.\n\nOnce I ordered an actual Italian meal from them -- ravioli, and it was also a delicious meal. They have a good selection of non-pizza items.\n\nI know you can order online, but I've never tried that. And for all of the times I've ordered for delivery, I've only eaten inside their restaurant a couple of times. The decor (wagon wheel chic) just doesn't do it for me. But I've gone in for pick-up, and have never seen a crowd of any sort. It seems like the kind of place that you could go and get a seat at a huge booth at just about any time of the day/nite.\n\nAfter so many years of providing me with such satisfying food, I'm happy to be able to do a little something for them by singing their praises here.", "author": "Zoe H."}

We were able to get seated right away by a friendly face.  A pizza dinner out with the fiance in our new neighborhood - Noe Valley. \n\nThe place had a nice quiet buzz going on with different groups enjoying their meal and conversation.  As was expected, it did take a few for someone to take our drink and appetizer order once we put aside all the menus and looked plaintively towards the general waitress area.  All smiles when she did arrive to take our appetizer and beer order, we were still debating on the pizza toppings.\n\nIn general the staff seemed pretty attentive checking on tables, refilling drink orders and getting to go boxes for left overs.\n\nWhen the Bruchetta arrived the first thing that I noticed was pink tomatoes, then noticed very little seasoning on think slices of very garlicked bread.  The Luigi somethin' or other with sausage added was then ordered.  IMNSHO, the topping on Bruchetta should be a bit more on the red tomatoey side, diced up nice and small, marinating in olive oil with maybe a touch of garlic and salt and pepper and served on thinner, almost toast slices.  Each place has their own style I understand.  Just won't be ordering that again.\n\nA pitcher of Sierra Nevada went down nice and smooth between the two of us and then the pizza arrived.  YUM!!!  It was delivered by the next waitstaff person available, A.O.K. in my book, as that makes sure it arrives fresh and HOT!  The cheese was nice and gooey, the pesto and garlic made my mouth water and the sausage was nice and not too spicy.  The crust was crispy where it should be, on the very bottom and along the sides and just bready enough on the inside.\n\nOddly enough however, this was when the wait staff disappeared.  No one came back to make sure our pizza was all right, to see if we needed refills on beer or some water or more napkins.  No offer of coffee and dessert until we stopped a passing person to get a box for our left overs and a check.\n\nSince the pizza was good we'll most likely give delivery a try and maybe one of their other dinner offerings another time.  But if someone said choose now, Noe Valley Pizza would come first.\n\nLate nite is only Friday and Saturday until midnight, Sunday thru Thursday is 11 pm.  Wheelchair accessible would be doable but a tight fit.", "author": "Marti P."}

It was a Monday at 1pm and there were only a few couples in there eating.  We ordered pizza and a salad.  We LOVE the pizza.  The sauce is perfection.  We didn't get the thin crust (didn't even know they had it until I read the reviews); it was on the thicker side but not too thick and baked to perfection.

But the other night after going to a movie I felt like eating pizza. I did not want anything out of the ordinary... just plain old pizza that would satisfy my pizza craving. It was already 10pm om a Saturday and I was trying to think... where can i get pizza. Haystack's! So off we went to Haystack, parked right outside and were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was a very sweet and polite woman who was nothing but smiles. I ordered the #4 Zorba the Greek pizza (which I thought was expensive at about 16-17 bucks for the small) and my friend got the Italian sausage pizza. I had been to this restaurant years ago and did not remember much of it except that I had gone right after the gym and felt guilty for going there. Anyhoo... I digress... so we are sitting there waiting for our food and other folks come in. It is getting pretty busy for being after 10pm. I figured folks would be at the bar and what not. Alas... the food arrives, my pizza looked so good... it did look like a heart attack waiting to happen and there was no way in the world I could ever eat the entire thing. My friend also got her sandwich with some yummy steak cut fries. I dig in and have my first bite... WOW! It was exactly what I wanted... a hearty pizza. It was very good, granted, I only was able to eat 2 slices and left the other (more than half of the pizza) to take home and savor later on. There was constantly someone asking us how things were (an older gentleman who seemed like he may have been the owner) and he even chit chatted with us. \n\nI don't know if I was just lucky or if it just depends on who you get to help you, if people are going in with snooty attitudes and it shows, everyone was on that special time or what, the planets were just aligned right, but I seriously didn't experience anything negative while here. I mean... if you want some sort of specialty pizza.. then go to the specialty place... if you just want standard, hearty pizza... this is your place. Hey... I like gourmet like pizza myself... but if that is what you looking for... then save yourself a trip and whiny review and go elsewhere. \n\nAs for delivery mishaps... haven't ordered, but if I ever do...

My vote was Gialini's and the girls wanted Barney's.  Split the difference - Haystack.\nI ordered Zorba the Greek and the Eggplant Especiale, both shared with my friend.  The kids shared a cheeseburger and pasta with cheese and butter.\nThe salad arrived first and I scarfed it down without a care while my fellow diners waited in agony for their own food to arrive.  The garden salad is satisfying, albeit cafeteria-like, with its canned beets and beans, romaine lettuce and tomatoes.  I ordered it with oil and vinegar, since on a previous visit my friend's request for \"Italian\" resulted in a slathering of creamy goo. \nThe pizza was delivered first.  My oldest whined for her burger while the littlest sucked up whatever morsels landed in front of her.  \nI'd ordered \"Zorba the Greek,\" and expected a purist combo of feta and bacon.  What was presented was a delectable burden of sausage, salami, pepperoni, onions and peppers - in addition to the feta and bacon which I thought I'd ordered.  \nMy friend and I whispered our shock, and then decided to speak up. We'd take it, we said.  But this wasn't what we ordered.  Still, we'd happily accept this mess of meat and cheese, onions and peppers. We were starving.  And we quickly served ourselves. \nWhen the server brought my daughters' burger and noodles, we told him we  were eating someone else's pizza.   But, that we didn't care.  He said that he had brought the right thing.  And said some other garbled things that we didn't understand. \"Yeah, right!\" We winked between us.  \"Sure.\"  Positive that he was just saying weird stuff to distract us from the botched order.\nMy girls happily slurped their simple white noodles and the youngest insisted on a serving of eggplant.  Neither was impressed with the burger, which my eldest described as \"overburned.\"\nI told my friend that I was gonna check out a menu, to prove that \"Zorba the Greek\" was supposed to be only feta and bacon.  I told her that I didn't want our server to feel bad, so I snuck outside to see the menu posted out front.\nDude was right.  Of course.  Stupid me - arguing with the server over the menu;  why do I always have to be such a know-it-all?! Zorba the Greek _was_ actually the #3 combo plus bacon and feta - the \"garbled\" explanation I'd chosen to ignore. \nWe thought we'd never eat all the food we'd ordered, but all that remained of our feast was one slice of Zorba the Greek.  Which i re-heated for breakfast the next morning.\n\nUpdate 05/27 -\nOrdered pizza for delivery last night.  Waited an hour, no pizza. Called to get an update - they said they were running late, and also having trouble with my CC.  Gave them my CC again.  Another 1/2 hour - still no pizza.  This time they said the driver had attempted delivery, but nobody was home.  I'd been sitting in the livingroom the whole time, feeding the kids potato chips. \nFinally called Noe Valley Pizza, and they were open and ready for my hungry family.  \nThis morning - not only had my CC been charged for the meal -  they actually charged me twice for the undelivered pizza!!!!", "author": "Kati K."}

(that's about as much as someone with asperger's syndrome loves a cassio keyboard, fyi.)\n\nP.S. YOU CAN ORDER ONLINE FOR DELIVERY!  that's right, you can order without even interacting with another human being.

This has happened before and I was conscious to make clear that we wanted the sandwich, didn't happen. Not a big deal - bit annoying, but mistakes happen. But while they agreed to send over the right sandwich, they also called me back to demand the original dish back. Which I just don't understand, really, Maybe if it was to ensure that we weren't trying to double up on them, that's understandable - although a bit frustrating to be so doubted considering our history with the joint. But if that's not the reason, what is? Shudder to think. Anyway, since this wasn't the first error and was a really awkward experience, I've pretty much decided I'm done with the place.

OK, I said, pizza is not soggy, nothing too special. \n\nBut a few weeks later I went there for dinner in a group of six - and it was TERRIBLE! \n\nThe waitresses were both very young (underage?) and rarely came to our table, and when they did, barely heard anything we requested. The table was not really big enough for six, but they did nothing to put smaller tables together or otherwise accomodate us. The waitress who set our table (with paper mat, fork, knife and napkin) literally put a table set ON THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. Did she expect one of us to get on top of the table and eat from the center? And she put an extra set right on top of another set. I told the waitress we didn't need this set, and she just smiled and walked away, obviously not interested in anything I, her customer, was saying. \n\nI had to go to the counter to order drinks, when a waitress appeared, looking pissed off, and told me to go back to my table. I went back, thinking she was going to take our drink order, but she didn't appear for another 15 minutes at our table. After a while we managed to put in our drink and food order, but got so little attention, it was clear these waitresses were either totally untrained or didn't care at all. When they brought in the pizza which took up the entire table, they didn't bother to clear away the salad bowl or plates - so we had to start discarding them on a nearby shelf/wall ledge ourselves. I mean, really. I haven't had service this bad in a long time.\n\nI don't really understand how Haystack uses inexperienced staff during their prime hours (this was Thursday evening). I know they've been in the neighborhood for a long time. Is this the owner's way of saying: \"We don't really care what you think of us, I'm minimizing labor costs with cheap inexperienced labor that I'm doing nothing to train them, and you can just go to the pizza joint across the street, because I don't really need your business anyway.\" \n\nWell, this is one local living in the neighborhood who will not be going to this pizza restaurant anytime soon. \n\nWhat's funny is, I grew up in the neighborhood, and I remember distinctly in 1985 going there in a group, and the waitress who served us was surly and unhelpful, too.

I used to chow down here on a weekly basis when my last ladyfriend and I were finished  imbibing for the night.  We'd be hungry, buzzed,  and looking for a  late-night place to stuff our stomachs to near capacity.  Whenever we were in this mood, Haystack always fit the bill with a quiet dining area, quick and polite servers, and a humble pizza-parlor like vibe that's accented with just the right amount of tablecloth-and-napkin dignity.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm sans-date, I always order a 3-item small and walk over to pick it up. It's usually ready when I get there, but a small bar makes for a great spot to chill with a beer when I've jumped the gun and showed up early.  When I'm with the lady-friend we usually dine on-premises, splitting a small \"Old Macdonald\" pizza with a house salad while washing it down with a carafe of cheap wine.  The pizza's thicker than normal, the toppings are generous, but the crust is a bit on the chewy side.  The house wine is pretty decent, and the always-fresh Salad is one of the more rockin' deals on 24th Street. We've ordered \"Luigi the Italian\" with Pesto and Garlic, and it's been pretty good too.  The regular combination is an excellent crowd-pleaser, and those who pine for pizza from the East Coast  will appreciate the \"Native New Yorker\", a  thin-crust specialty with a tomato-basil sauce and devoid of toppings. \r\n\r\nTwo tables near the windows give a view out onto 24th Street.  If you're in a big group, large oval-shaped booths with cushy upholstery make for a great gather-around seating arrangement.  And while the front room rarely fills up, a larger area towards the back is available for overflow seating, banquets, or private parties.\r\n\r\nIf you search San Francisco far and wide, you'll undoubtedly find a better pizza.  And if you're willing to brave the drive, the line, and the wait at Zachary's or Little Star, be my guest.  In the mean time, I'll be walking through the front door of Haystack and sliding into my favorite table.  Not long thereafter, I'll have a menu in one hand, and my beverage of choice in the other...", "author": "Mike W."}
