With that said, this place has the closest to authentically \"New York style\" pizza I've had since moving to SF. \n\nThere are plenty of slice varieties are available, with grated cheese, pepper flakes and the like to dress up your slice as you wish. It can be enjoyed there (ample seating) or to go (travels well). The crust is thin but not too thin (where it's cardboard-like), the cheese and sauce come together in the right ratio, and the crust has a nice texture and bite without being overdone (or underdone and gummy). Plus, the owners and everyone I've met working there are generally nice and friendly. \n\nCash only. Slices are about $4 which I guess is the going rate for such a thing these days.", "author": "Christine G."}

While the Bay Area has many nice made-to-order personal pies, its slice game is generally lacking (except Tony's and Arinell).  I'm glad my other lunch plans fell through because this backup option was a great experience for me.  Way better than Arinell and very much like the omnipresent slices I used to get when I lived in NYC.\n\nCheese Slice: Just how a slice should be!  The bottom is so crispy and firm that, after a few bites, you don't need to fold to prevent a flop down.  The sauce layer is thin, which is true to NY style, though always a bit of a let down for me since sauce is my favorite part.  The cheese is ample and neatly intact since it's reheated to order (instead of the super stringy version the first time round).  And they have the four requisite shakers: chili flakes, parmesan cheese, oregano and garlic salt.  For $3, it's the perfect trip down NY memory lane. \n\nPepperoni Slice: Essentially the same as the cheese, but with about 5 slices of thin pepperoni.  It was tasty enough, but I would have preferred the meat to be more charred and crispy.  Probably better to save the $1 and just get a cheese slice.", "author": "Adam B."}

Only two people were working when we went in, but the order didn't take too long. One of the workers make the pizza and it looks super easy cause they end up making it in 5 minutes. The other worker takes the order, collects the money (cash only btw), and heats up the pizza to a perfect temperature in an oven!\n\nWe ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza! It was on a thin, crunchy crust. When you take a bite from the pizza, it's a mixed flavour of stringy cheese with diced up mushrooms and pepperoni all in one bite!

Their all meat one is a family favorite.  Heck, I think I tried all their house slices and can't think of anything wrong with them.\n\nCash only here so bring your bucks.  They'll heat it up for you so you get that nice crisp thin crust.  Again, simple and easy.  This is the way to go!", "author": "Maria S."}

It's thin crust and great quality overall. $3-4 per slice and the slices are nicely sized. They are amazing right out of the oven. It's the perfect amount of crust, cheese, sauce and topping. Not one thing over powers the other and every bite is well balanced. I think the crust is really what does it for me though. Its thin and crisp, but gives you just that little hint of chew that you'd like in dough. The guys are always super nice. CASH only!

The interior is minimal with just one employee and a small display of prepared slices. The prices are what you would expect, with a plain cheese slice coming in a $3. \n\nI ordered a pepperoni and mushroom slice and I was actually very pleased with how it turned out. The crust was one of the thinnest crusts I've had and it almost had a cracker type of texture to it. The sauce was very light as well which I liked.

The former is usually run by a guy named Vinnie who wears a wife-beater and talks like he's auditioning for the part of a pizza guy on \"The Sopranos\" and still couldn't get the part. I'm thinking of a place like 2 Bros Pizza in NYC where you see all walks of Lower Manhattan life get two big slices and a soda for $2.75. You eat it in the back with all the other goombahs who couldn't get a date that night (photo: http://bit.ly/1qZh2cb). But a Pizza Shop with capital letters must mean there's an unexpected designer element to the culinary creations coming out of the oven, right? Hmmm, not really. Jamie W. and I came here out of curiosity since a pizza spot is an unusual sight among the taquerias on 24th.\n\nIt's a modest operation with a large glass case with all their pizza pies on display, a large oven in the back and just four tables for sit-down eating. There were ten to choose from (photo: http://bit.ly/Qc1mHr) , and at $4 a slice, I felt entitled to two. Don't judge me. So I ordered the Pepperoni and Mushroom and the White Mushroom (photo: http://bit.ly/1kZPcPJ). Jamie must have been showing off because he ordered only one slice of the Deluxe, which featured sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, onion and olive (photo: http://bit.ly/1hJQsEc). Our verdict? It was OK. The pizza has the cracker-style crust that isn't really my preference, and the ingredients, while fresh, were rather on the bland side as if seasonings were optional. The $2 refillable sodas were helpful to wash them down. Where are my goombahs?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling on the pizza scale, not bad but honestly a bit on the Costco side when it comes to execution\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...could use a bit more oomph to liven up the place\nSERVICE - 3 stars...friendly enough\nTOTAL - 3 stars...pizza seems more directed to the hipsters than the rest of us", "author": "Ed U."}

I have been walking past it's location for several months now waiting and hoping that I would finally have a neighborhood pizza place to lean on when all the Latin food got to be too much.\n\nUpon ordering three to share the 4$ per piece prices did indeed \"slice\" at the wallet a bit. Even for SF, four bucks a slice is the top of the range for pizza that's been sitting in a case for who knows how long. I've got half a dozen examples (favorites being in Castro and the Lower Haight) of places that make custom slices on-demand for less than that. But that's the only thing I can possibly complain about.\n\nBecause this is damn good thin crust pizza that you can fold and devour like a pre-pubescent boy who has no idea he's going to gain thirty pounds in the next year. Or at least that's why I was immediately reminded of upon the end of my feast: being eleven years old in NY at the deli two blocks from my house, completely unaware that I was heading into a journey that would change me forever. \n\nPuberty made my pants tight in two ways, and I've only figured out how to stop one of them: diet and exercise. I've given up on the other one.\n\nBut pizza! It's good. They're nice. It's clean as all hell and and maybe kinda reminiscent of a meat locker without the meat given the industrial feeling greys and metal. Not a bad design in general and maybe they're still working on it, but it's different than what you'd expect from a lot of 24th street spots.

Not having to fold a slice also ranks really high when I consider what makes a delicious slice; whether this has to do with a substantial crust or my preference for avoiding obscenely large triangles of deliciousness, something about having to fold my pizza in half takes away from my overall enjoyment of eating my (current) favorite food. \n\nAt The Pizza Shop, a slice topped with my usual duo, olives & mushrooms ($4), was readily available to be heated up & served, hence the half star. Wasn't the easiest to-go slice to transport, what with being placed on a paper plate & in a bag rather than in a box & all, but I managed & was satisfied with the taste of my first bite.

I was in town for work and my neighbor (in Minneapolis) had highly recommended it, so I couldn't pass it up when I was so close. When I showed up, there was already a short line of locals waiting to pick up whole pies to go and others stopping in for a quick slice, so I knew I was in the right spot! \n\nIt's \"just\" really. good. pizza. Incredible crust if you like thin NY-style pizza! It took me right back to one of my favorite pizza places in the Big Apple. One slice isn't enough to fill you up - unless you're just looking for a snack to tie you over - which is just fine because it's so delicious and they have a wide enough variety of options that you won't want just one kind anyway!

I got the classic pepperoni and mushroom and my friend just got the mushroom pizza. I devoured it and the service was quick. I like how crispy all the bread gets when the heat it -- I know that's not for everyone but I prefer it that way. They seem to have a simple menu but I kind of like that in a small pizza shop. I also wish they were open later-- it would be awesome to stop by a place like this after a long late night out. They are new so maybe they'll expand their menu/hours as they gain popularity. One thing to take caution is that it is cash only; it's $4/slice. You can also opt for a whole pizza obviously.\n\nThe ingredients taste fresh and it's a personal plus that every product they offer is compostable (plate ware and cups, etc.) and the location is small but super clean and minimalist in ambiance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-24", "description": "Had moved to San Francisco from New York, I often shrugged when my friends would hand me a horrible slice of pizza on a paper plate. \"How dare they,\" I thought as I made my way to the crust. \"This is a disappointment, and I'm a disappointment for eating this.\" A lazy pizza was all it took to ruin a day, regardless of the beautiful and warm February bay-area weather. I'd rather freeze my apples off in New York City if that meant the possibility of warming up to a proper slice of pizza accompanied with a glass of beer. Oh man, those were the days.\n\nHowever, it was this thought that lead me to walk hangery in 24th street. My inner pizza monster had wrapped it's cheesy arms around my throat, and it was demanding I consume a slice of pizza. Turning my head like a paranoid crack addict, I stumbled upon a sign that read \"Believe in pizza again.\" It was written in chalk, and it was written in script. It was beautiful, and I took a leap of faith and walked through the entrance.\n\n\"Cheese pizza...please\" I growled. \"And a pepperoni while you're at it.\" The cashier responded with a smile, and traded my crumpled $20 bill with a crisp Hamilton and a couple of Washington's. \n\nTime on the table passed quickly and the cashier greeted me with two slices of pizza. \n\n\"Enjoy.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nI took a bite. And another bite. And then another. I couldn't believe it. My inner whiny 5-year-old kept his mouth shut. Instead, he was happy. Very very happy. After a short demolishing session, I glanced down to my paper plate and saw that there were nothing but crumbs left. Strange, I never eat the crust.\n\nI got up in a mild panic and ordered another slice, this time \"The Meat.\" It was 8PM, and I wished the day had just started. After a second demolishing session, I twirled my thumb, hoping another slice would magically appear, but I needed to save what was left in my wallet for the fare back home.\n\nMaybe it was my intense craving for a proper slice of pizza, or maybe I was sleep deprived. But I left the The Pizza Shop smiling, believing.", "author": "Ken W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-30", "description": "My friend and I came to check this place out after reading an article on seriouseats.com that dubbed this place \"The Best [Slice] In The Mission.\" Deep in the heart of the Mission, it's a little challenging to find a parking space, which may explain why so many people came into the shop with their bicycles in tow. The pizzas are all on display in a case right when you walk in, including a \"Pie of the Moment\" which I presume is their special. We ordered a slice of The Meats, the spinach ricotta, and the PotM which was a ricotta and cherry pepper pizza.\n\nThe Meats: solid if unspectacular. It's as clean a meat slice as you'll come across, not heavy on the pepperoni grease but also not overwhelming with the heavy Italian sausage flavoring that I enjoy. Also, they use a minimal amount of sauce, which I guess is a matter of personal preference.\n\nRicotta spinach: the white part of the pizza (aka most of the pizza) is a little underseasoned, but the spinach is definitely like \"HELLO you are now eating spinach!\" which I really enjoyed, because you're supposed to actually taste the toppings (unlike the nondescript spinach I've had on other pies in the past).\n\nPotM: again, another white slice but with spicy cherry peppers. Unfortunately the least memorable slice of the 3, thus giving an altogether different meaning to \"of the moment\".\n\nTheir pizza is baked with minimal char on the bottom, which is a huge plus since I hate eating pies that are burnt on the base. The base is fairly crisp with decent chew, which is nice when you're eating the thin cheese-covered parts of the pie; however, the crust is exact opposite of pliable and is very reminiscent of eating a dry cracker and therefore sadly discarded. \n\nOverall I can see why the Pizza Shop is a local favorite (bonus points for serving both root beer and Cherry Coke) and the staff is super friendly, but maybe I attribute a little more...\"grease\" to what I'm looking for in my ideal slice.", "author": "Gene C."}

The street sign in front read, \"believe in pizza again\" and, \"hot in 90 seconds.\" Thin slices of pizza that's ready quick was enticing enough to bring me in and I didn't even know that \"I stopped believing in pizza.\" The glass display case when you walk in shows about 12 different combinations of pizzas but be forewarned the pizza unheated didn't look too appealing. Not like how blondie's pizza displays their hot pizzas, but I was willing to give this new place a try especially with that sidewalk tag line. \n\nThe pizza came out hot and fast after being heated up. I took my first bite of my pepperoni mushroom slice and the pizza had a nice balance of crust to cheese topping. My favorite thing about the pizza was the crunch of the thin crust.

I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews claiming it would fill this NJ thin-crust void, and was not disappointed! No longer will I have to get pizza every time I visit the East Coast because it just doesn't exist here (well, to be fair, I think Bernal Heights Pizza does an okay job too).\n\nI got two generous-sized slices of cheese from The Pizza Shop in the early afternoon, grabbed a smoothie next door, and headed over to Precita Park to enjoy them in the sun. They were sooo good, I'm just wondering when I can go back! Service was friendly and quick, and the place wasn't crowded.\n\nI would have liked a sturdier take-out container for slices than putting them on doubled paper plates into a paper bag, but it was okay for the short distance I carried it, and I was glad that they sold slices for take-out to begin with. My only other complaint is that it looks like they don't sell any size pie other than large.", "author": "Rachel C."}

Combine a slice of artichoke and a meat-o; and you have a balanced meal, right?\n\nWishlist: They only take cash; and sometimes I walk by cause I have no bills in my wallet, only plastic.

Just perfectly greasy and extra-cheese is actually extra cheese. I'm never running again. I'm just gonna eat pies, pepperoni, extra cheese, the rest of my days. It's just perfect. I really didn't expect it to be. But then I saw the slices on the rack and I knew what it was. I ordered that pie like I've been ordering it since and there's nothing else now. I'm either eating that pizza or I'm thinking about eating that pizza, trying to convince my person 'we can just order a pie, on the way home, I'll pick it up. Have two each now, have two each later.' Every time I bite into a taco now, 'it's pretty good, but you know what would really go well with this? Like a pie from the pizza shop. Like, you put extra cheese and pepperoni on it, maybe get a soda in a glass bottle on the way home, have yourself a time.' You know, and there's a good juice place next door to, get a juice while you wait if you want to feel healthy before your scarf down a pie. Or just eat the pie. Maybe get a slice while you wait for your pie, like a trailer for the movie you're about to see. I don't know, just if you ever lived three thousand miles away, and want pizza that's like it's from there, then go here. You're not going to be sad that you did. You're going to be happy. You're gonna stop going running. You're gonna realize it's pointless and when your friends say, 'hey, why'd you stop running' you take them here, and they'll understand.

I love pizza, am from NYC so I know of what I speak, and have sampled many many SF pizza joints, some decent, most overpriced and poor, with the sweet bland marinara, rubbery dough and other affronts.  Off the top of my head, only 2 are okay - Escape from NY and Arinell on 16th and Valencia.  But Arinell is really greasy and has a mean spirited hipster sign saying not to use a cell phone in their presence (oh brother, get over yourself), and Escape has a grungy ghetto vibe, factory bedside manner and no love in their pies.  Plus I live on the 24th Street corridor in the Mission, a part of the neighborhood that's been desperately in need of a slice of pizza for a long time.  Along comes The Pizza Shop!!!!  It's the best pizza I've had since leaving NYC, incredible toppings, cheese is perfection, the crust is thin and crispy where it needs to be, very fairly priced for multiple toppings and a normal price for cheese, incredibly delicious without any frills or unnecessary bells and whistles.  Classy muted decor, great music, and overwhelmingly popular - people love this place and it's only been open a couple weeks.  I walk by every day and on Mondays, when the owner Tom takes a much deserved day off to rest (he has just one employee thus far and the place is hoppin' with really happy pizza eaters, it's heartening to see), I go \"Doh!\" because the highlight of my daily jaunt down 24th from Potrero where I live to Mission where the subway is, is a slice from the Pizza Shop.  Tom and his one employee are all smiles, defying the unnecessary penchant of merchants in the Mission to treat their customers like garbage, even if they served nothing I'd go in there for the good vibes, smooth lighting and excellent tunes.  Scratching my head to think of one negative thing to say, so the review is fair and balanced, but it's impossible - this place is pizza perfection.  When I am not there, I think about my next slice.  Someone gave it two stars because they were closed once, that malcontent needs to have his head examined.  This place is gorgeous, my taste buds are in heaven, and I had better hit the gym twice as often now that I've discovered the Pizza Shop because I can't stop going there every day (twice a day I have to admit) - if I ever have a kid I'll name him The Pizza Shop.
