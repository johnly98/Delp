Why thank you for that morning welcome.\n\nEvery day, the wonderful guy doing the espresso would smile that handsome smile of his and some days would ask if I wanted another shot and even warmed milk in my coffee gratis.

When a cafe happens to survive into adulthood, it becomes something like Peet's. And once you graduate from local chain to local mega-chain, there's no turning back.\n\nThen what happens? The baristas lose their edge and start smiling and asking customers' names. You start offering seasonal lattes and weird things called Freddos that no one really knows how to pronounce properly. You might even start selling CDs and Kind Bars. Peet's is that kind of place. It's no longer that cool, but once you throw up your first Tensa-Barrier it's game over, man. Game over.\n\nWhatever, I'm sick of talking about this. Peet's is consistent and passable coffee that you'd have to be legally blind (or a spectre) to avoid if you're anywhere in the FiDi. Don't feel embarrassed to go there, but Blue Bottle is just as ubiquitous and superior. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: For PEET'S sake, grab a cup and get outta there.\n\nMenu Readability: Corporate.

But I'd make it at home if that was all that mattered. I go to a coffee house for service, wifi, snacks and ambiance. In that order (good coffee is assumed.)\n\nThe service varies by location & day, is generally OK, but not even on the same planet as Philz. The snacks and ambiance are barely adequate (no bathroom at 3rd & Mission, no mints either, and seating is stingy.)\n\nMy biggest gripe with Peet's is the abysmal wifi. Not only do they do the nit-picky, get-a-number-from-the-cashier routine, and then make sure you know that it's only good for one hour, but the signal sucks! Nine times out of ten, I could not get online at all. One time an employee at the Laurel Village location told me I should (get up from my table and) \"go stand in the back stairwell - the signal is stronger there.\" At the 3rd & Mission location I was told on three separate occasions that they had no clue what the problem could be, \"it was working a little while ago.\"\n\nIn both cases, I walked one block to Starbucks and, even out on the sidewalk, I'm online before I open my device.

The staff do a good job of mediating who's waiting to order, and just holla out for you to step forward to get you taken care of.  Couldn't we just lose the rope?\n\nPeet's does a very good job with pastries as well, and when they don't have my preferred pastry, I'll run down the other end of the block and pick one up at Tart to Tart.

Several months ago, they started noticing that I wear ugly ties every Friday (for my intra-office ugly tie competition, of course), & asked what I thought about them having an in-store competition. Naturally, I approved whole heartedly. Before I knew what was happening, they'd spawned it into Tacky Top Tuesdays & Wacky Hat Wednesdays.\n\nI know, right? This IS the funnest coffee shop in town. Seriously, if someone were considering opening their own coffee shop, they would be wise to look to this Peet's (& joints like Mojo on Divisadero) for some tips on building neighborhood repoire.\n\nYeah, it's a chain. That part is unfortunate. The coffee is consistently solid to very good (some blends I like, some blends I do not like), but always strong enough to power me through the morning.

You'd be surprised how often I hear patrons (or tourists, or whoever) order their drinks without specifying everything they want. The Peet's crew is listening very carefully to what you say, because they have to enter it into the computer. Believe me, sometimes, you forget to say soy. I know, I am watching from my table in the back, or maybe I am behind you in line. I know. If you are ordering drip coffee, read the notes about the beans they are brewing, or ask. Coffee is like wine, it doesn't all taste the same. If you prefer a nutty, dark chocolate, smoky flavor, make sure the notes on the coffee that day don't say \"earthy, with hints of citrus\"... or better yet, order a hot chocolate and be done with it.

They are located in the ground floor of the Paramount (I knew I should have bought there) right next to the very sh!tty AG Ferrari. The store looks like most other Peet's, meaning lots of wood, granite, African prints, and generally dark colors throughout. That also means its small on tables (I counted four inside and two or three outside).

The \"Extra Bold\" is apparently the old school Cafe Freddo, with an actual shot of espresso. As it should be, I might add. I ordered the \"Extra Bold\" and it basically tasted as it should. A strong coffee taste, not too sweet. In short, nothing like a Frappucino. But the fact that Peet's has resorted to pulling the espresso from their standard Cafe Freddo is great cause for alarm.
