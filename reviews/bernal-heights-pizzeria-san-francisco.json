{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-07", "description": "Ok... (deep breath) I custom ordered an XL pizza for delivery which ended up being $50, fine. The pizza is delicious, there's no arguing that which is why I've ordered from them before. Here's the issue: a $50 pizza comes without crushed red pepper, parmesan cheese, napkins, or plates; just the pizza. I called the place immediately to voice my concern, but didn't seem to get anywhere with the woman I spoke to. She made zero effort to try and rectify the situation, showed no sympathy, blamed me for not requesting any crushed bell peppers or parmesan cheese, and then said \"our customers know the pizza doesn't come with any of that.\" I politely asked to speak with a manager to which she responded \"I am the manager.\" This isn't the first time I've had someone from there argue with me. Last time, I tried to point out to the person on the phone that their online ordering system gives a different price than the price over the phone to which they responded \"hm, that's weird.\" The time before that I had to explain to them that an American Express card has a four-digit code, not three because the gentleman I spoke with on the phone kept insisting I was giving him the wrong security code for my card. Customer service goes a long way, regardless of how good a product may be. Don't plan on ordering from here ever again, which is a shame because it is good pizza.", "author": "Mo S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "Finally, a delicious, reasonably priced pizzeria in San Francisco!  A buddy and I stumbled upon this place late Friday night, and I'm happy to say this small pizzeria earned FIVE STARS on all levels!\nBased on the reviews I've read, I think this place must have made some positive changes recently because we were seriously blown away by the food, service and the overall atmosphere of this restaurant.  Marco was our server and also worked at the counter/register.  You know a server is outstanding, when he is upbeat, positive and smiling at the end of a late Friday night work shift!  This nice gentleman really knew the menu, and made some outstanding suggestions.  We ordered the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer and were very impressed!  Perfectly baked, with quality ingredients (not low grade, rubbery cheese and that oily imitation melted butter stuff other pizzeria's use).  This cheesy garlic bread melted in my mouth!  For our pizza order, we decided to go with monster slices.  I couldn't believe it, these monster slices start at only $3.50 (toppings and premium combinations are a bit extra).  Our monster slices arrived promptly, and they actually consisted of THREE regular pizza slices in one huge slice (they even slice it in three sections for you, so it is easier to eat).  I found the monster slice to be the perfect size, for one person as I usually only eat two or three regular slices of pizza at a time.  The pizza was baked to perfection, with a mouth watering, \"buttery\" crust, perfectly seasoned pizza sauce and a fresh combination of premium cheeses that really sets this establishment apart from the competition!  \nWe also appreciated the friendly SF \"neighborhood\" vibe in the dining area.  It wasn't too crowded or loud, and had a very warm, inviting atmosphere.  I can't tell you how many times I've visited North Beach pizza places here in SF that leave their doors wide open, so you freeze, dining under harsh florescent lighting among shouting customers and pan handlers begging at your table.  We were so happy to find such an amazing and delicious alternative!", "author": "R.J. S."}

TWO HOURS LATER I finally called to ask what was going on and the woman on the phone yelled at me and insisted it had already been delivered (WRONG!). Finally she figured out that it had been forgotten in the kitchen. She then promised me it was going to be delivered within 10 minutes. ONE HOUR LATER still nothing had showed up. I called again, no answer. Finally I had to call GrubHub to get a refund (they were horrified) three hours after I placed the order.\n\nI ended up having to make dinner for my daughter which defeated the entire purpose of having a pizza night. I'm literally 40 weeks pregnant and exhausted and this place really screwed up my evening of not having to cook and wasted three hours of my life keeping me waiting. My daughter ended up going to bed late because I kept promising her the pizza was coming and finally had to make her something else.\n\nNo apologies, refunds or anything were offered by the restaurant.

Sometimes mediums can be small, but not here, their medium is a nice size! It was so delicious!!! Very thin crust which we like, the sausage was delicious and looked homemade, not like some sausage that looks like rabbit pellets. My daughter and I both loved it! My husband said his was good too. He also had a glass of Cabernet and it was a nice full glass. Martin asked him if he would like a piece of Tiramisu for dessert. He said no thanks but Martin explained it was the last piece and it would just get thrown out, so he said it's free. My husband decided to try it, he said it was really good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-03", "description": "Let's make one thing clear: this review is about places that deliver pizza to us in the upper Noe, Diamond Heights, and Glenn Park areas. And, while I hate to say it, there is  a BIG difference between dine-in pizza and delivery (and take-out for that matter): seldom can one find one place that services both or all three needs. The reasons for this anomaly are too innumerable to go into in this post but check with your local New Yorker should you wish to dive into this philosophical topic further. In addition, while there is myriad of topping choices for all pizza options, this review and star rating is specific to the plain cheese and tomato, NY style pizza. Everyone makes one and it is the easiest to compare across multiple places and dining options. I didn't include Domino's, Pizza Hut or other national chain options because my taste buds and conscience wouldn't allow it.\n\nNow that we have set the ground rules for this review, let's get to it. Quite frankly the choices available to us in this small and very under-served delivery area are more limited than most other areas. And, while we have not tried every option, we have had our share of the local choices: NY Pizza to Die For, Haystack, Buffalo (West Portal), and Patxi's pizza just to name a few. While this is not an exhaustive list of choices or places we have tried, what is clear that the current favorite is Bernal Heights Thin Crust NY Style Pizza. (NOTE: this crust option needs to be distinguished from their three sizes: super thin, thin and thick). \n\nThis standard bearing pie is in perfect balance--crust to sauce to cheese to seasonings. The crust is chewy with a certain crispness and is never soggy towards the center (your first sign that you are dealing with amateurs). The sauce is a quality tomato sauce--not too sweet or too much and just the right amount of oregano and other fine Italian spices. The mozzarella cheese is also high quality, reminiscent of a good Brooklyn pizza joint and is not in such an abundant quality to create \"cheese coagulitis\" (rare condition discovered by Dr. DB when mixing over-cheesy pizza with cold beer). While I can not persoanlly vouch for this, I am told that the toppings should you choose to despoil a perfect pie, are all fresh and high quality. \n\nAre there better pies in the area? Sure. There are competitive dine-in and take-out options all over this city. And the choices are getting better. For example, PI offers a very good NY style option and you need look no farther than my other reviews to check out brick oven choices that are great and getting better every year (Gialinia, Tony's, Zero Zero, Delfina, etc..) \n\nHere's what makes Bernal Hts Pizza a great option for delivery. They are by far the tastiest of the local choices, the pie shows up hot every time, the delivery time quoted on the phone is accurate and the other choices available (pastas) are also really good for those relatives that think pizza is uncouth and/or a kid's food. \n\nWhile the king of local delivery pizza may change for us, today's winner is Bernal Heights. Take a bow!\n\nNOTE: Amici's could have been a contender except for their arcane delivery map that allows for their pizzas to be delivered to the corner of our street but not down the street to our house. I have tried on multiple occasions to get these guys to realize how much business they are missing out on. Oh well.", "author": "Peter O."}

It was double-wrapped in aluminum foil grilled with the cheeses melting perfectly. I added the lettuce, onions and tomato to make a huge handful of a sandwich. Also, the garlic fries are the thick cut potatoes and tasted better than those at ATT Park (they weren't swimming in olive oil). I'm very happy with my order and my choice.", "author": "Adrienne K."}

This was theeee worst food I have ever had in my life. No joke !! The reviews are old and/or Bernal is filled with stoners who will eat anything. We had it delivered, but I had to call to have them pick up half of our order because it was terrible.  The pizza was light on toppings and soggy. The fettuccini fruita de mare was missing prawns and baby shrimp, and was dry. There was also a big chunck if fake crab...yuck !! The chicken cacciatore was inedible...dry, tasteless and the chicken was shredded to the point of looking like tuna fish. It was also not cheap, $60 for all this waste of food. Pretty much ruined the night. They should be ashamed. Looks like a four year old was cooking the food. We ended up getting credit on the pasta and chicken dish, but what a hassle.

An hour and a half later, we called to find out where our pizza was. \n\nIt took no less than 5 phone calls (including being hung up on once) to determine that they could not, in fact, confirm that our order went through.

One item we ordered was the chicken parmesan. First, we requested spaghetti in place of penne. That did not happen and it really should not have been that hard. Second, the chicken was so thick and tough, it needs to be pounded. Third, the entire dish was tasteless. Tasteless breading, cheese, sauce and you can tell the chicken itself was never seasoned before it was breaded. The penne was so over done, it was gross and steamed vegetables on the side? Come on, what is this 1984? This meal was way too expensive for what it was. On top of that all, I went to the website to submit these comments instead of posting to yelp, and their contact web form does not work. Lastly, logging into Yelp and seeing their alert that this place's recent health inspection score was in the bottom 5% and was \"poor\" has convinced me that we will not be returning soon.

The crust is OK, a little bread-y for my taste, but nonetheless OK. The toppings are another story. We ordered a cheese pizza and built our own combo with six toppings. For a large pizza, they charge $1.75 per topping. Fair enough. The problem was that the toppings were too few and far between with huge empty spots on each slice. Only three pieces had broccoli on them for a total of six miniscule (and I mean miniscule) florets, and the other toppings were really stingy as well. I'm not one to quibble over price, but seriously, whatever amount they decide to charge for a topping, there should be enough of it to be noticeable.

I order from this place way too much, because the quality is just great and beats any other pizza place that delivers to Glen Park. Their pizzas are thin crust and have just the right amount of grease and flavor. They are surprisingly good quality for a place that delivers and the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is to die for (Although, your stomach probably won't be happy with you the next morning). I have had a bunch of different pizzas that they serve and I haven't been disappointed once. Their delivery is always quick and never later than the time they quote, which is great. For delivery in Glen Park/Diamond Heights, it doesn't get better than Bernal Heights Pizzaria (and yes, I have literally tried every pizza place on grubhub that delivers here. Sadly).
