Let me clarify... there's nothing wrong with the person. They're attractive, friendly, etc. - but somehow you just don't gel. The chemistry is simply not there. That's kind of how I feel about Churchill.\n\nI've been here a couple of times now for happy hour. Since it was earlier in the evening, the place was kind of quiet. It was just me, the bartender, and a few regulars. Pedestrians walking by must have assumed I was a bar fly.\n\nThe first time I came in, I ordered a $6 drink. I handed the bartender a $10, and he never came back with any change. In retrospect, I should've asked for my change. But then again, I didn't want to come across as cheap. But still... a $4 tip for a $6 beverage seems a bit outrageous.\n\nThe second time I came in, I had a similarly bizarre experience. I saddled up at the bar, and the first thing the bartender said to me was that they didn't have any beers on tap because something or another wasn't working. Um... ok. No biggie. Besides, I don't drink beer anyway. So I went ahead and ordered a Fernet Branca. The bartender then asked if I had tried this new version of Fernet that had just hit the market. I said I was game, and he poured me a shot. The drink was fine. But for $8 a pop, it wasn't exactly happy hour pricing. Since I didn't want to repeat the tipping snafu of my previous experience, I handed the guy my credit card. The bartender gladly accepted it and then as I started sipping my drink, he revealed to me that there was a $20 credit card minimum. Um... excuse me? This info would've been really helpful a few minutes earlier (before I had placed my drink order.) So what started out as a quick happy hour, suddenly turned in to a $20 tab. \n\nAs I mentioned before, Churchill is a perfectly decent bar to grab a beverage. But there's just something about my two interactions here that have rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it was just me. Maybe I'm too picky. In any case, I wish them the best of luck.

However, I'm very glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.\n\nChurchill is a military themed bar with decor and drink names that echo a World War 2 vibe.  There's big couches for lounging, but the extremely dim lighting kind of fought against our ability to chill and carry a conversation.  I was very impressed by the attention to detail in everything I came across and I recognizing the lighting was more of a personal problem since no one else seemed to mind.\n\nDrinks: We both ordered the Marshall plan.  This cocktail, from their suggested cocktails list, is a mix of Mt. Gay rum, pumpkin-apple cider, ginger beer, and lemon.  For ten dollars this cocktail is well-priced given it's quality ingredients (and it's strength, one was enough get a small buzz going).  I was impressed by the taste, although in comparison to the other cocktails I've seen on yelp and from other customers I was slightly underwhelmed by the presentation.\n\nAs far as service goes there seemed to only be one staff member, the bartender.  Although there was only about eight of us in the bar she seemed in a sort of rush and every time we managed to get her attention she acted like she didn't really have time to talk to us.

I'm just not a fan of this. The lip of the jar is so thick, and the grooves make for a bit of a messy sipping experience.

Love the wide range of beers on tap and prices weren't that bad. $5 for Ranger IPA served in a mason jar - again the Bloodhound similarities. \n\nAll in all it's a decent bar in the neighborhood that can be a good alternative to Blackbird when it gets too crowded.

It rocks a cold aesthetic that says \"designed to keep you drinking and then get you to leave\".  What I mean is it's pretty hard to love but nice to enjoy.  It's not very comfortable, gets relatively packed, and isn't really dive bar-esque.\n\nThe giant American flag inside makes me uncomfortable because I'm not having a drink to celebrate america... That much is for sure.  What they lack in aesthetics they make up for with killer mezcal cocktails and a bartender who has served me a full shot of angostura on the house before, just to try it.\n\nAt this point in my review the dedicated reader of my prose might recognize that this review is a bit scattered, and indeed this is a reflection on Churchill itself.  I love their mezcal cocktail, have played a fair amount on their pool table, don't mind their gimmicks, and yet I seem to bring friends here and half enjoy it and the other half find every part of Churchill repulsive.  For those who are cynics, the aesthetics, the mason jars, they all wreak of something too commercial and unwholesome.  For myself this place holds a special place in my heart because everything I just described is distinctly Churchill and nowhere else, which leaves it's seeds planted in your memory.", "author": "Alex H."}

It can get crowded: arrive early, or go on a weekday, and you'll have no wait. Later on you will have to hover to find a table or couch or seat at the bar. This place has TVs to watch the game, as well as a pool table in the back. My favorite part of the decor is the ropes hanging from the ceiling. It all recalls a 1940s vibe (as proudly stated on their website) - and I would agree. That era is one of my favorites in history, so I admit it may contribute to my fond feelings.\n\nOf course they have draft and bottled beer, and a few \"we better have some wine\" selections. But - let's be real - it's the cocktails that really propel this place towards the top of my go-to drinking establishments near my 'hood list. You can order a standard G&T, but why don't you let the bartenders work their magic and give you something a little more interesting. The classics are a must here.

There is also a pool table in the back for free, but there is typically a long waiting list. \n\nI only tried a few sips of the drinks, and they tasted pretty strong. Although not a fan of over-powering alcohol, hey, at least you are getting your money's worth right?\n\nFrom what I understand, parking around the area is a bit tough, since it tends to be packed here, and since it's, of course, all street parking. \n\nOverall, it was a great bar if you are a fan of the dim lights/swanky decor vibe.

Not only do you want to reduce the chance of having an unwanted close encounter with a bear, raccoon or field mouse. But you'll also want to be mindful of keeping your food supply safe using the pulley system to hoist it to an untouchable height.\n\nFirst: load all food, and anything else with strong odors (i.e. lip balm, hand lotion, cologne, snacks etc...), in a separate pack, barrel pack, waterproof bag (an over sized re-sealable zip block bag should work perfectly). \n\nSecond: rope it up over an outstretched limb or between two trees with one small metal pulley (found at any hardware store). Throw the pulley rope over the branch, with the other rope being passed through the pulley. Then tie the other end of the pulley rope to a tree and hoisting up the heavy pack with the other rope. The pulley also adds as a good weight on the end of the rope while tossing the rope over a single limb or over the rope. Remember to use a thick strip of fluorescent duck tape to mark your rope so that when you go to retrieve your goods, it will be easy to find.\n\nTip: Make sure to set up the bear rope early in the evening so you just have to go and pull the food pack up before bed. There's nothing worse than looking for a proper tree to hang your food in when it's pitch dark, other than being mauled to death (unless that is a personal goal for the night).", "author": "Ty T."}

Churchill serves a variety of mules (the Moscow mule was to die for) and the bar tenders are super knowledgeable and even created an amazing drink at my friends and my request. I wish I knew his name because it blew us away but basically we asked for a not-too-sugary tequila drink. It tasted like cucumber goodness with tequila. We all loved it.\n\nI was also SERIOUSLY thrilled about the beer list. Living in San Diego for the past six years, I've been kind of bummed about the beer lists at some of the bars in the Bay Area.

The bar has an extensive liquor collection lining the wall, that I was like a dear in headlights.

Both were excellent.  \n\nBut the true cocktail of the evening was the one that I asked Anthony to make. I asked him to make a drink that he would drink. After asking the type of preference of the cocktail, he performed his magic. Whiskey, bitters, vermouth, and a herb liquor were all mixed together and out came the best cocktail of the night which we named \"The Afterhour\".

There's not an overabundance of places to sit, but if you get some of the nice couches or chairs, you get a very comfortable corner spot from which to people watch. I also loved the open design with the large windows that open out onto the corner of Church and Market. Another design element I liked were the bathrooms. It's always nice to walk into a bathroom where you feel like it wasn't just an afterthought. The pool table in the back seemed like a nice area to hang out. There weren't too many people crowded around it, so I'm not sure what the wait is like. \n\nOh yeah, and one of the bartenders was dressed in an air force flightsuit?

Churchill feels like a keeper as it's a great bar that is mostly chill and handles just about all of your needs.\n\nGood things about Churchill abound.  Despite the crowds that have been here, the bartenders are able to just plow through the masses without seeming like they're rushing.  I've done everything from getting a drink with a friend to attending a goodbye party and though at first ominous, the space always seems to work out.  The cocktails are solid and as far as the prices go, it really isn't bad, especially when it comes to their beer.  You'd think a place like this would have $7 taps but you can get great local craft stuff for a $5 a glass.  The selection is also impressive, being a mix of random though you can usually count on a good Belgian, a decent IPA, something from Drake's and (in a delightful twist) a sour beer of some ilk is typically available.\n\nI'll always be a dive bar type of guy but if you're inviting, I'm hard pressed to think of reasons not to go here for a drink.", "author": "Steven R."}

I generally like it. There's no sign of 'flee market' anywhere you look, and a wizard bong would be totally out of place. \n\nI'm not into those ropes, but the whole bar is a solid example of the design theme that's becoming ubiquitous in modern San Francisco...where I guess the goal is to be somewhere between the Gold Rush and a SOMA loft...not so steampunk as to actually be steampunk but definitely steampunk friendly...\n\nThere is a nice pool table that takes dollar bills! Respect. But the table is not in the best spot. It's so close to the east wall you practically can't shoot from that side (on opening day they had no short sticks), and an awkward end table of sorts at the southwest corner of the table makes shooting from there difficult but not impossible... \n\nSo what is REALLY wrong with it? So far the drinks seem to suck and I hate the bar set up. \n\nThis group of bar builders seems really into dispensing with the transactional nature of drinking. That's the most favorable interpretation I can give to lining every inch of the bar in stools and abandoning the little black mat you line up at. \n\nYeah...turns out standing awkwardly behind sitting, conversing people...not knowing when if ever you'll be served...yelling your order over other people's heads...stretching your arm through their conversation to pay and collect your drink....none of these things make for a better drinking experience. Black mats and lines, please!  \n\nAnd I've had three of their menu drinks. So I think I'm up on it.  \n\nThe Churchill 75 is named after the bar. I feel invited to judge them on it, but that should not be how they want to be judged. It's drinkable but completely forgettable. I actually remember my first ever French 75 because it was surprising, complicated and also ingeniously simple.  The Churchill 75 is none of those things.  \n\nOther drinks: \n\nThe Dos Agaves Margarita is drinkable, but it's not an improvement on the margarita so it should be cut.  I don't think mezcal is a great margarita liquor.  And while it's novel to make a margarita with tequila AND mezcal, if I taste it and it's not a good idea the novelty isn't valuable. It's annoying. \n\nAnd the Home Front is actually DISGUSTING! The best description I can give it is rancidly alcoholic chicken soup, and if that sounds remotely good to you then don't take bar advice from me.\n\nOn the optimistic side. Blackbird's first drink menu totally sucked too and look at what they are doing now.  I'd really like to give this place 5 stars a year from now, and if they fix their bar setup and their cocktail menu gets as good as their beer menu that's all very possible.", "author": "Luke M."}

Scott), when you take in the vintage lamps, heavy duty nautical rope (look up) and semi-camo walls that help make up their bar zone.

Don't get me wrong - he was totally good looking, and I'm sure had a delightful personality when he wasn't \"playing the field,\" but it was so not-SF, so overt, and while I was in the loo, he even said to my girlfriend \"hook me up with your friend.\" To quote Alicia Silverstone, \"As If!\".

I will reluctantly admit that I think I tried about 5 of them the first time I was there and have since at least tasted most of the other custom cocktails on the menu.  You really cannot go wrong.... I will recommend to NOT get the margarita - don't get me wrong, it's good but there are so many other delicious things on the menu.... try something else first! The bartenders are really friendly and willing to talk to you about the drinks they're making - good people to chat with while you're waiting.

Churchill is targeting a decidedly Blackbird crowd, following several years of non-Blackbirders at this location. The space, upgraded with new couches and lounge chairs, is still awkward at best. The large open space near the door needs a bust of Churchill or a Union Jack to create energy there. The seating proved ill-advised for our party to communicate easily.\n\nOn the plus side, the windows let in evening light to break open what was a cavernous, seedy space, though I suspect this venue will be more of a night spot. The flickering lamps provide a warm glow beckoning to passersby on the 22-Fillmore or J-Church. The beer menu is excellent: the San Leandro-based Drake's dry stout is worth the $4 at happy hour.\n\nThe crowd was mixed, with quite a few groups of ladies on the official opening night.

There are lots of seats but never quite enough for the press of folks crowding in.\n\nAs for drinks - I guess cocktails are always expensive (and exotic whisky and/or whiskey cocktails more so?) but the service at the bar was prompt, pleasant and expert.  I was offered a couple of tasters of some American whiskeys before making my choice - now THAT is a rarity these days and I liked it. (I ended up drinking a Rye from Idaho!)

I really wanted to like the place but I left with an only so-so taste in my mouth.\nNice that they take credit cards (Why the hell are most SF bars cash only??)\nNOT nice that they have a $20 minimum when using one. Oy. \nThe one guy bartender was fast and efficient, but when I went up to get another drink the younger bartender ignored me, as I stood there for like 10 minutes, then when some tall chick came up way after me, he took her order. WTF?? I f'in HATE that sh*t-- learn how to frickin' scan the room and see who came FIRST. Grrr. So I went to the other end of the bar and had the gal bartender make my drink. I have bartended and I am well aware that it is important to (even when making drinks) address someone who walks up and is waiting to place an order. It's called multitasking and (hint hint- gets you better tips because people notice good service!!)\nShe was not apparently capable of this, BUT she was courteous and fast once she took my order, and I appreciate the fact that she didn't IGNORE me. Drinks are pretty good- they just need to do some training for the workers in being aware/multitasking.", "author": "Tom T."}

The bartenders here are full of attitude and sure made it clear that they hate their job and wish that they were somewhere else. I will never come back here again, because the service, or lack thereof, was so unbelievably horrible!\n\nTo the managers and supervisors, please review your staff. They are unwelcoming to people visiting town (very click-ish), resentful of customers that arrive around midnight, and simply are not hospitable. Meanwhile, they have uncontrollably bad attitude and need to learn to know when to put a cork on it, because my bartender had a very bad mouth. Also, if you have a problem with shrinkage, the same bartender who \"helped\" me is at least one source as well as the girl with red hair and tattoos all over her body... just a tip.\n\nI came here last night, a little after midnight, to discover an almost empty bar with bartenders angry about more customers walking in for a drink. Excuse me, but you are open until 2 - so sorry I didn't get there earlier to convienience you.... it's not my problem that this is your job. The barmaid with tattoos and red hair gave us the most unpleasant service and resented our order and questions about the bar's drinks. In her mind, she was off the clock and ready to go home. Then the worst came afterwards when another bartender with the absolutely WORST ATTITUDE came to make the experience a memorable one. I forgot his name but he was short, stalky, had short black hair, a mustache, facial stubble, white skin, and very a round face. He attempted to argue with me about alcohol and where I come from, as if he knew better than me, and his his haughty arrogance was enough to make me write this review.

They serve drinks in mason jars which coming from living in Santa Cruz for 6 years it was a real treat. The interior was pretty cool too! Lots of dark colors and cool lighting. The bar has ropes above that hang down like ceiling drapes. The drinks were fairly strong as I recall as well which although they were not cheap they weren't crazy expensive either and they were good. I wouldn't recommend grey hounds just from what I ordered but it could well have been a fluke.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-09", "description": "I'm told this bar has only been open for a week... but it felt like it was already a local hotspot (in the best of ways!). Woody, rustic, homey, dive-bar-esque, crowded but fairly spacious, with lots of seating options (thank you!!!) and a pool table in the back. It's like Rickhouse, but less dark and less snooty.  \n\nTruth be told, however, I was pretty disappointed by the drinks, hence one star off... the wine tasted stale, the beer (the only amber they had) was biting in a decidedly abnormal way, and our friend's Whiskey Sour was more sour than whiskey. But hey, I'm willing to put that in the past as a one-time bad luck thing and would definitely be up for giving it a second shot. \n\nThe second star off is for loudness (*this is me being picky*): the acoustics of the venue must be way off because it was unbearably loud at 1030pm on a bloody Wednesday evening. I don't know how it happened, but at one point I literally couldn't hear the person screaming in my ear next to me. Sure, there was a considerable crowd, but it wasn't remotely over-run or to the point of justifying such deafening noise levels. Not that it's particularly the owners' fault or even something that can be fixed.... it was just uncomfortable! \n\nChurchill doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table and, consequently, doesn't entirely add much to the already happening Castro night scene but, overall, it is a fun and unassuming bar that is worth checking out if you haven't yet. I was not surprised to learn that the people who opened Churchill are veterans, because one week into the game, this bar already feels like it belongs.", "author": "G. J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-18", "description": "Ok, this is funny timing... I was just reminded of this bar today after disagreeing with a commenter on a Mission Mission blog that you will always receive good treatment from a bartender if you present the right etiquette and aren't a cheapskate tipper, etc... and the first review I see here insists that every single bartender at Churchill provides excellent customer service. \n\nI'm sorry to say that I have to disagree (I guess I should leave alone the sheer irony of leaving a Yelp review that claims all Yelp reviews are absolute crap written by complete morons, yes?? Hmmmm). Granted I have only been to Churchill once and only interacted with one bartender, but unless he has left the bar in the last few months or was just having an incredibly off night, I can say with complete certainty that there is at least one bartender at Churchill who does not fit the glowing description in the previous review. And to be honest he kind of ruined this bar for me.\n\nThis was my experience a few months ago when I went to meet some friends at Churchil:\n\n1) Walk up to bar, adopt universal physical cues that I would like to order a drink (eye contact, lean forward, cash in hand), am entirely ignored by the bartender right in front of me who is too busy schoomzing and/or flirting with the dude next to me (who was not ordering) to help me. \n\n2) When bartender finally takes my order he sets it down and makes change without even the briefest of glances in my direction as he is still enthralled in conversation with my neighbor (see: rude).\n\n3) When finished with first drink, order two vodka sodas (one for myself and one for my friend). Bartender's \"friend\" turns and asks, \"Did you REALLY just order a vodka soda??\" (Oh, I'M SORRY, HOW RUDE OF ME)\n\n4) Receive only one vodka soda. Wait another 5-10 minutes at the bar for the other, cash displayed in hand, certain it must be coming...right...no? Bartender fails to either produce another drink or take the money for the first (or even look in my direction again).\n\n5) I finally decide that a drink in the hand is better than two behind the bar since this bartender is clearly never going to bother to serve me, share the drink with my friend and get half of a vodka soda for free before leaving (hey, sometimes you just have to make the best of a situation).\n\nHere's the thing: I've been to bars before when they're busy. I get it. There are few bartenders and many patrons. I understand having to wait my turn to get a drink when there are lots of people ordering drinks, especially if it's a place that specializes in those fancy-pants artisan cocktails and whatnot (YES, I UNDERSTAND BASIC LOGIC, THANK YOU). But... it was not that busy. This bartender wasn't running around making drinks or taking orders. He was seriously just standing there a few feet away from me shooting the breeze with someone. That's rude and that is terrible customer service. \n\nAnd while I can't really hold the bartender's chat buddy's snarky comments on my drink choice against him (I couldn't help but assume he was thinking the same thing though...hmm) it just added to the pretentious atmosphere I was starting to feel exuding from the establishment. I mean, for the love of god, I like a hoity-toity gin cocktail with 4 types of liquor I've never heard of and rare wildflowers picked from the southern edge of the Himalayas as much as the next person but sometimes a girl just wants to keep it simple and drink a freaking vodka soda, man!!! And I for one would like to be able to order one without the bartender acting like I'm wasting his time and putting him out terribly. I mean, if you're going to be snobby about drink orders at least be witty about it like Bourbon & Branch and advertise freely that you'll get the boot for ordering a Cosmo (no I don't know for sure if it's true, I don't drink Cosmos...duh).\n\nBecause I don't feel right basing my ENTIRE review on the bad taste (not literally, since I did at least get two thirds of the vodka sodas I ordered) a sole bartender left in my mouth, I'm giving one star for decor and aesthetics, one for an interesting, tasty-sounding drink menu, and one for general potential. Although to be honest, if I'm in the neighborhood again I'm far more likely to just go around the corner to Blackbird instead.", "author": "Aimee M."}

It's been through so many turnovers. I'm happy to say that the drink selection is great. I really like the layout of the place. The interior and exterior are done up really nicely. It's feels like a very mixed crowd too. The bar is the best place to sit cause it's nice to watch the bartenders make all the drinks.", "author": "Mei F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-18", "description": "Last Friday after work, I needed some \"therapy\"...luckily, a friend answered the call and suggested we meet at Churchill for some drinks. He told me that it was a newly opened bar and as soon as we walked in, I immediately liked the decor and vibe at Churchill. However, it was really busy so it was a bit of a wait for us to get our drinks but I know how it is based on being a bartender myself before. I would definitely come back here again!", "author": "Barbra C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "The lame bartenders and weak drinks ruin the cool vibe and great location of Churchill. The bartenders obviously have no clue they are there for their customers. While its not hard to get a drink, the staff make you wish you had to wait a little longer. They're full of attitude and not very helpful. And my expectations are typically pretty low when it comes to bars. The crowd, however, is a great mix of gay and straight...and I love the ceiling.", "author": "Eric M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-17", "description": "This place has potential.. stopped in for a quick drink yesterday and (predictably) the place was swarming with people (and hipsters) since it's brand new.  I recommend the Brooklyn, their version of a Manhattan.  While I'm getting tired of paying $9 for a specialty cocktail, it packed quite the punch.", "author": "Toby C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-08", "description": "I like Sazeracs. They're as old fashioned as the Old Fashioned, but heaven forbid you ask some bartenders for one. They won't know what it is or might need a reminder or need step by step instructions. Here you can ask for one with the confidence that they'll know what it is and make it a good one. Accessible by public transit and in a fairly central area. Not a gay bar but it's close to some if you want to barhop into the Castro.", "author": "Diana O."}

After asking the bartender to sweeten it up, it still tasted bad so I had an old fashioned which was good. This is a place that would be fun to come with a  big group because it is so open. Probably won't come back here because the drinks were disappointing but the barstaff was really nice at least!", "author": "Rachel S."}

I even witnessed a young drunk 20 something take a hit of some bum's something and she said, \"No big deal right?\" This would be a failure of her friends not watching her.

They even took back the cocktail I couldn't drink and swapped it out for another one (which was MUCH better).  The decor is lovely, the crowd isn't very scene-y at all, the bathrooms are GREAT! Biggest drawback - it's LOUD. Really loud. I mean REALLY loud.", "author": "EE C."}

From the decor to the classic cocktails, this bar lives up to its buzz. Looked like a lot of the patrons were sipping affordable draft beer from mason jars, but since I'm a big fan of 1940s-era-inspired cocktails I decided to order the Monte Carlo ($9). Let's just say I'll be returning soon to sample the other offerings.", "author": "Nancy P."}

So yeah, the overdone mason jars are cute, and it's a good location, but the staff need to GET OVER THEMSELVES!", "author": "Pui Lum W."}

He  doesn't even know what Fernet Branca is....and then he tries to charge a DOUCHE TAX about it!  I came here for the specific purpose of taking a Frenet shot to celebrate a great occasion.  And he said they didn't have it.  Conveniently it appeared behind his head less than 2 minutes later, and we had already disheartedly ordered beers instead.  So when we see it, we ask to switch out our beers for his mistake and do that Frenet shot we came there for...guess what?  Douche tax!  upcharge if we want to switch out for his mistake.  Anthony, learn your drinks.  And learn how to deal with customers!", "author": "Rockin' D."}
