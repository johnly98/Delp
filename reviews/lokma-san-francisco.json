I myself make pancakes at home and I have experienced uttered failure as well as amazing success. So when i had the Greek yogurt pancakes at Lokma, I knew i was in for a treat. It was not just the fluffiness or the crispy edges, the gentle sweetness of the fragrant blueberry compost, or the rich creaminess with mild tanginess of the Greek yogurt, but also the crackling sound of the granola in your mouth that make the whole thing tastes like a good Sunday morning. \n\nMy friend had the Sunrise combo which includes small version of the pancakes, scrambled eggs and sujuk, a spiced sausage that is very mealy and deliciously tangy.\n\nTheir AndyTown coffee was average I would say. And its temperature was a bit low for my liking. After adding the half and half it was just lukewarm. \n\nTheir interior is modern and airy, but just a bit dark for my taste. \n\nThe server we had was nice and attentive.\n\nI feel that Lokma is worth a return, as I would like to try their Turkish breakfast set for 2 which looks amazing.", "author": "Thuy V."}

Well I don't know how true that is but I'm assuming it's true. Lokma however, is neither of the above. It's low key and affordable but even better, it's really good. Lokma mixes brunch and Turkish together for a perfect brunch experience.\n\nThe sunrise combo and Turlu omelette were both really good and may be the more popular items on the menu. Fluffy pancakes topped with greek yogurt and berries makes for a unique but delicious experience. The Turkish sausage is a nice alternative to the many other not as good breakfast sausages out there. It's a nice surprise mixing Turkish/Mediterranean flavors and brunch foods together; they complement each other quite nicely.\n\nLokma may become highly popular soon so come by before then. It's still low key so far and while I wish the best success for them, I also enjoy not waiting for brunch so... yeah, I dunno. Eat here.", "author": "Derek T."}

We helped ourselves to the sunrise combo, turlu omelet (w/ avocado), hummus and pita, and the fresh orange juice. Everything was sooo incredibly flavorful and honestly what I believe brunch food in heaven tastes like. \n\nEverything we had we would have again, but our absolute favorite and what we would recommend are their pancakes!!! We've never had pancakes that tasted the way these do... They're huge, thick, plush (so filling), and have an unexpected spiced flavor that pairs perfectly with the tangy yogurt and sweet berries served on top. I used to say I liked waffles more than pancakes until the day I had the pancakes at Lokma. I daydream about their pancakes....\n\nLokma is 100000% my favorite brunch spot in the city so far, and my bf and I are beyond excited to revisit Lokma tomorrow and explore more of their menu and revisit our fav pancakes in the city.

We've eaten here multiple times for dinner--once with a group of seven--trying their manti (delicious little Turkish raviolis), a Turkish take on ratatouille with orzo (whose name I forget), the Presidio salad (get it with the phenomenal grilled chicken), their addictive papas bravas, and their grilled branzino (which is practically enough for two). We've also had both deserts and there wasn't a disappointing dish among any of the ones we've tried. \nI just got the message that their wine and beer license has come in, the lack of which was the only thing that prevented this restaurant from being perfect.

Her's came with some kind of ratatouille and that was extra yummy. My friend who is quite a foodie, said it was the best omelette she has ever had. I felt like an A+ host and I believe she will visit my again. Yay! A delicious high light was the clotted cream and honey served with pita. There was also traditional Turkish coffee. The grounds in the bottom of the cup made me feel worldly and sophisticated. The server was super friendly but not over bearing or pushy. My friend was happy, my baby was happy and it was just a really great experience all around.  We visited on a weekday so no wait at all. Closed on mondays.", "author": "Brandy C."}

Either this place needs more cooks in the kitchen, or a more efficient wait staff.  I'm not sure why we had to wait an hour for two egg dishes and a chicken sandwich?

That is very expensive for what you get, especially for this neighborhood. And I was still hungry after the meal.

I came here with 3 friends, and 2 out of the 4 of us liked the breakfast. \nThe 2 friends who enjoyed theirs ordered the pancakes and mushroom omelet.\nI ordered the breakfast sandy and was actually really bummed. It had mayonnaise caked on both pieces of bread, and inside had a fried egg, lettuce, and tomato which seemed a very odd combo. I wonder if maybe it's Mediterranean stile and that's why the combo seemed strange, but personally I didn't like the taste at all as the egg & mayo combo was too much. \nMy husband ordered the avocado toast 3 stiles, and it was really underwhelming. Just bread with some smashed avocado, one with a piece of tomato, one with a piece of pastrami and the 3rd with fennel or something on it. Totally bland and a bummer. I get that avocado toast is simple, but if you offer something like that at a restaurant it should at least be somewhat enticing. \n\nAll in all, I'm going to try a few more things here, but I hope they step up the quality.", "author": "Hannah W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-18", "description": "super excited for a totally different kind of spot to open here. after years of high turnover i'm really hoping this place makes it. my friend and i shared a bunch of brunch items and everything was very tasty. we had the greek yogurt pancakes which were really light and had a wonderful flavor, the blackberry bulgar which seemed healthy but tasted too good to be true, the greek yogurt with granola which sounds run of the mill but was anything but, and the house salad (which my friend's 6yo insisted on) and even that was really good. will definitely be back. can't wait to try dinner and the rest of the brunch menu. good luck, lokma!!", "author": "kimberry l."}
