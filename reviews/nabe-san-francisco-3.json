I got regular size sukiyaki ($25) and kimchi+kurobuta pork belly ($25) each time. Sukiyaki broth was more on the sweeter side but it was good. Their wagyu beef were fresh and really good!\nAs a Korean myself, I enjoyed kimchi broth more. It was not spicy but broth was flavorful and delicious! It had lots of veggies, tofu and kimchi with pork belly! Highly recommend this one!\n\nMy favorite part of this meal was that they make you rice soup (porridge or korean Juk) with leftover broth which was unexpectedly good! We chose Kimchi broth for porridge and that was the best part of the meal. We were so full before we had that porridge, but we had to finish it because it was sooooo good! It got little saltier later but still good. The service was outstanding and server was very attentive.\n\nNabe's hot pot definitely warms your soul on a cold night!!

I did it online.\n\nThe only reason, and it was a large reason for my case, why I decided to lower the star from 5 to 4 is the portions. \n\nFirst off, the food was very delicious. We ordered two large nabe styles: shabu shabu (ordered the beef) and the kinoko (mushroom and vegetables). The shabu shabu came with a plate of vegetables (carrot, tofu, spinach, enoki mushrooms, shiitake mushroom, daikon radish, udon, etc.). On the other hand, most of the stated vegetables were already placed in the kinoko nabe (the ramen came as a separate plate), so there was fewer preparations for that dish. \nI ordered the konbu dashi for the shabu shabu because I wanted to try the shabu shabu that focuses on the meat's flavor. Also, we ordered the kinoko dish, and that is already made in a miso broth, so it was great to try two different soups. In the end, we selected the rice porridge to be made in the kinoko broth. I do have to add, the miso broth was lacking the dashi taste (lacking konbu, katsuo bushi, or shiitake). \n\nAt first glance, I can tell, I can easily eat one of these large nabe and one regular nabe portion all by myself, if I were to arrive at the restaurant hungry with a 90% or higher empty stomach. Even my other family members could have eaten at least one large nabe on their own.\n\nWe cleared the dishes and ate the rice porridge - and I have arrived drinking 1 1/2 cups of coffee an hour or so earlier - and I was 75% full. \n\nI do also recommend setting up a reservation. It takes at least 2 hours for a guest to eat, minus the conversational chatter time duration, so if all seats are full, you might have to wait an hour or longer.", "author": "Mito I."}

We ordered the ishikari nabe, and it was honestly my favorite. The broth is super buttery and has such a subtle but beautiful flavor to it. I found myself just drinking the broth because it was soooo good. We also ordered the shabu shabu with spicy miso, which was super flavorful and moderately spicy. We loved the wagyu beef! Also, the zosui at the end was perfect. I loved to watch it being made at our own table, and to finish it all off with the chewy and crunchy mochi cake was awesome! The meal was super satisfying.\n\nThey have great drinks also! If sake is your thing, there's plenty of that. I opted for the choya plum wine, which was super sweet with just a hint of tartness.

Throughout the evening, I had to constantly flag down the waitresses to make sure my a la carte orders had been taken. My friends and I also weren't receiving much attention compared to other tables. The menu specifically stated that each set came with rice. But it took us more than 30 minutes (with constant reminding) to get our two bowls of rice sent to our table. In contrast, I noticed that the other parties sitting right next to us got their rice and meat plates much sooner than we were, despite having been seated much later. By the end of the meal, I noticed that the waitresses seemed tired with my constant calling them for attention, but from a customer's perspective, It's frustrating when I feel like I'm not being heard.\n\nOtherwise, the food was great. I'm a smaller eater, so portions were perfect, but if you have a larger appetite. you might have to order a few more dishes a la carte. Be mindful when ordering the seafood and duck sets. The meats are placed in the broth as the broth heats up on the hot plate, so make sure to take the meats out as soon as they're done. The worst thing that can happen is to be left with rubbery, overcooked meat.", "author": "Connie X."}

I think Nabe is so yummy, kinda pricey, but every time I come I leave happy. \n\nMy bf and I have now been here multiple times, and we usually always make a reservation an hour or two in advance just incase they're busy, thus we've never had to wait more than about 5 minutes. Every time we come we get the large beef wagyu shabushabu since it already comes with udon, and I'm an udon LOVER! We have tried both the miso and spicy miso, and enjoy both, but as people who like da spice, we usually go for spicy miso =). We also like to get an add on of mochi, even though its $4 for 6 tiny pieces...I LOVE MOCHI, and mochi wrapped in wagyu beef is so so good (also a couple of times they gave us 7 pieces, twas magical)!!! At the end they make a yummy zosui (rice porridge) with your leftover broth, and mmm it is so good, both my bf and I love porridge, so we are always happy for it at the end. Once they accidentally burned it, but we got extra for the inconvenience, which was very nice of the staff. On days where we are too full, we bring it home and eat it for lunch the next day, and mm it taste just as good! For dessert, we have only tried the butter mochi with ice cream, which is definitely worth it in my opinion. \n\nI definitely recommend Nabe, and maybe someday we will venture out and try out something besides our usual shabu shabu.

However, it turns out all tables but two were already reserved, so I highly recommend making reservations. We were sitting near the door, and we saw a lot of people walk-in and get discouraged by the long wait time and leave.\n\nMy friend and I opted to share a regular Kamonanban ($25), which is duck breast, leeks and soba in dashi broth. We also ordered some additional sides of shirataki (the thin clear yam noodles), the assorted mushrooms, and an extra order of enoki. Yes we really love our mushrooms! \n\nThe way it works here is, instead of cooking each item separately in the nabe pot as you would at a hotpot place, each nabemono set already has all of the ingredients in it (but raw) when it is brought to your table. Once you place the nabe pot on the stove, it'll slowly start simmering and gradually the ingredients inside will cook. Any additional add-on items will be brought on the side and those you can add at your leisure.\n\nThe quality of the duck meat was fine, but some pieces had a lot of fat that I ended up taking off. We left the soba in the boiling dashi broth for too long and they started breaking apart, so I'd recommend eating those early on. \n\nI didn't like the fact that there was only one dipping sauce that I thought might've been ponzu sauce. I wasn't a big fan of it, and that dampened my enjoyment of the meal a little bit. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal came at the end, when the server dumped some extra rice into our leftover broth and made a nice thick rice porridge from it. I was already stuffed from the meal, but somehow my friend and I managed to scarf it all down.\n\nI would love to come back and try another nabe set and eat their yummy rice porridge again!\n\nWe paid about $25 pp after tax and tip.\n\nParking in this area is all street parking. I had a pretty easy time finding parking on the same block as the restaurant, perhaps because it was still a little early for dinner (around 5) when I parked.", "author": "Dianna H."}

We spent ~4 hours there...so we were pretty exhausted and hungry. I wanted to try Nabe since my friend recommended it, so we came right when the restaurant opened. We were seated immediately - because we came on a Wednesday at 5p - and the restaurant was almost half-full by the time we left at 6p. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very modern yet cozy. The lights are a little dim, but I guess that makes the setting more calm and romantic. There's also 1 stove for every 2 people - so you can choose to share (max 2 people per pot), or if you don't share, they will split the pot in half.\n\nFor starters, we ordered PORK SAUSAGE which came with mustard aioli. The sauce just tasted like Japanese mayo to me, but we both really liked the sausage. The dish came with 4 decently sized sausages, and they were very juicy and flavorful. I also really liked the texture of the outside skin since it had a slight crispiness to contrast the juicy meat.\n\nWe shared a LARGE SUKIYAKI pot. It came with a nice assortment of veggies, 1 egg (we ordered another egg add-on so each of us would get one), some kind of vermicelli, 1 bowl of rice (we ordered another as add-on), sweet broth, and beef. The overall experience was very fun - we got to watch the soup heat to a boil, crack our egg inside, and add the pieces of beef.  Then we got to ladle food from the pot into our bowl to eat with rice. Everything tasted fresh and the beef was good quality. My boyfriend thought the broth was too sweet for his liking, but it was fine for me (with a sweet tooth).\n\nAt the end, the server made a porridge by combining rice, egg, and green onion with our leftover broth. Since I ate a lot of broth earlier, I thought the porridge pretty much tasted the same as my main meal - but the nori topping gave my taste buds something salty to contrast with everything I ate thus far.  \n\nIn conclusion, we left with very very full and satisfied bellies. The service was excellent too. And a funny thing we noticed was that the windows get really really foggy because the restaurant turns into a sauna compared to the cold outdoors. I'm definitely bringing my friends and family here again!", "author": "Sarina C."}

Its a small intimate little place with delicious options and friendly staff. I get the wagyu beef and spicy miso. Tried the traditional broth last time I was there but there wasn't a whole lot of flavor. My friends have tried the miso and liked it though so there is other options if you aren't a fan of spicy.  Their large platter is pretty big so I'd recommend sharing with one other person. Make sure to save room at the end because they use the both to make a savory porridge which is amazing. The prices are reasonable and they do have appetizer options along with a pretty big list of alcoholic drinks. So far during the week it doesn't seem too busy and you might get away with not having a reservation.  I recently went on a Saturday night and wasn't smart enough to have a reservation.  Luckily the lady waiting on tables was super patient and polite and took my name down while making sure to explain that it might be a 45min-1hour wait. My friend and I used the extra time to explore a bit and came back. There is a small bench outside but otherwise no real space to wait.

I called last minute in on a Friday night and the employee immediately reserved a table for us! We got there in about 10min and we were able to be seated right away. \nI've only tried the wagyu beef shabu shabu with spicy miso. The shabu broth options are spicy miso, miso, and kombu. You get to choose one type of broth per set so if you have a party of two, you get a pot with a divider in the middle. They still give you a divider even if you get two of the same broths, which is really convenient if you have dietary restrictions or if you're sick and you don't want to share broths!\nThe spicy miso broth was pretty good. I love spicy food and the spiciness level is pretty mild. I like that they use wagyu beef instead of the usual kobe beef. I thought the meat quality was good but it was a little too tough and chewy. It's also served with udon, tofu, 3 types of mushrooms, napa cabbage, spinach, and carrots. They gave a sesame sauce and ponzu sauce, and I typically only like to use the ponzu at any hot pot place. I thought the ponzu was pretty salty, but it was good when I dilute it with a little broth. I love the porridge at the end! They add rice, egg and green onions to one of the broths. They also top it with seaweed but I opt for no seaweed. The porridge is so good but we were really full and just brought the rest home!\nThere's no AYCE options. They definitely chose quality over quantity. The prices recently increased to $22 for regular and $26 for large! I think it's slightly more expensive than average but you pay for quality!\nAlso, one major downside is that it was so hot and stuffy in there when it was packed. The glass walls in the front even start fogging up! They have ventilation but it's not nearly strong enough.", "author": "Emily L."}

Not that I'm an expert in the difference, but I think it's the sauces and portions of the two that differ.\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend and I ordered a regular Sukiyaki and a regular shabu shabu. ($20 each). It came with two sauces: a soy sauce/ponzu flavored one and a sesame one. Both were great but the ponzu one could be stronger. Good portions surprisingly. We thought it wouldn't be enough, but ended up being very full! The veggies were mostly identical in both sets. The beef was good as well.\n\nAbsolutely loved the end of the meal! This part is dinner only: If you ordered the sets, the server will make a rice soup with the rest of your broth. The broth is heated, then a bowl of Zosui rice is added. Stirred for a few mins, then a raw egg is cracked in the mixture. Stir some more, add green onions, and it's finished. Topped with seaweed! It's so freakin' good. I would have bowls of this just by itself. This isn't offered for lunch, so if you're curious, definitely come for dinner!\n\nShout-out to the service.

We ordered the Spicy Miso Shabu Shabu set ($20 regular/$24 large) and the Sukiyaki set ($20 regular/$24 large). Each of those came with assorted vegetables and an order of Wagyu beef. We ordered another two plates of Wagyu beef ($12 each regular) and Duck Breasts ($16 regular) as an add-on. First of all, this place is pretty pricey, but the flavor and quality is absolutely worth the splurge.\n\nAlthough I had the Spicy Miso pot, I also tried the Sukiyaki and absolutely fell in love with it. The sweet and salty flavor was unique and tasteful. I kept refilling my bowl with the soup to drink, yum. In the end, you also get to choose one of your soups to make into a porridge and of course we chose the Sukiyaki flavor. The porridge is mixed with rice, green onions, egg, and seaweed. I never knew it could taste so delicious! The food here is definitely something I'd be back for, but the service not so much.

The soup was so flavorful, the wagyu beef was tender, and the veggies had good variety. The ponzu sauce was okay in my opinion, and we both preferred to use the raw egg dipping sauce. My favorite part of the meal was the complementary rice porridge at the end. It was honestly a great way to use the rest of the soup (the soup is so good, I was prepared to finish it regardless!).  \n\nOur servers were extremely attentive and polite, and the restaurant had a classy, but casual atmosphere.

This is great because both times I've been here, there's been a line, and the restaurant is pretty small/narrow and has limited tables/seating available. They recently opened a second location in Marina/Cow Hollow though, and I think that location is bigger.\n\nThis place has replaced Shabu House as my favorite shabu restaurant! The different options they have all sound so appealing it was hard to pick one. We got a split pot of the seafood shabu and the mushrooms one (vegetarian, but has four different kinds of mushrooms). Both were quite good, although we enjoyed the seafood a little more. The clams I ate (about six in the large seafood shabu) had sand in them though. We also ordered a side of wagyu beef that was EXCELLENT. Such good meat. \n\nThe coolest thing about this place is that they make you a complimentary porridge at the end of your meal to top it off (and is great if you don't quite get full off of shabu)! They use the leftover broth (if you have multiple, you pick the one you want them to use) and put some rice, egg, green onion, seaweed. Sooo yummy.

The sukiyaki broth is a little on the sweet side, but it makes for a delicious congee combo when they add rice to the leftover broth and reduce it to a tasty treat. It makes for AMAZING leftovers. The congee is their house special and included in the price for the shabu sets (why it's more expensive than other places). \nThe shabu shabu broth is good too, very traditional. And the spicy shabu is really spicy so make sure you can handle it. \nThe veggies and sides that come with the sets are fresh (comes with napa cabbage, mushrooms, tofu, carrot slices, kabocha slices, and either udon or clear Soba noodles).

It's a shabu shabu place rather than a noodle shop but either way it's nice to have a local option for hot Japanese soup.\n\nThis place gets pretty crowded but my wife and I were fortunate enough to get seated within 10 minutes of showing up.  They have a nice selection of different broths and food items to cook in it.  We got the mushroom platter which comes with miso broth... ordered a side of fish cake for extra protein.  I'll say that the miso was nice if not great...a bit on the bland side but I tend to like strong flavors so your mileage may vary.  It's not clear from the menu but there exists an option for \"spicy miso broth\" so if you want miso with a bit more kick be sure to tell your server, we had some of that and I found it much more to my liking, The mushrooms and other veggies themselves were very nice, especially the trumpet mushrooms.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not comment on the specialty sake flight I had.  WOW!  Definitely a stand out.  I don't know how it compares to the similarly priced premium sake flight or the cheaper standard flight but the unfiltered and pearled sake on offer with this flight were top notch, definitely a nice experience for $20 and reasonably generous (albeit still small) pours for each.", "author": "Alan S."}

Use caution if you do wait inside as the door swings inward ( I think this might be a fire code violation).   Seating inside is tight and not ideal for large groups, unless you come right at opening.\n\nI ordered the nabemono sukiyaki set, which is wagyu beef, shirataki (noodles) with warishita  broth. The set comes with assorted vegetables and rice.  Also got the spicy miso broth with an extra add on of pork and shrimp.  The warishita broth was better than the spicy miso.  The spicy miso was bland.   I finished off my meal with the zosui.  The zosui is like a rice porridge similar to Chinese jook.

The wait was approximately 1.5 hrs, and after much deliberation and checking out other restaurants while the blisteringly chilly winds were fixated on making our toes and feet numb and our hungry stomachs even hungrier, we decided to just wait it out and finally got in ~ 9 PM. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty small, but I really liked the interior. My friend and I got the beef suyaki (regular is $20), and my other friend got the spicy miso pork (~$24??). We also decided to get a 20 oz carafe of the first sake on the menu and it was around $40 :( The meal ended up being around $40 which... I mean... hot pot is kinda pricey to begin with but man, idk if I would do this again just because:\n\n1. The wait is extremely long on the weekends (not sure about weekdays though).\n2. Nabe is on the more pricier $$ than other $$ restaurants on Yelp.\n3. The waiters didn't refill our water until the end when I had to ask them to. The restaurant is pretty dang small, so I don't get how they couldn't at least offer to refill the water ONCE. Our main waiter was kind of cool towards us and hardly smiled, but another waiter who made our rice thingy at the end was awesome and really friendly! So I'm conflicted with how I feel about the waiters/service lol. \n\nOther than all that, the food was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed the beef suyaki! My friends spicy miso pork was really intensely-feel-it-in-your-nostrils spicy haha, and I like spicy, but once you cooked the pork in it the broth at the end of the meal became less intensely spicy and was really yummy. I like how they added rice at the end too, that was a nice touch-- but the food and service better be AWESOME if we have to wait 1.5 hrs in the cold outside -_- The sake was good too, but I'm not a sake connoisseur so I don't think that prices going all the way up to $80 for a bottle is worth it. \n\nI'd give this place a 4 star if their service and prices had been better (as wait time can't be helped).\n\nIf you wanna check out a solid hot pot place I'd come back here for their lunch menu when it's probably less crowded and cheaper!", "author": "Joy K."}

She drools over my shabu shabu pictures in LA so she asked me to find a good shabu place in SF. Nabe is new and came highly recommended so we made reservations. MAKE RESERVATIONS, it's tiny!\n\nAmbiance could be better... There's a loooooooooooong communal table in the middle and a few tables on the side. LUCKILY my bestie and I got our own table to the side. I would've hated to catch up in between a bunch of strangers. They use the space to the fullest extent... like there's barely any room for the waiters to move around AND it's a fucking sauna in there. It's so funny cuz the glass windows literally steam up and you can't see anything outside. Ok on the important part... the food.\n\nYou order a set of broth and meat and choose regular or large. The sets come with the items listed plus assorted veggies, noodles, and rice. You can also add veggies and more meat for an additional fee. I thought that the sets provided more than enough. For a party of 2, order these two sets to share... perfect combination!\n\n+ Sukiyaki (wagyu beef and shirataki in warishita broth) - I liked their sukiyaki. Sometimes it can be TOO sweet or salty, but theirs is just right. Wagyu beef is super on point... really great quality. I highly recommend this set.\n\n+ Shabu shabu (wagyu beef/kurobuta pork and udon in radition konbu, miso, or spicy miso) - get this with wagyu beef and SPICY MISO. I've had spicy miso at other locations and this one is by far the best spicy miso shabu I've ever had. I HIGHLY recommend. Again the wagyu beef is great and I don't think I'd ever stray from beef with shabu. \n\n+ porridge - What's different about Nabe that I really enjoyed was the porridge they make for you at the end of your meal. They simply ask you to choose a broth, add rice and condiments, and voila... delicious. \n\nAsk for their ponzu and goma sauce because I don't think they don't serve it automatically with your set. AND be sure to ask for garlic, green onions, daikon, and chili oil/powder (if you like spice) to add to each sauce. \n\nNabe is missing one important ingredient - hot drops to add to the sauce. Every shabu spot in SoCal has this and it is a key component. LUCKILY we brought our own so the lack of it didn't kill our experience lol. Nabe, I suggest looking into it. \n\nI'm hoping they expand in the near future. This spot has so much potential.", "author": "Elysse P."}

However, after our meal, we were offered to have porridge with the leftover spicy miso broth and it was amazing. The waitress put in two bowls of rice into the leftover broth, turned the heat up, let it cook for a couple minutes, and slowly started taking some of the broth out so it wouldn't be soupy. She also added a scrambled egg, green onions and seaweed. My friend & I were pleasantly surprised at how amazingly delicious this was. However, I would most likely not return to Nabe for shabu.

The vegertable assortment is similar to Shabu House, except they have pumpkin at Nabe and you have to order it as a side at Shabu House so that's a plus for Nabe.

Personally, I had the Sukiyaki which is the wagyu with Warishita broth. While the wagyu itself was tasty, the broth simply had either too many mushrooms or some other spice that made it too herbal. It was evocative of an herbal ginseng soup that my parents would make me drink. And considering that the broth is supposed to be the star of any hotpot, I was left disappointed-the same story applied to my sister as well, who had the duck breast nabemono. We left unsatisfied and still hungry. If we're ever in the San Fran area we would maybe try again-but get something else entirely.", "author": "Chris H."}

I am not even that crazy about tabletop BBQ but the idea of boiling your own food at your own table is not my idea of dining out. If I have to cook my own food, I should get a discount. \n\nThe place is very small and very cramped. The waitresses can barely move around. The room became quite warm and the windows were all steamed up. I was claustrophobic but maybe that was because I was up against the wall next to the kitchen.\n\nThe decor is very modern and stylish. I would say there is nothing special about the food. It is pretty standard hot pot fare - just vegetables and meat with a choice of sweet broths. The porridge made at the end is just leftover broth and rice with some added seaweed boiled for a few minutes until it is a mush. You top off your meal with the same flavors but served in porridge form. Yum. Half of our group sampled a teaspoonful. Then we left to get ice cream.", "author": "Fish T."}

I wasn't in the mood to go to an ultra trendy restaurant in the Mission or wherever they are these days. Who has the time to wait in line for 2 hours? Nabe seemed like great comfort food for a cool SF evening. \n\nWe were able to score free street parking easily and were seated right away. We thought that the free filtered water was awesome and it was brought out in pretty frosted glass bottles (I know, it's a random observation).\n\nAnyway, I ordered the Sukiyaki with beef and my date for the evening ordered the Spicy Miso broth with Kurobuta Pork. The meat was of high quality and the portion size for the veggies was generous for a Japanese shabu shabu place. My side of the pot took quite some time to heat up since all of the veggies had already been dumped into the broth. I think the Spicy Miso broth was better tasting the Sukiyaki broth. I really enjoyed the rice porridge that was made using the leftover Spicy Miso broth at the end. That was probably the best part of the entire meal.\n\nI also really enjoyed eavesdropping on the people behind us who were on a first date.

It was pretty late when we got here, which explains why there were only four other tables occupied.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the Sukiyaki and the Kinoko nabe.  The Sukiyaki comes with everything u would expect from shabu shabu, but with thinly sliced marbled pieces of beef.  They also supply you with an egg for dipping the meat in to make it more silky.  The Kinoko nabe comes with mushrooms and ramen.  Both broths were very flavorful.  I liked the Sukiyaki a little better though because it is more traditional.  \n\nThe vegetables and other ingredients are already placed in the pot.  This has its pros and cons.  For example, stuff that you do not like is automatically cooking inside the pot.  Although, one does not really have to worry about overcooking tofu or mushrooms, the vegetables may get soggy in this manner.  Pros are that you can get whatever you want at once because they will have all cooked at the same time!  \n\nAfter you are done eating, they prepare a type of rice soup.  They ask you what type of broth you want the rice soup to be made in.  Then, they bring out green onions, egg, seaweed, and of course rice.  They add the rice into the broth.  Then they slowly drain the broth until the rice is clearly visible under the broth.  After that, the egg and green onions are stirred into the equation.  Then, this creation is put into bowls and topped with seaweed.  This was definitely my favorite part of the meal.  Dinner and a show?  Awesome.  \n\nWe were so full after the meal.  However, we had to make room for dessert.  Their special is the butter mochi, which is made in house.  I could definitely tell they were proud of it because they asked us what we thought of it.  It was really delicious.  Imagine a warm mochi that melts in your mouth.  It is served with ice cream of your choice.  The GF loves black sesame, and it paired great with the mochi.

Start with an appetite, leave with a mini gut. \n\n-FOOD, very good \n-PRICES, decent\n-SERVICE, good\n-AMBIANCE, small and chic\n\nBeen wanting to come here for months. Had reservations for 2 at 7pm. Packed but thank god for reservations. Make reservations or you'll be sitting outside for awhile. THE WALL OF SAKE BOTTLES amaze me, it's like a Sake fountain... It's not decor. Place is small and steams up like a sauna and the glass walls steam up. We decided to do two broths at regular size to taste as much as we can. \n\nHEFER STATS. \n\nKUROBUTA SAUSAGE ($5) - with mustard aioli. Comes with four sausages. The sausages were appetizer size, very very tasty, and it's worth getting to eat while the Shabu Shabu is warming up.\n\nSUKIYAKI ($19/reg) - Wagyu beef, shirataki with warishita broth. They give you a raw egg and this fabulous dipping sauce for the Wagyu. Dip the raw Wagyu beef in the raw egg first, then the Shabu Shabu, then the fabulous dipping sauce... So good!!! Japanese people and their raw eggs rock my socks!!! The sukiyaki is a savory and sweet broth, gives the beef a nice coating of both. The only thing I hate toward the end of the meal all the veggies become mushy cause of the hotpot cooking all that time. \n\nSEAFOOD YASENABE ($19) - shrimp, salmon, scallops, and clams. Harusami with dashi broth. We chose a seafood since we already had meats. This is perfect for seafood lovers. All the seafood boiling in the broth married each item and it tasted good. I am not much of a seafood broth person, I love seafood but when seafood mix together in soup the taste then becomes too seafoodish - I'm weird. It was good but rather keep Shabu Shabu all meats/pork if possible. \n\nSURPRISE!!! When you think you're full, they come out asking which broth you liked more and make a porridge out of the leftover broth (trust, you will have left over broth). We chose the Sukiyaki. They mix rice and green union in the pot and explain what they are doing, then pour it in a bowl for you and top it off with seaweed garnish. So good yet so filling. You can pack it up if you like.\n\nBUTTER CAKE AND SESAME ICECREAM - they don't feature their desserts on the menu. They have a few items and an assortment of icecream. I must always end a good meal with dessert, that's just me. Full or not!!! I got to choose so I selected the butter cake and paired it with sesame icecream because the other choices would make it sweet on top of sweet. Two lite butter cakes were the consistency of light pound cake. Ice cream taste exactly as it sounds. \n\nWill I be back? Yup!\n\nUntil the next review.....", "author": "Jane A."}

Because the waitresses were so informative and helpful, our food actually came with a healthy side of knowledge. And of course, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!\n\nDid you know......\n\n1) Nabe, short for Nabemono, is not exactly the same as Shabu. In Nabemono, heaps of food are already filled into the hotpot broth. In contrast, ShabuShabu comes out with only broth, and food is filled into it afterwards. If you're eating at Nabe, choosing any broth options other than 'Shabu' will get you a beautiful hot pot broth with a variety of ingredients already inside. (Don't worry, both options come with thinly slice marbled meat on the side!)\n\n2) The meal is finished with Zosui, which is similar to a porridge, or a Japanese Risotto. A waitress comes over to your table with a plate of rice, egg, seaweed, and scallion and then proceeds to cook the rice in the leftover broth. Apparently, the rice absorbs the leftover nutrients from the veggies in the broth, thus making the Zosui a nutritious finish to the meal. My mom pointed out that there is probably a lot of fat and sodium in the broth, but she also agreed that it makes the Zosui absolutely delicious.\n\n3) The most important thing to know for Nabe is TO GET THE MOCHI BUTTER CAKE DESSERT. They make the Mochi Cake in house, so this is the only place to taste this delightful dessert. It's served with a scoop of ice cream. Just imagine biting into a warm-buttery-chewy piece of cake with a sudden sensation of sweet-chilly ice cream sliding down your taste buds. gettttttit\n\nMy mom and my sister gave strong compliments to the stellar service.

Especially if you are sick and it is cold outside. \n\nSETTING\n-Nabe is in a busy part of Inner Sunset - right between Irving and Judah on 9th Ave.\n-Glass doors and walls so you can look right into the restaurant, unless it's around dinner when the inside is so hot that the glass gets fogged up! \n-They have a few tables for parties of 4 or smaller, and then a long table that stretches in the middle of the restaurant for pairs or larger groups. \n-If it's a full house they do have a wait list you can put your name on. You can wait inside or wander about outside and they'll give you a call. \n-Service gets a little bit slow when things get crowded.\n\nSHABU SHABU\n-We always go for the half pot Spicy Miso Broth (Shabu Shabu order) and half pot Warishita broth (Sukiyaki order)\n-Meat platters come in two sizes: Regular or Large. The prices vary depending on which type of meat. For this outing we ended up ordering a large Sukiyaki wagyu beef order and a regular Shabu Shabu kurabuta pork plate.\n-Each order comes with a plate of assorted vegetables and other condiments: tofu, cabbage, enoki mushroom, carrot, udon noodles, shiitake mushroom, kabocha squash, etc. \n-TIP: After you finish your shabu shabu meal, there is actually a FINISHER! The waiter will bring out rice and use your leftover broth to make a rice soup. The spicy miso broth rice soup finisher is amazing. They add an egg, green onions, and a little bit of seaweed. It takes about 10 minutes to prepare if your broth is still hot. \n\nPROS/TIPS\n-Complimentary rice soup finisher after your Shabu Shabu meal! It always hits the spot if you're still a little hungry after your Shabu Shabu!\n-Ask for iced water when you get in - most people ask for tea but after you get your Shabu Shabu... you'll want cold water.\n-Keep your broth hot after you're done with your Shabu Shabu and you're ready for the finisher - otherwise it'll take extra time to reheat the broth and make the finisher. Since it's time intensive you could end up waiting for awhile. \n\nOverall delicious :) happy happy shabu shabu!", "author": "Grace J."}

The place is fairly big, but the seating near the glass window is weird since people could see you haha. Their decor was marvelous though, really simplistic which I like. Sake bottles all around, FTW. If you're lucky, you can come here earlier and score an individual table. Otherwise, you'll end up at the community table where you share the table with random people lol.\n\nI came here for my 21st birthday with my cousin last year, and I recall ordering sukiyaki. The broth came out to a nice sweet tasting broth, for my big ass sweet tooth. The meats that come with it are nicely sliced and fresh, so that they cook faster. They give you a generous ass amount of veggies, which makes me uber delights. Their dipping sauces however, tasted rather unique to me. I guess it's because I really like how Shabu House makes it. \n\nOne thing that's unique about this place compared to other Shabu joints is what they do to your rice that you have left.

There were two other open tables, so I guess we came at a good time. We sat in the middle section of the long table, and though the restaurant is small, the way they have the tables set up doesn't make you feel cramped. But then again, there's only two of us. The atmosphere is very modern, with the sake bottle wall and the white tables contrasted with the grey wall paint. They also use wooden bowls and spoons, which gives the meal itself a more traditional feel I suppose. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward, and we both chose the Shabu Shabu with spicy miso and Wagyu beef ($19 for the regular). If your table chooses different soups, they'll give you a split pot. The veggie plate gets bonus points from me because it had kabocha, a sort of pumpkin! The beef was beautifully cut into squares and looked very pretty. The soup was more spicy than miso, so eh. The boyfriend and I were pretty disappointed with the ponzu sauce; they give it to you already mixed with Daikon and garlic, and it's just too... Pickled tasting. We both barely touched it. They also don't offer chili oil, garlic, Daikin, or any of that at the table. \n\nThe BEST part of the meal had to be the zotsui, rice porridge, at the end of the meal. The waitress takes your leftover soup, mixes in some rice and an egg, and let's it sit. Then she'll serve it with some green onions and seaweed. So. Damn. Good. And if you don't finish, you can take it home! Honestly, this was the main reason I wanted to come to Nabe. \n\nThe servers were really great and friendly. When the place got packed, they slowed down a bit, but I can't blame them I guess. The waitress who made our zotsui for us explained every step, and asked to make sure it was okay to put in whatever ingredient was going next, which I think is great service. When the table next to us asked why one half of their pot wasn't boiling, she kindly told them it was because it had more stuff in it (duh). \n\nSo what's my verdict? Nabe is probably the closest to traditional shabu shabu I've had, but the spicy miso just didn't do it for me. While I'd definitely come back purely for the zotsui (and maybe try the kimchi soup), I'm probably gunna stick with Shabu House, where I love the spicy miso and you get to mix up your own ponzu.", "author": "Doris K."}

We drove because I knew there was a small public parking lot across the street that was not likely to be full at such an hour on a Sunday night.  Sure enough we got a parking spot after a brief wait.  We walked across the street to Nabe and were confronted by a complete wall of glass that was covered over by floor to ceiling condensation so that you could only see a shadow of what was going on inside.  I opened the glass door with interpretation.\n\nOnce inside the place was buzzing but not noisy or sauna like I'd expected.  There is waiting space for only about two but we were quickly greeted by a waitstaff and told it'd be about a five minute wait.  Another couple entered soon after us but were quickly seated at the one visibly open table so obviously Nabe does take reservations.\n\nThe interior of Nabe would be what I'd describe as Norwegian/Japanese chic with a tight but clean communal dinning sort of arrangement.  The table tops are inset with slick modern glass induction cooktops. No overhanging exhaust fans in sight as everything is neatly hidden behind a high ceiling blond wood grid.\n\nThe food: We started with the edamame w/ sea salt and both the Wagu and the Vegetable gyoza (six pcs each). They were out of the Wagu gyoza but the vegetable ones were delicious although small.  When my Japanese wife noted their size I told her they most likely were made in house.  The edamame were pan seared instead of the traditional steamed but interestingly delicious.\n\nThe main dish for us was the Vegetable Nabe with a caveat we added a side of Wagu beef!  Yep, the maximum amount premium vegetables with a single side of meat.  They brought an iron pot filled with beautiful mushrooms, vegetables and a couple slices of Kabocha and the boiling started pronto.  The Wagu beef showed up at the table beautifully sliced thin on a side plate.  Add to the beef to the vegetables as you wish. Individual bowls of a light traditional dipping sauce were provided along with small wooden \"cooling\" bowls as I like to call them.\n\nOnce at the bottom of the Nabe pot we ladled out the smooth flavorful broth and drank it from our \"cooling\" bowls as the cr\u00e8chendo to a simple but delicious fully shared meal.

I had heard a lot of good things about this place and always wanted to try it for their \"after meal\" where at the end they add rice and egg into your shabu broth and you get a rice porridge.  \n\nWe came about an hour before they closed and there was still quite a few people there.  My boyfriend got the shabu shabu with wagyu beef and spicy miso and I got the sukiyaki with wagyu beef.  Out of the two I personally liked the sukiyaki better. The broth itself was sweet and tasted amazing after dipping your beef in it and then the raw egg they give you. Portion wise they could have been more generous but I understand since it's lunch time their portions are probably smaller than a dinner plate.  We both finished our meat in no time at all and had to order an additional plate of meat because we were still hungry. The meat was good, soft and not frozen like many other places, and I loved the vegetable assortment, especially the variety if mushrooms and kabocha squash!\n\nWhen we were all done the waitress have us the bill and I was thinking... \"We don't get the rice and egg add ins?\" So my boyfriend asked our waitress and she told us it was only during dinner that they do that.   Seeing the disappointment on my face the waitress was sooo kind and said she could bring us a bowl of rice and I could make it myself since my meal already came with a raw egg.  She ended up making the whole thing for us, adding the rice, taking out excess soup to make the rice to soup ratio even, stirring in the raw egg, and she went above and beyond and brought us the green onion and seaweed garnishes to put on top.

I mean, TPumps probably had that many after two weeks and they aren't nearly as good!  Granted, there's a slight difference in what they serve, but still!\n\nUnlike other shabu joints, Nabe doesn't offer an AYCE option (which might be why they get less traffic).  However, the menu does offer several appetizers and Nabemono sets, which each include a plate of meat and vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nabe-san-francisco-3?select=IrM7BJW5wN_xU4PtKKmbBg#jAuLiyN-WUPGbLsAKTkbbA).  To start our meal, the three of us shared an order of the KUROBUTA GYOZA ($7).  The filling was pretty tasty and I liked the accompanying chili sauce, but I thought the skin could have used a harder crust (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nabe-san-francisco-3?select=IrM7BJW5wN_xU4PtKKmbBg#S79V2u3V_0n3JhZSB02q6A).\n\nFor our dinner set, we decided to share a large 50/50 pot ($24) of Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nabe-san-francisco-3?select=IrM7BJW5wN_xU4PtKKmbBg#MhOerOo7cXe4vkZrU31rww).  The SUKIYAKI side came with a Warishita broth and a plate of Wagyu Beef.  Although it was a little light and sweeter than what I would normally go for, it balanced out the rest of the meal pretty well.  Not mind blowing, but solid.\n\nOn the SHABU SHABU side, we went with the Spicy Miso broth over their traditional Kombu and opted for the Kurobuta Pork over getting more beef.  Between its more savory flavor and slight kick, I thought the Spicy Miso was the better of the two we had.  Can't argue with the Kurobuta Pork either!  So good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nabe-san-francisco-3?select=IrM7BJW5wN_xU4PtKKmbBg#J3qUCdFHz-k2gbf5qREluw).\n\nTo cap off the meal, we were served Nabe's signature Zosui rice soup (I don't know of any other place in SF that does it).  Utilizing the remainder of our Spicy Miso broth, our server mixed in an egg, rice, green onions, and nori to create a delicious jook-like soup.  Although it was a little salty, it was delicious!  Almost made us wish we had left more of the meat and veggies in the pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nabe-san-francisco-3?select=IrM7BJW5wN_xU4PtKKmbBg#Xy2B_bzJWTb2zn2AVA2bLw).\n\nDespite the fact they won't replace Shabu House as my favorite spot for shabu in SF (or anywhere), Nabe is more than a sufficient alternative to mix things up a bit.  Not I hope Nabe doesn't get TOO busy in the future...", "author": "Mike L."}

Luckily there was parking right outside the restaurant and it was a minute away from the location. When we walked into the location it was very stuffy and there were a few tables occupied. There were three servers that were very friendly and helpful. We looked at the menu and ordered a set which included Wagyu beef. We added a couple of additional items as we were sharing these the set together. We got the spicy miso soup- I suggest ordering the regular miso soup instead of the spicy as you can always add spicy and not the other way around. The set comes with a vegetable plate that includes some udon, mushroom, spinach, squash etc. The service was okay, when we got there, the employees were eating their dinner too. They failed to tell us it was last call time, so we ended up not being able to order anything. Instead we just ordered this mochi cake with ice cream. The waitress suggest that we order the roasted black sesame ice cream. It was good to try but I wouldn't say that I crave their ice cream or shabu. I suggest trying this shabu place as the decor and utensils are fun, and it could be a nice fun first date, but I don't think this is my go to. The mochi cake was not very tasty, there was definitely a lack of sugar and butter. It needs to be softer, more moist, and definitely sweeter.", "author": "Amy Y."}

Nabe has a great vegetarian broth, though there is only one vegetarian set option. I am a spice devil and thus asked for some spicy sauce/powders to add to my broth so that I could kick up the heat. I also really love udon so I tend to get a portion of that to add to my veggies as well. The staff was really attentive and accommodating when it came down to getting some spicy additions. I was pleasantly surprised by the rice porridge that they served at the end of the meal and would go back just for that. Prices are somewhat steep, but not unreasonable for what you get. The place can get crowded at times so I would say that you should get there close to opening time. Overall, a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

It's different! \n\nThis is a pretty small and cozy joint so I would recommend making reservations like we did. The decor is cool with the sake bottles hanging on the walls. I looooove shabu shabu and I think Nabe does a pretty good job. They offer nabemono sets that come with your choice of a broth and a predetermined set of veggies. You can go ala carte too but I think the sets are where it's at. I got the sukiyaki broth and my friends got the miso. I love sukiyaki and this was exactly what I was craving... it's on the sweeter side. Don't forget to dip your meat in the raw egg! Their ponzu sauce and sesame sauce are also AMAZING. I started to just eat then on their own with my rice. The Wagyu beef it came with was thinly sliced, very good quality and it was accompanied with assorted veggies + shirataki (yam) noodles. Our meal was ended with the zosui (rice porridge) made from the miso broth + green onions and nori (seaweed). It was really flavorful because the broth was so concentrated at that point so it could've been overpowering to some, but I enjoyed it. \n\nIt came out to around $20/person without tax or tip so it is a little more expensive. That was with each of us ordering our own regular order and that was more than enough for me. You could try to order a large and share with 2 people if you have a smaller appetite. I just think shabu is less salty than hot pot which I like, but if you want AYCE or more options, you should probably look elsewhere. \n\n I really have no qualms about this place, so 5 stars it is!", "author": "Sara S."}

I didn't have any expectations for this place because i normally don't even like ShabuShabu . So i was surprised by how much I ended up loving this place.  \n\nI didn't have to wait for a table, then again it was a weekday night.  They didn't have much options for their soup base, which made me to end up picking Sukiyaki base. My friend picked the kimchi soup base. I think out of the two, the sukiyaki was the best.  It was sweet and had flavors to it. The kimchi base was ok, it wasn't spicy enough.  They recommend that with the sukiyaki base that you dip your meat into a raw egg after cooking it.  And wow was I impressed.  The meat was cooked in the perfect booth and when you dip it in the egg, it gave it such a smooth taste.  \n\nThe meats and other ingredients here are really fresh. And at the end of the dinner, they will ask you which of the two soup base you want to make the  Zosui  or maybe it's spelled shime rice soup.  What is that you ask? it's actually a lot like \"jook\" aka Rice Porridge.  They take your leftover soup base (we picked the sukiyaki) and add rice to it and cook it. I'm not really sure what they added to it besides seaweed, but it turned out to be delicious. It actually fills you up, and it's hard for you to finish it after eating so much.

It's been over two years since and this visit was long time coming.  Let me preface that I am biased towards that place on Ocean Avenue near Stonestown for my Saturday lunch.  I was supposed to meet a friend for dinner here, but he flaked due to a family dinner and left me on a solo trip here.  \nWith the dining room half full, my greeter brought me to a middle table next to a young couple.  The menu has a decently wide selection so my dilemma was sukiyaki or shabu.  After a few questions, I ordered the shabu shabu, regular set with spicy miso broth (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=rfP3qj44WmhPJR6DYWIQ2g), $19.00.  Given a choice of Wagyu bed or Kurabota pork, I asked Kevin for a special accommodation of half and half (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=58S7Wi_JmCTRedpeNopCqQ).  Starting with the veggies, which take longer to cook, I filled my pot as gradually got to my proteins.  The meat qjuality was not quite as good as that other place.  Not that it was bad, but wasn't as tasty.  The soup was tangy spicy and lacked the umami of the other place's deep flavored spicy miso.  Also, the one dipping sauce offered is a bit monotone.\nWhat really boosted this from a three to a four star review were the Zosui (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=DT_Clm3Lj3f7ObJLDHlzdg) (plus half) and Kevin's attentiveness to details (plus half).  As mentioned by Cherlynn, the Zosui is a rice porridge similar to Chinese jook that mixes egg, rice, and scallion slices with your remaining Shabu broth.  Mine was expertly cooked by Kevin who then topped my bowl with small nori strips.  Fortunately, I opted for the regular instead of their larger set (more meat), as the porridge put me over the top; in fact, there was porridge to go.\nThe dining room was about 60% full during my meal on a Monday night.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  If you'd like a more intimate meal, you may need to request for a wall side table as the middle ones are very close together.\nYes, I will be back and the meal was good with excellent service.  \nIt just wasn't quite, \"as good as it gets\", in my book.", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-14", "description": "I'll admit, I was a huge skeptic of this place until I actually ate here. Nabe is still a relatively new genre in Japanese cuisine in the US. Of course there are \"shabu shabu\" places, but rarely do you get the genuinely authentic flavors as nabe is supposed to be in Japan.\n\nWe got two large ones to share between 3 people, even though the waitress tried to convince us to get 3. Really, there's no need for that. There are plenty of add-ons for you to, well, add on, to your order. I think you should get as many individual nabe as you want to taste different flavors.\n\nWe got the sukiyaki and seafood yosenabe. Both had different broths. And then we got a bunch of add-ons: veggie plate, shiitake mushrooms, tofu, shungiku. You can also get additional meat and seafood, but I think veggies are essential to nabe, because they impart so much flavor to nabe.\n\nSo the way you're supposed to do this is let the nabe boil. Then start eating the meat. For sukiyaki, they give you a raw egg as a \"wash\" after you cook the meat in the nabe. Since the meat is cut so thinly, you only really need to put it in the boiling broth for a few seconds. And because it's so hot, you dip it in the egg wash and then eat. Let me tell you, the egg makes a world of difference - not only to calm the temperature down, but all add flavor and texture. The meat tastes so much better with the egg.\n\nAs you continue to eat, you might want to bring down the temperature of the heating pad a little if you're not eating meat. Add some veggies and wait for them to be ready. Eat the veggies and then eat more meat. Repeat until you don't have anything but broth.\n\nSignal your server and she'll bring rice over to make zosui. This is an amazing end of the meal extra. Because you've added so much meat and veggies to the broth, the broth is rich with extra flavor that it didn't start with. When you add the rice, it becomes a heavenly porridge. No need to get noodles or other carbs as an add-on. The end of the meal zosui comes with your meal already. It's so much better than noodles because the rice absorbs the broth and all that good flavor.\n\nHot pots are one of my favorite food genres because it can be so flavorful... and FUN TO EAT! Definitely come to Nabe if you like hot pots. You'll be in for an adventure!", "author": "Sherry L."}

We didn't upgrade to the A5 waygu beef, as it was pretty expensive to upgrade. \n\nThe service was great. My pot had the duck and the shabu shabu. The shabu meat quality was quite good. And the duck broth was very savory. I liked the amount of vegetables that came with our orders, but I just wish there was more meat, though we could always add meat. We were a bit disappointed when we added tofu to our order and there weren't that many pieces. \n\nAt the end of our meal, the staff told us to choose two different broths to make the congee from. We chose a spicy miso broth and the duck broth. The rice wasn't cooked as long in the spicy miso broth so it was more chunky. The one made from the duck broth was the best.

They have an inadequate ventilation system, so the front windows are usually covered with steam; it's no surprise if you overlook this restaurant while walking along 9th Avenue. However, the restaurant's name, displayed cleverly with a bold, blue neon lighting against the black exterior, is easily seen across the street, up to half a block away. It's like your calling to come in on a cold day for some yummy Japanese-style comfort food.\n\nWe tried Nabe a few Saturdays ago for an early dinner around 6PM. As newbies, the menu was a little confusing at first. But our server, Nhu, was very helpful explaining how everything worked. Basically, the nabemono sets are portioned per person. They come with the meat, noodles, and vegetables in the broth, all already in a large pot. That pot is brought to your table stove to cook. However, there is one shabu shabu set (beef or pork for choice of meat), which is the only nabemono set that doesn't have the ingredients already in the pot. In other words, you cook it yourself at the table.\n\nWe shared the beef and pork shabu shabu and opted for one regular miso broth and one spicy miso broth (traditional kombu (kelp) in water was the other option for shabu shabu broth). I definitely preferred the beef over the pork. Both meats were very fresh and delicious, but the beef was flavorful on its own that sauce wasn't necessary. Vegetables were fresh and abundant. You're given a generous helping of spinach, cabbage, shiitake and enoki mushrooms, carrots, tofu and kabocha squash. The miso broth was very mild, and the spicy miso definitely had some heat.\n\nI love the idea of using leftover broth for rice porridge, so you're not wasting the broth. The waitress comes over to make it for you. That Saturday night we went, there were only three waitresses in the restaurant, so I give our server credit for doing so much, shuffling back and forth to other tables but still tending to ours. The broth is usually concentrated after your meal, so you can ask for them to dilute it. The rice porridge is a perfect compliment at the end of our meal, keeping us warm before we leave the restaurant and endure the cold night.\n\nNabe is a relatively small restaurant. There's two long communal tables and three smaller 4-person tables. Not a lot of walking room either.

Veggie had a nice selection with generous amount of shitake, enoki and some shimeji mushrooms as well as nappa cabbage, spinach, carrots, and kabocha with tofu and udon.  Kabocha is a bit strange for the hot pot, but oh well.  The waitress only gave me ponzu sauce, so I asked for the sesame sauce in addition. The sauce had a nice flavor, ponzu a bit acidic than I like, but it was good.  Sesame sauce wasn't too thin, but a bit on a sweeter side for my taste, but not bad.  The quality of the meat was a bit disappointing -- rather chewy, even with some marbling.  I'd have to give them 3 stars due to the quality of the meat.  Otherwise, everything else was very good including the service.  I may go back and try their sukiyaki to see how it is...", "author": "Yoshiko D."}

One 'pot' of broth is considered one 'set' - having two sets is \"recommended\" as is written on the menu (they divide the pot in half to put in your two sets of broth separately). One 'set' of the broth could cost up $20, meaning that ordering two sets would put you at a base of ~$40 without any additional add-ons (you could order more meat, for example). The sukiyaki that we ordered was one set (but in a large size instead of regular). The flavors were enjoyable and the complimentary rice \"porridge\" they create using the leftovers of your broth at the end of your meal was tasty as well (available upon request or waitstaff will ask if you would like them to do this for you). The only downside is how much you're paying for the meal - most of the sets felt overpriced given that most of it is broth mainly filled with vegetables and tofu.", "author": "David Y."}

Nothing.\n\nThat was until I heard there was a new shabu joint that opened in The Sets.\n\n*Furiously grabs baby wipes and sprays dry shampoo all over*\n\nHey, don't judge. \n\nMy friends and I came to Nabe on Friday night with reservations. Thankfully, we made reservations because it was packed.\n\nF O O D\nNabe offers Nabemono shabu set meals with additional a la carte meat and seafood options. No AYCE is available.

A veggie platter with udon noodles is included with each set.\n\nOur group's Nabemono Sukiyaki & Shabu Shabu Sets: http://bit.ly/UEmCVg\n\nMy pick was the traditional konbu which is clear broth with seaweed (http://bit.ly/UEmQvI). There's not much flavoring to it but it allows you to enjoy the natural beefiness of the well-marbled washugyu beef (http://bit.ly/UEmZz3). The accompanying sesame paste with bonito and ponzu sauce were deliciously mouth-watering and full of umami flavors (http://bit.ly/UEn7yK).\n\nHowever, when I got a taste of Mr. NSS' Warishita broth (Sukiyaki set), I was in shabu heaven (http://bit.ly/UEndGE). The delicious broth imparted a savory sweetness into the beef that was addicting that I abandoned my own pot. I loved the accompanying raw egg that added a layer of creaminess.\n\nSaving the best for last is the Zosui. After your broth has been well-seasoned from the meat swishing, they add, rice, egg, nori and green onions to your broth to make a Japanese porridge (http://bit.ly/UEnh9o). The Zosui using the Warishita broth was so comforting and oh so good.\n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Wendy, our waitress always had a smile on her face and did a good job explaining the Nabemono shabu concept to us thoroughly since it was new to us.

The broth is awesome and flavorful. the only down-side about this place is by the end of the meal, the waitress or waiter will pour rice into your left over broth and boil it into porridge, unfortunately, due to the laziness of the worker, the portion, taste, and texture  of the porridge is always always very inconsistent. The worker will disregard how much broth you have left in the pot, they will just pour a bowl of rice in there even the broth became very concentrated already, which make the porridge very salty. Sometimes, it would be very watery. I would prefer the perridge to be more consistent. \n\nOverall, I do enjoy eating here, just have to take control of the way they make the porridge.", "author": "Jasmine Y."}

That's just it, Nabe is not your typical hot pot/shabu spot. I can't say that I know how people shabu in Japan but if I had a guess it would probably be close to how we did at Nabe.\n\nNabe had a few Nabemono set meals to choose from but Mr. Dubs and I both ended up with the Sukiyaki and an order of the gyoza. We had originally wanted to try the sausages but they ran out of it. (minus a star. They also didn't have a beer that was on the menu... something that is very typical too) But to redeem themselves... the homemade gyozas were bomb(dot)com for sure! \n\nIf you're the AYCE type of person and won't leave without devouring at least 4 plates of meat a la Hulk style, then Nabe is likely not for you. You would appreciate Nabe if you appreciated organic and locally sourced ingredients as well as top quality meat.\n\nI could hardly wait for my water to boil when our pot arrived. It was filled with tofu, mushroom, veggies, carrots and noodles all in a sweet sukiyaki broth. At the end of the meal, our server took out some rice, egg and seaweed and mixed it into our broth for our Zosui. To be honest, I thought that was just ok. I probably would've preferred having a bowl of rice during my meal instead.\n\nI'll be back at Nabe for sure. Though there isn't an AYCE option, you will definitely walk out feeling full.

It's like two meals in one!\n\nA new hotpot restaurant in Inner Sunset that opened only 3 weeks ago? Hot damn! Cherylynn's review is so thorough that I don't need to bother with all the details. I just want to note that the nabemono sets include meat/seafood, noodles, and assorted vegetables paired with a broth. Your meal ends with a Zosui rice soup using the flavored broth from the cooking. Pricing is $18 per person for a regular portion, $22 per person for a large portion.\n\nThey also have a seasonal nabemono winter set called Kamonanban, which includes duck breast and Tokyo negi with Dashi broth, regular $23 and large $28.\n\nOur group of 9 entered the restaurant around 5:30 PM without a reservation, and we were lucky to nab the long communal table in the back. The restaurant can only seat 32, so I would definitely recommend a reservation during normal dining hours. Service is good, with multiple waitresses running around checking on things, refilling water, and asking if the group is ready for the Zosui rice. However, the entire endeavor is a bit time-consuming given the ingredient preparation, table stove heating, and rice porridge finale. Our group was there for TWO HOURS. Crazy.\n\nMy PDC family ordered 2 regular sets: the SUKIYAKI (Washugyu beef with a sweet Warishita broth) and the SHABU SHABU (Washugyu beef or Kurobuta pork with either traditional konbu or spicy miso broth). Our order came with 3 plates, one for each of the meats (15 slices of thinly sliced, beautifully marbled beef: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZwBukC0KhMXJKbmaNfKPFw/l.jpg, forgot to take a picture of the pork, oops) and another for the combined vegetables and udon (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oENOdFCIcUrOqzm1cSXdgg/l.jpg). The vegetable/udon plate came with chopped cabbage, baby spinach leaves, a few slices of squash, two slabs of tofu, enoki mushrooms, a quartered shiitake mushroom, a few carrot pieces in cute shapes, and udon noodles. To be honest, I wish they gave more vegetables because spinach severely shrinks :(\n\nSince the sukiyaki set came with Washugyu beef, we opted for the Kurobota pork in spicy miso broth, per my big's recommendation. When our pot came to our table, the vegetables were already swimming in it (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zp7qpP_MynVcMIw3wA0TQ/l.jpg). This gave the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, cabbage, carrots, chrysanthemum leaves, and these spotted, slightly-crunchy, translucent noodles more time to cook. We added the meats on par with our consumption; I enjoyed the beef and pork equally :)\n\nRegarding the broths, I definitely preferred the sukiyaki's Warishita. The sweetened soy base adds subtle undertones to the hot pot ingredients, although the spicy miso adds that kick most people enjoy with their meat. The sukiyaki also comes with a raw egg that you crack into a bowl and dip your meat and vegetables in. So strange! I loved the added creaminess hehe. Screw Salmonella.\n\nAfter all is eaten, a waitress scoops out some of your broth and adds in some rice to make this delicious porridge chock full of hot pot flavor. You can choose to split your rice between the two broths or have it half-half. We asked for half-half, and she let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes before returning to stir in the beaten egg, nori, and green onions. I definitely would vouch for the Warishita broth over the spicy miso broth because at the end of the stewing, the savoriness of the boiled ingredients blends harmoniously with the innate sweetness of the broth.\n\nMax 4-way credit card split, and make sure to let them know before the ring things up. Also, they have one bathroom hidden behind a curtain. It has a weird sliding door...\n\nAll in all, I would recommend 2 regular nabemono sets to be shared among 3 people. Both the SUKIYAKI and SHABU SHABU sets were fantastic, although I have a preference for the sukiyaki's broth and raw egg dip. I liked both the beef and the pork, and the beef is exceptionally marbled. And don't forget the Zosui rice porridge at the end! You're getting a real bang for your buck here ;)\n\nAlso, shout-out to the best family out there!", "author": "Adele F."}

We were a little late to our reservation at 6:30, but the waiter understood how terrible parking is around here (forrreal lol) and gave us the next available table. \n\nAfter yelping around I already knew I wanted the sukiyaki. I love sukiyaki broth because it's so sweet! My friend ended up going with miso broth shabu shabu (the waitress let us know they not only had spicy miso, but just miso as well). Our pot came and the sukiyaki vegetables and noodles were already in the soup pot that was being boiled. I didn't really mind, but it was definitely unconventional for me haha. The waitress came by and gave us our dipping sauce, and a raw egg for my sukiyaki. The dipping sauce (ponzu) here isn't really my taste.. It's too sour for me. My friend and I ended up asking for sesame/peanut sauce and thankfully, they had some! The only thing I didn't like about this place was that they don't give you a bowl of rice, and also I wish that the sukiyaki had the choice of the veggies already being in the pot, or given to you on a separate plate. The veggies were good though, they included lettuce, mushrooms, shirataki noodles, carrots, some greens I don't know the name of (looked like part of a spring mix lol) and pumpkin which I had never seen before at a shabu plate haha. \n\nThe meat came out fairly quickly and it was very neat, cut into little squares. The meat portion is okay, but for $18 I would expect a little more. The meat was delicious though!!! Good quality and super tender. I've seen on different yelp reviews that you're supposed to dip the meat into the broth and cook it, then into the raw egg mix, and then into a dipping sauce of your choice. I did just that and o m g I fell in love!!! I've never had it like that before, but now I want to order a raw egg at every shabu/hot pot place i'm at haha. \n\nAt the end of the meal we were told to pick one broth for the zosui, which is a \"meal finisher\" containing rice, egg, seaweed, and scallions. The waitress boiled our rice in the sukiyaki broth and took out some of the broth to even the ratio. Afterwards, she added in the scallions and poured the raw egg on top, and then finished it with the seaweed. My friend and I were really happy with the zosui!! Too bad we were so full that we couldn't finish it all.\n\nI will definitely be back!!

Nabe isn't an AYCE hot pot place but it does offer high quality meats and delicious soup bases for the same price. Unlike many of the Chinese hot pot restaurants in the area, Nabe serves Japanese-style shabu shabu. I love their spicy miso soup base and their wagyu beef is just amazing. I find their regular shabu shabu soup base a bit plain, but it could be just right for those who like a more clear broth with their hot pot. The porridge at the end is also quite awesome. They take the leftover soup and mix it with rice to give you a rice porridge. It tastes better with the more savory soup base so be sure to choose the soup of the friend with the more flavourful soup (it's one bowl per 2 people and the kimchi based soup base tastes best with the rice in my opinion). The only problem my friends and I have is that sometimes there's barely enough soup to mix with the rice cause we've used up so much of the soup to cook....\n\nIt does get quite cramped in the restaurant and you're relegated to waiting outside (even in the cold) for a table. The wait can be insane at times by the way,so be prepared.\n\nSome might find this expensive compared to the AYCE hot pots in the area.

The sukiyaki is my favorite and I would highly recommend their yam noodles. Their veggies are fresh and the meat looks relatively lean, and even though their portions don't look huge it's a lot of food. \n\nAt the end of the hot pot there's a rice finisher that's really interesting. It involves slightly more than just dumping a bowl of rice into the left over soup. They let the rice simmer down into a porridge and then add some toppings. A little too salty with a sukiyaki base but it's better with shabu shabu. For dessert their most popular seems to be the mochi cake which is what it sounds like, a blend of mochi into a piece of cake. You can choose your own ice cream on the side. I've tried the green tea and black sesame and both were really good. \n\nOnly downside to Nabe is that the service is a little slow. It was fine when we came for an early dinner but after 7pm it seems to fill up and it's difficult to catch the servers' attention.

While Nabe did just that, it really was pretty average and honestly not making a special trip back.\n\nFirst things first, Nabe is not AYCE shabu, which is why my bf and I came here in the first place. However, I'd say that going for AYCE shabu would probably be a better bet moneywise. All in all, after tax and tip, a large serving of shabu was at least $20. AYCE is not too much more than that, and you would get way more food.\n\nThat being said, the food was satisfying but nothing special. I was definitely disappointed with the serving size. My bf and I were ravenous, and I think without the bowl of rice and gyoza we ordered, we would have been hungry after. The meat itself looked like it was a good quality and the soup was tasty. The shabu shabu also comes with veggies such as napa cabbage, spinach, mushrooms, squash, and udon noodles.\n\nService was a little on the slow side considering how slow it was in the restaurant (we were one of two parties dining during lunch). However, there was only one waitress, so I guess I could understand. She was nice, but could have been a bit more attentive given the relative slowness of the time (she was in the back most of the time).\n\nIf you're from the city, you know how crazy parking can get around this area.

The staff is attentive and friendly despite the fact of how busy it gets. What caught my eye is the special porridge that they make at the end with the leftovers from your broth. However, what wowed me was the sesame sauce that they had, it was perfection. I would definitely come back again, Nabe's porridge and sesame sauce has a place in my heart! \n\nI came here after I called in asking if there was a wait. Shabu house had over a hour wait and luckily, Nabe said they had a table for two! Unfortunately when we arrived, the table that they thought would leave was still sitting there and ordered another plate... So we had to wait for around 15 minutes before we could get seated. It wasn't the servers fault since we did only call in and of course no promises were made without an reservation. \n\nOnce inside, the restaurant was TINY! There was a long table that ran down the middle of the restaurant with just a few tables on the side. I would've hated having to sit in the middle tables with a bunch of strangers all cramped up. Fortunately, my friend and I were seated in the tables on the side. But let's talk about the space (reason I took off a star)! There was barely any room for anyone to walk through and the servers had a hard time squeezing in between everyone as well. Also, I know the decor is simple and they want to keep it to a minimal given the size of the restaurant but I found it a by weird how no condiments were offered or set on the table.... \n\nI ordered the Shabu Shabu with the regular size Washugyu beef $19 (large $24.00) with traditional konbu (comes with a plate of veggies and udon). The traditional konbu is just water with seaweed so don't order it if you don't like a plain base! I like my broth plain so I could taste the real flavor of my beef and this was just right up my ally. But what came next was the sesame sauce and this was THE real game changer! I added this to my broth along with garlic and ahh, I was so in love!!! This sauce alone will make me come back and regarding the garlic, don't forget to ask for it or condiments because they don't have it set out nor do they mention it unless asked! \n\nLet's talk about that porridge though, so on point! Towards the end of the meal, a server will ask if you're ready for their porridge that is whipped up on the spot from one of your leftover broths. From there, the server will add a bowl of rice and set the heat to high. After a while, they will add some green onions, turn off the heat, and immediately mix it in with an egg. The end result is a nice, thick creamy consistency topped off with some shredded seaweed and voila, porridge is served! What an AMAZING and smart way to use up the remainder of the pot.

Yes, the food is delicious, the quality of the ingredients high, and the ambiance warm (sometimes literally - it gets steamy inside), but the service and care that the staff show make this place five star. They're usually very busy on weekend nights, but will try to accommodate walk-ins if they can. \n\nThey have five (or six?) options for meals. You pick a type of broth, and then you pick the meat. The different broths come with pre-picked veggies. My favorite dish is the Shabu Shabu spicy miso soup. The Shabu Shabu option means the veggies come on the side, and the diner places the veggies in the broth when desired. You can order extra meat or veggies (I sometimes get extra mushrooms or udon noodles for my Shabu Shabu) for extra. \n\nEach diner will pay approximately $19-24 for their meal, however, you can choose to order one broth with one set of meat and it will come to $19-24 for the table. If you choose to order two different meals/broths - and remember each comes with their own meat/veggies, each diner is charged for the meal. They have big pots that the broths come in, and they can split a pot to accommodate two orders if needed. At the end, the servers have the table choose a broth; the server adds rice, one egg, and green onions to the broth, and serve it to each diner with a small amount of seaweed on top. Delicious, and very filling.\n\nThe sake menu is extensive, though I stick with the Asahi 33 ounce beer (more than enough for two people). They also have appetizers, but having Shabu Shabu with the finishing rice bowl is more than enough. Enjoy!", "author": "S O."}

Dinner prices are a few dollars higher than their lunch equivalent, but they have the option of doing a split pot. So if you're here with a group of friends you can choose to do both shabu shabu and sukiyaki, or some other combination. \n\nThe meats were definitely not as fatty and therefore not as juicy and tender as the meat they serve at shabu house. But at the same time, this means they also have a lesser chance of giving you a heart attack later on in life. Their non-spicy soup is the traditional kombu soup. This soup is very very light. It is often mistaken for water with a piece of seaweed. Definitely a healthier, less-sodium alternative to the ginger chicken they have at Shabu house. At the end of the meal, the kombu soup will still taste amazing from all the beef you cooked in it. \n\nNabe's shabu dinner is $3 more expensive than shabu house's and the portions are a bit smaller, but instead of the ice cream they will make your soup into a zosui rice porridge at the end by adding rice, egg, and scallions. Definitely another nice traditional touch at the end.\n\ntip: Since the meats here are more lean, make sure you don't over cook it! You only need to dip the wagyu beef into the hot water for about 2 seconds. It's okay if parts of the meat are still slightly pink. Im sure most of you prefer your steaks medium rare-- it's a similar concept. if you cook it fully through it will definitely not taste as great. (you should do this at any shabu joint but it's especially important with leaner meats)", "author": "Annie Z."}

I came here with my dad and brother and we ordered the sukiyaki and the spicy miso shabu. The meat tastes really good and they give the perfect amount of food. The sukiyaki had a good variety of vegetables and noodles and both broths were really tasty. One part I liked the most about this place is the porridge they make after your done with one of the leftover broths. We got there when it opened at 5 and it was not crowded at all.

I absolutely loved our first time experience here.  \n\nThe dining space is small with a simple, clean decor; sake bottles adorn one big wall of the restaurant.  The wait time could be long due to limited seating.  I would recommend making reservations in advance or at least calling ahead to be put on the wait list.\n\nI ordered a Nabemono Set:  Sukiyaki.  This set contained Wagyu beef sliced thinly, assorted vegetables and shirataki noodles in a Warishita broth.  I substituted the noodles for, mochi (rice cakes).  The added mochi reminded me of the Japanese New Year, where this would be commonplace for the Japanese.  The broth had a sweet soy sauce flavor; it was delicious!\n\nAccompanying my meal was a glass of cold sake, Konteki, \"Tears of Dawn\":  sweet rice & banana.  Instead of being an anticipated sweet sake, it was more in the lines of a Margarita, where it was salty.  As I drank it along with my meal and as the alcohol slowly took effect, it no longer tasted so salty.  \n\nThe big surprise of the evening was what they call the \"final course\", the zosui.  With the remaining broth in your hot pot, your waitress will add a bowl of rice, a raw egg, nori and green onions.  Stirring it all up results in a delicious porridge-like dish.  Too bad I was absolutely satiated, or else I would've enjoyed the zosui a little more; that ended up being the Togo dish.\n\nI enjoyed both my meal and the new experience here.

I ordered the Kimchi + Kurobata Pork Belly and the hubby ordered the Shabu Shabu.  The food was a solid 4 stars, but I wish the broth was a bit spicier.  I get hesitant to cook/order pork sometimes since it has to be cooked through if you don't want to get sick.  I liked that the pork belly are cut thinly so it's easy to cook.  My favorite part of the meal was  the Zosui rice soup served at the end of the meal.  They basically take out all the leftovers you have in your pot, then add in the rice, egg, seaweed, and green onions.  It's very unique!

I do wish they had those fish balls or those other familiar hot pot items, but it was great for the most part. \n\nAt the end, after you're all done with your food, they add rice and make it into a porridge.

Most other hot pot restaurants only serve one style of hot pot (just sukiyaki etc).\n\nParking around the area can be hard some times. There's usually a wait if you go around dinner hours and they don't really have waiting space so you kind of have to stand outside or just wander around the area. They will call you if you leave your number on the wait list.\n\nThis is really my go-to place if I crave generic hot-pot. I get a nabemono set every time I go. I'm a fan of their Kimchi  Kurobata pork belly and shabu shabu sets. I'm not a huge fan of their seafood yosenabe mostly because everything just ends up tasting fishy in it...\n\nWhen you're done with your hot pot, they'll bring a bowl of rice and eggs to mix into your left over soup and make zosui rice which is really tasty.

I love how their sets come with different ingredients, switching up the vegetables and starches to complement the broth of your choosing. \n\nThe sukiyaki broth is unique for shabu but Nabe does it well! I'm always skeptical of sukiyaki because often times it can be too sweet. Nabe achieved the perfect balance of sweet and savory. Ingredients were very fresh - the mushrooms, sliced tofu were my favorite and love that they give you an egg to crack into the soup. Despite all of the ingredients in the broth upon serving, nothing was overcooked as the servers were attentive and made sure to turn the heat down several times for us throughout the meal. We also had the spicy miso shabu at our table and were very pleased with that as well. \n\nAs for meat quality, the wagyu beef was not as good as I've had at other shabu places (a little lacking in the fatty marbling) but the pork belly was delicious. \n\nMake sure to save room for the Zosui finisher where they create a porridge-like soup for you at the table using one of your leftover broths! The server brought out rice, egg, and nori and we chose to have it mixed into our sukiyaki broth. Yum! \n\nWe also tried the wagyu and kimchi dumplings but they were nothing to write home about. We'll just stick to the shabu sets next time we come as it is more than enough to fill you up.\n\nService was very attentive and the waiter made helpful beer recommendations.

After looking through the pictures of the place on Yelp, we decided to make a reservation which turned out to be a good idea because right when we got to the place there was already a table waiting for us. The staff were very friendly and nice and answered all our questions regarding the menu.\n\nThe food was really good in my opinion. My dad got the shabu shabu with wagyu beef with miso (not spicy) broth and I got the kimchi hot pot with kurobuta pork belly and mochi. We also got a side of rice (one split between the two of us), harusame noodles, tofu, shiitake mushrooms, and duck (the side order of duck which was $16 isn't listed on the menu). They also have the sesame dipping sauce, which we also asked for as well as it isn't automatically given to you. The ponzu sauce was more tart than other places I've been too but I thought it was great. I really liked the flavors of both broths and the pork and the beef portions were pretty decently sized. Though neither of us thought the side order of duck was worth it, it was an interesting try. \n\nThe best part of the meal for me was the zosui rice soup. They take rice, a beaten egg, and green onions and throw it into your broth that you cooked all your food in (in this case we had a choice between miso and kimchi, and we chose miso). They serve it in your individual bowls and top it with nori strips. I didn't really know what to expect but it ended up being very flavorful (even though it was the miso broth and not the kimchi broth) and I ate the whole bowl even though I was pretty full from the main meal. When you get the soup it is BLAZING HOT so take your time eating it... and don't worry if you don't finish everything in the pot! They'll give you the rest in a take-out container.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is what's bringing down the rating to 4 stars. It's a small place and everyone is having hot pot, so of course it was hot and a bit stuffy. When we walked in my dad mentioned that his glasses fogged up, and maybe it's better right when they open, but I thought it smelled kind of sweaty. It was great that we made a reservation because we had a table for two in the corner of the restaurant (I'm not a fan of sharing my space and sitting next to strangers).\n\nTheir bathroom is pretty nice inside. The door is a sliding door which even though I thought was pretty cool, was pretty embarrassing when I was standing outside the bathroom door for longer than 15 seconds trying to figure to whether there was someone in there or not.\n\nOverall our meals ended up being pretty pricey (no thanks to the side of duck) but I'd come back again.", "author": "Jennifer J."}

I trust your reviews more than MBauer!\n\nSpeaking of Bauer...thanks a lot buddy for outing what was supposed to be a \"secret\" good spot in your blog today. And now that restaurant thanks you too for so much exposure. The unintended consequence is that now they will get a lot of \"know it all's\", the hipsters who got charged after watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, will now become Hipster dreams of Douchey, bringing their Tila Tequila type Asian girlfriends to show off more sushi knowledge. If you cringed when Carrie's boyfriend in Sex and the City said \"Sake to Me baby\" when she ordered sake, there's more BS in the works. Bauer, why don't you all do us a favor and go to Sawa Sushi instead and stay there :-*( ? \n\nAnyways, I'm just going to throw it out there that maybe 85+% of Chinese and Asian Americans don't understand traditional Japanese hot pot category of food (nabemono). To them, shabu shabu particularly the all you can eat bonanza's (which I affectionately term SHA BOO), Da Been Lo, kuo guo, Little Sheep, etc etc are either all the same to them, and/ or they find shabu shabu bland as hell, and thus require spicy miso broths in their ramen...and now shabu shabu. And of course what hotpot is complete without a sucka MC remix your own jive ass sauce experience. In a world where subtle natural flavors = no flavor, variety is their spice of life, at the expense of what it should really be. Thus crap becomes the norm.\n\nThe essence of something like shabu shabu, should be an emphasis on the season, the seasonality of ingredients (as well as their quality and original taste)...plus having a cast iron hot pot of homey comforting food, to be shared with family or friends, is not just fun, but warms your heart. Spicy miso broth would in essence destroy that essence of original flavor. This is where premium quality beef, boiled in konbu broth, dipped in ponzu with scallions, momiji oroshi or ginger, is sufficient and elegant.\n\nBut not the SHA BOO BS.\n\nSo for Nabe to come in and pretty much do things right, and still give it a unique Japanese feel, right here in a city of wrong (and wrong food), is commendable. \n\nThe interior is certainly interesting....swanky, yet very Japanese. Love the various bottles of sake plastered on the walls, and even the logo \"Nabe\" has that Orenchi-esque vibe to it.\n\nBut us FOB types are really here for the food.\n\nDidn't get a chance to try the other pots yet, but I very much enjoyed the shabu shabu experience here, even though many are recommending the sukiyaki.\n\nHere's what you can expect with a Shabu Shabu here:\n\nIf you are a traditionalist, the kelp/konbu broth is more than just \"traditional water\". There are humongous pieces of konbu in here. Way more than what the competition provides. Or if you have seen the version at Zabu in San Mateo, they throw in a few pieces of seaweed and call it a day, not kelp.\n\nThe plate of mixed veggies you get is of pretty good quality, but if you have more in your party you want to upgrade to extra veggies (combo platter include abura age/tofu pouches, which soaks up the broth), shimeji mushrooms (and king oyster). Ingredients are organic where possible, and this makes a huge difference in the overall experience. \n\nFor pork there are choices of belly or shoulder.... while belly is the popular obvious choice, the shoulder cut is actually quite excellent in its own right. The beef quality here is better than Shabuway (which is better than those SHA BOO house of worship and AYCE AYCDrink excess, like a Roman orgy or Yelp Elite event from 2005).\n\nThe dip sauces have some thought put into it. The ponzu has a strong citrus accent than other places, and default one comes with momiji oroshi (minced grated daikon that has a slight spicy kick) and finely chopped scallions. Still very Japanesey. Didn't try the sesame dip, but it looked good.\n\nEven a bowl of rice in here, tastes like a good Japanese restaurant's prep.\n\nWhile I have yet to try Yosenabe, Sukiyaki, I have no doubt those will be done quite nicely too.

There weren't any instructions and we just saw everything divided by category so my friend and I assumed you just ordered what you wanted. Turns out you actually order a broth and a meat platter to go with it in either regular or large size. The other downside here was that the waitress was somewhat inattentive. We had to ask for tea 4 times before we got it- this was on a Sunday afternoon where there were a total of 3 parties here. \n\nThe meat and veggie platters were decent and I was surprised that we had broth choices (regular, miso, and spicy miso) as that's not something I see at a lot of shabu joints. The broth was very salty at first but as you added more meats the taste watered down to something you could sip on. If you are in any ways hungry, I recommend you order a large platter of meat. That may not even be enough. My friend and I ordered a total of 3 large and 1 regular platter of meat and I still think we left somewhat hungry.", "author": "Philip W."}

I like that they cut their carrots into flower shapes. That's kind of cute.  The soup also needs more noodles. There are maybe ten strands. I mean come one!

I enjoyed eating the seafood yosenabe because it has  plentiful amounts of seafood and shellfish.  One thing to note is that unlike other shabu places, you do not have rice on your side until the end when they mix it in the broth. \nBy the time we finished both pots, I was pretty full and content The waitress was very nice and even offered to help take a picture of us. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back again for lunch to try their other pots and hopefully, those next visits will help make me forget about that first visit...", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I totally didn't see this place until i pulled up google maps trying to look for the address. \n\nThe exterior design of the place looks like a warehouse with 2 overly fogged windows. You literally cannot see inside from the outside if the temps outside is around 50F. Also the signs aren't that noticeable if you don't pay attention to the fusion Japanese style fonts. \n\nInterior is nicely done but very small. The walls are decored with sake/alcohol bottles. Seating is very straightforward and crowded. Feels like I didn't have enough room and the plates were all over the place. The seating next to us has their meat plate right next to mine (it's like, i should eat over). \n\nMeat quality was okay. Shabu Shabu order didn't have the best beef quality. Even with 5-7 seconds of quick dip, it was a little hard to bite into. Not to mention, zero marble in the meat. As far the pork belly, that was a little better, but I believe that pork slices should be a tad thicker since it can give you a little more taste (personal preference).  \n\nAs far as soup quality, nothing too special here. Kimchi bowl just had kimchi and some tofu + spices. Nothing you can't pull off at home. Miso side was just miso, bland and maybe even a little boring. \n\nBest part of the whole dinner was the last bowl of rice. The waitress introduced something called the zosui (but in chinese terms, it's congee). Basically they put a bowl of rice into any side of the soup you prefer. Add an egg and then sprinkle chopped green onions and some seaweed. Let it cook for a few minutes and you have a rich bowl of zosui. Super high cholesterol, but what gives... \n\n- too crowded, no waiting area except outside. hard to find parking as well. \n- air quality has miso smell all over. stuffy and hard to breath since there's no air condition or fans. maybe this is why the windows were all fogged up. \n+ service was excellent", "author": "Eric Y."}

It is very very cosy and a good place for a laidback dinner with a couple of friends. I wouldn't recommend coming with more than a group of four because this place is tiny. We waited about 40 minutes and there were only one or two groups ahead of us.\n\nAll of us ordered the shabu shabu; it comes with your choice of spicy miso, regular miso, or kombu broth. I opted for the kombu; they give a good amount of kombu whereas other places I've been will only give a tiny square to flavor the broth. The shabu shabu is $14 for lunch and $20 for dinner. It comes with your choice of wagyu beef or Kurobuta pork, udon, and an assortment of veggies, all nicely cut and of good quality. My only gripes would be that you have to ask for rice instead of it being given automatically, and that they charge for shungiku. I think for an authentic shabu shabu joint, at least a couple leaves of shungiku should be automatic. Anyways, the meat was pretty high quality, tender, and cooks very quickly. The ponzu sauce was really delicious, the sesame sauce just so-so. I like the bottled goma-shabu I can buy at the supermarket better to be honest. However, the rice finisher at the end is really a nice touch and a perfect end to the meal. The 33 oz Asahi is a perfect pairing with all of this too.\n\nAll in all I had a very good meal. I took one star off because of the above issues, and because of the lack of waiting area; the entrance door pushes inwards so it's easy to hit people who are waiting indoors. Also, the ventilation is really poor so it's just really stuffy and humid in the restaurant. However, I would definitely come back for some quality shabu shabu.", "author": "Elaine W."}

But the flavor was very good (especially the kimchi broth), so I would have given it 3.5/4 stars based on this. But the problem was the service. The waitresses were all friendly, but they rushed us...A LOT. I understand that it was a weekend evening, but from the start of the meal until the very end, they kept trying to either push us to order or take away our food or at the very end, actually asked us to leave. I certainly felt rushed at the end when they came to make the rice porridge, but the worst part was when we had paid for our food and just wanted to sit a bit to figure out where to go next without having to navigate outside in the cold and were asked (nicely) to leave for the next customers.

What you get seems skimpy for what you pay, and while it doesn't taste bad, it does little to convince you that it's worth the money. \n\nCramped, poorly ventilated, close quarters. The only way to avoid feeling like you're in a sauna is to have the front door open, which ticks off the people in the room who feel cold easily. \n\nStrange menu. They devote a lot of effort into pushing you down set meat and broth combinations, requiring each table to lock into at least one. It's an absurd practice... just let us pick broths and order what we want off the menu. We ended up with way too few vegetables and noodles. \n\nAlso: one of the broths (kimchee) came with its vegetables and tofu already floating in it. It was odd... I thought the point of Shabu was do-it-yourself at your own pace. \n\nVery understaffed. The place is small, but it was packed. There was one waiter and one food runner for about ten tables with about 30 customers. Getting our reserved table was slow. Getting the order in was slow. Everything was slow. Our dinner for four people took over 2:15. \n\nThere were two things that kept this place from getting a 1-star review:\n\n- While the spicy miso broth wasn't spicy at all, the kimchee broth was delicious. An unexpected and very pleasant twist. \n\n- At the end of the meal, you pick one of your broths and they make a rice porridge out of it at your table. We picked the kimchee broth. It was excellent. And you couldn't help but feel for the lone waiter as he made our porridge thanking us for our patience with the service. They should have more staff on the floor, but man that porridge rocked. \n\nIt's only fair I should mention that while nobody in our party was gushingly joyful about our meal, I was the only person in the group who was this dissatisfied with the experience. \n\nOverall, though: you want some Shabu?

Instead, most of what you're going to have is already in the pot, with the exception of the mochi and rice sides. And, after you're done with your meats, rather than noodles, you can have them use one of the remaining broths to make zosui (rice porridge/congee).\n\nOkay food overall, with nothing standing out in particular. And their zosui, unfortunately, is unbearably salty, unlike other places I've been to that offer this. Your choice of broth will certainly have something to do with this, but my recommendation is to have the zosui made, and then packed to go so you can dilute it back at home with more rice and water/plain stock.

The staff was very accommodating and brought us out another whole bowl with just the non-spicy soup base we liked. \n\nThe only down side is that dining area is pretty small, so I would suggest making an RSVP before coming here. Also, if you don't mind sharing a pot, it is cheaper to buy one set meal, then add extra meat or vegetables on the side. the portions for the side purchases are the same as the portions provided in the main meal. \n\nAlso, don't forget to save room in your stomach for the last dish, which is basically porridge made from the remaining soup base from your meal with some extras.", "author": "Rex R."}

The nori topping is very flakey, powder almost and I got a face-full.

We had a reservation and got there a bit late due the craziness of parking in the area. I walked in and BOOM my glasses immediately fogged up! It was like a hot sauna in there because there are no windows and so much hot-potting going on!  This was a terrible day to wear my glasses - I should've just gone with contacts!  Anyway, moving on - Our table wasn't ready yet, but it's such a small space, I can understand that it's hard to predict customer flow. After about 15 minutes, we were seated. By that time, my glasses had gotten accustomed to the temperature inside, so I could actually SEE across the table at my food and my date now. \n\nOrder: I had to get the beef shabu shabu with spicy miso broth (to compare with all other shabu places, you know?).  My bf got the duck shabu in soy sauce broth.  My beef was sliced very thin and was very nicely marbled, but without any gross chewy fat. It came with a plate full of veggies and noodles.  The spicy broth was a medium spicy, something that I could handle but that my bf also felt had some kick to it.  To my surprise, the duck was also amazing. It came with everything already in the pot and I was worried that the duck was going to overcook before we could eat it all, but the last bite was just as tender as the first.  Plus, all the veggies in there were soaked with so much flavor by the end, especially the tofu! Save some room though because when you think you're done with the meal, they bring out the rice, egg, and scallions and make an amazing porridge out of your favorite broth. We chose the spicy miso and did not regret it!  I will be making this porridge at home...\n\nService: The staff here was super communicative during our wait, and friendly and attentive during our meal.  It was also very nice of them to make the porridge for us. \n\nPro tips: Save some room for the porridge at the end!  Parking here can also be crazy so try to get here a little early.

I suggested that we try some place new--and so we both agreed on Nabe. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by one of the servers and he allowed us to choose our table since the restaurant wasn't too packed. After being seated, another server came by and kindly explained the menu thoroughly to us. Apparently, the restaurant serves nabemonos(aka nabe) and not your basic shabu. On their menu, there was a list of different nabe sets and our server explained that all sets but the shabu shabu set(yes, it's still an option here!) come with a pot of broth that already contains most of the paired items inside of the pot--whereas for the shabu shabu set, the meat, noodles, and veggies are all given separately. I wanted shabu at the start because I wanted to cook my own food yakno, so we ordered the shabu shabu set with beef and miso broth and the kimchi with pork belly set. Now let's break it down:\n\nFood-Super yummy! The shabu shabu set was like other shabu I've had--but still good. The kimchi set was my fav *o* The bae also agreed that the kimchi was also his fav, hehe. The level of spiciness of the broth was perfect. I love eating spicy food even though I can't handle it well LOL, but it was still bearable. Pork belly of course was good, obvi. Best part about the kimchi set was that it came with little mochi cubes instead of noodles!! When we cooked it in the broth, it became squishy and just amazingggg. \n\nBest part of the meal had to be the rice finisher. When we were done eating, our server asked if we were ready for the rice finisher and I was like \"Okay!\", but then bae and I looked at each other like huh?? She came back with rice, egg, seaweed and green onions and explained to us that the rice finisher(zosui?) is served at the end of each meal. We chose to have it prepared in the kimchi broth and omg, it was so good. It is basically rice soup/porridge/jook/chao/whatever you wanna call it--but better. You can say that we both left with with a food baby.\n\n\nEnvironment- The restaurant layout is really cute and compact. Not many tables and the aisles were quite small, but still walkable. Everything looks clean and simple. Although the restaurant was sort of empty when we got there, by the end of our meal, the restaurant was SUPER packed and it got pretty humid inside of the restaurant. \n\n\n\nService-EXCELLENT! Although there were only 2 servers and there was a full house, both were very attentive and were super friendly. Our cups of tea were never empty and they checked up on us here and there.\n\n\n\nOverall, I'd say my first visit to Nabe was enjoyable and will most def return!", "author": "Krisna T."}

We decided on Nabe, which turned out to be an awesome choice! The decor was really nice with minimal wooden frames and metal accents. The wall of sake was a fancy touch to an already cool looking restaurant. My party and I ordered 3 shabu sets - spicy miso, sukiyaki, and kimchi broths. The spicy miso and sukiyaki were the best of the 3. The kimchi flavored broth didn't have enough of that spicy and pungent kimchi kick. Each set comes with a side of the per usual veggies you would find at shabu. I.e. Tofu, enoki mushroom, Napa cabbage, spinach, and cute little stars cutout of carrots. We ordered the wagyu beef and pork belly. Both meat selections were delicious, although, the pork belly was cut a little too thin and didn't have much texture. The beef definitely went faster than the pork, as it had a better chewy texture. What sets Nabe apart from other shabu houses was their plate presentations of the food and how extremely clean the place was.

Also I really enjoyed the porridge they made at the end of the dinner because it really filled us up and was a nice way to end our meal. It's really cool how there prepare the porridge in front of you! I liked the overall meal presentation, unfortunately, I would have preferred to share two broths instead of ordering four separate ones because 1) it would have been cheaper 2) I didn't really care for the other broths.

One of the nice things they do is they allow neighbors (or I suppose anyone) call ahead and put their name down on the waiting list. Normally when my family and I do this, we only have to wait a few minutes for our table but this recent experience was not like that. I called and spoke to the hostess who told me that it would be no problem for a group of 4, at most we would wait 20 minutes. My grandma and I headed over to the restaurant only to find out that the restaurant had two reservations for 4 booked and therefore would be seated ahead of us. This would have been great to know before leaving the house... We would have happily come later if we had know about these reservations... So instead, my 85 year old grandmother and I waited outside in 50 degree weather for over an hour... The hostess kept telling me it would only be a bit longer... Just a bit longer... If I knew it was going to be an hour, I would have gone elsewhere!! \n\nWhen we finally got seated, the hostess dumped our menus on the table and rushed away... After waiting so long, I was just ready to order! When she finally came back we ordered 4 shabu shabu dinners. She asked if we wanted rice, and I asked if we could have udon instead. (Shabu House lets us do this all the time.) She shortly answered no and left us. When I mentioned that we had been waiting over an hour for our table, she wasn't apologetic at all. \n\nThe only thing that turned this night around was the waitress who took over our table. Nancy is the best!! She has been my server before and is always so nice! If it weren't for her, this review would have been more like 2 stars for the horrendous service by the hostess. Nancy was so great! She promptly brought our food and was very attentive. Most Shabu places will dump your food and won't check in with you until the end of your meal. I want to personally thank Nancy for going above and beyond! You really turned our night around! Thank you! And we will be back soon!", "author": "Taylor W."}

First time trying shabu and it was amazing!\n\nFound this spot on Yelp some time ago while building my list of hotspots to check out in the city and dragged a friend to eat here with me so I'm not one of those sad people that consciously eat alone. We came in right when they opened for dinner time, so there wasn't anybody else other than just the two of us.\n\nWe ordered the Shabu Shabu and split it between the both of us because we were still digesting our lunch and didn't think we had the room in our stomachs to order our own sets. Being a first-timer, I didn't have anything to compare it to, so I'd say that I was satisfied and enjoyed the meal! I wasn't particularly pleased with the portions of the noodle add-ons, but you get a lot of other things to compensate for it.\n\nWhatever soup is left they use to make the rice porridge, which I wasn't a big fan of because I didn't feel too comfortable eating the soup that we just dipped a bunch of crap in and who knows what's stewing in alla that. It's like putting rice into the leftover soup from a packet of ramen, it just didn't click with me. The server said it was her favorite part of the meal, but if baby food was her forte, then I guess.", "author": "Peter L."}

The kimchi broth already comes with all the veggies within the broth whereas the Shabu Shabu provided you a platter of veggies for you to cook at your own pace. We also ordered a side of clams in case the food was not enough.\n\nThe portions were just right for 2 people and I enjoyed being able to try two different broths and two different styles of cooking but ultimately, we enjoyed the kimchi broth the most so when it came time for the Zosui Finisher, we chose the kimchi broth.\n\nI wish all shabu places in the city provided a Zosui Finisher as it is the ultimate way to have a flavorful porridge in case you were still hungry. I will definitely be back here for more especially with their cool decor of empty customer sake bottles hung all over the walls.\n\nFood Highlight: Zosui Finisher with the KimChi Broth\n\nP.S. - The bathroom is hidden behind curtains in the middle of the room along the wall so make sure to ask before walking towards/into the kitchen lol", "author": "Rich L."}

The sukiyaki broth and raw egg dip is what I always order and is a must-try. The raw egg dip kinda caramelizes the meat and complements the broth flavor and beef very well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-25", "description": "I adore this place. I'm normally more of a hot pot (Chinese style) fan than shabu shabu (Japanese) as the options for broth and everything that goes into it is far more varied in hot pot, but Nabe is something special.\n\nIt is a little on the pricey side but the quality of meat, noodles, and vegetables are all high quality. I've tried most of the broth and my favorite would have to be the spicy miso. Konbu is a little bland while the kimchi one is a little sour for my tastes. I always get the medium spicy miso broth for size and order extra meat and noodles if there are more people. The udon noodles are fresh and delicious while the pork has just the right amount of marbling.\n\nIf it hasn't been raved about already, the best part of the meal is the zosui rice, aka THE FINISHER. I can never go back to other shabu places as most places do not do the zosui. After you've finished your meal and the broth is wonderfully flavored with the meat and vegetable, they take a little bit of rice and egg and let it simmer to a wonderful jook, congee, rice soup, whatever you would like to call it. Top it off with scallions and nori and it is a PERFECT cup of the most flavorful rice soup/stew you could possibly taste. I love it so much that I wish they would just sell this part. \n\nIf you have room for dessert at this point they have a delicious housemade mochi cake with green tea that I highly recommend.\n\nThe wait during weekdays is minimal to none but on the weekends I would recommend calling ahead to be seated. The service is great, they're attentive and make the rice soup on the spot for you.", "author": "Kate M."}

I don't get many chances to eat vegetarian hot but but the fact there are more than one option for me is always a draw to return. The shiitake broth with our hot pot was very flavorful and tasted great as leftovers in rice porridge form.

It is very different than any other shabu places I have been to in SF.\nFirst off the waiter, explained the different types of soup bases. Which was nice because there are about 6 different choices to choose from. Once we ordered we waited for our food to arrive. The pots took awhile to come out. When the pots finally came, all the veggies were already inside the pot which was different than any other shabu places. I didn't really like the fact that they put the veggies in the pot for you because you can't control what you want to eat first. It also sucks when you order the seafood option because the seafood is already in the pot when it arrives. The seafood is all done at the same time and you feel like you have to rush to eat the seafood.\nThe best soup base was the shabu shabu spicy miso. The sukiyaki base was a bit too sweet.\nAt the very end they take your left over soup base and make a porridge with it. This does take time so if you are in a rush to leave you should probably skip this. It takes time to cook the rice and soup together. We got spicy miso and sukiyaki base and the spicy miso base was the best! The sukiyaki was even more sweet than before. We were lucky the waiter allowed us to get both because he said normally they only do one soup base. \nOverall this place is just ok. Slightly different than any other shabu place I have been too.\nOh I forgot to mention, that the meat comes on the side. Once the meat is cooked, it shrinks up and looks like a brain!

Lunch does not come with the Zosui rice finisher, so don't expect it. Lunch time is suppose to be quick so I understand why they don't offer it. Their lunch menu had something new! They have this thing called HAMBAGU! No, not hamburger... HAMBAGU! Like a hamburger steak kinda thing. Two different sauces to choose from and both were DELICIOUS! Maybe they could add that to their diner menu, cause I would order it. \n\nDINNER is just as excellent as everyone says it is. Plus the Zosui rice finisher of course. This was when the servers really made the experience top notch! As they are standing there making the Zosui for my table, they talked to us and taught us quite a few things. The difference between Japanese hotpot and Chinese hotpot...(Japanese hotpot is way better!) The boxes on the walls (Great way to include the customers into their decorations, I will definitely purchase a bottle of sake just so I can be on the wall.) And of course, they explained what the Zosui actually was (It's not something that they just came up with themselves...though its delicious!) \n\nSERVICE is beyond excellent! Even though they get swamped, you can tell that they really care about your dining experience with them. I overheard the tables around me that it was their first time doing hotpot and the servers took their time to explain everything to them. If I were a first time hotpotter, I would greatly appreciate their help because they really did explain EVERYTHING. (The tables next to us, I guess never cooks?

Of course I was excited to try the latest and greatest shabu restaurant in SF.  Did it live up to it's hype?  Heck yes!  The food was delicious.  We tried the appetizers - sausage, edamame, and gyoza.  The sausages were a hit.  Paired with nice mustard aioli dipping sauce.  \n\nI was eagered to try the shabu.  The broth was different with a nice sweet and spicy kick.  The beef was deliciously buttery and cut into perfect sized pieces so that it was easy to consume.  A nice generous portion of veggies were part of the dinner, including two types of mushrooms.  Score!  One of the best parts, the end of the meal congee the servers prepare for you.  Delicious and hearty way to end a delicious dinner.  The venue is smaller so it may get packed, especially on cold nights.  Make a reservation in advance, if you can.\n\nWill I be returning?

Wasn't too sure what to expect since this place just opened and walking by, the whole window was steamy on the inside. The decor is really nice. A bit small and cramped-looking, but welcoming. I really like the different sake bottles aligned along the wall.\n\nWe were greeted and seated very quickly after arriving around 8pm. The waitress asked if it was our first time and it was, so she explained the menu to us. A bit confusing at first, but definitely different from other shabu/hot pot places which made me even more excited!\n\nI wasn't that hungry but my friend was so we agreed to share. We ordered the large kimchi&pork belly option was was $22 for large. $18 for regular size. We also ordered the gyoza which comes with 6 pieces for $7. Our gyoza came out fairly quickly. We took a bite into it and noticed that it was still pink inside, so we told the waitress. She quickly took it to the back and sincerely apologized and asked if there was any other appetizer we would like on the house since they undercooked it. She then gave us a recommendation that she liked the sausages, so we agreed to get that. Our broth with all of the vegetables, kimchi, mushrooms, etc. came out shortly after and we waited for it to boil. The broth wasn't as tasteful as I hoped, but it was good.\n\nThe sausages came out shortly after that and I really enjoyed it! I also liked the sauce because it complimented it well.\n\nAlso, it was our mistake for not realizing the order we chose came with pork belly and not beef, so when we asked our waitress, she kindly took our plate back and served us beef instead of pork belly. Another plus! The beef was a soft and not too chewy texture, just the way I like it.\n\nAt the end when we're done, there is also a finishing rice dish that we thought was pretty cool. It was definitely original because I have never seen it before anywhere else. You have to see and taste it in order to know what I'm talking about! I don't normally like rice that much, but I really really enjoyed the end to this meal. It was like a sort of porridge texture, but with so much flavor! It amazed me how much I enjoyed it because I didn't enjoy the kimchi broth itself in the beginning.\n\nAlso, thinking that they would only give us complimentary sausages for the gyoza incident.. NOPE! They gave us the gyoza as well which surprised me. When we received our bill, we thought that they would've only given us the sausages for free but they also voided our gyoza! A simple apology and remaking the item would've satisfied me but their customer service skills really amazed me. I wish more experiences like this would happen more often!\n\nI will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu!", "author": "Valerie T."}

We came in for an earlier dinner, around 5:45 p.m. and the place was empty, so we were seated immediately.  The waitress gave us the menus and our group of five decided to share a few items.  At first it was a bit confusing trying to figure out how much food to order, but it all worked out in the end.  Anyway, about the food.  The regular orders are $19 and large orders are $24.  Special items, like the duck, are $24 for a regular size and $29 for the large.\n\n-Shabu (spicy miso): this was probably my favorite of the broths.  It was a nice amount of spice for me, but some others found it to be a little spicy.  \n-Shabu (traditional): pretty average/good.\n-Kimchi and pork belly: I have never actually had kimchi in broth, so this was a new experience for me.  It tasted pretty good.  Just make sure you like kimchi.\n-Duck breast and dashi broth: this broth tasted pretty similar to the traditional shabu broth.  I enjoyed the duck breast and there were probably about 8-10 pieces.  This one also came with mochi, which I have never had in broth, so that was pretty good.\n\nWe didn't realize before, but after the meal, they make a rice porridge with the leftover broth.  You get to pick which broth you want and it's a nice way to fill up, if you haven't already.  They mix in rice, egg and green onions.  The whole thing is pretty good, though we were stuffed already.  Make sure that you try the broth out before they cook it down further- because it can get really salty.  We didn't and the whole thing was kind of a salty mess.\n\nThe whole dining experience lasted for about 1.5 hours.  The staff was pretty helpful overall, though at times they were hard to track down for utensils, water or tea refills.  Also, the staff did seem pretty new/inexperienced, so I'll cut them a break.  I have a feeling that this could go up to 4 stars if they work on training the staff a little better.    \n\nNote: this is a place that will have you smelling like the food when you leave.", "author": "Samantha L."}

For a weekday night, we were glad we made reservations, because it got packed quick. \n\nWe got seated right away, thanks to our reservations, and looked at the menu. It wasn't the easiest menu to understand, but the waitress explained it well enough for us to half spicy miso and half sukiyaki soup base. The dinner comes with a plate of veggies and your choice of beef, pork or lamb. I liked that the sukiyaki soup base came with loads of veggies already in the broth, but, it was little on the sweeter side. The spicy miso broth wasn't too spicy and tasted delicious. The beef plate was fresh and not too fatty. The pork was a little dry for my taste, but some of my friends liked it a lot. \n\nThe atmosphere was very modern and had unique sake dispenser decor along the walls. It wasn't too noisy in there and I didn't feel too suffocated like I usually do in other shabu, hot pot places. Everything was very clean and organized.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and dining experience here and would definitely come back again to try different soup bases.

It's traditionally a cold soup so it'll take awhile to heat up.\nIt was VERY tasty, a deep flavor..it smells like typical udon soup but it taste very sweet (not in the candy way) and very savory at the same time. SO YUMMY!! It comes with an egg and thats it. But I've seen other people around me where they had ramen come with their order! The beef, no doubt, was very tasty. \n\nAnd like everyone else has said, the service is impeccable. The three waitresses rotationally came by every 3 mins or so .. I guess some people might not like it because they really came too often (probably because the restaurant is so small) but nevertheless, they were very attentive and patient in explaining their menu!\n\nMy favorite part was the RICE/porridge at the end! If you're not that hungry and you just want to try this place between you and your date, getting a large will fill you guys up. The rice at the end, where they put in another egg, seaweed bits and green onions is so good and filling. I think this broth was a PERFECT pairing with the rice at the end. ..and if you run out of broth, they'll gladly add more water for you and it won't dilute the flavor! \n\nShabu shabu at its best, good pricing and delicious food.

The defining difference between this and standard hot pot, to me, is that they make a \"porridge\" at the end, using rice to soak up your remaining broth and ingredients. It's something I could do at home with a $2 bag of rice and a chicken bouillon cube, but I don't mind paying $30 for this restaurant to do it for me.\n\nThat's because this place has a sleek, minimalist ambiance, made even better because it's infrequently busy. I can come in here on a weeknight and actually enjoy talking to someone I brought. The servers, bless them, always note my fresh-off-the-boat expression and give my table lots of attention and pointers.\n\nThe food has not exactly been my preference on both my trips.

So if you plan to come here anytime soon and it's your first time, remember to not get super full from the shabu shabu itself!\n\nSome of my favorite broths include\n- Kimchi + Kurobuta Pork Belly - I love how the kimchi spice isn't overpowering all the other flavors in the pot. Plus, I also love the included mochis. Don't put them in the pot for too long, or else it becomes a blob that is so mushy you won't be able to pick it up with any of the provided utensils. \n- Shabu Shabu with Wagyu beef in spicy miso broth - my bf and I love anything spicy. So we had to do a spicy option with something beefy. This was the perfect combination of the two. This one is always our go-to broth.\n- Seafood Yosenabe - Seafood lover's pick. Not my favorite since I'd probably choose the above two over seafood, but not a bad choice - especially if you love seafood! \n\nYou can pick additional items to add onto your original broth, so don't feel too limited on a certain choice just because it includes something you like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-07", "description": "Nabe is a pretty interesting place with the most misleading name. You would expect them to be serving nabe here, but it's actually more like hot pot/shabu shabu. There's no clay or iron pot in the middle and it's a split half half metal pot that you find in shabu shabu places. The place has one long community table, a six person table, and some four people tables. The community table is large enough to fit a party of 12-14. One problem with this place is it's not big enough to support all the demand it's getting. The wait time for this place around dinner can be over an hour long. Pop in before dinner time and there may be a table free.\n\n== Food ==\n\nShabu Shabu set was good. The pork was pretty tasty. The broth for this one was kind of sweet which made it pretty nice.\n\nSukiyaki set was also good. The beef were really tasty, soft, and tender. The spicy miso broth was pretty spicy.\n\nGood amount of veggies that come with the dishes. I like the beef more than the pork due to the texture. The pork was a bit chewy compared to the beef.\n\nThe rice finisher is amazing. They put rice into one of the soups and create a porridge from it. The soup soaked in all the beef and veggie flavor so it's pretty amazing. One thing you probably want to do is forget how fatty the soup is.\n\n== Service ==\n\nService was great here. The waitress, Michelle (name escapes me), was really nice and helpful. Water was refilled once in a while. She came around to explain things and to ask if everything was good.\n\n== Overall ==\n\n4.5 Stars. Great place to go. Long wait times make it hard to grab a table here. The food is expensive, but it is good and the experience is amazing. Definitely a place worth going to, but it seems like a gamble since you might not get a table.", "author": "Steven B."}

The broths have so much depth of flavor which just enhances all the fresh and homemade elements added to the pot. The service is very efficient, fast and proper, but they can sometimes be too clinical and not personable enough. The last time I went our server was genuinely friendly and one thing that's always consistent is how much they know about their product. They always ask if its the first time we've been there and constantly give bits of information about their food and traditions throughout the night. \n\nThe hot pot it located right in the center of the table which means your food is always piping hot. There are recommended combinations in the menu, but you can always deviate from that with tons of different combinations of ingredients. You can tell that everything from the noodles to the vegetables are great quality. \n\nOne of the biggest things that sets this place apart is the \"rice special.\" That's when they take any of your leftover broth, reduce it down to thicken it, add egg, rice, seaweed water, shallots and make a porridge that's phenomenal. I look forward to it every time; it really makes you feel like you're getting your money's worth and extra food. Its always a great end to dinner because of that.

I finished the meat and veggies feeling comfortably full but not entirely satisfied. As they started clearing the table, I had a twinge of regret - for just a normal dinner, maybe we should have just gone to Marnee Thai, or San Tung, for cheaper.\n\nBUT THEN. Then, they came and made the Zosui rice soup. It's a rice porridge that's included with your meal, and is made from the leftovers of your hot pot. It took quite a long time (a bit of an art, it seems), and we had a nice conversation with our waitress as she stirred. She finally handed us two heaping bowls and I took a tentative bite... then downed the rest of the bowl in record time. It was AMAZING. We ended up with 3-4 extra servings for leftovers, too -- which makes the aforementioned high price suddenly reasonable.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is why I will be back to Nabe.

Basically you can choose 2 broth in one pot (you pay for each broth; ex. if you have one pot with 2 broth you pay for the 2 broths separately) and you can choose size large or small. The size refers to the amount of meat they give you rather than the pot size.  Since the store is relatively new, most of the staff seem to still be in training so our ordering process was kind of chaotic because we had some difficulty figuring out how to order and the pricing. \n\nWe had 5 girls sharing 4 broths (2 pots, each pot with 2 kinds of broth) and it was a good amount. We each ended up paying $22 dollars (including tax/tip).  We tried the seasonal duck, spicy miso shabu shabu, kimchi/pork belly, and the Sukiyaki. \n\n1. Spicy Miso- a little spicier than I'd like, came with udon noodles and veggies/meat.Broth is very flavorful.\n \n2. Duck- broth tasted like sukiyaki, came with soba noodles and mochi chunks. The duck is very soft and tasty even after boiling for 20 minutes.\n\n3. Kimchi/pork belly: not too spicy or salty, pork belly meat was really good and thinly sliced\n\n4. Sukiyaki- sweat/salty broth, goes well with beef and has jelly noodles in it. \n\nQuality of the meats are pretty good. Overall broth are pretty heavily flavored.\n\nIn the end the staff will add rice/egg, green onion and roasted seaweed to one broth per pot of your choice. They make a congee out of the left over broth. If they ask you how the broth taste, ask them to dilute your broth if you feel like it was on the salty side. We did not know this so we told them broth tasted fine and our congee turned out to be super salty and inedible with the sukiyaki broth.

We had originally been planning on going to Mum's across the street from our hotel in Japantown. But, after hearing where we were planning on eating, my uncle insisted we try here because it's just a million times better than Mum's. \n\nWalked in and first thing we noticed was that the decor is super nice. Very sleek and classy looking (and apparently the guy who designed the place is the same guy who designed my aunt's lounge/club). Waitress is really nice and was very attentive. Probably helped that we got there pretty early for dinner, around 5:30, and the place was still empty. \n\nMenu: Smaller selection, but they do have different broths including a spicy miso broth, plain seaweed broth, and other soy based broths. We went with the traditional broth, just because we prefer getting the flavor from the ponzu sauce, garlic and green onions. No all you can eat, which is kind of a bummer but the food was still pretty on point.\n\nFood: the quality of the meat was obviously way better than Mum's all-you-can-eat. The Wagyu beef was mouth wateringly tender and the selection of seafood was great (coming with salmon, clams, shrimp, etc.) Veggie were pretty standard: 3 different types of mushrooms, napa cabbage, carrots, tofu, spinach, and udon and clear noodles. One interesting thing was the squash. Never tried that, but it was really good as well. They give you the 2 standard sauces, but one thing I didn't like was that they give you the ponzu sauce already made. I like adding as much garlic, radish, and green onions as I like to my sauce. Also, the portions are not that big. I ordered a regular, and still ate half my mom's plate of beef as well as all the veggies on my plate (I also had just come from an oyster happy hour that included 6 dozen oysters, 2 dungeness crab cocktails, and many cocktails between the 5 of us). For the price, I wasn't about to order more. At the end, they make a porridge out of the broth. Isn't really anything special as much as my uncle tries to hype it up. Just rice, egg, and seaweed, made in the broth from our meat. Was pretty plain, so I mixed the ponzu sauce into it to make it taste better. \n\nOverall, I still prefer Mum's all-you-can-eat. Even though the meat quality isn't as good, Shabu Shabu is not that filling so I need much more than the servings they give us. Also, I like eating more veggies and making my own sauce.

The food here is absolutely amazing.\n\nMy friend and I had the sukiyaki and kimchi kurobuta pork belly sets (both in regular), and it was enough to feed 2.5 people (I say .5 because my friend was eating from the sukiyaki/kimchi kurobuta set and our other friends' set which was shabu shabu and seafood). It was extremely filling and tasted amazing. Both sukiyaki and kimchi broths were full of flavor and plentiful in assorted veggies (the mushrooms in the sukiyaki broth absorbed all the flavors in the broth which made it even tastier). The ponzu dipping sauce for the beef made the beef taste even better. At the end of the meal, the servers make a rice porridge from the broth of your choice (we chose the shabu  shabu broth which was a miso broth). I usually don't like rice porridge but this was super delicious porridge, probably because the miso broth was so flavorful.\n\nI most definitely recommend this place and will be coming back soon. So worth every penny.", "author": "J L."}

So let's break down what makes this place so successful:\n\n1. The food -- flavorful broth, organic vegetables, grass fed beef\n2. The service -- attentive, gives great recommendations, graceful\n3. The ambiance -- love the glass wall facing the street. When the place is full and the steam fogs up the glass, the cozy feeling of having eating in front of a simmering pot of goodness is priceless\n\nI usually get the shabu shabu with spicy miso brother and wagyu beef. Don't forget to ask for the sesame sauce to compliment the meat. One order doesn't look like a lot of food compared to all those all the you can shabu places out there but with the rice finisher, it gets quite filling. The rice finisher is like a porridge. Rice is added to broth to thicken. An egg is added to the concoction when the stove is turned off. It is then garnished with green onions and seaweed. If you can't finish it there, it makes a great breakfast for the next day.  \n\nI've also tried the sukiyaki. The broth is slightly sweeter and it comes with the calorie free shirataki noodles. This is a slightly healthier option and equally as delicious.", "author": "Foodi C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-12", "description": "After hearing many things about Nabe through my friend, I was excited to try it last night for my friend's birthday. Luckily we had a small dinner party because this place was probably one of the tiniest dine-in restaurant I've ever been to!! A long communal table that stretched from the front to the back was placed in the midde, and there were about 3 or 4 separate tables of four to the side. When I first got there I felt like I was walking into the steam room. All the steam from everybody's broth was circulating the air and there seemed to be no ventilation - the only way I felt that air was escaping was through the open front door. The thought of my face/makeup melting off was a little worrying but that wasn't going to keep me from dipping my meats into any pots!\n\nI ordered the Shabu Shabu - with beef and spicy miso broth. I've had a few different spicy miso at other shabu places but this was probably the most flavorful! Unlike other shabu places, the spices such as chili oil, garlic, radish, and pepper flakes weren't laid out on the table as condiments -but you had to ask for it yourself. Im guessing it's because the place is so small they didn't want to add more clutter. Also, the sesame goma sauce did not come as a standard so you had to ask for it to get it. I like adding extra garlic to my sauces and to my broth as well. I was a little disappointed when I asked for the hot drop and was told that they didn't offer it here. I looove hot drops - I feel like it gives my sauce a little kick and makes everything that much more delicious. Oh well, the meal goes on. I got a regular and it came with about 12 slices of beef. The slices are pretty thin but it will fill you up. Veggie platter consists of the usual: napa cabbage, spinach, enoki and shitaki mushrooms, carrots, tofu, and udon noodles. Overall everything tasted great. The broth was delicious, fresh veggies and the meat was tender! I had a chance to dip some of my meat in my friend's sukiyaki broth and it was good as well! I don't know if I'm the sweet type to be able to have a whole meal of it - but if I was sharing with someone I wouldn't mind having both sauces at my mercy. After the meal you can ask the servers to prepare a porridge for you! They basically just pour a bowl of rice into your broth, add an egg and green onions, mix it around and throw some seaweed on top ... but it's delicious! So simple but tasty :) I feel like adopting this tradition at other shabu places! I'd just have to save my rice to mix into the broth at the end. I've been to places where they offer to make you udon/noodles at the end of the meal but I guess this is a little reversed. Either way, it was a great experience. The servers are attentive and especially nice. Definitely a place I would recommend.", "author": "Ngan T."}

The Food - I order the large Spicy Miso Shabu Shabu with Wagyu Beef. The spicy miso had very little flavor. I had to request more spice in order to get it taste like any thing. The portion of meat was not a lot for a large but it was okay. The meal came with a brown sauce with onions and maybe garlic. This was my saving grace to  make a bland meal taste like anything. I will say that my friend, who order the duck, tasted much better. Well at least the duck did, I was not a fan of her soup base. On to The Service - We had reservation, so we were seated right away. However, the reservation was not needed since the place was pretty empty. The serve the soup and meat right away. The meal we order was a set, which also comes with rice and the normal shabu vegetables. Yet, this was not served right away. We had to ask twice for the rice. The first time we ask for the rice, they bring out the vegetables. After waiting a few minutes we asked again for the rice. I found this a little weird since the place wasn't busy and I would think bringing the rice and vegetable would be standard practice. The staff was pleasant enough, but not a lot of interaction (I am fine with this).  Lastly The Price - This place is expensive for what you get. You could go to an all you can eat Shabu House for the same price and better food. I would not recommend this place at all.", "author": "Yaya H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-06", "description": "Nabe has a very small menu, but they focus on high quality ingredients.  They do shabu a bit different here, they call it Nabemono but its practically the same thing.  Most shabu restaurants I've been to usually bring out the soup and the uncooked ingredients on a plate.  At Nabe they already put everything in the pot, with the flavored broth.  They do have one dish, called Shabu, where you do put the ingredients in yourself.  The food was excellent, the thinly sliced washugyu beef was very tender and flavorful.  We also had an order of the seafood mix which had a great variety of seafood options which included salmon, clams, shrimp and scallops.  The seasonal special was a duck breast which was very good but be sure not to cook the duck too long, the water can boil quick and the duck can get over cooked.  It comes crusted on the skin side but the rest of the duck is rare until they turn on the electric burner on.  The broth is came with was very good, wasn't too salty.  It also came with a small dish of cold soba noodles which compliment the salt form the broth and duck very nicely.  My favorite was the kimchee pork belly, the pork belly was cut very thin and had great flavor and tenderness.  The kimchee wasn't overpowering and added a nice flavor and seasoning to the vegetables and meat.  The most interesting item that came with the pork belly was the mochi.  It comes in a separate dish and it really hard but once its cooked in the broth, it becomes very chewy.  All the dishes come with vegetables by the way.  \n\nBE SURE TO SAVE ROOM AT THE END...when you're finished eating all the meat and vegetables, they use the leftover broth, pour some cooked rice to create this awesome porridge.  They take out whatever left over ingredients in the broth (if you are too full to eat them), pour the cooked rice in the broth, let it come to a boil until it thickens a little bit.  Then they pour a raw egg, seaweed and green onions as it all comes together to create a very flavorful porridge, a nice way to end a meal on.  If it's too salty for you, they can add more rice or water to balance it out for you.  If you're too full to eat the porridge, you can also take it home and it will taste just as good the following day.  Great way to make use of all the leftover food and ingredients when most shabu places tend to waste a lot of leftover food and some even charge when there is an all you can eat option. Since you get this porridge at the end, the meals don't come with rice.  You will have to order it on the side but I was fine without it.  \n\nStaff was extremely friendly and helpful, they were very prompt on refilling my teacup.  Decor was very nice but this is a very small place.  I think they could use a better ventilation system, the windows got all foggy and it was a little steamy inside. It is on the pricier side of Shabu/Hot Pot places, but the menu is different and more unique in my opinion.  I also feel the quality is top notch and above the rest of the shabu places I've been to.  This has become one of my favorite places to eat shabu/hot pot and I'm positive I'll be back soon.", "author": "Darren W."}

I came here on a super cold day in SF, so it was perfect for hot pot! This restaurant is pretty small (probably fits around 50 people or less?). The owner who was also our server said it gets pretty packed on the weekends, but you can call ahead of time to put your name on the waiting list. She was super friendly btw! I love restaurants with good service. Anyway, we decided to order the sukiyaki with beef and pork. I wasn't a huge fan of their pork (still good though, just not my fav), but their beef was delicious. Especially dipped in the raw egg, yumm. Also, all the veggies and tofu were already in our soup. We weren't super full by the time we finished our meat and veggies, but when you're finished with your meal they come and serve \"The Finisher\". Basically, they add rice to your remaining soup to make a porridge out of it! So awesome. They also had scallions and seaweed for the finishing touch. The server will ask you if you want to dilute it and I advise you to do so because heating the soup up again makes it too sweet! At least with the sukiyaki.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-27", "description": "Nabe is basically a shabu/hot pot-type restaurant whose main appeal is their organic ingredients and no MSG. However, they failed on almost every other front.\n\n1. The dishes here have enough salt in them to fill the Dead Sea. I get the \"organic, no MSG\" part, and that's why we went, but everything was so salty I was drinking water all night to the point where I felt bloated before bed. Every restaurant needs their food to taste good, and Nabe does this by excessively salting up their broth. On the other hand, given the organic nature of this place, it was probably organic sea salt...\n\n2. Ridiculously high prices. A large nabe or shabu here will set you back $24, or $29 if you want the seafood. Compare that to about $17 at your typical shabu place in SF, and you're paying a 50% premium for the organic ingredients and no MSG broth. You're also paying with your health, because all that salt can't possibly be good for you.\n\n3. So-so service. We had a well-meaning server who tried hard to make us happy, but she was inexperienced and slow. It was clear that most of the servers were relatively new to the business and didn't have much experience, so even though they had a relatively good ratio of servers to customers, everything took a long time - from getting our food served to receiving the check.\n\nThe porridge they make at the end - basically dumping a bowl of rice, a beaten egg, and green onions into the leftover broth - is interesting, but it also has the effect of further concentrating the already salty broth. We felt bad not eating it after the server spent 5 minutes stirring it, but we also weren't sure that her solution of adding even more broth was going to solve the underlying problem.\n\nOur total check for 2 entrees (no appetizers, no drinks) came to $66 with tax and tip. We had to try this new nabe/shabu place because my boyfriend doesn't like MSG and that was a big selling point, but we almost certainly won't be going back.", "author": "Bing W."}

The windows were all steamy which instantly told us that it must be a hotpot place. Hotpot is definitely one of our favourites back home and given the ultra cold weather we thought it would be a perfect way to end off the night! We were all very glad we spotted this place because it did not disappoint! \n\nPortions were very generous. We ordered the edamame beans and gyozas for appies. The edamame was not like your average edamame beans. My girlfriend was obsessed with them! My favourite was definitely the gyozas. The soups were really different from the typical soups I've tried at other hotpot places (we had half spicy miso and half sukiyaki). They were so much more flavourful as opposed to being either the usual just plain salty or watery. And instead of the usual dipping sauce, it came with a ponzu sauce, which we all agreed complemented the meats so well. All the servers were really attentive and refilled our pots with water without being asked (big brownie points for this!)\n\nAll in all, the next time i'm in SF, Nabe will definitely be on the top of the list of restaurants to revisit.", "author": "Nina P."}

Got here around 5:30P on a Friday night and we were lucky enough to get a table but the place got crowded quickly. I should really say a part of the table because the center of the restaurant is essentially one really long table with hot pot burners inset .\n\nWe started off with the edamame appetizers and they give you a ton a edamame (perfect for me)! As for the shabu shabu, we ordered the pork belly in kimchi broth and the Washugyu beef in traditional konbu broth. Apparently these are traditional Japanese pairings but it seemed weird to me that they don't let you choose meats and broths separately because when it comes out you can cook the meat in whichever broth you want. This was key because even though they told us upfront that the konbu is just water and seaweed, I soon realized that it makes your meat and veges taste exactly like...water and seaweed. So very quickly I was pretty much cooking everything in the kimchi broth, which I must say was amazingly delicious. Spicy but flavorful-spicy not just spicy-for-the-sake-of-burning-your-tastebuds. Meat quality was excellent as well and veges were fresh.\n\nDefinitely a nice place to eat on a cold night. Prices are on the higher end but not unreasonable.

My daughter is 3 months so she's in a stroller, and we only have a jogging stroller which is pretty big. Luckily we arrived when there weren't many people so we were seated immediately and were able to snag a seat where the stroller could go next to us. (I don't recommend going here if you have a baby in a stroller as there just isn't much room.) when the place started getting busy and packed (15 mins later), I felt as if the stroller was a nuisance to other customers. I ordered the kimchi broth and it was amazing! If I didn't have a stroller and lived closer to San Fran I would go here again! My husband had the shabu shabu with miso broth in a large and was fully satisfied. (he's a big guy--6'1) There is only one restroom in the restaurant which is unisex. The one waitress was VERY busy waiting the tables and she never refilled our waters until we asked. I wish she refilled the water more so I deducted a star. I left the restaurant feeling thirsty... For my first time having shabu shabu this restaurant is amazing! I would recommend this restaurant to a friend!

Their ingredients are very fresh, the hotpot burners are convenient, and they can even split flavors in a single pot. I'd really recommend it as a place to go and catch up with friends- there's a lot of potential for communal sharing and its easy to chat over the food. \n\nThe variety of sides offered with your generic shabu shabu is generous and one of their selling points (tofu, enoki, noodles, pumpkin, spinach, cabbage, carrot). Their meat is a nice quality and stays buttery soft. \n\nBut lets talk about the best thing- the rice porridge that is made after the meal with the rich broth leftover, egg, and rice. Whipped until its milky- I almost always take home this portion and have it for breakfast. \n\nThe food is a little high-priced for my usual budget- but it comes with the second portion of rice porridge and more sides than your usual shabu shabu course. \n\nThe staff is usually very attentive and informative, very lovely. Sometimes it seems as though they may need one extra person on hand to just help with getting water and helping patrons get their check in a timely manner.", "author": "Viva W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-16", "description": "I really wanted to give 5 stars. The decor and atmosphere are quite impressive. Top of the line, in fact, for a small place like this. The service is also very good. The only problem I had with this place is the reason people go here: the food. We got the pork belly and duck breast. The pork belly was delicious. The duck breast was cut too thick and it was very tough. \n\nThe first mistake was already having the duck breast inside of the pot when it comes out. In my opinion, it should be served on a separate plate. I understand that the presentation looks nice, but if it all cooks together at the same time, the meat will be over-cooked unless you try to eat only the duck breast very fast. No one wants to do that because you want to enjoy the whole hot pot, not try and get rid of the meat as soon as possible. Needless to say, the duck was extremely tough and rubbery.\n\nThe second mistake was already having all of the ingredients in the pot when it comes out. Again, the presentation looked fantastic, but we literally sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the pot to come to a boil. We were already really hungry coming in. We ordered, waited 15 minutes to get our food, then had to wait another 15 minutes just watching the bowl while it got hot. I was very disappointed in the wait time. Either preheat the pot back in the kitchen so it will come out with little wait time, or don't fill the pot with all the ingredients so it takes extra long to heat everything up. Plus, it would increase the customer turnover time significantly. A restaurant is in the business to make money. Having a higher turnover would be more profitable. We spent 2 hours in there from start to finish. I like to enjoy my meals, but that was way too long to spend in a restaurant with just two people.\n\nIf you only order one hotpot, they will try to up-sell you to two (we were two people). Trust me, one order is plenty of food for two people.\n\nThis is a great place to take a date, but be aware of wait times. Also, the price point was a little too high for what you get. I'd go back more often if it wasn't so expensive.", "author": "Michael S."}

If you shabu a lot like me, you'll remember that other places have beef that seemed to fall apart when cooked or turned into a weird gray color. But nabe beef is amazing. It's tender, juicy, and never falls apart even after over cooking. I was hooked with their shabu shabu set but it was their duck set that was life changing. This stuff is like crack. The skin is seared nicely and the breast is cut into perfect slices. It's cooked in a dashi broth (savory soy based) and it simply taste like heaven. And when things can possibly get better, they make you a rice porridge with your left over broth that'll blow your mind all over again. Save room for desert though! The new panna cotta is super creamy and their mochi cake which is served warm with ice cream is delicious. I usually get the duck breast and my BF gets the spicy miso shabu. I think it's one of the best combos ever. Best part is, they take rsvp despite party size! Super plus. Give nabe a try, you won't regret it!", "author": "Anna Z."}

The floor to ceiling wall faces 9th Avenue, so you can watch the neighborhood pass by.\nFor a nabemono neophyte like myself, the menu needs some explanation, but the wait staff were very friendly and patient about explaining how best to cook the various meats in the broths, and what dipping sauces or raw egg go with which item. Of the food we tried the Kimchi and kurobuta pork belly, sukiyaki and the seafood yosenabe were my favorites. After you eaten your fill by cooking the meat and vegetables in the broth, the waitstaff will then ask which broth you would like to have rice, green onions, egg and seaweed cooked in (you can pick more than one of your broths); this is a delicious way to end the nabemono.\nThe food was excellent, fresh and healthy.

I've been in search of a shabu place and immediately bookmarked Nabe when I heard it opened. A few people in my party lived in Japan for a number of years, so I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to try it out. Needless to say, everyone loved Nabe! The service was very pleasant (something I'm finding to be more and more rare on every eating adventure). The food came out shortly after ordering and heated up quickly on the table top stoves. The veggies were standard (cabbage, tofu, mushrooms, pumpkin, spinach, carrots, etc) and were very fresh and crispy. The meat was incredibly fresh, tender, and sliced super thin. All the broths we had were amazing. At most places, I'm never really inclined to sip on the broth because it's relatively flavorless and has that weird film from the not-so-high-quality meats. Not at Nabe! The particular standout was the seasonal kamonanban with duck breast in a dashi broth. They kept having to come by and refill the broth for us. At the end, they make a congee rice porridge with the leftover broth, rice, egg and chopped green onions. It was a great way to round out the meal!
