The meat could've been seasoned a bit better, but it still had a decent flavor. There's a sweetness to it that kind of distracts the typical five spice flavor. It's good enough for Outer Sunset locals, but I think Cheung Hing and Ming Kee are still the reigning champs when it comes to roast duck. \n\nI did enjoy the noodle soups here. By Hong Kong standards, this place wouldn't be anything special, but it stands out among other Cantonese noodle soup places in the Bay Area. One of the biggest fumbles of wonton noodle soup around here is that the broth is pretty much just watery chicken broth. The broth at Win's wasn't as pungent or aromatic as I'd like it to be, but it did have hints of the dried seafood flavor that added an umami character. The noodles had a good bite to them, and the wontons were seasoned well. They had a good ratio of shrimp, and the seasoning and spices imparted a slight warm fuzzy feeling on my tongue. That's a good sign. I've definitely had better wonton noodle soup, but with its cheap price and decent flavor here, I can see myself coming back for a quick fix. It's better and closer than any place in Chinatown. \n\nNext time, I have to order the Ngau Jaap (Honeycomb Tripe Stew).

I thought it was good size and nicely roasted. And $13.95 was an acceptable price. The duck was not too fatty or too skinny. \n*Roast Pig (didn't get the price per pound, next time) (2.75 of 5) Pretty bad. I guess I went too late in the night and the roast was out since morning. It looked absolutely great, but it was old. I could only imagine when it was fresh. I will not buy this when I go late at night. Next time, I will go buy it in the afternoon.

There were only five won tons, but these were big and plump and filled with a little ground pork and lots of firm shrimp.  The noodles stayed firm and chewy even while sitting in the hot broth.  A generous portion of thick sliced BBQ pork sat on top of the noodles; these were lightly glazed, tender pieces of pork.  \n\nOn a more recent visit I had the BBQ Pork and Roast Duck over rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hbDkXsC4_ZOt5h04hmPReQ?select=mS9pKO8j_AsecMsLAKjxyA).  The duck was very good in flavor, but take a close look at the duck skin; you might want to remove the skin when it isn't plucked clean.  That's usually not the fault of the restaurant but the poultry supplier.  Again, lots of BBQ pork and the usual boiled lettuce comes on the side unless you request otherwise.\n\nOverall it is very good Chinese comfort food.

I placed my order and after what seemed like an eternal 15 minutes I had to ask the waitress for a status.  I can understand if the place is packed, orders get lost but my table was one of four tables occupied.  The waitress finally brings my order and this is where the downward spiral begins.\n\nI took a sip of the broth from the bowl of won ton noodles.  Luke warm!!  I sifted around to see how many won tons amongst the noodles and found only three which is about three under what they normally served in the past.  My duck came on the side per my request.  At first glance I can see clearly the coagulated fat around the meat.  Nasty!!  I take a bite and as suspected the duck is cold as if it were sitting for hours.  I immediately flag down the waitress to advise her of the duck situation, I did not even bother with the soup and won ton for fear of liquid payback.  She advises she will get me some hot duck and walks to the back which I found odd since they just brought up three fresh ducks to the front window.  \n\nThe waitress returns and places a small plate of steaming hot duck.  The same duck they served me before but freshly zapped in the microwave!!!  I am thinking Are you kidding me???  I immediately refuse the duck and ask for her to take the entire order back and take it off the bill because I am not eating it.  She has the nerve to say I need to pay for the noodles and won ton, she will take off $2 for the duck.  I advised her that they are violating food safety standards and I will call the health department if they do not take the entire order off the bill.  She finally relents and took it off the bill.

We arrived at the restaurant at 9:33pm, knowing that it closes at 10pm. We were desperate to find a place that was opened on a Saturday night since my two friends didn't have dinner yet. Our originally plan was to go to 8 Immortals but it closed at 930, so we opted for this place. It wasn't exactly the best looking restaurant from the outside, but the inside was decent. The decor is old-fashioned with minimal decor hung on the walls. It also has a television at one end of the wall.\n\nSo as we walked through the door, the waitress greeted us with a hello, quickly setted our table with tableware, and gave us the menu to look over. She paced back and forth which made me nervous although I wasn't going to order anything. She even came to our table TWICE to ask if we were ready to order - all within three minutes or so. However, she was really polite and told us to take our time. (It was understandable since they were already getting ready to close the restaurant down for the night.) After some quick deliberation (clearly under the pressure), my two friends settled on Seafood & Pineapple w/ Egg White Fried Rice and Sauteed Mixed Fresh Vegetables with rice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hbDkXsC4_ZOt5h04hmPReQ?userid=NLgTfZz_ITzmV6KiO-mGIg Both dishes were around $7.\n\nThe portions were huge! Each dish was able to feed at least two people. However, the food was unable to be finished within the fifteen minute time frame that we had left in the restaurant, so we asked for the food to be boxed. The waitress nicely boxed it up for my two friends with a smile on her face. I checked my cell phone, and it read: 10:09pm. We paid and said \"thank you\" multiple times.

From the outside, the place looks unassuming and not particularly distinctive on a block with two other Chinese restaurants.  The tables are sticky and I'm not that attracted to places with ducks hanging in the window.  But they serve several kinds of congee, so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the pork and preserved egg congee ($4.50) and it's the best one I've had on Taraval St.  The consistency was a little watery (I prefer Eight Immortals for consistency; I think EI cooks it longer because the rice has broken down more) but for flavor, Win's is better.  Win's puts fresh ginger in the congee (so does EI), but Win's pork tastes better.  It's shredded and definitely marinated in soy sauce.  Very nice.  The broth is flavorful too.  You can also get the crispy Chinese fried donut (not the best I had but Chinese fried donuts are always greasy) for an additional charge and extra preserved egg for $1.  Extra preserved egg - I love places that offer this option. I think this place has the best jook in the Sunset/Parkside.\n\nThe won tons are filled with pork and shrimp.  I prefer my won tons to have more pork (so that they're juicier) but these are good.  The big dumplings are better than the won tons because they also have Chinese chives and black fungus (adds a crunchy texture).  \n\nI came on Sunday for lunch and every table was occupied...the place was bustling.  People were waiting for tables and many pick up orders up front.  Seemed like everyone there was Chinese.  I like the front area where they chop the duck (there was a constant chopping sound) and cook the dumplings.  The duck looked very good from a distance and not too fatty.  \n\nService is brusque and efficient.

It's the kind of place that looks kinda dirty inside, but you keep coming back because it's cheap, good, and in the neighborhood. There's a constant row of double parked cars outside the restaurant because this is the kind of place where Chinese families stop to pick up takeout for dinner. I know that's what my family does, and we end up eating Win's takeout way too often. The roast duck and roast pork are excellent, as is the steamed chicken, but sometimes you get shafted with the janky, non meaty parts of the bird or pig. Don't take it personally; they've even done that to my mom, who's a regular and orders in Chinese.\n\nThe congee, wonton noodles, crispy chow mein, and beef tofu rice are among my favorite things to order. And everything's so cheap too! $5-$6 for a rice plate or wonton and I'm good to go for dinner, and sometimes even with leftovers for lunch.

Their duck is good too but cannot compare with Cheung Hings. However, their soy sauce chicken and barbecue spare ribs in my opinion, are better than Cheung Hings. Their soy sauce chicken has a very smooth texture to it and the sauce is great. Their spare ribs are glazed with honey and it's delicious. The last time I came here, I tried their roasted duck with dried wonton noodle and ordered their barbecue pork fried rice. Sad to say, their bbq pork fried rice did not meet the standard of the previous bbq pork fried rice. It still had flavor but it was missing a lot of bbq pork meat so it was like eating salted fried rice with pieces of eggs and green onions. Even the roasted duck with plain fried wonton noodle tasted better than the fried rice that I usually order here.\n\nAnyway, they get the meals ready really quickly esp for to go which only takes about 10 minutes. I would recommend getting food to go if you're hungry and in a rush. The service is ok. I would rate this place 3.5 stars if I could because they have good Chinese food.", "author": "Monica C."}

I get this over white rice with the roasted pork with crispy skin, not to be confused with BBQ pork a.k.a. \"char-shiuu\".  The soy sauce chicken goes with the duck well too.  For the uninitiated, you will find these dishes under \"Barbeque Items\" as \"combo barbeque items and rice\".  You can even order three items if you want.  \n\nSometimes i get the duck with wonton and noodles.  Just be careful, as the heat from the soup tends to \"cook\" the duck, giving it this gamey taste ruining the duck!  I usually, fish the duck out of the soup as soon as it comes to my table.  The rice won't do this, because it's not hot enough.  Duck is fatty and boney.  It gets a little messy, because you will use a combination of your chopsticks/fork and fingers.  \n\nThe place is kind of \"greasy spoon\".  Cleanliness could be a lot better.  Service is like what you get at most Chinese restaurants in my experience (and I'm Chinese!).  Don't be offended, it's mainly cultural, not personal.  The dining room is sticky and kind of dirty.  It's cold in the winter too!  So consider ordering your food to take out.  \n\nDespite this, the duck here is still THE BEST!  I've had some of the other dishes, which are average.

I had no cash on me so I was going to use the plastic. The guy sitting behind the cashier said minimum was $10. I explained to him how I was in a hurry, had no time to go to the ATM and that it was only 25 cents short of the minimum. He replied by asking me \"It's only $9.75. You don't have money? It's pretty cheap you know.\" (In Cantonese.) He then told me to just simply buy more stuff and then he'll let me use plastic. I told him before, that the owner always let us irregardless. He snapped back by saying \"Go find the old owner then, we're the new owners!\" So I looked him straight in the eye and left. \n\nI dread it everytime my parents tell me to get pick up from here. Second time, I ordered a noodle soup for my dad. Usually, places would separate the noodles and the soup in 2 different containers. This guy just puts the noodles in a container and then ladles the soup in. Not only does this create really soggy noodles, but there isnt enough soup as the sheer volume of the noodles leaves no room for soup, so when you finally pour it in a bowl, you have an island of noodles and barely any soup. \n\nI complained to him about this, asking him to put soup in another container. He goes \"I already put soup in here.\" I asked him, can you just give me a container of soup? There isn't really enough in there. He replies by saying, sure, the container will cost 50 cents and then $2.50 or a bowl of soup to-go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-03", "description": "I've been coming here for years, an almost weekly visit to get my salt and msg fix. Yup, this place is not for the health-conscious types, but if you want to indulge a bit, you will be rewarded with some very tasty food. As individual tastes can vary, reviews will vary accordingly. And as choice of dishes goes, it can also vary, thus, ratings will swing accordingly as well. \n\nHere are my personal favorites:\n\nRoast Duck, hands-down the best this side of the city...If the duck is cold and you order half to a whole duck, they will oil blanch it to get the skin crispy and hot again before serving to you...ahhh! It's as close to being in duck-heaven as you can get.\n\nRoast Pork, hands-down the best anywhere other than the one I had in L.A. They use a center-cut (don't know if that's the technical term) but the perfect section of meat has just the right proportions of skin, fat and meat. They bake the specially cut sections throughout the day. If you're lucky to get it right from the oven....mmmm, mmmm, mmmmmmmm. Don't come too late. The roast pork sells out readily.\n\nBBQ pork, hands-down the best anywhere--they use the cut of meat that is more expensive...tender with just the right amount of fat. As I said, this place is not for the health-conscious. Lean pork is usually too dry for my taste. Not these...lean plus fat equals moist succulent meat. And if you're so lucky to get one in which the fat is sorta al dente, like between fat and cartilage...Oh my, yummmm. \n\nIf you're a fan of duck feet, don't forget to order some, especially the claypot version served with black mushrooms.\n\nAlso, do not walk away without trying the hung tao yee wonton...it's an old chinatown dish that very few restaurants make this dish anymore. We like a variation with westlake beef soup base for the hung tao yee tun.\n\nTheir salt & pepper chicken wings is one of the best! Salt & pepper fish is yummy as well, as is the calamari.\n\nIf you like egg and shrimp over rice noodle (watt dan hah fun), be adventurous and try their satay version. \n\nAnd since I'm a regular, I often order variations of their dishes to suit my taste as well as averting boredom from eating the same dishes.\n\nThe people who own Win's are very nice people, once you get past their serious side. It's tough running a small mom & pops business. And believe me, there are \"customers\" who come in and try to take advantage of them or try to freeload. I've seen it happen time and time again.\n\nAnd speaking of cleanliness...they may not spit shine the silverware or wipe the tables with the utmost care, but I see them putting the cleaned utensils in boiled hot water to sanitize them, hand dry each utensil and chopsticks, and then at the end of the day, piling the chairs up and scrubbing the floors clean of the day's foot traffic. And so, this is the time I make my leave with leftovers in hand.\n\nOne more thing, the house soup is complimentary...if you think they charge for it, something went askew in the translation/interpretation.", "author": "Lil D."}

We got the 6-course meal and I was a bit surprised by the smallness of the dishes as I was expecting typical Chinese banquet portions.  For only $24 though (and only two eaters), it's a good amount of food.\n\nThe gai lan was nice and crisp.  The chicken and duck were good (not great) but fatty.  The chicken's ginger condiment made me a bit homesick; it smelled like what my dad makes. The rest of the food: meh. I liked their red bean dessert, not overly sweet.\n\nAlthough it may not be for everyone, I liked the atmosphere. It's a small restaurant and they cut up the ducks and chickens right by the front window. Some will probably find it loud and annoying, but it made me feel right at home.  They were also doing a lot of takeout, so there's a lot of Chinese flying back and forth in the front.   (I was slightly annoyed by the other patrons though. One couple kept adding dishes when they saw other people's which confused the wait staff. Another table had a kid who kept making comments about the decor, the people, the Chinese flying around--blegh.)", "author": "Yan E."}

Evidence: the owner still sits on her stool in front and calculates your order on a notepad. No calculators in sight. \n\nThey are famous for their duck, but I don't have to tell you: you will be able to discern that from the many ducks hanging in the window and the many many framed reviews on the wall that tell you that the duck is the ish. Spicy garlic chicken and won ton soups are also highlights. \n\nWarning: The boss lady a.k.a. speedy human calculator has little tolerance for customers who cannot order in Cantonese.

This place is famous for their roast duck and I ordered the quarter $6 plate to share.  I ordered the wet egg and beef over rice and my coworker ordered Mongolian pork.  At lunch, you get free house soup.  The soup is the standard dried bok choi, carrot, and pork bone soup.  It tasted good.  The roast duck came out in about 2 minutes and we were able to eat this while waiting for the rice plates to be cooked.  The duck was moist and flavorful.  Slightly crisp skin and good meat.  It was cooked more such that more fat was rendered out, but not dried out.  The duck is highly recommended here.  My wet egg and beef over rice plate was good as expected like at other restaurants in San Francisco.  The serving was ok-generous.  Price was $5.50 for the rice plate, pretty reasonable as most other restaurants are starting to reach $7 for the same dish.  The beef was tender, and the egg was mixed with a lot of corn starch to make a thick egg-drop soup consistency.  The lady waiting tables was very nice and efficient.  I enjoyed her deliberate enunciation when repeating the dishes we ordered.  Very nice woman.  The atmosphere was bright, but the L-train passes every 15 minutes which thunders by.

Especially the roast pork, the skin is crisp, nice flavor, not too salty not too bland, and they only use the belly part, which is best cuz it's not all lean meat.   The ginger scallion chicken is yummy too, but i think it's a lttle over cooked.   Fast serivce, close to home, my favorite place for togo in sunset.", "author": "Tadaa T."}

And ate every last bit, except for the noodles which we found lacking in flavour and so totally not worth it.   Everything else was super good - me and reno fought over the last wonton (he won.) Cinzia was being crabby and insisted she didn't like anything, but I saw her sneaking bites of pork fried rice when she thought nobody was looking.  Reno's  \"I done\" was betrayed by him sniping Jack's bbq chicken over and over.  Jack's quick hand commanded most of the pork fried rice and all the bbq reno couldn't reach.  So there we all were, stealing eachothers food and loving it.", "author": "Meg W."}

It was THE neighborhood go-to spot for everything roasted (duck, chicken, pork) and of course, the crunchy shrimp Pan Fried Noodles. It's unfortunate that it has since been transferred to a new owner because frankly, it's like losing a member of the family - to leprosy. This place now sadly serves cold Pan Fried Noodles with half the shrimp, half the bok choy, and twice as much baby cockroaches.  Horrified but still hopeful, I turned to the won ton noodle soup to find a slightly larger cockroach's legs (count them- 2) floating atop the dark bland broth.  Dismayed but not yet defeated, I finally turned my chopsticks to the plate of cold roast duck, to find, not more cockroaches, but lots and lots of duck follicle hairs.

But tonight, everything was so good, I had to bust out the keyboard as soon as I had wolfed down a plate-and-a-half full of food. We've never actually sat down in the restaurant to eat. It's just always been much more fun to get the food to go and inhale it in the privacy of our own home along. I had no idea there were new owners, but I don't think the quality has changed.\n\nTonight, we had:\n*chicken salad - perfectly seasoned, albeit a teensy bit soggy (which really doesn't matter when you eat it as fast as I do), but sooo flavorful. Be sure not to make the mistake my funny hubby made the first time we ordered this:  do NOT order \"chinese\" chicken salad. It's a chinese restaurant so it's just chicken salad! (Wasn't that on an episode of Friends??)\n*broccoli beef - the beef was juicy and tender, the broccoli still crisp and soaked in enough of the sauce to burst in your mouth when you bite into the little tree\n*bbq pork - We think this is definitely one of their best dishes. It's always tender, and made with lean pork Lots of other places we've tried bbq at have used fatty meat. Win's pork is meaty, baby.\n*veggie chow mein - not as many veggies this time as it usually has (bok choy, broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms, etc.) but I love their chow mein noodles so to me, the more noodles the better! These are not the skinny mein noodles but the thicker, chewier noodles.\n*combo fried rice - the only ordinary dish, but still yummy\nAll that food and yep - just $33!\n\nIn the past, we've also had their chicken wings (very garlicy but yummy, especially when it's still fresh and still crispy), hot & sour soup (delish - not too hot that it burns your taste buds off so you can't even taste anything else), and kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (ditto).

I quickly grew fond of the fast, friendly service and of course the Roasted Duck over Rice. Unfortunately, the quality of food and service have been declining from visit to visit. The duck ended up being fatter, having less meat, whilst chiefly consisting out of abnormally sized bones. I've seen a lot of ducks in my life, but none that would resemble such a shape, therefore I presume that these aren't naturally bred ducks, but the factory farming kind of poor quality. Of course, the duck's quality has never been A+++, but as aforementioned, the nice atmosphere and the well-used condiments made up for the poor meat quality.
