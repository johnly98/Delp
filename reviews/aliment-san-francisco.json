Brussels sprouts were ok, but the sprouts were too large and didn't fully cook; outside was crisp and nicely done; but due to size they were also under seasoned.\nMussels were solid, but I don't get the French fries on top that results in a beautiful French fry getting soggy from water and steam of the mussels.   The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Mussels were a little bit gritty and needed a better cleaning, flavor was good. \nService was soli and quick.

The red wine was, eh... the Paloma was fantastic. \n\nWe dined upstairs and it was uncomfortably hot. I was hesitant about dining up their for this reason but took a chance. \n\nWe ordered the Brussels sprouts to start and they came out quickly. They weren't fully cooked though which was a bummer. I guess they do not steam them first. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the steak burger which was definitely the winner. The entree presentation was cute on the tray but I think she wanted some more fries. Also the burger continuously slipped off the bun. I think the bun wasn't perfect for such a fatty piece of beef. Half way through it was pretty soaked with the fat of the beef & soggy. That burger patty though was outstanding and had delicious cheese on top. \n\nMy spinach salad was really good, with I think strips of radishes and tasty clementine oranges. The chicken was nicely cooked but unseasoned. Tender but mild in taste. The light, mild oil based dressing lightly covered it. The tomatoes were fantastic and an usual yellow variety. Super juicy. I enjoyed it.\n\nMy 2nd glass of wine was from Napa. At $15 per glass it was one of the more expensive glasses. It was fabulous Cabernet Sauvignon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-12", "description": "Aliment has the very good and the very disappointing. In a city with so many options, I was wildly disappointed.  I should have known that day of reservations were too good to be true.\n\nThe eatery itself is very attractive.  It is a lovely neighborhood restaurant on the corner of Mason and Bush.  There are four booths on the first floor that accommodate 4-6, a few high tops and a full bar with seating of six.  There were also tables on the second floor. They are doing the modern bistro - kitchen towel napkins, no tablecloths, little plants, etc. You know the vibe.  FYI: Ventilation is an issue; hot on the second floor and cold on the first floor.\n\nWe ordered the burger for the LOs to split, which they were nice enough to do in the back. The $18 burger was slightly overcooked (more medium than medium rare) and underseasoned. It had nice aged cheddar but the bacon jam and chipotle aioli were undetectable. It was served with fries and spicy pickles. It was totally edible but not at all wow.\n\nMeanwhile, we had cocktails, DM had a Kentucky Mule and I had the spice table. The Ketucky Mule was a-ok - lots of lime with bourbon and a bit of ginger beer. It was bartender's choice - not very imaginative but a-ok.  I ordered the Spice Trail, which was a bourbon based drink with a ginger turmeric elixir with lemon. It was not a very balanced drink - a little cloudy and bitter. Drinkable (who wastes good bourbon?!?!) but definitely not my fave.\n\nThe Brussels Sprouts were the highlight of the evening and are worth a trip on their own. Super crunchy sprouts in fish sauce that stay crunchy. OMG. These were heavenly. The cauliflower saute was okay.  The first couple of bites that I had (and the last couple of bites that DM had) were off. We suspect it was rancid oil that was drizzled at center. Otherwise,the caramelized cauliflower with golden raisins, capers and Parmesan were very good.\n\nThings went downhill. Nothing here is inedible,but I have had so much better. The mussels had only one piece of chorizo - false advertising - and half of them were chock full of grit. The lager sauce and braised red cabbage were a nice alternative preparation to the dish.  The New York Strip requested rare was more like flank steak cooked medium rare. The roasted sweet potatoes were nice, crispy and generous. The mustard inflected rutabega puree was lovely but inadequate. The meat was riddled with gristle and passed onto the human garbage disposers in the group.\n\nConsidering the hit and miss nature of the menu and the lacking cocktails, we went elsewhere for our nightcap. The service was friendly, albeit not very attentive.  \n\nI am really disappointed that this place has 4 stars on Yelp. I am not a fan and would not encourage others to come.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

Two entrees were inedible and tasted like Major Sysco's sauces.  The charcuterie was skimpy and pricey.  The drinks were also pricey for pedestrian mixes and standard wines (think Trader Joe's).  The mussels were fair but had an odd red cabbage addition which made the frites soggy.  The pork chop was covered in gallopy sauce.  The wait staff is clearly stretched with the number of tables they have to serve.  The brussels sprouts were very good-- the highlight of the meal.  If you decide to go, make sure you are downstairs where it is less likely to be 85 degrees, and you have a chance to skip out after a drink and small plate.

So I find a restaurant that peaks my interest and offers the ability to order takeout online. The menu here is very broad and offers some comfort food which I can use one of my cheat days on. Having skipped lunch today I ordered the spicy fried chicken and the steak burger with fries. Hey I am a growing boy in the gym 6 days a week, don't judge me. The pick up process was easy than I thought, the hostess greeted me, promptly picked up my order and away I went back into the crazy tourist area of Union Square. Once I got back to my hotel I dove into my food, the burger was cooked perfectly medium rare with tons of flavor, fries crispy and seasoned well. Oh I did also order a second meal for myself, the spicy fried chicken with crispy skin and delicious white meat to die for.

Luckily, there was a table available by the front and we were seated right away.\n\nHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm\n*Wings: sous vide organic wings, korean BBQ ($6)\n*Mussels: shallots, chorizo, white wine, herbs ($10)\n*Chimi Churri Steak Taco: chipotle aioli, aged cheddar ($8)\n*Brussels Sprouts: toasted nori, fish sauce caramel ($5)\n*House Cut Fries: chipotle aioli ($4)\n*House Wine ($8): Red x2, White x2\n\nWe made it in time for HH. Yay! Decided to order the whole HH snacks menu. The taco plate was perfect for sharing between the two of us. One taco each. I really wanted some beef, so this satisfied my craving. My other favorite dish was the mussels. Nice beefy broth from the chorizo. And the mussels themselves were tender. The fries were good for sopping up all the drinks we were having. (I actually finished them by myself later when we decided to buy a couple more bottles to drink at home.) The wings were a good size, but I thought the flavor was pretty average. I'm not a huge fan of sweet and salty together, so I thought the brussles were okay. The wines were good for HH wines. My gf drank the two whites which were a sauvignon blanc. I drank the two reds which I believe were pinots.\n\nRegular Menu:\n*Potato Leek Soup ($10)\n*De Novo Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander Valley 2014 ($13)\n*Smith Story Sauvignon Blanc 2014 ($14)\n\nMy gf loves soup, so she wanted to try the soup off the regular menu. I'm more of a brothy soup girl, but this was tasty. Not too heavy for a creamy soup. After HH ended, we wanted one more glass of wine each, so my gf got another sauvignon blanc. HH is a great deal as we saved $6 per glass on her white. I decided to change it up and get a cab since I like more full bodied wines.\n\nPlease note, there is a Yelp check in offer: 15% off your happy hour 5-7pm, which we were able to use for our bill. Saved us a little more than $15 which was nice. I sometimes check in after I leave a place, so I'm glad I checked in while we were here.\n\nGreat spot for HH. They have some very nice deals.

The food was superb and the customer service was outstanding! Jose, our waiter, was the best ever! Sunday's Happy Hour menu is not lengthy, but it was perfect for us. Our party of 5 shared several dishes of Mac n Cheese (with bacon), chicken wings, caramelized brussel sprouts, fries, meatballs and salad that was not on the menu, but prepared specially by the chef, just because we asked for salad. All of it was spectacular. The brussel sprouts with nori seaweed and caramelized fish sauce was to die for! My favorite dish! For dessert, we had the ricotta donuts with caramel sauce. We asked if the chef had anything chocolate, so he specially prepared a melted chocolate sauce! And the two sauces combined were divine.\n\nI can't say enough about the staff! The ambience and atmosphere is casual, hip, with a great vibe and great music! We will definitely be back.", "author": "Lynn F."}

The menu online looked decent enough and the restaurant seemed nice.\n\nThe restaurant looks great and the staff is very friendly and attractive. Our waitress was adorable, but she was clearly new. I had no problem with her service except for when she neglected to ask me a very important question (see below, re the boar dish).\n\nThey had a Valentine's Day menu that we passed on since it was a four course dinner with no substitutions and the selected courses chosen didn't sound all that appetizing. Also, I had my mind set on having their steak.\n\nShortly after seating, our waitress informed us that they were out of many items on their already small menu. Including steak. They ran out of steak. That didn't leave us very many options.\n\nFortunately, they had the appetizers we wanted to try, which were, in fact, appetizing. My girlfriend had her eye on the gnocchi as her main course, which they didn't run out of, so she at least got to order what she wanted. I, on the other hand, had only a few choices.\n\nI decided to order the boar since I've never had it before and I love trying new foods. Plus I've always loved pork chops growing up. Can't go wrong with pig, right? Wrong.\n\nWhen the main courses arrived, my girlfriend was presented with a large serving of gnocchi while I had the most disappointingly small serving of boar chops. For the price, I could have got a much larger steak. If they didn't run out, that is.\n\nThe gnocchi was under seasoned and it tasted off so my girlfriend sent it back after a few bites. I tried it, too. It wasn't good. Aside from the appetizers, all she ate here was their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert, which she did like.\n\nWhen I cut into my boar, I was surprised to see that it was cooked rare. Rare. Pig cooked rare. \n\nAt what restaurant do they not ask you how you want your meat cooked when you order? I assumed boar, like regular pork, would come to me cooked. It didn't occur to me that I should have had to tell them how to cook it, especially since they didn't ask me how I wanted it.\n\nI should have sent it back to the kitchen to at least be warmed up, but instead I hopped on my phone and Googled to see if rare boar was safe to eat. I got conflicting answers, but I guess it's okay. I like my steak rare, but the thought of biting into rare pig still made me uncomfortable.\n\nI decided to try it anyway. I cut off a couple of small pieces. Didn't like the flavor, didn't like the texture, and didn't like the idea of biting off a bigger piece of undercooked pig so I just ate the salad included with my meal (salad was great) and asked for a box for the boar so that my pets at home could at least enjoy a nice meal since we weren't. Honestly, I would have rather had any cheap porkchop than their wild boar. I don't know if I'll ever order boar again anywhere.\n\nAfter spending $100 on a meal, my girlfriend and I left unsatisfied and still hungry.\n\nI would not come back here or recommend it.", "author": "Marcus A."}

I was ushered in even though there were few customers inside and it was fairly late (around 9:30) and sat at the bar. First of all the bartenders are super friendly and as I was pretty sick and feeling cruddy, make me a delicious hot toddy and even gave it to me at happy hour prices (rather than the steep $13 or so cocktail prices). I only got the soup as I was minimally hungry and frankly, the menu is pretty expensive. The squash curry soup was served in a decent sized bowl and had a lovely orange colour with plenty of chunks of pumpkin (I think?) plus hazelnuts (I think) which enhanced the rich flavour. Plus the soup is dotted with pink flower petals. Great for when as I was sick as I was. I was tempted by the sauteed cauliflower but maybe next time I'm in SF. Thanks guys for the good conversation.

I am a neighbor who has frequented Aliment out of convenience, but no more.  My experience is that they use every trick in the book to misrepresent their pricing.  The latest example:  they advertise \"Happy Hour from 5 -7\" on a billboard in front of the restaurant.  What they don't advertise is that you have to be sitting in a particular section of the restaurant to receive that price.  Of course you don't find that out until you receive the check.  I escalated it to the Manager and he said \"too bad, it's always been that way\" (Jose).  I just cannot continue to support a business that has deceptive marketing.", "author": "Christina W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-19", "description": "Lived in the neighborhood for 9 years and like my friends & neighbors, we were all initially excited when Aliment first opened its doors to have new spot in the hood. Unfortunately, my experiences at this place have consistently been disappointing. \n\nI recently stopped by for dinner and after a longer than usual wait, our server made his way to take our order and apologized for the delay, which we were fine with because we noticed he was swamped. Shortly after our drinks arrived, the section emptied out. With the exception of requesting water refills a couple of times, everything was fine until our food arrived and we were suddenly being served by some other server, which we weren't fully aware of this until the end of the evening. While this isn't a big deal, it's rude to abandon a table with nothing being said to the customers. Not to mention that we weren't asked how our entrees were, which unfortunately, my burger was terribly disappointing. It was way overcooked; the bun was dense, heavy and overall flavorless. I would have shared my distain had anyone come back to check-in. On the flip side, the Brussels sprouts and gnocchi were decent. \n\nWhile our plates were still on the table and the other person in my party was still working on his food, our new server announced it was \"last call for the kitchen\" and asked if she could bring us dessert menus. I was little taken back given I wasn't even certain who this person was and we technically weren't done eating. When we declined, she plunked the check down on the table and came back a few minutes later to clear our plates and collect payment. Since I ended up eating less than half of the burger, I asked to take it with me and she handed a box to pack up it myself. Not the most classy move, but on par with the rest of our experience. The reason that I chose to take the leftover was to pass it on to a homeless person who was camped out front.\n\nWhen we were paying our check, I asked where our server disappeared to and was plainly told that he went home. As we were leaving the restaurant, we noticed him sitting at the bar enjoying drinks and food with his buddies. Again, this isn't a huge deal but having worked in restaurants and the hospitality industry myself for several years it's courtesy and common sense to let tables know you're going home, which only takes a minute. I mean he clearly had enough time to order food and get planted at the bar. I can also appreciate the wait staff's desire to call it a night, but rushing patrons through their meal and obviously clearing the table ASAP and making us feel like we were imposing is unprofessional, especially when there's service staff is chilling at the bar. \n\nDue to similar experiences that I described, I've only been to Aliment a few times with the last time being about a year and a half ago. Thinking enough time had passed and there might have been a shift in management and staff I thought I'd give it try again. Sadly, I was reminded why I don't frequent this restaurant. Furthermore, I notified management the next day about this rough experience and never heard back. Needless to say, the neighborhood is all too curious to see what moves into the space next.", "author": "Derwood A."}

Amazing drinks, although super spendy $13 per cocktail for half a rocks glass. Smalls: Squash soup is amazing, although rimming the bowl with ground red pepper and lime was a bit weird--I would prefer them on the side so I can move my bowl without getting sticky. Brussels sprouts were delicious and tender while packed with flavor. For my entree I had the Barramundi. The cold couscous side salad was just weird and played next to the fish. The barramundi was overcooked and dry--not to mention small for $23 and served with really hard bacon. The fish was so tough I hard to cut it with my knife. When I pierced the thickest portion with my fork, the flesh disintegrated. The parsnip mash was delicious, though. I wish I had more than a tablespoon of it.\n\n My husband's medium rare steak was cold, which was odd since my fish was so hot I burned my tongue on it. The flavors were completely on point,you and the sweet potatoes were slightly crispy on the outside but melted in you mouth when you bit into them. Definitely a meal worth it's price if the steak is warm.\n\n My daughter's burger was amazing. One word--beer bun. So delicious! The homemade refrigerator pickles were thin, crunchy, and a delicate masterpiece. \n\nFinally, despite complaining to 2 separate servers about my fish, it remained on my bill. One asked if they could make me something  else, but I didn't have time to wait  I'm not one to make a scene, so I didn't push the issue. I'm not sure we'll be back despite so much of the food being delicious. That fish should never have left the kitchen.", "author": "Dorinda G."}

They sat us upstairs in our own semi-private area, and it was really nice to actually hear each other speak, which I feel like is rare in restaurants these days! \n\nWe started off with a few rounds of small plates (and a few rounds of wine...duhzzz) and I think it's safe to say that we tried nearly everything. What was in the mix:\n\n-Sweet and crunchy Brussel sprouts. I was a bit nervous about the fish sauce, but it added a really nice flavor.\n-Kale salad with shaved parmesan\n-Salad with some sort of creamy cheese (tasted like a blend of goat and ricotta) with sweet potatoes. It was dressed in a sweet brown sugar dressing which I loved. \n-Crispy chicken bites coated in ramen. So unique!\n-Korean BBQ riblets in a sweet and tangy sauce\n-A pot of mussels (which they originally brought out because they heard that instead of brussels, and ended up letting us keep) \n\nAfter all of that...it was time for mains.

Although the pasta bolognese and gnocchi sounded divine I was too full for a big bowl of pasta and ended up with another small plate, shrimp and grits.\n\nVery solid choice on my part.

I adore the open kitchen design so you can eat/drink at the counter, or even on the first floor dining space, and watch the chefs in action. The owners have made a brilliant use of space with the overhead loft hovering just above the bottom floor seating area, and they don't jam tables and chairs together to maximize seating. Instead, parties are placed at comfortable distances. \n\nThe food is phenomenal. Great for sharing tapas-style, you can get a bunch of small dishes for the table (and quite reasonably priced), or opt to have your own main. I enjoy how they have turned rather bland greens such as kale, Brussels sprouts, and artichokes into really spectacular eats. They tone down raw kale by shredding and tossing in a light cream dressing, and peppering with parm cheese. They flash-roast the Brussel sprouts and drizzle them in a sweet and syrupy \"fish sauce.\" They even have an interesting take on \"chicken nuggets.\" They take white meat bite-sized chicken strips and batter it in a mix of crumbs and crushed ramen noodles. Water glasses are constantly refilled, and the staff are consistently chipper and accommodating. Wine selection is sparse but sufficient, and you can enjoy full bottles at reasonable prices, or enjoy single glasses with incredibly generous pours. \n\nAlthough only open for dinner, it's well worth the wait for an evening meal.

I've been here three times since they've opened hoping to finally have landed a fun neighborhood restaurant and bar; what a let down. \n\nA friend and I came in for dinner and there were three people seated, rest of the place was empty. Bar tender had to tell us to take a seat and then yelled around the restaurant for the waitress to tell her that someone was here and needed menus. Ok... not an amazing start, but no worries. \n\nWe order and our food arrives - totally undercooked. In fact, my table mates good was physically cold to the touch. When we flagged down our waitress her response was: \"oh no, that's not good...\" [long awkward silence and stares] \"...did you want me to see if the kitchen could warm it back up or?\" -- lady, the kitchen didn't warm it back up to begin with??\n\nThe individual entrees were grossly over priced.

Their eclectic menu is full of comfort food --ranging from salads/small plates to large, extremely filling entrees!\n\nThey do have a great wine list but let's skip to the most important part, The Food:\n\nTo start, we ordered multiple small plates for the table to try which included the fried brussels sprouts {...with a sweet and caramel-y sauce that was to die for}, kale salad, roasted squash salad {loved the hazelnuts!}, Asian inspired riblets {...so tender and fell off of the bone!}, ramen crusted chicken tenders with a heavenly sweet/mustard-y sauce {these were tied with the brussels as my fav}. We probably {ok, definitely} over-indulged on the small plates because oh em gee, my tummy was satisfied after all of that. \n\nBUT of course, we're foodies and couldn't stop there. I ordered the Bolognese for my entree and not only was it a massive portion,  but it was very meat-y {...duh, the best kind of Bolognese!} I literally ate about half of it and had to stop, my stomach was literally about to explode. {...which is so unlike me, I'm always a member of the clean plate club.} Dear hungry men, order this dish! \n\nWe were way too full for dessert but I am sure their desserts are fabulous as well!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-05", "description": "Upon a recommendation by a friend, I dined at Aliment in a group of six, which turned out to be the perfect group size. We got one of each of everything except the burger, salads, and the butcher board. We also got extra of fried chicken bits, brussels sprouts, and steak, because they were our favorites of the night.\n\nTo go along with the food, we got a bottle of the Samsara pinot noir and (I think) the Alexander Valley cabernet sauvignon. Both were wonderful and went very well with each of the dishes. Service was great and everything was wonderful. Highly recommend Aliment for a tasty dinner. Recap of dishes below:\n\nMUST HAVES:\n- Fried chicken bits: Small pieces of fried chicken. Not dry, lots of flavor, great crust. I also loved the pickles.\n- Riblets: Yum, so delicious! So juicy, tender, and flavorful. Arguably my favorite dish of the evening. The collard greens were great as an accompaniment.\n- Steak: Perfectly medium rare. Loved the chimichurri sauce and carrot puree. Portion size is pretty big too.\n- Pork belly: How can anyone turn down delicious pork belly? The kimchi was a great topping and I loved the crunch rice ovalettes.\n- Foie gras meatballs: Yum yum yum. Texture was soft and there's lots of flavor. The salad on the side was extremely lackluster though.\n- Brussels sprouts: \n\nJUST OKAY\n- Mussels: Compared to the other dishes, I thought this was just okay. It was yummy but not as interesting as some of the other offerings.\n- Pastrami short rib: I think the rest of the group would disagree with me and put it as a must have, but I didn't think this was as great as the other dishes. The concept was new and interesting, but the other meat dishes were better, IMO. The egg was awesome though.\n- Trout cakes: Kinda like crab cakes. It was delicious, but was slightly fishy, so that's why I didn't put it in the must have category.\n\nWOULD SKIP\n- Arctic char roulade: This was perhaps the weakest dish of the evening. The fish was overcooked and there wasn't enough flavor.\n- Gnocchi: There's probably better gnocchi elsewhere.\n- Lamb: It's not bad, but also didn't stand out. I would skip this and save room for the other meat dishes.", "author": "Sherry L."}

The steak came out looking blue rare, even though it was asked for medium well.  The boar wrapped with bacon looked good on first glance, but when I cut into it with a knife it looked as rare as the steak.  At first I thought maybe it was OK and bit into the center, but the meat was literally raw, so I had to send it back.  After a while a woman who was not the waiter showed up and said something about the boar being prepared sous vide (lol) and that it's 'usually served rare, but if you want us to heat it more we can do that'.   As I'm sitting there I'm thinking wouldn't it be great if you could ask your guests if they want their meat defaulted to dripping blood.  Anyway, after they cooked it some more and re-served it the waiter started coming back every five minutes to ask if it's OK.  Towards the end I was still working on the salad on the plate, and mid-chew while my utensils were down the guy came by and took the plate, asking if he had permission but not waiting for a response, causing me to immediately lose what remained of a paltry appetite.

It was disappointing, but they were really nice about letting us choose alternative drinks and not charging us for them!  \n\nDrinks that we did end up getting:\n- George's dragon: strong on the vinegar and ginger, but interesting  \n- Caipirihna de framboesa: a little sweet for me, but you can taste the cachaca, which is nice  \n- Marley in the mountains: interesting combination of flavors, but I'm not a huge fan of the singani 63\n\nFood: \n- Brussels sprouts: with fish sauce caramel. The brussels sprouts were nicely roasted, and the sauce was a good mix of savory and sweet. I liked this a lot\n- Chickpea meatballs: good texture, and the harissa glaze, feta, and tomato chutney had lots of flavor\n- Korean fried chicken: good sauce, but I wish there were more of it. The breast meat ended up kind of dry, but it was a really big portion\n- Ricotta gnocchi: definitely add pork belly for texture and flavor; the gnocchi was very pillowy, but it would have been nice to have a sear on it for some extra texture. It's also a big portion, and I think it's better for sharing\n- Salmon cakes: the salmon itself was fine, but I liked the stuff underneath more - sunchoke puree, roasted mushrooms, beets, salsify\n- Kurobuta pork chop: good flavor but unfortunately dry\n\nI would get the brussels sprouts and chickpea meatballs again - I think the appetizers were the highlight.

It has an open ceiling, dim lighting, and rustic furniture, giving it a very nice and comfortable vibe for dinner. We ordered: 3 brussel sprouts (lol, yes, they were that good), mussels, fettuccine, and pork tenderloin. The pork was very disappointing - bland and not cooked well. Surprisingly though, the roasted vegetables that came on the size were cooked to perfection, and was definitely everyone's favorite part of the dish. If I based my review on the ambiance and the food, I probably would have given 4 starts overall, but well, let's talk a bit about the service that night.\n\nUpon ordering our drinks, our waitress put in all our drink orders, along with a martini that one of my friends ordered. Whatever drink came out was not a martini, so my friend nicely mentioned what liquors he was expecting to be in it and the waitress responded with \"I know what a gin martini is made with.\" Seriously? I don't know what sort of training she went through but from my experiences, you never talk to a customer like that in the food business. Strike 1.\n\nWe also received bread that was really fresh and went well with the sauce the mussels came with. When we asked the waitress for a second order of bread, she did this really big hesitant sigh, looked at us for a second like she didn't want to give us more bread, then turned towards the kitchen and left. We thought it was odd but she did bring us a second basket of bread so we brushed it off. We finish up eating, and when the bill comes, I look through it and see a charge for extra bread, $4. If you're going to charge us for bread, at least tell your customers, and not just mischievously slip it in the bill. Strike 2.\n\nSo this last part was what really just put me over the edge. I rarely give a place 1 star but this waitress gave us one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been through. When she handed us the bill, she also said, \"Oh by the way, I took off the gin martini, it's on us.\" We all thought it was a very nice gesture as that's what a lot of places do occasionally when they mess up on an order. I look over the bill, and the gin martini is still there, so we call her back over and point out that the martini was still charged. She goes \"Oh I meant the first martini that was sent back to the bar, I know you didn't drink it but we still made you 2 drinks.\" Are you kidding me? Throughout my years and years of dining/bar experiences, I have never heard of anything like this. Why would you say you're comping the drink when the customer didn't even drink it........? Unbelievable, Strike 3.\n\nI really thought a restaurant like Aliment would have had better service, but it was truly a huge disappointment and I unfortunately will not be coming back here. Aliment, please do something to change the way your waitresses/waiters are trained as it really is hurting the business.", "author": "Angela K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-06", "description": "With an empty stomach and high hopes of a good meal a friend of mine and I attended Aliment hoping for a night of good eats. \n\nThough the place is small, it does have a rather nice ambience and the staff were friendly at the start. We waited entirely too long for water, but the waitress who was watching our area was quite busy so that was understandable. \n\nOnce we placed our order, the brussel sprout appetizer came out quickly which was really quite good. Unfortunately, this was the last thing that went right with the meal. \n\nWhile I'm not usually a burger guy in an establishment such as this, my friend told me that he'd had it before and it was a great burger.  I generally go off suggestions from those with experience, so we both ordered the same burger for our dinner. \n\n20 minutes after ordering our waitress returned to let us know that they were \"Out of burgers.\"\nWHO runs out of burgers?? We substituted our second best choice as we'd seen a nearby diner receiving it for her meal, so thought it might be a good substitute. \n\nOnce the Korean Style Fried Chicken arrived, I was disappointed to find out that the only thing \"Korean\" about it was the incredibly spicy BBQ sauce that it was drowning in. Trying a few bits of the bird that weren't doused, I discovered that the sauce was the only thing providing it with flavor as there was no real spice to the batter the bird had been fried in. While my friend decided to settle for what was already in front of him, I decided that I wasn't going to punish myself by trying to finish this poorly executed mess. \n\nI politely went and found the waitress standing with one of her coworkers and explained that the meal was both too spicy and not something I could eat, and asked if she could please remove it from the tab. She suggested I take a look at the menu for a replacement, and I  settled for my third choice of salmon cakes. \n\nSigh... \nHonestly this just isn't a well thought out dish. While the salmon cakes were ok, there were a lot of things going on with the dish that didn't seem to really have any connection to any other item on the plate. The small mushrooms were fine, but seemed an odd pairing with the fish as they weren't prepared together or in the same fashion. There was an interesting starchy root vegetable that was plated with this, but it was cold compared with the the rest of the ingredients and seem to only serve the function of visual interest, while totally lacking flavor or preparation. There were huge wedges of what smelled like smoked beets but tasted like something dumped straight out of a can, and all of this sat in a lukewarm puddle of sunchoke sauce, which again seemed to be in no way related to anything else on the plate. \n\nUnfortunately the hopeful name of Aliment is a complete misnomer. In this case Ailment is much more apropos. There's a lot of great food in San Francisco.

We were both so impressed at how sleek and inviting this place was. Although we didn't have ressies (which you can make on opentable), the hostess brought us upstairs to an upstairs loft-style dining area. Also upstairs is a separate room for more seating or even private parties (at least there was one at the time we had dinner). \n\nSo, the menu consists of lots of different small plates (chicken, foie gras, mussels, salads) along with a handful of entree selections (pasta, burger, steak, fish). Menu does seem to change based on what's in season or Chef's selections, so keep that in mind when ordering (as items may not be exactly as stated on the website). The menu items are simple, yet with surprising element. For example, there was fried chicken bites as a small plate, but they were 'RAMEN fried chicken bites.' They were crisp to perfection and the chicken super juicy. The spaghetti bolognese was amazing, but had a hint of spiciness to it (according to my dinner date). We shared the kale salad (and Hunter Pence would definitely approve)! I had the burger, which was outstanding, and one of the best in SF (in my humble opinion). Tender and mouthwatering and medium to perfection. Fries were also perfectly crisp and seasoned. Both of us weren't following our 'diet,' as we were in a lovey celebratory (and catch-up) mood!\n\nService is friendly and prompt. Water served upon request (for all restos now in the Bay Area due to our severe drought). Prices are reasonable and won't break the bank. Decent wine and beer selection, too!\n\nCan't wait to return to Aliment to try more dishes.\nGo on and try it for yourself!

There are about a trillion menus in SF offering small plates and New American upscale fare, but so many do such an average job of pumping out said dishes. Aliment's menu selections hit home with me and they delivered on quality. \n\nThe menu here offers a few salads, some bar snacks, a selection of small plates and some full entrees, so there's something for everyone. I went with the wedge salad with smoked 1000-island dressing. This is a twist on the classic wedge, with three small romaine wedges grilled, then topped with a delicious smoked dressing and some fried shallots. So, so delicious. Next up, the brussels, which seem to be the house specialty. They have nori and fish sauce glaze. Perfectly cooked, insanely good. I could eat these sweet, salty, fishy morsels every day. The fish sauce is pretty light (for my standards), so don't be put off by that description. It's just a hint. I paired these with the burger. My current diet necessitates removing the bun and fries, and going with a side salad next to the burger instead. The patty is large and the meat quality very good. Great flavor, cooked a perfect mid-rare, with a nice cheese and pickles. Perfection. \n\nTo drink, I enjoyed a nice French pink, and then a glass of Sancerre. Both worthy. Staff here is on point. Friendly, welcoming, funny. The dude behind the bar is totally enjoyable. The space itself has a night lightness to it, while still feeling cozy and intimate. \n\nTotal for my meal including a salad, small plate and burger with two glasses of wine? $50. In SF, or anywhere, I consider that solid. Especially considering the wine clocked in at around $20-$25 of the total bill. \n\nAliment is worthy of much more than the (current) 3.5-star rating on Yelp.

Mussels- didnt try the actual mussels bc im not a fan of shellfish, but the sauce was bomb, and it was a huge bowlful.  salted cod cakes (comes with 2),  ricotta gnocchi (small serving, very good), baby back riblets, butlers steak, kurabuta pork belly, kale salad (little overdressed, but really good), pastrami short ribs (very peppery/salty and good), grilled rack of lamb (3 pieces), fried brussel sprouts (very sweet, but delish).  \n\nAnyway was not disappointed with any of our choices.  We also got some wine, which was nice high pours but only complaint there was that the price of a bottle is the same price as 4 glasses, so there isnt really a point to getting a bottle.

Aliment was every bit of awesome you could expect.  Rather than \"bottomless\" mimosas, they do \"topless\" mimosas.  Our server was on it too!  \n\nTo start, we ordered the french fries which came with a jalapeno aoli and smoked ketchup.  I loved the jalapeno aoli.  It's a tastier alternative to ranch.  The smoked ketchup was also pretty tasty and definitely unique.  The fries were light and flavorful free of grease.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken with waffle balls.  Unfortunately, I ate too many fries and couldn't finish it, but I had no problem passing off the leftovers to others at our table.  The fried chicken was white meat, had a light flavor and was free of grease.  It came with  a light arugula salad and waffle balls topped with powdered sugar to dip in some molasses.  They tasted a lot like beignets- sooooo good.  \n\nMy bf ordered the braised short rib hash with potatoes, greens and slow cooked eggs.  I can't comment on it.  Because he ate the whole thing before I considered trying it.  Apparently, it was good!\n\nThe other two ordered the smoked fish benedict and continental breakfast.  Both of them enjoyed their food.  The continental breakfast was pretty large.  From what I remember observing, it came with some salami, granola with blueberries, fruit, and cheeses.  The presentation on a chop block was pretty cool.\n\nAs for the venue itself, it is very spacious with high ceilings, and the decor is very minimalist with white walls, brown tones and that carbonized wood textured look- very chic.  They had a makeshift fireplace on the wall going with a projector.  It was a nice touch to the atmosphere.  \n\nI'd totally come back again for brunch if not lunch or dinner.

Between the three of us, we split three plates: the fried brussel sprouts, mussels, and gnocchi. The brussel sprouts and gnocchi are considered small while the mussels are big. The server recommended that each person order two small plates or one big one, but the three of us were actually quite full after splitting these three. I would advise you to order a few and keep going if you want. \n\nIn less than ten minutes, we received our small plates. I don't think I've ever gotten y food that quickly, even at McDonald's or a fast food restaurant. The brussel sprouts were amazingly crisp on the outside, flavored well with the fish sauce. There was a healthy amount to split as well. \n\nThe gnocchi had a great flavor as it had this zesty aioli on top and a lot of Parmesan cheese. But seriously, there were only a few gnocchi pieces and it was way too small for our liking. \n\nThe mussels, as expected, had the most. There was a large portion of mussels cooked with chorizo in this spicy broth. It was mild, and went well with the two pieces of wheat bread on the side. \n\nWe also split a rhubarb tart ($9) for dessert and it wasn't too sweet at all! They added a little bit of vanilla ice cream and mint garnishes on top. It was the perfect sweet note to end our meal on. \n\nOverall, our experience was great. The servers were kind and attentive, and the atmosphere was relaxed. It is on the pricier end, but if you come with a friend or two, you can split a good amount while enjoying diverse plates.", "author": "Jane H."}

I chose to order ricotta gnocchi, which looked like something out of a Chef Boyardee can and made me sick for the entire following day. My girlfriend ordered scallops which looked like they had been lazily seared and thrown on top of some seriously over-seasoned and spicy goop. \n\nSitting next to us, there was a couple that seemed to have a similar reaction to their dinner.

The meat sauce was tomatoe-y and beefy without being too heavy. \nI had the Butler's Steak with carrot puree, broccolini, king trumpets, fried lemon and fried potato croquettes. The portion was huge, a lot of steak! I was a bit disappointed when the waitress didn't allow any substitutions (swap out the potato croquettes for more broccolini) and they didn't have iced tea. The only non alcoholic beverages they had that night were sodas. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, was a bit too salty but balanced out with the sweet carrot puree. I'm not sure what's up with the potato croquettes because mine were very cold in the center! Both of them tasted like it was refrigerated, then taken out and recooked but didn't get warmed up fully.

I've had great potato gnocchi before but correct me if I'm wrong, is the texture of gnocchi supposed to be wet and mushy?

Sadly, we also wasted $4 to add pork belly to the dish. \n\nBeet and Arugula Salad w/Quinoa was excellent. The saving grace of the night. But really? The salad was the best dish? Laughable.\n\nThe Bolognese was nothing to write home about but at least it was edible and they didn't skimp out on the meat...there was A LOT of meat sauce but it was surprisingly bland. You'd think that when you pay $18 for a single serving of pasta it'd blow your socks off or something! I can make better pasta at home so why bother coming back? \n\nThe service and staff were good so that's why I choose to rate 2 stars. 1 star for the salad and another for the nice waiter and guy who seated us at our table.

The chicken meat felt like biting into an edible pillow. The exterior was crunchy due to the short pieces of ramen. The contrast of these two textures made me wish I had a bottomless stomach. Never wanted to stop eating this dish! But now that I hyped it up, maybe your expectations will be too high. Do yourself a favor and pretend you never read my review.\n\nThe Riblets (Korean BBQ and kimchi) was decent. The meat was aight and the kimchi was aight, aight? \n\nThe Kale salad was topped off with toasted pepitas, parmesan, and avocado vin. More than anything, this dish was cheesy. It's a salad made for people who want to like healthy food but can't stand it. So marry that nutritious kale with handfuls of cheese! But me personally, less cheese please. \n\nThe Lamb Sirloin with tatziki, harrissa and zatar spice was my second favorite dish after the Ramen Fried Chicken Bits. \n\nInterior was not too loud, thus a good spot for carrying out conversations. The design was pretty simple. Nothing fancy. Once you have a bite of that Ramen Chicken, you won't notice anything else anyways!", "author": "Mina O."}

I enjoyed the flavor of the food, but I must say that everything I tried was overly salty (and I generally enjoy a little extra salt on my food too). \n\nBrussel Sprouts (4.5/5) - Being Vietnamese, I LOVE fish sauce, so this was great for me. I am used to the saltiness of fish sauce, but it was definitely overwhelming in this dish. Aside from the saltiness, the flavor was very good though.\n\nPork Chop (3.5/5) - The pork chops were nice and juicy, which generally is hard to achieve for pork chops. I wasn't the biggest fan of the eggplant and salad on the side though. The eggplant was too soggy for my taste, and the dressing on the salad was pretty acidic. Although the pork chops were cooked very well, once again it was a little too salty for me. \n\nI also tried some of my friends Foie Gras Meatball from her Carbonara dish.

It was me and three others from SF Foodies (Meetup Group).  We had a 7pm dinner starting with the wonderful Fried Brussel Sprouts which this restaurant is known for (we ended up getting THREE orders throughout the meal!)  The menu on these reads \"fish sauce caramel and toasted nori, sesame seeds\"  WOW!  I also started with a glass of the Sancerre, as well as some Streak Fries, which were wonderful!  We ordered a cheese plate for an appetizer too, which was nice but very little bread was brought out.  No bother, I asked for more bread and it was brought very quickly, and I believe a third bunch brought out without anyone asking.  I've had better cheese plates (i.e. Bistro Boudin) but it certainly wasn't bad.\n\nFor the meal we had exactly six choices to choose from.  I wished there were more choices, but there were a few I could have had, so it's not like I couldn't find something.  I ordered the Pork Chop (\"spaetzle, mustard greens and apple ginger glaze\") and it was A) HUGE and B) AMAZING!  Two others at my table ordered the same and the fourth had the Monkfish.  The dinner was extremely delicious and the restaurant in general was wonderful!

The staff is always very friendly, and you usually don't have to wait more than an hour for a table without a reservation.

The execution in the restaurant was simply lacking. The place is decorated to match the charm of a welcoming Subway. Our drinks tasted like wine spritzers mixed with straight liquor, which probably shouldn't have been a surprise seeing as the bartender was literally wearing a shirt that read \"More vodka? Why not!\"\n\nA little frustrated with this place, because some of the food was actually good. The steak burger was tasty and the brussel sprouts had an interesting flavor that showed forethought. Fish caramel sprouts do not sound appetizing off the bat, but they were excellent. A lot of the other dishes also looked good, however the gnocchi that we ordered tasted like it may have been missing a few ingredients.\n\nIf anyone in the restaurant is reading this, a few suggestions:\n-Have the staff wear matching simple black t-shirts. Quick, easy fix. Some servers were dressed in a business casual way that made them tough to identify, and the bartender's shirt speaks for itself ha\n-Hire an interior designer to give the place some simple color/pattern concepts. As mentioned above, fake-looking veneer wood and basic table/chairs make the place look cheaper than it should\n-Decide which vibe you're shooting for. If that's happy hour, great, go for it. If that's more of a dinner restaurant, the projected TV on the wall showing ESPN2 is far more of a detractor than a benefit. You can even keep the TVs and just shut them down at a certain time, or switch to a more compelling/ambience-building channel than a B-level college basketball game that no one is watching.\n-If you're offering cocktails, make sure they're well made. If not, stick to beer, wine, and well. \n\n\nThis place certainly has potential and I think they could make a few quick changes to improve the experience substantially, but for now I would recommend friends to skip it.

Of course you didn't...unless you are the chef and waitress! \n\nWe wanted to give this place a chance so instead ordered another meal, the scallops. We received them and they were so salty.

So obviously he was lying.\n\nWe decided to go to the bar to see if there was a manager. The bar manager Jerry was there. We explained the situation to him. Although he was nice and accommodating (he took off our wine corkage at least), he made it a point to tell us that the burger comes that way if we order it medium rare. That is fine if we order it medium rare, but we didn't.  Meanwhile our waiter was literally standing right behind us breathing down our back to see if we tipped him! Wow...the audacity!

Definitely, if you are eating here, get those. The soup was very disappointing. It was just very... bland. We only ate a few bites before giving up on it. It needed more salt for sure.

Her justification? \"Our salad tastes terrible without the dressing.\" Then she went on to badger us about \"who eats kale without dressing?!\" When we brought this to the attention of the manager that salad with dressing to the side isn't a big request he doubled down on their \"policy\" of not serving the dressing to the side for the kale salad because it is \"inedible\" otherwise.

In Aliment's case, they are referred to as topless mimosas, which makes the idea even more alluring. \n\nA group of four of us tried out Aliment for brunch on a Saturday and had a great time. It wasn't too loud, which brunch can sometimes be, so it was nice to be able to hear what my friends were saying. Or course, we ordered mimosas and the server did a pretty good job at keeping them refilled. Sometimes our glasses got completely empty (gasp!) but he wasn't too far behind on the refill. They don't bring pitchers and refill at your table, they actually take your glasses to the bar and refill them, which was a different mimosa experience for me, but still a fun one. \n\nI ordered the smoked fish benedict and really enjoyed it. Perfectly portioned and super fresh tasting. I ate every bit on the plate. My husband ordered the fried chicken and waffle balls and LOVED the chicken; and that man knows his fried chicken. He wasn't crazy about the waffle balls though. \n\nOur out of town friends ordered the french toast and burger. Our burger friend said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had, which I think is a huge statement! He was really excited about Aliment and can't wait to move to the Bay Ayrea. Aliment, you left quite an impression! I can't wait to return and try their dinner!", "author": "Liz M."}

The only item that was fit for me was an appetizer, so I ordered the scallops.  They were good. Not great, but good.\n\nI also requested a side of a green veggie.   In my head, this should be easy, but this request couldn't be accommodated.I offered to pay for this, clearly. Didn't care what it was if it was green.  Very disappointed. \n\nFinally, there was a movie projecting on the big wall.

Definitely book ahead as it gets really busy, and be aware it is breezy by the door if you're sitting near it (they have to leave it open to air it out for the people eating on the 2nd floor, we were told). The foie gras meatballs were exotic sounding, but tasted like traditional meatballs, I couldn't really tell the difference. Mac and cheese was a standout too.

A few weeks later I came back with someone I was dating as I was raving about it, only to be left really disappointed.\n\nWe got the oysters, pork shoulder, scallops and Brussels sprouts. The oysters were good, pork shoulder lacked flavor, and Brussel sprouts were extremely over salted!! My dude loves salt and even he thought it was way too salty. It had so much of a teriyaki like glaze on it too. We couldn't eat it! He was bummed off the pork shoulder and the sprouts that he didn't want anything else. I convinced him to get the scallops since they were delicious the first time I was there and he loves scallops. Another disappointment. It was extremely over salted as well! \n\nI don't know if there was a different Chef working when I was in that time but it was a total opposite experience.

Flavors of the accompanying sauces (one was a cherry glaze?) were too strong and odd. Hubs adores the brussel sprouts, despite his intense dislike for fish sauce. My massive pork chop with an arugula salad, though, was thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked! Our knowledgeable server diligently found hoppy beer for the hubs, and looked in to see how each course was received. Dessert was beautifully plated, but the crust on the apple pie was not buttery and flaky enough. \n\nAn upstairs loft for reservations, and the bar, booth, and window seats are on the first floor.

The restaurant wasn't exactly full at dinner time and yet the wait time for our dishes to come out (a steak dish ordered medium rare and a gnocchi dish) was about 45 minutes.  The restaurant was absurdly warm and yet the waitress came by only once to fill our water while we waited...with lukewarm water and she disappeared before we could notice and then ask for ice.  When the dishes came out, the steak was not just overcooked but nuked. The char on the outside was so severe it tasted carcinogenic and the inside was so \"well\" that it was just a far cry from the medium rare temperature it was ordered at. The gnocchi, my girlfriend told me was overcooked to the point that it was gummy. \nTo top it all off, when there was a minor issue regarding my open table reservation being accidentally cancelled, I called to say something like the food wasn't good so at least help me get the 100 opentable points back. The manager called me a f**king loser for calling about such a thing and hung up. \n\nIn short, stay away as there are far better places to eat in the area and you'll be treated better to boot.", "author": "Amir B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-29", "description": "I had watched this place remodel for a little while now and was super excited to see that it'd be a nice restaurant with a bar when they were adding the finishing touches.  Once opened, they would officially be the closest nice restaurant to me -- win.  After trying it last week, though, I can't say I'm impressed.  If this was any other restaurant, I would've given them 2 stars, but since they're new, I'll bump it to 3 while they work out the kinks.\n\nLast Friday, I had a hankering for fried chicken, so we were going to walk to Hops & Hominy.  On the way there, though, we noticed that aliment appeared to be open and were curious to check it out, so we stepped in there instead.  First impression: the restaurant looks really nice and they've obviously invested a great deal of money into it.\n\nOur waitress (who was super sweet) heavily recommended the braised spare ribs off of their sparse menu, so I gave it a shot.  We also ordered fried chicken and spaetzle with cheese to share.\n\nThe spaetzle was sooooooo good.  Comparable to ones that I've had at really good German restaurants.  Super cheesy and delicious like a German mac n cheese.  Ugh, so good.  Unfortunately, the same could not be said about the entrees.  The food was worst than \"not very good\", it was kind of... gross.  My first impression: they were pretty generous portions.  Quantity doesn't mean quality though.  \n\nThe first couple bites of the spare ribs (by the way, this dish is actually boneless) were pretty tasty, but anything after that was hard to put down because it's so rich and heavy.  That dish is best served as a small shared appetizer or a family style dish, not a single person entree.  I can see why the waitress would've thought it was good if she just had a bite of it.  We ended up taking most of it to go.\n\nThe fried chicken was just not good.  We got three pieces and each were of varying moisture levels on the dryer side, and none of them tasted seasoned at all.  The fried batter was so thick that it was soggy and coming off of the chicken.  It was sticking to my teeth, too, so I ended up taking off all of the fried stuff and just eating the meat.  There was so much fried batter left over that the waitress mistakenly thought I had fried chicken leftovers and almost packed it up for me.  The worst part about the dish, though, was the bed of lettuce that it came on.  I think they were going for massaged lettuce, but it came off as soggy week-old salad.  And it wasn't even cut up or pulled apart; all of the limp leaves were stuck together.\n\nWe ordered dessert, too, which was okay.  The grand total for an appetizer, a glass of wine, 2 entrees and a dessert was $85 including tax and tip.  Pricey, but it would've been totally fine if the food was good.  At least service was good.\n\nFor the prices that they're charging, this isn't going to be a neighborhood restaurant, and for what they're actually serving, this isn't going to be a destination restaurant either.  They just opened, though, so I'm still rooting for them to make some positive changes and make a splash in the neighborhood, if only because, selfishly, I want a really awesome restaurant in the 'hood.", "author": "Debbie L."}

The Brussels sprouts were the best part of the meal. \n\nFor the main course, we ordered the fettuccine and pork loin. The latter was overcooked, dry and underseasoned. Can I say that root vegetables that came with the pork loin saved the dish?! The fettuccine wasn't exciting; a little less salt, and a little more flavor would go a long way. The pasta itself was a good texture. \n\nThe one thing that stood out, in a negative sense, was the service. Right from the start, something was amiss. The waitress displayed a clear lack of communication skills and a lackadaisical attitude. I placed an order for a dirty GIN martini, but received a a drink with an orange peel in it. Upon asking our waitress why I didn't taste any gin in the drink, she asked me if I had tried it, and then justifies herself by describing the recipe and that she knows what a dirty martini is. Once she replaces my drink with a real gin martini,  it is disappointingly a mediocre one. Wouldn't you expect a place that boasts a menu of specialty cocktails that cost ~$15 to make a decent martini? Not here. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the waitress made it sound like the restaurant was doing us a favor by saying that she took off the first drink from the bill - the drink I hadn't even ordered, and returned after one sip because it had no gin.

My boyfriend and I checked it out on a Thursday evening and were seated immediately (we also had a reservation). There are probably about 5 booths, a few tables, and 2 sets of bar seating facing the street and kitchen. Our server was cordial and pleasant.\n\nWe ordered the brussel sprouts to share. Flavor was amazing - it was drenched in caramel fish sauce and reminded me of Vietnamese food. Also was cooked perfectly - they weren't undercooked (blech, bitter brussel sprouts) nor overcooked (crispy chips status). It's a really popular dish so when Aliment can make it at a consistent quality, it's worth trying.\n\nMy boyfriend had the pork shank and I ordered the roasted chicken. The bone of the pork shank was huge, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Rich flavor and the side of German pasta (don't remember the official term) really complemented it. The chicken was good - the dark meat was juicy and tender. The white meat portion was just a bit dry, but the flavor was still there. I also really enjoyed the chard/polenta side. The next day, the chicken leftovers were even more delicious (maybe the flavor had time to sink in?). The portions were super generous - I made 2 meals out of my entree.\n\nGreat spot for a date or small group of friends - reservations and Lyft ride recommended.", "author": "Brandy A."}

Take a taxi, park on the street, or park nearby in the Sutter-Stockton garage.  Don't be distracted by the many restaurants and shops otherwise you won't reach your final destination.  If you're on a date, consider this place since the ambiance really lends itself to a successful date and/or more dates in the future.  If you go in a small group like a double date, you'll have the extra benefit of sampling most of the items on the menu since they keep the menu fairly short so 1. won't confuse customers and 2. try to keep the quality up when needing to stock ingredients.  Overall, my group of 4 had a good time and the wine the waitress suggested went well with the food.\n\n* Brussel Sprouts = Considered to be the best thing on the menu.  The sauce and seasoning added to it makes the brussels sprouts taste like candy.  The brussels sprout still retain it's semi-bitter taste but with the sweetness, it's like eating sweet and salty popcorn.  Now, it did seem saltier towards the bottom and when we ordered a 2nd serving, it seemed heavy too.\n* Pastrami Short Ribs = Short ribs that taste like pastrami.  Sign me up.  It's a great appetizer to start the meal with.\n* Duck Bits = I think of this as curry with duck meat.  While tasty, I prefer going to a Thai restaurant for my duck curry.\n* Butler Steak = Medium rare and very tender.  The creamy carrot puree and potato croquettes were tasty and complimented the steak.\n* Pork Chop = Felt a little dry.  The sauce didn't really help in the taste department either (aka bland).\n* Halibut = Soft and flaky like a halibut should be.  Not bad.", "author": "Ronald L."}

There were a few tables eating and a couple people at the bar. The space is small but has a hip vibe and a few tables upstairs overlooking the bar and downstairs dining area. We sat along the window looking out on the street. The bartender who waited on us suggested a nice glass of wine for my girlfriend and made a Rosemary ginger soda for me as I don't drink and they didn't have any N/A beer; the soda was great. We started with the Meat & Cheese plate; it had two cheeses- Gouda and Point Reyes blue, two kinds of olives, two kinds of meat, lightly toasted bread,  some caramelized onion jam, lightly dressed arugula, and olive oil. It was very good. Next we ordered a pastrami slider, it was served on a pretzel bun but the pastrami is the star here, highly recommended! We also had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, the soup was excellent but the grilled cheese wasn't very cheesy, we liked it better with one of the pieces of bread removed. We split the Bolognese that the bartender recommended and we really enjoyed it; The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was rich with lots of meat. We had the hot chocolate cake for dessert and it was also excellent.

Our dishes took a very long time to emerge and when we received our appetizer, which was duck rillettes with blini, we asked for additional blini only to be sternly told, \"We don't make extra blini outside of a whole order.\" OK. So then the main course came, steak with chimichurri sauce and grilled vegetables. The grilled vegetables were ice cold, as if they'd been charred earlier then refrigerated. The steak itself, which we ordered medium rare, was cut into jagged chunks with raw, cold, purplish centers. We sent back the main courses and asked for more wine, which the sweet (but slightly befuddled) waitress brought and didn't charge us for the steak.

It was the start of happy hour, but had no plans of staying for food / dinner. \n\nSo, we met originally for a few beers and sat at the corner of the bar and after chatting with one of the Chefs, Erick, we decided to order food. We got an assortment of different items including the Brussels Sprouts (my ultimate favorite), Crispy Fried Chicken Bits and the gnocchi. All of which were so so delicious.\n\nIt was my first time to the restaurant and definitely won't be my last when visiting SF in the future. The staff was so friendly and the service was up to par! If you're looking for a fun restaurant, delicious food, cool atmosphere and great people to chat with -- Aliment is the place to go!\n\nComing from New York -- the city of delicious restaurants on every corner -- I must say, this blows a lot of the places I've tried in NY out of the water. I am so happy we stopped in and even happier we ended up ordering food.", "author": "Heather S."}

Checked into the Mark Hopkin after a long day of traveling.  Found this restaurant was about two blocks away and decided to check it out. \n\nNice little restaurant.  Seems like it would be a nice date spot.  I sat at the bar. \n\nWhat I had:  A few beers, Brussel Sprouts, and the Arctic Char. \n\nThe beer selection is somewhat limited.  The restaurant seems to be a bit more versed in wine. \n\nBrussel sprouts were very good.  A bit of a different take then the usual (fish sauce added).  I do have to say the taste of the fish sauce was a bit overpowering but I still enjoyed the dish.  The brussel sprouts were cooked just right, not too mushy but not too firm. \n\nThe Arctic Char was very good but a bit pricey (but it is San Francisco).  Had a lot of different elements going on and they were all quite delicious (pork belly and sweet potato hash.

If you like New American cuisine, Aliment fulfills the entire checklist - high ceilings with balcony second floor seating, unusual flavor combinations, wooden tables, unconventional lighting structures, and waiters wearing berets and golden reptile skin shoes. They were also projecting Armageddon on one of the walls in place of wall decor (We sat right under the screen, and my friend summed up our experience pretty well: \"Armageddon is great, but I don't want to feel like I'm being shot at during my meal.\"). I had high hopes that I had discovered the new gem of New American chic in San Francisco, but the food left me with mixed feelings.\n\n- Fried Brussels Sprouts ($9): Aliment seems to be Asian-inspired to an extent. Covered in a fish sauce caramel reduction, these sprouts are probably some of the best I've ever had. The sweet and savory, Asian and American combination is unexpected and you'll find yourself rolling the sprouts around in the sauce because you just can't get enough of it.\n\n- Flatbread ($12): The dinner special was a burrata, kale, and tomato flatbread. Burrata is always great, no argument there.\n\n- Seared diver scallops ($17): I ordered this as an entree, but it can be shared as an appetizer. Three large scallops lie on a thin bed of black rice, thai green curry, and pickled shallots. The scallops are topped with a very unexpectedly spicy seasoning, and there is little relief to be found in the actual scallop meat and rice. There was a lot of different flavors clashing in the plate, and none of them seemed to mesh together peacefully.\n\n- Flourless Chocolate Cake ($9): Flourless cakes are usually an unsavory affair for me, but I really enjoyed how light this one tasted. It was topped with cream and caramel sauce.\n\nI enjoyed my friend's dinner special linguini with shrimp and lobster ($18) much more than my scallops, but I wouldn't say it was entirely unique. My other friend described her Roasted Chicken Breast ($20) as \"fancy KFC\" - perhaps a little harsh, but it was nothing too special either. I came with two friends on a Saturday night and there was no wait.\n\nMaybe the lack of impressive entrees that night unfairly marred our judgment of Aliment. But if nothing else excites you here, at least get the brussels sprouts!", "author": "Jessica F."}

The Brussels (not \"brussel\") sprouts are too salty from being drowned in sauce, and the kale salad is too heavy on the dressing. It's really too bad because I live only a block away and was wishing for Aliment to live up to the standards that Sons & Daughters and Sweet Woodruff have set. I was also let down by their 2013 New Year's Eve offering: a flier on their window promised complimentary (not \"complementary\") appetizers and a champagne toast at midnight. But after getting clarification from our waiter at about 10pm that night, the plan was to give out hors d'oeuvres after the kitchen closed. Oh, well. I guess I'll try to make it to a happy hour (weekdays from 5-6pm) to try the other appetizers for 50% off.\n\nRandom side note: not sure why, but the restroom doesn't offer toilet seat covers despite the fact that there's only one toilet for all guests of both genders. At least it seemed relatively clean.\n\nThe verdict: eh, it's okay, but not mind blowing. I'll go again just because it's in the neighborhood.", "author": "Tiff T."}

I like many others had passed this place several times before deciding to make a reservation. I ate there this past weekend and overall it was a great experience. \n\nWhen you come in it is very crowded and loud like you would expect from most downtown SF locations similar to Jaspers or Fly Bar. It is dark and there is loud ambiance music blaring out downstairs. It was really busy on Saturday night so i would recommend making a reservation to ensure good seating. \n\nWe were able to eat up stairs and it was much quieter and more romantic up there. Its a great place for couples and has an upscale vibe. The staff is very nice and knowledgeable as well. \n\nThe food was very good, Aliment is an odd mix of american food that I couldn't figure out but it was unique which with all the other eating options downtown you probably need. My date enjoyed the brussels sprouts and the spaekle and kale were amazing dishes. I really just wanted to try a bunch of things so we ordered about 4 dishes including the cobbler dessert which was wonderful. I recommend actually saving room for dessert here. \n\nI didn't try any of the entrees so I might need to go back and check those out.

Knew if it was half as good as Sweet Woodruff I would eat there 2-3 times a week.\n\nFirst time I went, between my friend and I we got two apps and two entrees.  Of the four plates, one was off the hook, one was very good, and the other two were very average and overpriced.  Figured it was new and that was to be expected and that they would hit their stride in time.\n\nSecond time, wanted to have some wine.  After seeing what passes there for a list I decided to bring my own.  An '07 Brewer Clifton Mt Carmel, something that I'll happily pay a corkage fee for and everyone wins.  \n\nBut $40?!?!?!  That's rapacious.  I mean, I get it it if it's Michael Minna, or Alexander's, or Fleur de Lys.  Not that I even know what those places charge, but I would understand if you had an extensive list like an elite place (Minna), the traditional list of a top end steakhouse (Alexander's), or an unusually well developed wine list (Fleur).  If a place like that chose to discourage people from bringing their own, or simply had a high price to match the high price of everything else there, I would understand.  But Aliment's \"list\" has a TOTAL OF SEVEN WINES!!!!   And its not like they are amazing unknown under priced gems of each varietal.\n\nTo his credit, the server appeared horrified and apologized profusely when he told me the rate.  When I replied with, \"wow\".  He rolled his eyes and said, \"yeah, we're all really upset about it, but the owner won't budge.  He doesn't want people bringing their own wine\".  He later came over and pointed to the owner and asked if I would go say something about the corkage. \n\nAs a matter of principal, I enjoyed my wine.  And as a matter of principal, I won't be back.\n\nOne thing about this place that is obvious (and this comes through in other reviews) is that the place is a little disjointed.  It really doesn't know what it is trying to be.  Is it a neighborhood place, like a more formal version of Sweet Woodruff?  Or is it an upscale destination, like a more casual version of Sons & Daughters?  With a few tweaks, it could be amazing as the former.

It had some hearty mushrooms, a nice light dressing, and a poached egg on top - overall a nice combo. The chicken, however, wasn't as exciting. It was on the bone, with the skin, so it was fairly tender and moist, but there wasn't much flavor at all. The corn side that came with it was probably the best part...there was also a sauce that came with the dish that wasn't very good at all...didn't compliment any of the parts of the dish.\n\nMildly disappointed in my selection for dinner, but I at least got to enjoy a few hours with some friends in a nice setting. Next time I'll do a little more research ahead of time!", "author": "Sam S."}

Well, the wait is finally over, and I'm underwhelmed. aliment was a very strange restaurant. The short version: okay soul food, not vegetarian friendly, good Italian wine list, great service. Somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars. I've only been here once, and I suppose if I go back again I'll update this review.\n\nI went here on Sunday with my girlfriend, who has strong vegetarian leanings. There's no menu outside, and no website, and generally little information available, so we treated it as an adventure. We got in and were seated by our waitress, who was very nice and very responsive. We got the menus and were a little distraught to see that not only was there only a single vegetarian option on the whole menu, but there were only two items on the menu that seemed to include vegetables at all! Thankfully, the wine list (on the reverse of the menu) is substantially longer than the actual food list. She got an imported Vermintino and I got a Sonoma Zinfandel; both were quite good, although since we hadn't actually picked food yet, they weren't particularly effective pairings.\n\nAppetizer choices on Sunday were fried brussels sprouts in a fish sauce, french fries, or sp\u00e4tzle. We got the sp\u00e4tzle, but the kitchen got behind, so they gave us comp french fries for an appetizer and then the sp\u00e4tzle showed up with our main courses. Both were just okay; the fries were thick-cut but not particularly seasoned, and the spatzle tasted like macaroni and cheese with the smallest amount of what might've been fried onions.\n\nFor the main courses, my girlfriend got the potato gnocchi (the only vegetarian option on the menu), and I got the fried chicken. The chicken was pretty good, fried with a sweet barbecue sauce of some kind and all white meat (two breasts and a drumstick), but it was just fried chicken sitting on two rather sad-looking romaine lettuce hearts. No attempt at a side. I'm told that the gnocchi was okay. It came with peas and what I think were lentils.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, although somewhat odd paired with the food. Quiet with very modern decor. In general, I think it was that mismatch that bothered me all around -- upscale new american decor, wine list, and design, paired with food that really wanted to be eaten by hands instead of forks.\n\nPrice was... surprisingly high for what we got. $70 before tip for two people with one glass of wine each and no dessert.\n\nIf aliment expands their menu a bit to have some things that feel at least slightly healthy, becomes a little more inclusive to vegetarians, and actually gets some information out there, maybe I'll go back again. And maybe it'll even be a good addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "James B."}

Like most pork belly, all layers must be eaten together, at the same time, within the same bite. \nAs soon as i placed the first bite in my mouth, the fat disappeared in an instant leaving me with the question as to whether it was really there at all. \nWhat i guess i'm trying to say is... order it. \n\n\nI am very particular about my brussel sprouts. Extremely. \nBut i must say the Brussels were done well. Not soggy or overdone on the inside. There was a slight bite to it- and the flakes and seaweed added additional texture that varied the dish. It was a bit too sweet for me, i had to scrape most of them to the side, wait for the sauce to drain and then eat them. We still finished every morsel. haha. \n\nThe scallops were good, but not impressive. In fact, not impressive enough for me to write more about them. They were good though. \n\nThe steak. \nHoly smokes. By the time we finished the above three starters this was the perfect finish. I'm an edge-of-the-steak person and i must admit it was perfectly charred and seasoned... oh gosh. No words. No words. \n\nThe space itself is very well designed. The kitchen takes up about half of the restaurant which shows to me that they prioritize their food. The lady chef in the back was doing her thing and every 5 minutes i just wanted to shout, \" you go girl! You go girl!\" but alas, the ambiance did not allow for that type of behavior. \n\nI shall be coming again- as I feel it was worth the price in exchange for the amount of satisfaction my belly experienced upon our departure.

I conceptualized the dish in my head totally different than what it actually was, so I was disappointed by default (I imagined a beef short rib wrapped in pastrami...) The short rib was made of pastrami, and coated in an aggressive peppercorn rub. With no sauce on the plate to balance it out, I found the flavor to be too overpowering.\n\nMy boyfriend had the steak.

It's still rather for restaurants to capture that modern feel in in nob hill/downtown area where a lot of restaurants are out of date. Glad to see poping up of places like Aliment and hopefully more to come. \n\nDishes: \n\n1. Brussels Sprouts- Beautifully done. We weren't usually fans of the brussels sprout as it has a distinct smell/taste to it that we aren't usually a fan of.  In their case, the chef beautiful use a thick asian inspired sauce/ top with seaweed to blend in with the brussel sprouts and this beautifully balance the taste of it. The sprouts were boiled aptly prior to caramelized without being overcooked. \n\n2. Bolognese Sauce with papadelle: this is a dish we make all the time at home. I like the aliment version.  They kept it traditional without much alteration. Only thing I noticed is that they put a lot of pepper. This made it a bit firery and I would take that down if it's up to me.  The water was obviously added to the sauce (this is necessary to ensure continue cooking without drying up.  In the portion we got served, I felt the water was added not too long before it was served, therefore making it a bit too saucy.. I would say it should cook up for another 30 mins before been served after just adding water. Pretty good otherwise. \n\n3. Pork Chop: Pork chop was beautifully done. It's cooked to medium with all the juice perfectly kept in the chop while surface nicely seared. Not much taste to the inside, as the point is probably the freshness of the chop. Judging from the texture point of view, I said it was a dish that demonstrate solid skill.  And the potatoes were also perfectly baked with moisture inside and crispy outside. \n\nWill totally come back more before the crowd finds it and make it another place with long waits.", "author": "Fung S.

Polite, unobtrusive service. \n\nIt's been open about a year now, and I am happy to have it as a go-to spot in the neighborhood.", "author": "Heidi U."}

Thank goodness the seating at the chef's counter is comfortable, something you find at so few places.  Service was pleasant, efficient, and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nChopped kale salad was nice enough having as its base quite fresh kale.  However, it was a bit plain and some citrus, perhaps tangerine segments, would have livened it.\n\nFried brussels sprouts with a sweetish fish sauce needed nothing but my appetite.  This was a wonderful and well-portioned appetizer just made for sharing.  \n\nBraised short rib with broccoli di ciccio was just OK.  The short ribs were tender and not too fatty but were also lacking something.  Some sort of sauce or reduction would have made this plate much more interesting.", "author": "David D."}

The service was ambivalent (our waitress seemed put off by questions about the food and indifferent when asked for recommendations) and the food was overpriced and not very tasty.\n\nBrussels Sprouts: I'm a huge fan of brussels sprouts, so I order them whenever they're on the menu.  These were pretty tasty, but I found them to be too oily and cloyingly sweet as you got to the bottom.  \n\nScallops: the scallops themselves were perfectly cooked and very yummy.  Best thing we got there.  Unfortunately, the rice they were served with was undercooked and the sauce had an odd flavor that only detracted from the dish.\n\nPork Chop: slightly dry (yet somehow, there was a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate) and not very flavorful.  A wholly forgettable dish.\n\nBolognese: If you're going to put a simple dish like bolognese on the menu, it should be really outstanding.  This one simply wasn't.  My friend left more than half of it uneaten because she, in her words, \"wanted to same room for some tasty SF food\".  Ouch.\n\nFish special: The serving was tiny (a small triangular chunk about 1.5\" on each side) and while it didn't taste bad, it didn't taste good enough to warrant the $30+ price tag, either. \n\nGiven the prices Aliment charges and how competitive the SF restaurant market is, the food and the service have got to be much better than they are.

I'm docking a star because dessert was disappointing, we ordered the chocolate cake which came with a little mini pitcher of creme fraiche to pour over it, and was topped with whipped cream I think.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-03", "description": "The one con that I still struggle with living in Nob Hill is the lack of good restaurants in my area. It's either chain restaurants or kitschy SF tourist traps that charge too much. I've got my hole-in-the-wall favorites that are always good for takeout (Sushi Toni tops that list!) but the closest decent restaurant is probably the Nob Hill Caf\u00e9. I found my neighborhood bar (Tunnel Top, a must visit for any SF resident) but I've been yearning for a good place to have a glass of wine and enjoy some quality food. \n\nWell, finally I have found such a place! Ailment, a new American/California restaurant just opened on Bush between Mason and Powell. The 49-seat restaurant feels small but open. Giant windows that slide open face the street and there's bar seating along it for those who like to people watch. Every day I walk by there's little vases filled with fresh flowers sitting out on it. The rest of the interior is minimalist outside of the wine wall behind the bar. \n\nWe sat by the window and checked out the wine list. They featured a good selection of local and world wines. I just read that the managing partner comes from Nob Hill Grille and shares the chef duties with a guy coming from Blue Plate. This makes sense as the food is classic California, simple and seasonal. We started by tasting the Churchpoint oysters, which were topped with fresno chile vinegar and fennel. It had a spicy after-kick that really livened up a standard oyster. I then continued my kale obsession with their chopped kale salad, diced with toasted pepitas (squash seed), radish and pecorino. The dressing was a thick avocado and anchovy dressing, which didn't taste fishy at all. We also split the fried brussel sprouts, which were crispy but a little on the greasy side (they'd be perfect if strained a tad bit more). The sauce they're served in tasted like a mix of soy and something a little sweet/syrupy, which combined made a delicious tangy combo. Just in case we were getting a little too healthy, we also got an order of the French fries, which were standard but served with a garlic chive ranch. I'd recommend also requesting ketchup as they make their own smoky ketchup in-house that I really enjoyed and I usually hate ketchup. We stopped after appetizers and wine but their entrees were in the same genre (think hanger steak, diver scallops, fried chicken and braised short rib). \n\nThis place offers a little something for everyone. I'd be fine dining there solo, with friends or on a date. They're also open for brunch so I'll be checking that out next!", "author": "Larisa J."}

I arrived at the restaurant at 5:25 pm, which was apparently 5 minutes sooner than their opening time (and their door was unlocked too btw so I walked in).  The beautiful waitresses were apparently very rude in such an upscale restaurant. They told my friend and I \"oh we're not actually open yet\" with a dismissive manner. As soon as we walked out the door, the locked the door. Then, we had to wait outside and when they opened the door, I told her that we wanted to cancel our reservation (because OpenTable won't let me cancel using the app since the reservation time has passed). She didn't bother to ask why nor to apologize. This is a disappointment despite the class of this restaurant and the yelp reviews it has got. Horrible, horrible service. I'm sorry to say, but pretty face with horrible attitude shouldn't be in customer service. Very disappointed.", "author": "Wesley F."}

I truly want to believe the waiter made a mistake and didn't realize it, but the whole thing got weird and embarrassing. We were a party of four and asked the waiter (a super charming guy btw) to put the 2 bottles of wine in a different bill. We paid that bill with cash and then the food bill with cards. But he disappeared with the cash and said we had paid only one third of the wine bill. It was surreal. To get things worse, my friend was pregnant and not feeling well bc of the food (avoid the fried chicken!). Then two tattoo guys in a near table tried to get involved, aggressively (!!), and he didn't do anything. We were not angry or screaming or making a scene, we were just trying to figure out the absurdity. At the end, we just paid again and left. I would never go back or recommend this place. Who treats customers like that?? It was really embarrassing...", "author": "fer e."}

We were told, at 1 PM that there was only 1 left.  We could imagine running out of daily specials, but burgers???  To make it worse, the three faced off in a burger quest.  Th two losers ordered chicken and french toast.  The waiter soon came back and said that even the one was gone.  He got hash.  3)  One of our party liked the continental breakfast as described, except for granola as she is allergic to nuts.   \"Please give me a small salad rather than the granola,\" she said.  \"Sorry, no substituting,\" said the waiter.  She ended up with the breakfast without granola or salad. 4)It took forever to get  served\n\nGood:  The food that arrived was very good. ) I had the so-called Thai Fried Chicken - there was nothing even faintly Thai about it, but it was otherwise just right.  2) Two had the short rib hash.  There was nothing hashy about it - just large chunks of good meat, some potatoes and an egg .  The dish tasted good, but between this and the chicken, there's a problem with names.  3) My wife had the french toast - excellent.  4) My brother had the pisole and eggs - good, not great.  4)Sis in law, with nut allergy, liked her continental breakfast but longed for a small salad.\n\nI'm not sure I'd go back, at least not for brunch.

Steak, Arctic char, gnocchi, Brussel sprouts were all very good.  I would give the hostess and waitress no stars. No welcome when we come in. No personality. The place was empty and they could care less if we came. A Restuarant should be welcoming when you arrive and engage the customer. They were \"too cool\" to serve. Disappointed in the experience,", "author": "V D."}

My wife had the Bolognese and said it was among the best she's eaten, which includes versions in Italy. I ordered Gnocchi which was outstanding - small portion, but probably a good thing given the richness of the dish. We shared a salad and appetizer, both specials for the evening and both delicious. The only reason we gave four stars instead of five is due to their lack of iced tea. I was fine - had a glass of wine, but my wife was surprised iced tea was not an option.", "author": "Eric F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "Great space and vibe. Our server, however, was not great. Four of us ordered drinks, and she only brought three to the table, walked away, and it took another 10 minutes to get her attention to remind her of the fourth. After telling us the specials, she sniffed that \"that's all I have to say about the food.\" It was clearly a bother to her that we were there to dine. Mussels and duck were excellent, but pork riblets were over-cooked and dry as a bone. One of the shared dishes we ordered never arrived. Donut and ice cream were worth the extra calories, though ice cream is a little icy if you prefer it on the creamier side. Server then proceeded to rush us out the door - we got more attention from her after she dropped the check than anytime during the meal. I'd potentially go again and give a 2nd chance, but they need serious improvements in their service and there are too many other great options in the city.", "author": "Lynn B."}

However, on the sheer basis of the food I tried, it was not very impressive.  Came here for brunch and tried the short rib hash and a soupy pork dish.  While the hash was okay, the pork dish was spicy and lacked flavor otherwise.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.", "author": "Josh Q."}

Dining with my friends last night (two meat eaters and two vegetarians) we were impressed by the menu and didn't think twice about ordering the kale salad substituting the anchovy dressing for balsalmic vinegar and oil.  But wait... the server said no substitutions!  What?  Seriously?  \"The chef rules with an iron fist and does not make substitutions\"  said the server.  Its not like we were asking him to reinvent the wheel here, but alas, no dice.  We dared ask the server if the Brussels sprouts could be made without Bacon - GASP!  No, no dice either.  So, my vegetarian friend and I choked through the spaetzel and cappelini dishes and were overwhelming disappointed that the chef could be so arrogant as not to make a slight change for our dining pleasure.

The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing, the service is friendly and on-point, and the food is delicious!  The fried brussel sprouts are something to write home about.  The scallops...the best we've had in quite some time.  We've tried a few of the meat entrees and they've been hearty and super flavorful. Oh --- and the wine list is something to talk about.

Walked in on a Saturday night without reservations.  We got a table for two upstairs. That was nice but the place was packed downstairs and the noise coming up was quite loud. The service was good.  My husband and I both had the kale salad which was delicious.  I'm not a big kale salad person but the kale was sliced so thin and delicious - I would order it again. I had the 'farrotto'root veggies with porcini cream. It was so good and so filling I couldn't finish it. It also had a little arugula salad topping which was a nice adjunct. My husband had the pork chops and couldn't say enough good about them and the eggplant side dish,  there something in the eggplant that looks like potatoes but it's really a rice dumpling like thing -he loved it so had to ask what it was. He didn't say anything about his food being too salty (after reading the other reviews) and he doesn't like overly salty foods -  so I don't think that's an issue. We would definitely return !", "author": "Karen C."}

I am so glad she did because the experience was phenomenal from the moment we walked in the door.  It started with a warm smiling face greeting us the moment we stepped in and they were busy so I was expecting to wait to be noticed!!   We decided to eat at the counter so we could watch the chefs work, I love doing that for multiple reasons but primarily for two reasons I am a graduate of culinary school so I like to critique them but I also like to watch to learn new techniques from people.  Again, I am so glad we did, the chef was a blonde woman, her name was Chelsea, yes she spoke with us, briefly, and she was awesome!!!  the way she moved around that kitchen it was like it was an extension of her own body, it was shear art watching her do her thing.  Then end result was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  I had the bolognese which was seasoned and cooked to perfection and my friend had the short ribs... I tried the short ribs and they were flavorful and fall of the bone tender.  If I wasn't so stuffed from the pasta I would have ordered them as well!!    My favorite dish would have to be the Brussel sprouts with caramelized fish sauce!!  yep... you heard me.. Caramelized fish sauce.. never heard of such a thing??? me either.. but it is truly amazing and brought those little cabbages up from oh hum to KA BAM!!!  Seriously YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE!!  The atmosphere was cozy and classy not to noisy and everyone looked happy and enjoying their meal.  In fact everyone looked so happy that if you took a step back and looked from the outside it would appear that you were peering into the kitchen of someones home while they were having a big family dinner. All in all you can go here for a special occasion or a week day treat or just because you want good food and a very good price and it will be well worth your time!!!  Just GO GO GGOOO!!!", "author": "M. Allan P."}
