The presence of some regional dishes (particularly banh mi bo kho) drew me in. \n\nThere were local tech heads nitpicking about the type of milk in their Vietnamese coffee, a man and his very young niece/granddaughter who were sharing the beef balls from a bathtub size bowl of pho, and a girl who wanted nothing to do with meat - \"vegetables only\" she requested. An entertaining crowd. \n\nMy banh mi bo kho was delicious: big fatty chunks of fall-apart beef in a thick broth with onions and chunks of stewed carrot. There was a suspension of fresh cut herbs and other vegetables in the stew to make the mix pop. The meat was long stewed, but the finishing touches were fresh. The banh mi was too soft to my preference: it had none of the crack that you get in Vietnam with a good baguette. \n\nCoffee was oh so dark and rich. The condensed milk was a treat at the last sip. \n\nDefinitely worth a revisit. Group suitable.", "author": "Richard L."}

I fired up my trusty Yelp app and typed in \"pho.\"  Yelp led me straight to Pho Tan Hoa.  After a few minutes of dodging the crack addicts in the area, I found a parking spot a block away.  \n\nWalking inside I was immediately seated at a community table next to a homeless man who wouldn't stop talking to me for about 10 minutes. (After which time he realized I was ignoring him and he walked away).  I ordered the special combination, chicken  pho, and spring rolls.  The service was friendly enough (about as I would expect for this type of restaurant).  \n\n#7 (special combination large):  The bowl was huge!  I don't think one person could finish the entire bowl.  It was full of all the different types of meat, tendons, and tripe.  The side plate of bean sprouts and thai basil was a nice addition to the soup.  The broth was flavorful and not too salty.  I would say that it was a solid bowl of pho, but I've had better.  4/5\n\nThe chicken pho was was also pretty good.  (Not amazing).  A generous amount of chicken and noodles.  3.5/5\n\nThe spring rolls were fresh with a generous amount of meat and shrimp.  The peanut sauce was not my favorite.  3/5\n\nTotal with tax and tip was $37 (for two people).  There was probably enough food for 4 people.  Overall a decent value and above average pho.  I would go back if I was in the area and had a craving for pho!  Oh, and my car didn't get broken into while I was eating so that's good!", "author": "Paul W."}

The medium definitely filled me up, but I would've been content with a small. My friend ordered a large, and when we first saw it (with our hungry bellies), we didn't think it was as massive as other Yelpers described it, but when I looked at the bowl with my full belly, the bowl definitely looked much bigger.

It's often times a little on the oily and spicy side depending on where you go. It wasn't as sweet as I normally would like, but it was full of flavor and they did not skimp on the meat or noodles.\n\nAt first I was a little shocked and disappointed at how expensive everything was, but after BARELY finishing a large and considering how good everything was, it was understandable.

I can cook it later The lady disagreed and said \"the chef here cooks noodle better than you\". But she DIDN'T UNDERSTAND that the noodle will get sticky after 6hrs. My mom didn't want to agrue with her and let she did what she wanted. Sadly, I couldn't eat it and their noodle was thrown in the trash that night.\n        2. Today, my mom again ordered the same dry noodle with uncooked noodle. I was going to eat it ealier last time. This time, the lady listened to my mom. I was so happy. HOWEVER, they FORGOT to give the small togo container of soy sauce. My mom came back right away to tell them. The lady, waiter and chefs said to my mom \"We already put it in the bag. If you want to ask more, then say want more, don't blame us\" WTF!!! Their talking way was SO RUDE to my mom. My mom said \"If I need more soy sauce, I have it at home and DON'T NEED to come back to WASTE my time. Your soy sauce must be better than mine, bcuz it's FOR dry noodle and I just want to let you guys know that you guys forgot to give me\". They kept BLAMING my mom and looked at her like alien. OMG!

It's a no-frills, authentic pho joint; the owner is quick, terse, the food is good, the service is bare-bones. Just the way a pho joint should be; I'm very skeptical of all these \"high-end\" pho places ripping people off in SF for $15 a bowl just because the servers come around more often to refill your water.\n\nMy favorites from this place include the Pho Tai (rare steak pho; order your steak rare on the side, marinate it in lemon juice, and cook it yourself in a side bowl of broth), the Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup), Pho Ga (chicken pho) and the Bo Kho (beef stew). The Bo Kho is some of the best I've tasted anywhere (including San Jose, which is famous for its numerous pho joints). Copious amounts of meat and noodles for about $10; in fact, when I order, I usually request less meat because they give you so much.\n\nVietnamese coffee (ca phe sua de) and the coconut juice (with fresh coconut meat) is also excellent.

At the end, he never delivers the check or acknowledges us when we try to ask for it. \n\nThe last, and final, time I ate here he decided to clean, dry, and replace all ceramic cutlery at the table directly next to us. This went on for 20 minutes while we ate without an apology or an explanation.

The broth was probably one of the best I've had. So flavorful. The hubs had the seafood pho which had a different lighter broth that was also very good. Both came with rice noodles. I saw a large bowl of pho and I'd say that's too big but if you're hungry why not. \n\nAs mentioned by others, cash only. Service was good and efficient.

I grew up coming here for their beef stew and bread. Surprisingly, it was just as good as I remember although the meat was a bit tougher than usual.. It was a combination of beef and tendons. The sauce was delicious, but would be better if it was less oily. We ordered a bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup), a number 7 large beef noodle soup, beef stew and bread, and a lemon soda. The bill came out around $36 which was expected. The beef noodle soup was okay.. It wasn't concentrated enough with flavor and I've definitely has better at other locations. But, the portion was pretty good for a large. The bun bo hue was pretty good, but again I've had better.  It wasn't beefy enough but had a good spicy kick to it. There was a pretty strong shrimp taste to it, which I think others would mind.

I went to pronouncing Pho \"Foe\" to speaking fluent Vietnamese solely via osmosis after spending hours and hours in Pho joints. The Pho was cheap, delicious, and consistent. This is a Pho/Chinese restaurant, which seems weird to me. A similar comparison would be having a joint German/Italian restaurant. I get they are on the same continent but... why? \n\nAt Pho Tan Hoa, I'd put the Pho in the so-so range. The noodles and broth were quite good. They had the salt/fat ratio down perfectly, and the broth had some time to soak into the noodles giving them some of the flavor. I was surprised they didn't have an extra noodle option on the menu, it's worth asking for them as they are the best part of the Pho. \n\nMy main beef was with the brisket. Frankly, they used a really poor cut that had a lot of connective tissue and not nearly as much meat as I'd expect.

There wasn't much herbs and sprouts to go in it (I'm used to getting a *lot* more), but what there was were good.  The broth was very tasty and strong, which I like.  Some places seem to have watery broth, but not here.  The meat was pretty good, though not great.  Note that they only take cash, but they have a large sign on the door for that, so you can't be surprised once inside.  Paying my check was also very fast.  The staff are very friendly, though there was some difficulty communicating.  I was the only Anglo in there, so maybe they don't have a lot of need for English.

Here are my observations:\n\n1)  Plentiful servings.  I got the special beef pho to go which only comes in a large size.  I was given a huge chinese container of noodles and meat, a glad lock bag of bean sprouts and leaves, and a large plastic container of broth.  I could only eat about 1/3rd of the pho before being stuffed.  \n2)  Too much meat.  The noodles (which were cooked just right) and broth (which was clean and tasty) were probably the best part of the soup and was overpowered by meat.  I mean, I usually LOVE meat but was sick of it by the time I was done eating.  Also, the special beef pho had a lot of meat parts that I can usually only eat in small quantities (such as tripe) and having such large quantities of it became a bit sickening.  I now stick to the raw beef pho which is smaller in size (although still more than enough for me!) and consists of \"less scary\" cuts of meat.  If I had a kitchen (which I don't, I'm currently living in a hotel room while my house is being repaired), I would only use what I need into the soup and satay the rest of the meat in another dish for later.\n3)  Love the beans/jelly in coconut milk.

I ordered the $7.00 beef combo pho (#2), which comes with slices of rare flank steak and some side of a cow I have never seen. It was good, hearty stuff, and the combination of the fresh sprouts in the broth made for a pretty tasty combination.

Although I enjoyed my bowl of pho, it doesn't deserves a 30-40% price premium and my risk for personal safety.     \n\nIf you are a hardcore pho fanatic, I would recommend checking this place out but please keep your expectations in check.", "author": "Fei L."}

After finding their favorable rating on Yelp, I decided to swing by to see if they could rival Them Ky which was only a few blocks away. The interior was a whole in the wall with little d\u00e9cor and ambiance except for the sticky tables, colorful fish tank, and the few people who were sporadically seated here and there. The servers seemed to be on their breaks so the vibe was casual and relaxed. \n\nI was super hungry and decided to order their biggest bowl of pho which was filled with rare steak, well done flank, tendon and tripe ($9.70). The broth arrived piping hot with slices of beef steak appeared rare red with plenty of thick flank and impressive amount of juicy slippery tendon. I wished there could be more tripe but the massive amount of tendon was quite a welcoming sight. The broth had a good hint of fish sauce with bone marrow nicely intertwined, but the taste of star anise and other essential seasoning were critically held in check. The robust, deepening, and aromatic elements in the broth were slightly better than Pho 2000 but not as stellar as Them Ky. The super high temperature in my bowl rendered swarms of overcooked noodles, and the side plate of complementary basil leaves, sprouts and jalapenos were pretty standard. I was a sweaty happy camper after adding quick mix of siracha, hoisin, and a squeeze of sour lemon to the steamy Titantic.\n\nI also ordered a glass of Che Thap Cam ($2.25) which came with large red beans, jelly, and colored water chestnuts steeped in coconut milk. The drink was refreshing and gave me a nice sweet contrast to my bowl of spicy pho. Service was not the most attentive but my objective of getting my pho fix was met. Quality wise, the price was very high with soup not as flavorful as Them Ky but the thick fat slices of tendon was memorable. Overall, it is still a decent place for pho and one that I wouldn't mind going back to. 3 full stars for the experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I passed two bums who had each other in a gridlock with one yelling, \"Give me back my $8!\" I will spare you the graphical details of their facial wounds.\n\nTurned the corner into Jones Street, and everywhere you looked, there were individuals with questionable hygienes -- presumably all homeless or poor. I was expecting to be asked for cash at every step, but was ignored. Oddly enough, I had been passed all week when other pedestrians were begged for cash. Must have been the way I dressed, looked, or walked... *shrug* My point is, the street can give some anxiety to out-of-towners.\n\nOnce I reached the restaurant, I was immediately greeted by a man, and a woman behind the cash register smiled. There were 5 Vietnamese and 2 Hispanic guests, and plenty of available seats.\n\nI had read the Yelp reviews and was aware of the portion sizes. So, I ordered a Special Combo pho (Dac Biet), medium size. The man asked whether I wanted large instead. No, thank you. Just medium. Extra meat on the side too please.\n\nSure enough, the portions were large. I'm glad that I did not order the Large pho.\n\nService was fast, and the food came out quickly as well.\n\nWhile eating, I overheard them speak Vietnamese, Cantonese, and English.

I decided to brave the TL and head over to this pho joint on Jones.\n\n\nTHE PROS:\n-I really appreciate the efficient service and MAN, the pho came out lightning quick!\n-The restaurant itself is super clean and while we were there, the gentleman was cleaning the whole time inbetween taking/serving orders\n-The pho itself was pretty decent, the noodle texture was nice and not overly soft (which i think restaurants tend to do).\n- I always order my meat on the side so that the meat doesn't turn chewy and over cooked.  The server gave us an extra small bowl of broth to cook the meat in!  BRAVO!\n-They have suong sa hot luu (Tapioca and sweet beans in coconut milk)  It's a dying drink in the Vietnamese restaurant world, so I tend to order it whenever I see it!\n\nTHE CONS:\n-Nearly $10 for a bowl of pho is a bit on the pricey side, especially if it's not out of this world extraordinary.\n-Having to play Frogger with the local people who don't seem to care or not that they're about to collide into you walking in the TL\n-Here's a subjective one, but I don't like Pho broth that's too 'clean'.  What I mean is that a home cooked pho broth has a smorgasbord of flavors.  The beef, the onions, the star anise etc.   This broth was very tame and lacked the umph a good broth has.  Don't get me wrong, if you like a nice clean/mild broth then this is your place.  It's just not my cup of broth...tea...you know i mean.\n\nAll in all, a decent pho joint in the City.

First order of business: pho. While it felt a little weird to have pho that early in the morning, really, there's no bad time for pho. \n\nThanks to the powers of Yelp, we discovered that Pho Tan Hoa opened at 8am. We parked right out front and were pleased to find that we actually weren't the only ones in there. \n\nThe manager/owner/head honcho helped us right away, and I was really impressed by his ability to recite the full dish name when we gave him the menu number. #42? \"Chicken soup with egg noodle!\" Why yes, that's what I want!\n\nOur dishes came in about five minutes and was tasty, hot and brothy.

My friend (who was visiting) and I were taking a cab back from Golden Gate Park, and when we asked the Vietnamese cabbie to take us to Pho 2000, he redirected us to Pho Tan Hoa.  \"Get the meat on the side,\" he said.\n\nThat was a great day; I've been to Pho Tan Hoa almost once a week ever since.  If I lived closer or they didn't have crazy close-at-somewhere-around-5pm-and-for-some-reason-closed-on-Thursdays hours, I'd be a lot fatter and have very sodium-rich blood.\n\nI order the exact same thing every time I'm there - #7 (\"big one,\" the owner will say) with the meat on the side, Vietnamese iced coffee, and a glass of water.  On a good day, I can finish it all.  And I'm usually the guy asking \"... you gonna finish that?\"\n\nThe pho comes out in like five minutes.  Perfect if you're in a rush.  Or trying to beat closing time.\n\nWhen my friend came to visit the next year, he specifically asked to return to Pho Tan Hoa.\n\nHere's my comparison list (I eat a lot of pho):\n- Pho 2000:  Broth has changed.  I think they watered it down and put more spices to cover it.\n- Turtle Tower:  I'm just not as big a fan of chicken pho, and I don't really go for the Northern style of pho.  I know in Vietnam that Northern cuisine is all the rage, but I like what I like!\n- Golden Star: This is what people consider the best in the city?  Not a lot of meat, and kinda bland.\n- Tin:  Authentically tiny bowl.  Lukewarm broth.  Not very much meat.  If you want good service though, it's probably the best out of the bunch ... but service doesn't add flavor!\n- Miss Saigon:  This place has become my second favorite place in the city.  The meat quality is pretty good, though I feel the broth is a bit overly salty, and I end up sweating buckets while I'm in there.  I think the ventilation needs work.\n- Ha Nam Ninh:  It's highly rated, but only because everyone goes for that one dry noodle dish.  It is quite good.  But when I went with a friend and ordered it, and he ordered pho, we ended up switching ... because I prefer pho.  I remember the pho being decent, but it taking forever for my food to arrive.\n- Hong Kee & Kim:  These guys cut on everything.  Tiny plate of bean sprouts, a mini-sprig of basil, a few slices of meat, and bland broth.  They can get away with charging $9 because it's in the Financial District.\n- Pho Express:  I thought this place was okay, probably the best you'll find in FiDi, though my equally-pho-loving friend didn't care for it.  Slightly overcooked noodles.\n- Happy Donut:  They have donut in the name.  What was I thinking.  Really bland broth.  Added a boatload of hoisin/Sriracha to compensate.  Also, soggy noodles.\n- Perilla:  They don't have pho.  They shouldn't even be on this list.  Also, what's the deal with $12 for garlic noodles with a smidgen of protein?  And everyone loves it??\n- Joy Hing:  I went here because I was on my way to Golden Star once and got lazy.  Also because I was on a \"let's try something new\" kick.  I regretted it fairly quickly.  REALLY salty broth.  And I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt.  (Not really.  Futurama reference.  But the broth is totally salty.)\n- Golden Lotus:  Not bad!  They're open later so if I want pho for dinner (always) and am willing to walk through the heart of the TL (not always), I'll come here.  Their portion is smaller and has less meat than Pho Tan Hoa, but otherwise good.\n- Four Seasons: Also pretty good pho, and open even later than Golden Lotus, but I'd go to Golden Lotus first if I could.\n- PPQ Noodle: A lighter broth (likely of the chicken variety than beef) but overall not bad if that's what you're into.  I do prefer a beefier broth though.\n- Kevin's Noodle House: Better than PPQ, so if I find myself in the Sunset again I'll probably go there.  Still not a deep color to the broth though.\n- Sai's Restaurant: Their pho isn't really their specialty (though it's perfectly serviceable), the curry soups are a nice change of pace from pho if you're looking for it though.\n- Urban Picnic:  Another place catered to the working lunch crowd.  That is, made with speed, not care, and the taste suffers as a result.\n- 77 Chinese & Hawaii BBQ:  FiDi quality pho.  no depth to the broth, overly-salted, slightly overcooked noodles, and $11 after tax.  Better than Hong Kee & Kim though; more meat and a regular sized portion of sprouts and basil.\n\nThere's my list.  Yeah, there are more places in the city.

I have probably been here at least 50 times. \n\nThe place is pretty big and you can always find a place to sit even during peak hours (lunch time). You may have to sit in the corner. They usually play Vietnamese music.\n\nWhen you enter, you most likely will be greeted by the owner who is a 40ish Vietnamese guy with an accent. He knows how to speak English, Canto, and also Viet. I don't know what other languages he know. He is also very patient. I  frequently go there with the grandma. She asks a lot of questions and talks to the owner way too much. She also thinks he speaks really good canto but I think most of the time he doesn't really understand her. She also wants hot water instead of hot tea and she wants a separate bowl. Since we've been here a lot, we don't even need to ask for the hot water or the separate bowl for my grandma anymore. They just bring it. \n\nYou can order regular and large. Never tried asking for x-large but they give a lot of food. They never skimp. The food also comes out super fast! You can probably be in and out within 30 minutes.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Either all the pho in this city is eluding me, or there are just not that many Vietnamese noodle soup offerings around.\n\nEither way, I feel deprived of only two culinary pleasures in this New York: Mexican food and Vietnamese food.\n\nNaturally, upon landing in San Francisco I immediately started craving pho and burritos.

It was definitely above average, evident in the snappiness in the rice noodles and the quality of the meats and tendon. The meatballs tasted homemade and had a nice texture. Not too hard and not too soft. The rare meat was tender and seemed to have a freshness not found in some of the Sacto pho haunts. The broth was comparable to the ones I've had in Sac. I think my biggest expectation for the broth to be magical, but alas, magic only happens when magic does.\n\nI believe the owner took our order. The service was whimsical, and he sang to us as described in other reviews. I had a hard time understanding him. The pho came out in record time. I was amazed. The owner is super cool because my bro left his sunglasses on the table and as we circled around the block to pick them up, he was standing outside waiting for us with the sunglasses.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-09", "description": "I needed some serious Pho, and we walked down to Pho Hoa to take care of that.  The Pho was very good and I'd eat it again but to be honest, I'm not sure that I want to deal with the walk to get there.  OK, I'm a tourist and maybe I'm just not used to the way things are, but walking for several blocks down streets that smell like piss just isn't the way I like to get in the mood for a meal.  And it's kind of a shame that they close at 7PM.  We walked in at about 6:45, placed our order and were then told that we should eat fast because they want to go home.  I usually inhale Pho and this night was no exception, but it was just a weird experience.  Probably not the best for visitors.\n\nSo to sum it up, the Pho was excellent.  Everything else detracted from the experience and turned an amazing bowl of soup into a night that was at best, one that I'd probably not repeat.  It averages out to an okay 3 stars.  My advice to anyone wanting to open another Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco: Put it somewhere that tourists will go.  Raise the prices at least 50 percent, serve beer and wine, and get to know the local hotel concierges.  If anyone thinks that it adds to the appeal of the restaurant to have your nostrils filled with stale urine or having to walk around the homeless to get there, believe me, I'd be willing to give that up.  In reality, I think it's just that inexpensive food from a culture which is relatively new to the melting pot shows up first where the rents are the most affordable.\n\nOkay, trust me on this, the world is ready for Pho in a setting which is more attractive to tourists, and tourists are willing to pay more to get it.  Dinner for the two of us was an incredible $20 with tax and tip.  As nice as that was, if this place moved down the street and charged us $40 or $50 for the same thing, that would have been okay too,  From reading the comments on this and other similar restaurants, I think some locals would love to see things go upscale a little bit too.", "author": "Don W."}

But thanks to my pho expert of a brother Brian P., he introduced me to their Pho Kho.  This is pretty much a soup-less bowl of pho, but the noodles have been mixed in a sesame oil and fish sauce concoction.  Sounds weird?  Trust me, it's tasty.  Broth comes on the side for your slurping pleasure.\n\nThe space at Pho Tan Hoa is larger than most pho joints in the TL.  The restaurant is pretty clean and most importantly, the chopsticks and spoons at the table are clean.  The menu prices aren't the cheapest though.

Living here in the city for the last five years with a larger vietnamese population than NYC, I thought I would be able to find the right combination in a bowl of pho: tasty beef broth, noodles cooked al dente, more than 3 different pho options, two bowl size options, and affordable. \n\nThe vietnamese in me was ecstatic to finally find such a place called Pho Tan Hoa. They def have a larger variety of pho options than I have seen in other vietnamese restaurants in the city. I appreciate large portions and was excited to order the large Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare steak with beef balls) and found it to be a huge ass meal on its own. Though I was sad to see only two beef balls (I think one ball was cut in two) floating helplessly, the flavor of the broth, the proportion of beef and noodles, and the amount of thai basil I crushed in the broth made it just right. \n\nIn my last visit to this joint, I was entertained by the 15-minute conversation the servers had in vietnamese about the weather while watching the news.

Would you believe it if I told you that I somehow found my way to china town in Paris without knowing a lick of french just to satisfy my noodle cravings.  Maybe it's some kind of noodle mojo that I've inherited from my parents as they aways seem to know where the asian places are in any city.\n\nOn a recent visit to SF we stumbled across this noodle house two blocks from our hotel.   It never ceases to amaze me how quickly the scene changes from block to block in urban cities.  One moment we are basking in the golden sun near ritzy Union Square and the next minute after a couple of turns we are literally smack dab in the grimy hood.  Not a bad thing since decent viet food usually thrives in these surroundings.\n\nIt was 7:50 AM when we peered into this shop and the owner was cordially waving us in.  He said that they didn't open until 8 AM but he proceeded to seat us anyways.   Their trough sized pho xe lua (XL bowl), which was delivered to our table at lightening speed, could have easily feed all four of us.  The broth is comparable to what we get in southern california and as such had just as much msg in it as well.  No filet mignon here, but the meats were well prepared and the greens were plentiful.  By 8:15, the locals were packing in plenty.  In truth the pho here is probably only a 3.5 compared to Little Saigon, but the simple fact that I can have a decent bowl of pho on a Saturday morning hundreds of miles from home is priceless.\n\nWe also ventured outside of the noodle confines and found the rice dishes palatable as well.  Their com suon nuong (pork chop rice) was v.tasty.  The meat was grilled just enough to char the edges without drying.  I believe it was com tam (broken rice) that was used, but I could be wrong as my memory tends to be fuzzy in these early morning hours.  \n\nEntrees and noodles range from 5 - 8 bucks so the prices here are very forgiving on the pocket book. \n\nOverall, I think this place deserves a visit by locals and visitors alike who would like to sample vietnamese street food in a casual atmosphere.

My main bowl ended up cloudier than the small broth bowl for cooking.  Not good.\n\nThe other thing is that the iced coffee was also really really small.  To make it look more qualified, they should have just used smaller cups.  The big, half empty cup (including ice and coffee) just emphasized how little beverage was served.  \n\nThe spring rolls were unspectacular.  Nothing unique or notable at all.  The wrapper looked like ordinary spring roll wrapper.  The filling was not particularly meaty nor flavorful.  The lettuce was very small and there was no noodle to include with the mint and lettuce.  \n\nThe broth was clear and a lovely caramel color.  However, not very hot.

I don't have to order, the guy remembers what I order. #7 large with beef on the side.  The prices have jumped up the last couple years. You get a lot of noodles, and a lot of meat. The broth is a little on the darker side. Sometimes my beef on the side is still a little frozen. But the broth and noodles are consistent. The banh mi bho kho ( bread and beef stew) is good here. Just ask to have the bread toasted. Don't worry about the neighborhood, nobody is going to mess with you unless you're asking to be messed with. I just go strictly for the pho now, haven't had a rice plate here in years.  If you do get beef on the side ask for extra lemon, squirt the lemon on the raw beef mix it up with your chopsticks then throw a little black pepper and a dash of fish sauce. Let it sit for a minute and its good to go. You can dip the raw meat in the side bowl of broth they give you if you like but that defeats the purpose of getting raw beef on the side.", "author": "P P."}

The windows, the tables, the walls, the menus... everything was sparkling, Windex clean.  This is really WONDERFUL... especially in this sketchy Tenderloin neighborhood.\n\nWe ordered two bowls of pho and they were not bad.  The one with the rare steak and meatballs is quite good but the one with the chicken is just ok... there is not much chicken and even the little shreds of chicken were quite tough.  The service is friendly and efficient although they got my order wrong... I had ordered egg noodles  but ended up getting their regular rice noodles instead.  I decided that it wasn't a big deal and just ate that instead.  The prices are not cheap for that location... two \"small\"  bowls of pho came to $18 plus tip.", "author": "Eleanor C."}

They allot nice portions of meat but the quality is marginal since some of it has more fat than I'd like. The service is what you'd expect it to be: your empty glass of water will probably not get noticed, but that's not to say the people who work here aren't nice.

The bowls are huge no matter what size you get, and the food comes maybe ten minutes after you've order it.\n\nTo be honest, I've only been to about ten different pho places in my life, and the majority of them pretty much taste the same. The only difference I notice is the combination and quantity of meats they include and the prices. (Maybe I put too much hoisin sauce to be able to tell the difference.)\n\nI like this place because of the proximity, the prices, and the generous quantities of meat they give you with your order of pho.\n\nThe neighborhood is not that bad.

And after reading the comments about this place I decided to go there for breakfast. Early in the morning Tenderloin seems just to be another neighborhood with the typical amount of less fortuned people. But what else is new? We're in the States and Tenderloin seems to be one of the better 'bad' neighborhoods if you ask me.\n\nAnyway, my GF and I fell immediately for the number 7, though she ordered the smaller one. Besides this I also ordered the 'Cafe sua da' translated as the Iced coffee with milk. Within less than 5 minutes the order arrived and the bowls were indeed huge! You can't get these kind of bowls anywhere in Europe (I'm from the Netherlands). And it tasted just GREAT! There was just no other better way to start my vacation in the States. My GF always wants the bean sprouts to be cooked and that wasn't a problem at all. The Basil leaves could have looked more fresh as there were some black spots on them. \n\nAbout the service, well it's definately not the American style. The waiter (or maybe the owner) is quick and knows his regulars and seems to be the only person who attempts to have a normal chat with a clear accent. The waitress seems not to have a lot of happy things going for her as there is not really a smile to be seen and doesn't really say much except for the amount that you have to pay at the register.\n\nThe bowl wasn't only big, the pho was filled full with steak, tripe etc. It tasted so good that my gf and I went back the next day. But I must say that the big bowl was a little too big for me and I know that my stomach is not small. The Pho served here is definately better than the Pho I had in Berkeley. \n\nBTW, the Pho served here is more the 'South Vietnamese' type of Pho that I prefer, unlike the 'Northern Vietnamese' type of Pho that they serve at the Turtle Tower.\n\nI have been to Hawaii for the past 2 weeks and now I'm back in SF and just can't wait to get there again (like in 2,5 hours after writing this review).", "author": "Ha V."}

One block to go and I'm already hallucinating of foliage... basil, saw leaves, cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions and chili envelop me.  I am delirious.  I am sweating.  I am so hungry I could eat the little Vietnamese guy that seems to live at Pho Hoa.  His voice resembles that of a 30 year old Vespa crossed with a lisping auctioneer.  I never know what the hell he's saying...but I don't care.  And like the finest of doctors - he immediately recognizes my symptoms, and within three minutes my liquid utopia is in front of me.  It's piping hot broth, full of flavor, has a wonderful depth to it.  I could just throw a sippy straw in the damn thing and go to town.  But first I must throw every damn bit of foliage lying around into it.  But this is where I stray from the mainstream.  I'll then gussy it up with hot sauce and Hoisin sauce.  A crime, I know.  I consider myself to be both hot AND sweet, and so naturally, I'd like my Pho to resemble me.  You are what you eat, after all.  \n\nAnd damnit - we both taste Pho-nomenal.\n\nMy significant other generally does not order the Pho, substituting instead some sort of beef over rice concoction.  As delightful as his dish looks, I secretly think him a fool every time.  He always orders a fried egg atop his dish, and we are now three for three for his dish arriving egg-less.

I was in a rush, so I couldn't eat there, but wanted to bring it back to my desk. I asked the fella how much time it would take to make Pho to go, and he said \"four minutes\" -- which seemed surprisingly fast, and also surprisingly specific for a waiter at a venue like that. I looked through the menu, chose #20: the chicken version (sans the in-shell baby eggs) and sat down at an empty table to wait. While I was sitting there, I perused the menu in more depth, when suddenly my water surprised me with a bag of my food! I mean really... it couldn't possibly have been four minutes. I'd say three max. Probably less. \n\nI was delighted and paid my $6.75, and went back to my desk at work, where I proceeded to pull out the big assortment of items in the bag: a huge styrofoam bowl of broth, a plastic bag of flavoring items: fresh cilantro and basil, sliced jalapeno, fresh lemon, and a little dish of flavored sauce. Then there was a paper box full of the fixin's for the Pho: strips of fresh cooked chicken and bean sprouts. I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting a couple of other ingredients too, but that's the basics. They included a fork, spoon, chopsticks and a bunch of napkins -- and I used them all! I added the ingredients in the proportions that I wanted, and I tell you -- IT WAS SO DELICIOUS! The broth itself had a wonderful taste, and the ingredients were so fresh. Nothing was wilted or unpleasant in any way.  And it was a huge amount for lunch. Two people could easily split this -- which qualifies the place with that extra-special quality that I love so much: cheap-eats!\n\nNext time I'm going to eat there in the restaurant, because although it was delicious at work, the hand-mixing of an assortment of ingredients is not conducive to a paper-strewn desk. The inside of the restaurant didn't look too bad (although really, I wasn't there long enough to get much of an impression!) -- but it was your standard low-budget formica and florescent lights, and I'm just going to cross my fingers that the condiments and walls and stuff look clean when examined up close. (I will completely write off a dirty/greasy-looking restaurant, no matter how delicious their food is.)\n\nBefore this week, my hands-down favorite big-but-budget soup in town was Chava's (see my review), however this place now has earned position right up beside by beloved Chava's chicken soup.", "author": "Zoe H."}

It's how the noodles stay chewy and not expanded and soggy at the end from the broth. It's also the sesame oil (I think) that they drizzle in the noodles that you don't get if you order the regular pho. I used to wonder why they serve two bowls of broth with the dry pho, but I recently was told that if you opt for your beef served on the side, which I do, they give you one bowl of broth to eat your noodles with and another PIPING hot bowl for you just to cook your rare beef in.

Wasn't too crowded, the service was prompt, and the pho came out steaming hot. The broth was mild and clean-tasting, although I would prefer it to be more flavorful. But I refrained from using any sauce (for I don't believe any broth-based noodle dish should be enjoyed with additional flavor other than what it comes with). The portion was big, enough noodle and meat. The noodle was very soft and almost, I'd say, starchy, which is not a bad thing for me. The beef, however, wasn't the best-quality meat that you can get at a pho place. As a matter of fact, one of the beef (I would guess skirt steak or something similar) was a bit smelly, but tasted fine. It made me think about it a lot though the whole time I was there. But anywho, the overall experience was good. They only take cash, which some people fie upon, but I don't really care if they don't want to give the credit card companies any money. Besides, it is almost customary nowadays to expect a joint only to take cash if it's either in a shady neighborhood or a cheap, ethnic place run by people with less-than-perfect English, right?\n\nThis will be a go-to place for me whenever I crave for pho when I'm at home. I just hope that none of the beef will smell next time. Please don't. I want to like you.\n\n(Note: I care about pho places a lot for some reason, so hence the extensive write-up.)", "author": "Inbae L."}

Soup is flavorful, meat is always fresh and if you order beef on the side, they'll give you an extra bowl of steaming hot soup to cook it in.  The portions are perfect and they always give you just enough noodles with the right amount of tendon, tripe and other good stuff.  The beef meatballs taste good, not rubbery like the other places.  Noodles are of perfect consistency, not too soft and not too chewy.\nService...A trip!  You can always expect the same Vietnamese guy with an accent to greet you.  He talks so fast that it takes a little while to understand what he's saying. At first you might think he is rushing you or being a bit rude, but no, if you've come here as much as we have, you'll realize that he just talks really really fast.  He always says thank you when you leave.  \nSeriously, when my hubby and I crave a bowl of Pho we come here despite a 30 mile drive to the Tenderloin in a pretty seedy neighborhood.\n\nYou can't be a wimp if you want a real bowl of pho...get down to Cracktown and have yourself a PHO DAC BIET with Beef on the side at Pho Tan Hoa.", "author": "Kerry L."}
