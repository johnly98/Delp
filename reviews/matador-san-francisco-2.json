Although the 1 2 3 reposado, that up to now has been her favorite,  it was outshined by the Fortaleza, a peppery surprise. \n\nThe dinner  wonderful, the service impecable.

Let me start with they do not customize anything. It is like everything is premade. They couldn't even add a different dressing to a salad. My 8 year old brother wanted his bistek tacos without onion && they couldn't even remove the onion (long pieces of grilled onion) The al pastor was undercooked. The \"shrimp a la diabla\" was literally shrimp grilled with seasoning. No diabla sauce. The bottled Mexican drinks were hot && the tortillas were soggy. So disappointed.

While I'm a firm believer this should always be free in a proper Mexican restaurant, all pay a buck for these salsas. And almost, pasta sauce sweet but with the pepper taste you expect. This ones easy. The orange, habanero salsa is not spicy but a slow burn that's great with a margarita back. The pico is perfectly basic. Mix in a little with your favorite of the other two for a great blend. \n\nSmall Ass Tacos, 3 for $11! Really? These are barely $2ea size in a street size tortilla. Does the meat make the taco worth the price? Not the barbacoa. It's dry inside despite being soaked in sauce. It dropped all over the plate as I crewed through the taco. \n\nHow about that house margarita $5HH? It's ok. Better for the happy hour price. \n\nThis bright and airy taco stop seats about 12 at the bar, another 4 at the back bar and tables for 25-30. It's loud and causal. This is where you come for a HH margarita or three, ships and guacamole $5HH on your way home or for a late lunch.

You can tell that it was made with fresh ingredients. Ok, I'm raving already and those were only the appetizers. \n\nDid I mention that it is also a tequileria? Yeah, I'm mad I didn't know such heavenly places exist. They had options for tequila flights that looked appealing, but thought I should try one of their margaritas. I had their hibiscus margarita and it was totally awesome. My gal pals enjoyed the pomegranate and classic and also were pleased. \n\nNow on to the main meals. The street tacos were enjoyed by our party. The meats were flavorful and tender.

New spot, super fun. Great bartender. Everything. I'd been raving about this spot ever since bc of that time. The bartender was chatting it up w my friends and I the entire time, and was making some great drinks and providing some awesome recos. The drinks were perfectly boozy. The fish tacos were jam packed w flavor. Everything was spot on. \n\nSADLY, the last two times that I've been here since then, have been exceptionally bad experiences. In fact, the very last time that I went about a month ago was by far the worst. The waitstaff were both neglectful and rude - took over 20+min to take our order and after 30+mins of not getting any of our order, we inquired about our food + drinks, only to be shrugged off. Then, a few mins later, we saw our waitress running out of the restaurant, realizing her shift was over (never told us) and our food + drinks STILL weren't there. Had to flag down who we thought our new waiter was and explain the same thing. Was ignored and shrugged off again. It was pretty sad bc I was literally raving about this spot to the two friends I brought that night. \n\nWe received a half apology about \"system error\" an HOUR after our order was placed by possibly the manager, who wasn't that sincere about the mistake either. Honestly, it seemed like our original waitress never put in our order bc the four tables who came in after us got ALL their food + drinks within 20mins max.

In the meantime, other 2 tops came and sat but our party of 3 had to wait until one table in the corner was ready. I guess putting two tables together for a group of 3 was not something they could accommodate. Once sat at the table the staff was even less attentive to us. We didn't get water until after ordering and asking for it. We ordered margaritas for the table, only one came and that was after asking for it twice. \n\nNow this is where things went really south, if the service wasn't already a deterrent.

My friend and I split the two orders of tacos ($11), which can be easily turned into two more tacos since they use double tortilla and a lot of meat. We opted for the Tacos De Matador of a roast beef brisket, sticky mango salsa, and pickled onions. This is their most popular taco meat flavor and it was indeed very tasteful and delicious. For more than $5 per taco, it is very expensive. I also had an order of the Equites ($8), which is basically like corn in a cup. The corn was freshly cut off the cobb topped with parmesan, chile and cr\u00e8me. The first half was tasty with the toppings, but then it became just corn and a lot of liquid, which wasn't so great anymore.\n\nWith a Yelp check-in, you get a free trio salsa and chips. The chips were crispy and salsa was tasteful. It's a pretty good deal even for the price of $3. The problem was that I still saw the charge for my chips and salsa on my bill and had to request for it to be taken off without even an apology for the mistake.

We stopped by here late afternoon and was not disappointed. \n\nThe taco matador (slow roasted beef brisket) and taco barbacoa (slow cooked and shredded beef) are both great. I slightly prefer the latter because the flavor is more intense - love this slow cooking movement applied to mexican cuisine. \n\nThe Pozole (pork and hominy stew) has a twist to it with a chunk of super tender spare rib on top. Make sure that you put in all of the accompaniment (onion, lemon juice, radishes, cilantro) to give extra flavor (didn't care for the cheese element though). \n\nFor the desserts, we liked the Chocolate flan and didn't care for the churros (not fluffy enough and too sweet). \n\nI also love the airy ambience, tall ceiling, and the striking painting on one side of the wall.

Mexican food is among my favorite and reviews seemed good. Sold!\n\nWe made our way inside and were seated immediately. There seemed to be only one server and it's not a huge joint, but service in general was rather impersonal. He didn't seem interested in telling us a little bit about the menu, answering questions, making recommendations, or getting us our bill (that came later, of course). \n\nTo eat, we ordered chips and guac (as well as salsas which were free with the Yelp check in offer!), and I was hungry so opted for three barbacoa tacos. Everything came out fast, but in general, was lacking severe flavor. The guac needed more salt and was rather bland, while the barbacoa was pretty fatty and dripping in juices that also had no flavor. The salsas were pretty good and I tried to add some of them to my tacos to pump up the flavor, but didn't do much. I will say that the tacos did have a generous portion of meat on them, so just two tacos were enough to fill me up. \n\nI wouldn't rush back here nor really recommend it to my friends.

However, they fall short on this mission by serving up bland, under-seasoned food that is more comparable to British cuisine than something you would find south of the border. Examples:\n\n1. The Salsa Trio - I would normally ignore the fact that they charge $3 for this despite most good Mexican restaurants in the area serving chips and salsa for free; but the salsas were bland and not spicy at all. One even tasted like it had just been poured out of a jar. Just boring and uninteresting which should not be permitted when we live in a community so rich in Mexican culture and cuisine. There was literally more spice in my lemonade than in the salsa.\n\n2. The Al Pastor and the Matador tacos - Both were under-seasoned and forgettable. Bland and boring, it tasted like the chefs are focused more on catering to the tourist population than actually making good Mexican food. I feel bad saying this because, again, it feels like they are trying. As a neighbor in the community, I really hope this feedback helps. \n\nI was overly excited to try this place, I really was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-12", "description": "I have mixed feelings about Matador. The food and drinks are pretty decent, but the menu is pricey, and even the happy hour prices/portions are on the more expensive side.\n\nI originally decided to try Matador after looking through the Yelp page and seeing that they had a lunch/happy hour menu that goes from lunch time to 6pm. Pretty lengthy! I also saw that they had pitchers so of course I was immediately down to try it out.\n\nI came with a couple of friends on a Friday around 4:30, and surprisingly there was no wait. We obviously decided to start off with a pitcher of the Matador Margarita which was tasty BUT be warned this is definitely NOT a pitcher. It comes in a carafe that is of course filled with tons of ice, and once you divvy it up its really only enough for 3 people to have one small glass, maybe a glass and a half. Once you do the math you're really not saving much versus getting your own glass, which is a shame. We followed up with a couple of the Blanco tequila shots and a carafe of the red sangria, which has tequila in it. Trust me they do not skimp out on the spirits in this one as it is pretty strong. Definitely recommend going for the sangria over the margarita if you want more bang for your buck.\n\nIn terms of the food, we got an order of the guacamole, which came in what appeared to be a small dish but actually had a lot in it. Then we each ordered a couple of tacos. I got the pork al pastor which was amazing along with the Camarones which was SO spicy. I'm assuming it was something in the mango salsa but even for a girl that likes spicy foods it was way too much for me. I was only able to eat the shrimp which was disappointing. Also, I think the menus in the photo section must be a little out of date, but there's not really a 'happy hour' special price on these with 3 tacos for $10. It's 4.50/taco, and if you want 3 it's $12. Not much of a deal and these are pretty small street tacos so you'll likely need to order more if you're actually hungry.\n\nOverall, Matador is a pretty decent place with really friendly staff and a nice atmosphere, but was just a little disappointing for me as I went expecting something different. If you're willing to shell out $50 for 2-3 drinks and a couple tacos then go for it, but if you're looking for a better deal go elsewhere.", "author": "Jaymie S."}

The whole time this restaurant was being renovated I was peeking through the windows on my walk home to see what was going on and when it would open. Finally, a few Sundays ago the fianc\u00e9 and I were craving some good margaritas and guac without having to go down to the Mission so we walked down to Matador.\n\nThe ambiance inside Matador is nice, fairly small but has a cozy feeling and some seating outside for the nice summer days here in SF.  We posted up at the bar and were immediately greeted by the friendly bartender.  The menu is small but simple, which I like. I feel as if a lot of Mexican restaurants have pages and pages of menu options but here it focuses on tacos and salads with some sides and small plates to share. \n\nWe decided to share a pitcher of the house margarita and started (with yelp check in) free trio of salsas with chips (and added on the guac, duh). The house made salsas and guac were fresh and delicious. Also, the bartender made sure to keep the chips comin when we ran out from snacking away.  Served up with an ice cold margarita, this was a fantastic combo to start the meal. You could tell the margarita has all fresh juices and no yucky sour mix to ruin the quality tequila. For dinner I got the Jicama salad and added tofu (yum), my fianc\u00e9 got the tacos Matador (beef brisket with mango salsa).  The portions were hearty and satisfying. Everything tasted great and the bartender was quick to check on us, refill waters, get us extra salsa, etc, during our whole meal.\n\nMatador is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood.

It tasted like boiled chicken as the filling and it wasn't baked in the sauce so the watery, green liquid was just sitting on top of the dry corn tortillas and then cheese was melted on top.  The verde sauce also didn't taste like anything.  The rice wasn't good.  Beans, nope.  I only ate what I did because we hadn't eaten all day.  The server said people love those enchiladas.

I was there with my friends on a Thursday afternoon and we barely stayed there for an hour. However, our waiter (manager?) was very obvious in his attempts to empty the table for other customers. When he brought the check while we were finishing our drinks, he said plainly that 'there are people waiting for a table'. It seemed weird and inappropriate, but just when we were signing our receipts and calculating tips, he came back and said that 'it's been a while, people are waiting'. It pissed me off! I work in customer service myself and that's what is utterly rude and impolite to say the least. And in my defense, when I first tried out Matador I had to wait for a table for more than an hour and a half and I WAS patient. But I'm not going to put up with the hideous attitude and service to customers.\n\nOn top of all that I found out that even though we paid in split with two cards, each (!) of our bank accounts was charged the full price.

When friend said 'never mind' / 'skip the taco' the waitress suddenly decided my friend could have just one taco. There was no minimum order on menu and tacos were priced individually. \n\nPlus, even though there were only 2 tables with people at them, our drink order took so long to be delivered that frozen margarita was melted. We won't be back. \n\nI 'checked in' on Yelp and when I asked waitress if that meant they would knock $3 off price of chips we ordered, she said 'no.'

I came here on a whim after deciding that I didn't want Italian food for dinner (we had reservations across the street). \n\nWe were seated immediately and I checked in on Yelp to discover that we could get free chips & guac (with an order of an entree)! Great start so far... we ordered a pitcher of the Matador margarita, my sister had the reposado tequila flight, and we ordered the following:\n\nCostillas Con Chipotle Agave ribs - delicious, falls off the bone, melts in your mouth. I could've had a plate of these for dinner by itself. Add a side of arroz & frijoles, and you're straight.\nBarbacoa tacos - not being a huge fan of barbacoa, these tacos were pretty good. I added some of their hot sauce (I think it was habanero) for a little kick. Beware, the hot sauce is spicy as hell!\nCarnitas tacos - good but not very memorable. \nDe Filete (steak) tacos - my least favorite of all the tacos. I didn't like the salsa casera that they put on the taco. \nAl pastor tacos - this must be a new dish since I don't see it on their menu online... nice sweet & smoky flavor, I think their hot sauce comes on the taco, so you've been warned.\nMatador margarita - excellent! Tasted really fresh, clean, and STRONG. Good deal at $30/pitcher since you get about 4 glasses out of it. By the glass is $12.\n\nService was pretty good for the most part. Our servers rotated between a female and a (super hipster) male and while they were both nice, the service just seemed very..... brusque. We were interested in dessert and had to ask when our check was brought out; we wanted to share some flan and our server asked us which one out of the two - uhhh I don't know, can we see the menu again?? After debating between the mezcal and guava flan, turns out I didn't really feel like flan after all. It could've been the feeling of being rushed that turned me off, to be honest. But it wasn't anything serious either.\n\nIf I find myself back in the neighborhood, I would totally come back to Matador for the excellent margaritas and work my way through the other tacos on the menu. The ambiance is nice enough to just sit back and enjoy drinks, too.", "author": "Julie B."}

Not recommended for take out. \n\nFor those familiar with the old tenant, Sugar Cafe this place is half the size.

You get maybe a cup (see picture) worth of sprouts. Sprouts still in bright green form and held its integrity, pretty healthy. They were tangy and spicy with a hint of sweetness. Sunflower seeds with the dish was a nice touch, different. \n\nCarnitas tacos (2) $11- Came with two corn tortillas, street sized. The pork was very tender and juicy, cut into large inch and a half chunks. Pork had good flavor, would order again.   \n\nSteak tacos (2)$11- Came with one flour tortilla, a bit bigger than street sized. Again, large chunks of meat, and cooked very well. Beef was flavorful and tender. \n\nI asked the waiter if this was enough for two people and he said it was perfect. Truthfully, I think we could have eaten another dish...and we're not big eaters. Tacos don't come with rice or beans and if you don't order any sides or apps, be prepared to walk out hungry.

The ahi tuna taco however was delicious. A wonderful balance of bright flavor and seasoning between the tuna, red cabbage slaw, and avocado. At $11 for two tacos, prices are on the higher end of things. The tacos aren't particularly filling so one order might not be enough so the bill can add up quick.\n\nIt's like a Tacolicious by Union Square.

Matador did not reply. \n\nMy boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood. We have eaten here 10+ times, lunch and dinner. We usually order the enchiladas verdes which are pretty good, when the shrimp isn't grey and undercooked.  We've had other questionable visits in the past, ranging from cold food to unfriendly service, but we've been loyal and stuck with it. \n\nLast Friday night, we came to the restaurant around 9:30, pretty late and the restaurant was busy. We had a small pup with us so we sat outside, which was empty, and situated our own tables and chairs. There were 4 of us. I went inside to let someone know we were out there and to use the restroom. We were not in a hurry and were simply happy to have found a patio with a heater. When I went inside, the waitress (who has served us in the past on empty weekend afternoons) told me there weren't menus available but would bring one out shortly. No problem. After using the restroom I saw a couple had freed up at the front desk, so I took them out with me. The restaurant was full but we deemed to be the only party waiting so we thought it would be ok to wait and sit outside. \n\nSo soon enough, the waitress came out with silverware, napkins and menus. We had already looked over the menu so we were ready to order. She said she'd come back out since they were busy. Again, no problem. 10 minutes later one of our party went inside to ask if someone would be out to take our order. Same waitress said to him, \"I'll be out when I'm free. It's busy tonight and you sat yourselves.\" The tone was rude and insinuating that we should not have come to the restaurant, that we were imposing on her for choosing this place for dinner. We got up and left. \n\nWe have had this waitress before and while we've tolerated it to support our neighborhood businesses in the past, this was unacceptable. She is typically unwelcoming, but last night she was flat out rude and we wont be visiting anymore.

For starters, I loved the a-frame sign out front that said something along the lines of \"Working out will make you look better but so will tequila.\"  The restaurant is modern but still has touches of Mexico throughout.  Also, the small restaurant located in Union Square was very clean.\n\nI enjoyed the salsa trio, guacamole and their house salad with shrimp.  I loved that none of the dishes were heavy and the dishes really felt like a cross between Mexican and Californian Cuisine.  The house salad, which is technically called \"Ensalada Casera\" had a light vinaigrette dressing, plump cherry tomatoes, crunchy pepitas and roasted corn in it.  I think I could eat that salad every day, especially since you can get it topped with different proteins.\n\nAt night I hear this place really comes alive but I was glad to have a quiet lunch with my BF and friend.  Overall, this was a great place to enjoy a quiet lunch and next time I will definitely try the tacos.", "author": "Courtney K."}

It was nice that they were accommodating to our 10 year old's taco alteration requests.  The tacos are ordered a la carte, at $4 per taco.  I tried three varieties:  Barbacoa (shredded beef), Taco al Pastor (bacon wrapped slow roasted pork), and the Tacos de Matador (slow roasted beef  brisket).  Each taco was a flavor explosion, but the signature Matador was my favorite. The Matador taco was topped with sticky mango salsa and some apple and onion slaw.  Amazing!  I would highly recommend this place, and suggest that you order a variety of tacos.  There are plenty of choices, so mix, match and enjoy.", "author": "John M."}

This was relief on a hot sunny San Francisco afternoon.\n\nI must admit Matador's food was really surprisingly good - 4 stars!  I'm from San Diego so obviously I have exposure to Mexican inspired dishes.  Wife ordered the Pozole which she really loved.  I had two tacos, the Barbacoa and the Carnitas.

Upon sitting down our waiter asked if we wanted to start off with some chips and salsa, which we gladly obliged to as it's free with a Yelp check-in! He brought out guac as well, which we didn't question at the time. We should have, though, because we got charged the $9 for it and didn't order it. My friend and I felt a little ripped off by this but didn't feel like making a fuss about it.\n\nThe chips and salsa were good. Each salsa had a strong kick to it. For my entree I ordered 2 al pastor tacos (one pork and one fish) and one spicy shrimp taco. They messed up my order. I ended up getting two fish tacos (I believe one was al pastor and one was a regular fish taco.) Not one out of the 3 tacos had pork in it. However, the regular fish taco was pretty tasty. I enjoyed it a lot better than the al pastor fish taco. And the salsa on the regular fish taco was spiiicy! I was suffering a little. Half good suffering, half in a lot of pain suffering. The shrimp taco was alright. But at $4/taco, I think I'll pass next time and go somewhere else.\n\nTo wash down the spiciness I ordered the watermelon agua fresca ($5) which was absolutely delicious! Love that they use real watermelon (for 5 bucks they BETTER). But seriously it was so refreshing. Best thing I consumed here. \n\nFor what it's worth the guac wasn't even that good. Not worth $9.

We couldn't think of what we'd done but thought there had to be a reason for our waiter seemingly ignoring us multiple times and then just being rude. After reading the other reviews here I realize that it wasn't us - this is just their standard treatment for guests.\nFood took excessively long.\nWhen trying to flag our waiter he'd make eye contact but then just walk away -several times.\nUsed the yelp check in deal for the free salsa/chips and had to remind the to bring it multiple times.\nI ordered my fish tacos with the aoli on the side but the waiter told me they actually don't serve the aoli anymore. That's totally fine by me. Except then my tacos arrived covered in aoli. One of the managers did offer to replace it but I didn't want to wait another 30-40 minutes for 2 tacos as my friends would have been done eating before they arrived.\n\nFood\nGuacamole - solid. Fresh and full of all the avocadoy goodness that us millinials purchase instead of houses\nQueso - don't shame me but I like queso. It might not be Mexican but its damed tasty. Well it should be .. but it's not at matador. Look -this shouldn't be difficult. Take cheese that liquifies melt it, give to me. These guys had piles of mushrooms, big slices of pepper- other random junk. It smelled like a pizza but not as good.\nTacos  - Not bad. All of us said they were good. None of us were blown away. The $7 taco plate at Pancho Villa is significantly better. \n\nLastly\nYour no mix n match on tacos rule is obnoxious. Not giving the option to just buy one taco of any kind is even more obnoxious fuckery. Pure Fuckery. You aren't good enough to give us taco rules!

Four kinds of tacos with very generous portions of meat, including a veg option, crazy good salad with fresh veggies and cojita, corn with crema, yummy beans, etc. Our friends were constantly coming up to me telling me the how delicious everything was. For dessert they put out insanely good coffee and caramel flan as well as churros with chocolate and caramel sauce. \nYum.\n\nCocktails were some of the best we've had, in particular the blackberry smash, the Matador old fashioned and the spicy margarita. The bartenders were very cool, polite and helpful with suggesting drinks, the service excellent and Kris the manager was very attentive and took such good care of us. I'm really blown away by the great experience we had and would highly recommend Matador for a private party. They can seat 40 but we had 55 or so guests and the space worked great, not super crowded.

Tasted really weird. My boyfriend had a regular michie & it wasn't as bad. As a server myself, I tend to find myself being supper critical about service and food portions. Their taco el matador was delicious ! And really well served . The shrimp taco was very bland with only two huge shrimps. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and it didn't specify it had sour cream drizzled on top (he hates sour cream). So he really wasn't digging them. The guacamole we ordered was a scam for 9.50$.

Two thumbs up.\n\nFOOD: So, so delicious. We got....\n\n- Chips and Salsa to start ($3) very tasty home made chips and great salsas\n- Ribs, a newer item on the menu. The meat was so tender it came right off the bone. Yum.\n- Carnitas Tacos ($11) maybe my favorite item that we tried. Mixture of crispy and soft textures, flavors rejoicing in your mouth!\n- Pescado Tacos aka Ahi Tuna ($11) very light, fresh, and tasty in flavor\n- Churros ($8)\n\nDRINK: Here's my only caveat, the frozen margaritas ($13 for the large) have a ridiculous amount of alcohol in them. Even if you want to get more than 1, you probably shouldn't. With that said, very fun to order :)", "author": "Rachel R."}

I was not impressed. \nOur drinks took about 20 mins to come out and there were only two other tables occupied. \nI agree with another review that the chips and salsa were the best dish. Chips were fresh and well seasoned and the salsa was flavorful with the right amount of heat. \nMy Ranchero soup was bland and was missing something fresh. I wanted to ask for avocado but finding our server was impossible. \nService needs much improvement. No one checked in on us after we received our food. And I had to walk up to the bar twice to get my one drink. Each time the server made me feel like I was out of place. \nFinally after sitting with all our empty glasses and most of our empty plates on the table we flagged down a server to bring us our check. \nMy friends did get a few flights of tequila that they liked but when a flight (3 shots) is $18 and then you order one shot for $14 this doesn't quite seem right. \nSo if you just want some chips, salsa, and tequila this is probably your place (provided you have some time to kill).

A restaurant it may be posing as - but is not.\nSadly, unlike GOOD and authentic Taco joints, this place offers mediocre tasting and presented food; no salsa bar or hot sauce in sight!! no extra napkins and no cilantro (wtf?!!) and a less than rapid service (pleasant but inattentively slow).\n\nMy two a la carte (unsizzling shrimp) tacos came with watery salsa, warm-ish, on cold tortillas (probably because they were served on a napkin on a cold steel platter.....PSSST, guys, real restaurants have dishes!. My chips were luke warm, in a cold steel bucket. I had to ask for salsa and was asked which one vs a choice (and charged a buck). The $10 side of guacamole was ice cold from the fridge, and did not have the texture - or flavour - of home made. Granted it was a cold day, but i would have been nice to only experience half of the temperature gradient versus all of it in one meal.\n\nSo...if you are looking for a marguerita and already had a couple beers and didnt make it to the Mission that night, go for it.\nOtheriwse - um, nope.\n\n2x tacos\n1x guacamole\n1 person\n$25", "author": "tigipop .."}

A margarita that I had to request three times before he repeated the right one. It was a good recipe so I look forward to coming back and having one as I ordered it. Then we had to repeat both items we were ordering several times before we were convinced he had them correct. We even pointed to them on the menu. I was able to watch over his shoulder as he painstakingly tried to enter the TWO items in the computer and was relieved when he succeeded.  The food is very good. We weren't in a hurry so we stuck out his fumbling.  Can't say the same for the two other separate people who tried to order from him but then gave up and left.

Again, no problem, we can just switch them ourselves. Food comes very quickly, which is fine cause we're starving. My girlfriend only got one of the tacos she ordered. \n\nSo, again, no problem. Maybe the waitress forgot. We'll ask her when she comes back to check on us. But she never did. We wait and wait. Try to flag her down but she doesn't see us (or ignoring us??).

Although the bartender acknowledged our presence, he didn't hand us a menu until after he was done loading the dishwasher which was five minutes after we sat down. Seriously?!? It takes less than ten seconds to grab a menu and give it to us. \n\nFinally after about 15 minutes our food and drinks order was taken. I had the horchata matador and the tacos de matador. Both were ok. The meat in the taco had a lot of fat on it and the tortillas were really greasy. We ordered guacamole as well but never received.\n\nThere seemed to be turmoil between the staff too. At one point a man, who might be the owner, had to come in and talk to the bartender and server. I understand that sometimes coworkers don't get along, but don't make it so obvious! \n\nNot sure if I'd give Matador another chance. Maybe if they improve their service. \n\nOne last thing to note, you can't mix and match tacos during dinner hours. This was annoying as I wanted to try more than one flavor.", "author": "Marycruz M."}

With some groups this is fine but my buddy is vegetarian so we each got to try only one type of taco this meal.\n\nI ended up with the carnitas tacos, which seemed pretty flavorless. I was told the vegetarian tacos weren't much better.\n\nThe guac wasn't particularly good relative to others that I've eaten recently. The corn was the best thing we ordered this meal.\n\nAt least the service was attentive and the prices for a sit down dinner in a nice environment were relatively cheap.", "author": "Jeff L."}

I've been on the fence for a while about giving this place a review because it always has available seating, which is almost impossible to find at good restaurants in SF. What can I say, when I find a gem, I want it all to myself.\n\nI highly recommend their Carnitas and Al Pastor tacos. Their guacamole is a must and definitely get the salsas--they're different from what you usually get at taquerias. I never had this because I avoid dairy, but my friends all seem to enjoy the Esquite.\n\nAs for drinks, my favorite is the Passionfruit Margarita but I've also enjoyed the Honeydew Rum Mule. \n\nAlthough the service can be hit or miss (which I attribute to it being a rather new establishment), the staff is always very friendly.", "author": "Rafaella S."}

I don't see frozen margaritas often so I was excited about that. Everything turned out to be a let down. My friend and I both ordered margaritas and they were almost impossible to drink. They tasted nothing like the flavor they should've been and we had to tell the waitress that we couldn't drink them. We ordered Barbacoa tacos and the meat tasted and smelled like fish? We contemplated for a minute that maybe this was tuna instead of beef?? The taco was so greasy and piled with meat that we couldn't pick up the soaked and soggy tortilla. We had to eat the meat with a fork right out of the taco. I will say that the chips and guacamole were pleasantly delicious but not good enough for me to return.

Quickly yelping it we decided to go in.  In a touristy area, this place seemed like it was not the type of place to cater to tourists - so we thought it would be fine.\n\nI rely heavily on Yelp when I travel, especially in SF.  I tend to trust Yelper's in SF the most.  But oof - this was a miss!  I hope it was a Monday night issue, otherwise not sure this place will be around long.  Service was horrible, unengaged, and we never received a 'thank you'.  We were brought the wrong entre and had to send it back and did not receive a 'sorry about that' or an offer for a complementary something while we waited painfully long for the right item.  Food service was slow and when we got each item, it was cold.  The veggie tofu taco sounded promising but was horrid - I make a million % better veggie taco at home!  Boo.\n\nThe icing on the cake for my friend was no changing station for her baby in the restroom.  She had to change her baby on the floor!  Ick.  We realize there are not a lot of people with kids in SF, but seriously?  She lives here - help a woman and baby out people!\n\nI do not wish anyone harm or closure, so I hope this experience was just an unfortunate miss on a single night, otherwise this place needs to get their act together or they will never survive in the competitive SF restaurant landscape.", "author": "D B."}

It's a good thing the food is bomb.com to cover up that identity discrepancy. \n\nI strolled in with four of my best girlfriends during peak hour, 6:30pm on Cinco De Mayo of all godforsaken times to visit a place that doesn't take reservations. But like one of those surreal sequences in a movie where everything goes well for the protagonist, a table was just waiting there for us, glimmering of hope and loud laughter and amazing food and Instagram selfie opportunities. Nice! We snatched it up and proceeded to start our drinking. \n\nAmong the 5 of us we enjoyed:\n-White Sangria\n-Red Sangria\n-Margaritas (rocks not frozen)\n-Something frothy and pink that resembled a Will Cotton painting and tasted like a rosebud (but in a good way) \n\n...and the food portion, oh my:\n-Fish Tacos\n-Carnitas Tacos\n-Carne Asada Tacos\n-Guacamole\n-Queso Fundido\n\nIt's mentionable that when they brought the Queso, which can best be described as a kitchen sink approach to dip, and also a casserole, and also maybe a cheese party, at least two nearby tables craned their necks under the seductive aroma and sizzle of a bubbling melted dish and asked us \"what is THAT?\" (You're welcome Matador, I just upsold your other patrons). \n\nSuffice to say my girlfriends and I turned into monsters and didn't come up for air until we ate as much as possible. Also fair to say our selfies didn't turn out so cute, as it sometimes goes when you've just consumed like five hedonists competing for the most severe \"before\" transformation pic. \n\nWhich, turns out, is exactly what you want in an excellent taco place in Union Square- drinks and food so good, your post-dining selfies look like a disaster.\n\nPredictions: This place will polish up their preparedness for massive crowds, and kill it. The Queso, heaping, unique street-style tacos and gorgeous drinks will be their signature items, and they'll change their name to a more appropriate \"Matadorito\".", "author": "Ashley T."}

First off, when we got there, it was empty but he still took 20 min to take our order. He wasn't the friendliest person and when I ordered the large marg with the extra floater option (yes, it was a bit of a ridiculous drink) he scoffed. He never came to check up on us and 3 times he asked us to move our stuff (it's a tiny place and he had us all cramped together and all we had was our work backpacks!! There was no place to put them!! First to the left of us, now to the right, now put it on our lap! He also did it so rudely.) \n\nWe were so close to the other table, that I could hear them complain about the terrible service too! He treated large parties well but just ignored couples!!!

Shrimp tacos borrachos had really generously sized shrimp, two is enough, especially if you order appetizers. The prickly pear (Tunas, not the fish, but the cactus) Margarita was good, but the hibiscus (jamaica) Margarita was better.

The house made chips definitely win though.\n\nCamarones a la Diabla tacos - Spicydeliciousspiciness. Spicy, meaty shrimp, on amazing corn tortillas.

But at $11 it was half ice in a 5 or 6 ounce glass.\n\nPina de mezcal - Also very good. The roasted pineapple was sublime. Remind me to roast pineapple. Again a huge ice block in a small glass and a little bit lackluster on the mezcal itself.\n\nCremitas-  dessert was the worst part of the meal.

We were the only two in the restaurant. We ordered some chips and salsa that were very tasty. I ordered the steak enchiladas and was disappointed in the flavor. Bland, very bland is the best way to describe it. Also the food took a really long time. We were still the only people in the restaurant and it took forever. If you are looking for a fast lunch or some flavorful Mexican food I would go elsewhere.

We started with chips and salsa trio which was pretty typical for Mexican restaurants.  The fundido was a chorizo mixture with cheese on top.  It was different than other fundidos we've had and not necessarily in a good way.  We ordered carnitas tacos, fish tacos and the beet salad.  Probably the best thing we ordered was the salad.  The tacos were chocked full of meat, just average for our taste.  No iced tea was available, so we drank water since we don't drink alcohol at dinner.  We ate out on the street which was plenty warm under the heater even though it was cold and raining.", "author": "Rob C."}

I can't understand why you MUST order a minimum of 2 of each type. Then I ask for salsa with my taco... The server says \"that's $3 extra.\" WTF I've never heard of paying an extra $3 for salsa.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "description": "Growing up eating latin foods, I alway look for a good restaurant nearby. The first time I had eaten here was nearly two months ago, I was excited to have a Spanish restaurant in the neighborhood. After I bit into my fish taco though, it lacked flavor or should I say flavor that I am use to. The pozole was a little better but still lacked those classic flavors that I am use to--though I do understand that in each region in Latin America, they have their own version of Pozole. \n\nSo, after a long day at school, I decided to give them another try. I was greeted nicely, and I was allowed to chose a table. After I sat down though, I was quickly forgotten, despite the restaurant not being that busy. After a very long wait (I had almost gotten up an left), the host finally gave me a menu. I looked through it carefully this time and I really had my heart set on the spare-ribs, along with giving the pozole another try. After another long wait the server/host finally took my order where she then proceeded to dash my cravings, they didn't have the spare-ribs for what ever reason. Instead, I ended up ordering the pozole, despite not having the spare-ribs, and the Shrimp Cocktail. The Shrimp Cocktail surprised me and actually had complexity and a kick but then the pozole came. Normally I would be ok when a restaurant gets my order wrong, I had order a cup of pozole, instead they brought me a bowl. After the first bit, I wanted to send it back. Not the pozole that I am use to, but even still, there was something about it that did not agree with me, maybe it was how they make it. If you really want Pozole that I am use to or how my mother use to make it then go to Tlaloc in the financial district. Now they know how to make flavorful food with personality that awakes in your mouth...\n\nOverall for me it is a hit or miss with the food. The service though definitely needs improving...to make my point, I had ordered another strawberry-lemonde, which is all ice and very little drink for $5.00, I didn't get my second drink until after I had paid for my bill. My server apologized and the barback asked if I still wanted it. \"I paid for it, so yes I do.\" They gave it to me in a coffee cup to go. : (", "author": "Tlielaxu M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-16", "description": "Overpriced and Inconsistent!  \n\n2 small bland street tacos per order x 2\n3 partially filled drinks\n1 tiny chips and watery salsa\n1 tasteless, miniscule guacamole\n\nNearly $100!!!!  WTF?!?!?!\n\nOK, I've been here a few times.  This is the first time for a full meal.  It has only been open a month and they are already seriously cutting corners and have revised the menu to increase the prices while decreasing the amount of food/drink.  Unacceptable!\n\nFirst off, they charge $3 for chips and salsa.  Unacceptable!  The \"bucket\" of chips they bring is no larger than one of those small bags at a corner store.  The chips originally were thick, substantial and filling.  Now they are thin and low grade and a shocking small portion.\n\nSecond, the drinks come only 75% to 80% full.  At first I thought it was a fluke but since each one came that way one after the other I guess that is the policy.  Bad form/manner in which to save a few pennies on $10+ drinks!  Rip off!\n\nThird, BOTH the frozen drinks and those made by hand a VERY inconsistent.  They range from great to unpalatable.  When was the last time you had to send a drink back....pretty rare but this warranted it. \n\nThe frozen strawberry marg from the machine was bitter/tart and not slushy. I advised them of this and saw that they added more strawberry liquid to the machine to fix it.  They took the drink they served to me 75% full in the first place with several sips now missing and dumped it into another glass then mixed in more strawberry by hand.  Seriously?!?!?  Why not serve a NEW, fresh, \"fixed\" and FULL drink from the machine you just added the strawberry mix to?!?   The new glass was not even a margarita glass.  It was a water glass and once more had no flavored rim.  I got back about 70% of a drink.  Insultingly cheap and passive aggressive???  \n\n\nFourth, the $8 guacamole was merely a small dish with a scoop of guac made essentially of NOTHING more than a barely smashed chunky avocado.  There was no flavor and the serving was insultingly small. Think the size of a small ice-cream scoop......for $8!? \n\n\nFifth, why are they charging for chips and \"salsa\"?!?!  OK, if you are going to do so then offer something special and/or a serving size that is not insultingly small with watery, thin \"dips/salsas.\" The green \"salsa\" was too thin to \"stick\" to the chips and the chunky pico was swimming in a pool of clear liquid. Gross. \n\nSixth, price changes seem to happen all too often.  They used to charge $10 for a frozen margarita.  This was 4-6 weeks ago when they opened.  It was strong and flavorful and the glass was served FULL.  Now, the same drink is $13, weak/inconsistent and they only fill the glass 80% of the way with no chili salt/sugar rim as originally offered.\n\nSeventh, the steak tacos had ZERO flavor and the meat was thin, luke warm and the portion small.  It reminded me of left overs from the night before that you eat the next day with a hangover.....just a tiny tasteless pile of meat on a tortilla.  \n\nEverything here seems to be geared towards serving as little as possible in both the food and drink portions and over charging for each item....by A LOT!  \n\nWhen was the last time you had marginal street tacos, chips and a partially full drink or two for two people at lunch for almost $100?!?!?!   \n\nI get the feeling they are already barely hanging on and will close soon....even though they only opened a month or so ago.  I could go down the street to Campton Place and have AWESOME drinks and food at a 5 star hotel bar for less than what it cost here for meager pours and small portions.  Why bother?!  \n\nI live here in SF.  I won't be back and will advise others not to waste their time/money. \n\nThe only stand out was the service, which was extremely friendly and accommodating.  But, this was one individual setting her own standards against the rest of the BS described above decided by management.", "author": "John B."}

My manners went out the window when their queso with chorizo came to the table. It took everything in me not to lick the ramekin. Hands down the best queso dish I've ever tried (and I've tried plenty). It's not  your standard homogeneous queso, instead, it's huge chunks of perfectly-seasoned chorizo, corn, pablano chilies, and mushrooms topped with melted cheese. It comes with tortillas, but we asked for chips, too. We also tried the tacos de matador (beef brisket), camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp), and tacos borrachos (battered fish), all of which were divine. These tacos make Tacolicious look like child's play. (Sorry Tacolicious, you were alright, but I've found someone new.) Each of the tacos were unique and all were bursting with flavor...I'm salivating just thinking about them. I also tried their pear margarita and Jamaica sour (a hibiscus tequila drink), and loved them both. It was my first time at this restaurant, but every single thing I tried was absolutely delicious, start to finish. We were lucky enough to have Pablo taking care of us, who made great recommendations, was friendly, and didn't pass judgement as we ordered our third round of tacos!

The food was absolutely amazing and the drinks were mixed properly. I would have given 4 stars if it wasn't for our horrible service. There were only about 5 tables that had other patrons and it was early afternoon, around 12:30 or so, however our server seemed completely out of it. We had to stop her to let her know we were ready to order drinks after about 15 minutes of waiting, and once we began to place our order, she informed us that we had an old drink menu and that none of the drinks we wanted were available. When asked why she would give us a menu that isn't current, she said \"Hold on\" and ran to the back. She then came back and said that all the drinks actually WERE available, and that there was a mix up. About 20 minutes later we had to flag her down AGAIN to say that we were ready to finally order, which seemed to irritate her. I tried to order the barbacoa tacos, and she informed me that they had run out. That excuse seemed odd, as they had just opened at 11:30, but I accepted it because I don't run restaurants, and it is possible that they could have ran out from the evening before. It took another 30 minutes to get our food, but we didn't complain because everything we each ordered was amazing. As we were getting ready to depart, I overheard the table next to us order the barbacoa tacos, and she never mentioned that they didn't have the meat, and actually complimented the patron on ordering it because it was her favorite on the menu. It would have been an amazing experience, if it wasn't for the waitress. It felt as if she didn't want to serve our table, which is unfortunate. At one point, the bartender had to deliver our drinks from the bar because they had been sitting there for so long.

And the food they do have had a strange hipster twist to authentic Mexican food. You don't get free chips and salsa (what kind of \"Mexican\" restaurant does that??). I had the fish tacos and they were really disgusting and not filling at all. A side of rice and beans was $8. That's ridiculous. I went with one other person and we spent forty bucks, and I went home still hungry (didn't ask the other person If they were hungry though).", "author": "Meghan H."}

We ordered a few taco plates they were good but the Queso Fundido was delicious. I would say the place is a bit pricey but it's relative to the location and look. The waitress had an attitude at times, almost snobbish and towards the end of the night she brought us the bill way before it time to close indicating we should leave. All in all the food was good.", "author": "Talia H."}

We stopped for a quick lunch and were the only two people in the place but everything we ordered took forever to arrive and our main dishes, two kinds of enchiladas, were average at best if not completely boring. Nothing to rave about at all. Service absolutely horrible. Lots of staff meandering about but not sure what they were doing.", "author": "Joy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "Very tasty and enjoyable food. Generally great place. I read reviews about the service, but generally when people give bad ratings for service it annoys me - how do you know they're always like that or if the waiter is having a bad day, or just annoyed by the customer. Anyway, my service was just fine. And would totally recommend the Matador Tacos and the pulled pork was fantastic. I didn't care for the Brussels sprouts though, and I love them but didn't really care for the flavor choice. Why does every restaurant think they need a Brussels sprout dish? Anyway, I'd eat here again anytime.", "author": "Jason R."}

We got our appetizers before we even got our drinks! Took a while for the servers to notice us, and take our order. It wasn't even that busy. The food was good, someone got the 2 fish tacos, with a side of corn and beans, while the other got one of the salads. Chips and guac were alright. They didn't serve us the salsa and when asked to make the guac spicier our waitress told us that wasn't possible, but we asked another server if we could and she gave us hot sauce which is basically all we were asking for. On the pricier side of mexican too.", "author": "Deborah G."}

Ordered the shrimp tacos, chicken tacos, guac and chips, and a side of corn. The description for the tacos sounded nice but it sure didn't taste like it. The chicken was dry and the shrimp was bland. The accompaniments in the tacos felt lost. The guacamole and corn were okay, nothing special. The server also seemed like he was lacking in experience.", "author": "Brian C."}

It's a fun, casual environment but makes for a great night out if you're flying solo, with your significant other or in a group. I love the small plates since it allows you to try a few different things. The tacos are all top notch but I think the fried chicken and battered shrimp are my favorites. The guacamole is freshly made and is a perfect balance of all the flavors involved.

The food was good, but I received an incorrect order 3 times and we never got our salad. The runner even delivered the same incorrect order to our table twice.

We were in the mood for Mexican and came across this spot while Yelping. We went for a late dinner and were seated right away without a reservation. The restaurant had a nice modern vibe. The food was great. We used the Yelp offer for the complimentary salsa. We ordered guac, fried chicken tacos, and the steak tacos. For dessert we went with the churros - why not treat ourselves on vacation. Everything was delicious. We tried the prickly pear margarita. That was one of my favorite margaritas I've ever had. The service was also great. It was our waiter's first day but he did a good job and the other staff quickly helped our needs with refilling our water glasses and giving us more chips. The restaurant and bar area still had a nice size crowd after 10pm.
